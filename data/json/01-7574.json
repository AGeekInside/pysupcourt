        "content": "(11:06 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in Number 01-7574, David Allen Sattazahn versus\nPennsylvania.\nBefore we begin the second argument, I would\nlike to welcome a group of French judges from the Cour --\nFrench Cour de Cassation, France's highest court -- who\nare visiting our Court today.\nSoir le bienvenue, Monsieurs.\nMr. Dunham, you may proceed.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT B. DUNHAM\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DUNHAM: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe double jeopardy question presented in this\ncase is whether the statutorily mandated judgment of life\nthat was entered in David Sattazahn's first capital trial\nis, as a matter of Federal constitutional law, a judgment\nthat precludes the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania from\nseeking and obtaining the death penalty in a second\ncapital trial. Pennsylvania was afforded one fair\nopportunity to sentence Mr. Sattazahn to death, and the\njury in his case decided, in accordance with the trial\ncourt's instructions, in accordance with the verdict slip,\nin accordance with the law of Pennsylvania, to report to\nthe court the presence of circumstances that it knew would\ncompel the court to impose a life sentence. That judgment\nof life having been imposed after a full and fair\nopportunity to try, Pennsylvania could not seek death\nagainst Mr. Sattazahn on retrial.\nQUESTION: But that wasn't the result of the\nsame sort of factual determination by a jury that took\nplace in Bullington, was it?\nMR. DUNHAM: No, that's correct, Your Honor.\nThe Pennsylvania -- the factual difference between\nPennsylvania and Missouri is the following, Your Honor.\nIn Pennsylvania -- actually in both States -- if there's a\nunanimous jury verdict, that's the verdict that the court\nimposes, that's the sentence the court imposes. In both\nStates, if the jury does not reach a unanimous verdict,\nthen the court is required as a matter of law to impose a\nlife sentence, so here, when the jury did not -- when the\njury sent its note back saying it was 9 to 3 in favor of\nlife, the court was required as a matter of Pennsylvania\nlaw to impose a life sentence.\nQUESTION: But in Bullington the verdict was\nunanimous, was it not?\nMR. DUNHAM: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Well, isn't that quite a significant\ndifference? Here the jury did not come to a conclusion\none way or the other. They -- they hung.\nMR. DUNHAM: Well, Your Honor, they did not hang\nin the traditional sense of a hung jury, and the\ndistinction between this case and a hung jury case is the\nfollowing. The traditional hung jury case, the lack of --\nwhen there's an absence of unanimity what happens is, the\ntrial court discontinues the proceedings and jeopardy\nnever terminates, and the proceedings are sent back to\nstart over.\nHere, as a matter of Pennsylvania law, the\nlegislature determined in advance, saw the possibility of\na nonunanimous jury as one of the foreseeable outcomes of\nthe trial and in so doing it said, well, if that happens,\nwhat we're going to do is say, the State only gets one\nchance. If the State does not meet its burden of proving\nto all twelve jurors that aggravating circumstances\noutweigh mitigating circumstances, then, well, that's the\nonly chance they get, and if they don't do that --\nQUESTION: But you agree --\nQUESTION: That assumes the point in issue. The\nState says that's not what we're saying, it's a default\nmechanism and that is not the only chance the State gets\nif there's a default. I -- this isn't a State law issue\nwe're arguing. I take it that the case comes to us on the\nassumption that this is -- that Missouri has done is a\ncorrect interpretation of its law. I mean, if the State\nsupreme court says so, so you -- for you to say, oh well,\nthe State says this is the only chance, that's the whole\nissue of the case.\nMR. DUNHAM: Well, Your Honor, this is like\nSmalis versus Pennsylvania, another double jeopardy case\nin Pennsylvania that was a decade before, in which\nPennsylvania -- this Court correctly found that\nPennsylvania could say what was necessary for the court to\nenter a judgment --\nQUESTION: Yes, but --\nMR. DUNHAM: -- but not say what the\nconstitutional --\nQUESTION:\nwhether or not there was double jeopardy, whether or not\nhe, in fact, could be subject to a new trial, but you are\ntelling us that the State in this case has said that this\nis his -- the State's only chance, and that's not the way\nthe State reads this law. That's all I would say.\nMR. DUNHAM: This is what the statute says, Your\nHonor. What the statute -- the statute is very clear\nwhen -- when you look at --\nQUESTION: The statute doesn't say anything\nabout this is the State's only chance.\nMR. DUNHAM: Your Honor, what the statute\nsays -- that's true, the statute does not expressly say\nthis is your only chance. What the statute says, it\ndelineates the two circumstances, and the only two\ncircumstances in which a death sentence may be imposed,\nand then it says, the verdict must be a sentence of life\nimprisonment in all other cases.\nIn so doing, what the Pennsylvania legislature\ndetermined was that unless -- unless the prosecution was\nable to prove its case for death, that is, that\naggravating circumstances outweighed mitigating\ncircumstances, and was able to prove its case for death\nunanimously, then the outcome would be a life sentence.\nQUESTION: Mr. Dunham, do I understand that\nessentially what you are arguing is that we have here, to\nput it in simple terms, claim preclusion but not issue\npreclusion? You agree that this jury found nothing, so\nthat if the Pennsylvania law had been -- when the jury\ncomes in 9 to 3 or 7 to 2, whatever -- when it comes in\nthat way, that the Pennsylvania law had been new trial on\npenalty, you would have no double jeopardy claim. So\nyou're relying on the entry of a mandatory judgment for\nlife to effect basically claim preclusion, although you\nadmit there's no issue preclusion. That is, no issue has\nbeen found by anyone.\nMR. DUNHAM: There's no issue preclusion with\nrespect to aggravating and circumstance -- aggravating and\nmitigating circumstances, Your Honor, but what's clear is\nthat this jury had made a legally binding factual\ndetermination with respect to the issue of life or death,\nand --\nQUESTION: But this jury --\nQUESTION: But it --\nQUESTION: -- didn't do anything but say We\ncan't agree.\nQUESTION: Yes, they just hung.\nMR. DUNHAM: No, Your Honor. This jury did\nsplit 9 to 3.\nQUESTION: And its verdict had to be unanimous\nin order to have any effect, did it not?\nMR. DUNHAM: The verdict had to be unanimous for\nthe jury verdict to be imposed, but by operation of\nPennsylvania law, when -- the judge is then given the\nopportunity to make two predicate factual determinations,\nand if those predicate factual determinations are found --\nand those are determinations relating to whether or not\nthe State had proven its case -- then the judge must\nimpose a life sentence.\nQUESTION: Well, could the judge have imposed a\ndeath sentence here in view of a 9 to 3 verdict of the\njury?\nMR. DUNHAM: No, it could not, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Well, then, it seems to me when you\nsay Pennsylvania law says this and says that, as Justice\nKennedy just -- that's not what the supreme court of\nPennsylvania said. You've obviously got a constitutional\nargument here, double jeopardy, but I don't think you can\nshift it over and say, this is what Pennsylvania law says.\nMR. DUNHAM: The Pennsylvania supreme court --\nyes, Your Honor.\nThe Pennsylvania supreme court can say what the\noperative effects of the statute are, and what the\nPennsylvania supreme court has said the operative effects\nof the statute are is that when the jury is not unanimous,\nthen the judge must take a particular step, and that is to\nimpose the mandatory life sentence.\nQUESTION: Yes, I do think you can say that in\nthis case, there was a judgment that could have been final\nhad there been no appeal, and so therefore it's different\nfrom a hung jury case in some other instances where\nthere's just no determination at all, because after the\njury's failure to agree, the judge did impose a sentence\nthat might have become final, that looked final in many\ninstances, in -- from many perspectives. It turned out\nthat there was an appeal, but it could have been final if\nthere had been no appeal.\nMR. DUNHAM: Well, in fact, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: I mean, I take it that's part of your\ncase.\nMR. DUNHAM: Well, Justice Kennedy, what\nPennsylvania does is, Pennsylvania forecloses any appeal\nof the sentencing determination. When the defendant\nreceives a life sentence at the close of this trial-like\ncapital sentencing proceeding the State does not have\nauthority to appeal and, of course, the defendant has no\nreason to appeal because he has -- he's come out with a\nlife sentence.\nQUESTION: Can I ask you, do you know from the\nrecord in this -- does the record tell us in this case\nwhether or not this criminal defendant was advised of the\nrisk of taking an appeal?\nMR. DUNHAM: There is nothing in the record that\nindicates that he was advised of that risk. In fact, the\nrecord -- everything that we can see on the record, from\nthe record there is nothing that says anywhere that David\nSattazahn was told that if he took an appeal, he risked\nhis life, and in fact --\nQUESTION: Well, do Pennsylvania judges\nordinarily tell potential appellants what the consequences\nof an appeal will be?\nMR. DUNHAM: Well, Pennsylvania judges tell them\nwhat rights that they are waiving, so --\nQUESTION: By appealing?\nMR. DUNHAM: Yes, Your Honor. But -- But what\nwas --\nQUESTION: What sort of a colloquy would that\nbe?\nMR. DUNHAM: I --\nQUESTION: I mean, you know, I can see where a\ndefendant's being arraigned, or being advised whether or\nnot he should have counsel, there's that sort of a\ncolloquy, but --\nMR. DUNHAM: That's what I was thinking of, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nverdict comes in, there's no colloquy between the judge\nand the defendant, is there?\nMR. DUNHAM: No, Your Honor. There's a colloquy\nas to you have a certain number of days to file post\nverdict motions, you have the right to be represented by\ncounsel, and so forth.\nQUESTION: Could you --\nQUESTION: One of the things that we worry about\nin enforcing the Double Jeopardy Clause is the possibility\nthat without its protection, the State, in effect, could\nfail in its attempts and try again and again and again and\nagain. Is there any risk of that with respect to the\npenalty determination here?\nOn the face of it, it would seem that there\nisn't such a risk, because the only circumstance -- or the\nonly obvious circumstance -- in which the State could see\nthe -- seek the death penalty again is the one that we\nhave in this case, in which the defendant takes the appeal\non some underlying issue of guilt or innocence, and it's\nonly then, if he is successful, that the State would, on\nits view and on the Pennsylvania supreme court's view,\nhave another shot at getting the death penalty. Is there\nany greater risk of the State's being -- bringing\nrepetitive, making repetitive attempts to get the death\npenalty against a given defendant?\nMR. DUNHAM: Well, Your Honor, if the judgment\nis not a final judgment sentence, I don't see as a matter\nof double jeopardy jurisprudence what would prevent the\nState of Pennsylvania from then saying, for every other\ndefendant who had received a life sentence solely by\nvirtue of a split jury, why that would not be subject to\nfurther proceedings.\nQUESTION: Well, that's a question that\nultimately I intended to ask counsel on the other side,\nbut what's your position on it?\nMR. DUNHAM: I think that --\nQUESTION: If you lose, is that, in your\njudgment, the consequence?\nMR. DUNHAM: I think that's --\nQUESTION: That even in a case in which the\ndefendant does not appeal the underlying conviction, the\nState can say, we'd simply like to try again on penalty?\nIs that your position?\nMR. DUNHAM: Your Honor, under double jeopardy\nlaw, yes, I think that would be the risk --\nQUESTION: Well, is it a plausible position\nunder Pennsylvania law, because I -- and here I'm really\nat sea, but we've been told that the State has no appeal\nfrom the sentence. The State cannot go to the State\nsupreme court and say something was wrong in the\nsentencing proceeding and we should have another\nopportunity, so how would the State get its second choice?\nDo you think it would be inconsistent under\nState law for the State simply to go to the trial judge\nand say We'd like you to vacate that judgment insofar --\nor the verdict -- insofar as it calls for a life sentence\nand let us try again? Do you think that is open to the\nState under State law?\nMR. DUNHAM: I think the suggestion would be --\nthey certainly cannot appeal. That would be the manner in\nwhich it would be done if the State -- if the State --\nQUESTION: No, but is there any reason to\nbelieve that they could follow the course that I just\nsuggested, which would give them a repetitive opportunity?\nMR. DUNHAM: I would say as a matter of double\njeopardy, yes, there would be a reason to fear that.\nQUESTION: No, but I'm just asking a question of\nState law. Do you think the State law can be read in a\nway that would allow them to do that?\nMR. DUNHAM: Yes, Your Honor, I do.\nQUESTION: But how?\nQUESTION: I can't believe you would take that\nposition, that as a matter of State law the State can go\nin afterwards and seek a redetermination of the death\npenalty under Pennsylvania law.\nthe State can't appeal.\nMR. DUNHAM: I'm -- that's --\nQUESTION: Under what provision of State law\ncould the State go in and ask for it to be done in some\nother fashion? I'm startled by your answer, really.\nMR. DUNHAM: Well, Your Honor, I mean, I think\nit's unlikely that the State would do that, but I'm saying\nthat --\nQUESTION: We're just asking, as a matter of\nState law, how could it?\nQUESTION: The whole premise of your case is, as\nI understand it, is as a matter of Pennsylvania law, a\nsplit verdict has the same effect as a unanimous verdict\nfor life.\nMR. DUNHAM: That's right, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: So, let's -- let's --\nQUESTION: If that's true, then they certainly\ncan't go in and -- and ask for another trial.\nQUESTION: Let's go back for a second, can --\nQUESTION: So, you misspoke on that.\nMR. DUNHAM: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Could we go back to where we started\nthis whole discussion? I mean, I would like to suggest to\nyou that we're dealing with a kind of analogy, that the\nlaw in this entire area is a matter of analogy. We're\nanalogizing the penalty phrase of a death trial as if it\nwere a second trial.\nMR. DUNHAM: That's correct.\nQUESTION: So I take it your problem is that\nworking with analogy, there's quite a lot here that\nsuggests a hung jury, and there are some things that\ndon't, so if it's like a hung jury, of course, the Double\nJeopardy Clause doesn't bar it. If it's not like a hung\njury, then it does, so I'd like to ask you to say as\nconcisely as you can in terms of the purposes of this\nwhole area of law, why is it not like a hung jury?\nMR. DUNHAM: Yes, Your Honor.\nJustice Breyer, it's not like a hung jury first\nbecause in the hung jury cases, the jury fails to reach a\ndecision and, as a result, the trial court then\ndiscontinues the proceedings. A hung jury does not result\nin the entry of a judgment. In a hung jury situation, the\ncase gets sent back and the prosecution then has the\nopportunity to decide whether it's going to proceed with a\nretrial.\nThis is not a hung jury. It's not a hung jury\nbecause 1) it does not produce a mistrial, it produces as\na matter of law an entry of judgment, and that judgment is\na -- what we would say is a -- a judgment of acquittal.\nThe reason it's a judgment of acquittal is because this\nCourt has made clear in the context of Bullington, it's\nmade clear in the context of Rumsey, and even in Monje v.\nCalifornia and Casperri that there is something\nfundamentally different about a capital sentencing\nproceeding that has all the hallmarks of a trial of guilt\nor innocence.\nThere's something fundamentally different about\nthose proceedings from any other sentencing proceeding\nand, because of that, because a capital sentencing\nproceeding is the functional equivalent of a trial on the\nissue of life or death, and because the State has\nadditional burdens of proof, additional evidentiary\nrequirements, the sentencing phase is, in effect, the\nfunctional equivalent of a greater offense.\nBecause of these factors, when a defendant\nemerges from a capital sentencing proceeding, tried to\ncompletion, submitted to a jury and, after the\ndeliberations are done and the law operates, comes out of\nthis with a sentence of life, that life sentence is an\nacquittal of the death penalty.\nNow, because of that --\nQUESTION: You really are arguing for claim\npreclusion, because in the two juries -- the jury in a\nState that says, Okay, we do a retrial on sentence, and\nPennsylvania -- the two juries are doing an identical\nthing. You're giving it a different label because\nPennsylvania law precludes the claim, but the two juries\nhave done precisely the same thing, so -- and the\ndifference between this case and Bullington, of course, is\nthat there was a determination, a fact determination by\nthe fact-finder for life rather than death.\nMR. DUNHAM: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And so you can't equate those two\ncases, so you have to be relying on claim preclusion\nbecause a judgment has been entered.\nMR. DUNHAM: Well, but Your Honor, I think it's\nimportant to know what it is that the jury knew at the\ntime that it made its statement to the judge that it was\ngoing to -- that it was intractably split 9 to 3 in favor\nof life.\nWhat that jury knew, because it was told in the\njury instructions, was that there were certain\ncircumstances in which it could impose a death penalty.\nThere were two limited circumstances -- aggravating\ncircumstances and no mitigation, or aggravation that\noutweighed mitigation -- and in all other circumstances a\nlife sentence would be returned, so the jury is told that\nup front.\nThen the judge instructed the jury to take a\nlook at the verdict slip in the case, and the verdict\nslip -- which contained language in bold capital letters\nthat were mandated by the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal\nProcedure -- the verdict slip also told the story the same\nthings, and told the jury that if it could not reach a\nunanimous verdict, it was to report that to the court, and\nif the court found two facts, 1) that they were not\nunanimous and 2) that they were not going to be unanimous,\nthe court would have the duty to impose a life sentence.\nQUESTION: And that would go even if it had been\n1 for life and 11 for death, so you've repeated a few\ntimes the 9 to 3 for life, but it wouldn't make any\ndifference if it was lopsided the other way?\nMR. DUNHAM: That's correct. That's correct,\nYour Honor. But what's clear from this is that this jury\nknew when it was reporting back that a life sentence would\nresult, and what's also clear is the way the statute is\nwritten, the legislature has determined -- the legislature\nhas placed on the State the burden of persuading all 12\njurors that death is the appropriate punishment, that\naggravation outweighs mitigation. When the jury splits,\nthat is a fact finding that the State has not proven its\ncase to all 12.\nQUESTION: But it's not a fact finding by the\nwhole jury.\nMR. DUNHAM:\nthe jurors that the State has not been able to persuade\neverybody.\nQUESTION: Yes, that's true, but it's 9 out\nof 12, or 11 out of 1, whatever the case may be. It's not\nthe whole jury.\nMR. DUNHAM: Yes, Your Honor, but then again,\nYour Honor, as a matter of double jeopardy -- as a matter\nof constitutional law -- there's nothing magical about the\njury having to be unanimous. In fact --\nQUESTION: No, but there is something magical\nabout a jury, a unanimous jury making a determination, as\nwas the case in Bullington, where you don't just have a\nsplit in the jury, the whole jury comes back and says Yes,\nit's only life.\nMR. DUNHAM: But here the sentencer came back\nand said Because the State has failed to prove its case\nfor death, then the answer is life.\nThe Pennsylvania law sets for the circumstances\nin which the State has either proven or failed to prove\nits case for death, and --\nQUESTION: Mr. Dunham, maybe I'm\nmisunderstanding the Pennsylvania law, but I thought that\nthis position, we enter judgment of life, it favors\ndefendants. That is, the State is saying If nothing\nfurther happens we're not going to subject this defendant\nto the chance of getting death on a resentencing hearing.\nWe're going to give him life.\nOn the other hand, if he chooses to appeal from\nthe guilt part on, say, a charge error, as was the case\nhere, then we're no longer going to give him that benefit.\nWe did it on the notion that the thing would be over. He\nwouldn't be subject to death, but now he's taking, in\neffect, advantage of something we did to benefit him.\nMR. DUNHAM: Essentially, Your Honor, what\nyou're stating is the clean slate doctrine, and what --\nand I think it's critical, when we're categorizing the\ncases, to figure out which box this case goes in.\nThe clean slate doctrine applies when the\ndefendant has been convicted, and has been convicted of\nthe relevant charge. If it's true, as this Court has said\nin Bullington, and as this court has said in Rumsey, and I\nwould suggest, Your Honors, as it said in both Casperri\nand Monje, that there is this categorical distinction\nbetween capital sentencing proceedings and noncapital\nproceedings, and that what happens in a trial-like capital\nsentencing proceeding is that you have a separate trial on\nthe issue of the death penalty, then when you are\nappealing from your guilt stage conviction, you're\nessentially appealing from a lesser offense, and so, using\nas the analogy Green versus United States, you would not\nbe appealing -- you would not be placing the sentence at\nissue. You have won on the issue of sentence, so you're\nappealing a lesser offense.\nQUESTION: But apparently Pennsylvania has\ninterpreted its law differently on this point.\nPennsylvania would say, I gather, that if the defendant\ndoes appeal in these circumstances from his conviction,\nthat it's all open to the State to seek the death penalty\nagain. That's what Pennsylvania would say.\nMR. DUNHAM: But Pennsylvania can't --\nQUESTION: But you don't want us to hold that it\ncan say that. You want to say that the Federal rule\nshould come into play and prevent Pennsylvania from saying\nthat.\nMR. DUNHAM: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: May I ask you a question about --\nactually, two questions about Bullington? Is it not -- am\nI correct in recalling that in Bullington, the State had\nthe same -- the jury had the same two options, it either\ncould have found unanimously for the death penalty, or\neither unanimously or by a split verdict, it could have\nrefused to find the death penalty and the consequence\nunder Missouri law would have been the life sentence?\nMR. DUNHAM: That's correct.\nQUESTION:\nthat respect.\nMR. DUNHAM: That's correct.\nQUESTION: And is it also not true that in that\ncase, we can't tell whether the jury verdict was finding\nno aggravating circumstances, or a finding that no matter\nwhat the aggravating circumstances are, we're not going to\nimpose the death penalty?\nMR. DUNHAM: In Bullington?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. DUNHAM: Justice Stevens, in Bullington we\ncan take it one step further. In Bullington, we know that\nthe jury found at least one aggravating circumstance.\nQUESTION: And they -- so that their -- the\ndouble jeopardy did not rest on the fact there was a\nfinding of fact, but rather, there was an ultimate\njudgment that death is the inappropriate penalty?\nMR. DUNHAM: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. DUNHAM: Now, Your Honors, I'd like to make\na -- I'd like to just talk very briefly about the second\nissue and then reserve time for rebuttal. The\nCommonwealth has agreed that this statute -- the\nPennsylvania statute -- has created a liberty interest, a\nlife and liberty interest in the life sentence that was\nthe product of the nonunanimous jury.\nWhat we would like to -- the dispute between the\nparties is whether that life and liberty interest that the\nState concedes exists survives an appeal, and for all the\nreasons that we've talked about in the briefs, we would\nsay it does, because there is a special interest in\nfinality.\nThis Court has recognized in Bullington and in\nRumsey that capital sentencing proceedings -- and also in\nthe other, the noncapital cases we mentioned -- that one\nof the hallmark differences between a capital sentencing\nphase and a noncapital sentencing is precisely the\nexpectation in finality in the capital sentencing, and so\nthe defendant has a legitimate and substantial expectation\ngoing in that when he gets this life sentence, it is going\nto be a sentence that will remain with him.\nWe would say that Pennsylvania arbitrarily\ndeprives a defendant of this life and liberty interest if\nit conditions his appeal -- if it conditions the\nenforcement of that right -- upon giving up the right to\nappeal a lesser and distinctly different offense. It's\nconditioning the enforcement of his life sentence for --\nin this case -- upon his not appealing the lesser first\ndegree murder charge, and that's where we say it's\narbitrary.\nIf the Court has no further questions, I'd like\nto reserve the remaining time for rebuttal.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Dunham.\nMs. Dougherty, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF IVA C. DOUGHERTY\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. DOUGHERTY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn Bullington, this Court examined its holding\nthat the Double Jeopardy Clause does not apply to\nsentencing proceedings, and carved out a limited exception\nwhich was based on the findings made by a sentencer in a\ncapital sentencing proceeding. The exception does not\narise out of the proceeding itself. It arises out of\nthese findings, which distinguish it from a traditional\nsentencing procedure. This is the only conclusion which\nis consistent with existing double jeopardy jurisprudence.\nThe Court has never applied double jeopardy protections to\ntraditional sentencing procedures, because --\nQUESTION: It does seem a little odd that -- if\nyou have case 1, where there are no errors and the\ndefendant is not in any way prejudiced, and there is a\nlife sentence, that's final. But in this case, there was\na flawed trial, the defendant was prejudiced, but at this\npoint he now faces a greater sentence for having -- for\nhaving established the -- that prejudice.\nif we're going to give him the option, we'd say That's a\nrisk he takes, but it's a little troubling about your --\nMS. DOUGHERTY: Well, double jeopardy -- the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause doesn't preclude a defendant having\nto make choices in making a decision, and there's nothing\nfinal about the life sentence that's imposed by a default\njudgment under the Pennsylvania statute. It's no\ndifferent than any other sentence imposed at the end of a\ntraditional sentencing proceeding.\nQUESTION: Well, is it final if he does not\nappeal? I mean, just to clear up that issue upon which we\ngot an answer that surprised us from counsel on the other\nside, if he does not appeal, under Pennsylvania law, can\nthe State go, in effect, before the judge again and say We\nwould like to have another attempt to get the death\npenalty?\nMS. DOUGHERTY: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nQUESTION: Well, this is like -- it seems like\nBullington in one respect, and not like it in another.\nIt's not like it in the sense that there's a hung jury.\nIt's like it, however, in the sense that the person is\nfaced with a terrible choice. If he doesn't appeal, he'll\nlive. If he does appeal, he may die.\nNow, if that terrible choice is embodied in the\nreasons for an exception to the ordinary blank slate rule,\nthat exists here, so do you think that terrible choice has\nnothing to do with the exception whatsoever, or does it\nhave something to do with it?\nMS. DOUGHERTY: Under double jeopardy analysis,\nI don't believe it has anything to do with it. The\ndefendant also, upon appeal --\nQUESTION: Well, if it has nothing to do with\nit, why did the court create the exception? For, after\nall, ordinarily, as you pointed out, when a person a\nperson appeals his trial, he makes of his sentence a blank\nslate. It can be reopened. So why did the court say\noriginally that death sentences are different?\nMS. DOUGHERTY: Because the proceeding itself\nrequires a finding. It leads to a finding. It leads to\nan acquittal in a way that other traditional sentencing\nproceedings do not, and when someone has been acquitted of\nthe death penalty, then the State -- that would be\nprecluded by double jeopardy purposes for going back,\nbecause of the finality that attaches to an acquittal, not\nto the final judgment, not to a sentence that's imposed as\nthe result of -- that terminates a proceeding, certainly,\nbut it doesn't have that same finality that the court has\nalways accorded to an acquittal, and --\nQUESTION:\ndefendant faces when he's sitting at the table and he\nhears the verdict come in, he hears the verdict come in,\nno liability for the death penalty, the judge then\nsentences him to prison, and I had thought he would\nbreathe a sigh of relief. Under your position, no. In\nother words, he's faced the ordeal of -- of the trial,\net cetera.\nMS. DOUGHERTY: Exactly, and if he stops and is\nsatisfied with a life sentence instead of trying to get an\nacquittal, which is the result of possibly seeking another\ntrial, is that he could walk out of the courtroom an\ninnocent man on second trial. And that is a choice, but I\nbelieve under Chaffin this Court has not ruled out the\ndefendant having to make choices like that. No matter how\nserious, how tough the choice is --\nQUESTION: Can you -- can I interrupt with just\none question? Are there any other double jeopardy -- I\nmean, I don't -- are there any other hung jury situations,\nother than this very narrow category, in which the\nprosecutor does not have the option to go ahead and seek a\nsecond trial?\nSee, here you -- unless the defendant appeals, a\nprosecutor can't do anything about it here. Is there any\nother hung jury situation in which the prosecutor's hands\nare tied in that way?\nMS. DOUGHERTY: I believe the answer is no.\nQUESTION: I think that's --\nMS. DOUGHERTY: However, I think it's comparable\nto the guilty plea situation, where the Government could\nforego seeking death in order to -- for an agreement to\nlife, and the Commonwealth -- the State would not be able\nto appeal that imposition of the life sentence.\nHowever, if the defendant appeals and gets his\nsentence, gets his guilty plea withdrawn, the State would\nnot be precluded in that case from seeking death at the\ntrial. So I think the situation is along those lines.\nQUESTION: Well, but a hung jury is not quite\nlike a plea bargain, though. And that's what you're\ntalking about, isn't it? If the agreement is set aside,\nthen of course everybody starts from scratch, but not --\nbut when you've got a hung jury, normally the prosecutor\nhas the choice of whether to go ahead and retry or not.\nMS. DOUGHERTY: That's correct, Your Honor.\nHowever, the situation in this case, and the\nsituation for the exception in Bullington, revolved around\nthe findings by the jury, and it revolved around the idea\nof an acquittal, not a sentence, and that was pointed out\nfurther in Rumsey, where the Court talked about, the\nsentence was based on findings which entitled the\ndefendant to a life sentence, and again in Poland --\nQUESTION: Just -- let me ask just one more\nquestion, then I'll be through. I did not remember --\nyour opponent said that there was actually a finding of an\naggravating circumstance in Bullington. Was he correct on\nthat?\nMS. DOUGHERTY: I don't believe so, Your Honor.\nThere may have been a finding, but it may have been\noutweighed. I'm sorry, I don't remember that, but it may\nhave been outweighed by the mitigating --\nQUESTION: So there would have been eligibility\nfor the death penalty there.\nMS. DOUGHERTY: But the ultimate finding of the\njury was that they were -- that they acquitted the\ndefendant based on their weighing situation.\nAnd Poland further limited Bullington and\nspecifically talked about when there is not an acquittal,\nthen Bullington -- the Bullington exception does not\napply, and --\nQUESTION: Suppose we had a State with a system\nthat said, if any -- and I think some do have this\nsystem -- if any one juror votes for life, then the\nsentence shall be life. Suppose we had that system, and\nthe jury comes in and says, we're 11 to 1 for death. The\njudge enters judgment for life. In that case, if the\nguilt -- if it's an appeal from the guilt determination,\nand it's successful, then there wouldn't be -- there would\nbe no possibility of reopening the death-life decision,\nwould there?\nMS. DOUGHERTY: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I don't\nknow that that would qualify as an acquittal. That may be\na decision made by the State legislature, but the fact\nthat one person would hold out for life -- an acquittal\nis, traditionally has been looked at as a finding of\ninnocence, and a finding -- the court has generally\nrecognized it as finding innocence based on the evidence\nin the record, and it's based on -- the whole point of the\njury system is to reach a collective agreement, a\ncollective judgment by the community, and one person\nholding out for life does not possibly affect the\nconscience of the community on that sentence.\nQUESTION: So, you say it would make no\ndifference if, instead of in this case, where the legal\nconsequence following -- follows a jury disagreement, a\nState that says we make, in effect, each juror the\ndecisionmaker on the life-death question.\nMS. DOUGHERTY: I don't think that would still\nhave the finality of an acquittal under this Court's\ndouble jeopardy jurisprudence, and of course, the\nhypothetical doesn't apply in this situation, because\nthat's not what Pennsylvania said, but I don't believe\nthat one juror holding out for life could possibly garner\nthat finality that an acquittal has, and if -- I believe\nthere are certainly -- there might be -- there would be an\nargument in that case that if the defendant appealed,\nthat --\nQUESTION: Why not? If the State law sets up\nthat single juror in the same way that it sets up a single\njudge, if the trial is before the judge -- if the\nsentencing trial is before the judge?\nMS. DOUGHERTY: A State could do that. I just\ndon't believe that that legislative decision would have\nthe same finality as -- as an acquittal, because an\nacquittal is based upon a collective judgment of the\ncommunity on the ultimate question of --\nQUESTION: Well, do you think that that case\nthat I gave you, where the State law says one juror for\nlife is enough, and Pennsylvania, do you think there's any\nsignificant distinction between those two laws?\nMS. DOUGHERTY: I -- well, I'm sorry. I'm a\nlittle -- I'm not quite sure I understand your question.\nThere's a definite different in that Pennsylvania requires\na unanimous jury to reach a verdict, and therefore,\nPennsylvania is saying unless the jury -- all of the jury\nagrees -- then there is no verdict. There's no acquittal.\nThere's no conviction. It's a hung jury.\nI don't feel that I answered your question, but\nI'm not sure how to better answer it. I do believe that\nthere --\nQUESTION: I take it you do believe that there\nis a difference between those two situations.\nMS. DOUGHERTY: Well, there's a difference in\nlanguage. I don't know that there's a difference in\neffect, in the double jeopardy concept of acquittal, the\nfinality that should be accorded that judgment.\nThe -- Pennsylvania's position, of course, is\nthat without these findings made by a jury, that under\nBullington analysis, then double jeopardy would not bar\nretrial for the maximum sentence. You're right back at\nthe results obtained from the traditional sentencing\nproceeding. The imposition of a particular sentence, in\nthis case life, is not an acquittal of any more serious\nsentence that could have been imposed and, as this Court\nhas recognized in DiFrancesco as one example, the\npronouncement of sentence simply does not have the\nqualities of constitutional finality that attend an\nacquittal.\nQUESTION: May I ask -- I said I wouldn't ask\nanother question. I would like to ask one more. If the\njury in this case had been unanimous and said life rather\nthan death, would the judgment entered by the trial court\nhave been any different than the judgment it actually did\nenter?\nMS. DOUGHERTY: Life would have been imposed,\nbut it would have been imposed for a different reason.\nThe jury --\nQUESTION: Well, no, I'm asking, would the form\nof the judgment, the language used by the trial judge in\nentering judgment, would it have been any different from\nthe language it did use in this case?\nMS. DOUGHERTY: Well, it would have been based\non the unanimous verdict of the jury.\nQUESTION: That's not my question. My question\nis, the language of the judgment would have been any\ndifferent within the two cases?\nMS. DOUGHERTY: It would have been a life\nsentence in both cases.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nQUESTION: But you're saying that the Poland\nanalysis should make the result different.\nMS. DOUGHERTY: Yes, Your Honor. If there's no\nacquittal --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. DOUGHERTY: -- then Bullington doesn't\napply, and that's what would be different in the sentence.\nThere would be no acquittal.\nQUESTION: What happens, in your view, which --\nI'll be rather imaginary. I mean, there isn't a real\nsituation like this, but given the rulings of this Court,\nI think you could have a State -- at least not in my\nviews, but other's views, you could have a State which on\nsentencing left every question of fact to a jury, so they\ndecide every possible question of fact, but the ultimate\ndecision about what to do after those facts are found\nwould lie in the hands of a judge, and in a system like\nthat, where the judge then said life, would your argument\nstill apply, double jeopardy or not? Could they reopen\nit, or not?\nMS. DOUGHERTY: Well, the facts that need to be\nfound in a capital sentencing proceeding --\nQUESTION: Are very complex, but we have special\nforms and they go do it all. What I'm trying to say is, I\nwant a State still that turns over to the judge the power\nof life or death, and what the judge in such a State\ndecides is life, and now there is an appeal on the guilt\nand innocence phase. On -- in your opinion, can the State\nreopen that ultimate judgment which it put in the hands of\nthe judge? And you see, of course, why -- what my next\nquestion will be is, Why isn't this that State?\nMS. DOUGHERTY: My problem in answering the\nquestion, Justice Breyer, is I'm not sure what facts the\njury is --\nQUESTION: Everything you want. I mean, you\nknow, I'm just trying to avoid that question, so have\neverything you want, everything the Constitution requires,\neverything the opinions of this Court requires. What I'm\ninterested in is not that, but I'm interested in the State\nputting the sentencing decision in the hands of the judge.\nQUESTION: Well, here the judge who enters the\nverdict in this particular case does not do so because he\nconcludes that the circumstances -- he simply does it\nbecause the jury has come in 9 to 3, doesn't he?\nMS. DOUGHERTY: He comes in because -- that's\nright. He has no discretion.\nQUESTION: He doesn't exercise independent\njudgment.\nMS. DOUGHERTY: He has --\nQUESTION: No, but does that -- that's exactly\nwhat I'm trying to get at, exactly the question. I mean,\nis that what makes the difference? Because the State has\ntold the judge what to enter?\nMS. DOUGHERTY: Well --\nQUESTION: Rather than being discretionary, does\nthat make a difference for double jeopardy purposes?\nMS. DOUGHERTY: Well, I think it -- I think it\ndoes, and to go back to your hypothetical, my problem in\nanswering that question, if the jury, in fact, has found\nas fact that the mitigating circumstances outweigh the\naggravating circumstances, then I believe that would be an\nacquittal. If the jury's findings were made in that way,\nand the judge was -- the judge had to rely on those\nfindings in order to impose that sentence, then I believe\nthat that would be an acquittal, which would distinguish\nit from the case we have here.\nQUESTION: Why is that important? Why is it\nimportant for drawing a double jeopardy line that in the\nPoland situation a jury makes a unanimous determination,\nor in Justice Breyer's hypothetical, a judge that has the\npower makes the ultimate determination himself? If the\njudgment can otherwise be attacked on the underlying\nconviction, why should it make a difference for double\njeopardy on sentence that the judgment of life rests upon\nthese kinds of determinations rather than the operation of\nlaw which we have?\nMS. DOUGHERTY: Because an acquittal has\nalways -- the definition of acquittal has always been\nbased on a finding of innocence, on a finding that the\nState hasn't proved its case, and if there are no such\nfindings -- and that's why double jeopardy hasn't been\napplied to traditional sentencing proceedings, and if you\ndon't have those findings, then there's no basis to\njustify the acquittal, which would bar it under double\njeopardy.\nQUESTION: Were you going to comment in the time\nremaining on the second argument -- which I call just a\ndue process argument -- that it's just unfair to condition\nthe appeal on the possibility of a death sentence? Surely\nthe second argument --\nMS. DOUGHERTY: Well --\nQUESTION: -- made by your --\nQUESTION: Was this point raised in the supreme\ncourt of Pennsylvania?\nMS. DOUGHERTY: It was raised. It was never --\nit was raised. It was not specifically addressed in this\nfashion by the supreme court of Pennsylvania, but it was\nbefore the court to address.\nThe argument seems to be that somehow the\nsentence can be separated from the conviction, and I don't\nbelieve that's the case. Due process -- procedural due\nprocess requires notice and a meaningful opportunity to be\nheard. Mr. Sattazahn had that throughout these\nproceedings. Substantive due process, as this Court\nstated in Albright versus Oliver, it's reluctant to expand\nthis generalized notion of substantive due process, and\ntherefore, if there's a specific amendment that applies to\nthe States that addresses the issue, that's what should --\nthat's how the claim should be reviewed.\nIn this case, double jeopardy definitely applies\nto the States, and it seems that double jeopardy covers\nall the concerns that are raised in the defendant's due\nprocess and in petitioner's due process argument.\nTherefore, the only way that the defendant should not face\na clean slate on resentencing on retrial is the Bullington\ndouble jeopardy exception, not any due process claim.\nIf the Court has no further questions --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Dougherty.\nMr. Srinivasan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe question in this case is whether\nPennsylvania's imposition of a default sentence of life\nimprisonment by operation of law when the jury in a\ncapital sentencing proceeding is unable to reach a\nunanimous verdict constitutes an acquittal within the\nmeaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause. We think the\nanswer to that question lies in the settled rule that a\nhung jury is not an acquittal for double jeopardy\npurposes.\nDouble jeopardy law has always drawn a clear\ndistinction between hung juries, where the jury fails to\nreach a resolution of the case, and acquittals, where a\nunanimous jury makes a factual determination that the\nfacts in evidence fail to establish the defendant's guilt,\nor in this --\nQUESTION: May I ask how you would respond to my\nquestion about the State that has a system, any one juror\nwho votes for life, if there's any one juror, it's a life\nsentence, and this case? Is there a distinction between\nthose two for double jeopardy purposes?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Justice Ginsburg, we think\nthere is a distinction between those two. In the\nhypothetical statute that you posit, if the jury's\nresolution in favor of a life sentence were not considered\nto have final effect, that would strike at the heart of a\nvalue central to the Double Jeopardy Clause in that the\nState could then continue to reprosecute the defendant\nrepeatedly, so we think that in that hypothetical statute,\nwhen the jury comes back for a life sentence, I don't know\nif it's fair to call it an acquittal because an acquittal\nhas a settled meaning under the Double Jeopardy Clause,\nbut we think that determination would be accorded finality\nfor double jeopardy purposes.\nBut this case is different in a significant\nrespect. Here, Pennsylvania gave the defendant the same\nopportunity to obtain a final acquittal in his favor that\ndefendants traditionally enjoy on the underlying question\nof guilt or innocence, and that is that he could have\nobtained a unanimous verdict in his favor, and we think\nthat distinction is critical for double jeopardy purposes.\nQUESTION: Why should that distinction be more\ncritical than the so-called judgment distinction? In\nother words, in your -- I understand you to be arguing, as\nPennsylvania argued, that the line traditionally is drawn\nbased on whether there was an acquittal or wasn't an\nacquittal -- an acquittal versus a hung jury, but that\nline historically also is drawn, in fact, depending on\nwhether the jury's determination results in a judgment or\nnot. Here, we have a judgment. Why should we draw the\nline based on acquittal rather than drawing the line based\non judgment? There is a tradition for each.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Justice Souter, it's true that\nthe sentencing proceeding in this case culminated\nultimately in the entry of a judgment, but the fact of a\njudgment we think is not dispositive for double jeopardy\npurposes, and that's because the core premise of the clean\nslate rule is that the entry of a sentencing judgment is\nnot a double jeopardy disposition that bars the State from\nresentencing in the event of a retrial.\nevent of a judgment that makes the difference. It's\nwhether that judgment manifests the qualities of an\nacquittal. That's what Bullington holds.\nSo the question is whether the entry of a life\nsentence in this case manifests the quality of a factual\nacquittal, and we think it does not, because a hung jury\nhas never been thought to constitute an acquittal within\nthe meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause.\nQUESTION: Well, but it does constitute an\nacquittal of the death penalty if there's no appeal.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I don't think so, Justice\nKennedy, because the State can resentence in the event of\na retrial. It's true that the State has decided that it\nwon't appeal, but the operation of the clean slate rule\nworks such that when the defendant occasions a retrial by\nsuccessfully appealing his conviction and sentence, at\nthat point the State is free to conduct a resentencing and\nimpose a harsher sentence.\nQUESTION: If you win.\nQUESTION: That assumes the issue.\nQUESTION: I mean, that's the issue.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: If -- I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: I mean, you're right if you win, but\nyou're wrong if you lose.\nMR. SRINIVASAN:\ncourse that's correct, Justice Breyer, but I think the\nreason we should win is because the judgment that was\nentered in this case is not a factual acquittal of the\nnature that was considered --\nQUESTION: But, counsel, supposing the State law\nhad a provision in it that the votes of the jurors shall\nremain secret, and the only thing that shall become public\nis the judgment, what would you do in that case?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think in that case --\nit would depend on how the jury were instructed.\nQUESTION: Well, they're instructed just as they\nwere in this case. As a matter of protecting the privacy\nof the jurors, we're just not going to let the public know\nhow they voted, and that we just have a judgment out\nthere. What do you do in that case?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No, I think if the jury is\nrequired to make a unanimous verdict in either direction,\nand the judge imposes a sentence of life imprisonment\nbecause the jury has made a unanimous verdict, that would\nhave --\nQUESTION: No, it doesn't -- the \"because\"\ndoesn't follow, because you don't know on the record I'm\nhypothesizing.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think in that situation\nit would present some of the same difficulties that I was\ndiscussing in reference to Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical\nin that it's unclear whether the defendant would have --\nQUESTION: Well, I take it the judge probably\nknows in Justice Stevens' hypothetical what the jury did.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Right, and if the judge\narticulated it in his judgment in a way that distinguished\nbetween a judgment of a life sentence based on a unanimous\njury verdict and judgment of a life sentence based on --\nQUESTION: No, in my hypothesis he enters\nexactly the same judgment he entered here, and he just\nsays I'm -- let's close the files on this case so the\npublic won't know how the jury voted.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think in that situation\nwe'd have the same answer that we would to Justice\nGinsburg's hypothetical, which is that because the\ndefendant has not been afforded an opportunity to obtain\nfinality, then the double jeopardy law would treat that\njudgment as final, and the State would not be permitted in\nthat situation to revisit the sentencing judgment.\nBut this case is different in a significant\nrespect, because here, Pennsylvania law draws a\ndistinction between a unanimous jury verdict and a hung\njury that results in the imposition of a life sentence,\nand petitioner had the opportunity to obtain a unanimous\njury verdict, and, in fact, when the jury initially past\nits note to the judge indicating that it had reached an\nimpasse, petitioner immediately moved for declaration of a\nmistrial and discharge of the jury. And in that situation\nit's clear under double jeopardy law that when the\ndefendant invites the declaration of a mistrial and the\ndischarge of a jury, there's no double jeopardy\nprohibition against the State's conducting a retrial or,\nin this case, the State's conducting a new sentencing\nproceeding.\nQUESTION: But isn't the -- isn't the only\ndistinction in Justice Stevens' hypothetical between that\ncase -- the case that he posits -- and this one, the\nsecrecy. And I don't know why the secrecy should make a\ndifference, and I don't know why you don't answer by\nsaying, Look, what is necessary in order to implicate\ndouble jeopardy is the unanimous acquittal by the fact-\nfinder, and if the record does not manifest that unanimous\nacquittal, then, in fact, there would be no double\njeopardy bar to trying him on the sentence again. Why\nhasn't that got to be your answer?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Justice Souter, because it\ndepends on whether State law makes unanimity the deciding\ncriterion. If State law does --\nQUESTION: Well, but on Justice Stevens'\nhypothetical, it does not.\njust like this case except that there's a secrecy\nrequirement, so we don't know. And -- and all we know is\nthat yes, there ultimately was one or the other condition\nnecessary and sufficient -- sufficient, rather -- to\nsupport the judgment of life, but we don't know which one\nit was, and I would have thought that on your position you\nwould say unless it affirmatively appears that there was\nan acquittal by the unanimous jury, there would be no\ndouble jeopardy bar. Make it just like this case.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Our position is that if a State\nhas a unanimity requirement, the Double Jeopardy Clause\ndoes not preclude the State from enforcing that unanimity\nrequirement, but if a State draws no distinction between a\nunanimous jury verdict of acquittal and a one-juror vote\nfor the life sentence, then the Double Jeopardy Clause\nrequires the State to honor the finality of the judgment\nin favor of a defendant. That's our position in this\ncase.\nQUESTION: Is it fair to take into account,\nassuming competing analogies of equal weight, choosing the\none that would least discourage appeals? I mean, the real\nproblem here, I think, is the problem of a person having a\nmeritorious appeal, but being afraid to make it. So\ncan -- am I free to take that into account, at least, in\ntrying to choose between the analogies?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Justice Breyer, we think the\ndue process question in terms of undue burden was --\nwas --\nQUESTION: I'm not saying that -- due -- is that\nnot a factor that I can take into account in trying to\nchoose among competing analogies?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It's -- I think it's fair to\nsay that it's a factor, but I think it's important to note\nthat there are important reasons why a State would draw\nthe distinction drawn by Pennsylvania in this case. There\nare three reasons why a State might choose not to conduct\na resentencing in the initial round of proceedings, but\nnonetheless to resentence in the event of a retrial.\nFirst, as an interesting closure, the State\nmight determine that after a capital trial and a capital\nsentencing hearing, at that point, it makes sense to\naccept what is still a substantial punishment, the\nimposition of a sentence of life imprisonment, but if the\ndefendant occasions a new trial by successfully appealing\nhis conviction, at that point the balance of\nconsiderations changes.\nAnd in particular, in terms of the second\nreason, if a State were to conduct a new sentencing\nproceeding immediately after a hung jury in the initial\nround of proceedings, the sentencing jury would come to\nthe new sentencing proceeding without having had the\nbenefit of standing through -- of sitting through the\ncapital trial, and the State might reasonably conclude\nthat at that point, it would have to retry much of the\nunderlying case on guilt or innocence.\nBy contrast, when the defendant occasions a new\ntrial by successfully appealing his conviction, the State\nwill have selected a capital jury to conduct the trial,\nand the new capital jury will come to the sentencing\nproceeding entirely familiar with the facts and\ncircumstances of the case.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Srinivasan.\nMr. Dunham, you have three minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT B. DUNHAM\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DUNHAM: Your Honors, I would just like to\nmake a couple of points in rebuttal.\nThe first issue I'd like to address is the\nquestion of the State's interest in closure, and the\npolicies, the way the double jeopardy policies work out in\nthis statute in this case. What Pennsylvania --\nPennsylvania's statute as it's written recognizes several\ndifferent interests. One of the interests it recognizes\nis the interest in economy, the interests in finality, the\ninterest in giving the State a single opportunity to try\nand obtain a death penalty.\nOn the other hand, it balances this against what\nthis Court has in the past said is a desirable goal of\ntrying to achieve jury unanimity. So it has a preference\nfor a unanimous jury, and it balances that against the\nfinality of the sentence. And that's why the judge is\nrequired, when the jury comes back and says that it is not\nunanimous, why that judge is then required to see if\nfurther deliberations are going to be fruitful.\nWhen the judge determines that the jury is not\nunanimous, and determines that the jury is not going to\nbecome unanimous, that represents a decision at that point\nthat the interest in finality, imposing the life sentence\nnow and ending it, outweighs the interest in obtaining a\nunanimous jury. And that is -- and that triggers, that\nties into this Court's long-term double jeopardy\njurisprudence that one of the primary interests is against\nsubjecting a defendant to multiple trials, forcing him to\nrun the gamut of a second capital sentencing proceeding\nafter the first has been tried to completion.\nOn another issues, Your Honors, one of the\nthings that I would suggest as a possible structural way\nof looking at capital sentencing cases to see whether\nthere is a sensible way of determining whether or not what\nyou have is an acquittal is this.\nCourt talked about the binary choice between life or\ndeath, and the significance of that when you have a trial-\nlike proceeding, in distinguishing between whether it's an\nacquittal or a conviction, so there's a binary choice.\nWhat the Pennsylvania statute has done is create\na second binary choice, only it's a procedural one. If\nthis were a hung jury like what you see at trial, the jury\nhas three options. They can acquit, they can convict, or\nthere's limbo. The hung jury in the case goes back.\nThe Pennsylvania legislature has determined that\nthere is a second binary choice -- a procedural choice --\nand that is, unless there is a conviction, a life sentence\nis entered, and by eliminating that third category, it has\nmade the determination that any failure by the State to\nprove its case to a unanimous jury constitutes an\nacquittal, so I would say that the second binary choice,\nthe procedural choice, is a bright line way of saying\nwhether or not there is an acquittal. And a bright line,\nI think, is what Bullington and Rumsey stand for --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you. Thank you,\nMr. Dunham.\n"
