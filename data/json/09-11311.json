        "content": "(10:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Case 09-11311, Sykes v. United\nStates.\nJustice Ginsburg is not on the bench, but\nwill participate in the argument through the transcripts\nand -- and the tapes.\nMr. Marsh.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM E. MARSH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. MARSH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Armed Career Criminal Act enhances the\npunishment for possession of a firearm or ammunition for\na person who has three previous convictions for a\nviolent felony. This case involves, as you know,\nvehicular fleeing, which Indiana has divided into five\ncategories. Indiana statute treats vehicular fleeing as\na continuum of behavior ranging from merely failing to\nstop, on the low end, which is the crime Mr. Sykes was\nconvicted of violating, all the way to fleeing which\nresults in the death of a police officer, on the high\nend, which in Indiana is a class A felony.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's in between?\nMR. MARSH: The second tier up is what we\nrefer to as (b)(1)(B), which is fleeing which either\ncauses bodily injury or creates a substantial risk of\nbodily injury. The next category up is fleeing which\ncauses serious bodily injury. The fourth category is\nfleeing which causes a death.\nThis Court recognizes -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So we can assume that the\nconviction here did not involve any risk of bodily\ninjury to anybody?\nMR. MARSH: That's our position, Your Honor.\nWhen the court considers the conduct encompassed by the\nelements of the offense -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. MARSH: -- then that conduct does not\ninvolve conduct which creates a risk of bodily injury.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why is that -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm sure you'll do so in\nthe course of your argument, but at some point give us\nsome examples of violations of -- of this -- this\nstatute which from a commonsense standpoint don't\ninvolve a serious risk. There was something in the\nbrief about, oh, well, the defendant might want to just\nfind a safe place to pull over. I -- I didn't follow\nthat because it's an intent crime. I just don't see how\nthat would be a violation. But if at some point in your\nargument you could address those points.\nMR. MARSH: Well, I'd be happy to respond\nnow, Justice Kennedy. The court -- the case that you\nreferred to is the Indiana case of Woodward, from the\nIndiana Court of Appeals, in which the court held that\nexactly that conduct did violate this statute because\nthe -- knowingly or intentionally, the mens rea element,\ngoes only to fleeing and using a vehicle. So that was\none example -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Looking -\nMR. MARSH: -- of merely failing to stop.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Looking\n-- looking -- I don't mean to interrupt your answer, but\nlooking for a safe place to stop violates the statute?\nMR. MARSH: That was the holding of the\nIndiana Court of Appeals, yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You're supposed to stop\ndead in your tracks and not pull off on the shoulder? I\nmean, I don't -- I just don't understand this. I'll go\nread the case, but -\nMR. MARSH: Well, the court didn't -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't drive in Indiana.\nI think that's pretty tough.\nMR. MARSH: The court did not elaborate,\nYour Honor, on where the line is, but -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Maybe that's why -- why\nit's a risk. You stop in the middle of the road and\nthen everybody -\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MARSH: That would be more likely to\ncreate a risk, but the whole -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How can you say somebody is\nfleeing? I mean, doesn't fleeing mean you're trying to\nescape the -- the officer?\nMR. MARSH: Justice Scalia, the holding of\nthe Indiana Court of Appeals was in response to a\nposition taken by the defendant, sort of along the lines\nof the two lines of questioning, which is surely the\nstatute requires something more than merely failing to\nstop, but the Indiana Court of Appeals used precisely\nthat language. It -\nJUSTICE ALITO: I think the problem with\nyour argument is that the prosecution is not under any\nobligation to charge any offense greater than the\noffense for which your client was convicted in a case in\nwhich there is a very grave risk created by a flight.\nIsn't that true?\nMR. MARSH: The prosecutor is not under any\nobligation; was that the question, Justice Alito?\nJUSTICE ALITO: Yes.\nMR. MARSH: Yes, I think that's -- I think\nthat's correct. The prosecutor -\nJUSTICE ALITO: So you -- the fact that\nsomeone is convicted of this offense does not show that\na broad category of offenses within this crime lack the\nrisk that's necessary under the Armed Career Criminal\nAct.\nMR. MARSH: Well, I suggest that it does,\nYour Honor, because the -- the James case makes clear\nthat the court will determine whether the crime creates\na serious potential risk of physical injury to another\nby looking at the conduct encompassed by the elements of\nthe offense. Now, the fact that some other offense\nmaybe could have been charged or was charged, I suggest,\non the categorical approach is not relevant.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Are you familiar with the\ncase called Hape v. State, Indiana Court of Appeals\n2009?\nMR. MARSH: Tate versus -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Hape. H-a-p-e.\nMR. MARSH: I'm not, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: During a 45 -- and this\ninvolved the offense at issue here. During a 45-minute\nhigh-speed chase, officers shot at the defendant's truck\nat least 20 times. The State's facts showed that the\ndefendant drove over 100 miles an hour and at times\ndrove into the oncoming traffic lane.\nDo you think that creates a -- a serious\npotential risk of -- of harm?\nMR. MARSH: Well, those, of course, aren't\nthe facts here. And I would have to know what the\nindividual was convicted of, because, of course, under\nthe categorical -\nJUSTICE ALITO: I believe he was convicted\nof the same offense as -- as Mr. Sykes.\nMR. MARSH: But, of course, under the\ncategorical approach established by Taylor and followed\nconsistently by this Court since that time, the court\ndoesn't look at the facts of the individual case. The\ncourt looks at it categorically. So if the -\nJUSTICE BREYER: But looking at it\ncategorically, I've always thought, means you look to\nsee not just what the elements are on paper, but whether\nthe elements as -- as used in reality in the State are\napplied to cases that do present -- in general, you\napply it to cases that do present a serious risk of\nphysical injury. And you'd think the answer is we don't\nknow because no one's gone and looked. You could do it\nthrough sampling, but no one's gone and looked. I've\njust said that's my view of it.\nThe -- the -- so what do we do? I mean, I\ncan deal with a lot of other States, but Arizona has\nexactly the same classification of felony when you use a\nvehicle and when you use a vehicle creating a serious\nrisk of physical harm to others. It's in the same\nprovision, same statute, same category. How do we work\nwith that, in your opinion?\nMR. MARSH: If the -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Are you following what I'm\ndoing? You understand the difference between Arizona\nand 46 other States?\nMR. MARSH: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: In the other States, they\ngrade it. But here they don't.\nMR. MARSH: Right. Well, Indiana, of\ncourse, does grade it, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Indiana -- I'm sorry.\nMR. MARSH: And it is significant that the\nsecond most serious category is where the conduct does\npresent a substantial risk of bodily injury.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And I -- I don't know how\nwe could proceed by looking at, you know, whether in\nfact a majority of the cases that come into this first\nrelatively harmless category did indeed involve\nsituations that involved physical risk because, as\neverybody knows, prosecutors plea bargain, and it's\nprobably very often the case that the defendant is\ncharged only under -- under category 1, where, you know,\nif he went to trial, they'd charge him under 3; isn't\nthat so?\nMR. MARSH: But, of course, Your Honor -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, yes. You want to say\n\"yes.\"\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MARSH: Thank you. Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I still -- look, what\nI'm thinking of -- and I need a little explanation -- we\nlook to see in (b), and it says it's a class D felony if\na vehicle is used. That's (A) under (1). Am I right?\nMR. MARSH: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Then we look to (B)\nunder (1), and it's also a class D felony -- in other\nwords, the same -- if a vehicle is operated in a manner\nthat creates a substantial risk of bodily injury.\nMR. MARSH: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So a prosecutor looking at\nthat will say: Why don't I just charge (A); what's the\npoint of charging (B)?\nI mean, it makes no difference apparently.\nIt's simpler to prove (A).\nMR. MARSH: Justice Breyer, in 2003, when\nMr. Sykes was convicted of this offense, what you said\nis exactly right. Of course, we have no way of knowing\nthe motivation of prosecutors generally, let alone in\nthis case. And it wouldn't really matter what it was in\nthis case, what it is generally. But I think it's\nsignificant that in 2006 the Indiana General Assembly\namended that statute so now the (B) violation carries\nwith it a mandatory jail sentence, 60 days.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I can deal with it more\neasily then, at least I have -- but what's worrying me\nnow is what we're supposed to do is: Is the offense an\noffense that presents a serious risk of physical injury\nto another?\nMR. MARSH: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So we're here trying to\ndecide whether the (A) one does.\nMR. MARSH: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the answer is I don't\nknow, and the reason I don't know is I don't know how\nthat offense language of (A) is applied in Indiana.\nMR. MARSH: If the -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, do you know if\nIndiana has an enhancement for convictions, sentencing\nenhancement of any kind, for convictions that have an\nelement of -- of risk of harm to others?\nMR. MARSH: Your Honor, there are a number\nof habitual sentencing enhancements, one of which\nspecifically relates to driving. I can't say that it is\nbased on substantial -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it's possible that\nthere is a -- there's a use of the difference between\nthe two categories that might not be implicated in this\ncase but may lay the foundation for an enhancement\nlater?\nMR. MARSH: Yes. Now, that's a good point,\nJustice Sotomayor. The -- the enhancements generally in\nIndiana relate to previous convictions, and so I can't\nsay for sure, but it's entirely possible that (B),\n(b)(1)(B), would be a predicate crime for a habitual\ntraffic offender, which is what it's called.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In your brief, you take\nissue with the Government's definition of \"aggressive,\"\nbut would you give us yours?\nMR. MARSH: Well, Your Honor -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How would you define it\nand on what basis?\nMR. MARSH: Your Honor, the best definition\nof \"aggressive\" that I've seen was in the First Circuit\nopinion in the Herrick case, which is cited in our\nbrief, which the First Circuit refers to as forceful\naction, especially where intended to dominate or master.\nBut on general everyday language, it strikes\nme that when a law enforcement officer wants somebody to\nstop, whether they're in a vehicle or not, the fight or\nflee sort of comes into play. And the person who\nresponds by going toward the police officer and\nresisting in that way, which is the first part of this\nIndiana statute, would be acting in an aggressive way.\nThe person who flees is not acting in an aggressive way.\nThey're trying to avoid the confrontation. They're\ntrying to get away from the law enforcement.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Marsh, I take it that\nyou would agree that (b)(1)(B) is a violent felony\nunder -- under ACCA; is that right?\nMR. MARSH: Your Honor, it may very well be.\nIt certainly would satisfy the risk element, similar in\nrisk to the -- to the Begay case. I think it would\nstill have to be decided whether it's violent and\naggressive, but it may very well be.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, if we think that\n(b)(1)(B) is a violent felony under ACCA, and we know\nthat (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) can receive the same\npunishment, that they're both classed as a class D\nfelony, why should we make the distinction between the\ntwo under ACCA?\nMR. MARSH: Your Honor, I would suggest\nbecause the Indiana General Assembly has decided in\nenacting this legislation that some vehicular fleeing\npresents a substantial risk of bodily injury to another\nand some doesn't, and they've drawn this distinction.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I presume that if -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But these are not nested\noffenses. These are not -\nMR. MARSH: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE KAGAN: These are not lesser\nincluded offenses. Each has an element that the other\nlacks, and both are classed with -- apparently that the\n-- that the State thinks of them as equally severe. And\nif one is a violent felony under ACCA, there's an\nargument that the other should be treated in the exact\nsame way.\nMR. MARSH: Your Honor, I would suggest that\nthe State doesn't treat them as equally severe. The\nrange of punishment for a class D felony, which both of\nthose crimes are, is all the way from zero to 3 years in\nprison, and the actual conduct undoubtedly is a factor\nin what the person's ultimate sentence will be.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And it may well be that in\ndeciding whether to accept a plea bargain of being\nguilty of (A) rather than going to trial on (B), if your\nclient has two violent felonies already on the book, you\nmight take -- take the plea bargain under (A) lest you\nrun afoul of the violent felony act.\nMR. MARSH: Yes, Your Honor, that's, of\ncourse, entirely possible. But, again, just as with the\ncategorical approach the court cannot take into account\nthe motives of prosecutors, I would suggest the motives\nof defendants and defense lawyers can't be taken into\naccount, either. Further, I think it's more important\nthat when Indiana enacted this statute, it was not\nthinking of ACCA and predicate crimes, I -- I assume. I\ndon't think the legislature takes those kind of things\ninto account.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Suppose the legislature were\nto repeal (b)(1)(B). Would the offense for which Mr.\nSykes was convicted then become an ACCA offense?\nMR. MARSH: Your Honor, I -- that would be a\nquestion that would have to be decided on the basis of\nwhether there's some basis to -- well, first of all,\ndetermine whether it's violent and aggressive. And my\nposition would remain it's still not violent and\naggressive. But even on the second part of the Begay\napproach, this Court has not seen anything that gives\nyou any basis for knowing what the risk of injury is.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand your\nanswer to that question. I would have thought that your\nanswer, if you're insisting on a categorical approach,\nwould be \"no,\" that there's nothing in -- in (3) that\nrequires any violence at all. Just fleeing by visible\nor audible means, just -- just flees. That's all it\nsays.\nMR. MARSH: I'm sorry. I understood the\nquestion to be that (A) is repealed and (B) is left in\nplace; was that -\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, it's the opposite. If\nthe aggravated offense -- you rely on the aggravated\noffense -\nMR. MARSH: Right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- in large part as a basis\nfor your argument.\nMR. MARSH: Right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Your argument -- one of your\nmain arguments, as I understand it, is that -- what I'll\ncall the simple offense doesn't qualify under ACCA\nbecause cases involving a serious risk of bodily injury\nfall under the aggravated category. And my question is\nwhether a repeal of the aggravated offense would change\n-- would then convert the simple offense from a non-ACCA\noffense to an ACCA offense. Or you could ask it a\ndifferent way. If State 1 has the simple offense and\nthe aggravated offense, State 2 has just the simple\noffense, is the simple offense an ACCA offense in one\nState and not in the other State even though the\nelements are exactly the same?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's a good question.\nMR. MARSH: Your Honor, the equation would\nbe different because of the significance of the (B)\noffense. So that's not exactly our case. But I will\nadopt Justice Scalia's answer, which I think is exactly\nright. I -- it still would not be something that's\nviolent or aggressive.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But you're -- you're\nanswering my question by making a totally different\nargument. Insofar as you're relying on the aggravated\noffense, the presence of the aggravated offense, I would\nappreciate an answer to it.\nMR. MARSH: Justice Alito, the -\nJUSTICE ALITO: In other words, you're\nsaying -- maybe I haven't made myself clear. You're --\nJustice Scalia's answer, which you have adopted, is that\nif you look at (A) by itself, forget about the\naggravated offense completely; it doesn't qualify under\nACCA. And that's -- that's one argument.\nBut your -- your other argument is that (A),\nthe simple offense, doesn't qualify because of the\npresence of (B). And I'm trying to see whether that\nmakes sense.\nMR. MARSH: Yes, Justice Alito, I think it\nbreaks down to the two parts of the Begay test. In\norder to be a violent felony, it has to be similar in\nkind and similar in degree of risk.\nThe existence of (B) makes clear that the\ndegree of risk for violating (A) is not the same,\nbecause if you accept the continuum of behavior as\ncreated by the Indiana General Assembly, the person\nwho's convicted of (A) has not created a substantial\nrisk of bodily injury. It's -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, have you done\nor looked at -- not every burglary has a risk of harm to\nanother or results in harm to another. The general\ndefinition of burglary is entering without permission\nand intent to commit a crime, and generically the crime\ndoesn't have to be physical injury to others.\nMR. MARSH: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yet, ACCA defines\nburglary as a qualifying crime of violence. It's\nmeasuring risk, not by the elements of that crime, but\nby something else, by some measure of incidents in which\nviolence might occur.\nSo how is that different than the\nGovernment's argument here and the question that Justice\nBreyer asked you, which was: It is true, potentially\nthere's some forms of fleeing that might not pose a risk\nof injury, but statistically there's a large number of\nincidents in which violence follows.\nSo, how is that different than burglary?\nThat's really my question. What -- it can't be that the\nelements have to pose a risk of injury, because burglary\ndoesn't do that. So, what -- how do we measure it?\nMR. MARSH: Your Honor, the inquiry, as the\nCourt said in James, is whether the conduct encompassed\nby the elements of the offense presents the risk. And\nthat's the -- the determination that the court has to\nconsider.\nIt's not -- it is not necessary, and I'm not\ncontending, that this crime is a violent felony only if\nevery conceivable violation of the statute constitutes a\nrisk of danger. That -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So if you're not doing\nthat, that's my question: Where do we draw the line?\nMR. MARSH: You draw it -- I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Where do we draw the\nline?\nMR. MARSH: You draw the line -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I think that was what\nJustice Breyer was trying to ask you earlier, which is:\nWhen do we say that, as in burglary, that some risk is\nmore likely to follow than not in a particular type of\ncrime?\nMR. MARSH: Well, the line is defined by the\nstatute: Serious potential risk of physical injury to\nanother.\nNow, how do you make that determination?\nWell, the Court made clear in Chambers that empirical\ndata is one way to do it. There isn't any here because\nof all the empirical data presented by the Government.\nIt relates to vehicular fleeing as if there was one\ncrime of vehicular fleeing, and most of it is -- is\ncalculated based on death or injury, and that, of\ncourse, is not the category that we have here. If -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose that if we agreed\nwith you that whether it is a violent crime depends upon\nwhat other prosecutions for fleeing could have been\nbrought. If we agree with you that (1)(A) is negligible\nbecause there are other bigger ones for which he wasn't\ncharged, we could leave open the question of what -\nwhat happens in a State that has only one crime for\nfleeing, and we would -- then we would have to confront\nthe question that Justice Sotomayor has asked.\nBut if we accept your notion that -- where\nyou have a gradation that is adopted by the State, the\nlowest gradation cannot be determined to have a high\npercentage of bodily risk, right?\nMR. MARSH: Yes, that's correct, Justice\nScalia.\nJUSTICE BREYER: My problem is there is\narguably not here a gradation.\nSuppose it only had (A). If it only had\n(A), for me -- I'm not saying for you -- this wouldn't\nbe a tough case. That is to say, I can't imagine a\nperson running away from a police in a car where there\nisn't a real risk to other people. He's speeding, you\nknow. I would think -- I don't see how you get away\nfrom the policeman unless you speed, and there are going\nto be pedestrians. Who knows? But I think that was\npretty -- at least as bad -- at least as much of a risk\nas burglary. So that would be the end of the case. It\nwould be simple. At least assume that.\nNow, then, however, suppose we have a State\nwhich says: But it's a worse thing to run away and\ncreate a risk. In a separate provision. It's a worse\nthing. All right? Then I'd say, huh, now I'm not so\nsure. Why didn't they charge the worse thing? This\nmust be reserved for cases where it isn't.\nSo here we have a rather weird situation.\nThey're saying it's a different thing but not a worse\nthing. So now I say: Well, why didn't they charge --\nHuh? Now I don't know. I don't know why they didn't\ncharge the separate special one. I don't know what the\nfacts are. I'm puzzled.\nNow, that's your case. That's where I\nneeded the enlightenment. So, what's the enlightenment?\nMR. MARSH: Your Honor, it's not a weird\nsituation, because the Indiana definition of the crime\nof vehicular fleeing is not one all-encompassing crime.\nIt's -- they took the all-encompassing generic vehicular\nfleeing and divided it into five subparts, which I\nsuggest makes it much easier to resolve the (b)(1)(A)\nquestion.\nIf there is no other categories, that would\nbe Justice Scalia's point, I think, and then it would be\na much harder question. And it may very well be that it\nwould be considered a violent felony. For one thing -\nJUSTICE ALITO: But isn't it still -- isn't\nit still an empirical question? If we were to look at\nall of the cases that are prosecuted under what I'll\ncall the simple offense, we might discover that those\nare all cases in which there is no serious potential\nrisk of physical injury created because all of the risky\ncases are prosecuted under the aggravated label.\nWe might also find that there are still a\ngreat many cases that involve a serious potential risk\nthat are prosecuted under the simple category. So the\nfact that there's a gradation doesn't allow us to escape\nthe empirical issue, does it?\nMR. MARSH: No, I think you're exactly\nright, Justice Alito. That would be possible.\nEmpirical data could show what you have just suggested.\nOf course, that would be indicating that the Indiana\nGeneral Assembly didn't have any rational basis for\ndividing the two, but the important thing here is -\nJUSTICE ALITO: I wouldn't say that they\ndidn't have a rational basis for dividing it. It would\njust show a pattern of prosecution and -- and plea\nbargaining. That's what it would show.\nMR. MARSH: But the important thing here,\nYour Honor, is there simply is no such data before this\nCourt. There -- there is no empirical data regarding\n(b)(1)(A).\nJUSTICE ALITO: There never is really\nreliable empirical data, almost never, for any of the\nissues that have to be decided under the -- the\ncatch-all, the residual clause, of ACCA. It has to be\nbased on basically common sense and experience, doesn't\nit?\nMR. MARSH: Your Honor, I suggest that\ncommon sense and experience is not a reliable,\npredictable way of deciding these cases. You're right,\nthere frequently is not empirical data. If there's not\neither empirical data that demonstrates the danger\ninvolved or a crime that -- where the danger is pretty\nobvious so that there would be widespread general\nagreement -- common sense is what has led to a lot of\nthe conflicts in the circuits, I would suggest.\nMay I reserve my time, Your Honor?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nMarsh.\nMr. Wall.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. WALL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nJust a very quick moment of history, I\nthink, provides some useful background, and I'm on\npage 3a of the appendix to the Government's brief.\nUntil 1998, subsection (B), which we've been talking\nabout, was the only class D felony that involved\nvehicular flight in Indiana law. In 1998, the Indiana\nGeneral Assembly broke out and enacted subsection (A) so\nthat in cases of vehicular flight prosecutors would not\nhave to prove risk; they would just have to prove that\ndefendant used a vehicle.\nSince 1998, I have found 14 cases in the\nIndiana Court of Appeals, one of which is the Hape case\nthat Justice Alito cited earlier. All of them, so far\nas I can tell, proceeded under (A) and not under (B).\nOf those 14 cases, 13 have enough facts to tell what the\nflight was -- of what kind; 10 involved speeding,\ndisregarding traffic laws, or striking an officer with a\nvehicle. Of the other three, only one involved\nnon-risky behavior, and even that was not a defendant\nwho drove a short distance and then pulled over. It was\na -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: These were all litigated\ncases?\nMR. WALL: Yes, Justice Scalia, these were\nall litigated to conviction and taken up on appeal, and\nthe Indiana Court of Appeals addressed various legal\nissues -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that's not\n-- 14 isn't very many. And I assume the vast majority\nof these cases aren't litigated.\nMR. WALL: I think that's right, Mr. Chief\nJustice. The Government's point is that here we have\nextensive data, both empirical and otherwise, that\nindicates that flight as a basic offense is very\ndangerous. In -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I read your\nbrief, and I was -- I read your brief and was surprised\nthat when you're -- the list -- one of the things you\ntalk about to show that is media reports. You usually\nhave a more concrete basis for -- for speculation than\nmedia reports.\nMR. WALL: Mr. Chief Justice, if that is all\nwe had put forward, I might agree with you, but we also\nput forward extensive statistical data.\nMy point is just that Indiana is typical.\nIt's dangerous everywhere else. It's four times as\ndangerous as arson. It's more dangerous than household\nburglary. There's nothing different about Indiana. If\none looks through these cases, these flights in Indiana\nare typically quite dangerous.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose you have a State\nthat has a separate crime for trespassing, criminal\ntrespass. And you're saying that if -- if you could\nshow that a large number of cases that were brought\nunder criminal trespass in fact could have been\nprosecuted under burglary, then criminal trespass would\nqualify as a -- as a violent felony. That doesn't seem\n-- that doesn't seem to me right.\nMR. WALL: Justice Scalia, I thought -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Just because prosecutors\nmake that choice, that doesn't establish that the\nelements of the crime, which is what we focus on in\ndeciding whether it's a violent felony, fill the bill.\nMR. WALL: That's right. This Court looks\nat the conduct encompassed by the elements in a typical\ncase. And in a typical case of vehicular flight, what\nwe have, according to the data, is someone fleeing\npolice at an average of 25 miles an hour over the speed\nlimit; someone who is, in a typical case, young, male,\nunlicensed, under the influence of alcohol; and who\nplaces the lives of other motorists, pedestrians, and\npolice in harm's way.\nYour approach to ACCA, Justice Scalia, has\nbeen to look at the conduct encompassed by the elements\nand ask whether the risk from that conduct is at least\nas great as the -- the least risky enumerated offense.\nAnd here -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That ignores the in-kind\nrequirement of Begay, because you seem to be confusing\nthe risk of violence with the in-kind inquiry, and\nthat's where I'm trying -- I'd like you to concentrate a\nlittle bit on, which is in burglary the defendant is\nbreaking into, generally, a place and going without\npermission, and -- with an intent to commit a crime.\nHow is that comparable to merely not\nstopping when a police officer tells you not to stop?\nHow is that an in-kind -\nMR. WALL: Justice Sotomayor, it's\nabsolutely true, there are two parts to the test, and\nwe've been talking about the first risk. On the second\nprong, the purposeful, violent, or aggressive character\nof the conduct -- here I think there are three distinct\nthings that make it purposeful, violent, and aggressive.\nFirst, you have the defiance of the\nofficer's order, which can cause injury at the scene.\nIt has in some Indiana cases, but at least called the\nofficer to give chase.\nSecond, you have the very real prospect -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What you're doing is\nsaying I'm not -- you're not even saying I'm not\nstopping; you're just driving away.\nMR. WALL: Well, yes, but you are driving -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, how is that\naggressive -\nMR. WALL: You're driving away in response\nto an officer's command to stop. You're calling the\nofficer to give chase. You're -- you're -- pursuit is\nlikely. And even when there isn't pursuit, these\noffenders drive typically very recklessly, and then\nyou've got the confrontation when the officers have\nto -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's the risk\nof -\nMR. WALL: -- terminate.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That -- that is all the\nrisk question, and you're confusing the police actions\nwith the defendant's, because you're talking about the\ndefendant responding to a police pursuit. So what -\nwhat is in the act of the crime that makes it in-kind to\nburglary?\nMR. WALL: So, let me analogize -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I concentrate on\nburglary because the others don't fit.\nMR. WALL: No, let me concentrate on\nburglary, then, and analogize it to what this Court said\nin James. It said the risk of attempted burglary -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: James -- James predated\nBegay. So you've got -\nMR. WALL: That's right, but I -- the Court\nhas talked about -- even in Chambers, about the risk of\na violent confrontation with law enforcement officials,\nand it's done that under the Begay part of the test.\nAnd whereas that confrontation is only possible with\nburglary, it's necessary with this crime. It requires\nthat an officer order you to stop and that you flee.\nSo that -- that confrontation, which is only\na possibility with burglary or attempted burglary, is\nelevated to a certainty with this offense.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Wall, wouldn't\nthat suggest that if I just ran from a police officer,\nit would be a violent felony under ACCA?\nMR. WALL: I think it -- it would suggest\nthat, Justice Kagan, but I think flight on foot is\nunlikely to satisfy the risk part of the test. I think\ncertainly this case is much easier on the -- the James\npart of this test. I think the -- the flight in a\nvehicle poses risks, very real risks, to other motorists\nand pedestrians and police that flight on foot doesn't\npose, although you'd still have the confrontation when\nthe flight on foot was terminated. So I think some of\nthe arguments would translate. You're right. I think\nthere would be more difficult questions, though, on the\nrisk prong. This is a much easier case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do -- do words mean\nnothing? I mean, we're talking about a violent felony.\nThat's what the Federal law requires. And -- and you\nwant us to hold that failing to stop when a police\nofficer tells you to stop is a violent felony. That -\nthat seems to me a -- a big leap. I mean, words have\nsome meaning, and Congress focused on violent felonies.\nMR. WALL: Justice Scalia, words do have\nmeaning, but the words here are very broad: \"serious\npotential risk of physical injury to others.\" And as\nyou yourself have recognized in -- in multiple opinions,\nwhat those words call for is a comparison of risk\nbetween an offense and ACCA's enumerated crimes.\nThis offense, simply put, is more risky.\nIt's four times as risky as arson in terms of injuries\nand fatalities.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, one of the -\nMR. WALL: It's more risky than household\nburglary.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Another word is\n\"aggressive\" in Begay, and that's where I have a little\ndifficulty with your argument. It seems to me, this is\nthe exact opposite of aggressive. He's running away.\nCertainly, the other option is to turn and confront, and\nhe doesn't want to. There's nothing aggressive about\nrunning away.\nMR. WALL: Well, there is, Mr. Chief\nJustice, when you're doing it in a vehicle, and\ntypically at high speeds. So, in Chambers -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's the\nrisk of violence, I understand that, and purposeful,\nwhich I guess everything is. But those are the three\nwords: \"purposeful, violent, and aggressive.\" I'll\ngive you purposeful, I'll give you violent, but\naggressive?\nMR. WALL: Mr. Chief Justice, if you give me\nthose two, I think we're home free, because this Court\nsaid -\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WALL: -- in Chambers -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think you're\ntwo-thirds of the way home free.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WALL: I'll take it, and let's work on\nthe last third. So the -- what this Court said in\nChambers is not all attempts to evade authorities are of\nthe same stripe. So, it contrasted escape from prison\nwith failure to report. Failure to report, you could do\nat home on your couch; you could just fail to show up.\nAnd the Court said: Look, that's passive; it's a crime\nof inaction.\nThis is not that. It's not sitting at home\non one's couch. This is quintessentially a crime of\naction.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's a\ndifference. The opposite of passive is active. It's\nnot aggressive.\nMR. WALL: Well, but -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is active.\nHe's running away, but -\nMR. WALL: I think -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's the\naggression?\nMR. WALL: But it's very -- it's hard to see\nwhat the difference would be between this and escape\nfrom custody. And this Court clearly indicated in -- in\nChambers that escape from custody was different from\nfailure to report under the statute in front of it. And\nI think this is as dangerous, maybe even more dangerous\nthan escape from custody.\nIf the Court were going to say that all\nrunning away could not be aggressive within the meaning\nof that word for Begay purposes, so too escape from a\nmaximum security Federal prison, which in some sense is\njust running away, but it is extremely aggressive, and\nit's extremely risky to others.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Wall, do you think that\nspeeding or drag racing qualifies under your\nunderstanding of the test?\nMR. WALL: Justice Kagan, that's a difficult\nquestion. I don't know that I've seen any attempt to\nfit that offense in under the ACCA. I think that drag\nracing, where you're talking about speeds of 150, 160,\n170 miles an hour, might qualify, but I haven't seen any\ncases like that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about speeding, just\n-- you know, you're going 15 miles over the speed limit?\nMR. WALL: I -- again, I -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that a violent felony?\nMR. WALL: Justice Scalia, I think then we'd\nhave a serious question about the first part of the\nanalysis and the -- the risk test. I mean, 10, 15 miles\nover -- I mean, speeding as a generic offense is likely\nto -- I mean, it encompasses categorically all speeding\noffenses, many of which are, you know, not that -- not\nlikely to pose a serious risk to others. So I -- I -\nwe'd have to look at the -- the data. What we do have\nhere is data that says this offense is four times as\nrisky as the enumerated offense of arson. So I -- I -\nspeeding would be a difficult case. So far as I know,\nwe -- the Government's never tried to make the case.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is speeding a felony?\nMR. WALL: Not as far as I know, not the\nbasic offense. Now, whether in a Begay-type sense you\nmight have some recidivism enhancement under State law\nthat would get you there, I don't know. But I -- again,\nI haven't seen any case that involved that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Am I right about -- when\nyou replied to Justice Scalia, I thought that he had\nsaid that we were dealing with a statute, and you seemed\nto agree, that said it is a crime to flee a policeman\nafter being ordered to stop. But I thought we were\ndealing with a statute that says it is a crime to flee a\npoliceman after being ordered to stop, in a vehicle.\nMR. WALL: That's right. That's right.\nThat's the offense here.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so you're -- okay.\nMR. WALL: It's the vehicular flight\noffense. And one -- you know, I will take one issue\nwith -- with -- you know, what my friend on the other\nside has said, which is (A) and (B) are not tiered.\nThey're not greater and lesser offenses under State law.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Wall, suppose they\nwere. I understand your point that they're not, and you\nmight be right about that. But let's suppose that they\nwere. Let's suppose you had a three-tier set-up. One\nwas simple flight; one was flight that causes risk of\ninjury; one that is a flight that causes injury. And\nlet's even say that the simple flight -- no, let's -\nlet's call them all felonies but different classes of\nfelonies.\nWhat would happen in that case? Would you\nstill be here saying that the simple flight felony is a\nviolent crime?\nMR. WALL: Yes. It's a tougher case, but we\nwould be here saying that, because when you're looking\nat an offense categorically -- for instance, arson -\nyou've got to look at all fires, all intentionally set\nfires, the ones that don't hurt anybody, the ones that\ndo, and the ones that kill people, even though the fires\nthat kill people will be prosecutable in most\njurisdictions as a greater offense, like felony murder.\nAnd so when you're looking at it categorically, you've\ngot to look at all of the conduct in that category, even\nconduct that may be prosecutable under some greater\noffense.\nI think, you know, the other side sort of\nrelies on this assumption that all conduct which might\nsatisfy the greater will necessarily be prosecuted under\nthe greater. And as a legal matter, it's included\nwithin the lesser, and as a factual matter, it's just\nnot true that it always gets prosecuted under that\ngreater offense.\nSo it's -- it would be a tougher case. It\nwould make our case more difficult, but I think legally\nand factually the Government's answer would be the same.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I -- I asked my clerk to\njust do a survey of the States, and he came up with -\nand I'm sure that this is rough -- but that 46 of the\nStates have these tiered systems. Now, there may be\nsome questions as to some of them, like you've raised\nsome questions about Indiana's, but that 46 States\nessentially conceive of this as two different kinds of\nconduct, one which is the violent kind and the other\nwhich is the not violent crime.\nMR. WALL: Well, my State law research is a\nlittle different from your clerk's. I've got 37 States\nand D.C. But the -- the point is that under the nested\nstatutes, the aggravator isn't always like this one,\nrisk. Sometimes it's, as in Indiana, injury or death.\nAnd where you're talking about actual injury or death,\nthose aggravators far outstrip the level of potential\nrisk that ACCA requires.\nSo I don't think in those States Petitioner\nwould give an argument that those aggravators would\naffect at all the analysis of the basic offense. There\nare a handful of States that, unlike Indiana, have as an\naggravator risk, though even some of those States treat\nthe basic offense as a felony, which is I think a\njudgment by the State that, even in the basic case, this\nis risky conduct, deserving of severe punishment under\nState law. So, you know, there are nested statutes,\nbut -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not necessarily risky.\nConduct that shows disrespect for the law.\nMR. WALL: Justice Scalia, I mean I -\nagain, I think it is significant that in 1998 the\nGeneral Assembly broke this out as a separate subsection\nand said: We're not even going to require prosecutors\nto prove risk. I think that represents a judgment by\nthe State that the conduct is risky on a typical basis:\nWe just want the State to prove you used a vehicle.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or even if it isn't risky,\nyou should not thumb your nose at the police when they\ntell you to stop.\nMR. WALL: Well, that's right, and the\nreason -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Risky or not.\nMR. WALL: The reason you shouldn't, Justice\nScalia, is because that's the kind of purposeful,\nviolent, and aggressive conduct the State wants to deter\nby treating it as a felony. But I -- I mean, I -\nwhether one looks at the risk prong and the data and the\ncases in Indiana or elsewhere, or whether one looks at\nthe character of the conduct, this offense is just\ndifferent in both degree and kind from the offenses that\nthis Court has said fall outside of ACCA's residual\nclause.\nIt's much more like escape from custody.\nIt's much more like the enumerated offenses. Indeed,\nthe risk of confrontation is certain. I mean, I -- it's\nimportant, I think, that -- I mean, I -- these flights\nare not calm affairs. They're dangerous events. The\naverage speed that the offender is traveling nationwide\nis 25 miles an hour over the speed limit. This is\nsomeone who on average is young, unlicensed, influenced\nby alcohol -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought there was\n-- I don't know where -- I don't remember where it was\nfrom. I thought there was a development of best police\npractices that you don't just chase people. You know,\nif they're going 30 miles an hour over the speed limit\nthrough a school zone, that doesn't mean the police\nofficer should do that. You know, you call ahead, they\nput these strips on the road, whatever.\nMR. WALL: Mr. Chief Justice, that's right.\nI think police agencies have been struggling with this\nquestion, which is why there's a lot of data on police\npursuits, frankly, especially in the last 10 or 15\nyears. I think some of them are becoming more\nrestrictive, and so the data picks up pursuits. It\ndoesn't pick up all flights. And I think if there were\nsound evidence that when people were not pursued, they\nwere actually driving at low speeds and safely, that\nwould affect the data, though not so much that it would\nmove it outside of similarity to the enumerated\noffenses.\nBut I think the -- the data is pretty good\nin indicating that the typical flight is -- really does\npose a serious potential risk of physical injury to\nothers, a risk that materializes more often than with\nother crimes that Congress clearly intended to fall\nwithin the ACCA.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you this: If a\nperson is convicted of vehicular flight that causes\ndeath, is that aggressive conduct?\nMR. WALL: Yes, the Government would say it\nis, Justice Alito.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is the conduct there any\ndifferent from the conduct when death doesn't result?\nMR. WALL: No, Justice Alito. The\nGovernment's answer is that categorically the behavior\nis aggressive and that in some cases it will result in\ninjury or death and in some it will not, but in all\ncases it carries that potential.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Doesn't whether it's\naggressive or not depend upon how it happened? I mean,\nit could be -- I mean, the flight puts in place the\npotential for -- for violence, I agree with that; but if\nsomebody just, you know, jumps out between two cars\nwhile the fellow's fleeing, how has his conduct changed\nto aggressive?\nMR. WALL: Mr. Chief -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not like he -\nit's not like he's aiming for the guy. I mean, it's\nputting it in a dangerous situation. It's purposeful.\nAgain, I'll give you violent in the sense that it has\nthat potential. But he didn't want to hit the -- the\nperson.\nMR. WALL: Mr. Chief Justice -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not aggression\nagainst the person.\nMR. WALL: There's no question that, on a\ncase by case basis, you could flee in a way that was not\nvery risky, that was not very violent, or not very\naggressive. And if this Court went on a case-by-case\nbasis, then we'd look at the conduct here, and the\nGovernment would still win, because this is the typical\ncase.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But he's saying even when\nit's risky, it's not aggressive.\nMR. WALL: And I -- my -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You can be risky and not\naggressive, can't you?\nMR. WALL: Yes, on a case-by-case basis.\nBut, categorically, which is what this Court looks at,\nthe conduct encompassed by the elements in the ordinary\ncase -- in the ordinary case -- the character of the\nconduct is aggressive.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Who's he aggressing\nagainst? When someone sees the police and says I'm\ngetting out of here and drives down the highway, say, at\n80 miles an hour, you know, 25 miles above the speed\nlimit, who is he -- I'm sure it's not the right verb,\nbut who is he aggressing against?\nMR. WALL: Well, I don't know that he is\naggressing against anyone, in the same way that if I\nrecklessly I fire a gun into a large crowd of people,\nyou know, I haven't aggressed against anyone in\nparticular. He's aggressed against anyone who strays\ninto his field of flight and who could be injured by\nwhat is typically a high-speed flight and pursuit. So I\ndon't -- there is no specific target, but that will be\ntrue of many of the crimes that are violent felonies,\nthat the -- the aggressive nature -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, no. It's not\nthat -\nMR. WALL: -- of the conduct is directed\ngenerally.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- there's no\nspecific target. There's no target. What this guy\nhopes is that nobody gets in his way.\nMR. WALL: Well, so, too, with the burglar,\nwho hopes that no one will come home; maybe even the\narsonist, who hopes no one is in the house; or the\nextortionist, who hopes someone will pay, so he won't\nhave to use violence.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But they're mentioned;\nthey're mentioned. They're mentioned, and you're trying\nto get this in under the residual clause.\nMR. WALL: That's right, Justice Scalia, a\nresidual clause that, as you yourself have recognized,\nis extremely broadly worded. It -- it abstracts out as\nthe quality of the enumerated offenses that they create\na serious potential risk of physical injury to others.\nAnd I can't find any metric along which flight doesn't\ndo that, whether one looks through the cases, media\nreports, the statistical data, whatever one -- Indiana,\nnationally -- whatever standard or metric one uses, this\nis an extremely risky offense to others.\nAnd I, you know -- so it's very difficult to\nfigure out what test, what interpretation of that\nlanguage would exclude this from -- from ACCA.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose you have one of 36\nStates which treat this -- treat the general offense as\na misdemeanor and then make it a felony if you put\nsomebody at risk. Just reading that statute, you'd\nthink those 36 States, when they have the general\noffense, do something where the guy acted pretty\ntrivially; and where it's a felony, he actually put\nsomebody at risk, sped off -- wouldn't that be your\nnormal instinct in just guessing from the -- from the\nlanguage?\nMR. WALL: Justice Breyer, the States -\nJUSTICE BREYER: How are we supposed to\ntreat those, where there's a misdemeanor -\nMR. WALL: The States -\nJUSTICE BREYER: In your opinion, it's just\na misdemeanor, we also treat it the same way; say it's a\nviolent felony?\nMR. WALL: The States treat it differently.\nSome, as Indiana -\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then that's\nactually my question. Are we supposed to, in this\nFederal statute, try to track whether it's a\nmisdemeanor, what the language is? We're going to have\na nightmare of a Federal law for States to -- for judges\nto figure this out. I mean, every little variation in\nthousands and thousands of possible variations could\nmake a difference as to whether it's violent or not,\ndepending on data which no one will have.\nMR. WALL: Justice Breyer, I don't think so.\nIf the Court were to affirm here, what that would mean\nis that the offense of flight is a violent felony\ninsofar as you have a predicate conviction under a State\nstatute where it's been punishable by up to a year, and\nso it could qualify for ACCA coverage.\nNow, some State convictions will have been\ntreated as misdemeanors and won't be eligible for ACCA,\nbut to the extent a State treats it as a felony, it's\nrisky enough to satisfy the residual clause. Now, if\nthe Court treats (A) and (B) as what they are not, which\nis greater or lesser, then, yes, I think there will be\nproblems with various State statutes, as Justice Kagan\npointed out, and this Court may have to clear it up down\nthe road.\nBut if it treats this basic offense as what\nit is, not a greater or lesser, but alternative means of\nproving a single offense that is risky, that would, I\nthink, take care of all flight cases going forward.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, on this question of\nwhether this statute is greater or lesser, it's greater\nor lesser if you just understand (b)(1)(A) as confined\nto vehicular flight. In other words, if one looks only\nat vehicular flight, then (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) are\nindeed greater or lesser offenses.\nMR. WALL: Yes, Justice Kagan, if you're\nlooking only -- I take it you're looking only at the\nvehicle prong of (B), but the test in Schmuck is whether\nit's impossible to -- to commit the greater without\ncommitting the lesser. It's not impossible to commit\n(B), because it does have the two other prongs, and I\nthink -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, do you think that if I\nflee in a vehicle, I could be prosecuted under both and\nreceive sentences under both?\nMR. WALL: No, I don't think so, because I\nthink the -- there is no evidence -- no case in Indiana\nthat I'm aware of. There's no evidence that the General\nAssembly intended these to be multiple punishments for a\nsingle incident. They're alternative means of proving a\nsingle offense. The State has always treated them that\nway, so far as I can tell. I have not seen -- I've seen\nprosecutions since 1998 that were all under (A). I\nhaven't seen anything that went under (A) and (B) and\ntried to get multiple punishments -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Wait a minute.\nMR. WALL: -- and I think that would be a\nserious problem.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm a little confused by\nwhat you said and what point you're making. You don't\nthink that (B) is a lesser included of (A)? Is that -\nno, that (A) is a lesser included of (B)?\nMR. WALL: Your Honor, the Government does\nnot think that (A) is a lesser included of (B).\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You can't commit (B)\nwithout committing (A) first. (B) has just one\nadditional element, but all of the elements of (A) are\npart of the elements of (B). So, how can it not be a\nlesser included?\nMR. WALL: Well, the element of (B) that's\ndifferent, Justice Sotomayor, is the \"while committing\nany offense described in subsection (a).\" So you can be\nresisting an officer or you can be obstructing the\nservice of process and you can endanger someone in\nvarious ways, including with a vehicle, and you will\nhave violated (B), and you can be prosecuted for that,\nand there are cases in Indiana like that. And you have\nnot -- you have not been fleeing in a vehicle from an\nofficer at any point, so you haven't violated (A).\nSo the existence of the other prong there -\nthat's what I was trying to get into with Justice\nKagan -- means that this is not a greater or lesser\nunder Schmuck.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But as a vehicular flight\nonly, it would be greater or lesser.\nMR. WALL: If you divided up the prongs\nunder Schmuck, but I think the Schmuck -- what follows\nlogically from that test is that you look at the entire\noffense and ask whether it's possible to commit it\nwithout committing the lesser, and that test is not\nsatisfied here. I don't think you carve it up prong by\nprong.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm -- this is greater or\nlesser for purposes of what? Double jeopardy?\nMR. WALL: No, it's greater or lesser for\npurposes of Petitioner's argument that you should assume\nthat every risky flight gets prosecuted under (B), and\nhence (A) is a non-risky offense. And that argument\nfails for multiple reasons, one of which I was trying to\nspin out. It's not even true that this is greater or\nlesser.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I just don't follow that\nargument. I mean, it -- it seems to me that, yes, you\ncould -- you could run afoul of (B) by committing an\noffense under subsection little (a) in some other ways,\nbut if you run afoul of (B) by committing the offense\nof -- of flight from a law enforcement officer, it seems\nto me that that automatically includes (A).\nMR. WALL: Well, except that there are two\nalternative means of proving the same offense under\nState law. They have the same State law penalties, so\nthe prosecutors can go under (A) or they can go under\n(B). And as far as I can tell, for the last, say, 13\nyears, they've been going under -- they've been going\nunder (A).\nSo it's not -- Justice Scalia, it's not -\nthere are aggravators in this statute for injury or\ndeath. They're the ones that are in (2) and (3), the\nclass C and class B felonies. But this is not a greater\nor lesser. It's -- they're alternative means. I think\nonly if you got -- set that aside would you get to the\nsort of Schmuck analysis that I was going through with\n-- with Justice Kagan.\nAnd I think one of the important things to\nrecognize about this offense is that, you know, in\nthe -- 50 percent of these offenders are ultimately\ncharged with a violation that's unrelated to their\nflight, a serious felony unrelated to their flight.\nAnd the reason I think that's important is\nbecause what you will look -- the reason that they're\ntraveling at such high speeds, the reason they're\nevading officers, the reason the typical case is not\nsomeone just going a couple blocks and stopping, is\nbecause they've got drugs in the car or guns, they have\nparole violations or outstanding warrants. It is the\nbackground against which I think you have to assess the\ncharacter of the -- of the conduct here. And whether\nyou're looking at it under risk or under the character\nof the conduct, the Government submits that it easily\nsatisfies the residual clause.\nIf there are no further questions, thank\nyou.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Wall.\nMr. Marsh, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM E. MARSH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. MARSH: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI would suggest that it's helpful to start\nto look at the in-kind part of the Begay test on a more\ngeneral level than we've been discussing.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you succinctly\ntell me how this is any less purposeful, aggressive, or\nviolent than escape from custody? What's your best\nanswer to why this is just not identical to escape,\nwhich is a fleeing-from situation just as this is.\nMR. MARSH: Justice Sotomayor, the basic\ndistinction is that the person who's charged with\nescape, assuming that escape means escape from a secure\ninstitution or from a person, is that the person is in\ncustody, and it takes, in the ordinary case, aggression\nand violence to get out of the custody of that person.\nThe person who is fleeing is trying to avoid being\ntaken.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, here an officer\nhas told you to stop. They're trying to effect custody.\nAnd I don't know what the aggression or violence is,\nother than, you know, breaking a window, doing\nsomething. It doesn't require the escape -- that you\nactually injure someone to get out. It's just that you\nrun away.\nMR. MARSH: I think the phrase that you just\nused is the distinction that I was referring to. The\nperson who is fleeing is trying to avoid being in\ncustody. They're acting in a -- instead of going toward\nthe officer and resisting, they're going away from the\nofficer. The person who is in custody has to use some\nkind of force, and in Johnson, of course the -- this\nCourt referred to violent as the -\nJUSTICE ALITO: That's not true. There are\na lot -- you can -- there are prison escapes all the\ntime where it's done through subterfuge.\nMR. MARSH: That's -- that's true, Justice\nAlito, but as the Court held in James, finding an\nexample of a case that would not be violent does not\nsolve the ordinary case. The ordinary case, I would\nsuggest, requires something more than that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's, for me,\nanyway, an important question. I'll -- I'm not sure the\nordinary case does. I assume the ordinary prison escape\nis -- I don't know -- over the wall, under the tunnel\nor, you know, while the guard's looking a different way,\nor some -- I don't know that it's typical that when the\nguard is there, you say now's my chance. The typical\ncase doesn't involve aggression.\nMR. MARSH: Of course, the ordinary case or\nthe typical case, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the court\nneeds to look at the conduct encompassed by the elements\nof the statute, and so we would have to look at exactly\nwhat the statute requires.\nThe circuit courts have been very divided on\nescape. In my circuit, the Seventh Circuit, the Federal\nstatute, 751, has been held not to be -- which is a\ngeneral escape statute -- not to be a violent felony.\nBut, again, the Court talks about the ordinary case in\nthe James case for the purpose of disabusing the idea\nthat one can't get out from under the violent felony\ndesignation just by coming up with a hypothetical case\nor an example where it can be done without -- without\nviolence.\nHere, I would suggest that counsel has just\ncreated for the Court some kind of a hypothetical case\nto define the typical or ordinary case. This Court has\nnever done that, and this Court said in James that it's\nimportant to stick to the conduct encompassed by the\nelements of the offense, because if we start factoring\nin other kinds of conduct, as several of the things\nwhich have been mentioned by counsel for the Government,\nthat begins to raise Apprendi problems, which is another\nwhole issue. But the Court said in James -- and I would\nacknowledge is the law -- that so long as the\ndetermination as to whether there's a serious potential\nrisk of physical injury is made by focusing on the\nconduct encompassed by the elements of the offense, then\nthere's not an Apprendi problem.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
