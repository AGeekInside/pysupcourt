        "content": "[10:02 a.m.]\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst in United States versus Georgia, and Goodman\nversus Georgia.\nGeneral Clement.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER IN 04-1203\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nTitle II of the Americans with Disabilities\nAct validly abrogates the States' sovereign immunities\nas applied to the class of cases involving the\nunconstitutional treatment of disabled inmates. That\nresult follows from this Court's decisions in Nevada\nagainst Hibbs, and Tennessee against Lane.\nIn Lane, this Court held that it was clear,\nbeyond peradventure, that Congress had an adequate\nbasis to enact prophylactic legislation to ensure that\nindividuals with disabilities had access to public\nservices. In reaching that conclusion, this Court\nsurveyed a broad array of evidence, not just limited to\nthe court-access context, and, indeed, surveyed\nevidence involving prisons, in particular. As a\nresult, the sole remaining question, and the only\nquestion in Lane on which this Court applied an as-\napplied analysis, is the question of whether or not\nTitle II's remedies are congruent and proportional as\napplied to the particular context; here, the context of\nthe discriminatory, inhumane, or otherwise\nunconstitutional treatment of inmates with\ndisabilities.\nNow, if one applies the congruence and\nproportionality analysis of Lane, in particular, in the\nprison context, it easily passes constitutional muster.\nFor all of the factors that this Court emphasized as\nmaking Title II appropriate in the court-access context\n-- the absence of absolute mandates, the inherent\nflexibility of the reasonable modification standard,\nthe fact that benefits are limited to otherwise\neligible individuals, the defenses for fundamental\nalterations or undue burdens -- all of those factors\napply with full force in this context.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Can it -- with respect to\nthe reasonableness aspect, in Turner versus Safley, we\nsaid prison administrators have a good deal of\nlatitude, in the prison context, in order to maintain\norder. Now, do you see the reasonableness requirements\nof the Disabilities Act as being congruent with the\nTurner-Safley reasonableness analysis?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Absolutely, Justice\nO'Connor. And one of the reasons that I think that\nTitle II is particularly congruent and proportional in\nthe prison context is, the reasonable-modification\nstandard, which, after all, uses the term\n\"reasonableness,\" is very well amenable to the kind of\nTurner deference standard this Court applied. And, of\ncourse, just last term, this Court, in Johnson against\nCalifornia and Wilkins -- and in the Wilkinson case,\nCutter against Wilkinson, applied deference to prison\nofficials even in the context of strict scrutiny. And\nso --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- I think it --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- suggesting --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- applies, a fortiori.\nI'm sorry, Mr. --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- suggesting that\nthe ADA does not add to the burdens of the State\nofficials, it just simply tracks what's already\nrequired under Turner?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, I don't\n-- I don't -- I'm not up here today saying there's no\nprophylaxis at all with respect to Title II, but I\nthink it is proportional and congruent, and I think the\nprophylactic gap between what the Constitution protects\nand what Title II protects is relatively narrow in the\nprison context, both because if you think about one set\nof claims, the Turner claims, much of that deference\ncan be brought in under the reasonable-modification\nstandard; and then, if you think of the other class of\ncases, those involving deliberate indifference, I think\nin those class of cases, this is -- the prison context\nis one of the rare contexts in which the State is under\nan affirmative obligation to provide accommodations to\nthe medical needs of inmates, including disabled\ninmates. And I think the fact that here's a case where\nthe Constitution requires affirmative accommodation\nalso helps narrow the prophylactic gap.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under Turner, one of\nthe considerations that can be taken into account are\nthe budgetary limitations of State officials. Does\nthat apply under the ADA, as well?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think it certainly could.\nI think -- if you look at the cases that we collect at\nfootnote 17 of our reply brief, which are cases where\nthe lower courts have applied Turner-style deference to\nclaims under the Rehabilitation Act or under Title II,\nI think some of those Courts of Appeals have clearly\ntaken into account those kind of budgetary concerns.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, all of the\nconcerns you've mentioned could be taken care of by\ninjunctive relief. You don't necessarily need damages.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think damages are\nan important aspect of the remedial scheme, Justice\nKennedy. I would also point out that, because a number\nof States have challenged the application of Title II,\nin the prison context, in particular, as not being\nvalid Commerce Clause legislation, it's not a foregone\nconclusion that there would be injunctive relief\navailable. But I do think if we want to focus on the\ndamage --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but if we held the\nAct was applicable for injunctive relief, it would --\nit would be, because I'm -- the pert part of your\nargument is that you could have a attorneys fees and\ntriple damages where trial attorneys levy against the\nState treasury, which is -- which is what the eleventh\namendment is largely concerned with. That -- all of\nthat would follow from what you've said so far.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I'm not sure about\nthe treble damages, but certainly compensatory damages\nwould be available. This Court, of course, in Barnes\nagainst Gorman, has already said that punitive damages\nare not available under Title II. And I think if you\nlook at compensatory damages --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I know they're not\navailable under Title II, but, I mean, as a\nconstitutional matter, there's certainly nothing\nbarring them, based on what you've told us so far.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think punitive\ndamages would be a harder case, in terms of\nproportional incongruence. But this Court has, even in\nthe absence of congressional action, found damages to\nbe an appropriate remedy for unconstitutional or\nunlawful State conduct. Take the Bivens cases, for\nexample, or the Franklin case, in Title IX, and, I\nthink, if damages are appropriate where Congress hasn't\nacted, I think where Congress has provided for damages,\ndamages are clearly an appropriate remedy. But, with\nrespect to damages, in particular, I think it's\nimportant to note that the prophylactic gap here is not\nlarge, because, in the Title IX context, in the Gebser\ncase, this Court has already said that, in order for\nthere to be compensatory damages, there needs to be a\nshowing of deliberate indifference. And now, there may\nbe some difference between what \"deliberate\nindifference\" means under Gebser and what \"deliberate\nindifference\" means under Farmer against Brennan, but,\nwhatever that small gap is, that certainly seems\nmanageable.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: General Clement, in two\nrespects, it -- I think you have addressed the cost\nconcern by comparing, in your brief, the Federal\nexperience, which is subject to these controls, and you\nsaid it wasn't an inordinate expense, but you also\npointed out that every State prison system is subject\nto the Rehabilitation Act, because they get Federal\nfunds. Is there a difference between the obligation\nthat State systems would have under the Rehabilitation\nAct and under the ADA?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, Justice Ginsburg, we\ndon't think so. But one thing I think it's important\nto emphasize is that, although at the current time\nperiod all 50 States take Federal funds for their\nprisons, so that all 50 States are subject to the\nRehabilitation Act, that wasn't true at the time that\nthe ADA was passed. And I think what that illustrates\nis both that Title II plays an important gap-filling\nrole and also that, for whatever reason, I think, this\nis an area -- prisons taking Federal funds -- where the\ndegree to which they take Federal funds may wax and\nwane over time. And so, I don't think this is a\nsituation where Title II is purely duplicative of the\nRehabilitation Act, but the difference is really in\nterms of the scope of the coverage, not in terms of the\nsubstantive obligations under the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- two provisions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- damage remedies\navailable under the Rehabilitation Act is --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I'm --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Damages are available?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Yes, they are, as to the\nStates.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: General --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But this --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- Clement, I'm interested\nin another statute that has applicability in the\ncircumstances, and that's Section 1983 and the Prison\nLitigation Reform Act. Under the -- under the Prison\nLitigation Reform Act, if you're bringing a\nconstitutional claim under Section 1983, you have to\nexhaust your prison remedies before you can do that.\nAnd that is not the case here, is that right?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, I don't think that is\nright, Justice Scalia. I think that we would -- we\nwould say that the PLRA fully applies to claims under\nTitle II and there is an exhaustion remedy. There is\nalso, of course, an exhaustion remedy inherent in Title\nII, because, in order to get a reasonable modification,\nyou have to ask for the modification in the first\nplace.\nWe also think that the PLRA applies, in all\nits provisions, to Title II claims. And one important\nprovision to keep in mind is 1997e(e) -- 42 U.S.C. 1997\ne(e) -- which is a limitations on the damages that are\navailable. And, under that provision, in order to get\ndamages for emotional or mental injury, you have to\nalso show some sort of physical injury. And the lower\ncourts have interpreted that to require at least the\nkind of more than de minimis injury you need under the\nEighth Amendment. And I think the PLRA, together with\nTitle II, in the particular area of damages, which is\nwhat Justice Kennedy has pointed out is the particular\narea of concern under the Eleventh Amendment, is even a\nfurther narrowing of the relief that's available and a\nfurther narrowing of the prophylaxis under the Title\nII. So, I do think the PLRA is actually something that\nactually helps make sure that the remedy here is\ncongruent and proportional.\nJUSTICE STEVENS:\nMay I ask you to comment on this? This problem of --\njust troubles me a little bit. If we hold this\nprovision unconstitutional because it is not congruent\nand proportional and so forth, does it not follow that\nthe Title II is entirely unconstitutional, it cannot\neven be enforced by injunctive relief?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Because of the lack of the\nCommerce Clause nexus? Is that the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- concern, Justice\nStevens?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- the whole basis for the\nconstitutionality of the statute, I think, is the\nEnforcement Clause of the fourteenth amendment.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, it was -- when it was\noriginally enacted, Justice Stevens, it was supported\nby both the Commerce Clause and, of course the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's true of Title II, as\nwell as Title I?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: That is -- that's true, the\nstatute generally -- and it's true of Title II. We\nwould make -- we would certainly defend the Act as\nvalid Commerce Clause legislation. But I do think that\nis a much more difficult argument as to Title II,\ngenerally, and particularly difficult argument with\nrespect to prisons. I think, in that respect, it's --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- telling that, if you go\nback to the Government's brief in Yeskey, when we were\ndealing with constitutional challenges to the\napplication of Title II to prisons, the Government\nfocused all its energy on defending it as valid Section\n5 legislation --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- and dealt with the\nCommerce Clause in a footnote. So, I think we\ncertainly, at that point, were of the view that the\nSection 5 authority was the much stronger basis to\ndefend the statute, especially in the prison context.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So, what I'm suggesting is\nthat it is not merely a matter of damages that's at\nissue here, but the entire validity of Title II.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: We agree with that, Justice\nStevens. And I would say, with respect to -- I mean,\nagain, I don't want to mislead you, in the sense that\nwe would be here defending it as Commerce Clause\nlegislation, but I think that's a tricky argument.\nIf it's possible, I'd like to reserve the\nrest of my time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\nMr. Bagenstos.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL R. BAGENSTOS\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER IN 04-1236\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act is\ncongruent and proportional as applied to the prison\nsetting for essentially three reasons. The first is\nthe nature of the constitutional right that's at stake\nin the prison setting. As in the access-to-courts\nsetting, this is a setting where States have\naffirmative constitutional duties, including, in many\ncircumstances, duties of accommodation of inmates'\ndisabilities.\nThe second reason relates to the record of\nconstitutional violations in this context, a record in\nthe context of State treatment of inmates with\ndisabilities that is extensive, that is judicially\ndocumented and confirmed on a nationwide basis.\nAnd the third reason relates to the tailoring\nof the ADA remedy, which the -- which General Clement\nhas spoken about to some extent already -- both\nlimitations inherent in the ADA itself and in the PLRA,\nwhich fully applies to ADA cases.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do those violations that you\nallude to -- is there an extensive record of violations\nby the State of Georgia?\nMR. BAGENSTOS: There is not. The same --\nthe record of constitutional violations is nationwide.\nWe don't have any judicial findings --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you're --\nMR. BAGENSTOS: -- of constitutional\nviolations --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the money --\nMR. BAGENSTOS: -- by Georgia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- is not coming from the\nNation, it's coming from the State of Georgia. Was the\nState of Georgia guilty of constitutional violations?\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well, I mean, of course, in\nthis case, the lower court said that there might have\nbeen a constitutional violation that allowed that claim\nto proceed in the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, my --\nMR. BAGENSTOS: -- companion --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- I mean a record -- a\nrecord that would have justified applying, against the\nState of Georgia, prophylactic measures.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well, we think the\nprophylactic measures are justified by the nationwide\nrecord, just as in this Court's case --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even against people who\nplayed no part in that nationwide record.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well, that's this Court's\ncases on prophylactic nationwide legislation,\nabsolutely. You know, in Tennessee versus Lane, this\nCourt upheld nationwide prophylactic legislation on the\nbasis of a record that included constitutional\nviolations in only eight States. Here, we have a\nrecord that touches on at least 37 States, if you look\nin pages 20 to 36 of our opening brief. In --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is this relevant to\nthe -- I just saw these as -- I -- just by chance, it -\n- one of the cases in the SG's brief involved Georgia\njuvenile facilities, where mentally ill patients were\nrestrained, hit, shackled, put in restraint chairs for\nhours, sprayed with pepper spray.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well, I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that seemed to be one\ninstance coming out of Georgia.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: I think that's right. I\nthink that's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was that before or after\nthe enactment of this statute?\nMR. BAGENSTOS: I believe that was pre-ADA,\nYour Honor.\nBut I think that the point --\nthe point is that the record of constitutional\nviolations here is a nationwide record. It's a record\nthat includes some incidents from Georgia. It's a\nrecord that includes many incidents from many other\nStates; as I say, 37 different States. It's a record\nof constitutional violations that's been judicially\nconfirmed. We have courts actually finding --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well --\nMR. BAGENSTOS: -- in final adjudications --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- I'm looking at the --\nMR. BAGENSTOS: -- constitutional violations.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- at the chart in one of\nthe amicus briefs, which shows that there are, for\nGeorgia -- and it lists all the States -- for Georgia,\nzero arguable State violations prior to the Act.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well, I think that's -- I\nmean, I think that's because they exclude --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The --\nMR. BAGENSTOS: -- juvenile facilities from\ntheir --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well --\nMR. BAGENSTOS: -- consideration.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- State and local\nviolations.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But State and local units\ndon't enjoy the sovereign immunity of the State.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: The -- I mean --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You --\nMR. BAGENSTOS: -- you know --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- don't need this Act to\nsue them.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well, I would say, in\nGeorgia, of course, State and -- of course, local\nfacilities are arms of the State in Georgia. That's\nbeen the judicial holding. And so, for Eleventh\nAmendment purposes, we would consider them. But I\nwould say the record of constitutional violations here\nthat justifies nationwide prophylaxis is really far\nmore extensive than the record that's been before this\nCourt in Tennessee v. Lane and Nevada v. Hibbs and\ntouches on touches on even more States than, you know,\nthe nationwide literacy test ban that was upheld in\nOregon v. Mitchell. At the time this Court upheld\nthat, only 22 States had literacy tests, I think.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this? The\nnotion of our reviewing the adequacy of the evidence\nbefore Congress is something that's always seemed, sort\nof, puzzling to me. Do you know what -- what is --\nwhat standard do you suggest that we should apply in\ndetermining whether the evidence before Congress was\nsufficient?\nMR. BAGENSTOS: In determining whether the\nevidence before Congress was sufficient, I think, you\nknow, this Court has said -- I think the standard comes\nfrom City of Boerne -- it's the congruence and\nproportionality test, but it recognizes that Congress\nhas to have a great deal of leeway in determining where\nthe line between enforcement and substantive change in\nthe law lies. And, you know, here we have, whatever\nstandard we use, the kind of record of constitutional\nviolations that justifies prophylaxis. We have -- we\nhave constitutional rights that impose on States\nobligations of accommodation. So, the ADA is, in no\ncircumstance --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, I understand your view\nis that, whatever the standard is, you win. I'm just\ncurious, do you have a --\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- do you have a\nformulation of what the proper standard should be?\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well, as I said, I think the\n-- I do think that the proper standard should be the\nCity of Boerne standard of congruence and\nproportionality, exercised with the kind of deference\nthat this Court said in Boerne, which I think this\nCourt adopted in Lane, to the factfinding capabilities\nof the -- of the -- of the Congress.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand your\nsubmission -- and that's what I heard from the\nSolicitor General, as well -- on the difference between\nenforcement and the substantive right. You're assuring\nus that we don't need to worry about that, because\nthere's no great difference between what you think is\nrequired under the ADA and what's required under the\nConstitution.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I\nthink there is clearly a difference. Right? There's a\nprophylactic sweep to the statute. It's just that it's\nnot very much, in this context, for a number of\nreasons, one being the nature of the constitutional\nrights, that they impose requirements that are\naffirmative duties, the other being the way the\nreasonableness language of the ADA has been\nconsistently read by lower courts to take account of\ncontext, and another being the Prison Litigation Reform\nAct, which further ties the ADA to the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm just\nwondering if that's --\nMR. BAGENSTOS: -- constitutional violation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- a reasonable\nreading of the ADA, which I had always understood to be\na significant change in -- in terms of what rights are\navailable to the disabled. And it seems to me quite\ndifferent from Turner against Safley, which talks about\nthe demands of the prison environment and the -- and a\nhigh level of deference to prison administrators. Do\nyou think that approach is, in fact, consistent with\nwhat Congress had in mind with the ADA?\nMR. BAGENSTOS: I think that the approach of\ntaking into account the significant State interest in\nuniform treatment in the prison setting uniquely, yes,\nis very much consistent with what Congress had in mind,\njust as this Court, in the Cutter case, you know, read\nthe \"compelling State interest\" language, much more\nstringent language about the -- about what the State\nhas to satisfy -- as taking --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: One --\nMR. BAGENSTOS: -- account of --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: One --\nMR. BAGENSTOS: -- these concerns.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: One concern is that, in\nthe prison situation, the prison is exerting control\nover all aspects of the prisoner's daily life. That's\nvery different from just court access, as in Tennessee\nversus Lane, and it could require very extensive\nrequirements, perhaps. Is that a concern, or should it\nbe, in the \"congruence and proportionality\"\nexamination?\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well, I think there are two\nsides to that coin. I think, definitely, the scope of\nthe ADA in the prison setting, you know, is important.\nI think that the lower court's reading of\n\"reasonable,\" which I think is the -- is the reasonable\nreading of \"reasonable,\" if I may say so -- is, you\nknow, \"reasonable\" takes account of context, and\n\"reasonableness\" takes account of proportion, as well,\nthe kind of accommodation that may be reasonable, where\nwhat's at stake is the ability of an inmate with a\ndisability to go to the bathroom safely, like Mr.\nGoodman alleges, may be entirely unreasonable, where\nwhat's at stake is attending an arts-and-crafts class,\nor something like that. So, I think that is important,\nbut I think the flip side of the -- of the State's\ncomplete control over every aspect of the inmate's\nenvironment is, this is one of the few areas of\nGovernment where States have affirmative constitutional\nduties, including --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Bagenstos, on this\npoint, do we have any figures on what -- I guess it's\nthe Rehabilitation Act that applies to the Federal\nPrisons -- do we have any figures on -- you know, on\nwhat that has cost in required accommodations?\nMR. BAGENSTOS: You know, I don't know the\nfigures for that. Perhaps the Solicitor General can\nanswer as to what the burden has been on the Federal\nGovernment. I think, you know, the Solicitor General\nstates in his brief -- in his reply brief, particularly\n-- that the burden has not been significant, the\nGovernment --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: -- has not --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It applies -- it applies\nto State prisons, as well, because of its Spending --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, yes, that's right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- Clause legislation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. That's right.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: That's true. It does apply\nto State prisons, as well, Justice Ginsburg. However,\nwe -- you know, we obviously can't be sure that it's\nalways going to cover every State prison. It hasn't,\nat times, in the past. It might not, at times, in the\nfuture.\nI think, you know, one of the significant\naspects of the Rehabilitation Act is -- and I think the\namicus brief filed on behalf of Mr. Goodman by the\nformer President George H. W. Bush really emphasizes\nthis -- the ADA was passed based on a firm conclusion\nby Congress that the Rehabilitation Act had failed,\nthat it hadn't worked. And I think the record of\nconstitutional violations here shows that, that we have\nsuch an extensive record of judicially confirmed,\njudicially established findings of constitutional\nviolations in the prison context, and we have\nconstitutional rights that impose on States the same\nkinds of requirements, not in all particulars, but in\nvery similar ways, as the ADA does, itself. I think\nthat's where -- that's where the congruence and\nproportionality really comes in.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why is it so clear that\ndamages are necessary and that equitable relief\nshouldn't suffice? It's --\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- it's puzzling -- it's\npuzzling to me, the notion that trial attorneys and\ntheir clients can levy upon the funds in State\ntreasuries under the Eleventh Amendment. Why is it\ncongruent and proportional to allow that?\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well, a couple of points\nabout that. I mean, the first is the deterrent\nfunction of damages is really essential in this\ncontext. I think that's the import of the record of\nconstitutional violations. Section 1983 failed.\nI think the second point about damages is,\nthey're very limited in the prison context. They're\nlimited by this Court's decision in Barnes, no\npunitives. They're --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, where you say Section\n1983 failed, the ADA could allow equitable remedies.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: The ADA could allow equitable\nremedies, but -- could certainly --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And why --\nMR. BAGENSTOS: -- allow --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And why shouldn't that --\nwhy shouldn't that suffice?\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well, I think, you know, this\n-- something this Court has said repeatedly, that the\ndeterrent function of damages is important -- and here,\nwe have -- we have a very good -- we have very good\nevidence that we need deterrents in this context. We\nneed deterrents because constitutional violations have\ncontinued and continued. But I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why don't --\nMR. BAGENSTOS: -- think that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why don't you need it for\n1983 violations?\nMR. BAGENSTOS: But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Constitutional violations.\nNot just prophylaxis --\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well, there --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- but actual constitutional\nviolations by the prisons under 1983 --\nMR. BAGENSTOS: I think it --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that don't happen to\nrelate to the handicapped and, thus, are not covered by\nthis legislation? You can't get damages there.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well, you know, I think that\nthe -- with respect to constitutional violations that\nmight not relate to people with disabilities, you know,\nthat's something Congress could certainly consider in\nother legislation. Here, Congress would -- had,\nstaring in front of it -- right? -- a record of\nconstitutional violations that showed -- right? --\nproven constitutional violations showed that the 1983\nremedy, which doesn't authorize damages against the\nState, wasn't working. We need to have some additional\nremedy. We need some additional deterrents and spur to\ncompliance on the part of States. But I think it's\nalso important to note how limited the damages remedy\nin this context is. It's not just the absence of\npunitive damages. It's not just -- you know, we also\nhave the provision of the PLRA that says no damages for\nmental and emotional injury in the absence of physical\ninjury, which means that, in the kinds of cases that\nare peripheral to core constitutional rights, we're not\ngoing to have damages anyway. It also -- we also have\nthe exhaustion requirement of the PLRA, which imposes\non plaintiff the requirement that they go to the prison\nand tell them, \"Here's the problem,\" which means that\nif we have a case that satisfies the PLRA, we're very\nlikely to have deliberate indifference, a problem that\nprison officials have refused to resolve --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait, but -- you know,\nin 1983, when you exhaust your prison remedies, the\nprison fixes what was wrong, and that's the end of it.\nBut, under this Act, you go through your prison\nremedies, what do you ask the prison for? Money? The\nprison can't give you money, so they say, \"No, you\ncan't get your money.\" I --\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well, I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- mean, the prison-remedy\nthing is -- the only thing it does is make it take a\nlonger time to get to court, but it does the prison no\ngood. It's going to be liable for damages anyway.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well, I think that, of\ncourse, the prison can reduce its damages liability,\nand, of course, where we have a continuing violation\nafter exhaustion, which is what -- when people file\nthese lawsuits, when they have continuing problems,\nlike Mr. Goodman alleges were continuing problems in\nhis case -- we will have cases where we have very much\n-- very likely to have deliberate indifference. And\nso, I think that's an important thing, too.\nI think the other important point about\nTurner v. Safley that the Solicitor General spoke about\n-- right? -- many of the constitutional rights in the\nprison setting that are significant here don't\nimplicate Turner v. Safley. Eighth Amendment cruel-\nand-unusual-punishment claims don't implicate Turner v.\nSafley, as this Court said in the Johnson case. And we\nhave a very substantial record of Eighth Amendment\nviolations. Of course, the Eighth Amendment requires\naccommodation of serious medical needs, as this Court\nhas said ever since Estelle v. Gamble, and \"serious\nmedical means -- needs\" is a term that's very close to\nthe way this Court has narrowly read the disability\ndefinition in the ADA. And so, I think another very\nsignificant aspect of the congruence and\nproportionality here is how close the ADA's disability\ndefinition is to the class of people who implicate\nconstitutional rights, affirmative constitutional\nrights of accommodation, under the Eighth Amendment\nitself. And so, I think that's another very\nsignificant aspect of the tightness of the fit here.\nBut, here, I think the most salient fact is,\nif you ever had a record justifying prophylaxis\nnationwide, the record here, that touches on 37\ndifferent States, that includes, in many cases,\nstatewide findings of constitutional violations, is it,\nit's a record that justifies, certainly, some\nprophylactic legislation; at least -- at the very\nleast, the minimal prophylaxis that we have in the ADA\nin the prison setting. It's a kind of -- it's a kind\nof prophylaxis that's very much like the kind of\nprophylaxis this Court has previously upheld in\nTennessee v. Lane, where we had very similar\naffirmative constitutional obligations, and in Nevada\nv. Hibbs, where we had a much less significant record,\nnationwide, of constitutional violations.\nAnd so, for all those reasons, you know, we\nbelieve that the ADA is congruent and proportional in\nthe prison setting.\nAnd if the Court has no further questions --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Okay. Thank you\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Castanias.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY A. CASTANIAS\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS\nMR. CASTANIAS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nBefore I sit down today, I'd like to make\nthree basic points, and hopefully I'll get to make --\nelaborate on each of them a little bit.\nFirst of all, this case is not anything like\nTennessee versus Lane. It doesn't involve the very\nimportant civil right of access to courts, access to\nvoting booths, or anything like that. It involves --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But was there -- there was a\nreporter who was one of the disabled people, I think,\nwasn't there, in Tennessee versus Lane?\nMR. CASTANIAS: I believe that's correct --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so --\nMR. CASTANIAS: -- Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- what is the right that\nthat reporter has that's specific to courthouses?\nMR. CASTANIAS: As I understand it, Your\nHonor, from reading the opinion, that right was the\nspecific right to access the courts. It's the public\nright of access to see court proceedings, like the\npeople --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, was there any problem\nof that in Tennessee versus Lane? I thought the\ncourthouse officials there said, \"There'll be a trial.\nNo problem there, just whether you have to walk up the\nsteps or don't, and we'll give you a trial down below.\"\nWas there -- it's the right of access to courthouse,\nspecially?\nMR. CASTANIAS: It's the right of access to\ncourts, specifically, that was the context that was --\nthat was created for purpose of the as-applied analysis\nin Lane.\nThe second point I hope I'll get to address\ntoday is the very fundamental differences between the\nprison context the -- and the courthouse context at\nissue in Lane, and the reasons why the prison context\nthat it's -- that is at issue in this case makes this\ncase so fundamentally different. The prison context,\nas Justice O'Connor pointed out, is one where issues of\nsafety and security and, as well, from the Court's\ndecisions, issues of federalism and deference to prison\nofficials hold sway. Those were not at issue in Lane,\nand they --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, your --\nMR. CASTANIAS: -- have a --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- your friends on\nthe other side say that's not a big deal, because the\nADA looks only to reasonable accommodations; you can\ntake all those factors into account; and presumably the\nlower courts would. In other words, they say you're\nalready subject to most of these obligations anyway,\nand it's just a little bit extra, under the ADA.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, we\nrespectfully, but strenuously, disagree with that\nsubmission, and I'll give you a very good example of\nwhat they're not talking about here. What's happening\nunder the ADA, as a practical matter in the prison\ncontext, is that it's giving prisoners trials on issues\nlike whether or not they have access to the television\nroom in the prison. That's not a constitutional right.\nBefore the ADA, that was never understood to be a\nconstitutional right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Have Courts of Appeals\napproved those determinations?\nMR. CASTANIAS: I'm not aware, Justice\nGinsburg, of any Court of Appeals that has ruled on\nthat yet, but I am aware of two District Court cases --\nI could give you the names of them -- where summary\njudgment was denied, and a trial was given to the\ninmate. One is Brown against King County Department of\nAdult Corrections --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And how many has it -- in\nthe District Courts, how many have been rejected when\nit's something like television or recreation?\nMR. CASTANIAS: Justice Ginsburg, without\nmaking any representations that I am going to canvas\nthe universe on this, I have not seen a case where the\nDistrict Court has rejected a trial in that respect.\nAnd I think, Your Honor, this gives me an\nopportunity to talk about one of the fundamental\nproblems --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, before you do --\nMR. CASTANIAS: Sure.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- as I understand it, and\nas the Solicitor General confirmed, you are subject to\nthe Rehabilitation Act, where the substantive scope is\nthe same. So, what -- you are saying, in the prison\ncontext, this is undue, but you all -- you are already\nsubject to it under one Act. And how has that been\nworking out?\nMR. CASTANIAS: Justice Ginsburg, I don't\nhave any data on that, and we haven't -- we don't have\nany in our brief. The Solicitor General's data that he\nput in on the Federal Bureau of Prisons came in his\nreply brief, and we certainly haven't had --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But do you --\nMR. CASTANIAS: -- an opportunity --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- agree that --\nMR. CASTANIAS: -- to pull that together.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- the Rehab Act contains\nthe same essential requirements as ADA?\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, the Rehabilitation Act\nis a little different than the ADA, but it certainly is\nprotective of many of the same rights. I would think\nit would be protective of all of the same\nconstitutional rights that the --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And you agree that it\napplies at least where the States are accepting Federal\nmoney for the prison?\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, as I understand it,\nJustice O'Connor, the Spending Clause power can be\nhived down on a program-by-program basis, not just as\nwhether the State itself is receiving it. So, without\nknowing specifically whether we're talking about the\nparticular program --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Does it apply in the\nprison in this case -- the Rehab Act?\nMR. CASTANIAS: I don't know the answer to\nthat, as I stand here, Justice O'Connor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Schaerr, who's going to\nbe representing some States as amici, will presumably\nhave better information on that subject.\nMR. CASTANIAS: I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: In your point of view, would\nit help if the Court said -- I guess it would, but I --\nin order to get rid of this problem, if the Court said,\n\"Look, it says 'reasonable.' Of course prison has\nspecial problems,\" and, referring, say, to Turner\nversus Safley, said that, \"These things about\ntelevision remote controls are not really, normally, a\nmatter of unreasonableness.\" So, in other words, we\nhit -- we -- you'd give considerable discretion to the --\nto the warden, and the Act would have bite in cases\nwhere there is really a serious problem, like this one.\nIt's alleged to be a really serious problem.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, Justice Breyer, I think\nyou're right to say that, except that that's not what\nthe Act says. The Act says --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought it said\n\"reasonableness.\"\nMR. CASTANIAS: That's exactly right, and\nthat -- and the reasonable -- the reasonable-\naccommodation or reasonable-modification standard of\nthe ADA, both generally and specifically in Title II,\nimposes an affirmative burden on the States, which is\nvery much unlike the rational-basis test of Cleburne.\nIt's very much unlike the rational-relationship test of\nTurner against Safley. Quite the contrary, what\nhappens in these cases -- and this comes up in the\ntelevision cases, as well as the access-to-chapels\ncases or any of the -- any of the cases that the\nPetitioners have hypothesized -- what happens in that\ncase is, the Petitioner pleads that, \"I could access\nthis if I only had a reasonable accommodation,\" and\nthen the burden shifts to the State, at that point, to\nnot just articulate reasonable grounds, but to, in\nfact, prove that it is not reasonable or that it would\nbe an undue burden. There is a case that the -- that\nPetitioner Goodman has cited in both of his briefs to\nthis Court, out of the Seventh Circuit, called Love\nagainst Westville Correctional Facility -- comes out of\nIndiana -- and this case is a great example of why,\nJustice Breyer, the Turner against -- the Turner\nagainst Safley integration into the reasonableness\nprovisions of ADA Title II won't work, and isn't\ncongruent and proportional, because --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is that case cited\nsomewhere?\nMR. CASTANIAS: It is. It's in both the --\nPetitioner Goodman's opening and reply briefs. In the\nLove case -- and this is -- this is a law-school exam\ncase, because the prisoner put forth his case, in the\nState of Indiana, while it was pre-Yeskey, nonetheless\nagreed that the ADA applied to the prison and, at the\nsame time, didn't present any evidence. And the\nprisoner won the case. And they won the case, because\nall the State did is articulate reasons, like there was\n-- it would cost too much. And this court very clearly\nsaid, \"Look, you didn't put any evidence. You lose.\"\nNow, that's what -- that was one of the fundamental\nfactors that caused this Court to find, in both Kimel\nand Garrett, the statutes unconstitutional, because the\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But maybe in the prison\nsetting, the lower courts would pay some attention to\nthe Court's recent decision in Cutter against\nWilkinson, where the Court made it very clear that a\nhigh level of deference -- even dealing with a strict-\nscrutiny standard for religious freedom -- that a high\nlevel of deference would be paid to prison\nadministrators' judgment of what safety and discipline\nrequires inside a prison. Wouldn't that -- wouldn't\nthat carry over to the ADA, were it to apply?\nMR. CASTANIAS: You --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We could say that --\nMR. CASTANIAS: But you --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- in this opinion. I mean,\nthat would make it happen, wouldn't it?\nMR. CASTANIAS: You could -- I mean, you\ncould absolutely say it. You -- the Court can say\nanything it wants here. But the problem is, is that\nthis was -- this was one of the fundamental problems\nwith ADA Title I --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you think that the --\nMR. CASTANIAS: -- and with the ADEA --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that if the prison\nexplained what their practices were, in terms of the\nneeds of security, that a lower court will then say,\n\"Well, never mind that. The Supreme Court just said\nit. We don't have to enforce it\"? I don't think there\nwould be that kind of lawlessness.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, I'm -- I -- Justice\nGinsburg, were -- if this Court were to uphold the\ndamages remedy in this case, this would be what the\nStates would be left to argue. And in -- while it is\ntrue that you have said, in a couple of recent cases,\nthat strict scrutiny is not quite as fatal, in fact, as\nusual, that strict-scrutiny case that you're referring\nto is the true exception in the prison context, where\nstrict scrutiny was applied. And it involved the very\nimportant, very core Fourteenth Amendment right against\nracial discrimination.\nHere, we're talking about a statute that was\nframed by Congress as basically trying to change the\nCleburne rule, trying to bring an added level of\nscrutiny to claims, equal-protection- --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's interesting --\nMR. CASTANIAS: -- -type claims.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that you cite that\ncase, in terms of Justice Scalia's remark, \"Watch what\nwe do, not what we say.\" Cleburne was a remarkable\ncase in that respect. It purported to apply rational-\nbasis review, but the plaintiffs won.\nMR. CASTANIAS: That's exactly right, Justice\nGinsburg. And, in fact, the reason that the plaintiffs\nwon is that the State, in that case, the State\ndefendants, offered four reasons, all of which were\nfound to be not legitimate State reasons. It was a\nstraightforward application of the rational- --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if you think --\nMR. CASTANIAS: -- -basis test.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- if you think of the --\nany conceivable basis -- doesn't even have to be\noffered if the -- if it's, indeed, the rational-basis\ntest. It has been suggested that something more is\ngoing on in Cleburne, and, I think, in all candor, one\nwould have to say so. Because if you looked at the\nrational-basis test that had gone before, this one\nlooked no better, no worse.\nMR. CASTANIAS: I think that the Tennessee\nSolicitor General Moore, at the end of the Lane\nargument, said, \"We have to take the Court as -- for\nwhat it does say.\" And it said it was applying\nrational-basis scrutiny in that case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Castanias, suppose the\nCourt agrees with you that the response here is not\nproportionate, and, hence, that the prophylactic\naspects of this statute are invalid. There remains the\nfact that the statute covers actual constitutional\nviolations for which you don't need any special\nproportionality. Certainly, the Government can allow\nthe States to be sued for constitutional violations.\nAnd the plaintiff here claims that some of the acts\nhe's seeking damages for do amount to constitutional\nviolations. How can we possibly say that that suit\ndoes not lie?\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, I think, Your Honor,\nthere are two answers to that. First of all is,\nSection 1983 already did that. And the reason that\nthat -- that may not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't lie damages here.\nCan you get damages under 1983?\nMR. CASTANIAS: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Against the State?\nMR. CASTANIAS: You can get it against State\nofficers acting --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: State officers don't have\nany money.\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We're talking about damages\nagainst the State.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, you cannot get damages\nagainst the State --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Under --\nMR. CASTANIAS: -- under Section --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- 1983 --\nMR. CASTANIAS: -- 1983, that's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- absolutely.\nMR. CASTANIAS: -- right. That is exactly\nright. But the other answer, Justice Scalia, is that\nto get to that result -- and I think it's remarkable\nthat both Petitioners' counsel stood up here, and the\nway they framed the question was, \"This is just\nremedial for these actual constitutional violations in\nprison.\" To get to that result, you would have to\nrewrite the ADA in a way that would make the\nreasonable-modification or reasonable-accommodations\nprovision basically an empty vessel to put whatever\nconstitutional law you want in --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, I mean the portions\nthat go beyond constitutional violations are no good.\nI'm not -- I'm not going to read it unrealistically so\nthat it only includes constitutional violations. But,\nto the extent that it includes constitutional\nviolations, why isn't that lawsuit perfectly okay?\nMR. CASTANIAS: Let me -- let me -- let me\npause for a second and think about that. The -- I\nthink the problem with that -- my instinct is that\nthere is a problem with that, and I think the problem\nwith that -- not just because, Your Honor, I represent\nthe State -- but I think the problem with that is that\nit is, in no way, congruent to the constitutional\nrights. In other words, what it's doing is, it's\ngiving, only to a limited class of prisoners, a\nparticular set of rights. In a way, this is the --\nthis is the underbreadth argument that we made in our\nbrief that the -- that the Petitioners, in their\nreplies, made fun of a little bit. But, quite\nhonestly, this is -- this -- it would be giving\ndisabled inmates -- making them into a special class\nfor purposes of constitutional violations that don't\napply just to disabled inmates at all. Quite the ---\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's --\nMR. CASTANIAS: -- contrary --\nJUSTICE BREYER: This is true. This is\nexactly the point I had asked about before. This is a\nbetter point. Because I thought that bridge was --\nthat -- was crossed in Lane. That is, I don't see how\nyou can say that Lane was not giving -- saying it's\nconstitutional to have prophylactic rules. And that's\nwhy I raised the reporter. I've never heard of a First\nAmendment right of a paper to send a particular\nreporter. I mean, if there's a disabled reporter who\ncouldn't get into the courtroom, I guess they could\nsend a different reporter. Maybe that's a First\nAmendment right, but I have not heard of it. So, I\nthought that, really, Lane is saying, \"You can sweep,\nwithin the prophylactic rules, a lot of things that are\nnot, in fact, constitutional violations, but simply\ndiscrimination against disabled people.\"\nMR. CASTANIAS: I think, Justice Breyer, with\nregard to Lane, the right that was at issue was not the\nright of the paper to send a reporter, it was the right\nof the reporter --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I think there is a First\nAmendment right for a newspaper, for example, to send a\nparticular reporter to the courtroom. That's an\ninteresting question. I never thought of that one. I\n--\nMR. CASTANIAS: No, actually, Justice --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- you don't think Lane\nstands for the proposition of their prophylactic rules\nbeing perfectly legitimate under the Eleventh\nAmendment, where you have a set of constitutional\nviolations?\nMR. CASTANIAS: Justice Breyer, I think -- I\nthink I either misstated my answer to you, because I\nwas trying to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I was asking --\nMR. CASTANIAS: I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm --\nMR. CASTANIAS: Let me try to answer that and\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. CASTANIAS: -- say to you that I think,\nfirst of all, the First Amendment right that was at\nissue there was the general right that's possessed by\nthe public to attend court proceedings, not just a\nright that was inherent in the newspaper or the -- a\nright that was prophylactically being exercised there.\nJustice Kennedy, you asked the Petitioner's\ncounsel about alternative remedies here, and I think\nthere's an important point to make with regard to Title\nIII of the ADA, and that's the title of the ADA that\napplies, not to public entities, as we have here, like\nthe State prison, but the title that applies to public\naccommodations, like restaurants and hotels. And it's\nimportant to note, I think, that, in that title,\nCongress did not provide for money-damages remedies.\nQuite the contrary, it provided for an Attorney General\naction, and it provided for injunctive relief. And so,\nthe notion that States somehow are special and should\nbe the ones that get damages against them for violating\nthe -- violating access rights is, in words that the\nCourt has used -- in Boerne and the cases following it,\nthat is a real indignity to the States. And, beyond\nthat, the standard that applies --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, presumably,\nthat's because the prisoners don't have a lot of choice\nas to which accommodations they're going to select.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. CASTANIAS: I'm not sure, Mr. Chief\nJustice, that it follows that damage -- that damages\nfollow from that observation. And I think, with regard\nto the choices that are available to prisons, much has\nbeen made in this case about the affirmative\nobligations of the State to provide the minimum\nstandards of health and safety for prisoners. And I'd\npoint out that, in the Court's decision in DeShaney --\nspecifically, footnote 7 -- the former Chief Justice\nwrote for the Court that, in determining both the scope\nand how to satisfy those, there is an enormous amount\nof discretion imposed in the State. So, it's hard to\nsay that that provision is allowing for -- that\nminimal affirmative burden that's on the State is in\nany way congruent with the broad affirmative remedies\nthat are at stake in this case.\nNow, if I could just go through, very\nquickly, the various constitutional rights that are\nbeing addressed here by the -- that are being claimed\nhere by the Petitioner, you can see, in each case, why\nit's not a proportional and congruent remedy to use\nTitle II of the ADA to enforce them.\nFirst of all, with regard to the Equal\nProtection Clause, it's almost obvious, from the\nfindings of Congress, that they meant to impose a\nhigher degree of scrutiny. By citing the words of\nCarolene Products, as well as Matthews against Lucas,\nthat's -- have justified heightened scrutiny to apply\nto the disabled, this is almost proof positive that\nTitle II -- and the ADA, in general -- is changing the\nlevel of constitutional law. It's not enforcing; it's\nchanging the law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that just proves that\nthey went too far. It doesn't prove that, to the\nextent that it covers a constitutional violation, it's\nokay. We will say the excess is bad.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, Justice Scalia, I think\nthe answer to that comes back to Kimel and Garrett.\nThe excessive change in the constitutional law was held\nto have crossed the line in that case. And here, we\nhave the same problems. We have the changing of the\nburdens. We have the changing of the level of\nscrutiny. And we have the efforts, the same efforts\nthat were used in Kimel and Garrett --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think --\nMR. CASTANIAS: -- to make --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- the level of scrutiny\napplied in Cleburne was precisely the same rational-\nbasis level that is applied in a lot of other rational-\nbasis cases?\nMR. CASTANIAS: I think it was, Justice\nStevens, because you can only talk about the\nconceivable remedies in the context of what the State\nputs forth. And perhaps a creative judge could say,\n\"Aha, but that's the State -- you didn't think about\nthis one.\" And the fact that Justice White's opinion -\n- I think it was Justice White's opinion for the court\nin Cleburne -- didn't go on and think about four other\nconceivable bases, I don't think is a fault of the\ndecision-making process at all.\nWith regard to the Petitioner's efforts to\nenforce the guarantee against cruel and unusual\npunishment, there is no intent standard in the ADA at\nall. In fact, this would scrub out the deliberate-\nindifference standard entirely, and, in the -- at least\nGoodman's reply brief, he admits that that basically\nwould be what would happen. He says that would be\nappropriate prophylaxis. I think that is an\nastonishing claim in this case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we go back, Mr.\nCastanias, to Justice Scalia's question about the core\nconcerns? And we have been told by Respondents that\ntheir core concerns are sanitation, mobility,\nprotection from physical injury. Now, that sounds to\nme like constitutional Eighth Amendment heartland.\nMR. CASTANIAS: And in that case, Justice\nGinsburg, if I could just briefly --\nMR. CASTANIAS: -- conclude? In that case,\nJustice Ginsburg, the Constitution, through Section\n1983, does provide a remedy. It will provide a remedy\nthat will get the prison to stop that.\nIf there are no other questions, we'd ask\nthat the judgment be affirmed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMr. Schaerr, we'll hear now from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GENE C. SCHAERR,\nFOR AMICI CURIAE, TENNESSEE, ET AL.,\nIN SUPPORT OF RESPONDENTS\nMR. SCHAERR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nLet me begin by attempting to answer Justice\nScalia's questions -- question about the Rehabilitation\nAct. My understanding is that the key difference\nbetween the Rehabilitation Act and Title II is that --\nis that the Rehabilitation Act requires intentional\nconduct, which, obviously, is a much -- a much higher\nstandard.\nInstead of dwelling on the record offered in\nsupport of Title II -- and we agree with Georgia that\nthe record was not sufficient -- I'd like to focus on\nthe congruence and proportionality requirements, which\nare quite separate from the record requirement, and\nwhich we believe are independently dispositive in this\ncase, for two separate reasons.\nBut, first, I think it's important to recall\nthe two key purposes that the congruence-and-\nproportionality analysis serves. One of those, as the\nCourt has reiterated, is to prevent Section 5 from\nbecoming a kind of police power through which Congress\ncan regulate the States and impose litigation and other\nburdens on them as though they were mere corporations.\nThe second purpose, of course, is ensuring\nthat the specific remedies that Congress chooses, and\nespecially the abrogation of sovereign immunity --\nsovereign immunity that this Court has held is within\nCongress's Section 5 power, are a measured response to\nCongress's legitimate goals. And that's obviously\nimportant, because of the -- of the -- of the tension\nbetween the Section 5 power, on the one hand, and the\nEleventh Amendment and other provisions of the\nConstitution that protect --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I just --\nMR. SCHAERR: -- the State's sovereignty.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- be sure I understand\nthis point?\nMR. SCHAERR: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Are you, in fact, arguing\nthat the statute might be -- I know you don't agree\nwith it -- might be proportionate and congruent with\nrespect to all of its prohibitions, but, to the extent\nit provides for a damage remedy, then it crosses the\nline?\nMR. SCHAERR: I do believe that the statute\ncould be invalidated on that ground alone, but I don't\nthink the Court needs to do that, because I think it's\nclearly not congruent with constitutional requirements.\nAnd let -- and I believe there are --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But --\nMR. SCHAERR: -- four reasons for that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But is that -- it --\nbecause it has a damage remedy, or would it be equally\nnoncongruent without the damage remedy? That's what\nI'm trying --\nMR. SCHAERR: I --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm following up on Justice\nKennedy's question to your colleague.\nMR. SCHAERR: Well, the way -- the way I\nwould view it is that the damage remedy is\ndisproportionate to Congress's legitimate goals in this\ncase, for a couple of reasons. Number one, as in -- as\nin Florida Prepaid and some of this -- some of this\nCourt's other decisions, the abrogation of sovereign\nimmunity is not limited to the specific areas that\nCongress and the courts have identified as the greatest\nconcern, from a constitutional standpoint. And, number\ntwo, the abrogation of sovereign immunity is not\nlimited to the States, or categories of States, where\nthere has been a finding of unconstitutional action.\nSo, we do think that that would be a sufficient basis\nto invalidate this statute's abrogation of sovereign\nimmunity, but we also think that the statute is not at\nall congruent with the requirements of the\nConstitution. And, as --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. --\nMR. SCHAERR: -- I said, I think there are\nfour reasons for that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Schaerr, before you go\non, may I just ask you one question on the point that\nyou made -- and you made it in the brief -- about the\nfailure to establish a -- some kind of a history of\nunconstitutional action in this particular State? Do I\nunderstand you to claim that that is a -- that a record\nof some sort must be made by Congress? Or can a record\nof that sort be made in the courts, in the course of\nlitigation, as a predicate for a particular lawsuit\nlike this one?\nMR. SCHAERR: Well, City of Boerne and other\ncourts -- other decisions of this Court say that, to be\na valid exercise of Congress's Section 5 authority, it\nhas to be a response to a record of constitutional\nviolations.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right, but Congress --\nMR. SCHAERR: And it's hard for me to --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- but Congress normally\noperates on a -- on a national scale --\nMR. SCHAERR: True.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- so that, I mean, we -- I\nguess, we would normally say, \"Well, you can show 40\nStates out of 50 were in trouble. That's probably good\nenough to get you across the line, at least.\" But\nyou're not saying that. So, are you saying that\nCongress has got to make the record with respect to\neach individual State?\nMR. SCHAERR: No, I'm not claiming that\nCongress necessarily has to make the record, but I\nbelieve the record has to have been created before\nCongress acts; otherwise, the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So, it could be done --\nMR. SCHAERR: -- legislation isn't --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- it could be done --\nMR. SCHAERR: -- a response --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- in the litigation of this\ncase, then. There could be a trial record of prior\nviolations.\nMR. SCHAERR: No, I -- I don't think the\nrecord in this case would satisfy it, because this --\nbecause --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but my question is,\nWhere does the record have to be made? Does Congress\nhave to make it, on a State-by-State basis, or may that\nrecord be made in the course of a trial in a particular\nState as a predicate for subjecting that State to\nliability in this instance?\nMR. SCHAERR: Well, this Court's decisions\nsuggest that the record has to at least have been\nwithin Congress's awareness at the time the statute was\npassed.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So that Congress could have\nknown this, whether they specifically adverted to it,\nor not. That would be sufficient.\nMR. SCHAERR: I think that's correct.\nAgain, four reasons why Title II is not\ncongruent with the -- with the requirements of the\nConstitution. First, as in Garrett, the substantive\naccommodation duty imposed by Title II far exceeds the\nrequirements of the Constitution. And to see why, we\nneed look no further than Mr. Goodman's complaints that\nare in the Joint Appendix, the Government's Addendum C,\nand the Justice Department's implementing regulations,\nwhich are found at 28 C.F.R. Section 35.130(b). And if\nyou -- if you look at Mr. Goodman's complaint, yes,\nthere are some allegations there that obviously raise\nconstitutional issues, but there are a lot of\nallegations that clearly state a claim under the\nJustice Department's interpretation of Title II, but,\nequally clearly, don't raise constitutional issues.\nFor example, on page 65, he has a claim seeking to make\nthe TV lounge and other entertainment facilities\nwheelchair accessible. Pages 53, 57, and 82, he makes\na claim for better access to recreation facilities,\nrehabilitative exercises, and physical therapy. At\npage 64 of the Joint Appendix, he makes a claim to\nforce the State to install wheelchair-accessible\nbathrooms.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I'm saying this to help\nyou. I'd love to get reason two. I'm wondering --\n[Laughter.]\nMR. SCHAERR: Okay.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even if they're bad, why\naren't the other ones good?\nMR. SCHAERR: Well, in order to abrogate the\nState's sovereign immunity, there has to have been a\nvalid exercise of Congress's power, and there has to be\na statute that represents a valid exercise of that\npower; otherwise, there's no basis for subjecting the\nStates to liability. So, I don't think it's enough\njust to say, \"Maybe there -- maybe there is an Eighth\nAmendment claim here that's legitimate, and maybe,\ntherefore, in this case, the State's sovereign immunity\ncan be abrogated.\" It has to be done pursuant to a\nlegitimate exercise of Congress's power.\nReason number two, Justice Kennedy, is that,\nas in Boerne and Garrett, even where constitutional\nissues are implicated, Title II effectively imposes\nheightened scrutiny on many decisions that are subject\nto rational-basis review under the Constitution -- for\nexample, access to the law library, religious services,\nassociational rights, those sorts of things. And that,\nI think, is the key distinction between this case and\nLane and Hibbs. And so, as the Court put it in\nGarrett, even with the undue-burden exception, the\nstatute makes unlawful a range of alternative responses\nthat would be reasonable under the Constitution, but\nwould fall short of imposing an undue burden on the\nemployer.\nNumber three, as in Garrett, Title II\nprohibits standards and criteria that have a disparate\nimpact on the disabled, even though that obviously\nwouldn't be enough to establish a constitutional\nviolation if the disabled were a suspect class. And,\nagain, the Court need only look at the Justice\nDepartment's regulations to see how they impose a\ndisparate-impact requirement.\nAnd, fourth, again, as in Kimel and Garrett,\nTitle II reverses the burden of proof. As the Court\nheld in Garrett, under the Constitution,\nclassifications based on disability are prima facie --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why isn't all that\ntrue of Lane? Everything you've said is also true of\nthe prophylactic part of Lane. I mean, I've never\nheard that people took seriously -- though maybe they\nshould have -- but, before the ADA, I have never heard\nthere was a constitutional right of a disabled person\nto go to a courthouse on the second floor. There were\nsecond-floor courthouses all over the country. I don't\nknow that was true of the bathrooms. I don't know it\nwas true of a lot of things in courthouses. So, I\nthink your argument could be made in schools,\ncourthouses, all over the place. And I take it that\nLane said, \"Prophylaxis\" -- whatever the word is -- \"of\nthat sort\" --\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- \"is fine under Title II,\ngiven a core of constitutional violations.\" So, how do\nyou distinguish them that?\nMR. SCHAERR: Well, I think it -- one of the\nways is the one -- is the one I just mentioned a --\nmentioned a minute ago. It's -- Lane was certainly\ndealing with rights that have been considered by --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You mean --\nMR. SCHAERR: -- the Court --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- beyond a --\nMR. SCHAERR: -- to be --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- the average public, you\nhad a constitutional right? I mean, you might have. I\nmight be surprised. But, interesting.\nMR. SCHAERR: Well, I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The average person could\nhave brought a lawsuit, a person in a wheelchair, and\nsaid, \"All the courthouses in this country, or in this\ncounty, are on the second floor, and moreover the\nbathrooms -- I need a special bathroom,\" and they would\nhave won without the ADA. Why did we need the ADA,\nthen?\nMR. SCHAERR: Well, I'm not sure the claim --\nI'm not sure, Justice Breyer, that the claim of the\nperson who wanted access to the courthouse to serve as\na reporter was necessary to the result in Lane in all\nof that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Ah. Ah, you're saying -- I\n-- what I just heard was, it's -- the reporter just was\na stand-in for the average person, that the average\nperson had these constitutional rights, which may have\nbeen a --\nMR. SCHAERR: I think that would be one way\nof understanding it, though not the only way.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nSchaerr.\nGeneral Clement, you have four minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN 04-1203\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nBefore I say anything else, I want to just\nclarify that the scope of the Rehab Act and Title II is\nreally coextensive. Mr. Schaerr made a reference to\nthe fact that you need intentional conduct under the\nRehab Act. I think that was true for a while in the\nlower courts with respect to damages claims. I think\nafter this Court's decision in Gebser, in the context\nof damages claims, the lower courts have generally\nrequired deliberate indifference both in the\nRehabilitation Act context and in the Title II Act\ncontext, to the extent they've reached the issue. But\nwith respect to the substantive obligations, they\nreally are identical. And I do think that's important,\nin a couple of ways.\nIn particular, I think it's worth remembering\nhere that the damages remedy in Title II -- and this is\ndifferent than Title I, where there was a specific\nprovision for back-pay -- but in Title II, the damages\nremedy is just an incorporation of the damages remedy\navailable under the Rehab Act, which, in turn,\nincorporates Title VI and Title IX remedies. And\nthose, of course, are entirely judge-made.\nAnd so, one of the things this Court\nrecognized in Gebser, in deciding there had to be\ndeliberate indifference for a compensatory-damages\nclaim, is, this Court said, the judge-made nature of\nthose remedies gives the court a particularly free hand\nin making those remedies make sense, in terms of the\nstatute, and, I would think, a fortiori, in terms of\nthe Constitution. So, if --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: General, when you --\nearlier, you told us that this doesn't add much to the\nConstitution, in Turner versus Safley, and then we hear\nabout access to the TV lounge, which doesn't sound like\na constitutional deliberate-indifference Eighth\nAmendment claim. I mean, if it's important to us how\nmuch of this applies, how do we address that issue?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, let me address the\nspecter of all these claims for TV access, because I do\nthink that that's something that can be taken care of\nin any number of respects. One is, a sensible\napplication of Turner-type principles to the\nreasonable-modification standard can certainly be done\nin a way to weed out those claims. I also think --\nespecially given Justice Kennedy's principal concern\nwith damages, I think here's an area where the PLRA is\nparticularly helpful, because I don't know what kind of\nphysical injury you're going to be able to show to\nbeing denied access to the TV room. And since that's\nwhat you need to show under the PLRA in order to\nrecover any damages for mental and emotional suffering\nthat I suppose you could try to bring a claim for\nemotional suffering for not seeing TV -- I'm not sure\nwhich way that would cut -- but, in any event --\n[Laughter.]\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- I think, in those\ncontexts, the PLRA is the gateway you need to some\nphysical injury, so I think that's going to help weed\nthese out as a matter of damages claims. And so, I\nthink that's going to have a helpfulness, too.\nAlso, I think, in some -- in some sense, you\ncan't lose sight of the fact that perhaps the reason\nthat somebody's being denied access to the TV room is\nbecause they're in a wheelchair on the second floor,\nand the TV room and the law library and the religious\nservices and everything else they need in the prison is\non the first floor. And, in those contexts, it may be\nan appropriate degree of prophylaxis.\nBut I guess what I would say is, I would\nthink that this Court would want to interpret the PL- -\n- I'm sorry, would want to interpret Title II in a way\nthat avoids constitutional problems, rather than in a\nway that engenders it. And so, to the extent the\naccess to the TV room is critical to the\nconstitutionality of the statute, I think the\nreasonable-modification standard provides plenty of\ntools to apply Turner-type principles and ameliorate\nthe constitutional problems.\nI mean, if you compared this case with Cutter\nagainst Wilkinson from last term, there you had a\nstatutory strict-scrutiny standard that was\nspecifically directed at the prisons in one other\ncontext. And, nonetheless, this Court said, \"That can\nbe applied with Turner deference-type principles.\"\nHere, you have a statute that applies\nbroadly, and I would think it would be a very easy act\nof interpretation and constitutional avoidance to say\nthat, \"In the prison context, we're going to interpret\nin a way that avoids constitutional difficulties.\"\nIf I could try to address just one or two\nspecific questions -- Justice Souter, you asked about\nthe practical experience of the Federal Government.\nAnd, as we point out in our opening brief, at page 45,\nit's been less than 1 percent of our litigation, and\nless than 2 percent of our compliance cost.\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\n"
