UNDERWOOD\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nUnder the OCC regulation at issue here,\nState antidiscrimination and consumer protection laws\ncan be enforced against national banks by the Federal\nOCC and by private parties, but not by State attorneys\ngeneral. This unusual enforcement pre-emption, which\ndetaches the State's power to make laws from its power\nto enforce them, was not written into the National Bank\nAct by Congress in 1864, and it's implausible that\nCongress implicitly delegated to OCC the power to read\nit in now.\nWe know the NBA did not in 1864 enact\nenforcement pre-emption against the States for three\nreasons: First, the words of the statute; second, a\nlong line of cases from this Court, especially St.\nLouis, upholding the power of the State to enforce laws\nagainst a national bank or rejecting it on the ground\nthat the law was substantively pre-empted, but not\nquestioning the power of the State to enforce a valid\nlaw; and, finally, the wholly anomalous character,\nforeign really to our structure of government, of\nseparating the power to make law from the power to\nenforce it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But to some extent, would\nyou concede that interpretation; that is, not only the\nattorney general under New York's law, but the\nsuperintendent of banks as well, has authority over\nmortgage lending? Would -- would you agree that the\npart about the bank superintendent's enforcement could\nnot be enforced against national banks?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, first of all, the bank\nsuperintendent in New York doesn't have authority over\nnational banks. It has authority only over State banks,\nas we pointed out in our reply brief. So we don't\nassert that authority.\nI would say that the -- and the injunction\ndoesn't run -- that's at issue in this case, doesn't run\nagainst the superintendent. It runs against the\nattorney general. But I would say --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is -- the\nprovision that you are talking about, 296(a), concerns\nthe authority of the bank superintendent as well as the\nauthority of the attorney general; isn't that so?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: I believe that the banking\nsuperintendent does not assert authority to enforce in a\nregulatory fashion against national banks. If they did,\nif -- if -- if the bank superintendent asserted a\nchartering or licensing supervisory regime, that would\nbe a different issue from the question --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Just with respect to the\nsame issue on mortgage lending where there's a concern\nabout racial discrimination?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, the -- the bank -- the\nbanking superintendent of New York does not enforce\nagainst national banks.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Anything? And you agree\nto that?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Yes, that is right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Even if the New York\nstatute --\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Read differently or\ninterpreted or applied differently.\nWhat's at issue here is a distinction\nbetween a supervisory regime -- \"visitation\" is a regime\ncharacterized by routine examinations, no cause needed,\nby a chartering or a licensing authority for the purpose\nof enforcing limitations on --\nJUSTICE BREYER: How is it supposed to work?\nThis is what is bothering me at the heart of this case.\nI imagine that banks, particularly right in these last\nfew months, are in situations where there are three\ncategories of -- of borrowers. One might be a category\nof people whom you are reasonably confident in, and the\nsecond is a category of people who are borderline or\nless so, and there are also minorities.\nNow, where you make the decision as a bank\nto deny them the loan, it sometimes is difficult to say\nwhether that decision was made for a discriminatory\nreason, namely race, or for a legitimate reason, namely\nbecause this was a person unlikely to pay the money\nback.\nNow, how is a bank to function if 50\ndifferent attorneys general plus the Federal agencies\nall look at the books of the bank to look at the\nindividual loan and to make that kind of determination\nabout which quite honestly reasonable people will often\ndiffer?\nAnd how -- how is that really a problem, or\nam I just creating that? And if it's really a problem,\nhow in your opinion does the Federal law deal with that\nproblem, if not in the way that your opponent suggests?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, an -- there is a\nsingle standard of discrimination. It is the case that\nthe -- that the Federal standards applied by the OCC and\nthe State law all look to Title VII law about a prima\nfacie case being --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If I may say so, that\nresponse overlooks the question. I don't doubt the\nsingle standard. What I do doubt is in the -- in the\ncategory of uncertain cases, that 51 different\nindividuals, 50 State attorneys general plus one Federal\nindividual, will reach the same result.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: These are hard and,\ntherefore, they will reach a lot of different results\nunder the same standard.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: There has been no such\nmultiplicity of -- of enforcement. In fact, there is so\nmuch antidiscrimination work to go around that having\nmultiple enforcers is a device for --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So you deny the\nhypothetical. You are saying that my analysis of the\nproblem is wrong; there simply is no such problem, and\nsince there is no such problem, it doesn't matter if\neveryone enforces it.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: It is already the case that\nunder the Fair Housing Act, HUD is required to refer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is your answer yes or no to\nwhat I just said, that you deny that the statement of\nthe problem is realistic and therefore there is no\nproblem in your view about having 51 different people\nenforce the same standard.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: There is no record of any\nsuch problem. And should such a -- yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And should such a problem\narise, what?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Should such a problem arise,\nthat would be an occasion for considering a kind of\nburden pre-emption that would be similar -- on evidence\nof such a problem, that might be a basis for OCC to make\na record and enact a regulation to deal with that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But if OCC thought there\nmight be such a problem, couldn't it act in advance to\navoid the risk that Justice Breyer's question explains?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, its regulation doesn't\nsay that. The injunction that was issued in this case\ndoesn't say that. What the regulation, the rulemaking,\nand the injunction all rest on is a legal analysis, not\nan empirical one.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May we clarify one thing\nabout the 50 jurisdictions? The attorney general from\nNew York is not asserting authority over bank lending in\nHawaii. So for each institution, I assume it's going to\nbe two sovereigns, the OCC and the State attorney\ngeneral, not 50 descending on the single -- single bank\nwith respect to particular loans?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: That's correct. And the\nOCC --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's correct\nwith respect to a particular loan. It's not respect --\nwith respect to Federal policy about national banks\naround the country. It's conceivable and I suppose\nlikely that the Federal regulator would want the same\nrule to apply to banks in Michigan as to banks in\nHawaii.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: It is. But if the question\nwas would the -- would the actual act of responding to a\ncomplaint or to discovery burden particular people\nbecause there would be 50 people asking for the same\ninformation, that's not the case, because the loans made\nin New York would be analyzed by a New York enforcer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I want to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. The same rule\nwould not apply in Michigan and Hawaii, anyway, even\nunder the Federal Government. The Federal Government\nacknowledges that Michigan can have its own law --\nMS. UNDERWOOD: The Federal Government --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- and Hawaii can have a\ndifferent law. All the Federal Government is arguing\nis: We want to be the ones to enforce the separate\nMichigan law and the separate Hawaii law, right?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: That appears to be the case.\nIn fact, they have acknowledged that the State law\nactually applies. It's undisputed. OCC said so in its\ncomplaint. Congress has several times said so, which is\npresumably why the OCC says so -- said so in the Fair\nHousing Act savings clause, in the -- in the Equal\nCredit Opportunity Act savings clause, and in\nRiegle-Neal, which specifically applies only to national\nbank branches, but expressly preserves the application\nof State fair lending and consumer protection laws.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You are just at the point\nof getting to what I -- the blank in my mind. And the\nblank in my mind is when you said, but if there were\nsuch a problem, as I had described, but if there were,\nthen they could -- and now that's the blank. Then they\ncould what?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, there are many things\nthat they might do.\nJUSTICE BREYER: For example, just give me\ntwo, a couple.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: For example, make some\nprovision for -- in fact, I believe there are some\nregulations that call for conferencing and collaboration\nand consultation among the State enforcers and between\nthe State and Federal regulators to avoid duplicative\nregulation. There is already the potential with respect\nto State banks that are supervised both by State\nregulators and by the FDIC. There are alternate audits\nin alternate years. I mean, there -- there is plenty of\nprecedent in bank regulation for mechanisms for\nconsultation and collaboration so that people don't step\non each other's toes.\nAnd in Federal criminal enforcement, for\nexample, there are -- there are many -- many occasions\nwhere there is both Federal and State authority to\nenforce. And the result of that tends to be to get more\nextensive, fuller enforcement. People don't tend to\nboth bring the same case. If somebody is enforcing\nsomething, somebody -- a different enforcer will attack\na different problem.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the -- in the -- in the\ngeneral -- in the field of criminal enforcement\ngenerally there isn't any provision comparable to what\nis now 36(f)(1)(B), at least to my knowledge, and it's\nset out on pages 46 and 47, the text is in the\ngovernment's brief: \"The provisions of any State law to\nwhich a branch of a national bank is subject under this\nparagraph shall be enforced with respect to such branch\nby the OCC.\"\nAnd that mandate, it \"shall be enforced with\nrespect to such branch\" sounds pretty exclusive to me.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You can't tell for sure.\nBut why would -- why would Congress, number one, if\nit -- if Congress simply assumed that there would be\na -- a dual system of enforcement, that OCC could --\ncould say to the bank, you follow State law, and if you\ndon't, we are going to go after you administratively,\nand leaving it to the State to go after, in any other\nfashion, what State law provided. If that was\nCongress's assumption, why would it have -- have passed\nthis seeming mandate, \"shall be enforced with respect to\nsuch branch\" by the -- by the OCC?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: There are two reasons for\nthat provision. The purpose of that provision was to\nconfirm that OCC didn't lose its pre-existing\nenforcement power when Riegle-Neal stated -- that's (1)\n(B) -- in (1)(A) that national branches would be treated\nmore or less like State branches for purposes of\nconsumer protection and fair lending.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that -- that's, in\neffect, saving clause kind of function could have been\nperformed simply by a statute that says OCC may. And\nthis says it shall be enforced by OCC.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: There is another reason in\nthe legislative history, which makes it clear that it\nwas a directive to OCC to mount an enforcement program\nwhich Congress thought it had not been doing. We know\nthat because in the conference report and other\nlegislative history Congress says it's trying to expand,\nnot contract, the enforcement of fair lending and\nconsumer protection laws, and that the law isn't taking\nany authority away from the States and that they are\ndistressed at the inadequate failure of OCC to exercise\nits enforcement authority.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't deny, do you,\nthat the Federal Government can, if it wishes, enforce\nthe State laws?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So this provision isn't\nreally contrary to what you are saying. You are just\nsaying the State can do it as well?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: That's correct. It isn't\ntalking -- it doesn't say anything about exclusive\nauthority, and it isn't talking about judicial\nenforcement, which OCC doesn't do. It is talking about\nit's -- it has a savings clause kind of function and\nit -- it's hortatory, it's directing OCC to exercise the\nauthority that it has.\nIt seems to be common ground that it didn't\ngive OCC any new power, because it would be odd to give\nOCC different power over the branches -- this only\napplies to the branches -- different power to the\nbranches than over the branches than over the banks,\ndifferent, more extensive power over consumer protection\nand fair lending than other kinds of bank enforcement.\nThis was a provision dealing with branches and consumer\nprotection and fair lending that said to OCC: You still\nhave that authority and you should exercise it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But we come to the New\nYork Attorney General. I see your argument that there's\na certain incongruity between saying private attorneys\ngeneral okay, but no public attorney general. But on\nthe other hand, the attorney general starts out by\nasking for bank books and records. And high on the list\nof visitorial powers is the authority to demand the\nbank's books and records.\nSo why isn't that -- his preliminary\ninvestigation at least, why doesn't that fit within the\nvisitorial power bundle?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, because you can look\nat books and records under various authorities. Books\nand -- you can look at books and records under your\nvisitorial authority, if you are the supervisor and have\nthe relationship to the bank that a licensing or\nchartering authority has and you are looking at them for\nno particular cause. Or you can look at books and\nrecords if you have a civil suit against the bank and\nyou are engaging in discovery that is -- or for that\nmatter a criminal prosecution against the bank, and\nancillary to that discovery is required; or in Guthrie,\nthe inquiry -- the looking at books and records was\npursuant to a statutory authority for shareholders to\nlook at books and records.\nSo the simple fact of a physical act of\nlooking -- or a legal act of looking at books and\nrecords doesn't tell you whether visitorial authority is\nbeing exercised. Visitorial authority has long been\nunderstood as a whole regime of oversight. Watters\ninvolved a visitorial regime that was ancillary to\nlicensing. The earlier visitorial regimes that were\nreferenced in the old treatise tended to involve\nvisitorial regimes that were established ancillary to\nchartering, back when corporate charters had limited\npurposes, the way banks do still, but most corporate\ncharters, most corporate certificates of incorporation\ndon't anymore.\nSo the fact that books and records are being\nexamined is neither here nor there on the question\nwhether the visitorial power that is referenced in 484\nis -- is being exercised.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There is an historic\nreason for thinking that Congress would be more\nconcerned about States exercising visitorial powers than\nthey would be about private attorneys general or private\nlawyers. This goes back to McCulloch v. Maryland.\nNational banks were always targeted by the States. They\nweren't typically targeted by private attorneys. So\nthat incongruity doesn't strike me as terribly\nsignificant.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, the suggestion is made\nthat 484, and there is some historical basis for it, was\n-- was meant to protect national banks against --\nagainst, hostile States, which I guess is what you are\nsuggesting, rather than hostile private people. But\nactually what it was meant to do was assign\nresponsibility for the supervision of these new\nentities -- there hadn't been banks like this, private\nbanks which were nevertheless federally chartered.\nBefore that there was the National Bank that was at\nissue in McCulloch v Maryland, and to exclude the States\nfrom asserting the authority to do audits, to do regular\nbanking examinations, which actually one senator had\nproposed the States be permitted to do and that was\nrejected.\nI would say the concern about State\nhostility was apparently much reduced by 1869, not much\nafter this statute was passed, when this Court in\nNational Bank v. Kentucky upheld the power of the States\nnot just to tax shareholders on their shares, but to\nrequire the national banks to help, to require the\nnational banks to pay the tax that was due from those\nshareholders in order to assist in collection. And the\nCourt -- McCulloch was cited to the Court and the Court\nsaid it saw no possibility here, unlike in McCulloch,\nthat the State would somehow use its authority in this\nway to incapacitate the banks or impair them by\neliciting their help to collect a valid tax.\nThere actually had been some thought when\nthe national banks were first created that they would,\nin the marketplace, drive State banks out of existence,\nbut they didn't. And the story has been one\nlegislatively of maintaining competitive equality\nbetween them, not of hostility. So --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you want to talk\na little bit about Chevron?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Whatever the\narguments may be on the merits, it's not clear to me\nthat visitorial powers has an unambiguous meaning that\nwould pre-empt the authority of the OCC to explain it to\nus.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, I'd say two thing\nabout that. 484 may have some ambiguity about it. I\nthink it is not ambiguous as to the matters covered by\nthis regulation. Visitorials have -- visitorial powers\nhave never been understood to include discrete acts of\nlaw enforcement by a jurisdiction that neither has nor\nasserts supervisory relationship, the kind of\nsupervisory relationship that the chartering or\nlicensing sovereign has. So I think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What do you say about the\nquotations in the -- the brief that Mr. Waxman filed, as\nI recall; it may have been the government's brief --\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- which -- which do have\nreferences to visitorial powers as including general\nconformance to the law. Those are not universal\nprovisions, but they -- they were certainly understood\nin some cases.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, the strongest\nquotations that his brief mentioned several times come\nfrom Blackstone. He talks about inquiring into all\nmisbehaviors of the supervised visited corporation.\nThose comments are made in a time and place when there\nwas only one sovereign, not the distinctive federalism\nwe have today, and so there was no need to distinguish\nbetween the visitorial, the distinctly visitorial powers\nof the sovereign, and the coexisting police powers of\nanother sovereign. There was no --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but there was -- there\nwas a point in -- in distinguishing the visitorial\npowers that Blackstone, in the cases Blackstone was\nreferring to, and those for example that would apply\nsolely to -- to religious or originally religious\nfoundations like Oxford and Cambridge colleges and so\non. So there -- there seems to have been a reason to\nunderstand the distinction.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, I think that the point\nabout Blackstone's comment to distinguish -- the point\nabout the distinction between the charitable\ncorporations and the public non-charitable corporations\nis that it may well be that the sovereign was enforcing\nnot just the charter, but the laws of the sovereign with\nrespect to that State. It simply --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But he didn't need\nvisitorial powers to do that. I mean, the sovereign had\nthat by virtue of the general law.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Yes, but the sovereign might\ndo it in many different -- a supervisor might do it in\nmany different ways, just as OCC here claims to enforce\nlaw not by going into court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that was your\nposition, that the -- that the visitation authority\nincludes the power to enforce general laws.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: The general laws of the\nvisitor, of the sovereign.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of the sovereign. But that\na separate action to enforce the laws of the sovereign\ndoes not necessarily mean that visitorial powers are\nbeing exercised.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: That is correct. That is\ncorrect. That is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So there would be no\ninconsistency, if you believe that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: One thing --\nMS. UNDERWOOD: That's --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: One thing puzzled me about\nthis. They are not pre-empting any New York laws; is\nthat correct?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: They're pre-empting --\nthat's correct. They are preempting our ability to\nenforce any laws.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Did we ever -- do we have\nany precedents dealing with the question whether\npreemption of the right to enforce a valid law is\nappropriate?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, this Court in, for\nexample, St. Louis said that when the Federal and the\nState prohibition were the same, that is, a bank\ncouldn't branch at that time or couldn't interstate\nbranch, the -- and the -- and State tried to enforce\nboth provisions -- they were the same, but the State\ntried to enforce both the Federal charter limitation and\nthe State law, this Court said the State could not\nenforce the Federal charter, because that was the\nprerogative of the chartering visitor, but that it could\nenforce the State prohibition. And it said that\nseparating -- if the law is valid and can be validly\napplied, then it's virtually unthinkable to separate the\nauthority to enforce it from the application of the law.\nThis Court said that in -- in St. Louis; it\n-- actually it said it in -- in Easton, which went the\nother way. That is to say, Easton was a criminal\nprosecution of a bank officer for taking deposits\nknowing the bank was insolvent. Prosecution under State\nlaw. And this Court said that the law itself had to be\npreempted. Wasn't clear exactly what Federal law on the\nsubject was. The Court said there must be some Federal\nlaw in this area, but we can't afford to have\nconflicting laws, so it's substantively pre-empted. But\nthe Court also said, if it were valid, it would be\nunthinkable to bar the State from enforcing it. And\nthat is the correct way, we think, to approach this\nproblem.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is it -- could they --\ncould the Federal authorities pre-empt the State law, in\nyour opinion?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, no, because Congress\nhas said to the contrary. Congress has said, that's why\nthey didn't -- presumably why they didn't do it that\nway. Congress has said State law shall apply. So I\nthink this is an area where Congress clearly had in mind\nthat there would be, not broad pre-emption of this kind,\nbut the laws would apply. But that it --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but -- I'm\nsorry, but it certainly is pre-empted with respect to\nvisitorial powers.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Yes. That is correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This kind of gets us\nback to where we started.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: It does. But think that --\nI would like to -- I'd like to reserve some time for\nrebuttal, if I may.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Stewart.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART\nFOR THE RESPONDENT OFFICE OF\nTHE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY\nMR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nTo explain the threat that the OCC believes\nthe State's enforcement regime poses to the national\nbanking system and OCC's administration of that system,\nI would like to begin by going back to a colloquy\nbetween Ms. Underwood and Justice Breyer near the\nbeginning of the argument.\nAnd Justice Breyer raised the possibility\nthat a myriad of State attorneys general would file --\nwould pursue similar antidiscrimination claims, and Ms.\nUnderwood's response was there really would be no\nproblem because they are all applying the same\nsubstantive standard. And I think at a very high level\nof generality that is so; that is, the Federal statute\nand the State statute both say no discrimination on the\nbasis of race in extensions of credit. But I think when\nyou get to the way in which the statutes are\nadministered, there is at least the potential for\nsignificant differences, because --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait a minute. I --\nthis is state law. And if the State supreme court has\nsaid that the statute means a certain thing and that\ncertain thing is a little bit different from what the\nFederal antidiscrimination law is, I assume that the\nFederal Government in applying State law has to -- has\nto take that difference into account, doesn't it?\nMR. STEWART: We would --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The Federal Government\ndoesn't -- doesn't have the right to alter State law.\nMR. STEWART: The Federal Government\nwouldn't have the right to alter State law. The Federal\nGovernment would have the authority to make its own\nassessment of whether the State law was pre-empted based\nupon those distinctions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought it is a\ngiven in this case -- and tell me if I am wrong on this\n-- that the State substantive law is not pre-empted.\nYou refer, I think, to enforcement pre-emption; that is,\nthe State law is governing law. But the only enforcer\nis Federal authority; and if that's so, is there any\nother -- in all of Federal-State relations, any other\nlaw where the State as sovereign can prescribe but\ncannot enforce?\nMR. STEWART: I give two examples from the\nnational banking system, itself. The first is the\nRiegle-Neal amendments, which Justice Souter was\nalluding to. And the amendments don't simply say that\nOCC shall enforce non-pre-empted State laws. It says\nthat those laws shall be enforced by the Comptroller of\nthe Currency.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But do you -- do you agree\nthat -- that it is possible to read the \"shall\" both as\n-- as an unequivocal grant of power to OCC, but not\nnecessarily as an exclusive ground?\nMR. STEWART: I don't think so with the\n\"shall\" in combination with the passive voice. That is,\nif you had a statute that said a certain category of\nsuits shall be adjudicated by the Court of Federal\nClaims, I think that would mean not simply that the\nCourt of Federal Claims would be required to adjudicate\nthem if a case was brought before it, but I think that\nwould unmistakably identify the Court of Federal Claims\nas the exclusive tribunal --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but if you have a\nsituation in which the OCC, say, has very limited\npersonnel -- they only have ten people in their\nenforcement division, for example -- and Congress\nthought they have to get more, wouldn't it be\nappropriate in that background to say, you shall start\nenforcing? And that wouldn't necessarily mean you are\nexcluding States from also enforcing.\nMR. STEWART: I agree that if the statute\nsimply -- if the statute used the active voice and said\nthe OCC shall enforce these laws, there would be a\nbetter argument that the OCC's authority was not\nexclusive. But when the statute said -- says these laws\nshall be enforced by the Comptroller of the Currency, I\nthink the clear implication is this is the exclusive\nmechanism by which the laws --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see any difference\nwhatever in that regard between using the active and\npassive.\nMR. STEWART: Well, let me give you another\nexample from the national banking system, and that is 12\nU.S.C. 85.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I want you to come back. I\n-- I won't stop -- I don't want to stop you from doing\nthat, but I want to come back to this. Do you -- do you\nwant to go on to your second example, or do you want to\n--\nMR. STEWART: Let me just give you a second\nexample very quickly. 12 U.S.C. section 85, which was\nan issue in Smiley, deals with the maximum rate of\ninterest that national banks may charge, and it says\nthat they may charge as much as the law of the State in\nwhich they are located allows and no more. And that is\na similar system in that to determine the maximum rate\nof interest that the bank may charge, you look to State\nlaw. You defer to the choice of the State legislature,\nbut the enforcement regime with respect to\nadministrative enforcement is exclusively Federal. It's\nonly the Federal authorities that can go after --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's because --\nbecause it's picking a rate. It's not saying there is\nthe Federal law and it has this rate, and the State law\nthat has that rate. Here, the Equal Credit Opportunity\nAct, a Federal Act, undoubtedly applies. And that is\nproper Federal -- Federal law enforced by the Federal\nauthorities.\nThe State law, as this picture is drawn for\nus, is applicable. It's substantive law applicable to\nthese banks, but only the Federal authority can enforce\nit. That seems passing strange. And do you have an\nexample outside the -- the two you gave us in the\nNational Bank Act where the State prescribes but the\nFederal authorities enforce?\nMR. STEWART: Well, another example would be\nthe Similar Crimes Act, which provides for the\nincorporation of State law with respect to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's not State law\napplying of its own force, just as your second example\nwas not State law applying of its own force. It was\nState law that had been converted into Federal law by\nthe Federal Government's adoption of it.\nMR. STEWART: Those provisions --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's a different\nsituation.\nMR. STEWART: Those provisions do accomplish\nincorporation of State law as Federal law. But this\nCourt has repeatedly said, most recently in Watters,\nthat State law applies to national banks only insofar as\nCongress shall see fit to permit it. So --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is your concern that\n-- not with the substantive State law, but that leaving\nenforcement to the States would cause particular\nproblems? I mean there may be a State law provision\nthat says you shall do this, and the way the attorney\ngeneral elects to enforce it is by shutting the bank\ndown, jailing the bank officers, doing all sorts of\nthings that -- that the -- the Federal Government may\nnot consider appropriate.\nMR. STEWART: That is certainly true, that\nthe -- the State's exercise of remedial discretion may\nbe different from the Federal Government's. But even\nbefore that stage, if you look at the letters in the\nJoint Appendix that the New York Attorney General's\nOffice sent to the national banks in question, basically\nthe thrust of the letters was: We have identified what\nwe believe to be troubling statistical disparities in\nterms of the terms on which the credit was offered to\napplicants of different races. If those disparities are\nnot satisfactorily explained, that it -- you may be in\nviolation of State fair lending laws. Therefore, give\nus a wide variety of information that would allow us to\ndetermine whether you have a satisfactory explanation.\nAnd I think it's clear that had this process\nbeen allowed to run its course, what the New York\nAttorney General's Office was going to do was assess the\nbank's own criteria for making lending decisions to\ndecide whether those criteria were suitable and decide,\ntherefore, whether they provided a satisfactory\nexplanation for the statistical disparities that had\nbeen observed.\nAnd once the New York A.G. is in the\nbusiness of passing upon the adequacy of the bank's\nlending criteria, he is right on the -- the OCC's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You are arguing for\nconflict pre-emption. I mean that's a -- that's a\ndifferent issue than, say, that the -- the State law\nshouldn't apply. But don't tell me the State law\napplies, but only the Federal Government is -- what\nincentive does the Federal Government have to enforce\nState law?\nMR. STEWART: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It -- it has so much spare\ntime after enforcing Federal law that it's -- it's going\nto be worrying about State law?\nMR. STEWART: Well, the point that has been\nmade at various times in the argument that the State law\nbasically tracks Federal law, I think, is an answer to\nthat question; that is, whatever incentive the Federal\nGovernment might have to enforce idiosyncratic features\nof State law that didn't have a Federal analogue. Here\nthe State law in question prohibits discriminatory\npractices that are already prohibited by Federal law.\nSo whether OCC and HUD set out to enforce State law, if\nthey are vigorously enforcing Federal law, they will in\nthe course of doing that vindicate the State's\nprerogatives.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is there any -- is there\nany legislative history whatever to the effect that at\nthe time 36(f)(1)(B) was adopted -- to the effect that\nits effect was to pre-empt State enforcement for --\nMR. STEWART: They -- they don't say it in\n-- with quite that degree of clarity, but there is a\ncolloquy quoted in the -- the brief for the Clearing\nHouse between -- I believe it's Senator D'Amato and --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Senator D'Amato and --\nMR. STEWART: And it is -- it is to the\neffect that Senator D'Amato expresses the concern that\nthis may subject the -- the national banks in their\nbranch activities to State supervision. And the\nresponse is that's not the case. That will happen with\nbranches of State banks, but with respect to branches of\nnational banks the supervision will be by the OCC.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but the -- the problem\nI have with that is, as a -- as a kind of clear\nstatement of -- of something which is -- is -- would be\nextraordinary -- is that it talks in terms of\nsupervision. It doesn't use the -- my recollection is\nit doesn't use the magic word \"enforcement.\"\nAnd I would have thought that if in the\ncourse of that colloquy the -- the statement had been\nmade: The States will not have the authority to enforce\nthis, that there would have been rather a dust-up. And\nthere wasn't. It's kind of a \"dog that didn't bark\"\nargument. And, therefore, if -- if there is uncertainty\nas to how to construe 36(f)(1)(B), I'm not sure that I\n-- I don't think the legislative history supports your\nexclusivity view.\nMR. STEWART: Well, section 36(f)(1)(A)\nrefers to a very limited category of State laws that\ninclude State fair lending laws and said these laws will\nnot be pre-empted unless they would be pre-empted with\nrespect to national banks generally. And then\n36(f)(1)(B) says the laws in that preceding paragraph\nshall be enforced by the comptroller of the Currency.\nAnd so even if the colloquy used the term \"supervision,\"\nthe focus of the statutory language was -- was on a\npretty narrow category of laws.\nI would like also to refer the Court to 12\nU.S.C. 484(b), which I think is relevant here, and it is\non page 1a of the appendix to the government's brief.\nAnd it is an express exception to the general rule\nagainst the exercise of visitorial powers.\nAnd it says, \"Notwithstanding subsection (a)\nof this section, lawfully authorized State auditors and\nexaminers may at reasonable times and upon reasonable\nnotice to a bank review its records solely to ensure\ncompliance with applicable State unclaimed property or\nescheat laws.\"\nNow, the basic thrust of --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Does that mean -- when they\nsay \"review records,\" does that mean that the State\nauditors in effect can walk into the bank, as\ndistinguished from what we have here, in which the bank\nis being requested to produce excerpts from records?\nMR. STEWART: I think that would be the\nimplication of the provision, but the significant point\nfor our purposes is that it refers solely to ensure\ncompliance with applicable State unclaimed property\nordinances and laws.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this\nquestion? Naturally, if it's State laws, clearly they\ncan look at, but what if New York was trying to enforce\nits discrimination laws in an employment context or in\ncontext where they said you are charging minority\ndepositors -- giving them lower rates of interest than\nyou give Caucasian depositors? Would they have -- would\nthe discrimination and the rates of interests paid on\ndeposits -- assume that was the question. Would you\nmake the same argument, if that was what New York had\nalleged?\nMR. STEWART: Yes, we would because that\nwould be going to the banks' federally authorized\nbanking --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: All you would have to just\nlook at the records. You can tell from the records\nwhether people of different classes are paying different\n-- are getting different rates on their deposits.\nMR. STEWART: I mean, it might be that in\nthat instance the discrimination would be unlikely to\npersist, but the basic --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It would be unlikely to\npersist. Maybe it's an unlikely example. But you are\nsuggesting that that would also interfere with the\nComptroller's ability to regulate the banks?\nMR. STEWART: Yes, the way the regulation is\nwritten, it speaks to State efforts to enforce laws that\nare directed at the bank's federally authorized banking\nactivities.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So do you think the same\nanswer whether -- Justice Stevens mentioned employment\ndiscrimination. The State has reason to believe the\nbank is discriminating in its employment policies, and\nit wants to examine certain employment records in that\nconnection. Would you say also that, although New York\ncan prescribe its antidiscrimination in employment law,\nit can't enforce it?\nMR. STEWART: No, the regulation does sweep\nmore categorically with respect to inspection of bank\nrecords. New York would not be forbidden to file\nlawsuits to enforce its employment discrimination laws.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does any of this bring us\nback to the colloquy you began -- began with -- between\nJustice Breyer and Ms. Underwood with reference to many\nStates?\nMR. STEWART: Yes, a certain --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You -- you began on that,\nand I never did hear --\nMR. STEWART: The part of the point I was\ntrying to make was, even if the substantive State law on\nits face is not pre-empted because it is identical to\nthe Federal law, once we get to the enforcement stage\nwhere the relevant enforcement agency is saying your\nstatistical disparity constitutes a violation because it\nis not justified by sound banking practices, inevitably\nthat judgment is going to put the State regulator in the\nbusiness of doing what OCC does. And if 50 different\nState attorneys general have slightly different ideas of\nwhat constitutes an adequate banking justification for\nlending criteria that produces statistical disparity,\nthen the problem is multiplied. Then --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's conflict\npre-emption, and that goes to the -- to the law. You\nshouldn't have a separate State law that -- that\nprovides a separate standard that conflicts with the\nFederal standard. So you pre-empt the law. You don't\nsay the law is in effect, but the State can't enforce\nit. That's a weird way to solve that problem.\nMR. STEWART: Well, the other point I would\nmake about this is that it is accurate to say that under\nthe Federal regime the State is entirely disabled from\nenforcing its own fair lending law. As Ms. Underwood\nalluded to in the opening part of the argument and as\nthe Petitioner's reply brief explains at pages 25 and\n26, the Fair Housing Act does contain a mechanism by\nwhich a State agency -- in the case of New York, it's\nthe Division of Human Resources --- can be certified by\nHUD to enforce the State fair lending laws.\nBut that certification entails two different\nsteps: First, HUD has to determine that the substantive\nState law is -- I believe it's substantially equivalent\nto the comparable Federal law. And, second, HUD\nmonitors the performance of the enforcing agency, the\nparticular agency under State law that carries out that\nresponsibility, and HUD can thereby make sure that\nenforcement as well as the substance of the law are\nconsistent with Federal law.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Waxman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nTHE CLEARING HOUSE ASSOCIATION, L.L.C.\nMR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nSection 484 plainly has pre-emptive effect,\nand what it pre-empts, quoting this Court's decision in\nWatters, is, quote, \"the State's investigative and\nenforcement machinery,\" close quote.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman, your mention\nof Watters, which has been mentioned in the briefs, I\nthink is an inaccurate description of what that opinion\nheld. Watters dealt with a regime that was indisputably\nvisitorial. It was a registration regime, where annual\nfees were paid, annual reports were filed with the State\nfinancial agency, and the State monitor could go into a\nlending organization any time for any reason without any\nsuspicion of wrongdoing. The only -- so everyone agreed\nthat was a visitorial regime.\nThe sole question was whether the banks --\nthe national bank's operating subsidiary was to be\nequated with a division of the national bank. That was\nthe only question provided the Court.\nMR. WAXMAN: Oh, I -- I quite agree, and I\ndid not mean to suggest that this Court's decision in\nWatters, you know, the holding in Watters concludes the\noutcome of this case. But this Court, in section II A\nof Watters -- and we did have a State statutory regime\nthat dealt, yes, with licensure but also with\nexamination, supervision, and enforcement, including\njudicial enforcement -- this Court repeatedly described\nthat what was pre-empted is -- and this goes to, I\nthink, a point that Justice Scalia was making -- was not\nsubstantive pre-emption. There are substantive\npre-emption provisions that are addressed in other\nsections of the Act, including the one that was at issue\nin Smiley. What is exempted, this Court said again and\nagain, is the State's enforcement and investment and --\ninvestigative and enforcement machinery, or its\nexamination and enforcement authority, and that those --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And that was in the\ncontext of a State law that says, mortgage lending\ninstitution, you may not lend unless you register and do\nall the rest. That was the context of Watters. And I\ndo not think that excerpts from that opinion should be\ntaken out of that context, which was: You can't be in\nthis business unless you register with us.\nMR. WAXMAN: The question in the case is\nwhether or not what the Attorney General here sought to\ndo is the exercise of a visitorial power.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can I -- can I take what\nJustice Ginsburg just said, and give you a thought that\nI am interested in your response to?\nI haven't seen the letter from the Attorney\nGeneral. Is the whole thing in the record?\nMR. WAXMAN: There -- the letters are in the\nrecord in the Joint Appendix.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, reading Judge\nParker's description of it, it seemed to me that what he\nhad said was that there are statistical disparities\nbetween interest rates and race. Well, as long as, most\nunfortunately, income is correlated with race, with\nminorities being towards the bottom, of course such\nstatistical disparities will exist, some legitimate,\nsome not. So if the only basis for getting this\ninformation is that allegation, it's hard to see how\nthis differs from the case that Justice Ginsburg put.\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes, that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But it might be quite a\ndifferent case, if they had gone into court and found\nindividuals who were really getting different interest\nrates and who really seemed very, very similar, but for\nrace. But at that point, they'd have to go get this\nsame information, because that's where they would find\nwhether that prima facie case was right or wrong.\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do you see what I'm doing?\nMR. WAXMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm dividing the matter\nvertically, instead of, say, horizontally --\nMR. WAXMAN: I'd like to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and I want to know if\nthat's possible.\nMR. WAXMAN: I'd like to address both the\nvertical and horizontal axes of what I perceive to be\nyour question. One is the distinction that this Court\ndrew in Guthrie, where it said there is a -- there's a\nhuge distinction in determining what's a visitorial\npower between a private individual seeking to vindicate\na deprivation of his or her traditional property right,\nwhich is what was at issue there, and what the Court --\nwhat this Court said was the public right of visitation,\nwhich it also explained was the State's, quote,\n\"enforcing observance of its laws and regulations.\"\nThere is a public and private distinction, and\nvisitation deals with the former.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Sure, there is.\nMR. WAXMAN: It deals with the sovereign.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would -- would you\nacknowledge, counsel, that there is a difference between\nenforcing State laws through visitation and enforcing\nState laws apart from visitation? And what Waters\ninvolved was enforcing State laws through visitation.\nOf course, you can do that through -- through visitation\npowers, but you can also do apart from that by bringing\na lawsuit or whatever.\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Breyer, I'll get to the\nhorizontal axis in a moment. I'm afraid I'm going to\nforget --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sorry, did I skip over\nan axis here.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't mean to.\nMR. WAXMAN: Let me go -- let me go to your\naxis first, which is to say that anything that is a\nvisitorial power can also be interpreted as a police or\nenforcement power, and what Congress had in mind -- this\nis legislation that was born in the crucible of the\nCivil War, and what Congress sought to pre-empt was\nState executive action, State examination and\nenforcement action with respect to these newly created,\nvery important Federal instrumentalities. That was\nhistorically done, this Court explained in Guthrie, and\nChancellor Kent and Blackstone and many other\nauthorities agree was historically done through access\nto the courts; and in fact what Dean Pound in his\noft-cited article about visitorial powers said, was --\nhe said, and this is discussed at pages 16 through 18 of\nthe amicus brief of the Financial Services Roundtable --\nwhat he called, quote, \"the leading case for visitorial\npowers in equity\" was a case called the Attorney General\nv Chicago and Northwest Railroad decided in 1874, in\nwhich the Attorney General of Wisconsin was seeking to\nrequire this railroad to comply with the State's\nmandated rate schedule. That was a visitorial power,\neven though you could also call it a law enforcement\npower.\nNow, Justice Breyer, on the horizontality of\nyour question: This is not a suit in which the New York\nAttorney General is trying to enforce its employment\ndiscrimination laws or its health laws or its zoning\nlaws. The attorney general wants the loan records of\nnational banks, and he wants them so that he can\nevaluate for himself whether the banks are making proper\njudgments about how to market and how to price their\nloans.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Waxman, assume --\nassume for a minute, this -- what if before writing the\nletter, the Attorney General of New York said, \"We have\nconducted 500 interviews with people who have borrowed\nmoney from you, and on the basis of all these interviews\nwe have drawn these tentative conclusions that there is\ndiscrimination. We would like to give you an\nopportunity to explain all of this by showing us your\nrecords.\" And they say no, we won't do it. Would they\nthen be pre-empted from bringing their lawsuit?\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes, they would. And in fact\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Even though they didn't\nhave to look at any bank record to make their prima\nfacie case?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, their -- the OCC in the\npreamble to its regulations does draw a distinction\nbetween State enforcement actions and a pure State\ndeclaratory judgment, quote, \"as to the meaning of the\napplicable law.\" This is a case that -- in which --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I am asking about a\nhypothetical. I understand your argument here. But I\njust don't understand how your argument would apply to\nmy hypothetical. But I think the regulation would apply\nto the hypothetical.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, this is -- this case is\ncertainly in the core, but a -- a State authority,\nwhether it's the State banking commission or the State\nhuman rights commission or the State attorney general,\nor for that matter another Federal Government authority,\nthat seeks to call a national bank to account for the\nmanner in which it is conducting an expressly\ndesignated, allocated banking power is an exercise of\nvisitorial power.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it isn't -- it isn't\nif --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: He doesn't even want to\nlook at your books; he just wants to prove it by people\nwho have been borrowing money and compare them with --\namong them they can orally.\nMR. WAXMAN: I don't --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I don't understand why\nthat would be visitorial power.\nMR. WAXMAN: The -- the State's enforcement\nof any law that is directed at a national bank's\nauthorized banking powers is a visitorial power. And\nthe fact that it may also be characterized as a police\npower or a lawsuit is -- is interesting, but not what's\nat stake.\nWhat Congress aimed at -- Congress in 1864\nknew -- the Supreme Court said, Blackstone and Kent had\nsaid -- that visitorial powers on civil corporations are\nexercised A, by the sovereign, not by a private\nindividual, and B, are almost always exercised through\naccess to the courts. Whether they are invoking the\ncourts' authority to seek records or not, that was the\nhistorical core of what visitorial powers --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So one could say, yes,\nthe Federal authorities have visitorial powers, and they\ncan go to court. But we have here that the State can\nprescribe, not a supervisory regime, but -- fair\nlending. And the State wants to go into court and say\nthe bank is violating the State substantive law, which\nis applicable.\nMR. WAXMAN: That's correct. And a\nsovereign taking a national bank into court with respect\nto not any old general law, but with respect to the\nconduct of its specifically authorized national banking\npowers, is the exercise of visitorial powers.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is it --\nMR. WAXMAN: That was the reason for the\ncourts of justice exception.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is it the exercise of\nvisitorial powers, or is it an action which covers the\nsame subject that an exercise of visitorial powers would\ndo? Let me -- let me propose a distinction, and I don't\nknow whether this is sound. You know -- I mean, you\ntell me.\nI would suppose that if someone with\nvisitorial powers dealing with discrimination in lending\nbrought an action against the bank or tried to enforce\nit against the bank and couldn't do so in any other way\nthen by going to court, it would go to court, and it\nwould say court, tell this institution that I have some\nresponsibility for, to obey the law.\nBut I also assume that if the Attorney\nGeneral of New York, which is not a visitor, enforces\nthe law, it would go into court and say tell them to\nobey the law and to pay damages or recompense of some\nsort to these people whom they have wronged.\nThe subject matter of each suit is the same,\nbut the relief that is being requested and the judicial\npower that is being exercised is different in these two\ncases. Is that a fair distinction?\nMR. WAXMAN: I don't think -- I think that\nif I understood your question, and I may not have -- if\na suit by a private individual or a group of private\nindividuals seeking to indicate the deprivation of a\nprivate traditional right is not visitorial; but if the\nState, either directly in the enforcement of its general\nlaws or seeking to protect the people of its State, goes\ninto court or asks for records or anything else, it is\nexercising a traditional visitorial power.\nMay -- while I have your attention, may I\nalso go back to your question about 36(f) and\nRiegle-Neal, because there is yet -- there are other\nadditional indicators that when the Congress said in\n36(f) that these State laws shall be enforced by the\nOCC, it was mandatory and exclusive.\nFirst of all, the colloquy that was\ndiscussed and is reported in our brief, I think at page\n26, does use the word \"enforce\" as well as \"supervise,\"\nbut more to the point --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That is the one with\nSenator D'Amato?\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes. Riegle-Neal -- here's the\nmost important point. That provision that we've been\nwere looking at had a cognate, had an analogue that was\nalso enforced. Riegle-Neal basically said out-of-state\nbanks can now branch bank. When they do so, they are\nsubject to these four categories of State laws. The\nprovision we have been looking, which was section 102,\nsaid with respect to enforcement of those laws, the OCC\nshall enforce it. But section 105 said where the\nout-of-state bank is a State-chartered bank -- and this\nis reported, I think it's at section 1820(h) of title\n12, when it's a State-chartered bank, the State\nauthorities of the host State shall enforce the laws.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Uh-huh.\nMR. WAXMAN: So it enacted a dual regime\nthat demonstrates exactly what Congress had in mind,\nwhich is that there would be one regulator making the\nkind of judgments about, okay, there is a disparity, but\nlet's look at credit history, let's look at the loan to\nequity value, let's look at income versus debt incurred,\nand all these factors that the OCC and the Fed have\nexplained have to go into making a judgment about\nwhether or not a particular condition of a particular\nloan violates Federal law, whether it the Fair Housing\nAct or the Equal Credit Opportunity Act or the Fed's\nregulation B.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman, you are\ntalking about lending. And like depositing, those are\ncore banking activities, but today national banks have a\nlot of incidental -- they have authority to do things\nincidental to banking. Does your restriction of State\nenforcement extend to those matters incidental to\nbanking?\nMR. WAXMAN: May I answer? I believe that\nit would if those incidental authorities are in fact\nauthorized, approved and regulated by the OCC, but this\ncase doesn't require you to address it, because this is\nan express power under section 371(a).\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nFive minutes, Ms. Underwood.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA D. UNDERWOOD\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. UNDERWOOD: A couple of -- four points\nor so. To the extent the subpoena is perceived -- or\nthis discovery request -- it didn't even proceed to this\nsubpoena stage -- is perceived to be burdensome, State\nlaws allows a motion to quash a subpoena for inadequate\nbasis or for harassment. So there is control in the\nState courts over anything that is perceived to be\nexcessive.\nTwo, States have been enforcing consumer\nprotection and fair lending laws since the mid '70s when\nthey were enacted. The Center for Responsive Lending\namicus brief has a discussion of that history of\nenforcement. The Conway affidavit at the Joint Appendix\nat 152 has a description of New York's enforcement\nactivities between 1975 and 2004. And the Lawyers'\nCommittee for Civil Rights also goes over that history.\nAnd they have been enforcing other laws\nagainst national banks for even longer, antitrust laws,\nbranching laws, idiosyncratic laws of various sorts with\nno evidence that this has impaired the functions of the\nbanks.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Underwood, I -- I\nforgot the response you made in your brief. I know you\ndid make some response to subsection (b) of section 484.\nHow do you -- how do you explain that?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: In the exceptions?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. Why -- why do they\nlist those exceptions, unless one would think that\neverything is covered?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Virtually every exception\nwas enacted to resolve a controversy over whether\nsomething was visitorial or not. In fact, just as in\nGuthrie, where this Court said the shareholders' suit\nfor bank records was not visitorial, or alternatively,\nif it is, it is covered by the courts of justice\nexception. So too, each of those exceptions involved a\nsituation where there was a claim, an incorrect claim,\nbut a claim that the action would be banned as\nvisitorial, so Congress --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, why isn't\nit a complete answer to what I agree is a somewhat\nunusual situation of pre-empting enforcement but not the\nsubstance of law that its enforcement that raises the\nconcerns? That the Federal Government thinks the State\nlaw is fine, but when you get attorneys general\nenforcing it in a particular way, that's what causes the\nproblem. And I mean, the problem arises in a lot of\nareas. Even within the Federal Government, the FBI and\nDEA have different ways of enforcing that might conflict\nwith each other. Why doesn't that make perfect sense?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, even without\nenforcement of State law, OCC would not have exclusive\ncontrol of enforcement of discrimination laws against\nnational banks. So the idea that State enforcement\nposes some special problem to interfere with that\nexclusive control is just a mistake. That's not the way\nCongress set it up.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, why -- why is it\na mistake? Why can't Congress or the OCC think that\nthat's where the difficulties are going to arise? In\nother words, it's kind of a less intrusive approach, and\nsaying, well, you can have your State law but we are\nconcerned about enforcement, so we are going to be the\nones that enforce it.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: I didn't mean it's a mistake\nof policy. I meant it's a mistake in description of the\nregime Congress created.\nHUD has administrative enforcement. DOJ has\nlitigation enforcement. This is a Federal law. Private\nparties can enforce Federal fair housing law. States\ncan probably enforce Federal fair housing laws, too, as\n-- patriotic for the victim. The Second Circuit set\naside that part of the injunction, the part that barred\nNew York from enforcing Federal law.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your answer is\nbecause they have different entities that can enforce\nit, they are sort of in for a penny, in for a pound? If\nyou let anybody else enforce it, you have got to let\neverybody else enforce it?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: No, I don't say that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Including the\nentities that have historically have targeted national\nbanks?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: I don't make that argument.\nWhat I say is that is strong evidence that Congress\ndidn't intend to give OCC exclusive control here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose if -- if\nenforcement pre-emption is the lesser step, we probably\nought to revise our jurisprudence so as not to tread any\nmore heavily than we have to upon the States so that\nwhere there is conflict pre-emption, all we should say\nis the State law is not invalidated, it is simply not\nenforceable?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean that would --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I suppose the\nquestion would not be what we think is a good idea but\nwhat Congress has done. And here the OCC has\ninterpreted what Congress has done is to make exclusive\nthe OCC regulation only with respect to enforcement.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would suppose you\nwould thank them for that rather than criticize them for\nit.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: I think that in many ways\nleaving the law intact and denying the States the\nability to enforce it is more intrusive then simply\nfinding pre-emption. In any event, Congress made it\nquite clear that it didn't want pre-emption.\nI think my time is up.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n"
