        "content": "(10:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in case 06-480, Leegin Creative\nLeather Products versus PSKS Incorporated. Mr. Olson.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe per se illegality rule for resale price\nmaintenance is widely recognized to be outdated,\nmisguided and anticompetitive. It should be replaced\nwith the same rule of reason standard that applies to\nother forms of vertically imposed marketing\nrestrictions.\nThe Sherman Act bars only unreasonable\nrestraints of trade and the court presumptively applies\na rule of reason analysis to determine whether a\nrestraint is unreasonable.\nPer se rules should be rare and imposed only\nwhere the court is virtually certain based upon\nconsiderable economic experience that a practice is\nnearly invariably anticompetitive. Vertical minimum\nretail -- resale price maintenance are plainly not\ninvariably anticompetitive. In fact, a broad consensus\nof economists and decisions of this Court recognize that\nvertical restraints promote interbrand competition,\nwhich is the goal of the antitrust laws and are rarely,\nif ever, anticompetitive.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was an argument\nmade, Mr. Olson, that it is somewhat difficult to\ndistinguish vertical from horizontal in this context,\nthat in fact, the agreement that the manufacturer made\nwith the dealers was more successful in getting a\nhorizontal accord among the dealers than if the dealers\nhad attempted it themselves, in which case some might\nhave held back.\nMR. OLSON: Well, the economists who have\nlooked at the use of resale price maintenance have said\nthat that would very rarely, if ever, be the case. It\ncertainly could not be the case in this industry in\nconnection with this participant in the marketplace.\nThere are something like 5,000 dealers that the Brighton\nproducts are sold through. There are thousands and\nthousands of other competing dealers, hundreds of\nproducts.\nWhat the Court has said repeatedly is that\nprograms such as this may promote interbrand\ncompetition, perhaps --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Olson, suppose just\nthe dealers in New York, the retail dealers agreed among\nthemselves on the price. Would that be lawful?\nMR. OLSON: No. I think that that would be\ncovered by a horizontal prohibition, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would you say that it's\nper se unlawful?\nMR. OLSON: I think it would be, as\nhorizontal restraint among competing dealers, it could\nbe a per se violation under horizontal rules if it was\n-- if it was -- involved the manufacturer in some way,\nit could be dealt with by the rule of reason.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why should that be any\ndifferent from the arrangement where those dealers all\ngot together in the convention and recommended to the\nmanufacturer that he impose a vertical restraint of\nprecisely the same dimensions? Why --\nMR. OLSON: What this Court said in\nSylvania, and said again in the State Oil versus Khan,\nis that the manufacturer has very, very little incentive\nto increase --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but I'm asking what if\nhe did, why should you draw a distinction?\nMR. OLSON: Because the motivation for the\narrangement, if it comes from a manufacturer -- you're\nsuggesting a hypothetical in which all of the dealers in\na particular area would get together to impose this on a\nmanufacturer. I think it's very unrealistic that that\nwould happen.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No. They just passed a\nresolution asking the manufacturer to impose this\nvertical restraint and ways to do it. Should that be\ndifferent from one in which the manufacturer does it\nindependently?\nMR. OLSON: I think that if the manufacturer\nmakes a decision, whether it's because dealers would\nlike to see that happen or not, as this Court said in\nBusiness Electronic versus Sharp Electronics, there's of\ncourse relationships between the dealers and the\nmanufacturers, that the dealers may have an interest in\ndoing this, because they may find for the same reason\nthat the manufacturer does that it promotes the sales of\nproducts. The record is clear in this case that this\nwas an effective strategy for the Brighton company, the\nBrighton Leegin company that's manufacturing the\nBrighton products, to enter a very difficult and highly\ncompetitive marketplace, and it was successful.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe, Mr. Olson,\nyou could give us an example where the rule of reason\nwould find a violation in this situation?\nMR. OLSON: Well, it might be a situation,\nthe economists have written about this, say that it\nwould be very rare, and would require retailers with a\nstrong powerful market power to impose a situation where\nthe manufacturer would do that to help facilitate a\nhorizontal cartel. That certainly was not involved in\nthis case, and that would probably be found to violate\nthe rule of reason. In addition, it would probably be\nunlawful under the horizontal rules established by this\nCourt. That was not an issue in this case. The\neconomists say that that would very seldom happen.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You say very. Which\neconomists? I know the Chicago school tends to want\nrule of reason and so forth. Professor Sherer is an\neconomist, isn't he? Worked at the FTC for a long time.\nA good expert in the field. He points out the drug\nindustry after you got rid of -- after you got rid of\nresale price maintenance, the margins fell 40 percent.\nThe drug stores it went down 20 percent. He says with\nblue jeans, alone, it saved American consumers $200\nmillion to get rid of it. And his conclusion is, as in\nthe uniform enforcement of resale price maintenance, the\nrestraints can impose massive anti-consumer benefits.\nMassive.\nMR. OLSON: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What that sounds like is\nthat if at least he, who is an economist, thinks if you\nget rid of Dr. Miles, every American will pay far more\nfor the goods that they buy at retail. Now that's one\neconomist, of course. There are other whose think\ndifferently. So how should we decide this?\nMR. OLSON: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Should we overturn\nDr. Miles and run that risk?\nMR. OLSON: In, in the vast majority of the\neconomist whose have looked at this have come out to the\nopposite conclusion, Justice Breyer. Secondly --\nJUSTICE BREYER: We're supposed to count\neconomists?\nMR. OLSON: No. No. I think that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that how we decide it?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. OLSON: But what this Court -- what this\nCourt has repeatedly said, that under circumstances such\nas this where there's a consensus among leading\nrespected economists, that is one factor. There's\nanother factor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I haven't seen a\nconsensus. A consensus? Isn't, doesn't Sherer and all\nthese people, doesn't that point of view count, too?\nMR. OLSON: This is one factor that the\nCourt should consider and the Court has considered in\nthe past when dealing with something that the Court\nitself has said, is an anachronistic and chronologically\nschizoid rule, to have a rule of reason for certain\nvertical restraints and a fixed, rigid, per se rule with\nrespect to other vertical restraints. The Court -- the\nCourt itself has made those pronouncements.\nThe enforcing agencies have changed their\nview with respect -- and they are here today, the\nAntitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission, all\nof whom have announced that they believe that it is very\nrare for a rule such as this, for an arrangement such as\nthis to be anticompetitive.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it was not so long\nago that the Department of Justice took a different\nview. And of all of the vertical restraints, this is\nthe only one where Congress has been a player. I mean,\nCongress allowed the fair trade laws to operate. And\nthen it withdrew that. There's no other restraint where\nthey are has been congressional action, where the\nargument could be made, well, Congress is well aware of\nthis, the Court should allow them to make the change, if\nthey so will.\nMR. OLSON: Essentially, the same argument\nwas made in the Sylvania -- at the time of the Sylvania\ncase. The same argument was made just a term or two go\nin connection with the Illinois Tool case that dealt\nwith tying arrangements. The same argument was made in\nState Oil versus Khan. This Court has construed the\nantitrust laws as an expression by Congress that the\ncourts should be aware of the dynamic potential in the\nmarketplace --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But in those cases you\ndidn't have the counterpart to Miller-Tydings and\nMcGuire. That's what makes this -- this one different\nin terms of congressional intention.\nMR. OLSON: The repeal of those statutes,\nJustice Ginsburg, repealed per se legality rules. It\nwas not a congressional expression against the rule of\nreason --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but there was in the\npatent case, though, Mr. Olson. We relied on the fact\nthat the patent law changed.\nMR. OLSON: Yes, you did.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. OLSON: And that was a, that was one\nfactor, however, Justice Stevens. I think, as I read\nthat opinion, the Court was also concerned with the fact\nthat the, the per se rule which -- and the Court said\nthe statement thing just a few weeks ago in the\nWeyerhaeuser case -- to the extent there's practices\nthat can be procompetitive, the Court should not set a\nlow threshold of illegality, especially low per se\nillegality threshold. There were -- there have been --\nit is worth emphasizing that the Court has repeatedly\nsaid we don't want per se rules when we don't have a\nsubstantial body of economic experience that shows us\nthat this practice --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about -- what\nabout the reliance interest, though? I mean, hasn't a\nwhole industry of discount stores developed in reliance\non the Dr. Miles rule? And don't we need to be\nconcerned about the disruption to that established\npractice?\nMR. OLSON: There's really no evidence that\nthe marketplace as it exists today is a result of the\nDr. Miles rule of 1911, Chief Justice --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't there evidence that\nthe, basically that the rise of the Wal-Marts and the\nTargets is correlated with the demise of fair trade?\nSo -- that there's that correlation.\nMR. OLSON: Actually I looked into that,\nJustice Souter. And me, my limited historical research\nis that the -- those discounters were coming on strong\nbefore 1975 which is when the, the consumer price,\nwhatever it was, act was passed in response to that.\nThere are -- the evidence basically shows\nthat -- and this Court has said -- that it's interbrand\ncompetition that ultimately produces lower prices.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I don't know. We\nhave -- you talked about -- just for fun I got out of\nthe library a book by Professor B. S. Yamey, called\nresale price maintenance where he has five economists --\nnow maybe you're not going to count them as economists.\nNow I didn't find in that book a single argument that\nisn't also in your briefs, nor did I find in your brief\nas single argument that isn't in the book.\nThere's one interesting thing about the\nbook. It was written in 1966. So I guess my question\nis what's changed? Now I know two things have changed.\nOne is there's evidence in Canada, Britain,\nand in the states that were under Miller-Tydings, that\nwhen you got rid of resale price maintenance, prices\nwent down. That's changed. And the second thing that's\nchanged is there's far more concentration, I gather,\ntoday in the retail side of the market than there are\nused to be, a factor which makes resale price\nmaintenance dangerous because it's more likely to take\nplace at the request of the dealers.\nNow, I see those two changes. My question\nto you is looking at Yamey's book which is called Resale\nPrice Maintenance, so you might have found even it even\non Google, and -- what's changed? What's new?\nMR. OLSON: Well, a number of things have\nchanged. The -- the number of respected individuals,\nnotwithstanding that book, who have looked at it and\nhave focused on the marketplace, have said that because\nit allows -- it increases the possibility of interbrand\ncompetition, it can provide incentives for dealers to\nprovide service, differences in the products. And other\nthings that have happened since then, are this Court's\ndecision in the Sylvania case, which -- which involved\nan elaborate analysis of vertical restrictions and found\nthat they are largely procompetitive and undermine the\nruling -- the reason for a per se rule.\nThis Court's decision in State Oil versus\nKhan, and the other cases that this Court is very well\naware of where per se rules have systematically been\ndismantled because they are artificial themselves in the\nmarketplace. This --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Mr. Olson, does brand\ncompetition generally help retailers, or is this a\nquestion that can't be answered?\nMR. OLSON: Did you say inter --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Interbrand, interbrand\ncompetition? Do retailers like interbrand competition?\nMR. OLSON: Well, I don't know that -- I\ndon't know whether people like competition. But the\nantitrust laws like competition and this Court likes\ncompetition. And this Court has said that interbrand --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but we're talking\nabout inter -- we're talking about retailers. It, it\nseems to me at the outset of the argument, you -- you\nacknowledged, and I think it is the general rule -- that\nif the retailers themselves have this resale price\nmaintenance, it is invalid. Well, if the manufacturer\ndoes this just for the convenience of the retailers, and\nthat's -- many of the examples in your brief, it is for\nthe convenience and for the benefit of the retailers,\nthen why shouldn't there be a per se rule? Why should\nwe allow the manufacturer to do something we that\nwouldn't allow the retailers to do, if it's for the\nretailers?\nMR. OLSON: Well, the manufacturer is very\nunlikely to do this for the convenience of the\nretailers, to -- because it's in the interest of the\nmanufacturer to have the retail price as low as possible\nso that the manufacturer will sell as many of the\nmanufacturers' products as possible.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If -- if, if indeed that's,\nthat's what he's aiming at, low price. Is it the object\nof the -- is the sole object of the Sherman Act to\nproduce low prices?\nMR. OLSON: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought it was consumer\nwelfare.\nMR. OLSON: Yes, yes, it is.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And I thought some\nconsumers would prefer more service at a higher price.\nMR. OLSON: Precisely.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So the mere fact that it\nwould increase prices doesn't prove anything. It\ndoesn't prove that it's serving consumer welfare. If,\nin fact, it's giving the consumer a choice of more\nservice at a somewhat higher price, that would enhance\nconsumer welfare, so long as there are competitive\nproducts at a lower price, wouldn't it?\nMR. OLSON: That's -- that's absolutely\ncorrect.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So I don't know why, why we\nshould have to focus our entire attention on whether\nit's going to -- going to produce higher prices or not.\nThe market out there has different goods at different\nprices which have different qualities that attract\ndifferent consumers.\nMR. OLSON: I -- I agree completely. I\nwould like to reserve the balance of my time for\nrebuttal, but let me say that that's what this Court has\nsaid over and over again. If you -- the purpose of the\nantitrust laws is not price, but it's competition,\nbecause competition between competing manufacturers give\nthe consumers more choice. Some people may want the\ncheapest product. Some people may want the product\nthat's more available to them. They may wish the return\npolicy or the warranty policy or the repair policy that\nthe dealer provides. And in this marketplace\nparticularly, that system of providing competition is\nconsistent with the antitrust laws and has produced\nsuccess in the marketplace.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Olson, before you sit\ndown, there's just one thing that wasn't covered in your\nargument or in the brief, but the complaint alleged in\nthis case that Leegin allowed certain favored dealers to\ndiscount; this plaintiff, but others were allowed to\ndiscount. And if that were true, as a matter of fact,\nthen that would be a -- a plain violation of antitrust\nlaw, wouldn't it?\nMR. OLSON: This -- but the case was never\nlitigated on that basis. It wasn't considered on that\nbasis in the Court of Appeals. It came up sort of as a\nlate thought in the opposition to the petition for\ncertiorari. But that is not this case. The case was\nlitigated on the per se rule of Dr. Miles.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Olson.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- in the complaint,.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Olson.\nMr. Hungar?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR\nON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING PETITIONER\nMR. HUNGAR: Thank you Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court.\nThe same considerations that led this Court\nin Sylvania and State Oil to reject outmoded per se\nrules compel that same result here. The Dr. Miles rule\nconflicts with this Court's modern antitrust\njurisprudence in three fatal --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Maybe I'll put my question,\nwhich is really just one for this. I understand\nperfectly that the per se rule is a result of balancing\ndiffer things. Of course, resale price maintenance does\nraise prices, and it is very often anticompetitive. Of\ncourse, sometimes, there are good reasons for it that\nmight help consumers.\nNow, in addition, you need clear rules. Now\nthose three sets of things require a balance. And we\nhave a hundred years of history where this Court and\nCongress and others have balanced those three sets of\nconsiderations, and they've come out one way. Now, the\nDepartment of Justice wants to rebalance them and come\nout the other way.\nThere are good arguments on both sides. Why\nshould we overrule a case that's 96 years old, in the\nabsence of any -- any -- congressional indication that\nthat's a good idea, when it's simply a question in a\ndifficult area of people reaching a slightly different\nweight on some these three sets of things?\nMR. HUNGAR: Several reasons, Your Honor.\nIt's not -- it's not a close question whether this Court\nunder its modern antitrust jurisprudence as an initial\nmatter would impose a per se rule in this context.\nThere is economic -- there is consensus among the\nrespected economists --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I would think it is quite a\nclose question.\nMR. HUNGAR: I don't think you, Your Honor.\nGiven that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right, even so. Go\nahead.\nMR. HUNGAR: Given that this Court's test,\nthe question this Court's modern cases ask, in\ndistinguishing between the rule of reason and the per se\nrule, is whether the challenged conduct is always or\nalmost always anticompetitive. That's what the Court\nhas said.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Price fixing, horizontal, I\nguess, or territorial divisions, we should overturn\nthose too.\nMR. HUNGAR: Certainly not, Your Honor.\nBecause that, that is almost always anticompetitive in\nour experience and in the experience of the courts. But\nthe same is not true in the resale price maintenance\ncontext. Dr. Miles has foreclosed the courts from\nconducting the kind of analysis that would actually look\ninto this question. But the empirical data that are\navailable would suggest that anticompetitive\nexplanations for resale price maintenance do not have\nvery much explanatory power. When you actually look at\nthe cases that have been litigated, they involve\nmanufacturers without market power, unconcentrated\nmarkets, no evidence in the vast majority of those cases\nof any cartelization going on. So the anticompetitive\nexplanations, while certainly valid in some cases, do\nnot appear to explain most of the retail price\nmaintenance that has been litigated. It's true that\nretail price maintenance can but does not always result\nin price increases, but, as Justice Scalia pointed out,\nprice is not the only thing that consumers care about.\nAnd there is widespread consensus in the economic\nliterature and in this Court's recent cases that\nprice-based vertical restraints, just like non-price\nbased vertical restraints, while they generally reduce\nintrabrand competition, generally enhance interbrand\ncompetition.\nIn Monsanto and Business Electronics,\nthis Court made clear that price vertical restraints,\nlike minimum resale price maintenance, frequently, in\nfact usually, have the same or similar effects to the\nnon-price vertical restraints to which this Court now\napplies rule of reason analysis. So the reason in --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Wouldn't your argument\nalso apply to a conspiracy among the New York dealers in\nthis product just to fix prices? Because there's plenty\nof interbrand competition, I think. I don't think you\ncan say it's absolutely clear that that would always be\nanti-competitive because they would also agree to\nprovide additional services.\nMR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor, because\nhorizontal -- the important thing to keep in mind is\nthat the incentive of the manufacturer when the\nmanufacturer --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm talking about a case\nin which it's the dealers who want to agree to provide\nextra services at higher prices as their method of\nbetter serving the public and they all agree that they\nhave to be conscious about the competition from other\nbrands. Why can we be absolutely certain that's always\ngoing to be harmful to the consumer?\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, the reason why we\nknow that is always or almost always harmful is that the\nincentive at a horizontal level of a retailer cartel,\njust like the incentives of the participants in a\nmanufacturing cartel --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They might be precisely\nthe statement as the manufacturers: We think we'll make\nmore, all make more money if we concentrate on service\nrather than price.\nMR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor, because the\nmanufacturer's incentive is not to increase the profits\nof the retailers, but the retailers when they get\ntogether obviously have a very different incentive,\nwhich is not to benefit the manufacturer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What you say is right.\nWhat you say there is right. I feel I'm back in 1966.\nThe argument against that is, we don't know which way\nthe push comes. The large retailers, Home Depot,\nwhatever they are, huge retailers, they want -- or maybe\nit isn't the discounters, it's some other once. We\ndon't know which way. You're throwing it into court.\nYou're throwing it before 12 people who may or may not\nwork this thing out. So the argument against what\nyou're saying is not logic. It's empirical and\nadministrative.\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's what it was. That's\nwhat it is now, I guess.\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, in State Oil the\nsame argument was made. The argument was made that,\nwhile we don't have compelling empirical evidence that\nAlbrecht results in harm to the economy, we don't have\ncompelling empirical evidence that resale price\nmaintenance, maximum resale price maintenance, is\ngenerally pro-competitive, and in the absence of such\nempirical evidence there's no basis for overturning\nprecedent. This Court unanimously --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We do have empirical\nevidence, though, don't we, that the decision of this\ncase is going to be very significant in the sort of\nbattle between Wal-Mart and the Main Street stores; and\nwhy should this Court in effect take a shot in the dark\nat resolving that, as distinct from leaving it to\nCongress, which is in a position to know more about\nwhere the shot is going to land than we are?\nMR. HUNGAR: This Court -- I'm sorry.\nThere's no empirical evidence that I'm aware of about\nwhat impact eliminating Dr. Miles would have on the\nWal-Marts of the world.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's my point. But it\nseems to me there is a body of some empirical evidence\nthat the success of the Wal-Marts and the Targets and\nthe Home Depots was a success which was correlated with\nthe elimination of price maintenance by the States.\nMR. HUNGAR: I don't think so, Your Honor.\nIn fact, as Mr. Olson pointed out, the K-Marts of the\nworld began during the fair trade era.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: They began, but they have\nflourished in the post-fair trade era.\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor, but I think\nconsiderations likes the opening up of international\ntrade and the development of markets like China to\nsupply low-cost goods have a lot more to do with the\nsuccess of the Wal-Marts of the world than a rule like\nDr. Miles.\nRemember, it's perfectly legal under current\nlaw for manufacturers to impose the same sort of\nconstraints as long as they do it by fiat and unilateral\nenforcement rather than by agreement. So the suggestion\nthat somehow this is going to revolutionize the economy\nif Dr. Miles is overruled is simply unsupportable.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well then, what's\nthe great benefit then in changing the rule if it's\nperfectly legal to achieve the same result already?\nMR. HUNGAR: As the Ping amicus brief, the\nPing Golf Club Manufacturer amicus brief, indicates it's\nextremely expensive and inefficient to follow the\nColgate regime, that for those manufacturers for whom\nresale price maintenance would be in effect a strategy\nlike Leegin it's more efficient to do it in many\ncircumstances by agreement, rather than the disruption\nthat is entailed when you terminate a dealer without\nfurther discussion for discounting one item in order to\nkeep your policy in place.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But doesn't that answer\nyour argument that there isn't reason to believe that\nthere is going to be disruption if Dr. Miles goes,\nbecause now it's going to be easy?\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, in 1945 during the\nheight of the fair trade era the FTC did a study which\nconcluded only about 5 percent of the economy was\naffected by fair trade. And the fair trade regime,\nremember, is a different and more extreme regime. There\nit was per se legality, not rule of reason. So it's\njust -- there's just no basis for these assertions that\nsomehow the economy is going to be massively changed.\nBut it is also perfectly clear and undisputed that there\nare circumstances in which it is more efficient for a\nmanufacturer to adopt resale price maintenance. It will\nenhance its ability to compete and it will provide\nconsumers more of what they want, and that is a good\nthing and the antitrust laws should not automatically\nforeclose that merely because in a small percentage of\ncases it is conceivable that there can be\nanticompetitive effects.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't it fair to say that\nthere is reason to believe that there may be a massive\nreorientation in the retail economy if Dr. Miles goes?\nAnd that gets to my problem, why should we be the people\nto make a guess as opposed to the Congress as the\ninstitution to make the guess?\nMR. HUNGAR: I'm not aware of any reason to\nbelieve that, Your Honor, based on the historical record\nand based on the modern realities. The Wal-Marts of the\nworld have succeeded because of their discounting\nstrategy. That's not going to change, and manufacturers\nhave an incentive to have their goods sold through those\nstores and that's not going to change either in the vast\nmajority of cases. And With respect --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If the rule of reason is\nthe one that applies, I gathered, perhaps incorrectly,\nfrom Mr. Olson's remarks that this would be -- this case\nwould be thrown out on summary judgment, it would never\nget to trial. How do you think the rule of reason would\noperate if it were the rubric under which this case were\nto be decided?\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, I think it would\noperate as it does usually, which is the plaintiff would\nbe required to establish an anticompetitive effect\nresulting from the challenged conduct, and once that\nburden is overcome the defendant would be required to\ncome up with some legitimate business justification,\nsome pro-competitive results that outweigh that. And\nonly if they could do that would they succeed.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that's the formula,\nbut I take it from what you said and Mr. Olson said that\nthe plaintiff could never get across the first\nthreshold?\nMR. HUNGAR: We don't agree with that, Your\nHonor. In cases where resale price maintenance is being\nused to facilitate cartelization, either at the\nmanufacturer or the retail level, the plaintiff could\nprevail. Also in, for example, in an oligopolistic\nmarket.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But in this case, this\ncase has none of those features.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Leegin loses under the\nrule of reason, right?\nMR. HUNGAR: We don't know that. It seems\nlikely to assume that, though, and that's not a bad\nthing. Leegin is obviously not dominant in the market.\nIt's obviously not going to succeed unless what it is\noffering at a higher price is what consumers want, and\nthat is a good thing under the antitrust laws.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Hungar.\nMR. HUNGAR: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Coykendall.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT W. COYKENDALL\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. COYKENDALL: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nAs recently as last month, this Court\nrestated a guiding principle of antitrust jurisprudence:\nDiscouraging price cuts and depriving consumers of low\nprices is bad antitrust policy. RPM prohibits price --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that right? I mean, You\nreally think that antitrust policy means when -- any\narrangement that produce a higher price is bad?\nMR. COYKENDALL: Well, we aren't talking\nabout any arrangement --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, a lot of consumers\nwant, you know, extended warranties. They want show\nrooms where they can go and look at things. All of\nwhich costs more money. And where you can not have\nresale price maintenance the customers -- or you have\nthe free rider problem. The customers shop at the place\nthat has the big show room, likes at all the product\nthere, and goes and buys it from somebody else who has\nnot incurred that expense.\nNow, I just don't think that all the\ncustomers want is cheap. I think they want other things\nbesides cheap. I think they want service. I think they\nwant selection. I think they want the ability to view\ngoods and so forth. Why do you discount all of those\nthings?\nMR. COYKENDALL: I don't discount all those\nthings. All those things are available under our\ncurrent regime where we have a per se prohibition\nagainst resale price maintenance.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they aren't\navailable. This company thought that it could provide\nhigher service if it could assure its retailers that\nthey would not be undercut by people who are not\nproviding that kind of service.\nMR. COYKENDALL: And there's no question\nthat even the plaintiff in this case was providing that\nservice. He was providing it more efficiently and he\njust wanted to pass those efficiencies on.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't, I don't know that\nthere's no question about that. There's certainly no\nquestion that this company was successful in breaking\ninto a difficult market with its strategy of assuring\nits retailers a cushion so that they could provide the\nservice.\nMR. COYKENDALL: The record shows that with\nthis specific company, most of the growth of its sales\noccurred before it established a resale price\nmaintenance policy. So there are no demonstrated\nbenefits from this company of imposing and enforcing a\nresale price maintenance policy.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is your main\nobjection to -- I mean, it's hard to propose a rule of\nreason. Why, why can't the rule of reason work to\npromote the objectives you've just articulated?\nMR. COYKENDALL: Well, as a practical matter\nfor someone in my position, or plaintiff's position,\nit's impossible for a small dealer to muster the\nresources in order to put forth -- CHIEF JUSTICE\nROBERTS: For a small dealer. But as we've already\nheard, the dealers who engage in the discount policy are\nprices like Target and Wal-Mart. Those aren't small\ndealers. Those are behemoths in the retailing industry.\nMR. COYKENDALL: I would suggest that those\nare not the people that really are being protected by\nthis particular per se prohibition. It is the small mom\nand pop operation like my client that wants to innovate\nand expand and pass on efficiencies and compete with the\nbig discounters who might have power of their own in\norder to secure discounts.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So you don't agree with the\nargument that we've heard this morning that the\ntransformation of American retailing since the 1970s and\nthe rise of the large-scale low-price retailers has\nanything to do with the end of the fair trade laws and\nthat overruling Dr. Miles would reverse that?\nMR. COYKENDALL: No, I absolutely agree with\nthat. But it's resale price maintenance that enables\nthese initiators, these small companies, these small\noperations, to grow and innovate, achieve the\nefficiencies, and pass those on, attract customers by\nreducing prices. And all that is stopped by imposition\nof a resale price --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is there anything to suggest\nthat the large-scale low-price retailers who were\nsupposedly dependent on Dr. Miles are -- support its\nretention? Have they filed amicus briefs here or\notherwise suggested that this is essential to their\ncontinuing operation?\nMR. COYKENDALL: Again, the large-scale\ndominant players in the retail industry have their own\nmarket power. They don't need the protection of the\nper se rule in order to enforce them. It's the next\ngeneration that this rule really aims to protect.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that. I\nmean, if it was really the case that they were going to\nbe losing, losing profits, I think they would have been\nhere. I mean, we talk about the Wal-Marts and the\nTargets. They're not here on amicus briefs because\nthey're -- what they're selling is cheap. They are\nselling price, and people who want low price and for\nwhom that's of value above all other things are going to\ncontinue to go to those stores. So they're not going to\nbe harmed by the fact that some manufacturers want to\nprovide not just the low price -- of course, they'll try\nto keep the price as low as possible -- but service.\nI just don't see what, what harm can\npossibly come, so long as there's no market dominance,\nfrom allowing some people to make their money on service\nand -- rather than cheap price.\nMR. COYKENDALL: Well, again I would suggest\nthat under this current system the way it is we have\nboth the full service providers of complete service that\noffer goods at a certain price and we have discounters\nselling those same goods. There is currently a mix of\nservice and price that better serves the economy than\njust having one cookie cutter -- a one size fits all\napproach that you would have with resale price\nmaintenance.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I thought the per se\nrule was the cookie cutter approach.\nMR. COYKENDALL: Well, in terms of\nprohibiting price or in terms of, yes, prohibiting price\nfixing, that's true. But it permits stores to have full\nprice and full service and charge high prices for that\nservice, and it permits discounters to reduce price,\nreduce service and cater to those customers who want the\ngoods with lower service.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The Internet -- is it --\nyou would have said four years ago, or I think we are in\nthis argument, you would have said that it's the large\ndiscounters, the growing discounters, the Walgreen's of\nthe world who want to get rid of retail price\nmaintenance, it's there to help the mom and pops. Okay.\nThey're in now, they're big, and they may want to\nmaintain resale prices because they may want to extract\nthe other profit, while the Internet little company\ncomes in and says I can get it to you cheaper.\nNow I can imagine circumstances like you\nsay. I can imagine they're not like you say. I don't\nknow. And so what should I do if I really don't know?\nMR. COYKENDALL: Well, there is no doubt\nthat resale price maintenance raises prices to\nconsumers. The only economic doubt is whether there are\nany redeeming effects of those prices; and that's where\nthe economic dispute of this is.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought the\nPing brief that was referenced earlier made a point that\nit made, the prices may be -- resale price -- the\ncurrent Dr. Miles rule may result in increased prices\nbecause of the inefficiencies for those retailers, or of\nthose manufacturers who want to establish a regime where\nsomething other than price is important, and they have\nto do that unilaterally, which increases inefficiencies.\nMR. COYKENDALL: Well, Your Honor, I would\nsuggest that, first of all, eliminating the per se rule\nwould not decrease the inefficiencies of the Colgate\ndoctrine. If they want to impose resale price\nmaintenance in order to avoid even a rule of reasoned\napproach, they would have to go --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Even with the tremendous\nanomaly that the employer -- that the -- the\nmanufacturer cannot do this by agreement, but he can do\nit just unilaterally and terminate any dealers that\nwon't go along? Those two are substitute of each other.\nColgate seems to say you can achieve the same end but\nwe're not going to let you do it by agreement, you have\nto do it on your own, and then you have to do the\ndraconian thing of terminating the dealer.\nMR. COYKENDALL: I believe that anomaly\nreally lies at the heart of the Sherman Antitrust Act\nwhich is aimed at contracts, combinations and\nconspiracies. Unilateral conduct isn't reached by that,\nit's the price of being in a fair country. People can\ndeal in ways that they want to with this particular\nissue.\nBut again, eliminating the per se rule will\nnot help Ping out if they want to maintain their retail\nprice maintenance as legal, as unilateral. They'll\nstill have to go through these same machinations.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is that? Why\ncan't -- eliminating the rule, I thought the whole point\nwas they would just put in their contracts, you have to\nsell it at this price, and they could enforce the\ncontracts, rather than having to have these machinations\nof making sure they don't do anything that looks like an\nagreement with their retailers.\nMR. COYKENDALL: Well, again, then they\nwould be subject to a rule of reason analysis and the\nuncertainties occasioned with that as to whether this\ncontract is lawful. If they want to avoid that, then of\ncourse, they would have to stick with the Colgate\ndoctrine.\nYour Honor, this particular case, we have\nclear evidence that RPM was used to facilitate a\nhorizontal retailer cartel. We have evidence in the\nbriefs that Leegin would gather its dealers in a dealer\nmeeting, discuss the policy, agree to changes, and reach\na consensus, and then enforce that policy against\neveryone.\nOne of the evils of resale price maintenance\nis specifically this: It does facilitate the formation\nof cartels.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yeah, but the conspiracy\nthat it facilitated was just with intrabrand\ncompetition. There wasn't conspiracy that affected\ninterbrand competition.\nMR. COYKENDALL: Retail --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So I'm not sure that\neconomically it makes any difference whether the dealers\nare the one who decide to do it or the manufacturer was,\nor they all did it at the same time.\nMR. COYKENDALL: Horizontal conspiracies,\neven among a single brand, has always been a per se\nviolation of the antitrust law. You can look back at\nthe --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but if we say the rule\nor reason should apply to all cases that just affect\nintrabrand competition, I'm not sure why we should keep\nthis outmoded rule about horizontal conspiracies that\nonly affect intrabrand competition.\nMR. COYKENDALL: There you're striking\nreally at the heart of the -- the heart of the Sherman\nAct, et al., holding that horizontal conspiracies, which\nnobody believes promote competition, could be justified\nunder the same thinking.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, but it's a totally -- I\ncannot imagine why a horizontal conspiracy among dealers\ncould ever produce consumer welfare. It will be a\nhorizontal conspiracy to get more money out of the\nconsumer; but whereas the manufacturer who wants to\nimpose resale price maintenance, his interest isn't to\ngive the retailer as much -- more money than the\nretailer is now making. He's going to try to keep their\nmargin just as low as it ever was, so that he can sell\nas many of his products as possible consistent with his\ndesire to sell his product by attaching to it more\nservice, better warranty, more showrooms, whatever.\nYou know, horizontal conspiracy, the\nincentives are entirely different. When you're dealing\nwith a manufacturer, it seems to me his incentive is\nstill to keep the price as low as possible consistent\nwith the additional good that he wants to give consumers\nto attract those consumers to his product.\nMR. COYKENDALL: In this particular case\nthere is a complete alignment of incentives, because the\nmanufacturer was also a retailer competing in this\nmarket. He has the incentive to increase retailer\nprofits.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if that's the case\nand if that makes a difference, the rule of reason would\nallow you to make that argument. But you -- but you\nwant to say it's bad across the board for everybody. If\nindeed there's something peculiar about this case, the\nrule of reason would allow you to argue that.\nMR. COYKENDALL: Well, Your Honor, we would\nsuggest that the horizontal conspiracy between Leegin as\na retailer and the other retailers offering his products\nis more than just a rule of reason approach. That would\nbe per se illegal under this Court's precedents.\nRetail price maintenance also has the\nproblem we discussed earlier of perpetuating incumbent\nforms of distribution at the expense of the innovative\nand more efficient distribution means. Retailers, in\nretail competition matters, retailers should be entitled\nto innovate, pass efficiencies along to customers in the\nform of lower prices, attract new customers, and grow in\nthat manner.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Coykendall, the -- on\nthe question -- you alleged in the complaint that there\nwas some discounting allowed by, how do you pronounce\nit, Leegin?\nMR. COYKENDALL: Leegin.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Leegin. And Mr. Olson\nsays that that wasn't pursued at trial; is that correct?\nMR. COYKENDALL: That particular aspect was\nreferred to; it wasn't pursued as a separate part of\nthis. Prior to trial, the judge did rule that the\nDr. Miles line of cases applied and the conduct would be\njudged under the per se rule. So certain aspects with\nrespect to the horizontal conspiracy and the differences\nin discounts -- I mean, developed that much.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose you were to lose,\nyou would still have that claim, I take it?\nMR. COYKENDALL: Well, yes. We would\nsuggest the record is sufficient that on remand the\ninstruction given the jury as to the standard by which\ntheir conduct could be judged could be sustained as a\nper se violation under the rules related to horizontal\nconspiracies as well. And again, I would suggest that\nperhaps if the Court doesn't reach that, it should\nremand to the Fifth Circuit for them to consider whether\nthat is a possibility.\nResale price maintenance can distort\nconsumer choice. The retailers -- so the person comes\ninto the store -- the retailers can exercise pressure to\ninfluence the selection of higher margin products over\nones that may better fit the consumer needs. That is an\nevil of resale price maintenance, whether or not it does\npromote efficiencies.\nAnd if resale price maintenance does act as\nit is theorized, to increase retailer services, some\nconsumers will be worse off, they'll be paying for\nservices they don't want.\nThere are alternatives to RPM.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't suppose there's any\n-- I don't suppose there's any way to protect against\nthe fallout to the consumer, is there? I mean if\nindeed, if indeed a store presses on a consumer a\nproduct that's more expensive than what he needs or --\nand what he wants, is this a real argument against this,\nthat there's some stupid consumers whose can be conned?\nI mean, whatever rule we adopt, that's going to be the\nsituation.\nMR. COYKENDALL: Well, if -- what you're\ndoing is you're building in this high margin that gives\nthe retailer an incentive to do that. If there is no\nresale price maintenance so that margin isn't\nguaranteed, the incentive disappears. What is clear is\nthat retail -- resale price maintenance is a blunt\ninstrument to achieve any economies.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're assuming that the --\nthat the retailer has a higher margin on the resale\nprice good. Why do you assume that?\nMR. COYKENDALL: That's the only incentive,\nthe only reason for imposing resale prices\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He's only going to be given\nthe thing if he does the kind of additional service that\nthe manufacturer wants. That's the whole purpose of it.\nAnd the manufacturer is going to try to keep his margin\njust as low as he can consistent with the -- you know --\nconsistent with selling as many products as he can.\nMR. COYKENDALL: Well, there are more\nefficient ways than RPM to achieve any benefits of\nefficiency, such as contracts with the retailers to\nprovide those additional demand creating services. He\ncould pay the retailers to provide those services. He\ncould provide those services directly, I would suggest.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why would you argue\nthat those are more efficient than resale price\nmaintenance?\nMR. COYKENDALL: The resale price\nmaintenance amounts to nothing more than throwing money\nat the problem. You're guaranteeing a margin and you're\nhoping that it's going to be used somehow for the\nconsumer's benefit, and you've got no guarantee that any\ndealer is going to use the margin that they're\nguaranteed in any way to service the consumers.\nAnd I would suggest that in geographically\nisolated areas --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you can add\nthe contractual provisions you were talking about to a\ncontract that has a minimum resale price. The minimum\nresale price is to take away the incentive from the\nretailer not to carry through on the non-price aspects.\nMR. COYKENDALL: If you have a contract\nrequiring those services, you don't need the minimum\nresale price. That's just completely unnecessary. And\nthat would prohibit the efficient dealer from passing on\nthose efficiencies to its consumers.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does that presume a\ncontract in which the retailer has a separate charge for\nthe service?\nMR. COYKENDALL: It could be. It may not.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If not, I don't see how\nthat would work under your rule.\nMR. COYKENDALL: Well, under -- the idea is\nthe manufacturer chooses to deal with only those dealers\nthat offer this particular service. They sign a\ncontract to provide that service. If they don't want to\nprovide that service, they don't sign the contract,\nthese don't get the goods. It's as simple as that.\nIf the question is providing a larger margin\nto the dealer, the most efficient way is for the\nmanufacturer simply to lower their wholesale price, and\nthe margin the dealer receives is higher.\nAgain, if there are other efficiencies, they\nmight be achieved by exclusive territories as permitted\nby Sylvania or by the Colgate doctrine.\nI would suggest the experience of the 30\nyears following the elimination of the fair trade laws\nhave shown the wisdom of the Dr. Miles decision which\nplaces faith in the free market system. This Court\nshould continue to honor its precedents and respect the\nwill of Congress by adhering to the Dr. Miles rule.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your reference to\nthe will of Congress, they haven't enacted legislation\nthat supports the result you seek.\nMR. COYKENDALL: Your Honor, as this Court\nobserved in Sylvania, Congress by repealing the\nMiller-Tydings McGuire Act did indicate its support for\nthe per se rule. I believe the Court should adhere to\nthat holding as well.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Underwood?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA D. UNDERWOOD\nON BEHALF OF NEW YORK AS AMICUS CURIAE\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nWhen a manufacturer agrees with its\nretailers to fix a minimum resale price, the whole point\nof the agreement is to prevent price competition among\nretailers, to prevent discounts. For almost 100 years\nthe Court has interpreted Section 1 of the Sherman Act\nto prohibit such price fixing agreements. Any change in\nthat fundamental understanding of the statute should be\nmade by Congress and not by this Court.\nThe per se rule against resale price\nmaintenance is different in at least three ways from\nother antitrust rules that this Court has overturned.\nFirst, unlike the other rules, it alone has been settled\nlaw for a century, reaffirmed over and over again by\nthis Court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's also been\nsettled law for 90 years under the Colgate doctrine that\nmanufacturers can achieve the same results, albeit more\ninefficiently. Doesn't it make sense to allow them to\nadopt the most efficient means to an end that is already\ncompletely legal?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: No. That tension that you\n-- that supposed anomaly that you described is simply a\nresult of the fact that the antitrust rule -- law does\nnot prohibit all anticompetitive behavior. It prohibits\nagreements that are anti -- that restrain competition.\nAnd so it will often be the case that it is\npossible for somebody unilaterally to do something that\nhas the same effect as an agreement, or approximately\nthe same effect, as the antitrust law simply draws that\nline because of a different value, a value in preserving\nthe independent action of individuals.\nIt is, however --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure it's often the\ncase. Give me some other examples where you can achieve\nthe same industry-wide effect unilaterally.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, as you have observed,\nvirtually any vertical restriction could be accomplished\nby having the manufacturer integrate the retailing\nfunction and become one entity instead of two entities.\nThen the possibility of conspiracy or agreement is\neliminated and the manufacturer, if he simply integrates\nthe whole function, is -- can fix prices, fix his, what\nare in effect his own prices and be outside the reach of\nthe antitrust laws. There are other reasons why a\nmanufacturer might not find it convenient to do that\nintegration, but it is certainly possible by ceasing to\nbe multiple entities and to become one entity to avoid\nthe prohibitions of the antitrust law.\nIt is also -- so, this is old and well\nsettled. Unlike the Schwinn rule against territorial\nrestraints which was overturned only 10 years after it\nwas established, or the Albrecht rule against maximum\nresale price maintenance which was overturned 29 years\nafter it was established, this has a much more settled\npedigree in the law and expectations have grown up\naround it.\nSecond, it was endorsed and relied on by\nCongress, not enacted by Congress but endorsed and\nrelied on by Congress, when Congress repealed the fair\ntrade laws in 1975 by amending the very statute this\nCourt is now asked to interpret.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Were they relying on\nDr. Miles or were they relying on us? That's the\nquestion.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: They were relying --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They left the situation\nwhere it was, which is that the antitrust law is as\ndetermined by this Court, and we had shown our\nwillingness to update the antitrust law when sound\neconomic doctrine suggests is necessary.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: No. The legislative history\ndescribed in some detail in the Antitrust Institute's\nbrief shows that actually they were returning the law to\nthe per se rule against resale price maintenance because\nthey thought resale price maintenance was bad and should\nbe prohibited.\nThis is -- it is also true that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But of course, they\ncould always pass a law saying that if their intent is\nso clear. They didn't do that here.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: That's true, they did not do\nthat here and I'm not suggesting that they did, only\nthat, uniquely among the rules that this Court has\nestablished in the antitrust area, this rule has\nreceived the repeated attention of Congress; and so the\nCourt's deference to Congress and reluctance to overturn\nthe rule should be at its peek as compared with those\nother rules.\nAnd third, price is different. This Court\nhas said that price competition is the central nervous\nsystem of the economy. Other restraints, to be sure,\nmight indirectly affect price, but not with the same\nabsolute force. Territorial restraints don't absolutely\nprevent price competition because customers can travel\nor order by phone, mail, or Internet, and indeed under\nterritorial restraints there are often multiple\nretailers in a particular territory who can compete.\nMaximum price maintenance doesn't prevent competition at\nall unless, as the Court noted in Khan, it's really\nMinimum resale price maintenance in disguise, in which\ncase the Court in Khan said it's illegal.\nManufacturers can of course pay retailers\nfor the services that enhance the product that are being\nadvanced as the pro-competition benefit of resale price\nmaintenance. But the question for this Court is whether\nthe manufacturer should be allowed to use a price-fixing\nagreement to make that payment to buy those services,\nand that's not a question of fact for a jury to decide\nin a rule of reason trial. That's a question of\nstatutory interpretation for this Court. It's a\nquestion really of what kind of currency a manufacturer\ncan use to buy those retailer services.\nIt's also true that the claim that\nprice-fixing works to induce those services is both\ndebatable and untested. The retailers have no\nobligations to provide services under the retail price\nmaintenance agreement at issue in this case and in other\ncases.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they could. I\nmean, you could easily write the agreement saying you\nhave to charge this much and because you have to charge\nthis much you also have to provide the training, the\nservice, whatever the non-price inducements are.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: You could. You could also\nrequire those things without resale price maintenance\nand then the retailer would be free to decide to raise\nthe price to pay for that or to provide it so\nefficiently that he could in effect engage --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But then the\nretailer, but then the retailer might have a real\nincentive not to do a good job on the service because\nthey really want to market it for price, not for\nservice.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: That really depends, doesn't\nit, on what the consumers in the market want, and if\nit's correct, if the manufacturer -- if the claim on\nbehalf of the manufacturer here is correct that what the\ncustomers want is service, the retailers are in at least\nas good a position to identify that fact as not.\nI think the point --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but there you\nhave the free rider problem, which is you go to the\nfancy show room, you figure out what you want, and then\nyou buy it at the discount store.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Yes. That's at its peak,\nperhaps, when you're talking about electronics. When\nthe shopping experience alone is what is thought to be\nthe benefit, which is often the case, you can't free\nride on that. You either shop in the place where you\nlike to shop or you shop -- or you have a different\nshopping experience in Target.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But some manufacturers want\ntheir product associated with excellent service, high\nwarranty, and all of that. And there is no way to get\nthat uniformly for that product without this kind\nof agreement.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Yes, there is. The\nmanufacturer can contract for it. The manufacturer can\ndecline to deal with people who don't provide it. The\nvery same point that was being made earlier.\nI think that the point here is that\npermitting resale price maintenance would be such a\ndrastic change in the longstanding settled\ninterpretation of the Sherman Act that it doesn't really\nqualify as the kind of common law evolution that this\nCourt has said is appropriate ordinarily in making\nantitrust rules under the Sherman Act. If that change\nis to be made at all, it should be made by Congress and\nnot by this Court.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Am I correct on the\ncongressional point that there was a period when\nCongress would have prohibited the Solicitor General\nfrom making the argument he made today?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Yes, there was such a\nperiod. And this Court noted that fact in --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So there was a legislative\nexpression of a position on this particular issue?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: There was a legislative\nexpression of position on this particular issue.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that no longer\nis applicable?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: That is -- the Solicitor\nGeneral is no longer barred from making that argument,\nas is evidenced today. What he --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I guess Congress changed\nits mind then.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: No, I think Congress found\nit unnecessary or perhaps questioned the wisdom or\nconstitutionality of barring the Solicitor General from\nmaking particular arguments.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I find it hard to believe\nthat.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. UNDERWOOD: But Congress has\nconsistently -- well, and the repeal -- the reason the\nrepeal of the Miller-Tydings Act seems particularly\nrelevant is that it is indeed -- it was an amendment to\nthis statute that this Court is being asked to\ninterpret, so it sheds some light on the on the meaning\nof this statute as it stands.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: As Mr. Olson pointed out,\nunder the fair trade laws this was per se legal. So\nthat's kind of a different thing.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Yes. But when Congress\nrepealed that, there were considerable -- there was\nconsiderable expression of legislative history, for\nthose who find legislative history helpful, that\ndeclared opposition to resale price maintenance, not\nsimply that it was sometimes helpful and sometimes\nhurtful. So to the extent Congress's intent can be\ngleaned from that legislative history, it was an intent\nto return to the regime of per se illegality.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Maybe on the year by\nyear, don't spend any money on, maybe Congress decided\nthat wasn't an appropriate technique, but Congress has\nused that after, hasn't it, in other cases?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: It has, but I would question\nthe wisdom of that technique as a method of expressing\nCongress's views. The fact that Congress went so far as\nto use it once suggests a very strong view indeed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMs. Underwood.\nMr. Olson, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. OLSON: The Respondent and its amici\nseem to recognize that what this Court said in State Oil\nversus Khan, that a vertical restraint imposed by a\nsingle manufacturer or wholesaler may stimulate\ninterbrand competition even as it reduces intrabrand\ncompetition and, by the way, it enhances intrabrand\ncompetition on matters of service and availability and\nother things in addition to price. The Respondent and\ntheir amici seem to have acknowledged these\npro-competitive factors but say you should do it by a\ncontract with 5,000 different retailers, which you then\nhave to go out and enforce, or you have to do it under a\nColgate system, which the Ping brief demonstrates it's a\nblunt instrument, it requires terminating retailers with\nwhich you had a relationship for years, it prohibits\neven talking to the loyal retailers to fix small\nproblems.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you're just giving\nthem an additional ground for termination.\nMR. OLSON: Pardon me?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You're just giving, you're\njust suggesting we should give them an additional ground\nfor termination.\nMR. OLSON: No. What we're suggesting is\nthat the agreement is something, the details can be\nworked out. The manufacturer can -- and the Ping brief\nexplains this. The manufacturer can go to the retailer\nand say: Look, maybe you didn't get it right, your\nsales person said the wrong thing; let's fix it, because\nwe want to be dealing together. The antitrust laws --\nin other word, what the Respondent and its amici want or\nthey suggest forward integration, so you just acquire\nall your retailers.\nThe benefits of these type of arrangements\nprovide the consumers with choices. It stimulates\ninterbrand competition. It promotes intrabrand\ncompetition on things other than price. It provides\nconsumers with more choices. It ultimately gives more\nfreedom to the manufacturer to stimulate the sale of its\nproducts, to enter the marketplace.\nThese are things that the Court has said,\nand provides a more varied market price. The court has\nrepeatedly raid that the presumptive rule is a rule of\nreason. Per se rules should be crossed out or not\nadopted unless they're dealing with a practice which is\ninvariably anticompetitive. This practice, as\nacknowledged, is procompetitive. It provides many\nopportunities, and it is irrational for vertical\nrestrictions to exist in this world in the non-price\narea or the maximum price area as subject to the rule of\nreason and the minimum retail price maintenance under a\nrigid per se rule that cannot be changed.\nAnd as this Court has repeatedly held,\nCongress intended by the use of restraint of trade and\nthe unreasonable restraint of trade for this court to\ncontinue to breathe life into the restrictions of the\nantitrust laws in the benefit of the consumer and in the\nbenefit of competition, eliminating rigid per se rules\nwhich make it unlawful for a manufacturer to do\nsomething that's rational in the marketplace, to give\nconsumer choices, or to do it in some indirect way that\nis a lawyer's dream and an entrepreneur's nightmare\nmakes no sense at all.\nFor all those reasons, the rule of reason in\nthis area, as in the other areas, should replace the\nper se rule which is rigid and anticompetitive at the\nend of the day.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Olson.\n"
