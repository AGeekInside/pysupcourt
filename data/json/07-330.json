        "content": "(10:10 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument first today in Case 07-330, Greenlaw versus\nUnited States.\nMs. Howe.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF AMY HOWE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. HOWE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nFor over 200 years, this Court has held,\nwithout exception, that an appellate court may not\nmodify a judgment in a party's favor unless that party\nhas filed a notice of appeal. Such a rule, this Court\nhas explained, serves important interests in notice and\nfinality.\nIn 1984, Congress enacted the Sentencing\nReform Act against the backdrop of this well settled\nrule. In 18 U.S.C. section 3742, Congress provided for\nlimited appellate review of sentencing errors. Nothing\nin the text, structure, or history of section 3742\nreflects any intent by Congress to deviate from the\ninveterate and certain cross-appeal rule, nor is there\nany reason why sentencing appeals should be treated any\ndifferently from other appeals. Instead, section 3742\nreflects traditional principles of appellate\njurisdiction. In --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this\nquestion? I've been thinking about this case.\nSupposing your client prevailed on appeal and they held\na resentencing. Could the district judge have increased\nthe sentence?\nMS. HOWE: No. It could not have because\nthe government --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The district judge could\nnot have increased it? If they sent it back for a new\nsentencing, a fresh hearing on what the sentencing\nshould be, would the district judge have been foreclosed\nfrom giving a higher sentence than he gave the first\ntime?\nMS. HOWE: If -- he would have been\nforeclosed, yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What's the authority for\nthat proposition?\nMS. HOWE: Simply that the -- the district\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Say, if it was a capital\ncase and he won on appeal, he could get the death\nsentence the second time around, which is a little more\nserious sentence.\nWhy couldn't he have gotten a higher\nsentence.\nMS. HOWE: This is a -- the case actually in\nUnited States versus Harvey, which was a case out of the\nThird Circuit, and, although the district court could\norder the same sentence, it can't increase the sentence.\nYes. It would be circumventing the cross-appeal rule.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that based on any --\nany precedent of this Court's?\nMS. HOWE: No. It's based on the\ncross-appeal rule.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So just on the\ncross-appeal rule?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought\nit would depend on what the mandate from the court of\nappeals said. If the mandate said the sentence is\nvacated and the case is remanded for resentencing, it\nseems to me that leaves open the full range of\nlegitimate sentencing.\nMS. HOWE: Certainly. I mean, our argument\nwould be that the -- you know, if the court of appeals\ncan't order the sentence increased, that on remand the\ndistrict court couldn't circumvent the cross-appeal rule\nby increasing the sentence as well.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the court\nof appeals -- if your argument is correct, the court of\nappeals is limited solely by virtue of the failure to\nfile a notice of cross-appeal. That -- that's a\nlimitation that wouldn't apply in the district court.\nMS. HOWE: No, that's certainly true, that\nit would be circumventing the cross-appeal rule to allow\nthe district court to do something that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And it would also, I take\nit, be circumventing what could happen in the district\ncourt. You have to move very -- seven days in the\ndistrict court for mathematical error, and that's it.\nMS. HOWE: Yes, under this rule.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Other than for assistance\n--\nMS. HOWE: Yes, the district court has, I\nbelieve, seven days to correct the sentence.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This would not be a\nmathematical error?\nMS. HOWE: No. This would not be a\nmathematical error, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I could have sworn that\nI've seen more than one petition for certiorari in which\nthe claim is that the sentence was increased on remand\nvindictively. I'm sure I've seen cert petitions like\nthat. And you're telling me that the assertion of\nvindictiveness is unnecessary, and it just can't be\nincreased on remand?\nBut all you have is a court of appeals case\nfor that.\nMS. HOWE: Yes, we --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Perhaps that's after a new\ntrial.\nMS. HOWE: Perhaps.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What happens if it's --\nwhat happens if the sentence is five years, reversed on\nappeal, error in evidence, same -- same offense, same\nindictment? Then you have to comply with the\nvindictiveness rules before he can give a higher\nsentence?\nMS. HOWE: I think it might be different if\nit were -- if there were a new trial on the same\nindictment. But -- you know, going back to the\ncross-appeal rule, I mean, the court of appeals could --\nthe district court could certainly impose the same\nsentence.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What do you think is the\nrule if there's a new trial and the judge says, you\nknow, what about this, I heard the evidence again; I\nthink I'm going to increase the sentence?\nMS. HOWE: Well, our argument would be that\nthe government had forfeited the right to make that\nargument and that the district court would not be -- you\nknow, that would essentially be sua sponte ordering --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But what's sua sponte --\nMS. HOWE: You know, if the government had\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's a resentence.\nThere's a new judgment, a new conviction. What happens\nthen?\nMS. HOWE: New judgment and conviction -- it\n-- the rule may be different. Unless double jeopardy\nmay apply as well.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Double jeopardy if it's a\nnew judge? Is that what you said?\nMS. HOWE: I -- I'm not sure.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Who asked this question?\nWe're going to get a totally different case here.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Let's go back to where\nyou started, and that was with the statute, 37 -- what\nis it? 42?\nMS. HOWE: 42.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- (f). And the -- that\nhas two subparts, and the first part just says the court\nof appeals can decide whether a sentence was imposed in\nviolation of law, period.\nAnd (2) has two subparts that refer to the\nparty appealing. So why doesn't the first one cover\nboth sides when the second one is distinctly divided\ninto (a) and (b) parts?\nMS. HOWE: Certainly, Justice Ginsburg. And\nthat -- this is reprinted on page 5a of the government's\nbrief. And the inference that I think,\nJustice Ginsburg, you're drawing and that the amicus\nwould have you draw is that the fact that the subsection\n(f)(2), which is on page 6a, subsection (f)(2)(A) and\n(b) refer to whether the appeal has been filed; whereas,\nsubsection (f)(1) says not, which means that, in some\ncircumstances, the cross-appeal rule does not apply in\ncircumstances such as that.\nBut our interpretation, which we think is\nthe correct one, is that the only reason that subsection\n(f)(1) does not refer to whether an appeal has been\nfiled is that subsection (f)(1) refers to the kind of\nclaims that both defendants and the government can\nbring; whereas, subsection (f)(2) parallels\nsubsections(a)(3) and (b)(3), but (c), only the\ndefendant can appeal an upward departure; only the\ngovernment can appeal a downward departure.\nAnd our interpretation, again, which we\nthink is the correct one, is that subsection (f)(1)\ndoesn't need to refer to whether an appeal has been\nfiled, because -- because both the defendant and the\ngovernment can bring those kinds of appeals.\nAnd even if you don't agree with that\ninterpretation, I think it's worth noting that the\namicus -- that the amicus's construction is further\nflawed for three reasons. And the first is that that\nwould cause subsection (f)(2) to operate illogically.\nThere's no reason why the -- for example, if you had a\ncase in which the defendant had appealed and the\ngovernment had not appealed, under this interpretation\nthe court of appeals could increase a sentence if it\nfound there had been a misapplication of the Guidelines\nthat would result in an increase in the defendant's\nsentence; but the court of appeals would not be allowed\nto increase the defendant's sentence if it found that\nthere was an unwarranted downward departure, because the\ngovernment had filed a notice of appeal. We don't think\n-- that doesn't make any sense. We don't think there's\nany reason why Congress would have intended for it to\noperate this way.\nThe second reason is that this is a very\nthin reed to rest this construction of the statute on,\ngiven that Congress must have been aware of the\ncross-appeal rule. There's no reason to think that it\nwould have departed from two centuries of appellate\npractice in this way, based on this -- this very thin\nreed, and in fact we know from the Organized Crime\nControl Act of 1970 that Congress was aware of the\ncross-appeal rule because in that case it expressly\ncarved out that exception --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What happens if it's just\nthe converse case? The same thing, I take it.\nMS. HOWE: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE BREYER: We have a government\nappeal. The sentence was 10 years. The government\nthinks it should be 20.\nOn appeal, the appellate court thinks the\ngovernment is wrong, and moreover, the appellate court\ndiscovers an error: It should have been one year. And\nyou're saying, well, according to you, not only is the\ncourt of appeals helpless, but the district court is\nhelpless. So this person is in jail for nine years\nwhere he shouldn't have been. That's your position\nhere?\nMS. HOWE: That's correct, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's a pretty tough\nposition. It -- it seems to me there could be errors --\nand I guess if he's sentenced to death, it's the same.\nI mean, the -- the -- it's a pretty tough position,\nisn't it? That there is no authority in the courts of\nappeals, or in the district court, or anywhere in the\nsystem to create -- to correct a serious error where a\nperson could, in fact, be in prison for a long time\ncontrary to the law.\nMS. HOWE: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: How is it supposed to work\nin your system that we get those errors corrected?\nMS. HOWE: I have three points,\nJustice Breyer.\nThe first is that Congress must have been\naware of this scenario in particular because in the\nOrganized Crime Control Act of 1970, when the government\nappeals, that -- in those provisions, that brought up\nthe defendant's sentence and his conviction for review.\nAnd Congress decided, for whatever reason, not to\ncontinue that -- that exception to the cross-appeal rule\nwhen it enacted the Sentencing Reform Act.\nThe second point, Justice Breyer, is that\nwe're not aware that there's actually any body of case\nlaw in which this happened. No one has pointed to any\ncases in which this has actually happened. The --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I believe you say it has\ndecided not to make an exception to the cross-appeal\nrule. Of course, the cross-appeal rule itself is not\nstatutory, is it?\nMS. HOWE: The cross-appeal rule itself is\nnot statutory, but --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It's an arguable rule\namong the courts of appeal as to whether there is such a\nrule.\nMS. HOWE: It is indeed, Justice Stevens,\nbut --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So it's not surprising\nthat Congress didn't make exception to a rule that isn't\nthat firmly established.\nMS. HOWE: It is not surprising, but we know\nfrom the Organized Crime Control Act that Congress\ncertainly was aware of the cross-appeal rule, because in\nthat case it did carve out a limited exception.\nAnd my third point, Justice Breyer,\nreturning to your question, is that the defendant in\nthat case may well have an argument, may be able to seek\npost-conviction relief under section 2255, as the\nGovernment acknowledges in its brief.\nSo he may be able to go back to the district\ncourt under section 2255 and obtain relief in that\nmanner.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought it was sort of an\nimportant part of your case that the cross-appeal rule\nwas an established rule. You now knowledge that it's\nnot an established rule?\nMS. HOWE: Well, we do believe it is\njurisdictional, Justice Scalia. In the Morley case,\nwhich we think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not just jurisdictional but\nwell-established.\nMS. HOWE: We believe it is both\nwell-established and jurisdictional. And we believe, in\nparticular, when you're talking about sentencing, even\nif you don't agree with us that the cross-appeal rule\ngenerally is jurisdiction, we believe that section 3742\nis jurisdictional. Because it sets out in subsections A\nand B, the kinds of errors that defendants and the\ngovernment can bring.\nBut we also believe that it ultimately\ndoesn't matter in this case, Justice Scalia, because\neven if, as amicus concedes, it is merely a rule of\npractice, it is a rule of practice that is not subject\nto exception, and Mr. Greenlaw timely invoked it at his\nearliest opportunity.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you say it is a\nwell-established at least rule of practice.\nMS. HOWE: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And what's to be said\nagainst that? How many courts of appeals do not apply\nthat?\nMS. HOWE: The Eighth Circuit in this case\ncertainly does not apply it. The Tenth Circuit --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they --\nMS. HOWE: They acknowledge.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They didn't apply it under\nthis statute. I am saying, apart from this statute,\nwhat courts of appeals in other cases deny the existence\nof a cross-appeal rule?\nMS. HOWE: The District of Columbia Circuit\nand the Ninth Circuit both regard it is a rule of\npractice that may be subject to exceptions and\nexceptional circumstances. But, even if it is a rule of\npractice, Justice Scalia, we still prevail because\nMr. Greenlaw has timely invoked it at his earliest\nopportunity and because in a sentencing context it is\nnot subject to any exception.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What difference does it\nmake? Now, you said this is a jurisdictional rule\nbecause its no rule. What difference does it make if it\nis labeled \"jurisdictional,\" or if it is just regarded\nas a tight procedural requirement?\nMS. HOWE: It makes a difference,\nJustice Ginsburg, in the sense that it cannot be waived\nif it is jurisdictional. The Court can raise it at any\ntime. If it is a rule of practice, it is subject to\nexception below. In this -- as in this case with this\nrule, the Court has not found an exception in over 200\nyears. The -- in the sentencing context in particular,\nit is not subject to exception.\nAnd Mr. Greenlaw timely invoked it. If this\nCourt has no further questions, I'd like to reserve the\nremainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms. Howe.\nMs. Maynard.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. MAYNARD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Court of Appeals erred in increasing\nPetitioner's sentence for two reasons:\nFirst, it lacked jurisdiction to do so in\nthe absence of a notice of appeal by the Government\nunder 18 USC 3742(b).\nSecond, even assuming it did not strictly\nlack jurisdiction, it nevertheless violated the\nmandatory claim- processing rule that a judgment may not\nbe increased in favor of an appellee in the absence of a\ntimely --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Now, if the cross-appeal\nrule is jurisdictional, how do you account for the\nsentencing-package cases? The court makes a mistake on\ncount 1, and the district court makes a mistake on count\n1, the court of appeals vacates the entire sentence for\nthe development of a new sentencing package.\nMS. MAYNARD: Those cases are not\ninconsistent with the finding of jurisdictional, Justice\nAlito, because in those cases the court of appeals has\ngranted the defendant's requested relief, and it has\nvacated the judgment at the request of the defendant.\nAnd then, once it goes back to the district\ncourt, what the district court may lawfully do would\nturn on the scope of the mandate, not on principles of\nthe cross-appeal rule.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But in this very case\ncould the court of appeals said: We will grant the\nappellant a new sentencing hearing and send the case\nback to the district for resentencing; and, by the way,\ndistrict judge, when you do the resentencing, take a\nlook at the section that imposes a mandatory minimum?\nCould they have done that?\nMS. MAYNARD: If the court of appeals had\nfound an error at the defendant's request, yes,\nJustice Stevens, and remanded it, depending on the scope\nof the mandate and under the scope of the mandate --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And you could have ended\nup with precisely the same result that they ended up\nwith in this case.\nMS. MAYNARD: But it would have been a key\ndifference in the sense that they would have found some\nof the defendant's claims on appeal correct. Here the\ncourt of appeals rejected all of the defendant's claims;\nand, nevertheless, in the absence of a government\nappeal, increased the Petitioner's sentence.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So if the Court of Appeals\nhad said that the sentence that was imposed by the\ndistrict court was unreasonable by two months and\naccepted the defendant's argument to that extent and\nthen remanded, on remand the district court could have\ncorrected the sentence on the gun counts.\nMS. MAYNARD: It would have depended on how\nthe mandate was worded. But if they vacated the\nsentence in its entirety and remanded it, the district\ncourt could have imposed a lawful sentence at that time.\nYes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though the\nprosecution didn't ask for it? I thought that you were\nrelying on the division of authority between the\nexecutive, the prosecutor, and the court. And that is\nthat a court reacts to the charges that the prosecutor\nbrings, and if the prosecutor isn't asking for a higher\nsentence, the court has no authority to grant it.\nMS. MAYNARD: Yes, Your Honor. In the court\nof appeals that is true. But I understood\nJustice Alito's hypothetical to posit a situation where\nat the defendant's request his sentence was vacated.\nAnd then what the district court could do on remand\nwould depend on the scope of the mandate .\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why not? Why wouldn't\nthe prosecutor still have control and say: Judge, the\ngovernment is asking for ten years, no more?\nMS. MAYNARD: Before the district court,\nJustice Ginsburg, the government would be required to\npress the law. And, as it did here, the law is that\nunder 924(c) this is a second, or subsequent, conviction\nin count 10; and it is error. Petitioner should have\nbeen sentenced to a second, or subsequent, sentence of\n25 years on count 10.\nSo if it were back in the district court and\nthe district court were free under the scope of the\ncourt of appeals mandate to impose sentence, then the\ngovernment would be obligated to argue the law before\nthe district court. What --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, usually the\nmandate in these cases simply says, you know, the case\nis remanded to the district court.\nIf that's all the mandate says, does that\nauthorize the district court to do the right thing under\nthe law?\nMS. MAYNARD: The courts of appeals have\ndifferent rules, Your Honor, about whether or not a\ngeneral mandate of the type that you posit should be\nassumed to open up all issues for sentencing or not.\nAnd there's actually some disagreement in\nthe circuit on what one assumes from a general mandate.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, actually rule 35 was\nchanged because it used to be based on the mandate. But\nnow rule 35 says you can reopen within seven days after\nthe verdict or finding of guilty. So that would\nindicate under the rules that the mandate is irrelevant.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, no, Your Honor. I think\nrule 35 speaks to what the district can do within seven\ndays of renouncing the sentence. Once the sentence is\ntimely appealed, if the defendant were to prevail or if\nthe government were to prevail in a case in which the\ngovernment had actually appealed and it were to be\nremanded, then the defendant --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Within the scope of the\nappeal, which brings us right back to this case.\nMS. MAYNARD: Within the scope of the\nmandate.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I don't understand your\nmandate rule as being consistent with your general\ntheory of the case. Because if the court of appeals\ncannot order this kind of relief, how could it be that\nthe court of appeals' mandate would authorize the\nrelief?\nIt would seem to me that you've either got\nto take the position that the mandate is, in effect, a\nkind of neutral order. The district courts may or may\nnot have authority to do something after the mandate\ncomes down. But I don't see how you can take the\nposition that the mandate, itself, by the court of\nappeals will, itself, determine what the district court\ncan do.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Because, in effect, I think\nyou are saying, by structuring the mandate in a certain\nway, the court of appeals can open the door to something\nthat the court of appeals, itself, could not do. But by\nstructuring the mandate in a different way, the court of\nappeals can cut off the possibility of district court\norders of a sort that the court of appeals couldn't do.\nAnd that seems -- that is what seems to me inconsistent\nwith your theory of the limited court of appeals\njurisdiction.\nMS. MAYNARD: I don't think it is anomalous,\nYour Honor, in a case in which the court of appeals has\njurisdiction over a claim, grants the requested relief,\nand vacates the sentence. For then, what the district\ncourt can do can turn on the scope of the court of\nappeals mandate.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Now, let's\nconsider -- assuming that the mandate leaves open -- the\nquestion open entirely for the district court.\nYou said ultimately what the district court\ncan do depends on the mandate. Can the court of appeals\nalso by mandate say: And by the way, district court,\nbecause we couldn't increase the sentence here, you\ncan't do it either? Is that open to the court of\nappeals?\nMS. MAYNARD: I don't know there's any court\nof appeals that has held that it could do that. It --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then what is the play in\nthe mandate that you are assuming when you say it\ndepends on the mandate? What the district court can do\nwould depend on the mandate.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, I'm not sure I\nunderstand the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Where is the -- what option\ndoes the court of appeals -- given the limits on what\nthe court of appeals itself can order, what are the\noptions that the court of appeals has in writing the\nmandate that will determine what the district court can\ndo? What are you getting at.\nMS. MAYNARD: I'm not sure that that's -- I\ndon't know the precise contours of that, Justice Souter,\nbut if the court of appeals grants the Petitioner's\nrequest to vacate the sentence --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah.\nMS. MAYNARD: -- and then remands for\nresentencing, in a general way, that could leave open to\nthe district court the ability to resentence.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMS. MAYNARD: But one --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Now you say that could\nleave open -- if a mandate is general, that could leave\nopen. Can the mandate be specific in precluding?\nMS. MAYNARD: Given the lack of an appeal\nhere.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah.\nMS. MAYNARD: By the government?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah.\nMS. MAYNARD: I -- I suppose it -- it might\ndo that. I suppose it -- it might be able to do that.\nHere --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't know about your\ninitial premise. I -- I take it the policy here is that\nthe defendant who appeals ought to know what's at stake\nin the appeal. He shouldn't be surprised.\nMS. MAYNARD: That's right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If he cross-appeals, fine;\nif he doesn't cross-appeal, he knows what the stakes\nare.\nMS. MAYNARD: That's right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But now you're saying that\nif the sentence is -- is vacated, they can start all\nover? That the district court can't start all over if\nit's still in the district court. Why should the court\nof appeals have any more authority than the district\ncourt does?\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, because it -- once\nthe court -- if the Petitioner -- I mean -- at any risk\nin any appeal, and this is true in civil cases, too, you\nknow, if you seek a new trial on damages, for example,\nin a civil case, because of instructional error, and you\ngo back, I think, you know, the jury who decides the\ndamages a second time isn't bound by the first jury's\ndecision. Any time --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the -- the\ndefendant who is appealing has to be very careful about\nthe relief he requests? He says I don't want the\nsentence vacated; I want the sentence reduced to five\nyears instead of 10.\nAnd nothing else? That's the only relief I\nseek?\nMS. MAYNARD: I think if the court of\nappeals finds error in the sentence it vacates under the\n-- the remedial provisions in 3742 for the -- for the\ncourt -- for the district court to resentence the\nPetitioner.\nFor example --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well -- if that's the case,\nif the -- if the -- if it cannot be structured by the\nrequest for relief as the Chief Justice is suggesting,\nthen on the Government's theory, in a case like this, if\nthe defendant wins on appeal, he is in serious trouble\nwhen that case goes back to the district court; whereas\nif he loses, he can't be any worse off than he is now.\nThat's a strange -- that's a strange rule.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, if the defendant wins in\nthe sentencing appeal, there -- there's always a chance\nthat on -- on remand, the -- the district court will\nreconfigure the sentence.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But in effect that means\nthen -- and this -- I didn't understand this to be your\nposition -- but that means, in effect, that the\ncross-appeal rule is essentially, as you're arguing for\nit, a formality. It limits what the district court can\ndo, but it is not a rule that embodies the notion that\nwhen a defendant appeals the defendant ought to know, in\neffect, what he can gain and what he can lose; because\nif, on your theory, if the defendant wins and there's a\nmandate back to the district court, it is wide open.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, I think, you know, if\nyou look at cases -- recent -- I think post-Booker for\nexample --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I want to look at\nthem but I want to know what your position is first.\nAnd I take it your position is that if the defendant\nwins, and he cannot by his request for leave limit the\nrelief, as the Chief Justice suggested, then when the\ncase goes back to the district court, in effect, the\nslate is totally blank and he's starting all over again\nand he is subject to -- to whatever outer limits he\nwould have been subject to in the first instance.\nMS. MAYNARD: Right. I was going to use the\nBooker case as an example. Post-Booker, you know,\ndefendants have appeals, saying I was innocent, or\nmandatory Guidelines regime, and I want to be sentenced\nunder the advisory Guidelines regime. And when those is\ncans have gone back, this -- courts of appeals have --\nmost of the courts of appeals have held that the\ndistrict court is not bound by original sentence -- it's\nnot free from the mandatory Guidelines. It can consider\nall the factors as instructed by the Court, and isn't\nsimply decrease the sentence. And I think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then the cross-appeals rule\nis essentially a rule of appellate court procedure and\nnothing more.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, I think in this\nsituation, actually -- it definitely is a rule of\nappellate court procedure.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah. But --\nMS. MAYNARD: And it's definitely a\nmandatory --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it doesn't go beyond\nthat?\nMS. MAYNARD: I think that's correct. If\nyou succeed on your appeal you may end up in the\ndistrict court worse off than when you began. But the\nissue before this Court is what can a court of appeals\ndo in the absence of a party pressing a claim before it.\nAnd --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In that context,\naren't -- aren't you concerned about enlisting the court\nof appeals in doing something illegal? I mean, they\nknow that what they're authorizing, or imposing really,\nas a sentence is illegal.\nMS. MAYNARD: No. All they -- all they're\ndoing, Your Honor, as we requested, is rejecting the\nPetitioner's claims on appeal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm reminded of what\nwe do in statutory cases. If one party says this is, it\nshould be read A, and the other party says it should be\nread B, we've had cases where we say, well, they're both\nwrong, and we're going to read the statute as C because\nwe the Court want to do the right thing.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, the Government is not\nagreeing that there was -- with the Petitioner there was\nno deal error. What the Government is saying -- the\nquestion is -- so this is not a situation like you're\npositing, where the parties are trying to agree to the\ngoverning law. This is a question of which issues are\nproperly in the court of appeals to start with.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, in my\nhypothetical they weren't agreeing. One side was saying\nB, the other side was saying A.\nMS. MAYNARD: Fair enough.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the right answer\nwas C.\nMS. MAYNARD: Fair enough, but here it is,\nthere's no disagreement about what the merits of the\ngoverning law is; the question is, is that question\nproperly before the court of appeals.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why didn't the Government\ncross-appeal in this case?\nMS. MAYNARD: There's nothing in the record\nto indicate why the government didn't cross-appeal,\nJustice Ginsburg. But there are good reasons why the\ngovernment wouldn't cross-appeal in any given case.\nThere are 8,000 plus adverse decisions against the\ngovernment in 2007, and reasons why the government might\nnot cross-appeal or appeal in a given case include the\nlength of the sentence the person has already received,\nwhether there's a need for clarification of a particular\nquestion of law, whether this is a recurring error --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there problem of\ngetting the Solicitor General's office to authorize the\nappeal?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Maynard --\nMS. MAYNARD: But the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me many of\nthese horribles really exist, however we decide this\ncase. I don't know that anybody says that if there is\nnot a firm rule requiring the -- a cross-appeal, I don't\nknow that anybody says that the court of appeals must\nsearch the record and correct any errors below.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, the amicus is\narguing that's the meaning of 3742 --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The statute talks about the\ngeneral --\nMS. MAYNARD: In general --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The general cross-appeal\nrule --\nMS. MAYNARD: But there --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It happens all the time,\nthat there's an error in the judgment which the court of\nappeals does not -- does not reach because there's no\ncourt -- no cross-appeal. It's totally unexceptionable.\nMS. MAYNARD: Exactly, Your Honor. And that\n-- the danger to parties, in particular to the\ngovernment in having courts reach out and arrogate to\nthemselves the decision -- thank you -- the decision to\nappeal is -- is illustrated by this particular case. In\nfootnote 6 of the court of appeals opinion it recognizes\na second error that aggrieves the government, deciding\nit was plain --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I just ask this one\nquestion? This problem has been around for a long, long\ntime; and sometimes cross-appeals -- courts of appeals\nhave corrected what they thought was plain error, and\nwithout a cross-appeal there.\nHas that generated a whole lot of problems\nover the years? I mean there are isolated cases that\nyou've all been able to find searching 30 or 40 years of\njurisprudence, but I don't see any widespread problem\nbeing generated by the courts of appeals who have\ndisagreed with your view.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, if I could make two\npoints. The court of appeals actually found two errors\nthat aggrieved the government here, Justice Stevens, and\nruled for us only on one. So in a case where we didn't\nnotice an appeal, on an issue we did not brief, the\ncourt of appeals ruled against us.\nAnd second, I'm aware of no case in this\nCourt where this Court has reached out to find plain\nerror on behalf of a nonpetitioning respondent or a\nnon-appealing appellate.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMs. Maynard.\nMr. Jorgensen.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY T. JORGENSEN,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nIN SUPPORT OF THE JUDGMENT BELOW\nMR. JORGENSEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThere are three questions really in this\ncase, and the Court need not resolve all of them\ndepending upon how it resolves the others, but some of\nthem get lost sometimes, so I would like to state what\nthe three are.\nThe three are first, does section 3742\nprovide an answer? Is it an affirmative grant of power\nto the court of appeals to the Eighth Circuit to give\nthe right answer when the Petitioner asked them is my\nsentence imposed in violation of law? Or is it a limit\non the court's power telling them they cannot provide\nhim with relief? That's the first question.\nIf the Court concludes that it's neither --\nif a Court a court concludes either that it is a grant\nof jurisdiction, or rather a power -- or that it's not,\nthat it's an affirmative limit, then the -- if the Court\nconcludes that 3742 is more like 1291, just a general\nappellate statute that does not give the answer here,\nthen the Court has to go on to decide is this case -- is\nthis rule, this cross-appeal rule, in the criminal\ncontext not the civil context that is -- that is subject\nof this 200 years of discussion, but in the criminal\ncontext is it a jurisdictional limit on what the courts\ncan do or is it a rule of practice.\nAnd then finally, if the Court concludes --\nif the Court concludes it is a jurisdictional limit,\nthen that's the end. If the Court concludes that it is\na rule of practice, the final third question is: Is it\na waivable rule of practice or is it a firm and\ninflexible rule of practice? I think what often gets\nassumed. But, of course, in Kontrick, in Bowles, the\nCourt addresses the issue in that case -- in those cases\nand decides whether the rule of practice at issue in\nthat case --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Jorgensen, suppose I\nthink there's a larger anterior question to all of this?\nAnd that is what I suggested in the colloquy with\nMs. Howe, we have a system in which the prosecutor can\nbring charges. The judge may think, my goodness,\nlooking at this set of facts, you could have charged\nmuch more.\nThe judge can't do that, he can't tell the\nprosecutor you have to charge \"Y\" in addition to \"X\".\nThe government chooses not to appeal. Now, what right\ndoes the court say, I know you didn't appeal,\nGovernment, but should have so we're going to take care\nof it for you?\nIt seems to me that our system rests on a\nprinciple of party presentation as many systems do not.\nIn many systems, the court does shape the controversy\nand can intrude issues on its own. But in our\nadversarial system, we rely on counsel to do that kind\nof thing. So, my problem with your whole position,\nwithout getting down to particular statutory provisions,\nis what business does the court have to put an issue in\nthe case that counsel chose not to raise?\nMR. JORGENSEN: The answer to that question,\nJustice Ginsburg, is multi-part, and I'll try to move\nthrough it quickly. This Court had said -- made the\nvery point that you made at the charging stage. That at\nthe charging stage the court -- the district court\ncannot decide what a criminal will be charged with; but\nthat once the trial has proceeded to judgment, that\nprosecutorial discretion is at an end. I wish I could\nremember the name of the case, but Justice Scalia was\nthe author.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Me, too.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. JORGENSEN: The point being that once a\ncrime has been proven, the law kicks in, and the\ndefendant must be sentenced in accordance with lawful.\nThe same is true on appeal. I'm not advocating here\nfor, I think, what your question would assume, which\nwould be a roving court of jurisdiction -- a roving\ncourt of appeals that could reach out and take\njurisdiction over a case that has not been brought to\nit.\nUnder 3742 no one questions that the court\nhas jurisdiction over the case, over the very sentencing\nissues because somebody has filed a notice of appeal and\nbrought it to the court. The only question is when the\ndefendant says to the court under 3742(a)(1) was my\nsentence imposed and the statutory languages in\nviolation of law, can the Eighth Circuit provide the\nright answer or is it powerless to provide the right\nanswer to only provide an answer that benefits him?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could we discuss -- let's\nleave aside for the moment what the background rule of\nlaw is and discuss whether -- I guess it was your first\npoint -- whether this particular statute proscribes the\nanswer, and therefore, we don't have to go any further.\nWhy do you say it proscribes the answer?\nMR. JORGENSEN: I believe that it does,\nJustice, because everybody agrees that the Sentencing\nReform Act was a clean break with the past and imposed\nan entirely new regime. So, the talk about the regime\nof the past is somewhat beside the point.\nSo then you get down to the language itself\nof section 3742. Under (a), it provides that a\ndefendant may ask the court of appeals was my sentence\nimposed in violation of law; and under (b)(1), the\ngovernment can raised same appeal. Then under (d), the\nparties certify to the court or bring to the court the\nrecord that they think addresses the issue that either\nside raised; and then in (e), the court -- (e) says the\ncourt shall decide whether it was imposed in violation\nof law; and then (f) (1) says if the court determines\nthat it was imposed in violation of law, it shall send\nit back with instructions.\nNow, the main answer to that is well,\n(f)(1) -- you have to get all the way to (f)(1) before\nyou have got the answer. And that's unsurprising. I\ndon't think any member of the court would say that the\nEighth Circuit lacks the power, is barred from noticing\nthe 924(c) error here.\nCertainly the Eighth Circuit could see it;\ncertainly the Eighth Circuit could say it. I see the\nerror here. The only question is, can it provide the\nremedy? And that's what (f)(1) says.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why would -- why\nwould Congress want a different disposition for (f)(1)\nthan for (f)(2)? It's clear under (f)(2) if the\nsentence is outside the applicable guidelines and the --\nor if the departure is based on an impermissible factor\nor is to an unreasonable degree or the sentence was\nimposed for an offense for which there is no applicable\nguideline and its plainly unreasonable, for that, it is\nclear that if it hasn't been raised by one or the other\nparty, the court doesn't get into it.\nWhy would it want a different rule for those\ntwo? In other words, I'm saying that far from\nsupporting your case, as your brief suggests, (f)(2) (a)\nand (a) seems to me harms your case.\nMR. JORGENSEN: If I can give a two-part\nanswer, Justice. First, the court is not in the\npractice of overturning what the plain language says on\na sort of legislative history or surmising what Congress\nmay have been motivated by. But even if it were, there\nis a clear answer.\n(F)(1) subsumes (a)(1) and (a)(2) and (b)(1)\nand (b)(2). And the questions under those statutes or\nrather those provisions are legal questions. The kind\nof questions was this sentence imposed under (a)(1),\n(b)(1) in violation of law or (a)(2), (b)(2), was it an\nincorrect application of Sentencing Guidelines?\nIf the court of appeals gets that wrong,\nthat's the kind of thing that's going to be imposed in\neverybody else's case. Under (3) and (4) it's this\ndefendant's case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Wait, (2)(a) and (b) I\nthought -- do I not have this right, (2)(a) and (b) say\nthe same thing as (1)? It says if the sentence is too\nhigh says the defendant's appeal, then what you do is\nyou vacate it and send it back with such instructions as\nthe court considers appropriate.\nMR. JORGENSEN: Indeed.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Subject to (g), which has\nto do with the district court.\nThen the other part says if it is too low\nand it was the government that appealed, the court shall\nset it aside and send it back with such instructions as\nit considers appropriate, again subject to (g).\nSo all three say the same thing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not if it's too high and\nthe defendant has appealed.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's what --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not if it's too high and\nthe government has appealed.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If it's too high and the\ngovernment has appealed, you don't get any relief\nunder -- under --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, do you. If it's too\nhigh -- wait. Wait. If it is too -- ah.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: I see.\nMR. JORGENSEN: You're exactly right,\nJustice Scalia. So the question is, why would Congress\nsay what is plainly said, which is under (f)(1)\nviolations of law and incorrect applications of the\nSentencing Guidelines, the court gives the right answer\nno matter who appeals. But under (f)(2) Congress\nspecifies it matters under this who appeals. And the\nreason is, in those instances, it is too high in this\ndefendant's case, and this defendant can be entrusted to\nforward his own cause; but under (a)(1) and (a)(2), then\nyou get a court of appeals precedent that gives the\nwrong answer, if a question of law or the application of\nthe Sentencing Guidelines.\nSo there is a difference between (a)(1),\n(a)(2), (b)(1), (b)(2) as --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, that difference\ndisappears if you say that, in fact, the whole thing\nassumes that the factor complained of has been brought\nto the court's attention by the proper person. So that\n(f)(1) assumes that if it's the government appealing in\nviolation of law because the defendant was given too\nlittle, or if it's the defendant appealing because in\nviolation of law that he was given too much, it makes\nmuch more sense that way, it seems to me.\nMR. JORGENSEN: That -- that -- if the Court\nwere to go there, Justice, I believe that goes back to\nyou previous question of: Should we assume or should\nthe Court believe that Congress was aware of its\nhistory --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The way to do this then is\n-- is -- I see -- this section foresees basically what\nthe other side is saying. It foresees it, because it's\na very unusual case what happened here.\nMR. JORGENSEN: It is a very --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So the way you should\nhandle it, given this section, is the court of appeals\nwould send -- I'm trying this on -- the court of appeals\nsays, well, it's the defendant that appealed, who\nappealed. He says the sentence is too high. Given what\nwe have in front us in the issues, he's right; now we've\nnoticed that there's is other problems here. So what we\ndo is send it back for resentencing. And, Judge, when\nyou resentence, look at it. And see if maybe we're\nright. That would be a perfectly fair way to handle it,\nand a normal way to handle it. Is that right?\nMR. JORGENSEN: Well, importantly, Justice,\none, two, three, and four, one being: Is it posed in\nviolation of law? Two: Is it incorrection application\nof Sentencing Guideline (c)(3)? Or is it too high?\nThere's a body of case law as to what kind of a field --\nfields fit within what category. And the parties and\nthe courts of appeals are united in believing that the\nPetitioner's question in this case fits within (a)(1):\nWas his sentence imposed in vital of law.\nBut, as you know, the Court created the\nreasonableness question in Booker, and then the courts\nof appeals have agreed that that fits in within(a)(1).\nJUSTICE BREYER: But you don't have --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it's not enough to say,\nwell, we've noticed by the way we're -- you know, in\nlooking at the proper appeal by the proper -- my\ngoodness, look what we've noticed.\nIt's not that. You're saying the court of\nappeals has to search the record. It has to make sure\nthat there were no errors in favor -- or harming the\nother party who has not cross-appealed.\nAnd that's a considerable burden, as Judge\nBoudin's opinion on the court of appeals makes clear.\nMR. JORGENSEN: Indeed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And it's extraordinary.\nMR. JORGENSEN: Indeed, although it is what\n3742 says, and I believe it's actually not that\ndifferent than what happens with jurisdictional issues.\nThe court must resolve those that are brought to it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Precisely so.\nMR. JORGENSEN: And then the court notices\nthe ones that are obvious, has a duty to look for them\nbecause --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which is why we have tried\nto pare down what is jurisdictional.\nMR. JORGENSEN: And on that question, I --\nbefore the time runs out, I want to, Justice Scalia,\nfollow up on your question, which is: What if the Court\nassumes that 3742 does not provide the answer? Which is\nI believe where you're going.\nThen the Court confronts the question of, is\nthe cross-appeal rule jurisdictional or a rule of\npractice? Now, the Court has provided the answer to\nthat once in, I believe it said, Langnes, and said that\nit is a rule of practice. And then since, there's been\nobviously a long period of time. And then the Court has\nhad its series of cases contra Bowles, Arbaugh. And\nunder those cases, there is no good argument that it's\njurisdictional. The teachings of those cases is that\nthe Court has used the phrases \"power\" and\n\"jurisdiction\" too broadly, too loosely, and is now, as\nyou say, trying to cut back on those jurisdictional\nlimits. And a rule like this can only be jurisdictional\nif it's based on a statute, and I believe all the\nparties agree this rule is not based on a statute.\nSo then that gets us finally to the question\nof, if 3742 does not provide the answer and it is a rule\nof practice, is it a mandatory rule of practice, an\ninflexible rule of practice? Or one where the Court can\nuse discretion as to whether or not to apply it when\nit's invoked?\nAnd the -- there can be no question that\nthere are discretionary rules of practice. Indeed, in\nBowles, the one issue on which all nine Justices agreed\nis just that: Justice Souter, writing for the dissent,\nwould have found that that rule or practice was\ndiscretionary. Justice Thomas, writing for --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if it's\ndiscretionary, how would you -- I assume it's reviewable\nfor abuse of discretion.\nMR. JORGENSEN: Indeed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How would you know\nwhether it's an abuse of discretion or not? I mean, the\nissue is going to be the same in every case. There was\nno cross-appeal. If there had been, we would have\nincreased the sentence, and one court of appeals says,\nwell, we're not going to do it; and the other court of\nappeals says, yes, we're going to do it.\nWhich one is reversed for abuse of\ndiscretion?\nMR. JORGENSEN: I believe the one that\nrefused to correct such a plain error, obviously.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought you might\nsay that. But I mean --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. JORGENSEN: But your question was, what\nis the standard? If I may, I believe that's the\nquestion. And the Court has, I think, provided the --\nseveral formulations of what the standard is. In\nLangnes, the Court said good cause was the standard. In\nReynolds, which contrary to what Petitioner said was a\ncase where this Court afforded relief on a sentence to a\ncriminal Petitioner who had not brought that issue to\nthis --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, could do you this?\nBecause this is quite helpful to me. Reading, I started\nout where Justice Scalia was at the beginning of this\nargument. I thought the district court normally has it\nopen, to the judge, to resentence. Resentence is\nresentence. You can't be vindictive, but that's the\nlimit. That's how it works normally, I thought.\nAnd given -- if that's so, then you look at\nthe three sections we just saw, try to read them\ntogether, and say they certainly are written with the\nnotion that the noticing of a plain error on the other\nside is going to be few and far between if ever.\nSo the normal way to handle it is just what\nwe said: The judge decides on the record and the appeal\n-- I decide this for the defendant here. But I've\nnoticed something, says the writing judge. And of\ncourse it's open on resentencing to go into that.\nMR. JORGENSEN: I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So if you were going to do\nsomething other than that, in the court of appeals,\nyou'd have to have a reason, and it would have to be a\nfairly good reason. So you don't close off the escape\nhatch because we can't all foresee the future perfectly,\nbut you say it's going to be few and far between.\nNow does that work?\nMR. JORGENSEN: I believe it does work,\nJustice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right.\nMR. JORGENSEN: And I believe it --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This argument is not an\nargument under the statute? This is an argument giving\nyour interpretation of what the background rule is?\nMR. JORGENSEN: I believe that's right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you would limit the\nbackground rule to plain error?\nMR. JORGENSEN: Yes -- yes, Your Honor, I\nwould. And that does not really contradict what the\nEighth Circuit did here. Rule 52(b) is really another\nformulation of the very same thing that the court said\nin Langnes; that's good cause. In Neztsosie, it -- the\nCourt phrased it \"countervailing considerations\" which\noutweigh the institutional interests in fair notice and\nrepose. And, of course, rule 52(b) talks about\n\"fairness, integrity, and public reputation of judicial\nproceedings.\" They're all different formulations of the\nsame --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if it's such a\n--\nMR. JORGENSEN: -- of the same --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If it's such a plain\nerror, it's fair to to ask why the Government didn't\ncross-appeal. If you --\nMR. JORGENSEN: There is nothing in the\nrecord here, Justice, on that. The Government has been\nvery careful not to say or urge you on reply -- to ask.\nI believe it was a blunder, and so to adopt --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: A blunder?\nMR. JORGENSEN: A blunder. So, to adopt the\nGovernment's rule is to adopt a new -- a new\nexclusionary rule that the defendant goes free when the\nconstable blunders.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if this were to be a\nmore frequent occurrence, i.e., plain errors, then we\nwere to rule for you and court of appeals generally\nwould do this, then a defendant might think twice\nabout appealing in a complex case.\nMR. JORGENSEN: That's true, Justice.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Because there's nothing\nthat could happen -- once the district court rules and\nthe seven days for error goes by, there's nothing that\nanybody can do to raise it.\nMR. JORGENSEN: Well, the first part of your\nquestion was true, Justice Kennedy, but respectfully the\nsecond part was not.\nIn the -- the way it currently works, under\nthe rules, a defendant must file his notice of appeal\nbefore the Government files it. And so, as it currently\nstands, he makes his choice before he ever knows. There\nis no extra burden that would be placed on him.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, he doesn't have to\npursue it if the Government appeals.\nMR. JORGENSEN: That's exactly right. And\nthe Government makes that point that at some point, if\nthe Government raises its appeal, he could strike a deal\nwith them. Now, it's not correct to assume that he\ncould then unilaterally walk away because there is a\nnotice of appeal, the Government's notice of appeal. So\nhe has to strike a deal with the Government at that\npoint. That's no different than in this case. At oral\nargument, the Eighth Circuit asked both parties about\nthis error. He could have struck a deal then.\nIf this case turns on notice, there isn't a\nnotice problem here. It's all over the record. It's\nraised at sentencing. It's raised on appeal. It's\ndiscussed in the briefs. It's discussed at oral\nargument. This error was known to all.\nNow --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I didn't understand that\na party couldn't voluntarily withdraw a notice of\nappeal.\nI mean, suppose the only way that the court\nof appeals can get into this is because the defendant\nhas pursued an appeal.\nSuppose this comes up and the defendant\nsays, oh, my goodness, I stand to get 15 more years in\nprison; I'm withdrawing my notice of appeal. There's\nnothing before the court of appeals then. Nothing.\nMR. JORGENSEN: That's a critical\ndifference, Justice Ginsburg. You're exactly right that\nthe court of appeals must have, under 3742, a notice of\nappeal, or it has no jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. JORGENSEN: But under the hypothetical\nwe were discussing, I perhaps assumed incorrectly. I\nthought we were talking about the defendant files his\nnotice of appeal before the Government ever files; then\nsubsequently the Government files as well. Now, if the\ndefendant withdraws, there's still a notice of appeal\nbefore the court.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Right.\nMR. JORGENSEN: But if the government had\nnever filed, you're exactly right that the defendant\ncould take his back. But the problem is it doesn't\nanswer Justice Kennedy's question. His question was:\nIsn't a defendant entitled to know that he's -- that the\nGovernment might appeal, that he might be at risk, that\nthere might be a problem here? And my point is he\ndoesn't know under the current system anyway. He has to\nmake his choice before the Government ever makes its\nchoice. Now --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Jorgensen, may I take\nyou back to something you mentioned earlier in the\nargument? And I thought I followed it at the time, and\nI may not have understood you.\nAs I recall, you were explaining the\ndifference between (f)(1) and (f)(2)(A) and (B) by\nsaying that in (f)(1), which was -- which does not\nembody any condition on who has appealed --\nMR. JORGENSEN: Right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- the concern is that, if\nthere is an error, it's an error which will in effect\ninfect all cases. It's a circuit error, and it's\npotentially there for any case that comes along for\nsentencing; whereas, in (f)(2), if there's an error, the\nlimited damage is simply to the case itself, to the\nparticular defendant.\nWhere I don't follow that reasoning is in\nthe fact that F 1 refers not only to an incorrect -- to\na violation of law, but incorrect application of\nsentencing guidelines, which would seem to include a --\nthe particulars of a given case. So am I either\nmisunderstanding your argument or maybe misunderstanding\nsubsection 1.\nMR. JORGENSEN: Well, Justice Souter, the\nlines between A 1, 2, 3, and 4 are not as bright as they\nmight be. But when Congress enacted it, in response to\nJustice Scalia's question of why might Congress have\ndone this when it wrote it, which was before Booker,\nwhich introduced some additional theory as to which of\nthose four does an appeal fit within, one was: Is it\nimposed in violation of law?\nAnd, using that clear language, you can\nimagine the Congress would be concerned that violations\nof law not go unremedied.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If that's all it said, I\nwould certainly understand your distinction.\nMR. JORGENSEN: And then 2 is an incorrect\napplication of the sentencing guidelines, which, again,\nat the time of the Sentencing Reform Act were intended\nto be, I believe, mandatory.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So that it was a violation\nof law?\nMR. JORGENSEN: Indeed. There isn't that\nmuch of a difference between 1 and 2. But then when you\nget to 3 and 4, then you get into the language that\naddresses the particulars of this case: Was this\ndefendant's -- was the application to this defendant too\nhigh based on an unreasonable fact or to an unreasonable\ndegree, I believe is the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I guess the problem I still\nhave is some incorrect applications of the sentencing\nguidelines pre-Booker were, in fact, violations of law.\nBut not all of them were, any more than all of them are\nnow. But forget the situation now. Not all of them\nwere.\nAnd I don't see how you can draw the sort of\nnonporous distinction that you are drawing. I mean it\nis a good try; but even pre-Booker there are some\nincorrect applications that could have been corrected on\nan abuse standard that were not properly described as\nviolations of law per se.\nMR. JORGENSEN: I think that's right,\nJustice Souter. And I could only say that what we're\ndoing here is we are hypothesizing why would Congress\nhave said what they said; and it is a dangerous game to\nplay. But that is my best hypothesis. But it does say\nwhat it says.\nNow, if I can return -- and I hope this is\nhelpful -- to the questions that began the entire\nargument, which is the sentencing -- the sentence\npackaging rule or the sentencing package rule which\nJustice Breyer addressed, I believe the right answer to\nyour question, Justice Stevens, is that under the way\nthe sentencing package rule works, which is applied, I\nbelieve, by all circuits, is that if any part of a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What do we mean by the\n\"sentencing packaging rule\"?\nMR. JORGENSEN: That's a very good question,\nJustice Scalia. Under section 3553(a) after the\nSentencing Reform Act was imposed, judges were --\ndistrict judges were empowered and given the obligation\nto build a sentence that took into consideration a\nnumber of competeding factors such that you might, if\nyou were a judge, a district judge, reduce a sentence\nunder one count of an indictment if you were going to\ngive more under another; and you put together a\nsentencing package; and then that's the sentence that\nthe defendant receives.\nAnd then when that goes up on appeal, if any\npart of that package is undone, the whole package is\nundone. This is the rule that the circuits follow.\nTo your question, Justice Ginsburg, I don't\nbelieve they have a precedent of this Court to fall --\nto base that on. But it is the rule that is nearly\nuniformly followed. So then when the case goes back to\nthe district court, the district court is free to\nconstruct a new sentence.\nSo, as here, if the defendant had prevailed\nin any way, then back on remand the district judge could\nhave imposed the same sentence.\nNow, a limit on that, Justice Scalia, is the\nvindictiveness cases. That if there is any evidence\nthat the increased sentence, making the sentence the\nsame or more is as a -- you know, it's a pay back --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Getting what he deserves,\nright?\nMR. JORGENSEN: Exactly. And that can't be\ndone. But, otherwise, with that narrow exception, the\nsentence can be exactly the same, even though the\ndefendant prevailed on appeal.\nNow, that played out exactly in this case.\nIn this case, when it went back to the district court,\nthe defendant said to the district court: Don't give me\nmore. You can fit the new fifteen years within what I\nalready have. Give me what I already have.\nAnd the District Judge said: No. I'm going\nto give you more.\nNow, the answer clearly, I think, cannot\nturn on the fact that the Seventh -- excuse me -- the\nEighth Circuit knew the answer. We had some questions\nabout what if the Eighth Circuit said: Well, I see an\nerror here, but I don't know how it affects your\nsentence, so I am sending you back. Would that be okay?\nBut it can't turn on the -- that the Seventh\nCircuit knew in this instance that he would get an\nincreased sentence as versus it would be okay to send it\nback without saying what the effect would be for the\ndistrict judge to impose.\nAnd, Justice Kennedy, your question was:\nWhat happens if there's a new trial? As my children\nwould say, it is a complete do-over. When the trial\nstarts all over again, new facts are found or not found,\nand the sentence is completely constructed all over\nagain based on the facts as found by the jury in the\nsecond trial.\nIf I can end, Justices, I would end by\nsaying that I believe section 3742 does provide the\nanswer here. Congress provided a clean break with the\npast. The idea that Congress was aware of a clear rule\nthat they would have followed, I think, is contradicted\nby Reynolds, where this Court did the opposite; Langnes,\nwhere this Court said that the cross-appeal rule was a\nrule of practice, not a jurisdictional limit; and the\nconfusion in the courts of appeals.\nI believe the answer to your question,\njustice Scalia, on whether it is well-established is\nthat in the civil context I believe the D.C. Third,\nFourth, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits say that this is a\nrule of practice while the Senate has debated it back\nand forth.\nAnd in Neztsosie the Court noted this\nconfusion and noted, indeed, that some of the circuits\nare internally inconsistent as to what the rule is.\nIt is slightly different in the criminal\ncontext. I believe the Eighth and the Tenth Circuits\nhave not followed -- have not followed the rule, while\nthe Second, Third, Fourth and Seventh have; and the\nFifth is internally inconsistent. I may -- I may have\nsome error, honestly, in that recitation. I did it from\nmemory when you asked.\nBut my point, I think, comes through no\nmatter what, which is: How could Congress have assumed\nthis is a clear rule and, when we write these words, the\ncourts will know that's what we mean, when there's all\nthis confusion amongst the courts?\nThank you, Your Honors.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Howe, you have two minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF AMY HOWE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. HOWE: Mr. Chief Justice, I have two\npoints. The first is that the amicus argues that\nsubsection (e) of section 3742 provides the answer in\nthis case: That upon a review of the record the Court\nof Appeals shall determine. And so his argument is that\nthis authorizes and, in fact, requires the court of\nappeals to determine whether any of the errors that are\noutlined in subsection (e) have occurred. But (e) can't\npossibly be this sort empowering, roving, free-standing\nauthority that the amicus believes it is.\nBecause if you look at the language of\nsubsection (e), all it provides -- and this Court has\nrecognized that it merely provides the scope of review\n-- that, upon review of the record, the court of appeals\nshall determine. It doesn't say anything about whether\na notice of appeal has been filed, how the record got\nthere. And to figure out those things you have to look\nat the structure of the statute.\nAnd when you look at the structure of the\nstatute, it is clear that subsections (a) and (b) are\nthe provisions that provide for appellate jurisdiction\nin sentencing cases.\nAmicus also tries to argue that, you know --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: (E) also contradicts (f) --\nMR. HOWE: (F)(2)and then --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- (2)(A) and (B) because\nin some of those cases it doesn't determine that if the\nappeal has been brought by the wrong party.\nMS. HOWE: That's absolutely right. That\nmerely provides the remedy, Justice Scalia.\nAnd the amicus tries also to argue that this\nis not some sort of free-standing, roving appellate\nauthority. That, you know, for example, if the case is\nbrought under (A)(1), a violation of law, the court of\nappeals only needs to determine whether it is a\nviolation of law. But he also argued that the court of\nappeals is not obligated to scour the record for errors.\nIt is only to notice plain error.\nBut if one should start placing these\nlimits, these limits come from subsections (a) and (b)\nand the background of traditional appellate practice.\nAnd once you start placing these limits which do not\nappear in the text on subsection (e), the entire\nconstruction falls apart.\nThe second point I would make is that the\namicus argues that, somehow, section 3742 represents as\na break from the past; that Congress did not have in\nmind the background of this well- established appellate\nprocedure. But in section 3742 Congress made clear --\nmay I finish -- it was only providing for limited\nappellate review.\nAnd if you are going to treat sentencing\ncases differently in light of this court's historic\npractice of construing the availability of government\nappeals narrow rate, you need to treat -- you need to be\neven more reluctant to deviate --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Miss\nHowe.\nMr. Jorgensen, you have briefed and argued\nthis case as an amicus curiae in support of the judgment\nbelow on appointment by the Court. We thank you for\nundertaking and discharging that assignment.\n"
