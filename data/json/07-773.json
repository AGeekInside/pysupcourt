ORTIZ: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThis case poses two substantive issues:\nFirst, whether section 4 of the Federal Arbitration Act\nimpliedly repeals section 1331's \"well-pleaded\ncomplaint\" requirement? Only if it does can a district\ncourt look through a petition to compel arbitration that\nitself contains no Federal question to ground Federal\nsubject matter jurisdiction on a Federal question\nlurking somewhere in the dispute sought to be\narbitrated.\nAnd, second, if section 4 does repeal this\npart of section 1331, can a completely pre-empted\nState-law counterclaim in a pending State-court lawsuit\nfurnish look-through jurisdiction?\nYour Honors, at bottom this is ae dispute\nbetween two radically different conceptions of Federal\nquestion jurisdiction. One view, Respondents', is so\nbroad as to allow parties to compel arbitration in\nFederal court of nearly any dispute concerning credit\ncard debt; and one, Petitioner's, narrowly confined\nsubject matter jurisdiction to those disputes where the\narbitration agreement itself arguably arises under\nFederal law.\nBut, Your Honors, the ordinary, the original\nmeaning of section 4, the structure of the overall\nFederal Arbitration Act, and the purposes of the Federal\nArbitration Act all militate strongly in favor of the\nPetitioner's view of subject matter jurisdiction here.\nFirst, the language. The words \"save for such\nagreement,\" Your Honors, as the words \"save for\"\nthemselves suggest, necessarily imply that the agreement\nexerts some negative effect on otherwise existing\njurisdiction.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That simply means\nthat you can't bring an action in Federal court because\nthe agreement says you can't. The agreement says you've\ngot to arbitrate. So if you throw the agreement out\nsave for such agreement, the question is whether or not\nyou could then bring the action in Federal court.\nMR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, the -- those words\n\"save for such agreement\" were originally intended to\nrefer to the hoary doctrine of ouster, which barred the\nFederal courts from subject matter jurisdiction in such\nsuits. The words \"but for\" suggest that the agreement\nitself somehow impairs jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Ortiz, why isn't\nsection 2 of the Arbitration Act sufficient to take care\nof the ouster doctrine, whatever may have been left of\nit?\nMR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, section 2 says that\nan arbitration agreement shall be valid, irrevocable,\nand enforceable. At the time when section 2 was\nenacted, the Federal courts were still split between law\nand equity. Section 2 by itself could well have made\nsuch arbitration agreements enforceable, but only in\nlaw. Section 4, \"save for such agreement,\" makes clear\nthat there is no --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm not sure that I\nfollow that, because it seems to me -- where did this\ndoctrine of ouster come from? It came from the court.\nThe courts said, no, we won't enforce arbitration\nagreements if it would oust us of jurisdiction. Why\nwould a court reading section 2 not say, well, that rule\nnever made any sense in the first place, so we're not\ngoing to follow it? It's not any rule that Congress has\nimposed on the courts.\nMR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, section 2 by itself\nwould not have made clear that in -- such agreements\nwere enforceable in equity. As Justice Story wrote in\nTobey v. County of Bristol, bills in equity were thought\nin the Federal courts to be ill-founded in point of\njurisdiction to support a motion to compel arbitration.\nAnd so although under section 2 such an agreement might\nbe enforceable in law -- damages might be available,\npenalty clauses might be enforced in law, a party might\nalso be able to recover the expenses incurred in an\narbitration that was revoked before the arbitration came\nto its conclusion -- that would not be clear that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That may have been the\nhistoric model. This was never a notion that Congress\nenforced on the courts. They imposed it on themselves.\nSo my question remains why shouldn't the\nCourt then say this agreement has been declared\nenforceable, the ouster doctrine didn't have much to\nrecommend it in the beginning, but certainly not any\nmore; we can change it?\nMR. ORTIZ: No, Your Honor. It is true that\nCongress in the Federal Arbitration Act abrogated the\nouster doctrine. The only question is whether section 2\nwould do so by itself or whether section 4 was necessary\nbecause of the division between law and equity at the\ntime.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm just not getting the --\nI have never understood this argument and I still don't\nunderstand it now. What is it in the text of section 2\nthat would seem to leave it inadequate to touch equity\nas well as law?\nMR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, section 2 says that\narbitration agreements shall be valid, irrevocable and\nenforceable, but it does not say how they could be\nenforced.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Exactly. And why,\ntherefore, would anyone -- why would anyone be drawing\ndistinctions as to how? It would be enforceable in any\nway that an agreement might appropriately be enforced in\nthe courts of the United States at the time -- or any\ncourts, for that matter, at the time the act was passed.\nMR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, if Congress wanted\nto be very clear that ouster in all of its forms was no\nlonger any kind of issue in enforcing arbitration\nagreements, it took the extra step in section 4.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It -- it made a categorical\nstatement in section 2. Why did it need to be any\nclearer than that?\nMR. ORTIZ: Well, because, Your Honor, it\nwould be the case that arbitration agreements could be\nenforceable, but just not enforceable in the way that\nmight be most helpful.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it could be, but why\nin the world would anyone draw that inference?\nMR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, because there were\nseparate bars at law and equity at the time -- at the\ntime of ouster. Under law, there was some room in some\njurisdictions for there to be enforcement, not across\nthe board. In equity there was an even higher standard\nat the time against jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I have the same problem\nthat Justice Souter does, especially since section 2\nrefers to equity. It says they will be irrevocable and\nenforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or\nin equity for the revocation of any contract.\nObviously this -- this section was meant to\napply to equitable actions. You wouldn't dismiss them\nin law for a -- a ground that only existed in equity?\nMR. ORTIZ: But that particular section,\nJustice Scalia, is meant to refer to ordinary State\ncontract doctrines in law and equity, which would make\nthe overall contract unenforceable. The \"save for\"\nlanguage is specifically directed at ouster, which is a\njurisdictional doctrine rather than one of substantive\ncontract law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know. When it says\nthey are enforceable and makes an exception only for\ngrounds that enable revocation in law or in equity, I\nwould -- I would think that the general command was\nmeant to apply to both law and equity.\nMR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, the Respondents'\nview also doesn't take into account the other provisions\nof the Federal Arbitration Act itself. Under their\nview, the \"save for\" language is literally read out of\nsection 4 of the agreement, since the rest of section 4\nwould accomplish exactly what they think the\nlook-through doctrine that they are arguing for without\nthose four critical words.\nAlso, sections 203 and sections 205 show\nthat when Congress wanted to expand subject matter\njurisdiction, it knew how to do so clearly and\nunequivocally. And in fact, when Congress adopted\nSection 205 in 1970 --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I hate to interrupt you\nhere, but would you explain why the words \"save for such\nagreement\" cut back on the jurisdiction? I didn't quite\nunderstand your point.\nMR. ORTIZ: Justice Stevens, the point is\nthat \"save for such agreement\" instructs a court to jump\nover the historical ouster doctrine.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Doesn't it just instruct\nthe court to decide whether, if there were no such\nagreements, would there be Federal jurisdiction in the\nunderlying dispute?\nMR. ORTIZ: Yes. Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So in this case there\nwould be.\nMR. ORTIZ: No, Your Honor, because the\nunderlying dispute between the parties in this case is\na -- concerns the arbitration agreement, not the\nunderlying bank debt.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, it's not the\nunderlying bank debt, but it is an underlying dispute\nover which this Federal -- if you had brought your class\naction as an original case, there would have been\nFederal jurisdiction.\nMR. ORTIZ: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So then why doesn't the\nlanguage read on this case?\nMR. ORTIZ: Well, Your Honor, the language\nin -- the language -- the particular language of section\n4 is meant to say, save for such agreement but for the\ndoctrine of ouster, setting aside the ouster doctrine\nwhether there would be --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The text says nothing\nabout the ouster doctrine.\nMR. ORTIZ: No. But read in its historical\ncontext, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Rather than literally.\nMR. ORTIZ: Well, literally at the time it\nwould have been understood to refer -- to refer to that,\nbecause ouster was the whole problem against which FAA\nitself was first enacted. FAA --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is a tough --\nit's a tough sell. When you say \"save for such\nagreement,\" which I agree with Justice Stevens seems to\nme you've put the agreement aside and then you say right\naway then you look at the agreement to see if there is\nFederal jurisdiction and only the agreement, not through\nthat. So you're throwing it out and then you bring it\nright back in. It seems --\nMR. ORTIZ: Not quite, Your Honor. What --\nthe rest of that sentence in section 4 instructs the\ncourt to look at a suit concerning the subject matter in\ncontroversy, which would be a suit seeking specific\nperformance of the arbitration.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of the arbitration\nagreement?\nMR. ORTIZ: Yes, sir. So you are -- what\nthe court is instructed to do under the \"save for such\nagreement\" clause is to ignore the historical problem of\nouster and then to see whether in a suit brought to\nspecifically enforce the arbitration agreement, there\nwould be Federal subject matter jurisdiction.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. And I guess\nit's -- I mean, you say if it said save for the historic\ndoctrine of ouster, then it would be easy to say, and\nthen you look at the arbitration agreement. But it says\n\"save for such agreement\" and then you look at the\nagreement.\nMR. ORTIZ: Well, you're not quite looking\nat the agreement. And this makes clear, I believe, that\nouster was the problem being referred to in those four\nwords in section 4. It says a suit arising out of a\ncontroversy. It's instructing the Federal courts to\ndetermine Federal subject matter jurisdiction for a\nsection 4 proceeding, which was completely novel at the\ntime.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You just -- you just used\nthe words \"arising out of the controversy.\" \"The\ncontroversy\" is used in several sections of the\nArbitration Act, and \"the controversy\" in other contexts\nmeans the underlying dispute between the parties. \"The\ncontroversy\" is not over the enforcement of the\narbitration agreement.\nMR. ORTIZ: With all respect, Justice\nGinsburg, it's a little bit more complicated than that.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act uses the word \"controversy\"\nfour times, twice in section 2, once in section 4 and\nonce in section 5.\nIn section 2, the word \"controversy\" is\nembedded in a larger phrase: \"Controversy arising out\nof such contractor transaction.\" It is that context for\nthe word \"controversy\" that makes clear that in section\n2, both instances in section 2, it is referring to the\ndispute which is sought to be arbitrated.\nIn section 5, by contrast, the simple word\nwhich appears the middle of 4A of the Petitioner's\nbrief, either -- section 5, which deals with the\nappointment of arbitrators or umpires, it says \"either\nparty to the controversy\", it's clear in the section 5\ncontext that the word \"controversy\" by itself refers to\nthe controversy over arbitration, not to the underlying\ndispute.\nJUSTICE ALITO: In Moses H. Cone, didn't the\ncourt say that the controversy was the underlying\ndispute?\nMR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, that -- this Court,\nin that footnote 32 of Moses H. Cone, mentioned language\nthat refers to the underlying dispute. In the context\nof both the sentence, the footnote itself, and the\noverall case, it is clear that the Court could not have\nmeant that.\nThat phrase is followed immediately by a\nsemicolon and then the word \"hence.\" And after the word\n\"hence\" in that same sentence in the same footnote, this\nCourt says, \"Hence an independent basis for jurisdiction\nneeds to exist,\" which in context makes it clear that\nit's not referring to look through.\nAlso that sentence cites a Fifth Circuit\ncase, Commercial Metals Company, and the other -- points\nto the other cases in it. They basically show that an\nindependent -- stand for the proposition that an\nindependent basis of jurisdiction exists, not that there\nis look through. And, in fact, one of them dealing with\nFederal-question jurisdiction says that the Federal\nissue has to appear on the face of the complaint.\nThe rest of footnote 32, Your Honor, is all\ndirected towards -- towards the jurisdictional inertness\nof the FAA overall. And the case of Moses H. Cone,\nitself, if look through had been rigorously adopted\nthere, it would have defeated subject-matter\njurisdiction because there would not have been complete\ndiversity among the parties.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you do think --\nyou do think we should look through to determine\ndiversity and the amount in question? In other words,\nnot in the Federal-question context, but if it's\ndiversity, you say we do look through the arbitration\nagreement.\nMR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, that seems a\nsomewhat different sense of look through; but, to the\nextent that ordinary, background 1331 or 1332 principles\nauthorize such look through, that is appropriate in\narbitration cases as much as it is appropriate outside\nof arbitration cases.\nIt is Petitioner's contention that section 4\nhas no independent look-through force. To the extent\nthat look through is appropriate, it is because it is\nappropriate under section 1332, itself. If under\nRespondents' view section 4 operates independently to\nauthorize look through, then it would presumably\noverride 1332's normal principle that you do not look\nthrough in determining complete diversity. And it would\nhave the overall effect of paradoxically reducing the\nnumber of petitions to compel on the diversity side that\ncould be brought in Federal court.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Say that again. I didn't\nfollow that.\nMR. ORTIZ: The -- the point is a simple\none, but it's sometimes hard to express. If you -- if\nthis Court says that section 4 operates independently to\nauthorize look through in section 1331 and section 1332,\nthe courts, district courts, will be in the position of\nlooking through section 1332 petitions to determine\nwhether the parties are completely diverse.\nIt will not be basing the complete diversity\ndetermination on the parties before it in the\narbitration -- in the petition to compel, itself, but it\nwill be looking through to the underlying dispute.\nNow, in Moses H. Cone, if the Court had done\nthat, it would have picked up the architect who was\ndropped from the actual -- between the actual underlying\nlawsuit and the petition to compel arbitration, and\ncompleteness of diversity would have been defeated\nthere.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is that point argued in\nMoses -- Moses Cone? Was that point argued in that\ncase?\nMR. ORTIZ: I do -- I do not know, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why wouldn't 1332\nrequire complete diversity and require the court to\nassure itself of that anyway?\nMR. ORTIZ: No, Your Honor. The question --\n1332 does not authorize look through for purposes of\ndetermining completeness of diversity, so if section 4\nindependently authorizes --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said it did\nhave a look through, an automatic look through, itself.\nMR. ORTIZ: Not under the completeness of\ndiversity, Your Honor. To the extent it has anything\nequivalent to look through, it's on the amount-in-\ncontroversy side of Section 1332.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I see. I see. You are --\nyou are -- you are limiting it to the amount.\nMR. ORTIZ: Yes. So, under Respondents'\nview, there would be -- section 4 would authorize a look\nthrough one part of section 1332 and not with respect to\nanother part of section 1332 under --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I am not -- I mean just --\nI have to be sure I follow. Why couldn't it require the\nsame look through in a diversity case as it does in a\nFederal-question case?\nMR. ORTIZ: Because, Your Honor, if this\nCourt authorizes look through in Federal-question cases\nthrough the arbitration agreement, itself, to the\nunderlying dispute, then if that look -- and that look\nthrough comes -- authorization comes from Section 4 --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right.\nMR. ORTIZ: -- then in 1332 cases, this\nCourt would be looking through not only for\namount-in-controversy purposes --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Complete diversity.\nMR. ORTIZ: -- but also for complete\ndiversity.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What's wrong with that?\nMR. ORTIZ: Well, that would have the\neffect, Your Honor, of not allowing the petitioner to\ndefine the contours of the lawsuit and would actually\nreduce the number of section 1332 petitions that could\nbe brought in Federal court.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Maybe it would. So what?\nMR. ORTIZ: Well, Your Honor, if that is --\nthat is an implication that is -- is lurking in\nRespondents' position, and it is also -- in a case like\nthis it is a little bit worrying as to why ordinary\nsection 1332 principles should not apply.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There is a dispute between\npeople. You look at their underlying dispute, the\nunderlying one, and you say: Is there diversity?\nWhat's the problem?\nMR. ORTIZ: Well, Your Honor, that's not\nactually the way you use Federal -- lower Federal court\nnow.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why -- why wouldn't you do\njust what I said, just what we started with? You take\nout the arbitration agreement, and then you look to see\nwhat this dispute is about. And if it's about something\nthat happens to involve all people from one side in one\nState and from another State on the other side, there is\njurisdiction. Why is that a problem? I don't\nunderstand.\nMR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, it -- it removes the\nPetitioner's ability or the plaintiff's ability or the\n-- similar to the plaintiff's ability in an ordinary\nlawsuit to define --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why?\nMR. ORTIZ: -- the parties.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why?\nMR. ORTIZ: Well, because, Your Honor,\nsomeone could not bring a section 4 petition in Federal\ncourt against maybe one party seeking to force that\nparty into arbitration if there are other parties\ninvolved in the underlying dispute where there is no\ndiversity.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. So you define\n\"look through\" as -- under our hypothetical here as\nlooking through to all people who might potentially be\nparties under this arbitration agreement.\nMR. ORTIZ: Well, that would be the\nimplication of taking the kind of look-through theory\nthat Respondents are arguing for in this case and\napplying it evenhandedly.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I will think about that.\nI'm -- I'm -- I wasn't -- it wasn't clear to me that\nthat was so.\nMR. ORTIZ: But, Your Honor, there are also\nseveral jurisdictional gaps in the act that are created\nunder Respondents' view. The critical --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I hold up just a\nsecond to make sure I understand it. You are saying\nthat, let's say, Person A has an arbitration agreement\nthat implicates Persons B and C. C is diverse, but B is\nnot. They could decide to compel arbitration with\nrespect to B and leave C out of it. But if you follow\nthe look-through doctrine, you would say, well, the\ndispute is between A and B and C; and so you would be\ndepriving A of their right to frame their own complaint\nin a way that doesn't create Federal jurisdiction.\nMR. ORTIZ: Exactly, Your Honor, and that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's not quite so,\nbecause the -- the action could proceed with just A and\nC, and then it -- it could come to a complete judgment\nas to them. In the look through for the -- the claims\nthat are involved, the action couldn't possibly proceed\nwithout taking account of the pre-emption claim that the\nFederal -- the Federal claim.\nYou couldn't -- you could decide the case\ncompletely in No. 1, the diversity case, but not in No.\n2. So there -- so there is a difference. It's true,\nyou don't decide it completely as to all parties.\nMR. ORTIZ: When the -- no, Your Honor.\nBut there -- there could under your situation be large\nparts of the underlying dispute that are not covered\nunder -- and still left to be decided. It is, you know,\nnot the case that necessarily everything would be\nsubject to arbitration.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, I suppose\nhow that works depends on what the rules are about how\nyou frame the dispute once you do look through.\nI mean, if there is a pending State suit\nbetween A and B, even though C may -- you could have\nsued C as well, I mean the judge can say, well, I am\nonly going to look through to what the -- the actual\nlitigation is; and if I look at that, that's not a\nFederal case. And -- and -- and so your position\nfollows.\nMR. ORTIZ: This Court could; and,\ninterestingly, that wasn't the situation in Moses H.\nCone, itself. There, there was a preexisting lawsuit,\nand this Court did not look through. The court found\nthat there was no problem with the architect being\nabsent from the petition to compel arbitration, itself.\nWell, Your Honors, there is also, as I\nmentioned, strange jurisdictional gaps that are created\nunder Respondents' view of this case. Section 4 is the\nonly section of the arbitration -- in the Federal\nArbitration Act that has the critical \"save for such\"\nlanguage, which under Respondents' view authorizes\nlook-through jurisdiction, in particular, Sections 7, 9,\n10, and 11, which allow a court, a Federal court, to\ncompel the attendance of witnesses at ab arbitration.\nThat is Section 7; and then 9, 10, and 11, which\nrespectively allow a Federal court to confirm, vacate,\nor modify an arbitration once it has happened.\nNone of those sections contain language\nwhich under Respondents' view or the Fourth Circuit's\nview are necessary for there to be look through.\nIn all those cases -- situations, Your\nHonor, the Federal courts would be in the position of\nbeing able to compel arbitration under section 4 but not\nbeing able to compel the attendance of witnesses at the\narbitration or to subsequently confirm, vacate, or\nmodify an award coming from an arbitration that they,\nthemselves, compelled.\nComing from an arbitration that they\nthemselves compelled. The closest Respondent comes to\nsort of explaining this or trying to jump or leap over\nthis gap, are two amici, two law professors, who argue\nthat this Court should find jurisdiction, subject matter\njurisdiction under sections 7, 9, 10 and 11 as an\nemanation from sections 3 and 4, only one of which\nactually has the necessary \"save for\" language.\nAlso, Your Honors, this look-through\napproach to Federal subject matter jurisdiction violates\nthe core purposes of the Federal Arbitration Act. The\nFederal Arbitration Act was meant to get things to\narbitration quickly and to have arbitrators, not judges,\ndecide them. These -- sometimes often complex\njurisdictional inquiries undermine both those aims.\nHere this case has been pending in Federal\ncourt just at the jurisdictional stage for many years\nnow. In the Strong case which is now en banc before the\nFifth Circuit -- I'm sorry, the Eleventh Circuit --\nJustice -- Judge -- excuse me, Judge Marcus wrote a\n32-page opinion.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, and what really\nleapt off the page at me in that opinion, he gets to the\nend, I think he basically presents your position and\nthen he says: Thus, on my reading the relevant portion\nof section 4 could be rewritten this way.\nWell, I mean that to me is a confession of\nerror if you have to rewrite the statute to get to your\nposition.\nMR. ORTIZ: Well, Your Honor, he didn't say\nit had to be rewritten. He said if you wanted to make\nit even clearer what was originally intended under\nsection 4 that is how you would do it. That's a far cry\nfrom saying that you need to do violence to the statute.\nHere --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, his rewriting\ndoesn't look very much like section 4 to me.\nMR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, if his rewriting,\ngiven the disappearance of the ouster doctrine -- he's\ntrying to make it clear to present context what was\noriginally understood at the time the Congress\noriginally enacted the FAA. There is no memory,\nhistorical memory or otherwise, of the ouster doctrine,\nno realization how it actually played out; and against\nthat absence of knowledge, Judge Marcus is trying to\neducate his readers and the lower courts as to how\nthings need to be done.\nBut certainly the language as originally\nunderstood would have -- that save-for language would\nhave been all about, which it is clear from the time was\nthought by Congress to be the major obstacle to\narbitration.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What about the fact that\nthat was not included in the New Jersey statute, nor was\nit included in -- was it included in the Uniform\nArbitration Act?\nMR. ORTIZ: No, Your Honor. Now --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What's the explanation for\nthat?\nMR. ORTIZ: The explanation, Your Honor, is\nthat in New York law and equity have been merged.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I know. And you're saying\nNew Jersey; it was, you know, a very complicated\nargument about the status of it. What about the Uniform\nArbitration Act?\nMR. ORTIZ: By the later times it appeared\nthat it was closer, coming -- the law and equity across\nmany jurisdictions was coming closer, but at the time in\nthe Federal court system at least, if only because of\nJustice Story's hostility towards jurisdiction, finding\njurisdiction in the Tobey case to build equity seeking\nspecific performance kinds of things, that language is\nnecessarily clear.\nYour Honors, if there are no further\nquestions I would like to reserve my time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. ORTIZ: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Phillips.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nIt seems to me that if the argument that\njust ended doesn't prove anything, it suggests that\nperhaps the Court ought to follow the simple expedient\nof read the statute as it's written, apply it as written\nand come to what strikes me, at least, as a reasonably\neasy resolution of this particular case.\nThe statute says that a party aggrieved by\nthe alleged failure to arbitrate -- and we have that\nprecisely in this case because the other side has filed\na lawsuit against our indemnitee arising out of an\nunderlying dispute -- may petition any United States\ndistrict court which, save for such an agreement -- it's\npretty clear that everybody agrees that in this context\nyou just simply put the agreement aside -- and then you\nsay would have jurisdiction under Title 28 in a civil\naction of the subject matter of the suit arising out of\nthe controversy between the parties.\nIt seems to me reasonably clear to interpret\nthat language as saying you look to the underlying\ndispute between the parties.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's the question\nthat I have, Mr. Phillips. What is the underlying\ndispute between the parties?\nIt seems to me that your look-through\nargument is look-through only halfway. That is, if you\nlook -- if you consider the controversy, the suit that\nwas brought in the State court, the controversy is here\nwe have a customer who hasn't paid the amount charged.\nSo we have a suit on a debt. Why isn't that the\ncontroversy? You have to make the counterclaim the\ncontroversy, which comes up only defensively. It wasn't\nbrought as a lawsuit.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Ginsburg, the\nlanguage of section 4 actually talks about the subject\nmatter of a suit arising out of, not the existence of a\nsuit; and section 4 doesn't require that a lawsuit have\nbeen filed. So it's not appropriate simply to say to\nyourself look at what litigation actually exists,\nbecause in as many cases as not there is not going to be\nany litigation ongoing. So the court has to make the\nhypothetical: would the court have had jurisdiction\nover the subject matter of this dispute? And the\ndispute in this case, which Professor Ortiz was very\nexplicit about -- he said specifically that if he had\nbrought this as an affirmative lawsuit it would have\narisen under Federal law.\nIt seems to me that's as clear a concession\nthat the nature of this dispute is a question of Federal\nlaw. And therefore --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Who gets to frame --\nwho gets to frame the complaint? Normally if you're a\nparty and you have a dispute that may implicate Federal\nlaw, you have control over the complaint. You don't\nhave to have a -- you don't have to well plead it in a\nway that implicates a Federal question. You can go out\nof your way to do it in a way that does not implicate a\nFederal question; and therefore it would not be, you\ncould not bring it in Federal court.\nJust as in the diversity example, you can\nspecifically avoid suing people who would create\ndiversity. But in your position the judge has to in his\nmind write a complaint and see whether there is\njurisdiction or not; and how does the judge decide\nwhether to sue diverse parties or not to sue diverse\nparties?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think what the judge has to\ndo is to take -- is to give the plaintiff in the section\n4 complaint the benefit of his allegations. And we have\nmade an allegation here that the subject matter of this\ndispute arises under Federal law, and we did that not\njust based on our own assessment of the situation in the\nabstract, but we did that on the basis that she had\nfiled a very specific claim against us asserting that we\nhad violated essentially section 20.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- but she chose to\nassert it only defensively; and it's not a complaint --\nthe counterclaim if it had been brought as an\nindependent action, everybody agrees qualifies for\nFederal jurisdiction. But the litigant who has this\nclaim is asserting it only as a defense to a claim that\nyou admit does not qualify for Federal jurisdiction.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But Justice Ginsburg, I think\nthe difference is that we are not seeking to remove her\noriginal lawsuit. That's not -- if that were the case,\nthen I think the argument you're making is a legitimate\none. All we are seeking to do is to assert our\nindependent section 4 rights and that's not at all\ndependent on the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But in the practical\neffect, what happens? Now you have asserted that you\ncan enforce because of the counterclaim that asserts --\nthat arises under Federal law. But you say it's is not\nthe same as removal because the underlying claim, your\nsuit on the debt owed, remains in Federal -- State\ncourt; but what happens to that claim once you have this\narbitration?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, there are a couple\npossibilities. I mean, first of all, the arbitration\nagreement is quite explicit in saying that if, if you --\nif this starts off as litigation and then a subsequent\nclaim is made by either of the parties, the parties have\nthe right to enforce the arbitration as to that\nparticular claim. So that's specifically what we did in\nthis particular case.\nSo in theory, at least the collection action\nwould remain in State court as a State cause of action,\nalthough it would certainly be available to the\nPetitioner in this case to say, well, no, if you're\ngoing to arbitrate that portion of the case then I'm\ncontent to arbitrate the rest of the case as well. So\nthey could do it that way or we could arbitrate the\nFederal law.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Phillips --\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Clear up one thing for me.\nIs it correct, as Justice Ginsburg suggested, that the\ncounterclaim was purely defensive? Didn't it ask for\nadditional relief? The counterclaim, wasn't it a class\naction?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Oh, right. Yeah -- no --\nexactly. That's absolutely true.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So it was not merely an\ndefense to the action, the State court action.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I meant -- I didn't mean\nto say you couldn't get affirmative relief on a\ncounterclaim. Of course you could. But this --\nMR. PHILLIPS: But I couldn't -- I couldn't\nremove it --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Chose not to --\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think that was the point\nshe was trying to make.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- chose not to litigate\nthe case, chose to -- well, I'm being sued, so I'm going\nto bring up this claim. It wasn't as an original\nmatter.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. I -- I understand\nthat, Justice Ginsburg, but the -- the -- but the point\nI am trying to make here is that the language of section\n4 just talks about the subject matter of the controversy\nbetween the parties. It doesn't specifically talk about\nan existing lawsuit, and frankly it doesn't envision the\nexistence of a specific lawsuit.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The controversy between\nthe parties is the credit card company says, customer,\nyou're in default $10,000; and the customer said, if\nthat's so, then I have certain offsets because they\ncharged me too much interest. How do you --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, in that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- how do you -- it's all\npart of the same controversy, isn't it?\nMR. PHILLIPS: But -- no -- well, I mean you\ncould -- you can certainly view it as part of the same\ncontroversy, but the -- but the bottom line is, the\nquestion is: Would a Federal court have jurisdiction\nover the dispute that arises under Federal law between\nthe Petitioner and the Respondents? And the answer is\nclearly yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is the dispute? You\nsay the dispute is not defined by what -- what has been\nbrought in a complaint.\nMR. PHILLIPS: It's defined by our complaint\nin section 4.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you -- from your\nargument, I would gather that a court would be able to\nimagine a counterclaim. Once it finds out, you know,\nwhat -- what -- what the principal complaint is about,\nthe court could imagine that there would be a\ncounterclaim for interest or for something else.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I'm not sure -- I'm not\neven sure --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's very strange to decide\nFederal jurisdiction on the basis of -- of imagined --\nimagined complaints.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I -- I mean the problem\nwith that -- I mean the difficulty arises, Justice\nScalia, because the language of the statute does say\nthat the court has to determine whether it would have\njurisdiction over the subject matter of the controversy.\nAnd then that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So the problem with his --\nI mean with his interpretation, you don't have to\nimagine anything.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, with his\ninterpretation, you have to imagine everything. In\npoint of fact, you have to imagine that this had\nsomething to do with ouster when it doesn't use the word\n\"ouster.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well --\nMR. PHILLIPS: It has to do with equity and\nlaw when it uses \"equity\" and \"law\" in other contexts.\nAnd --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't have to imagine\ncomplaints. You -- you don't have to invent litigation.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, no. That's true, but\nwhat it -- but -- but the flip side of that is that this\nis a section, a fundamental provision, of the Federal\nArbitration Act that apparently was designed to provide\na basis of Federal jurisdiction for the Gila Indian\nTribe claims. It seems inconceivable to me that\nCongress had that narrow an interpretation of section 4\nin mind when it passed this particular law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's close to inconceivable\nto me that Congress wanted us to -- to construct\nlitigation that is not yet in existence.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But I think all of this\nreally is talking -- I mean this is not significantly\ndifferent --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- answer that the\nlitigation does exist.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, but your position is it\ndoesn't have to exist. Had that litigation not been\nbrought, had the motion to arbitrate been brought before\na lawsuit was filed, that the court would still have to\nconsider what is the dispute between the parties and\nwhat kind of complaints could that dispute have\ngenerated.\nMR. PHILLIPS: And it may well be, Justice\nScalia, that in that context the answer is that the\ncourt will say that the claim is unripe; that we don't\nknow for sure whether or not this is going to congeal\ninto a real dispute between the parties. And if that's\nthe case, obviously, then the court does not have to go\nforward. But you don't have to worry about that in the\ncontext of this particular litigation because that\ndispute has congealed. The parties are at loggerheads\nover the particular issue in this case. And -- I'm\nsorry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There would be nothing\ninappropriate about a State court entertaining that\nexcessive interest claim, but applying Federal law to\nit. I mean the -- 1831(d) says that Federal law governs\nthe interest --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Not state usury law. So\nyou could have this case going on in State court.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the State court would\nbe perfectly competent to apply the Federal law.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. Although, you know,\nthat's to the -- obviously, that sets aside the\narbitration agreement completely.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, why does it set\naside? This is the thing I guess I don't understand\nabout the case, and that is what is really driving your\nside, given the difficulties that I share with the\nJustices on my right and left here. And the -- the\ntacit assumption seems to be that you in fact are going\nto get shortchanged on your arbitration right if you\nhave to bring your arbitration claim in a State court.\nAnd I don't see that.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, first of all, section 4\ndoesn't apply in --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I know section 4 doesn't,\nbut section 2 does.\nMR. PHILLIPS: To be sure, section 2 does,\nbut whether or not --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You can -- based on the\nFederal act, you can in State court claim your right to\nenforce the arbitration agreement.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, but the flip side of\nthat is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why don't you do it in the\nState court instead of going through these gymnastics?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Because we have serious\ndoubts as to whether or not in fact we will have our\nFederal rights protected as zealously as we would in a\nFederal court.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Speaking of gymnastics,\ncan I ask you if you had foreseen this problem, could\nyou have brought a declaratory judgment action to\nestablish that your Federal claim --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- controls this dispute\nand could you have then said that you wanted this\narbitrated?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, Justice Kennedy. I\nbelieve we could have done both of those.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why didn't you do that?\nWhy are we here?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, because we brought the\naction under section 4, which I think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, could you still do\nthat after this case?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Assuming there's no statute\nof limitations issue, and I don't know that there would\nbe, but that would available. But it still seems to me\nthat the bottom-line question is: Are you entitled to\nbring an action under section 4?\nJUSTICE BREYER: So your theory -- I mean\nbasically I think you concede that the other side has a\npoint in sometimes it will be difficult to say what the\ndispute is precisely and, therefore, difficult to know\nif precisely this dispute does or does not -- one that\nyou can get into Federal court on. For example, it\nhasn't even arisen. You know, there is no lawsuit. And\nI guess what would happen, what the judge should say is\nthey should say to you you'd like to have this in\nFederal court, wouldn't you, this dispute? What's it\nabout?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And once he says what's it\nabout, both sides will say, well, basically it started\noff -- it's just about collecting some money from\nin-state parties. So that's not Federal.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So that, you know,\nsomething could happen here. It could happen that they\ncould decide they want to sue in a big class action and\nget huge amounts of money under usury laws of the State\nwhich don't exist, so they have to proceed under an FDIC\nreg, and then it could be Federal. And the judge might\nsay to you: \"What? You're just imagining.\" And that\nwould be up to the judge.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, and the judge would\nhave the discretion to decide --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's a kind of a defense.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But you'd say then it might\nbe the case that it wouldn't be so hard to decide.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. There could be a\nletter that says, look, what you're doing here violates\nFederal law, and if you don't stop it, we are going to\ntake action against you. And then we have to sit there\nand wait.\nJUSTICE BREYER: A real suit. And --\nMR. PHILLIPS: But they are here. They are\nhere.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And in a real suit, there\nis a class action brought not just on behalf of the one\nyou're trying to sue but on behalf of everybody, where\nthey have to proceed under a Federal reg, and they are\ngoing to get a huge amount of money, and you say that's\nwhat we want arbitrated.\nMR. PHILLIPS: And that's precisely what\nwe've asked for here, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So this one is not so hard\nto figure out.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There might be some that\nare.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, and there's no\nquestion about that, and it's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's hard to\nfigure out, you have, let's say, a franchisee, and you\nhave a dispute with the franchisor. And the franchisee\nsays it's an antitrust violation, and I'm going to sue\nyou under the California antitrust law, and he does.\nAnd the Federal court says, we've looked through and\nsays, well, you could have sued under the Federal\nantitrust law. And you -- yes, I could have; I\ndeliberately didn't. And then they say, well, this is\nsomething that could have been brought in Federal court.\nAnd that really deprives a plaintiff of his right to\nframe his complaint as he sees fit.\nMR. PHILLIPS: And I understand that,\nMr. Chief Justice. And in the right case, you know, I'm\nnot sure how I would come out in that particular --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, in his case, in the\nChief Justice's case, wouldn't you say they don't get\ninto court, probably don't because they are bringing\nthis under a State law?\nMR. PHILLIPS: You see, I would comply with\nthe original complaint.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. But you just\nsay, is the dispute one that could have been brought in\nFederal court?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. Well, that's exactly\nwhat the Eleventh Circuit held.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a violation of\nthe Sherman Act.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, it could\nbe brought in Federal court.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well -- and in the right\ncase, the Federal -- you know, if I had to go that far,\nI might well make that argument, Mr. Chief Justice, but\nin this case I don't have to go that far. And I think\nall the Court needs to resolve is in a situation where\nthe parties have a very concrete dispute between them,\none that arises exclusively under Federal law, and a\nparty seeks to have that claim arbitrated under section\n4 pursuant to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That claim doesn't --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me get one fact.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is the State court suit\nstill pending?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, the State court suit is\npending.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So there are two separate\nunderlying actions.\nMR. PHILLIPS: The State court has stayed\nits hand pending the outcome of the Federal litigation.\nSo we'll see what happens. But, obviously, as I say --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there could be\nnothing left for the State court to do after you have\nthe arbitration. I mean, not that you arbitrate about\ninterest due on a nonexistent debt. I mean, you have to\nhave the two things together.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, in some ways,\nas I say, it seems to me that's Petitioner's right or\npotentially -- or ours. I suppose either side could ask\nto have that arbitrated, but the truth is if you took --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I just can't envision a\ncase where what you haven't effected is taking a case, a\ndebt, simple debt, no diversity a State court case.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And you remove the State\ncourt from the picture and gotten it over into Federal\ncourt to order the arbitration and any follow-up to the\narbitration. It just seems to me you have effected --\naccomplished what you could not have accomplished by the\n-- by removal, which you admit that you can't remove on\nthe basis of a counterclaim.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But see, Justice Ginsburg, I\nthink that's not right. I think that actually what\nhappens is you eliminate what I perceive to be the\nFederal question in this through the arbitral process.\nYou still have the underlying collection\naction. If the Court says, no, there is no violation of\nthe usury laws, you have not overcharged, you have not\nmade any mistakes, the question we still have is a claim\non the debt and her obligation to pay it.\nNow, whether she wants to adjudicate that in\nState court or resolve it as part of the arbitral\nprocess, that's really up to her as far as how that\ngoes. But the arbitration agreement could not be\nplainer in saying that you can divide up the claims for\npurposes of seeking arbitration, and that seems to fit\nperfectly well with an effort to say that there is a\nspecific claim here that arises exclusively under\nFederal law, and that, therefore, we can enforce our\narbitration rights pursuant to that section 4 right.\nAnd that's, frankly, all we are trying to\naccomplish here, Justice Ginsburg.\nThe second part of the statute which is\nthe -- you know, the one that has obviously created the\ngreatest amount of controversy here, is, you know,\n\"would have jurisdiction over the subject matter.\"\nAgain, it seems to me that this is the easiest case the\nCourt is going to face in this area, because here is one\nwhere there is no question --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's what worries me.\nThat's what worries me.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If we accept your theory,\nthis is the easiest case, what about the hard cases that\nare further down the line?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think what's going to\nhappen -- I candidly don't think they are going to come\nup that much, in part because these issues have been\naround a long time. You know, it's not like there have\nbeen dozens of these kinds of issues arising over time.\nI don't think it's likely to be that big a problem.\nBut again, it seems to me that district\ncourts have the authority to resolve this, because if\nthey don't believe that there really is a Federal claim\nthat would justify exercise of section 4, they can say\nthat. If they do, then they will -- then they will send\nit.\nI mean, look -- the other thing about this\nis, you know, the other side makes a big fuss about\nfederalism, but we are not asking to take the issues\naway from the Federal court -- from the State courts to\nthe Federal courts. What we are asking for is what\neverybody has agreed to here, which is to have these\ndisputes resolved by arbitration.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you could have asked\nfor that in the State court as well, and --\nMR. PHILLIPS: There is no question about\nthat, Justice Ginsburg. The problem is that there is\nsome lack of confidence in the State courts that we will\nget the same treatment under section 4 that we would get\nin Federal court. And Congress created that right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then bring that up here on\nappeal from the State court.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I wish it were that\neasy to get this Court to grant review of everything\nthat I bring up here in the first place.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You don't have any\ntrouble.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PHILLIPS: I appreciate that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It's not really -- of\ngetting constants from Federal judges; the arbitrators\ncan decide this question.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The arbitrator might\ndecide there is no preemption.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. But the -- and that's\nfine and we have to live with that. And obviously,\nsince we can't change the standards of review on the\nback end under sections 9, 10 and 11, we are going to be\npretty much stuck with that -- with that determination.\nBut the truth is the bigger risk is that the trial\njudge, the State court will not send it to arbitration.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this, I haven't\nreread the Moses Cone case, but is your adversary\ncorrect in saying that there would have been no\njurisdiction in that case it we followed your view?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Because the arbitrator was\nnot of diverse citizenship from the other parties?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I mean, It wasn't litigated.\nIt's not clear on the face of the opinion. So if there\nis something he knows that I don't know, maybe. But\nI -- I -- certainly nothing in there that reflects\nthat -- that view of the world.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But -- if, in fact, were a\nnondiverse party in the Moses Cohen, there should have\nbeen no jurisdiction?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, now, the nondiverse\nparty issue, it depends on how you read section 4. You\nknow, section 4 talks about the parties. And the\nparties there I don't think means parties to the\nunderlying controversy. I think there parties refers\nspecifically to the dispute in front of the court.\nSo I don't think the pass-through problem\nfor 1332 applies in that particular context for complete\ndiversity.\nI don't think Congress envisioned you would\nlook beyond the immediate dispute under section 4 to see\nwhether there are additional parties, except to the\nextent, obviously, that you would have necessary and\nindispensable party litigation that might bring them in.\nI think the assumption is you take the\ncomplaint as it's written, and then you look to see\nwhether or not there is amount of controversy. For that\nyou have to go beyond because the dispute with respect\nto arbitration is not going to get you anywhere near\nthat number. And you have to look beyond for Federal\nquestions to see whether or not there is a Federal issue\nthere to be enforced.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is this right? I'm asking\nif it may sound favorable to you, then I'll get a good\nresponse in rebuttal.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm not going to give a good\nresponse?\nJUSTICE BREYER: If you read it the other\nway -- if you read it the other way, the way the\nPetitioners want to read it, then is this so or not?\nThat then you look to see if there is Federal\njurisdiction of the arbitration agreement; is that\nright?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Under their interpretation?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, under their\ninterpretation.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, what you could have is\nyou could have two parties sign an arbitration agreement\nthat lasts for a year that governs all disputes between\nthem, and one is from Vermont; the other from\nCalifornia.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So there is jurisdiction.\nAnd all the disputes happen to involve just pure matters\nof -- that never could come into Federal court. I mean\nthere are such matters you could argue about.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Sure. Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But nevertheless, we have a\nFederal court issuing this injunction, under their\ntheory.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. Assuming the amount\nof --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Assuming they are right.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Assuming the amount of\ncontroversy -- I mean, it could have an amount --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, I see. The arbitration\nagreement has to meet the amount in controversy.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. It has to have an\nindependent basis for Federal jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So then\nprobably no arbitration agreement in itself meets the\namount.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, that's exactly our\npoint. That's why you have to look through.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So if you didn't look\nthrough, then this would apply to nothing?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Pretty much that's our view\nof the case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If the arbitration --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes. I'm sure my opponent\nwill say something different than that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The arbitration agreement\nhas to -- they talk about the arbitration agreement,\nthen you could have really important Federal questions\nin substantive issues --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- that couldn't come in\nbecause the arbitration agreement doesn't? Or you could\nhave State questions that would suddenly come in because\nthe arbitration agreement does. The arbitration -- but\nnow you're saying, well, that second case is never going\nto arise.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Probably not.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Probably not, because no\narbitration agreement has -- so then it becomes a\nnullity of the statute?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Except to overcome the\nouster. Okay. We've got your side of it.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it makes a nullity of\nit, except that it gets into the Federal court the\ndecision on the arbitration agreement, which was the\nobject of this stuff, whatever -- whatever the\nunderlying claim is, whether it's a Federal claim or\nnot.\nAs I understood the purpose of the\nArbitration Act, it was to make sure that arbitration\nwas -- was honored not just in Federal cases but in\nState cases as well. And it's entirely compatible with\nthat, that sometimes a Federal court will -- will direct\narbitration in a case this involves an underlying\ncontroversy that's purely non-Federal.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Oh absolutely. I mean, you\nknow, in a situation -- it depends on how you interpret\nit. If you interpret it the way that the Petitioner\ndoes in saying that you can't have any look through --\nnow he softens that and says, well, no, you can have\nlook through for diversity.\nBut if you accept the idea that section 4\nonly makes you look at the dispute at the arbitration\nlevel, then the reality is you're going to have no cases\nthat are going to be covered, because you're never going\nto satisfy the amount in controversy.\nAnd then the issue is why do you get to look\nthrough for diversity purposes and never get to look\nthrough for Federal question purposes? And it -- it\nseems to me the much easier way to reconcile the\nlanguage of the statute is to say, of course, you look\nthrough to see, particularly if you have an unquestioned\nFederal question dispute that's being litigated between\nthe parties; we know that; there is not an issue before\nus. In fact, he has conceded as much even here in court\ntoday.\nAnd so, it seems to me that's the solution\nto this case. Now admittedly, there will be other cases\nwhere you may have right in these questions, and there\nwill be other cases where the parties will have to fight\nat the Federal district court level as to precisely\nwhat's at issue and what the plaintiff really means to\nbe fighting over. And it may be in some instances you\nwon't get an order that directs arbitration. But that's\nnot this case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why isn't it proper to\nlook to see -- the party who wants arbitration has a\ndispute; the dispute is we are owed money by the debtor.\nWhy shouldn't the court say, well, we'll see what your\ncase is about; if your case would qualify for Federal\njurisdiction, fine. But we are not going to look to see\nwhat the defendants cases is or might be. We'll just\nlook at your case and that's how we will define the\ncontroversy.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, there are two problems\nwith that. First of all, the statute talks about the\nsubject matter of the controversy. It doesn't talk\nabout the specific controversy.\nAnd second of all, the statute clearly\nenvisions that there are going to be situations where\nthere is no complaint, there is no underlying State\ncourt cause of action, and it still envisions in that\nsituation that a district court is going to have to\ndetermine whether or not it would have jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But then you'll have not\nonly a hypothetical claim, because nothing has been\nbrought, but an hypothetical answer by way of\ncounterclaim to that claim.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But it seems to me that's\nprecisely what the language \"would have jurisdiction\nover the subject matter of the controversy\" asks this\nCourt to make a determination of.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So you would come into\nthe court and say there is no suit going on anywhere,\nbut if we were to bring this suit in State court, the\ndefendant could have brought this Federal counterclaim?\nThat's a lot of hypothesis.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But it seems to me, Justice\nGinsburg, the better way to think about this is what if\nwe were getting letters from the Petitioner saying you\nare engaged in usurious conduct, you're outrageous, you\ngot to stop what you're doing, we are going to bring a\nclass action against you, you had better change your\nbehavior tomorrow, and they don't sue us, and they don't\nsue us, and they don't sue us?\nAnd then the question is are we entitled to\ngo to court to get that resolved and are we entitled to\nhave the resolution to that issue as a matter of\narbitration?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Phillips, the answer\nto a better hypothetical is what if there had been no\noriginal collection action but they had brought such an\naction.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. Well, that's --\nactually, you're right.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's the case you're\nreally saying. You're saying that is like this case.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That is this case.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And Justice Ginsburg is\nsuggesting it's not, because it happens to arise out of\na different -- quite different dispute.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. I thought your\nquestion absolutely nailed it because you said, would\nthis -- you know, if you brought that suit could you and\nwould you, and the answer is yes, you could, and\ntherefore you know as -- without any question that it's\na Federal suit.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Excuse me --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: As I understand your\nopponent, they would agree there was no jurisdiction\neven in that case.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. I think that's no\ndoubt that that's their position.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What do you do with the\nassertion that sections 9 through 11 are not in sync\nwith your view, because they would not give you -- you\ncould go in and -- to compel arbitration but once the\narbitration was award -- an award was made, you would\nnot have access to the Federal courts to enforce the\naward?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean the interesting\nthing about 9, 10 and 11 is if anything the language is\nbroader than our language. If we didn't have the \"save\nfor\" and \"would have jurisdiction under,\" this would\nclearly be an action that arises under Federal law,\nbecause the question, you know, section 4 says have you\nbeen aggrieved, do you have a right of action, and do\nyou have a remedy for that action?\nI mean, without this rigamarole that we've\nbeen talking about this whole time, we would have -- we\nwould easily have a 1331 action. So if anything you\nwould argue that 9, 10 and 11 arise under Federal law\nregardless. Now if you don't want to go that far, then\nit seems to me you just say you read sections 9, 10 and\n11 and pairing material with the limitation in Section 4\nand you wouldn't read it any broader than that.\nBut there is no basis for taking the\nunlimited languages in 9, 10 and 11 and somehow\ndistorting that to more narrowly limit the rights that\nwe have under Section 4. So I --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But the Petitioner says you\nnever clearly clarify the particular Federal on which\nthe jurisdiction rests on this case. What -- can you\nclarify that?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes. This case arises under\nsection 4 through Section 27.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Section 4 creates the\nFederal --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, it does create it,\nbecause section 4, without the \"would have jurisdiction\"\nlanguage clearly would be arising under jurisdiction, in\nmy judgment, and the only thing -- and then it places an\nadditional requirement on you.\nYou can't just use the contract that gets\nyou into Federal court. You have to then look to see\nwhether you would have had an underlying cause of action\nor an underlying Federal claim or whether there would\nhave been diversity jurisdiction on the underlying\nclaim.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why can't you have\nsort of modified look, through like a modified limited\nhangout or whatever it was? That is to say, you can\nlook through for the purpose of determining whether the\narbitration agreement raises a Federal question. But\nthat doesn't mean you have to look through to determine\nwhether the underlying controversy raises a Federal\nquestion.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Because I think -- I think\nthe reference in the statute to controversy clearly\nenvisions the underlying dispute between the parties,\nbecause it's not just the arbitration agreement and it's\nnot even just the controversy; it's the subject matter\nof the controversy, and you compare that to section 2\nand it's clear that what the Congress has in mind there\nis the underlying dispute between the parties.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the Petitioner's -- I'm\nsorry I didn't get a chance to ask the Petitioner -- is\nthe Petitioner's argument for a limited look through\ncompromised in any way by the Beneficial Bank case which\nallows removal if there is a Federal defense?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, I don't know if\nit's compromised by it. I think it -- the Beneficial\ncase makes it absolutely clear that we have here a\nFederal claim and therefore --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's of course in the\ncontext of a defense, as opposed to a counterclaim.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. But again I don't\nthink -- I don't think section 4 is asking the courts to\nmake that determination. I think what section 4 is\nasking the Court to look at is the subject matter of the\ncontroversy, and is it -- is it clear under the\ncircumstances that there is in fact a Federal claim\nunderlying it? And here there is no question on that.\nI ask you to affirm.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Phillips. Mr. Ortiz, you have three minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL R. ORTIZ\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ORTIZ: Thank you, Your Honor. Just a\nfew quick points.\nI think this Court should be exactly clear\nhow much Federal question jurisdiction the look-through\ntheory would create. So long as a Federal issue can be\nimagined anywhere in the lawsuit, there would be Federal\nquestion jurisdiction under this theory, and this is\nalmost by definition going to be the case in any dispute\nconcerning credit card debt, either because of the\ntheory of complete pre-emption from the FDIA, or because\nof the theory used in the Strong case before the\nEleventh Circuit that RICO's prohibition on the\ncollection of unlawful debt --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What about a Federal\ndefense?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That isn't quite true,\nbecause here there is a definition in the Federal claim\nin your counterclaim.\nMR. ORTIZ: I'm sorry, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: There is a definition of\nthe controversy in your counterclaim and in their\nresponse.\nMR. ORTIZ: No -- there -- in general, if\nyou accepted their theory, as long as there is an issue\nthat could be spun as a Federal issue which there will\nalways be in a credit card debt collection case and\njust -- in most States, that on look-through theory\nwould be --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You're suggesting that\nevery credit card debtor would have a class action?\nMR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, every -- it does not\nhave to be a class action to establish what would serve\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's your view, but I\nmean believe me, I think I can keep that problem under\ncontrol. That was your original point. I see the\npoint, it's going to spread too far; you'd have to have\nsome rules that cabin it.\nAssume I got that under control; maybe I\ndon't. This is a case of \"well, his brother was worse.\"\nWhat do you want to say about the criticisms of the\nhorrible things that happen if we adopt your position?\nMR. ORTIZ: Well, Your Honor, Respondent\nargues that this is an easy case, or at least over time\nthe courts will decide these things to make the\njurisdictional inquiry -- inquiries clear. Petitioner\ndoes not believe that is true.\nFor example, here the real party in interest\ndispute consumed much of the court's time. The lower\ncourts have gone both ways on this issue. It's\nincredibly fact-dependent. There is no easy answer for\nit.\nAlso, Your Honor, Petitioner does not\nbelieve that the Declaratory Judgment Act would have\nbeen appropriate in this case. Declaratory judgments\nare discretionary and in this context of where you have\na pending State court lawsuit Petitioner believes that a\nFederal district court would be very cautious before\npermitting one.\nAlso Your Honor, if in the context of\ndeclaratory judgment action presumably the district\ncourt would have to take the State court admission into\naccount, and in particular here it was admitted that the\naccount was with Discover Financial Services not with\nthe bank.\nAlso, Your Honors, this -- Respondents try\nto portray Petitioner's position as siphoning off all\nFederal question jurisdiction. That is not true. Under\nPetitioner's view, a lot of Federal question\njurisdiction -- some would remain. It would just be\nthat the arbitration agreement itself would have to\nsound in Federal law. ERISA arbitration agreements\nwould still be covered. Some labor agreements would\nstill be covered. There would be --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, what do\nyou mean would still be covered?\nMR. ORTIZ: Would still be covered under\nPetitioner's theory of what section 4 means. So for\nexample, Mr. Chief Justice --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which would still be\nin Federal court.\nMR. ORTIZ: Would still be in Federal court.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
