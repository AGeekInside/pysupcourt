        "content": "(10:19 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nthis morning in Case 11-5683, Dorsey v. United States,\nand 11-5721, Hill v. United States.\nMr. Eberhardt.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN E. EBERHARDT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. EBERHARDT: Mr. Chief Justice, may it\nplease the Court:\nThe judges of the Seventh Circuit are\nunanimous in their belief that this case raises a good\nquestion. And, of course, that good question is: Why\nwould Congress want district courts to continue to\nimpose sentences that were universally viewed as unfair\nand racially discriminatory?\nMy colleague sitting on the other side of\nthe podium, I submit to the Court, does not answer that\nquestion. Petitioners feel that the answer to that\nquestion can be found in the text of the Fair Sentencing\nAct. And while we admit that there is no express\nanswer, the text gives us the required fair implication.\nThe text in section 8, the text in section\n10 -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Is a fair\nimplication enough? You're talking here about a repeal,\nessentially, of an earlier provision, section 109. And\nour cases uniformly say that it -- it has to be clear\nimplication, unquestionable implication.\nDo you think this is really clear and\nunquestionable?\nMR. EBERHARDT: No, it is not, but the\nstandard from this Court, Justice Scalia, is fair\nimplication, and it has been ever since Great -- the\nGreat Northern case. It -- the standards began -- I'm\nsorry -- as a necessary implication in Great Northern,\nmoved to plain and clear implication in Hertz and\nWoodman, and then Marrero, which is relied on heavily by\namicus.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, the\nstatute itself says \"express,\" right? Talking about\nsection 109.\nMR. EBERHARDT: That is correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, we're pretty far\nremoved from the language of the statute, I guess.\nMR. EBERHARDT: But, again, ever since 1908,\nthat's a standard that this Court has not accepted. And\nthis is based on the provision, the well-settled\nprovision, that an earlier Congress cannot bind a later\nCongress.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, and I understand\nthat. But presumably -- we also have the proposition\nthat Congress, when it enacts legislation, knows the\nlaw. They would have known section 109 required an\nexpress statement if they wanted to apply the change\nretroactively. So, why shouldn't we hold them to that\nstandard?\nMR. EBERHARDT: The answer is no, I don't\nbelieve that Congress felt that that was the standard.\nAgain relying on this Court's jurisprudence that said\nyou give us text and if we are able to find that the\nfair implication and the intent of Congress through that\nfair implication is that this new statute applies,\nbecause an earlier Congress cannot bind the newer\nCongress -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, on your statement\nthat the -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did it -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- one Congress cannot\nbind a later Congress, do you mean we're not supposed to\nlook at 109? We're not supposed to look at the\nDictionary Act?\nMR. EBERHARDT: Oh, absolutely, the Court\nis, Your Honor. And we acknowledge -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So, then -- so, then the\nfact that 109 is on the books is relevant. And -- and\nit's not a question of one Congress binding the other.\nIt's a question of what the second Congress did.\nMR. EBERHARDT: Yes, 109 is relevant, but\nit's the standard to be employed in determining whether\nor not there's a fair implication of what the later\nCongress meant.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm really troubled by\n\"fair implication\" -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You're right that if -\nyou're right -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How many -- how many cases\ndo you have that say \"fair implication\" as opposed to\nquite a few that say \"clear and unquestionable\nimplication\"?\nMarrero? Is that -- is that the one case\nyou rely on?\nMR. EBERHARDT: Fair implication from\nMarrero -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: From a footnote in Marrero,\nright?\nMR. EBERHARDT: Correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. Anything else?\nMR. EBERHARDT: Marcello.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Marcello? Where -- what's\nthe cite for that?\nI mean, there are a lot of earlier cases\nthat make it clear when you're repealing a prior statute\nif it isn't express, it has to be at least a clear\nimplication. And I'm -- I'm astounded to think that in\na footnote, we're suddenly going to change that to\nsimply \"fair implication.\"\nMR. EBERHARDT: Yes, Your Honor. You're\ncorrect, a clear or a necessary, but Petitioners contend\nthat not only do we meet the fair implication\nstandard -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's a different\nquestion. And we can talk about that. But how did\nMarrero come out? Did it -- did it find an overruling\nor not?\nMR. EBERHARDT: Marrero primarily was based\non the fact that there was a specific provision for\nnonretroactivity. In an alternate holding, the Court\nheld that 109 would also be relevant to the decision.\nMarrero, though, was a habeas -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, it did not find 109\novercome by fair implication, right?\nMR. EBERHARDT: Correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, it's entirely dictum,\nright? And dictum in a footnote.\nMR. EBERHARDT: No, I believe it is an\nalternative holding, because the primary holding in -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought it was the other\nway. The holding was that 109 governed. No?\nMR. EBERHARDT: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said the\nholding was that section 109 governed, that it had not\nbeen repealed.\nMR. EBERHARDT: 109 was the alternative\nholding, saying that 109 would also preclude the\nretroactivity provision.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly. And, therefore,\nwhatever it said about what is necessary for repeal of\n109 was purely dictum, because it held that 109 was not\nrepealed. So, even if fair implication was the test, it\nwas not the test applied and determinative in the case.\nSo, it's dictum. And dictum in a footnote.\nMR. EBERHARDT: I don't agree, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's true of all of\nthe cases that you -- the cases -- you pointed to two or\nthree that use \"fair implication.\" The Court in all\nthose cases found that there was no fair implication, so\nthat 109 governed.\nIsn't -- isn't that so?\nThat was true in Marrero. It was true in\nNorthern Securities.\nMR. EBERHARDT: In Marrero, the primary\nholding was based on the fact that there was a specific\nprovision for nonretroactivity.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But in none of the cases\nthat used the fair implication language did the Court\nsay: And, therefore, the old statute no longer governs.\nMR. EBERHARDT: Correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, you're relying on a\nstandard that this Court did -- must have considered\nappropriate because it deviated from the words of the\nstatute. It said it a few times. But in application,\nit always came out the same way.\nMR. EBERHARDT: Well, in application, when\nthe Court applied this in Marcello, when they were\nweighing the language of the Administrative Procedure\nAct as opposed to the language of the Immigration and\nNationality Act, I think the Court made clear, as it\nwent through the statute there, that there was a fair\nimplication. And then once you get to the point of fair\nimplication, it necessarily means that there is some\nkind of an ambiguity.\nAnd then the Court followed up saying that\nwe then did look to the legislative history, and the\nlegislative history backs up the implication that we did\nfind.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was not true of\nthe 109 cases. You don't have a 109 case that said the\nstandard is fair implication, and, therefore, the old\nstatute is not enforced.\nMR. EBERHARDT: Directly? I don't believe\nso.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Do you think that if -\nJUSTICE ALITO: What do -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Do you think that if we\nstick to the language of the statute, if we are, indeed,\nlooking for an express provision, do you agree that\nthere isn't any here?\nMR. EBERHARDT: We agree there is no express\nprovision, but obviously, we also contend that going\nback to the proposition that an earlier Congress cannot\nbind a later, that that standard has been rejected even\nthough argued by my colleague to my left. That is no\nlonger the standard ever since -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I'm not sure he's\narguing that. I think he acknowledges, as our opinions\nsay, that it can be done by implication, but it has to\nbe clear and unmistakable implication. I think that's\nthe position he's taking.\nAnyway, you want to tell me why this is\nclear and unmistakable?\nMR. EBERHARDT: When you look at the\nlanguage of section 8, when Congress has mandated the\nSentencing Commission to use their emergency authority\nto achieve consistency with other guideline provisions\nand applicable law, it makes clear that Congress meant\nthis needs to take effect as soon as possible. Congress\neven said \"as soon as practicable and no later than\n90 days.\"\nThis would be meaningless, actually, with\nregard to the individuals who were in this pipeline to\nbe sentenced, because there would be so few individuals\nwho would be arrested, charged, convicted, and sentenced\nwithin that 90-day period that Congress could only -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, there might be a few,\nbut there -- but assume that you're drafting this\nlegislation and you want it to apply only to defendants\nwho commit an offense after the enactment of the Fair\nSentencing Act, but you also want to do everything that\nyou reasonably can to make sure that when the very first\none of those defendants comes up for sentencing, there\nwill be new sentencing guidelines in effect that are\ngeared to the new lower mandatory minimums rather than\nthe old sentencing guidelines in effect.\nWould you not provide that the -- would you\nnot require the Sentencing Commission to act as quickly\nas possible to get the new sentencing guidelines out?\nMR. EBERHARDT: No.\nJUSTICE ALITO: No?\nMR. EBERHARDT: Because of the -\nJUSTICE ALITO: You would say take your time\nand it doesn't matter if a few -- a few defendants who\nare -- who commit the offense after the enactment of the\nFair Sentencing Act come up and they are -- they're\nsubjected to the old soon-to-be-obsolete sentencing\nguidelines?\nMR. EBERHARDT: No. I think it's clear that\nthe average time from charging to sentencing is going to\nbe at least 11 months. In a case where a defendant goes\nto trial, it's going to be much more than that. So,\nthere really need be no rush on the part of Congress to\ncondense this down into 90 days. They could go through\ntheir usual 120-day -- or 180-day procedure, submit\nthese to Congress, wait for approval or disapproval, and\nthings like that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are we just supposed\nto assume that Congress knows that? I mean, if you had\nasked me how long is the usual time from conviction\nor -- I mean, arrest to conviction, I wouldn't know if\nit's closer to 90 days or 11 months.\nMR. EBERHARDT: I think we do, Chief\nJustice -- Mr. Chief Justice. We have to know that\nCongress -- Congress knows that because these are the\nindividuals who drafted the Sentencing Reform Act.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, right. But I\nmean -- and we assume Congress knows the law. I don't\nknow that we can readily assume they know details such\nas that and evaluate their -- what would your position\nbe if the Congress said do this as soon as practical\nbut, in any event, no later than 8 months from now?\nWould we then think there's a fair implication that\nCongress meant it to apply retroactively or not?\nMR. EBERHARDT: On just the point of the\nimmediacy placed on by Congress, I think that would take\naway from the fair implication that Congress meant that\nit -- the law should go -- or the law should be\neffective on the date of the President's signature.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why do you pick the date\nthat the Fair Sentencing Act went into effect, if it -\nif what -- if the guidelines, the 90-day period that the\nCommission came out with its new guidelines on\nNovember 1st, that's some time after August 3rd, which\nis when the Sentencing Act. So, on your theory, why\nisn't the right date the date that the Sentencing\nGuidelines went into effect?\nMR. EBERHARDT: The correct date is the\nAugust 3rd date, Your Honor, because of the intent of\nCongress made known through the implication of the\nlanguage taken in the legal context of the Sentencing\nReform Act. When Congress meant to correct their error,\nI believe they made it perfectly clear that they meant\nto correct this error as soon as possible. This has\nbeen an error that had been discussed for 25 years and\nwas finally trying to be corrected.\nAnd, Mr. Chief Justice, if I might reserve\nthe rest of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. EBERHARDT: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Dreeben.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nIN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Fair Sentencing Act manifests the\nrequisite fair and necessary implication that Congress\nintended that its new mandatory minimum thresholds apply\nin all sentencings after the date of the Act.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you think it's a\nclear and unmistakable implication -\nMR. DREEBEN: First of all -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- if we're going to\nargue about the language?\nMR. DREEBEN: I do, Justice Sotomayor.\nAlthough this Court has not used the words \"clear and\nunmistakable\" to describe what it takes to overcome of\nthe presumption by section 109, it has used the\nwords -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, generally the word\n\"express\" incorporates \"clear.\"\nMR. DREEBEN: There's no dispute here, I\ndon't think, that there's a -- a lack of an express\nstatement in the Act. But -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, that -- why doesn't\nthat defeat your case?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, as Justice Scalia\nexplained in his concurring opinion in\nLockhart v. United States, one Congress cannot impose\nstandards of how another Congress is to enact\nlegislation. The subsequent Congress is free to choose\nhow it will express its will in the language or\nstructure that it sees fit. And I'd like to give an\nexample -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, so then we -- we\nignore the Dictionary Act?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, of course not,\nJustice Kennedy. These -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And we ignore 109?\nMR. DREEBEN: No. It provides a background\npresumption that overcomes the common-law rule of\nabatement, under which, if Congress had amended a\nstatute, all prosecutions under the prior statute would\nbe deemed to be a nullity and they would -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, why doesn't it -\nwhy doesn't that bring us right back to what 109 says?\nMR. DREEBEN: This Court has made clear in\nnot only the section 109 cases, but I think, as my\ncolleague mentioned in Marcello v. Bonds, that there are\nno magical passwords that Congress has to use to explain\nitself.\nAnd let me give an example because I think\nthat it will help to put in focus why I think the Fair\nSentencing Act does contain the requisite implication.\nIf Congress had written in the Fair Sentencing Act,\nhenceforth, after the date of this Act, probation\nofficers shall prepare presentence reports and submit\nthem to courts in which they shall calculate the\nmandatory minimum penalties under the standards\nannounced in this Act, I think this Court would draw the\nstructural inference that it did not intend that\nprobation officers prepare that information for nothing.\nThey intended that it be prepared so that sentencing\ncourts would use those new mandatory -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly, and I think we\nwould come out that way. I think you're entirely right.\nBut the accelerated -- the direction to the Guidelines\nCommission to promulgate the guidelines on a -- on an\nemergency basis is not, as you just put it, for nothing.\nIt has -\nMR. DREEBEN: I agree with that,\nJustice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: As Justice Alito was\nsuggesting -\nMR. DREEBEN: No, I don't -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- it has some effect.\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't disagree with that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, it -- it's not\ncomparable to what you've just said.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I think it is because\nthere's a piece of the -- that -- that section that I'd\nlike to draw the Court's attention to, because I think\nthat it critically explains what the Sentencing\nCommission was supposed to do. Section 8 is all over\nthe briefs, but I have it in the Government's gray brief\nat page 10a.\nThis is the section that directs the\nSentencing Commission to promulgate new guidelines and\nto exercise its emergency authority -- and I'm going to\nquote here -- \"to make such conforming amendments to the\nFederal sentencing guidelines as the Commission deems\nnecessary to achieve consistency with other guidelines\nprovisions and\" -- here's the critical phrase -\n\"applicable law.\"\nThat phrase, \"applicable law,\" can only mean\nsections 2 and 3 of the Fair Sentencing Act, which are\nthe provisions that increased the thresholds of\nquantities necessary to trigger the mandatory minimum\nsentences.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's fine. But it -\nthey apply that applicable law to those, as you say,\nadmittedly few people who have been prosecuted,\nconvicted, and are now being sentenced under that\napplicable law.\nMR. DREEBEN: But -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There may not be many of\nthem, but it does not -- it does not deprive that\nlanguage of all meaning.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Scalia, I want\nto put this in the structural context of the Sentencing\nReform Act. The Sentencing Reform Act directs courts to\napply the version of the Sentencing Guidelines that is\nin effect on the day of sentencing. It's not a time of\noffense rule; it's a time of sentencing rule.\nAnd there -- that means that everybody who\ncomes before the sentencing court after the date of the\nFair Sentencing Act when the new guidelines are in place\nwill have those guidelines applied to those defendants.\nThose guidelines are supposed to be conformed to\napplicable law. The only applicable law that there\ncould be is the new mandatory minimum standard.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, no, you're begging\nthe question. The -- the law applicable to pre- -\npre-statute offenses continues to be the prior law, and\nthe applicable law to offenses that have occurred after\nthe enactment date is the -\nMR. DREEBEN: But that would mean,\nJustice Scalia, that the guidelines would not be\nconformed to applicable law for the defendants who are\nsentenced after the FSA. They would be conformed to\ninapplicable law. And Congress knew when it set up\nsection 3553(a) that the guidelines that would be\napplied are the ones that are in force at the time of\nsentencing.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, why -- why\n90 days? I mean, the Commission basically just took the\nratio under the new Act and applied it, didn't they,\nthroughout? They took the mandatory minimum formula\nthat had been changed and changed it throughout the -\nthe sentencing provisions?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, it was a little bit more\ncomplex than that, because what -- what the FSA did was\ntwo things: It lowered the mandatory minimums by\nincreasing the crack thresholds, and it targeted role in\nthe offense of the defendant for increased sentencing\nand mitigating factors for decreased sentencing. And\nthe Commission had to translate that into new\nguidelines.\nIt acted quickly. It was told to act as\nsoon as practicable. It was entirely possible under the\nstatute, and probably would have been desired by\nCongress, that new guidelines would have gone into\neffect on August 4th. At that point, the only people in\nfront of the sentencing court would have been pre-FSA\noffenders.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but how -- how many\nare we talking about, say, a 3-month period? How\nmany people commit -- most people -- everybody pleads\nguilty. They're caught quickly and sentenced quickly -\nMR. DREEBEN: Not necessarily.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know not necessarily.\nThat's why I want your estimate of how many we're\ntalking about.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, roughly speaking, there\nhas historically been about 5,000 crack offenders a\nyear. So, that means that come -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And how -- how long\nhistorically, roughly, if you know, does it take from\nthe time the person's caught till the time he's\nsentenced, when he pleads guilty?\nMR. DREEBEN: We put in the brief the\nfigures from the Administrative Office of the U.S.\nCourts, which indicate that the median figure is around\n11 months, but -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Eleven months?\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But how many of -- you see\nwhat I'm trying to get at. I'm trying to get at a\nguess, if you like, of how many people we're talking\nabout. The two numbers that I can't find in the briefs\nare roughly -- if your opponent is correct, and it only\napplies to new people, this thing. That's the\napplicable law. In other words, you're assuming the\nanswer -- in your answer to Justice Scalia, you're\nassuming the answer.\nI haven't heard an argument for it, except\nthat there are very few people that his interpretation\nor the opposite interpretation would catch. And how\nmany are there?\nMR. DREEBEN: I'm reluctant to guess,\nJustice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: About? I mean, is it more\nlike 10, or is it more like 50, is it more like 100?\nCan you make a guess at all?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, let me put it this way,\nJustice Breyer -\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right -\nMR. DREEBEN: I think that there -- there\nwill probably be thousands of crack defendants who will\nbe sentenced under the old mandatory minimums that\nCongress repealed because they were perceived as being\nracially disparate and unfair and -\nJUSTICE BREYER: It isn't obvious to you\nwhat I'm trying to get at.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well -\nJUSTICE BREYER: You -- you see what I'm\ntrying to get at? I guess -\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't think that Congress\nbalanced numerically -\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no.\nMR. DREEBEN: -- the numbers -\nJUSTICE BREYER: But you're saying it would\nbe absurd to think that this section 8 has to do only\nwith prior -- the pre-enactment offenses. Absurd, all\nright? If there's just likely to be one person, I tend\nto buy your absurdity argument. If there's likely to be\n500 or 1,000, I'm much less certain.\nMR. DREEBEN: I'm not making an absurdity\nargument, Justice Breyer. The argument that I'm making\nis that when Congress directed the Commission -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. DREEBEN: -- to conform the guidelines\nto applicable law, the only applicable law that it could\nhave had in mind -\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, that argument -- of\ncourse, they could have had both in mind. They could\nhave had applicable law for the new people is our new\nstatute; applicable for the old people, you don't need\nany amendment, we're not talking about that, just apply\nthe old law.\nMR. DREEBEN: But they don't -\nJUSTICE BREYER: That made perfect sense.\nMR. DREEBEN: But the Sentencing Reform\nAct -- it doesn't make perfect sense, because the\nSentencing Reform Act is set up to apply new guidelines\nto people based on date of sentencing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: New guidelines to what\npeople? That's the issue.\nMR. DREEBEN: Everyone.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If it's only new -- you're\nbegging the question again.\nMR. DREEBEN: No, I don't believe so,\nJustice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If it's -- if it's only to\npeople who have committed their offenses after that Act,\nthen you have one set of applicable guidelines for those\npeople, and you leave in effect, for people who\ncommitted their offense before the -- the enactment\ndate, the prior guidelines. I don't think there's\nanything necessarily implied by -- by this provision to\nthe effect that -\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- there is only in the\nfuture one set of guidelines applied, you know, one\nguideline fits all. I don't think that's -\nMR. DREEBEN: Let me refer to the statute\nbecause the statute answers this question differently\nthan the way Your Honor has assumed it works. Okay? On\npage 30a of our appendix, we reproduce section 3553(a),\nand 3353(a)(4) establishes that when a -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. 30a?\nMR. DREEBEN: 30a -- I'm sorry, 39a.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: 39a.\nMR. DREEBEN: Sorry about that.\nThe -- the Sentencing Reform Act provides\nthat the applicable set of guidelines that will be\napplied are those that are in effect on the date that\nthe defendant is sentenced. This is 3553(a)(4)(A)(ii).\nAnd that provision has been in the Sentencing Reform Act\nsince the -- since the time the Sentencing Reform Act\nwas enacted. And Congress explained, for those who read\nlegislative history, that it wanted -- and I am going to\nquote here from the legislative history: \"The\nguidelines and policy statements to be applied are those\nin effect at the time of sentencing.\"\nCongress's reason for that was it wanted the\nmost sophisticated statements available that will most\nappropriately carry out the purposes of sentencing, and\nto impose a sentence under outmoded guidelines will\nfoster irrationality in sentencing and would be contrary\nto the goal of consistency in sentencing. So -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is section 3742(g),\nwhich is -\nMR. DREEBEN: That provides that if a case\nis reversed on appeal and sent back for resentencing,\nthe original set of guidelines that were applied at the\ndate of the initial sentencing shall be used. It's an\nexception to the general rule.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you this about\nyour argument? Because I do think the one you're\nstressing now is a -- is a good argument and your best\none. But what troubles me is that an earlier bill, H.R.\n265, which contained the provision that says \"there\nshall be no retroactive application of any portion of\nthis Act\" contains the very language that you're\nstressing now.\nSo, how do you reconcile that?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, first of all,\nJustice Alito, what that bill would have done is\npostpone the effective date for 180 days so that there\ncould be synchronicity between the guidelines and the\nnew mandatory minimums. The retroactivity that it was\nconcerned about would have reopened final sentences.\nThere's no question here about reopening final\nsentences. So, that bill was explicit: We don't want\nto reopen final sentences.\nThe Government is not asking for reopening\nof final sentences.\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, I understand that. But\nwouldn't you want -- the problem that you're -- maybe --\nI understand your argument to be that the language\nyou're stressing now will mean, if this applies only to\npost-enactment offenders, that there will be defendants\nwho will be sentenced to -- under the -- under old -\nunder the old mandatory minimums but the new guidelines.\nMR. DREEBEN: Correct.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Would that not occur under\nthe -- clearly occur under H.R. 265?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, I don't think so, because\nthat -- that bill was designed to postpone the effective\ndate for 180 days.\nI think everyone in Congress understood that\nthese guidelines had undermined the credibility of the\ncriminal justice system for years. The Sentencing\nCommission had four times submitted reports to Congress\nthat bemoaned the fact that they were not only\ninconsistent with the purposes of -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. But I mean -- yes,\nthat's very nice, but let's talk about text, not what\nabout the emotions of Congress.\nThis section that you quoted, (a) -- what,\n(4)(A)(ii) -\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- of section 3553(a) -\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that in the new statute?\nMR. DREEBEN: No. That's part of the\nSentencing Reform Act from the beginning of the\nguidelines. It was -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It was in effect -\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It was not the amendment.\nMR. DREEBEN: No. No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Congress didn't insert\nthat -\nMR. DREEBEN: It was -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- when it made this\namendment. You're just saying that that is the\nincidental effect of the provision that Congress did\nadopt?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, I'm saying that the\nbackground principle that our legislators are familiar\nwith the law surely applies to sentencing law; and\nCongress understood that once the new guidelines were in\neffect, which it wanted to happen as soon as\npracticable, they would be applied to all defendants in\nthe system based on time of -- of sentencing, not time\nof offense. And it wanted those guidelines to be\nconformed to applicable law.\nAnd it is very strange to say that it wanted\nnew guidelines in effect to be conformed to inapplicable\nlaw such that there would be the incongruous result that\nthe new guidelines that finally fixed this egregious\nproblem in the criminal justice system would be\nirrelevant for many defendants because they would still\nbe living under the 100-to-1 racially disparate impact\neffect of the guidelines, of these -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Dreeben, almost any\nlaw that repeals a prior penalty is doing so because the\nlegislature determines that that prior penalty is unjust\nin some way, because why do you eliminate a penalty\nunless you think it is necessary to do so and that it's\ninjust or unjust in some way?\nSo, what makes this repeal particularly\ndifferent so that the exception doesn't swallow the\nrule, because you can argue in almost any situation that\nthe repeal is of something that's unjust?\nMR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, may I\nanswer the question?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Certainly.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Sotomayor, what's\nunique about this context is that there's a confluence\nbetween the way that the guidelines treated crack and\nthe way that the statutes treated crack. And for years,\nthe Sentencing Commission had said: We can't fix this\nproblem with the guidelines alone; we need the help of\nCongress to alter the mandatory minimums.\nAnd once you do that, give us emergency\nauthority so that we can put new guidelines into place\nthat will work hand-in-glove with the new mandatory\nminimums, as the Chief Justice explained, so that all\ndefendants who come before the Court will not be subject\nto the discredited crack policy that Congress had\nrepealed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Estrada.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL A. ESTRADA,\nAS THE COURT-APPOINTED AMICUS CURIAE,\nIN SUPPORT OF THE JUDGMENTS BELOW\nMR. ESTRADA: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nI think this is a difficult case for public\npolicy but is not a difficult case for legal doctrine.\nFairness is on both sides -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Estrada, what's so\ndifficult for a legal doctrine to say that when Congress\nhas made a finding that a law has a discriminatory\nimpact -- because I always thought that when\ndiscrimination was at issue, that we should do as speedy\na remedy as we could, because it is one of the most\nfundamental tenets of our Constitution, as has been\nrepeatedly emphasized in case after case, that our laws\nshould be -- should be enforced in a race-neutral way.\nOnce Congress has said this law's not being\nenforced in a race-neutral way, we want to fix it, why\nshouldn't our presumption be that the fix is immediate\nrather than delayed?\nMR. ESTRADA: Because I think it would be\nwrong to assume that the passage of the Act reflects\nCongress's concession of intentional discrimination. I\nthink it does recognize that there were members of\nCongress that had concerns about the disparate impact of\nthe law.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Estrada, I've been a\njudge for nearly 20 years, and I don't know that there's\none law that has created more controversy or more\ndiscussion about its racial impact than this one.\nMR. ESTRADA: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't think there is\nany other law that had as much conversation about its\nracial implications than this one.\nMR. ESTRADA: Justice Sotomayor, that is\nabsolutely right. But it is very significant that for\n20 years we had this argument. The Sentencing\nCommission, as the Government points out, went to\nCongress again and again and again to say we don't agree\nwith this, this makes no sense. And for 20 years,\nCongress could not bring itself to change it because\nthere was no agreement on the part of the lawmakers that\nthe public policy was that easy.\nAnd the fact is you have a whole assortment\nof bills that were considered by Congress in the last\nseveral sessions. For people who believe legislative\nhistory is significant, they're all very instructive.\nMost of them did a variant of the same thing. Most of\nthem have very identical language, even some of the\nlanguage that's at issue here.\nThey had different proposals. There was one\nfor 24:1, another one -- there were many one to one. It\nwas clear that Congress could not bring itself to an\nagreement as to what the right answer was.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but this\nagreement -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Estrada, I mean, that's\ntrue, that it took Congress a long time to decide to do\nthis. I think the question is, once having decided to\ndo this, what did it decide to do; and whether it would\nmake sense, once having decided to do this, to have the\nguidelines be the new guidelines, but the mandatory\nminimums be the old mandatory minimums.\nAnd what everybody understood was that if\nthat were the case, if the new guidelines and the\nold mandatory minimums sort of -- both applied together,\nit would lead to ridiculous disparities in the way\npeople were sentenced.\nAnd so, the question is, once having decided\nto do this, can't we assume that Congress decided to do\nit?\nMR. ESTRADA: No. Let me give three answers\nto that.\nI think, you know, one of the fundamental\npoints here is that a premise of the law is to treat\nlike people alike. And people who committed the same\noffense on the same date and may have done so with each\nother we would expect to get comparable punishment if\nthey are comparably situated as to criminal history.\nAnd the -- that the solution that's being urged\nundermines that even though that is exactly what section\n109 says.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you have to draw a\nline someplace, and that's inevitable, that -- that some\npeople are going to fall on one side. But the point\nabout the guidelines and the statute working together,\nwasn't there a time when the Sentencing Guidelines -\nthey wanted to do away with this distinction and\nCongress said, no, Sentencing Commission, you can't do\nit, you can't do it to the guidelines when we don't do\nit to the statute?\nMR. ESTRADA: There are two points about the\nguidelines that I think we have to keep in mind, Justice\nGinsburg. The first one is that they are guidelines,\nespecially in the world after Booker, which is the world\nthat confronted Congress in 2010. They are guides that\nmust be considered by the judge to inform judicial\ndiscretion. So, in the nature of the guidelines, there\nis nothing inherent in saying that we must have new ones\nthat also implies a new obligation of statutory law to\npeople whose offense conduct occurred earlier.\nThe second aspect of it is that it has been\npart of the nature of a guidelines system for two\ndecades that it has been consistent with the decision by\nCongress in some areas to constrain the exercise of\ndiscretion with mandatory minimums. And this Court has\nrecognized that in multiple occasions, in Kimbrough, in\nNeal, in DePierre, any number of cases. And the\nguidelines themselves in section 5G1 recognize that the\nmandatory minimum may trump a lower guideline.\nSo, when you have a long history in 2010 of\nrulings from this Court acknowledging, as you said in\nyour opinion in Kimbrough, that this may lead to cliffs,\net cetera, and you also have a recognition by the\nCommission itself that they have to integrate this\nreality of sentencing law into their own guidelines,\nthere is very little basis for an inference that\nCongress in providing new guidelines would have\ncontemplated that the effective date of the law would\nchange -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But Congress did say:\nSentencing Commission, you conform your new guidelines\nto applicable law. The applicable law has got to be the\nnew law, because if it were the old law, there's nothing\nto conform. There's nothing that they need to change.\nIt's only that this -- section A(ii) makes sense only if\nthe applicable law is the new law. Otherwise, the\nCommission doesn't have to do anything to achieve\nconsistency.\nMR. ESTRADA: Justice Ginsburg, I am\nprepared to admit for purposes of this case, and I think\nit's probably the right answer, that Congress intended\nthat the guidelines had to line up with the penalties of\nthe FSA. The question is cui bono? For whose benefit?\nAnd Congress clearly contemplated for some of the\nreasons that you outlined that the system in the change\nin the statute would not do any good for people coming\nto be sentenced 6 months later if they still had higher\nguidelines.\nBut much has been said here today about the\n90-day window. The 90-day window is irrelevant. The\nreally relevant window is the comparison of what the new\nguidelines would have been and when they would have come\nout absent the emergency authority. Absent any\nemergency authority, new guidelines would have come out\nNovember 1st, 2011, which would have been a good\n15 months after the passage of the FSA. And even under\nthe Government's accounting -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Estrada, even\nwithout the guideline amendment, for those defendants\nwho committed crimes after the effective date of this\nAct, they would not have had -- new offense, not old\noffense -- if the day after this Act they committed the\noffense, they wouldn't have had a mandatory minimum that\nrequired their imprisonment for a certain amount of\ntime, because the Act had already done away with the\nmandatory minimum, correct? Or changed the -\nMR. ESTRADA: For some of them. They have\nchanged some of them.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes, changed it, lowered\nthe amounts.\nMR. ESTRADA: Some of them may drop from 10\nto 5, for example, as one of the -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly.\nMR. ESTRADA: -- as one of the particulars.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, those people would\nnot have been bound to a mandatory minimum. And since\ndistrict courts were not bound to the guidelines anyway,\neven if there had been no amendment to the guideline,\nthe judges would have known they weren't bound to the\nmandatory minimum and probably not bound to guidelines\nthat hadn't been amended yet either.\nMR. ESTRADA: That's correct on both counts.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, it would have\nbenefited these defendants no matter what.\nMR. ESTRADA: That's correct on both counts,\nbut that's -- but that I -- you know, it sort of assumes\nthat the guidelines are systemically irrelevant in all\ncases, because after an -- after an appropriate\nanalysis -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, only in cases like\nthis, where we know they have to change because Congress\nhas directed they be changed.\nMR. ESTRADA: But, look -- I mean, one of\nthe interesting aspects about these cases is that one of\nthe Petitioners, for example, got the benefit of being\nsentenced at the time that the post-FSA guidelines, the\nnew emergency guidelines, provided a sentencing range of\nhim of 110 to 137. That's -- that's Mr. Hill. These\nare the new guidelines. He was sentenced to a mandatory\nminimum of 10, which is on -- on the lower end of that\nguideline.\nThe only reason that case is in the U.S.\nSupreme Court is because, even after the new statute,\nthe judge was of a mind that he wanted to use a\none-to-one ratio. And that's why there's a controversy\nhere. But the -- that highlights, you know, the point\nthat I'm trying to make and that the Court made in\nKimbrough, which is that the mandatory minimums tend to\nenforce a species of uniformity in a world in which the\nguidelines are advisory, and they do help uphold, you\nknow, the principle that people that committed\ncomparable offenses will have some rough comparability.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that begs the\nquestion -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But the problem with this -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- I started with, with\nyou, which is if we know that this new Congress has\nalready determined that those -- that mandatory minimum\nis discriminatory in the way that it had been\nconstructed, what would be the purpose of delaying\nimplementation?\nMR. ESTRADA: If Congress had made that\nfinding, Justice Sotomayor, I would fully expect them,\nas a citizen, to cut the sentences of everybody who is\nalready serving the sentence irrespective of finality.\nAnd the fact that Congress did not do that, which is a\nproposition on which everybody agrees, I think is\npowerful evidence that the assumption that this\nnecessarily reflects a conclusion that the previous\nsystem was indisputably discriminatory as opposed to\narguably discriminatory -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I would find that\nextraordinary, that they say it's racist, but we're\ngoing to leave in effect all of the sentences that have\npreviously been -- been imposed. That seems to me very\nunlikely.\nMr. Estrada, I would like you to explain the\neffect of 3553(a)(4)(A)(ii), which -- which does seem\nto -- to be sure, it's not in the new legislation, but\nit's the background against which the new legislation\nwas adopted, and it seems to require that -- that the\ncourt use the guidelines in effect at the time of\nsentencing.\nMR. ESTRADA: Right. This is a fight about\ncompeting background rules. Section 109 is one of them\nand it says the old law shall be applied to people who\ncommitted their offenses while the old law was in force.\nIt is a directly applicable statute to the situation at\nhand.\nThis purported competing background rule is\na rule that simply says a judge shall consider the\nguidelines then extant. And this is part of the advice\nthat he gets. It implies nothing about the duty to\napply -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose you're wrong about\nthat.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Estrada, you\ndon't -\nMR. ESTRADA: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose you're wrong about\nthat. I mean, I think when they -- they meant do it,\nthat considered. Does that change?\nMR. ESTRADA: I think it would be a radical\nunderstanding.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. I mean, I think that\nwhen they wrote 3553, they were thinking those were the\nguidelines that are going to apply. Do it. Now, I'll\nlook into that.\nBut if I -- if I reach the conclusion I\nagree competing background rules -\nMR. ESTRADA: Justice Breyer -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I agree applicable law\ndoesn't help us, because -- all the time, there are two\ndifferent sets of guidelines that apply depending upon\nwhen you committed the crime. That's very common. All\nright. So, I agree with you that far.\nBut now I'm worried about -- the last\nquestion Justice Scalia asked does, I think, focus this\nquestion, because we have not only 109; we have also\nthe -- the one we're talking about now, and that says,\nnormally, you will apply the guidelines in effect even\nto people who committed the crime before the new\nstatute.\nMR. ESTRADA: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And now, do we have any\nanalogies? Has this ever happened before? Is there --\nI can't find out how many people we're talking about.\nI'd like to know at least are there many other occasions\nwhen Congress amended mandatory minimums so there's some\nprecedent? Any?\nMR. ESTRADA: Justice Breyer, this is a\nstaple of what has happened in the lower courts in a\nroutine application of section 109.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. ESTRADA: My best example -- and please\ndo not think I'm pandering -- is a case called\nU.S. v. Smith from the Second Circuit, which -- which\nwas authored by then-Judge Sotomayor. And it was a\ncomparable case in which Congress had dropped the\nseverity of a penalty.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. ESTRADA: It had to be -- you know, the\npenalty that deals with supervised release.\nAnd Congress had gone from a world in which\na violation of supervised release had to be subject to a\nmandatory sentence, to a world in which the statute had\nbeen changed, to say that it was up in the discretion of\nthe judge. By the time the offender came to court, he\nhad violated his supervised release. And his argument,\nwhich was actually a lot more plausible than this one,\nwas that before he violated, the law had changed, and he\nwas now in effect now coming to the court for a new\nsentencing. Which is exactly analogous to this.\nThe Second Circuit had no trouble in saying\nthat a routine application of section 109 killed that\nclaim because the offense was considered completed at\nthe time it was committed; and, therefore, this was a -\na claim that simply was not tenable in light of the\nlanguage of section 109. And that, too, is a -- is a\ncase where somebody could have said the law that now\napplies is the one that applies to my new sentencing\nunder the new applicable guidelines.\nNow, I will say another two logical points\nabout, you know, the competing rule that the Government\nis urging.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Estrada, before you do,\nif I can understand your argument as it relates to\nJustice Scalia's questions -- I just want to make sure I\nunderstand it. There's a person who has 4.99 grams of\ncrack cocaine. And you do not dispute, do you, that\nthat person would be subject to the new guidelines,\nwhich are based on the 18-to-1 ratio rather than the\n100-to-1 ratio?\nMR. ESTRADA: I do not. And -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. So, you do not\ndispute that. So -- so, then we're living in a world in\nwhich the person who has 4.99 grams of cocaine is\ngetting the 18-to-1 ratio, and a person who has 5 grams\nis getting the 100-to-1 ratio that's embedded in the\nmandatory minimums.\nMR. ESTRADA: That is absolutely right, and\nthat was the -- the paradox, if you want to call it\nthat -- that the government brought you in Kimbrough.\nAnd the Court accepted that that was the case. It said,\nyes, this leads to cliffs. It leads to a lack of a\nstraight line in between all of the possible penalties.\nWe accept all of that. It is an artifact of the fact\nthat Congress at certain points, but not on a continuous\nline, has chosen to constrain sentencing discretion with\nthe rough tool of a quantity threshold.\nIt is all set out in the Kimbrough case.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Now, when Judge Easterbrook\ntalked about this anomaly -- and he, of course, adopted\nthe position that you adopted. But he just said, look,\nthere is no earthly reason for this. It's just that we\ncan't find a clear enough statement in the statute.\nI guess the question I would ask you is:\nCan you do better than Judge Easterbrook? Can you find\nan earthly reason for why Congress would have wanted to\ncreate this weird halfway system in which, if you have\n4-1/2 grams of cocaine, one rule applies, but if you\nhave 5 grams, another rule applies?\nMR. ESTRADA: I don't think that that's what\nhe found inexplicable. I think the -- you know, the\nwhole notion of changing it up to a point was more what\nhe's saying.\nI can think that Congress has at least the\nrational reason that the Court ascribed to the system in\nits post-Booker way at the top of page 108, I think, in\nthe Kimbrough case, where it is that now that we have a\nsystem in which so much depends on the discretion of the\nindividual sentencer, it is actually salutary to have a\nfew points of confluence that work as an enforced,\nalthough rough, uniformity in the sentences of\ncomparably situated offenders.\nIf I go back -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the Government is\narguing and the Petitioner is arguing for a uniform\nrule, the rule that the time of sentencing controls.\nMR. ESTRADA: Right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So that uniformity doesn't\nquite answer it, unless I misunderstood -\nMR. ESTRADA: No, I think that they are\ncompeting visions of fairness and of uniformity in this\ncase, Justice Kennedy. I am trying to hold, you know,\nthe Government to the one they had in the McNeill case\nlast year, because the identical argument was made to\nthem in the -- on the other side, that it was somewhat\nirrational to apply the better sentence to the person 1\nday later versus the person 1 day earlier.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But Justice Kagan's\nquestion concerning what interest is served by your\nposition has particular force when we're talking about\nthe sentencing judge. The hardest thing -- as we know\nin the judicial system, one of the hardest things is\nsentencing. And you're saying that a sentencing judge\nwho knows the law has been changed, who knows the law\nhas been criticized, is nevertheless bound to determine\nthat it's fair for this -- for this person to be\nsentenced to the longer term.\nThat's a very difficult -\nMR. ESTRADA: But if I could -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- position to put the\njudge in. Now, I would -\nMR. ESTRADA: If I could take the -- I'm\nsorry, Justice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Go ahead.\nMR. ESTRADA: If I could take, you know, the\nother side of that argument. One of the reasons why I\nthink, you know, the Court should accept that Congress\ncontemplated new guidelines but not necessarily take up,\nyou know, the Government's view that this is actually\ncalled for by the very end of that section, applicable\nlaw, is that the Government looks at this as a world in\nwhich Congress has now intervened and in effect\ncompelled a -- a more linear function of sentencing so\nthat, henceforth, I guess the Commission has to conform\nto the -- to the 18-to-1 ratio, and it would no longer\nbe open to the Commission, for example, to do what it\ndid in 2007, which is we changed our mind; there is a\nmandatory minimum that constrains us, but in light of\nthe most recent scholarship, we think the ratio should\nbe 16 to 1.\nAnd -- and one of the reasons why I am\nreluctant to urge you to accept, you know, the\nGovernment's construction, which I can see how they\nwould be helped by in future cases, is that I think it's\nvery implausible for Congress to have considered this,\nas they say, the centerpiece of the statute and have -\nhave it be the last depending clause of section 8.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Wait, wait. This is -\njust tell me if maybe the light is dawning, and maybe\nI'm just at the same question Justice Kagan asked.\nThink of before the statute. There were two sets of\npeople: Those people subject to the mandatory minimum\nand those crack people who -- the mandatory minimum\ndidn't matter, but the Commission wrote amendments\nconsistent with.\nSo, they were tough amendments, though the\nlaw didn't require it -\nMR. ESTRADA: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- to produce consistency.\nNow the statute's passed. Now we have some of the\npre-Act offenders. Because of the two sets of things,\nsection 8 on the one hand and the 3553(g) on the other,\nin respect to those people who were not governed by the\nmandatory minimum previously but were subject to the\nthen-conforming amendments, now will have to be subject\nto new conforming amendments that conform to the new\nthing.\nAnd that -- because that'll have to be\nbecause of the combination of the two sections that Mr.\nDreeben read, the -- all right. Now, if that's so, we\nget to the cliffs that Justice Kagan is talking about.\nAnd if I'm right so far, we're now back at the probation\nofficer example, and it's so odd and so peculiar that it\nis not just a fair -- do you see where I'm going?\nMR. ESTRADA: Frankly, no. But -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that too complicated?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't blame you, frankly.\nBut I -\nMR. ESTRADA: But let me -- let me say two\nthings -\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right.\nMR. ESTRADA: You know, the -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't blame you. I don't\nblame you.\nMR. ESTRADA: The simple point I was trying\nto make, Justice Breyer, is that the whole thing that\nthe guideline system now has to conform with applicable\nlaw, which, you know, the Government reads as the new\nratio and could extend to other things, could\npotentially disable the Commission from adopting its own\nameliorating amendments that depart from the regime\nof -- of the mandatory minimums. And so, whereas there\nare mandatory minima that are troublesome and give rise\nto cliffs, there are also occasions in which the\nCommission is able to do things that are not consistent\nwith the statute.\nLet me give one example that was mentioned\nby the Court in DePierre. As the statute was\ninterpreted in DePierre, cocaine base is cocaine base;\nit gets you a mandatory minimum if it's chemically\nbased. The Commission thinks that you only get the\nenhanced penalties if the cocaine base happens to be\ncrack.\nSimilarly, under the Neal case, you get to\nweigh the carrier medium for the LSD, but, you know, the\nCommission thinks that you give it a presumed weight\nthat is probably lower than the actual medium. In both\nof those cases, the Commission comes up with guidelines\nthat are lower than the methodology that is contemplated\nunder the statutory analysis.\nWere you to adopt the applicable law on the\nassumption that the Congress has now dictated that these\nthings have to line up and never to have cliffs again\nbecause they are bad, you could end up having untoward\nconsequences as to what it is that the Commission can do\nin the future in order to deal with other\ninequalities -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Estrada, I'm not\nsure I follow -\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- the question -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead, Justice\nSotomayor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure I follow\nyour example. I think that the guideline regulation is\nthat the guideline -- the Sentencing Commission always\nhas to be -- pass guidelines consistent with the\nmandatory minimum. And if the statute says that the\nmandatory minimum requires the -- the carrying medium to\nbe included, the guidelines can't change that. The\nmandatory minimum would apply.\nMR. ESTRADA: For -- for purposes of the\nmandatory minimum, but not for the sentences in between.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But defendant -- I don't\nknow that I know of one guideline scheme that changes\nwhatever Congress has statutorily required.\nMR. ESTRADA: I just gave you two examples:\nThe LSD guideline that was at issue in Neal and the\ncrack guideline that was not at issue but was discussed\nin connection with the statutory interpretation in -- in\nDePierre.\nYou know, my point -- I don't want to\noverstate the point. My point is there is reason to\nbelieve that Congress intended the new guidelines to be\navailable for new offenses. The fact that Congress gave\nemergency authority so that that would be possible makes\nperfect sense because in the absence of emergency\nauthority, the new guidelines would not -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no. You have to -\nwhat you're arguing is not that the guidelines would be\navailable for new offenses. What you're arguing is that\nthey would be available for everybody except the\ncliffhangers. That -- that's what you're arguing.\nMR. ESTRADA: Except for? I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Everyone but the\ncliffhangers, because, as Justice Breyer pointed out,\nthose people who were subject to the old guideline at a\nhigher rate above the minimum now have the benefit of a\nlower rate. And so, they're going to get sentenced to a\nlower amount because they're not bound by the mandatory\nminimum.\nMR. ESTRADA: But there are -- there are two\nalternative worlds after the FSA, Justice Sotomayor. In\nthe first one, guidelines don't change for 15 months.\nPeople who committed the crime after the FSA come to the\ncourt for sentencing 10 months later and they get the\nnew mandatory minimum, but it doesn't matter because the\nold guidelines are higher. It is possible that the\njudge would intervene and use Booker discretion, but not\nnecessarily so.\nAnd the alternative world which Congress did\ngive us is you change the guidelines as soon as you can;\nif you come to the bar of the court with a pre-FSA\noffense, it doesn't matter, because the new guidelines,\nlike every guidelines book since the beginning, say that\nif a mandatory minimum applies, that controls over the\nthen-current guidelines, which is one of the fundamental\nreasons why the alternative view of the world and the\nalternative rule of construction the Government proffers\nmakes no sense.\nAs a pure statutory construction matter and\nfor those members of the Court who give weight to\nlegislative history, I will point out that the emergency\nauthority section that the Government thinks is\ndispositive on this point was in every version of this\nbill -- Senate 1711, Senate 1383, you know, the House\nversions that they cite -- even when those statutes, as\nJustice Scalia pointed -- I'm sorry -- as Justice Alito\npointed out earlier, provided an effective date for the\nnew statute of 6 months hence. It is -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, along those lines,\ncould I -- could I ask you this question, which is\nintended to explore the -- the issue whether the\nargument about bringing the guidelines into consistency\nwith applicable law doesn't assume the answer that is -\nthat one attempts to get from it?\nSuppose the -- the Fair Sentencing Act said\nexpressly this applies only -- the new mandatory\nminimums apply only to post-Act offenders, but it also\ncontained a provision that says the Sentencing\nCommission has to bring the guidelines into consistency\nwith applicable law. I assume there what they would\nhave to do would be to say that the new guidelines apply\nonly to post-enactment offenders, so that the Fair\nSentencing Act would trump this previous provision in\nthe Sentencing Reform Act. Wouldn't that be correct?\nMR. ESTRADA: Correct. And I think that\nthat would be true here as well. And the reason why I\nwas highlighting the earlier bills is because each and\nevery one of them had the same, almost word for word,\n\"conform with applicable law\" emergency authority. All\nof them uniformly said the new mandatory minimums will\nnot apply for another 6 months after the enactment.\nAs a logical proposition, if Congress\nthought that the identical language made sense to bring\nthe guidelines into conformity with a law that would not\ntake into -- that would not kick in for another 6\nmonths, having it kick in sooner does not have any more\nlogical import in saying that, therefore, you know, the\nguidelines now mean that previous offenses get a\ndifferent sentence.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But could I understand what\nyou're saying, Mr. Estrada? Because if Justice Alito is\nright, then the new guidelines that the Sentencing\nCommission has in fact promulgated should not be being\napplied right now to those who committed crimes before\nthe enactment date. And that's not what's happening now\non the ground, is it?\nMR. ESTRADA: Justice Kagan, it is not\nhappening in that manner because the guidelines, every\nbook of the guidelines, I believe since 1987, which is\nthe first one, has had, like, 5G1.1, which says these\nare the guidelines, but 5G tells you if a mandatory\nminimum applies, for whatever reason, you apply that and\nthat becomes the mandatory sentence.\nAnd so, there has never been any reason to\nhave two sets of guidelines to account for cliffs or\nmandatory minimums, because every guidelines book has\nhad a built-in solution to that problem, which is we\nunderstand that there are cliffs, we understand that\nthere is a world of mandatory minimums; we can't fix\nthose, this is our guideline sentence. If somehow, for\nsome reason -- because it occurred, you know, before or\nwhatever -- there is a mandatory minimum that applies,\nthe guidelines say the mandatory minimum becomes the\nguideline sentence.\nSo, in that sense, a Congress that knew the\nlaw would understand that saying you have to have new\nguidelines had no logical force in saying that,\ntherefore, the effective date of mandatory minimums or\nany other factor that bore on the application of\nmandatory minimums would be changed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Estrada.\nMR. ESTRADA: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Eberhardt, you\nhave 3 minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN E. EBERHARDT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. EBERHARDT: Thank you,\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nObviously, this Court recognizes the\ndifficulty of those district court judges sitting and\nasking themselves: What do I do with this defendant as\nopposed to another defendant? And after listening to my\ncolleague, Mr. Estrada, I still have to ask the Court to\nconsider the question that the Court has been asking:\nWhat possible reason could Congress have to want a\ndistrict court judge to have to sit back, 5 years after\nthe date of enactment of the Fair Sentencing Act, and\nimpose mandatory minimums that everyone agrees at this\npoint are racially discriminatory?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, you could say\nthat about any statute that runs afoul of -- of section\n109. I mean, that's what section 109 says: Even though\nwe have decided that this old law is bad and the penalty\nshould be lesser, even though we've decided, when we do\nthat, you continue to apply the bad old penalty to\npeople who committed a crime before the amendment.\nIsn't that what 109 says?\nMR. EBERHARDT: It can be, but, as Justice\nSotomayor recognizes, there has never been a situation\nsuch as this basically in the history of criminal law\nand criminal law sentencing in our country.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'd imagine you'd find\ndisagreement with that. You know -- you know -- you\nknow if -- as a matter of fact, in the year that these\ntook effect, think of the sentences that were not\ngoverned by mandatory for crack, not governed by the\nmandatory minimum. Did the guidelines provide, let's\ncall it a low sentence, disproportionately low?\nMR. EBERHARDT: Congress ultimately felt\nthat they did, yes, because what they -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And did they change those\nnon-mandatory part when they wrote new ones?\nMR. EBERHARDT: The guidelines changed in\ndifferent respects with regard to different amounts.\nThe new -\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. I'll look it\nup. I'll look it up.\nMR. EBERHARDT: I suggest the Court -- we\nadmit that 109 has to be considered in the case, but I\nthink to find what was really meant by Congress, after\nthe Court looks to section 109, the Court does have to\nlook to the 3553 sentence -- or 3553 section, that makes\nit very plainly clear, ever since the Sentencing Reform\nAct, that the date of sentencing clearly is the\nimportant date, as opposed to the date of the commission\nof the crime.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All those arguments\nhave nothing to do with the provision about the\nSentencing Commission is supposed to act quickly or any\nof that, right?\nYour argument is what rational reason could\nCongress have had to -- given the urgency of the\nproblem, the seriousness, why wouldn't they have wanted\nthe provisions to apply as you urged they should?\nMR. EBERHARDT: But it goes hand-in-hand\nwith the mandate from the Sentencing Commission to put\nthe new guidelines in place as soon as practical, as\nwell as provisions of section 10.\nThank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Eberhardt.\nMr. Estrada, at the invitation of the Court,\nyou have briefed and argued this case as an amicus\ncuriae in support of the judgment below. You've ably\ndischarged that responsibility, for which the Court is\ngrateful.\n"
