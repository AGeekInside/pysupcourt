        "content": "(11:35 a.m.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We'll now -- we'll now hear\nargument in Rhines against Weber.\nMr. Lange. You may proceed, Mr. Lange.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERTO A. LANGE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. LANGE: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nStay and abeyance is the proper way to\nadminister the total exhaustion rule under the unique\nfacts of this case. Several Justices of this Court\nalready have endorsed stay and abeyance, and seven of the\neight circuit courts of appeals that have considered the\nissue have permitted stay and abeyance under similar\ncircumstances.\nSection 2254 and the decisions of this Court in\nGranberry v. Greer and Strickland v. Washington make clear\nthat exhaustion is not a jurisdictional requirement.\nDistrict courts have the inherent authority and the broad\ndiscretion to issue stays in cases that are within their\njurisdiction.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think that's unquestionable.\nThe -- the issue really is whether it's an abuse of that\ndiscretion to -- to grant a stay and abeyance when the --\nthe petitioner comes before the court for habeas without\nhaving exhausted in State court. I mean, that's the\nquestion. I think everybody will stipulate that there's\npower to -- to stay proceedings, but is it an abuse of\ndiscretion to do so in these circumstances given the\nstatute that -- that wants a 1-year, prompt resort to the\nFederal courts.\nMR. LANGE: Justice Scalia, I agree with your\nframing of the issue.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. LANGE: And I also believe that a stay under\nthese circumstances is appropriate under the statutes,\nsection 2254 and 2244, and is consistent with those\nstatutes. There is nothing, as Justice Souter noted in\nhis concurrence in Duncan v. Walker, that prohibits the --\nthe granting of a stay under circumstances such as these.\nIndeed --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, there's no -- there's no\nabuse of discretion here. Why? Because we have an\ninterest in having all of the claims exhausted? If -- if\nit's no more -- if it's as broad as that, then there's no\nAEDPA statute of limitations.\nMR. LANGE: No, Your Honor. I believe there is\nno abuse of the discretion here because if a stay had\nnot --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, why shouldn't -- why\nshouldn't the petitioner for habeas have to first go to\nthe State court and exhaust the State court claims? Here\nthat wasn't done. The petitioner eventually ended up in\nFederal court with a laundry list of 30-some unexhausted\nState claims, for goodness sakes. Why shouldn't those\nhave been presented in the first instance to the State\ncourt?\nMR. LANGE: Well, in an ideal world, they would\nbe presented in the first instance, but we're dealing with\na -- a world where 93 percent of petitioners are\nproceeding pro se. Your Honor, stay and abeyance does\nforce a petitioner to present unexhausted claims in State\ncourt --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: At the price of suspending the\n1-year statute of limitations that Congress thought was\ncentral to AEDPA.\nMR. LANGE: No, Your Honor. I do not see this\nas a suspension of the statute of limitations. Mr. Rhines\nmet the AEDPA statute of limitations. He filed when only,\nby the State's own admission, 8 to 14 days had run on his\n1-year AEDPA statute of limitations.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but it's a free ride if\nyou say -- so long as you get in within the 1-year period,\nthe court can then give you another 3 years or as long as\nthe court thinks is reasonable for you to go back and --\nand do what you were supposed to do before you arrived. I\nmean, that seems to me is a frustration of the 1-year\nstatute of limitations.\nMR. LANGE: I disagree that that is a free ride,\nand I do not see that as a frustration of the 1-year\nstatute of limitations when a petitioner has met the\n1-year statute of limitations.\nYour Honor --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But the petitioner --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the point --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- didn't go to the State\ncourt with this enormous laundry list of unexhausted\nclaims. I mean, what do we do to encourage the procedure\nto be followed? Congress did want all this compressed and\nthought people should apply first to State court and, when\nthose are exhausted, then within the time limit apply to\nFederal court. But this -- this scheme does something\nelse, it seems to me.\nMR. LANGE: Your Honor, Congress wanted to\ncompress certainly the time between exhaustion of the\nState remedies and the time when the petitioner came to\nFederal court. However, Congress gave unlimited tolling\nwhile there is any proceeding going in -- in State court.\nI -- I see this stay and abeyance as a procedure that gets\napplied somewhat infrequently and at the discretion of a\njudge to -- a district court judge to apply or not apply\nwhen it's appropriate to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there a difference --\nwould you say there's a difference between a case where\nthe petitioner comes into Federal court in the first\ninstance with this laundry list or as, if I recall\ncorrectly, this case, goes first to the State court and\nthen, when it's dismissed from the State court, comes to\nFederal court with the same basic list which has been\nexhausted, plus others which have not? Would you\ndistinguish the case on the propriety of stay and abeyance\nof passing up the State court, going to Federal court\nfirst, going to State court with your pro se petition\nraising a bunch of claims but not all of them, and then\ncoming to Federal court?\nMR. LANGE: I think it truly depends on the\ncircumstances which of those two hypotheticals present a\nmore compelling case for stay and abeyance. In Mr. Rhines\nsituation, he did go to State court first and exhausted\nthe vast majority of the 35 separate claims that he has\nraised.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How many -- how many were not\nexhausted of that -- that laundry list?\nMR. LANGE: The court -- or the State challenged\n12 of the claims as unexhausted. The district court found\neight of those claims to be unexhausted, Your Honor, and\nmade that finding after Mr. Rhines' 1-year AEDPA period\nhad run. The finding -- Mr. Rhines had filed in February\nof 2000 pro se. The district court's conclusion that he\nhad a mixed petition and that there were eight unexhausted\nclaims was made in July of 2002.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: 16 months.\nMR. LANGE: It's actually a little bit -- it's\nlonger than 16 months, Your Honor. The district court\nreferred to 16 months, but it's almost 2 and a half years,\nfrom February of 2000 to July of 2002, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: One of the problems is that\nthe statute encourages prompt resolution in -- in the\nFederal system as well, and under a stay and abey\nprocedure, you could have a district judge who lets the\nmatter sit for 9-10 months and all of a sudden issues a\nstay and abey. How are we going to control that?\nMR. LANGE: Your Honor, I think the alternative\nthat the State proposes presents an even more troubling\nillustration. A district court, of course, can proceed at\nits own -- at its own rate, grant a stay, grant the terms\nof the stay as it sees fit, and I believe that takes care\nof the consideration that -- that Your Honor's question\nindicated, Justice Kennedy.\nThe suggestion of the State sets up a situation\nwhere, according to the State, they want Rhines to purge\nhis -- his claim -- his petition of the unexhausted claims\nand proceed in State court at the same time, which is\nunseemly to have Mr. Rhines proceeding on 27 exhausted\nclaims in Federal court at the same time that he is\nproceeding on 8 claims in State court.\nNow, South Dakota is a little bit unique. It --\nit allows a second State habeas action. There's no time\nbar to a second State habeas action. In fact, the South\nDakota legislature has made a policy decision that\nindigent prisoners are entitled to representation of\ncounsel in their first habeas.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, so then he's protected\nin the State system, and if he needs Federal review, he\ncan come here on direct.\nMR. LANGE: Your Honor, the problem is the eight\nclaims that he is now exhausting in State court, if the\nState's approach is taken, he forever sacrifices, loses\nthe right to Federal review of those eight claims.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No. He can come to -- here --\nthis Court on direct review.\nMR. LANGE: Excuse me. Under direct review?\nIs --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: He can come to this Court on\ncertiorari after the State decision in the second -- in\nthe second habeas.\nMR. LANGE: Your Honor, as a matter of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's fair for you to say he\nloses his right to Federal review --\nMR. LANGE: Right. Your --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- because we wouldn't\nnecessarily take that case, whereas you say he'd have a\nright to go into Federal -- Federal habeas. So --\nMR. LANGE: Thank you for throwing me the life\npreserver. I --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. LANGE: I understand this Court grants fewer\nthan 1 percent of the cases, so as a practical matter, for\nthere to be an independent review, as contemplated by\nsection 2254(a), it does require a district court's\ninvolvement. As a practical matter, this Court on -- on\ncert can't be expected to -- to conduct that review.\n2254(a), which is the statute that grants\njurisdiction, does indicate that a Federal court shall\nentertain causes of this action. Now, 2254(b) does\ncontain the exhaustion requirement in (b)(1) and makes\nclear in (b)(2) and (b)(3) that it is not jurisdictional.\nThe -- the irony --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Would we have to -- would we\nhave to reverse in part Rose against Lundy to go with your\nview?\nMR. LANGE: I don't believe so anymore than you\nwould have to reverse in part Rose v. Lundy to go with the\nState's view. And let me explain.\nThe approach of stay and abeyance is more\nconsistent with the principles of Rose v. Lundy than the\n-- than the State's position. In Rose, this Court was\nconcerned about comity and federalism. It -- it serves\nthe interests of comity and federalism for a Federal court\nto suspend consideration of a Federal habeas case while a\npetitioner has a remedy and is actually pursuing it in\nState court. The petitioner may be granted the remedy in\nState court, which in turn would render the Federal\npetition moot altogether. There could be, between the\ncompeting State and Federal cases, competition for the\ntranscript or even the exhibits.\nRose v. Lundy also contemplated a process that\nwould not unreasonably impair the petitioner's right and\nwould give the petitioner the choice of either purging the\nunexhausted claims or going back to State court,\nexhausting the claims, and then coming back to Federal\ncourt with one fully exhausted --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, that was at a time\nbefore the AEDPA enactment that tried to put limits, time\nlimits, on these things.\nMR. LANGE: The only --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: That's what we run into here,\nis a total frustration almost of Congress' time limiting.\nMR. LANGE: Your Honor, I -- I would disagree\nthat this is a total frustration of Congress' time\nlimiting -- time limiting. Again, Congress granted\nunlimited tolling while a petitioner is pursuing remedies\nin State court. Congress was not attempting to frustrate\nor impede the petitioner's right to seek State court\nrelief or --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, but Congress, I think\nunder this scheme, envisioned having someone make all the\nState claims the first time around, gather them up and go\nto State court, and let them take as long as they like --\nno statute will run until that's complete -- and then go\nto the Federal court. And this does an end run around\nthat approach.\nMR. LANGE: Your Honor, I don't believe this\ndoes an end run because this is different than -- than\ntolling. First of all, in tolling it's automatic under a\nstatute, and stay and abeyance is always discretionary\nwith the court. The court can grant or deny the stay and\nabeyance order, alter it, revoke it, or in this case, put\ntime limits on the petitioner's right to go back and --\nand forth.\nAlso, Mr. Rhines has complied with the AEDPA\nperiod. He did file.\nThe unusual situation that could result here is\nif you assume a prisoner B who's in Rhines' same position\nand files at the same time, when only approximately 9 days\nhave elapsed on his AEDPA period. Petitioner B, let's\nassume, files three claims: one exhausted, one\nunexhausted, and one there's a dispute over whether it's\nexhausted or not. Because petitioner B had a short trial\nperhaps or draws a different judge in the District of\nSouth Dakota, the judge can rule on that case perhaps\nwithin 100 days. It gives petitioner B, under my\nscenario, 256 days to go to State court, exhaust his\nclaims, and then come back into Federal court with one\nfully exhausted petition.\nRhines would be in the position of prisoner B in\nmy scenario but for the fact that his claims are -- are\nmuch more complicated. He is serving a -- a sentence of\ndeath. He did have a long trial. And under that\nsituation, it's simply unfair to someone in Rhines' place\nto have his right to a review of the eight unexhausted\nclaims cut short because he had a complicated case or the\ndistrict court was slow in getting to a decision.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that happens often with\ntime limits. I mean, it depends on when the court\nfinishes its job and so forth.\nWhat do you do about -- about our opinion in --\nin Duncan v. Walker where we refused to toll the\nlimitation period during the pendency of a -- of the\nFederal proceeding and -- and said, in -- in justification\nof that holding, by tolling the limitation period for the\npursuit of State remedies and not during the pendency of\napplications for Federal review, 2244 provides a powerful\nincentive for litigants to exhaust all available State\nremedies before proceeding in the lower Federal courts?\nYou are now urging us to eliminate that incentive\nentirely.\nMR. LANGE: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why not?\nMR. LANGE: I believe there's always a very\npowerful incentive to prisoners to exhaust in full because\nif they file a mixed petition, they're not going to have\nrelief.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Sometimes --\nMR. LANGE: (b)(1) says it shall not be granted.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you said -- you said in\nyour brief that -- that it's always in the -- with the\npossible exception of capital cases, it's always in the\ninterest of a habeas applicant to get -- get it decided as\nsoon as possible. That's not really true. Sometimes it's\n-- it's in his interest to delay it as much as possible.\nWitnesses will die. People will move away. All sorts of\n-- there are all sorts of reasons why he -- he might want\nto delay the process.\nMR. LANGE: I think those illustrations are --\nare the -- very much the exception rather than the rule,\nas this Court recognized in --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what about the\nexceptional case? I mean, how do we avoid the exceptional\ncase?\nMR. LANGE: Well, I think that's then the\ndistrict court's task that has more familiarity with the\nparticular case.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Which can do what?\nMR. LANGE: The district court can refuse to\nissue a stay and abeyance order. It can put tight\ndeadlines on a stay and abeyance order. The district\ncourt can revoke a stay and abeyance order. It can alter\nit if there is delay. I believe that is a decision that\nshould be left to the court that's closest to the facts,\nthe district court.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think the procedure\nshould be any different between capital cases and\nnoncapital cases? We're basically talking about what\nwould be an abuse of discretion, as you indicated at the\noutset. Do you think the same rule should apply to both,\nor do you think there might be -- because there is a\ngreater incentive to delay in the capital case than there\nis in the noncapital case.\nMR. LANGE: You're right, Justice Stevens. I --\nit's difficult to develop a rule that distinguishes\nbetween the two classes, but I do believe that's in the\nrealm of the discretion of the district court. The\ndistrict court can set very tight deadlines on a\npetitioner returning to State court to exhaust remaining\nremedies like the Court here set a deadline of 60 days,\nand in the circuit courts, more commonly the deadline is\n30 days to go back to State court and then 30 days to\nreturn once the State proceeding is -- is completed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you -- you don't really\nthink we can hold that line, giving less favorable\ntreatment to somebody who's -- who's trying to argue\nagainst a capital penalty, less favorable treatment to him\nthan somebody who's -- who just wants to avoid 10 years in\njail? That's just not going to work.\nMR. LANGE: I'm not advocating less favorable\ntreatment or more favorable treatment for that matter. I\nbelieve the rule has to be consistent between the two.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Could you just replay the\norder of the proceedings? The first petition is to the\nState court. Was the defendant in that first State habeas\nrepresented by counsel?\nMR. LANGE: Yes, he was, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So he's been represented by\ncounsel throughout.\nMR. LANGE: Well, he filed his Federal habeas\npetition pro se. The counsel was appointed shortly\nafterwards, yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the -- the State\napplication that preceded that -- he was represented\nthere.\nMR. LANGE: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And then he lost his\nrepresentation when he came to the Federal court?\nMR. LANGE: Justice Ginsburg, a different lawyer\ngets appointed in the Federal court system than\nrepresented him in the -- in the State court system.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How -- how general is -- is\nthis problem? And -- and to what extent is it tied to the\nfact that you can bring a second habeas in South Dakota?\nI mean, in -- in most States, if this had happened, I\npresume, when you went back to the State court, the State\ncourt would say, you know, you didn't -- you didn't put in\nthese claims the last time around and they're procedurally\nbarred. Isn't that what would happen in -- in most other\nStates?\nMR. LANGE: I think that's an excellent point\nand on footnotes 9 and 10 of the yellow brief, there is a\nlitany of the State procedural rules, and many States\nwould bar a second habeas or would put a strict time limit\nthat the petitioner could not meet. South Dakota is\ndifferent in that regard.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. LANGE: South Dakota allows a second habeas\nand, indeed, allows a petitioner in a second habeas to\nshow cause for a default by proving that he received\nineffective assistance of habeas counsel, which is unique\namong the States.\nYes, many States that don't allow a second\nremedy would -- would not -- we would not be in this\nsituation that we are here. However, South Dakota does.\nAnd in fairness to Mr. Rhines, it makes sense to stay the\nFederal petition and to allow him to exhaust his State\ncourt remedies on satisfaction of Rose and to come back\nwith a fully exhausted claim.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Unless what would happen in\nthese other States as the -- is that the court would grant\nthe -- the stay of proceedings in order to let him go back\nto the State court and be told after however long it takes\nthat -- that his -- his claims are now procedurally\nbarred. Do you think the Federal court would simply make\nits own determination that the claims would be rejected by\nthe State court and therefore it would not stay? I don't\nknow.\nMR. LANGE: I -- I believe that would -- could\nbe and -- and should be a factor in a district court's\nconsideration of whether to grant stay and abeyance, Your\nHonor.\nThe State has expressed concerns about delay.\nThere are four reasons why those concerns are overstated.\nFirst, in the 3 and a half years since Duncan v.\nWalker was decided, there have been cases in circuit\ncourts of appeals that have approved of the stay and\nabeyance procedure. None of those cases evidence that it\nis being misused or is causing undue delay.\nSecond, the terms of the stay themselves can\nrestrict a petitioner's delay, as I've already recounted\nthe -- the district court did here.\nThird, this Court in Slack v. McDaniel addressed\nvery similar arguments to what the State is making now\nabout delay through a second habeas filing. And this --\nthis Court noted that the Rules of Civil Procedure vest\ncourts with flexibility to prevent vexatious or delayed\nlitigation and that there are other reasons why those\nconcerns expressed in Slack v. McDaniel were -- were\noverwrought.\nFourth and finally, on the prospect of delay, as\nalready mentioned in answer to one of Justice Scalia's\nquestions, the vast majority of petitioners are not under\na capital sentence. It is not hyperbole to say that 99.4\npercent of Federal section 2254 habeas petitioners are not\nserving -- are not under a capital penalty. Those are\nstatistics from the year 2000 from the Department of\nJustice. And those, I think with the extremely rare\nexception, are people who believe rightly or wrongly that\nthey're in prison because their constitutional rights have\nbeen violated and would not favor delay under any\ncircumstance. So the delay concern that the State raises\nis -- is overwrought.\nUnless there are other questions, I'd reserve my\nremaining time for rebuttal.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Lang.\nGeneral Long, we'll hear from you, please.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE E. LONG\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. LONG: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nCongress -- excuse me. Congress carefully\ncrafted a scheme designed to encourage State prisoners\nfirst to exhaust all of their State post-conviction\nremedies and then to file their habeas corpus petitions as\nsoon as possible. The congressional design includes three\nmutually dependent statutes, including a 1-year statute of\nlimitations, a tolling provision, and a total exhaustion\nrequirement, the combined effect of which is supposed to\nreduce delay, serve the principles of comity, finality,\nand federalism.\nHowever, stay and abeyance erodes each side of\nthis triangular statutory design. Stay and abeyance\nallows tolling in Federal court when Duncan said there\nshould be none. It extends the statute of limitations\nbeyond 1 year, and it ignores the total exhaustion\nrequirement of 2254(b). The result is that State\nprisoners, especially capital prisoners, are encouraged to\nfile mixed petitions and rewarded with delay if they do\nso.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what is your answer to\n-- to your -- your brother's answer on this, and -- and\nthat is, that the -- the existence of stay and abey as a\npossibility is not a right to stay and abey? And -- and\nif a district judge finds that a -- there is reason to\nbelieve that the defendant is gaming the system, because\nhe's a capital defendant and wants to delay or wants delay\nfor any other reason, there's -- there's no requirement\nthat -- that there be a stay and -- and abeyance order.\nAnd why -- why doesn't that take care of what I -- I think\nis a very legitimate issue that you raise? Why isn't that\na -- a sufficient answer to it?\nMR. LONG: I think that -- I think that the --\nthe answer is that Congress designed the system to resolve\nall those issues in State court first. I think one of the\nthings that needs to be kept in mind is that an\nunexhausted claim is, by its very nature and by\ndefinition, a claim where there's an available remedy in\nState court.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, again, there's no question\nabout that. And -- and in a perfect -- sort of in a\nperfect system, I think your objection would be\nunanswerable.\nThe trouble with the system we've got is -- is\nthe trouble that -- that is -- is undisputed here, and\nthat is, that most of these petitions, the overwhelming\nnumber of them, are going to be pro se petitions.\nExhaustion can -- can be tricky. The -- the statute of\nlimitations is -- is going to run and -- and an individual\ncan end up in the -- in the situation that this one had.\nWhat -- what he's asking for, in effect, is how\ndo we tinker with the system, in effect, to prevent its\nbeing a -- a very unfair burden on people who don't have\nthe sophistication to help themselves.\nMR. LONG: I don't think the system needs to be\ntinkered with, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I -- I know but there's\n-- what -- what is your answer on the merits to the fact\nthat most of the people who are going to ask for stay and\nabey are -- are going to be pro ses, or at least have\ngotten into the mess that they're in as a result of pro se\nrepresentation, and -- and that -- that exhaustion in\nclose cases can be a very -- very tricky issue? What --\nwhat's your response to that?\nMR. LONG: My response is in two parts. First\nof all, Your Honor, I agree with you that exhaustion can\nbe a tricky issue, but it's -- it's the most tricky in the\nquestion about whether or not the question has been fairly\npresented. The less tricky portion of the question is\nwhether or not the claim is unexhausted, having been --\nthat means there's an available remedy in State court.\nThe easy way to sort that out is just to file your claim\nin State court. If there is in fact an available remedy,\nthen you get tolling, and that solves the problem. I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure -- I'm not sure\nit's -- it's true, are you, that -- that the reason people\nget into these situations is because they were pro se.\nThat wasn't the case here. I -- I think they probably get\ninto this situation very often because they have a better\nor at least a different lawyer at the Federal habeas stage\nthan they had at the State habeas stage, and this new\nlawyer sees additional claims that -- that he wants to\nmake. Isn't -- isn't that exactly what happened here?\nMR. LONG: That's -- I -- I suspect that's the\ntypical case in -- in capital cases. Mr. Rhines is\ncurrently --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's typical. I mean, what I\nhave in the statistics is that about 36 percent of all the\nhabeases are dismissed for failure to exhaust, and 93\npercent of all of the habeas petitioners are pro se. Now,\nthe conclusions I draw for that is it's probably these pro\nse people -- I mean, 93 percent are pro se -- that will get\nthe procedural dismissals, and certainly a third or so, if\nwe agree with you, of all of the habeas petitions filed\nin -- in Federal court are going to be finished,\nterminated. The door is closed because it takes a Federal\ncourt about nine months on average to process a habeas.\nNow, you just take that and you say, we've\nclosed the door of the Federal court to a third of all the\nhabeas petitioners. And if I had thought that Congress\nwanted that, then I might say fine.\nBut I thought that Duncan -- and I know I was on\nthe other side of the case, but I felt the majority had a\npretty good point on the language, to tell you the truth.\nBut what I didn't think they had such a -- I mean, I\ncouldn't find much of a congressional purpose one way or\nthe other there. I thought the purpose of the statute of\nlimitations is really to get people to file their\npetitions. Once they file them, they have a year but it's\ntolled. You know, I mean, you understand the thing.\nI -- I'm really looking for you to tell me some\ntremendously strong congressional purpose that's served so\nstrong that you want to knock a third of the petitioners\nout of Federal court forever.\nMR. LONG: I think it's less complicated than\nthat, Your Honor. I think that it --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's pretty simple.\nMR. LONG: I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The door is closed forever. I\nmean --\nMR. LONG: I disagree. I disagree with you,\nJustice Breyer. I -- I think that even for a pro se\npetitioner, I do not think it is more difficult for him to\nfind the door of the State courthouse than it is to find\nthe door of the Federal courthouse. And the key, I think,\nto your argument is that claims are unexhausted by\ndefinition if there's an available State court remedy.\nTherefore, by definition, they ought to be going to the\nState courthouse rather than the Federal courthouse.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They seem to have made a\nmistake here quite a lot. Why do these statistics come\nout the way they do? I mean, it is just as easy.\nMR. LONG: I -- I can't --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I agree with you. Why -- why\naren't they filing -- why -- why are they all filing so\nmany, 36 percent filing in the wrong court? Why is that?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You know, it -- it could be, I\nsuppose, that these people have nothing else to do sitting\naround in the jailhouse, and -- and having written their\nState petition, they sit around for a few more months and\nthey say, you know, there are a few more claims I could\nmake. I think that's -- it's as simply as that.\nAnd -- and what the statute is designed to do, I\n-- I think you're telling us, is to say, look it, be\ncareful. Make all your claims in the State court the\nfirst time. That doesn't seem to me to be too much to\ndemand.\nMR. LONG: Justice Scalia, I think that's\nexactly what the statute -- the statutes -- the three read\ntogether and enforced together --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But they're all --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I take it -- I take it that\none of the answers to the observation that the Federal\ncourt is closed to a third of the claims is that that's\nnot true with respect to the exhausted claims. The -- the\npetition can simply be purged as to unexhausted claims and\nas to the exhausted claims, the courthouse door remains\nopen.\nMR. LONG: Well, I agree with that. The --\nlet's -- let's deal with the facts in this case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you --\nMR. LONG: Please.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- with respect to this case?\nI thought this case was such a good illustration of the\nproblem. If claims came into the Federal court neatly\nlabeled, exhausted, unexhausted, then I think that you\nwould have a very strong argument. But as this case\nillustrates, the question of whether it's been exhausted\nor not is something on which people can disagree. And I\nsuppose why the district court took well over a year to\ndecide this case is the petitioner says, I've exhausted\neverything, and the prosecutor says, you have not\nexhausted 12. And the district court is going by the --\ngoing over these one by one and says in the end, you're\nboth wrong. My list is eight. And it's that problem of\nhas this claim been exhausted.\nNow, if it was a case of deliberately\nwithholding a case from State court and bringing it up\nfresh in -- in the Federal court, that would be a case\nwhere the Federal court should say, go away, you didn't\neven try. But what do you do with these cases where it's\nreally hard to tell whether the claim has been exhausted?\nMR. LONG: That was not the situation in this\ncase, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then why did the -- the\ndistrict judge says four on the State's list have been\nexhausted?\nMR. LONG: Well, the -- factually the court --\nthe court examined the amended petition and concluded that\neight claims in the amended petition were unexhausted.\nThe problem is this -- or -- or at least the variance in\nthe facts from what you suggest is this. Mr. Rhines filed\nan amended petition in November of 2000 with counsel,\nafter having been through all the record. He admitted in\nhis amended petition that four of the claims were\nunexhausted. He still had 80 days left to run on the\nstatute of limitations. So he conceded in his amended\npetition in Federal court that he still had 80 days to run\n-- while there was still 80 days to run on the statute of\nlimitation, that four of the claims he submitted in the\npetition were unexhausted. That's not difficult to sort\nout because defense counsel admitted it, as he pled them.\nAnd so there isn't tricky question about whether there\nwere unexhausted claims in this petition.\nNow, that was in November of 2000. He waited\nuntil the court decided the decision in July of 2002 and\ndidn't pursue his State court remedies until the court\nordered him to do that in July of 2002. And he filed his\nState habeas to exhaust those admittedly unexhausted\nclaims.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So that -- that would take\ncare of the four claims. How about the other four?\nMR. LONG: Well, it doesn't make any difference\nat that point, Your Honor. If there's a single, solitary\nunexhausted claim, the problem --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, they --\nMR. LONG: -- is not -- is not worse if there\ngets to be 12 or 15.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But those could be -- those\ncould be dropped out of the Federal complaint. There\nyou're saying, district judge, you would be abusing your\ndiscretion because admitting that he hadn't exhausted\nthese, he should have gone immediately to do that.\nBut what about the other four?\nMR. LONG: Well, if he -- if he goes within the\n80 days and immediately files to pursue in State court his\nunexhausted claims, the statute is tolled. He doesn't\nlose the statute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even without going back to the\nState court, I don't see anything in this statute which\nindicates that Congress expected everybody who comes into\nFederal court with unexhausted claims to have time to\nremedy that defect by running back to State court and --\nand filing. This statute doesn't give any such\nindication.\nAnd it's clear that will never happen if he\nfiles on the 364th day after the conclusion of the State\nproceedings. Right? I mean, his year is up already.\nEven if the judge decides the question the next morning,\nit's too late.\nSo I -- I don't know why we have to be concerned\nabout giving him some entitled second chance to go back to\n-- to State court. I don't see anything in the statute\nthat -- that guarantees or that even envisions that. And\nI -- I --\nMR. LONG: I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I don't agree with that you\nwere saying or you do agree with that, I know.\nThe -- but the -- the question that I would have\nis, is there anything the other way? I mean, in Duncan,\nyou know, I was dissenting and the thing that sort of\nmoved me is I couldn't imagine Congress really cared about\nthis. I mean, what they do is they want to have you file\nwithin a year. And they say, well, but if you filed\nwithin a year and you're in State court, we don't care\nanymore. You're being -- if you file in the wrong State\ncourt, you're tolled. We don't really care once you're\nproceeding. And now, however, if you go in -- into\nFederal court by mistake instead of State court by\nmistake, well, you're out of luck on a random basis. Some\njudges will get you back in on time. Other judges won't.\nIs there anything in the history or anywhere --\nI -- I'm interested in the history from your point of\nview, as much as the other. Is there anything that\nsuggests that Congress cared about that?\nMR. LONG: Not that I've found, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Either way.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If that's so, then why isn't\na system like the one that the Second Circuit described\nthe most reasonable thing to do, that is, to put very\ntight deadlines both on the petitioner and on the Federal\ncourt, that is, to deny -- deny the stay and abey when the\nprisoner has not been diligent, to put a tight time line\non when that prisoner has to go to State court, and a\nsimilarly tight line on returning to the Federal court\nafter the State court is done? And you could check\nagainst repeatedly abusing this by saying, and you get\nonly one opportunity to do it.\nMR. LONG: I think the answer to the question,\nYour Honor, is that in order to follow the Second Circuit\nas you've described, this Court would have to rewrite the\ninterpretation of the exhaustion statute that they issued\nin Rose v. Lundy. That's my belief because Rose v. Lundy\n-- or the statute, as interpreted by Rose v. Lundy\nindicates that at a minimum, the unexhausted claims ought\nto be dismissed without prejudice and sent back for\nexhaustion in State court.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But Rose and Lundy also assumed\nthat they could go back to State court and -- and in -- in\nfact this could be done without wiping out the claims.\nAnd the difference between the situation in Rose and Lundy\nand the situation we've got now is the difference which is\nfocused, I think, in -- in Justice Ginsburg's four claims\nas to which there was disagreement even between the\ndistrict court and -- and the State as to whether there\nwas exhaustion. There -- there isn't a -- a -- as a -- as\na systemic matter across the United States, there simply\nisn't a way for most of these people to go back and\nlitigate their State claims. Rose and Lundy assumed there\nwas. Now there isn't.\nMR. LONG: Your Honor, if the petitioner is not\ncapable of going back to litigate the State claim, the\nclaim is not unexhausted by definition. And --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It may not be -- it -- it will\nbe waived. I mean, if -- if -- on your theory, he -- he\njumps from the frying pan of nonexhaustion into the fire\nof waiver. That's -- that's no answer to the problem.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: See, you could -- there are\ntwo things in Rose v. Lundy, and everybody agrees with the\none, you must exhaust in State court. You cannot have the\nFederal court take a first view of that question. You --\nyou must exhaust. And -- but then Rose v. Lundy also said\nwithout prejudice, and your reading strikes out without\nprejudice not based on the defendant's conduct, not based\non the petitioner's conduct, but because it took the\ndistrict court more than the limitation period just to\nsort out which claims were exhausted and which weren't.\nMR. LONG: I think there are two responses to\nthat, Your Honor. First of all, the -- the fact of\nwhether it is without prejudice in fact or in law is\ndriven by how much time is left on the statute of\nlimitations. A dismissal without prejudice at the time\nthe amended petition was filed in this case would have\nleft 80 days on the statute and he could have pursued his\n-- his remedy in State court and tolled the statute.\nNow, in the -- in the more common situation with\nthe habeas petitioner, I think the answer has to be\nCongress has changed the landscape. They have changed the\nlandscape relying upon the total exhaustion rule in --\nthat they enacted and that this Court has interpreted.\nAnd they have added the statute of limitations and they've\nadded the tolling provisions, and that has to be entered\ninto the computation.\nNow, I think that that simply raises the bar for\nall petitioners to make doubly sure that if they have a\nclaim, they have presented it to a State court judge\nbecause they -- they --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the -- the troublesome\nthing is some petitioners will be able to do just what you\nsaid in South Dakota, go back to the State court a second\ntime, because they had a swift district judge, and some\nwon't because the district judge was slow. So to treat\nidentically situated petitioners differently not because\nof any lapse on the petitioner's part but solely because\none had the luck to get before a swift district judge and\nthe other, the bad luck to get before a procrastinator,\nthat seems arbitrary and not anything that Congress built\ninto the statute.\nMR. LONG: Your Honor, I -- I struggle with the\n-- one of the premises of your hypothetical, and the\nportion I struggle with is the -- is the situation where\nthe petitioner, through no fault of his own, either -- and\nI think that's implied in your hypothetical -- doesn't go\nto State court. I -- I think that that is -- I think that\nthat's the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No, did go. Did. Every one\nof these cases, I say if they came rushing to the Federal\ncourt first, no Federal judge would even consider giving\nthem a stay so they can go to the first -- first time.\nBut these -- these come up where someone has\ngone to the State court and then they come to the Federal\ncourt with a new petition and there's arguments about what\nthey exhausted and what they didn't. I'm -- I'm leaving\nout the person who never went to the Federal -- State\ncourt at all. That person is -- is not the category that\nthis case represents. This case represents the one who\ngoes to State court and comes to the Federal court and\nhas arguably some additional claims.\nMR. LONG: The -- there's the -- the difficulty\nin the stay and abeyance procedure, as it is currently\npracticed, I think, is that there is no set of standards,\nother than the three statutes that we've -- that we have\ndiscussed, to guide the district court's discretion in\nwhen they give stay and abeyance.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: General Long, do -- do those\nStates that apply stay and abey make a distinction between\nwhether the person who comes with unexhausted claims has\nexhausted some claims in State court and ones who haven't?\nMR. LONG: Well, I think the predicate to\ngetting stay and abeyance, Your Honor, is that there has\nto be at least the presence of one exhausted claim and one\nunexhausted --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why should that be?\nMR. LONG: Well, I think that that follows from\n-- I think that follows from Rose v. Lundy which talked\nabout a mixed petition and that's the -- that's the\nfactual background.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If you get a second bite, why\nshouldn't you get a first bite? I mean, I -- I don't see\n-- I don't see any reason for treating preferentially the\n-- the person who files in State court but does not file\nnew claims, which he should have known to file at that\ntime, and treating the person who comes to the Federal\ncourt with those new claims but doesn't have -- doesn't\nhave even one that he took to State court. I -- I don't\nsee any reason to be merciful to one and not the other.\nMR. LONG: Well, I think the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you're -- but you're\ntelling me the States do draw a distinction.\nMR. LONG: Well, I don't think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean -- I mean --\nMR. LONG: -- it's not distinction. I'm sorry.\nThe Federal court --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, hasn't the second --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the difference is that one\nof those petitions could be totally dismissed and the\nother one would not be. If there were no exhaustion\nwhatsoever, they -- they'd plainly dismiss the Federal\ncase.\nMR. LONG: I think so, yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Whereas, if there's one\nexhausted claim, they could -- they could keep the Federal\n-- petition in Federal court and stay it and let the\nunexhausted claim be exhausted.\nMR. LONG: Well, that's -- that's the -- it's\nthe stay that we're having the problem with, Justice\nStevens. But -- but if there is the presence of one\nunexhausted claim, the -- the total exhaustion\nrequirement --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And the judge could dismiss\nthe others.\nMR. LONG: He -- he can dismiss the unexhausted\none and move forward. And -- and, of course, what has\nhappened in the -- since the -- the landscape has changed\nsince 1982 and because now the 1-year statute and the\ntolling provisions, there is more sanction for that\ndismissal under the total exhaustion requirement than\nthere used to be.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: General Long, if you were\ndesigning a system to set standards to guide the Federal\njudge in deciding how to treat these, what standards would\nyou set?\nMR. LONG: That's a hard question, Your Honor,\nbecause --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do your best.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. LONG: I -- I think this, Your Honor. I --\nI think the court, faced with a mixed petition, ought to\nfirst ask why have you not -- if -- if there is truly an\nunexhausted claim in this petition, why did you not\npresent that claim previously in State court. And after\nthat, if -- if the -- if the answer to that is not\nsatisfactory, I think that the -- I think that that ought\nto be tested on, for example, the cause and prejudice\nstandard or the actual innocence or fundamental\nmiscarriage of justice standards which this Court has\nannounced to cure procedural defaults in extreme cases.\nBut in the absence of those type of standards, I\nthink that stay and abeyance has been simply applied too\nbroadly and this case is a classic example of the\nmisapplication of stay and abeyance.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, are you suggesting then\nthat we could have a rule, oh, somewhat like the grant of\na preliminary injunction? If it's a likelihood of success\non the merits, if it's a fundamental right, if there's\nreason for maybe mistake and not having exhausted, then --\nthen you'd allow a stay and abeyance?\nMR. LONG: Well, I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Because if you have that, we\nthen have a new Gothic jurisprudence where we're reviewing\ndiscretion on a collateral issue.\nMR. LONG: Well, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Rococo I think.\nMR. LONG: Well, the -- the difficulty with the\nway it is now, Your Honor, is there is no review of the\ndiscretion of the district courts at all. I mean, they\nsimply do it, and --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I suppose the suggestion\nI made --\nMR. LONG: -- and it's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- is preferable than the one\nI gave. Would you adopt that or would you insist just\nthat there be no stay and abey at all?\nMR. LONG: Well, our first position, obviously,\nis no stay and abey at all, that the unexhausted claims\nought to be dismissed, as the Eighth Circuit said in this\ncase. And if they -- if they are truly unexhausted, then\nthere is going to be a remedy in State court, and State\ncourts are perfectly capable of identifying constitutional\nremedies and -- and meting out the requirements. I've had\n-- I've had South Dakota judges send murder cases back to\nme to try after 12 years, and it's -- it's a burdensome\nthing, and those cases need to move forward.\nBut what I would envision, Justice Kennedy, is\nthis, that the rule ought to be that -- that the -- the --\nthat the case is sent back to State court if there is\ntruly, as -- as the name implies, an unexhausted claim,\nimplying that there is an available State remedy. If --\nif resolution in the State courts does not resolve it, if\nthe case comes back in some fashion, then the court needs\nto apply some standards like cause and prejudice or\nfundamental miscarriage of justice, which -- which is what\nis applied in -- in procedural default cases, and -- and\ndeal with it on that basis.\nBut the -- the current lack of discretion with\nreference to how stay and abeyance is applied is in my\njudgment the -- that is the -- that is the most\nfundamental problem with --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But again --\nMR. LONG: -- stay and abeyances.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- I come -- I come back to\nthe -- the Second Circuit tried to deal with that problem\nand why isn't that adequate? They didn't leave the\ndistrict judges to do whatever was their will.\nMR. LONG: The -- well, the -- the Second\nCircuit followed very closely to what the -- what the\ndistrict court did here, Your Honor, but what I did not\nsee in the Second Circuit opinions and frankly haven't\nseen in any of the opinions except the Eighth Circuit\nopinion was any type of analysis about an explanation of\nwhy the petitioner hadn't been prudent and hadn't been\ndiligent in State court. And -- and in the absence of any\nkind of inquiry like that, I think that stay and abeyance\nsimply is -- is -- it's unguided. There are no standards.\nIf there are no questions, thank you very much.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, General Long.\nMr. Lange, you have 7 minutes left, and normally\nI wouldn't intrude on your rebuttal time, but I would like\nto ask you to comment on one thought.\nDo you think it would be appropriate before a\ndistrict judge ever grants a stay and -- and abeyance\nprocedure, to make some kind of a preliminary, not exactly\na probable cause determination, but some kind of a\ndetermination as to whether or not there is arguable merit\nto the State claim that he wants to stay the proceedings\nto -- to allow him to exhaust?\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERTO A. LANGE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. LANGE: Yes, I do, Justice Stevens. I\nbelieve that a district court, in evaluating a request for\nstay and abeyance, should look to make sure that the\npetition meets the standards of section 2254(b)(2) which\nis the provision that allows a district court to reach the\nmerits of unexhausted claims to deny them. It's similar\nto what the Court has now promulgated as rule 4 of the\nrules governing habeas corpus cases. I think it makes\nsense for the district court first to look at -- at\nwhether there's merit to the petition because there really\nis no sense to hold in abeyance, pending exhaustion in\nState court, claims that lack merit.\nObviously, to get stay and abeyance, the\npetitioner will have had to file timely within his AEDPA\nperiod, and the court will have had to have held the case\neither through the expiration of the AEDPA period or you\ncan imagine some scenarios where on the 364th day --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's one thing to say\nthat there's -- it's utterly without merit and he can deny\nit, which he's entitled to do under the statute. It's\nanother thing to say that there's a high probability of\nsuccess on the merits. I'm afraid that most of the claims\nare going to fall in between. The district judge just\ndoesn't know absent testimony, et cetera, et cetera.\nMR. LANGE: Right, and those should be\ncircumstances where the State court is left to judge\nwhether the claim has merit while the Federal court\nproceedings are suspended, are abeyed or held in abeyance.\nIt makes sense, under the exhaustion norms of this Court,\nto let the State courts pass judgment first on claims that\nhave sufficient merit where they can't be disposed of\nunder rule 4 of the rules governing habeas corpus.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. -- Mr. Lange, why -- why\nisn't -- gee, you have Lange and Long. Why isn't Attorney\nGeneral Long's assertion sensible? That is to say, it's\nan extraordinary thing to have Federal district courts in\nall criminal cases reviewing the work of State supreme\ncourts. We -- we got into this in an era when we couldn't\ntrust State supreme courts, especially in racial cases.\nBut that's where we are now.\nBut why is it unreasonable to say, look, you get\none shot at coming to Federal court? And if -- if you --\nif you bungle that and you haven't exhausted first, we're\nnot denying your claims. Go back to State court. We're\njust not going to reintervene as Federal courts. Your --\nyour claims are not dead. Justice is not denied. You\njust have to go back through the State system and we're\nnot going to blue pencil the work of the State system a\nsecond time. That's all. Why isn't that reasonable?\nMR. LANGE: Well, this is Mr. Rhines' one\nopportunity. Congress did give in section 2254(a)\njurisdiction to the courts and said the Federal courts\nshall entertain petitions of this -- of this nature. So\nthis is a -- a right that Mr. Rhines has to have these\nentertained. He filed timely.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, to have exhausted\nclaims entertained. Right? Is there some -- do you say\nthere is some absolute right to have the Federal court\nhear unexhausted claims?\nMR. LANGE: Well, under (b)(1), a claim must be\nexhausted to support relief from a Federal court. That is\nright, Your Honor. And these claims -- if under the\npetitioner B scenario, the court had ruled promptly or the\nclaims were less complex, allowing them to be disposed of\nearlier, Mr. Rhines could have had or -- and should have\nall of his claims before the district court to be\nresolved.\nThe Court needs to be watchful here not to\npenalize Mr. Rhines and people who are in similar\nsituations because they have complex claims.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, this is not a pro se\npetitioner.\nMR. LANGE: No. He is represented by counsel,\nobviously, Your Honor.\nI -- I think it inappropriate to draw lines\nbetween pro se and represented counsel, though, in the\nrealm of habeas. That I think invites trouble. So the\nrule you formulate is obviously not only for Rhines but\nfor pro se litigants as well that -- that deserve\nconsideration.\nThis exhaustion rule is not to be an -- a trap\nfor the unwary pro se petitioner. The whole purpose of\nthe exhaustion rule, as this Court said in Keeney v.\nTamayo-Reyes, is to -- not to erect a hurdle on the path\nto Federal habeas court, but to channel claims into an\nappropriate forum. And stay and abeyance does just that.\nIt prohibits further proceeding on a mixed petition in\nFederal court and channels, indeed requires, as a term of\nthe order that the petitioner go and exhaust the remaining\nState remedy and come back to court with one exhausted\nclaim. That is what Rose v. Lundy contemplated and\nallowed with the dismissal without prejudice.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Earlier you -- you suggested\nthat in your view the district court could deny it.\nMR. LANGE: If under section 2254(b)(2) it does\nnot meet the standard, yes. Congress has allowed, because\nexhaustion is not jurisdictional, for district courts to\nreach the merits, albeit to deny unexhausted claims.\nThat's --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Lange, you were appointed\nby the Court, and on behalf of the Court, I want to thank\nyou for your services and for the quality of your\nservices.\nMR. LANGE: Thank you.\n"
