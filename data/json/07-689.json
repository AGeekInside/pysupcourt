        "content": "(10:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear argument\nfirst this morning in Case 07-689, Bartlett v.\nStrickland.\nMr. Browning.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER G. BROWNING, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. BROWNING: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Voting Rights Act should be interpreted in\nsuch a way as to encourage a transition to a society\nwhere race no longer matters. In North Carolina,\ncoalition districts have been crucial in moving towards\nCongress's ultimate goal. Coalition districts bring\nraces together by fostering political alliances across\nracial lines. As a result they serve to diminish racial\npolarization over time. Coalition districts help us in\nreaching the point where race will no longer matter in\ndrawing district lines. These districts bring us one\nstep closer to fulfilling our Nation's moral and ethical\nobligation to create an integrated society.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How can you say that\nthis brings us closer to a situation where race will not\nmatter when it expands the number of situations in which\nredistricting authorities have to consider race?\nMR. BROWNING: Well, Your Honor,\nMr. Chief Justice, it will require somewhat an increase\nin the number of districts that would be drawn, there is\nno question about that, but that increase is not\nsubstantial. But it does cause race to be much less of\na factor in the redistricting process. Currently, if a\nGeneral Assembly has a choice between drawing a\ncoalition district or a majority-minority district, the\n50 percent rule that the North Carolina Supreme Court\nadopted encourages States to draw a majority-minority\ndistrict, and when you do that it causes race to re-\ndominate in the process.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me to be\na criticism of the majority-minority district approach\nin the first place.\nMR. BROWNING: Well, Your Honor, it is a\nrecognition of the fact that coalition districts allow\nus to move away from majority-minority districts and\ncreate districts where races are working together.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about influence\ndistricts?\nMR. BROWNING: Your Honor --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you move --\nyou've moved from majority-minority to crossover\ndistricts. Should you continue to move to so-called\ninfluence districts?\nMR. BROWNING: Your Honor, the decision in\nLULAC makes clear that influence districts are not\nprotected under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But under your definition\nof coalition district, race is the key factor.\nMR. BROWNING: Your Honor -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And you are telling us if\nwe have a rule that makes race the key factor then race\ndoesn't matter.\nMR. BROWNING: Your Honor, it is a matter of\n-- under the Voting Rights Act, Congress has made clear\nthat districts should be drawn to protect minority\nvoting rights. When there are areas of the country\nwhere there is racial polarization, districts -- race\nhas to be considered in drawing districts that will give\nminorities equal opportunity, just as majority --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought you were\nproposing a brave new world of coalition districts.\nMR. BROWNING: Your Honor, and race --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Based on race.\nMR. BROWNING: Justice Kennedy, you have to\nconsider race in drawing these districts. There's no\nquestion about that. That's the very thing that section\n2 of the Voting Rights Act requires us to do. And you\ndo that because there is racial polarization.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What's the authority that\nsays you must consider race in drawing the districts,\nassuming that you don't have an existing majority --\nminority-majority district? What's the -- what\nauthority do you cite for the fact that you must\nconsider race in drawing districts? What do I read to\nfind that?\nMR. BROWNING: Well, Your Honor, that's\ncertainly the decision in Thornburg v. Gingles. Under\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, that's -- that's a\nmajority -- majority district.\nMR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor. That was a\nmajority district. This Court --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay. So then what other\ncase do you have?\nMR. BROWNING: Your Honor, this Court, of\ncourse, has left open the issue of whether the Voting\nRights Act would protect minority --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then your statement\nthat you must always consider race in drawing districts\nis not -- is not supported, or at least it's a new\nproposition that you are arguing for us here.\nMR. BROWNING: Your Honor, my point is when\nyou are drawing districts under section 2, of course\nrace has to be considered, but it's considered because\nthe process is not equally open to minorities.\nUnfortunately, North Carolina has a long history of\ndiscrimination, and that discrimination has resulted in\ncurrent effects in the voting place. There is racially\npolarized voting, as has been stipulated to in this\ncase. There has been --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I would have\nthought the possibility of coalition districts would be\nevidence that the Voting Rights Act has succeeded,\nrather than evidence that you need to apply it more\nbroadly.\nMR. BROWNING: Mr. Chief Justice, the\ncoalition districts are certainly evidence that we have\nmade progress towards Congress's ultimate goal under the\nVoting Rights Act, but we are not there yet. In this\ndistrict, the expert testimony is that only 15 to 30\npercent of whites will vote for a black candidate, and\nthat is still very racially polarized. But coalition\ndistricts help us to move away. It -- they help to\ndiminish the amount of racial polarization over time, so\nthat eventually we won't need to be looking at race at\nall in drawing district lines, but where --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I mean, the\nobvious question when you say 15 to 30 percent is what\nnumber of crossover voters would you say demonstrates\nthat you no longer need to consider race in shifting a\ncoalition district?\nMR. BROWNING: Your Honor, in the Gingles\ncase, this Court stated that it was a district-by-\ndistrict determination. There's no bright-line rule as\nto where crossover voting is so great that it doesn't\nsatisfy the third Gingles prong. Here, however, the\ndistrict was --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, it could\nbe 70 percent that don't vote for a particular\ncandidate. At some point you have to conclude that it's\nbased on the candidate rather than on race.\nMR. BROWNING: Your Honor, at some point\nthat's true, that it would be issues beyond race, but\nhere, the expert report and as stipulated to by\nRespondents, this voting is racially polarized. There\nis some crossover voting, but not enough to say that the\neffects of past discrimination have been eliminated.\nThat crossover voting is sufficient for this district to\nwork.\nJUSTICE ALITO: You can't say where -- how\nmuch crossover voting would be so large as to make a\ndifference? You can't say where the line is\nstatistically?\nMR. BROWNING: Your Honor, this Court's,\nagain, decision in Gingles makes clear that that is a\ndistrict-by-district determination.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And that -- that has been\nstipulated here, right, that you meet the third Gingles\nfactor? So it's not at issue in this case, but the\npoint was made that, in one of the cases that you rely\non, in Metts, that reliance on crossovers to prove the\nability to elect the candidate of a racial minority's\nchoosing undercuts the argument that the majority votes\nas a bloc against the minority preferred candidates. So\nthere's tension between the crossovers on the one hand\nand showing that the dominant race votes as a bloc.\nMR. BROWNING: Justice Ginsburg, I\ncompletely agree that, at some point, the crossover\nvoting becomes so great that you no longer have to take\ninto account district lines. Unfortunately --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If that's the case, then --\nMR. BROWNING: -- we're not there yet.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If that's the case, then\nyour test imposes a statistical standard just as your\nopponent's test does, doesn't it? It's just a different\none.\nMR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor. What we're\nproposing and what we think is required by the text of\nsection 2 is you simply take the existing Gingles\nfactors and you look at the amount of racially polarized\nvoting, and from that you are able to readily calculate\nthe size of the minority group that would be\nsufficiently large to elect a minority -- a minority\ncandidate.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Suppose there is 40 percent\ncrossover voting, and that's a little bit -- that's not\nquite enough for the minority candidate to win.\nMR. BROWNING: Your Honor, again, whether\nthe third Gingles prong is satisfied obviously is a\ndistrict-by-district determination. Here, however --\nJUSTICE ALITO: We can't even say that 40\npercent would be sufficient in every instance, that that\nmight be -- you know, that might not be enough?\nMR. BROWNING: I'm hesitant since this Court\nhas not set a specific limit, and that's, again, an\nissue that has been stipulated to in this case. The --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you don't suggest\nthat if there were 40 percent white crossover voting, we\nwould find white bloc voting within the Gingles\ncondition, do you? Do you think that is a serious\npossibility?\nMR. BROWNING: No, I think it would be very,\nvery unrealistic that you'd have 40 percent --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but I mean you really\ndo have an answer to Justice Alito's question.\nMR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is the answer?\nWhat percentage of crossover voting would make this not\nactionable under section 2?\nMR. BROWNING: Again, the third prong is not\nan aspect of this case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you don't have an\nanswer to Justice Alito's question?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BROWNING: If you are saying that 40\npercent is a very high amount of crossover voting, that,\nof course, is not our case, where the crossover voting\nthat is necessary to make this coalition district work\nis 18 percent crossover voting.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have racially\npolarized voting when you have as high a crossover vote\nas 40 percent? I mean, you say, we apply the normal\nGingles factors, but it seems to me 40 percent crossover\nis fairly high.\nMR. BROWNING: 40 percent is a high number,\nand particularly --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you still think that we\ncan confidently say this is racially polarized?\nMR. BROWNING: Your Honor, here, however,\nunder this case, there's not 40 percent crossover --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you're opening\nyourself to this line of questioning about the third\nfactor, which is conceded by both sides, so it's not in\nissue. But you are opening it by having a test that\nlooks to the second and third factor and leaves the\nfirst factor out of it. I mean, whether you agree with\nit or not, the 50 percent line is bright if you know\nwhat's in and what's out. You don't have any test for\nthe first factor that's comparable, that would give\ndistrict courts and attorneys some degree of security\nabout how you determine the first factor.\nMR. BROWNING: Well, Your Honor, as the\nlanguage the Court used in the De Grandy decision is\nwhether the minority group is sufficiently large to\nelect a minority-preferred candidate. There are, of\ncourse, limiting factors on the side of the coalition\ndistrict which could be drawn. There are practical\nlimiting factors and there are legal limitations.\nThe practical limitation, of course, is in\nNorth Carolina, given what has happened in past\nelections, the North Carolina General Assembly\nappropriately concluded that a minority group of less\nthan 40 percent would simply not work, that it would not\nbe effective to give rise to a minority -- a district in\nwhich minorities elect a minority-preferred candidate.\nThere's also a legal limitation. In the\nCourt's decision in LULAC, the Court made clear that\ninfluence districts are not protected by section 2. So\nas a result, the minority group will by necessity have\nto control its coalition partner; otherwise it would\nsimply be an influence district. And here at a minority\ngroup of 40 percent, the minority group in the area is\nsubstantially larger than the crossover voting that is\nneeded to have an ability to elect.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under your theory,\nit would be possible to challenge a majority-minority\ndistrict on the ground that you could draw a different\ncoalition district, maybe more than one coalition\ndistrict. Let's put it that way.\nIf you could draw a majority-minority\ndistrict and you could draw two crossover districts,\ndoes the Voting Rights Act impose a limit on the choice?\nMR. BROWNING: Your Honor, our position is\nthat the -- assuming all of the factors under Gingles to\nbe met, that if you have a minority group that was\npacked in to a -- one district, and in its place two\ncoalition districts could be effectively drawn, and\nthose districts would actually work and you could meet\nall of the other standards under Gingles -- the district\nwas geographically compact, there is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's an easy -- I\nsuspect that's a common hypothetical. You could draw a\ndistrict with 80 percent minority voters or you could\nhave, as you have here, two 40 percent districts. And\nthe Voting Rights Act requires what?\nMR. BROWNING: In that situation, assuming\nyou could meet all of the Gingles factors, that, yes,\nthat 80 percent district should be drawn as two 40\npercent districts.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Aren't you adopting the\nprinciple of maximization?\nMR. BROWNING: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let me ask you this, and\ncorrect me if I am wrong, because it has been a long\ntime since Gingles came along and I may be forgetting\nthings. But I -- I thought when you are given the\nalternatives you were just giving, one 80 percent and\ntwo 40 percents, that because there is not a principle\nof maximization there simply is not an abstract or\nbright-line answer to the question; and that in order to\nget an answer to the question, you look at all of the\nother things that districting authorities look to, and\nyou see how they add up, whether we are talking about\ncompactness, congruency with -- with -- with other\npolitical lines, and so on. And unless you look to all\nthe other things that reasonably can and should be take\ninto consideration when districting is done, you simply\ncannot answer the question, should there be two 40's or\none 80.\nAm I wrong?\nMR. BROWNING: Well, Justice Souter,\ncertainly the -- the criteria that you have referred to\nhave to be part of the districting process.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But they weren't part of\nyour answer to the Chief Justice.\nMR. BROWNING: Well, my point is that when\nminorities are basically put in an enclave, in a\nseparate district but yet it is possible to draw two\ndistricts, two coalition districts, and the other prongs\nof Gingles have not been met, so that there is not rough\nproportionality throughout the State, yes, the\ndistricting body needs to consider drawing two\ndistricts --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It needs to consider it,\nbut I thought your answer was it needs to do it. Is\nthat your answer?\nMR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor, it would\nbe -- it is our answer that if a district -- if there is\nnot rough proportionality in a State, there is a\ndistrict that is a super-majority and there is no reason\nfor that super-majority to be in place.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay if there is no reason\nfor the super-majority. My point is that you cannot\nanswer the question in the abstract. And when you start\nto answer it, as you are doing now, you are going beyond\nthe abstract and you are getting into facts outside the\nmere choice between two 40's and one 80. And that seems\nto me to be correct. At least, if it's not correct, you\nand I are making the same mistake.\nMR. BROWNING: No, Justice Souter, your\npoint is well taken and I agree that with a hypothetical\nlike that it's very difficult, unless you are actually\nconsidering the specific situation of the district.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we -- what you\npropose is going to inject courts into the drawing of\ndistricts much more frequently than they -- than they\nalready are injected. The reality is that one of the\nfactors -- you mentioned contiguousness and county lines\nand so forth, but one of the factors that legislators\nalways take into account is incumbent protection and the\nincumbent is always going to rather be in an 80 percent\ndistrict than in a so-called 40 percent coalition\ndistrict.\nI think you are unrealistic to expect State\nlegislatures to draw districts that way, where everybody\nwill have a chance. The whole object of it is that\nnobody will have a chance, just the incumbents. That's\nwhat is going on.\nMR. BROWNING: Your Honor, I think what\nCongress has required courts to do is to look at the\noverall picture of the district. The Congress, in\nconnection with the section 2 of the Voting Rights Act,\nused very broad language, phrases like \"totality of\ncircumstances\" and \"opportunity to participate and\nelect.\" So clearly, Congress intended for a broad\napproach to be taken and a functional one.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's fine, but you\njust can't wave a magic wand. It -- Congress also\nintended primarily to leave it up to the legislatures\nunder guidelines, to be sure. And when you have a\nchoice of one 80 percent or two or even three 40\npercent, it's clear to me what the legislature is going\nto -- going to choose.\nMR. BROWNING: Well, Your Honor, and that's\nthe very point of the section 2 of the Voting Rights\nAct, is when minorities do not have equal opportunity to\nelect their candidate of choice, where they are packed\nin to districts --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We will be injected into\nthis very political game much more frequently than we\nnow are. I have always regarded the 50 percent Gingles\nthing as simply a self-protection prescription for the\ncourts, where you can look, you can be clear and say,\nyou know, close enough for government work.\nBut if you want us to figure out whether\nthere could be three districts, two districts instead of\njust one district, you are just, it seems to me, tossing\nthe whole -- the whole project of drawing districts into\nthe courts. And that is -- that is not something that\nI, for one, favor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In this case which way\ndoes the presumption favoring what the legislature did\ncut? Here the court set aside what the legislature did;\nis that not right?\nMR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor, the North\nCarolina Supreme Court determined that this district\nshould not cut county lines. Ironically, that county\nline was a county line that was originally created to\nsegregate blacks in Wilmington, in the southern portion\nof the county, from whites in the northern portion of\nthe county.\nSo that original discriminatory act is now\nbeing used to keep a district from -- from being a place\nthat is a district that has a proven ability to elect a\nminority --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's something new. I\nthought we took the case -- at least I have been\nthinking about the case -- on the assumption that there\nis a valid State law that is being superseded. Now, if\nyou are questioning the validity of the State law,\nthat's something -- that hasn't been raised here, has\nit?\nMR. BROWNING: Your Honor, the government\nhas asserted that there should be a near-50 percent test\nwhich includes as part of it a -- either the district is\nclose to 50 percent or there is an element of\ndiscrimination.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm talking about, you're\nindicating to us that the county line standard that the\nState court invoked as a matter of State law is itself\nquestionable because it was based on a prohibited racial\nanimus. And I -- I indicated that that's very new to\nme. I thought we were taking the case on the\nproposition that the county line rule is a neutral,\nvalid State law principle.\nNow, it may or may not be superseded by\nthe -- by the requirement of section 2. That's what we\nare arguing about. But this is the first time I have\nheard that we have to somehow question the underlying\nState rule under the Fourteenth Amendment.\nI thought we took the case on the assumption\nthat the State rule is valid.\nMR. BROWNING: Justice Kennedy, the decision\nof the North Carolina Supreme Court is to adopt an\ninflexible 50 percent rule. That -- that was the issue\nthat was resolved on summary judgment by the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm talking about the\ncounty line rule.\nMR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor, that the\ncounty line rule -- the North Carolina Supreme Court\nconcluded that this district could not cut county lines\nbecause this should not be treated as a section\n2 district.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We are fighting\nover -- the district that you want to draw, the\ncrossover district, would have 39 percent\nAfrican-American voters. The district that complied\nwith State law of the county line would have 35 percent.\nWhere the assumption is that you have a\nsignificant degree of crossover voting, is that really a\ndifference worth changing the Voting Rights Act\njurisprudence for?\nMR. BROWNING: Your Honor, the plaintiffs\nhave and the Respondent and the government have referred\nto an alternative district that would not cut those\ncounty lines and would have a black voting age\npopulation of 35 percent. The problem with that is\nthere is absolutely no testimony that that -- their\nalternative district would be in any way workable. As a\nmatter of fact, the undisputed testimony of the joint\nappendix at page 73-74 is to the contrary.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you mean by\n\"workable\"?\nMR. BROWNING: That this -- that the\ndistrict they propose was simply prepared by their\nattorney, looking at a map. There is absolutely no\ntestimony that this would be an effective minority\ndistrict, that there would be an equal opportunity for\nminorities --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because it's 4\npercent less than the district you propose?\nMR. BROWNING: Well, it is a matter of the\npercentage of voting age population, but more\nimportantly, the district they drew would have put a\nblack incumbent, a black Democrat incumbent, in the same\ndistrict with a white Republican incumbent. If they\nwere serious about --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it gets back to\nthe Justice Scalia's point --\nMR. BROWNING: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that this is\ndesigned to protect incumbents.\nMR. BROWNING: Well, Your Honor, incumbency\ncertainly has to be considered in the context of what\nthe Voting Rights Act requires us to do, which is to\nlook at the total picture. Is it a functional approach?\nIt is a matter of looking -- undertaking a searching\nevaluation of the past and present political realities.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Browning, I thought\nthere was something in the record that said never in\nNorth Carolina's history have you had African Americans\nable to choose the -- able to elect the candidate of\ntheir choice where the minority population was less than\n38.37 percent.\nMR. BROWNING: Justice Ginsburg, there are\ndistricts such as Wake County, the seat of government,\nwhere a minority has been elected with less than 38\npercent. But in areas of the State where there is\nhighly racially polarized voting, 38 percent roughly is\nthe effective floor that the General Assembly recognized\nas being workable for creating a district such as this.\nI will also note that this issue was not presented to\nthe North Carolina Supreme Court, the issue of whether\nthere is an alternative district that would somehow be\nfeasible and workable.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, does that mean a\nproposal if you succeed, we should remand on that\nquestion?\nMR. BROWNING: Your Honor, that would\ncertainly be one possibility, but the North Carolina\nSupreme Court resolved this straight legal question as\nto whether the 50 percent rule is in place and is an --\nis an inflexible rule, and not only did they -- they\nimposed this rule with respect to this district, they\nessentially had a mandatory injunction on the North\nCarolina General Assembly to never draw a district at\nless than 50 percent if it cuts too many county lines;\nand that is even inconsistent with the United States'\nview of section 2. For that reason, alone the decision\nshould be reversed.\nIf there are no other questions I would like\nto reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nBrowning.\nMr. Thurman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CARL W. THURMAN, III,\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. THURMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court.\nThe rule proposed by Petitioners in this\ncase would effectively require maximization resulting\nin, as the Court has recognized, judicial involvement in\nmany, many more situations.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I don't know why it would\nrequire maximization. It would -- it would certainly\nopen the door to -- to more districts required by\nsection 2 than if we have a 50 percent rule. But I -- I\nthink your brother conceded that when -- when you draw a\ndistrict, you are bound by our case law as well as\ntradition to look to something more than maximization,\nand maximization is in fact not the law. So I don't see\nwhy it would be required.\nMR. THURMAN: Your Honor, in this situation,\nwe take the position that the people of North Carolina\nand their ultimate authority, their State Constitution,\nhave spoken and said that county lines should be kept\nwhole to the extent practical. And the State's position\nis the legislators disregarded that and, based on the\ncases, based on LULAC, at 25 percent --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What's that got to do with\nmaximization?\nMR. THURMAN: Well, Your Honor, that would\nbe the position they would take of every district that\ncould be drawn regardless of the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: There is no question that\nif they are -- if they win this case, I think there is\nno question there will be more claims requiring -- or\npotentially more claims requiring adjustment of lines\nbased on avoiding section 2 violation. I would almost\nthink that was common ground. But that is a different\nthing from saying that the result of those claims is\ngoing to be a required maximization. And that's --\nthat's the only point that I -- that I meant to pick --\npick up on.\nMR. THURMAN: Your Honor, it seems that if\nthere are going to be more potential claims, and as\nevery legislative body, school board, city council,\nwhatever it is, has to follow section 2, they will have\nto take this into account. They will be facing\npotential claims and they will have to run the risk of\ndo we look to try to maximize a district that might not\notherwise be required, that might violate a neutral\ncriteria --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You are saying they will\ntend to maximization in order to avoid litigation.\nMR. THURMAN: Your Honor, I think that is\nabsolutely true.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why in the -- why in\nthe world would you stipulate to bloc voting in a\nsituation where you have nearly 20 percent crossover\nvoting?\nMR. THURMAN: Your Honor, the answer to that\nquestion is we were 20 months into the litigation, we\nhad just received a partial ruling on cross motions for\nsummary judgment, we were already at the midpoint of the\ndecade. If this Court should affirm the North Carolina\nSupreme Court, my client will have one election in which\nthey have a district that complies with the North\nCarolina Constitution. We quite simply wanted to move\nthe case along.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it seems\nto me you have complicated situations on a rather\ncritical point, what seems to me a basic conundrum, how\ncan you have bloc voting and at the same time have\nsignificant crossover voting? You take one of those off\nthe table, it's kind of hard to address the basic issue\nin the case.\nMR. THURMAN: I agree, Your Honor. The\nother point that I would point out is, it is not a\nstipulation that there was sufficient bloc voting within\neither of the districts that were drawn. The\nstipulation was with reference to bloc voting within the\ntwo counties. The district that could be drawn -- there\nis no stipulation that the alternative district does not\ncomply and would -- and therefore would require the\ncreation of the 39 percent district.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, since the district is\ndrawn from the counties and there's a stipulation with\nrespect to the counties, doesn't it follow in the\nabsence of some surprising fact that there would be bloc\nvoting or the stipulation would cover bloc voting in the\ndistrict?\nMR. THURMAN: Your Honor, there are very\ndifferent populations in these two counties, and that is\nreferenced in the record with regards to the growth in\npopulation; and there is very different minority\npopulations in the two counties because of the influx --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But regardless, regardless\nof the -- the variations in mix, if you are stipulating\nthat there's bloc voting in county A, bloc voting in\ncounty B, and you have got a district made up part of A,\npart of B, doesn't it follow in -- in the absence of\nsome pretty specific evidence to the contrary, that in\nthe district there is probably going to be bloc voting?\nMR. THURMAN: Your Honor, I would\nrespectfully submit that it does not follow within a\nparticular section of a district. I think we all --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do you have evidence in the\nrecord -- did you put evidence in the record that this\nparticular district is carved from some peculiar section\nof county A and county B, so that the general bloc\nvoting pattern does not apply in the district?\nMR. THURMAN: Your Honor, there is evidence\nin the record, and it is cited in the brief, that\nminority candidates, black candidates for judicial\noffice and for State auditor received between 59 percent\nand 62 percent of the vote in the proposed district. We\nwould respectfully submit that that comprises evidence\nthat there is not sufficient bloc voting.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you stipulated. You\ndidn't want to argue the third factor. You wanted --\nyou just started out by saying you were tired of this\nlitigation, we wanted to concentrate on one issue and\none issue only, and that was the 50 percent rule. And\nnow you are suggesting that, well, no, the stipulation\nreally didn't stipulate away the third factor. I\nthought you were giving in on that issue so that you\ncould get the first issue decided.\nMR. THURMAN: Your Honor, we did make a\nstipulation that there was evidence sufficient to\nsupport a finding and that we would stand by. There was\nevidence they had an expert who was willing to so\ntestify. I was responding to Justice Souter's question\nof was there was evidence in the record to support the\ncontention that there might not be bloc voting within\nthe alternative district, and that was -- that meant\nthat black candidates can receive in excess of 60\npercent of the vote in the 35 percent district.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But just help me on the\nfacts, because I may have misunderstood the facts.\nYou're saying you did not stipulate that there was bloc\nvoting; you stipulated that there was sufficient\nevidence for a factfinder to find that there was bloc\nvoting. Is that your position?\nMR. THURMAN: Your Honor, on page 130a of\nthe -- I believe this is their submission, the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sorry, what -- what's\nthe color of the brief -- of the cover on this? Is it\nthe brown one or the white one?\nMR. THURMAN: I believe this is the white\none, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, and you're at 130?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: 130a?\nMR. THURMAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. THURMAN: And it starts out that, in\nterms of the bloc voting, between the -- and the\nevidence presented by the defendant is sufficient to\nsupport a finding of fact that the racial difference in\nthe presence of those results in the white majority\nvoting is sufficient as a bloc to defeat the minority's\npreferred candidate. And, again, that comes down to --\nthe court that it was Pender and New Hanover County that\nstarted the action on 29a, and that was the stipulation.\nAnd --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But what do you make of the\n-- the beginning of the next paragraph? \"Plaintiffs\nhereby advise the court that they do not wish to be\nheard further or to present evidence regarding the\nremaining issues.\" Doesn't -- I'm not sure what that's\ngetting at, but when I looked at it, I thought it meant\nthat the stipulation can control, i.e., it may be found\nwithout objection that there is bloc voting or assumed\nwithout objection that there is bloc voting.\nMR. THURMAN: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If you don't wish to\npresent evidence.\nMR. THURMAN: Your Honor, first of all, we\nwere not stipulating that it did exist. We stipulated\nthat it was in evidence, that the court defined --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, I realize, but when\nyou then say \"And we don't wish to present any evidence\non it,\" it sounds to me as though you are conceding the\nissue.\nMR. THURMAN: Your Honor, we do -- we let it\nstand on its own, we not wish to be heard further, we do\nnot wish to take additional time on that, given the\ncircumstances of the case.\nThe other factor that I think is perhaps\nmost important in considering this is touched on briefly\nearlier. Section 2 clearly applies to all\njurisdictions. And without the guidance of the 50\npercent rule, the bodies that are drafting are left with\nan uncertain standard and a standard -- in this case, so\nfar as we know, the State had retroactive -- this Court\n-- had been used previously, are every local government\nbody requires paying such an expert to proceed simply to\nredistrict? That, if you don't have a clear rule to\nfollow, presents a problem for the many government\nbodies that have to redistrict on a regular basis.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What was wrong with the\nclear rule that Justice Souter suggested in the LULAC\ncase?\nMR. THURMAN: I'm sorry, ma'am.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Justice Souter, in his\nopinion in the LULAC case --\nMR. THURMAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- he suggested what he\ncalled a hard-edged -- a clear, hard-edged rule which is\nnot going to be an exclusive rule, but, anyway, if you\nmet that standard, you're okay.\nMR. THURMAN: Your Honor, I certainly am not\ncriticizing the rule proposed by Justice Souter, but --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It's okay.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. THURMAN: Your Honor, I think -- the\nperspective -- and I can't help -- that it is not as\nclear-edged as it seemed to the Court, at least to\nJustice Souter, that the 50 percent rule does provide a\nvery clear, very limited sort of a rule that can be\nfollowed without getting involved in -- I do believe\nthat -- race becomes very likely the predominant factor\nin the redistricting decision, because based on the\ncases that have come before you already, there have been\nclaims that 26 percent, 25 percent --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't see how those\nclaims could possibly succeed, but I thought -- let's go\nback to sort of step 1. My mind turns a little confused\nwhen I start thinking of these cases. Are we talking\nabout a case of -- where the claim is normally vote\ndilution? Is that yes or no?\nMR. THURMAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Section 2 -- does vote\ndilution mean we who are a minority group, let's say a\nblack group, could have elected a candidate of our\nchoice more likely than the white group, but because you\nare engaged in vote dilution, that isn't going to happen\nanymore? Is that the form of the claim?\nMR. THURMAN: Yes, Your Honor, that is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's the form of the\nclaim.\nThen, it's our problem here that to see\nwhether that's so, you have to see whether the black\ngroup did really vote as a group. Did they used to have\na good chance to elect the person they want, and does\nthe white group tend to also vote as a group and swamp\nthem? Is that what we are trying to find out?\nMR. THURMAN: Your Honor, I'm not sure that\nis entirely what we are trying to find out, because\ncertainly districts are created where there was no\nminority incumbent, and that can happen because of\nchanges in demographics or a variety --\nJUSTICE BREYER: There are a lot of reasons\nthat can happen. But is the evil we are trying to get\nat, the evil of a black group, when they stick together\nin polarized voting, having less of a chance of getting\ntheir candidate elected than when the white group does\nthe same?\nMR. THURMAN: Your Honor, I believe the\nanswer is, yes, we are trying to prevent that from\nhappening.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's what we are trying\nto prevent? Okay. If that's what we are trying to\nprevent, then haven't we learned that putting a\nthreshold, because you can't even get in the door -- you\ncan't even get in the door -- unless the black group\naccounted for 50 percent of something, the voters or the\npeople who turn out, that that doesn't make much sense\nfor the reason that Justice Scalia started with. It\ndoesn't make much sense because sometimes they account\nfor 51 percent, but they can't elect anybody, because\nthey all divide on four different people, or maybe they\ndidn't turn out. On the other hand, sometimes if they\naccount for 43 percent, they could elect the candidate\nof their choice. So it looks as if that 50 percent is\npretty arbitrary and we're looking for a better\ncriterion. Is there anything wrong with what I've said\nso far?\nMR. THURMAN: Respectfully, Your Honor, I\nbelieve there is, because you said you look to see if\nthere is vote dilution. Well, there needs to be\nsomething to measure that by. Section 5 is about\nretrogression.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Here what we've -- could we\nlook to see whether the three Gingles factors, whatever\nthey are -- one was, is the black group numerous enough\nto elect the candidates of their choice? Reasonably\ncompact, politically cohesive? And then you look to\nsee, does the white group tend to vote as a bloc to stop\nthem?\nMR. THURMAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's what we should do?\nMR. THURMAN: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then I'm back to my\nproblem, that sometimes the 50 percent criteria just\ndoesn't measure that first part. And so you say, well,\nany other matter would be worse, but I bet we could\ninvent some that were actually better. Suppose you\nwouldn't have to go to 20 percent; suppose, for example,\nyou started looking in the 40 percents, and you said,\nyou know, if the black group is going to elect their\ncandidate with 40 percent, or 45 percent even, they're\ngoing to need a lot of crossovers, because they may only\nvote -- you know, only 80 percent may turn out. They\nare going to need a lot of crossovers. And the more\ncrossovers you have to have, the harder it is to say\nthat that white group is out there trying to beat them.\nSo there's a kind of natural stopping place.\nWhen I worked out the numbers, it seemed that natural\nstopping place fell around 42-43 percent. It sort of\nfell -- as you said, that the black group -- you insist\nthat the black group had to be twice as many as the\nwhite group that crossed over. A little arbitrary, but\nat least we were getting to the same -- to the right\nthing. I mean -- respond as you wish.\nMR. THURMAN: Thank you, Your Honor. It may\ntake me a second to take it all in. It seems to me that\nthe reason the 50 percent rule does work is, at 50\npercent, there is a claim that there is the opportunity\nand there is voter registration, voter turnout, a lot of\nfactors that can influence at that point, but that\ndoesn't prevent there from being opportunity. That's\nthe choice of whatever group is involved. You start\ndropping below 50 percent, and then they're not being\ndenied an equal opportunity. They have the same\nopportunity any other group does. This would require\ntrying to -- because what -- basically the Petitioner's\nposition is -- the State in its -- position is, it takes\na minority group, and then you find presumably another\nmajority group that shares political and partisan goals\nwith them, and you combine those two together. So you\nlook not only to the race of one group -- that\npredominates first. Then you go find like-minded\nmembers of the majority group to join with them. And so\nthat is what is being required. At that point you are\nnot talking about them being treated less equal than\nanyone else.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Thurman, can I ask you\nthis question? It seems to me that a rigid 51 percent\nrule assumes that the minority communities throughout\nthe country are all alike, and that there is enough\nvariety in every district and every part of the country\nwhere we have this problem. There are variations.\nMaybe 51 percent would not be enough. The minority\ngroup might, itself, be divided as is often the case.\nI -- I think the underlying premise -- the\nunderlying -- the premise underlying your argument is\nthat all minorities are exactly alike. That's why we\ncan have this mathematical figure, and that answers the\nquestion.\nMR. THURMAN: Your Honor, I categorically\nreject that as a human-rights basis for our argument.\nThat is handled by the third Gingles prong and the\nsecond Gingles prong. And when you look at what the\ncoalition is, what it is, and you look at how\npolitically cohesive it is. So it could be that 50\npercent is arguably not enough under the second Gingles\nprovision.\nBut that until you get to 50 percent, you\nare -- again, it is the way it has been described as a\ngate-keeping function for us to keep the Court out of\nit. And it is going to -- if this happens, you start\nlooking at combining a combination of race or other\nminority status and partisan politics and combining them\ntogether for the purpose of electing particular\ncandidates. And I do not believe it's ever been\nsomething that this Court has endorsed for the purpose\nof the Voting Rights Act. And if that is the position\nit takes, it starts to run into the issue: Is such\nsupportable under the Solomon case, under equal\nprotection?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- what\nJustice Breyer proposed a rule at the end of his\nquestion. He said: Suppose you make it, the threshold,\ninstead of 50 percent, it would be twice as many in the\nAfrican-American population as in the crossover group.\nThat would be the threshold.\nMR. THURMAN: But, Your Honor, first, I\nbelieve as he said, as Justice Breyer said, that's an\narbitrary number that he picked up on, the 50 percent.\nThe reason we would submit that is not simply an\narbitrary number is that it does deal with them. At\nthat point there is an opportunity, regardless of\nwhether there is the -- what it certainly does not\nexist --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but you are saying\nit's an opportunity, and what you mean is it is\nsufficient to provide an opportunity. And\nJustice Breyer's question is: Isn't the two-to-one\nratio something that we should consider as also being\nsufficient to provide an opportunity?\nMR. THURMAN: Your Honor, I would say that\nthat would not be appropriate, because at that point you\nare looking on -- at the basis of race to give one group\na greater opportunity than another, and the Voting\nRights Act is the one group being given less opportunity\nthan another. And so if you are hinting to draw a\ndistrict that bases itself on race, that attempts to\ngive one group --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it's -- it's a\ngreater opportunity than -- than would be given to them\nin -- in the district or a pair of districts that splits\nthe minority population in half. But how is it in some\nabstract sense a greater opportunity?\nMR. THURMAN: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The opportunities are --\nare measured on the ground, not in the abstract.\nMR. THURMAN: Your Honor, my answer to that\nwould be that the -- what would be proposed is it is\nrequired. It is no longer left up to the legislature to\ndecide whether that is appropriate. And that since it\nis a requirement, that is not part of the political\nprocess; and it goes to whether that is -- they are no\nlonger looking to what they have left, but whether they\nare, in fact, given more.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Joseffer?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL JOSEFFER\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. JOSEFFER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nPetitioner has proposed expansion of section\n2's traditional coverage because of three serious\nproblems. The first is to provide State and local\nlegislatures, as well as the courts, with a baseline\nagainst which to when a section 2 District must be drawn\nin the first place, when to engage in this race-\nconscious exercise in the first place.\nSecond, it raises the serious Constitutional\nconcerns identified in LULAC, especially because it\ncombines not only racial gerrymandering but with\npolitical-party gerrymandering all at the same time.\nAnd third, it requires difficult predictive\njudgments about how people would react, how people would\nvote in a future proposed district, something that is\nnot required under the traditional Gingles analysis.\nAnd these problems would exist nationwide\nbecause section 2 applies to every districting done in\nevery jurisdiction and every -- nationwide, be it a\ncounty, city, or locality or down to the school-board or\ncity-council level.\nNow, under the first of those points, under\nthe traditional Gingles test, the scope of consideration\nof race and other things, as well as the majority limit\nof the districts -- and that provides an -- an easy\nfocal point that anyone drawing a district knows.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought you were\nconceding that it isn't a rigid rule, and that the North\nCarolina Supreme Court should have to be -- I mean they\ncould be 48 percent, I think you said.\nMR. JOSEFFER: We have identified two\nnarrow exceptions, neither of which the Court really\nneeds to reach in this case. The first is an inference\nof intentional discrimination. And the important thing\nthere is, first, that's academic. Because if you can\nprove intentional discrimination, you can proceed with a\nconstitutional claim under section 2 and not add\nanything anyway.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Intentional by those who\ndraw the district?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Yes, exactly. And there --\nthe point here is because it's not an actualization\nstatute, one needs a baseline to determine if there is\nthe denial of an equal opportunity to elect. And if, in\nfact, what the people drawing the district were trying\nto do was to deprive the minority group of that\nopportunity, that is a perfectly good alternative\nbaseline.\nOur other proposed narrow exception, which\nalso is not even close to being implicated here, is\nbasically an evidentiary one: That there are those\ncases where, when you are trying to figure out whether\nthe majority population is above 50 percent, you may not\nbe sure because these are estimates. They are very\nreliable, but we would impose about a two percent\ncushion there to adjust -- to account for the\npossibility that if there is that much evidentiary\nuncertainty, it makes sense to have a -- for purposes of\nthat test. However --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I don't know if you\nlitigate whether you are -- whether you are really\ntalking about a -- a possible two percent variation. So\nthat I mean, I -- I think you have to concede under your\n-- under your test that there's going to be more\nlitigation. There is going to be more claims than there\nare under a 50 percent rule.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, because -- I say\nactually the opposite because -- well, I think that\ntrying to determine 48percent raises no more difficulty\nthan trying to determine 50 percent.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Except that you have a\nbetter chance so you are more likely to do it.\nMR. JOSEFFER: There is -- there is a slight\nnarrowing of the -- of the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Two percent is pretty big\nin an election.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, in -- in practice -- I\nmean, remember, the majority-minority rule has been\nfollowed in almost every jurisdiction nationwide for\nmore than two decades, and so far I have seen one 48\npercent case. There may have been others, but there --\nthere don't seem to have been very many.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If you want an absolute,\narbitrary rule, which is what you were heading toward\nwhich will just -- - the question is whether they get in\nthe door. If they are in the door, they have to prove\nthe three factors. And you want to keep certain people\nout.\nOkay. Suppose you say, well, 42 percent.\nThat gives you down to 40, with your two back, instead\nof 50. But you are out anyway if the crossover vote\nfrom the white majority is more than half of what the\nwhole vote is with the black and white together on that\nside. So you have a two-to-one ratio.\nNow, the only virtue of that is that there\nwas an effort to try to get an arbitrary rule, which you\nhave with your 50 percent, even -- only a little bit\nmore difficult than that to -- to administer, and is\nlikely to get in more cases that are justified. But\nthey still have to prove their three factors.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, there -- there are a\ncouple of things. The first is that, textually\nspeaking, what the statute refers to is an equal\nopportunity to elect the -- the representative of their\nchoice. And at least the most principal blind is the\nmajority-minority rule. Because if you have by\nyourselves the majority of the electorate, you have at\nleast in theory the opportunity to elect the\nrepresentative of your choice. When you go beyond that,\nthere really is at that point --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It takes into account the\nrealistic fact that in every group, including lots of\nAfrican-American groups, there is -- it is not\n100 percent African American at all. There are -- there\nare a few others who will come along, and -- and that's\nstill the candidate of that community's choice.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Right. But that's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So we want -- a little\nflexibility here is all that I'm suggesting.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Yes. The problem is once you\ngo below what is at least in principle a 50 percent\nline, it's not clear where -- where one would ever stop.\nAnd under your approach, I think two exceptions: One,\nyou definitely open the door down to potentially below\n42, especially -- in this case, especially --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You can't get below 42.\nI'm not going to get below 40 no matter what, even with\nyour thumb on the scale.\nMR. JOSEFFER: I mean --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They are -- they are\nfinished at 40, and they are not even in at 40, if they\nhave to depend more than two-to-one on the crossovers.\nMR. JOSEFFER: One problem with what you are\nlooking for is a principle rule that can be justified.\nI understand 50, and I understand the slight evidentiary\ncushion. Forty-two really does -- from what you're\ntrying to determine is now the equal opportunity to be\ncoming out of nowhere.\nThe other advantage the 50 percent rule has\nis the advantages of incumbency. In effect, it has been\na case that has been litigated for more than two\ndecades. And that has shown that, first, that it's\nworkable; and second, that it does not appear to have\nleft some gaping hole of section 2's coverage. If it\nhad, Congress likely would have -- statute over the past\ntwo decades.\nAnd the other thing -- I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I won -- I'd hoped that\nyou could have a brief time to discuss your third\nrationale because it's going to require determination of\nhow people would vote.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Under Gingles one typically\nlooks at what actually happened in the past. The third\nGingles factor looks, for example, looks to whether\nwhite bloc voting in actual elections has generally been\nsufficient to prevent the election of minority group's\ncandidate of choice in the past. So, it's a\nstraightforward historic-based inquiry.\nHere, however, the state or local\nlegislature at the outset looking to trade a new\ndistrict based on the prediction that it will elect the\nminority group's candidate of choice.\nSo, as a practical matter, you start with\nthe racial makeup of some people and the political\npartisanship of others. But you can't stop there,\nbecause you have to predict turnout by each group,\ncrossover voting by each group.\nAs a practical matter, those things will\nvary based on who the candidates are, whether there is\nan incumbent, whether the incumbent is the minority\ngroup's candidate of choice. And especially in local\nelections, the -- may not even be available, which was a\npoint that was made in the topside amicus brief filed by\nthe Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights, the NAACP Legal\nDefense Fund and others.\nIf I could turn to the Constitutional --\npoint. In that perspective, this proposal is really the\nworst of all worlds, because the way you construct a\ndistrict is to take some people based on race, others\nbased on political party affiliation, and the race can't\ndominate and the majority of courts have also held\npurely partisan gerrymandering, at least -- aside is\nalso unconstitutional.\nBut this is both. What you have is\nnationwide in every jurisdiction, every districting a\nmandate that requires consideration for both race and\npartisanship that goes far beyond what has traditionally\nbeen required under section 2 and I suspected far beyond\nwhat normally happens at the local level.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have a view\non how we should approach the stipulation adopted below?\nMR. JOSEFFER: I think the easy way to cut\nthrough is that a state Supreme Court respond and remand\nall arguments other than the first Gingles factor. So,\nthe first Gingles factor, based on what happened in the\nstate Supreme Court is the only thing that is before the\nCourt.\nWhat would remain potentially unremand is if\nthis Court were to would ban the traditional\nunderstanding of the first Gingles factor and impose a\nnew understanding. Then the adjudication of that might\nbe open on remand. But Respondents have remanded\neverything else in the state Supreme Court.\nFinally, I also can't help but mention that\nthere is a great irony here in that Petitioners'\nessential position is that back when race relations were\nworse and back when there's much more racial bloc\nvoting, minority-majority districts worked okay.\nBut now that race relations have improved\nand there is much more crossover voting, we should now\nrequire greater consideration of race as well as\npartisanship than had ever been done before under the\nsame unamended statute.\nAnd if I could turn -- Justice's -- at the\noutset, a state or local legislature as well as the\ncourt really doesn't know where to start. State and\nlocal legislatures are the ones who are supposed to be\ndrawing these lines. That means they need to be clear\nadministrable rules to follow. And the simpler they\nare, the better the chance we will have to do it, and if\nthey can figure it out at the outset, the less\nconsideration of race and partisanship becomes\nnecessary.\nAnd the 50 percent rule, as a practical\nmatter, has worked for a couple of decades in this\nrespect. And if one goes beyond that, there is also no\nprinciple stopping point. Here's 39 percent, which\ndoesn't seem close to me or under Justice Breyer's\nrationale --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You mention how well it\nworked. Did you see the graphs -- one of Amicus briefs\nhave the graph showing what the 50 percent rule did for\none gerrymander and how the lesser percentage worked\nout -- remember which were much more -- not using the 50\npercent rule produced much more compact districts?\nMR. JOSEFFER: There are two things about\nthe graphs. The first is that less compact maps --\nthose were the districts that would determine the\nunconstitutional.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But they were designed to\nproduce 50 percent, and that's why they got so -- so --\nso grotesque.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Right. Another thing there\nseems to be a common misconception that our view of\nsection 2 prohibits the drafting of crossover districts,\nwhich is not case of all.\nThe question here is what if it is required.\nIf a district -- if a jurisdiction wants to draw a\ncrossover district, then at least in principle nothing\nis stopping it from doing so. However, if what you were\nto do was require the drawing these crossover districts,\nthat could create some funny maps of its own, because if\nyou have to reach out to grab jurisdiction wide, look at\nevery significant pocket of minority voters, look at\nwhatever you could put together that would vote alike,\nwhich as a practical matter is the same political party,\nthen you are going to be requiring the same dynamics\nthat led to those very strange maps in the -- in the\nfirst place.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you Mr.\nJoseffer.\nMr. Browning, you have four minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER G. BROWNING\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. BROWNING: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nLet me start first of all with\nJustice Breyer's question about the arbitrary nature of\nthe 50 percent rule. The 50 percent rule, let there be\nno doubt, is extremely arbitrary, even under the\ngovernment's 2 percent cushion.\nWhat would happen is you have a district\nthat is 40 percent -- 46 percent African American, that\ndistrict could be freely carved off into two districts\nof 23 percent each, neither of which would provide an\nequal opportunity to elect. Even when you are in a\nsituation like this case, where the district is actually\nfunctioning and has a proven ability to elect a minority\npreferred candidate. Moreover --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Wouldn't Justice Breyer's 40\npercent rule be just as arbitrary?\nMR. BROWNING: Justice Alito, it is\nimportant to recognize that there are significant\ndistricts that are out there that would not be protected\nunder the 50 percent rule. And I understand the Court's\ndesire to have some sort of limitation on the size of\nthe district. We believe it is already in there, in\nplace as a result of the LULAC decision.\nIt's in place because in North Carolina, as\na practical matter, you can't go much below 40 percent\nand have a district that will actually work.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But this -- but yours is\nbelow? Just slightly below.\nMR. BROWNING: The voting age population is\n39.36 percent based upon the census data. The\ngovernment wants to use a 2 percent cushion as their\nthreshold. But there is some significant problems with\nthat, because when you look at the overcount of white\nvoters, the Census Bureau recognizes the lower count is\nbasically 2 percent there in and of itself, then there\nare some undercounted black voters is a 1 percent\nundercount. So even a 48 percent doesn't even get\nanywhere close.\nMoreover, you have districts where there are\na number of eligible -- number of people that are\ncounted in the census that are not truly eligible to\nvote. That is reflected in the brief by the States at\npage 28 in footnote 2. The States make the point that\nthere are many districts where we have military bases,\nwe have colleges that cause this to be an extremely\narbitrary rule.\nAnd in North Carolina there are districts\nwhere once you remove the military base where most of\nthe population will not be voting in that district,\nthere is a shift of even 12 percent in the minority\nvoting age population increasing by 12 percent once you\njust remove the military bases from the equation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The rule I suggested,\nthough there are arbitrary aspects is a better targeted,\nmore administrable -- or equally administrable or not\nmuch worse administrable arbitrary rule.\nMR. BROWNING: Justice Breyer, in our view\nthe rule that should be applied is consistent with the\nrule of LULAC, that the minority group is substantially\nlarger than its coalition partner.\nHere the minority group is 39.36 percent\nAfrican American. It only requires an additional\nroughly 11 percent white crossover voting. So the white\ncrossover voting that is needed is only a third of the\nsize of the minority group.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There must be somebody\nthere to get you over 50 percent.\nMR. BROWNING: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Thirty-three plus 11 is 44.\nSo where does the rest come from?\nMR. BROWNING: Your Honor, this district is\n39.36 percent African American.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's 40, and then -- oh,\nI see, 39 plus 11.\nMR. BROWNING: And you need 11 percent\ncrossover voting, 11 percent of the electorate --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If they vote cohesively.\nMR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor. Here the\nminority group, the expert's testimony is that they do\nvote cohesively.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's a necessary\npredicate to his very question that the majority group,\nthe white group does not vote cohesively. Under your\nhypothetical at least 11 percent have to swing over.\nMR. BROWNING: The -- the white vote does\nnot vote 100 percent cohesively. But it is still at\nsuch high levels, there is only a limited amount of\ncrossover voting. It is still very racially polarized.\nAnd if district lines are not taken into account, the --\nthe votes of black voters in the district will be\ndrowned out by the white voters that are voting against\nthat minority candidate simply because that candidate is\na minority.\nThere is some crossover voting, but not\nenough to make the -- for us to lose on the third\nGingles prong.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
