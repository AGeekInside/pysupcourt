        "content": "(10:08 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear\nargument first this morning in 05-11304, Smith versus\nTexas.\nMr. Steiker.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JORDAN STEIKER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. STEIKER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThis case is here for the second time. In\nyour summary of reversal, this Court held that\nPetitioner's mitigating evidence could not be given\nadequate consideration through the Texas special\nissues or the nullification instructions. On remand,\nthe CCA found the error harmless by concluding the\nopposite, that Petitioner's jury could give\nsufficient consideration to his mitigating evidence,\nincluding specifically the evidence of his 78 IQ,\nlearning disabilities and troubled background.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did they find it could or\ndid they find that it did? I thought our holding was\nthat given the instructions, the jury would not\nnecessarily take into account those mitigating\nfactors, and I thought that what the Texas court held\nis, yes, that was a possibility, and we have to see\nwhether that possibility came to pass, which is what\nharmless error analysis involves.\nMR. STEIKER: I think, Justice Scalia,\nwhat the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So they are not\ncontradicting the fact that the jury wasn't required\nto take it into account, but they are saying\nnonetheless, in our view, the jury did take it into\naccount, and therefore, the error was harmless. That\ndoesn't contradict our opinion. I mean, you might\nwant to argue against it on the merits, but I don't\nthink that will contradict our opinion.\nMR. STEIKER: I think it does contradict\nyour opinion, Justice Scalia. Your opinion said that\nPetitioner's mitigating evidence had little or\nnothing to do with the inquiries of the special\nissues, and your opinion also said that the\nnullification instruction, no matter how clearly\nconveyed or fully understood by the jury, would not\nsolve that problem.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's right. And that\nmeans that the jury was not instructed to take it\ninto account. And I think the Texas court is\nconceding that. But it's, it's saying, nonetheless,\nwe don't think that the error made any difference\nbecause, in our view, the jury did take it into\naccount.\nMR. STEIKER: The matter in which the CCA\nposited that the jury could take it into account was\nthe fact that on voir dire, the jurors said we can\nfollow a nullification instruction and falsify our\nanswers to the special issues in order to give effect\nto mitigating evidence. That was the exact same\nproposition that the CCA had issued in its first\nopinion that this Court summarily reversed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but it seems to me\nit's one thing to use it for the purpose of saying\nthe instruction was okay. And it's something else to\nuse it for the purpose of saying even though the\ninstruction didn't require that, it was a fuzzy\ninstruction and a juror could very reasonably have\nunderstood it not to allow nullification,\nnonetheless, we have satisfied ourselves that the\njury indeed thought it had the nullification power.\nI don't see how it contradicts our opinion.\nMR. STEIKER: I think what's\ncontradictory, Your Honor, is that the notion that\nthe nullification instruction would be an adequate\nvehicle was what this Court specifically rejected.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They didn't say it was an\nadequate vehicle. I mean, they acknowledged that\nthat instruction shouldn't be given again because it\ndoesn't require the jury to do what, what you say the\njury must do, and I think they accept that. They\nsay, oh, no, I thought it was fuzzy, and didn't\nrequire -- we think the jury did indeed think it had\nthe power to nullify.\nMR. STEIKER: And I would also add that\nwhen you actually look at the voir dire on which the\nCCA relied in which it said jurors express no\ndiscomfort, no hesitation about their willingness to\nfalsify their answers to the special issues, the very\nfirst juror in this case, a lawyer, expressed exactly\nthe kinds of discomfort that this Court feared and\nanticipated with the use of the nullification\ninstruction.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, Mr. Steiker, may I\ninterrupt you or interrupt the course of your\nargument to get to a more preliminary point before\nyou get down to details? Do you concede that\nharmless error analysis is ever appropriate, is ever\nopen as an option following an, in effect, a finding\nof this kind of instructional error, Penry I\ninstructional error? Do you concede that?\nMR. STEIKER: Justice Souter, we do not\nconcede that, but nor do we rely on that as a basis\nfor relief in this case. We believe that the\npurported harmless error analysis that the CCA\napplied was so interwoven with a rejection of the\nFederal constitutional --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I quite agree. I\nunderstand that. Was the, was the issue of the\navailability of harmless error raised on your side of\nthe case in the proceedings back in Texas?\nMR. STEIKER: Yes, it was. It was raised\non remand from this Court.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Also on the same\npreliminary line of inquiry, are we in as good a\nposition as the State court to conduct harmless error\nanalysis, or can we or must we defer to the State\ncourt's harmless error analysis?\nMR. STEIKER: I would say ordinarily this\nCourt is not in as good a position as a State court\nto conduct harmless error analysis. Our belief here\nis that the, the basis for the State finding the\nerror harmless was a very unusual rejection of the\nconclusion that this, these instructions would\nfacilitate consideration of mitigating evidence.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You agree that the\napplication of the harmless error analysis is a\nquestion of State law, though, correct?\nMR. STEIKER: I do not agree with that. I\nthink that the application of harmless error\nanalysis, when it's predicated on a misunderstanding\nof Federal constitutional law, is not an independent\nbasis for decision. It's clearly wrapped up in the\nFederal claim, and I think this Court's cases have\nclearly so held.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So that if there is an\ninstruction given to the jury and it violates the\nConstitution, then we, as a de novo matter, can\ndetermine the harmless error, harmless error inquiry?\nMR. STEIKER: It's, it's certainly\npossible. I don't think that that's a usual practice\nand I wouldn't advocate that here. And this is not a\nusual case in which the State has conducted an\nordinary harmless error analysis. The State has\nactually in no way disparaged the power and extent of\nPetitioner's mitigating evidence.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, is the level of\nharmless error determined as a matter of Federal or\nState law when there is a Federal law?\nMR. STEIKER: Generally speaking, it's a\nmatter of State law with some limitations.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Really. You mean that\nthey could have something that it has to be harmless\nbeyond a reasonable doubt and we'd be bound by that?\nMR. STEIKER: Well, on direct review,\nChapman clearly says it's a Federal question what the\nstandard of review may be. And on direct review,\nit's undoubted that a harmless beyond a reasonable\ndoubt standard is required by Chapman.\nThis case doesn't present the issue on\nwhether on State -- post-conviction, a State can have\nthe latitude of requiring greater harm, because on\nthe CCA's own analysis, the standard of harm that's\napplied on State habeas is identical to the standard\nof harm that's applied on direct review, the standard\nof Almanza, which posits Chapman error, harmless\nbeyond a reasonable doubt for preserved error, and\negregious harm for unpreserved error.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And, and this was\nunpreserved error. I mean, they are not saying this\nfor everything. They are saying he did not object to\nthe instructions at the time and therefore our\nharmless error standard is -- is more rigorous than\nit would otherwise be. What's unreasonable about\nthat?\nMR. STEIKER: And we -- we argue that\nthere are three independent bases, Federal bases for\nfinding that the application of egregious harm in\nthis case to be violative of Federal rights. And I'd\nlike to turn to the first of those arguments.\nPetitioner plainly objected that the\nspecial issues and verdict form did not allow for\nconsideration of his mitigating evidence. That was\nand remains his core argument throughout this case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but that's a very\ngeneralized argument, and what he won on was a very\nspecific point that, that this instruction in effect\nrequired, if they were going to give mitigating\neffect, required a jury nullification. That's a very\nspecific point.\nMR. STEIKER: On that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He did not object -- he\ndid not object to that specific problem. Had he\nobjected, the court would have said, you know, there\nis something to what you say, and I'll give a\ndifferent instruction. But he didn't.\nMR. STEIKER: Everyone at trial understood\nthat the special issues on the verdict form were\nunalterable, that Texas law required the legislature\nto specify what was on the special verdict form.\nWhat the trial court invited counsel to do was to\noffer a different form of nullification in the\nsupplemental instruction that would then interpret\nthe special issues.\nThis Court's opinion in its summary\nreversal made plain that the problem with\nnullification instructions is broad and intractable\nand applies to all nullification instructions.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What you're going to hear\nin a second, I'm sure, because I read it in the\nbriefs, my understanding of the Texas point is\nslightly different. It is this. That under Texas\nlaw, when you file before the, before the trial, a\ngeneral objection, unless you make the objection\nagain when the specific, when a specific instruction\nis given, you've forfeited your rights to appeal.\nUnder Texas law.\nAnd they say that's true of evidence and\nthat's true here, too. And they say that's just\nTexas law, ordinary Texas law. Now --\nMR. STEIKER: There's nothing --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's what you did, you\ndidn't make the right objection. Now you come up\nhere and well, you are out. You can't make any\nargument. But -- we are very generous, and we will\nlet even people who make every wrong procedural thing\nstill have a shot, if what they have, if what they\nare pointing to absolutely egregious. But your isn't\nabsolutely egregious so you're in the same boat as if\nyou just didn't have any argument because you didn't\nfollow the Texas law. Now, I take it, that's their\npoint. What's your response?\nMR. STEIKER: I have special responses,\nYour Honor. The objection to the special verdict\nform and the special issues was made plain in\npretrial motions and that objection was clearly\nrecognized by the trial judge at trial and denied at\ntrial when the instructions were being considered for\nthe purposes of voir dire.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, you're there in a\nTexas court. We're not. We are following Texas law,\nthey say, and you're wrong. Now, what are we\nsupposed to do about that?\nMR. STEIKER: The court, the Court of\nCriminal Appeals did not invoke this basis for saying\nthat his trial objection was inadequate. They didn't\nsay that it was made at the wrong time, or in the\nwrong -- what they specifically said --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They applied, they\napplied a legal standard, the egregious harm\nstandard, that depends on failure of an objection.\nSo I would have thought they, they certainly thought\nthat there was an inadequate objection, or they\nwouldn't have applied that standard.\nMR. STEIKER: Yes, Your Honor. I -- I\nmisspoke if I -- I conveyed the impression that they\ndid not suggest that it was inadequate objection. I\nwas merely suggesting that it wasn't inadequate in\nthe sense that it was made at the wrong time,\npretrial or at trial.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The judge, the judge, I\nthought, told the lawyers what the charge would be,\nand I think also said I can't give a separate charge\non mitigation because that's a job that only the\nTexas legislature can do. I am bound by the statute\nto give these two things.\nI think the judge said that, so it was the\nunderstanding of everyone.\nMR. STEIKER: It was the understanding of\neveryone. It's reflected in the record in the first\nState habeas opinion that the Court of Criminal\nAppeals acknowledges that the verdict form was\nsacrosanct. That was not going to be altered, so the\nnature of the CCA's suggested failing of Petitioner\nwas that he did not specifically object to the\nnullification instruction.\nJUSTICE ALITO: It sounds like you're\narguing that the Texas court misapplied Texas law,\nand you want us to reverse their application of their\nown law about what is an adequate objection.\nMR. STEIKER: No, Your Honor. I believe\nthat the CCA misunderstood the Federal law of the\nrelationship between Penry I and Penry II. The\nfailing in this case was a verdict form that made no\nmention of mitigating evidence. The nullification\ninstruction was the State's flawed defense to that\nfailing.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Yes, but on the issue of\nwhether there was an adequate -- I thought you were\narguing that, in fact, there was an adequate\nobjection. And if the, if the State court held\nagainst you on that point, that's an issue of Texas\nlaw, isn't it?\nMR. STEIKER: I don't think it is an issue\nof Texas law, Your Honor, because the basis for the\nfinding that it was inadequate was that he had to\nseparately object to the nullification instruction as\nopposed to what everyone agreed he object to, was the\ninadequacy of the verdict form. That was his Federal\nclaim. And our view is that the misunderstanding of\nthe nature of the Federal claim was what led the\nTexas court to conclude that his objection was\ninadequate. I'd also like to --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I, may I again\ninterrupt you to just get the context of your\nargument? You said earlier that under Chapman,\nassuming there is a harmless error issue, that\nessentially is -- is necessarily a Federal issue.\nAnd therefore, I take it, the basis of your point\nhere is, if that is a Federal issue, then the\nadequacy of actions of counsel to raise it is also a\nFederal issue. Is that correct?\nMR. STEIKER: That is correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is my understanding --\nMR. STEIKER: That is correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Thank you.\nMR. STEIKER: I'd like to make it clear --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do we make up our own\nprocedural rules, too? I mean, why, why -- why is it\njust a Federal judgment as to whether it adequately\ncomplied with the Texas rule? Presumably we should\nmake up our own rule.\nMR. STEIKER: I don't think you need to\nmake up --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why not? You say it's a\nFederal question.\nMR. STEIKER: It's a Federal question\nabout what the nature of the claim is, and if the\nState's misunderstanding of the Federal claim was\nwhat was intertwined with its conclusion that it was\nan inadequate objection, that is a misunderstanding\nof Federal law. We also believe that the procedural,\nthat the application --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's -- that's a little\nbit different from your, from your response to\nJustice Souter. You are making a much narrower\nargument. You, you don't --\nMR. STEIKER: I believe our, I believe our\nright to be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't assert that in\nevery case when there is a procedural objection in a\ncapital case or any case involving Federal law,\nFederal law will determine whether the procedural\nobjection is adequate?\nMR. STEIKER: I agree with that fully,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you do, but you do\ntake that position with respect to a harmless error?\nMR. STEIKER: I think that the question of\nwhether an error can be deemed harmless is always a\nFederal question. Chapman says as much.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. If we assume,\nfor the sake of argument, that there is disagreement\non that point, are there any cases of this Court on\nthe matter of adequacy of State procedural bars that\nwould support you, even on the assumption that it's a\nState, not a Federal issue?\nMR. STEIKER: Well, clearly Ake vs.\nOklahoma holds that if the State invocation of the\nprocedural rule is dependent on a judgment about\nFederal law, and that judgment is incorrect, it is\nnot an independent basis for decision under the\nindependent adequacy grounds.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What about the case, the\nname of which I cannot think of, to the effect that\nrequiring procedural action by the defendant which\nwould simply be a useless formality and so on?\nMR. STEIKER: That's Flowers.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It's Flowers. All right.\nWouldn't, wouldn't that be authority that you would\ninvoke, in the, in the sense, as I understood your\nearlier argument, that the, that the pretrial motion\nand the adjudication of that made it plain to\neverybody what the, what the issue was, and therefore\nrequiring anything more would -- would in effect\nviolate the Flowers rule?\nMR. STEIKER: I agree with that, Justice\nSouter. I think that to apply the default in these\ncircumstances where everyone was plainly aware of his\nconcerns about the inadequacy of the verdict form in\nspecial -- and the special issues, would be imposing\ntoo high and too excessively burdensome a requirement\nfor the preservation of the Federal right. I do also\nwant to argue that there is a --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is that --\njust, why is that too burdensome? What's so\nburdensome about saying I object to that instruction?\nMR. STEIKER: Well, he did --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're saying,\nthere is a difference between saying it would have\nbeen futile and saying it's high and burdensome, and\nI'm just wondering what your specific point is.\nMR. STEIKER: My specific point is once he\nhas made it plain -- and this is all that Texas law\nitself says is required -- once he has made it plain\nthat he objects to a special verdict form which\ncannot allow for the consideration of mitigating\nevidence, and this Court's holding is that that is\nprecisely the error in this case, that no\nsupplemental nullification instruction could correct,\nhe has plainly made clear what his objection was and\nthere was nothing else he could do.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I, may I ask this\nquestion about your position? Is it your position\nthat they should not have applied any harmless error\nreview, or that they applied the wrong standard? And\nif it's the latter, what was the standard they should\nhave applied?\nMR. STEIKER: We believe it is the latter.\nThat we are assuming that harmless error analysis\ncould apply here without conceding that it's\nnecessarily applied, but assuming for the purposes of\nthis case that it does apply, it should have applied\nthe Chapman standard, which is their standard for\npreserving --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It wouldn't be\npreserving the Chapman standard if it was Federal\ncollateral review, would it?\nMR. STEIKER: No. It would be under\nBrett. It would be a different standard. But Texas\nlaw for jury instruction claims clearly states that\nfor preserved error, the standard is Chapman.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It's preserved error on\ndirect review, isn't it? On page 23 of their brief\nthere's a footnote that, the red brief, that at least\nclaims to describe the sort of the structure of Texas\nlaw, and I thought under Texas law you got a Chapman\nanalysis only if you were on direct review and had\npreserved error. Is that correct?\nMR. STEIKER: I think that the CCA's\nposition and Respondent's position is that Almanza\napplies dually on direct review and post conviction,\nand that that's that's their explanation for why the\nState court didn't impose a procedural default on\nState habeas. And one of our views is even if you\ndon't agree that under Federal law this objection was\ninadequate, we believe that the State could not in\neffect change its mind about the adequacy of his\ntrial objection only after this Court summarily\nreversed its rule on the merits. And we think there\nare --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it\ndidn't have to reach the harmless error question\nafter it made an erroneous determination that there\nwas no error at all. When the case came up here and\nthe Court determined there was error, then it was\nnecessary to reach it. I don't see that it's\nchanging its position at all.\nMR. STEIKER: I think it is changing its\nposition. When four judges signal that this may be a\nprocedural impediment in the case and the court\ndeclines to embrace it, I think that is a signal to\nthis Court that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Wouldn't it be\nnormal exercise of judicial restraint to say, we\ndon't have to reach out and decide whether this error\nwas harmless if we've already decided there's no\nerror at all?\nMR. STEIKER: I think it would not be in\nthe case of State habeas, for this reason. The vast\noverwhelming number of cases that proceed into State\nhabeas are on their way when they're final into\nFederal habeas, and the State court was abandoning\nthis argument for Federal habeas. That is, it was\nremoving any procedural impediment to a merits\nreview.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I just don't -- you\nsay whenever, whenever a court decides the case on\nthe merits instead of using an intervening procedural\nobjection, the procedural objection is waived.\nMR. STEIKER: No, I do not make that, I do\nnot make that broad argument, Your Honor. I think in\nthe special circumstances of State habeas, where, as\nthis Court knows, 99 percent of cases are on their\nway to Federal habeas, and the State does not adopt\nthis procedural impediment which would from a\njudicial --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Especially in capital\ncases, courts don't like to say, oh, you know, yes,\nyou may be innocent but there's this procedural\nobjection. I think most courts --\nMR. STEIKER: I'm afraid that's not my\nexperience with the court of criminal appeals.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's my experience\nwith a lot of courts.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it's a very\nbad -- I think in the long term in the broad category\nof cases, it would be a very bad solution for\ndefendants, because what's going to happen, once a\ncourt's determined there's no error at all, it's much\neasier for them to say, oh and by the way if there\nwas it's harmless. And if they did that and then it\nturns out there was an error, you're going to be back\nhere saying, well, don't be bound by their harmless\nerror decision because they thought there was no\nerror at all, so they didn't focus on it carefully.\nI would say the way they approached it in\nthis case is the more desirable way. If you don't\nthink there's an error don't go on and decide whether\nit's harmless or not in the abstract.\nMR. STEIKER: In the vast majority of\ncases, Chief Justice Roberts, the courts in Texas\ntake that approach, which is if there is a procedural\nimpediment to the case they flag that procedural\nimpediment, rule on alternative grounds, and I think\nthat is good evidence that in this case when four\njustices urged a procedural element --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why, why, why do you say\nthere are a lot of cases where it doesn't matter? I\nwould have thought every case it mattered. Look,\nisn't it an absolute rule that there's a Federal\nissue in a case and there's a State ground, the State\nground typically is a failure to raise an objection,\nand a State court says the Federal ground is what\nwe're talking about. They say nothing about the\nState ground and they decide the Federal ground. The\ndefendant goes to a Federal court and he says, I'm\nentitled to be released because they got the Federal\nground wrong. I thought it's a hundred percent the\ncase, and this is where you'll correct me, that it's\nnow too late for the State to raise the State ground\nbut the State's waived their adequate and independent\nState ground and that if they try to raise it again\nthe answer is always, not some of the time: I'm very\nsorry, State; you're out of luck; you should have\ndecided it on the State ground and not reached the\nFederal ground.\nMR. STEIKER: I think that's exactly\nright, sir.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why wouldn't that be the\ncase? Suppose the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose the State --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't there a difference\nbetween waiving it as a procedural bar and waiving it\nas an objection to the proper standard of review?\nMR. STEIKER: We don't think it's a\ndifference, Your Honor, because we think the\nunderlying fact, the adequacy of the trial objection,\nwas what obtained. And I'd like to point out --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Who gives the State court\nthe power to, as you say, waive that objection? I\ncan understand when you say the prosecutor didn't\nobject. It's the prosecutor that has the power to\nforfeit certain arguments on behalf of the people\nwhich he chooses not to raise.\nMR. STEIKER: I think \"waiver\" might not\nbe the right word.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well --\nMR. STEIKER: But it's clear that if the\nState court does not rely on a procedural impediment\nwhen the case goes into Federal habeas that\nimpediment cannot be reintroduced in the case as a\nseparate ground of decision.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But even if it is,\nlogically anterior to consideration of that\nprocedural impediment is a particular ruling on the\nmerits and the State court didn't make that merits.\nThey thought there was no error. It is logically not\nnecessary for them to decide whether an error is\nharmless if they don't think there's an error, and to\nsay that they waive that, that later ground I would\nhave thought would be very surprising. Why do we\nremand these cases for further proceedings not\ninconsistent with our opinion if there's nothing\nfurther to be considered?\nMR. STEIKER: I think that the concerns\nfor judicial economy in this case would have dictated\nthat if the State court believed that the trial\nobjection was inadequate, it would have rested its\ndecision on that ground to essentially preclude\nmerits review of that Federal constitutional issue.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Otherwise you have a\nSupreme Court decision that the State court can say,\nthanks, thanks, that's very interesting advice, but\nwe -- there was a procedural default here. Although\nwe bypassed it the first time, we're not going to\nbypass it after the Supreme Court has told us what\nthe Federal law is.\nMR. STEIKER: I think it's a special risk\nin State habeas when the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it would be a\nspecial risk if you, if you, if you allowed them to\nraise the bar, allowed a State to raise a bar to\nconsideration of the issue.\nBut I want to go back to your answer to\nJustice Stevens' question. You, you say you draw no\ndistinction between the, the procedural failing as a\nbar to raising the issue and as a basis for\ndetermining a standard of harmless error review\nlater. I don't understand why you, you can maintain\nthere is no distinction because if they may not\nconsider it as the basis for their, their standard of\nharmless error review, assuming we have such a thing,\nthen what are they supposed to use as their standard?\nYour answer I take it is Chapman, but Chapman as I\nunderstand the statement of Federal law would not\napply -- State law -- Chapman would not apply in\nthese circumstances. And if you were in a Federal\ncourt and this were a Federal conviction Chapman\nwouldn't apply on collateral review.\nSo it seems to me that you've either got\nto accept the distinction between procedural error as\nbar to issue, procedural error as basis for standard\nof review, or you have no way to figure out what the,\nwhat the standard of review should be.\nMR. STEIKER: Well, we would take the CCA\nat its word that the Almanza standard's appropriate.\nBut if the underlying fact of the adequacy of the\ntrial objection has basically been accepted by the\nState court, we don't believe that on State habeas it\ncould reintroduce the inadequacy of that.\nI'd like to reserve if I may the remainder\nof my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\ncounsel.\nMr. Cruz.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF R. TED CRUZ\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. CRUZ: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nTwo postulates govern this case. First,\nreconciling Jurek and Johnson and Graham on the one\nhand and Penry II and Tennard and Smith II on the\nother hand is not an easy task and State and Federal\ncourts have struggled for two decades to draw the\nappropriate lines and to faithfully apply this\ncourt's Penry jurisprudence. Second, the usual\ndefault rule in both State and Federal court is that\nmost constitutional errors are subject to harmless\nerror review.\nPetitioner suggests that the State habeas\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I take it that is not an\nissue before us?\nMR. CRUZ: It is an issue that on the\nreply brief Petitioner has essentially conceded. In\nfootnote 5 Petitioner states that he is not seeking\nreversal on the basis that Penry error is structural\nerror. But that is the issue of what the Court of\nCriminal Appeals did to us.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the Penry error, even\nif not structural, is not subject to harmless error\nreview and you could say that that distinction is\npossible because Penry has a built-in harmless error\nor a harmful error component. But as I understand it\nthat's not -- that issue is not in this case.\nMR. CRUZ: It is not in this case because\nof Petitioner's concession, but Petitioner's\nconcession has serious consequences because the only\nground upon which Petitioner can prevail in this\nCourt is that the State court's application of\nharmless error violated the United States\nConstitution and by giving up his structural error\nargument he gives up virtually any basis to lay out\nwhy that would violate the U.S. Constitution, not\nsimply why it was incorrect but why it is\nunconstitutional for the State court to apply that\ndoctrine.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's a question of\nwaiver, part of it. I mean, that's -- it's well\nestablished that, I guess, I mean, if a State waives\nan adequate State ground by considering the Federal\nissue, the Federal courts will go into the Federal\nground and they can't later, can they -- is there any\ncase you found anywhere -- I haven't found one --\nwhere say any Federal court considered a State case\nwhere the State went into the Federal issue, the\nState had said nothing about a State ground, and then\nafter the Federal court's decided it somehow the\nState got a hold of it again and they this time said,\noh dear, we forgot, we forgot; in fact, there is the\nState ground here. And is there any case that you\nfound like that which says that was permissible?\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Breyer, I do not\ndisagree with you.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay, there's no such\ncase and therefore this would be the first.\nMR. CRUZ: But that's not what happened\nhere.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right.\nMR. CRUZ: I do not disagree with you that\nif the State court had concluded for Petitioner on a\nState ground TO begin with and after being reversed\nrevisited that conclusion --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. I'm saying\nthe State typically decides against the defendant.\nThey decide against the defendant on a Federal issue.\nThere's a perfectly adequate State issue. It's\ncalled failure to object, and they don't mention it.\nI'd be repeating myself. Are you following what my,\nmy -- and I'm saying is there any case you found\nanywhere which says after that occurred that the\nState when it gets a hold of the case again can say,\noh dear, we forgot, there's also this adequate State\nground, bad luck? I've never seen such a thing. I\ndoubt that you have.\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Breyer, there is no\nsuggestion --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I say this would be\nthe first.\nMR. CRUZ: That's not what happened here\nand so we are not urging that ground to support what\nthe Court of Criminal Appeals did. But as the Chief\nJustice suggested, the Almanza standard, the State\nharmless error standard, is a two-step inquiry.\nInquiry number one, is there error; and under State\nlaw if you conclude no the analysis ends. So the\nfirst time the State court considered this it\nconcluded there is no constitutional error and so it\nnever addressed harmless error.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm making a mistake\nhere. I thought that the reason they bring in the\nAlmanza standard is, as I put it before, a kind of\nact of charity. That is, since there was no\ncontemporaneous objection or proper one, you don't\nget any appeal normally. But we'll let you do it if\nyou can show egregious harm. I'm wrong about that?\nMR. CRUZ: That is not exactly how the\nState court and State law does it. What the State\nlaw does and our position in this case is that\nPetitioner failed to preserve his objection because\nhe did not object specifically on the grounds --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but Mr. Cruz, is it\nnot true that if he did fail to preserve the\nobjection then there should have been a procedural\nbar to the case going forward?\nMR. CRUZ: There is not a procedural bar\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why is that?\nMR. CRUZ: -- because the State Court of\nCriminal Appeals has chosen to forgive failure to\npreserve for purposes of procedural default and\nsubsequent habeas rights.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In other words, they are\nsaying that the failure to object does not\nconstitute -- would constitute a procedural bar if we\nelected to treat it that way, but we've decided not\nto, but we're nevertheless going to rely on the\nfailure to object to justify a higher standard of\nreview on harmless error?\nMR. CRUZ: That's exactly correct, Justice\nStevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is there any precedent\nfor that ambivalent use of a potential procedural\nbar?\nMR. CRUZ: Let me suggest it's not an\nambivalent use, but rather what the Court of Criminal\nAppeals has held, in the Black case it held that\nPenry I was so novel that the State courts would\nexcuse a failure to preserve for purposes of\nprocedural bar. So in this regard the State court is\nmore forgiving to defendant than the Federal courts\nare.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: General Cruz, none of\nthis went on in the opinion and there were four\njudges of that court who said there's a procedural\nbar here, end of case. The majority never explained\nwhy they weren't going along with that. I didn't see\nanything in the majority opinion that said, well,\nnever mind that there's a procedural bar here, we're\ngoing to deal with the Federal question.\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Ginsburg, you're right\nthat in Smith I, the Court of Criminal Appeals, the\nmajority did not explain why there wasn't a\nprocedural bar. But there had been a long line of\ncases where the CCA had decided Penry errors were not\ngoing to bar access to the courthouse, and just last\nweek in another decision that was decided after\nbriefing in the case, in the In Re Hood case, the\nCourt of Criminal Appeals made clear that in its\njudgment Penry II was also so novel that for purposes\nof successive risk it would excuse a failure to\npreserve.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The simple\nquestion is the procedural objection, as the four\njudges suggested, could have precluded consideration\nof the Federal claim at all.\nMR. CRUZ: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the court said\nwe're going to go ahead and consider it, and then\nwhen it turns out that they got it wrong and there\nwas error they had to apply harmless error review.\nIn Texas law, harmless error review turns on the\nstandard whether there was an objection or not, and\nthey went back and said there was no objection. The\ncontrary assertions assumes that when they let the\nclaim go forward, that they were waiving any reliance\non objection for any purposes, not consideration on\nthe merits, but also for any eventual later\nconsideration on harmless error pursuant to the\nestablished State standard.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Cruz, would you\nclarify one thing for me? Did the Texas Court of\nAppeals say in effect, there is a procedural bar but\nwe're going to waive it, or did they just not address\nthe issue?\nMR. CRUZ: In Black they said exactly what\nyou say.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: How about in this case?\nMR. CRUZ: In this case they didn't --\nthey didn't say because longstanding CCA\nprecedent made clear that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, you're assuming\nthere's longstanding precedents. It is also at least\nconceivable that at the time they thought the\nobjection was properly preserved.\nMR. CRUZ: It is conceivable, but I would\nsuggest the more reasonable inference is they\nfollowed their long line of precedents that said\nwe're not going to interpose, as the Chief Justice\nsuggests, a total bar to raising these claims. So\nfor procedural default and for successive writs,\nwe're not going to penalize Petitioners for failing\nto make objections. Just because the State court\ndecides to be more lenient than the Federal courts in\nthat respect does not mean that they also need to\napply the lesser standard of --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you're assuming that\nthey decided to be more lenient rather than assuming\nthat they may have actually decided and rejected the\nprocedural bar.\nMR. CRUZ: Well --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's at least possible\non this record, is it not?\nMR. CRUZ: They did not say one way or the\nother the first time.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. But isn't the\nimplausibility of the argument that you are making\nsomething like this: You say the Texas rule is not\nthat failure to object is a procedural bar but that\nfailure to object determines the standard of harmless\nerror review if in fact there is a later appeal. The\nimplausibility, though, I guess of the position is\nthat as I understand it, four members of the Texas\nCriminal Court of Appeals did not understand that to\nbe the case at all. Four of them said it is a\nprocedural bar. The four did not understand that\nthere was this rule that you invoke, and when the\nfour said there is a procedural bar, the majority of\nthe court never came out and said no, there isn't.\nMR. CRUZ: The most reasonable explanation\nfor that, Justice Souter, I would suggest is at the\ntime of Smith III the Court had not decided Hood,\nwhich means it had not concluded that Penry II was\nalso so novel that it would forgive failure to raise\nit.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't the consequence of\nthat, though, that for purposes of this case there\nwas no clear State bar at the time in question and\ntherefore, they cannot apply it now? Maybe they can\napply it in cases down the road. I'll assume for the\nsake of argument that they can. But not in your\ncase, because the bar was not established at the\nrelevant time in your case.\nMR. CRUZ: That would arguably be the case\nif on remand the Court of Criminal Appeals had\napplied procedural default and refused to consider\nthe case -- the claim, but not what it did.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But what it is\ndoing is in effect saying there was a kind of default\nwhich is subsumed in what the four dissenting\njustices said the first time around. And so we're\ngoing to, we're going to sort of call it a half-loaf\nprocedural default, but we never said so the first\ntime around.\nMR. CRUZ: Respectfully, they are\naltogether separate concepts that procedural default\nis a total bar to the courthouse.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I can understand that\nthey would be separate concepts if there were a rule\nor if there had been a rule in place at the time he\nwas going through his State habeas that so said. But\nwe don't seem to have such a rule because as you\nsaid, there was disagreement within the court, and\nHood had not been decided, and therefore --\nMR. CRUZ: But Black had.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Pardon me?\nMR. CRUZ: Black had and Almanza had.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Black being -- help me\nout, Black?\nMR. CRUZ: Black is what excused the\nfailure to raise Penry I for novelty. And so it was\nclearly established State law at the time of this\ntrial --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that goes to Penry I,\nand this is then an objection both to Penry I and\nbased on Penry II.\nMR. CRUZ: But the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So it's --\nMR. CRUZ: But the Hood -- the Hood\ndecision with respect to Penry II is being forgiving\nto criminal defendant. It's not a bar. It's\nforgiving a bar. That does not mean that the Almanza\nstandard which had been present for -- has been\npresent in State law for over 20 years is suddenly\ninadequate.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You're right.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But did they cite that\ncase in this case, in this opinion in this case?\nMR. CRUZ: They absolutely cited Almanza.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Speaking of that case,\ncan you give me any citation? And just give me a\ncitation, and here there may not be one, but you give\nme a citation where Texas previously said that a\ndefendant who raised an objection before trial to the\napplication of the statute to his client, he said\nit's unconstitutional as applied to my client, give\nme one example in Texas law where that was raised and\nthe State appeals court of any -- at any level said,\nI'm very sorry, you can't really appeal that because\nyou should have said it again during the trial.\nMR. CRUZ: Respectfully, Justice Breyer,\nthat is not what we are urging, and I'm very glad you\nasked that question because I'd like to clarify what\nwe are urging in our brief. That is not why we think\nSmith is not defaulted.\nJUSTICE BREYER: In other words, there's\nno case, there's no case in Texas law which says what\nI just said?\nMR. CRUZ: I don't know if there is or not\nbut our --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You can't say.\nMR. CRUZ: Our argument is not based on\nthe timing of the objection, so it has nothing to do\nwith when he did or didn't raise his objection. And\nso --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought it was because\nhe didn't raise it again in the trial.\nMR. CRUZ: That is not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is the argument?\nMR. CRUZ: The argument is that he made a\ndifferent objection, a substantively different\nobjection, because what he filed was an argument that\nthe Texas death penalty was unconstitutional on its\nface across the board and as applied to him, and he\nmade a conscious strategic choice which is, when the\njudge presented a charge to the counsel and said do\nyou have any objections, do you have any suggestions,\nis there any way I can change it, he could have done\nwhat Penry's counsel did. Penry's counsel twice\nasked the judge, please instruct the jury on\ndeliberateness so they can consider my mitigating\nevidence for deliberateness. Penry I said that would\nsolve the Penry problem.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No. But in this case\nthe counsel for the defendant did one other thing,\nand it said to the judge, you don't have authority\nunder State law to add to these supplemental\ninstructions. And I was going to ask you, he was\nright about that, wasn't he?\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Kennedy, he was\ncategorically wrong about that, and that\nfundamentally --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Really?\nMR. CRUZ: Yes. For two reasons. Number\none, because Penry I, which has already been decided,\nthis Court has said the way to correct a Penry error\nis to give an instruction. And the Court of Criminal\nAppeals following Penry had already squarely held the\nway to correct a Penry error is to give an\ninstruction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What instruction? I\nhaven't seen one. I haven't seen --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Was it the nullification\ninstruction?\nMR. CRUZ: That's what the Court of\nCriminal Appeals has said Penry I said, a\ndeliberateness instruction or a catch-all\ninstruction. So -- but in both cases, both this\nCourt and the State court have said judges can give\nan instruction. And Penry I's counsel made --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is your instruction --\nI think this is of some importance. My understanding\nin this case is that the judge as well as counsel\nthought that the judge couldn't say in essence what\nbecame the Texas law because the legislature put it\nin, which is: Jury, is it two special issues, but\nyou can consider all the mitigating evidence and it's\nup to you if you think that mitigating evidence is\nenough to have a life rather than a death sentence.\nThat I thought the judge couldn't do. I have not\nseen a prelegislative change, charge in Texas that\nsays what the legislature provided.\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Ginsburg, that is in\nfact what the judge did here. What the judge could\ndo clearly under Texas law is give any reasonable\ninstruction to cure the error. What the judge\ncouldn't do is submit a third special issue. It\ncouldn't ask the jury, check, is there enough\nmitigating evidence to sentence to death. So it\ncouldn't change the output from the jury. It\ncouldn't add a new special issue but it could give\nany instruction possible to correct the error. That\nwas Texas law, that you could give instructions, but\nthe special issues are set by statute.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And so the jury, what\nthey take into the jury room is something that says\nthese are the two questions that you must answer.\nMR. CRUZ: But they also have a written\ncharge, so they get a written charge with the\ninstruction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Which tells them that\nthe only way that they can give effect to mitigating\nevidence is if they answer one of those questions\nfalsely.\nMR. CRUZ: But this Court said in both\nPenry I and Penry II that if the trial judge defined\ndeliberateness appropriately, even under the old\nspecial issues, that it could solve the problem.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But in this case the\njudge said I'm going to give the nullification\ninstruction, and the attorney said, and I think quite\nproperly, he said that won't work.\nMR. CRUZ: But what the attorney -- the\nattorney didn't say that won't work because it puts\njurors in an ethical quandary, it causes them to\nviolate the oath. What the attorney said is, you can\ngive no instructions. And the reason for that\nstrategic choice is that Smith's counsel made the\njudgment, I want it to be impossible for my client to\nbe subject to the death penalty.\nHad Smith's counsel made the same\nobjection that Penry made, had he read Penry right in\nfront of him and asked, give me a deliberateness\ninstruction, it would have cured the error. But the\nreason I would suggest that Smith's counsel didn't is\nthat the quantum of mitigating evidence in this case\nwas so slight compared to the pervious cases that he\nmade a very conscious strategic choice, I'd rather go\nall or nothing. I would rather make an argument that\nthere is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: General Cruz, how can\nyou make that assumption when the kind of mitigating\nevidence that has been considered possible within\nthese special questions, the -- the -- in the Graham\ncase where the reputation of this young man, he was\nsweet, gentle, kind, God fearing, and so the murder\nthat he committed was an aberration. And youth.\nThose are the two things that I know that we have\nrecognized fall within that. The evidence in this\ncase is surely not that we are dealing with a sweet\nand kind person. We are dealing with somebody who\nhas been abused as a child and who has a mental\ndisorder.\nMR. CRUZ: Respectfully, Justice Ginsburg,\nthe evidence was precisely that he had been sweet and\nkind. Over 90 percent of the evidence that defense\ncounsel relied on in closing was the 15 character\nwitnesses to show that he was a big lovable Teddy\nbear and went to church, and was sweet and kind, and\nhe had overcome these obstacles, and this was a\nmomentary aberration. That was the central theme of\ndefense's arguments. And in fact when the court --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: When you say 90 percent,\nyou're talking about argument time, aren't you?\nMR. CRUZ: I'm talking --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Your answer to that is,\nthere were several hundred pages of records from\nschool and the testing that went on in school that\nindicated there was something seriously wrong with\nthis guy.\nMR. CRUZ: Well -- and it's interesting.\nThe several hundred pages they talk about, there are\nthree IQ tests that he had gotten. When he was 7\nyears old he tested at 87; when he was 10 years old\nhe tested at 87; when he was 13 he tested at 78.\nThey -- and they introduced all three. These were\nthe school records. There weren't competing experts.\nIt's interesting in closing arguments --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Maybe -- but\nthe fact is that we're talking right now about sort\nof quantum of evidence. Was there something serious\nthere for the jury to consider which in effect is the\nbasis for all of this argument? And it seems to me\nit's not fairly characterized by saying, well, 90\npercent of the mitigation case was that he was sweet\nand loving there. Whether you find it -- whether you\nfind it persuasive or not, there was a substantial\namount of evidence of -- going to his mental capacity\nand to his abuse.\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Souter, not only was it\na very small part of the presentation, but in closing\nargument defense counsel explicitly pointed out to\nthe jury that -- and let me read from defense\ncounsel's closing: \"I think it speaks well for both\nsides, the State and the defense to be quite honest,\nthat we didn't bring you some hired gun, some\npsychiatrist that gets paid to get up here and say oh\nwell, these are all family problems.\" And that is at\n33, volume 33 of the record, page 59.\nHe affirmatively -- in Penry the whole\nargument was there's IQ problems, there's serious\nabuse. There's no abuse in this case, Justice\nGinsburg, no allegation of abuse whatsoever. And he\naffirmatively said to the jury, look, we're not\nrelying on some psychiatrist saying there are all\nthese family problems. Our story is that this is a\ngood person who led a good life and this is an\naberration.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Cruz. Mr. Schaerr.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GENE C. SCHAERR\nON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA, ET AL.,\nAS AMICI CURIAE SUPPORTING RESPONDENT\nMR. SCHAERR: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nI represent California and 20 other states\nwho are concerned about the implications of\nPetitioner's arguments for their ability to apply\ntheir own varied harmless error standards in their\nown State habeas proceedings, and thereby to strike\nwhat they believe to be the right balance between the\ntwo competing concerns that this Court identified in\nCalderon. One being the significant social costs of\nretrial or resentencing, and the other the desire to\nensure that the extraordinary remedy of habeas corpus\nis available to those whom society has grievously\nwronged.\nAnd with those concerns in mind, I'd like\nto address three specific points. The first is the\nwhole question of whether States have the ability\nunder our Federal Constitution to choose their own\nharmless error standards even when they are\naddressing Federal error. Petitioner appears to\nconcede as a general matter that States do have that\nauthority, but let me just briefly indicate why that\nconcession is well founded.\nFirst of all, as this Court has held in\nPennsylvania versus Finley --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Are you talking about\nboth collateral review and direct review, or just\ncollateral review?\nMR. SCHAERR: I'm just talking about\ncollateral review right now.\nAs this Court has held in Pennsylvania\nversus Finley, the States are under no obligation to\nprovide collateral review at all, and so it would be\nextraordinary if they take the step of deciding that\nthey will provide such review, for this Court to say,\nwell, if you're going to do that you have to apply a\nFederal standard on State habeas review rather than\nthe standard that you choose.\nSecondly, to the extent the States decide\nto provide habeas review or any other kind of\npost-conviction review, the authority by which they\ndo that derives from State law, not from the Federal\nConstitution or any other Federal law, and this Court\nobviously does not have general supervisory authority\nover, over State courts as it does Federal courts.\nAnd third, unlike the situation with\ndirect review, this Court could not as a practical\nmatter impose a Federal standard on State habeas\nproceedings without being highly intrusive. I mean\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: In, in this case suppose\nthe following circumstance. Suppose a Federal court\nhas decided in the case of this defendant --\nMR. SCHAERR: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- there was an error of\nFederal constitutional law, search and seizure or\nconfessions or something, and now we send it back.\nAnd let's suppose further the State has no\nindependent State ground, they are not trying to make\nthe argument, whether or not they're trying to make\nit here. There's no independent State ground, no\nobjection to problem, nothing. Now, I read that one\nstandard that could be applied is the structural\nerror standard. A second is a harmless error\nstandard. But I've never seen a case, but that's\nperhaps my ignorance -- -that's whey want you to show\nme -- where it's definitively established by a\nFederal court anyway that there was a serious Federal\nerror, I've never seen a case where this Court said,\nor I can't recall one, that the State applied yet\nsome third kind of standard, such as, well, I know\nthere was a very important error, I know it was\nFederal and constitutional, but nonetheless we're not\ngoing to give them any remedy unless it's absolutely\negregious harm. I've never seen that in the law.\nNow, can you point to me in the law where,\nwhich will correct my lacuna?\nMR. SCHAERR: I'm not aware that the Court\nhas expressly addressed that precise question, which\nI think is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Have you ever seen it in\na State? Have you ever seen a State which gets a\ncase back from --\nMR. SCHAERR: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Where? Where should I\nlook on that?\nMR. SCHAERR: Well, our amicus brief, Your\nHonor, cites, cites dozens of cases in which, in\nwhich States have addressed Federal --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I'm not talking\nabout that because obviously they can do what they\nwant, I think, in the State courts, but they might\nviolate Federal law if they do it. And now so what's\nhappened is somebody has gone into Federal court or\nthis Court and Federal court or this Court has said:\nHere's a Federal error, of course you're free to\napply harmless error or whatever, you don't have to\nlet the person have a new trial or let him out.\nBut I've never seen an instance I can\nthink of where, that having happened, the State then\napplied yet some third standard like absolutely\negregious horrible harm or not totally wonderful harm\nor something like that. I've never seen. That's\nwhat I'm looking for. Is there such an instance?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or plain error, as\napplied in the Federal cases under Alano.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, that's possible.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is there some reason,\nMr. Schaerr, why that would be more egregious when\nthe Federal constitutional question has been answered\nby a Federal district court than it is when the\nFederal constitutional question has been answered by\nthe State supreme court? Wouldn't it be just as bad\nwhen the State supreme court has said the Federal\nConstitution has been violated and then the case goes\nback to the lower State court and the lower State\ncourt applies some standard for plain error which is,\nwhich is simply different from what is, what is being\nurged here today. I'm sure that happens all the\ntime.\nMR. SCHAERR: I'm sure it does.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And I don't know why it's\nany worse, any worse when you do it to a Federal\ndistrict court's determination of what the Federal\nConstitution says than when you do it to the State\nsupreme court's determination of what the Federal\nConstitution says.\nMR. SCHAERR: That's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I guess the reason would\nbe that there is a problem with enforcing Federal\nconstitutional standards. I have not heard of a\nState that says, suppose the jury was chosen in a\nracially discriminatory way, suppose there are all\nkinds of things, the State says, well, we admit, we\nadmit that there is this violation, but we're just\nnot going to apply a harmless error standard. We're\ngoing to apply a tough one. I guess that would be\nthe reason. That's why I don't think I've ever seen\nit.\nMR. SCHAERR: Right, and the question is\nwhether the State is free in that circumstance to\napply a State harmless error standard or if it has to\nbe required to apply a Federal harmless error\nstandard. And our -- and the fact is that on the\nground the States are routinely applying State\nharmless error standards in those situations. And so\nit would be a sea change if this Court were to now\nhold that, no, when a State court is reviewing the\neffect of a Federal error that the State court has to\napply a Federal standard rather than the State.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is there any special\nFederal harmless error standard that applies to\nunpreserved error?\nMR. SCHAERR: I think it's the Alano\nstandard, at least in the Federal --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, that's for Federal,\nthat's in the Federal courts. But there isn't one\nthat's applicable able to the State courts, is there?\nMR. SCHAERR: No, no. There isn't.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we haven't had the\nissue before us, have we? That's why you're here.\nMR. SCHAERR: That's why I'm here, that's\nright.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: This question is a\nlittle different. If you had two harmless errors in\na given State, do they have to apply them\nconsistently?\nMR. SCHAERR: Well, then the question\nwould be is there some Federal law reason why they\nhave to. I mean, they may under State law have to\napply them --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In other words, if for\nexample the higher standard only applies to\nunpreserved error and the record clearly establishes\nand the several State judges confirm there was no\nunpreserved error, then would there not be a duty to\napply the lower standard?\nMR. SCHAERR: There may be under State\nlaw, it's not clear why that would raise a Federal\nissue.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And if the State follows\nthe rule in just one exceptional case before the\nFederal court, can the court said, hey, you're not\nfollowing your regular rule?\nMR. SCHAERR: Well, there may be a due\nprocess objection to that, but here the only\nobjection --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there no Federal\ninterest in ensuring that there is a full and fair\nimplementation of a Federal right? And if the State\nhigher standard is erroneously applied, doesn't that\nprejudice the Federal right?\nMR. SCHAERR: Well, that may be one reason\nwhy we have Federal habeas proceedings.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that reason would\napply equally, however, to determinations of Federal\nrights by State courts.\nMR. SCHAERR: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And I think everybody\nunderstands that State courts do this all the time,\nand indeed a good way to do an end run around what,\nwhat, what the other side in this case seems to want\nis simply for the State supreme court to find a\nviolation of Federal law so that it doesn't get to a\nFederal court and then have the State lower court\napply whatever harmless error standard it wishes,\nwhich would be a crazy system.\nMR. SCHAERR: That's right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So if you're going to\nadopt this rule, this rule would have to be adopted\nnot only for references back to the State court from\na Federal decision, but you would surely have to\napply it to all State determinations of Federal law,\nand I don't really know what authority we would have\nto require lower State courts to do that.\nMR. SCHAERR: Well, that's, that's exactly\nright and especially in the habeas context it would\nbe, it would be extremely intrusive and invasive for\nthis Court to attempt to do that. It's one thing on\ndirect review of a State criminal conviction to say\nas a matter of Federal constitutional law we think\nthere was an error here and we're going to nullify\nthe conviction, which is what the Constitution gives\nthis Court the power to do. But it's quite another,\nafter the conviction is final and the defendant is\nalready incarcerated, then on a State habeas\nproceeding for the issue to come, to come back to\nthis Court, it would be extraordinary for this Court\nto say, well, you have to apply Federal standards or\nFederally dictated procedures in that circumstance.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\ncounsel.\nMr. Steiker, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JORDAN STEIKER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. STEIKER: I'd like to return to the\nrecord in this case because I think once it's\nclarified what the nature of the evidence was in this\ncase it's clear that this Court could find that the\nerror was harmful under any standard, including the\negregious harm standard. We have in this case over\n200 pages of exhibits documenting a lifelong\ndisability. This evidence was first introduced in\nthe guilt-innocence phase of the trial. It was\nargued at the guilt-innocence closing argument, in\nwhich trial counsel said, this is a 19-year-old ninth\ngrader who has been charged with this crime, and\nargued that that was the basis for considering him\nless culpable than his college-educated co-defendant.\nDuring the punishment phase, it's clear\nthat the single most important witness, the one whose\ntestimony was the most central, the most\ntime-consuming, was Alberta Pingle, who brought in\nall of the school records showing from at the time\nthe Petitioner was in school he had been diagnosed as\na learning disabled, possibly organic in nature, 78\nIQ. And his counsel emphasized this as the central\nbasis for withholding a death sentence. He said,\nthis man has a 78 IQ, 8 points from being mentally\nretarded, lifelong learning disabilities, possibly\norganic in nature.\nAnd the argument that there was no\nevidence of abuse in this case is belied by the fact\nthat the evidence showed that Petitioner's father\nchased him with a butcher knife in order to steel the\nfamily's car in order to support his crack habit. If\nthat's not evidence of abuse and evidence that could\nshow reduced culpability for this defendant, coupled\nespecially with his impairment which made him less\ncapable of responding to that role model and avoiding\ndangerous behavior --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about\nGeneral, Mr. Cruz's comments that this was a minor\npoint in counsel's summation before the jury?\nMR. STEIKER: It is true that this\nevidence was presented as only one page of his\nclosing argument, but that was because of the problem\nin this case. As this Court noted in its summary\nreversal, the prosecutor got up right before defense\ncounsel and said: You promised us on voir dire you\nwould answer the special issues honestly and that if\nthe evidence supported a yes answer to deliberateness\nand dangerousness you would give us yes answers.\nBasically, right before he spoke the prosecutor gave\nan anti-nullification instruction which said this\nevidence isn't relevant to the special issues of\ndeliberateness and dangerousness.\nIn that posture, he was left to argue that\nthe evidence showed he wasn't dangerous, that the\nevidence showed he didn't act deliberately, and just\nhope that the jury would be willing to lie on the\nspecial verdict form.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is this argument\nan assertion that the Texas State court was wrong in\nits determination of this question of Texas State\nlaw?\nMR. STEIKER: His argument --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, your argument\nright now.\nMR. STEIKER: I'm sorry. I don't\nunderstand.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is your argument\nan argument that the Texas State court was wrong on\nits ruling under Texas State law harmless error.\nMR. STEIKER: No. Our argument is that\nwhen you take out the clearly impermissible Federal\nconclusion that the jury could give effect to this\nevidence, which was exactly what this Court said to\nthe contrary in its summary reversal -- this Court\nsaid this evidence couldn't be considered. The State\ncourt said he has extensive evidence, he has powerful\nevidence, powerfully presented, dramatically\npresented, but we think, unlike the Supreme Court,\nthat a carefully crafted nullification instruction\nwill facilitate the jurors' consideration of it.\nSo if you take away the impermissible\nFederal conclusion, this Court could clearly\nconceive, conclude, on the basis of the State court's\nown characterization of this evidence, which departs\ntremendously from the Respondent's view, that this\nwas powerful mitigating evidence. The Court of\nCriminal Appeals' error was to conclude that this\ncould be taken into account after this Court said\nexactly the opposite.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n"
