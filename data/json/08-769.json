        "content": "(10:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear, first,\nthis morning, Case 08-769, United States v. Stevens.\nMr. Katyal.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. KATYAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nTen years ago, in Section 48 of Title 18,\nCongress crafted a narrowly targeted restriction against\ncertain depictions of actual animal cruelty. Yet the\nThird Circuit struck the statute down on its face\nwithout even attempting to apply substantial overbreadth\nanalysis. The statute has four critical features and,\njust as the Court last year in United States v. Williams\nbegan with statutory construction, analysis should begin\nthere.\nFirst, like the statute at issue in the\nUnited States v. Ferber, this statute only reaches\ndepictions of cruelty to actual living beings --\nanimals, not simulated ones or the written word.\nSecond, the statute only applies to\ncommercial messages, ones that Congress found drove the\nmarket for animal cruelty.\nThird, the statute examines the work as a\nwhole --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What record do you have\nof that fact?\nMR. KATYAL: Before Congress?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes.\nMR. KATYAL: Before Congress -- Congress had\na bunch of testimony that showed that there were\nextensive -- there was a robust market in animal cruelty\nvideos, largely focusing on crush videos -- 2 to 3,000\ncrush videos that were in -- that were -- that were\nbeing sold at the time.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That I understand, but\ncrush videos is only one species of cruelty to animals.\nWhat evidence was there that, for example, dog fighting\nhad as large and robust a market or that hunting videos\nin those States in which hunting was illegal had a\nrobust market, et cetera?\nMR. KATYAL: Well, hunting we think is\nexcluded, and I could talk about that in a moment, from\nthe reach of the act. Congress spoke in general terms,\nand I don't think that Mr. Stevens's statement at page\n13 of his merits brief, which is to the effect that\nCongress repeatedly disavowed any attempt to regulate\nanimal fighting -- dog fighting -- I don't think that is\ncorrect and the record does not support that.\nCongress spoke in general terms. They had a\nfor-profit commercial market about animal cruelty, and\nthe statute dealt with it in general terms. And they\nreasoned that by -- by punishing the sale of these\nvideotapes, they would get at the underlying clandestine\nmarket --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What do you mean by a\n\"for-profit commercial market\"? You mean anything that\nis sold, right?\nMR. KATYAL: That is -- that is correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. KATYAL: Yes.\nAnd the Third Circuit's decision in this\ncase struck down the statute with respect to crush\nvideos, with respect to the sale of video -- the\ncreation of dog fighting videotapes, because, remember,\nthe statute, Section 48, doesn't just encompass the --\nthe sale of videotapes. It also encompasses the\ncreation of dog fighting videotapes. And, yet, the --\nthe Third Circuit struck that down as well. That, I\nthink, was a fundamental error under this Court's\nprinciples, most particularly, United States v.\nWilliams, which says that the statute should only be\nstruck down if there is a substantial -- if there is\nsubstantial overbreadth and only if it is a last resort\nof the Court, not the first.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What would you -- if\nyou could do it in one sentence, what is your test for\ndetermining which categories of speech are unprotected\nby the First Amendment?\nMR. KATYAL: In one sentence, if -- if -- if\nCongress sees a compelling interest in regulating the\nmeans of production and does not target the underlying\ncontent, they can -- they can regulate a depiction, so\nlong as it leaves alternative mechanisms for that\nexpression in -- in place, and that is I think what\nFerber --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay. And what case --\nwhat case do you have for that proposition?\nMR. KATYAL: United States v. Ferber -- New\nYork v. Ferber. In Ferber, the Court -- the Court\ndealt, as modified or as glossed by your decision in\nFree Speech Coalition, because what Ferber and Free\nSpeech Coalition together say is that Congress was\nnot -- or the legislature, was not targeting the\ncontents of a depiction; rather, it was trying to get at\nand dry up the underlying market, child exploitation in\nthat case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Katyal, the Court\nsummarily dealt with a case some years ago, American\nBooksellers v. Hudnut, where cities attempted to make\nnot even a criminal offense, but the subject of a civil\nsuit, a violent depiction -- depictions of women as\nsexual objects enjoying pain and humiliation and\ndegradation.\nThe Seventh Circuit said that that was a\nblatant violation of the First Amendment, to go after\npurveyors who show these women in the shocking,\ndegrading photographs, and I believe we summarily\naffirmed.\nMR. KATYAL: And this case is fundamentally\ndifferent from all of those because here Congress is not\naiming at the underlying communicative impact. It's not\nsaying, as it was in the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, of course it is. I\nmean, you can't separate the means from the end and say,\nsince its end is simply to prevent the -- the activity,\nthe means, which is to prevent the communication, is\nokay. It is targeting the communication of videos that\ndepict this conduct.\nMR. KATYAL: Quite to the contrary, Justice\nScalia. The bona fides of this statute are evident\nright on its face, because the very same depictions that\nMr. Stevens or anyone else swept up under the statute\nwants to portray, they can -- they can do it, so long as\nthey use simulated or images.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but to say\nthat they are not concerned with the content, I -- I\nthink is contradicted by the exceptions. You have to\nlook at the content and make a decision, is this bona\nfide scientific, journalistic, educational, historical?\nSo you have to look at the content to determine whether\nor not the speech is prohibited.\nMR. KATYAL: I don't think so, for two\nreasons. I think what Congress is dealing with with the\nexemptions clause in this statute was just reflecting\nthe underlying nature of the market that they saw in\n1999, a for-profit commercial market in cruelty.\nAnd so they exempted educational depictions,\nreligious, and so on, because that wasn't what was\ndriving the underlying market for crush videos --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How can you tell\nthese aren't political videos? You do have, with\norganizations, PETA and others, depictions of the same\nsort of animal cruelty that is used to generate support\nfor efforts to prohibit it. Why aren't these videos the\nexact opposite, you know, efforts to legalize it, and,\nin each case, it would fall under the political\nexemption?\nMR. KATYAL: And often they will fall under\nthat exemption. My point is that Congress carved a\nbroad exemption in Section 48 precisely to make sure\nthat expressive messages aren't swept up.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you -- could you\ntell me what the difference is between these video and\nDavid Roma's documentary on pit bulls? I mean, David\nRoma's documentary had much, much more footage on the\nactual animal cruelty than the films at issue here,\ngreater sections of the film, and more explicit.\nIn this film, the -- the Respondent didn't\nlet the video show the actual tearing of the jaw. David\nRoma's did much more than that, showed much more than\nthat. So isn't -- doesn't there have to be a judgment\ninherent in this statute?\nMR. KATYAL: The line will sometimes be\ndifficult to draw, just as its difficult to draw in\nchild pornography --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it's not in child\npornography because, there, Congress says the very\nact -- it doesn't matter how artistic it is. That very\nact of child pornography is illegal.\nMR. KATYAL: Quite to the contrary, Justice\nSotomayor. In this -- this Court approved, in Osborne\nv. Ohio, a statute that's on child pornography, that had\nthe following exemption: For a, quote, \"bona fide\nartistic, educational, religious, governmental,\njudicial, or other purpose by or to a physician,\npsychologist, sociologist, persons pursuing bona fide\nresearch studies, a judge or other persons having a\nproper interest in the material or performance.\"\nAnd this Court pointed to that exemptions\nclause to make the statute constitutional at two -- at\ntwo pages in that opinion. And so this Court has\nalready gone down the path of saying these decisions are\ntough to make on a case-by-case basis, but nonetheless\nthe legislature should have a freer hand to act when it\nis regulating, not the expressive message, but targeting\nthe underlying content, the -- targeting the underlying\nproduction, not the content.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Child -- child pornography\nis obscenity as far as I am concerned, and it has been\ntreated as part of that same traditional classification\nwhich there has always been permission for the\ngovernment to prohibit. This is something quite\ndifferent.\nI mean, you know, what if -- what if I -- I\nam an aficionado of bullfights and I think, contrary to\nthe animal cruelty people, I think it -- they enoble\nboth beast and man, and I want to persuade people that\nbullfights are terrific and we should have them.\nI would -- I would not be able to -- to\nmarket videos showing people how exciting a bullfight\nis. Right? I would be able to talk and say, oh, you\nshould really allow bullfights, but I cannot make the\nmost significant point that I want to make, get people\nto watch it.\nMR. KATYAL: I want to answer your\nhypothetical, but if I could just have 20 seconds or so\nto -- to respond more generally to all of these\nhypotheticals which I think are going to reoccur in the\ncourse of our conversation.\nWe believe that Section 48 will have\nas-applied constitutional challenges that will be\ninferred from case to case. But what this Court has\nsaid is that, in your decision, Justice Scalia, in\nUnited States v. Williams, is that we should be careful\nabout that endless stream of fanciful hypotheticals\nprecisely because the test under substantial\noverbreadth, which knocks an entire act of Congress out\non its face, is that there must be a realistic danger\nthat the statute will be applied in -- in the manner the\nhypothetical suggests.\nWith respect to your bullfighting\nhypothetical, there is no realistic danger.\nWe have had ten years of experience under the statute.\nCongress itself said -- the legislative history, which I\nknow will not be of relevance to you but may to others\non the Court -- they explicitly exempted Spanish\nbullfighting and said that is the paradigmatic case of\nwhat is educational and artistic and the like.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What if I made --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait. Wait. I don't\nunderstand that. Any depiction of bullfighting is\neducational?\nMR. KATYAL: Spanish depictions of\nbullfighting --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that is true because\nCongress said so?\nMR. KATYAL: Well, that is true because it\nis educational, and -- and a prosecutor would bear the\nburden of proof.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I guess a dogfight is\neducational, too.\nMR. KATYAL: And some dogfights certainly\nare, which is my answer to Justice Sotomayor's question.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, look what you have\ndone, and this is what is bothering me. You take these\nwords, which are a little vague, some of them, \"serious\nreligious, political, scientific, educational,\njournalistic, historical, or artistic value,\" and you\nsay that's a standard that a judge or prosecutor will\napply. And people have to understand it because they\nhave to know what to do to avoid the risk of being\nprosecuted.\nNow, as I have gotten out of these briefs,\nyou then require people to apply that standard, not\nsimply to the crush videos or to the dogfighting, but\nalso to, as Justice Scalia pointed out, bullfighting,\nsheep hunting, bear hunting, deer hunting, fox hunting,\nhumane slaughter, and for, I think somewhere I found,\nthe stuffing geese for pate de fois gras.\nAll right, so there is a whole long -- quail\nhunting. There's a whole long list in here of things\nthat people might want to do. They won't know if it\nfalls within this exemption. Nobody in every State\nwants to forbid these things. Sometimes they are,\nsometimes they are not. They won't know whether or not\nthey can make this particular film, picture, or other.\nThat's the overbreadth argument. And I would like to\nhear your response.\nMR. KATYAL: We have had ten years of\nexperience, Justice Breyer, under the statute, and we\nhaven't seen those things being chilled. Indeed,\nRespondents --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you give me an example\nof a case where we said a statute which might otherwise\nbe overbroad is not overbroad because prosecutors have\nbeen restrained? Can you give me one case where we've\nsaid that?\nMR. KATYAL: Last year in United States v.\nWilliams, an opinion that virtually every member of this\nCourt joined, including you, Justice Kennedy, this Court\nsaid that it would look to the experience, the\npost-Ferber experience, in prosecuting cases to decide\nwhether or not a -- two terms in the statute, \"promotes\"\nand \"presents,\" were vague and would raise the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that was a case where\nwe knew what the content was. The content was not\nsubject to an -- to an overbreadth challenge. The\ncontent was not.\nMR. KATYAL: Well, actually, Justice\nKennedy, the reason that came up in the case is because\nthere were hypotheticals being advanced such as\npolice -- a man who wants to call the police that says\nthat child pornography arrived in my -- in the mail and\nso on. And what the Court said is that even though the\nwords in the statute, just as the words in this statute,\ncould be read broadly or narrowly --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but that -- that\nwent to intent. It seems to me that -- let me tell you\nwhat I think your framework is and if it is wrong, tell\nme that it is wrong. This statute without the\nexceptions clause would be wildly overbroad. So you say\nit's not overly broad because of the exception or the\nsavings clause. I will call it the exceptions. But it\nseems to me that the exceptions must be then tested as\nto whether or not they are vague.\nMR. KATYAL: We do think that the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And you have you to show\nthat they are not vague.\nMR. KATYAL: We do think that the exceptions\nclause does some of the constitutional work to exclude\nsome of the hypotheticals like bullfighting and the\nlike. We do think the statute itself has a number of\nrestrictions built into it on its face to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But what is a -- what is\n\"and the like\"? How about cockfighting? What is the\ndifference between -- perhaps I missed something a few\nmoments ago -- between bullfighting, cockfighting,\ndogfighting? You say dogfighting is included, but\nbullfighting -- and I don't know where you put\ncockfighting.\nMR. KATYAL: Dogfighting and cockfighting\nare illegal in all 50 States and therefore would be\nswept up. Some certain depictions of dogfighting and\ncockfighting would be swept up, not all.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But what about\nbullfighting? Isn't that illegal in --\nMR. KATYAL: It may or may not be. There\naren't, at least, specific statutes generally dealing\nwith it, but --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What about hunting with a\nbow -- What about hunting with a bow and arrow out of\nseason?\nMR. KATYAL: Okay. So --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KATYAL: In hunting, as well as --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we -- have we\nfinished with the category of fights?\nMR. KATYAL: So let me just, to Justice\nGinsburg's question. Not all dogfighting videos are\nswept up by Section 48. There may be educational\nvideos, along the lines that Justice Sotomayor said,\nraised which are not swept up. Bullfighting is the same\nbasic thing. It's not that there is a categorical -- a\ncategorical exemption on bullfighting; it is rather that\nthere are certain ones that are educational and not,\njust like in child pornography.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What's the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So noneducational\nbullfighting would be prohibited? If I market this just\nbecause I think, boy, bullfighting is really exciting?\nMR. KATYAL: If it meets the other terms in\nthe statute, right. So commercial and things like that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. It is covered.\nMR. KATYAL: Now, with respect to hunting,\nhunting is generally not considered animal cruelty. And\nit doesn't --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but hunting with a bow\nand arrow, and some depictions of hunting are pretty --\nare pretty gruesome.\nMR. KATYAL: That's correct. And to the\nextent that it is something that resembles the terms of\nthe statute, the language of which is \"maimed,\nmutilated, tortured, wounded, or killed\" --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: \"Or killed.\" How do you\nlimit \"killed\" to cruel -- you say in your brief that\nit's noscitur ex sociis. But that's a doctrine that\nsays when you have a string of words, one of which has\nvarious meanings, which meaning it has depends upon the\nwords with which it is associated. So if you speak of\nstaples, staples -- what, thumb tacks, nails, and other\nfasteners, \"nails\" obviously doesn't mean toenails. It\nmeans a nail that is a fastener, the word \"nail\" having\nvarious meanings.\n\"Kill\" has one meaning, which is kill. And\nyou can -- you cannot limit that meaning just because in\naddition to killing you also prohibit torturing and\nother things. Do you have a single case where -- where\nthat doctrine is used not to give meaning to an\nambiguous word, but to limit the meaning of a word which\non its face is absolutely clear?\nMR. KATYAL: Yes, sir, Your Honor. I do.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is that?\nMR. KATYAL: That is the decision you wrote\nlast year in United States v. Williams, which interprets\nthe words \"promotes and presents,\" which you yourself in\nthe opinion said are capable of a wide variety of\nmeanings.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly.\nMR. KATYAL: And -- and here the word \"kill\"\nin context is a term that the statute --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, it's not susceptible to\na wide -- that's my whole point. It means kill.\nMR. KATYAL: It means killed in the context\nof a statute that is defining the words \"animal\ncruelty,\" and this Court has consistently said that the\ndefinition that is being defined by the legislature --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Some people think eating an\nanimal is animal cruelty. These people don't eat meat\nbecause it is the product of killing animals.\nMR. KATYAL: And the legislature under no\nway, shape, or form was targeting that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it shouldn't have\nsaid that, then.\nMR. KATYAL: Well, I think that it basically\ndid say that by using the words \"animal cruelty\" in the\nstatute. Now, if there's a disagreement about that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't have a single\ncase in which a -- an absolutely clear word like \"kill\"\nis given a more narrow meaning because of other words\nthat are different from that word.\nMR. KATYAL: Justice Scalia, in Leocal, this\nCourt defined the term \"crime of violence,\" which the\nINA had -- that the INA interpreted wrongly.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So you want to say \"cruelly\nkill\"?\nMR. KATYAL: That's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, \"cruelly kill\" is not\nexactly crystal clear. And therefore my question is\nwhy, given the need for you to save this statute to read\nso many words that are so general, those contained here\nthat I've read, cruelly kill, cruelly wound as opposed\nto just wound or kill. You are doing that in order to\nprevent chilling people who are engaging in activities\nthat aren't intended to be covered by this statute.\nWhy not do a simpler thing? Rather than let\nthe public guess as to what these words mean, ask\nCongress to write a statute that actually aims at those\nfrightful things that it was trying to prohibit. Now,\nthat can be done. I don't know why they couldn't do it.\nMR. KATYAL: And it could have been done in\nWilliams. It could have been done in the child\npornography cases, which also have vague terms. But\nwhat this Court has said is that using the substantial\noverbreadth doctrine to do that leaves gaping holes in\nplace. If we followed your invitation, Justice Breyer,\nwe would leave crush videos unprotected.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why? Why? You say a crush\nvideo, my description that I read of it, you would have\na strong case. I'm not saying you would win, I don't\nhave to decide that. But you have a very strong case.\nSo you say to Congress, write a statute that focuses on\nthat. You are worried about dog fighting, write a\nstatute that focuses on that, and moreover, talks about\nsomething unlawful in every state. I am not giving\nCongress advice, though I seem to be.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm just saying why -- why\ncan't you here write a statute that does not force the\ncourts into the work of interpreting these very vague\nwords to prevent the statute from being held\nunconstitutional?\nMR. KATYAL: Well, here I think we should\ngive Congress some credit, because what it actually did\nin the exemption clause was borrow this Court's own\njurisprudence from the obscenity context on exceptions\nlike literary, artistic, political and scientific. It\nhad found that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, would\nthis -- would a statute like this apply to humans be\nconstitutional? You can't depict videos of, say,\nviolent muggings or things of that sort?\nMR. KATYAL: Well, I think it would be\ncomplicated because Congress would have to find that by\ntargeting the underlying videos but leaving alternative\nsimulated mugging videos in place, somehow it would have\nreduced the market for muggings or something like that.\nI think that's very hard. And it goes to Justice\nGinsburg's question about whether this statute is aimed\nat the communicative of impact, which we don't think it\nis, or it is aimed at just reducing the first order\nproblem which is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the first order problem\noccurs in states where it is not illegal. These videos\nare taken in states where bullfighting or dog fighting\nor cock fighting is entirely legal. So, I don't know\nhow you distinguish a -- a movie which many people think\nthat violence in movie brutalizes people and causes\nviolence in people's action.\nWhy couldn't Congress, persuaded by these\npeople say, you know, you can't have -- cannot depict\ntorture? You know, these horror films that come out\naround Halloween, you can't depict that anymore. What\nis the difference between that and what you have done\nhere?\nMR. KATYAL: So dog fighting is illegal in\nall 50 states along with crush videos. I don't think\nthat -- there may be --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it isn't -- it\nisn't -- illegal in Japan, and part of the video here\nwere dog fights in Japan; legal where it occurred, no\ndifferent from bull fighting.\nMR. KATYAL: Right. This Court has dealt\nwith that in footnote 19 of Ferber in which it said that\njust because something is legal somewhere else, it's\noften very hard to figure out where the underlying\nmaterial is made. It doesn't have a GPS component.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that wasn't --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Justice Scalia spoke about\nthe aficionada of Spanish bullfighting. Suppose that I\nam an aficionado of the sort gladiatorial contests that\nused to take place in ancient Rome, and suppose that\nsome -- Rome or some other place decides that it wants\nto make money by staging these things and selling videos\nof them or broadcasting them live around the world. Do\nyou have any doubt that that could be prohibitive?\nMR. KATYAL: This is -- I'm sorry if I'm not\nfollowing the hypothetical. This is historical --\nJUSTICE ALITO: A gladiatorial contests\nwhere the gladiators fight to the death.\nMR. KATYAL: Right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you have any doubt that\nthat could be prohibited?\nMR. KATYAL: Well, it sounds like it would\nfall under the historical exemption, at least in the\nhypothetical as you have raised it. So, it wouldn't be\nprohibited by section 48 --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Who knows.\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, no, not under this\nstatute, under a different statute.\nMR. KATYAL: Well, I think that -- I think\nthat there again, it would raise some First Amendment\ninterest in suppressing historical -- historical\ninformation.\nNow, Justice Scalia, you said who knows. I\nthink the answer to that is that this statute places the\nburden of proof on the government in order to -- in\norder to prove that there is no historical or\neducational value.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If you dress up like an\nancient Roman, the whole thing is of historical\ninterest?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that it?\nMR. KATYAL: Justice Scalia, I do think that\nis the Court's own jurisprudence with respect to, for\nexample, obscenity and child pornography, both of which\nthis Court has accepted precisely those types of\nexceptions.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A different category. That\nis traditional First Amendment law that obscenity is not\nprotected. And child pornography, as far as I am\nconcerned, and I think as far as the Court is concerned\nis obscenity.\nMR. KATYAL: Well, I don't believe the Court\nhas actually read child pornography to be obscenity.\nThe rationale of Ferber --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Katyal, there is\nsomething quite different between Ferber, because the\nabuse of a child is occurring at the very time. As I\nunderstand it, Mr. Stevens was not a promoter of dog\nfights. He was just filming them. And so the -- the --\nthe simultaneous abuse of the child, it occurs only\nbecause the picture is being taken. The dog fight goes\non whether Mr. Stevens is there with his camera or not.\nMR. KATYAL: Let me say two things about\nthat. First Mr. Stevens, of course, even in the Japan\nvideos you mentioned, he sent his dogs to Japan to -- to\nfight. And this statute encompasses real time\ntransmissions of --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where it was legal for\nhim to do that.\nMR. KATYAL: It was, just -- again, like\nchild pornography and the like. The second --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It even -- what I would\nlike you to confront is that the very taking of the\npicture is the offense. That's the abuse of the child.\nThe abuse of the dog and the promotion of the fight is\nseparate from the filming of it.\nMR. KATYAL: I agree with that. And I don't\nthink that's what underlay either this Court's Ferber\ndecision or the free speech coalition. The move that\nFerber makes is to say that the legislature can target\nthe underlying loaded production, so long as it leaves\nalternative mechanisms for that same exact message to be\nspoken. And this statute does that. Mr. Stevens can\nproduce the exact same message, just as long as he\ndoesn't involve the torture or mutilation to an actual\nliving animal. And to compare this --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: His message is that getting\nanimals to fight is fun. That's his message.\nMR. KATYAL: And Congress hasn't stamped\nthat out.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: To say he -- you know, he\ncan convey that message in some other way, how else does\nhe do it?\nMR. KATYAL: With simulated messages, the\nwritten word. He has written an entire book about that.\nHe has a whole variety --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Simulated dog fights would\nbe okay under this statute?\nMR. KATYAL: Simulate -- absolutely. This\nstatute leaves that in place, Justice Scalia. That's\nthe key to understanding why this statute is not like\nthe traditional statutes that come before this Court in\nwhich the government asserts some paternalistic interest\nand says viewers can't see this because of the offense\nof the message.\nThis statute has nothing to do with the\noffense of the message. It has to do with trying to dry\nup an underlying market for animal cruelty.\nIf the there are no questions, I would like\nto reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Millett.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIt is not the exact same message, if you are\nforced in a popular debate that is going around this\ncountry now about the treatment of animals. To require\none side to engage -- to use simulated images, which is\nexactly what the government's reply brief at page 3\ninsists upon, while those who want to ban conduct are\nallowed to use real images. That puts the government's\ncensorial thumb on the scale of public debate.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What about crush videos,\nwhich apparently were the focus of Congress's attention\nwhen it drafted these? Now, I suppose by an analogy to\nwhat Justice Scalia just said about the message of dog\nfighting videos, the people who produce crush videos\nthink they have a message, and the message is that this\nis -- this is sexually exciting or it's exciting in some\nway to see a woman in high heeled shoes crushing a\nlittle animal to death.\nDo you think that is constitutionally\nprotected?\nMS. MILLETT: I think -- I think there's\na -- that a properly drawn law could very well, at least\nin my humble opinion, this Court would have to decide,\nsurvive strict scrutiny.\nThere is also, I suppose, some argument\nwhether it would fit into -- you wouldn't need strict\nscrutiny, you would fit it into an unprotected category\nof speech like obscenity or it would be the production\nissue that would -- like you have in Ferber.\nBut what -- beyond that I do think we need\nto keep in mind a couple of things --\nJUSTICE ALITO: You are not -- you are not\neven willing to say that that could be prohibited?\nMS. MILLETT: No, no. I think -- I'm saying\nthat there are three alternative ways in which to get to\nit. My first if one is that not this statute, but under\na properly drawn statute --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Under a properly drawn\nstatute --\nMS. MILLETT: -- that might survive\nscrutiny. I'm not sure you would --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Might. I would really like\nyou to tell me whether it would; whether you are willing\nto concede. Because we are trying to determine whether\nthis is overly broad. And this is the category of\nactivity that Congress particularly targeted. So to me\nat least it's important to know whether at least as\napplied to what Congress principally had in mind, the\nstatute could -- could pass constitutional muster. If\nit were, you know, as applied.\nMS. MILLETT: I don't -- I don't want to,\nsay this statute, because I don't think this statute --\nbut if the statute said, this -- I think this Court\ndisagree -- it disagrees with me sometimes -- but I\nthink this could pass constitutional muster. A statute\nthat says the patently offensive intentional torture and\nkilling of an animal for -- designed to appeal to the\nprurient interest for the purpose of producing the\nimage, I think that would satisfy -- I think it would\nsatisfy strict scrutiny. The Court might also decide\nthat it's close enough to obscenity or it's like the\nFerber production rationale. That's my position; there\nare sort of three ways it could be analyzed, a statute\nlike that.\nThat's not this statute and I don't think we\ncan say that this statute, because Congress has the\nauthority to reach something, that when it throws a\nblanket net as wide as this one has that this means this\nstatute is the mechanism, a lawful mechanism for getting\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I have one more -- one\nmore question along the lines of Justice Alito. Forget\nthis statute. Under a properly drawn statute, suppose\nthat bull-fighting or pitbull-fighting is unlawful in\nevery State. Could a theater have a live broadcast of a\npitbull fight in Japan and charge ten dollars? And\nlet's add the hypothetical fact that a lot of the\nrevenue goes back to Japan and promotes more\nbull-fighting. Could a properly drawn statute prohibit\nthat? And then perhaps Justice Scalia, Alito, has a\nfollow-up question on his own hypothetical. Could a\nproperly drawn statute prohibit that, that speech?\nMS. MILLETT: A properly drawn statute with\nthe requisite congressional findings or record of a need\nto attack -- it sound to me like this is a need to\nattack production. As in child pornography, the fact\nthat the image taking is legal overseas does not mean\nthat it can't be prohibited here. And if you had the\ntype of record of a statute that says we want to stop\nthe production; it's not the content, it is the\nproduction, as this Court explained in Free Speech\nCoalition for Child Pornography.\nBut that is a statute that then wouldn't\nhave -- either you would have to decide which things are\nin and out -- if you started saying animal cruelty\nproduction, but we we'll let the bullfights in but the\npitbull fights out and the cock fights, then you'd have\nproblems.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: We are asking whether or\nnot that specific instance could be prohibited under a\nproperly drawn statute, just like Justice Alito's\nhypothetical was under a properly drawn statute you\ncould prohibit the conduct, the speech broadcast in that\nconduct.\nMS. MILLETT: The theory -- I mean,\nultimately this Court would have to decide whether\nFerber is limited to an obscenity that's historically\nunprotected by the First Amendment.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So your answer to my\nhypothetical is yes it could be prohibited under a\nproperly drawn statute?\nMS. MILLETT: If this Court -- two things.\nIt would have to be a very, very narrowly drawn statute,\nI think going to the production theory like Ferber; and\nthe question I think before this Court would be, given\nthe nature of the harm that presumably would be found,\nthe nature of the market, the synergistic effect, where\nthe -- I am assuming the findings here would be that the\ncrime and the image are one and the same, inextricably\nintertwined -- then maybe, although I still think it\nwould be a bit harder because we are dealing with the\nFirst Amendment here. We don't make it up as we go\nalong. At the time that the First Amendment was written\ndog-fighting was legal in this country.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But the point -- the point\nI guess is when you say yes to this, what you are\nthinking is that, just as real obscenity when depicted\ndoes nothing communicative but rather appeals to the\ninstinct of lust, so Congress could find a category of\nthings that do not communicate, but appeal to the\ninstinct of sadism; and that is true when other\ncreatures are killed for the pleasure of the people who\nwant to see them killed.\nNow, that's what you are saying. Now -- and\nI think maybe that's true. We don't have to decide\nthat, perhaps. But the government says that is this\nstatute, that is this statute read in light of its basic\nintent, and it is up to the Court to interpret it so as\nit achieves that objective. And you say that's not\npossible. Why not?\nMS. MILLETT: Two things. First of all,\nthere is interpreting and then there is alchemy, and I\nthink this statute requires alchemy. This is Reno\nversus --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Requires?\nMS. MILLETT: Alchemy, alchemy.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh.\nMS. MILLETT: There's construction of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's such an unusual word.\nI haven't heard it in a legal argument in a long time.\nMS. MILLETT: We don't often get statutes\nthat are so far off base that we're going, I think in my\nopinion, so far beyond construing ambiguity and doing\ninstead what was asked of this Court and the Court\ndeclined in Reno v. ACLU, and that is to write the\nstatute for Congress.\nThe ambiguity, as, Justice Scalia, you\nexplained -- you would have to excise this statute in\nand out, sever so many things. I don't know what you'd\nhave left unless it's the statute I posited to Justice\nAlito, which might have a couple of words that overlap\nwith this statute. But that is not statutory\nconstruction. This Court's job is not to write the\nstatute for Congress.\nAnd also keep in mind, in the past this\nCourt consistently under the First Amendment has\nrequired, not just the right words, but a record from\nCongress. In the First Amendment area we can't just\nposit the problems; we have to really have confidence\nthat --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Does this -- would this\nrecord support any ban? I mean, there was a real\nconcentration on crush videos. So there is that. Is\nthere anything else in the current record other than the\ncrush videos?\nMS. MILLETT: No, there is not. And in fact\nthey spent their time, as we said in our brief -- and\nthis is perfectly accurate. Members of Congress, to the\nextent they discussed other things, kept saying in the\nfloor debates: That's not in; bull-fighting's not in;\ndog-fighting's not in; hunting's not in; these things\nare not in. So they mentioned them in the context of\nsaying these are not in.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I think --\nI think Ferber analytically is the hard case for you,\nbecause the Court in Ferber did said -- and I am quoting\nfrom page 763: \"The evil to be restricted so\noverwhelmingly outweighs the expressive interest at\nstake.\" That was their articulation of the test. Now,\nwhy shouldn't we apply that test to this statute?\nMS. MILLETT: I don't think that is a legal\ntest that is adopted under the First Amendment. I think\nthat is a description of the types of categories that by\nhistory and tradition had been outside the First\nAmendment and the rationale for why Ferber came in,\nwhich was, yes, there's overlap, but I think it actually\nbridges the world of obscenity and virtual incitement\nbecause you have the crime and the image one and the\nsame wrapped up together.\nThere is in this instance -- there are about\nfive different ways that this is different from child\npornography. The first is that there has never been any\nfinding, any assertion, even by the government, that\ncreating the image is the primary or sole motive for\ncreating these images. It's not if you lock Mr. Stevens\nup -- if you throw away every dog-fighting video in the\ncountry tomorrow, dog-fighting will continue. It -- no\none thinks that it will go away.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I think the government\ndoes. It says that is how you dry up the market.\nMS. MILLETT: But you don't dry up the\nmarket by having a sweeping value exception like they\nhave here. If Congress wants to dry up the market, what\nFerber says is there's two things that have to happen:\nOne, you've got to prove causation. You can't simply\nsay, we got a problem, let's go first to the speech and\ncut that off as our first prosecutorial tool when we are\nnot even ready to make the crime itself a felony, but we\nwill make the speech a felony.\nYou've got to prove causation, that these\nimages cause the harm, they are one and the same with\nthe harm as they are with child pornography. You also\nhave got to prove that Congress is acting in an\nevenhanded way. It is not leaving, as Justice Scalia\nsaid, appreciable damage to the interests that its\nasserting uncovered by its many, many exceptions.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you a question\nabout your view of the breadth of the statute. I didn't\nyet really get an answer out of your opponent. Do you\nthink the statute would prohibited depictions of hunting\nif it involved killing in the District of Columbia,\nbecause hunting as I understand it is not allowed in the\nDistrict of Columbia, it's prohibited. Does that mean\nthat any depictions of hunting that show the killing and\ncruelty are prohibited by this statute?\nMS. MILLETT: Well, they are prohibited\nsubject to the value police and the value trial like we\nhad here, which I think is antithetical to the First\nAmendment. It's a very different rule under the\nobscenity statute. So it would all depend on whether a\njury decided that that had serious value, which was\ndefined as significant and great import in this\nparticular case. That would decide whether --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's just not significant\nvalue; significant artistic, educational. What are the\nothers? Scientific?\nMS. MILLETT: Scientific, social, artistic,\njournalistic --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Strictly entertainment\nvalue doesn't count, does it?\nMS. MILLETT: No, it does not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And most of the hunting\nvideos I have seen people watch for the entertainment.\nThey like to see a hunt.\nMS. MILLETT: I think that's exactly right\nand that's what the Safari Club and the NRA have told\nus.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I mean, but\nthis definition or these exceptions are not drawn out of\nthin air. They are drawn from Miller, and the Court in\nMiller recognized that they were significant in causing\nthe restriction of obscenity to pass constitutional\nmuster.\nMS. MILLETT: First of all, this is about\n-- this is Miller doubled -- there's a lot more here\n-- categories here. But it's a very different role\nthat value plays under Miller in obscenity. First of\nall, this Court made quite clear again in Reno v. ACLU\nthat Miller only works if you have all three prongs.\nYou can't just use the serious value prong to take\ncare of your constitutional problem. Second, you were\ndealing in an area that by history and tradition is\nunprotected speech. Milller --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But in determining whether\nthis is over -- overly broad, do we -- do we think of all\nof the hypotheticals that we possibly can think of that\nmight fall within this statute: somebody hunting in the\nDistrict of Columbia, somebody producing fois gras with\na goose and say, \"Well, we've thought of a lot of\nhypothetical situations where this statute might apply\nand therefore it's overly broad\"? Or do we look at\nwhat's going on in the real world?\nMS. MILLETT: I think what you do is you\nlook at text of the statute, and then you ask yourself,\nhow much of a strain is it to come up with a factual\npattern that will fit into it? In Williams you had to\nfirst of all read the --\nJUSTICE ALITO: So we really think of all\nthe hypotheticals. That's how you think we determine\nthe constitutionality of this under the overbreadth\ndoctrine?\nMS. MILLETT: I think at some level Congress\nhas a job to write with a scalpel and not a buzz saw in\nthe First Amendment area, and the only way to ensure\nthat happens is to look at the text and say, does this\ntext fit the purpose, does it fit what the Constitution\nwill allow? And when the --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If it's the fact that during\nthe ten years when this statute has been in effect there\nhas been no decrease in hunting videos and hunting shows\non TV, and all of the rest -- the only perceptible\nchange in the real world is that these -- is that the\nmarket for crush videos dried up, at least until the\nThird Circuit's decision, does that have any relevance?\nMS. MILLETT: I don't -- I don't think it\ndoes for this reason. People -- and this gets a little\nbit to Justice Kennedy's vagueness concern. People have\na right to know how to -- outside the courtroom how to\nconform their conduct to the law. If I got a call from\nthe general counsel of Outdoor Channel or someone making\nhunting videos and they said, \"Does this fall within\nthis statute,\" I wouldn't have to come up with a\nstrained factual scenario. I would say yeah, it falls\nsquarely in, subject to a prosecutor or jury anywhere\nwhere you market in this country, deciding that it has\nserious -- one of the adjectives -- value. I would have\nto say that to that person, and that would be accurate\nlegal advice.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It could be that the reason\nhunting videos are still out there is that the producers\nwere quite confident that this Court would not allow\nthem to be prohibited on the base of a statute such as\nthis.\nMS. MILLETT: One would hope, and I think\nquite frankly the NRA has been quite honest when it\nrecently said you know, this -- this is not an actively\nenforced statute. People were shocked to learn -- to\nbecome aware of it.\nNow maybe everyone's supposed to know the\nexistence of laws, but I think the reality is that once\npeople looked at what this said, they became very, very,\nvery concerned, and I think when you're talking about a\ncriminal prohibition here -- this is not a civil suit,\nthis is criminal prohibition with severe penalties. The\npenalties for speech are higher than most animal cruelty\nstatutes. And the whole point of the criminal law is to\ndeter conduct and to make people stay wide of the\nmargins here, wide of the borders.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --\nMS. MILLETT: You can't do that in the First\nAmendment.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understood your\nanswers to Justice Alito to acknowledge that there would\nbe situations where this statute could be\nconstitutionally applied, or as you put it, you could\ndraft a statute.\nMS. MILLETT: Not this statute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not this statute.\nBut --\nMS. MILLETT: That's different. I think\nthat's very different.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if in fact there\nwere situations where we thought a narrowly drafted\nstatute could be applied to particular instances,\nperhaps the crush videos, perhaps others, why isn't that\nenough to say that this statute is valid on its face and\nthen we will consider as-applied challenges?\nMS. MILLETT: I think in the First\nAmendment -- I'm not talking -- if I heard you right we\nwere not talking about this statute. If you have\nanother statute --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess I am just\ntrying to get at what your understanding of what the\ntest is for overbreadth in this area. How much of an\narea of constitutional application is necessary before\nyou decide that a statute is not unconstitutional on its\nface, but will consider as-applied challenges?\nMS. MILLETT: Right. And this Court has\nbeen clear that the overbreadth has to be both\nquantitative and qualitative. It hasn't set a\nparticular ratio. I think this one is easy. We are\ntalking about 2,000 crush videos and tens if not\nhundreds of thousands of other images that are captured\nby this statute. I think normally when this Court says\nit wants to -- to apply overbreadth, it has been dealing\nwith situations for the most part in two contexts. One\nwhere Congress has already regulated in an area that is\nunprotected under the First Amendment, unprotected in\nthe sense that they are allowed to ban, regulate\nheavily. They are already there, and the question is\ndid they draw the margins too broad?\nThat is not this case. We are dealing in an\narea that was never until December 1999 barred by\nanybody, never considered to be outside the conception\nof the First Amendment's freedom of speech. The other\nscenario where we see substantial overbreadth is when\nCongress is regulating conduct.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, isn't that -- isn't\nthat due to changes in technology? Before people could\nshow -- could watch videos at home, this sort of thing\nwould -- would be very difficult.\nMS. MILLETT: This covers photographs, so\nthis would go back as far as photographs. I'm not sure\nit wouldn't cover a sketch artist or a hieroglyphic, for\nall I know. All it requires is that it be a depiction\nin some form.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And is there -- in the real\nworld is there a market for sketches of dog fights?\nMS. MILLETT: I don't know if there's a\nmarket --\nJUSTICE ALITO: People get a thrill from\nseeing that?\nMS. MILLETT: With respect, I can't answer\nthat. I'm not -- I don't know if there is a market for\ndog fighting videos. There is a few, but it depends on\nwhat you mean by a market. Will somebody buy something?\nI guess somebody in this world will buy anything.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any indication\nthat there has been any dry-up of the market for dog\nfights as a result of this statute?\nMS. MILLETT: There --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Justice Alito suggested\nthat until the Third Circuit's decision, that there were\nfewer crush videos produced. But with respect to dog\nfights, animal fights, is there any indication that\nthere has been -- there have been fewer animal fights as\na result of this statute?\nMS. MILLETT: None whatsoever, and in fact\nwhat we've seen is robust enforcement, and we cite the\narticle in our case, we have seen robust enforcement;\nthere was just an arrest a few weeks ago for I think a\ncouple hundred people involved in dog fighting rings.\nSo the dog fighting rings are going on unabated and they\nare getting found and discovered and prosecuted\nsuccessfully, and in fact the images sometimes help with\nthe prosecution.\nThis is a place, when we start talking we\nare going to take something outside the First Amendment,\none of the other things that unifies the categories of\nspeech outside the First Amendment is a judgment that\nmore speech doesn't work. This is an area where we know\nspeech works powerfully. Speech about these ugly images\nproduced this statute. It informed people. Unlike\nchildren and child pornography, people need to see\nimages to understand what's going on with animals, and\nto make these important decisions and engage in these\nimportant debates that our society is having.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose an argument --\nexcuse me.\nSuppose an argument had been made to the\nCourt in Ferber, that, you know, it's really good for\npeople to see molestation of children because then they\nwill be outraged and they will enforce the statute more.\nI just can't see the Court accepting that argument for a\nsingle -- for a minute.\nMS. MILLETT: I -- I agree. I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's the argument\nyou are making.\nMS. MILLETT: No, no, I think it's -- I\nthink it's -- I'm trying to point out that this is in\nfact a contrast.\nFirst of all -- a contrast between the two\nsituations between dealing with the subject, a very\ntopical subject that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it seems to me that\nwe ought -- if there is a significant chance that\nCongress can affect an illegal market, an illegal\nactivity by a statutory regulation we ought to defer to\nCongress on that ground. I think you still have speech\narguments.\nMS. MILLETT: I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: On this economic\ncausation, I think we have to defer to Congress largely.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I really think you should\nfocus, not on the educational value for -- to make\npeople hate bull fighting and things, but on quite the\nopposite, it seems to me. On the right under the First\nAmendment of people who like bull fighting, who like dog\nfighting, who like cock fighting, to present their side\nof -- of the debate.\nAnd unless it's a subject like obscenity,\nwhich from the beginning has not been considered\nprotected speech, it seems to me that side of the debate\nis entitled to make its point as -- as forcefully as\npossible. That's it seems to me what the problem is\nhere. Not --\nMS. MILLETT: I think that is 100 percent\nright.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if that's 100 percent,\nthen what about people who --who like to see human\nsacrifices? Suppose that is legally taking place\nsomeplace in the world. I mean, people here would\nprobably love to see it. Live, pay per view, you know,\non the human sacrifice channel.\n(Laughter. )\nJUSTICE ALITO: They have a point of view\nthey want to express. That's okay?\nMS. MILLETT: The problem with this statute\nis that presumably that statute would be even-handed and\nwould it not say if the sacrifices were religious, or\njournalistic, or historic. Or --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You can create a lot of\nFirst Amendment horribles. What about -- what about a\nnew Adolf Hitler? Can we censor any depiction of that\nnew Adolf Hitler and the horrible things that he is\nproposing, including extermination of a race? Is that\nproscribable under the First Amendment? Is that any\nless horrible than the human sacrifice contemplation?\nMS. MILLETT: No, Justice Scalia. Again, I\nagree, because what the First Amendment says is we\nallow --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry; you agree\nyou can prohibit it, or not?\nMS. MILLETT: I agree that, just because\nsomething is repulsive, incredibly offensive or maybe\neven involves some harm to people does not mean that --\ndepictions of it that do not cause that harm, that are\nnot integrally tied to it, that are not the purpose and\nanimating motivation for that harm cannot be proscribed.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What was your answer to\nJustice Alito's hypothetical about human sacrifice?\nMS. MILLETT: The -- if -- at a minimum,\nCongress has got to be evenhanded. The point there is\nthat you are trying to say we are concerned about the\ncreation for purposes of the image. We are concerned\nabout what the government calls the \"snuff video\nsituation.\"\nThis whole reason that this is created is\nfor purposes of creating the image. If you establish\nthe causation -- and I don't think we -- the Court does\njust defer to Congress on these things.\nIt looks carefully at factual records in --\nas it has in the child pornography are under the First\nAmendment, Justice Kennedy. If Congress proves the\ncausation and shows that it is -- it's the least\nrestrictive means -- compelling and least restrictive\nmeans, the strict scrutiny that Congress -- the\ngovernment never wanted this statute to march through.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And what if there is no\nchance of drawing up the activity? Suppose you have the\nethnic cleansing channel on cable TV, and there is no --\nthis is taking place in a country that's beyond our\npower to influence. Congress couldn't prohibit that?\nMS. MILLETT: The -- the fact that conduct\nis repulsive or offensive does not mean we automatically\nban the speech. You would have to have -- it would have\nto follow this Court's patterns, either it would be an\neven-handed ban on production, under the Ferber theory,\nor you would have to establish if those images were\nnever within the constraints.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I think what -- I think\nwhat's going on is -- is not -- your conflating two\nthings. One is you are trying to produce education\nabout something that has no communicative value.\nIn so far as you are trying to make an\nargument or educate, of course, it is protected, but the\ngovernment, here, is saying I think the statute is\nintended to forbid a different thing entirely, and it's\nhard to draw a line.\nMaybe it's impossible; but promoting a thing\nwhich communicates nothing, but appeals to people's\nworst instinct, that is not to advocate it or not to\nadvocate it.\nIt is to try to make money out of it, and\nthat's what they think, I believe, the statute is aimed\nat.\nMS. MILLETT: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So that's why they have the\njournalistic exception.\nMS. MILLETT: The -- when it comes to\npromoting illegal conduct, we have the Brandenburg Test,\nand, if you are close enough to be inciting it, to be\ncausing it -- which I think is where Ferber, largely,\nis. They are just intertwined. That's one thing. But\nif it's not -- just because we have the really\ndisgusting, despicable channel doesn't mean that we\nautomatically ban it. Maybe it will be educational.\nMaybe we will learn from it.\nI think Congress is going to have to show,\nbefore it goes to speech as its first tool of repression\nto attack conduct with, very specialized, narrow\ncircumstances.\nJUSTICE BREYER: We are going to advertise a\ndrug that is known to kill people.\nMS. MILLETT: That is commercial --\nJUSTICE BREYER: We are advertising --\nMS. MILLETT: That is commercial speech.\nThe fact that you want to get paid for speaking does not\nmake it commercial speech.\nSamuel Johnson, himself, said that no one\nbut a blockhead ever wrote, except for money. I don't\nnecessarily agree with that, but it is -- it would be a\nshock to him, to Thomas Payne, who sold his tracks of\n\"Common Sense,\" that the First Amendment would go all --\nleap all the way from commercial speech and say, just\nbecause you are doing it for money, you need to make a\nbuck.\nYour Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I would have thought that\nyour response to Justice Breyer's comment about catering\nto people's worst instincts in the area of the First\nAmendment, at least, would have been that it's not up to\nthe government to decide what are people's worst\ninstincts.\nIf -- if the First Amendment means anything,\nthat's what it means.\nMS. MILLETT: Well, it means --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not up to the\ngovernment to tell us what our worst instincts are --\nMS. MILLETT: It means --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Except for those areas that\nhave traditionally been outside the area of -- of\nprotected speech, and -- and once you allow this one,\nwhat other -- what other base instincts do people have,\nbesides this one?\nOne can contemplate a lot of other areas,\nwhere government could say, You are appealing to\npeople's worst instincts, and, therefore, the -- the\nmovies cannot be made.\nMS. MILLETT: I agree, Justice Scalia. The\nanswer to that instance is more speech under the First\nAmendment. The answer --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So I'm sorry. I'm\nstill looking for your answer to Justice Alito's\nhypotheticals.\nCan Congress ban the human sacrifice channel\nor not?\nMS. MILLETT: I -- the -- I think -- I -- I\nwill start by saying -- no. Let's start and see.\nMaybe -- maybe it won't work, but I think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You are unwilling --\nyou are unwilling to say that Congress can pass a law,\neven-handed, straightforward, you cannot have a human\nsacrifice channel.\nMS. MILLETT: If it did, it would have to be\neven-handed and have narrow tailoring, but the problem\nis --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What do you mean by\n\"even-handed,\" please? I'm not -- you are using those\nwords. What do you mean about \"even-handed and narrowly\ntailored\"?\nMS. MILLETT: When -- when the attack --\nJustice Sotomayor, when the attack is on the\nproduction -- if it -- I don't mean to be -- I want to\nbe direct in answering.\nIt depends on two things. If the theory is\nwe don't like the content, we don't want people to see\nthe content, I don't think Congress can do it. I think\nthe answer is more --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So that goes with snuff\nmovies -- snuff movies. I don't know if they really\nexist, but they have been described.\nMS. MILLETT: No one has ever found one,\nbut the point I'm trying to get -- there are two\ntheories --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Adolf Hitler, can we keep\nhim off the screen, too?\nMS. MILLETT: It's a dangerous proposition.\nThat's what the First Amendment says we won't do. There\nis -- so if it's just that we don't like the content,\noutside obscenity, we -- Congress doesn't get to ban it.\nThe answer is more speech.\nIf you have got --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we don't like --\nwe don't like human sacrifice, and so Congress passes a\nlaw saying you cannot have a channel that shows human\nsacrifice -- real human sacrifice. You think that is\nunconstitutional?\nMS. MILLETT: I think, if the point is that\nwe don't like the could content, we don't -- we want to\nprotect people from these images, the First Amendment\nsays a lot about that.\nIf it's a different -- snuff video, because,\nlike child pornography, like I said, it's not the\ncontent that we are concerned about, where obscenity is\na pure content baseline.\nIt is -- we got to stop -- we can't stop the\nconduct. The conduct and the speech are inextricably\nintertwined. The only way we can stop human sacrifice\nis to stop the image because the sacrifice is solely\nfor the image.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, right, but, I\nmean, the hypothetical is we can't do anything about it.\nIt is beyond our reach to stop the human sacrifice\ntaking place wherever in the world, so that that\nargument -- the Ferber argument is off the table.\nIn that situation, you think it's\nunconstitutional for Congress to pass a law saying there\ncan be no human sacrifice channel.\nMS. MILLETT: I -- I think the fact that --\nI think it would be a lot harder under the First\nAmendment to say why Congress is doing that.\nIf it's not something -- if it's not conduct\nit has any authority to regulate, I don't -- then the\nonly compelling interest is -- I'm trying -- I mean, I\ndon't want to watch this channel, and people should\nfight with their wallets and their votes and not support\nthese things, but -- I'm sorry.\nMay I finish?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. Go ahead.\nMS. MILLETT: But, under the First\nAmendment, if the only rationale Congress is giving is\nwe are here to shield your eyes for you, we will make\nthis censorial decision, it has got to find some basis\nto think that was never freedom of the speech under the\nFirst Amendment, in the way that obscenity was.\nYou don't get to make it up as you go along.\nWe are interpreting a constitution.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMr. Katyal, you have three minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. KATYAL: There is one analytic move\nCongress made in Section 48, which is simple and\nobvious, and it explains why both the human sacrifice\nchannel is constitutional, as well as Section 48 itself.\nThat is the logic of Ferber. When Congress\ntries to dry up a market for underlying cruelty by\ntargeting depictions and leaves alternative mechanisms\nfor that expression in place, the legislature has\nlatitude.\nWhen the statute is not aimed at the\ncommunicative impact of the message, like the Hitler\nvideo, but, rather, is aimed at reducing underlying acts\nof exploitation, that is an area which Congress has\ngreat leeway.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand. Are\nyou saying, since there is no human sacrifice in this\ncountry and no market to be dried up, the videos would\nbe okay?\nMR. KATYAL: I'm saying that, if Congress\nidentified a market and if a video -- if the snuff video\nmarket was driving, somehow, people to get killed,\nCongress would be fully within its power to regulate it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah; but we don't have any\nhuman sacrifice. Nobody's doing that stuff. So you\ncould not proscribe the human sacrifice channel.\nMR. KATYAL: That's precisely correct, but,\nhere, Congress did find an overwhelming market in animal\ncruelty, and the State attorney's general that filed a\nbrief before you saying that Section 48 is a success\nstory, that it dried up 3,000 crush videos, that it has\nreduced the market for animal --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How many prosecutions\nhave there been for crush videos?\nMR. KATYAL: There -- there haven't been any\nprosecutions for crush videos, and I think the reason is\nbecause the market dried up very quickly after the\nenactment of Section 48.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did I just\nunderstand you to agree with your colleague on the other\nside, that Congress could not ban the human sacrifice\nchannel because there would be no connection between\ndrying up the underlying activity?\nMR. KATYAL: Oh, no. If there is an\nunderlying argument --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. I'm saying there\nis no connection. We can't reach the activity where it\nis taking place.\nMR. KATYAL: I think that does start to\nreach into questions about obscenity and expressive\nimpact on viewers, which is not before this Court.\nCongress is not resting its judgment here on something\nsaying these images are repulsive and can't be seen.\nRather, it is saying --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if Congress is --\nand we will give you sufficient rebuttal time.\nSo, if Congress is saying, Look, we just\ndon't like what -- is being shown on the human sacrifice\nchannel, we don't want people to see it, they can't do\nthat?\nMR. KATYAL: Again, that raises a whole\ndifferent set of questions under obscenity and\nexpressive impact that isn't before the Court here.\nNow, if I could return to, Justice Stevens,\nyou had he wasn't clear on the position on hunting. I\nwant to be very clear on this.\nHunting, like the other hypotheticals, is\nnot covered by section 48 for two reasons: First, the\nstatute -- the statute's term \"animal cruelty\" should be\ndefined to encompass torture, mutilation and the like,\nand not simple acts of ordinary hunting, most of which,\nby the way, are legal anyway under animal cruelty.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How about the statute's\nterm, \"kill\" --\nMR. KATAYAL: And again --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- what should that be\ninterpreted to mean?\nMR. KATYAL: And again, Justice Scalia, as I\nsaid before, I think that comes within a definition of\nanimal cruelty. That's the term being defined. And\njust as this Court has defined, for example, crimes of\nviolence to exclude certain things that otherwise would\nbe within the statute, such as drunk driving offenses in\nthe context of the IMA, a similar result is possible\nhere, particularly because of the doctrine of\nconstitutional avoidance.\nAnd, so, we are saying that if this Court\nwere to write an opinion that made clear that these\nthings are outside of the purview of section 48, there\nwould be no chilling effect, and you wouldn't have to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Wait, I want to just be\nsure I understand you. Even if the hunting depiction is\nvery offensive and cruel and all the rest, and that the\ncruelty to the animal using bow and arrows or knives or\nsomething, you say it's not -- and even if it's illegal\nin this particular jurisdiction, you say the statute\nstill does not apply at all?\nMR. KATYAL: It would have to be for a\nreason of animal cruelty or something like torture,\nmutilation and the like. So there may be certain\nhunting examples that fall within it --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the hunting would\nnever qualify, because the hunter's motive is benign; is\nthat what you are saying?\nMR. KATYAL: No, it has nothing to do with\nthe motive, it has to do with what happens to the\nanimal. And, so, there could be images of hunting which\nare not really hunting, like the images in this case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If you shoot a little low\nand wound the animal, that is cruelty even though you\ndidn't intend that.\nMR. KATYAL: Justice Scalia, with all due\nrespect, I think the images in this case and what\nCongress was getting at was not shooting a little low.\nThese are the most horrific images that you can imagine\nof cruelty to living animals. And that's what\nCongress --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But what about your\nresponse to Justice Stevens on the hunting matter? I\nunderstand Congress wasn't directed at --\nMR. KATYAL: And my point if those -- if\nthere are those cases at the area -- at the gray areas,\nthat is perfect for as applied challenge, but it's not\nwhat this Court -- this Court shouldn't be blessing the\nThird Circuit's decision to in toto invalidate an entire\nstatute which has produced -- which has produced 3,000\ncrush videos and the like.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel,\nboth counsel, for very able presentation.
