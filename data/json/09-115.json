        "content": "(11:01 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext this morning in Case 09-115, Chamber of\nCommerce v. Whiting.\nMr. Phillips.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nIn 1986, Congress converted what had been\nbefore that time a merely peripheral concern of\nimmigration policy -- that is, how to regulate worker\nauthorization -- and converted it into a core concern of\nimmigration policy by the passage of the -- of the\nImmigration Reform and Control Act.\nThis Court has characterized that change in\nlegislation as providing a comprehensive scheme for\ndealing with those issues, and that characterization is\nobviously apt because Congress provided for an\nexhaustive and exclusively Federal method of bringing to\nthe attention of Federal authorities problems in worker\nauthorization, the method by which those matters should\nbe investigated, the method by which they should be\nadjudicated, all of which are controlled as a matter of\nFederal -- exclusive Federal activity; and, indeed, the\nultimate judicial review goes exclusively to the Federal\ncourts of appeals.\nThe sanctioning provisions are very explicit\nand they're very clear and they are very balanced; and\nfor a good reason. Congress realized in this context\nthat if you over-enforce in one direction -- that is, if\nyou try to deter the hiring of unauthorized workers -\nyou run a very serious risk of causing employers to err\non the side of not hiring others who are in fact\nauthorized but who may fall into protected classes. And\nso Congress very carefully calibrated the penalties on\nboth sides so that the employer essentially would play\nit straight down the middle and hire the best people for\nthe job under these circumstances, while, of course,\ncomplying if at all possible with the Federal\nrequirements.\nAnd so it's against that backdrop -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why is that a\nproblem if, as -- as the Federal statute requires and\nthe State statutes require, you have to show an intent\nto hire an unauthorized worker? Isn't -- isn't that\nwhat the State statutes here require?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, the State statute has\ntwo components to it. One is knowing and one is intent.\nBut -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But I don't see how that -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So -- so why is that a\nproblem for -- for the business? I mean he's safe so\nlong as he doesn't intentionally hire an unauthorized\nworker.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think part of the\nproblem is that there -- it is never 100 percent clear\nprecisely who is and who is not an authorized worker.\nAnd I think what Congress said was -- I'm not going to\ndeal with this problem in the kind of granular way\nyou're looking at it, Justice Scalia, which is\nspecifically at each of the individual employment\ndecisions. I'm going to look at the generality of\nsituations, and realize that if you put in -- on one\nside of the scale what Arizona has done here, which is\nto say you can -- you can essentially have the death\npenalty to the business, that is, complete eliminate the\nbusiness's right to exist, and, on the other side of the\nscale, a $250 fine, it would -- it would be pretty\nremarkable to say, well, I -- you know, I'm going to\nhide behind the intent and knowing requirements and,\ninstead, simply avoid if at all possible the risk of\nArizona's sanctions being imposed upon me.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I think what Arizona\nwould answer to that is: Well, that's the only option\nthe Federal Government left us.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I'm quite sure that\nthat's what Arizona will say.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They excluded everything\nelse. We might have used reticulated penalties or, you\nknow, enforced the Federal law ourselves, but they\nforbade that. But they did allow us to enforce the law,\nimmigration laws, through licensing, right? So it all\nessentially comes down to -- to the licensing issue,\ndoesn't it?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. It does ultimately\ndoes come down to the \"through licensing\" laws and -\nthe -- the part of the -- and the fundamental problem,\nobviously, with Arizona's scheme here is that this is\nnot a licensing law. This is a worker authorization\nsanctioning law.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, when I picked up\nthis -- this brief and looked at this case, I thought:\nOh, well, licensing, that's a defined term; I'll look in\nCorpus Juris Secundum or ALR or something. But it\nreally isn't. Your brief indicates you start with\ndictionaries, fair enough. You indicate what Federal\nlicensing laws are. But I see no limitation on what the\nState can decide is a license in any jurisprudential\nprinciple that you've cited.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. Justice Kennedy, I\nthink the better way to try to -- to grapple with the\nmeaning of the licensing law or whether it ought to be\nconstrued broadly to allow the State wide authority to\nengage in supplemental enforcement in this, or narrowly\nin order to say that what really ought to happen in this\ncontext is, if you deal with a situation where the\nFederal Government has enacted -- I'm sorry -- has\nenforced a provision and imposed a penalty through the\nFederal scheme, that then as a supplement to that the\nState does in fact have the authority to add something\nover and above what it -- what the Federal Government\nhas done.\nBut it seems to me quite remarkable to think\nthat Congress intended through a parenthetical referring\nto \"through licensing laws\" to allow the State to adopt\nan entire alternative shadow enforcement mechanism, a\nnon-administrative decision-making process, completely a\nState-run operation; and even at the end, the sanction\nis not -- is not imposed ultimately in effect by the -\nby any regulating entity. It is ordered by a State\ncourt.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That would be possible only\nbecause nobody would think that, with this scheme in\nplace, the Federal Government would not enforce it. Of\ncourse, no one would have expected that. But what\nArizona says has occurred here is that the scheme in\nplace has not been enforced, and Arizona and other\nStates are in serious trouble financially and for other\nreasons because of -- of unrestrained immigration. And,\ntherefore, they had to take this very massive -- I agree\nthis step is massive, and one wouldn't have expected it\nto occur under this statute, but expectations change\nwhen the Federal Government has -- has simply not\nenforced the immigration restrictions.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Scalia, I -- I\nunderstand the point, and I understand the motivation\nfor why Arizona did what it did. But the -- the problem\nis the statute was enacted in 1986, and that's when the\npre-emption standards were put in place. And the -\nagain, the notion -- if you look at the way the\nstructure of the statute -- and this also responds in\nsome ways to Justice Kennedy's question about how should\nyou read licensing, since it's not a self-defining\nconcept -- is if you -- is that, first, Congress said\nvery specifically that the immigration laws should be\nenforced uniformly, which says that there shouldn't be\n40,000 different localities offering up their view of\nlicensing and -- and the additional 50 States.\nSecond of all, and this part I think is\nparticularly telling in terms of this massive State\nscheme that's been adopted, which is that under section\n1324a(b)(5), which is in 134a of the -- of the appendix,\nCongress specifically outlaws the use of the I-9 form.\nAnd in some ways this goes to your question,\nJustice Scalia, because it would be inconceivable that\nthe State can in fact enforce knowing and intentional\ndecision making without having access to the I-9 form,\nbecause that's -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you this\nquestion to get back -\nMR. PHILLIPS: Sure.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- to the issue of whether\nthis is a licensing law? \"Licensing\" is not an unknown\nterm. States and municipalities issue all sorts of\nlicenses. For example, I think here in the District of\nColumbia every business has to have a general business\nlicense; isn't that right?\nMR. PHILLIPS: That is true, Justice Alito.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Now, if the District of\nColumbia were -- after having enacted this requirement\nsome years ago, were to pass a new ordinance saying \"and\nif you knowingly hire an illegal alien, your general\nbusiness license can be forfeited,\" would that not -\nwould that cease to be a licensing law?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I -- I think the answer\nto that specific hypothetical is that's still not a\nlicensing law, because it doesn't tie the grant of the\nlicense to the revocation powers. I think Congress -- I\nthink Congress means for the States to adopt something\nmore specific than that, although I do think\neventually -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, why is it -- this is\nthe same question you're answering. Why is it suddenly\nnot a license because the -- because the State imposes\nan additional condition, where it was a license before?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I -\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think the question is\nwhether it is a licensing law within the meaning of what\nCongress intended. I mean -- the -- the reality is,\nJustice Alito, there -- there is no common definition of\n\"license,\" and various States and local -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Actually, there is. I\nmean, it seemed to me when I read this, it sounded a\nlittle familiar, and I think whoever wrote it in Arizona\ncopied it out of the Administrative Procedure Act. I\nmean, you read the definition of \"license\" in the\nAdministrative Procedure Act -\nMR. PHILLIPS: But -\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and this is awfully\nclose.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. I understand that,\nJustice Breyer, and I agree with that. But the problem\nis, is that the -- the Federal law, it doesn't talk\nabout actions with -- with respect to licenses. It\ntalks about licensing laws and -\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's right. It might\nhave meant something different; Congress might have.\nBut what is, then -- I read the SEIU brief. I thought\nthat was pretty interesting. Is that something you\nadopt as what the Congress did mean? I mean, what do\nyou think Congress did mean, and what evidence is\nthere -- if it didn't mean the APA definition, what\nevidence is there for that?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, the SEIU brief does a\nvery nice job of explaining the -- the particular focus\nof Congress, obviously, on the -- on the Agricultural\nWorkers Protection Act, and in particular -- which, you\nknow, has tremendous significance in terms of narrowing\nthe State's authority here, because, obviously, in their\nconforming amendments in that context -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It could have named that,\nif that's all it meant.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It could have named that,\nthat particular licensing scheme, if that's what it\nmeant. But it didn't name it; it said licensing\ngenerally.\nWhat did it intend to add to that? Barbers'\nlicenses?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, I think what -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Beauticians' licenses?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Of course.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How would any of this have\nanything to do with the immigration laws?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think what it -- what\nCongress actually had in mind and what's the most\nnatural reading of a licensing law is the fairly common\nsituation where somebody violates Federal law, usually\non the criminal side, and a State licensing entity finds\nout about a conviction of a Federal crime, and says:\nOh, wait a second, we don't want people to have licenses\nunder these circumstances, and, therefore, they -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But they're saying -\nthat's exactly what they are saying. We -- we have -\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, no, no. But,\nJustice Scalia, there's a vast difference between that\nand what they're saying.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think it's very common to\ntalk about authority to do business within a State as -\nas a license. You say \"licensed to do business in\" so\nmany States. It's a common expression.\nNow, I have -- maybe you'll persuade me\notherwise, but I have no doubt that insofar as this law\nlimits the authority to do business within the State, it\nis a -- it is a licensing law. It's a little harder\nextending licensing to formation of a corporation, but\nwhen you issue a corporation charter you really do two\nthings. You create the corporation and enable the\nlimitation of liability that creates, and secondly, you\nauthorize that new creature to do business within your\nState. So at least half of that corporation law is\nlicensing, it seems to me.\nNow, if that's what I think, what -\nMR. PHILLIPS: Actually, Justice Scalia, can\nI stop you there?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. Go on.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Because I think, actually, if\nyou just -- if you just receive the articles of\nincorporation, that doesn't actually in all States\nnecessarily give you the opportunity to do business. It\njust simply gives you the right to exist, and you may\nvery well need to get a separate document in order to\nactually do business in a particular State.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- but you do not need\nthe kind of a document that an out-of-State corporation\nneeds -\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, you don't need that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- if you're an in-State\ncorporation.\nMr. PHILLIPS: That's true. That's true.\nBut the -- but the reality is that nobody, I think -\nand common sense and common use of the term, thinks of\narticles of incorporation or the charter of a\npartnership or any of those as -- documents as\nlicensing, which suggests that the State -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I -- could I -\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- just -- just focus\nthe questioning? Because we keep talking about whether\nthe APA-type definition of licensing is what Congress\nintended or not, but you don't disagree that Congress at\nleast intended that if someone violated the Federal law\nand hired illegal aliens and was -- undocumented aliens\nand was found to have violated it, that the State can\nrevoke their license, correct?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- to do business?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes. I don't disagree with\nthat, Justice Sotomayor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it really doesn't\nmatter whether they're revoking their right to do\nbusiness in the State. And they can only revoke their\ncharter or their articles of incorporation if they're -\nif they were filed in that State. They wouldn't have\npower to revoke a Delaware -\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. They can't do it -\nthey can't do it to Delaware, right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So it's\nstopping them from doing business. So really the only\nconflict you're talking about is not the power to stop\nthem from doing business, because you accept that this\nsaving clause gives them the power to do that, to revoke\nthe right to do business; what you're talking about is a\nconflict in the adjudication of that issue.\nMR. PHILLIPS: And -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that correct?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, and the enforcement\nand investigation.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So I'm -\nyou know, how they define \"license\" or not is irrelevant\nto me. Walk me through whether -- what expressly\npre-empts that adjudication right -\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- or what implicitly\npre-empts that adjudication right.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because that is, for me,\nwhat the center of this question is.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. I think there are\nthree pieces of evidence that respond directly to what\nyou asked, Justice Sotomayor.\nFirst is Congress, in section 115 of the\nstatute, specifically says enforcement should be\nuniform, which suggests to me that this ought to be\nexclusively a Federal investigation and -- and\nadjudication process.\nTwo, the point I was making earlier about\nthe I-9 form. Those forms cannot be used in any\nlocation -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Don't depart\nfrom that. What does that mean, \"enforcement shall be\nuniform\"?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What does that mean,\n\"enforcement shall be uniform\"?\nMR. PHILLIPS: The enforcement of the\nimmigration laws shall be uniform. Congress stated that\nas a -- as an overarching principle -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that any different\nfrom -\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- when it enacted section\n115.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- from what is the assumed\nsituation with respect to all Federal laws?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, not necessarily.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are Federal laws not to be\napplied uniformly.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, no, I -- I mean, I\nthink it depends on the circumstances. I can imagine a\nlot of -- I mean, this is -- remember, we're talking\nabout immigration policy and immigration law here, and\nin general, you would expect that to be pretty much\nuniform. But this Court in De Canas had decided that\nthere are some elements of it that were not, and\nCongress is simply reinforcing the basic notion that\nenforcement of it ought to be uniform to -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Doesn't the exception for\nlicensing mean that this isn't going to be completely\nuniform? One -- one jurisdiction may take the position\nthat a restaurant that employs illegal aliens may lose\nits restaurant -- its license to operate. Another one\nmay take the different position.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So it's not going to be the\nsame.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But -- but, Justice Alito, I\nthink that's why it's terribly important to limit, to\nnarrow as much as possible -- and it's fully consistent\nwith congressional intent -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, they say that\nthese -\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- the need to get a full\nsanction done by the Federal Government and then just an\nadd-on on the licensing side, rather than an entire\nregime to enforce State law.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But this is -- it can't\nbe uniformity of sanction, because the court permitted\nlicensing sanctions.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, there -- but only at\nthat point.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So let's go back to my\nquestion of adjudication. What you're saying is what's\nspecifically pre-empted is the right to adjudicate -\nMR. PHILLIPS: Investigate -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- whether someone has\nhired undocumented aliens, correct?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, Justice Sotomayor.\nAnd -- and the last thing I would say with respect to\nthat was the conforming amendments with respect to the\nAgricultural Workers Protection Act, there's a situation\nwhere the Department of Labor, which used to engage in\nadjudication as well, was divested of that authority.\nIt seems quite unlikely Congress meant to give that\nauthority to the States and take it from the Department\nof Labor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see the problem in\n-- in diverse adjudication. Wouldn't there be a Federal\nquestion presented if a -- if a company claimed that it\nwas deprived of the ability to do business because of a\nmistaken interpretation of Federal law, that the person\nit hired was not an authorized person?\nMR. PHILLIPS: But Arizona doesn't\npurport -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wouldn't that be a Federal\nquestion that -- that could be -\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, Arizona doesn't purport\nto be enforcing Federal law here. It has an independent\nState law basis for the actions that it takes. So that\nwould not arise under Federal law, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't the State law basis\nrefer to the Federal law?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, it -- actually, I don't\nthink it -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought it tracked it.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, it -- well, it tracks it,\nbut it doesn't incorporate it. It doesn't purport to be\n-- to be applying it. It's the same standards, but it's\nstill a matter of State law. It's not a Federal -- it's\nnot Federal -- it doesn't arise under Federal law.\nI'd like to reserve -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nGeneral Katyal.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL KUMAR KATYAL\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING PETITIONERS\nGENERAL KATYAL: Thank you,\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nNearly a quarter of a century ago, Congress\ndeclared Federal employer sanctions central, not\nperipheral, to the policy of immigration law. Congress\nbroadly swept away State and local laws, pre-empting any\nsanction upon those who employ unauthorized aliens, with\nthe sole exception being a mere parenthetical for\nlicensing and similar laws.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just to pose there,\nwe've had a little discussion about what licensing laws\nare, but we haven't talked at all about those last two\nwords, \"and similar laws.\" It seems to me that whatever\nwiggle room or ambiguity there may be in saying whether\nthis is a license or not, Congress swept pretty broadly.\nIt said, not just licensing laws, but licensing and\nsimilar laws.\nGENERAL KATYAL: First let me tell you,\nMr. Chief Justice, what we think a licensing law is and\nthen deal with the \"similar\" question.\nWe think a licensing law, as Congress\ndefined it in IRCA, was the traditional licensing laws\nthat were in place in 1986. Those were largely farm\nlabor contractor laws. They were aimed at fitness to do\nbusiness, and they had a few essential characteristics\nin those laws. They -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Let me\njust -- I mean, businesses had to have licensing laws\npretty much across the board, right? You couldn't set\nup a -- I don't know -- an electrical contracting\nbusiness if you didn't -- weren't licensed to do\nbusiness or met the requirements for an electrician. It\nwasn't just agricultural work.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Oh, absolutely. And -- but\nI think that this licensing law looks very different\nfrom the ones you were referring to or the farm labor\ncontractor ones, for a number of reasons. The first is\nlicensing laws issue licenses. They're generally about\nthe issuance of licenses, not simply ones in which\nlicenses are revoked. Second, they are ones in which\nthe issuance of the license, the criteria for issuance,\nis the same as the criteria for revocation, because\nthey're -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. You -- are you\nsaying, and I think the Petitioner here may have been\nsaying as well, that if you have a licensing law that\npermits the revocation of the license, the revocation is\nnot a licensing law?\nGENERAL KATYAL: No. What I'm saying is,\nis that a -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose I have a licensing\nlaw which says if you do this, your license will be\nrevoked. Does that remain a licensing law?\nGENERAL KATYAL: In general, that itself is\nnot a licensing law. The licensing laws share a number\nof characteristics. Now, we can debate about whether\nsubtracting one or another of those characteristics -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why make exception for\nlicensing laws therefore if you can't revoke a license\nunder it?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Because -- because,\nJustice Scalia, Congress wanted to preserve the States'\ntraditional power for licensing laws, which were about\nfitness to do business. And what Arizona has done -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Once you're in, you can do\nwhatever you like. Do you think that is what Congress\nmeant? You can -- you can pass upon their fitness when\nyou issue the license, but once its issued, they can do\nwhatever they like; is that right?\nGENERAL KATYAL: No. I think that the\ncriteria would be the same for issuance and revocation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And revocation. Okay. So\nthat raises the question: What does it make -- why does\nit make any difference if the revocation provision is\ncontained in the narrow licensing law or if there's a\ngeneral State law which says all licenses that -- that\nare issued may be revoked for certain reasons?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Because, Justice Scalia,\nwhat Congress was trying to do was preserve the States'\nand localities' traditional power for fitness to do\nbusiness. And one good indicia that fitness to do\nbusiness is not was what at issue in the particular law\nis that they will let businesses operate, they will\nlicense them without any care whatsoever as to whether\nthey have a history of violating the particular\nprovisions -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So they should just --\nArizona should just amend all its licensing laws to\nrequire what they now require when the license is\nissued, and to say, in each specific licensing law, that\nit can be revoked for the same -- on the same grounds -\nGENERAL KATYAL: Justice Scalia, that would\nsolve that problem.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That would solve the\nproblem.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Now, there are other -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if they said -\nGENERAL KATYAL: -- hallmarks of licensing\nlaw.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if they said\n\"and you have to renew your license every year or every\n6 months\"?\nGENERAL KATYAL: That is correct. That\nitself, I don't think, is relevant to whether the\nlicensing law is -- the other hallmarks are that they\nhave discretionary adjudication by an expert body, that\nit's not mandatory, that it is genuinely aimed at\nqualifications to do business. It -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't disagree\nthat whether or not a company hires illegal workers is\nrelated to quality or -- or ability to do business or\nqualification?\nGENERAL KATYAL: A State could certainly\nmake that part of its genuine fitness to do business\nlaw. Now, here Arizona hasn't done that. And we know\nthat because the criteria for issuance of the license\nare entirely divorced from the criteria for revocation\nof the license. And if Arizona really believed,\nMr. Chief Justice, what you're saying, which is that\nit's relevant to the -- the violation is relevant to\nwhether they can do business or not, they allow every\nsingle one of these entities to get the license.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Your argument sounds to\nme like look at the law and see what its purpose is. If\nthe purpose is to regulate undocumented aliens, then\nit's struck down. If it happens to put its revocation\nprovisions in its licensing law, then it's okay.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Justice -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It doesn't make much\nsense -\nGENERAL KATYAL: Justice Sotomayor, I'm not\ntalking about purpose. I'm saying look at the face of\nthe statute and see what is being -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The face of the statute\ntalks only about if you hire undocumented aliens, your\nlicense is revoked.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Right. So that looks like\na punishment statute. There are essentially two boxes\nhere. There is the -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the -- the saving\nclause says that it's okay. Civil or criminal sanctions\nother than through licensing and similar laws. So, I\nmean -\nGENERAL KATYAL: Right. And this is not a\nlicensing law. Congress essentially had two boxes in\n1986. One was the traditional fitness to do business\nlaws, and the other was what Congress -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we disagree with you,\ncould you answer the question I posed to your adversary,\nwhich is what makes the adjudication of status\npre-empted?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Absolutely. The Federal\nadjudication is expressly -- State adjudication of a\nFederal violation is expressly pre-empted as well as\nimpliedly so for three reasons. The first is that\nCongress, in developing IRCA and the comprehensive\nscheme, set out a series of procedures, Federal\nadjudication with an ALJ, all sorts of different\nregulations to the jot and tittle. And what Arizona\ndoes here is what 40,000 different localities can do if\nthis law is upheld, which is have -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: At the time the statute\nwas passed, there were many, many State laws that\nadjudicated revocation of licenses. Perhaps not many\nhad addressed the issue of hiring undocumented aliens,\nbut many State laws existed that independently\nadjudicated revocations. What in the legislative\nhistory or in the words of the statute show that\nCongress intended in any way to limit those\nadjudications?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Well, it's undoubtedly the\ncase that without the parenthetical, the mere\nparenthetical savings clause, that Arizona-like laws\nwould be swept away as sanctions, that these are\nsanctions imposed. So the question is whether the\nlicensing law phrase saves that. And I think it saves\nthe Federal -- State adjudication, and I think the\nanswer to that is no, because to read the statute that\nway is to permit all of those States to have their own\nlaws, and it's undoubtedly the case that Congress wanted\nto sweep away the De Canas-style State statutes that\nwere in place that imposed sanctions on employers. And\nso the -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, just so I\nget -- make sure I understand your approach. You're\nsaying that Arizona had a law saying you have to have a\nlicense to do business, and then it became aware of a\nproblem it wasn't aware of before -- it found out that a\nlot of employers were employing child labor, and they\ndidn't know they would do that -- and they say we can\nrevoke your license if you're determined to have\nemployed child labor; that that would not be okay?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Well -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it would be okay\nif, in the original licensing thing, they said \"and you\ncan't employ child labor\"?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Well, I think that the\nanswer depends on what Congress was trying to get at.\nIn 1986, we know what Congress was trying to get at with\nrespect to State enforcement of immigration laws. They\nbroadly swept away the De Canas-style laws, and they\nsaid, for the I-9 provision, which President Reagan\ndescribed as the keystone of the Act, that I-9 documents\ncan't be used in any procedure besides IRCA procedures.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the Chief Justice -\nthe Chief Justice can insist on the answer to his own\nquestion, but it seems to me his question is why isn't\nthat still a licensing law?\nGENERAL KATYAL: If it has independent\nadjudication, it is swept away by the first parts of the\n(h)(2) statute which say -- which say the provisions of\nthis section pre-empt any State or local law imposing\ncivil or criminal sanctions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But then, what -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But in the child labor\nexample, why isn't that a -- an addition to a regulatory\nlicensing scheme so that it's a licensing law?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Because if I understand --\nI may not understand the hypothetical, but the word\n\"provisions\" refers to the entire subset -- the entire\nstatute in IRCA, including the procedural protections -\nthe procedures that follow for Federal enforcement of\nthe immigration laws.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would you -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you had -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- read that section again?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was just going to\nsay you tried earlier to talk about the two boxes, and\nyou said something would be pre-empted by the first\nclause. Anything -- civil and criminal sanctions are\nallowed if they're imposed through licensing and similar\nlaws. There are not two boxes. The State can do what's\nin the first part so long as it does it through\nlicensing or similar laws.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Right. And our -- and our\nposition is that this is not a licensing law because it\ndoesn't bear any of the indicia of a traditional\nlicensing law, and -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it similar to a\nlicensing law?\nGENERAL KATYAL: No, I don't think so, that\nCongress -- Congress had in the -- when they used\n\"similar\" meant to sidestep the schematic debate about\nwhether something is a certificate, as some of the farm\nlabor contractor statutes use that term, or a license.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, that's all right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. O'Grady.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MARY R. O'GRADY\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMS. O'GRADY: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThrough their police powers, States\ntraditionally have the authority to regulate the conduct\nof employers within their jurisdiction to determine what\nconduct warrants issuance of a State license and to\ndetermine what conduct justifies suspending or revoking\nsuch a license. And although Congress pre-empted some\nof our traditional authority when it enacted IRCA in\n1986, it preserved significant State authority through\nthe savings clause that permits a State to impose\nsanctions through licensing and similar laws.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you answer the -\nthe anomaly that Arizona cannot impose a fine even in a\nmodest amount, but it can revoke someone's license to do\nbusiness?\nMS. O'GRADY: Your Honor, we think that\nlooking at the savings clause -- we don't view it as an\nanomaly. The structure that Congress established is one\nthat the State's authority is determined by the nature\nof the sanction that we choose to impose. We don't have\nthe authority to -- they -- they took away our authority\nto impose civil monetary and criminal sanctions but\npreserved our authority to impose sanctions through a\nsimilar law.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But underlying Justice\nGinsburg's question is why would Congress want to do\nthat?\nMS. O'GRADY: Well, I think it makes sense,\nYour Honor, because in terms of licensing, it -- it\nprovides some accountability, because we are the\nentities that establish policy for our licensees, and we\nare the ones accountable for whether that business\nremains in business or whether we're taking it away from\nthem. So it -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Perhaps Congress never\nexpected that the States would have to resort to such\nmassive measures, and they probably wouldn't have if -\nif the law had been uniformly enforced and vigorously\nenforced, right?\nYou -- you didn't -- didn't have any notion\nof doing this sort of thing in 1986, did you?\nMS. O'GRADY: Your Honor, certainly we\nwaited until 2007.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So maybe Congress wasn't\nworried about it because it seemed very unlikely that\nanything like that would occur.\nMS. O'GRADY: Perhaps. But I think also\nCongress was recognizing what this Court recognized in\nDe Canas, was that unauthorized employment has\nsignificant local consequences, so they did not want to\nfully pre-empt State law. They wanted to preserve State\nauthority -\nJUSTICE BREYER: The main -- the main\nanomaly seemed to me to be this, that in the Federal\nAct, as -- that was the first point that the Chamber\nmade, that it's a fairly careful balance. There are a\ngroup of people in Arizona, they may look as if they\ncome from Mexico or speak with an Hispanic accent, and\nyou're not certain whether they in fact are illegals or\nthat they're legal. Now, think of that category.\nCongress has passed a statute that gives the\nemployer just as much incentive to verify, so there's no\ndiscrimination, as to dismiss, so there's no illegal\nhiring. It's absolutely balanced. A $1,000 fine for\nthe one, a $1,000 fine for the other.\nSo Arizona comes along and says: I'll tell\nyou what, if you discriminate, you know what happens to\nyou? Nothing. But if you hire an illegal immigrant,\nyour business is dead.\nThat's just one thing they do. Now, how can\nyou reconcile that intent to prevent discrimination\nagainst people because of their appearance or accent -\nhow do you reconcile that with Arizona's law?\nIf you're a businessman, every incentive\nunder that law is to call close questions against hiring\nthis person. Under the Federal law, every incentive is\nto look at it carefully.\nMS. O'GRADY: Your Honor, a couple of\npoints. First, in terms of how our law works, we do\nhave a prohibition against investigating any complaint\nthat's based solely on race. So if we get a complaint\nthat says those people all look Mexican or Hispanic,\nthat does not get investigated under Arizona law, first.\nWe also have criminal penalties if frivolous complaints\nare filed.\nBeyond that, we have the use of E-Verify,\nwhich is an added protection for employers to prevent\nthe hiring of unauthorized aliens. So if they use\nE-Verify, if they're in good-faith compliance with the\nI-9 process, they have no risk of exposure under Arizona\nlaw, just as true under Federal law.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm -- doesn't it\nfrustrate the congressional intent when the Federal law\nsays that the I-9 can be used for no purpose other than\nthe Federal adjudication of whether a violation has\noccurred or not? Doesn't it frustrate that law to have\nthe States raise a defense that depends on forcing\nsomeone to disclose something that the Federal law\nprotects?\nI mean, this is a vicious circle. Federal\nlaw says you can't do the I-9 for -- you can't use it\nfor any purpose other than the Federal adjudication.\nNow you're creating a defense that says you have to\nsupply us with something that Federal law otherwise\nprotects from disclosure.\nMS. O'GRADY: Your Honor, we don't think\nthat the Federal law prohibits the use of an I-9 -- of\nthe I-9 -- an employer's use of the I-9 in a State\nproceeding, that these can be used under the Federal\nproceeding or under the State.\nBut, beyond that, if at some point in an\nactual enforcement action it was determined that Federal\nlaw did have that impact, they would still have that\ndefense available to them. They would just have to, you\nknow, prove it up in a different way other than use the\nform.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That doesn't answer my\npoint. Doesn't it frustrate Federal law when the\nFederal law says that I-9 can be used for no purpose\nother than the Federal adjudication of the status of\nemployees? I think that's -\nMS. O'GRADY: Here -- here's what the law\nsays: It may not be used for purposes other than for\nenforcement of this chapter. And we believe that\na State enforcement action, under the authority for\npreserving sanctions through licensing and similar laws,\nwould fall within that. So we think they should be able\nto use that; the employer should be able to use that.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't there -- isn't there a\ndifference between saying it may not be used for any\npurpose other than for enforcement of this chapter and\nother provisions of Federal law, on the one hand, and\nsaying, on the other hand, it may not be used for any\npurpose other than in a Federal proceeding? The\nenforcement -- the I-9 certainly could be used in a\nFederal proceeding by the employer. Would that then -\nwould that be used for the enforcement of the Federal\nlaw? I wouldn't think so.\nMS. O'GRADY: That's true, Your Honor.\nThat's -- that -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is the I-9 -- I do have a\nquestion on the I-9. I'm not certain. I thought under\nFederal law that if the employee -- the employer isn't\ncertain, but the employee says here's my Social Security\ncard, here's the driver's license. The employer looks\nat that, he's home free; is that right?\nBut under Federal -- under your law, under\nArizona law, he's not home free, and, moreover -\nbecause he -- it may -- he's not home free. He still\ncould be prosecuted. Is that right or not?\nMS. O'GRADY: No, that's not right, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So if he shows the driver's\nlicense -- under -- under Arizona law, if the -- if he\nshows a driver's license and Social Security card, the\nworker, the employer looks at it, the employer cannot be\nprosecuted?\nMS. O'GRADY: Well, Your Honor -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes or no?\nMS. O'GRADY: We would need the evidence\nthat the person knowingly employed the unauthorized\nalien and a good-faith defense through use of a -\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So -- I thought\nin reading it that it creates some kind of presumption,\nbut he is not home free?\nMS. O'GRADY: No, Your Honor. The -- the\nsubstantive -\nJUSTICE BREYER: But under Federal law he is\nhome free.\nMS. O'GRADY: The substantive requirements\nunder Arizona law and Federal law are the same. We're\nimposing no new obligations. And -\nJUSTICE BREYER: So then he's home free?\nLook, I don't -- I'm trying to understand. Maybe it's\nnot enough time to explain it, but I thought Federal law\nrequires this E-9 business or whatever that E review is.\nAnd I was worried about the E review which it seemed to\nrequire because it seemed to me in 20 percent of the\ncases where the notice is this guy is not authorized; we\ndon't have any record that he's authorized to work -- 20\npercent of those are wrong, and he is authorized to\nwork.\nSo the employer who follows that is really\ngoing to fire 20 percent of the people who will be\nabsolutely entitled to work. And so I'd just like you\nto address those points, as you wish.\nMS. O'GRADY: Okay. And let me walk through\nhow our law works to see if this addresses the concern.\nSo the -- Arizona doesn't change anything in terms of\nthe use of the I-9. We retain the same defense that's\nin the Federal law for good-faith compliance with the\nI-9. We do require employers to use E-Verify, although\nwe don't impose a sanction on that employer if they\ndon't use E-Verify.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you explain that,\nE-Verify, because this is a Federal resource, and the\nFederal Government has said we want this to be\nvoluntary. How can Arizona take a Federal resource,\nwhich the Federal Government says is voluntary except in\ncertain circumstances, and turn it into something that's\nmandatory?\nMS. O'GRADY: We think the -- that question\nis answered by looking at -- into the conflict\npre-emption analysis, because Congress didn't address\nthe role of the States with regard to E-Verify. And we\naren't -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't -- I don't get\ninto any pre-emption or not, but it's -- Arizona wants\nto use a Federal resource. And the Fed makes it\navailable if the employer can use it voluntarily, but\nnot mandatorily. How can -- how can Arizona set the\nrules on the use of a Federal resource?\nMS. O'GRADY: Your Honor, we can -- as long\nas it's not a burden to the objectives of Congress, we\nthink that we can require employers within our\njurisdiction to use E-Verify.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do -- do you make it\nmandatory?\nMS. O'GRADY: Well, our statute says you\nshall use E-Verify. We don't impose a penalty against\nemployers who fail to use it. The consequences are the\nsame as they are under Federal law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You just -- you just don't\nget the safe harbor. Isn't that the only consequence?\nMS. O'GRADY: That's right. You don't get\nthe safe harbor under E-Verify. Now -- for the use of\nE-Verify. We did add after this lawsuit was filed some\nadditional requirements similar to what they have under\nthe Federal system, where you can't get State contracts,\nyou can't get State grants.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you are taking the\nmechanism that Congress said will be a pilot program\nthat is optional, and you are making it mandatory. It\nseems to me that's almost a classic example of a State\ndoing something that is inconsistent with the Federal\nrequirement.\nMS. O'GRADY: Well, again, we look at the\ntest for conflict pre-emption in terms of, does this\nmake it impossible to comply with Federal law? No, it's\nreally a question of are we interfering with\nCongress's -- excuse me -- the Federal Government's\nability to achieve its goals? And the goal in\ndeveloping E-Verify is to have a more effective\nverification system.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If they fail to do it, then\nthey cannot receive any, quote, \"grant, loan, or\nperformance-based incentive,\" end quote, from the State.\nThat's what the law says, isn't it?\nMS. O'GRADY: That's what -- and that was\nadded after this lawsuit was filed.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. I would think\nthen the answer to Justice Scalia's question is, yes,\nthere is that penalty. It isn't simply hortatory.\nMS. O'GRADY: Well, there's no penalty in\nterms of -\nJUSTICE BREYER: You don't go to jail.\nMS. O'GRADY: -- you get fined -\nJUSTICE BREYER: What you do is you lose any\ngrant, loan, or performance-based incentive. Is that\nright?\nMS. O'GRADY: That's true under current law.\nThat's not what the plaintiffs challenged -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does this lawsuit challenge\nthat?\nMS. O'GRADY: That -- it does not, Your\nHonor. They just challenged subsection (A) -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're under the old law,\nand the only -- the only sanction is you lose the safe\nharbor, if that's a sanction.\nMS. O'GRADY: That's right. That's right,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, in answer to\nJustice Breyer's earlier question, in fact, relying on\nthe I-9 does not provide a safe harbor, because under\nthe E-Verify system, you can't just rely on the I-9\nforms and statutes; you have to rely on the E-Verify.\nMS. O'GRADY: Well, Your Honor, we have the\nsame -- it's modeled after the Federal law. So, just as\nFederal law has a defense for employers who in good\nfaith follow I-9, so does the State law. I -\nJUSTICE ALITO: The Federal law and the\nState law do seem to be exactly the same on this point,\nbut I have -- I don't understand how these two\nprovisions fit together when E-Verify is used.\nSuppose an employer -- the first thing the\nemployer does is receive the forms from the employee,\nfrom the I-9 process. He looks at the forms. Well,\nthey reasonably seem to be authentic. So that employer\nnow has the good-faith defense that's provided under -\nby the I-9 process, under both Federal law and State\nlaw.\nBut, under both Federal law and State law,\nthe employee -- employer either must or may also use the\ne-verification system. The employer gets back a notice\nof non-authorization. But what -- and that creates,\nsupposedly, a rebuttable presumption under both systems\nthat the employee is not authorized to work.\nHow does that fit together? If you have a\ncomplete defense for having used the I-9 process in good\nfaith, the whole e-verification process seems to be\nirrelevant under both Federal law and State law. I\ndon't understand how they fit together.\nMS. O'GRADY: And, Justice Alito, we haven't\nwrestled that in practical application, and I'm not\naware of them reaching that point under the Federal\nsystem, either, but -- because it does seem at some\npoint, if you -- that the system should work, that if\nyou have used I-9 and you get back a final\nnon-confirmation, not a tentative non-confirmation, that\nthat employee is unauthorized, that that, you know,\nseems like it should carry greater weight in an\nenforcement action. But as a -- as an -- on an\nas-applied basis, I'm not sure how that plays out in an\nactual enforcement action.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could you -- I\nwasn't quite sure what she meant. Judge Schroeder, in\nher opinion for the court, emphasized that this statute\nwas being evaluated on its -- on its face and that -\nshe said in as-applied, particular challenges might\narise.\nHow would that work? If we determine this\nis not pre-empted, how would -- on its face, how would\nan as-applied challenge come about?\nMS. O'GRADY: I think, Your Honor, perhaps\nif we -- perhaps in terms of what are the outer limits\nof our definition of \"license\" and their saying that we\nare outside the definition of licensing and similar laws\nin a particular case, perhaps that would be an\nas-applied-type challenge.\nI think some of the I-9 concerns are perhaps\nmore appropriately resolved in a -- in a direct case\nwhere that issue has arisen on an as-applied basis, and\nI think she was concerned about some of the real\nimplementation questions that were wrapped into the\nlegal challenge.\nBut, for the most part, I think the general\nframework of our statute is appropriate for -- in this\nchallenge.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you think after this\ncase we could look forward to cases, one by one, for all\nthe various types of licenses? Those would be\nas-applied challenges and would not have been resolved\nby this case.\nMS. O'GRADY: Your Honor, my hope is that\nwe've got -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We're really wasting our\ntime here, aren't we?\nMS. O'GRADY: My hope is, Your Honor, that\nwe get sufficient guidance -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Wouldn't -- wouldn't it\nbe easier, if that's Justice Scalia's concern, to take\nthe Solicitor General's position, that if you're\nadjudicating good faith or intent differently in any way\nfrom the Federal Government, that it's pre-empted?\nIsn't that what waiting for an as-applied challenge\nmeans, whether or not you are putting different\nrequirements on proving good faith?\nMS. O'GRADY: No, Your Honor, and -- because\nI was trying to give some examples of the kinds of\nthings that may come up as a practical matter, but I\nthink we can get the guidance from this Court. I hope\nthat we can proceed in implementation, but -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, let -- then let me\nask the question directly. If Arizona's system does not\npermit a employer to rely on non-suspect documents, the\nI-9 documents that are permitted employers to rely on -\nthe Arizona system says, no, you can't rely on those.\nIs that pre-empted or not?\nYou can't rely on I-9, or the Arizona system\nsays -- on the I-9 documents. Or the Arizona system\nsays you can't hire someone who hasn't been approved\nunder the e-verification system. Is that pre-empted?\nMS. O'GRADY: I think those would both be\nproblems. I think we need to be consistent with the -\nthe structure and the obligations that are imposed under\nFederal law in terms of our sanctions provisions.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, are you -- are you\nconceding that any variation from the Federal standards\nfor -- for criminal and civil liability is automatically\nprecluded?\nI mean, as I read the exception, it's an\nexception for State licensing and similar laws. And it\ndoesn't say \"so long as those licensing and similar laws\ngo no further than what the Federal Government has\ndone.\" I mean, we often allow States to impose\nregulatory requirements that go beyond the regulatory\nrequirements that the Federal Government has imposed,\nand that is not automatically considered to be\npre-empted. So why -- why are you conceding that\nArizona cannot go a whit beyond what the Federal\nGovernment says?\nMS. O'GRADY: Because I think what Congress\npreserved for us was our ability to impose sanctions,\nincluding the suspension and revocation of State laws.\nBut I do think they established a uniform national\nstandard. I don't think we could, for example,\nestablish a -- a strict liability offense in Arizona.\nWe'd have to have a scienter requirement as they have in\nFederal law.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, what I was trying to\nget is -- what I was looking at specifically is Federal\nlaw says, if you look at the driver's license and Social\nSecurity card -- those are I-9 docs -- then the employer\nhas established an affirmative defense and has not\nviolated the law. That's what it says. You know the\ncite -- 27a or whatever. Okay? That's the Federal law.\nArizona law that I was reading -- maybe\nthere's another place I should read -- is it says, on\ndetermining whether he's an unauthorized alien, the\ncourt -- the court shall consider the Federal\nGovernment's determination. It creates a rebuttable\npresumption. That means it might be rebutted. Okay?\nSo I see a difference there. And the reason\nthat that's relevant is because, my first question, if\nyou are an employer, prior to your law, it's 50/50. I\nbetter verify because if I'm discriminating, you know,\nda, da, da. And it's not that hard. I just look at the\ndriver's license and I look at -- I'm home free, and the\nSocial Security card, and if I hire an illegal\nimmigrant, the same thing, da, da, da. Okay? So same\nboth ways.\nYour law: Employer, look at the driver's\nlicense and Social Security, you are not home free.\nEmployer, if it turns out that you've been hiring this\nillegal immigrant and he's not an American, your\nbusiness is finished. But what happens if I\ndiscriminate? Under our law? Nothing.\nNow, that was the original point they made.\nThat's why I brought up this question of difference in\nstandards. And I want to be absolutely clear what your\nanswer to that is.\nMS. O'GRADY: And I'm hoping I am being\nclear, Justice Breyer. We have the same standards as\nFederal law. We have the same I-9 defense that's in\nFederal law.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, where? Where is it\nin the statute, then? Because what I read were the\nwords \"rebuttable presumption,\" and I might be reading\nthe wrong words.\nMS. O'GRADY: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So tell me where it is.\nMS. O'GRADY: Okay. Let me get to it, and\nlet me explain our rebuttable presumption while I find\nthe specific statutory cite for our I-9 process.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, it's on page 184 to\n185 of the appendix to the petition, isn't it?\nMS. O'GRADY: Yes. And 178a is the\nprovision: For the purposes of this section, employer\nthat establishes it has complied in good faith with the\nrequirements of 8 U.S.C. 1324a(b) establishes an\naffirmative defense, et cetera. So that's the provision\nthat provides the I-9 defense.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So the -\nMS. O'GRADY: The rebuttable presumption\nissue -- and this is how that comes into play. We have\nto, in bringing an enforcement action, have to rely -\nthe State, in making its case, has to rely on\ninformation from the Federal Government regarding\nwhether someone is authorized or unauthorized. We have\nto rely on that information from the Federal Government.\nWe bring our action in State court if we have\nverification from the Federal Government that that\nperson is unauthorized. We have additional information\nthat we've established the scienter requirement, then we\nbring our action. But the employer has an opportunity\nto rebut the evidence that we've presented in a State\ncourt proceeding. It may be, you know, that person\ndoesn't work for us or some other type of evidence. So\nthat's the role of that rebuttable presumption, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay, thank you. I see\nthat.\nMS. O'GRADY: Certainly. So in terms of the\nprior adjudication -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Just so you know, I\ninterpret your answer as confirming the implication of\nJustice Breyer's question, that there is a very\nsubstantial difference in Federal and State law on this\npoint. I mean, you've told about -- you know what\nlawsuits are about. If you're -- if you're home free by\na driver's license and Social Security inspection under\nFederal law and you're not under State law, that is a\ndifference -\nMS. O'GRADY: And our standards are the\nsame. And it's subsection (J) in which we have the I-9\naffirmative defense in our State law and our Federal -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think you are\nhome free under State law?\nMS. O'GRADY: To the extent that you would\n-- should be home free and you'd have the benefit of\nthat good-faith defense.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's an affirmative\ndefense under both.\nMS. O'GRADY: Yes, Your Honor. But having\nthe -\nJUSTICE BREYER: The main point -- I mean,\nI'll check that. I think maybe I was mistaken, perhaps,\nin that I was looking at the other section.\nMS. O'GRADY: That's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But then we're still stuck\nwith this enormous discrepancy in penalty. I mean, I'm\ncharacterizing it as enormous, but it seems like the -\nyou know, it's even on discrimination versus under the\nFederal law. It's not even -- your business is out to\nlunch, gone, and on the other side it has nothing. What\nabout that one?\nMS. O'GRADY: I think, Your Honor, that that\nis the natural consequence of the savings clause that\nCongress itself adopted.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The savings clause itself,\nthe word \"licensing\" -- not everyone looks at this, but\nI did look at the legislative history. And when you\nlook at that paragraph on page 39 of the red brief, it\nseems to me that that paragraph says what it means. It\nsays precisely what it is. It says -- the first thing\nit says is that, look, if you're found to have violated\nthis -- where is it? It's page -- there it is.\nSuppose somebody has been found to have\nviolated the sanctions provision in the Federal\nlegislation. Now, you've found -- he has been found by\nthe Federal Government. Then what the State does, it\ncan revoke his license. Okay? That's one thing. And\nthe second thing it says it wants -- doesn't want to\npre-empt \"'fitness to do business laws,' such as State\nfarm labor contracting laws or forestry laws.\" In other\nwords, it's thinking of some precise set of licenses,\nand that's why this licensing thing was there. And the\nvery next part of this Federal law are conforming\namendments, and those conforming amendments apply to\ndepartments of government that were concerned with\nmaintaining State farm labor contractor laws.\nNow, I grant you, you have to go beyond the\ntext, but some of us do because we get enlightenment.\nAnd going beyond that text, it seems to me we should\nfollow what that House report says. Now, what is your\nresponse to that?\nMS. O'GRADY: Well, first, of course, we\nwould focus on the text where Congress could have but\ndid not -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, I've got -\nMS. O'GRADY: -- limit -- they didn't limit\nit.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I said yes, I've got broad\nlicensing -- but let's deal with the part where you look\nat their explanation as to why they put those words\nthere.\nMS. O'GRADY: Okay. First, the farm labor\ncontractor is simply an example, and I think it says\n\"such as\" an example of the type of licensing provisions\nthat existed at this time that addressed that. So\nthat's not an all-inclusive universe of sanctions that\n-- of -- of all the licensing laws that might be subject\nto this. They also don't specifically say there has to\nbe a prior Federal adjudication. That sentence has\npassive voice, \"has been determined,\" without specifying\nwho is making that determination, and it specifically\nrefers to State and local processes that provide for the\nsuspension and revocation of State licenses.\nAnd then the sentence goes -- then there's a\nfollowing sentence that says, you know, further, we\ndon't intend to disrupt laws such as these forestry and\nother, you know, fitness to do business.\nWe think this is a fitness to do business\nlaw in that we are establishing as a State standard that\nif you engage in this conduct of knowingly employing\nunauthorized aliens, we are going to have the ability to\ntake an action against that license that we have given\nyou to do business in our jurisdiction. So we think we\nfit within that last sentence of the -- of the -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you also explain the\nI-9? You said it's the same as in the Fed. Home free\nif you have documents, Social Security, driver's\nlicense. But you also require the E-Verify. So how -\ndoes the E-Verify information modify the I-9? How -\nhow do those two -\nMS. O'GRADY: They work in our system, Your\nHonor, as they do under the Federal law, under -- that\nyou get a rebuttable presumption if you -- in your favor\nif you've used E-Verify, but the affirmative defense if\nyou've used I-9. And I am -- there is that caution; it\nis good-faith use of -- of the I-9 system. We do have\nexamples where, for example, if an employer is\nterminated because they are unauthorized and they show\nup with a different name and different papers 2 weeks\nlater, you're not going to be able to establish your\ngood faith. So you're home free but subject to that\ngood-faith limitation. But we do incorporate the same\nobligations that exist under Federal law.\nAnd also I wanted to address more on the\nfarm labor contractors and the amendments. And what we\nthink that they were doing in those amendments was\nsimply dividing responsibility at the Federal level\nbetween the Department of Labor and their processes that\npre-existed IRCA, and what they were establishing in\nIRCA, and said we're not going to have these\ndeterminations of whether they -- the farm labor\ncontractor has employed an unauthorized alien through a\nDepartment of Labor process; we're going to instead use\nthe IRCA-established process.\nBut, importantly, what Congress did not\nchange in the agricultural worker regulations was the\nprovision that addresses State law. It said, before\nIRCA and after IRCA, that those laws -- those Federal\nlaws only supplement the authority of the States and\nthat means that they preserved all of the State\nauthority that they had before IRCA in the area of farm\nlabor contractors. And that I think is reinforced by\nthe legislative history that -- that again reinforces\nthat those have been preserved through IRCA.\nThis is an area that has traditionally been\nwithin the mainstream of State police power. We\nacknowledge that Congress does have the authority to\npre-empt us, but they left important discretion in terms\nof our ability to impose sanctions through licensing and\nsimilar laws, and we are doing so by establishing this\nscheme that provides for the suspension and revocation\nof State licenses.\nIt's an important part of the balance that\nCongress struck when it enacted IRCA by addressing what\nState authority would exist after that congressional\nenactment. We think the lower courts properly\ndetermined the scope of that provision.\nAnd unless there are further questions, I\nthank you for your attention this morning.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Phillips, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand, once again, may it please the Court:\nI want to begin frankly where Justice\nSotomayor pointed me to before, which is the question of\nwhether or not there really is a basis for allowing the\nStates to independently investigate and to independently\nadjudicate these matters. And what is the evidence that\nCongress did not intend that?\nJustice Breyer quoted from the House report,\nrecognizing not everybody accepts that, but it does seem\nto me to articulate a very commonsense limitation that\nsays you have to have a Federal adjudication in the\nfirst instance, and once you've got that, then the State\nis allowed to add that sanction.\nThat -- that principle, it seems to me, is\nreinforced by the limitation on what you can use the I-9\nfor. Justice Alito, you asked that question, but it\ndoes seem to me quite clear that what Congress\nenvisioned in 1986 when it adopted this is you're going\nto have an exclusively Federal enforcement scheme\nincluding the adjudicatory process, and it is only in\nthat context that you are allowed to use the I-9. And\nthe notion that the State could adopt a standard of\nintentional or knowingly, and not be able to have the\nI-9 materials available, seems to me flatly at odds with\neach other, and, therefore, it cannot be that Congress\nintended under those circumstances to allow these\nmatters to be adjudicated in that particular fashion.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What can -- Mr. Phillips,\nwhat can the State do that would be complementary rather\nthan conflicting?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I -- it seems to me the\neasiest -- and of course, this has nothing to do with\nwhat Arizona does -- but the easiest is, if a -- an\nemployer is convicted of -- of violating IRCA and a\ncriminal sanction, and he happens to be a barber, and\nthe State licensing law says if you're convicted of a -\nof a Federal crime you will lose your license, it is\navailable to the State under those circumstances -- and\nI think this is exactly what Congress had in mind -- to\nissue a notice to show cause why that particular person\nshouldn't have the license revoked and then go from\nthere.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Convicted by -- by a\nFederal Government that hasn't gone after many\nconvictions.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Scalia -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's the whole problem.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, no. But,\nJustice Scalia, it seems to me the whole question here\n-- and first of all, I don't think pre-emption can be a\nmoving target. I think you have to decide it on a basis\nof what Congress had in front of it in 1986. But\nremember, Congress was balancing three, at least, very\ndifficult problems: minimizing burdens on the\nemployers, minimizing discrimination against people who\nare permitted to be hired, and avoiding hiring people\nwho are not permitted to do so.\nAnd how you properly reconcile that is very\ndifficult, but the one thing that seems to me clear is\nthat that was a choice Congress meant to leave to itself\nand to the Federal Government to sort out and not to\ngive the States the opportunity to come in where they\ndid.\nAnd to say one last word about E-Verify -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, except -\nwell, you're just kind of blinking over the savings\nclause: except through licensing and similar laws. So\nthat's not a real reservation by Congress of this power\nto itself.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, if you -- if you\ninterpret the savings clause as I do, which means truly\nas a supplement to Federal -- Federal adjudication, then\nit is a very narrow limitation on that basis, because at\nthat point you've already invoked the entirety of the\nFederal scheme, and it doesn't modify the balance on\nthose broader legal issues, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
