        "content": "(10:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in Number 00-799, the City of Los Angeles v. Alameda\nBooks, Inc.\nMr. Klekner.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL L. KLEKNER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. KLEKNER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nFollowing its 1977 pioneering study, the City of\nLos Angeles enacted a, in 1978 a comprehensive zoning\nordinance regulating the location of all types of adult\nbusiness activities in the city. The ordinance defined\neight business activities and required that they each be\nseparated from each other by 1,000 feet.\nNotwithstanding the clear intent of the city's\nordinance in 1978, it became apparent that the ordinance\ncould and was being interpreted to permit more than one\nadult business in the same building. This has been\ndescribed by plaintiffs as a drafting error inadvertent\nloophole, but it was an ambiguity, and it became necessary\nto amend the ordinance in 1983 to remove that ambiguity,\nthereby --\nQUESTION: Do we know if, at the time the\nordinance was enacted -- 1977?\nMR. KLEKNER: '78, sir.\nQUESTION: '78. Do we know if, at that time,\nthere were businesses like the one at issue here, i.e., a\nplace where they have both sale and rental and viewing --\nMR. KLEKNER: I presume --\nQUESTION: Do we know if those businesses\nexisted in that form in 1978?\nMR. KLEKNER: I believe they did. I don't\nbelieve --\nQUESTION: All right.\nMR. KLEKNER: -- that the study specifically\nanalyzed specific combinations in one building.\nQUESTION: All right.\nMR. KLEKNER: That wasn't the purpose of the\nstudy.\nQUESTION: Well, your clients didn't have\nbusinesses like that. Your clients just had one or the\nother, wasn't it? What did they start off with?\nQUESTION: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\nMR. KLEKNER: Our clients are innocent.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: The businesses regulated here did not\noffer both. Which did they offer when the ordinance was\ninitially passed?\nMR. KLEKNER: I'm sorry, I did not hear the\nquestion entirely, sir.\nQUESTION: When the ordinance was initially\npassed, which of the two types of business did they offer?\nMR. KLEKNER: Well, these businesses started in\nthe late eighties, early 1990's, either as a bookstore or\nas an adult arcade.\nQUESTION: That's what I'm asking, which --\nwhich?\nMR. KLEKNER: But it was well after the adoption\nof the ordinance.\nQUESTION: Which did they start as, a bookstore,\nor as an arcade?\nMR. KLEKNER: My recollection is that each -- I\nthink it was Highland Books started as a adult arcade, and\nthe reverse was true for Alameda Books. It started as a\nbookstore.\nQUESTION: Did your evidence in '78 or any\nevidence since then specifically address the question of\nwhether the combination of more than one form of business\nat one location has any measurable effect on, you know,\nthe deleterious effect that you measured?\nMR. KLEKNER: No. The studies did not\nspecifically look at combination of adult businesses in\none place, or in one building. They looked at the\nclustering effect in the city's various communities.\nQUESTION: Am I wrong in thinking that the study\nwhich you rely on, the 1977 study, did have as one\ncategory bookstore/arcade. It had as discrete entities\nthe massage parlors, the adult theaters, and the adult\nmotels, but it was my understanding that the arcade plus\nbookstore, or video sales shops, that those were together\nin that 1977 study.\nMR. KLEKNER: The answer is yes and no. That\nphrase appears several times in the study and in certain\nconclusions, but if you look at the -- at certain of the\nquestionnaires that were sent out to various businesses,\ncommunity groups, the individual businesses were\nseparately identified. In other words, a bookstore, peep\nshows, movie theaters, theaters, massage parlors.\nQUESTION: Well then, is there nothing to what\nwe're told, that the -- this combination of video sales\nplus viewing is common and, indeed, an arcade can't\nsurvive as a stand-alone business, that the combination\nof, you can see it, and if you want it you can buy it, was\ncommon?\nMR. KLEKNER: Well, the issue of separateness,\nand whether a business, an arcade and a bookstore can,\ncould, or should survive separately is off the table. It\nwas not part -- there was a stipulation that the -- that\nthat would not be considered. That's not before the\nCourt. As the record now stands, I guess the Court would\nhave to presume, as did the trial court and the court of\nappeals, that survivability, economic viability of\nseparate businesses or combined isn't an issue for this\nCourt' --\nQUESTION: Well, each of these businesses was\none or the other of those things and operated on that\nbasis alone for how long?\nMR. KLEKNER: Several years. I can't --\nQUESTION: Do you know whether they operated at\na profit or at a loss?\nMR. KLEKNER: We never did any discovery on\nthat, so the answer is, we have no way of knowing.\nQUESTION: But they did it for a couple of\nyears, anyway?\nMR. KLEKNER: Correct.\nQUESTION: They were only an arcade and there\nwas no selling going on when they were initially launched?\nMR. KLEKNER: It's my understanding that they\nmight have sell -- excuse me, sold some books, or what-\nhave-you, but their primary business was having a series\nof video booths where you could watch adult movies.\nQUESTION: I get the opposite impression. Maybe\nI was misled by the briefs. I thought they had always\noperated as a combined business. You say that's wrong?\nMR. KLEKNER: Not based upon the facts as I\nunderstand them, sir.\nQUESTION: Pardon?\nMR. KLEKNER: Not based upon the facts as I\nunderstand them, that -- and I believe in 1991 it was\nAlameda Books that became both, and it was I think 1992\nthat Highland Books became both. I might be off by a year\nor so, but there was a point in time where both -- where\neach location became both adult business activities.\nQUESTION: I'd like to ask you -- I'll assume\nwith you for the moment you don't need any evidence. I\nsuppose you don't imagine -- forget the evidence question.\nAll right, I take it that this ordinance -- and I'm also\nassuming it, assuming this, you could have a particular\nplace, 5,000 feet of books, or you could have 5,000 cubic\nfeet of books, or you could have 5,000 cubic feet of\narcade, but you couldn't have 5,000 cubic feet of both,\nall right. Now, my question is, what's the theory behind\nthat?\nMR. KLEKNER: The theory is the solution, not\nthe facts. If you go from jurisdiction to jurisdiction,\nthe facts tend to support the same conclusion, that\nconcentrations of adult businesses cause secondary\neffects. How do you solve that problem? And the city's\ndecision was, because of the clustering effect, we termed\nit like a farmer's market type of effect for adult\nbusinesses, that dispersal was the solution.\nSquare footage, you could have 5,000 square feet\nof this, or maximum, is a different solution, based upon,\nNew York did that in their solution. They decided that\nthe space limitation, square foot limitation was\nappropriate for New York. That was not part of the\nsolution for Los Angeles. It was a complete dispersal\nof --\nQUESTION: All right. Now, if, in fact, there\nis no space limitation, I would repeat my question, that\nit seems a fortiori if you can have a bookstore of\ngigantic size, or an arcade of gigantic size, but you\ncan't have the two together, even of a little size, so I\ndon't -- I'm not talking about evidence. I'm assuming,\nthough, you have to have some theory, and the theory has\nto be a reasonable one, and it can't just be we want to\ncensor everything, so what's the theory?\nMR. KLEKNER: The theory is simply the solution\nadopted by the city of Los Angeles was to disperse. If,\nin fact, we were faced with the megastore concept that,\nyou know, the Wal Mart of adult bookstores, then that\nwould be a different problem, that we could address in the\nfuture, at least as I understand this Court's precedent,\nbut that's what we were faced with in 1977. We were faced\nwith the need to protect the city's neighborhoods from a\nlot of smaller businesses, if you will, and the solution\nwas, we'll trade size, if you will, for dispersal. New\nYork, for example, said 500 --\nQUESTION: But it still doesn't answer the\nquestion, exactly. If the city wanted to address the\nconcentration of adult businesses, certainly the 1977\nstudy likewise addressed that, didn't it?\nMR. KLEKNER: Correct.\nQUESTION: But now we're talking about an\nordinance that doesn't focus on the concentration of adult\nbusinesses but, rather, the combination, because the city\ndoesn't want the business to break into two parts, even\nthough it tried to operate as one business, and I guess\nthe 1977 study didn't address the combination, the effects\nof a combination of focuses in a single business, whereas\nyour ordinance does.\nMR. KLEKNER: Well --\nQUESTION: As opposed to a concentration of\nbusinesses.\nMR. KLEKNER: There are several responses to the\nquestion. The first is that, as you -- as I understand\nhow you use the term, business, you're talking about a\ncorporate organization or a single proprietorship. That\nis not what the city's ordinance deals with.\nQUESTION: -- operated as a single store, a\nsingle business.\nMR. KLEKNER: From the city's perspective, it is\nillogical, or not reasonable to say, for the city council\nto say, you know we have a problem here, on LaSeneca\nBoulevard, because we have two many adult businesses\ntogether, so we're going to require them to disperse.\nThere is no issue as to how we define these adult\nbusinesses. That's not before the Court.\nQUESTION: Well, what if the ban were, you can\nsell adult VHS tapes but not Beta tapes in the same store?\nMR. KLEKNER: We haven't done that, and --\nQUESTION: Well, it's the same thing. Can you\nbreak it down any way you want and say, it's fine because\nwe're concerned about the --\nMR. KLEKNER: Because we are concerned with the\noverall effect we have broken down the ordinance to its\nlocal components. We have not tried to somehow slice and\ndice definitions so that you have several different types\nof retail adult establishments.\nQUESTION: Do all of the categories that you\nhave in the ordinance exist in the real world out there,\nvideo arcades only?\nMR. KLEKNER: Yes. They did in 1977. They did\nin 1991.\nQUESTION: Adult bookstores only --\nMR. KLEKNER: Correct.\nQUESTION: -- without arcades in them --\nMR. KLEKNER: Correct.\nQUESTION: -- and so forth, every one of the\ncategories, adult movies only?\nMR. KLEKNER: Correct. Each of these\ndefinitions, if you will --\nQUESTION: When you started out, though, there\nweren't all that many tapes. There were books, adult\nbookstores. Now, isn't the video much more prevalent\ntoday --\nMR. KLEKNER: Actually, it's my under --\nQUESTION: -- and you seem to say that the\ncombination of this list, you think of a bookstore,\nnowadays one can browse, one can even go to a cafe and\nhave coffee, and all that, or go to a record shop and\nlisten to the tape and then buy it. That combination of,\nI view it and then buy it or not, that seems to be a\nnatural combination, unlike having half of my\nestablishment a massage parlor and the other half a book\nshop.\nMR. KLEKNER: The problem with your real-world\ndescription of a Barnes and Noble is, it doesn't exist in\nthe adult entertainment world. The evidence that was\nbefore the trial court was that the books, the magazines,\nthe sex toys, the novelties, are all shrink-wrapped. You\ncannot go into an adult bookstore, sit down and have your\nStarbucks, and browse through the material.\nQUESTION: And you don't prevent them -- you\ndon't prevent these stores from allowing customers to\npreview the films before they decide whether to buy them,\nthe stores that sell adult films. The ordinance doesn't\nprevent them from allowing customers, at no charge, to\nview the films before they buy them, does it?\nMR. KLEKNER: If I understand the correct -- the\nquestion correctly, no.\nQUESTION: Under the ordinance, can a customer\ncome in and say, before I buy this film, I would like to\nsee it, and the store manager says sure, go ahead, look at\nit first, then you can decide whether to buy it?\nMR. KLEKNER: For free?\nQUESTION: For free.\nMR. KLEKNER: Yes.\nQUESTION: The ordinance permits that anyway,\ndoesn't it?\nMR. KLEKNER: We are talking about --\nQUESTION: But they want to charge for it.\nMR. KLEKNER: And the machines that allow you to\nview up to 60 clips, if you will, from various adult\nmovies, or you go to another machine in another booth, you\ncan -- I want to see that entire movie right there, as\nopposed to the clips.\nQUESTION: What is your principal argument in\nopposition to the rationale in the court of appeals? I\nhave the feeling we're not letting you make the principal\nargument here that you wanted to make.\nMR. KLEKNER: The principal problem with the\ncourt of appeals decision is, of course, how it\nrequires -- what it requires, the use of secondary effects\nand how it is discounts, if you will, or disregards this\nCourt's precedent, is effectively what the court of\nappeals has said. Not only must we have empirical\nevidence of secondary effects in general, which the city\ndoes have, but you must also show that in this particular\ncase this combination contributes to that secondary\neffects, which I submit is going to be, on an empirical\nbasis, next to impossible to do. The third --\nQUESTION: If it's next to impossible to do, why\nshould you be allowed, under the First Amendment, to do\nit? I mean, it sounds as though you're kind of making an\nargument from spectral evidence here. You're saying,\nwell, the evidence that we've got doesn't demonstrate the\nproblem that we're addressing, but we ought to be able to\naddress it anyway. I mean, isn't that what it boils down\nto?\nMR. KLEKNER: The problem we were addressing\nwas, is there a correlation, to use the term you used, the\nword you used in Barnes --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. KLEKNER: -- between the adult businesses\nand secondary effects, do they cause a problem. We have\ndocumented that.\nQUESTION: And you've documented it, but as I\nunderstand it, you've documented it with reference to\nadult businesses which were not at the time defined or\nidentified as necessarily being businesses that offered\nonly one service, as opposed to a business like these,\nthat offers two, so that the evidence, as I understand it,\ndid not address the issues that is before us now.\nMR. KLEKNER: But it did address that issue,\nbecause it is not reasonable to assume that if you have\ntwo businesses side by side in the same block, causing\nsecondary effects, that it can require them to disperse,\nwhich is entirely --\nQUESTION: Yes, but we're -- I think we're\nplaying with words. You're talking about two businesses\nside by side, and you were measuring the effects back in\n'78 of businesses side-by-side. This is one business.\nIt's not side-by-side. It's one business that sells two\nthings within the same storefront.\nMR. KLEKNER: But there's no evidence one way or\nthe other --\nQUESTION: Isn't that your problem?\nMR. KLEKNER: I don't believe it is -- it should\nbe a problem.\nQUESTION: You measured -- you measured the\neffect of a video store -- what do you call these, arcade\nstore, and a bookstore side-by-side, and you found that\nthat was deleterious, and the problem is that you did not\nmeasure what the different effect would be if you knocked\ndown the wall between them. Is there any reason to\nbelieve that that would make a difference?\nMR. KLEKNER: That's the whole point that the\ncity's been trying to make all along. There's no\ndifference in effect. You can't assume --\nQUESTION: Well, you don't know --\nMR. KLEKNER: -- less or more.\nQUESTION: How do you know that, any more than I\nknow it? I mean, I see your point when you say, look, if\nthere are two different entrepreneurs on a block, each of\nthem doing whatever they can to draw in clientele, the\nodds are they're probably going to draw in a greater\nconcentration of people than one. I mean, I will accept\nthat, as at least intuitive.\nHere, we're talking about one entrepreneur, and\nwhat seems at least intuitively arguable in the first\nplace doesn't seem to be so obvious in the second\ninstance.\nMR. KLEKNER: But you are describing this in\nterms of business organization.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. KLEKNER: Which is not how the city's zoning\nordinance works. The zoning ordinance does not really\ncare whether you're an L.L.P., a corporation on-shore or\noff-shore, or a sole proprietorship. Under the reasoning\nthat you're putting forward, I could open up at a location\njust because I have one company, as many adult businesses\nas I wish, or alternately, in order to get around the\ncity's ordinance, the two side-by-side companies,\nbusinesses form a new corporation, they merge, now we have\none corporate entity, ergo, we're home free. That's\nnot --\nQUESTION: And the -- but the likelihood that\nyour 1978 evidence is going to bear on these various\npossibilities depends on more specific facts. If the two\nside-by-side entities that merge are, on the one hand, a\nmassage parlor and a bookstore, it seems sensible to say\nthey're going to be drawing the same concentrations of\npeople that they would have as separate entities.\nBut when you're talking about combinations like\nbooks and video, it isn't obvious that you're going to be\ndrawing different concentrations of people, and I think\nwhat we're stuck with here is that your evidence, through\nno fault of Los Angeles in '78, but your evidence just\ndoesn't address the question as specifically as we have it\nbefore us now.\nMR. KLEKNER: If you look at the nature of the\nbusinesses, you come to an arcade to stay there and look,\nand when you leave that arcade, you have a different frame\nof mind than if you went to the bookstore, got your\nshrink-wrapped magazine, put it in a brown paper bag, and\nwent home, so that's one logical deduction you can make\nfrom all of the evidence that's before you.\nQUESTION: Isn't it an equally logical deduction\nthat by looking at the cover of the shrink-wrapped\nmagazine and watching part of a video clip, or a video\nclip of something that you ultimately buy, you're going to\nbe left in about the same frame of mind in either case?\nMR. KLEKNER: No. I think after watching 60\nclips from adult business, from adult videos, as opposed\nto the cover of a shrink-wrapped magazine -- the only\nreason --\nQUESTION: Aren't the -- maybe the magazine\ncovers are dull, but I --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: -- assumed they were pretty racy, and\nif you look at 60 covers and 60 clip -- I don't know,\nthat's cutting it pretty fine.\nMR. KLEKNER: Justice Souter, they're not live\naction.\nQUESTION: Mr. Klekner --\nMR. KLEKNER: That's the difference.\nQUESTION: Mr. Klekner, your question presented\nseems to be quite narrow. It says, is a city zoning\nordinance which prohibits the operation of more than one\nadult entertainment business at a single location,\nincluding an adult bookstore and an adult arcade, invalid\nbecause the city did not study the negative effects of\nsuch combination?\nMR. KLEKNER: Correct.\nQUESTION: It seems to assume the city did not\nstudy the combination but, rather, relied on judicially\napproved statutory precedent from other jurisdictions. I\nassume that's some reference to the Hart case from the\nCarolinas.\nMR. KLEKNER: Correct, North Carolina.\nQUESTION: Because the Ninth Circuit said that\nwasn't suitable reliance, is that right?\nMR. KLEKNER: Well, basically what the --\nQUESTION: The Ninth Circuit, I thought, thought\nthat wouldn't do it because Hart addressed the health\neffects --\nMR. KLEKNER: No, what the Ninth --\nQUESTION: -- of the arcades, rather than the\neffects on crime.\nMR. KLEKNER: What the Ninth Circuit effectively\nsaid was, there was some doubt whether Hart would survive\nscrutiny under this Court's Renton decision, but we are\ncertainly confident that under Ninth Circuit precedent\nit's not a valid law. The purpose of Hart --\nQUESTION: I don't know, it just struck me in\nreading the question that it was pretty much limited to\nwhether they were right about whether you could rely on\nthe Hart decision.\nMR. KLEKNER: Hopefully not. The city in 1983\nspecifically relied on its findings in 1977, the study\nthat led up to the original ordinance, which as I said is\nnot at issue. That ordinance is reasonably --\ncomparatively reasonable, according to plaintiffs.\nThe problem is -- well, the issue with Hart is,\nHart was decided in 1979. It said that the city's '77\nstudy, just as we --\nQUESTION: Before the adoption of this\namendment?\nMR. KLEKNER: That's correct, that in 1979, our\nstudy supported a North Carolina statute prohibiting more\nthan one adult business in the location, that that was a\nsufficient evidentiary basis. Confirming what the city\ncouncil thought --\nQUESTION: The Ninth Circuit thought that Hart\nrelied on the negative health effects of the arcade.\nMR. KLEKNER: We are less -- we, the city, is\nless concerned with the factual differences than with the\nlegal reasoning and the fact that it fully supports, and\nshould have been considered for that purpose by the Ninth\nCircuit, as validating the intent and purpose of the\noriginal ordinance and '83's amendment.\nQUESTION: Well, what we're getting down to is\njust how precise a particular study or a particular\ndecision has to be. I mean, does it have to be word for\nword what the city is talking about, or can the city draw\nreasonable inferences, if it affects A, it also affects B?\nMR. KLEKNER: That's what hopefully the -- well,\nthat's what the city has been trying to do, but again, it\ngoes back to, you know, if you look at your precedents,\nwhen a city has these problems, the logical -- the logical\nthing for the city to do is say, ban them. We can't.\nIt's a violation of the Constitution. We accept that.\nThat's what Renton says. If you can't ban them, you\nshould be entitled to a reasonable opportunity to\nexperiment.\nQUESTION: And where I'm a little confused is,\nat the beginning of this segment of the argument, when we\nbegan focusing on this question, I thought you said\nsomething to the effect that we can't show this\nempirically, and I was surprised. I thought you would\nsay, look, this isn't rocket science. If you have just a\nshoe store, and the shoe store all of a sudden starts to\nsell clothes, you're going to get more people. That's the\nend of it.\nMR. KLEKNER: But --\nQUESTION: I thought that's what you were going\nto tell, but you --\nMR. KLEKNER: When you -- well, maybe I\nmisspoke, but when you want to get into the empirical\nevidence of, are you a bad actor, this particular business\nis a bad actor, it's a very detailed nuisance type of\nanalysis, and when you have these combinations of adult\nbusinesses, or side-by-side adult businesses, and you try\nto do that same analysis, the immediate thing that is\ngoing to occur, the first thing that is going to occur,\nit's not me, it's my neighbor, it's not me, it's this\nother part of the business.\nWe can't be expected to provide for a\nlegislative scheme that detailed particularization of each\npossible permutation and combination of the problem.\nThat's exactly what Young and Renton stand for.\nQUESTION: Let me ask you --\nQUESTION: Why doesn't --\nQUESTION: Go ahead.\nQUESTION: No, please.\nQUESTION: Let me ask you just one general\nquestion. We often have said, the cities can rely on\ngeneral experience of other cities and other studies, and\nso forth and so on. Are there a lot of ordinances out\nthere that follow the pattern of this particular\nordinance, that would prohibit a single business from\noperating both a video arcade and a bookstore in the same\nlocation?\nMR. KLEKNER: There are some, Justice Stevens.\nThere are others that would permit such combinations,\ndepending upon how the city that's -- a particular\njurisdiction analyzed the solution.\nQUESTION: But there are a substantial number\nwho are similar to the one that we're talking about today?\nMR. KLEKNER: I won't use an adverb to describe\nthe amount. There are some. I don't know if it's\nsubstantial or not.\nQUESTION: That's an adjective.\nMR. KLEKNER: Excuse me, yes.\nQUESTION: May I go back to Justice O'Connor's\nquestion, because she asked how the Hart facts could help\nyou. As I understand it, the facts in that -- number 1,\nthe basis for municipal action in that case was public\nhealth, and it was public health based on the sexual\nactivities that were going on inside the booths, and as I\nunderstand it, Los Angeles in effect has an ordinance that\nrequires open booths, lights on, freely seen -- the booths\ncan be freely seen from the front of the store, and so on,\nso it seems to me that Los Angeles has taken steps to\npreclude the health problem that that earlier case\naddressed and, if that's so, how could that earlier case\nsupport the Los Angeles ordinance?\nMR. KLEKNER: Well, again, the Hart reading of\nfacts in that decision, again go to the fact that these\ncombinations cause problems, and that the city's\nordinance -- excuse me, the city's study supported the\ninference that it's okay to -- the solution is to separate\nthese businesses.\nQUESTION: Yes, but the Hart -- as I under --\nmaybe I'm wrong, but I thought the basis for the\ngovernmental action in Hart was public health based on the\nactivity that was going on in these booths.\nMR. KLEKNER: In part, yes.\nQUESTION: Yes, so it seems to me that it's off\npoint for you.\nMR. KLEKNER: If there are no further questions,\nI'd like to reserve the remainder of my time. Thank you.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Klekner.\nMr. Weston, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. WESTON\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. WESTON: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please\nthe Court:\nAt the time we filed our briefs, we knew of no\nordinances similar to Los Angeles prohibiting the\nsimultaneous inclusion of an arcade and retail sales\nwithin one establishment, other than the one that was in\nHart v. Edmisten. At the time the city adopted it, it\nitself -- let me rephrase that. At the time the city\nadopted it, the only one that apparently existed in the\nUnited States was the one in North Carolina and,\nsubsequent to the city's adoption, as far as we knew,\nthere were no additional ones throughout the United\nStates. This is an enormously unique and unusual approach\nto a problem apparently not supported or shared by the\nexperiences of other cities.\nQUESTION: Do you know of any other cities that\nhad the experience of businesses such as the two involved\nhere, which were originally involved in one sex pandering\nactivity, and then, after the ordinance was passed, went\ninto a second one instead of opening up a separate store?\nMR. WESTON: Justice Scalia, you'll --\nQUESTION: I mean, you know --\nMR. WESTON: You'll --\nQUESTION: -- they may be unique, but the\nsituation that they confronted may be unique as well.\nMR. WESTON: You'll pardon me for not adopting\nthe reference of the Court in phrasing the nature of the\nbusiness, but in fact the opposite is quite true.\nRespondent's businesses at all times, as is made clear in\nthe joint appendix at pages 19 and 20, as discussed at\ngreat length at page 6 of respondent's brief, particularly\nin footnote 6, at all times operated their arcades in\naddition to retail distribution, retail dissemination on\nthe premises, in the same establishment of sexually\noriented materials.\nQUESTION: That's not how I read those pages.\nShall we turn to them, page 20 of the appendix?\nMR. WESTON: Please.\nQUESTION: Highland Book was issued a picture\narcade police permit. Prior to June of 1991 the only\nadult type of business use of Highland Books was its\npicture arcade, which at all times exhibited exclusively\nadult video tapes.\nMR. WESTON: Right.\nQUESTION: This is the affidavit of the owner of\nboth of these businesses.\nMR. WESTON: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Mr. Wiener, right?\nMR. WESTON: Yes, that's correct, Justice\nScalia, but the point, the use of the term, adult\nbusiness, was in the way that Los Angeles defined a use,\nand that if the Court will continue a little bit\nfurther --\nQUESTION: But that's the only thing that's\nrelevant here.\nMR. WESTON: No, with all respect, Your Honor.\nUp until sometime in 1989 -- well, let me phrase it this\nway. For a considerable period of time in California, law\nexisted such that the term, substantial numbers of retail\nmaterials -- that was the operative term which separated\na -- an adult bookstore from a nonbookstore. In other\nwords, if one -- one could operate the bookstore and carry\na certain amount of adult material and not be denominated\nadult.\nQUESTION: Was he considered really another\nbusiness?\nMR. WESTON: That's correct.\nQUESTION: It was ancillary to the other\nbusiness?\nMR. WESTON: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. WESTON: Up until a very recent time in Los\nAngeles history, one could carry up to 49 percent of\nmaterials in one store and not be deemed to be an adult\nbookstore.\nQUESTION: This was a Los Angeles County\nordinance --\nMR. WESTON: No --\nQUESTION: -- you're referring to now?\nMR. WESTON: No, what I'm referring to is\nCalifornia court decisions which had interpreted the\nphrase, substantial number, amount of retail stock in\ntrade.\nQUESTION: In the county ordinance? We're not\ntalking about a State law, we're talking about a county\nordinance?\nMR. WESTON: It wasn't a law, Your Honor. In\nother words, the California courts of appeal had construed\nthe term, substantial portion of the stock in trade, to\nmean anything less --\nQUESTION: Why did they -- why were they -- why\ndid they construe that term? Where did the term come\nfrom?\nMR. WESTON: The term came -- was an identical\nterminology utilized in many, many, ordinances throughout\nthe State of California. There was a vagueness challenge\nbrought to it, and the court construed the term to mean a\npreponderance, more than 50 percent of stock in trade in\norder to avoid the vagueness. That --\nQUESTION: This was a phrase used in a number of\ndifferent city and county ordinances --\nMR. WESTON: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- in California?\nMR. WESTON: Absolutely, and in fact it's\ninteresting to note, because we've spoken about Hart this\nmorning, that the North Carolina statute in Hart was one\nthat pegged the definition of a retail bookstore as a\npreponderance. In other words, unless the store carried\n51 percent of its stock in trade as adult materials in\nHart itself, it would not qualify as an adult bookstore,\nand --\nQUESTION: And that's what you think Mr. Wiener\nmeant when he said in his affidavit, prior to June of 1991\nthe only adult type of business, the only adult type of\nbusiness use at Highland Books was its picture arcade\nwhich at all times exhibited exclusively adult videotapes?\nMR. WESTON: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And you think he had in mind that no\nmore than 49 percent of other business was --\nMR. WESTON: If I may read --\nQUESTION: That's what the next sentence says.\nMR. WESTON: Yes. Thank you, Justice Stevens.\nThe next sentence, Justice Scalia, prior to June of 1991,\nthe majority of items available for retail sale at\nHighland Books were of a nonadult variety.\nQUESTION: That's why the only adult business he\nwas doing there was the other one. They were of a\nnonadult variety.\nMR. WESTON: But that's --\nQUESTION: He's not saying we were selling adult\nbooks, but selling less than 50 percent of adult books.\nHe said the only other business we had was a nonadult\nbusiness.\nMR. WESTON: Justice Scalia, forgive me, I can\nonly tell you what the circumstances were. The\nphraseology that was utilized tried to use the\nterminology, the confusing terminology that Los Angeles\nused in terms of its description of what a use is, and Mr.\nWiener at the time sold and displayed vast quantities of\nsexually oriented retail materials in the same stores, but\nunder the L.A. ordinance at the time, it did not\nconstitute an adult use.\nQUESTION: Well, I appreciate your testimony to\nthat effect, but what his affidavit clearly says is that\nthe only adult business he did prior to 1991 was the\nexhibition of adult videotapes. The majority of the items\navailable for retail sale were of a nonadult variety.\nMR. WESTON: Forgive me, Justice Scalia, I don't\nwant to belabor the point --\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. WESTON: -- but that's not a fair reading of\nit. Prior to June of 1991, the only adult type of\nbusiness use, the type of business use at Highland Books\nwas its picture arcade. That is defined exclusively, that\nterm refers exclusively to 1270 of the Los Angeles zoning\nordinance which defined a use and labeled a use a\nbusiness, and the only way that one became an adult\nbusiness and therefore a separate use was if one's stock\nin trade was 51 percent or more adult.\nMr. Wiener's was not. It was substantial, but\nit was not a preponderance, and therefore the notion that\nthis existed as an arcade bereft of and separate from any\nretail use is simply neither accurate factually nor\nsupported by the declaration that was offered.\nQUESTION: I don't understand what this 51-49\npertains to. Does it pertain --\nMR. WESTON: Stock in trade of the retail\nestablishment.\nQUESTION: Well, and it means that if 49 -- if\nless than 51 percent is adult material, you're not --\nMR. WESTON: It's not -- at the time, in Los\nAngeles, it was not characterized as an adult use --\nQUESTION: As an adult business.\nMR. WESTON: Adult use or business, that's\ncorrect.\nQUESTION: Right, okay, but it doesn't mean that\nif you have 51 percent in one adult business and 49\npercent in another adult business, the 49 percent is not\nan adult business? Does it mean that as well?\nMR. WESTON: That is correct. The 49 percent of\nadult retail material did -- acted to -- let me -- if I\nmay phrase it the other way. 51 percent of stock in trade\nat a business in Los Angeles, if it was adult, made that\nstore adult, even if it was 20,000 total items, and\nvirtually, and nearly 10,000 of them had nothing to do\nwith sexually oriented material.\nQUESTION: Mr. Weston, I understand that that\ndivision, that that was by inventory not by sales.\nMR. WESTON: That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.\nQUESTION: Because one of the problems was, you\nhad lots of books, dull books that nobody was going to\nbuy, and that you had -- that was what you had for 51\npercent, and then you had the stuff that people bought,\nand that was the 49 percent.\nMR. WESTON: The record does not reflect that,\nJustice Ginsburg. That may have been the fact although,\nof course, the opposite may have also been true.\nQUESTION: But it's true that it would not have\nbeen considered an adult bookstore so long as they\nmaintained that 51-49.\nMR. WESTON: That's correct, and if I may, as in\nHart, Mr. Wiener's initial businesses, as they were\ninitially constituted, did not conflict with the multiple\nuse provision, notwithstanding the fact that 100 percent\nof the videotapes viewed in them were adult, and 49\npercent or up to 49 percent of the retail items available\nfor sale were also adult.\nQUESTION: But can I --\nMR. WESTON: That did not constitute two adult\nuses under California law at that time, and that is\nexactly what the law was in Hart, that it was perfectly\npermissible to have 100 percent adult arcade material, and\n49 percent retail books, videos and so forth, and that\nwould not have conflicted with the prohibition in Hart.\nQUESTION: Could you -- can you explain -- I'm\njust trying to get back to the main point here, at least\nas I understand it, which may --\nMR. WESTON: Yes, Justice Breyer.\nQUESTION: And don't assume I know a lot of the\ndetail that you know. I want to start this naively, so I\ntake it what they're saying is, look, we have a zoning\nordinance. We have to have some way of defining what's a\nsingle business. If it were a liquor ordinance and we\nsaid, selling liquor wholesale is one thing, selling it at\na bar is another, so that's two uses, not one. If it were\na meat store which said, over-the-counter is one thing, at\nthe restaurant is another -- of course we could do it a\nmillion ways.\nMR. WESTON: Certainly.\nQUESTION: But we have to do it some way, and so\nforget whether there's evidence or not. Just let us do\nwhat's reasonable here, and this is one, and by the way,\nif it were a different kind of ordinance, if it were a\ncubic foot limitation, the fact that they counted it as\ntwo separate things rather than one, would cut in your\nfavor, but here it happens to cut against you.\nMR. WESTON: Well --\nQUESTION: But they say, either way, we're just\ntrying to have a reasonable definition. All right, now\nyour response is what?\nMR. WESTON: Well, initially. I think Your\nHonor -- Justice Breyer, you have characterized fairly in\nsome sense the city's position, because the city basically\nsays, so logistically, if it's an adult business it\ngenerates secondary effects, and if there is secondary\neffects and there is adult business regulation not\namounting to a ban, we can do anything we want, and courts\nare directed not to look meaningfully at it, and it simply\ngets dealt with as a valid ordinance.\nBut the problem with what Los Angeles has done\nis that, unlike what would be logical, or unlike what most\nzoning agencies do, which is to take a combined business\nsuch as Your Honor posits and zone it according to the\nmost intense of the combined uses, Los Angeles, for\nexample, makes reference to the fact that it deals with\nservice stations and auto repair places differently, but\nthe remedy that Los Angeles selects for that is not to\nsay, an auto repair place must be here, and 1,000 feet\naway there must be a place where you -- I've said it\npoorly, but that you cannot have an auto repair place\nhere, combined with a place that pumps gas, even though\nthere are separate uses. What Los Angeles logically does,\nas every city does, is permit the combination and then\nzone the combination use according to the most intense of\nthe combined uses.\nQUESTION: No, but that's a bad analogy, because\nauto places are not -- try liquor. Try thinking of it\nliquor, and probably they could. They'd say, we only want\none liquor license in 1,000 feet, and if you have a bar\nyou don't have a shop, and it then becomes less obviously\nunreasonable on its face.\nMR. WESTON: Let's take a --\nQUESTION: So let's assume it in their favor\nthat way, and then argue against it.\nMR. WESTON: Sure. Let's take a look at that\none. But what does Los Angeles do? It doesn't ban the\ncombined use, it simply again -- I don't mean Los Angeles.\nIn your hypothetical, in the bar-restaurant, the zoning\nregulation would be appropriate for the more intense use,\nI assume --\nQUESTION: But this whole question is something\nthat's secondary. I thought the question before me is\nwhether or not Los Angeles is reasonable in saying that\nthe combined use draws more people without having a study.\nI fully understand that you have an objection to the\nGovernment bifurcating your business. Leave that off the\ntable, so the only question is whether or not this whole\nbusiness draws more people, and whether or not there's an\nempirical basis for it. Isn't that what I'm supposed to\ndecide here?\nMR. WESTON: I'm not quite sure about drawing\nmore people. I don't think that that was what the -- that\nwas not the focus of what Los Angeles was concerned --\nQUESTION: You mean, you had the arcade because\nit didn't draw any more people?\nMR. WESTON: No, it wasn't more people, it was\nthe notion for a variety of reasons, and if we return to\nYoung v. American Mini Theatres, there is at least --\nthere's some indication in Young that it's not simply a\nquestion of people, but rather, what is the perception\nfrom the outside world?\nQUESTION: Well, but not simply a question of\npeople, but surely the kind of secondary effects that have\nbeen spoken of in cases depend upon people's activities,\nand the people aren't 10 miles away, they're somehow\nassociated with the business.\nMR. WESTON: Certainly. I -- that's\nunquestionably reasonable, Mr. Chief Justice, but the\narticulation by Los Angeles in its statement of\nlegislative purpose, which appears at -- it's at page 74\nof the appendix to the petition for certiorari, and I'm\ntruncating it, but two or more adult entertainment\nbusinesses, operated as a single commercial enterprise.\nThis concentration of adult entertainment businesses tends\nto have an adverse impact on the neighborhood in which\nthey are located.\nThe hypothesis, the asserted harm, was from a\ncombination of adult businesses, and what was the evidence\non which Los Angeles relied for this proposition? The\nsole evidence was a study that measured not, as has been\nbrought out earlier, whether there were harms unique,\nthere were special harms that developed from a combination\nof two businesses within a single unitary establishment,\nbut rather, whether there were secondary effects that\nresulted from the clustering of a dozen, or 15 or 20\nunrelated adult businesses.\nQUESTION: At some point, Mr. Weston, don't you\nthink the legislature is entitled to draw what might be\ncommon sense inferences from the studies that it made, and\nthat it doesn't have to have empirical evidence for every\nsingle thing that it does in the ordinance?\nMR. WESTON: Of course not, Your Honor, and for\nexample, if the city, as it suggests, which we do not\nagree with, really thought -- I don't mean to cast\naspersions on the city. If, in fact, the city's sense\nthat this adult bookstore-arcade combination was so unique\nand so unusual, even though there's no evidence in the\nrecord of an arcade standing alone anywhere int he United\nStates, except as part of an adult bookstore, but if it\nwas so unique that they really hadn't dealt with it, one\ncould understand that it would be appropriate, as the city\nhas, to accord zoning treatment to this combined use,\nwhich is exactly what was done here.\nThe combined use is not free from the zoning\nrequirements of the City of Los Angeles. This combined\nuse is 1,000 feet away from any other adult use. It's 500\nfeet from any of the protected sensitive areas, and it is\nwithin the limited commercial zones which the city says it\nhas to be.\nQUESTION: Mr. Weston, incidentally on the other\npoint, I reviewed your footnote. I tend to read footnotes\nquickly. You were right on our other point.\nMR. WESTON: Thank you, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: On --\nMR. WESTON: I'm going to go home now.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WESTON: I thank the Court for its courtesy.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WESTON: This is a memorable day for me.\nQUESTION: It seems to me that if you're\nobjecting to the municipality's use of this other study,\nwhich didn't treat combined stores, you -- it seems to me\nyou have to tell us why it would be likely that combining\nthe diverse businesses under one roof could make any\ndifference. I mean, you have situation 1. You have a\nwhole block full of adult businesses, a video store, a\nmovie house, a bookstore, blah, blah, blah, okay, the\nwhole block full.\nSituation 2, you have the same block. They're\njust not different stores. It's just one big -- you know,\nit's just Adult, Inc., and on one side there's the, you\nknow, the arcade, and then the next part of the store\nthere's the movie house, and so forth. Why in the world\nwould there be any difference in the two situations as far\nas its impact upon the community is concerned?\nMR. WESTON: There are a number of responses to\nthat, and they require a bit of articulation. They're a\nlittle bit different, and as I was starting to say before\nin terms of Young v. American Mini Theatres, the sole\nevidence, essentially, in Young v. American Mini Theatres\nwas an affidavit submitted by a man by the name of Mel\nRavitz.\nIn that case, one of the things that Ravitz\nstressed -- and this was, of course, the first\nconcentration zoning, the first case that upheld\ndiscriminatory zoning in a sense of motion picture\ntheaters according to the nature of the content of the\nmaterials exhibited there, and the basis was, of course,\nthat the reason for the legislation was not because of the\nmaterials but, rather, because of some unique secondary\neffects associated with them, and this was a very unusual\nordinance. It was an anti-Skid Row ordinance originally\nto which Detroit, long after the original ordinance had\nbeen adopted, added adult businesses, and Ravitz' point\nwas this, that there's a self-fulfilling prophecy that\ndevelops in a neighborhood when residents or prospective\nnew residents or business people or whatever come into a\nneighborhood and they see lots and lots and lots of\ndifferent storefronts, let's say soup kitchen, a rescue\nmission, pawn shops, adult bookstore, Sam's Adult Arcade,\nor even your excellent idea, the adult emporium --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WESTON: -- and as a result, this then\nbecomes a self-fulfilling prophecy of the imminent decline\nof a neighborhood.\nSo from the Young perspective, from the sense of\ndeclining property values, it becomes very different from\nhaving the eight or nine adult businesses to which Your\nHonor referred to close proximity in one block, or two\nblocks, which all of a sudden says tenderloin, or red\nlight district, or whatever, as opposed to one single\nstorefront that says, Highland Books, and which does not\ncause the visual --\nQUESTION: But it doesn't have to say that. I\nmean, they're entitled to, you know, to divide the\nstorefront into each of its components and have a sign on\none that says, you know, adult videos, and then in the\nnext bay have a sign that says, movies, and then the next\nbay, adult books, and so forth.\nMR. WESTON: But that's no different --\nQUESTION: I don't see any difference between --\nMR. WESTON: But that's no different, Justice\nScalia, from a single 7-11 store that says, bananas for\nsale, 99 cents today, rutabagas a dollar and a half, and\nCoca-Colas on sale here. It's --\nQUESTION: Mr. Weston, in that respect, would\nyou be making the same argument that you are now making\nfor tapes plus arcade, sales of tapes plus arcade, if the\ncombined uses were a massage parlor and an adult hotel?\nMR. WESTON: That's a very fair and good\nquestion, and I've been thinking about that one for a\nlong, long time, and I think the easy answer to it is\nsimply that with respect to the massage parlor there would\nbe no First Amendment interest to protect, and therefore\nit wouldn't raise the question. Now, that's a cute\nlawyer's answer. It doesn't really help, I know, what\nyou're, obviously what, Justice Ginsburg --\nQUESTION: Well, I guess you'd say the same\nthing about the adult motel.\nMR. WESTON: Absolutely, and --\nQUESTION: Although some people might consider\nthat expression.\nMR. WESTON: Absolutely, and in fact I did say\nthat in FW/PBS v. City of Dallas, when one of the three\ncomponents was an adult motel, but interestingly -- and\nI'll try to address the combination question, but\ninterestingly, and this is one of the things that makes\nthe L.A. study suspect to begin with, is that of the 88\nadult uses that were focused on by the police department\nand the planning department in Hollywood, 41 of them -- I\nbeg your pardon. Of the 9 -- of the 88 uses, 41 of them\nwere either massage parlors or adult motels.\nQUESTION: Well, I don't think that question is\nfairly subsumed in the question presented. I mean, I\ndon't think there was any challenge below to the validity\nof the '77 study so far as it went.\nMR. WESTON: No, you're exactly right, Mr. Chief\nJustice, there wasn't a challenge specifically to it, but\nas we --\nQUESTION: There wasn't a challenge specifically\nto it. Are you suggesting there was some unspecific\nchallenge to it?\nMR. WESTON: The specific challenge that was\nmade was whether the study supported the city's stated\npurpose that combining a bookstore and an arcade in one\nestablishment, in one physical structure, caused the kinds\nof problems, the only problems which the study evaluated\nand found and, in fact, in the city's own papers it makes\nclear, and we set this forth in page 2 of the respondent's\nappendix, we note to it, rather, in joint appendix 109,\nthat on the contrary, the --\nQUESTION: Respondent's --\nMR. WESTON: I beg your pardon. I've been\nconfusing.\nQUESTION: The red brief, in page 2?\nMR. WESTON: Forgive me, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI've misspoken. At joint appendix, the beige document,\npage 109, there is language from the study that points out\nseveral respondents commented that the adverse effects,\nsecondary effects, are related to the degree of\nconcentration, and that one freestanding business may\nhave no effect, and that's really what we're talking\nabout.\nJustice Ginsburg, with respect to your question,\ncould there be some issues with respect to combined uses,\nour great fear in terms of the parsing argument that we\nhave made is that if the city's novel and rather\nadventurous piece of legislation is upheld, that the next\nstep, as inevitably as night follows the day, will be to\nparse these business into smaller and smaller kinds of\nsubcomponents that --\nQUESTION: But you gave an answer that I didn't\nthink was just a glib lawyer's answer. You said books,\ntapes, those come under the First Amendment.\nMR. WESTON: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Massages don't.\nMR. WESTON: Right, and I --\nQUESTION: Yes, but what about combining a\nmotion theater and a bookstore?\nMR. WESTON: I would -- one would think that the\nsame kind of analogy as we have offered here would be\npresent, that with a motion picture theater and a\nbookstore there would appear to be no logical suggestion\nthat the two of them would generate any greater secondary\neffects than the motion picture theater alone. When we\ngot into area --\nQUESTION: Well, look at it a little\ndifferently. I understand your argument about arcades and\nbookstores being functionally connected, but with\nbookstores and motion pictures, I think the outburst\nargument has quite a lot of appeal. If you had them\nseparately owned and it would violate the ordinance, why\nshould it not violate the ordinance if you combine them?\nMR. WESTON: Well, I'm not sure that the\nseparate ownership is what constitutes the vice aimed at\nat the ordinance. It's rather that by the city's unusual\ndefinitional situation of calling different media\npresentations or different uses different businesses, in\nthe same sense like at a 7-11 the dairy section is a\nbusiness and the --\nQUESTION: It seems to me if you have a 7-11 and\nan A&P next door, it's the same problem as if they're\nowned by the same owner. I don't follow the argument when\nyou get to motion pictures and bookstores.\nIt seems to me that those two businesses\noperated by separate owners would have precisely the same\nsecondary effect as a single business operating both a\nmotion picture and a bookstore. Why am I wrong on that?\nMR. WESTON: I'm not aware of any data that\nwould suggest that the combination would -- the\ncombination in, Justice Stevens, in your hypothetical that\na theater and a bookstore together, I'm not aware of any\ndata that would lead one to reasonably conclude that the\ncombination of a retail use in a motion picture theater\nwould generate more secondary effects than what I assume\nwould be the more intense use, the motion picture theater\noperating alone.\nQUESTION: Well, you conceded a moment ago --\nQUESTION: That may be true -- go ahead.\nQUESTION: Go ahead. You --\nQUESTION: That may be true if you interpreted\nsecondary effects as just this look that the neighborhood\nhas by having the businesses strung along the block, but\nsecondary effects is also the number of people come who\nloiter, who drive around, who concentrate outside. Then\nthat is a secondary effect that it seems to me would be\nincreased by the two uses.\nMR. WESTON: I think that's fair, Justice\nKennedy. Certainly, if secondary effects is nothing more\nthan patronage, then I'm not sure that I could argue, but\nthat's not what the identified and hypothesized secondary\neffect is on the part -- from the city, and in analyzing\nthese ordinances, as I understand the Court's doctrine,\none looks at the specific legislation and the asserted\nstated purpose, asserted statement of purpose, which in\nthis case is whether the concentration of -- I should say,\nthe combination of adult businesses within a single\nunitary establishment causes the same kinds of secondary\neffects found by a clustering of 12 or 15 or 20 unrelated\nadult businesses in a very small area in terms of the\nneighborhood. That was the city's hypothesized,\nhypothesis.\nQUESTION: Yes, but isn't one way to pose that\nquestion to pose it the way Justice Kennedy did? The\nquestion is, does the particular combination increase the\ndegree of clientele, because we know that the greater the\nclientele, the greater the crime rate is going to be, so\nthere seems to me to be a factual basis for saying that\nthe clientele is a kind of a surrogate measure for those\nvery effects that the city can legitimately try to\ncounteract.\nMR. WESTON: With all respect, Justice Souter, I\nmust question the hypothesis that it is the clientele that\nwill cause the problems. I would --\nQUESTION: The amount of clientele is associated\nwith the problems. It may be that that clientele is\npreyed upon by other people who come in, but the fact is,\nI think, that the study shows an association between the\nnumber of people concentration to come to these businesses\nand the secondary effects of crime, et cetera, that the\ncity can do something to prevent.\nMR. WESTON: I --\nQUESTION: That's the hypothesis that I'm --\nMR. WESTON: I really don't think so in this\ninstance, because if that were, in fact, the hypothesis of\nthe city, surely, with all of the thought that they have\ngiven to this, there would have been an absolute size\nlimitation or a square footage limitation that was part of\nthe legislation to deal just with that problem, but they\nhaven't. As one of the questions before inquired, suppose\nit was a 50,000 square adult bookstore or an arcade or a\ncabaret.\nQUESTION: Maybe they could do that. You know,\nwe have a one-step-at-a-time principle, that the State\ndoesn't have to do everything it possibly could in order\nto validate what it has done. Maybe it should prohibit\nany more than 250 arcades showing sex videos at one place.\nIt just hasn't done that yet. It will get there when that\nbecomes a problem, I assume.\nMR. WESTON: And I suppose we'll be back here\nthen having to address that.\nQUESTION: You seem to be arguing that we should\ndecide this case on the assumption that the city's\nevidence, as it now exists, would not be a sustainable\nbasis for an ordinance saying, you can't have two -- you\ncan't have 25 different adult uses in one arcade. Do you\nwant us to decide -- are you saying that you're going to\ngo for broke, that we've either got to sustain that\nproposition, or you lose? Because I'm suggesting -- I\nmean, my question was mean to suggest that there's a\nfactual difference in degree. It may be very intuitively\nobvious that if you put 20 of these uses in one business,\nyou're going to bring in a lot of people, going to have a\nlot of problems.\nIt may not be intuitively obvious, and you may\nneed some specific evidence simply by combining videos and\nbooks, it may not be intuitively obvious that that is\ngoing to create the problem, so I'm suggesting a\ndifference of degree. Do you reject that?\nMR. WESTON: Not at all, Justice Souter. Of\ncourse there may be --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Weston.\nMr. Klekner, you have 2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL L. KLEKNER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. KLEKNER: Thank you.\nIn our reply brief we cite heavily -- in our\nreply brief we cite from the appellee's brief in Young v.\nAmerican Mini Theatres. Footnote 7 to our brief quotes\nthe purpose for clustering, which is to attract people.\nBasically, you're attracting unattended males on a frolic\non their own.\nMr. Wiener, in his, one of his declarations at\njoint appendix 230, why does he combine businesses? To\nattract patrons. Typically, unattended males on a frolic\non their own. There is no qualitative or quantitative\ndifference in the effect.\nQUESTION: Well, if you combine buying, they get\nout of the store. If you have only the arcade, they'll\nlinger longer.\nMR. KLEKNER: Well, that's -- they're -- you\ncannot expect an ordinance to solve everything in --\nQUESTION: I'm just questioning whether there's\ngoing to be more of a problem if you have the stand-alone\narcade, where to see the film to the bitter end you have\nto stay there, but you really like it, so you buy it, and\nyou get out quicker.\nMR. KLEKNER: Well, but that's an argument to\ngetting rid of the arcades. The purpose of these\nordinances is to spread out --\nQUESTION: But you can't --\nMR. KLEKNER: -- spread out the patronage, to\nmake sure that you don't have this clustering, this magnet\neffect. You know, if you want your sex toys and your\nvideos and your books you go to Third and Alameda because\nthat's where everybody goes.\nYou want to avoid that. That's the whole\npurpose of this, so it makes no difference, inferentially,\none way or the other if they're side by side or in the\nsame building, and inferences in this Court's precedent\ndoesn't require that we have conclusive evidence,\nempirical evidence. Paris Adult Theaters, Nixon v.\nShrink, case after case says you can rely on inferences,\nand if the issue is fairly debatable -- this is a\ndebatable issue, you draw -- you give deference to the\nlegislative judgment because you can draw different\ninferences from the same evidence.\nThat is what's been done here. We are -- thank\nyou.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\n"
