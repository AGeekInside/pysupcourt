        "content": "(11:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument next in Burton versus Stewart.\nMr. Fisher.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FISHER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nIn Sharp versus Pain, the Ninth Circuit\nopinion that first decided the question that's before\nyou today, the Ninth Circuit said, and I'm quoting:\n\"The rule of Blakely that the statutory maximum is the\nmaximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the\nbasis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict, was\nnot clear until the Blakely decision itself.\" The Ninth\nCircuit is simply wrong. In this Court's Apprendi\ndecision it laid down precisely that rule. At page 483\nof that decision this Court described the statutory\nmaximum concept as, quote, \"the maximum a defendant\nwould receive if punished according to the facts\nreflected in the jury verdict alone\" -- virtually the\nidentical language.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Fisher, you know,\nassuming we read it the way you read it, I've got a\nbasic problem that doesn't really surface until you get\nto the end of the briefs and I wonder if you would\ncomment on it at the beginning of the argument. That is\n-- or I'll put it in the form of a question.\nIs the decision which the judge makes here\nto sentence consecutively rather than concurrently, a\ndecision that requires the finding of any fact about the\ncommission of the crimes themselves or the circumstances\nof those crimes or about the defendant's character?\nDoes the judge have to make or does the\nfact -- some fact finder have to make a finding on any\nof those subjects -- crimes, circumstances, character of\nthe defendant?\nMR. FISHER: Yes, he does, Justice Souter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What is that fact?\nMR. FISHER: It's precisely the same kind of\nfact that the judge had to find in Blakely itself.\nUnder the Washington, Revised Code of Washington, the\nstatute, the statute for running sentences consecutively\nin the fashion that Mr. Burton's were run consecutively,\nrefers the judge back to the very same provision that\nwas at issue in Blakely itself, which is the aggravating\nfactors provision of Washington, which was formerly\ncodified at section 390 and is now codified at section\n400.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I thought the only fact\nthat had to be found was that, given the classification\nsentencing scheme Washington had, there would be, in\neffect, a free crime, no incremental punishment, unless\nthere were consecutive sentencing. That's not a fact\nthat falls within any of those categories of crime,\ncharacter, or circumstances.\nMR. FISHER: That would be a fact, Justice\nSouter, but that is not the way the Washington law\nworks. It is colloquially known as the free crime\naggravator. But in the Washington Supreme Court\ndecision in Hughes which is cited at the end of our\nreply brief the Washington Supreme Court made clear that\nto invoke that aggravator a court has to find that\nthere was extraordinarily serious culpability or\nextraordinarily serious harm that accompanies the\nmultiple offenses.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So it's a misnomer to say\nit's a mere free crime criterion? It's free crime plus\nsome further fact?\nMR. FISHER: That's right. And this Court's\ndecision -- I'm sorry. The Washington Supreme Court\ndecision in Hughes clearly lays that out. If you have\nany doubt about the way the consecutive sentences work\nin Washington, I want to give you one other citation, to\na new Washington Court of Appeals decision that\nconsiders a consecutive sentences imposed exactly the same\nway that Mr. Burton's was. That is to say, they are run\nconsecutively based on the clearly too lenient factor.\nThat case is called State versus Washington and it was\njust reported at 143 P.3d 606, 143 P.3d 606. The\nWashington Court of Appeals in that case, considering a\nsentence just like Mr. Burton's, says that it does\ntrigger and violate Blakely.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So the extra fact then is a\nlot like the sort of heinous, atrocious and cruel\naggravator? I mean, it's comparable to it?\nMR. FISHER: Exactly, it's part of the same\nlist. And as this Court said in Apprendi itself, that\nextra culpability, which is one of the ways this\naggravator can be met, is the quintessential type of\nelement that needs to be proven beyond a reasonable\ndoubt .\nJUSTICE BREYER: When you say extra\nculpability, do you mean the nature of the crime?\nSuppose there are three crimes all committed at the same\ntime -- murder, rape, and kidnapping.\nThey're all very serious crimes. And if you\nsentence them consecutively, you will take into account\nthat there were three. If you sentence them\nconcurrently, it doesn't matter. The Washington court\nsays, we're not just looking to the fact that murder or\nrape or kidnapping are serious; we're looking to\nsentence consecutively if do you more than that. You\nhave to look to see that the kidnapping was a special\nkind of kidnapping.\nMR. FISHER: That's right, Justice Breyer.\nIn section -- the current section is section 589 of\nthe Washington Code and it says that sentences shall run\nconcurrently unless the judge makes an extra finding of\nexactly the same type the judge is required to find in\nBlakely. And if you look at Blakely itself, remember\nBlakely involved concurrent sentences. And so what Washington\nis doing is saying all sentences should run concurrently\nunless there's an extra fact, something about the\nadditional crimes that would otherwise be running\nconcurrently, that simply requires the judge to go above\nand beyond the ordinary concurrent sentences and punish\nthose crimes separately.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But could the nature of the\nadditional crimes themselves satisfy it? In other\nwords, could the judge say, well, all three -- it might\nbe one thing if one were serious and the other two were\ntrivial, but all of these three are very serious. Now,\nthat's in effect a value judgment, not a finding of\ndiscrete fact. Could that value judgment satisfy the\nextraordinary criterion that Washington says there must\nbe in addition to free crime.\nMR. FISHER: No, it couldn't, and the\nWashington decision that I've cited to you will help you\nwith this, because it makes it clear that to trigger an\naggravator to run sentences concurrently, just as under\nBlakely itself, there has to be something above and\nbeyond the elements of the crime or the crimes\nthemselves. It can't simply be -- I'm sorry. It can't\nsimply be that there were three crimes committed\nand all three of them are very serious.\nIt has to be something about the crime, the additional\ncrimes, that takes it above and beyond the ordinary\ncommission of that crime.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. Fisher, even if\nit's true that there are other examples out there that\nmight qualify for that example, it's not true of this\ncase?\nMR. FISHER: I'm not sure I follow, Justice\nStevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In this particular case,\nthere was -- it was necessary to make an additional\nfinding of fact, even though there may be cases out\nthere in which you could get consecutive sentences\nwithout an additional finding of fact?\nMR. FISHER: You're certainly right that in\nthis case you needed to have an extra finding of fact.\nThere are some situations under the Washington Code and\nI believe in the majority of other States where it is up\nto the judge's discretion whether to run sentences\nconcurrently, and he could do it for the reason that\nJustice Souter described. So what Washington does in\nits respondent's brief is it cites these other State\ndecisions, from other States that simply have different\nsentencing systems than we have in Washington.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not sure I\nunderstand that. I mean, we have not held, for example,\nthat the fact of a prior conviction is something that\nhas to be submitted to a jury under Blakely. Why, if\nyou're determining that sentences run consecutively,\nisn't that just the same as looking at a simultaneous\nconviction and saying they're going to run\nconsecutively?\nMR. FISHER: Under some State systems that\nmight be the case, Mr. Chief Justice. However, in\nWashington the way that the code works is that judges\nare directed that for multiple crimes the sentences\nshall run consecutively.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you'd have --\nMR. FISHER: Unless they make the exact kind\nof extra finding, and it refers them to the precise same\nstatute that was at issue in Blakely itself.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you're saying\nthat that extra finding can't simply be that this is a\nconviction for a particular serious crime that's going\nto go unpunished otherwise?\nMR. FISHER: That's right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So under this system\nif you had a regime where if you're convicted of murder\nand you've been convicted of rape before that, you get\nan enhanced sentence beyond the normal murder sentence,\nthat would not contravene Blakely. But if you're\nconvicted at the same time for rape and murder and those\ntwo sentences run consecutively, you say that that does\nviolate Blakely.\nMR. FISHER: If the judge needs to make an\nextra finding beyond the elements of either of those two\ncrimes to run them consecutively, then it would violate\nBlakely.\nTHE COURT: But we've never held that?\nWe've never held that consecutive -- that the treatment\nof sentences as concurrent or consecutive is covered by\nBlakely?\nMR. FISHER: You haven't had a case in the\nApprendi-Blakely line of cases dealing with consecutive\nsentences. But what you've done is laid down a rule\nfrom the very State that we're dealing with here that\nsays that if the judge needs to make an extra finding\nbeyond the elements of the crimes of conviction and\nbeyond the facts encompassed in the jury's finding of\nguilt for those crimes, then those findings need to be\nproved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. That's why\nin this case that line, that rule, is triggered.\nThe Ninth Circuit of course didn't talk\nabout any of this. What it said, as I mentioned, is\nthat it simply took Apprendi to be a purely formalistic\nrule that had nothing to do with the facts according to\nthe jury verdict, but it just had to do with whatever\nthe State happened to label as the statutory maximum.\nIn Apprendi this Court said, not once but three times,\nthat the statutory maximum concept was triggered\naccording to the facts encompassed in the jury verdict.\nAnd like the Washington courts, the Ninth Circuit simply\nignored that language in this Court's opinion.\nLest there be any doubt about the way that\nconcept mapped onto this case, this Court said in Apprendi\nitself that the relevant inquiry was not one of form but\none of effect: Does the required finding take a\ndefendant to a higher sentence level than would\notherwise be permissible based on the facts encompassed\nin the jury verdict?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Fisher, there's\nanother potential impediment in this case and I would\nlike you to comment on it. That is the petition from\nthe sentence, it was second in time. There was a prior\npetition that challenged just the conviction, and under\nthe governing statute, to have a second petition, you've\ngot to get permission from the court of appeals and it\nhas to meet stringent criteria.\nHow do you get past that? You went out\nconcentrating on the petition addressed to the sentence\nwhich is a second petition.\nMR. FISHER: This is the very first petition\nthat Mr. Burton has filed against the 1998 judgment. He\ndid file earlier a petition against the original\njudgment of 1994. In the joint appendix at page 34,\nthat is where that petition is reprinted. He says quite\nclearly that he is challenging the 1994 judgment in that\npetition, whereas here this is his first petition\nagainst the 1998 judgment.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So did -- then you are\nbifurcating the judgment in a criminal case, which is\nnot the sentence. You are saying there's an earlier\njudgment, and looking at it as we would as if it were a\ncivil case, if you have a determination of liability,\nthat doesn't give you a final judgment. The judgment\nwill come at the end of the case when damages are\ndetermined.\nMR. FISHER: That's right, Justice Ginsburg.\nAnd if what the State is saying is correct, which is to\nsay that we don't have any judgment at all until the\nsentence is final, then all you get from that is that\nMr. Burton's first petition should have been dismissed\nand the court could have gotten it dismissed. But we\nsubmit what you can't do from that is retroactively\nchange the first petition that he explicitly told the\ncourt was against the 1994 judgment, and that he told\nthe court in that same filing on JA 35 and JA 40, that\nhis sentence was still on direct review. You can't\nretroactively change that challenge to the 1994 judgment\ninto one against the 1998 judgment, for two reasons.\nOne is that if the State is right, the\ndistrict court wouldn't have had jurisdiction under that\n1998 -- challenge against the 1998 judgment either,\nbecause as Mr. Burton forthrightly told the court, that\nsentence was still on direct review. But even if you\nget past that, we submit that this Court's Castro\ndecision simply doesn't allow a court, especially\nretroactively, to recharacterize a habeas petition that\nthe petitioner himself said was against one judgment as\nagainst another.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So you think there can\nalways be two petitions, one -- of sentences on review?\nMR. FISHER: No, there can't, Justice\nKennedy. And so what should have happened according to\nthe state's theory, is that the first petition should,\nshould simply have been dismissed.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Bit is that also your\ntheory?\nMR. FISHER: I think that's -- this Court\nhasn't laid down a solid decision. But I think that's a\nbetter reading.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But are you -- are you\nasking us to say that while the sentence is still under\nreview, there can be no habeas petition filing?\nMR. FISHER: Am I asking --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why isn't that up to the\noption of the petitioner? He can take his chances or he\ncan wait.\nMR. FISHER: I think that is a fair\ncharacterization, Justice Kennedy. But what Mr. Burton\ndid is he want to the district court saying I'm\nchallenging the 1994 judgment. And as I was saying,\nunder Castro before that gets recharacterized --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm asking if it is your\nposition whether or not he properly can do that?\nMR. FISHER: I don't think so. But I'm just\nrecognizing that that's a jurisdictional question that\nthis Court would decide for itself. But assuming that\nhe can't do that, what the district court would have had\nto say is, Mr. Burton, you're not allowed to challenge\nthe 1994 judgment. And let's assume for the moment he\ncould have challenged the 1998 judgment. The district\njudge would have said, \"Now Mr. Burton, you're only\nchallenging your conviction for the 1994 judgment. You\nneed to wait until you're ready to challenge your\nsentence, and then you can challenge the 1998 judgment.\"\nPresumably -- and this is I think a fair inference\nespecially from the petition itself as it is reprinted,\nsince he told the district court that he was challenging\nhis sentence, if he was told he couldn't bring it at\nthat time he would have said okay, I will withdraw it\nand wait until I can challenge my sentence.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if the first proceeding\nwas not in fact jurisdictionally barred, then you would\nlose under the second and successive objection in this\ncase, right?\nMR. FISHER: I don't know that we would,\nJustice Souter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why not?\nMR. FISHER: Because it is a common rule\nthat -- this Court hasn't had a case exactly like this,\nbut the lower courts do all the time; and the Fourth\nCircuit case in Taylor which I've cited in the reply\nbrief is one of them. Where, it is a common practice\nfor a petitioner to bring one petition against a\njudgment and then be partially successful, and then\nbring a new petition against something in the new\njudgment. And that's essentially what happened here.\nAnd it may --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Aren't those cases in which\nthe first judgment is complete, he simply does not\nattack everything that was a predicate for the first\njudgment; and then if there is, in fact, a new trial,\nand a new judgment, of course, the habeas possibility\narises again, whereas in this case, the first judgment\nwas not complete.\nMR. FISHER: No, you put your finger on it\nexactly. And so, but we still think that, that, either\nthe court had jurisdiction or it didn't. And if it had\njurisdiction, then it must be -- fall in somehow into\nthe category that you're talking about.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But that's not necessarily\ntrue. Isn't it also possible if, at the time of the\nfirst judgment the judge could have said, well you really\nhaven't exhausted your remedies because it is not final\nuntil the whole thing is over. But nevertheless,\nbecause exhaustion is not a jurisdictional matter, I'm\ngoing to go ahead and decide it.\nMR. FISHER: Could a district judge have\ndone that?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. FISHER: I think what would have needed\nto have happened here, since Mr. Burton at pages 35 and\n40 of the joint appendix, told the district judge, I'm\nstill challenging my sentence on direct appeal, under\nAEDPA and customary comity principles, the judge would\nhave needed to say, you need either to renounce that\nappeal from the State court or renounce this one. You\ncouldn't do both at the same time.\nMr. Burton, if he had wanted to, I think it\nis fair to say, could have gone into district court and\nsaid, I now have a new judgment and I'm going to\nchallenge my conviction and sentence because I have no\nintention of challenging my sentence through State court\nproceedings. And perhaps he could have done that. But\nthat would be a very different situation than what we\nhave here.\nIf I can turn back to the, not a new rule\nquestion, another angle at this is not simply to look at\nthe text of this Court's opinion in Apprendi which we\nsubmit told a State court in this situation all it would\nhave needed to know, but also perhaps it is helpful to\nlook behind that and look at the statutes that were in\nplay in New Jersey and in Washington. And even if you\ndid that it becomes, we submit, very clear that a\ndistrict judge, any reasonable trial judge, that is,\nwould have known that Apprendi applied here.\nWhat you had in New Jersey was essentially\ntwo statutes. One that said an ordinary commission of a\ncrime is punishable up to 10 years. And a second\nstatute that said if you commit that crime with some\nkind of extra -- extra bad circumstance, there a hate\ncrime, then you get -- you can get a higher sentence.\nExactly the same thing was true in\nWashington. We had one statute that said this is what\nthe, this is what the punishment is for the ordinary\ncommission of this crime. And we had an extra statute\nthat said, but if you commit that crime with extra bad\ncircumstances -- and here the only difference was, there\nwas a list of circumstances, not just a single one --\nbut if you commit the crime with extra circumstances,\nthen you can get extra punishment.\nAnd the analogy that the respondents want to\ndraw between the Washington sentencing system and the\nFederal guidelines just simply doesn't hold up.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think Blakely\nwas not a new rule but Booker was?\nMR. FISHER: I think that's fair to say,\nMr. Chief Justice. Because in Blakely all you needed to\ndo was apply Apprendi which said that if you have two\ndifferent statutory thresholds, the pertinent threshold\nfor Sixth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment purposes is\nthe one that cabins the judge's discretion based on the\nfacts in the jury verdict. To decide Booker this Court\nhad to take the term statutory maximum and apply that to\na different type of threshold, which was as this Court\nput it a court rule or a quasi legislative enactment.\nSo under -- under the system that this Court\nreviewed in Booker, you had only a single true statutory\nmaximum. And then you had to decide whether the\nApprendi principle ought to be in play for the Federal\nsentencing guidelines. And if there is any confusion on\nthat, a trial judge could have looked at Apprendi itself\nwhere this Court and Justice Thomas's concurrence made\nclear that there was unique status of the Federal\nsentencing guidelines that made it a more difficult\nquestion.\nHowever, here where you didn't have anything\nlike that, we had just a simple situation where there\nwere two statutes, one maximum for the ordinary crime,\nand then an additional maximum for the crime being\ncommitted with aggravating circumstances. And so it was\na very clear map line. And that's what this Court said\nin Blakely, of course. It said, it didn't break any new\nground in the decision in Blakely. It simply said that,\ntook the state's argument and rejected it by saying our\nprecedents on this point are clear. And it just simply\nquoted the Apprendi language, that the statutory maximum\nfor Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment purposes is the\nmaximum that a defendant may receive based on the facts\nand the jury verdict alone.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There were decisions\ngoing the other way.\nMR. FISHER: There were lower court\ndecisions?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. FISHER: Yes, there were. And I think,\nif we want to talk about these, it is important first to\nbe clear about what we are talking about. There were,\nthere was a Supreme Court of Kansas that had looked to\nthe relevant language in Apprendi and decided that its\nsentencing guidelines system could not stand. And then\nyou had, on the other side the Supreme Court of\nWashington, and the Supreme Court of Oregon, and a\ncouple of other State intermediate courts, I think some\nin unpublished decisions, that had gone the other way.\nBut I think it is very telling, Justice\nGinsburg, if you want to look at those State supreme --\nI'm sorry, those State supreme court and lower court\ndecisions, because none of them -- not a single one --\nquotes Apprendi or even acknowledges the passages in\nApprendi that said the test is not one of form but of\neffect. And there's several passages in Apprendi that\nsaid that the statutory maximum was the maximum allowed\nbased on the facts in the jury verdict. So once you\ntake those into account, we submit, as the Kansas\nSupreme Court realized, there is only one conclusion\nthat you can reach. The only way those lower courts\nwere able to come to a contrary decision was simply to\npluck out -- pluck out other sentences of Apprendi and\nnot acknowledge the rest of the opinion. And of course,\nthe rest of the opinion where this Court has these\npassages, pages 483, 482, are the absolute guts, the\nbuilding blocks of the opinion itself. It is where the\nCourt canvasses the historical rule that was\nincorporated into our constitutional system. And so it\nis not as though that is some sort of dicta that or\nloose language that this Court had in its opinion. It\nwas the very guts of the holding of Apprendi.\nAnd we submit that, in a Teague analysis\nwhere you are indeed supposed to look to whether a\nreasonable jurist would have found something, not just\nthe fact that they exist, but whether a reasonable\njurist would have reached a given conclusion, once you\ntake the whole of Apprendi into account, there was only\none conclusion that a reasonable jurist could have come\nto.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose that doesn't\nmake the dissenters in Blakely feel very good.\nMR. FISHER: Well, Justice Kennedy, I think,\nas I understand the dissents in, in Blakely, the\ndissents in Blakely primarily were saying that Apprendi\nitself was a bad idea. And that Apprendi really wasn't\ndictated by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. I see\nalmost nothing, in fact really nothing in the dissents\nof Blakely itself that says taking Apprendi as the law,\nwe can distinguish it from the facts in this case.\nThere was nothing of that in the dissents.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course you have to show\nthat the result was dictated by the prior precedent.\nThat's a strong phrase. We said it in Stringer --\nStringer versus Black. But if it has a new application,\nthat's -- that's new. Even though the principle is the\nsame.\nMR. FISHER: I think the Stringer test is\nhelpful because there, of course, this Court said that\none of its prior decisions was not a new rule, because\neven though there was a different State sentencing\nsystem that slightly different before the Court in the\nsubsequent case, the principle from the prior case\ndictated only one result. And I think once you go back\nto the dissents in Blakely and compare them let's say,\nwith the dissents in Booker, on the merits that is, in\nBooker, I think again it is telling, because the\ndissenters in Blakely had nothing to say in terms of a\npossible way to distinguish one case from the other;\nwhereas in Booker, the dissents did point out we don't\nhave to extend it this far. We can limit to it to true\nstatutes and not go this far. So there is a difference.\nReally what this case, I think one way to\nphrase it in terms of what it comes down to, is whether\nwhen this Court lays a decision down like Apprendi, that\nhas a clear rule and lots of historical, robust\nreasoning behind it, saying why we are adopting a\ncertain rule, whether it is up to the lower courts, in\nthis case the State courts, to second-guess this Court\nand say I don't know if the Court really means what it\nsays, as Justice Breyer later put it in the Blakely\ndissent.\nWe think that, we submit what this Court\nshould say is that when we say something is the law,\nthat lower courts ought to assume that's the law, at\nleast until we tell them somehow that the law is\ndifferent.\nIf there are no more questions on the new\nrule, I will quickly address the watershed argument.\nBecause if for some reason this Court adopted the\nstate's view that really all Apprendi was was a highly\nformalistic rule about what is a statutory maximum, and\nthat -- and that just simply labeling, courts could have\nevaded it, we think that Blakely itself then has to be\nconsidered a watershed exception -- a watershed rule.\nAnd the reason why is because, is because of an error\nthat runs throughout the state's brief.\nAnd the state's position is basically that\nthis can't be watershed because Apprendi and Blakely\ndeal with circumstances where a defendant has already\nbeen convicted of a crime and all we're considering is\nwhat sentence ought to be imposed. But, of course, that\n-- that contravenes the very holding of Apprendi and\nBlakely which is to remedy the fact that the defendant\nis being sentenced for a greater crime than the jury\nactually found him guilty of. And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This argument, this\nargument assumes that we rule against you on whether or\nnot it is a new rule.\nMR. FISHER: I think that's right, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Don't you have --\ndon't you have to address AEDPA before we get to that\nquestion?\nMR. FISHER: In the watershed realm?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, it\ndoesn't matter it it's a watershed, I guess it is a\npoint of argument, but it is not clear that it matters\nwhether it is a watershed rule if you read AEDPA\n2254(d)(1) by its terms.\nMR. FISHER: If this Court concluded in the\nWhorton case that watershed did not survive AEDPA, then\nof course you're right, watershed doesn't -- can't get\nus home here. But as this case comes to the Court, as I\nunderstand it, this Court is considering this case in a\nposture that it really dealt with in Horn versus Banks\nwhere it said that even post AEDPA, what a court is\nsupposed to do is conduct what this Court termed a\nthreshold Teague inquiry as to whether Teague is\nsatisfied. And of course in Horn, this Court mentioned\nthe watershed exception itself.\nSo we think that what this Court should\nreally do is address that threshold question to the\nextent it needs to holistically.\nIf there are no more questions, I'll reserve\nthe remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Fisher.\nMr. Collins.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM B. COLLINS\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMR. COLLINS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI would like to begin where Justice Ginsburg\nbegan, with the issue of successive petitions. We\nbelieve that the petition before this Court is a\nsuccessive petition barred under AEDPA. Now my brother,\nMr. Fisher says that it's not a successive petition\nbecause the first petition challenged the 1994 judgment.\nBut that is simply not correct as a matter of the facts\nof this case.\nA new judgment was entered in March of 1998.\nThat judgment was entered as a result of Mr. Burton's\nconviction being affirmed and his sentence being\nreversed. So when he was in custody, when he filed his\nfirst petition, he was in custody pursuant to that\namended judgment.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So that is the only\njudgment that could be attacked on habeas?\nMR. COLLINS: Exactly, Your Honor. So he\nhas an amended judgment filed in March of 1998. He\nfiles his first petition challenging his conviction\nunder that petition. Later, in 2002, he files a second\npetition challenging his sentence.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't matter --\nI'm looking at joint appendix page 34, date of judgment\nof conviction, he puts in December 16, 1994.\nMR. COLLINS: He does put that in, Your\nHonor, but I don't think that's determinative. If you\ntake a look at page 35, on question 8, they say, did you\nappeal from the judgment of conviction? Answer, yes.\nIf you did appeal, answer the following. And it lays\nout the facts that he appealed, that his conviction was\naffirmed, that his sentence was reversed, and then a new\njudgment is entered in March of 1998.\nHe is not in custody pursuant to the 1994\njudgment. He is in custody --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where does it say a\nnew judgment was issued in March of '98?\nMR. COLLINS: Your Honor, that's in the\njoint appendix at page 3, which shows that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, I thought you\nmeant it was in his petition.\nMR. COLLINS: No, no, it wasn't in his\npetition, Your Honor, but it doesn't seem -- the fact\nthat he was looking back at his conviction, original\nconviction being 1994, and that's what he wrote down,\ndoesn't mean that that was the conviction and that was\nthe judgment under which he was in custody, because it\nsimply wasn't. The original 1994 judgment no longer\nexisted because a new judgment had been entered. So\nbecause -- and I don't think -- I think what we disagree\nabout in this is which judgment, if the first petition\nwent to the first -- to the 1994 judgment, and the\nsecond petition went to the 1998 judgment, then we would\nagree with Mr. Fisher that it is not successive.\nOn the other hand, I believe I heard him say\nthat if you agree with us, that the only judgment in\nexistence at the time he filed his petition was the 1998\njudgment. Then he's filed a successive petition with\nregard to that judgment, one in December of 1998 dealing\nwith the conviction; a second in 2002, dealing with the\nsentence.\nSo since it's a successive petition and\nMr. Burton did not go through the gatekeeping function\nthat AEDPA requires, there is no -- the district court\nhad no jurisdiction and subsequently, we believe that\nthis Court does not have jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The fact is, we're looking\nat page 34, 34 of the joint appendix, and that is the\nfirst petition that was filed; is that right?\nMR. COLLINS: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So you look at it and it\nsays, filed December 28, and maybe this is what you\nsaid. Then it says date of judgment of conviction,\nDecember 16, 1994. So looking at that, you'd think that\nis what he was attacking. Where does it say he's\nattacking anything else?\nMR. COLLINS: Well, Your Honor, it doesn't\nsay he's attacking anything else, but the problem with\nthat is that when he filed this petition, he was not\nbeing confined --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but I imagine there\nare tens of thousands off petitions filed in the Federal\nsystem. And I would think that judges when they're\ntrying to look at those petitions, or the magistrate\nlooks at them and says what judgment are you attacking,\nhe has to figure that out often for statute of\nlimitations purposes, or some other purpose. He'd look\nover there, go down and read that line two, and he'd\nthink yeah, that's the judgment that's being attacked,\nunless of course there's some indication that it's\nsomething else.\nI've never heard of this before. Is there\nany precedent on that where even though the petition\nrefers to date A, and there's nothing in to suggest\nanything other than date A, because it turns out that\nthere's a different judgment that in fact, he's being\nheld, which is date B, that the court says oh, you're\nattacking date B.\nIs there any precedent that says that's how\nit's read?\nMR. COLLINS: I'm not aware of any\nprecedent.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. So this might be the\nfirst time. I don't see a reason why you wouldn't read\nthe petition that's filed in an ordinary way and say the\njudgment that's being attacked is the judgment that it\nrefers to.\nMR. COLLINS: Well, Your Honor, I think you\nhave to say the judgment that's being attacked is the\njudgment by which he's being confined. I mean, he --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't know what\nimplication this is going to have for a lot of these\npetitions. I don't know one way or the other, but it\nmight be there are thousands right now in the Federal\ncourt which have date A, and somebody is going to go\nback and say no, it is really date B or something. I'm\na little nervous about it. If you're not nervous,\nyou're the ones in charge.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, Mr. Collins, isn't it\nyour position that, number one, the only judgment that he\ncan attack on habeas is the judgment that is extant at the\ntime of the habeas proceeding, and that is the '92\njudgment that follows the resentencing? But he may in\nattacking that judgment attack the premise of conviction\nwhich occurred earlier?\nMR. COLLINS: Exactly, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And if he chooses to attack\nonly the earlier conviction which is the premise of the\nlater judgment, he has simply in effect waived any other\nissue. And when he comes in later and tries to raise\nthe issue that he could have attacked under the '92\njudgment, he's in effect trying to split up his habeas,\nit's second and successive, and that's why he can't do\nit.\nMR. COLLINS: That's exactly right, Your\nHonor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And further, I\nthought you told me that the petition goes on to\nindicate that the conviction while affirmed, that the\nsentence was reversed, looking at 9(b) on joint appendix\n35.\nMR. COLLINS: Yes, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which in other\nwords, he details in the petition the subsequent history\nthat would have resulted in a new judgment.\nMR. COLLINS: That's right, Your Honor.\nNext I would like to go briefly to the\nquestion that Justice Souter asked about --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I just be sure I\nunderstand one thing about that? So you're saying at\nthe time he filed the petition on December 28, 1998, he\nhad already had, the second judgment had already been\nentered by the Washington Supreme Court?\nMR. COLLINS: It had been entered by the\ntrial court, Your Honor, so he --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Pursuant to the reversal\nof the --\nMR. COLLINS: Exactly, Your Honor. That\nsentence is on page -- if you look at page 3 of the\njoint appendix, that is the second amended judgment\nfiled in the superior court in Washington on March 16,\n1998, and he was confined under the authority of this\njudgment.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Of the second judgment?\nMR. COLLINS: Of the second judgment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why does it make any less\nsense to allow separate habeas challenges to, first, the\nconviction, and then the sentence, than it does to allow\nseparate appeals to this Court from each of those? And\nonce again under the statute, we entertain appeals only\nfrom final judgment, but you can bring here on\ncertiorari the judgment of conviction, even though\nproceedings for the sentence are still in progress.\nMR. COLLINS: Well, Your Honor, I think\nwe're talking about the habeas corpus statute and there\nthe Court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A fortiori, we have a lot\nmore control over habeas corpus, which is an equitable\nremedy, than we do over, what is it, 1257, our\njurisdictional statute under certiorari.\nWhy does it make any more sense for habeas\npurposes to insist that he await the final sentence\nbefore he gets review of the premise for that sentence,\nnamely the conviction?\nMR. COLLINS: Your Honor, I'm sorry.\nI think that a couple things are being\nconfused here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right.\nMR. COLLINS: The first thing is when -- is\nthis a successive -- is this a successive petition, and\nwe would say it is, because he filed the first one and\nthen the second one.\nNow the question of whether he can get\nrelief under the first -- under his first habeas\npetition does not depend on the entry of a final\njudgment. In fact, under the facts of this case, the\njudgment was entered in March of 1998. In December of\n1998, he filed his first petition. And in fact, the\nfirst petition was denied in April of 2000 on the\nmerits, because it had been exhausted, he didn't have to\nwait for that, because those claims were exhausted and\nbecause they were ripe, because they -- the factual\npredicates had occurred in the trial court, then that\nwas all that was required for him to bring those claims.\nHe didn't have to wait for a final judgment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you're saying he can't\nlater bring any claim about the sentence?\nMR. COLLINS: That's because Congress in\nAEDPA has declared that you have to bring all of your\nclaims in your -- at one time, and if you don't, then\nyour petition should be dismissed as successive, unless\nyou go through the gatekeeping solution.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So that if the statute\ngoverning our review had an exhaustion requirement and a\nsecond and successive requirement comparable to the\nAEDPA requirement, the case that Justice Scalia put\nwould be exactly like this case?\nMR. COLLINS: I believe so, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. COLLINS: So I just briefly want to go,\nJustice Souter, to where you started about the\nconsecutive sentence issue.\nWe believe that consecutive sentence is\nquite different than, from what exists in Blakely and\nthat, in fact, there aren't really additional findings\nof fact. I think you referred to about the crime, about\nthe circumstances, about the character. In fact, in\nthis case, the finding of fact entered by the trial\ncourt in order to justify the exceptional sentence --\nthis is on page 27 of the joint appendix, finding of\nfact 18 -- if the court were to sentence the defendant\nto a standard range sentence on each count run\nconcurrently, he would receive the same punishment as if\nhe had committed only the rape in the first degree.\nThis would effectively result in the free crimes\nof robbery in the first degree and burglary in the first\ndegree because he would receive no additional penalty\nfor those crimes. Now --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's -- I keep doing\nthis. I'm sorry. Is that sufficient, as you understand\nit, under the Washington case that your brother cited to\nme?\nMR. COLLINS: I believe it is, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the law was\nthat the sentence shall be concurrent unless, and the\nunless is that the judge makes an additional finding,\nthe very same kind of finding that he would make in\ndetermining aggravating factor.\nMR. COLLINS: Your Honor, the sentence could\nhave been run consecutively because of an aggravating\nfactor. In fact, in this case the trial court judge, in\nfact, had three independent and separate reasons for\nrunning the sentence consecutively. Two of those would\nbe, I think we would say aggravating factors that the\nBlakely reasoning would apply to. But the court of\nappeals when it considered this case only looked at the\nfree crimes element to make that decision.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Maybe you can give me just\na little more help on this. The finding number 18 that\nyou referred to says in substance, if by just sentencing\nhim on the basis of the jury verdict he won't get --\nhe'll get a free pass. But it doesn't say the judge\ncan -- could therefore increase the sentence. It seems\nto me there had to be additional findings that justify a\nresult that he thought would have been a miscarriage of\njustice.\nMR. COLLINS: No, Your Honor. I don't think\nthat's right.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You think that just having\npointed out that he would get a pass would have been\nsufficient to justify consecutive sentences?\nMR. COLLINS: I think it would, and the\nState supreme court affirmed this decision.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yeah, but he did make\nadditional findings. It goes on. In fact, 19 and 20\nare additional findings.\nMR. COLLINS: Your Honor, I think -- I mean,\nI agree with you that he did make additional findings.\nBut --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It nowhere says they're\nunnecessary either.\nMR. COLLINS: That's true, Your Honor. But\nif you take a look at the court of appeals opinion which\nis at page 52 and 53 of the joint appendix, when the\ncourt of appeals looks at the sentence, what the court\nof appeals says is, \"nonetheless, the sentencing court\nconcluded that the multiple offender policy alone\njustified the exceptional sentence. The fact that the\ndefendant offender score for rape in the first degree is\n16, thus invoking the multiple offense policy of the\nSentencing Reform Act standing alone, is a substantial\nand compelling reason and justification for imposing the\nexceptional sentence here.\"\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That is to say that that\nwould have been sufficient.\nMR. COLLINS: Exactly.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But in fact that is not\nwhat the trial court premised its decision on, because,\nas Justice Stevens points out, it went on in findings\n19, 20, and 21 about deliberate cruelty, sophistication\nand planning, and so on. Having been through those\nfindings, the court says, from the foregoing facts the\ncourt now makes the following conclusions of law.\nIt seems to me as though the trial court was\nbasing its decision on those foregoing facts as well as\nupon finding 18, which was the free crime finding.\nMR. COLLINS: Well, I think that the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I guess what I'm saying is\nthe fact that he might have -- I'm assuming for the sake\nof argument that the trial court might on the basis\nsimply of the free crime conclusion have sentenced\nconsecutively, is simply not the case that we've got,\nbecause he sentenced consecutively on that basis and on\ncruelty, sophistication, and so on.\nMR. COLLINS: Well, Your Honor, I believe\nthat the court of appeals felt that that consecutive\nsentence on the free crimes was -- standing alone would\nhave been sufficient.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't want to take you\nup. Let me just have one on the merits, one. I mean,\nthe reason I want you to get to the merits, and I put in\nmy dissent. I was trying as hard as I could to show why\nI thought this case was wrong. I start the dissent by\nsaying that -- what it says, and then I quote the two\nsentences that any fact, et cetera, any fact that\nincreases beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must\nbe submitted to a jury and prescribed statutory maximum,\nagain quote, means \"solely on the basis of the facts\nreflected in the jury verdict.\" Okay.\nThen at the end of the opinion I say:\n\"Until now I would have thought the Court might have\nlimited Apprendi so its underlying principle wouldn't\ncause so much harm.\" Now, the next sentence of course I\nexplain how they might have limited Apprendi, but\nsomehow that disappeared from the opinion because I\nguess I couldn't think of it.\nSo you're going to tell me now -- I mean, I\ndidn't say how they might have limited Apprendi and I\ncouldn't think of how they might have limited Apprendi,\nand they read Apprendi to mean what it said. Now, you\ntell me the phrase I might have put in but couldn't\nthink of that would have limited Apprendi?\nMR. COLLINS: Well, Your Honor, I think that\nyou could have said that the definition of \"statutory\nmaximum\" is the traditional statutory maximum that was\nat issue in Apprendi. And in fact in the Apprendi\ndecision the Court specifically, I think in response to\nJustice O'Connor's dissent, explained that Walton versus\nArizona was still good law. And as you know, in Walton\nthe jury would find somebody guilty of aggravated first\ndegree murder, but they could not receive the death\npenalty unless the judge made additional findings in a\nhearing.\nAnd it seemed to say that the statutory\nmaximum was death and that in fact the judge's findings\nwould not take you above that statutory maximum. I\nthink that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Wasn't that overturned in\nRing?\nMR. COLLINS: It was overturned in Ring,\nYour Honor. But when you had lower court appellate\njudges looking at your decision in Apprendi and seeing\nthe fact that Walton and Apprendi were consistent, it\nwas logical for them to conclude, as virtually every\nsingle court did except for Kansas, that the definition\nof \"statutory maximum\" was the traditional statutory\nmaximum that was in Apprendi.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Was it logical for them to\nconclude it or were they -- were they expressing the\nhope that the Court would draw a distinction which it\nhad not drawn in the formulation that it gave in\nApprendi? It's one thing to say that if you draw no\nfurther distinctions, Apprendi requires a certain\nresult. It's another thing to say but maybe they will\ndraw a distinction and we're going to predict that they\nwill, and hence not apply Apprendi.\nWeren't the other appellate courts to which\nyou refer engaged in the latter exercise, which I call\nthe exercise of hope?\nMR. COLLINS: I'm not sure that I would\nagree with that, Justice Souter, only because as I think\nJustice O'Connor explained in her dissent, there are two\nways to read Apprendi, and one of those ways would\nresult in upholding guideline systems which are now\ninvalid because of Blakely and Booker, but really quite\ndifferent from Apprendi because those systems involve\nwhat you would call guided discretion. That is, in\nApprendi if you wanted the aggravating factor if the\njudge found it by a preponderance then the sentence was\nenhanced.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but doesn't that\nrequire drawing a distinction that Apprendi did not\nspeak to? And isn't it still the case that, I think\nMr. Fisher points out that three times we repeated in\nApprendi the formula about fact, beyond fact found by a\njury on the basis of which, et cetera, the range\nincreases.\nIsn't the distinction which -- and I trust\nyour recollection here -- that Justice O'Connor had in\nmind and that they had in mind a distinction which\nsimply was not addressed in Apprendi and would have been\nsomething new as opposed to merely an application of\nwhat was implicit in Apprendi?\nMR. COLLINS: I believe it definitely would\nhave been something new, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Collins.\nMr. Roberts?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMR. ROBERTS: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nIf I could begin by addressing the issues\nthat you were just talking about, there was a\ndistinction that the Court could have drawn between\nApprendi and Blakely and that reasonable jurists could\nhave drawn and did draw. One was the formal distinction\nthat you were discussing before with the State, which\nwas supported by Justice O'Connor's proposing that as an\ninterpretation in her dissent and the majority not\nresponding to that, that that distinction was contrary\nto the rule but implausible, but in fact accepting\nthe -- accepting that it was a plausible distinction and\nsaying that it still wouldn't have made a difference,\nthat the Apprendi rule still was important.\nThe second -- and in addition to that, that\ndistinction that Justice O'Connor drew there was\nconsistent with the Apprendi Court's distinction of\nWalton. And you have to look at what reasonable jurists\ncould have interpreted looking at that decision at the\ntime with those distinctions and what the Court said in\nApprendi.\nBut in addition to that, there was more than\na formal distinction that could have been drawn between\nthe system in Apprendi and the Washington guidelines\nsystem. That's the distinction that we proposed in our\namicus brief in Blakely and it rested on the fact that\nsentencing guideline systems like Washington try to\nchannel but not to eliminate the discretion that\nsentencing judges have to sentence within the otherwise\napplicable limits. And in the Washington system the\nsentencing judge retained a significant degree of\ndiscretion that reasonable jurists could have analogized\nto traditional sentencing systems that aren't\nconstrained by Apprendi.\nThe facts, the facts on which the judge\ncould rely to go above the guidelines, were not\nspecified as in Apprendi and as in Ring by the\nlegislature, but it was a wide open set that enabled the\njudge himself or herself to determine what facts the\njudge thought could justify a higher sentence; and in\naddition, the facts alone didn't trigger the higher\nsentence. The judge had to look at those facts and make\nthe additional determination that those facts rose to\nthe level of substantial and compelling reasons that\njustified the higher sentence.\nIn that respect, the judge had a degree of\nsentencing discretion to decide what facts justified it\nand whether it was in fact justified.\nNow, of course, this Court rejected those\ndistinctions in Blakely. But the question is whether a\nreasonable jurist could have accepted those distinctions\nand drawn a difference, and we submit that they could\nhave.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Roberts, do you\nhave a position on whether we have a successive petition\nproblem here?\nMR. ROBERTS: We don't have a position on\nthat precise, on that particular issue here, because it\ncan't arise for Federal prisoners. But let me explain\nwhy it can't arise for Federal prisoners because perhaps\nthat will give the Court some guidance in resolving the\nissue. In the Federal system, it's well established\nthat the conviction and the sentence are part of a\nunitary judgment and that that unitary judgment doesn't\nbecome final until the conviction and the sentence have\nboth been fully adjudicated.\nThat understanding is reflected in the\nlanguage of 28 U.S.C. 2255, which is the statute that\nauthorizes collateral attacks by Federal prisoners.\nThat statute authorizes attacks -- what it authorizes is\nmotions to vacate, set aside, or correct a sentence. So\nit's clear from that that it's not authorizing\ncollateral attacks on a conviction independent of the\nattendant sentence. And I think that could shed some\nguidance here, because 2255 was intended to be a\nparallel and substitute remedy to traditional habeas for\nFederal prisoners.\nI would also make a point on the other sort\nof preliminary issues that were being discussed on the\nconsecutive sentence issue, that it's not only the fact\nthat the judge said that the multiple offense policy\nstanding alone could justify the consecutive sentence\nhere and that the court of appeals relied on that in\nupholding that.\nBut the court of appeals went further,\nbecause petitioner had made a separate challenge to --\nand this is on page 52 and 53 of the joint appendix.\nPetitioner made a separate challenge to the other two\naggravating factors. Petitioner argued that the\ndistrict court wasn't allowed to rely on -- excuse me,\nthe trial court couldn't rely on those two other\naggravating factors because he had not relied on them in\nthe original sentencing and this was a resentencing.\nThe court of appeals rejected that challenge\nand it rejected that challenge because it said the\nsentencing court concluded that the multiple offense\npolicy alone justified the exceptional sentence, and\nthen on page 53 it said: \"The sentencing court did not\nrely on the additional aggravating factors for imposing\nan exceptional sentence.\" So I think these --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is that true in fact?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, that is how --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm mean, I'm sure you're\nreading correctly, but is that in fact true? Because,\nhaving talked, as I just read out a moment ago, having\nspoken about free crimes, aggravating factors, it says,\non the basis of the foregoing facts I now draw the\nfollowing conclusions of law.\nMR. ROBERTS: The trial court said each of\nthe three standing alone was sufficient. But what the\ncourt of appeals said is these other two have been\nchallenged, but these other two are -- we're not going\nto deal with this challenge to these other two\nfactors because they're out of the case. So I think\nthat this Court has to take the case as coming from --\ncoming from the Washington courts as if what the courts\nessentially said is those other two are not in the case\nany more.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So we can treat it in\neffect -- and this may be the way to do it -- we can\ntreat it as the ultimate sentencer was the Washington\nappellate court and that's what they said?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, what the Washington\nappellate court essentially, they could have said\npetitioner is right, those other two aggravating factors\ncouldn't be relied on, and so we're relying on this the\nstanding alone. What they chose to do is, we're going\nto interpret what the trial court did as relying only on\nthe one. And that was the basis for responding to that\nclaim of error, and I do think that the Court has to\ntake this case as coming on that basis.\nIf I could turn to the issue of Blakely\nretroactivity for a few minutes. In addition to the\npoints that I made before about why Blakely was a new\nrule, I would also submit that Blakely is not a\nwatershed rule because it's not a bedrock rule that's\nessential to a fair trial, and rules are only bedrock if\nthey approach the fundamental and sweeping importance of\nGideon, and Blakely doesn't have that kind of importance\nfor three reasons. First, the right to counsel\npervasively affects every aspect of the trial, but\nBlakely affects only the procedure for determining the\npunishment of defendants who have already been found\nguilt beyond a reasonable doubt of all the elements of a\ncrime.\nSecond, a felony trial in which the\ndefendant is denied counsel is inherently unfair, but\nit's not inherently unfair to use the preponderance\nstandard to find facts that determine the extent of\npunishment, and in fact the Constitution permits the use\nof a preponderance standard to find many facts that have\nas much or more impact on punishment as facts covered by\nBlakely. Those include facts that trigger mandatory\nminimums, facts on which a judge relies to sentence\nwithin a broad statutory range, and even facts on which\na judge relies to sentence above the standard range in\nadvisory guideline systems.\nThird, counsel is so essential to a fair\ntrial that deprivation of the right can never be\ndiscounted as harmless error. But this Court held in\nRecuenco that Blakely errors can be harmless, and in\nreaching that holding the Court expressly concluded that\nBlakely errors do not necessarily render a criminal\ntrial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for\ndetermining guilt or innocence.\nThat conclusion seems to strongly suggest\nthat Blakely is not a bedrock rule essential to a fair\ntrial.\nIf the Court has no further questions --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Fisher, you have four minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. FISHER: Let me say one word on\njurisdiction and then turn to two comments on the\nmerits. On jurisdiction, I think Mr. Roberts is right\nthat this rarely happens in the Federal system. It\nrarely happens in the State system. We can't find any\nother case where a petitioner has gone in naming, as the\nState would say, in effect the wrong judgment and\nsaying: \"I'm challenging this judgment.\"\nBut what happened here was just that.\nMr. Burton went in and said he was challenging the 1994\njudgment. And under this Court's Castro decision, when\na pro se petitioner comes in and says I'm doing one\nthing, in that case making a motion for a new trial, it\ncan't be converted into something else which is a first\nhabeas petition without advising the petitioner. And\nhere, not only was he not advised by the trial court but\nthe State in its own answer, which we attached to our\nreply brief, agreed that he could challenge the 1994\nconviction, and said that conviction is final, and he\ncan challenge that judgment, the 1994 judgment.\nSo it's way too late in the day for the\nState to stand up to you now and say this pro se\npetitioner should bear the burden of bringing an\nimproper petition.\nOn the merits, I don't want to elaborate\nbeyond simply just telling this Court that if you look\nat the Hughes decision and you look at the Washington\ndecision from the Washington state courts, it is clear\nthat an extra finding was necessary here, even if the\nonly aggravator in play is the free crimes are clearly\ntoo lenient factor. Hughes makes it crystal clear that\na judge needs to find, and I'm quoting, \"extraordinarily\nserious harm or culpability arising from the multiple\noffenses.\" And to the extent that the State stands\nbefore you now and quotes from parts of Mr. Burton's\ncase where the trial judge did not explicitly make that\nfinding, that only reinforces the strength of his habeas\npetition now, that under Washington state law, the judge\nneeded to make that kind of an extra finding and the\njudge didn't do so.\nLet me finally turn to a discussion about\nwhether this Court's treatment of Walton and Apprendi\ncould have given a State judge a reasonable basis to\ndistinguish the system at issue in Blakely. We don't\nthink it could because this Court didn't simply say in\nApprendi that Walton stands. It explicitly said the\nreason why the Arizona capital system as we understand\nit is okay is because it's nothing more than a system\nthat is permissible under Williams against New York.\nIt's one where on the basis of the jury's\nfinding of guilt that the death penalty is permissible\nwithout anything else. And so the only disagreement\nbetween the majority and Justice O'Connor's dissent was\nas to the way Arizona's system worked, but any judge that\nwould have looked at Apprendi would have seen, the\nmajority is telling us that a system is okay so long as\nthe jury verdict itself allows the ultimate sentence.\nThat is exactly the kind of system that was\nnot in place in Washington, so a judge should have full\nwell realized.\nAnd of course as Justice Ginsburg pointed\nout, once it became clear to this Court the way that\nArizona's capital sentencing system functioned, this\nCourt had little difficulty simply applying the Apprendi rule\nand agreeing that that system had to be invalid too.\nAnd just like the Blakely decision itself, not even the\ndissenters suggested that Apprendi dictated otherwise.\nIf this Court has no further questions, I'll\nsubmit the case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n"
