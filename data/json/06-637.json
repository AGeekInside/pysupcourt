        "content": "(10:55 a.m.)\nWe'll hear argument next in Case 06-637,\nBoard of Education of the City School District of the\nCity of New York versus Tom F.\nMr. Koerner.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD KOERNER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. KOERNER: Mr. Chief Justice, and members\nof the Court. In 1985 when this Court decided the\nBurlington decision, it based -- it based it based on\nthe broad remedial clause set forth in 20 U.S.C. 1415,\nwhich allowed an impartial hearing officer, a state\nreview officer, or the court, itself, to grant relief\nwhere appropriate.\nIn so doing, it noted that there was no\nother substantive section which touched and concerned\nthe issue before the Court, and that is whether an\nindividual can voluntarily remove a child and seek\ntuition reimbursement before the conclusion of the\nadministrative and court remedies.\nIt made a point of noting that it felt it\nwas gleaning the congressional intent; and, had Congress\nknown that the administrative and court process would be\nprotracted, it would have provided a process which would\nallow the child to be removed.\nSimilarly, in the sequel, the Carter case,\nthe Court made the other -- the same conclusion. It\nnoted that, although the primary responsibilities to\neducate the child in a public school, least restrictive\nenvironment, there would be occasions when you would\nplace that child outside, having been in the school\nsystem.\n1412, which was the eligibility section\nduring this period, was very truncated. It did not\nprovide a lot of conversation concerning the\nrelationship of public and private schools within the\nIDEA. It provided that you had to provide the child who\ndemanded it a FAPE, a free appropriate education. If\nyou couldn't do that, the public school had to then pay\nfor the tuition. It was silent though on the\nrelationship between the private schools where the child\nvoluntary removes.\nIn 1997 the IDEA was codified, and for the\nfirst time the specific section was inserted dealing\nwith the relationship of children and private schools.\nIndeed, 20 U.S.C. 1412(a)(10) -- just the beginning,\njust that paragraph, says \"children placed in private\nschools\" and the structure was detailed. Subdivision\n(A) dealt with the relationshiop of the private schools\nwith the public system generally and noted that, in that\nparticular case, while the children would be entitled to\nsome small amount of Federal funding, they would not be\nentitled in private school to a free appropriate public\neducation.\nWe also noted that if a parent was\ndissatisfied with the service plan, they'd have to seek\nrelief administratively. They would not be entitled to\nan impartial due process or a court review. It was a\nrecognition that children who are placed in private\nschool were entitled to much lesser services than\nchildren placed in public school.\nSubdivision (B) dealt with the situation\nwhen children were not placed in public school but the\nlocal district consented that they could not provide a\nfree appropriate public education. As a consequence, in\nthose cases and in only those cases, since the public\nwould then be supervising and directing the private\nschool, they would be responsible for the tuition.\nSub (C) is the issue now before this Court.\nSub (C) is entitled Children Placed in Private School,\nPayment and Where the Local Education Aagency Did Not\nConsent. And that particular section is broken down\nagain into three parts. The first part says, if a child\nis offered FAPE, that is, a child is given a program\nwhich is adequate, you cannot get reimbursement if you\nremove your child during any time but in this case\nduring the pendency of the administrative and the court\nprocess.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, do you\nagree that if we conclude the language is ambiguous, we\nshould defer to the Secretary's interpretation in the\ncomments accompanying the regulations?\nMR. KOERNER: The answer is no because the\nSecretary's interpretation on the note in common and the\nletter submitted to the educational consultant is\ninconsistent with its own Federal regulation. Its\nFederal reguation, titled Children Placed in Private\nSchools When FAPE Is at Issue, also requires that you\npreviously receive --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It just mirrors the\nstatute --\nMR. KOERNER: That's exactly -- it does.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then --\nMR. KOERNER: But the note --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Assuming we would\nthink the statutory language is ambiguous, we are likely\nto think the same language in the regulation is\nambiguous.\nMR. KOERNER: Well, Chief Justice, if it's\nambiguous and we ought to at least discuss the nature of\nthe ambiguity, then that ambiguity under the spending\nclause should redound to the benefit of the local\neducation district as well, for if it does not set forth\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, which -- which\nprevails, Chevron deference or spending clause\npresumption?\nMR. KOERNER: Well, the Chevron deference\nrequires notes and comments which are persuasive and\nanalyzed. There is absolutely no analysis in the note\nand comment in this case. All it says conclusively is\nthat the decisions of this Court in Burlington and\nCarter create an independent obligation separate and\ndistinct from the statute. It doesn't explain why the\nspecific language of the statute should not be\nincorporated in the Burlington court. And --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If Gilbert F. had attended\nthe public school for 11 days, would this case come out\ndifferently, in your view?\nMR. KOERNER: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If the student here had\nattended the public school for let's say 11 days before\nbeing transferred to the public -- to the private\nschool, would your, would your arguments still fly?\nMR. KOERNER: No. If the -- if the child\nattends a public school and receives special education\nand related services --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You've added something to\nthe question, though, didn't you?\nMR. KOERNER: No, I don't think so.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Attending public school and\nreceiving --\nMR. KOERNER: I -- I thought, I'm sorry --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, that was my\nassumption. Let's say he attends public school in a\nspecial education class for 11 days. His parents think\nthe public -- the placement that's proposed, the IEP\nthat's proposed by the school is inadequate, and they\nturn out to be correct, and they want to send their\nchild to the private school, but they understand this\nargument based on the statutory language, so they say\nall right, we are going to put him in the public school\nspecial education class for 11 days, so -- we've already\ngot the placement in the private school all lined up at\nthe end of the 11 days. He goes one day, we give\nnotice; we take him out and we put him in the private\nschool; then they are entitled to reimbursement subject\nunder your argument.\nMR. KOERNER: That -- that would satisfy the\nstatutory definition, but when it went before the\nimpartial officer, or the State review officer, there\nwould be a very compelling argument that there was a\nlack of cooperation, because it's not just that you're\nin the system, but that you articulate the problems that\nyou have with the public placement.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it depends on\nthe particular circumstances. I mean, if the parent is\nable to show look, the school district is being very\nunreasonable here; it's clear he is going to need more\nthan the services they were going to offer, well that\nwouldn't have --\nMR. KOERNER. Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- run afoul of any\nof the other provisions.\nMR. KOERNER: My only comment, Chief\nJustice, was that yes, that would satisfy the statutory\nsection as long as the notice was given in triple I, but\nwe would then have an argument in the individual case\nthat the parent was not cooperating. So for the purpose\nof this case, where they come into the system even for a\nminimum period and give the appropriate notice under\ntriple I, yes, that would -- it would be satisfied.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, why would Congress\never have wanted to adopt a scheme like that? What\npossible purpose is served by simply requiring the\nstudent to be in a placement that is by definition not\nproviding a -- not providing FAPE for this very short\nperiod of time? It makes no sense whatsoever.\nMR. KOERNER: The reason Congress wanted to\nprovide it is the reason that this Court discussed in\nBurlington. The upset of this Court in Burlington was\nthat it was an extremely protracted process. The child\nthere was subject to a very long impartial hearing and\nState review and court review --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So that enabled the\nparent to remove the child immediately and risk that --\nMR. KOERNER: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the public education\nwould be found inadequate.\nMR. KOERNER: But the reason --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But all that section does\nis to repeat the Burlington scenario. It says, it\ncodifies what the Court held. The Court didn't say\nanything in Burlington about the situation where the\nchild was never in public education.\nMR. KOERNER: That's correct, but it's a\nstatute of limitations. It says that you must receive\nspecial education and related services. There is no --\nthere is no exception to the condition -- if you look at\nthe particular statute when they refer to \"may,\" they\nare only talking about the relief that a court or\nimpartial hearing officer or State review officer can\ngrant. They are not talking about the predicate, you\nmust be in the system.\nNow you asked, Justice Alito, why do they\nhave to be in the system, and the reason is Congress\nthought that if you're in the system and you have a\nvested interest in the system, that because of all the\nprocesses that are there, including mediation, including\na modified IEP, that it would increase the numbers of\npeople in terms of cooperation who want to participate\nin the system.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought it wasn't that.\nI thought it was simply Congress figured that there are\nprobably a lot of people in New York City, in Manhattan\nin particular, who are going to send their kids to\nprivate school, no matter what, and they can get special\nservices in private school, but what the heck, if we can\nget $30,000 from the city to pay for it, that's fine.\nIn other words, this was meant to be an\noption for people who wanted to go to the public schools\nbut couldn't go to the public schools because they\ncouldn't get the private services there, but it was\nnever meant to be an option for people who had no desire\nto go to public schools at all anyway, and --\nMR. KOERNER: I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- and without this\ncondition, somebody, I think the plaintiff here was\nnever in the public school, was he?\nMR. KOERNER: That's correct. He never had\nany contact with the public school at all except to\nrequest a free appropriate public education.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are there not children --\nI think there was a brief on behalf of the Autism\nSociety that says many school systems simply do not have\nthe facilities to attend to the needs of these children?\nMR. KOERNER: Yes, but you don't know that\nuntil you've actually been subjected to the process\nitself. Indeed in Schaffer, you, this Court said that\nyou had to presume that the officials in the department\nof education of a local school district are going to do\ntheir job. Their job is to try to find an appropriate\nIEP. If it turns out that it's insufficient, of course\nyou can then litigate.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are there not cases where\nschool districts have said from day one, look, we don't\nhave facilities to handle this type of disability?\nMR. KOERNER: But if we don't -- if the\npublic schools district does not have the facilities,\nthen it will consent to a private placement to deal with\nthe particular problem it cannot deal with. We are only\ntalking about cases where the school system believes it\ncan deal with an individual problem and at the very\nleast if the person's child comes into the system, they\nwill have the opportunity to work with the parent and\ntry to work out a situation. In -- as this Court is\nwell aware, the primary obligation is to find a public\neducation for this child, and if from day one you assume\nthat the individual education plan is defective, not\nonly is it inconsistent with Schaffer, it's inconsistent\nwith the whole statutory scheme which is set up to try\nto work cooperatively. Indeed --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But isn't it true that\nthe parent will never be reimbursed? Let's take the\nparent that Justice Scalia has hypothesized, will never\nget one penny of that tuition unless that parent carries\nthe burden -- the parent would have the burden of\nshowing that there was no appropriate public education?\nMR. KOERNER: The parent in this case can\nnever get reimbursed because they don't meet the\npredicate which is that their child had to previously --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's not the question I\nasked.\nMR. KOERNER: Oh I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I said that the parent --\nlet's assume that the parent never sends the child to\npublic school, nonetheless seeks reimbursement. In\norder to get reimbursement that parent would have to\nshow, would have bear the burden of showing that there\nis no appropriate public education available; is that\nnot true?\nMR. KOERNER: Yes. You mean assuming the\nstatute does not apply?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but that is -- but the\nparent would not have to show that the parent would have\nused that available public remedy --\nMR. KOERNER: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- if it were there?\nMR. KOERNER: And Congress could have\nconcluded that the parent you're referring to who placed\nthat child immediately in a private school, and who may\nnot have an interest in obtaining a public school\neducation for that child, may not be as cooperative and\nas collaborative as someone who has a child in the\nsystem, to work out an individual education plan because\nof some of these --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then the conclusion would\nbe that that parent hasn't met the heavy burden of\nshowing that there is no appropriate public education.\nMR. KOERNER: But the problem is, if you go\nto an impartial hearing officer as in this case, and you\nhave a child that's been in a private school for a\nnumber of years and is doing very well, and the private\nschool special ed teacher comes in and highlights all\nthe successes of the kid, and then the New York City\nDepartment of Education comes in with is profit plan\nwhich is based on speculation, because the child has\nnever been in the system, is it so unreasonable for\nCongress to conclude as a matter of statutory, explicit\nlanguage that the child should go into the system so\nthat at least with respect to your burden there's at\nleast a participatory program where they try to help the\nchild get an individual education.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If Congress's purpose really\nwas what you -- what you suggest and what I think\nJustice Scalia's question suggests, that there was a\ndesire to make parents who really had no interest in the\npublic school system give the public schools a chance,\nwhy is it that, even as you read the statute, there's no\nrequirement that the child remain in the public school\nsystem for any significant period of time? It's just\npro forma.\nMR. KOERNER: Indeed, Justice Alito.\nCongress in this case got it completely right because\nnot only did they put in the explicit language, they\nalso put in a time period because they understood that\nthis Court had ruled in a number of cases that its upset\nwas with the protracted period that a family has to have\na child in the system. But by having a notice provision\nand by thereby ensuring a parent that by giving notice\nand specifically articulating the reason why the plan is\ndeficient and giving the school district an opportunity\nto cure the problem, everybody would understand 10 days\nlater that they can leave. So the very problem that you\nhighlighted in Burlington and Carter is no longer a\nproblem under the explicit legislation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think they may --\nthey may well have to stay longer than 10 days to either\nrealize that the program is inadequate or to feel\ncomfortable that they'll be able to establish that on\nthe record. It's pretty hard to say something's not\nworking after only on 10 days.\nMR. KOERNER: Chief Judge, you're absolutely\nright. And that is why I say that would be based on an\nindividual determination. All the statute says is come\ninto the system. What happens after that, if you give\nyour notice as was raised in a hypothetical, that would\ngo to whether or not there was the duty to cooperate\nwhich was fulfilled, which also is a requirement for\nthis particular section for reimbursement.\nIt's not just that you are in a program and\nprivate school is providing appropriate service and then\nyou have an IEP that may not provide the free\nappropriate public education, but you also have to show\nyou cooperated with the program because the whole\nprimary purpose of the program is to provide a public\neducation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, to be fair, this\nprovision doesn't just apply to the rich person who\nwants New York City to pay 30,000 of his tuition to a\nprivate school. It also applies to somebody who is\nalready in public school, and the program offered by the\n-- by the city is patently inadequate. You are\ncompelling the parent nonethe less to put the kid in a\nprogram that anybody would see will -- will not meet the\nneeds.\nMR. KOERNER: That is correct, but your --\nfirst of all, Congress could weigh the balance between\nthat particular problem and the need to give the school\ndistrict an opportunity to try to provide a program, but\nit does run contrary to this Court's discussion in\nSchaffer which presumes that the school district is\ngoing try to accommodate the child, try to provide the\nneeds of the child.\nIn effect, I think all of these questions\nare based on the assumption that the plan is going to be\nautomatically deficient. I don't believe there's any\nfoundation this Court has indicated there's no\nfoundation. That's why it said in Schaffer that the\nparent has the ultimate burden of persuasion because it\npresumed that the plan -- if you accept that principle,\nwhich has already been articulated and you accept the\nfact that specialists on the Board of Education have --\nare going to try to adjust to this kid's needs, then\nhaving the kid in the system even for a short while is\nsomething that Congress could determine. And indeed\nthat's what the language says.\nNow, we recognize that there is an absurd\nargument, but it was difficult for us to understand how\nit would be absurd to require this when indeed it would\nsolve the problems of Burlington and Carter because it\nmakes sure that if a parent doesn't want to stay for a\nprotracted period, it doesn't have to stay and then they\ncan litigate later. As Judge Alito noted, it would be\nas little as 10 days.\nI mean some arguments -- some of the\narguments I should at least mention that the other side\nhas made: The chief -- in the Second Circuit, the\nargument was that there was an ambiguity because the\nword \"only\"0 wasn't used. So if I may use the example\nthat an individual may be eligible for welfare\nrecipients -- welfare benefits if that individual\npreviously received food stamps, the argument would be,\nwell, that's a little ambiguous because you didn't say\n\"only received food stamps.\" Of course, the condition\ndoesn't have to have \"only\" and it probably undermines a\nlot of statutes that Congress has passed. The language\nis very, very clear.\nThe second argument that is made both by the\nSolicitor General and Respondent is that there's been an\n-- implied repeals of this Court's decisions in\nBurlington and Carter. But an implied repeal is when\nyou have two statutes that are specific and the latest\nspecific statute is inconsistent with the earlier\nspecific statute. These courts' decisions were based on\na general remedy provision and, more importantly, this\nstatute encompassed what this Court held because it\nprovided that you can remove your child once in the\nsystem and the notice provision provides that you don't\nhave to be in the system very long.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is there any suggestion in\nthe reasoning in the Burlington case that it was limited\nto a situation in which the student had been receiving\npublic school special education?\nMR. KOERNER: No. But it was a holding\nwhere the student was in fact receiving special\neducation. The next case, of course, would have been\none where the -- now, a more interesting question would\nhave been raised if you had (iii) and not (ii). If you\nonly had the notice provision where Congress\ncontemplates you have to be in the system to give\nnotice, and I came to this Court and I said, under\n(iii), Congress has really contemplated you have to at\nleast be in the system for a short amount of time. You\ndidn't have (ii), which clarifies exactly what Congress\nsaid, and this Court would have to then consider whether\nor not (iii), by itself, would be -- would create enough\nof an ambiguity in its (inaudible) decisions or whether\nor not (iii) could be enforced without referring to (ii)\nbecause why do you give notice?\nThink about the result in this case. For\nsomeone in the system, they have to give notice and an\nopportunity to cure, and the IEP can be modified. If\nyou're not in the system and you never had any interest\nin the system and you sought tuition reimbursement, you\nwould have less of a bureaucratic process. There would\nbe a preverse incentive to stay outside the system. You\nwouldn't have to give notice. You would just have to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, I don't think\nthat's true, because the problem would be you would go\nto the hearing to see if you were getting the adequate\neducation and you would have -- you would essentially\nhave to make a facial challenge rather than an\nas-applied one, and the school would say, well, you\ndidn't give us a chance; we were going to do this and we\nwere going to do that. So it would be a heavier burden\nto carry. The parents would have a heavier burden.\nMR. KOERNER: But that would --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- if they did --\nMR. KOERNER: But that would be an\nindividual determination, Chief Judge. What I'm saying\nthough, for everybody in the system, it doesn't depend\non an impartial hearing. You have to give notice\nbefore you get to the next step. If you're outside the\nsystem, you don't have to participate in any process\nother than to seek at an impartial hearing the right to\nget reimbursement. So that actually there's less\nbureaucratic processes outside the system, and there's\nand incentive (1) not to cooperate and (2) just to\nmarshal all your arguments in the impartial hearing and\nhopefullyl you're going to prevail and get the payment\nfor the private education; whereas, if you're in the\nsystem --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, my suggestion is\nstill that it would be easier to prevail at the\nimpartial hearing, if you can say, look, we tried, it\ndidn't work, as opposed to saying, we never even tried.\nMR. KOERNER: Except for --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If I were the\nimpartial hearing examiner, I would think that that's a\nharder burden for the parents to carry if they didn't\neven try. The school's going to come in and say, here's\nwhat we would have done if you'd given us a chance and\nyou didn't give us a chance.\nMR. KOERNER: But there is a dynamic at\nthese hearings that, if you come in and that you're in a\nprivate school and you show that your child is doing\nwell in the private school, and we come in with a\ntheoretical plan that has never been implemented, there\nis going to be a dynamic with the impartial hearing\nofficer who will tilt towards keeping the child --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the basis for\nsaying that, when the one thing that the statute is very\nclear on is that the starting premise of any\nreimbursement claim is that an appropriate public\neducation is not available? That wouldn't concentrate,\ntesting that wouldn't concentrate on what the private\nschool is doing but what the public school could do.\nMR. KOERNER: You're right, Justice\nGinsburg. I was only commenting on the dynamic. Of\ncourse, we would try to show it, but we can't show it\nbased on -- any actual interaction with the child. We\ncan't show we observed the child in the school and tried\nto make the following modifications.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you don't have the\nburden; the parents do.\nMR. KOERNER: Yes. That is the technical\nrelationship. That's right. I'm talking more about --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The parent would presumably\ncover themselves, look it, he's getting X,Y -- X, Y, and\nZ in the private school and you're going to give him Z;\nZ is not going to be enough. And the burden on you\nwould be upon you to say, oh, we think Z is enough.\nMR. KOERNER: That's correct. But, of\ncourse, what we're saying has no actual practice.\nBut all this is separate and distinct from\nthe language of Congress. And unless that language is\nobserved, it does require that you have to previously\nreceive special education related services.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about an exception if,\nin fact, the school district admits that they can't do\nanything for this child?\nMR. KOERNER: Well, then, Your Honor, that\ncomes under Section B of the same section, 20 U.S.C.\n1412(a)(10)(B), where the school district does not\nbelieve it can provide the service, then it will consent\nto a private school and will give reimbursement because\nthat will be the equivalent of the free appropriate\npublic education. We are just talking about cases where\nthere has not yet been -- where the school believes they\ncan provide it. The parent and the child disagree.\nNow, there are two other arguments that I\nwant to address. One, recognizing that the language\nseems to support the petitioner's position. They argue\nthat, in fact, they did get special education and\nrelated services because for the years 1997 and 1998 and\n1998-1999, we settled with them and we did pay the\ntuition. But Paragraph 17 of each of those agreements\nspecifically provided that the settlement was not to\ncreate any admission for future applications.\nAnd as this Court is aware, both under the\nFederal Rules of Evidence in its decisions in Arizona v.\nColorado and the U.S. First International Building\nCompany, if you settle, it has no probative value. All\nyou do is settle the specific claim. You don't settle\nthe legal issue.\nThe second argument they make is, well, we\nhave got an IEP. An IEP is a proposal of how we would\nservice the child. And that IEP would constitute a\nspecial education and related service. But an IEP which\nthe parent rejects could never be a special education\nrelated system. You have to be in the system receiving\nit.\nAnd indeed, in Section 1414 of U.S.C., it\nspecifically provides if you reject the IEP, you've\nwaived any right to a free and appropriate public\neducation. So once you do that, it ends the discussion.\nI have a few minutes and I'm going to\nreserve that time for a possible reply.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Koerner.\nMr. Gardephe.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL G. GARDEPHE,\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMR. GARDEPHE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court.\nWhen a child with a learning disability has\nbeen denied a free and appropriate public education,\nwhich is what happened here, IDEA authorizes an award of\nprivate school tuition reimbursement, whether or not the\nchild previously receives special education related\nservices under the authority of a public agency. The\nBoard's argument that it can both deny space and remain\nnot liable for private school tuition reimbursement is\nnot compatible with the statute or with this Court's\njurisprudence. 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) did not overrule\nBurlington and did not impose the Hobson's choice in\nthat case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What did it do, then? What\nmeaning do you give to it?\nMR. GARDEPHE: Your Honor, Congress was\nfocused on the public school context. And the language\nin (C)(ii), which refers to previously received, is\nintended as a setup for (C)(iii). When you get to\n(C)(iii), you get the notice requirements. That's what\nCongress had in mind. That's why the reference is\nthere.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that.\nIt makes it very clear it is, it is (ii) which\nauthorizes the enrollment in a private school and\npayment for that. And it is prefaced with a condition:\nIf the parents of a child with a disability who\npreviously received special education and related\nservices under the authority of the public agency,\nenroll the child in a private -- the implication is if\nthere were parent of a child who was not so enrolled,\nthis provision does not apply. So then you fall back on\nthe fact that the old provision covered in our cases\nwould have applied but that makes this meaningless.\nI mean if you say that our prior cases\noverrode that limitation, then what purpose does the\nlimitation serve?\nMR. GARDEPHE: Your Honor, the first\nquestion is whether that is intended to be exclusive.\nAnd I don't think it was, because the \"only if\" language\nis not there. And the \"only if\" language is actually\nused in IDEA in multiple places. And Congress knew how\nto say only if it intended, if it intended --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where else does it say that\nthe city will pay for the cost of a private education\nexcept there? That's the only place it says it. And\npart of the requirements for getting it is that the\nchild was receiving service at a public institution.\nMR. GARDEPHE: Your Honor, Congress did not\nintend that exclusive language. If it had, it would\nhave used the \"only if\" language.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then why didn't Congress\nadequately give the equivalent of what you call the\n\"only if\" language when it began (iii) by saying the\ncost of reimbursement described in clause two? The\nreimbursement described in clause two is described in\nterms of the clause that Justice Scalia is zeroing in\non.\nMR. GARDEPHE: Because, Your Honor, the\ncontext is public school. That is the situation that\nCongress was seeking to address, and that's why you\nhave --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm sorry. I'm just not\ngetting this. Can you rephrase that?\nMR. GARDEPHE: Yes. If you look at\n(C)(iii), Your Honor, it obviously repeatedly refers to\nprior to the removal of a child from the public school.\nSo Congress was clearly focused on and it was intending\nto give guidance to the courts in their equitable -- in\nexercising their equitable powers. So in the context of\na child who was in public school, these are the types of\nnotice and cooperation things the court should take into\nconsideration.\nThe question, Your Honor, is whether they\nintended this to be the exclusive vehicle by which\ntuition reimbursement could be obtained? And the answer\nto that, Your Honor, is no. And the reason why the\nanswer is no is because there is no \"only if\" language.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you read --\nhypothesize two statutes: One, the statute before the\nphrase \"who previously received special education\" was\nadded and the statute after? You read both of those\nstatutes the same way; right?\nMR. GARDEPHE: No, Your Honor, I don't.\nBecause the question is, does that language serve any\npurpose? And my answer to that, the language in\n(C)(ii), \"previously had received,\" yes, it serves the\npurpose. The purpose is it gives factual context for\nwhat comes in (C)(iii).\nThe other thing I would like to say --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't understand.\nYou read \"who previously received special education\nservices,\" and you say that includes who previously did\nnot receive special education services.\nMR. GARDEPHE: No. What I'm saying is that\nthat provides the context for what follows in (C)(iii).\nThe context it provides is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There would be no\nreason for Congress to put that language in if the same\nright to reimbursement existed if the child had not\npreviously received special education services.\nMR. GARDEPHE: No, Your Honor. The point of\nthat language is to provide the backdrop for (C)(iii)\nwhere Congress did intend to give guidance to courts in\nthe exercise of the equitable --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because your friend\nreads that the exact opposite way and says, since\n(C)(iii) only makes sense if the child is in the public\nschool, that that's a limitation on how you should read\n(C)(ii).\nMR. GARDEPHE: I understand that, Your\nHonor. But the question is whether -- it really boils\ndown to if Congress intends to address the full --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In that case, isn't\nit pertinent that the title to (C)(ii) says\n\"Reimbursement for Private School Placement\"? It\ndoesn't say reimbursement for private school placement\nwhen the child previously attended public school.\nMR. GARDEPHE: But, Your Honor, (C)(ii) is\nnot exhaustive. Let me give an example.\nI'm sure this Court would agree that the\nrequirement, the second requirement in Burlington that\nthe private placement has to be appropriate is the law\nin this land. And (C)(ii) doesn't set forth that\nrequirement. (C)(ii) does not set forth that\nrequirement. And what that says to me is that (C)(ii)\nwas never intended by Congress to be exhaustive.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That just means that\n(C)(ii) doesn't address the entire universe of issues\nthat might arise. But that doesn't mean that it doesn't\naddress exactly what its title says, \"Reimbursement for\nPrivate School Placement.\"\nMR. GARDEPHE: Your Honor, I believe it's\nprobative on the issue of whether Congress intended\n(C)(ii) to set forth the requirements for private school\ntuition reimbursement and all the factual context in\nwhich that could be rendered.\nI do want to address one point, which is\nthat did Congress deal with this issue later? That is\nto say, in terms of the notice factors that it set forth\nin (C)(iii), which I have argued to you applied to\nparents whose children have been in public school. The\nanswer to that question, Your Honor, is, yes, they did.\nThey addressed it in 1415(f)(1)(B), which require the\n2004 amendments to IDEA.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where is that set\nforth?\nMR. GARDEPHE: 1415(f)(1)(B) -- I'm sorry,\nYour Honor, it's not in the appendix to the solicitor\ngeneral's brief. But at 1415(f)(1)(B), Your Honor, what\nthat provision requires is that parents, prior to a due\nprocess hearing, must meet with the IEP team, they must\nmeet with the school district, they must lay out their\ncomplaints about the IEP, and the statute provides give\nthe school district an opportunity to resolve the\ncomplaint.\nSo Congress did not deal with the full\nwaterfront in the 1997 amendments. It returned to this\nissue in 2004 and imposed those notice and cooperation\nrequirements that, as I've argued to you --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Were those\nprovisions at issue when this dispute arose? They are\nthe 2004 amendments --\nMR. GARDEPHE: These were 2004 amendments,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You haven't identified the\nstatutory provision that you think provides the\nauthority for the payment in this case.\nMR. GARDEPHE: Your Honor, I believe it\nbegins with 1400(d)(1)(A) and 1412(A)(1); both of which\nimpose the requirement on school districts to make\navailable the free and appropriate public education for\nthe child. I believe it begins there. It then\ncontinues to 1415 (i)(2)(C)(3), which is the provision\nthat grants courts to -- sorry, grants such relief as\nthe court determines is appropriate. There is no\nevidence either in the 1997 amendments or in its\nlegislative history that there was an intent to appeal\nor override that remedy.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose it's how\nbroadly you read legislative history. I thought there\nwas a statement by Representative Castle that this would\nlimit the payments that school districts had to make.\nMR. GARDEPHE: Yes, Your Honor, and I think\nwith respect to the children in the public school\nsystem, if you read (C)(3) -- and again these are\npermissive -- but if (C)(3) is applied, then I think\nRepresentative Castle's comments make perfect sense\nbecause they provide for certain notice obligations.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So when it comes to\nreimbursement of tuition, the parents who never place\ntheir child in the public school are in better shape\nthan the parent who place their child in public school\nand then want to remove him.\nMR. GARDEPHE: No, Your Honor. And the\nreason for that is, there was case law preceding the\n1997 amendments that imposed reasonableness\nreasonableness and cooperation requirements on parents\neven before the 1997 amendments came into effect. As I\ndid mention, after 2004 those requirements were now\nstatutory, but the reality is as a matter of case law,\nit was already very clear in 1997 that if you didn't\ngive notice to the school district, if you didn't\ncooperate in the formation of an IEP, you were not going\nto get tuition reimbursement. And of course that flows\ndirectly from, in particular, Carter's statement that\nthe reimbursement remedy is subject to equitable\nconsiderations.\nSo it has always been the law that if a\nparent does not cooperate, does not give notice, does\nnot cooperate in the formation of an IEP, that they will\nnot get -- or that the court has the discretion to deny\nthe tuition reimbursement remedy.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But cooperation does\nnot require sending the child to the public school.\nMR. GARDEPHE: No, Your Honor. I think it's\nclear that Congress never intended, to quote Justice\nScalia, that parents would be required to place their\nchild in a patently inappropriate placement in order to\nqualify for tuition reimbursement, and to address\nJustice Alito's point, Your Honor, we don't know --\nwhether it's 10 days or 11 days or 1 day -- we don't\nknow. We can draw some guidance, I suppose, from the\nten- day requirement in (C)(3), but that's by no means\nclear. The parents can give notice ten days before the\nschool day begins -- a school year began -- that they\nfind the placement inappropriate. So this --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well in my case they\nwould note have received any benefits, under the terms\nof the statute.\nMR. GARDEPHE: But Your Honor, it highlights\nthat if they can place the child in for one day, this is\nan utterly meaningless provision that Congress never\ncould have intended to require because it serves no\npurpose. And that's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's why your\nfriend says it serves the purpose of helping to make\nclear that the public school is -- whether it is or is\nnot able to provide the appropriate public education. I\nmean, why would Congress have put the phrase in there --\neven if it was describing as you say the most common\nsituation -- why would it put the phrase in there if it\ndoesn't serve that purpose at least?\nMR. GARDEPHE: Let me give an example that\nhighlights my point. I place my child in the\nkindergarten in public school for one day. I then\nsatisfy the statute, previously have received special\neducation-related services. Five years later I can\nstill rely on that. Ten years later, I can still rely\non that. It's a talisman. It can't --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What you're saying\nis it's not a very significant hurdle, but it is going\nto be a hurdle in some cases.\nMR. GARDEPHE: It doesn't serve any useful\npurpose, Your Honor, and if it doesn't serve any useful\npurpose there is no reason to believe that Congress\nintended it to have that effect.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The useful purpose\nit serves is allow the school district to show what it\ncan do in ten days, as opposed to a mere theoretical\nstatement, it allows some actual concrete practice to\nsee if the plan that the public school has developed is\ngoing to work or not going to work, that the impartial\nhearing examiner can evaluate in a more concrete\nsetting.\nMR. GARDEPHE: This Court has addressed that\nbalance in Burlington, and the answer was no, the\nstatute does not require that parents place their child\nin an inappropriate place.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But then the whole\npoint is the statute was then amended after Burlington.\nSo to say what Burlington interpreted, it don't seem to\nme to be very compelling on the question of what the\namended statute provided.\nMR. GARDEPHE: But again, Your Honor, there\nis no evidence in that amendment that it was intended to\nbe exclusive or intended to be exhaustive of the\ncircumstances and factual context.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure I agree -- Im\nnot sure I would agree with you that you could get\nspecial services which --in third grade and then come\nback 10 years later and get private school tuition. I\nwould really read this as saying if the parents of a\nchild who previously received special education under\nthe authority, enroll the child in a public elementary\nschool -- I think that there has to be a temporal\nconnection between the prior receipt and the enrollment.\nI don't think you can go back 10 years.\nMR. GARDEPHE: Let me go back --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't have to read it\nthat way, anyway.\nMR. GARDEPHE: Let me address that, Your Honor.\nWhat that would mean, then, I suppose, is that parents\nwould be required each year to put their child in a\npublic school for some period of time to qualify, and\nthen place their kid in private school if they didn't --\nand then you're talking about a disruption --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Once you're in the private\nschool reimbursement you're in the private school\nreimbursement, but you can't get into it 10 years later.\nAnyway, that issue is not -- not before us today.\nI don't understand you assertion that\nsomehow this would amount to repeal by implication. The\nprovision of 1415 -- what is it, (b), (b)(3) -- it seems\nto me is just like a provision for, for a court's\nexercise of its equitable powers. \"Shall grant such\nrelief as the court determines is appropriate\" -- if a\ncourt had granted some equitable relief in one case, and\nthen there is a statute that's passed which renders that\nequitable relief no longer appropriate, I wouldn't say\nthat that -- that that amounts to a repeal by\nimplication. It's just that what is appropriate depends\nupon the remainder of the statue, and as it exists at\nthe time that the relief is sought.\nMR. GARDEPHE: The point we are trying to\nmake, Your Honor, is that in light of Burlington, which\nobviously Congress had knowledge of when it enacted the\n1997 amendments, is it credible to believe that they\nwould have restricted, limited, overruled the holding of\nBurlington, and never said a word about it?\nJUSTICE BREYER: But they have (b). What\nabout (b)?\nSee look, there are two situations.\nSituation (a) is that the school district thinks they\ncan give them a good education, adequate. Then he\nshould go and try it out, and if by the way the school\ndistrict just can't do it, then (b). So what's been\nwrong with that scheme? Why doesn't that cover the\nwaterfront?\nMR. GARDEPHE: There is no evidence that\nCongress intended a tryout period.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Just the language -- the\nlanguage.\nMR. GARDEPHE: It's not just language.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The language plus the fact\nthat nobody can think of a reason for putting that in\nthere, unless that's the --\nMR. GARDEPHE: And it's the context that\nflows from Burlington, where the Congress was aware that\nthis Court --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But my question was what\nabout (b)? My question was not to argue with you. My\nquestion was, why doesn't (b) take care of the examples\nof absurd situations, law situations that you've\nmentioned?\nMR. GARDEPHE: I'm sorry, I'm not\nunderstanding B, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The case where the school\ndistrict just can't do it.\nMR. GARDEPHE: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If they just can't do it\nthen their job is to put the kid in a district --\nMR. GARDEPHE: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- in a place that can do\nit. And if their argument, which is your case, is it\nthey object to the facility, then have an argument about\nthat, about whether it should be this private school or\nthat private school. That's what it seems to me your\ncase is about, and that's why I think B.\nMR. GARDEPHE: In a perfect world, Your\nHonor, school districts who are confronted with a\nsituation would always make the decision to place the\nchild in private schools at public expense, but\nunfortunately there are disagreements between school\ndistricts and parents about what is appropriate, and\nthen sometimes school districts don't do what they are\nsupposed to do under the statute and in fact the city's\ninterpretation here would incentivize school districts\nnot to provide services because if they never provided\nservices they wouldn't be liable for the reimbursement.\nAgain, this can't be what Congress intended.\nI did want to back up my assertion about the\nonly --\nJUSTICE BREYER: (b), that's my question,\n(b). I thought you were right. Until I heard that.\nThen I suddenly hear no, that don't worry about it,\njudge, is what I heard, because in the situation where\nthe school district has not provided there is another\nsection of the statute that takes care of the child.\nThat's what I want to hear your response to.\nMR. GARDEPHE: Your Honor, that relies on\nthe good faith of the school district. (b) relies on,\n(a)(10)(B) and B relies on the good faith of the school\ndistrict to make a determination that they can't provide\nthe services. That's not always going to happen. There\nmay be -- there may be a disagreement about whether they\ncan provide the services or not between the school\ndistrict and the parents.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have review\nbefore the impartial hearing examiner about that alleged\nbad faith, correct?\nMR. GARDEPHE: Pardon me?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have reviewed\nbefore the Hearing Examiner that alleged bad faith on\nthe part of the school district.\nMR. GARDEPHE: Yes, Your Honor. Obviously,\nthe parents contend both that the plan was not\nappropriate, and that it wasn't offered in good faith.\nBut I -- I did want to back up my assertion on the \"only\nif\" language and -- and recite some statutory\nreferences. Because I believe it stems very clearly\nfrom the statute when you go through the provisions.\n\"Only if\" or \"only\" are used in many, many\nplaces 1415(f) (3)(E )(ii), 1414(a)(1)(C)ii,\n1411(b)(1)(A ), 1401(19)(C), 1415(k)(4)(C) in the '98\nversion of the statute, 1413 --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Bingo. You got me on that.\nMR. GARDEPHE: The point is, Your Honor,\nthat Congress knew how to say \"only if.\" They didn't do\nthat here, because they had no intention of creating an\nexclusive remedy.\nAnd this Court said in Winkelman that courts\nshould be cautious in reading into the statute an\nimplicit limitation, and this limitation goes to what\nthe Court also said in Winkelman is the primary mandate.\nFinally, Your Honor --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And what was that\nprimary mandate?\nMR. GARDEPHE: The primary mandate was to\nprovide or -- or make available a free and appropriate\npublic education to every child with learning\ndisabilities.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There is no issue of\nmainstreaming in this case at all; right?\nMR. GARDEPHE: There is not, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Neither of the\noptions are mainstream options?\nMR. GARDEPHE: That's correct, Your Honor,\nand that's at Second Circuit Appendix 168.\nThe school district here said tnat the\nchild's disabilities could not be addressed in a\nmainstream setting, so there is no mainstream issue\nhere.\nFinally, Your Honors, when Congress here\nchose to carve out populations of children, it did that\nin a very, very direct way. It did that in\n1412(a)(1)(B) where it lays out very limited exceptions\nfor children who do not receive the guarantee with\nrespect to a free and appropriate public education.\nThe limitation is very, very clear. It's\nvery, very limited to certain age groups where it would\nbe inconsistent with state law, or there is an\nincarcerated child. But there is no other place that\nCongress carved out populations of children other than\nin 1412(a)((1)((B), and there is no reason to believe\nthat Congress intended in a backdoor fashion to carve\nout the populations of children, some of which were\nmentioned in the argument of my adversary.\nCongress was aware --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You know, it -- I'm\nsorry.\nMR. GARDEPHE: Your Honor, my time is up.\nThank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So is mine. Thank\nyou, Mr. Gardephe.\nMR. GARDEPHE: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Garre.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE,\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE\nSUPPORTING RESPONDENT\nMR. GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nPetitioner takes the position that a school\ndistrict may both refuse to provide a child with a\ndisability with an appropriate public placement and\nrefuse to pay for an appropriate private placement.\nThis Court has twice before considered and\ntwice before unanimously rejected --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, he hasn't -- he hasn't\nsaid that.\nMR. GARRE: I think he does in the sense,\nYour Honor, Justice Scalia, that the -- the school\ndistrict can take the position, even if the IET that is\nproposed is inadequate and it's adjudicated to be\ninadequate, because the Schaffer presumption that was\nbrought up earlier does not apply in this case. Because\nwe are talking about situations where a parent can prove\nthat the placement was inadequate. In that situation\nthe parent cannot qualify for reimbursement unless it\nsubjects his child to the inappropriate placement.\nThis Court rejected that rationale in clear\nand unambiguous terms in the Burlington case. Justice\nRehnquist put it in that case --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Under a different statute.\nMR. GARRE: Under a different statute but\ninterpreting the fundamental requirement of the statute\nthat all children with disabilities are entitled to a\nfree and appropriate public education. But that\nrequirement didn't change, and this is what Justice\nRehnquist --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You are interpreting some\nvery general language: \"Shall grant such relief as the\ncourt determines is appropriate.\"\nMR. GARRE: The -- the part of the\nBurlington case I'm referring to Justice Scalia is the\ninterpretation of the fundamental requirement of\nproviding free and appropriate public education. And\nwhat Justice Rehnquist said there -- and the unanimous\nCourt agreed -- is forcing a parent to choose between\nsubjecting his child to inadequate public placement or\npaying for private placement deprives the parent of his\nright to a free and appropriate public education.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So does the\n10-business-days notice requirement for people who are\nin public schools also violate Burlington, because for\n10 business days they are going to be subject to an\ninappropriate education?\nMR. GARRE: The way the 10-business-days\nrequirement works in practice is that all of the IEPs --\nvirtually all of them are proposed towards the end of\nthe school year; and, typically, the parent is submitted\nthe proposed IEP during the summer. And it's at that\npoint that they have to make a decision whether to\nlitigate that, put their child in a private school, or\nput them into a public school.\nSo the 10 business days in practice is not\ngoing to require the child to go into the inadequate\nplacement. That was true in the fact pattern --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So in a situation\nwhere it's not in the summer, where they say, well,\nlet's see how it works, and then they go to the public\nschool, I would have thought your argument also would\nsay it's not -- they don't have to give notice of 10\nbusiness days because in Burlington you said you don't\n-- you have to make available the tuition reimbursement.\nThey passed a statute imposing a limitation on that, 10\nbusiness days.\nMR. GARRE: And we don't -- we don't dispute\nthat --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't dispute\nthat limitation. You dispute the other one, though,\nwhich says they have to have previously received\nspecial-education services.\nMR. GARRE: In order -- in order to qualify\nfor reimbursment in that provision which is -- which is\nfollowed by the provision describing in more concrete\ndetail the circumstances that courts ought to take into\naccount in determining whether reimbursement is\nappropriate.\nAnd if I can explain the way we read Section\n1412(a)(10)((C), the first part of that subsection is\nSubsection (C)(i). That hasn't come up during the\nargument today. It is barely mentioned in Petitioner's\nbrief. That subsection -- it is on page 5a in the\nappendix to the Gray brief, lays down the general rule\n-- the rule that tells school districts when they don't\nhave to worry about paying reimbursement. And that is\nwhen they provide a free, a public -- an appropriate\npublic education in the first place.\nThat -- that is consistent with Burlington\nand Carter, and that lays down the general rule. School\ndistricts that provide an appropriate placement don't\nhave to worry about reimbursement.\nSubsection (C)(ii) then goes on to identify\na particular fact pattern which also happens to be the\nmost common situation in which reimbursement claims are\npresented to the courts. And Congress in that\nsituation, along with Subsections (3) and (4), provided\nthe courts with more concrete guidance in determining\nhow to exercise their discretion in that situation.\nThe legislative history supports that\ninterpretation. On pages 25 to 29 of the National\nDisability Rights Network brief they explain how\nCongress in the legislative history indicates that they\nwere focused on case law applying this Court's decision\nin Burlington and Carter where the students were already\nenrolled in public school.\nThere is no indication whatsoever at all in\nthe legislative record that anybody had in mind scaling\nback the fundamental mandate of the statute for school\ndistricts to provide a free and appropriate public\neducation for every child.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Anywhere? I thought\nRepresentative Castle said that this would result on\neasing the burden on the school districts to pay\ntuitions.\nMR. GARRE: And it would, Your Honor,\ninsofar as we are dealing with flushing out the\nrequirements for students enrolled in public school.\nBut there is no indication that Congress meant to scale\nback this Court's interpretation of the act's\nfundamental mandate to provide a free and appropriate\npublic education.\nPetitioner's give-it-a-try rationale just\ndoesn't fit to advance its argument before this Court.\nIt doesn't fit to the extent that Petitioner is\nsuggesting that you have to give public school a try,\nbecause it's clear that the -- their interpretation\nwould apply to students in public school, as well as\nprivate school. It would apply to all students entering\nthe special education system, including the student\nwho's been enrolled in public school from kindergarten\nto 11th grade.\nIf he hasn't previously received\nspecial-education or related services, then, under\nPetitioner's view, if he's offered a grossly inadequate\nplan, he has to be subjected to that plan in order for\nhis parents to qualify. And Petitioner's interpretation\ndoesn't require the parents to give the proposed\nplacement at issue a try. All it requires is that they\nshow that they received previous special-education\nservices at some point in the past.\nAnd that's the way it worked in Burlington;\nthat's the way it worked in Carter; and that's the way\nit works in most of the cases. Students are already in\nthe special education system, and they are proposed an\nIET at some point typically during the summer. And the\nparents at that time say this IET is inadequate for my\nchild, and I want to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's no problem. I\nmean both sides agree that you can move to a private\nschool if that's so; right?\nMR. GARRE: If you have previously received\nspecial- education services. But my point, Justice\nScalia, is under Petitioner's -- the way they read the\nstatute, you don't have to give the proposed placement\nat issue a try. So to the extent that this Court\nthinks, or Petitioner is arguing, that Congress wanted\nto make sure that we could better evaluate whether or\nnot this proposed placement proposed placement is going\nto work for this child. That doesn't fit with the\nstatutory language because in practice the students --\nall they have to show is that they received services at\nsome point in the past and if they have they can go into\nprivate school and seek reimbursement. It doesn't\nrequire a student to be subjected to the inadequate plan\nunless you happen to be the student who is enrolled in\npublic school or enrolled in private school and you're\nentering the special education system. At that point\nthen, Petitioner's interpretation requires the parents\nto enroll their child who has already been determined to\nhave a learning disability in a plan that is inadequate,\nand we think that is an untenable result.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the whole point\nis you don't necessarily know it's inadequate until\nlater in time. Right? The school board thinks it is\nadequate.\nMR. GARRE: That's true, Your Honor. But\ntwo points about that -- first, parents who do enroll\ntheir children in private school at their own financial\nrisk. And as Justice Scalia pointed out in his\nconcurring and dissenting opinion in Winkelman, there\nare particular incentives against bringing frivolous\nreimbursement claims in this context.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Except those -- there are a\nlot of parents who are going to send their parents to\nprivate school, no matter what. They are well-heeled\nand this is just an opportunity to have New York City\npay $30,000 of it.\nMR. GARRE: And Justice Scalia -- two points\non that, first the statute provides in clear and\nunambiguous terms that all children with disabilities\nare entitled to a free and appropriate education. The\nchild find requirement, which Section 1412 --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even the child who would\nturn down the adequate education provided by the public\nschools. I don't think that was the intent of the\nstatute.\nMR. GARRE: And I agree with you on that,\nJustice Scalia, and that's why the way that school\ndistricts can avoid reimbursement is to offer an\nadequate placement in the first place. That's what\nSection 1412(a)(10)(C)(i) provides. It lays down the\ngeneral rule. School district today talks about we need\nto have collaboration, we need to have cooperation\nduring the IEP process. They hold all the cards during\nthat process. And if they want to avoid reimbursement\nthey should do what this Court said in the Carter case,\nthat's provide the student with a free, appropriate\npublic education.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If they don't have an\nadequate placement, they should not have to pay the\nfreight for people who would not be coming to public\nschool any way. That's what this provision prevents.\nMR. GARRE: I disagree with that, Your\nHonor. I think that's inconsistent with the statutory\nmandate to provide a free and appropriate education for\nall children with disabilities. I would say though, and\nI want to be clear on this -- even though appearance of\nstudents in private school or in public school who\nhaven't previously received special education or related\nservices qualify for reimbursement under our\ninterpretation of the statute. It doesn't mean that\nthey are entitled to reimbursement. In the situations\nYour Honor may have in mind, where the parents genuinely\naren't complying in good faith or genuinely aren't\ninterested in sending their kids to public school, they\nonly want to try to gain the system -- in those\nhypothetical situations, courts have equitable\ndiscretion to deny reimbursement claims, and they have\ndenied those reimbursement claims.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Garre. Mr. Koerner, you have three minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD J. KOERNER\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. KOERNER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nFirst, this particular provision, as the Chief Justice\nnoted, is called payment for private school placements\nwhere they don't have the consent of the local\neducation. Any reasonable reading of that is that it's\nall encompassing. And any person who has to apply has\nto satisfy those provisions. Second, this statute did\nnot overrule Burlington or Carter. In those cases the\nchildren were already receiving special services. Now\nit could be in a future case someone would speak to\nextend those cases, but Congress has now spoken to make\nsure that Burlington and Carter go no further than you\nhave previously held. Third, there is an assumption\nthat the program is going to be defective from day one.\nBut that's contrary to this Court's decision in Schaffer\nwhich presumes the good faith of the individuals who\npropose in program. And that is the heart of the entire\ncase. Fourth, let's assume, for example, that someone\ncan create an ambiguity in this case. Citing the\nArlington case, in which you placed yourself in the\nposition of the local education officer, when you look\nat this particular section -- and particularly C double\n2 -- double i and triple i. Would you, in that\nposition, understand that it doesn't really mean what it\nsays, that previously received special education\nservices was only meant to cover the people already in\nthe system and was not intended to cover people outside\nthe system. That isn't what it says. More importantly,\nthe ambiguity is clearly not obvious. So how would a\nlocal officer who has to understand whether or not to\nplace the funds at risk know whether or not in complying\nwith this particular situation, it was explicit or\nimplicit?\nJUSTICE ALITO: During the period between\nBurlington and the enactment of this statute, would you\nhave any doubt about your potential obligation to\nreimburse a parent -- during the period of Burlington\nand the enactment of the statute, would the school board\nhave had doubt about its potential liability for\nreimbursement, in a situation like this?\nMR. KOERNER: I think so. I think, because\nof Burlington and Carter, where the children were\nalready in the system, this would be the next step.\nWould we have presented to you the fact that you\nshouldn't expand it? Probably. Would I know what you\nwould conclude? No, but the statute eliminated that\nentire discussion. It is clear. But again, there is a\nvery big spending clause -- as I mentioned in my earlier\npresentation, if it's so ambiguous that you can read out\na specific provision, how can that ambiguity not go down\nto the benefit of the city through it's local education\nsystem?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought this statute\nwas also premised on Section 5 of the 14th Amendment, in\nwhich case it wouldn't have spending clause notice\nargument.\nMR. KOERNER: No, the -- this is just a\ngrant provision, Your Honor. It's not premised on any\nconstitutional provision. It's a grant where funds are\nprovided to the local education district, and in return\nthey agree to comply with all the conditions set forth\nin the IDEA. There are no constitutional limits. Thank\nyou very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n"
