        "content": "(10:09 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument first this morning in Case 09-1533, DePierre v.\nUnited States.\nMr. Pincus.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PINCUS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe question in this case is whether the\ndramatically harsher mandatory minimum penalty for what\nthe statute terms cocaine base applies to all offenses\ninvolving cocaine or only those involving substances\nwith the characteristics of crack cocaine. In its brief\nin the Kimbrough case, the government described the\nprovision at issue here as reflecting Congress's\ndetermination that, and I'm quoting, \"crimes involving\ncrack should be subject to considerably more severe\npenalties.\" We agree.\nCongress's targeting of a limited subset of\nthe substances qualifying chemically as -- as cocaine is\nmanifest in the statutory structure, in the language,\nfor three basic reasons. And I'm going to be looking at\npage 2 of our blue brief, which has the relevant\nstatutory provision.\nFirst, the only way to give different\nmeaning to two distinct terms that Congress used in the\nstatute -- \"cocaine\" on the one hand and \"cocaine base\"\non the other -- is to make clear that cocaine base means\nsomething different than all substances with the\nchemical formula C17H21NO4.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Pincus, if -- if I\nunderstand your interpretation correctly, it would\nexclude freebase. How is that a sensible interpretation\nof the statute, one that would exclude freebase, a\ncommonly known substance? Congress was aware of it.\nThe Richard Pryor incident had occurred. Everybody knew\nit was dangerous. Wasn't it at least true that Congress\nmeant to incorporate that substance as well?\nMR. PINCUS: Let me answer -- answer your\nquestion with a little bit of detail, Justice Kagan,\nbecause I think our reply brief wasn't as clear as it\nmight have been, because the word \"freebase\" has,\nreally, three different meanings. It means a\nmanufacturing process; it means a method of use of a\ncocaine-related substance; and it also means a\nsubstance.\nSo just to be clear: Freebase, the\nmanufacturing process, occurs when cocaine\nhydrochloride, the powder form of cocaine, is mixed with\nether and ammonia in a very volatile mixture and boiled.\nMost -- many users of freebase inhale the fumes that are\nreleased during that manufacturing process. That\nprocess is very dangerous, as the Richard Pryor incident\nshowed, because the substance is quite volatile and will\nexplode. If that process -- if the substance is not\nused then, but goes to the very end, when all of the\nliquids are boiled off, then it does produce a rock-like\nsubstance similar to crack cocaine.\nOur submission is that the -- if the\nsubstance is permitted to go to the end, and if, in\neffect, ether and ammonia are used as a substitute for\nsodium bicarbonate, then the substance does qualify\nunder the statute, because it is a rock-like substance\nthat has -- is chemically cocaine, and was produced in a\nmethod similar to the reacting of sodium bicarbonate\nwith baking soda.\nBut in -- when the process is in the middle\nof the production process, we don't think Congress meant\nto reach that for a couple of reasons. First of all,\nbecause that was -- is -- that substance is not\nsomething that's easily marketable. And one of the key\nthings that Congress was concerned about was the\nmarketability of crack cocaine in its rock-like form.\nThat's what made the really big difference.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Pincus, if the -- the\nsubstance that is involved in this case was a rock-like\nsubstance and it wasn't a powder. So why doesn't it\nbelong? It's a rock-like substance. Why should it be\noutside the category cocaine base?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, I think there would be a\nfactual question in this case. None of the courts\nbelow, Justice Ginsburg, determined whether, in fact,\nthis -- the substance at issue in this case was crack\ncocaine, because the district court ruled that that\nwasn't necessary, that all chemical -- as long as the\nsubstance chemically qualified as cocaine, it satisfied\nthe statutory requirement, and the First Circuit agreed.\nSo in this case, there -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Correct me if am I wrong\nabout this -- I may have a misimpression -- but I\nthought you were objecting to a charge to the jury that\ncharged cocaine base and didn't charge crack.\nMR. PINCUS: We're -- we're objecting to\nthe -- the fact that the district judge charged the jury\nand himself determined that in order for this very\nsevere 100-to-1 penalty to apply, it was not necessary\nfor the substance to qualify as crack cocaine. All it\nhad to do was to be a chemical form of cocaine.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If we agree with you, how\nshould a judge instruct a jury to determine whether a\nsubstance is crack? Should the judge use the definition\nin the sentencing guidelines?\nMR. PINCUS: A judge could use the\ndefinition in the sentencing guidelines, Your Honor.\nLet me just say, as a threshold question, in many cases\nthis won't be a jury question.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But in those -\nMR. PINCUS: In those cases, we think there\nare three -- there are three elements. One is the\nsubstance has to qualify chemically as cocaine. The\nsecond is it was prepared by processing cocaine\nhydrochloride with sodium bicarbonate or with a\ndifferent reactant that produces a similar chemical\neffect. And third, that it's a rock-like or otherwise\nsolid, that is smokeable, that is able to produce the\ninhalable vapors. We think those are the key -\nJUSTICE ALITO: It has to have all three of\nthose characteristics?\nMR. PINCUS: All three of those\ncharacteristics.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But I thought you just said\nthat freebase would qualify, and freebase would not have\nthe second of those characteristics; isn't that right?\nIt was -- it would not be prepared using a base?\nMR. PINCUS: It would, because ammonia is\none of the -- is one of -- it's ammonia and ether that\nhave -- that are used to prepare freebase.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So if it had any base?\nMR. PINCUS: Any base. We are -- the lower\ncourts, in applying the sentencing guidelines\ndefinition, have said that sodium bicarbonate is not\nrequired. We think it is not required. They've\nrecognized other substances, and we think as long as the\nprocess is similar, that that's what the sentencing\nguidelines capture, that's what the statute captures.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that. I\ncan understand the argument that -- that Congress was -\nwas directing its statute at crack, and crack had -- had\na very definite meaning, which didn't include any\nsubstance that -- that is rock-hard and has been\nproduced in the manner you suggest.\nYou're coming up -- you're urging upon us a\ndefinition that neither is the definition of crack nor\nis the chemical definition of cocaine base. It's\nneither fish nor fowl.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, respectfully, Justice\nScalia, I think that Congress was focused on crack.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Crack.\nMR. PINCUS: Because it -- because it was a\nsubstance that had particular characteristics.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's right. But you\ndon't argue that. That's not the meaning you want us to\ngive it.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, we do -- we do want the\nmeaning to be a substance with those particular\ncharacteristics. I think the only question that\nwe're -- that we're debating is whether baking -- the\nuse of baking soda is essential, because all of those\nother -- those other three characteristics are\ncharacteristics of crack.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's essential to crack.\nMR. PINCUS: Well -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You wouldn't call it crack\nif it weren't made that way, would you?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, I think in 1986, the\ndefinitions were not that clear. And I think the\nsentencing commission has said, and certainly the lower\ncourts have said, both in applying the limited\ndefinition of the statute for which we contend and also\nin interpreting the sentencing guidelines, that the use\nof a different base gets at what Congress -- is still a\ncategory of substance that Congress -- Congress cared\nabout.\nObviously, if the Court would like to\nconstrue the statute more narrowly and say baking soda\nis required, we wouldn't object to that. But we think\nthat Congress -- one of the reasons that Congress used\nthe term \"cocaine base\" was that it was trying to\ncapture a category of substances that had particular\ncharacteristics and wasn't focused so much on the exact\nchemical formula that went into it, because Congress\nknew, in the drug area, it would -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How does \"cocaine base\"\nsuggest what you want? It has to be -- it has to be\nrock and it has to be base cocaine produced in one of\nthe fashions you suggested. I don't know how \"cocaine\nbase\" remotely suggests that.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, I think in -- in three\nways, Your Honor. First of all, because Congress didn't\nuse the term \"cocaine,\" which is used elsewhere in the\nprovision, it clearly meant a subset. It didn't mean\nall of the -- all of the substances with the chemical\nformula that satisfies the chemical term \"cocaine.\"\nSecond of all, the statute shows just by the\n100-to-1 ratio that Congress was focused on something\nthat was especially dangerous, much more dangerous than\npowder.\nThird, the legislative context was, as the\nCourt said in Kimbrough, that this was a statute that\nwas enacted in response to a particular problem, and I\nthink the question we're debating is: Would Congress\nhave said, when it defined the term -- when it defined\nthe term \"cocaine base\" -- and I should say, \"base\" was\none of the street terms, colloquial terms, that was used\nat the time to -- to describe these categories of\nsubstances.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All of them or just crack?\nMR. PINCUS: It was -- \"freebase\" was a\nword. \"Base\" was a word. \"Crack\" was a word. The -\nthe legislative debate didn't distinguish necessarily\nthe chemical -- the chemical process for creating the\nsubstance. What it focused on was a substance that had\ncharacteristics that had led to the epidemic that\nCongress was concerned with, and those characteristics\nwere easy marketability, because it was a solid,\nincredibly strong addictive potential, and inhalability.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, the\nprovision refers to \"a mixture or substance which\ncontains cocaine base.\" You read cocaine base to be\ncrack, so you have to be talking about a mixture or\nsubstance which contains crack. What contains crack?\nCrack is the problem they're getting at; yet the\nstatute, as you read it, has to talk about a substance\nwhich contains crack, not just crack.\nMR. PINCUS: Yes, Your Honor, and we think\nthe reason that Congress used that phrase was often in\nthis reactive process at the end of the day the rock\nwill not be pure cocaine in a rock form. There may be\nsome cocaine hydrochloride that didn't react with the\nbase. There may be -- then there often is some of the\nbase reacting -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's kind of an odd\nway for Congress -- it's an odd way for Congress to\nphrase the provision if what they want to get at is\ncrack, to say what we want to get at is substance which\ncontained crack. That suggests to me, when you talk\nabout substances that contain something, what they\ncontain is a base that then is used in the substance. I\nthink that's a harder, harder logic to apply when you're\ntalking about crack. They want to stop the use of\ncrack, not so much -- it wouldn't occur naturally that\nthey're talking about substances which contain crack.\nIt would occur naturally, that language formulation, if\nyou think of cocaine base as broader than just crack.\nMR. PINCUS: Respectfully, I disagree, Mr.\nChief Justice. The provision just above large Roman\nnumeral IV talks about compounds and mixtures, and\nCongress is sensitive in crafting the drug laws that\noften, because these substances are not prepared in a\nchemistry lab, there are many, many impurities\nassociated with them. For example, even cocaine\nhydrochloride, cocaine powder, is not pure cocaine\nhydrochloride. It's often diluted, it's often cut with\nother impurities. And so in all -- throughout the drug\nlaws Congress has used that and we think that's exactly\nwhy it used a similar phrase here, because the crack\nrock does not contain 100 percent chemical cocaine in a\nrock-like form. There will be cocaine powder often,\ncocaine hydrochloride left. There will be baking soda\nleft or the other reactant, and so it will be a mass of\nsubstances, and Congress needed that language to avoid\ndefendants saying: This substance is not 100 percent\ncocaine in a crack form and therefore I don't qualify\nunder (iii) .\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You kind of elided\nthe point there in your verbal formulation. It's easier\nto say this is something that's not just cocaine. It's\nharder to say this is something which is not just crack\nbecause crack is a type of cocaine. You can say it\ncontains, as the government says, cocaine base.\nMR. PINCUS: I may be missing your point,\nYour Honor, but I think even cocaine in a crack form has\nother -- the rock that Congress was trying to get at has\nother things in it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you're saying\nCongress is afraid that the sodium bicarbonate, we might\nnot be able to get at that if we just say crack?\nMR. PINCUS: No, that the defendant, that\nthe defendant would say this -- if it doesn't, if it\ndidn't say a mixture which contains, if it said cocaine\nbase, then the argument might well be, you have to -\nyou have to distill the substance to find out how much\ncocaine base is actually in it, as opposed to how much\nof it actually is cocaine in a rock form, as opposed to\nother things have been mixed in, instead of, as this\nCourt decided in Chapman, it's the whole package that\none weighs.\nAnd so I think Congress was getting at the\nidea that it didn't want people to either avoid the\nfalling within clause (iii) entirely or trying to\nescape the 50-gram crack threshold by saying there are\nother things in here that you have to take out before\nyou, before you can impose this penalty on me.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Other than crack and free\nbase, are there other forms of cocaine base that are\nactually in use in any substantial amounts in this\ncountry by drug users?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, I think we don't know,\nYour Honor. There are -- certainly cocaine leaves can\nbe in the country, and under the government's definition\nof the statute cocaine leaves would qualify under clause\n(iii) . Cocoa paste -- coca paste can be imported into\nthe country. There are cases like that.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Are there actually people in\nthe United States who are smoking coca, coca paste? I\nthought that that was exclusive to South America.\nMR. PINCUS: They may not be smoking it,\nYour Honor, but they may be bringing it into the country\nin that form and then converting it into -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Are you aware of cases where\nthat's happened?\nMR. PINCUS: There are -- the case that we\npoint to regarding the cocaine that was intermingled in\nluggage and in the fiberglass of a flowerpot are both\ncases where it was not cocaine hydrochloride, it was\ncocaine. So it was either coca paste or some later,\nmore distilled form of chemical cocaine as opposed to\ncocaine hydrochloride, but it was not in a rock form,\nand I think -\nJUSTICE ALITO: To go back to your\ndefinition of crack, just so I'm clear on it, if a\nsubstance -- in the second prong of your definition, if\na substance is tested and chemically it is pure\nC17H21NO4, no trace of sodium bicarbonate, no trace of\nammonium, is it possible for a defendant to be convicted\nand given the crack penalty?\nMR. PINCUS: Yes, it is, Your Honor. There\nare cases applying the sentencing guideline test, which\nis a similar test, in which the courts have said the\nabsence -- I think what you're getting at is if the\nreactant is not present?\nJUSTICE ALITO: That's right. And I don't\nthink -- could you just reiterate what the second prong\nof your test is because I thought -- I was under the\nimpression it required the presence of a reactant.\nMR. PINCUS: It is that it was prepared by\nprocessing sodium hydrochloride with a base or with\nbaking soda or similar reactant.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: That means prepared from the\npowder, in theory -\nMR. PINCUS: Prepared from -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- is that right?\nMR. PINCUS: -- cocaine powder, yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So you need extrinsic\nevidence about how this particular substance was\nprepared in order to satisfy it? If you don't have the\ntrace elements of the reactant, you need evidence that\nthat's how this was made?\nMR. PINCUS: Your Honor, the courts have not\nrequired -- the courts applying the sentencing\nguidelines have said that a chemist can testify based on\nhis knowledge, and they've found the sentencing\nguidelines satisfied, that in his professional opinion\nthat's how this substance was prepared.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Would it be enough for you\nif it had the right chemical definition and it was a\nrock-like substance, just those two things? Would that\nbe enough? If the government could show it has the\nright chemical definition, it's rock-like, it's solid,\ndoes it have to show anything else?\nMR. PINCUS: I think that the element of the\nsentencing guidelines which we're picking up in our\nsecond element, Your Honor, is useful in making clear\nthat this is a substance that was -- went from cocaine\nhydrochloride back to cocaine base, because I think\nthat's one of the -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I'm asking the same kind of\nquestion that Justice Alito is asking, whether the\ngovernment has to show anything particular to\ndemonstrate that it was prepared from powder cocaine.\nMR. PINCUS: I think that the government\ndoesn't have to produce -- doesn't have to make a\nphysical showing. It can -- it is enough for the\ngovernment's chemist -- and there's always a chemist\nthat testifies in these cases -- to say in his opinion\nthat's true.\nI think -- I think as a fallback we would\ncertainly be happy with the definition that just had the\nfirst and the third ingredients in what I've said, but I\nthink the second is important because one of the things\nthat Congress was focused on was the potency of the\ncrack and crack-like substance.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Pincus, you've lost me.\nYou've responded to the Chief Justice when he raised the\nproblem that this has to be not just cocaine base, it\nhas to be a mixture containing cocaine base, you\nresponded to him by saying: Well, crack always has some\nmixture in it; it's never -- it's never pure; and that's\nwhy crack would be covered.\nBut in response to Justice Alito, who asked\nyou what if it's pure, if it's pure cocaine base,\nwithout any admixtures, you said that would still be\ncovered. I mean, both answers can't be right.\nMR. PINCUS: I may have misspoken in my\nresponse to the Chief Justice, Justice Scalia. I\nthought the Chief Justice's question was that the\nformulation of a mixture or substance which contains -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. PINCUS: -- somehow meant that Congress\nwas getting at the chemical, all chemical forms of\ncocaine because -- because that formulation was more\nsympathetic than thinking that it required a rock-like\nsubstance. And in responding to the Chief Justice, all\nI was trying to say was not that it was always true,\nthat there are other things present, but just that it is\noften is true that there are other things present and\nthat Congress's use of the word \"mixture or substance\"\ntherefore was designed to deal with the ordinary case\nwhere other things may well be present and did not want\nto allow defendants to escape by saying this is not 100\npercent cocaine in its chemical form and therefore I'm\nnot covered by clause (iii) .\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel -\nMR. PINCUS: I think the question here is --\nI'm sorry, Your Honor -- is the converse of that\nquestion, which is: But if it is 100 percent cocaine in\nits chemical form in a rock-like state, is that covered\ntoo, and I'm just trying to say: Yes, that's certainly\ncovered, too, but so is the dirtier form of a rock that\nhas other things mixed in.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if it's pulverized? I\ndon't know whether that's possible, but could you grind\nit up so that it's not rock-like anymore, so it's like a\npowder -\nMR. PINCUS: I think -\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- and smoke it after it's\nin that form?\nMR. PINCUS: Your Honor, I think our view -\nthat's one of the reasons that we would say rock-like or\na solid that is otherwise smokeable, to deal with people\nsaying: Oh, if it doesn't have to be a rock I'll\npulverize it. Even if it's tiny little rocks, if it\nstill has the smokeability characteristic, which is what\nCongress was focused on, we think that that would be -\nthat that would be sufficient.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you get cocaine into\na rock form without using a base? Is there some way\nthat the rock type form of cocaine could ever be\nachieved without a use of a base?\nMR. PINCUS: No, I don't believe so, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And coca paste, what can\nyou do with coca paste? Can you make it into powder or\nis it only useable as a -- ultimately for a rock-like\nformation?\nMR. PINCUS: Coca paste is -- is the\nintermediate step for all downline products. Coca\nleaves are mashed up in kerosene and other things and\nthey're -- through a process. They are -- the first\nstep is to convert them into coca paste, which is this\nsort of mushy brown substance with many, many impurities\nin it. It then typically is subject to subsequent\nprocessing which turns it into cocaine hydrochloride,\ncolloquially cocaine powder. And then the way -- the\nway that crack is produced is that cocaine powder is\nturned back, using the process we've been talking about,\ninto chemically cocaine in this rock-like form.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You mentioned leaves\nseveral times, and you talked about that in your -- in\nyour brief. If this were a trial court and we had two\nworld-class chemists, strictly from a chemical\nstandpoint wouldn't they tell you that the cocaine in a\nleaf is in a salt form, not a base form?\nMR. PINCUS: I -- I don't think they would,\nYour Honor. We -- we talk in our -- in our brief, we\ncite a number of studies that have found that cocaine is\npresent in the leaf in both the salt and the chemically\nbasic form, and I -- I think that the study -- we\nexplain in detail why the government study, which is a\nlittle -- the principal study they rely on is about 125\nyears old -- doesn't capture the new learning -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does that depend on the\nage of the leaf or if it's been in the sun or is -\nMR. PINCUS: No, I think it's just -- you\nknow, different leaves have different characteristics.\nThe mix will be different. But -- but as a -- a matter\nof the chemical composition, there will be some cocaine\nin its chemical form and there will be some cocaine salt\nin the leaves, and I -- I think even more important,\nCongress believed that. So -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no, no, no.\nMR. PINCUS: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought that the\nchemists said that it's always a salt. And you -\nMR. PINCUS: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- I thought that was the\ngovernment's position, that it's a salt.\nMR. PINCUS: That is the government's\nposition, Your Honor. But -- but on page -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you ended by saying\noh, sometimes it's a salt.\nMR. PINCUS: Our position is that within the\nleaf, there is both -- there -- both forms coexist in -\nin the natural state; that there is both the salt form\nand the form that is chemically cocaine, and the studies\nthat we cite on pages 9 and 10 and in the footnotes on\nthat page I think were very clear. Early on the\nprocesses for extracting from the leaf made it difficult\nto tell whether the extraction process had made it into\na salt or whether there was actual chemical cocaine in\nthe leaf. More modern processes make clear that there\nare both forms in the leaf. And -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: As a practical matter what\ndifference does it make? Is the government going to be\nprosecuting anybody for possessing coca leaves?\nMR. PINCUS: They say they're not, Your\nHonor. I think the reason it makes a difference is for\nthe interpretation of what Congress meant, because -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think Congress knew\nwhat this chemical debate was all about. I -- I think\nit's very unlikely.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let's assume that the\ngovernment's right and -- or that you're right. And\nthat it's -- no, let's assume the government's right,\nand it is -- no, you say it's base.\nMR. PINCUS: We say it's both.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You say it's both, but it\nincludes base.\nMR. PINCUS: Yes. Both base -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And let's assume you're\nright. So what?\nMR. PINCUS: I think then that would mean\nthat the -- the -- under the government's interpretation\nof the statute, offenses involving leaves, as long as\nthere were more than 50 grams of them, would fall within\nclause III, and that doesn't make any sense.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you just said it's an\nacademic issue because there's not a market for leaves\nor for paste. What Congress was getting at was crack.\nThe judge used the term cocaine base. Assume you are\nright. What should happen? Could you go back to the\njudge and he would then say, well, this is -- the\nchemists testified this is crack?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, we would like\nto go back to the judge, because in this case in fact\nthe chemist didn't testify. The chemist did testify\nthat it was chemically -- it was cocaine in its chemical\nform, but the chemist did not testify: In my experience\nthis is crack, based on looking at lots of samples.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It was -- it was -- the\ntestimony was it was a rock-like substance. What wasn't\nsaid was -- what is it? Bicarbonate, sodium\nbicarbonate, was not mentioned.\nMR. PINCUS: The testimony was there was no\n-- there was no baking soda found, and that there was a\n-- that it was chemically basic. The testimony about\nwhether it was crack or not principally came from the\ninformant in the case and a little bit from an agent who\nalso said that he believed that cocaine powder was\nchunky.\nAnd so we believe we have a fair argument on\nremand, when the district judge looks at the facts, that\nhe will say the government did not meet its burden, even\nthough it's only a preponderance.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the district judge\nwould be the finder, right?\nMR. PINCUS: The district judge would be the\nfinder. Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Because you have no\nApprendi problem?\nMR. PINCUS: Yes.\nI would like to reserve the balance of my\ntime.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nPincus.\nMs. Saharsky.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. SAHARSKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWhether you call it freebase, coca paste or\ncrack, it's the same thing chemically. It is cocaine\nbase, it is smokeable, it has the same effects on the\nuser; and Congress did not limit the statute to one form\nof cocaine base. This Court shouldn't do it, either.\nJust to pick up on some of the -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry, cocaine paste\n-- coca paste is smokeable in its paste form?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Yes, it is smokeable in its\npaste form, and that evidence was before Congress. It's\ncited in our brief.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. Assuming we\naccept the -- the brief of the physicians and\nscientists, they say clearly that coca leaves can be\nchewed, but they are bulky and contain a lot of organic\nmatter in addition to cocaine. I understood their\nscientific explanation to say that coca leaves contain\ncoca -- cocaine.\nI think you've taken the contrary position,\nbut let's assume we accept the sciences answer. What\ndoes that do to your argument?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, of course we don't\nthink that that's right as a scientific matter. But\nprobably more importantly, that's not something that we\ncan prove. We have the world's experts working for the\nDEA on cocaine-related substances. We don't have one of\nthem who would get up in court and say that coca leaves\ncontain cocaine in its base form. We -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you're representing\nthat you will never prosecute someone who possesses coca\nleaves under subdivision (iii)?\nMS. SAHARSKY: The Romanette provision,\nRomanette (iii), which would be the sentencing\nenhancement, we have never applied in any case to coca\nleaves. We have never even had a case where it's been\nan issue. We've never considered it -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And you're representing\nto the Court that you won't?\nMS. SAHARSKY: We don't have a chemist who\nwould testify that. We would not be able to make that\nshowing in court.\nBut perhaps a more important question is\nwhether there was evidence before Congress that the\nprovision in Romanette (iii) would apply to coca leaves,\nand there wasn't. There was evidence before Congress\nabout different base forms of cocaine, that\ndistinguished between the salt form and the base form,\nand it mentioned substances like coca paste, it\nmentioned substances like freebase, and it mentioned\ncrack.\nAnd the important thing in -- in looking at\nthe term that -- that Congress eventually used, cocaine\nbase, is that that came from science. Petitioner says,\nwell, you know, \"base\" was a colloquial term. The\nreason that \"base\" was used is because cocaine is in its\nbase form. That is what makes it smokeable.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: It's a bizarre term, Ms.\nSaharsky. It's -- I mean, cocaine base means the same\nexact same thing as cocaine, because cocaine is a base.\nIt's like referring to an apple by saying \"apple fruit\"\nor referring to a poodle by saying \"poodle dog.\" I\nmean, it's a strange way to speak about it.\nMS. SAHARSKY: It is an extra clear, extra\nprecise way to think -- to speak about it, and we think\nthat there's a good reason that Congress did that. In\nthe preceding provision in Romanette (ii), Congress was\ndefining the whole world of cocaine-related substances.\nSo when it used \"cocaine\" there -- and it does mean\ncocaine base there -- but cocaine, its salt, its optical\nand geometric isomers, it's talking about everything.\nIt didn't need to distinguish between the different\nforms. And that formulation had already existed like\nthat in the Controlled Substances Act.\nBut then in 1986 Congress was hearing\ntestimony about a specific form, the base form of\ncocaine. Did you, at that point -- would one want\nCongress to have just said \"cocaine\" in Romanette (iii)?\nNo, Congress said \"cocaine base\" because it wanted to be\nextra clear.\nThere's another reason -- another -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: It's a strange way to be\nextra clear, to -- to use a different phrase that's\nmeant to mean the same thing as another phrase. To use\ntwo different phrases that are meant to mean the same\nthing is not a very good way of being clear.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, it's really just adding\nthe extra word \"base.\" It's not like they're two\ncompletely different words. It's just the addition of\n\"base\" to be extra clear.\nAnother way to think about it is this: In\n1986, prior to 1986, this Court had decided cases in\nwhich it had said, somewhat imprecisely, that cocaine\nhydrochloride was cocaine. It called it \"cocaine\"\nthroughout its opinion. It didn't make a scientific\nfinding, but that's how the Court referred to cocaine\nhydrochloride, \"cocaine.\" This was in its 1970 decision\nin Turner. It was in its 1985 decision in Montoya de\nHernandez.\nCongress is presumed to know about this\nCourt's decisions. It knew perhaps that courts had used\nthe term \"cocaine\" imprecisely, despite the fact that it\nhas a specific scientific meaning. Congress was going\nto be extra clear and use the term cocaine base.\nAnother -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why did it draft it\nto say \"cocaine salts, et cetera,\" as opposed to\n\"cocaine, comma, its salts, et cetera\"? If it intended\nto differentiate between true cocaine and its byproducts\nlike salts, et cetera, why didn't it just simplify the\nlanguage in Roman numeral number (ii)?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Yes, I think that it does\nthat, Your Honor. I'm looking at page 19 of the\ngovernment's brief. This is -- you know, throughout the\nbriefs, you have Romanette (ii) and Romanette (iii). If\nyou look at Romanette (ii) -- again, I'm on page 19 of\nthe gray brief, but it's in other briefs, too --\nRomanette (ii), Roman (II): \"Cocaine, its salts,\noptical and geometric isomers.\" In Roman (II),\n\"cocaine\" does refer to the base form; \"its salts\"\nrefers to cocaine hydrochloride.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But why would it do\nthat? If it's going to treat cocaine base, which is the\nsame thing as cocaine, differently from cocaine salts,\nwhy doesn't it just say cocaine salts?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, it -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Couldn't -\nMS. SAHARSKY: I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- it say \"cocaine and\nits isomers\" or something? \"Its isomers.\" Why is it\nusing \"cocaine\" in an identical scientific way in Roman\nnumeral number (ii) and in -- in (iv)?\nMS. SAHARSKY: The base form has to be\nsomewhere in Romanette (ii), because the way that\nCongress drafted these two provisions together is that a\nlarge amount of substances are listed in Romanette (ii)\nand then a subset is pulled out in Romanette (iii). And\nRomanette (iii) says, you know, 50 grams or more of a\nmixture of substance described in clause (II) which\ncontains cocaine base. So you need to have something\nthat's described in clause (II) and that would contain\ncocaine base, and that would be the word \"cocaine\" in\nRoman (II). So you couldn't just say \"cocaine salts,\"\nmeaning the hydrochloride form, optical and geometric\nisomers. You need something to get the base form\ninto -- into Roman (II).\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, but you could have -- in\nRomanette (iii), they could have said 50 grams or more\nof a mixture or substance which contains cocaine base,\nperiod. There was no need to have it described in\nclause 2 if there's nothing implied in Romanette (ii)\nthat is not also in Romanette (iii) with respect to\ncocaine.\nOn your submission, it's just bad\ndraftsmanship?\nMS. SAHARSKY: I think that there is a\nredundancy, but I think it is understandable in light of\nthe fact the courts had used the word \"cocaine\" somewhat\nimprecisely. I think it's also understandable in light\nof the fact that Congress was putting an enhanced\npenalty in play, and that if Congress had not been extra\nclear there would be criminal defendants, perhaps like\nPetitioner, coming to court and saying, if Congress had\njust said \"cocaine,\" that that wasn't clear enough.\nIt's true that -- you're right, Justice\nAlito, that Congress could have said: Here's some\nthings in (ii); here's some things in (iii); they don't\noverlap. Congress didn't do that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What is in (ii) now, on\nyour reading, your expansive definition of \"cocaine\nbase\"? What is in Romanette (ii) other than powder?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, there is, in Roman (I),\ncoca leaves, except those from which all of the active\nsubstances have been taken out. In Roman (II), the\nsalts of cocaine, their optical and geometric isomers\nand salts of isomers. You have (III), which is\necgonine, which is a smaller molecule that is part of\nthe cocaine molecule. It was made -- it was used in\npharmaceuticals a while back. It's not something that's\nreally seen in the production process now. And you\nwould have compounds, mixtures, or preparations that\ndon't contain cocaine base.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What about optical and\ngeometric isomers of cocaine? Those -- those fall under\nRomanette (ii), Roman (II), but not under (iii). Are\nthere such things?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Yes. There are optical -\noptical isomers are -- isomers are generally substances\nthat have the same chemical definition, the same -- but\ndifferent spatial arrangements of atoms. Optical\nisomers are nonsuperimposable mirror images, like right\nand left-handed versions of the same molecule. Those\nare -- those are both cocaine base. There is a\nright-handed cocaine base and a left-handed cocaine\nbase. They're both cocaine base. We think that those\nwould be counted within Romanette (iii).\nGeometric isomers, which are never seen, are\nslightly different. They are based on spatial\narrangements where a certain part of the molecule is -\nit is pushed out or pushed up axially or equatorially.\nThey're -- you know, geometric isomers are not seen.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They're all very exotic,\nbut practically, what does the government prosecute\nunder Romanette (ii)? What substances other than -\nMS. SAHARSKY: I would say cocaine\nhydrochloride would be the primary one, which would be\npowder cocaine.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. That's -- so there\nseem to have been a lot of words here, but in practice,\n(ii) is powder and everything else is under (iii)?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, the things that would\nbe under (iii) would be any form of cocaine base: That\nwould be coca paste, freebase, crack, whatever you want\nto call it.\nJust to explain, Justice Ginsburg, why there\nare so many words here: You know, this definition is\ntaken from -- is the same -- the stuff in Romanette\n(ii), this long definition -- from other places in the\nControlled Substances Act. It's taken from Schedule II,\nwhere Congress is defining the whole world of\ncocaine-related substances that are subject to Federal\nlaw, so that's -- that's where all of this comes from.\nThis was something that existed -\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's my understanding here\nthat -- that the problem in this case -- tell me if I'm\nwrong -- is because cocaine can become -- can be a salt.\nPeople sniff it often, I guess, if it's a salt. And\nthat's bad. And then there's a kind that's worse,\nthat's freebase or crack, and that isn't a salt and it\nisn't a poodle and it isn't an acid. It takes a base\nform, right?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so that's why they have\na higher punishment. Then the odd problem is that maybe\na cocaine leaf, but certainly cocaine paste, which are\nmore primitive forms, also have a chemical-based\nsolution, they too. So they've written this statute\nthat sounds like -- that sounds like \"Who's your\nfather's son who's not your brother?\" It takes a long\ntime to figure it out.\nAll right. So would you have an\nobjection -- and I wonder if the other side would have\nan objection -- if what we said this word \"cocaine base\"\nin (iii) means is that it is cocaine in the chemical\nform of a base after it has been processed beyond the\nstage of coca paste? And that's how we read it. That\nwould seem to exempt the things they're most worried\nabout, the paste and the leaves.\nAnd I'm not going to repeat the same stupid\njoke, poodles and fruits, but you see the point. Is\nthere any objection from the point of the government to\ndefine it in that way, or the other side? And why?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Yes. There's an objection on\nbehalf of the government, and there are several reasons\nwhy that's true. The first is there often won't be\nevidence of how the substance was made. Second -\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I don't care how it was\nmade. All we do is test it. Now, all we have to do is\ntest it, and then we look to see if it's a leaf. That\nisn't tough, I don't think. And then we have to look\nand see if it's this yellow stuff that looks like paste,\nand I guess that isn't too tough, either.\nSo those are the only things you have to do.\nYou have to test it, look and see if it's a leaf, look\nand see if it's a paste. Now, even the -- I mean, I say\n\"even.\" I mean, certainly the DEA could do that.\nMS. SAHARSKY: With -- with all respect,\nYour Honor, I -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Certainly they could,\nright?\nMS. SAHARSKY: I just -- I don't think it's\nthat easy.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, that's what I want to\nknow.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Okay. First of all, if you\ntalk about the chemical testing that can occur, DEA\nchemists can tell you if it contains cocaine base or if\nit contains cocaine hydrochloride.\nJUSTICE BREYER: We got that part. Right.\nMS. SAHARSKY: They're not going to start\nmaking guesses about how it was processed. They're just\ngoing to tell you what they can -\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's fine.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But they don't need to do\nthat, Ms. Saharsky. Suppose we just said it needs the\nright chemical definition, and it's rock-like,\nrock-like, crystalline, whatever you want to call it.\nSo it's rock-like. It's not a paste; it's not a leaf;\nit's a rock.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Fine. As soon as the Court\nstarts saying not a paste or rock-like or something like\nthat, you have some problems.\nThe first is, you're basically giving a\nnational uniform roadmap of -- to evasion on behalf of\ndrug traffickers. It doesn't -- crack, for example, or\nthe rock form, doesn't have to be rock-like. You can\ngrind it up in a coffee grinder and make it into a\npowder. It is still smokeable. It is chemically the\nexact same thing.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can you make it in -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I would assume that your\nmajor objection would not be that. Your major objection\nwould be: We're not supposed to be writing a statute,\nwe're supposed to be interpreting one. And there is no\nway to -- to get that out of these words, no way,\nabsolutely no way. Is there?\nMS. SAHARSKY: That is exactly how I should\nhave started, Your Honor.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But this is -- but this is,\nMs. Saharsky, just a strange statute, where you are -\nyour definition creates all kinds of issues about why it\nis that Congress used two different phrases to mean the\nsame thing, and then how it is that if they did use two\ndifferent phrases to mean the same thing, you're\neffectively reading cocaine out of the statute in\nRomanette (ii), right?\nMS. SAHARSKY: No. I think that that's\nbased on a misunderstanding of how the statute works.\nYou need to have \"cocaine\" in Romanette (ii) so that\nwhen Romanette (iii) says something contained in (ii)\nthat contains cocaine base, it is pulling out a\nsubstance that is in (ii). But it's -- it's not a\nredundancy.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, but no, cocaine is the\nsame as cocaine base. So it's like saying -- it's like\nsaying apples, oranges, and bananas cost one dollar;\naforesaid apples cost three dollars. That's a strange\nway to write a statute.\nMS. SAHARSKY: That is how Congress wrote\nthe statute, though. It defined a large amount of\nsubstances and then it pulled out one substance.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But why would it say apples\ncost one dollar in Romanette (ii) if it was going to say\napples cost three dollars in Romanette (iii)?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Because these definitions in\nRomanette (ii) preexisted in other parts of the\nControlled Substances Act, in the definitions section in\n802, in the definitions of controlled substances in\nSection 812. This subseries of definitions, which are\nthe whole world of cocaine-related substances, are used\nseveral places. So Congress pulled them over and it\nused them here too, to define the whole world of\neverything -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is it -\nMS. SAHARSKY: And then it pulled out one\nthing for special treatment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is it not relatively common\nstatutory drafting to include something in an earlier\nsection which is also included in a later section that\nimposes a higher penalty? For example, as I recall from\nmy criminal -- criminal law courses, States have\nstatutes that provide that the taking of a human life,\nhomicide, is -- is punishable by so much; and then it\nsays the taking of a human life with malice aforethought\nis punishable by more.\nNow, does -- does the second include the\nfirst? Of course it does. It includes the first and\nthen something. And it seems to me that's the same\nthing here. It includes the first, the cocaine, but it\nhas to be within a compound mixture of preparation.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Yes, you are 100 percent\ncorrect, and I think that the statutory language makes\nthat clear because it says it has to be a mixture of\nsubstances described in clause (ii).\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then, Ms. Saharsky, you\ndo get the problem that Justice Breyer was trying to\navoid. That is, on your definition this paste, which is\nsupposed to be less addictive, less addictive than\npowder, gets bracketed with crack, which is more\naddictive.\nMS. SAHARSKY: I don't think that there is\nevidence that paste is less addictive than powder. They\ncontain the exact same chemical, which is cocaine in its\nbase form. And the question -- they both can be smoked.\nNow, the question is does one have a higher percentage\npurity of the chemical than the other? Maybe, but that\njust depends on how it was prepared. And there are\ncases in the courts of appeals, several in the cases\nthat gave rise to the circuit split in this case, where\nthe courts appear to be grappling with whether something\nthat was a little bit wet but still rock-like should be\ncalled paste. So -\nJUSTICE BREYER: But you define it in your\nbrief, and this is very interesting to me -- you talk\nabout it being a yellow substance that came directly\nfrom grinding up leaves, something like that. You have\nthe definition there. It's written.\nTake that definition that you wrote, and\nwhat you've said that's very interesting to me that I\nwould like to know, is that, that substance, in some\nsignificant amount of time is actually more addictive,\nmore dangerous than the salt, which is ordinarily\nsniffed? Now, is that what you're saying, because I\nreceived from this material the contrary impression. I\nhad the impression that the yellow paste that comes from\nthe leaf directly is, if anything, less addictive and\nless harmful, if anything, than the salt which you\nsniff. Now, which is it?\nMS. SAHARSKY: It -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Or if -\nMS. SAHARSKY: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Go ahead.\nMS. SAHARSKY: It is the case that the\npaste, just like the freebase and the crack, can be\nsmoked, and for that reason is seen as more addictive\nthan the powder.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So now if I want to find a\ncitation for the authority that paste, yellow, made out\nof leaves is in fact more dangerous and Congress could\nhave thought that than -- more dangerous than ordinary\nsalt sniffed, I will read what? Because that -- that --\nI did have that wrong impression.\nMS. SAHARSKY: You would read our brief\npages 30 to 33 -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what you've referred\nto, in other words. I -- I mean, I trust your brief\nimplicitly, but I don't know on the scientific matter or\nthe congressional. I would like to know what to read on\nthat.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Right. And in -- on these\npages of our brief we're citing evidence that was before\nCongress in the hearings in this case. There were\nstatements by two different authorities who are\nscientists -\nJUSTICE BREYER: What page is that of the\nbrief? You don't have to read it. I'll read it.\nMS. SAHARSKY: No, that's okay. It's right\nhere. It's like 29, 30, 31. There's a Dr. Beck who -\nfrom Yale, who testified specifically about the dangers\nof smoking coca paste.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay, I'll read that.\nThank you.\nMS. SAHARSKY: And one I -- the point I\nreally wanted to make is that, you know, once the court\nsays it has to be pasty, or it has to be yellow, you\nknow, any of those things can be changed. The one thing\nthat can't be changed is the chemical composition. It's\nstill in the base form; it's still deadly; it still can\nbe smoked.\nThe paste doesn't have to be yellow, just\nlike crack doesn't have to be white or off-white. There\nwas evidence that a few years ago there were folks in\nOhio that were coloring crack green for St. Patrick's\nDay. Any of these things can be changed. It doesn't\nhave to be rock-like. It can be ground up to a powder\nand it can be smoked that way.\nBut the important think is that it's the\nsame thing chemically. And I think if you look at the\nControlled Substances Act, not just in this provision,\nbut holistically, what Congress was concerned about was\ndangerous chemicals.\nThis gets back to the point that the Chief\nJustice made, which is the reference in the provision at\nissue here to a \"mixture or substance\" containing\ncocaine base. The thing that Congress looked at was:\nDo you have a substance which may not be 100 percent\npure; it's sold on the street; but does it contain the\ndangerous chemical?\nCongress defines throughout the Controlled\nSubstances Act the things that it was concerned about in\nchemical terms. And that's just not because it was an\neasy way to define things. It does give greater\naccuracy and certainty. But it's because the harms that\nare visited on people, the reason that they are\ncontrolled substances, that they don't have approved\nmedical uses, and that they are extremely addictive, is\nbecause the chemical is inside of them and the chemical\nis dangerous.\nSo whether you get the chemical out of\npaste, whether you get it out of rocks, whether you\ngrind the rocks and make it into a powder, whether you\nfreebase it, it is the same thing.\nAnd just to -- to make sure the Court has\nyou know, some example or some thoughts as to the issues\nthat would be caused if the Court started making up\ndefinitions of crack, you know, a word that doesn't\nappear in the statute and does not have any clear\nmeaning -- you know, Petitioner says it wasn't clear in\n1986, the definition of crack -- I just want to give the\nCourt an example of some of the problems that the -- the\nissues the courts of appeals have confronted.\nIn several courts of appeals there have been\nsubstances which I think perhaps under Justice Breyer's\ndefinition would qualify as paste. The courts didn't\ncall them paste, but in the Bryant case in the Fifth\nCircuit they said there was a brown, soft, mushy wet\nsubstance that contained cocaine base was being brought\nin the United States. The Easter case in the Tenth\nCircuit: a wet gooey, cream-colored substance.\nThose courts are ones that use the chemical\ndefinition of cocaine base, and they said, look, they\ncontain cocaine base, they have the deadly chemicals,\nthey count.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, my understanding of\nhow coke -- how the paste is produced is the following:\nYou start with the leaves; then people vigorously\nmacerate the leaves by stomping on them for an hour or\nmore; and then this mixture is -- this -- what's left is\nmixed with an alkaline material such as sodium\nbicarbonate, an organic solvent, such as kerosene, and\nwater; and what you end up with is a gummy, yellowish\nsolid called coca paste; is that -- that's correct?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Yes, that's true. But it\nalso can be dried. It can -- can be dried and smoked;\nit has been dried in South America, so it's not always\nwet, it's just a question of, you know, whether it has\nhad time to dry or not.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Yes. Now, if a chemist\nanalyzed that or then analyzed crack or freebase,\nwouldn't there be present in the coca paste lots of\nother substances that would not be present, in\nquantities? Other substances would be present in\nquantities in the coca paste that would not be present\nin the crack or the freebase?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, they all -- any of\nthose would have impurities that are not cocaine base.\nAll three of them would be identically -- chemically\nidentical if that they would all contain cocaine base;\nbut you're right; the impurities would be different\nbecause the method of preparation would be different.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So a DEA chemist could test\n-- could test a substance and say this is coca paste of\nthe type that is smoked in South America by some people.\nThis is crack or freebase that has been mixed with water\ninto a pasty substance -- a chemist could make that -\nthat differentiation, couldn't they?\nMS. SAHARSKY: I think it really depends,\nYour Honor. I think if it's just a -- a regular DEA\nchemist, they would be able to tell you what chemicals\nthey can find through standard techniques like infrared\nspectroscopy, like gas chromatography, and they can say\nwe've identified these chemicals in this substance.\nUnless it is a chemist -- and we do have some that have\nadditional knowledge of methods of preparation, DEA\nagents who have that kind of experience, have seen it\nprepared -- those chemists -- regular chemists would not\nbe testifying about how it was prepared.\nFor example in this case the chemist\ntestified that the -- the sample had cocaine base, it\ndid not have detectable amounts of sodium bicarbonate,\nand then defense counsel said well is -- is this -- do\nyou think that it's -- or I'm sorry, the chemist, the\ndefense counsel said -- wanted to -- tried to\ndistinguish it from freebase, and said it's freebase\ncrack; and the chemist said you know, I can't answer\nthose questions. I can tell you scientifically what it\nincludes.\nAnd that -- that's really the -- the issue\nof proof, is that you can tell chemically that it has\nthe substance that Congress was trying to get at, the\ncocaine base. I suppose you can tell what other\nimpurities are there, but you know, Congress doesn't\ncare about the impurities, it cares about the cocaine\nbase; and that's why you know, it says mixture of\nsubstance containing cocaine base.\nYou know, one -- one other thing that I just\nwant to make sure is clear to the Court, is that there\nwas ample testimony before Congress at the time that it\nenacted this provision about the chemistry of this all,\nthat when Congress spoke about cocaine base, it was\nunderstanding that base meant chemically the base form,\nand that again is near the pages I cited to Justice\nBreyer in our brief. But two different scientists, one\nwas the head of the National Institute for Drug Abuse;\nthe other was the -- was a professor at Yale. Both with\nexperience, and they said things like the form of the\ndrug is the freebase, the usual kind of cocaine is a\nsalt. It is cocaine with hydrochloride, it is a salt\nlike sodium chloride. But this has no chloride attached\nto it, it is freebase, which is just plain cocaine.\nSo Congress knew the base form of cocaine is\nwhat would normally be called cocaine. It learned about\nthe science and it used the term cocaine base.\nAnd I take your point, Justice Kagan, some\nof the other Justices: There is perhaps redundancy in\nsaying cocaine base instead of just saying cocaine, but\nwhen Congress in 1986 was faced with a situation where\ncourts, including this Court, had used the term cocaine\nto refer imprecisely to the cocaine hydrochloride form\nand Congress was going to put a mandatory minimum\npenalty in place, Congress had every incentive to be\nextra clear, and that's exactly what we think that\nCongress was doing here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Saharsky, coming back\nto Romanette (iii), you have 50 grams or more of a\nmixture or substance described in clause 2. Doesn't -\nit really doesn't have to be a mixture. It could be\npure, couldn't it? It says \"mixture or substance,\" not\nmixture.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Yes, it could be pure. I\ndon't know that we've seen any cases like that, but it\nis almost always cut with something else.\nSo just to wrap up and be as clear as\npossible, what Congress had intended to do in the\nControlled Substances Act really was to pull out\nchemicals that -- that have certain pharmacological\neffects on people that are dangerous. Congress did that\nby using the term \"cocaine base.\" That is a term that\nis expansive and includes all these kind of forms that\nwe've been talking about today.\nThe lower courts have struggled in trying to\nfigure out whether a substance that's wet, off-white,\nrock-like, paste-like counts as cocaine base. Certainly\nthe Seventh Circuit has had several cases like that. It\nstruggled. If this Court picks just one definition to\nlimit the term \"cocaine base,\" it's really setting up a\nroad to evasion for drug traffickers to change to a\ndifferent form. We hope that this Court won't do that.\nWe just don't think the text supports it. It says\n\"cocaine base\" without any limitation. And this -- we\njust don't think that this -- this Court should be\nadding a limitation based on what it thinks Congress\nmust have intended but didn't say in the text.\nIf the Court has no further questions, the\njudgment below should be affirmed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMr. Pincus, you have four minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PINCUS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nJust a couple of points.\nFirst of all, in response to Justice\nBreyer's question, the 2002 sentencing report where -\nsentencing commission report on this issue, on page 110,\nrecommends to Congress that substances other than crack\nshould be excluded from Clause 3, and I'm quoting,\n\"because they do not present the heightened concerns\nassociated with crack cocaine.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but she says there's\nno way -- and she does cite this professor from Yale and\nso forth, who says if the stuff has the base in it, it\ncan be abused in ways that if it has the salt in it, it\ncan't be abused. That's all we can look at.\nMR. PINCUS: But Your Honor, I -\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's her point. That's\nher point. You can respond to that if you want.\nMR. PINCUS: I think that is her point. But\nI think the question here -- all of these substances are\ncriminalized, and they're all going to be penalized.\nThe question is: What deserves the 100-to-1 sanction?\nThat, to us, means something that Congress was\nespecially concerned about, and certainly, because the\ngovernment agrees that cocaine hydrochloride is only in\n2, something that's worse than cocaine hydrochloride,\nwhich is a pretty bad thing. As Judge Posner said,\nthere's no reason to imagine that Congress meant to\npunish paste more than cocaine hydrochloride.\nJUSTICE BREYER: She says there is a reason.\nIt's because it contains base, and for many years, it\nwas smoked in Latin America and can be smoked here.\nThat's her reason. Now, your response is, it's a bad\nreason?\nMR. PINCUS: Our response is that it is -\nit does not have the potency that crack had. It was\nsmoked here and didn't give rise to the epidemic that\noccurred once crack was created, because that was more\npotent, more marketable, and led to all the evils that\nCongress was trying to get at.\nSecond point: We would be very happy to\naccept your definition.\nThird point, about the statutory language:\nI think the critical question here, as several members\nof the Court have noted, is that \"cocaine\" -- not just\nin Romanette (ii), but throughout the statute -- means\nall chemical forms of cocaine. If that's what Congress\nmeant in (iii), there was no reason to just -- not to\njust say it. The words \"cocaine base\" could have a\nchemical meaning, but the word \"base\" was also in this\ndebate as a word that was being used to describe the\nspecific evil that Congress was aimed at. And so we\nthink, at the worst, there's ambiguity here.\nWe think it's quite clear that by using\nthose different terms, Congress meant something\ndifferent, but at worst, there's ambiguity here. And an\nambiguity, under the rule of lenity, means that the\nclause should be construed narrowly.\nAnd, Justice Scalia, going to your point in\nyour analogy to State law, the problem here is that\neverything that is in clause 2 is in clause 3 under the\ngovernment's interpretation, because clause 2, Roman\n(II), has the word \"cocaine,\" and clause 2, Roman (IV),\nsays any compound mixture or whatever containing\ncocaine. Under the government's theory, that provision\nwill never, ever be invoked, because every offense that\nuses cocaine is sanctionable under 3. And so it's not\nthe situation with -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's the same with homicide\nand murder. Every murder, every murder, is a homicide.\nMR. PINCUS: Yes, but the question here is\nwhether every homicide -- whether every lesser form of\nhomicide is also capital murder. And what the\ngovernment's position means: Every lesser form of\nhomicide, everything that's in (II) that sets up a\npunishment, is also in (III), and we think that's the\nproblem with their interpretation.\nAnd it's why, if it's unclear, as you said\nmaybe it was, then the rule of lenity should apply, and\nCongress can fix it. If Congress meant to include all\nof these other substances, Congress can easily fix the\nstatute. But we think, given the way the statute looks\nright now, that's not possible.\nTwo more -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's assume for the\nsake of a hypothetical that the statute was the same but\nthat things were reversed; that the smaller universe of\nitems was the salt rather than the crack, and so they\nput an enhancement in Roman numeral number (III) for\nsalt rather than crack.\nIs your argument that it's redundant based\non the fact that a larger grouping of the chemicals\nlisted in Roman numeral number (II) is excluded by Roman\nnumeral number (III), so that -- is that the basis of\nyour argument?\nMR. PINCUS: That particular argument would\nstill apply. Our principal argument, if I may answer\nthe question, is that in this -- in the government's\ninterpretation, the word \"cocaine\" and the word \"cocaine\nbase\" -- the phrase \"cocaine base\" have the same\nmeaning. That evil wouldn't be present, and therefore,\nour argument would be harder, but it is present here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\n"
