OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nA fair trial in a fair tribunal is a\nfundamental constitutional right. That means not only\nthe absence of actual bias, but a guarantee against even\nthe probability of an unfair tribunal. In short --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Who says? Have we ever\nheld that?\nMR. OLSON: You have said that in the\nMurchison case and in a number of cases, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A guarantee against even --\nMR. OLSON: Yes, the language of the\nMurchison case specifically says so. The Court said in\nthat case: \"A fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic\nrequirement of due process. Fairness, of course,\nrequires an absence of actual bias in the trial of\ncases, but our system of law has always endeavored to\nprevent even the probability of unfairness.\"\nAnd in that paragraph, the Court goes on --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: \"Has always endeavored.\"\nMR. OLSON: Pardon?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: \"Has always endeavored.\"\n\"Has always endeavored.\"\nMR. OLSON: Yes, but that's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And there are rules in the\nStates that do endeavor to do that.\nMR. OLSON: But the Court has said that\nfrequently, not only the probability of bias, the\nappearance of bias, the likelihood of bias, the inherent\nsuspicion of bias. The Court has repeatedly said that\nin the context -- a series of contexts or cases.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: \"Probability\" is a\nloose term. What -- what percentage is probable --\nMR. OLSON: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you've a 50\npercent chance of bias, a 10 percent chance? Probable\nmeans more than 50?\nMR. OLSON: It's probable cause, Mr. Chief\nJustice. The Court frequently decides questions\ninvolving due process, equal protection, probable cause,\nspeedy trial, on the basis not of mathematical\ncertainty, but in this case where an objective observer\nwould come to the conclusion -- knowing all of the\nfacts, would come to the conclusion that a judge or\njurist would probably be biased against that individual\nor in favor of his opponent, that would be sufficient\nunder the Due Process Clause, we submit. The Court --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Does it mean the same\nthing as likelihood of bias?\nMR. OLSON: The Court -- the Court, Justice\nGinsburg, has used the changes interchangeably. We\nthink the probably -- the \"probable\" standard is the one\nwe would advance to this Court. But the -- but the\nseminal case, the Tumey case, said that even if there\nwas a possibility -- any procedure where there would be\na possible temptation for the judge not to hold the\nbalance nice, clear, and true, would be the standard.\nBut -- and the Aetna -- in the Aetna v. Lavoie case not\nvery many years ago, the Court repeated that standard,\nand that standard has been repeated again and again.\nThe likelihood or the possibility or even the temptation\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you claim that there is\nsuch a temptation here because of gratitude?\nMR. OLSON: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You've been around\nWashington a long time. How far do you think gratitude\ngoes in -- in the general political world?\nMR. OLSON: Well, let me put it this way,\nJustice Scalia. If -- an ordinary person would say that\nit would be very difficult for a judge to hold the\nbalance nice, square, and true when that judge has just\nbeen put on the bench during the pendency of the trial\nof the case by his opponent's contribution of $3 million\nto his election.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but that -- that\nperson contributed money to my election because he\nexpected me to be a fair and impartial judge. And I\nwould be faithful to that contributor only by being a\nfair and impartial judge. That is showing gratitude. I\nshould do what he expected me to do, and I have no\nreason to think he expected me to lie and distort cases\nin order to come out his way. What I expected he wanted\nme to do was to be a good judge, and I'm being faithful\nto him and I'm -- I'm showing my gratitude by -- by\nbeing a good judge.\nMR. OLSON: Well, I would go back to the\nwords of this court in the Tumey case, the seminal case:\n\"Due process is not satisfied by the argument that men\nof highest honor and greatest self-sacrifice could carry\nit out without danger of injustice.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It isn't a matter of honor\nand sacrifice. You talk as though what gratitude\nconsists of is coming out in favor of this fellow, but\nthat is not necessarily what gratitude consists of.\nGratitude consists of performing the way this person\nwould like me to perform. Now, in this case, I will\nacknowledge that you seem to have a contribution based\nupon more. This contributor never even met the judge,\ndid he?\nMR. OLSON: Well, it's not clear. There is\na --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They're certainly not good\nbuddies.\nMR. OLSON: We're not claiming that there is\na basis based on personal relationship, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And his contributions, as I\nunderstand it, were mainly based upon his opposition to\nthe incumbent, who he thought was an activist judge that\n-- that was distorting the tort law of the State, all in\nfavor of the plaintiffs' bar. And if -- if the\ncontribution were to engender any gratitude, it seems to\nme it would simply be that this other candidate would do\nwhat he promised in his campaign and that is not be an\nactivist judge and not distort the tort law of the\nState.\nMR. OLSON: Well, if I can address part of\nthe premise of your question and invite the Court to\nlook at page 188a of the joint appendix. This addresses\nthe point that you just made that he was contributing\nhis money to defeat Justice McGraw as opposed to\nsupporting Justice Benjamin. On page 188a is one of\nthose financial disclosure reports that's required by\nWest Virginia law. It's filed by Mr. Blankenship and it\nsays on that page: \"Expenditures made to support or\noppose,\" and he underlines the word \"support,\" and then\nhe types in the word \"Brent Benjamin.\"\nThen if you'll turn over to page 200a, which\nis the last page of that report, that shows that he\ndirectly spent $508,000 of his own money to support\nJustice Benjamin.\nNow, to the larger part of your point, the\ncontext of this case suggests that, while the appeal was\ngoing to be coming to the -- to the West Virginia\nSupreme Court, Mr. Blankenship, who was the CEO,\nchairman, major stockholder and a -- the prime mover in\nthe case that gave rise to liability in this case,\ndecided to unseat Justice McGraw, who he thought would\nbe unfavorable to him, and elect Justice Benjamin, who\nhe thought would be favorable to him.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if, instead of\nhaving the focus on one, we're dealing with a trade\ngroup that's making the donation. Ten companies form a\ntrade group. Is the judge recused in the case of every\none of those companies?\nMR. OLSON: I think that -- I think the\nanswer probably is not, Chief Justice Roberts, but this\nis, like your cases involving reasonable search and\nseizure, it's going to require an analysis of the\ncomplex of circumstances.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let's just\ntake this case, the same amount of money, except it's\nnot from an individual, not from that individual's\ncompany, but from ten different ones, and divide it up\nby ten.\nMR. OLSON: I think the Court would -- a\nreasonable objective observer knowing all of the facts\nwould not feel that that -- that trade group was not a\nparty to the case, who is not personally involved in\nhaving a personal stake in the election or the outcome\nof that particular case, but may be interested in a\npanoply of cases or judges that approach things in a\ncertain way; that would not give rise to what you're\nconcerned about here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, okay. Now,\nI'm sure you know where I'm going next. What if it's\nfive companies in the trade group? When do you decide\nthat there's a probability? I take it if there are two\ncompanies, under your theory there would be a\nprobability of bias?\nMR. OLSON: If those are the companies that\nare a party to the case, if it's when their case is\npending, if it's a vast magnitude -- the magnitude --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, can I stop you\nright there, \"When their case is pending.\" The Massey\nCompany has a lot of cases pending, so is it only those\ncases that were pending on the day of the election?\nMR. OLSON: No, I think that that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then we\nshouldn't talk about pending cases.\nMR. OLSON: Well, no. I think that that is\n-- I answered your question whether it's only those\ncases. That is a part of the circumstances that would\ngive rise -- you have decided, this Court has decided\nthat the possibility that a $12 benefit, the Tumey case,\nmight ultimately come to the judge is a disqualifying\ninterest. You've decided in the Monroeville case that\nbecause the adjudicator was the mayor of a town who\nmight receive some fines --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that's the\nwhole distinction that your friend on the other side\nmakes. Those cases involve financial interest and the\nrecusal rules are, you know, if you have one share of\nAT&T stock and it's in AT&T, you have to recuse. But\nthis is different. This is a probability of bias, not\nfinancial interest.\nMR. OLSON: Well, I would submit that your\ncases say that when the judge has an interest in the\ncase and that interest leads to the likelihood of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, they don't say that.\nMR. OLSON: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There are only two\ncategories of cases, only two categories. One -- one is\nwhere the judge is almost the aggrieved party in\nconducting contempt proceedings against someone who is\ncontemptuous of that very judge, and the other one is\ncases where the judges have a financial interest.\nThat's far from this broad category of whenever there is\na possibility of bias.\nI was appointed to the bench by Ronald\nReagan. Should I be any -- should I have been any less\ngrateful to Ronald Reagan than -- than the judge here\nwas grateful to the person who spent a lot of money in\nhis election?\nMR. OLSON: Well, let me -- let me answer\nthat. There's more parts, there's more than one part to\nthat question. Let me answer the first part first. The\nCourt hasn't said that there are only two categories of\ndisqualifying bias. I submit the Court has said that\nit's an interest in the outcome. That interest in the\noutcome might be financial --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Two categories are the only\ncategories in which it has applied that.\nMR. OLSON: I respectfully submit, Justice\nScalia, that in the Monroeville case the judge didn't\nhave a personal financial interest. He had what the\nCourt called a partisan interest because the money that\nmight have been assessed in the way of fines might have\ncome to the city. In the Lavoie case, the judge didn't\nhave a direct financial interest. He had an indirect\npotential financial interest. In the Johnson v.\nMississippi case, the judge had been named in an\ninstitutional suit about racial bias and whether juries\nshould be -- those -- there's a panoply of\ncircumstances, all of which add up, Justice Scalia, I\nsubmit, to a situation where a judge is -- a reasonable\nperson would suspect that the judge would have a hard\ntime, in the words of this Court, \"holding the balance\nnice, clear, and true.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Nice, clear, and true. Are\nyou going to tell me why I shouldn't have been grateful\nto Ronald Reagan?\nMR. OLSON: And I was going to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And he had a lot of, a lot\nof issues coming before me while his presidency\ncontinued.\nMR. OLSON: In the first place, there is a\n-- there is a significant difference with respect to the\nframers of the Constitution who gave the members of this\nCourt and the Federal Judiciary life tenure for the very\npurpose of ensuring the independence of the judiciary.\nThere is a separate consideration that this Court has\nmentioned because of the fact that judges and justices\nof this Court cannot be replaced if they feel that they\nmust recuse themselves. There is -- another interest is\ninstitutionally presidents appointing justices all of\nthe time for a variety of reasons, but not to attempt to\naffect the outcome in their case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the\nUnited Mine Workers. If they give a contribution to\nsomebody's campaign, is that judge then recused in every\nlabor case? Or I don't know if they give contributions\nor not, but a group like Mothers Against Drunk Driving,\nbecause they think the other judge is too lenient in DWI\ncases, so they give contributions. Is their preferred\njudge recused in every DWI case?\nMR. OLSON: No, Chief Justice Roberts.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or are those all\nfactors and circumstances we have to look at?\nMR. OLSON: Well, of course they're factors\nand circumstances, but the -- when -- when an individual\nor a group of individuals makes contributions in the\ncontext of elections -- and we are going to have State\nelections of -- of judges. We have them in 40 -- 39\nStates, and there's no sign that those are going to be\ndiscontinued any time soon.\nBut when a group of individuals or an\nindividual is -- is making contributions because they\nthink the jurist is going to be sensitive to -- to the\nrights of criminals or sensitive to the rights of\nvictims of criminals, those are generic concerns that\npeople participating in the electoral process --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, also, if there\nis a big -- a big United Mine Workers case, or not even\nUnited Mine Workers, involving particular union members,\nand the UMW gives large contributions to a judge, that\n-- that judge is recused?\nMR. OLSON: I can't -- I can't rule out a\nsituation where there is a potential litigant who has a\nstake in front of a case. The amounts here have to be\ntaken into consideration, too.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then, my -- my\nquestion in this case is this: In your petition for\ncertiorari you said that, well, by the time you came\nhere you would have a standard for us that we can work\nwith. You know, all of us know, that a ruling in your\nfavor means that law and motion practice will -- could\n-- could change drastically in States all across the\ncountry. Disqualification for bias will now become a --\na part of the pretrial process, and I'm asking you what\nyour standard is.\nYour standard is an unacceptable risk of\nimpropriety or perception of bias, but I -- I need some\nmore specific standards within which to fit this case.\nYou give a general standard, and then we hear about the\namount of the contribution. We hear about the fact that\nit was a contested election, et cetera.\nMR. OLSON: It would be --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But your -- your standard\nof -- of impropriety doesn't, it seems to me, give\nsufficient -- or \"unacceptable risk of bias\" doesn't\ngive sufficient guidance to the courts to implement this\nrule unless it's just -- it's just going to be one case.\nNow, I know the law evolves on a case-by-case system. I\nunderstand that, but it doesn't seem to me that the\nstandard you offer us is specific enough.\nMR. OLSON: Well, there are several answers\nto that. In the first place, the Conference of Chief\nJustices of all of the States of the United States filed\na brief in this case and said that we need a standard\nwith respect to recusals for extraordinary campaign\ncontributions in cases. They also said that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was their standard the same\nas yours? I mean, that's frankly one of the problems in\nthis case. The various amici and -- and you come up\nwith, you know, a wide divergence of standards. And all\nof them say: By the way, these seven factors or five\nfactors or six factors, whatever they say, are not\nexhaustive; There may be others as well.\nMR. OLSON: That's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right?\nMR. OLSON: That's because, Justice Scalia,\nthe -- the jurisprudence of this Court in connection\nwith standards like due process or probable cause or\nspeedy trial or equal protection can't be nailed down\nwith levels of specificity. It would be very inviting\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I want you to articulate\nsome substandards that have -- that are general in\nnature, that apply to this case, substandards that are\nmore specific than the probability of bias.\nMR. OLSON: Well, I -- I -- the reason we --\nwe approached it from that standpoint, Justice Kennedy,\nis the probability of bias is something that this Court\nhas said repeatedly. But let me answer your question\nthis way: When the circumstances, including the timing\nof the contribution, the magnitude and proportion of the\ncontribution, are such that it would lead a reasonable\nperson in possession of all of the facts -- these are\nall words from these courts' decisions -- to believe\nthat the judge would have a difficult time being other\nthan biased in favor of one of the parties, that would\nbe the standard that would be applied. It's a general\nstandard, but --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: To what --\nMR. OLSON: -- the Conference of Chief\nJustices --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: To what extent do you\nrely on -- and this is a very unusual situation -- that\nyou have a defendant in the ongoing litigation who is in\nfact a prime culprit from the point of view of the\nplaintiff? That is, Blankenship, who made all these\ncontributions, is charged with driving Caperton out of\nbusiness. So he is not simply the CEO of the company\nthat's named as the defendant, but he is targeted as the\nperpetrator. So that's an -- an additional factor.\nIs that just one of a laundry list, or is\nthat central to your view that there is really an\nappearance of impropriety here?\nMR. OLSON: It is very much central, but\nit's not exclusively central. If the -- and -- and that\nis absolutely correct, Justice Ginsburg. On pages 63\nthrough 65a of the joint appendix, for example, are the\nspecific post-trial motion findings of the judge saying\nthat the prime mover in the -- in the conduct that was\ndeclared to be fraudulent and a deliberate effort to\ndrive this company out of business was Mr. Blankenship.\nSo factually that's correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel --\nMR. OLSON: That is a central factor. If he\nhad given one dollar --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But not the only central\nfactor.\nMR. OLSON: It's not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You said it's one central\nfactor.\nMR. OLSON: Well, that's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You really have no test\nother than probability of bias. We can't -- we can't\nrun a system on -- on such a vague standard.\nMR. OLSON: I submit, Justice Scalia, you're\ngoing to have to wipe out a lot of jurisprudence from\nthis Court that uses terms like \"appearance of bias,\"\n\"likelihood of bias.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not -- not for situations\nthat have such an infinite variety as -- as the\nappointment of judges and the election of judges and --\nand as funding your opponent or -- or declining to fund\nor joining some agglomeration of -- of other\ninstitutions that fund.\nThe -- the variety is immense, and you give\nus nothing to hang onto except, you know, case by case\nwe're going to have to decide whether there's a\nprobability of bias.\nMR. OLSON: Well, it would be -- it would be\n-- I would be delighted to say that the standard was 50\npercent of the contributions in an election, and we\nwould come along in a case where there would be a very\nsmall amount of money, and someone -- that -- that all\nof those situations are distinguishable.\nI admit this is not easy, but the Conference\nof Chief Justices specifically said, to get back to\nJustice Kennedy's question, what did they propose and\nare they proposing something comparable to us? They are\n-- they are -- and this is on page 4 of the Conference\nof Chief Justices' brief. They are the judges who would\nhave to live with this decision. They said: (A), we\nneed it, extraordinary, out of line campaign support\nfrom a source that has a substantial stake in the\noutcome of the proceedings where those extreme facts\ncreate a probability of actual bias.\nAnd then they go on to say, to answer the\nfloodgate problem that my opponent raises -- this is\ngoing to open the floodgates, and you will have nothing\nbut recusal motions. They explicitly state that concern\nis not -- is unfounded. No bright line rule can or\nshould be attempted. These are the judges --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Don't you think it would be\neasier to solve the problem, as some States have done,\nnot by having this -- this raffle for -- for whatever\njudge gets -- gets stricken from the case or not, but\nsimply limiting the amount of contributions that can be\nmade? Isn't -- isn't that a much more sensible\nsolution?\nMR. OLSON: Well, the States are perfectly\nfree to do that. But let me --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And some of them are doing\nthat.\nMR. OLSON: Let me make this point, Justice\nScalia. The contribution limit in West Virginia is\n$1,000. Mr. Blankenship contributed $1,000, and then he\nput up three million additional dollars, three thousand\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are the States --\nare the States really free to do that? We have\nrecognized First Amendment interests in participating in\nthe electoral process before. I mean, would your\napproach constitutionalize McCain-Feingold at a State\nlevel?\nMR. OLSON: I -- I think that this Court's\n-- this Court's campaign finance jurisprudence\nacknowledges the appropriateness of campaign\ncontribution limits, the very point that Justice Scalia\njust made, and other limits. And in -- and, in fact,\nStates have limits against corporate contributions,\nlimits against union contributions. I think the United\nMine Workers incident came up.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, this -- this\n--\nMR. OLSON: But -- but the -- and -- and the\nStates do have limitations with respect to what\nlitigants can do.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Mr. Olson, the\nvery fact that they do raises what I think is one of the\ndifficult issues in this case, and it's raised by --\nspecifically by the -- the brief of the nine States,\nAlabama and so on. And -- and I would put it this way.\nIt's not exactly the way that brief did, but I see the\nproblem that you are -- that you are addressing as -- as\nnot only a procedural, but certainly to a degree a\nsubstantive due process kind of problem.\nOne of the factors that goes into the\nrecognition of at least a substantive limitation when\nthere has been none before is -- is the issue of timing.\nIs the political process in fact working now toward a\nsolution? Because if it is, that kind of ethos of total\nunreasonability is -- is still being worked out, and --\nand the courts ought to stay their hands. So my\nquestion is, what do you say to the argument that there\nis a political process going on addressing this issue?\nAnd I forget the details, but my recollection is that it\nmay well have been that brief pointed out that the State\nof West Virginia itself has enacted some legislation\nsince these events began to transpire.\nSo the nut of the question is, is\nthe political process in process and is that a good\nreason for us to stay our hand in recognizing a new\nprocedural or substantive due process right at this\npoint?\nMR. OLSON: I think there are -- there are\nmore than one answer to that question. One, the\npolitical process to which you refer is spiraling out of\ncontrol. There is a financial arms race in judicial\nelections in various States throughout the country, and\nthe briefs --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, I think we all\nrecognize that. Is there -- is there a\ncounter-political process going on?\nMR. OLSON: It hasn't done the job so far,\nand the trend seems to be in the opposite direction, but\neven if it --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What happened in West\nVirginia?\nMR. OLSON: Pardon me?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is my recollection correct\nthat West Virginia has, in fact, enacted some kind of\nlimiting legislation?\nMR. OLSON: I believe that is correct, but I\ndon't think that would have addressed the problem in\nthis case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought they closed the\n527 loophole that allowed him to contribute so much\nabove the individual limit.\nMR. OLSON: Irrespective of that, I was\ngoing to go on and answer this in response to Justice\nSouter's question. The Conference of Chief Justices, I\nthink, provide a second answer to that question. They\nare the ones where the rubber meets the road, so to\nspeak. They are saying, and the entire conference is\nsaying, we need some guidance here with respect to a\nconstitutional limit --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, they propose a\nseven-factor test, and all of the other amici, who know\na lot about this subject, propose multifactor tests.\nPublic Citizen has ten factors, the ABA has four\nfactors. In an effort to see if this can be put in more\nconcrete terms, I wonder if you would be willing to say\ncategorically that your -- the holding that you're\nproposing would not apply under any of these situations:\nWhere the judges are appointed, where there are massive\ncontributions and a hotly contested election, but the\nissue is not an economic issue, it's a social issue;\nwhere there isn't any specific issue headed for the\ncourt but there are massive contributions by, let's say,\nthe plaintiffs' bar and the defense bar? Could you say\ncategorically in any of those situations that your rule\nwould not apply?\nMR. OLSON: I would hesitate -- I would\nhesitate to do so, Justice Alito. I think you've put\nyour finger on some of the circumstances that would take\nit out of the context of the appearance of justice for\nsale.\nI'm going to reserve, if I may, the balance\nof my time, but finish with a reference to the principle\nthat we're articulating here is not new to the\njurisprudence of the western world and the legal\njurisprudence that we come from. In the Magna Carta the\nking promised: \"To no one will we sell justice.\" And\nBlackstone repeated that and restated it and stated:\n\"For injury done to every subject, he may take his\nremedy by the course of law and have justice freely\nwithout sale.\"\nThis circumstance in this case involves the\nappearance of judges being bought. Now, we're not\nsaying that there's actual bias because there's actual\n-- as this Court has repeatedly said, that's impossible\nto prove, and that's why the appearance of probability\nof bias is so important to the respect that we need to\nhave for the judicial system.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Frey.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. FREY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nFirst of all, just on the West Virginia\nstatutory amendment, they did, as Justice Scalia\nsuggested, close the 527 loophole and limit\ncontributions by individuals to 527 groups to $1,000\nafter the 2004 election in response to the concern about\nthe amount of money that was being spent through 527\ngroups in that election. So I think this is a situation\nwhere the States are dealing with it legislatively and,\nand as I hope to get to in a minute or two, the Court\nhas recognized that this is -- repeatedly recognized\nthat this is something that is meant to be dealt with\nthrough legislative or canons of judicial ethics or\ncodes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How is it -- is it --\nthis Court's decision in the Republican Party of\nMinnesota said that judges could say anything, just as a\nlegislator. Are you extending that notion that an\nelection is an election to this area of the appearance\nof impropriety? I mean, is it your position that the\njudge is elected just like a legislator is elected, and\nlegislators all the time are beholden to interest\ngroups?\nMR. FREY: Well, of course I don't agree\nthat Justice Benjamin was in the least beholden to\nanybody in this case. But the Republican Party case was\na case about the First Amendment right of candidates in\nan election to speak their position on issues. I'm not\nsure that I follow what this has to do with this case.\nBut I will say that this is not a case about\nappearances. The petition was about appearances.\nThey've -- the other side has withdrawn or it has\nabandoned an appearance argument, and with good reason\nbecause the Due Process Clause --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Frey, is it your\nposition that the appearance of impropriety could never\nbe strong enough to raise a constitutional issue?\nMR. FREY: Well, we might have appearance of\nimpropriety overlapping with conditions that would\njustify --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm assuming appearances\nonly. Are you saying that appearances without any\nactual proof of bias could never be sufficient as a\nconstitutional matter?\nMR. FREY: I think we are.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is that your position?\nMR. FREY: We are saying that the Due\nProcess Clause does not exist to protect the integrity\nor reputation of the State judicial systems.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's not an answer to my\nquestion.\nMR. FREY: Well, I thought I said --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Supposing, for example,\nthe judge had campaigned on the ground that he would\nissue favorable rulings to the United Mine Workers, and\nthe United Mine Workers campaigned, raising money\nsaying, we want to get a judge who will rule in our\nfavor in all the cases we're interested in. Would that\ncreate an appearance of impropriety?\nMR. FREY: Well --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Or take another example.\nThe Chief Justice asked what if there are ten members of\na trade association and would all -- and they all\ncontributed to get a judge to vote in their favor in a\ncase that involved a conspiracy charge among the --\ncharged the ten of them for violations of the Sherman\nAct, something like that. And if all ten of them raise\nmoney publicly for the very purpose of getting a judge\nwho would rule favorably in their favor, that would\nclearly create a very extreme appearance of impropriety.\nWould that be sufficient, in your judgment, to raise a\nconstitutional issue?\nMR. FREY: If you were -- if -- if you\nthought there was no basis for believing there was\nactual bias, but it looked bad --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, it would meet the test\nin the -- in the judges' brief of an average judge would\nbe tempted under the circumstances. That's the test\nthat the Conference of Chief Justices judges --\nMR. FREY: That I don't --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And do you think that\ncould ever, just appearance, could ever raise a due\nprocess issue?\nMR. FREY: No, I don't think just appearance\ncould ever raise a due process issue.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No matter how extreme the\nfacts?\nMR. FREY: The question is whether there is\nactual bias of a kind that is recognized as\ndisqualifying. The Court has recognized --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The whole point of this\ncase is it has not been recognized. We have never\nconfronted a case as extreme as this before. This fits\nthe standard that Potter Stewart articulated when he\nsaid \"I know it when I see it.\"\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FREY: I would take exception to the\ncharacterization of this case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think we adopted\nhis principle, did we, in the obscenity area?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The question is not\nwhether we have, but whether we should.\nMR. FREY: I hope to address that question.\nLet me start off by pointing out, as Justice Benjamin\nsaid in his opinion on discussing the recusal issue, his\nJuly opinion, which I commend to the Court, he is being\nasked to recuse on the basis of activities of a third\nparty over which he had no control, in a case whose\ndisposition offers him no current or future personal\nbenefit, and where he has no personal connection with\nthe parties or their counsel, has expressed no opinion\nabout any of them. He has done nothing that would call\ninto question his objectivity, his impartiality.\nI think that's a very important point.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the view that\nBenjamin should not be the judge of his own cause?\nWasn't -- wasn't it -- it was either Massey, the\ncompany, or Blankenship that brought a 1983 action\ninsisting on that very point, that in recusal matter --\n-\nMR. FREY: Well, that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- it wasn't -- well,\nmaybe you can tell me what that 1983 suit was. It was a\ncharge --\nMR. FREY: Yes, it challenged the procedure.\nThat's not an issue that's before the Court here, and\nour -- our position today is that this Court has\nconsistently allowed recusal matters to be decided by a\n-- the single justice who is challenged. I don't think\nthe Court thinks it's unconstitutional to do that.\nI understand the -- the concerns about\nhaving the judge making the decision about whether\nrecusal is required, but that is not the practice of\nthis Court, and if it's not the practice of this Court I\nfrankly doubt it's unconstitutional.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it was the position\nthat Blankenship took?\nMR. FREY: Well, it was -- no, not\nBlankenship. Massey.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it may not be per se\nunconstitutional, but it is certainly one contributing\nfactor, it seems to me, to the argument that the system\nthat we have depended on up to this point is not working\nvery well.\nMR. FREY: Well, I don't think -- I don't\nthink the system -- I don't -- I don't agree that the\nsystem is not working well. I mean, of course there are\nadjustments --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I -- as I understand\nit, although you never directly, I don't think you ever\ndirectly answered it, I -- I understood you to imply in\nresponse to Justice Stevens that there would be no\nappearance problem that would ever justify a\nconstitutional standard.\nMR. FREY: Yes, but --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And in fact --\nMR. FREY: -- but appearances, but\nappearances -- I don't mean to interrupt you. If I'm --\nsorry.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Go ahead.\nMR. FREY: Appearance is a standard for\nrecusal, a nonconstitutional statutory standard for\nrecusal in virtually every State, so we already have --\nand in the Federal system, so --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. And we have -- and we\nhave an appearance standard under the ABA Canons, but I\nthink it would be difficult to make a very convincing\nargument that that standard was effective in this case.\nMR. FREY: Well, that -- that's a matter of\nopinion. I -- I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it's -- it's the\nmatter of opinion that brings the case before us. And\nwould you agree -- I am not -- I am not asking you to\nagree that the ABA standard was violated. That's not\nwhat you're here for. But would you agree that the ABA\nstandard is certainly implicated by the facts of this\ncase, whatever the ultimate recusal decision should have\nbeen?\nMR. FREY: I think I would agree that\nreasonable people could have a different view one way or\nthe other about whether there is an appearance of\nimpropriety for Justice Benjamin sitting. I would agree\nwith that. I don't think I would go further than that\nbecause my personal view is that there was no\nimpropriety, that it was reasonable, and if you read his\nopinion I think you'll see a -- a fair, balanced,\nthoughtful statement of the reasons why he feels he\ncould sit.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I want you to be able to\nelaborate your full theory of the case, but just so you\nknow, it -- it does seem to me that the appearance\nstandard has -- has much to recommend it. In part it\nmeans that you don't have to inquire into the actual\nbias; it's -- it's more objective. Now, of course it\nhas to be controlled, it has to be precise. But I just\nthought that you know that I -- I do have that\ninclination.\nMR. FREY: But -- but we're here on the\nquestion of constitutional requirements and the\nConstitution --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And we're asking -- we're\nasking what substance we can give to the constitutional\nprotection.\nMR. FREY: Well, what you're really asking\nis whether you should abandon what is a fairly clearly\nstated rule and practice of this Court, dating back to\nthe common law, that questions of bias in general as\nopposed to interest are matters for legislative\nresolution and not for -- not for constitutional --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course the appearance\nstandard is -- is wonderfully ratchetable. Once it is\nclearly established that a certain -- certain set of\nfacts creates the appearance of impropriety, that is\nsolidly established, then the set of facts right next to\nthat suddenly acquires the appearance of impropriety\nbecause it's so -- it's so close to what is obviously\nimproper. And -- and so we go down and down and down.\nAnd I -- I personally don't favor a constitutional rule\nthat is a sliding scale like that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, you can stop at\nwhat is obviously improper.\nMR. FREY: I don't -- I think, first of all,\nthe Petitioner has not advanced on the merits in this\ncase an appearance standard. A lot of the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you please clarify\nthat? Because I was taking appearance, likelihood,\nprobability as all synonyms, and I think of Justice\nMarshall's decision in Peters and Kiff, involving a\ngrand jury, and he said that due process is denied in\ncircumstances creating the likelihood or the appearance\nof bias. And there are other decisions, too, that use\nthose terms interchangeably. So I don't know that\nprobability of bias, likelihood of bias, appearance --\nthat -- those seem to me synonyms.\nMR. FREY: All right. Well, if you're\nviewing them as cinnamons -- synonyms, then the question\nis whether that kind of standard is a -- is the\nconstitutional standard; and let me say about the Tumey\ncase which -- the \"possible temptation\" language in the\nTumey case, which is of course a wide open standard:\nThat was discussed only after the Court said questions\nof bias are not constitutional, they're for the\nlegislature; questions of interest, pecuniary interest\nin the Tumey case, are. And then the language that Mr.\nOlson quoted came in the discussion of the question of\nwhether the pecuniary interest was substantial enough to\ncreate a disqualification, constitutional\ndisqualification.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I think you're quite\nright in the way you describe Tumey, but I wonder why is\nthat the reason -- why is appearance never\nconstitutional? Why should that be? Can you talk about\nthat?\nMR. FREY: Because it seems to me to be --\nif we're talking about appearance as distinct from\nactual bias or probable -- you know, I can understand a\nrule that says the probability of bias is enough. I\nthink it would be a very ill-advised rule without\nhistorical foundation, without foundation in the Court's\nprecedents, and open-ended and creating all kinds of\nproblems; but I can understand that rule. That at least\nis addressed to the right of the party to get a fair\ntrial.\nAppearance is addressed to a different\nthing. It's addressed to the reputation of the judicial\nsystem, which is not, I think, the function of the Due\nProcess Clause to address.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why not?\nMR. FREY: Because I think the Due Process\nClause is concerned with the fairness of the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You don't think the\ncommunity's confidence in the way judges behave is an\nimportant part of due process?\nMR. FREY: No, I think it's -- it may be a\nsystemically important value. But I think as long as\nthe judge is impartial in the -- in the case at hand, I\ndon't think there's a problem.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But our whole system is\ndesigned to ensure confidence in our judgments.\nMR. FREY: Well, I don't -- I think this is\na side point.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And it seems -- it seems\nto me litigants have an entitlement to that under the\nDue Process Clause.\nMR. FREY: Well, I don't think so, but I\ndon't think it -- I don't think it really essentially\nmatters. We're -- we're dealing with a semantical\nquibble here, where the real question is, is possibility\nof bias, a temptation of bias, a subconscious effect\nthat -- even a probability of bias, whatever -- there's\na lot of different standards that have been put\nforward -- is that a constitutional basis for\ndisqualifying a judge, A? B, if it is sometimes a\nconstitutional basis for disqualifying a judge, is it a\nbasis under the debt of gratitude theory? And, C, if\nthe debt of gratitude theory is a viable theory -- for\nreasons I hope to have a minute or two to address, I\nthink it's not viable -- does it apply on the\ncircumstances of this case?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you -- I mean,\nthere were a few recusal motions in this case. Judge, I\nthink it was Matthew, moved to disqualify Judge\nStarcher, and Justice Starcher did indeed recuse\nhimself. He had spoken out against what went on here.\nIf he had refused to recuse after speaking out as he\ndid, would that be compatible with due process, the due\nprocess owed to the Massey Company?\nMR. FREY: That would raise an interesting\nquestion and I think a much closer question than this\ncase, because that would involve the question of whether\n-- there is -- the Court has recognized that where a\njudge is embroiled with a litigant, and has a personal\nanimosity arising out of the relationship with the\nlitigant, that is a -- that is possible ground for\nrecusal. So it's a -- it's a stronger case. I'm not\nsure it's strong enough.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the animosity\nwas directed at Judge Benjamin?\nMR. FREY: No, no. The animosity is\ndirected at Massey and Mr. Blankenship, who were --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So you think the\nConstitution might have been violated if Starcher -- you\nthink due process might have been violated if that judge\nhad remained on the bench?\nMR. FREY: I think it's a closer case. I'm\nnot prepared to say that it would have been violated\neven then.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Frey, you've tried a\ncouple of times to -- to get to your -- your point that,\neven if we assume probability of bias is the standard,\nthe debt of gratitude would not qualify. I'll be candid\nwith -- to say that I don't see why probability of bias\nis necessarily an inappropriate constitutional standard,\nwhether we should adopt it or not. But would you give\nyour argument on why the debt of gratitude could not\nqualify?\nMR. FREY: Of course. I'd be happy to.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Because that may illustrate\nthe point.\nMR. FREY: Let me say just one point about\nprobability of bias, which is conceptually -- the rule\nis quite clear at common law, as the Court knows, that\nthat was not a ground for disqualification of a judge.\nNow --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but I don't know what\ncommon law -- how much help common law is. Common law\ndidn't have elected judges.\nMR. FREY: No, but it had --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Common law did not have\nthis contribution system, which your colleague referred\nto as spiraling out of control.\nMR. FREY: That's the point I wanted to\nmake, that while common law did not have elected judges,\nit had the issue of bias. After all, elected judges are\nnot really the issue here. The issue is not whether\njudges should be elected; the issue is whether --\nwhether there should be disqualification for bias. That\nis an issue that the common law confronted. This is not\nlike some novel situation that has arisen that the\ncommon law didn't deal with.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: We don't deal with an\nabstract setting. We have the setting of elections, of\nelections of judges and millions of dollars spent on\nthem. That's the context in which this case arises.\nMR. FREY: Yes, I understand, and the\nquestion is whether that -- that gives rise to bias. So\nlet's -- let's turn -- let's turn to the question of\nwhether the debt of gratitude theory, which I take it is\nthe principle that would underlie disqualification in\nthe election context --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I don't take it as the\nprinciple, but I take it as an application of the\nprinciple. And I thought if you get to responding to\nthe application, I may understand your position better\non the principle.\nMR. FREY: Debt of gratitude I think is a\nprinciple. You have to ask yourself what is the reason\nwhy somebody would conclude -- why a court would\nconclude that Justice Benjamin is -- is not biased.\nAnd let me say that one of the key elements\nwhich is not mentioned by the other side which is very\nimportant is the presumption of impartiality. It goes\nback to Coke and Blackstone. Judges are clothed with a\npresumption of impartiality. There has to be something\nthat overcomes that presumption. And let me say that, I\nask the Court to ask yourselves if you were in Justice\nBenjamin's situation, do you really think you would be\nincapable of rendering an impartial decision in a case\ninvolving Massey? Because if the answer to that is no,\nif the answer to that is you would not be incapable of\nrendering an unbiased decision, then there's no\njustification for saying that Justice Benjamin would --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you on your\nchallenge to the probability of bias as a standard. Do\nyou think it's an unworkable standard or that even if\nthere is a probability of bias, that should not be\nconstitutionally disqualified?\nMR. FREY: I think it's an unworkable\nstandard, and -- and I ask the Court to look at --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why is it any more\nunworkable than probable cause in a Fourth Amendment\ncase?\nMR. FREY: Well, the Fourth Amendment has\nreasonableness as a standard, and reasonableness is a --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it has probable\ncause as a standard.\nMR. FREY: If there was a standard that said\njudges should recuse themselves when it would be\nreasonable to suppose that there was bias, if the\nConstitution said that, we wouldn't be here today or we\nwould be here arguing about whether --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me get back to the\nquestion. Why is probability in this context any more\ndifficult to figure out than probability in the Fourth\nAmendment context?\nMR. FREY: I'm not --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Or is it?\nMR. FREY: I'm not sure of the answer to\nthat. What I am sure is that if you start down the road\nof debt of gratitude, which I think is the animating\nprinciple if there is going to be a probability of bias.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I'm not -- I'm not\nasking you about debt of gratitude. I'm asking you why\nisn't the probability standard perfectly administerable,\njust as it is in the Fourth Amendment? And surely you\nwould agree --\nMR. FREY: Well, you could --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- that if there is a\nprobability of bias, he ought to get out.\nMR. FREY: You could certainly have a series\nof cases in which you would -- which you would decide\nand provide standards. I think that could be done.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We have no choice with\nregard to the reasonableness standard. We -- it's not a\nstandard we made up.\nMR. FREY: It's in the Constitution.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- as we would have been\nmaking up this one. It's there in the Constitution.\nMR. FREY: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We have to make the most of\nit, do the best we can do with it. But here we're being\nurged to adopt out of nowhere a new standard of\nprobability of bias. That's not in the Constitution,\nand it's perfectly valid to ask, is that a sensible\nstandard?\nMR. FREY: Well, I don't think it's a\nsensible standard, and as --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are you going to finally\nget to discussing the debt of gratitude point?\nMR. FREY: Yes. That's -- yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I've been waiting and\nwaiting.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FREY: I've been trying to get to it,\nbut I was answering Justice Stevens's question.\nThe problem with debt of gratitude is that\nit's not a principle with any reasonable limit. If you\napply it here, if you say there's a debt of gratitude\nhere, then you have the question about all the other\ncircumstances. The plaintiffs' lawyers gave a million\nand a half dollars to Justice McGraw to support his\nreelection. Suppose he had won? What do you do? It's\ntrue that no one individual gave a lot of money, but\nit's -- if you're looking at it in terms of what is the\nprobability of bias, it's at least as great, if not\ngreater than here. The doctors gave $750,000 to\nBenjamin.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But that isn't the only\ntheory. That is, in my own mind -- I don't know if you\nwant to call it \"probability\" or \"possibility,\" you\ndon't manacle a defendant in a courtroom even though\nthis jury may not have been affected. I read the\nopinion Justice Benjamin wrote, it was a very good\nopinion. I sympathized with his problem. Okay? So I'm\nnot talking about him. I'm talking about we don't\nmanacle defendants because many jurors, maybe not this\none, would have been adding affected, and that seems the\nproblem here.\nThe debt of gratitude I think, no, that\nisn't the theory that underlies it, though it may in\npart. It's that you have here the largest amount by a\nfactor, an order of magnitude perhaps, I mean hugely\ngreater than any other contribution given to a judge by\na single person. It doesn't just affect the fast\nthrough gratitude. A normal human being also thinks, if\nI play my cards right, maybe it will be repeated, and\nthey'll want to keep me in office. And we have the fact\nof how it looks, and we don't have a situation where the\nsomething like this is inevitable, where you appoint\njudges. It's inevitable that there will be an\nappointment. I mean, hey, but that isn't true of\nsitting on this kind of case.\nSo we have all those things that make it\nextreme. So what is the problem? If we say there is an\nenvelope that the Due Process Clause doesn't touch, and\nthat envelope is greater, and we touch less, if the\nStates are regulating it themselves. Where they're not\n-- and this is way outside the envelope -- at that point\nthe Due Process Clause comes into play. Now, end of\nopinion. Now, what terrible mess will the Court get\ninto if they write just that?\nMR. FREY: Well, if you have a -- you have\nto have a logical principle. I'm sorry, I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: A logical principle or, I\nthought, if I was mentioning all those things that might\nlead a judge in the future, because of the size, in the\npast, because of the size, in the fact that it's a\nsingle individual, in the fact that there's a case\ncoming up that's likely that the judge will decide --\nall those things that are listed by the chief justices\nin their brief, all those things together make it a\nserious risk that there will be bias, even though an\nindividual might not be. There is a serious risk.\nCall it a \"probability\"; call it an\n\"appearance.\" Use the language that you want, but put\nthem together, and they spell \"mother.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't matter what\nlanguage you use because it's pretty vague anyway --\n\"probability,\" \"likelihood,\" \"appearance\" -- it doesn't\nreally --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Don't you understand what I\nmean? I'm not worried about what you call \"probability\"\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Frey, why don't\nyou take a shot at answering it?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FREY: I don't agree with you, Justice\nBreyer. I think you have to -- you have to have a\nreason. You don't have a decision that's good for this\ncase only. You have to have a decision that's\nprincipled, and when -- and when you ask what is the\nprinciple, what is it that would cause Justice Benjamin\n-- and by the way, let me say that I think if Justice\nBenjamin was moved to do anything, it's to vote against\nMassey or to recuse himself to avoid the controversy\nthat would attend a vote for Massey that he knew was\ngoing to happen. And if you look at page 692 of the\njoint appendix, he actually discusses that problem.\nSo I don't think you can even predict which\nway these circumstances would cause him to go, but I do\nthink you need a principle, and the principle is either\ndebt of gratitude or hope of future benefit.\nAs to the hope of future benefit in this\ncase, that is totally not viable for a couple of\nreasons. One is Justice Benjamin's not running for\nanother eight years.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: How long has Massey been in\nbusiness, eight years?\nMR. FREY: A long time. Sure. A long time.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I mean --\nMR. FREY: But you wouldn't --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If one is going to go into\nthat calculation, one is going to assume that in eight\nyears, there's going to be another three million dollars\nwaiting to be spent.\nMR. FREY: That -- well, there's several\nproblems with that, Justice Souter. The first is\nthere's no more likely to be spent on Justice Benjamin\nthan on any other member of the court who might be\nsympathic.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, one has hopes.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FREY: Excuse me?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: One has hopes.\nMR. FREY: A lot of members of the Court\nwould have the same exact hopes, with another reason,\nthey might be running sooner, they might end up with an\nopponent who is more distasteful to Mr. Blankenship.\nBy the way, Mr. Blankenship is not Massey.\nThey are two separate things.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you say that and I\nsay that because we took corporate law. But in -- in\nterms of my brother a moment ago spoke of we've been\naround Washington for a while, and I don't think that\nfine distinction counts very much on the issue that\nwe've got.\nMR. FREY: But why would -- why would\nBlankenship be more likely to support Benjamin than to\nsupport Justice Davis or justice --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We'll have to see when the\nnext election comes along. An expectation has been\ncreated that if there is an interest, the money will be\nspent, and it seems to me that underlies Justice\nBreyer's analysis just as it does mine.\nMR. FREY: Where that takes you is all the\njudges have to recuse themselves because they all have\nthe possibility of garnering support.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: They all have not had the 3\nmillion.\nMR. FREY: But either you look to the past\nand you look at debt of gratitude, and in our brief we\nhave indicated a number of circumstances where the same\ndebt of gratitude rationale would apply. There are a\nlot of things that led to Benjamin's election, and\nBlankenship's money is not necessarily the main thing at\nall. And if you're looking forward --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but with respect,\nJustice Breyer disassociated his question from debt of\ngratitude. I understand you -- you are arguing against\na debt of gratitude theory, but if I recall his\nquestion, it was not based upon the debt of gratitude\ntheory.\nMR. FREY: Right, but what I'm saying is you\ncan't. If -- if you're looking at -- at where -- where\nwould the bias come from, and I'm assuming now that some\nprobability of bias standard is accepted by the Court,\nand I'm asking where would the bias come from. It\neither would come from a debt of gratitude for past\ncontributions or an expectation of future benefits. If\nit's an expectation of future benefits, it is not\nreasonable to assume that Benjamin has any stronger\nexpectation than other members of the court. So it\nseems to me you're in a position where if he has to\nrecuse, they all have to recuse.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And then debt of\ngratitude -- we keep asking but your time is running\nout, have you said what you need to say on debt of\ngratitude?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm really anxious to hear\nwhat you have to say on debt of gratitude.\nMR. FREY: Well, okay.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FREY: I don't know. Some of the ground\nis covered already by questions during Mr. Olson's\nargument. I think the debt of gratitude cannot be\nlimited consistent with neutral principles to large\nindividual campaign contributions. You have newspaper\nendorsements. Clearly you could have a debt of\ngratitude there. Newspaper could be a party in the\ncase.\nYou have the plaintiff lawyers and the\ndoctors which we've talked about. You have labor unions\ngetting out the vote. You have political figures\nendorsing. And you have appointed judges and -- and to\nsay that there's no -- to say that you're going to carve\nout the gratitude that the judges feel toward the\npresident who appointed them -- I mean, the fact is in\nthe Nixon tapes case, and in Clinton --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Frey, there is\nobviously a difference between appointed judges and\nelected judges. But why do we have to rest on just one\nfactor? The Conference of Chief Justices suggested\ntheir seven factors should be taken into account. Why\nis that totally unworkable? Why does it have to be just\none theory, debt of gratitude and nothing else?\nThey don't -- the chief judges who are\nelected don't think that's the way to do it.\nMR. FREY: I think you're mixing up two\ndifferent things. What is the -- one question is what\nis the wellspring of the bias? Why do we think the\njudge has bias? And the second question is how do we\nmeasure that?\nAnd what I'm saying is if you think that\nJustice Benjamin would be biased in this case, which I\ncertainly don't, and I think his track record has shown\nno bias in favor of Massey, then why would -- why would\nan appointed justice, appointed by a president in a case\nwhere the president's personal interests are at stake\nnot have the same feelings of bias, and yet justices sit\nin those circumstances.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. FREY: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Olson, five\nminutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nJustice Scalia, you mentioned that the words\n\"reasonable search and seizure\" are in the Constitution.\nThe words \"due process\" are in the Constitution, and\nthat is what we're talking about today. This Court has\nrepeatedly said, and I don't think my opponent objects\nor disagrees that due process means a fair trial in a\nfair tribunal.\nSo what are we talking about today? What is\na fair tribunal? He said ask yourself, could you be\nfair if you were in Justice Benjamin's position? That,\nI submit, is not the question, because this Court has\nrepeatedly said actual bias is something that's\nvirtually impossible to prove, the counsel of -- the\nConference of Chief Justices said don't go there. We\ncan't ever determine that.\nAnd so the question is what is -- is someone\nlikely to be biased, likely to be unfair?\nAnd, Justice Kennedy, one of the factors\nthat led us to the conclusion that an objective\nstandard, that a reasonable person knowing all of the\nfacts would probably be biased is language from a number\nof these court -- this Court's decisions, including your\nconcurrence in the Liteky case -- I think it's Liteky,\nL-I-T-E-K-Y -- in which you said the objective observer\nwould entertain reasonable questions about the judge's\nimpartiality.\nNow, that's a case involving section 455 and\nnot the Due Process Clause, but I think the logic with\nrespect to the application of the test and the ability\nof this Court and other courts to apply it, as the\nConference of Chief Justices said they could, is the\nsame.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What is the difference\nbetween this situation and a situation where a justice\nor a judge is appointed by an executive and then hears a\ncase that is of critical importance to the executive?\nMR. OLSON: The -- the -- there's a number\nof questions. In the first place, there's life tenure\nfor federal judges.\nSecondly, was that appointment made --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Specifically if Justice\nBenjamin were term limited, would this case be\ndifferent?\nMR. OLSON: No, I think it wouldn't be\ndifferent because of all the confluence of\ncircumstances. If a detached observer, again to use\nJustice Kennedy's words --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wait, you can't have it\nboth ways. I mean, if your response to the first\nquestion is judges have lifetime tenure, you then can't\nrespond to the second question would it make a\ndifference if he was term limited by saying, no, it\nwouldn't make a difference.\nMR. OLSON: He might be running for another\ncourt, he might need the benefits. This was $3 million\nin a race in which that amounted to more money than\neverybody else collectively put into this race while\nthis case was pending.\nNow, the language that I think is important\nis from the Tumey case, might not a defendant with\nreason say that he would fear he would not get a fair\ntrial. So instead of the question that my opponent\nasks, would you be fair, which is not the standard\nbecause actual bias isn't the test, would there be a\nperception, likelihood, probability appearance of bias,\nto use the language used by this Court over and over\nagain.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about --\nMR. OLSON: Ask yourself this question --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about\nprotective donations? You actually give, not three\nmillion, but a couple hundred thousand to somebody you\ndon't want deciding your case. And it comes up, and you\nsay, you have to recuse yourself because --\nMR. OLSON: As this Court has said, I think,\nin one of the cases that you can't allow a litigant to\ntry to game the system in that way. What I was getting\nto instead of the question --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do you know? I\nmean, are you saying it's going to be clear in every\ncase that the judge is going to rule against the\nparticular entity?\nMR. OLSON: It's not going to be clear in\nevery case, Mr. Chief Justice. It's going to be would a\ndetached observer conclude that a fair and impartial\nhearing would be possible? So instead of the question\nthat Mr. Frey was asking whether you, yourself, could be\n-- I would like to ask you to ask this question. If\nthis was going to be the judge in your case, would you\nthink it would be fair and would it be a fair tribunal\nif the judge in your case was selected with a $3 million\nsubsidy by your opponent?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that a reasonable\nperson that's making that inquiry, is that the standard?\nMR. OLSON: That is the standard that\nthis --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Would a\nreasonable person think it's a ground for recusal if the\nlawyer and the judge were very close friends?\nMR. OLSON: No, I don't think so.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't think so?\nA reasonable person comes up and says I socialize all\nthe time, you know, they were at each other's weddings,\nwhatever it is, we know that that's not a basis for\nrecusal.\nMR. OLSON: Then if it was a basis for a\nrecusal, you would have to be recusing all the time,\nbecause that is a standard that's reasonable question of\nimpartiality is in section 455, it is in many of the\nState codes. The courts handle these decisions all of\nthe time. These are factors, and I think I would go\nback to Justice Stevens' and Justice Breyer's question,\nthis is a situation where there has got to be some\nlimits.\nOur opponents say there's -- bias tribunals\nare not prohibited by the Due Process Clause nor\nprobably biased or the appearance of bias. We think\nthere has to be some constitutional limit.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
