        "content": "(11:05 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument next in Case 08-678, Mohawk Industries v.\nCarpenter.\nMr. Allen.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF RANDALL L. ALLEN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ALLEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nFor well over a century this Court has\nrecognized the importance of the attorney-client\nprivilege. In Hunt v. Blackburn in 1888, the Court\nclearly states that the seal of secrecy upon\ncommunications between client and attorney is founded\nupon the necessity, in the interest of justice, that the\naid and advice of persons having knowledge and skill in\nthe practice of law provide that advice in a manner that\nis safely and readily available and, importantly, free\nfrom the consequences or apprehension of disclosure.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Allen, except for the\nfact that you and I are lawyers, do you really think\nthat the -- that confidentiality right is any more\nimportant to the proper functioning of society than,\nlet's say, the protection of trade secrets? So that in\na case of discovery where the defendant says, if I\nproduce this I would be giving up a trade secret and\nit's not necessary for the case, and the judge says no,\nturn it over -- would there be in your view a right to\ninterlocutory appeal in that case? And if not there,\nthen why here?\nMR. ALLEN: Justice Scalia, there are --\nthere are several answers to the question. Let me\nstart, first, with the -- the issue of the importance of\n-- of the attorney-client privilege as a key and central\nelement of the administration of justice that this Court\nhas recognized, not just with Hunt, but in a number of\ncases since.\nBut the question I think also goes more to\nprong three of Cohen, which is the reviewability\nstandard. In the context of attorney-client privileged\ninformation, once that information is disclosed to your\nadversary, it is disclosed to the last person on earth\nyou might want to see it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The same thing with a trade\nsecret. It is a suit between another company who is a\ncompetitor of yours --\nMR. ALLEN: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the Judge says, turn\nover your trade secret, the formula for Cocoa-Cola, and\nyou say no. No interlocutory appeal, right?\nMR. ALLEN: I think with trade secrets --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or do you say there should\nbe an interlocutory appeal there?\nMR. ALLEN: Your Honor, we do not argue\nthat -- here, that there should be an interlocutory\nappeal for trade secrets. I think the practical\nresolution to the trade secret question is present in\nmost cases of commercial litigation, where the court\nwould provide a protective order limiting access to the\ntrade secret; in other words, limiting access to\ncounsel.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But what if the court\ndoesn't, as Justice Scalia has posited? The court here\ncould do the same thing, depending on the secret being\ndisclosed. It could set up any number of protective\nmechanisms.\nThe issue is broader than that, which is:\nWhy is the public policy of anti-disclosure any more\nimportant in the attorney-client privilege than in the\ntrade secret context?\nMR. ALLEN: Yes, Justice Sotomayor. But,\nwith regard to the attorney-client privilege, first on\nthe issue of the protective order, the protective order\ncannot limit the adversary's counsel from seeing the\ninformation.\nAs I said earlier, I think that's the last\nperson in the world you would want to see. You could\nlimit access to trade secrets to counsel, who could make\nno use of the Coca-Cola formula or -- or Colonel\nSanders' chicken recipe, but -- but the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Ah. Are you sure?\nMR. ALLEN: But -- but the answer to the --\nthe importance question, I think, has to return to the\ncentral and important role that the privilege plays in\nthe administration of justice.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But isn't the role --\nthe central role -- role, is to encourage the frank and\nopen communication between client and attorney? That's\nthe purpose of the rule, isn't it?\nMR. ALLEN: It -- it is the purpose of the\nrule, at least in part, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. If that is\nthe purpose, the very existence of exceptions infringes\nthat purpose. The minute you create an exception, you\nare placing some sort of limitation to the frank and\nopen discussion that you are permitting, so the damage\nis already done.\nThe further disclosure doesn't really serve\nthe purpose -- or help the purpose in any meaningful\nway. The fact that an erroneous decision on\nattorney-client disclosure is not going to stop people\nfrom talking to lawyers if they really need to and they\nare staying within the rules.\nMR. ALLEN: Your Honor, I -- don't think we\nare here to suggest that it would stop people from\ntalking to their lawyers. I think the point is that the\nincremental erosion of the rule is going to lessen the\nvalue of the privilege. At this --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well -- but that's what\nI'm trying to figure out, because you are positing that\nerroneous decisions on disclosures are being made\nroutinely by the lower courts.\nAssuming, as I do, that there are some\nerroneous disclosures, but that that's not necessarily\nthe majority, why is there an incremental erosion\nsignificant enough to overcome our interests in the\nfinality rule?\nMR. ALLEN: Your Honor, I don't think we\nsuggest that -- that erroneous orders on privilege are\noccurring routinely. Certainly, we have suggested they\noccurred in this case and that they happened in other\ncases.\nBut I think the more direct answer to your\nquestion goes to the Court's holding in Upjohn. One of\nthe things that Upjohn points out is that what is\nnecessary -- and I think the Court makes a similar\nobservation in Swidler & Berlin, that one of the things\nthat's necessary for the privilege to have effect is\npredictability.\nIf -- if there is no predictability, then\nyou fall back to the apprehension or the worry of\ndisclosure that is observed in Hunt.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. Let's talk about\npredictability. Once you make an exception for waiver,\nthere is already that limitation. It's not absolute.\nMaybe it can be waived.\nSecondly, you have to worry about a district\ncourt finding it to have been waived, even though it\nreally wasn't. That's another point of doubt.\nAnd, thirdly, you have to worry about the\nSupreme Court affirming a district court that wrongly\nfound it to have been waived because we give, you know,\nweight to the fact-finding of the -- of the district\ncourt.\nOnce you -- once you factor in all of those\nuncertainties, you are not talking about a -- you know,\nabout a fail-safe privilege at all. There are those\ndoubts, and I'm not sure the doubts are increased\nenormously, by simply saying a district court may make a\nmistake without -- without your being able to go up to\nthe court of appeals on that mistake.\nMR. ALLEN: Your Honor, I don't disagree\nthat -- that the rule we search for will not still have\nproblems with the protection of the attorney-client\nprivilege, but I do disagree that it will not\nsignificantly improve the quality of the rules that\ncounsel are -- are designed -- or counsel are -- are\ninstructed to follow.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Allen, you used a\nterm before, and I think you were right in using it --\nyou said, \"interlocutory review,\" but\nCohen v. Beneficial is a narrow exception and it -- the\ntheory is, it is a final judgment. It's not\ninterlocutory.\nAnd, nowadays, the courts have 1292(b).\nThey can certify a question, if they think it's\nsufficiently important and they need an answer, without\npretending that it's a final judgment in the case.\nSo, given 1292(b), shouldn't we be\nparticularly reluctant to extend Cohen v. Beneficial to\ninclude a case of a privilege that maybe was wrongfully\ndenied?\nMR. ALLEN: No, Justice Ginsburg. I don't\nbelieve that you do. I used the term \"interlocutory\"\nonly to refer to the fact that the appeal would take\nplace while the case-in-chief proceeds.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And that's what 1292(b)\nwas meant to deal with.\nMR. ALLEN: I don't think 1292 would --\nwould obtain, in this instance, and I think the -- the\njudge in the district court made this observation\nhimself, although he did not expound on his reasoning.\nIt would appear that the reasoning would be\nthat this -- that a decision in this case is not likely\nto materially advance the ultimate determination of the\nlitigation, so, therefore, I think 1292(b) would not be\napplicable in the ordinary case to a -- to a ruling\nfinding waiver of the attorney-client privilege.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why do you think that\nyour -- that this privilege -- or is it -- more\nimportant than any other privilege? I mean, Justice\nScalia's question and your answer convinced me that you\ncan protect this the same as you can any other trade\nsecret -- any trade secret.\nOf course, you do disclose it to the\nopposing party, but that is also true of any breach of\nany privilege, so husband-wife, priest-penitent,\npsychiatrist and patient. I take all of those are\nprivileged. Do we allow collateral appeals there?\nMR. ALLEN: No, Your Honor, you have not.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, if we don't allow\ncollateral appeals with the husband and wife, with the\npriest and -- and someone in -- you know, confession or\nsomething, I don't -- with a priest, or with a\npsychiatrist who is dealing with a patient, why would we\nallow collateral appeal here?\nMR. ALLEN: Your Honor, first of all, I\ndon't think the issue of those other privileges has, to\nthe best of my knowledge, come before this Court.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But then if we grant your\ncollateral appeal, don't we have to, perhaps, equally\ngrant it in every situation, where a judge arguably\nmakes an erroneous ruling on a question of privilege?\nMR. ALLEN: I don't believe you do, Your\nHonor, and let me say, first of all, the -- the instance\nthat Your Honor points to, where the information would\nbe disclosed to the other party, it's not the other\nparty in this instance, that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's the lawyer.\nMR. ALLEN: -- that you are worried about in\nfirst instance. It is, in fact, the counsel. And --\nand, second of all, I think the importance criteria\nas -- as previously defined in this Court's cases, is a\nmeasure of the importance of the interest that will be\nlost if appeal is not available now.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So it's -- in your opinion,\nit's more important to protect the lawyers, who talk to\nclients, from erroneous rulings, than protect the priest\nor protect the wife or husband or protect the\npsychiatrist who is dealing with a patient?\nNow, that's hard for me to see why. I mean,\nI think lawyers are very important, but it's a little\nhard to see why they are more important than these other\npeople.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What is the use --\nI'm -- I'm sorry if I cut you off.\nBut what is the use by the adversary lawyer\nthat you are worried about? That the lawyer is going to\nused information against your client, correct?\nMR. ALLEN: Correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So there is a remedy.\nAfter final judgment, if the information was disclosed\nerroneously, the court sets aside the judgment, sends it\nback, and says, you can't use it in the future and so\nmake your case without it.\nMR. ALLEN: Your Honor, that -- I apologize.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why isn't that an\neffective remedy for the harm that you are claiming\nexists in the disclosure?\nMR. ALLEN: That is the analysis that the\nEleventh Circuit applied, and I think it was incorrect\nfor the following reasons: First of all, it treats the\nattorney-client privilege as if it is a use privilege,\nas you describe it in your questioning. It is not a use\nprivilege. It's a right to be free from compelled\ndisclosure. So returning to -- to trial is not going to\nundisclose the information that's already --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You have to a right to\nchoose your lawyer and not to be -- and not to be\nrepresented by a -- by a different lawyer, and yet we\ndon't permit that to be interlocutorily appealed.\nMR. ALLEN: That's --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why is this any greater\nin terms of the harm that your client suffers?\nMR. ALLEN: That is correct, Your Honor, but\nin the attorney-client privilege cases, this Court did\nnot find that collateral order jurisdiction did not\nobtain because of the fact that the attorney-client\nprivilege or the attorney-client -- excuse me --\ndisqualification cases were not important. The Court's\nruling was premised upon the fact that that order was\nsufficiently reviewable under prong three of Cohen. So\nit's not -- the decisions were not based on Cohen --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I understand what the\ncourt below did. I'm just following up on your point\nabout the importance of this privilege and why it's\ncritical that it be subject to interlocutory appeal as\nopposed to the final judgment ruling.\nMR. ALLEN: Justice Sotomayor, the -- the\nimportance in this instance is -- is measured against\nthe societal importance or the societal need for\nnon-piecemeal application of the final judgment rule.\nSo when you measure the attorney-client privilege and\nthe role that it plays in the administration of justice\nin ensuring observance with laws against a rule of\nefficiency, in this instance in our view, the\nattorney-client privilege weighs heavier in that\nconsideration.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's not -- it's not a\nrule of efficiency. It's a firm final judgment rule\nthat we have in the Federal system. And we are talking\nabout a narrow exception. The exception was first\ndeclared in Cohen v. Beneficial. The question there was\nsecurity for costs, yes or no? Does that -- that is a\npure question of law. It doesn't depend on the variety\nof factual circumstances. Attorney-client is quite\ndifferent because it can often be fact-bound. It\ndepends upon this particular case.\nCohen v. Beneficial was meant for the kind\nof question that doesn't get you into the facts.\nOtherwise, once you get into -- once it's a fact-bound\nquestion, you are really eroding the final judgment\nrule.\nMR. ALLEN: I understand your question,\nJustice Ginsburg. I think in this instance, the facts\nthat the Court would need to consider are sufficiently\nnarrow that it should not trouble the final judgment\nrule and sufficiently collateral --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you are carving out\nan area, attorney-client privilege, as opposed to the\nkind of situation Cohen v. Beneficial dealt with.\nHere's a rule that a State has. You have to put up\nsecurity for costs before you go ahead with a class\naction. The answer to that is either yes or no, that it\neither requires it or it doesn't require it. No facts\nat all. You just have a class action, you need security\nfor costs.\nMaybe this particular case doesn't involve\nmany facts, but there will be attorney-client privileges\ncases, waiver cases that surely do. So we can't take\nthat category, attorney-client privilege, and equate it\nto what was the kind of question at issue in Cohen.\nMR. ALLEN: I agree, Justice Ginsburg that\nthat was the kind of narrow issue that was at issue\nin -- in Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial. But this Court\nhas considered much more factually intensive cases in\nthe context of qualified immunity or maybe as a better\nexample, the context of the double jeopardy claim such\nas in Abney.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Because those are cases\nthat say your right is not to be tried, your right is\nnot to be exposed to trial at all.\nMR. ALLEN: That is correct, Your Honor. My\nonly point is that the appellate courts are perfectly\ncapable and able to consider the facts that are at issue\nin those cases, and it does not unduly burden the\nappellate process in the context of those type of cases.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask two yes or no\nquestions? One, did you, in fact, ask for a 1292(b)\nright to appeal, make an interlocutory appeal?\nMR. ALLEN: No, Your Honor, we did not.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And the second question\nis, would your rule apply if the decision had gone the\nother way? If they had denied access to the documents,\nwould the other -- would the person seeking discovery\nhave the same right to appeal that you asked for here?\nMR. ALLEN: No, Your Honor, the -- the party\nlosing the claim would not have the same right to\nappeal.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why not?\nMR. ALLEN: I think access to information in\nthe course of discovery does not trigger the same\nimportant interest that orders compelling discovery of\nattorney-client would trigger? So I don't think that\nthey would in any way satisfy that test. And I think,\nin fact, the question presented as designed even by\nRespondent does not capture orders that deny the\ndisclosure of attorney-client privilege information.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Some time ago\nJustice Breyer asked the question of why is this\ndifferent than the other privileges, and I would like\nyour answer to that.\nMR. ALLEN: Justice Breyer, I think that the\nanswer to that question has to focus on the role that\nthe privilege plays in the administration of justice,\nand it's why I went, in response to Justice Sotomayor's\nquestion, why I went to the balancing between the\ninterest of the attorney-client privilege versus the\ninterest of a more rigorous application of the final\njudgment rule.\nSo -- so, while I think it is instructive to\ncompare the privilege to other privileges that the Court\nmay in the future confront, I think the proper analysis\nis to balance that, that rigorous application of the\nfinal judgment rule, to the attorney-client privilege.\nAnd I think in that instance it resolves more quickly.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Allen, one of the\npurposes, one of the -- the underpinnings of\nCohen v. Beneficial is that this kind of question is not\ngoing to come up very often, but attorney-client\nprivilege, once you say that that's open to --\neverything stops while you go to the court of appeals to\nget that. And if you -- and if we hold the way you want\nus to, then a lawyer will be obligated every time she\nthinks that she has a valid claim to the privilege or\nthat it hasn't been waived, she would be obligated to\ntake an appeal which you are urging would be an appeal\nof right.\nMR. ALLEN: Justice Ginsburg, I don't\nbelieve that the attorney would be obligated to take the\nappeal. And I believe that the -- that the facts that\nwe've laid out in our brief with regard to what has\nactually occurred -- we wonder how many appeals might\ntake place. We know how many appeals might take place,\nbecause we have the experience in the Third and the\nNinth and the D.C. Circuits that tell us that in the\n11 years since Ford was decided by Judge Becker in the\nThird Circuit, the opinion by Judge Becker in the Third\nCircuit, that there have been only 11 such cases brought\nup on appeal. So, we have some experience to tell us\nwhat will actually happen.\nBut I don't believe it requires that the\nattorney as a matter of obligation take that appeal.\nThe Court, I believe, dealt with this same issue in the\nBehrens v. Pelletier case, which is a qualified immunity\ncase, where the Court wondered whether or not there were\ngoing to be an increase, a significant increase in\nthe -- the appeals that arose out of -- out of the\nCourt's holding. And the Court observed that the only\nconclusion that could be reached -- and I believe the\nCourt quoted in that opinion the opinion of Judge\nEasterbrook in the Able case in the Seventh Circuit --\nthat the only conclusion that could be drawn is that\nthere was forebearance by the lawyers in taking appeals\nthat they otherwise had the opportunity to take. I\nthink there is no reason to conclude that there would be\na difference in the analysis in -- in the case here.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you -- just so I'm\nclear about your position, are you arguing that all\nissues related to attorney-client, whether they are\nwaiver, crime or fraud, scope of the privilege,\net cetera, that all issues are immediately appealable\nbecause the public interest is the same in all cases\nrelated to the attorney-client privilege, or are you\nwanting us to limit this rule only to the waiver cases?\nMR. ALLEN: Correct, Your Honor. We have\nasked that the Court address, in this instance, the\nquestion presented having to do with only waiver cases.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So -- but your position\nlogically would apply to everything, wouldn't it?\nMR. ALLEN: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Otherwise, how do we\ndistinguish or make a difference in your analysis?\nMR. ALLEN: I think it's certainly -- it\ncertainly should be assumed that if this Court rules in\nour favor, it must conclude that the attorney-client\nprivilege is important. If it concludes that the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No one is doubting its\nimportance. The issue is whether or that importance\noutweighs the finality rule. That's a very different\nthing for you.\nMR. ALLEN: I -- I agree. But -- but in\norder to get to -- to the position we advocate, the\nCourt must pass that threshold and establish importance.\nIf the Court reaches that conclusion it is certainly\nlikely that the importance test in other existence-of-\nprivilege cases, for example, would obtain.\nI -- I don't think that compels the\nconclusion that any case addressing privilege must\ntherefore be permitted collateral order jurisdiction.\nFor example, I believe you recited the crime fraud\nexception in your question. Certainly crime fraud\nexception might present a difficulty with prong two of\nthe Cohen analysis, which has to do with the\nseparability of the issue on appeal for merit. So it\nmay well be that in crime fraud cases there is not\nsufficient separability of the issue from the merits and\ntherefore collateral order jurisdiction would not\nobtain.\nAs I mentioned earlier, I think we are in\nagreement that orders that deny the disclosure of\ninformation would not be immediately appealable. So\nthere are -- there are a number of instances that this\nCourt might find in what I'll call general privilege\ncases that might not obtain, and it's the course that\nthe Court has taken in other sort of general areas of\nlaw. For example, in the attorney disqualification\ncases, the Court started off in Firestone finding that\norders denying disqualification did not satisfy\ncollateral order jurisdiction and it limited its\nholdings to -- to that instance.\nIn Flanagan it took up the question of\nwhether or not collateral order jurisdiction obtained in\ndisqualification cases and criminal cases, and in\nRichardson-Merrell in civil cases. So the Court has\ntraditionally taken, if you will, the facts of the case\npresented to them and limited its rulings to the facts\nof those cases. We suggest that approach in this case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any sensible\nline between an invocation of the privilege, denied, and\na holding that the privilege has been waived? I know in\nyour reply brief you -- you draw some kind of a\ndistinction between waiver of the privilege and the\nexistence of the privilege. I didn't follow it.\nMR. ALLEN: Other than the examples that I\n--- that I just gave, Your Honor, I don't think there is\na principled difference between the finding of\nimportance, and that is -- that is clearly a threshold\nissue. As Court said in Will, it's the -- the -- what\nthe issues ultimately boil down to.\nSo with regard to that issue I -- I agree,\nbut with regard to crime fraud exception or instances\nwhen no disclosure is ordered, another example that I\nthink the Respondent points to in their brief is\ninstances of inadvertent disclosure. Instances of\ninadvertent disclosure would not trigger the -- the\nprejudice element necessary because the -- if you will,\nthe cat is in fact already out of the bag at that point.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There is another. You\nare stressing the importance of the attorney-client\nrelationship, the work of the attorney. Do you extend\nyour position to work product? It's not privileged.\nMR. ALLEN: No, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's certainly --\nit's certainly protected against disclosure.\nMR. ALLEN: We do not extend the -- the rule\nthat we advocate to work product in the -- in the broad\nsense. Certainly there are exceptions within Rule 26 to\nwhen work product can in fact under the right\ncircumstances be disclosed. So we are not embracing the\n-- the work product as a general rule. Certainly the\nmental impressions of client -- of counsel, which is the\nimportant exclusion of the work product doctrine in Rule\n26, we would embrace as a -- as an appropriate\nlimitation on the rule that we are advocating.\nMr. Chief Justice, if there are no further\nquestions, may I reserve the remainder of my time?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Resnik.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JUDITH RESNIK\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. RESNIK: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice,\nmay it please the Court:\nBefore 1997, no circuit held that there was\nappeal as of right for privilege or waiver, and most of\nthe circuits continue that approach. That is the right\napproach because attorney-client privilege cases do not\nfit the parameters of the Cohen appealability and there\nare alternative responses that are available on the\nremedial side. In terms of the Cohen factors, the\nfactor of importance which has just been discussed here,\nthis Court has over the 60 years of some 30 opinions\nrefined the importance test and moved it away from the\nquestions of place, shape of litigation, dynamics of\nlitigation, to a very narrow set of cases in which a\ngovernment is typically a party or a government\nofficial, and there is a very significant either\nconstitutional or statutory question principally of\nimmunity from suit.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will get to that,\nI think, when the government lawyer gets up. But does\nthat distinction make sense to you?\nMS. RESNIK: I think the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Government lawyers\nget the privilege, private lawyers don't?\nMS. RESNIK: As I understand the\ngovernment's position here, it's that ordinary lawyers\ndon't get the privilege in ordinary litigation. The\ngovernment is here to speak to the question of State\nsecrets and particular kinds of particular official\nprivileges, but not to the regular case. And I think\nit's important that we understand from the presence of\nthem that this is a rule that is appropriate for lawyers\non all sides of the fence, because the immediate\navailability of appeal as a right stops in the tracks.\nThe case was decided at the district court in October of\n2007 and, holding aside these proceedings, it was August\nof 2008 when the Eleventh Circuit rejected the mandamus\nand the appeal.\nSo the wisdom of the final judgment rule is\nprecisely because the cost and delay, particularly in\nthe area of discovery and evidentiary privileges, is so\nsignificant given that there are so many of these. And\none of the important --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But we are talking\nabout the central privilege to the maintenance of the\nadversary system which we've determined to be central to\nmaintaining the rule of law. This is not like the other\nprivileges, priest-penitent, other evidentiary\nprivileges, because it is the privilege that allows\nlawyers to protect the interests in those other cases.\nAnd it just seems to me that -- that to allow a single\nruling by a district court judge to undermine the\nprivilege is going to affect people.\nWhat -- I mean, the statement of the lawyer\ncould be, look, you are going to lose this case, and you\nare saying the district court can require the disclosure\nof that without allowing at least a quick trip to the\ncourt of appeals to check it out.\nMS. RESNIK: Well, there are remedies --\nthere are two directions for an answer. One is that in\nall the courts of appeal of the three circuits that have\nthis rule, work product as well as attorney-client\nprivilege is available on appeal in the Third Circuit.\nTrade secrets is available, although the Third Circuit\nhas raised questions given Will v. Hallock and\nCunningham about whether or not this remains a viable\nposition, but trade secrets is available.\nPsychotherapists is appealable, spouse is appealable,\nand nontestifying experts as well. Which is the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That is in the Third\nCircuit.\nMS. RESNIK: Well, the Third, the Ninth and\nthe D.C. together are the three that have opened up the\ndoor, and they have found -- the experience of those\nappellate judges has not found that it is easy to make\nthe distinction among these, and as a consequence there\nis appeal as of right to this entire cluster of cases.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Allen has told us\nthat there are very few cases, in fact 11 cases in I\ndon't know how many years, in the Third Circuit.\nMS. RESNIK: Well, I take to be -- the\ncheerful news is that by and large everyone is getting\nit right at the trial level. But we are looking at the\nquestion -- first of all, one question would be how to\ncount the cases of whether there's these other appeals\nas well.\nBut more importantly, both the law professor\nand judge amici in our brief asked to look at the\npipeline, and there are two levels of the pipeline, or\nthree. One is that in the district courts we try to\nlook at the numbers of instances when trial judges write\nopinions, magistrate and district judges, which is only\nthe tip of that iceberg.\nAs best we can tell, somewhere between 10\nand 30 times a month in Westlaw reports one can find a\nconclusion either upholding or denying disclosure.\nMoreover it's sequential --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it matters\nwhich they do, right? If they are denying disclosure\nthe statistics don't mean much.\nMS. RESNIK: We found about half the cases,\nand the law professors amici and judges amici found\nabout 104, in which in which disclosure was required, in\nthe six-month period. So there is a significant number\nat the trial level that exists in terms of the pipeline.\nIf we go just to the case that is before you, the\nFederal district judge reserved question on a second\nattorney-client privilege question because issuing a\nprotective order on the deposition, there is a related\ncase here and he precluded the lawyers from\nparticipating in it.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I was on the Third Circuit\nfor eight years under this regime. And it didn't seem\nto me that the sky was falling. In fact I can't\nremember any cases, any appeals involving this issue,\nand we had lots of cases of a variety of kinds. So\nmaybe there's -- I don't want to be a witness in this,\nbut you know, convince me that the sky really will fall\nif we were to adopt this.\nMS. RESNIK: I am not going to convince you\nthat the sky is going to fall, but I am going to suggest\nthat the Cohen rule does not apply to these cases not\nonly because the sky isn't going to fall. The empirical\nquestion is there will be more cases for sure and there\nwill be more people with comparable privileges knocking\nat the appellate doors, and they'll be sorting, so that\ngoes to the county. Do we count the cases that knocked\nand you said no to as well as the cases you said yes to.\nThe other case is that the Cohen rule\nrequires a particular kind of importance and a\nparticular kind of severability. In this case, the\ntrial judge said, in fairness, there has been a waiver\nbecause you've injected new issues in the case. In\norder to get to the in fairness waiver injection, you\nhave to know the facts of the case and weigh the waiver\nagainst the other facts in the case.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So the Eleventh Circuit was\nwrong on that issue? Didn't they hold that this was --\nthis was separate from the merits?\nMS. RESNIK: In our view, every one of\nthe -- this case fails the test on all four -- three to\nfour of the Cohen prongs, which is separability and\nconclusiveness or -- or distinct ideas, potentially,\nimportance, and remediability. And therefore, the\nembeddedness here is typical of cases, CrimeStar was an\nexample already mentioned, in which the factual\npredicates are here. In terms of coming back to the\npiecemeals, in this case the trial judge reserved the\nquestion. The lawyers below have asked for a\npre-ruling. The questions to be asked at the deposition\nwill not waive attorney-client privilege. The trial\njudge said, I don't know the answer to that, it hasn't\nbeen fully breached and we don't know what you are going\nto ask. Therefore, in this very case, if the rule were\nthat you could appeal as a right, you could be back in\nthis case twice to the Eleventh Circuit during the\npendency of the case.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Ms. Resnick, can you go\nback and articulate what you see as the rule that we\nhave on what is important enough? Because that is what\nreally is at question. So how would you articulate a\nrule that would apply both to the cases in which we have\ngranted interlocutory appeal and to those that you are\nadvocating we don't. Because it's not just freedom from\nsuits like qualified immunity or double jeopardy. We\nhave granted interlocutory appeal in other cases,\nincluding in the Cohen case.\nMS. RESNIK: Well, Cohen involved the major\nquestion of the application of the Erie principle in\n1949 involving a state -- the right of security for\nexpenses. And I would take Cohen and the Vale case and\nthe drugging case of Sell as instances in which, is the\nlitigant, during the pendency of the case, going to be\neconomically secure or free, or drugged or not drugged,\nas distinct qualities which are all framed in either\nState law or Constitutional premises. If we look over\nthe course of the 60 years, the category is not neat.\nBut the turning point is in 1978 with the Coopers\nopinion which says death knell, which says strategic\ninteractions, the shape of class actions, is not\navailable for appeal as a right.\nIn 1994, one might have thought of the\ndigital case that a contract not to continue by -- just\nsettle would have been within the set, but the Court\nsaid, no, that kind of private contractual interest is\nnot sufficient.\nAnd in 2006, in the Will case, the court\nnarrowed it again by saying the res judicata sequence is\ninsufficient. So in the last decade the Cohen cases\nhave come down to basically qualified immunity or\nConstitutionally-freighted -- structural or almost\nabstract, not interpersonal dynamics of the litigation,\nincluding contractual relationships or evidentiary\nprivileges.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But are you suggesting\nthat -- that Cohen itself wouldn't come out the same way\ntoday if the question of security for costs, whether\nState or Federal, hadn't been settled?\nMS. RESNIK: Well, Cohen predates this --\nthe Congress's creation of 1292(b), which you mentioned\nearlier, Justice Ginsburg. And so what it is looking at\nis, when Cohen was initially decided it opened a window,\nbut in the relationship between Court and Congress, the\njudicial conference went to the Congress and said, We\nneed a broader window, and Congress adopted verbatim in\n1958 the 1292(b) criteria which, clearly, Cohen would\nhave been eligible for or potentially eligible for, and\nthere are attorney-client privilege cases that do go off\nunder 1292(b).\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it is a bit of a\nhurdle, isn't it, since you do have to satisfy the\nmaterially advanced -- the litigation and those other\ncriteria?\nMS. RESNIK: There are a few selective\nwaiver cases. There are a few of these that come up,\nbut you are completely right that it is a hurdle but we\nhave alternatives here as well. As the example of the\n-- once the Federal Court Study Committee suggested we\nneeded more appeal rights after the Coopers case,\nCongress responded by authorizing the Court through its\nrulemaking to provide interlocutory orders as final, and\n23(f) is the next example, which also provides the\nmechanism.\nThe basic point is that there are other\nroutes. The remedial prong of Cohen is amply responded\nto here, because first, internal to the case, there\ncould be protective orders and limited disclosure.\nSecond, you can take the issue and stipulate it against\nyou. Third, you could actually, if you ever did go to\ntrial, not testify. That's the Jackie B. Redman\nscenario. Fourth, you have the after-a-fact appeal.\nFifth, mandamus is available, and there are circuit\ncourts.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that is only in\negregious cases.\nMS. RESNIK: In the extraordinary case there\nis mandamus. There is also certification, and all of\nthese are routes that are filtered. Cohen opens the\ndoor completely.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Are you -- are you arguing\nthat the collateral order door is closed now? That --\nthat nobody else is going to get through that door?\nMS. RESNIK: I can't forecast future cases,\nexcept to say that this Court has repeatedly in the last\ndecade narrowed the door substantially. And I take it\nit has come in relationship to the door opening through\nthe other mechanisms, Congressional carve-ups like the\nClassified Informations Procedure Act, the Congressional\ncarve-up in Catha, and each of those isn't a wide-open\ndoor, but either discretionary or timeframed or limited.\nAnd of course, that goes to the problem that an\ninterlocutory appeal really is interlocutory and stops\neverything, whereas the 23(f) rule says after the court\norder, there's nothing stayed at the district court\nlevel.\nJUSTICE ALITO: An interlocutory appeal\ndoesn't have to stop everything, does it?\nMS. RESNIK: The -- as a rule of filing a\nnotice of appeal with a court of appeal at the -- a\nstatutory rule provision puts the -- stays the district\ncourt activity. That's why 23(f) moderates that rule,\nas I understand it.\nFurther, I wanted to come back to the\nquestion here in terms of importance. Rule 501 and 502\nof the Federal Rules of Evidence, Number 502 has just\nbeen reworked. 501 remains that in some of these the\nexistence of the privilege will arise -- will be a\nquestion of state law. I know of no one of the Erie\ncases in which the interlocutory appellate question\nturns on the question of state law as a predicate, and\nthe D.C. Circuit rule is that it's when there's an\nadverse privilege ruling that you get appeal as a right.\nIt's -- that's the D.C. circuit's rule for -- and\nindeed, it had several of these, not very many, but a\nfew of these cases.\nSo then 502 has just come with the workings\nof the judicial conference and the Congress together,\nand the lawyers, to shape a rule that is very protective\nof inadvertent waiver, protective about its sequential\nimpacts as well, and articulating and Federalizing that\narea of law, as well as providing under 502(a) for -- if\nyou waive in the course of a Federal proceeding, 502\norganizes the way a district court should think about\nit.\nIf there were appeal as a right of waiver\nright now, after this case, then all those 502 cases\ncould come directly, whereas instead a few might get\nhere or not by 1292(b). And again, if it looked like\nthere needed to be a wholesale reworking because of the\nvulnerability of the system, then the Court and\ncommittee working with the lawyers can draft together\nsome revision. But the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The usual way that\nthe district court, after denying the recognition of the\nprivilege, insists that people proceed is, they want the\nlawyer to go to jail. They say, You've got contempt,\nyou can appeal contempt. The district judges, as you've\nmentioned, they want these things to move on and they\ntend not to think that their rulings are in error, and\nthe lawyers are frequently confronted with an extremely\ndifficult choice, of violating what they think is their\nethical obligation or going to jail.\nMS. RESNIK: Well, it is the case that Judge\nWilkinson recently reiterated Judge Friendly's\nsuggestion that -- or commentary that contempt is a\nprovision that is available. And it is a route. But\nwe've found --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And how -- how is it --\nunless the judge cooperates, it has to be criminal\ncontempt. It wouldn't be civil contempt. The judge\nsays, I'm not going to hold you, and --\nMS. RESNIK: What -- we have found that many\ncourts of appeals have responded, precisely because of\neither the draconian nature of criminal contempt or the\npossibility that it won't issue, by looking at some of\nthese cases, in the extraordinary instance, through\nmandamus and there are at least a dozen mandamus --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But mandamus is supposed\n-- not supposed to be a run about the final judgment\nrule, and if -- and if Cohen v. Beneficial is available,\nthen mandamus would not lie, right?\nMS. RESNIK: That is directly -- that is\nexactly correct, yes. It is that the appeal of these\nunappealing groups is because the final judgment rule\nsays even if there is an error and even if it's a very\nimportant error, absent this very narrow category of\ncases that are final through our gloss on Cohen, the\nbasic plan is you wait till the end.\nIn this instance, this district judge, in\nthe related case, certified under 1292(b), the RICO\nquestion that came back -- came up to this Court, it\nalso had a 23(f) appeal in this case.\nSo this is actually a textbook case, if you\nwill, of watching both the pros and cons of\ninterlocutory appellate review, and, in this instance,\nwhat we see is that the district court, here, said this\nis too run-of-the-mill for 1292(b).\nHowever, if you want, cooperating with the\nlawyers, I will -- I will put everything in abeyance, if\nyou want to seek mandamus. And so the district judge\nwas attentive to the lawyers' concerns, moreover because\nthe district judge has put a protective order on related\nmaterials.\nWe have an example of a district judge, who\nis very aware of the parameters of the litigation, and\nthat goes to remedies. We dont' know --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, a protective\norder isn't going to work -- a protective order isn't\ngoing to work at all. You're not going to -- I mean,\nthe lawyers on the other side get the privileged\nmaterial, so they don't care -- I mean, in terms of the\nviability and protection of the privilege, it doesn't\nmatter if the clients get it.\nMS. RESNIK: In -- the -- underlying the\nprivilege is the workings of the system for both private\nordering and for the justice system. The rare instances\nin which a trial judge affirmatively makes a finding of\nwaiver through conduct, in this instance or in some\nother way, are going to not undermine the privilege in\nits initial formation, and the final judgment rule has\nsaid, repeatedly, We could get it wrong on class action\ncertification. We could get it wrong on attorney\ndisqualification.\nNevertheless, the costs of the final\njudgment rule are so substantial --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the -- you\nknow, the -- the American Bar Association has said the\nexact opposite. It will say that the opening up of the\nprivilege and the disclosure, however rare the case is,\nwill, in fact, undermine the -- the value of the\nprivilege.\nMS. RESNIK: I appreciate -- and before you\non amici, on both sides, are people deeply committed to\nthe administration of justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, sure, the other\npeople are, too, but we -- I, at least, look at a brief\nof the American Bar Association and view that as a\nrepresentation of how the people affected here, the\nlawyers, view the value of the privilege and what will\nhappen to it.\nMS. RESNIK: And I believe that the judges\nand lawyers and law professors, who have written to you\non the other side, are committed to understanding that\nthe privilege is important instrumentally. The trial --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, but the law --\nthe law professors aren't the ones who deal with this\nquestion on a day-to-day basis and have to worry about\ngoing to jail, if they want to protect their client's --\nwhat they view as their ethical obligations.\nMS. RESNIK: There are many provisions short\nof going to jail, and, furthermore, I want to come back\nto the -- to the rule, the limited --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it's only going to\njail that gives you criminal intent.\nMS. RESNIK: Yes. It is.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's immediately\nappealable.\nMS. RESNIK: And the -- the underlying\ninsight of Cohen, is that there are many instances when\ndramatic events occur in the dynamics of trial, but the\nCongress has concluded that the final judgment rule\nrequires waiting till you get to the end.\nAnd in the instances -- contempt, as\nstanding here as an alternative around that rule, as is\nmandamus, as is 1292(b), are small windows, not for the\nregular course of events.\nThe empiric suggests that, by and large,\npeople are getting it right, but there will a lot of\nrequests for review and the strategic dimension, which\nis what the attorney-client privilege and the class\naction holdings in Cohen are about, will invite more of\nthe strategic play, so that, in the plea from the judges\nwho also participated in the amicus --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is the attorney-client\nclaim sometimes raised, along with a host of other\ndiscovery issues, as a bargaining chip?\nMS. RESNIK: These are packages that -- yes,\nthe attorney-client privilege -- and this is granular\nwork by district and magistrate judges of -- of hundreds\nof thousands of pieces of paper.\nIt could go, piecemeal, to the court of\nappeals more than one time and it can also come up, even\nat trial, interrupting a trial. So we could watch the\nsequence of a frequent, repetitious return back and\nforth to the court of appeals on this kind of privilege\nand, potentially, on other kinds of privileges.\nThank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMr. Kneedler?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court. In the last 15 years, this Court, in\napplying the principles of Cohen, has repeatedly\nstressed that a necessary requirement is that the order\ninvolved and the issues implicated be important and,\nparticularly, that the issues be so important as to\noutweigh the values served by the important and usual\nrule of a final judgment requirement.\nIn our view, the denial of an assertion of\nattorney-client privilege in an individual case does not\nrise to that level and to the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, except when\nthe government is the one raising it.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. We do not -- we -- to be\nclear, we are not asserting that an -- that an assertion\nof attorney-client privilege by the government is -- is\nimmediately --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but, in the\ngovernment context, what would be in the private\ncontext, an attorney-client privilege, is redressed as a\ndifferent type of governmental privilege.\nWhen you give advice to a government agency,\nyou don't call that the attorney-client privilege. You\ncall it a governmental privilege, a deliberative\nprivilege, all these other things.\nIn the private sector, when you are an\nattorney and you give advice to a client, you can't say,\nThis has got something. It's the attorney-client\nprivilege.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Let me also stress, we are\nnot arguing that a denial of the assertion of the\ndeliberative process privilege is immediately\nappealable.\nOur -- the -- the submission that we make in\nthe latter part of our brief, and that we urge the Court\nnot to foreclose here, is the Presidential\ncommunications privilege, which applies to\ncommunications involving the President or his top\nadvisors.\nAnd we also say that the State secrets\nprivilege raises similar concerns. Both of those serve\nfunctions of constitutional significance. We do not\nmake the same claim about -- about the general\ngovernment privilege for deliberative process.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you are saying\nthat you -- government lawyers cannot seek an\ninterlocutory appeal of any privilege claimed, other\nthan Presidential communications and State secrets?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I don't want to rule out the\npossibility that there could be a statutory privilege of\nsome -- of some particular sort --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you could -- you\ncould seek an interlocutory appeal under 1292(b).\nMR. KNEEDLER: That -- that would be -- that\nwould be available in an appropriate case. There are\nthe -- there are the limitations. We trust that a court\nwould -- would grant that, but these -- these are\ninterests of the highest order.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. There\nare problems with 1292(b). Are you telling me, when\nyour office writes a letter to the Department of\nInterior and says, Look, we are not going to appeal --\nwe will appeal your case, but we think you have got a\nreally bad case, you are likely to lose; and you\nassert -- the only privilege you can assert is the\nattorney-client privilege, and, if a district judge\nsays, that's not covered, for one reason or another,\nyou -- you don't get an interlocutory appeal?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. Not -- we don't get an\ninterlocutory appeal under -- under 1291. No. We are\nnot arguing for that -- for that position. And, for the\ntwo particular privileges that -- that we have\nidentified in our -- in our brief, it is possible that\n1292(b) certification would be granted by the -- by the\nCourt, but it is also possible that it would not.\nAnd I -- I would like to -- I would like to\nidentify -- and I think Justice Sotomayor asked about --\nabout a test for importance, and the Court, in its\nrecent decision in Will, tried to summarize what -- what\nit has been driving at over the last 15 years on this\nimportance prong and whether the importance outweighs\nthe -- the final judgment values.\nAnd what the Court said there is that there\nhas -- that the denial of an immediate appeal has to\nundermine -- let me -- let me quote -- \"has to undermine\nsome particular value of high order.\"\nAnd then the Court identified the things\nthat have fallen into that category. It mentioned\nseparation of powers. The Court mentioned disruption of\ngovernment operations through the denial of qualified\nimmunity, and I would add the denial of statutory\nimmunity under the Westfall Act to that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't think that\nthe attorney-client privileges rises to the level of who\ngets to -- who has to put up security for costs that was\nan issue in Cohen?\nMR. KNEEDLER: We -- I think the -- I do\nnot. And I think the problem is that the denial of\nattorney-client privilege is tied up with discovery of\nthe sort that happens every day in Federal Court. It's\nbound up with -- with discovery plans, that --\nobjections on relevance, materiality, various -- various\nprivileges.\nOne of the important values served by the\nfinal judgment rule is that the conduct of -- of\ndistrict court proceedings like that is committed to the\njudgment and discretion of the district court, and if a\ndisappointed litigant could automatically run to the\ncourt of appeals that undermines the ability of the\ndistrict court judge to manage the day-to-day --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We are not talking\nabout -- I guess what, perhaps, the case comes down to\nis, if you think the attorney-client privilege is like\nevery other evidentiary privilege that you have just\nlisted, relevance, materiality, all those sorts of\nthings, or if you think the attorney-client privilege is\ndifferent, even more important than who has to post\nsecurity for costs, because it is central to the rule of\nlaw, because it is central to how the adversary system\nfunctions.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think the more precise\nquestion, Mr. Chief Justice, is whether the -- the\nquestion is whether the denial of an attorney-client\nprivilege threatens to -- so substantially undermine the\nvalues of the privilege to warrant an immediate appeal,\nand I think, as has been pointed out by several of the\nJustices here, there are -- there are exceptions to the\nprivilege, which -- which will -- might undermine the\nconfidence people might have in it. There are\nuncertainties at trial. These are often fact-based\ndeterminations that would be subject to clearly\nerroneous review on appeal. The very sorts of reasons\nwhy issues like this are committed to the district\ncourt's discretion and reviewed on final judgment when\nyou can find out whether the error actually made a\ndifference on a particular case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the review -- I\nfollow your answer but the review on final judgment is\nmeaningless. I mean, the cat is out of the bag.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, it's not entirely\nmeaningless. It can -- if the evidence was used in the\ntrial and had -- had a substantial impact you can have a\nreversal of the judgment, and -- and the -- the injury\ncan be mitigated by saying that the -- that the evidence\ncannot be -- cannot be used in the retrial. That is\nnot --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The injury to the\nparty, but not the injury to the attorney-client\nprivilege.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, again, the -- the\nquestion is -- the attorney/client privilege is not for\ncompetence in its own right but to encourage frank\ncommunications in order to promote litigation in the\nfunction of lawyers. And the question is whether the\ndenial of a privilege in a particular case will so\nundermine that privilege as a general matter to warrant\nan immediate appeal. And we think the answer is clearly\nno. And also the loss of the privilege to the\nindividual litigant we think is not a sufficient basis,\nbecause the other cases that I mentioned, and that the\nCourt identified in Will are situations where the injury\ntranscends the particular case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler, I think I\nhave this right, but correct me if I am wrong. I\nthought in Cohen v. Beneficial, it wasn't just a\nquestion that we would like to get this legal question\nsettled, but, in fact, for many plaintiffs if security\nfor costs was something that the Plaintiff has to put up\nup front, that would be the end of the lawsuit. It\nwould be the practical end of the lawsuit. Unlike in an\nattorney-client privilege, the suit goes on.\nSo Cohen v. Beneficial wasn't simply that\nthis was an important question unsettled under Erie, it\nis the practical reality that plaintiffs who had to put\nup security costs would be out of --\nMR. KNEEDLER: That's -- that's a very\nimportant -- that's a very important point. And I think\nthat --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, Mr. Kneedler, is true\nthat true, that the case goes on? Isn't it true that of\nthe civil cases that get through discovery, only a tiny\npercentage ever come to an appealable final judgment?\nThe vast, vast majority of these things are settled, are\nthey not?\nMR. KNEEDLER: They are. And I -- I -- I\nthink that supports the point for not having immediate\nappealable --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Right, because there never\ncould be an appeal.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, but the --\nJUSTICE ALITO: It means that the\nerroneous -- if there was an erroneous ruling, it's\nbuilt into the -- it's irretrievably built into -- well\nnot irretrievably, but powerfully built into the\nbargaining --\nMR. KNEEDLER: But that's the nature of\ntrial proceedings and discovery. Judges may make\nerroneous rulings. And this Court, again, acknowledged\nin Will that the purpose of the final judgment rule is\nno to protect -- prevent particular injustices that\nmight happen in a particular case. Again, to go back to\nwhat the Court has stressed, there has to be a -- a -- a\nvalue, and the Court said constitutional or statutory or\nsomething with a large public pedigree where the --\nwhere the injury will -- will not be -- where the\nweighing of the costs and benefits comes out quite\ndifferently.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If the privilege were in a\nstatute, that would make a difference?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I don't think so if there was\na statute that just codified the -- the privileges like\nthis. What I -- what I -- what I was suggesting is\nthere might be a statute that would identify a\nparticular governmental interest as in the D.C.\nCircuit's decision in the -- in the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Putting aside the\nquestion of whether the attorney-client privilege has a\ngood pedigree in public law, my experience has been that\nlitigants on one side frequently request and demand in\ndiscovery material that they know is covered by the\nattorney-client privilege, one, precisely because that's\nwhere the good stuff is; and two, because it gives them\nleverage, because they know that the other side is going\nto have to go through this impossible process and can't\nget an immediate appeal.\nWhy isn't that a concern that we should\nhave?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think and that's a --\ndistrict judges are -- are -- who manage these cases\nevery day can see through that, and -- and -- and can be\ntrusted to, by and large, make correct results. It may\nbe that there will be an occasional erroneous\ndetermination. But, again, as for privileges generally,\nthat's -- that's so.\nI did want to make one final point about --\nabout irreparable injury. For the sorts of privileges\nthat we have identified in -- in our brief, the -- the\npresidential communications privilege and whatnot,\nthat -- that harm is immediate and broad on behalf of\nthe nation as a whole. That is a different question\nfrom the harm to a particular litigant when a privilege\nis denied in a particular case and it doesn't undermine\nthe broader purposes of the privilege.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Kneedler.\nMr. Allen, you have four minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RANDALL L. ALLEN\nON BEHALF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ALLEN: I would like to address the\nquestion that Justice Alito raised with regard to\nwhether or not an appeal of a collateral issue dealing\nwith waiver or privilege would stay the litigation. The\nanswer is it does not. The case remains with the\ndistrict court, the district court is empowered to\nmanage the case. Only the question addressing the issue\nwould go up with collateral order jurisdiction. Indeed,\nin this case, the court did not stay the litigation\nbelow. So, the court maintains that ability to manage\nits own docket. To be sure --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It certainly doesn't go\nahead with the trial, does it?\nMR. ALLEN: He has not gone ahead with the\ntrial.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It never would, would it?\nMR. ALLEN: He is certainly empowered to do\nso.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, just go ahead with\ntrial while a material issue is still pending, I can't\nimagine that.\nMR. ALLEN: Your Honor, the scenario that\nyou raise would put the attorney or the client,\ndepending on who is in the box, if you will, to some\nhard choices. But there are two ways that the case\nstays: Either the district court has to order that the\ncase stays or on appeal the court of appeals has to\norder that the case stays. The parties and their\ncounsel cannot stay the case.\nSo, I agree with you that it could be a\ndifficult situation for the parties.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I can't imagine a judge\ngoing to trial in a case when an important issue like\nthis is pending on appeal. Has that ever happened?\nMR. ALLEN: I am unaware that it has -- it\nhas ever happened, Your Honor, and I hope it doesn't.\nBut the -- but point is that the district court\nmaintains that power and authority to run -- to run its\ncourtroom.\nThe United States cites Will for the\nproposition that -- that the collateral order doctrine\nis designed to impact some particular value of high\norder, and it recites from Will a number of those\nparticular values of high order, including qualified\nimmunity. As this Court recognized in -- in Harlow,\na -- a doctrine of common law origin, much like the\nattorney-client privilege, the -- the doctrine in\nHarlow, qualified immunity is designed to impact and\naffect the efficient operation of government.\nThe design of the attorney-client privilege\nis intended to have the same impact on the efficient and\neffective operation of the administration of justice.\nIf I could go back, Justice Breyer, to the\nquestion that you raised with regard to other privilege.\nI would suggest that a holding in this case in our favor\nwould have no impact on the Court's later determination\nof privileges of husband, wife, spousal privileges, or\nof priest and penitent type privileges. I would suggest\nthat the better course would be to examine a case that\ndevelops the importance or the impact of those\nprivileges, but certainly with regard, for example, to\nspousal immunity or spousal privilege, the way that the\nStates recognize them -- I believe that all 50 States\nrecognize spousal privilege -- is varied.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So -- so, I think any\nsystem of -- that denies you the interlocutory appeal,\nwill, in fact, work some injustice. I have no doubt\nabout that. Any system that allows too many\ninterlocutory appeals wrecks the judicial system through\ndelay.\nNow, I think on that kind of question which\nis here, maybe there is some information that you come\nacross with the ABA, for example, that has 300,000 --\nmaybe 600 -- you know, hundreds of thousands of members.\nThere might be instances in the circuits where appeal\nwas denied, where the lawyers would say, my goodness,\nappeal was denied, I want to tell you the hardship that\nthat worked.\nHas anyone gone around and tried to find if\nthere are such instances, as there must be, how serious\nit was? How harmful, how often do we have any empirical\ninformation on that question?\nMR. ALLEN: Your Honor, I do not have any\nempirical information to answer that question. But to\ngo to the -- to the -- to the underlying premise of\nwhether or not those other cases might generate some\nflood gate, if you will, I think we have -- we have\nanswered to be clear with Respondent's description of\nour counting. I don't think it is a statistical\nanalysis. We simply counted the actual appeals, 11.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is it wrong for me to\nexpect that if this would work, a lot of instances of\nserious hardship not allowing the appeal, some lawyers\nin their meetings would be upset and they would raise a\nfew examples? So doesn't the fact that you have been\nunable to find any tend to count against you?\nMR. ALLEN: I don't believe it does, Your\nHonor, I don't believe that should count against us.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
