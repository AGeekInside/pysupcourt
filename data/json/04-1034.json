        "content": "(10:12 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Rapanos v. United States and\nCarabell v. the United States Army Corps of Engineers.\nMr. Hopper.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF M. REED HOPPER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 04-1034\nMR. HOPPER: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please\nthe Court:\nThis is a case of agency overreaching. In\nthis case, the Corps and EPA pushed the very limits of\ncongressional authority, contrary to the plain text of\nthe act and without any clear indication Congress\nintended that result. They claim 404(a) jurisdiction\nover the entire tributary system, from the smallest\ntrickle to the largest watershed, swapping in --\nsweeping in remote, non-navigable wetlands 20 miles\nfrom the traditional navigable water.\nThis limitless claim of jurisdiction shifts\nthe Federal/State balance and raises significant\nconstitutional questions. We believe this boundless\ninterpretation is inconsistent with this Court's\nreading of the act in Solid Waste Agency.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It goes somewhat beyond the\nsmallest trickle? Doesn't it? Doesn't it also include\nditches that currently don't have any trickle if they\nobtain a trickle during a rainstorm?\nMR. HOPPER: Yes, Your Honor. They actually\nargued that it -- it makes no difference whether there\n-- what the substantiality is or the directness of the\nconnection is. It's irrelevant to the jurisdictional\ndetermination.\nAnd as I said, they -- the -- the agencies\nassert jurisdiction over even the entire watershed.\nFor example, the Mississippi watershed, the largest in\nthe Nation, covers 1 million square acre -- 1 million\nsquare miles and reaches from the Rockies to the\nAppalachians and drains 41 percent of the 48 lower\nStates.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So where would you --\nwhere would -- where would you put the line?\nMR. HOPPER: I'd put the line where Congress\nput the line, Your Honor. Congress declared in 404(a)\nthat it would prohibit the discharge of fill and\ndredged material into the navigable waters. So the --\nthese agencies can permit or prohibit any discharge, no\nmatter where it occurs, so long as it reaches a\nnavigable water. That would be the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But then -- but you were\n-- you are including at least wetlands that abut --\nMR. HOPPER: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- navigable water.\nMR. HOPPER: Yes. Traditional navigable\nwaters plus abutting wetlands inseparably bound up.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about major\ntributaries?\nMR. HOPPER: Congress cannot regulate all\ntributaries. It could regulate some tributaries --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Which ones?\nMR. HOPPER: -- but would have to do so on a\ncase-by-case basis. The regulation of all tributaries\nraises significant constitutional questions and\ncontrary to the regulation of -- of wetlands that are\ninseparably bound up. And there's no clear indication\nthat Congress intended to regulate any tributaries, let\nalone the entire tributary system.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, is your position no\ntributaries or some tributaries?\nMR. HOPPER: The -- the act, by its terms,\ndoes not recognize the -- the regulation of any\ntributary. It does --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Does it make sense to say\nthat any wetlands that it abuts a traditionally\nnavigable water is covered, but a tributary that leads\nright into a traditionally navigable water is not\nnecessarily covered?\nMR. HOPPER: I think -- I think it's fair to\nsay that under this Court's determination in Solid\nWaste Agency that the only wetlands that are covered\nare those that are abutting and inseparably bound up.\nIt makes sense to do so because by regulating those\ntypes of wetlands, the Government is essentially\ndeclaring them the equivalent of the navigable\nwaterway.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but they're doing it\nfor a functional reason. The functional reason is that\nif you put the poison in the adjacent wetland, it's\ngoing to get into the navigable water. Exactly the\nsame argument can be made as you go further and further\nup the tributaries, and it seems to me that once you\nconcede, as I think you have to, that there can be a\nregulation that goes beyond literally navigable water\nat the point at which the -- the pollutant is added,\nthen you have to follow the same logic right up through\nthe watershed to -- to any point at which a pollutant,\nonce added, will eventually get into the navigable\nwater.\nMR. HOPPER: The reason that logic does not\napply, Your Honor, is because the regulation of -- of\ntributaries raises significant constitutional questions\nthat are not implicated by the regulation of a wetland\ninseparably --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then -- then you have to\naccept the fact that -- that Congress cannot\neffectively regulate the navigable -- the -- the\ncondition of the navigable water itself because if all\nthe -- the -- let's -- let's assume there's a class of\n-- of evil polluters out there who just want to wreck\nthe -- the navigable waters of the United States. All\nthey have to do is get far enough upstream and they can\ndump anything they want to. It will eventually get\ninto the navigable water, and Congress can't do\nanything about it on your theory.\nMR. HOPPER: That's incorrect, Your Honor.\nWe acknowledge that under the -- the act, the\nGovernment can regulate any discharge that actually\nreaches the navigable water.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So you're -- you're going to\n-- you -- you then want to draw a distinction between\nthe dredge and fill addition and, let's say, a -- a\nconventional synthetic poison.\nMR. HOPPER: No. Either -- in either case,\nif -- if the -- if the discharge of dredged material\nactually enters into a navigable water, regardless of\nwhere it's discharged, it would be covered. Same for a\nconventional toxin.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You mean on -- on -- in\nevery -- in every case then, I mean, Congress would\nhave to -- I'm sorry -- a scientist would have to\nanalyze the molecules and -- and trace them up, and so\nlong as they could -- could trace it to a specific\ndischarge, they could get at it, but otherwise they\ncouldn't? I mean, that -- you know, you know what I'm\ngetting at. That obviously would -- would totally\nthwart the regulation.\nMR. HOPPER: I don't -- I don't believe it\nwould, Your Honor. The -- the -- certainly Congress\ndid not think so in section --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Couldn't you simply assume\nthat anything that is discharged into a tributary\nultimately goes where the tributary goes? Wouldn't it\nbe enough to prove the discharge?\nMR. HOPPER: Well, it certainly wasn't true\nin this case, Your Honor. The --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you don't think it would\nbe enough for the -- for the Government to prove the\ndischarge into a tributary in order to prove that the\nact has been violated.\nMR. HOPPER: No, Your Honor, I do not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You really think it has to\ntrace the molecules.\nMR. HOPPER: Absolutely. That's -- that's\nwhat the terms of the act require.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do you -- how do\nyou define a tributary?\nMR. HOPPER: Well, the -- that's one of the\nproblems here, Your Honor, is that -- is that the\nagency has -- has established a moving target for --\nfor tributaries.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what's your\ndefinition?\nMR. HOPPER: Well, the -- the definitions\nwe're working with here, to which we object, is that --\nis that it includes anything in the hydrological\nconnection.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know what you\nobject to, and I know that you think your client isn't\ncovered. But I don't know what test you would have us\nadopt for what constitutes a tributary.\nMR. HOPPER: Well, we're suggesting that --\nthat this Court need not define tributary because under\nthe act all tributaries are excluded. The only -- the\nonly prohibited act --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay, but we\nstill don't know what you're excluding. I mean, the\nMissouri is a tributary of the Mississippi, but I\nassume it's still covered.\nMR. HOPPER: Those -- anything that is not of\na -- anything does not constitute the channel, the\ntraditional navigable water, and anything not abutting\nas a -- as a inseparably bound up wetland would\nconstitute a tributary.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it -- it seems to me\nthat what works in your favor is -- is it SWANCC? I\ndon't -- I'm not quite sure how to pronounce the case.\nMR. HOPPER: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The Migratory Bird Rule\ncase where we said there had to be a significant nexus.\nBut I think what the Court is asking you is -- is how\nto define significant nexus. We're -- if you want us\njust to say, well, this case is too much, but then the\nCorps of Engineers should use its expertise to come up\nwith a new regulation, that's rather an odd opinion for\nus to write.\nMR. HOPPER: Well, this Court did not --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And it seems to me that\nthat's what you're asking us to do here.\nMR. HOPPER: This Court did not suggest in --\nin SWANCC that a significant nexus constitutes the\njurisdictional standard for all -- for all waters.\nThat standard only applies to wetlands that are\nadjacent to traditional navigable waters.\nThe jurisdictional standard is determined by\nthe terms of the act. In -- in SWANCC, this Court\ndetermined that the act was clear and should be read as\nwritten to avoid the constitutional questions raised by\na broad interpretation of the act. As written --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: From everything -- from\neverything you said, it sounds like you're -- you're\ntaking issue with Riverside Bayview because if a\nwetland adjacent to the river counts, then why not a\nstream that goes right into it? What sense does that\ndistinction make?\nMR. HOPPER: It makes perfect sense, Your\nHonor, because the regulation of those tributaries and\nstreams, all of them in the entire tributary system,\nraise significant constitutional questions that are not\nimplicated by regulating wetlands that are inseparably\nbound up with traditional navigable water.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: More than that, Mr. Hopper.\nI thought and I had expected you to -- to respond to\nJustice Souter's question this way, his question about\nhow come putting poison in -- in the wetlands is bad,\nbut it's okay to put it in the tributary. But they --\nas I understand it, the reason we held wetlands were\nincluded within the waters of the United States was not\n-- not that, that you could poison the waters by\npoisoning the wetlands, but rather, it was that it's\nvery hard to tell where the navigable water ends and\nthe wetland begins. And -- and we said, you know,\nwe're not going to parse that. If it's -- if it's\nadjacent to a navigable water and it's wet, we're going\nto say it's part of a navigable water.\nMR. HOPPER: That's right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that was our\nbasis.\nMR. HOPPER: That's exactly right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And, of course, that basis\ndoesn't apply to tributaries, does it? You -- you can\nalways tell where the tributary ends. It ends at the\npoint where it goes into the main river.\nMR. HOPPER: I think that's correct, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You think that's correct\nabout what the Court said in Bayview when it phrased\nthe question as before discharging fill material into\nwetlands adjacent to navigable bodies of water and\ntheir tributaries. That's what the Court thought it\nwas deciding in Riverside Bayview.\nMR. HOPPER: The Court did frame the question\nthat way, Your Honor. However, the Court's commentary\nabout tributaries was not germane to its -- to its\nholding. Tributaries was not a question before the\nCourt.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: At any rate, they could\nnot have been making the distinction Justice Scalia\nsuggested if, at least in the Court's thinking, the\ntributaries rolled right into the navigable body.\nMR. HOPPER: Well, as I said, the -- the\nCourt's commentary in Riverside Bayview is not good law\nbecause the -- the Court was not addressing the -- a\ntributary's question in that case, and it was not faced\nwith a Commerce Clause challenge as it is in this case.\nAnd at that time, the agency did not interpret\ntributaries to include every hydrological reach of the\n-- of the tributary system.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but doesn't the\nreference to tributary make it relatively plain that\nwhat the Court was getting at was the impossibility of\ndrawing a functional distinction between wetlands and\ntributaries on the one hand, navigable waters on the\nother, when the purpose of the regulation is to protect\nthe purity of the ultimate navigable water? And isn't\nthe inclusion of the reference to tributaries an\nindication that it said if we want to attain the\nobjective, which is clearly constitutional, then we\nhave got to recognize these means, i.e., regulation of\n-- of pollution in wetlands and tributaries, in order\nto reach that objective? Isn't that the reasoning that\nis apparent from what Justice Ginsburg just -- just\nread to you?\nMR. HOPPER: I don't believe so, Your Honor.\nThe -- the problem that -- that the agencies have in\nthis case, which was underscored in Solid Waste Agency,\nis that the Government cannot show any clear indication\nthat Congress intended to regulate the entire tributary\nsystem. In Solid Waste Agency, this Court did\nrecognize that because of congressional acquiescence,\nCongress intended to regulate wetlands adjacent to\nnavigable waters, but as to other waters, this Court\ncould come to no conclusion because the Congress had\nnever defined other waters.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it's -- except for the\n-- it seems to me except for -- for your -- your\nargument is -- is fine except for one problem. And\nthat is, if we -- if we assume that Congress was being\nas -- as cautious as you suggest, then Congress'\ncaution, in effect, was -- was allowing an end run\naround the regulation for the reasons we went into a\nmoment ago. All you've got to do is -- is dump the\npollutant further -- far enough upstream in the\nwatershed and you get away scot-free. And it's very\ndifficult to believe that Congress could have intended\nthat.\nMR. HOPPER: I don't think it's difficult to\nbelieve that at all, Your Honor. We simply look at --\nat the goals and objectives that Congress itself\nadopted in furtherance of this mission to protect the\nwaters. If we look at 1251(a), Congress declares that\nits purpose is to protect the integrity of the Nation's\nwaters. It used that term, Nation's waters. And then\nin -- in 1251(a)(1), it says it will accomplish this by\neliminating the discharge of pollutants into the\nnavigable waters, showing that it knows how to\ndistinguish between all waters and navigable waters.\nAnd then in 1251(b), Congress says we will respect and\ndefer to the States' primary responsibility to address\nlocal water pollution and to manage local land and\nwater use. So the way that Congress intended to\naddress this issue was to defer to the States to\nregulate pollutants upstream while Congress -- or while\nthe Federal Government regulates downstream. That's a\nperfectly rational approach to this national problem.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if -- but your --\nbut your answer earlier to Justice Souter's earlier\nquestion was that if you dump the pollutants anywhere\nand they make their way to the navigable water, you're\ncovered. Right?\nMR. HOPPER: Are covered if they make it --\ntheir way all the way there. If they don't, then the\nStates have that responsibility. And every State in\nthe Nation has antipollution regulation.\nIf there are no further questions, I'd like\nto reserve my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Stoepker.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY A. STOEPKER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 04-1384\nMR. STOEPKER: Mr. Chief Justice, may it\nplease the Court:\nAfter years of review by the State of\nMichigan and the Respondent, the record is very clear.\nPetitioners' wetland is hydrologically isolated from\nany navigable water of the United States.\nFurther, the State of Michigan, exercising\nthe power specifically and traditionally reserved to\nit, undertook responsibility to regulate the waters at\nissue and pollution and, in doing so, issued Petitioner\na wetland permit.\nIt is clear from the record in this case that\nthere is no hydrological connection between the\nPetitioners' wetland and navigable waters of the United\nStates. Referring to the appendix filed, the joint\nappendix filed in this case, specifically beginning\nwith the EPA letters dating back to 1994, as this\nproperty has been under years of review, do not\nreference any such connection.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did we talk about a\nhydrological connection in Riverside Bayview?\nMR. STOEPKER: The -- the connection there\nwas -- in essence, yes, Your Honor, based upon the\ninseparable, bound-up nature of those wetlands which\nwere immediately adjacent to the navigable water.\nThere was nothing that separated those wetlands from\nthat specific body of water. They were immediately\nadjacent and intersected with that body of water.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure what you mean\nby a hydrological connection. Do you mean a constant\n-- a constant body of water between the two, or do you\nmean simply a -- a drain that at some times might carry\noff rainwater from -- from this land? And -- would\nthat -- would that suffice to be a hydrological\nconnection?\nMR. STOEPKER: In -- in this case, Your\nHonor, there was no connection at all. In this case,\nthere was no connection identified. It was speculated\nthat there might be a potential --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Water never ran off of this\n-- of this land.\nMR. STOEPKER: No. If you look -- that is\ncorrect. If you look at the circuit court opinion, it\n-- and even the district court opinion and the findings\nmade, there is no finding that any water has ever left\nthe Petitioners' wetland into the ditch.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do they have to make\nthis on a plot-by-plot basis, or can they make a\ncategorical judgment that even in cases in which, you\nknow, there's a berm, as there is here, when the water\nis high, it spills over? And if the categorical\njudgment is sound, do you have an exception because\nthey haven't proven it with respect to your particular\nlot?\nMR. STOEPKER: Yes. Yes, Your Honor. In --\nin this case --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Where do you get that\nexception?\nMR. STOEPKER: In the Respondents' brief on\npage 18, they acknowledge that the traditional test has\nbeen hydrological connection, that that's what they\nhave looked towards.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And the -- and the -- but I\nmean, what I'm getting at is the traditional test is\nthe basis for a categorical judgment. Your land falls\nwithin the general category. Your argument is I should\nnot be subject to it, to the statute, because of the\ngeneral category. I should be subject to it only if\nthey prove specifically that the water spills over in\nrainy periods in my particular lot. In other words,\nyou're saying there's got to be a specific connection\nas opposed to a categorical judgment. And my question\nis what under the act supports that view.\nMR. STOEPKER: Under the act, it talks about\nthe issue of discharge. That is the -- that is the\nmatter that is being regulated by the statute, an\nactual discharge into the navigable body of water. If\nyou have an hydrologically isolated body of water, you\ncannot physically have a discharge into the navigable\nstream. It is an impossibility. And therefore, the\nact does not allow the speculation that the Court is\nreferring to here.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so your -- maybe what\nyou're saying is we have shown or the record shows that\nthis doesn't fit within the category because it never\nspills over or whatever. Is that your argument?\nMR. STOEPKER: That is correct. The record\nin this case does not identify a connection between\nthis wetland and this non-navigable ditch.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Am I correct --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Stoepker, your\nfriend, Mr. Hopper, would certainly not agree with you\nthat -- that a -- a hydrological connection is the,\nquote, traditional test. What -- what is your\ndefinition of tradition?\nMR. STOEPKER: Our definition --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How long has this test been\nestablished?\nMR. STOEPKER: If you look at Respondents'\nbrief in their arguments to this Court, they first\nstate, page 18, that in fact traditionally they've\nlooked at hydrological connection. Second, they --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Traditionally.\nMR. STOEPKER: Traditionally.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes --\nMR. STOEPKER: From the inception of the\nrules.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: From the inception of the\nrules.\nMR. STOEPKER: Inception of the rules, that\nthey have looked at hydrological connection.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That that alone has been\nenough.\nMR. STOEPKER: No. They state that that is\nthe -- the beginning point. The beginning point.\nThey then state that they have historically\nundertook a interrelationship analysis of the wetland\nto the tributary or body of water and that they then\ndefer that to the permit review.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I see. So you're -- you're\nnot conceding that -- that hydrologic -- hydrological\nconnection is adequate. You're just -- is sufficient.\nYou're just saying it's necessary.\nMR. STOEPKER: We're -- that is correct, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I get back to the\nquestion earlier? What is a hydrological connection?\nIs it enough if the water seeps through the ground and\nunderground is connected with the navigable water, or\ndoes there have to be a ditch or -- or a culvert that\nyou can see the water flowing through?\nMR. STOEPKER: Yes, Your Honor. The --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes?\nMR. STOEPKER: Mr. Chief Justice, in -- in\nresponse to that question, both potentially. In this\ncase, again, there was no surface water connection, and\ndue to the nature of the clay soils, it was found that\nthere was no groundwater connection --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Was it -- was it also clear\nthat after the improvement, there would be no drainage?\nMR. STOEPKER: After the improvement, there\ncould be drainage. Ironically the Respondent in this\ncase actually recommends that the barriers between this\nsite and the ditch be removed.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I just ask one\nclarifying question? Was it found that there was no\nconnection, or was it not found that there was a\nconnection?\nMR. STOEPKER: It was found that there was\nnot a connection.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It was. I didn't read it\nthat way.\nMR. STOEPKER: If you -- referring the Court\nto the Respondents' report dated May 5th of 2000, it\nspecifically states --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Where are you reading from?\nMR. STOEPKER: This is from appendix page 81\nand 83. This is a report that starts with the term\njurisdictional at the top.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right.\nMR. STOEPKER: It notes a number of issues or\nclassifications there or points. First, that the\nwetland is not adjacent to navigable water. It then\nnotes the wetland is not adjacent to headwater. And\nthen it makes a comment. It says, to a tributary to\nnavigable water, and it says, no.\nThe sole basis for jurisdiction in that\nreport is the Migratory Bird Rule. The Respondent took\nout to the property who they believed to be the most\ncredible expert they had on migratory birds and then\nstate that the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm sorry. I want to be\nsure I follow you. You say that somewhere on page 82\nthere is a finding that there was no hydrological\nconnection?\nMR. STOEPKER: They do not reference a -- I'm\n-- this --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They don't find a --\nMR. STOEPKER: Right. They do -- they do\nnot.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I agree with that. I'm\nasking you if they found there was no hydrological\nconnection.\nMR. STOEPKER: Yes, they make that in a\nsubsequent report.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But not on page 82.\nMR. STOEPKER: Not -- not in this first\nreport.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is the report in the -- is\nthe subsequent report in the record somewhere?\nMR. STOEPKER: Yes. The next report is\nissued September 11th of 2000. In that report --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And again, where --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What page are you on?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Where are you?\nMR. STOEPKER: I'm going to refer you to the\nspecific pages.\nThey first referenced clay soils on page 93.\nThese are the same clay soils that the State\nadministrative law judge, after much hearing on the\nrecord, found were impermeable to prevent groundwater\nand surface water discharge.\nThen at page 97 of the appendix, the\nRespondent finds that due to site conditions -- I will\nquote -- this wetland has been obstructed from\nreceiving runoff from surrounding area and from\ncirculation by flooding into the drain. End of quote.\nThen referring to page 99 of the same\nappendix, I quote. The parcel is not currently a part\nof the S-O Drain watershed, being the Sutherland-Oemig\nwatershed.\nThen referring to page 100 where they comment\non navigation, they state, no impact on navigation.\nAnd then finally at page 106 of the appendix,\nthe features on this site -- and again I quote --\npresently isolate the wetland from the S-O Drain and\nreceiving waters.\nSo it receives none and it gives none. They\nused the term in their report isolated. There is no\nfinding anywhere to the contrary in any reports issued,\nor thereafter at the public hearing that was conducted\nby the Respondent, that there is any connection. In\nfact, the Sixth Circuit noted there was no connection.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then what was the reason\nthey gave for rejecting the permit?\nMR. STOEPKER: The -- the sole reason claimed\nfor jurisdiction at the agency hearing was adjacency to\nthis non-navigable, unnamed ditch, which was dug by the\ncounty for a sewer system. That's the sole reason.\nThe same argument appeared at the district court level,\nadjacency to the unnamed, unnavigable ditch.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- I'm still not clear as\nto what the findings were, if there were findings, as\nto what the condition would be after the improvement.\nWould there be an increased likelihood of drainage into\nthe ditch after the improvement?\nMR. STOEPKER: The -- it -- it could occur in\ntwo different ways.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and if that were so,\nwould that be sufficient for jurisdiction?\nMR. STOEPKER: They -- that -- that was not\ntheir finding because in this case they actually\nrecommended, whether or not anything occurred on the\nproperty, that the berms or barriers be removed. They\nactually recommend there be an interaction between the\nwetland and the ditch. That's the irony of this.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But, well -- suppose the\ninteraction were automatic. Would that suffice to make\nthis a wetlands after the improvement?\nMR. STOEPKER: It -- it is our position in\nthis case no because the ditch next to the site has not\nbeen regulated under the rules adopted by the\nRespondent and -- nor under the statute adopted by\nCongress. The ditch is -- has been historically\ndesignated as a point source or a source point, as has\nbeen the drain under the statute.\nIn 1975, after the district court ruled that\nthe Respondent's rules were too narrow from a\njurisdictional standpoint, the Respondent then expanded\nits rules in 1975. In the preamble to those rules, it\nspecifically stated that ditches -- ditches of this\nnature, drainage ditches, were specifically exempted as\nwaters of the United States. That is in the preamble.\nWe then go to 19 --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, what -- what\nis the test that you would have us adopt for a\nsignificant nexus?\nMR. STOEPKER: Our -- our test for\nsignificant nexus would start with the -- the basis\nthat there must be an established, existing\nhydrological connection between the wetland and the\nbody of water adjacent --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: By that, you mean\neither a ditch or underground seepage?\nMR. STOEPKER: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So there has\n-- there has to be any -- and any hydrological\nconnection works.\nMR. STOEPKER: Based --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Hopper won't like\nthat, but for --\nMR. STOEPKER: No.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. STOEPKER: Using this Court's definition\nin -- in SWANCC, it's -- it is our position that it\nneeds to be a substantial nexus or interrelationship.\nWe're saying --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't -- you don't\nhave to define what -- everything that's necessary.\nAll you have to define is one indispensable element.\nAnd all you're arguing is that a hydrological\nconnection is an indispensable element, whatever\nadditional elements --\nMR. STOEPKER: That is correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- there may be. So you may\nagree with your friend, Mr. Hopper.\nMR. STOEPKER: We're --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you just haven't\nreached that point. Right?\nMR. STOEPKER: We don't -- we do not believe\nthat this case needs to reach that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But I'm still puzzled --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't want to set you two\nto fighting with each other.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- by your answer to\nJustice --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- Justice Kennedy. What\nif there's no hydrological connection today, but there\nwould be after you -- after you built your project?\nMR. STOEPKER: At that point, then maybe the\nRespondent could determine there would be some form of\nregulation if, in fact, the discharge was into a ditch\nthat was, in fact, regulated. And --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it -- would it be a\nsufficient reason to deny a permit based on the\njudgment that after the project is completed, there\nwill be a -- a hydrological connection?\nMR. STOEPKER: The test is from the outset,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No. It seems to me you\ncould answer that yes or no.\nMR. STOEPKER: Yes. No.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Perhaps you don't want to\nbut --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. STOEPKER: The -- the resulting impact --\nI would say no. The resulting impact has not been\ndetermined for jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't it sort of\nfoolish to say that we're concerned about pollution,\nbut only if you -- only if you catch it in advance?\nThat doesn't make sense because if the problem would\narise when you did what you're seeking a permit to do,\nwhy shouldn't you be denied the permit?\nMR. STOEPKER: The application for the permit\ndoes not automatically equate to a request to\ndischarge. The fill of a wetland does not\nautomatically discharge into the ditch.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but my hypothesis is\nthat we know it would happen, or they -- they would\nfind it would happen after the project is completed.\nAnd it seems to me that -- that that's what you should\nfocus on rather than what's -- you know, rather than\nwhat happens before.\nMR. STOEPKER: This Court's test in SWANCC is\nbased upon the before, and also based upon Riverside,\nit examined the before condition and the impact on that\nnavigable water. And what is to be prevented is the\ndischarge into that navigable water. And that is the\ninitial test that is conducted.\nIf the Court examines the Respondent's actual\ntest data, what they examined here was the\njurisdictional determination from the beginning. Is\nthere a connection? Is it isolated? Is it not\nisolated? They didn't look at the after-effect. They\nlooked at the after-effect in relationship to issuing\nor not issuing the permit.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What we're talking about\nhere is -- is at -- at most, whether this is a water of\nthe United States. The condition for requiring permits\nis that it -- it be a water of the United States.\nIsn't that right?\nMR. STOEPKER: That is correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And it either is or it\nisn't, not -- not that it will be. It either is or it\nisn't. If it is, you -- you need a permit; if it\nisn't, you don't need a permit.\nMR. STOEPKER: That is correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And Justice Stevens'\nquestion I think in -- in that framework is -- is this.\nIf it will result in discharge after the project, is\nit a water of the United States now?\nMR. STOEPKER: Under the Court's definition\nin SWANCC and Riverside, the answer again is no.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then -- then Congress has\npassed a statute that says we'll lock the barn after\nthe horse is stolen. I mean, that -- maybe that's what\nit did, but that's -- that would be a very odd thing\nfor it to do, wouldn't it?\nMR. STOEPKER: It did not do so, Your Honor,\nbecause specifically under section 1251(b), it reserved\nto the States the primary responsibility of regulating\npollution within its waters. The primary\nresponsibility. That primary responsibility is not\ndesignated to the Respondent in this case. A shift\nwould -- in -- in that framework would shift the\nprimary responsibility to the Respondent and take that\nprimary responsibility away from the State.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it -- it would do so\nin -- in cases of -- I guess, of the -- the sorts of --\nof new proposed actions that require the -- the Corps\nto get into it in the first place. But I also assume\nthat it would leave lots of -- of water pollution\nregulation to the States. I don't see that it would\ndisplace the States.\nMR. STOEPKER: In this case, it actually --\nthe decision of the Respondent did displace the State.\nThe State, after years of examination and\ndetermination of impact, made a decision to issue a\nwetland permit to this project and, in doing so, found\nspecifically that the issuance of the permit would be\nbetter, effective method of dealing with pollution than\nnot issuing the permit. That was the specific finding\nmade by the administrative law judge in that appendix,\nand those findings are the first part of the appendix\nin this case, detailed findings after a 2-week\nadministrative trial where witnesses were cross-\nexamined and examined.\nIn this case, the Respondent has ignored\nthose State powers given to its traditional waters and\nhas said, we're going to ignore, number one, your claim\nof jurisdiction, and number two, we're going to ignore\nyour finding of no impact and completely disregard\nthat.\nSo, in fact, the framework in this case did\nshift. The State did what it was supposed to do under\n1251(b) and the -- the Respondent in this case usurped\nthat responsibility and those traditional powers\ngranted to it traditionally and both by this statute,\nand then determined that what the State of Michigan did\nhad no relevance. It was unwarranted. So the\nframework in this case did specifically change.\nAnd in doing so, we get back to those same\nfactual findings they've made. We are here only today\nbecause they found that it is adjacent to a ditch which\nthey have said is not a waters of the United States.\nSo in this case, the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the only reason it's a\nwater of the United States is that there are some\npuddles on this land. Right? And if there were no\npuddles, it -- it wouldn't be a water of the United\nStates. It would just be land of the United States.\nMR. STOEPKER: That's correct, because\nthere's some puddles on the land occasionally.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So it -- it becomes waters\nof the United States because there are puddles on it,\nand you assert because those puddles have some\nhydrological connection or if it is -- if it is water\nof the United States, those puddles have some\nhydrological connections with the navigable waters.\nMR. STOEPKER: To -- to be waters of the\nUnited States, they would have to have a hydrological\nconnection as a minimum test to be a part of the waters\nof the United States.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and the -- the\nstatute only prohibits the discharge of dredged or fill\nmaterial, which is what is going on here, into the\nnavigable waters, right, at specified disposal sites.\nI'm sorry. The -- the permits that -- that are\nrequired here --\nMR. STOEPKER: That is correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- permit discharge into\nwaters, not -- not into lands that aren't waters.\nMR. STOEPKER: No. The -- that is correct.\nThe permit permits the discharge into a navigable water\nof the United States. That is the object of the\npermit.\nAgain, the rules that the Respondent has\nadopted since 1975 have specifically excluded the\nNundane ditch, as well as the drain next to that ditch,\nas being defined as waters of the United States. So\ntherefore, even if they could show a connection, which\nis a question that has been raised, would in fact the\nwetland be regulated, by the -- by the Respondents' own\ndefinitions and by the statutory definition which\nexcludes a ditch and a drain under section 1262(12) and\n(14), neither the ditch or the Sutherland-Oemig drain\nby definition is a water of the United States. It is a\npoint source and therefore not a water. So even if\nthey could --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask one question\nabout your -- your not -- no hydrological connection?\nIf this berm were next to a wetland that would\notherwise be adjacent to a river, the situation that\nwas presented in Riverside Bayview, is it the berm that\nprevents there being a hydrological connection?\nMR. STOEPKER: In this case, there are two\nthings. The first, the berm segregates the surface\nwater connection between the two, and then second, the\nnature of the soils being clay, which are not permeable\nsoils, create the additional segregation between that\nand the body of water.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So it could -- there could\nbe a situation where the wetlands would be right next\nto the river, but there's a berm in between, and that\nwould break the hydrological connection?\nMR. STOEPKER: It would break the\nhydrological connection. However, this Court has ruled\nin the Riverside case that those wetlands which are\nadjacent to navigable waters -- it did not reach the\nissue whether they were not adjacent to non-navigable\nwaters. They only addressed the -- this Court only\naddressed the issue of relationship to navigable\nwaters. In that case, this Court specifically found\nthat wetlands adjacent to navigable waters were\nregulated.\nThe Court specifically reserved the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think it -- do you\nthink it mean adjacent with a berm in between? I -- I\nthought the reason they -- they reached that conclusion\nwas you can't tell where the navigable water ends and\nwhere the wetland begins. I -- I thought they assumed\na connection between the two.\nMR. STOEPKER: In reading the opinion -- Your\nHonor, my time is up.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You may respond\nbriefly.\nMR. STOEPKER: Yes.\nIn reading the opinion, it -- it appears\nthat this Court found, because it actually went to the\nwater's edge, there was an inseparable, bound-up\nattachment between the wetland and the navigable water.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. STOEPKER: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: General Clement.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn United States against Riverside Bayview\nHomes, this Court unanimously upheld the Corps'\njurisdiction over wetlands that were not themselves\nnavigable, but were adjacent to waters otherwise within\nthe Corps' jurisdiction.\nThe principal difference between the Rapanos\nwetlands and the wetlands at issue in Riverside Bayview\nare that the Rapanos wetlands are adjacent to a non-\nnavigable tributary, while the wetlands at issue in\nRiverside Bayview were adjacent to a navigable creek.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do you define\ntributary?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The tributary -- you\nsay they're adjacent to a nonnavigable tributary.\nThat's a -- a culvert, a ditch. Right?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, not in all these cases,\nMr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But in Rapanos'\ncase.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, not -- not -- that's\nactually not true. There are three specific wetlands\nthat are at issue in the Rapanos case. One of those,\nthe Pine River site, as its name suggests, is adjacent\nto the Pine River, which is a body of water that has\nwater flowing through it all year-round. It's a river.\nI don't think anybody would look at that and say\nthat's not a tributary of the downstream navigable\nrivers. And I think that's why, in fairness --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about -- what\nabout the other -- the other sites?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: The -- the other sites are --\nare adjacent to man-made ditches that also drain in.\nIf I just -- can I just say, though, I think\nthe fact that the Pine River site is so obviously a\ntributary under -- under any definition is one of the\nreasons, along with the theory that you heard advanced\nby Petitioners, that this case --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But your argument\nassumes that the ditches that go to the other two sites\nare also tributaries.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI just want to make the point that this case, because\nof the theory Petitioners have advanced, has not really\nunearthed or focused on the definition of a tributary,\nbut let me get to it because the Corps has defined the\ndefinition of a tributary. And the definition of a\ntributary is basically any channelized body of water\nthat takes water in a flow down to the traditional\nnavigable water --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even when it's not a body of\nwater.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Even --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A storm drain, even -- even\nwhen it's not filled with water, is a tributary.\nRight?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Scalia, absolutely.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: The Corps has not drawn a\ndistinction between man-made channels or ditches and\nnatural channels or ditches. And, of course, it would\nbe very absurd for the Corps to do that since the Erie\nCanal is a ditch.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I suggest it's very absurd\nto call that waters of the United States. It's a\ndrainage ditch dug -- you know, dug by the municipality\nor -- you know, or a gutter in a street. To call that\nwaters of the United States seems to me extravagant.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, let me say two things,\nJustice Scalia. First of all, this case has not been\nlitigated under the theory that the key difference is\nwhether it's man-made or natural, and that defines\nsomehow the scope of a tributary. And I think there's\na good reason for that, which is the second point,\nwhich is as the Corps experts -- from the experts of the\nCorps will tell you, the process of making the natural\nrivers navigable has all been about the process of\nchannelizing them and creating man-made, artificial\nchannels in them to the point where the difference\nbetween that which is a man-made channel and that which\nis a natural channel is both difficult to discern and\nutterly beside the point for purposes of this\nregulatory scheme.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what percentage of\nthe -- of the territory of the United States do you\nbelieve is -- is subjected to permits from the Corps of\nEngineers on your theory whenever you want to move\ndirt, whenever you want to deposit sand? What -- what\npercentage of the total land mass of the United States,\nif you define tributary as broadly as you define it to\ninclude? Every storm drain? I mean, it's the whole\ncountry, isn't it?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All the water goes down to\nthe sea and there's some kind of a drain or -- or a bed\nthat takes the water down there.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think the precise\nanswer to your question being none of the land mass --\nnone of the land itself would be regulated. But in\nterms of -- you want to talk about the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're calling empty ditches\n-- not unless you call empty ditches land, which I do.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, the -- the Corps doesn't.\nThey treat those as water bodies.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: And that's not the gravamen of\nthe complaint here.\nBut just to be responsive to your question, I\nthink it's important to understand that the Corps and\nthe EPA's view of wetlands would cover about 80 percent\nof the wetlands in the country. And that shows that\nthe impact of this Court's decision in SWANCC was real\nand substantial because about 20 percent of the\nNation's wetlands are isolated.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but you -- that's\njust because this statute happens to refer to wetlands.\nBut under your theory, the Corps of Engineers would\nhave jurisdiction over any land that is part of that\ntributary system as well. If any of that land has a\ndeposit of -- of some materials that could leach into\nor -- or drain into the -- the tributary system, which\nis to say any gutter, in theory, the -- the Federal\nGovernment can regulate it all. No?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think that's right,\nJustice Scalia. The Corps has regulated this\nchannelized tributary system. It has done it without\nregard to whether those channels are seasonally dry in\nsome areas, and I think that's a rational judgment.\nIt's not been the gravamen of this case, though. And\nwhat's important is while the Corps and the Federal\nGovernment regulate that channelized system of\ntributaries, non-point source pollution is still\nsomething that's in the primary providence of the\nStates. And so it's not true that the Corps is\nasserting an authority to regulate land as such.\nBut to also get it on the table, if the\nFederal Government wanted to -- if Congress changed its\nmind and said that, say, the banks of the navigable\nrivers or their tributaries are within the scope of\nthis program, as it did in 1899 in section 13 of the\nRivers and Harbors Act, we'd be here defending that as\na valid exercise of Congress' authority not just under\nthe Commerce Clause, but under the navigation power of\nthe --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But in 1899, it just said\nnavigable rivers, not -- not every -- every tributary\ndefined to include even storm drains.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No. With respect, Justice\nScalia, in 1899 in section 13 of the Rivers and Harbors\nAct, the so-called Refuse Act, Congress regulated the\nnavigable waters and their tributaries. Now, in\nfairness, the focus there was this idea that they only\nregulated the tributaries if they could show that it\nflowed into the navigable waters themselves, but they\nasserted right in the text of the statute in 1899 the\nauthority to regulate the tributaries and the banks.\nAnd that shows what I think is a very\nimportant difference between this case and SWANCC.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But your -- your theory is\nthere is regulatory authority because there's an\ninteraction between the wetlands or the lands in\nquestion and the navigable waters.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Kennedy, that's not\nprecisely accurate. The way it would describe it is\nthis.\nAs to the first question you have to ask,\nwhich is are the tributaries covered, we think an\nimportant component of describing the reach of the\ntributary system is whether there's a hydrological\nconnection. On the second -- and that's subsection (5)\nof the regulatory definition that brings within the\nscope of waters of the United States tributaries.\nThen you get to the second question which\nactually implicates another subsection of the\ndefinition, subsection (7), which is the adjacent\nwetlands. And as to the adjacent wetlands, as the\nCarabell case illustrates, the definition does not turn\non hydrological connection for purposes of asserting\nthe Corps' jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but -- but wasn't --\nwasn't the reason for including the adjacent wetlands\nbecause of -- of the likelihood of an interaction?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think they -- they were\nincluded for the likelihood of an interaction both\nhydrologically and otherwise.\nI would say two important things, though.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let -- well, please\nfinish.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: The two points I would make is,\nfirst of all, I think the Corps' regulations, which for\n30 years have ignored the premise -- the -- the\npresence of a berm, are rational because in the vast,\nvast majority of cases, that berm is not going to\nprevent a hydrological connection, so to speak. And so\na test that focuses, first and foremost, on physical\nproximity is a very rational jurisdictional test.\nThe second thing I would say, though, is it's\nsimply not true that even in the rare case where a berm\nor a dike prevents all hydrological connection, that an\nadjacent wetland will not perform an important function\nfor the adjacent water body. And the most obvious one\nis the flood control possibility of the wetland.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well -- well, as you\nmention that, you cited subsection (7), and there's a\n-- what struck me anyway as a very interesting\nprovision in there. It covers wetlands adjacent to\nwaters other than waters that are themselves wetlands.\nNow, everything that you've said today and in your\nbrief would lead me to think you would contend that\nwetlands that are adjacent to wetlands ought to be\ncovered as well, and yet, the regulation leaves them\nout. And I want to know why do you think the\nregulation leaves those wetlands out.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I -- I think, Mr. Chief\nJustice, my own view is the reason that that caveat is\nin subsection (7) is actually a vestige of the pre-\nSWANCC scope of the regulation. And specifically, if\nyou look at subsection (3) of the definition which is\nthe isolated waters provision that was at issue, I\nthink, through the Migratory Bird Rule in SWANCC, that\nincludes wetlands in the available isolated waters.\nAnd I think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To me it -- it\nsuggests that even the Corps recognized that at some\npoint you've got to say stop because logically any drop\nof water anywhere is going to have some sort of\nconnection through drainage. And they're -- they're\nstopping there, and I wonder if we ought to take that\nsame instinct that -- that you see in subsection (7)\nand apply it to your definition of tributary and say,\nat some point, the definition of tributary has to have\nan end. Otherwise, you're going to go and reach too\nfar, beyond what Congress reasonably intended.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, several thoughts on that,\nMr. Chief Justice. I think the problem with that\napproach is that the reason why it makes sense to\nregulate that very first tributary that flows into the\nMississippi is the reason that it makes sense to\nregulate the entire tributary system. All of that\nwater is going to flow down into the navigable waters,\nand if there's going to be --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's true of\nthe wetland that is adjacent to the wetland that is\nadjacent to the tributary, and yet, the Corps says\nwe're not going to reach the wetland that is adjacent\nto another wetland.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, with respect, Mr. Chief\nJustice, the way that I would read that and the way I\nunderstand the Corps reads that is that was really just\ntrying to exclude a wetland adjacent to a wetland that\nwas a water of the United States only because of the\napplication of subsection (3).\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Your assumption --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: And I think that's -- that's\nsupported by the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- but this -- this is\npreliminary to my question. In SWANCC, we said there\nhas to be a significant nexus. It seems to me that you\nhave to show that there's some significant relation\nbetween the wetlands you're regulating or seeking to\nregulate and the navigable water.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I agree with that, Justice\nKennedy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I -- and that's just,\nit seemed to me, so far been missing from the\ndiscussion.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, and I -- I guess there\nis two ways to look at this. You can start with the\nsignificant nexus test and see if it's met. I guess\nthe way that the Corps would naturally proceed is to\nstart with their definitions, and they would say\nsection -- subsection (5) covers tributaries. And you\ncan ask the question, is there a significant nexus\nbetween the tributaries and the navigable waters in\nwhich they flow into? And I think the answer to that\nis yes.\nAnd then there's the secondary question, as\nto subsection (7) of the regulatory definition. Is\nthere a significant nexus between wetlands that are\nadjacent to waters otherwise within the Corps'\njurisdiction, be they the traditional navigable waters\nor their tributaries? And I think Riverside Bayview\nanswered that question and said, yes, there is a\nsignificant nexus between adjacent wetlands and any\notherwise regulable water body to which they are\nadjacent.\nSo that's the way we would ultimately satisfy\nwhat this Court required, which is a significant nexus.\nI wouldn't have understood this Court's\ndecision to transplant the significant nexus test and\nsay, that's what the Corps should administer, because\nwhatever ambiguity there is in waters of the United\nStates, I think significant nexus is precisely the kind\nof test you'd want the Corps --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what about the\nChief Justice's question, wetlands next to wetlands?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I -- I think that -- as I\nsaid, I think what -- what the definition meant to get\nat was to exclude wetlands adjacent to isolated\nwetlands under subsection (3).\nI think if you ask the question more broadly,\nwhat about wetlands next to wetlands, I guess it\ndepends on what you mean by that because the one thing\nwe know from Riverside Bayview is that it's not a\nrequirement that the parcel and its wetlands be\nimmediately adjacent.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but we didn't\ncome up with the idea of wetlands next to wetlands.\nThe Corps of Engineers has it in their regulations.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what do they mean\nby it?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: They meant wetlands adjacent to\nwaters that would otherwise not be in the statute which\nare isolated wetlands under subsection (3). It's the\nonly application it has in -- in the regulatory\nstructure, as they understand it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what is an\nexample of an insignificant nexus under the SWANCC\ntest?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Under insignificant nexus?\nWell, I think it's the waters at issue in SWANCC, and I\nthink it's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. There's no nexus\nthere.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, no --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They're isolated.\nThere's no nexus. The -- the notion in SWANCC of a\nsignificant nexus suggests that there are some bodies\nof water or puddles that are going to have a nexus, but\nit's not going to be significant enough. We didn't\njust say any nexus. It said significant nexus. So\nwhat are you leaving out to give meaning to the test\nthat we articulated in SWANCC?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I'm leaving out everything that\nthis Court excluded in SWANCC, and I wouldn't have\nthought that the -- that the Court necessarily\nsuggested there was going to be some subset that had a\nfurther insignificant nexus because it wasn't -- the\nargument of the Government in those cases was obviously\n-- we didn't just concede that those bodies of water\nwere utterly isolated. We said they did have important\necological connections with the water. And I think the\nway I read SWANCC is that we can't make that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if you have a\nwetland, you would say a wetland with a hydrological\nconnection to a tributary of navigable waters through\none drop a year is a significant nexus to the waters of\nthe United States?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: What I would say, Mr. Chief\nJustice, is that if the tributary flows in. I would\nstart with the tributary, and I'd say, now, there's\nclearly a significant nexus between the tributary and\nthe navigable waters to which it flows. I would then\nlook at the wetland, and I would say for purposes of\nthe regulation of adjacent wetlands --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One drop.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: For purposes of the adjacent\nwetlands, it doesn't look to hydrological connection\nper se. The way I would resolve that is I would\nresolve it with reference to footnote 9 in this Court's\nopinion in Riverside Bayview, and I would say, all\nright, one drop? Fair enough. It's in the regulatory\njurisdiction because it's adjacent and that's what the\nCorps looks to. And I think that's a rational\njudgment. But if there's one drop, grant the permit.\nThat solves the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Adjacent to what? Adjacent\nto a tributary. Right?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Adjacent to a tributary,\nabsolutely.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but here's -- here's\nthe fly in the ointment. You -- you interpret\ntributary to include storm drains and ditches that only\ncarry off rainwater. I mean, it makes an immense\ndifference to the scope of jurisdiction of the Corps of\nEngineers. I mean, when you talk about adjacent to a\ntributary, I think, you know, maybe adjacent to the\nMissouri River or something like that. No. You're\ntalking about adjacent to a storm drain.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, I think\nif you had in mind a tributary, you'd probably have in\nmind the Pine River which is at issue in one of these\nsites. And I think that's why that's not the way\nPetitioners have presented this case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Only because I don't know\nhow a storm drain is a water of the United States.\nThat's all. I mean, all of these terms that you're\nthrowing around somehow have to come within a\nreasonable usage of the term, waters of the United\nStates, and I do not see how a storm drain under\nanybody's concept is a water of the United States.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, Justice Scalia,\nsome things that you might classify as a storm drain\nare actually very deep channels that have a continuous\nflow of water that were --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. I was referring to a\nreal storm drain.\n(Laughter.)\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: But therein is the problem,\nwhich is some things that are part of the storm water\ndrainage system of a city are actually things that were\nprevious navigable natural waters. I mean, so --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And some aren't. But -- but\nyou would sweep them all into the jurisdiction of the\nCorps of Engineers.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: We would, Justice Scalia, but I\nguess if we can start with the proposition that\ntributaries are covered and then some things that the\nCorps thinks are tributaries you disagree with, that\nwould be fine. But that would be a different case.\nThat hasn't been the theory that this case has been\npresented.\nAs I understand, these drains here are\nactually, you know, substantial channels that do have\nwater in them. I have no doubt that the Pine River\nmeets the test that it sounds like you would have for a\ntributary, and the difficulty I'm having is I'd be\nhappy to defend what the Corps did if this Court, in\nthe -- in the litigation of this case, had focused the\ncourt's and the Corps' attention on that issue.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Am I right that a\ntributary is not a defined term in the regulations?\nRight?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: That's right. It's an\nundefined term. The Corps has interpreted it in the\n2000 preamble. The best place to find the Corps'\nteaching on this is 65 Fed.Reg. 12,823-4. And they go\nthrough -- it was part of a comment and they deal with\ncomments about their treatment of ditches and the like\nand many of these issues.\nAnd I guess what I would say is I think that\nfor purposes of this case, I mean, you heard the\nPetitioners' argument. They have obviously, based on\nthe legal position they've advanced, not focused this\nCourt or any other court's attention on subdividing\nwhich tributaries count because their view is nothing\ncounts. Even the first tributary doesn't count. And I\nthink in this case what I would urge you to do, if --\nif you have some concern with, you know, the extent of\nthe definition of tributaries, is to not make that a\nbasis for invalidating this -- the judgment of the\nSixth Circuit here. And that's an issue that could be\ndeveloped in other cases if -- if the parties want to\nreally focus the attention on that.\nI think I would be comfortable defending the\nCorps' judgment, even in those more finely focused\nchallenges, because I get back to the point, which is\nthat the same logic that has you regulate that first\ntributary also suggests that you want to regulate\nanything that's a channel that brings large quantities\nof water into the navigable waterways.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but that -- but that\ndoesn't follow. I mean, it is not a principle of law\nthat so long as the object is -- is lawful and within\nthe power of the United States, all means to which even\nthat object are lawful. That is simply not true.\nThere are various means of stopping that pollution, and\nit may well be that one of the means, which intrudes\ntoo deeply into the State's power to regulate land\nwithin their jurisdiction, is not a permissible one.\nThat -- that's not an extraordinary proposition.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I absolutely agree with you,\nJustice Scalia, and that's why I'm not up here asking\nfor Federal regulation over non-point source pollution,\nalthough that obviously contributes to the -- to the\nproblem.\nWhat I'm up here asking for is a recognition\nthat the tributary system is something that Congress\ncan validly regulate and did regulate in its broader\ndefinition of waters of the United States in the Clean\nWater Act. And I think that's something -- the\nauthority to regulate tributaries is something Congress\nregulated starting in 1899 and, importantly, this Court\nexpressly upheld in 1941 in Oklahoma against Atkinson.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see how non-point\nsource pollution is -- is any more remote from what the\nFederal Government should be able to do to achieve its\nends than is a point source pollution that -- that\nconsists of -- of dumping sand on land that has some\npuddles on it. I -- that seems to me just as remote.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think one important\nthing to focus on, Justice Scalia, is this case is not\njust about the Corps' 404 program because the 404\nprogram by its terms does not permit anything. As --\nas the permit word suggests, it's a -- it's a process\nof granting permission. The relevant provision here is\nsection 301 of the statute which prohibits a discharge\ninto the navigable waters without a permit. And so\nwhatever this Court decides for purposes of the 404\njurisdiction, it's necessarily deciding for purposes of\nthe 402 jurisdiction of the EPA.\nAnd so what you'd be suggesting is that if\nsome tributaries aren't covered, then it's perfectly\nokay to dump toxins in those tributaries even though\nyou know that because they are a channelized system\nthat directly connects with the navigable water --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's not\nreally fair. The Petitioners, as I understand it, both\nconcede the discharges that make their way into the\nnavigable waters would be covered.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: That's right, Mr. Chief\nJustice, but there's only two ways to do that. One way\nof doing that and the one that I hear them advocating\nwould be this impossible sort of process of trying to\nfingerprint or DNA test oil spills in a tributary to\nfigure out, yes, that's the guy that got it to the\nnavigable waters. And the one thing we know is that\nthere were some efforts to try to regulate pollution\nthat way before 1972 and they were a dismal failure.\nThe only other way to do it, as suggested by\none or two amici, is to treat the last -- treat the\ntributary as if it were a point source. But I'd sure\nhate to be the guy who owns the -- the land next to\nthat tributary that's dumping into the Mississippi\nwho's going to be responsible for the pollution of\neverybody upstream. And what Congress recognized in\n1972 is that they had to regulate beyond traditional\nnavigable waters.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the Congress in 1972\nalso, in its statement of policy, said it's a statement\nof policy to reserve to the States the power and the\nresponsibility to plan land use and water resources.\nAnd under your definition, I -- I just see that we're\ngiving no scope at all to that clear statement of a\ncongressional policy.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, Justice Kennedy,\nthe States still have plenary control over the non-\npoint source pollution. They still have an important\ncooperative role in -- in the overall program, as\nyou'll hear more about in the second case today. And I\nwould actually ask you to focus on one particular\nprovision that deals with the relationship between the\nFederal Government and the States under 404 in\nparticular, and that's section 404, subsection (g) of\nthe statute. And that was added to the statute in\n1977.\nUnless Congress is going to be construed to\nhave given the States a virtual empty set, that\nprovision makes crystal clear that the waters of the\nUnited States, for purposes of the Clean Water Act,\nextend beyond traditional navigable waters and their\nadjacent wetlands.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Though not necessarily as\nfar as storm drains. It would be enough to -- to say\nnavigable -- you know, non-navigable tributaries that\nare real -- real tributaries.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Absolutely, Justice Scalia. I\nconcede that. But then you get to the question of\ndefining real tributaries, and that's neither been teed\nup in this litigation, nor is it something that I\nthink, at the end of the day, you'd want to differ from\nthe Corps' judgment, which although you find it\nstriking that some things that are ditches are actually\nincluded in the system, that is a product of the way\nthat the tributary systems have worked, the way that\ncertain cities have taken over a natural stream and\nchannelized it and make it look like a ditch, but it's\npart of the system that carries water down from the\nheadwaters. And again, maybe that's an issue that we\ncan try to divine the limits to in a subsequent case.\nBut I think what's important, as -- as your\nvery comments suggest, is that trying to give meaning\nto that textual indication that Congress had clearly\nwanted to capture something beyond traditional\nnavigable waterways and their adjacent wetlands.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's a very vague\nindication. I mean, I -- I agree with you that your\nargument based on 404(g) is a strong one, but it -- it\nperhaps is weakened if you believe that in order to\nstretch to the -- to the limit of Federal jurisdiction,\nyou need a clear statement. I certainly wouldn't\nconsider 404(g) -- if -- if the act did not previously\ninclude the kind of authority you're arguing for, I\nwould not -- I would not consider 404(g) a clear\nstatement of that -- of that new -- new authority.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think even you would\nconcede it's a clear statement that something else must\nbe covered. Otherwise, other than is completely\nmeaningless in the statute. And so -- and -- and I --\nI grant you that it might not be a clear statement as\nto the nth tributary, and maybe that's a case on which\nwe can litigate in the future.\nBut I think what I would say is, for those of\nyour colleagues that want to look at the legislative\nhistory, it provides some additional context for 404(g)\nand makes it very clear that Congress, as this Court\nfound in both Riverside Bayview and in SWANCC, was\nspecifically focused on the coverage of adjacent\nwetlands. And it's very clear that they understood\nthat whatever scope of jurisdiction was given to the\nCorps, that it would bring along with it the adjacent\nwetlands. And so there was this long debate.\nAs I say, the legislative history I think\nmakes quite clear that they were meant to include\nthe non-navigable tributaries and a substantial amount\nof the non-navigable tributaries. And so, I mean, I\nwould invite others to look at that.\nI also think that, to get back to a point I\nmade earlier, one thing that's exceedingly clear from\nthat legislative history is nobody in 1977, including\nthose that were advocating restricting the scope of the\n404(g) program, wanted to restrict the EPA's\njurisdiction under 402. And so in the legislation that\nthey proposed that eventually found form in 404(g),\nthey expressly decoupled the 404 permitting process and\nits jurisdiction from the 402 process.\nPetitioners' argument, by contrast,\nnecessarily restricts the scope of both of those\nprograms because they are joined in the hip through\n301. And so if they're right that they can dredge and\nfill in these wetlands, then it is equally true that\nthey can dump toxic materials into those wetlands.\nIf I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Could you just say a word\nabout the -- the ditch -- sorry -- the word about the\nwetland next to a tributary that's separated by a man-\nmade object like a ditch? Are there many such\ninstances? It sounds to me like a scientific question.\nAre there many such instances where there is no\ntransfer of water? And in those instances, is the\npresence of water in the wetland anything more than a\ncoincidence?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Insofar as it seeks to serve\na purpose of the statute to regulate this.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: What I would say, Justice\nBreyer -- I -- I think I can answer the whole question\n-- is in the vast majority of cases, as I understand\nit, a berm will not have the effect of actually\npreventing all hydrological connection.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And where do I look to\nverify that scientific matter?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think a number of the amicus\nbriefs have addressed that. I wish I could point to\nyou a specific one.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. I can't find any\nquantitative assessment.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Oh, again, I didn't mean to\nsuggest a percentage. I just think that -- that -- let\nme put it to you this way, and this is the argument we\nobviously make in the brief. The best reason to think\nthat a man-made -- that a man-made berm or a natural\nberm is unlikely to prevent all hydrological flow is\neven those man-made structures that have as their\nexpress design to prevent water flow, like dikes and\nlevees and dams, have seepage and leakage from them.\nSo --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fine.\nNow suppose we take a set, which you think\nexists as not the null set, of instances where there is\nno such transfer, which your opponents say is this\ncase. Now what's the justification for regulating\nthose? If it's simply flood control because water\nflows over the top and sits there, I guess you could\nsay the same thing is true of any low depression, and\ntherefore, the presence of water would be just a\ncoincidence. Now, what's your -- the fact that they're\nwet doesn't have anything to do with it. It's the fact\nthat they're next to a place that floods that has to do\nwith it.\nNow, what's wrong with what I just said?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: What's wrong with what you\njust said is that wetlands have unique characteristics\nthat are different just from low-lying areas. And I think\nthis Court started to recognize that in the Riverside\nBayview case. And the image I would leave you with is\nthe image that wetlands actually act something like a\nsponge, and because of that characteristic, they play\ntwo important roles in helping to regulate the flow of\nthe adjacent water body.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay, I understand that.\nNow, what specifically, since I think this is\nscientific, do I look at to verify what you just said,\nnamely that a wet depression, even if there's no\ninterchange, has a lot to do with flood control that a\ndry depression wouldn't have? That's a scientific\nstatement. Where do I verify it?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: And, again, I mean, I would\ndirect you to the amicus briefs that discuss in length\nthe benefits of wetlands, but I understand you won't\nfind those --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I read them, and I -- I just\nperhaps wasn't reading them closely enough, but I just\ncan't find the verification directly there.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: And -- and I sense that you\nfound them lacking in that sense. I guess what I would\nsay is there's certainly anecdotal evidence in those\namicus briefs that I think is quite striking.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what am I supposed to\ndo with the case? I read them quickly. I don't\nnecessarily pick up everything. I'll read them again.\nBut if I don't find empirical verification for that\nstatement, what am I supposed to do with this case?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, not surprisingly, I would\nsuggest that you defer to the agency in its exercise of\nexpertise.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fine. And where did the\nagency, in its many, many proceedings over the course\nof 35 years, say what you just said, namely that a\nwetland acts as a sponge? It's very plausible to me.\nIt's just that there may be a need to drop a citation\nsomewhere.\n(Laughter.)\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, you -- and you could\ncite to the proceedings in this very case in the joint\nappendix because although they didn't use the sponge\nword, there was a specific finding in this case that\nthese wetlands played an important role in flood\ncontrol and pollution control for the adjacent streams.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if you wanted a\ncite for the opposite proposition, you could cite subsection\n(7) of the Corps' regulations where they have no\ninterest in wetlands that happen to be adjacent to\nother wetlands that are adjacent to the waters of the\nUnited States. If they act in the way that you've been\npostulating, presumably they'd want to cover those\nadjacent wetlands just as much as they want to cover\nthe wetlands that are next to the tributary, but they\ndon't.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, I don't think\nthat follows because if you read subsection (7), as I\ndo, as only excluding those wetlands that are adjacent\nto other isolated wetlands, then regulating those\nwetlands --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't -- it\ndoesn't say that. It says other than waters that are\nthemselves wetlands. It excludes all wetlands that are\nadjacent to wetlands that are adjacent to waters of the\nUnited States.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, and as I said, I think\nyou have to read that in the context not just of the\nrest of the regulations but of this Court's decision in\nRiverside Bayview. The one thing we know from\nRiverside Bayview is that it's not enough to simply say\nthat your parcel of wetlands is not adjacent to the\nnavigable waterway because in that case, as the Court\nremarked, it -- the parcel ended before it got to the\nadjacent navigable body of water and there was another\nwetland. There was a continuation of the same wetland.\nNow, I don't know whether you'd call that two adjacent\nwetlands. I might as a common locution. There might\nbe some different way of referring to that. But we\nknow that the one wetland was covered because that was\nthe holding of this Court in Riverside Bayview.\nSo I don't think I would give undue weight to\nthat reading of it especially when, if you read it as I\ndo, it makes perfect sense because a wetland adjacent\nto an otherwise isolated wetland is not going to have\nthe same role to play in flood control in terms of\nmonitoring the stream volume as a wetland adjacent to\nan otherwise regulable water body as you have at issue\nhere. And so I think that that regulatory decision\nthat the Corps has made is one that's perfectly\ndefensible and makes sense.\nAnd I think that -- again, I think one other\npoint that I want to note that's kind of specific to\nthis case is part of the reason why it makes sense to\nregulate a wetland adjacent to an otherwise regulable\nwater body, even if there is a berm present, is\nillustrated by this case because, as was alluded to,\nthe specific development plan at issue here -- and this\nis clear at joint appendix pages 95 and 160 -- would\nsever the berm and create the hydrological link between\na smaller, deeper wetland and the adjacent navigable\nwetland -- waterway system. And so, I mean, it doesn't\nmake a lot of sense, as Justice Stevens suggested, to\nhave a regulatory regime where you have a regulable\nwetland after but not before a construction project\nthat has the effect of vastly reducing the size of the\nwetland.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you say that the\nauthority of -- I don't -- I don't even think the Corps\nhas ever suggested this. The authority of the Corps\nextends not only to all that you've -- we've been\ntalking about and that you've asserted, but also to\nlands that, if altered, could have some hydrological\nconnection.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, that's not it, Justice\nScalia. What I'm saying is what the Corps has always\ndone for 30 years is said they are going to regulate a\nphysically proximate, adjacent wetland without regard\nto whether or not there's a berm there. I'm just\nmaking the subsidiary point that that makes sense\nbecause the very construction project that might be at\nissue might have the effect of changing the degree of\nthe hydrological connection.\nI want to be very clear, though. The\nhydrological connection has never been the sine qua non\nof the assertion of regulation authority over the\nadjacent wetlands.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is -- what is the basis\nfor their doing it? If there is currently no\nhydrological connection, there is a berm, there is no\n-- there is no connection to the navigable waters of\nthe United -- what could possibly be the basis for\ntheir asserting jurisdiction?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: The short answer is flood\ncontrol. If there is that berm that -- that allows the\nsponge to soak up water, either rainwater or waters\nfrom adjacent parcels, although I think in this case,\nit would largely be rainwater, that -- the fact that\nthere's a berm actually helps in the flood control.\nWhen you sever it, it changes the dynamic quite a bit\nbecause then it's somewhat less helpful for flood\ncontrol --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- but actually is earlier in\nterm -- plays a better role --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A statute could do that. A\nstatute could do that. But this statute requires that\nit be a water of the United States.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and when -- when\nthere is nothing but puddles that are isolated by a\nberm, even from the storm drain which goes to\ntributaries, I can't conceive of -- of how you could\nconsider that that's -- you know, at least where it\nleaks sometimes into the storm drain and went down to a\ntributary, I think it's an exaggeration, but maybe you\ncould call it a water of the United States. But where\nthere's a berm that prevents any water from going even\ninto the storm drain which then goes into a tributary,\nhow can you possibly consider that a water of the\nUnited States?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think the way I would\ndo it is you start with the tributary. And if you'll\nconcede for purposes of the illustration or the\nargument that that's a water of the United States, then\nwhat the Corps does as a jurisdictional regulation is\ntreat the adjacent wetland as a water of the United\nStates as well. That makes sense for two principal\nreasons.\nOne, in the overwhelming majority of cases,\nthere is going to be a hydrological connection.\nActually tracing out exactly what it is and how it\nworks is very difficult and not the kind of thing you'd\nwant to get into at the jurisdictional stage, and\nthat's why the Court said that was fine in footnote 9\nof Riverside Bayview.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's not the argument I\nwas addressing. I'm addressing the argument that in\nchanging the land, you may cause it to --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: And that's not an independent\nbasis for jurisdiction. It's simply an illustration of\nwhy disregarding the berm makes sense.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm happy to hear that.\nThat's all I was trying to establish. You -- you don't\nassert that that's an independent basis.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: It is not an independent basis.\nIt is part of the reason why, though, in the context\nof wetlands in particular, a focus on physical\nproximity and adjacency makes sense and a fixation on\nhydrological connection does not make sense.\nPart of the reason you can look at the record\nhere and find differing information about the extent of\nthe hydrological connection is that is not a term that\nis relevant for the regulatory scheme. And the same\nthing was equally true in Riverside Bayview itself. In\nfact, in Riverside Bayview, the district court made a\nfinding that the wetland there was hydrologically\nisolated from the adjacent streams. Now, as the\nSolicitor General pointed out in the petition at\nfootnote 7 in Riverside Bayview, we think the best\nunderstanding of what was meant there was that there\nwas no overtopping and that there was some drainage.\nBut that just illustrates the point that hydrological\nconnection is not a statutory term. It's not a\nregulatory term. It's a very loose term and it's not a\nterm the Corps has ever used in regulating adjacent\nwetlands.\nIt's important to stress that the regulation\nfor adjacent wetlands that is at issue here, subsection\n(7), is exactly the same regulation that was at issue\nin Riverside Bayview. As Justice Ginsburg pointed out,\nthe Court, when it framed the question presented,\nframed it in terms of whether or not the Corps could\nrationally regulate wetlands that were adjacent to\nnavigable waters and their tributaries. And when they\ngot to the holding, this Court approved the regulation\nand approved the fact that it asserted jurisdiction\nover wetlands adjacent to otherwise regulable waters.\nSo if the tributaries are otherwise regulable because\nthey are waters of the United States, it follows\ndirectly from Riverside Bayview that the adjacent\nwetlands are covered as well.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You -- you put a lot\nof weight on the tributary question in your approach by\ngiving up the hydrological connection. Your response\nis you don't need a hydrological connection because\nit's right next to a tributary. But for those of us\nwho are having a little trouble with the concept of\ntributary, you don't leave us much to fall back on.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, and -- and I'm -- I wish\nthat weren't the case, Mr. Chief Justice.\nWhat I would say, though, is that this case\nhas just not framed up the question of tributaries, and\nthat's because -- I mean, to put it more favorably to\nmy client, the other side has never taken issue with\nthe fact that their wetlands are adjacent to\ntributaries. And I think that's -- that's obvious for\na couple of reasons. I mean, first of all, if you look\nat the property in Carabell, it's just a mile from Lake\nSt. Clair. It's right next to a substantial drainage\nditch which connects to a navigable water, Auvase\nCreek, and then into Lake St. Clair. In fact, it's\nkind of ironic, but the property in Riverside Bayview\nwas also a mile away from Lake St. Clair. So it's very\nsimilar.\nIf you look at the three sites at issue in\nRapanos, one is right next to the Pine River. One of\nthe others -- the whole point of the dredge and fill\noperation was to drain the wetland through the adjacent\ntributary systems so the water would go away. And in\nthe third one, there also isn't an issue about whether\nor not those are tributaries. In a different case,\nthat might be an appropriate focus for inquiry.\nThe last thing, I would say a couple of\npoints before I sit down. I do think, first, that\nsection 404(g) of the statute is very important because\nit is the clearest textual indication that Congress\nintended to regulate something beyond traditional\nnavigable waterways and their adjacent wetlands. And\nas this Court itself remarked in SWANCC, the single\nmost likely candidate are the non-navigable\ntributaries.\nThe second point to emphasize is that the\nscope of the Corps' 404 jurisdiction is the same as the\nEPA's 402 jurisdiction. They are joined at the hip\nthrough the basic prohibition under section 301. So a\nconclusion that somehow certain tributaries are excised\nfrom the tributary system for purposes of 404 is\nlikewise excising those tributaries and creating a\nsituation where you can have a -- a free dump zone at\nsome point above the -- above what somebody might put\nas the limits of the navigable waterway system or the\ntributary system. And I think that is something that\neven the proponents of narrowing the Corps'\njurisdiction in 1977 could not countenance.\nThe last point I would make is that there are\ngoing to be real-world consequences to contracting the\njurisdiction of the Corps and the EPA to pre-1972 or,\nreally, pre-1899 levels, especially for the downstream\nStates. I think it's a bit much to ask a legislator in\nWisconsin or in Minnesota to stop local development in\norder to protect the water quality and flood control\npropensities of the Mississippi River in Mississippi.\nThat's why it was manifest in 1972 that there was a\nneed for a Federal solution to this problem. That\nFederal solution includes as two of its most important\ncomponents first getting at water pollution at its\nsource, at the point source, and secondly, covering the\ntributary system without which the navigable waters\nwill continue to be polluted.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\nMr. Hopper, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF M. REED HOPPER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 04-1034\nMR. HOPPER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Hopper, I hope you're\ngoing to tell us what you make of section 404(g).\nMR. HOPPER: I'd be happy to. In -- in Solid\nWaste Agency, this Court looked at 404(g) and\ndetermined that it had -- it was not enlightening as to\nthe meaning of navigable waters under 404(a) because\nCongress did not define other waters in any way. And\nthis Court likewise concluded that 404(g) was simply\nnot before it and would not draw any conclusion from\nit. So I submit that it is really irrelevant.\nI note -- I want to draw this Court's\nattention to our footnote 1 in our reply where we point\nout that -- that in every formal rulemaking, the Corps\nand the EPA have excluded drainage ditches from the\ndefinition of tributary. It is here and now that these\nagencies are redefining the term tributary to include\nanything in the hydrological chain. The Sixth Circuit\ndecision says that any hydrological connection suffices\nas a significant nexus to bring in wetlands under\nFederal jurisdiction.\nOf course, in -- in page 31 of the\nopposition, the Government argues that neither the\ndirectness -- excuse me -- nor the substantiality of a\ntributary's connection to traditional navigable waters\nis relevant to the jurisdictional inquiry. It's simply\nnot true that the Government is only identifying\nchannelized conduits as tributaries. Anywhere water\nflows is a tributary in their book.\nLet me also address something that this Court\ndid in SWANCC. It was not the lack of a hydrological\nconnection in that case that informed this Court's\ndecision to exclude those isolated ponds from Federal\njurisdiction. It was the fact that those -- that the\nregulation of those isolated ponds did not meet the\nterms of the act and there was no clear indication\nCongress intended to regulate isolated ponds. I submit\nthat's this case. In this case, there is no clear\nindication that Congress intended to regulate wetlands\n20 miles from the nearest navigable water.\nThe --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: We're told that one of\nthem was much closer.\nMR. HOPPER: The -- the record is silent as\nto the distance between --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the Pine River?\nAre you -- that's not 20 miles away, is it?\nMR. HOPPER: We don't know how far that is\nbecause the record is silent as to the distance between\nthose water bodies.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know? The -- the\nSolicitor General represented to us that it was very\nclose. Are you disputing that as a matter of fact?\nMR. HOPPER: I don't know what he means by\nvery close. The -- the Solicitor General would agree\nwith me that -- that there's nothing in the record to\nindicate what those distances are.\nAnd it's irrelevant in -- in our opinion\nwhether it's -- whether it's a mile or 20 miles or 50\nmiles or 100 miles, and that's the point. There does\n-- under the -- under the Federal regulations a true,\nsignificant nexus is not required, just any\nhydrological connection. This is a presumption on\ncongressional authority.\nThis expansive interpretation destroys any\ndistinction between what is national and what is local\nunder -- as -- as has already been pointed out. Under\nthe Federal regulations, you can't dig a ditch in this\ncountry without Federal approval. You can't fill it\nin. You can't clean it out without Federal approval.\nThis reads the term navigable right out of the statute.\nWe -- we ask this Court not to allow these\nagencies --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, when we're\ntalking about the scope of -- of Federal power, we're\nnot merely concerned with dumping refuse in the creek,\nbut also deliberate attempts to poison the water\nsystem.\nMR. HOPPER: Congress -- Congress considered\nall this when it made its policy decision to defer to\nthe States to address this. The States have the\nability and the will to -- to protect their own waters\nfrom pollutants of any kind. And as I indicated\nearlier, all the States have antipollution regulations.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No. The fact that the\nStates have the power and the interest does not\nnecessarily mean that the Federal Government does not\nalso have the power.\nMR. HOPPER: My time is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You may respond\nbriefly.\nMR. HOPPER: Congress determined that it\nwould defer to the States instead of exercising any\nfurther power beyond its channels authority.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
