        "content": "(11:26 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Case 07-371, Taylor versus Sturgell.\nMs. Rosenbaum.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ADINA ROSENBAUM\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. ROSENBAUM: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nIt is the basic principle of American law\nthat a lawsuit does not decide the rights of\nnon-parties. That basic principle has a few narrow\nexceptions, none of which applies here.\nTaylor had no involvement in the prior case.\nHe had no legal relationship with any parties to that\ncase. And no party to that case had the legal authority\nto represent him.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you have a\nsituation where it is an associational standing case,\nand an individual is the one that's relied upon give the\nassociation standing, in that case is the individual,\neven though he's not bringing the suit, is he barred by\nthe association's case?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: I think that would depend on\nwhether the association in that case had the authority\nto bring that case on behalf of that individual.\nIn order for a person to be bound on the\nbasis of representation in the prior case, the party to\nthe prior case had to have the authority to bring the\ncase on behalf of that other person. It had to be a\nrepresentational relationship where the party for the\nfirst case is exercising the authority to represent the\nlater case. And there has to be a relationship that\nexists at the time of the first litigation.\nSomeone can't retroactively be represented\nduring the first litigation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What if you had a case and\nthere's a suspicion of something like that that's here,\nalthough the courts below did not so find? What if you\nhad a case in -- like this in which the first litigant\nsaid to the second, I brought my case and I lost. I\nwant you to try again for me? And if you do and you\nwin, I will give you a job making use of the fruits of\nthe litigation?\nWould there be an estoppel in that case?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: No, not just on those facts.\nAnd I do want to emphasize --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why.\nMS. ROSENBAUM: -- first that is a big shift\nfrom what was decided blow. What the court held below\nwas that Herrick represented Taylor in the previous\ncase. It did not hold that Taylor was somehow\nrepresenting Herrick in this case.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It held, as I recall,\nspecifically, I think, that there was no collusion\nfound. And the suggestion was that if collusion had\nbeen found -- and I was giving you an example of\nsomething that I would call collusion at least -- that\nthe result might have been different.\nMS. ROSENBAUM: Collusion is sort of a\npejorative way of saying an agreement. An agreement can\nbe -- can lead to preclusion under a certain\ncircumstances instances, but for --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why wouldn't my example\nhave done so? In my example the agreement was I lost;\nplease try again for me. And if you win, I'm going to\ngive you a job making use of the fruits of the lawsuit.\nWould that agreement not have been enough\nto -- to sustain a collusion here?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: No, not without the party to\nthe first case controlling the second case. But this\nCourt does not --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why should that -- why\nshould that matter?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: Because what's being\nprotected here is the person's right to the opportunity\nto be heard on their claim. And in that case --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But --\nMS. ROSENBAUM: -- second claim.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The claim that\nJustice Souter has posited is not one that the second\nperson would have been -- he was soliciting. He was\nsolicited to be a plaintiff in that second case. That\nis not the case that is involved here. As far as we\nknow --\nMS. ROSENBAUM: Exactly.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: As far as we know, Taylor\ndidn't even know about the first case. He brings the\nsecond case. There is no indication that it was\nsolicited by Herrick. So I don't know why you're even\nreaching the case where someone -- someone is -- you say\nhas to be controlled, but why are we getting into the\ndetails of such a situation when we have no\nsolicitation?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: Exactly. This Court does\nnot need to decide what sort of solicitation or\nrecruitment or agreement would reasonably --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right. But if we adopted\n-- as I understand it, if we adopted your theory across\nthe board, it would preclude -- it would preclude a\npreclusion in the case of my hypothetical, and that's\nwhat I want to get at.\nShould we, by adopting your theory,\neliminate the possibility of preclusion in the case that\nI put to you?\nAnd you're saying, I guess: Well, if --\neven there, there should be no preclusion unless the\nfirst party controlled the case in the -- controlled the\nsecond case.\nAnd my question is: Why?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: Well, again, that's a\nquestion of whether that second party is acting as an\nagent for the first party and really just trying to\nrelitigate that first party's opportunity to be heard.\nAnd if the second party is an agent, then the second\nparty can be precluded.\nBut, again, exactly what would constitute\nthat agency is not something that this Court needs to\ndecide, because the facts here do not demonstrate that\nTaylor was representing Herrick in this case.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do you think that the\ncollusion point was perhaps just ill-phrased here?\nThere was no collusion, certainly, in the sense that\nthere was any kind of secret dealing going on.\nThe second lawsuit, the people involved in\nit, couldn't Taylor -- couldn't have been more candid, I\nguess, about what was going on. And so there was no\ncollusion in the sense of concealment or\nunderhandedness.\nDo you think that is perhaps the reason that\nthe court of appeals found that there was no collusion;\nand that, therefore, we ought to discount that finding?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: Well, I think the court of\nappeals found that there was no collusion because the\nfacts that are in the record about the relationship\nbetween Taylor and Herrick do not demonstrate that there\nwas any collusion.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, didn't the court of\nappeals actually say there was no collusion, or did it\nsay, we don't need to reach that question?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: It said that the facts were\nambiguous, and it did not need to decide it. But it\nalso specifically said that on the facts before it, that\nTaylor could have brought an entirely separate,\nindependent case, separate from Herrick. So --\nJUSTICE ALITO: So these facts do not\nnecessarily show collusion to avoid the preclusive\neffects of Herrick?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: We do not need to determine\nwhether they count as tactical maneuvering. They did\nfind -- they did say there was a close working\nrelationship relative to the successive cases. Didn't\nthey say that?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: They did say that. But,\nagain, that just brings up the question of what sort of\nrelationship is necessary for the -- there to be\npreclusion.\nAnd many people have close relationships but\nthat does not necessarily mean that those people are\nbound, or expect to be bound, by decisions in each\nothers' cases, particularly --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But here the close\nrelationship seems to boil down to this, and you correct\nme if I'm wrong here because I may be missing some fact.\nBut it is inconceivable to me that any\nreason for Taylor's participation or Taylor's bringing\nthis lawsuit could be found except the reason of trying\nto relitigate Herrick's lawsuit so that Taylor would\nthen either get the job or have an easier time\nfulfilling the job of fixing up the airplane.\nI can't think of any other reason on the\nfacts as I understand them from the briefs.\nIs there a -- on the facts of case, any\nother possible reason?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: Yes. First, I just want to\npoint out that there was no agreement, or the record\ndoes not show and there was no agreement between them to\nactually work on the plane.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But why else would\nhe be doing -- why else would he have been doing this?\nWhat does the record show as another possible\nexplanation?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: Taylor is the executive\ndirector of the Antique Aircraft Association, and he is\nsomeone who is interested in antique aircraft and in\naviation generally. And after reading Herrick's\ndecision -- his explanation in the motion for discovery\nfor filing his FOIA request is that he read the decision\nin Herrick, and that he understood it to mean that he\nwas legally entitled to the records. And so --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't need a reason to\nfile a FOIA request anyway, right? Just the naked\ncuriosity justifies your obtaining the documents, right?\nI mean this is a lawsuit that does not require a reason\nexcept I want the documents. You've got them. I'm\nentitled to them.\nMS. ROSENBAUM: Yes. It requires the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean somebody could have\nwalked in off the street and filed this same lawsuit,\nright?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: Anyone who was interested in\nthe record could file a FOIA request for them.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if somebody walked in\noff the street and began this lawsuit and had absolutely\nno connection with Herrick, and so on, the issue of\npreclusion wouldn't come up, or at least it wouldn't\ncome up in the context that it comes up here.\nBut this isn't somebody who walked in off\nthe street, and the claim is there is a preclusion\ndoctrine because of the relationship between party one\nand party two. And the fact that anybody who comes in\noff the street could have asked -- could have made the\nsame request, in effect, is not an answer to the\ncollusion claim; is it?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: Well, it shows that the\nproblem, if it exists, of there being repeated\nlitigation over the same records is not one that would\nbe solved through preclusion. And Respondents have not\nshown there actually is a problem with repeated\nlitigation over the same records. And the Department of\nJustice represents the defendants in all FOIA cases, so\nthey would be able to know if that was a problem that\ncame up again and again.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about if it is\nthe executive director of the association, and the suit\nis brought in the name the association, and they lose.\nCan he bring suit as, you know, I'm just Joe Blow, but I\nhappen to be the executive director, but I'm bringing\nthis in my own name?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: The question -- that would\nthen come down to whether or not he controlled the first\ncase, because one of the categories in which people are\nbound by prior litigation in which they were not\nthemselves parties, is if they had control over the\nfirst case and had the full and fair opportunity to\nlitigate in that case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let's say that\nit is somebody above him, you know, the president of the\nassociation, who decides what lawsuits are brought, and\nhe's just the executive director?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: But he was not in control of\nthe first case and did not get his opportunity to be\nheard in that case --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But he recommended\nto the president, said we ought to file this lawsuit.\nThe president said okay, and they did, and then they\nlost. Can he go ahead as an individual?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: If he was not in control of\nthat first case, yes, he could go ahead as an individual\nif he was not -- if he is not representing the\nassociation in the second case, but is, instead,\nrepresenting himself.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And could he continue to\nsolicit other members of the association to file FOIA\nsuits all over the country until they finally got a\nfavorable decision?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: Well, that would come down\nto what the definition of \"solicit\" was and whether\nthose people were acting as agents of that person who is\ndoing the soliciting.\nBut, again, this Court does not need to\ndecide exactly what sort of solicitation would create\nthat agency relationship, because the facts in the\nrecord here do not show that that is what happened here.\nAnd also FOIA is set up to allow there to be\nrepeated litigation over the same records. Under FOIA,\nevery requester has -- every person has the right to\nrequest records. And once they have requested those\nrecords and been denied them, they have suffered a\nconcrete and particular injury; and they have the right\nto seek judicial review of that injury.\nSo that makes this case different from the\ntaxpayer standing in -- cases cited --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that means\nyour statement implicates very serious questions of\nstanding under Article III, whether Congress can say\ncreate the injury by saying you've been denied records\nand, therefore, you have standing. I think that's -- I\nwouldn't go ahead assuming that that was correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Although it is not really\njust your argument; it is also FOIA; isn't it?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: That is the way Congress set\nup FOIA is to -- to give people that statutory\nentitlement to the records.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And it does cover idle\ncuriosity. I mean, I suppose if anyone in the courtroom\nwere to file a request for the same information, there\ncould be no argument that there would be any kind of\npreclusion just because it's been heard before.\nMS. ROSENBAUM: Exactly. And if there were\nsome problem with people -- with there being multiple\nrequests for the same records, that would be a problem\nfor Congress to solve. And Congress has all sorts of\ncreative ways of solving problems when it thinks that\nthey are, in fact, problems.\nIt can channel all litigation into one court\nor into one court of appeals like it does for patent\ncases to more easily create precedent, or it didn't have\nto create FOIA to create this statutory, individual\nentitlement to begin with.\nIt could have sent up FOIA more like a qui\ntam case in which one person did represent the whole\npublic or the government in requesting records.\nBut that's not what Congress did. Congress\ndid give every person the right to records and the right\nto seek judicial review when they were denied records.\nAnd we can disagree about whether that was something\nCongress should have done, but that is what Congress did\nand Congress's chosen scheme should not be altered\nthrough the back door of preclusion doctrine.\nThe amorphous factors used by the lower courts to hold\nTaylor bound also have their problems in terms of\njudicial efficiency and people coming into court. Those\nfactors do not give guidance either to lower courts or\nto litigants themselves about who can be bound.\nI mean, a -- in a threshold area like res\njudicata, it is particularly important to have clear\nrules about who can be bound, to move on quickly to the\nmerits of the case, without having to go through a lot\nof collateral litigation; but the factors used by the\ncourt of appeals do not provide those clear rules. And\nthey also don't provide clear rules to litigants about\nwhen they will, in fact, be bound by -- when, in fact,\nthey will be bound by a case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What are your clear rules?\nGive me -- set it forth clearly, what you think it\ntakes. Number one, do -- do you have to know you're\ngoing to be bound at the time the first suit is brought?\nThat isn't the requirement, is it?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: No. There are certain legal\nrelationships that would not require someone to be -- to\nknow even of the case at the first suit. For example, a\nsuccessor in interest to property can buy the property\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMS. ROSENBAUM: -- after the first suit, yet\nis nonetheless bound by the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So what are your tests?\nHow many? Five? Four? It is not a totality of the\ncircumstances, test though, right?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: No, it's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You have some criteria.\nWhat are they?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: There are an --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Agency?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: Well, agency would fall into\na larger category of, that there are certain Legal\nrelationships that treat people as the same person for\nres judicata purposes and often for other purposes; and\nthose are substantive relationships created by\nunderlying substantive law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMS. ROSENBAUM: People can also be bound\nwhen they have -- have had their full and fair\nopportunity to litigate in the prior case, through some\ninvolvement in that case. So for example, in Montana\nversus United States this Court held that the government\nwas bound because it had controlled the contractor who\nbrought the prior case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMS. ROSENBAUM: And then people can be bound\nwhen they were represented in the prior case. And in\nthat case, they did have their opportunity to be heard\nin the prior case just through a representative.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A representative that they\nagreed to?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: Exactly. Someone who had\nthe authority --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: As in a class action, where\nthey have the -- the ability to bow out if they want,\nright?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: Well, a class action is a\nvery good example of that representational relationship,\nand the court of appeals in this case used language that\nis very similar to the rationales used for class\nactions, talking about identity of interests and\nadequacy of representation, but it did not include any\nof the protections that are inherent in class actions:\nthe factors that need to be looked at to make sure that\nclass treatment is appropriate. The specification of\nwho is and is not in the class.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. I mean, and the\nindividual's ability to withdraw from the class, if he\ndoesn't want to be bound by this suit, right?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That is crucial.\nMS. ROSENBAUM: That is crucial in class\nactions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the judge's\nobligation to look out for the trial to see, for\nexample, any settlement has to be approved by the judge\nto make sure it is fair to the absent class members.\nMS. ROSENBAUM: Yes. That was absent here\nalso. In this situation, no one understood that first\ncase to be litigating the rights of anyone but\nMr. Herrick. Mr. Herrick did not understand that that's\nwhat was happening. The Tenth Circuit did not\nunderstand that was what was happening, and Taylor did\nnot understand what was happening.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If this case had been one\nin which were notice, before the suit was filed -- or at\nthe outset of the suit, and some encouragement to go\nahead with the suit, would that have fit your, I guess,\nsecond category of adequate representation, adequate\nopportunity to have your -- a case heard?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: The category of having the\nfull and fair opportunity --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.\nMS. ROSENBAUM: To litigate to the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: From a fair --\nMS. ROSENBAUM: Case -- no. And --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that is because?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: That is because that would\nbasically be setting up a system of mandatory voluntary\nintervention.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But why doesn't that fit\nat least the semantic version of the category you gave\nus?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: Because that person still is\nnot receiving -- is not fully and fairly litigating that\ncase. They are not involved in that case, under that\nhypothetical. And they're not in control of that case.\nMerely knowing about a case, knowing that\none could voluntarily intervene is not enough.\nAnd this Court has stated --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Your list of factors is\ncumulative? They are not independent categories? Your\ncategory number 2 then is not a stand-alone category for\nbarring -- for barring the second plaintiff?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: It can be in certain\ncircumstances. Just because a --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The word that we use is\nprivity. If you are in privity with somebody else, you\ncan -- that's a pre-existing legal relationship.\nMS. ROSENBAUM: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: As the beneficiary and\nthe trustee.\nMS. ROSENBAUM: But --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but that's not\nwhat -- that's not what your second category was. I\nunderstand privity, but you didn't -- you weren't just\ntrying to restate the concept of privity in your second\ncategory, were you?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: The category talking\nabout --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.\nMS. ROSENBAUM: Full and fair litigation?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Right. Otherwise you\nwould have just said privity.\nMS. ROSENBAUM: Well, the problem with the\nterm \"privity\" is that privity is often used as somewhat\nat the conclusion --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Right.\nMS. ROSENBAUM: -- to mean that someone is\nbound by the prior case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Right.\nMS. ROSENBAUM: What is generally meant by\nthe privity, or often -- the way the word is often used\nto mean that a substantive legal relationship, but lower\ncourts have sometimes put the control cases in the\ncategory of privity. They have sometimes put the\nadequate representation cases in the category of\nprivity. So just talking about privity, it -- doesn't\nreally give the bounds of who would be bound by --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We can use it accurately,\nbring it back to what it really means --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can we?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if you have a\nsituation where a client has retained a law firm to do\nsomething and the law firm as part of its normal\nactivity files a FOIA request? They think something\nuseful is going to come up there, and it's denied, and\nthe law firm on its own, and not as the -- not as\nretained by the company files a FOIA suit?\nIn that case, is the company bound by the\ndetermination in the case? Or can they then file\nanother action?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: Who would -- if the company\nfiled its own FOIA case, we request on behalf --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, the law firm --\nthe law firm files its own FOIA request, and it is\ndenied, and they litigate that, and then they lose, and\nthe company brings a FOIA action.\nMS. ROSENBAUM: And the law firm brought it\non behalf of the law firm --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMS. ROSENBAUM: But the company is bringing\nit on behalf of the company?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMS. ROSENBAUM: Then they are separate\nrequestors who each have -- who have their own\nopportunity to be heard on their own FOIA claim.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even if company is\nrepresented by the same law firm?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: Yes. Even if they're\nrepresented by the same law firm.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Which is the case here.\nIt is the statement lawyer that's involved?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: Yes. But --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But in the case of the\nChief's hypothetical, of course, it would never come up,\nif the client sends another lawyer to bring this. But\nthere's no automatic preclusion in that relationship as\nthere is in the traditional relationship.\nMS. ROSENBAUM: Well, people are not\ngenerally precluded because of their lawyers' actions in\nprior cases. And this Court --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But -- I guess to be\nfair to my hypothetical, it was the company that was\npaying for what the law firm was doing. It just wasn't\nthe -- the filing of the suit. The law firm went off on\nit own. Maybe it does it all the time when they have a\ncase, they think this might be helpful and they are\nfiling a FOIA request.\nMS. ROSENBAUM: The question there would\ncome down to whether the company was representing the --\nwhether the law firm in that instance was representing\nthe company with the authority to be representing the\ncompany. In that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it purely a\nformal inquiry? In other words, let's say the company\nis paying the law firm to represent, but the law firm\njust filed in its own name? Does that make a\ndifference?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: I think it would go to the\nunderlying agreement between the law firm and the\ncompany and whether the company had somehow given the\nlaw firm authority to be filing this FOIA request and\nthen filing the lawsuit.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why isn't that not like\nMontana, where the government was not a party to the\ncase but it was in control of what the contractor was\ndoing?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: Right. Again, if the\ncompany was in control, and I think there would have to\nbe that sort of agreement that it was represented --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think you'd also say that\nif the company paid for the suit. The company just --\n\"I don't want to be in control of it. I don't want you\nto sue in my name, but I think this is a good thing for\nyou to do, so I'll pay for it.\"\nMS. ROSENBAUM: I think that could be an\nindicator that the company was -- that the law firm was\nrepresenting the company.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. No. The company says,\n\"absolutely I do not want you to represent me.\" That is\nin -- in a letter. Okay?\nSo it's clear that the law firm is not\nrepresenting the company, but the company thinks that\nit's a good idea to have this lawsuit and yeah, I'll\nbankroll it.\nMS. ROSENBAUM: If the law firm does not\nhave the authority to represent the company, then it's\nhard to see how the company could be bound by a\ndecision --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You don't think that\nsomebody who finances -- who solicits a litigation,\nrecruits someone to bring the case, pays for it, and\nthen says, \"I recruited a very good law firm, so I can\nstay out of it. I'm not going to try to -- I don't know\nanything about the law, I'm not going to try to manage\nthis case.\" But someone who recruits the firm and pays\nfor it wouldn't be bound.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think you've got to give\nthat one away.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. ROSENBAUM: I think that that's a harder\ninstance. And that really goes back to why it means\nto --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's a company\n--\nMS. ROSENBAUM: -- control a case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let's say some\ngroup, say, Public Citizen Litigation Group sends a\nfundraising thing around saying we think all our members\nought to contribute to a special fund so that we can\nbring a lawsuit under FOIA. Are all of those individual\ncontributors then bound by the result?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: No.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it make as\ndifference if it's one company as opposed to 40 donors?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: Well, again it comes back to\nwhether those people have given the person bringing the\ncase the authority to represent them in that lawsuit.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then in the\nprevious hypothetical there was no authority to\nrepresent. They just said, \"I think this is a good\nidea, here's the money. Here.\"\nMS. ROSENBAUM: Yes, and I still think in\nthat situation there also would not be preclusion.\nBut the questions of when someone controls a\nprior case are very different from what happened here\nwhere there was no notice of that prior litigation, but\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, controls. So\nthere are three companies, and they each have -- you\nknow, they can vote. They each have 33-percent control.\nAre they each bound, or because they didn't control it\nnone of them are bound?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: If they had not given the\nlaw firm the authority to represent them in that\nparticular case, then they are not bound.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they said,\nyes, you can represent us, and we're three different\ncompanies, and, you know, it's a majority vote as to\nwhat you can do.\nMS. ROSENBAUM: Well, then that is sort of\nstandard representation by a law firm of a company, and\nthose people would be legally represented in that\nlawsuit, have had their day in court and would be bound\nby that decision.\nUnless there are further questions, I would\nlike to reserve the rest of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMS. ROSENBAUM: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:\nMr. Hallward-Driemeier.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nAlthough the precise formulation adopted by\nthe court of appeals may be somewhat novel, its holding\nof a finding of privity here is consistent with\nwell-established principles of res judicata. Where\nmultiple persons engage in coordinated successive\nlitigation to vindicate a joint interest with respect to\nwhich a judgment in favor of any of them will benefit\nall, then a judgment in the first litigation in which\nthat interest is adequately represented finds the others\nas well.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you explain to me\nhow that could possibly work?\nI can understand that you're making an\nargument that the second case, there was a recruitment,\nthere was collusion or whatever. But for all we know\nfrom this record, how could Taylor possibly be bound\nwhen Herrick's suit is over? Because as far as we know,\nTaylor never heard of that first case. How can somebody\nbe bound by a litigation in which they had no notice, no\nopportunity to be heard?\nSo if we freeze the situation at the of case\none, how could Taylor possibly be bound?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I think it's\nimportant to start by recognizing that even Petitioner\nacknowledges that there can be circumstances in which\nTaylor would be bound, even though at the time, at the\nend of Herrick's litigation, he had no notice, he had\nnot participated. And that is, on their view and ours\nas well, that if Herrick had thereafter created an\nagency relationship with Taylor, and Taylor then as\nagent went and brought the second FOIA suit --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Because he's asking for\nHerrick who is bound by the first case.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right.\nAnd -- but all of that can exist or be created after the\nfirst litigation is over. And so the absence of notice\nin the first case --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Because what you're\nsaying is the person who is really in the second case is\nthe same person who was in the first case, and Taylor is\nsimply acting as an agent to give Herrick another\nchance?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's -- that's\nright.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But we're talking about\nbinding Taylor.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well -- but Taylor\nin the second suit that he brings as agent to advance\nthe interests of Herrick would be bound. Taylor would\nbe barred. His suit would be --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was no finding of\nthat. There was no finding here of agency relationship.\nThere was no finding of collusion. That would be a\ndifferent case.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I don't --\nthe court certainly did not find that there was no\ncollusion. I agree that the court didn't reach --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No. It said it wasn't\nreaching that question.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: It didn't reach the\nquestion of what they called \"tactical maneuvering.\"\nI think that there is a -- a strong argument\ncould be made that Taylor was Herrick's agent; but I\ndon't think that it's critical to find that he was his\nagent in the very technical sense of the Restatement of\nAgency.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If he -- if he was his\nagent -- and this goes to Justice Ginsburg's line of\ninquiry -- suppose in the second case Herrick tells him\nI want you to bring a suit on my behalf. He says fine,\nI'll do that. He brings that suit. And then Taylor\nsays, you know, I also want to bring a suit on my own.\nAnd he brings another suit, not as agent for Herrick.\nI suppose he could do that, couldn't he?\nThe first would be thrown out because it's Herrick's\nsecond suit. But the -- Taylor's own suit would remain\nTaylor's own suit, wouldn't it?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: No. No, Taylor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So long as there's no more\ncollusion or anything else, he's --\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: If Taylor brought\nthe second suit in his own name and it was found to be\nbarred by res judicata, a third suit in Taylor's own\nname would likewise be barred.\nAnd there's a case that I think illustrates\nthis point perhaps better than any of those we cited on\nour brief, unfortunately. But I think it's helpful --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I hope so.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: -- because --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor, I\nthink that it proves the point that has been the sort of\nunderlying concern of many of the questions: What\nhappens when you're just shy of a true agency\nrelationship?\nAnd the case is United States versus Des\nMoines Valley Railroad. It's an Eighth Circuit case, 84\nF.40 from 1897. But importantly, this Court quoted it\nat length in the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific\nRailroad versus Schendel case --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did you make your\nfriend on the other side aware that you'd be --\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Yes. Yes, I did,\nYour Honor.\nThe Schendel case is 270 U.S. 611. And they\ndiscuss Des Moines Valley at page 619.\nAnd what had happened in Des Moines Valley\nwas that the United States had granted some land to the\nState of Iowa, which in turn passed to the railroad,\nwhich in turn sold to one claimant. There was another\nperson who claimed directly from the United States as a\nhomesteader. There had been litigation between the\nperson claiming via the railroad and the homesteader as\nto who had title to the land. And the judgment in State\ncourt was adverse to the homesteader.\nAnd what happened later, about 10 years\nlater, was that the United States brought suit to have\ndeclared invalid the title of the person claiming via\nthe railroad. And the district court actually initially\nquestioned whether the United States had standing to\nbring the case at all. They viewed it as Fairchild's\ncase. That was the homeowner -- the homesteader, a\nlittle coincidence with this case, which also has a\nFairchild.\nBut the court of appeals specifically said\nit wasn't deciding whether the United States had\nstanding to bring the case in its own name -- the case\nwas litigated by the United States attorney -- they\nlooked to the purpose that the United States sought to\nvindicate. They said that the United States does not\nseek to obtain title to this property for itself again.\nThey are, in a sense, lending their name to allow\nFairchild a second bite at the apple.\nNow, there was no control that Fairchild had\nover the United States. Fairchild didn't direct the\nUnited States attorney who was representing the United\nStates. But the United States had taken up the interest\nof Fairchild, taking advantage of the fact that it had\nstanding to sue itself --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's a -- it's a standard\nprivity case. It is privity in reverse. I suppose a\nsubsequent owner of real estate is in privity with, and\ntherefore, bound by a judgment concerning the real\nestate rendered against the prior owner.\nBut it's probably also true that when\nthere's a suit by a later owner, the prior owner cannot\nthen bring in court a claim based upon the same -- the\nsame matters that the subsequent owner relied on.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's up privity instead of\ndown privity. Wouldn't that --\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I think what Your\nHonor is reacting to is the reality of the situation\nseems to be that there's a sufficient relationship\nbetween these two that they ought to be barred. But\nthere is no section of the Restatement (Second) that\nspecifically governs this case. And Petitioner's view,\nwhich is that somehow the Restatement (Second) has\nbecome codification of res judicata law would not permit\nit.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There is in the -- in the\nRestatement of Judgment, as far as I know, all of the\nexamples involve a representational relationship that\nexisted at the time of the first litigation. There's\nnothing in the Restatement that suggests that preclusion\nwould be proper here.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor, I\nagree that the Restatement (Second) does not, for\nexample, state the law which we all know and which\nPetitioner concedes is the case, and that is that the\nagent who brings the second lawsuit is bound, even if\nthe agency relationship arose --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but here --\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: -- after the first\nrelation was concluded.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you agree with me\nabout the facts that we're dealing with here? As far as\nthe first case is concerned, no evidence that Taylor\neven knew that Herrick was -- Herrick was bringing that\nsuit?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: What the evidence\nshows is that Herrick made Taylor aware of the -- of the\noutcome of the litigation, but we don't have --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- and while the\nlitigation is ongoing, Taylor doesn't know about it,\nright?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: There's no evidence\nof that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Okay. And is there any\nevidence that Herrick asked Taylor to file a FOIA\nrequest --\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- after Herrick lost his\ncase?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The evidence is\nthat Herrick asked Taylor to help him fix the plane, the\nplane and its restoration being the object of Herrick's\nown FOIA case. Taylor, in order to get those documents,\nwhich were essential --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that wasn't my\nquestion.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: -- to the\nrestoration of the plane --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: My question,\nMr. Hallward-Driemeier, is: Did Herrick ask Taylor to\nfile that FOIA suit? And I think your answer is no.\nThere's no evidence of that.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: There is no\nevidence that Herrick asked Taylor specifically to file\nthe --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any evidence\nthat Herrick financed the litigation?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The -- there is no\nspecific evidence of that. The counsel on the other\nside --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any evidence\nthat Herrick called any of the shots in that litigation?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, counsel on\nthe other side filed an affidavit that said -- it was\nvery carefully crafted, I think -- that there was no\nattorney-client relationship with Herrick with respect\nto this --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In any case, the decision\nthat we're reviewing didn't find any of those things.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: No, that's right.\nWhat the court of appeals relied on was the fact that\nTaylor had made Herrick's interest his own and brought\nthe suit in order to vindicate the exact same interests\nthat Herrick, himself, had already litigated and lost.\nAnd that was to get the documents to restore Herrick's\nplane.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So if another member of\nthe club, let's say another member of the aviation\nassociation who's interested in antique planes, just\nfiles a FOIA request, would that person be precluded who\nis -- who knows that Herrick brought a suit and lost?\nHe's just a member of the club. He doesn't want to help\nHerrick restore the plane.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: No, that person is\nnot barred. And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if he's the\nindividual that brought the case with club standing,\nassociational standing?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I think in -- Your\nHonor's first question to opposing counsel was such\nthat, yes, I think that if that was the individual whose\ninterest was relied upon to give an association\nstanding, that it would bind the individual whose name\nand interest was relied on. And this is in some ways\nthe reverse situation where --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But my question was just\na member of the association, whether --\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: No, the court of\nappeals was clear that just a common membership in an\nassociation or just a common interest would not be\nenough. They -- they distinguished the situation of a\ncommon interest in a -- in the same objective --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But why does there have\nto be any interest? Going back to a question I think\nJustice Scalia asked, we're dealing with a most unusual\nstatute. You don't have to have any reason for a FOIA\nrequest.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That -- that's\ntrue. We think that that, in fact, makes FOIA even more\nsusceptible to this kind of vexatious litigation that\nPetitioner seems to think is entirely permissible. And\nthe courts have held that the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask a general\nquestion here. Why isn't the defense of stare decisis\nadequate to take care of all your problems?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, because FOIA\nallows --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Repeated requests --\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: -- a number of\ndefendants --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- but if they're all the\nsame, wouldn't they say, well, that's the same case we\nhad last week?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, FOIA allows\nthe case to be brought in a number of different venues.\nIt can be brought in the venue of the -- where the\nrequestor lives, where the documents are located, or in\nthe District of Columbia.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: All right.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: And so a person\nsuch as Herrick could ask for assistance on his project,\nthe project of rebuilding the plane, of people scattered\nthroughout the country.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Correct, and he's the one\nwho raised the suit.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: And they could\nmaintain it throughout the country.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But did any -- defeat the\nsuit by claiming there was preclusion because of a suit\nin another jurisdiction, rather than stare decisis?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor,\nthe fact is that in FOIA, especially an exemption 4\ncase, there are special burdens on the government. The\ngovernment has the burden of proving that the exemption\nis warranted. So the plaintiff can just sort of lob\nanything in there. The government -- there is the\nburden of persuading the court in each case that the\nexemption is warranted.\nFairchild, a private party that wants to\nprotect its own property interests in the trade secret,\nis forced to go around the country litigating this over\nand over and over again as well. And the courts that\nhave considered the question recognize that the\npublic-right nature of the interest is one that makes\napplication of the rule particularly appropriate because\nboth the interests of the individual litigant, the\nplaintiff, is reduced, but also the opportunity for\nvexatious relitigation is increased multiple times\nbecause of the almost infinite number of potential\nplaintiffs.\nThis case was decided by the lower court on\nthe basis of the relationship between Herrick and\nTaylor. It was the fact that Taylor had taken up\nHerrick's own interest. There was the interest in the\nproject. The project was the restoration of the plane.\nHerrick owned the plane. Herrick had brought suit based\non that interest and lost. He asked Taylor to help him\nin that project. Taylor then brings the suit to get the\nsame documents for the same purpose.\nAnd we think that the U.S. versus Des Moines\nValley Railroad case is an example where, just shy\nperhaps of an actual agency relationship, because\nthere's no control in Des Moines Valley, that still the\nfact that the second litigant has volunteered to take\ntheir name to, in a sense, take advantage of the fact\nthey have independent standing --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, you have described\nfor us a thousand-headed monster of litigation, and your\nproposal for a solution is to cut off one eyebrow.\nYou're going to solve just the case of, you\nknow, two people building an airplane. You agree,\nanybody else in the association can file a lawsuit.\nAnybody else in the United States can file a lawsuit,\neven if they're not in the association.\nIt seems to me that, you know, in order to\ncut off an eyebrow, I'm not willing to make a whole lot\nof incursion upon our traditional rules of who's bound\nby a lawsuit.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why should we stretch for\nthat?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: We are not\nadvocating a broad rule. We, in fact --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: -- think that's one\nof the virtues of our argument: That where there is a\ndocument that is of true public interest such that\nmultiple individuals on entirely independent grounds\nmight well seek it, they would not be barred.\nBut where a document has commercial value\nlike this one does to Mr. Herrick, so that he can\nrestore his plane without going to the incredible\nexpense of developing another manner to prove to the FAA\nthe airworthiness of that plane, there is that\ncommercial value that gives him the incentive to try to\nrelitigate over and over again. And on Petitioner's\nview, as long as he stops just shy of an agency\nrelationship, he can do that throughout the country.\nAnd this is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That sounds like --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is this an approach\nthat only applies in FOIA cases? I would assume in\nevery other case you have the normal Article III\nrequirements of injury, which limits exactly who can\nsue.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, the rule is a\nbroader rule. And we've pointed out that it has in\ncommon with the rule with respect to co-beneficiaries\nthat existed since the 1800s at the very latest, the\nrule as stated in section 48 of the Restatement, which\nis an example, a counter-example, Justice Ginsburg, to\nyour question about whether it always had to be a\npre-existing legal relationship, because section 48\ndeals with a particular situation where there are\nmultiple individuals who can claim for personal injury\nof one of them. And the section is stated in terms of\nanother person, not a family member. And the commentary\nto this section makes clear that although most\nsituations where it would apply would be family members,\nit also applies to -- and I want to quote it: \"A de\nfacto connection may sometimes suffice as well as a\nformally valid one.\"\nSo the law of --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm not sure what the\nhypothetical is. I mean it is certainly not the case\nthat -- let's say you have a whole busload of people who\nget injured in the same accident. Plaintiff one sues\nand loses. Two sues and loses. Three is not precluded.\nFour is not precluded.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: But it recognizes\nthere could be a close-enough relationship between the\ntwo such that the purposes of the rule would be\nsatisfied, but there is no legal, familial relationship.\nAnd --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And if all that has been\nproved, the problem is that the D.C. Circuit said:\nWe're not going to look into what they call strategic\nwhatever.\nWe're going to take it just as it is, with\nnone of -- no showing that these two are in cahoots.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: They didn't need to\nbecause of the fact that Taylor had voluntarily taken up\nHerrick's interests to get a second bite at the\nlitigatory apple, as the First Circuit put it.\nAnd it is not the fact, as Petitioner would\nargue, that every time another person has an individual,\nstanding right to sue under a statute, that it means\nthat that person necessarily gets to relitigate where a\nperson with whom they have a close relationship such as\nthis has already litigated and lost.\nAnd so, getting back to Your Honor's\nquestion --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is sort of a\ntotality-of-the-circumstances test in every case, right.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We look at the whole thing,\nand we say, you know, close enough relationship. It is\nnot close enough; close enough. You need a better rule\nthan that for something that, you know, is a threshold\nissue in a case.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor,\nit is interesting that the restatement with respect to\nthe third category in the reply brief -- they called it\nthe third category of control perhaps. It is described\nin the restatement in comment to section 62 as where the\nperson falls short of becoming a party but which justly\nshould result in his being denied an opportunity to\nrelitigate.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's just as bad. You're\nabsolutely right. That's just as bad.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That is the nature\n-- that is the nature of res judicata principles. That\nit is not: Can you avoid this by avoiding the legal\ntechnicalities? It is the substance of the relationship\nthat counts.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Stetson.\nORAL ARGUMENT CATHERINE E. STETSON\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. STETSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nJustice Scalia, I'd like to begin with the\nquestion that you posed earlier regarding privity and\nwhat it really means, because that's what has given\nrise, I think, to all of these vexing hypotheticals and\nto your concern about this being nothing more than a\ncompletely freewheeling, totality-of-the circumstances\ntest.\nThe problem, I think, that you're\nconfronting is that you don't have the usual place that\nyou point your foot whenever you try to develop a\ncategorical rule. You don't have a statutory text. You\ndon't have a constitutional text.\nThis is a Federal common-law issue; and, as\nthis Court unanimously acknowledged in 1996, what our\nnotions are of privity are changing, and they continue\nto change.\nIn 1942, when the first restatement was\nissued, \"privity\" was defined as control, or successor\nin interest, or representation.\nIn 1982, when the second restatement was\nissued, \"privity\" was defined generally as\nrepresentation, legal relationships, or that section 62\ncategory that Mr. Hallward-Driemeier just mentioned,\nwhich we can call \"shenanigans.\"\nThe notion of privity is underpinned in\nevery single one of those contexts by a couple of basic\ninquiries, and this is what makes it something much more\nconfined than a freewheeling,\ntotality-of-the-circumstances test.\nThe inquiries are: What are the\nrelationships between these two litigants, these two\nserial litigants, and how have they conducted themselves\nin this litigation?\nAnd this in turn, I think, gets to the\ndialogue that, Justice Souter, you were having with my\ncolleagues. Your first question was -- posited the\nsituation where one plaintiff sues and loses and comes\nto another and says: Please try again for me.\nThat is precisely this case. And we don't\nhave to get into --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was no showing that\nHerrick ever asked Taylor -- well, there is a showing\nthat they're interested in rebuilding this plane or\nrestoring the plane. But we don't have -- and the D.C.\nCircuit said it was not relevant to its analysis. Yes,\nI would totally agree with you if we have a recruiting\nsituation, if we have a financing situation. But the\nD.C. Circuit said: Well, that's irrelevant.\nMS. STETSON: I agree with you the D.C.\nCircuit didn't find collusion, looking at Petitioner's\nappendix 17-A at two things: The timing of the suit and\nthe sharing of discovery. But we don't need to get into\nthe evidence of collusion because what the D.C. Circuit\nconcluded as a predicate finding for its close-\nrelationship holding was that there was a request from\nMr. Herrick to Mr. Taylor to assist in the repair of his\nplane.\nAnd you can see this play out very tellingly\nat joint appendix 31 to 32. If you look there, this is\nthe motion to allow discovery. Joint appendix 31 is\nwhere Mr. Taylor relays at length the Tenth Circuit\nargument and the Tenth Circuit ruling.\nThe first full paragraph on joint appendix\n32 begins: \"Mr. Herrick has now requested Mr. Taylor to\nassist in the repair of his plane.\"\nNow, Mr. Herrick, you can see from the first\nexhibit to Fairchild's summary judgment motion in\ndistrict court, page 161, Mr. Herrick has six full-time\nmechanics. He lives in Jackson Hole. His mechanics\nwork in Minneapolis. He doesn't need Mr. Taylor, who\nlives in Iowa, to actually, physically assist with the\nrepair of his plane.\nWhat he needs is someone with whom he\ndoesn't have an extant employment relationship, who\nlives in a different circuit, to get those documents.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Look, I concede we can all\nsee where you're going, but isn't the problem this: In\neffect, you're asking us to infer a finding of fact, and\nwe're not the trial court.\nYou've raised a good circumstantial\nsuspicion case; but, either because it wasn't raised by\nyour predecessor counsel as well or because the -- for\nsome reason the district court just would not buy it,\nthat's the -- the conclusion that you want us to draw\nisn't before us. And I don't see that we're the\nappropriate court to draw it.\nMS. STETSON: Two responses, Your Honor:\nThe first is that conclusion was precisely the\nconclusion that was drawn by the D.C. Circuit on the\nclose-relationship point.\nIf you look at joint appendix 17-A, the\nconclusion on close relationship was predicated on,\namong other things, the critical fact of the request\nfrom Mr. Herrick to Mr. Taylor to repair the plane.\nThat is what made --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But at no point did\nthe D.C. Circuit or the district court, as I understand\nit, say that request, in effect, was a request to\nrelitigate this matter so that we both, the owner of the\nplane and the repairer of the plane, would have what I\nwas seeking in my first lawsuit.\nThey never actually crossed the line and\ndrew that conclusion; did they?\nMS. STETSON: The district court, in fact,\nheld precisely that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What did it --\nMS. STETSON: In joint appendix 35-A -- in\nPetitioner's appendix 35-A the district court concluded\nas a factual finding that there was deliberate\nmaneuvering based on two things.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's out of the case\nbecause the court of appeals said: We do not need to\ndetermine whether they count as tactical maneuvering.\nWe do not do so.\nMS. STETSON: Well, I'm going to resist you\nslightly, Justice Ginsburg. I'm not sure that that is\nthe case. It is very curious.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It could be remanded. It\ncould be remanded with instructions that the collusion\nquestion is still open. Prove it. It hasn't been\nproved.\nMS. STETSON: What the district court found\nconstituted collusion was identical interests and the\nrequest. What the D.C. circuit found did not constitute\ncollusion was the timing of the FOIA action and the\nsharing of discovery.\nSo they're operating on the collusion front\non two completely parallel paths. But on the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what the opinion\nsaid is to review the bidding. There is record evidence\nthat: One, Taylor and Herrick had identical interests;\ntwo, Taylor's interest was adequately represented in\nHerrick; three, Herrick and Taylor had a close working\nrelationship relative to these successive cases.\nAnd that's enough. That's enough to show\ncollusion.\nMS. STETSON: The discussion that precedes\nthe reviewing of the bidding references with respect to\nthe close-relationship finding the request from\nMr. Herrick to Mr. Taylor to assist in the repair of his\nplane, the request that is featured in joint appendix 32\nas the preceding factor to the filing of the FOIA\naction.\nAnd I grant you, that does make this case\nquite unique. It does make it quite similar to the 1897\ncase from the the Eighth Circuit, and I think it is\nquite telling that we haven't found another analogue.\nThat doesn't mean that this doesn't fall\nwell within the wheelhouse of privity cases that this\nCourt is quite comfortable with.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what about the\nassociational cases: The association brings a suit in\nthe interests of the members? Are those members bound?\nMS. STETSON: Well, it depends on -- it\ndepends on a couple of things, Mr. Chief Justice, but\nthe first thing it depends on is a finding that the\ninterests of the association and of the members is\nidentical. Not just common, not just --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Association standing\ncases we talk about germane, right?\nMS. STETSON: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that enough?\nMS. STETSON: I think -- I think the\ninterests need to -- to be identical. I'm not sure that\nit's enough just to have a common cause.\nThe interests were found in this case to be\nidentical because one was literally factually derivative\nof the other. And I want to make a point clear about\nthe difference between FOIA standing such as it is, and\nthe interest that's being represented in this case.\nThe fact that Mr. Taylor, after learning of\nMr. Herrick's defeat, decided to perfect his FOIA rights\nand sue in Federal court gave him standing. That was\nall it gave him. What it did not do is give him a free\npass from a res judicata inquiry. And Justice Scalia\nand Justice Ginsburg, to your points about FOIA not\nrequiring a motive, that's absolutely right at the\nagency level.\nBut at the point where a disappointed FOIA\nrequestor comes into court and asks to be heard on the\nsame claim representing somebody else's interest, on its\nface, at joint appendix 32, that's the point where the\njudicial doctrine of res judicata kicks in.\nThat's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Anyone --anyone in this\naudience, and anyone in the association would be a\nproper FOIA plaintiff; is that right?\nMS. STETSON: That is right. That is\nabsolutely right. The reason that Mr. Taylor is barred\nis not just because he's asking for these same\ndocuments. These are incredibly unusual documents; they\ndon't have great public appeal; but the reason he's\nbarred is because Mr. Herrick requested his assistance\nin the repair of the airplane. Mr. Taylor sought the\nsame documents for exactly the same reason to be used to\nexactly the same end purpose. That should -- I think --\ngive the Petitioner a great deal of comfort in this\nregard.\nWe are not advocating nor is the government,\na privity rule that is going to result in the widespread\npreclusion of FOIA plaintiffs who seeks the same\ndocuments for independent reasons; but when someone\ncomes to the Court pressing someone else's interests,\nthat is a square privity issue, and he should be barred.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMs. Stetson.\nMs. Rosenbaum, four minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ADINA H. ROSENBAUM,\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. ROSENBAUM: Thank you.\nFirst, I want to address the two cases\nbrought up by the government. In Des Moines Valley\nRailroad that was someone who had the right to the land\nbecause of a grant from the government. In that case,\nspecifically, the Court pointed out that the\ngovernment -- that Congress had passed a law that had\nthe government give up all interest, that showed that\nthe government had given up all interests in the land.\nAnd in the Rock Island Railroad case, that had to do\nwith a beneficiary and the administrator of an estate.\nThese are legal relationships that give rise\nto privity, and that's exactly the point. There are\nrelationships that do give rise to privity, but the\nrelationship between Taylor and Herrick is not one of\nthem.\nThe government also pointed out that FOIA\nrequestors can bring suit in different venues, and that\nis the case. They can bring it in the District of\nColumbia, where the records are, or where they are. But\nas they pointed out, that is the way that FOIA is set\nup. Congress allowed requestors to bring suits in\ndifferent places, and that's not the way Congress needed\nto establish FOIA. It could have made one place the\nsole venue for bringing suit under FOIA but it did not.\nAnd --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if two people\nget together who want the same documents for the same\npurpose, which is they think they're going to make money\noff of it. And they say which ever gets it we'll share\nwith the other and we'll split the money we're going to\nget?\nMS. ROSENBAUM: So they bring --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Separate -- separate\nsuits, separate requests, separate suits. They just\nwant to double their chances of getting the documents,\nbut they agree to split. They think they're going to\nmake a hundred dollars off of this and agree to split it\n50-50, regardless of who wins.\nMS. ROSENBAUM: I think what would have to\nbe looked at there is control or representation. But\nagain, the facts here do not show that there is any\nagreement between Taylor and Herrick to -- there's no\nagreement either to repair the plane; but more\nspecifically, there are no agreements to bring this\nlawsuit.\nSo this Court does not need to reach the\nquestion of exactly what sort of agreement would lead to\npreclusion, and the problem with the lower court's\ndecision here is that they did just look at a grab bag\nof amorphous factors to hold Taylor bound. They talk\nabout a close relationship without it being the sort of\nrelationship under which one party is representing the\nother or under which they have a legal relationship.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Stetson said that the\ndistrict court unlike the court of appeals, did find\ncollusion, and she referred to a page that I didn't\ncheck.\nMS. ROSENBAUM: The district court did think\nthat there was tactical maneuvering happening here. But\nthe court of appeals specifically said that the district\ncourt had erred in concluding that there had been an\nagreement between them.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think we need\nto remand this for consideration of whether or not there\nwas an agreement, if we conclude that what we see from\nthe court of appeals opinion isn't enough?\nAs I understand, the court of appeals didn't\nthink an agreement was necessary. So regardless of what\nthe district court said, al thought that was an issue\nthat was litigated, it was not passed on by the court of\nappeals.\nMS. ROSENBAUM: Yes. The court could remand\nit and then the district court would have the discretion\nto allow the case to go forward as it saw fit.\nAnd the problem - the problem with the\nfactors looked at by the lower courts, with -- basing\nprivity on just amorphous facts and basically just\nhaving courts check their gut about whether or not that\nrelationship is sufficient, is that it ends up with\npeople being found in privity when they did not actually\nhave their right to be heard, the way Taylor did not\nhere. Instead, privity should be based on underlaying\nrationales that protect the litigant's right to be heard\nand ensure that they do have their day in court.\nUnless there are any further questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n"
