BERGMANN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. BERGMANN: Good morning. Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe Court today is presented with two strikingly\ndifferent interpretations of when the 1-year period of\nlimitation found in paragraph 6(3) of 28 U.S.C., section\n2255 begins to run.\nIf paragraph 6(3) is read in a manner that is\nconsistent with both Congress' use of verb tense and this\nCourt's decision in Tyler v. Cain, then the Government's\ninterpretation of when the 1-year period begins to run is\nabsurd because it reduces paragraph 6(3) to a near\nnullity. This is so because, as even the Government\nadmits, retroactivity decisions almost always come more\nthan a year after a decision of this Court initially\nrecognizing a right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: When you say it's a\nnullity, what you really mean is it allows for very --\nvery little relief.\nMS. BERGMANN: That's correct, Your Honor. Very\nfew cases would -- would have a retroactivity decision\nwithin a year of initial recognition.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: And why is that an\nargument in your favor?\nMS. BERGMANN: The -- it would -- the argument\nis in my favor, Your Honor, because this Court should not\nread acts of Congress in a manner that would render them\nabsurd.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, to say that it\ndoesn't grant as much relief as it might have doesn't\nrender the statute absurd.\nMS. BERGMANN: Well, in -- in this case, Your\nHonor, it does in two ways. It does because the relief\nthat it would allow has only occurred, in my estimation,\nonce in the post-Teague world since 1989 when Teague v.\nLane was decided, and the only other instance would be\nwhen this Court would find a right is both -- initially\nrecognize a right and find that right retroactive in the\nsame case, which in my understanding --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, we've had very few\ninstances in recent years I think where this Court has\nfound some right to be retroactive.\nMS. BERGMANN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: So it just doesn't happen\nvery often to begin with.\nMS. BERGMANN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And it would be further\nlimited if the Government's position is adopted here.\nMS. BERGMANN: That's correct, Your Honor. It\nwould basically be --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But it doesn't happen\nanyway --\nMS. BERGMANN: It -- it does not --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- very often.\nMS. BERGMANN: It does not happen very often,\nYour Honor, but there have been several instances. The\nsituation in Bousley where the Court found that the rights\nin Bailey applied retroactively. I think most people\nwould consider the Court's recent decision in Atkins v.\nVirginia would apply retroactively in light of this\nCourt's earlier decision in Penry v. Lynaugh. So it does,\nindeed, happen and because it happens and because the\nrights involved in those types cases are so important --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: How -- how do we read this\nstatute concerning what court may find the retroactivity?\nIt's not limited, I assume, under either your view or the\nGovernment's to a finding by this Court, a determination\nthat it's retroactive.\nMS. BERGMANN: That's -- that's correct, Your\nHonor. The parties agree that a lower court can make the\nretroactivity decision as well, and that's because of --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And it could be a court in\nanother circuit presumably if you're in the Federal\nsystem.\nMS. BERGMANN: Well, Your Honor, I would argue\nthat it would have to be a court in the -- in the circuit\nin which the prisoner would be filing the 2255 motion\nbecause that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why?\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Why?\nMS. BERGMANN: Because that court would have\njurisdiction over the proceedings in his case and it would\nbe an adequate way of providing notice to that litigant.\nIt -- a decision of another --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, I guess a litigant can\nread decisions from other courts, as a lawyer can.\nMS. BERGMANN: That's correct, Your Honor, but\nthey would have no precedential effect in his case.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why -- why shouldn't the\nlitigant be put on notice by a district court decision?\nLet's assume it's in his own circuit.\nMS. BERGMANN: Well, Your Honor, a district\ncourt decision would have no precedential value with\nrespect to -- would not bind other district courts in that\ndistrict and therefore not bind other litigants.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But there's -- there's just\nnothing in the statute that says what level court it has\nto be.\nMS. BERGMANN: Well, actually, Your Honor, the\nstatute does say that the ruling would have to be made\nretroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.\nIt does not say a case. And a decision of a district\ncourt would make that retroactivity applicable only to one\ncase not to cases.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, but that may be\njust a generic use of the term cases.\nMS. BERGMANN: Well, it could be, Your Honor,\nbut I -- Congress included the language. I think this\nCourt could give meaning to it by interpreting the statute\nto mean that you would be looking at a decision of the\ncourt of appeals rather than a decision from a district\ncourt.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, if -- if you said a\ndistrict court, one district judge could -- could trigger\nthe thing for the whole country. That --\nMS. BERGMANN: It would be very complicated,\nYour Honor, given the fact that district courts often\nissue rulings in unpublished decisions as well.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So look at the trouble we get\ninto when we take your interpretation. Suppose we take\nthe Government's interpretation and think only of first\nhabeas. Leave second habeas out of it for a moment. But\nif it were only first habeas and those were all the\nhabeases in the world, wouldn't theirs be better? Every\nprisoner would know that when you get the right, you file.\nOkay, no problem. And you're going to win if, and only\nif, you get a court to say it was retroactive. So that's\nfine. We all know. All the prisoners know we've got to\nfile within a year. It would cause no problem if there\nwere only first habeases.\nMS. BERGMANN: If there were only first habeas,\nYour Honor, and if the lower courts always made the\ncorrect retroactivity --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. They sometimes don't, but\nthen if they don't, you appeal, just like anything else.\nAnd you might lose and you might not get your case taken\nin the Supreme Court. That's always true for every\nlitigant.\nMS. BERGMANN: That's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So -- so that's a problem.\nIs there any other problem?\nMS. BERGMANN: Well, Your Honor, there is also a\nproblem which the Government actually concedes --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What?\nMS. BERGMANN: -- which is if you read the\nstatutory language of the second clause as being stated in\nthe past tense, and the initial -- and the statute of\nlimitations begins to run with initial recognition, it --\nit doesn't respect Congress' intent to provide a 1-year\nlimitation period.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, but that's -- that's\nlinguistic. I'm -- I'm looking for practical problems for\nprisoners, which was your initial argument. And in\nrespect to a practical problem for a prisoner, I couldn't\nthink of one, and that's why I'm asking. In respect to\nfirst habeases.\nMS. BERGMANN: With respect to first habeases.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right.\nThen if your only problem is second habeas,\nthere I'd agree with you. There's a big problem. But it\nsays here the date on which the right asserted was\ninitially recognized. Now, I guess a person who's filed a\nhabeas doesn't have a right until the Supreme Court has\nmade the -- the rule retroactive. And therefore, until\nthe Supreme Court makes it retroactive, there was no right\nrecognized for a second habeas person. And therefore, for\nthat case it does begin to run when the Supreme Court says\nit's retroactive because prior to that he had no right --\nMS. BERGMANN: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- given -- given paragraph 8.\nMS. BERGMANN: The -- the same would be true\nthough, Your Honor, then for initial motions that there\nwould be no right available unless a court at some point\nhad held the right applied retroactively to collateral\ncases because under Teague v. Lane, there is no right to\ncollateral relief simply based on the decision of this\nCourt unless that decision has also been held\nretroactively applicable.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, it's all -- the word\nright in (3) quite plainly doesn't cover the last six\nwords of the -- of the sentence. Well, whether the word\nright -- I'm trying to fix it up. I'm trying to figure\nout --\nMS. BERGMANN: Yes, I understand that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- how do we get to that\nconclusion.\nNow, it seems to me what you've done is say\neither use my ad hoc mechanism, or let there be chaos, or\nwe take your approach which produces the kind of chaos\nwe've just been discussing.\nMS. BERGMANN: Well, Your Honor, I agree with --\nthat -- that this is not the best drafted statute that\nCongress has ever come up with, but I think that\nrespecting Congress' use of verb tense and this Court's\ndecision in Tyler v. Cain, to read paragraph 8(2) and\nparagraph 6(3) together, that -- that it's important that\nall three of the prerequisites in the statute have been\nmet before the limitation period begins to run.\nOtherwise --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why -- why is that important,\ngiven what this petitioner did himself? He didn't wait\nfor there to be a retroactivity decision to file the 2255\nmotion. He filed the 2255 motion before the Ross case was\ndecided. Isn't that right?\nMS. BERGMANN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So perfectly -- the -- the\nprisoner is perfectly able to file the 2255 motion after\nthe first clause is satisfied, the date on which the right\nasserted was initially recognized. This movant was too\nlate, if you measured the year from that right but he\nwasn't -- he wasn't waiting for any retroactivity\ndecision. He filed before the retroactivity case.\nMS. BERGMANN: That's correct, Your Honor. He\nwas early under our interpretation --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So on your view of it, his\ncomplaint, when it was filed, should have been dismissed\nas not ripe because he didn't have the final element --\nMS. BERGMANN: That's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that is, the\nretroactivity?\nMS. BERGMANN: That's correct, Your Honor. At\nthe time he filed, there had not been a retroactivity\ndecision on which he could rely. During the course of\nlitigation in the district court, the Eleventh Circuit\ndecided the Ross case, and at that point, his right to\nrelief became ripe and the -- and he then had a window\nopen under paragraph 6(3), such as he could file timely.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Of course, if we're -- if -- if\nadmittedly, as Justice Breyer said, we're trying to figure\nout some way to make this work in circumstances in which\nit's -- it's never going to work smoothly, I suppose one\nanswer would be to take the Government's position and say\nyou've -- your -- your year runs from the moment the right\nis recognized, but to the -- to the extent that there is a\nretroactivity question, a -- a court should simply stay\nthe proceeding, hold it in abeyance to see whether,\nparticularly in -- in second habeas where you have the --\nthe second petition where you have the problem, to see\nwhether some court will, in fact, recognize retroactivity\nor whether the -- your circuit will recognize\nretroactivity. Then if it does, then you can go forward.\nMS. BERGMANN: Well, the problem with that, Your\nHonor, is that it -- it encourages, as the Government's\nrule in general does -- encourages numerous frivolous\nfilings.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, there's no question there's\na Rube Goldberg character of the whole thing, I -- I\nrealize. But -- but that would be a way of -- of solving\nthe second habeas problem and still accepting the\nGovernment's position on the -- on the date at which the\n-- the 1 year for filing starts.\nMS. BERGMANN: Well, a procedure that the\nSeventh Circuit has adopted -- and the Seventh Circuit\nagrees with -- with Mr. Dodd's interpretation of the\nstatute that it begins to run with the retroactivity\ndecision. Their solution for these premature filings is\nto review the case on the merits, and if they feel that\nthe motion would lose on the merits, they dismiss it with\nprejudice, and if they feel there's some viable claim\nbeing stated, then they dismiss it without prejudice to\nrefiling at a later time. That's --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: It would -- it would\npotentially violate the 1-year limit. That won't\nnecessarily work.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Crazy.\nMS. BERGMANN: Well --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: I mean, it's a very odd\nstatute.\nMS. BERGMANN: Yes, it is, Your Honor. It's\nvery odd.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you don't know who's\nresponsible for writing this, do you?\n(Laughter.)\nMS. BERGMANN: Actually my understanding is that\nmuch of it was written by the Attorney General in\nCalifornia at the time.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can -- do you understand the\n-- the difference between what is a right initially\nrecognized and then what is a right newly recognized? The\nstatute is supposed to have three requirements: initially\nrecognized, newly recognized, and made retroactive.\nMS. BERGMANN: Yes, Your Honor. My\nunderstanding of when a right is newly recognized is -- is\nwhen it is new in the sense that this Court has adopted\nunder Teague v. Lane, that it's not dictated by prior\nprecedent. A right can be initially recognized by this\nCourt but not new in the Teague sense.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Actually Justice Souter's\napproach might work here because you -- you -- all the\nsecond habeases file immediately. Now, the Seventh\nCircuit, you say, well, gets to those second habeases\nright away, and it says dismissed. Very well. When they\nsay dismissed, then they ask for cert. And when they ask\nfor cert, we take or we don't. If we don't, then they're\nout of luck. And if we take it, people would hold all the\nother cases waiting to see what we decide. So they\nwouldn't lose out in any case where we really were going\nto make it collaterally -- applicable on collateral\nreview.\nMS. BERGMANN: But then, Your Honor, you run up\nagainst your decision in Tyler v. Cain, and that was the\ncircumstance of the litigant in Tyler v. Cain. No -- this\nCourt had not previously determined that the right at\nissue in Tyler v. Cain was retroactively applicable, and\nunder the second or successive statute that -- in the way\nthe Court read this, the Court said that this Court could\nnot determine the retroactivity of, I believe it was, Cage\nv. Louisiana in that very case because it was contrary to\nthe language in the statute.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I'm sure my dissent was\ncorrect in that case, but the --\n(Laughter.)\nMS. BERGMANN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The -- the -- still -- it still\nwould work because the first case has come down. Okay?\nThe first case has come down. Now all the prisoners read\nabout these cases, and even if they've already filed a\nhabeas, they go file another. And the Seventh Circuit,\nyou say, then looks at that first one that they get to,\nand they say, dismissed.\nOh, you're saying that then he comes he here and\nwe say the reason you lose is not because you're wrong.\nThe reason you lose is because you're not yet ripe.\nMS. BERGMANN: Yes, that's correct, Your Honor.\nWhat Congress appears to have intended in this -- in this\nstatute, as -- as much as anyone can tell, is that\nretroactivity decisions be -- be litigated in cases that\nare brought under paragraph 6(1) which is those cases that\nare within a -- a year of when the judgment of conviction\nbecame final. That's exactly what happened here.\nAnd the Ross case that litigated the question of\nthe retroactivity of Richardson, that was a case brought\nunder paragraph 6(1). Mr. Ross was within a year of when\nhis judgment of conviction became final, and -- and the\nissue of retroactivity was -- was litigated straight and\nup in that case.\nAnd what it appears that Congress intended was\nthat very circumstance to happen in all cases, that the\nretroactivity of decisions of this Court be litigated in\ncases brought within a year of finality, and then once\nthose decisions were made, then litigants under paragraph\n6(3) would have the opportunity to file when a court of\nappeals issued a retroactivity ruling. And then litigants\nunder paragraph 8(2) would have a -- the ability to\nfile --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But we -- we still might be\nable to deal with it. That person files his petition for\ncert. He puts in the petition there are 4,000 prisoners\nwho are trying to file second habeases, and if you decide\nretroactivity, collateral, all of them but me will be able\nto proceed. But you have to have enough sense, Supreme\nCourt, to take my case to decide if you're going to decide\nretroactivity, that it is and give me the benefit of the\ndecision.\nMS. BERGMANN: Well, then, Your Honor, I guess\nthe Court would have to -- to totally reconsider its\ndecision in Tyler v. Cain to reach that conclusion. And I\ndon't know what to say. I mean, since Tyler v. Cain was\nenacted for -- I'm sorry -- decided 4 years ago, Congress\nhas made no effort to overturn that decision, and it\nappears Congress believed that the Court had -- had read\nthe statute correctly in that case. And so if you\ninterpret the made retroactivity -- made retroactively\napplicable language in paragraph 6(3) in the way that this\nCourt read the language in paragraph 8(2), such that the\nretroactivity decision has to be made before a motion can\nbe filed, it becomes very complicated to do that if the\n1-year period begins to run within initial --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: The problem with your\nargument, Ms. Bergmann, seems to be addressed to the idea\nthat Congress intended to sweep quite broadly here. But I\ndon't think that's the necessary inference at all. We're\ndealing with a situation, as Justice O'Connor points out,\nwhere we have very rarely held that a decision is\nretroactive. So it's already a very small class of cases,\nand the Government's view makes it an even smaller class\nof cases. But that doesn't mean the statute doesn't work.\nIt just means it doesn't work for a lot of people who are\nexcluded from it.\nMS. BERGMANN: Well, Your Honor, I -- I agree\nthat this involves a very small class of cases. The\nproblem with the Government's reading is that they say\nthat they are narrowly constricting the statute, but the\nprocedural mechanism that they set up allows for a vast\nnumber of cases that would never fall within the statute\nof limitations to be filed and requires the court to deal\nwith each and every one of those cases in the first\ninstance.\nWhereas, my reading of statute has the benefit\nof allowing a -- a test case to proceed. Given the fact\nthat there are very few number of these rights that are\nmade retroactively applicable, it -- it makes more sense\nin terms of judicial resources to allow there to be this\nsituation where is -- there is a test case --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But on your theory, there\nwouldn't be much in the way of resources because you say\nthere's no ripe claim until the retroactivity decision\ncomes down. Why wouldn't a district judge, faced with\nthis dilemma, simply say, well, I'll just hold this\ncomplaint until the -- the court of appeals or the Supreme\nCourt rules on retroactivity?\nMS. BERGMANN: Well, certainly the district\ncourts would do that. The more appropriate course of\naction would probably be to find the motion at that point\nuntimely because it does not fall within any of the -- it\n-- if it is outside the initial year from finality but\ndoesn't fall within any of the other exceptions stated in\nparagraph 6, then it -- it would be untimely and the court\ncould dismiss it as such.\nI mean, by doing so, if the court dismisses it,\nit could well count as a first motion so that any motion\nfiled thereafter would be a second or successive motion.\nAnd this would be -- preclude litigants from filing\nprematurely and burdening the courts with premature\nfilings until it is clear they have a cause of action.\nI mean, what's strange about the Government's\nreading of the statute is that they believe Congress\nintended for a limitations period to begin to run before\nthe litigant had any right to relief. No one has a right\nto relief in the collateral proceeding until the right at\nissue has been made retroactively applicable to collateral\ncases. And so that this kind of disjoinder of the statute\nof limitations and the cause of action creates this\nproblem where people will be -- feel compelled to file\nprotective motions.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question? The\nwords, made retroactively applicable to cases on\ncollateral review, don't have a modifier such as telling\nus by whom it's made retroactive. Has any court\nconsidered what seems to me a fairly normal reading that\nthe -- the words, by the Supreme Court, should apply to\nthat phrase as well as the preceding language?\nMS. BERGMANN: Well, actually, Your Honor, every\nlower court to consider the language has found that the\nretroactivity decision need not be made by this Court, and\nthe reason for that is the difference between the language\nin paragraph 6(3) and in the second or successive\nprovision in paragraph 8(2). In paragraph 8(2), it\nexplicitly states that it has to be made retroactive to\ncases on collateral review by the Supreme Court.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me that cuts in\nthe other direction, that when Congress thought about the\nentity that makes it retroactive, they thought about us.\nAnd that's why -- and that's the only language that seems\nto fit. I mean, the by the Supreme Court seems to fit\nthat concept.\nMS. BERGMANN: If -- if you apply --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But I guess nobody has come up\nwith this suggestion other than this question.\nMS. BERGMANN: Well, various lower courts have\nconsidered that possibility and have latched onto the\ndifferent -- differences in language where paragraph 8(2)\nexplicitly states it has to be made by the Supreme Court,\nbut paragraph 6(3) says it does not. And -- and the court\nbelow said the same thing, and the parties agree that the\nretroactivity decision need not be made by this Court.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, if we disagree and\nthink it should be, I guess that would open a door down\nthe road for people after this Court made such a\ndetermination.\nMS. BERGMANN: That's correct, Your Honor. It\nwould make paragraph 6(3) much more consistent with\nparagraph 8(2), if -- if the --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes.\nMS. BERGMANN: But again, it would work only if\nthe 1-year period began to run from this Court's\nretroactivity decision. If it begins to run from initial\nrecognition, then that would turn paragraph 6(3) into an\nabsolute nullity because I know of no case where this\nCourt has made a retroactivity decision within a year of\nwhen it initially recognizes a right.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But that fits the language,\nthe date on which the right was initially recognized by\nthe Supreme Court if and only if it's been made\nretroactively by the Supreme Court. It seems to me a very\nnormal reading of the language. But nobody else agrees\nwith it.\nMS. BERGMANN: Yes, Your Honor, that no one else\nhas -- has agreed with thus far.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but there -- it's -- I'm\nnow taken with this. I'm jumping from one thing to\nanother here. But that does get rid of the problems that\nwere initially plaguing your position because it's precise\nand definite. And it also gets rid of whatever problems\nwere produced by Tyler because a person could easily get\nto the Supreme Court in that rare case without his\npetition, if it's a first petition, being improperly filed\nbecause he's not bound by paragraph 8.\nMS. BERGMANN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So it's a first position. So\nall that he does is he files a petition. He can file it\nbefore any court -- nothing says he can't file it before a\ncourt has decided it's retroactive. He files the\npetition. He seeks cert here. He gets us to say it's\nretroactive in that rare instance, and everyone else has a\nyear from that moment.\nAnd as far as the -- the second people are\nconcerned, they don't -- the second petition people don't\nhave to file it until a year from that moment, and they\nhave a good claim under paragraph 8. There's quite a lot\n-- now -- now, I'm jumping to that because it sounds like\nit might be good.\nMS. BERGMANN: I -- I'm sorry, Your Honor. I\nthink you may have lost me. You would have the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, don't worry about it.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. BERGMANN: Okay. If the Court has no other\nquestions, I'll reserve the rest of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms.\nBergmann.\nMr. Feldman, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Would you address that last\nsuggestion first, Mr. Feldman?\nMR. FELDMAN: I'm not sure I completely held it\nin -- in my mind.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It was very --\nMR. FELDMAN: Our basic position is --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, to -- to interpret as\nmeaning only this Court could make the retroactivity\ndetermination and the 1 year wouldn't run until and unless\nthere was a new rule and subsequently in whatever case\nthis Court said it was retroactive.\nMR. FELDMAN: I -- I have two comments about\nthat. That was a position which actually a footnote in\nour brief in Tyler against Cain I think suggested,\nalthough that wasn't the issue before the Court in that\ncase. But since that time, this has been litigated in a\nnumber of courts of appeals and district courts, and as\nfar as I'm aware, no court has accepted that. And the\nreason they haven't --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, that's true, but I\nassume it is, nonetheless, open for us to do so --\nMR. FELDMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- if we thought it was\ncorrect. What is your view?\nMR. FELDMAN: It would be, but I think we came\nto the conclusion that it probably wasn't because the\nwords, by the Supreme Court, are not only present in two\ndifferent places right in this paragraph 6(3), also in\n8(2), also in 2244 and in 22 -- I think -- 64. And it\ndoes seem to be a pattern that where the Congress expected\na decision by this Court in the whole series of statutes,\nthey said, by the Supreme Court. And it's notably missing\nfrom the phrase that says, made retroactive to cases on\ncollateral review.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It is noticeably missing\nbecause it -- it has a blank there and the words, by the\nSupreme Court, are the only time limitation in that whole\nprovision after the word if.\nMR. FELDMAN: It -- that -- it -- what it says\n-- it says newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made\nretroactive. It doesn't say by the Supreme Court. That's\nthe rationale the courts have used.\nBut if I could move to the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But if you don't -- aren't -- I\nmean, the language is open, and it's sort of like the\nvirtue of this -- suddenly it's like tinkers to Everest\nchance. I mean, it seems to put everything together.\nWhat was worrying you most about their position was it\nproduced uncertainty, a kind of a mess. You don't know\nwhich court you're talking about. People would be filing\nthings all over the place. They'll be waiting. That --\nit's a mess.\nThis stops that. What's worrying them is that\nthe second habeas person, given Tyler, could never file,\nnot even in that -- you know, not even in that -- in that\nreally unusual situation where we're going to make it a\ncollateral review. And now, what this does is it produces\nthe certainty, the definiteness of when your time clock\nbegins to tick, and it eliminates all the uncertainty, et\ncetera, and confusion, difficulty from their position.\nMR. FELDMAN: I -- I think the other -- the\nother problem that I actually am -- that I think the Court\nshould be worried about is that this statute sets one --\nit doesn't say anything about the date on which something\nis made retroactive. It says it runs from the later of\nfour dates and it then sets forth what those dates are.\nAnd it says, the date on which the right asserted was\ninitially recognized by the Supreme Court, if certain\nconditions are satisfied.\nNow, that if clause may well raise some -- it\ndoes raise, I think, some interpretative issues. But\nhowever you interpret the if clause, that just tells you\nwhether the petitioner can use that date on which the\nright was initially recognized or not. If he can't use\nit, if the if clause is not satisfied, then he's -- he\nonly has to show he's timely under one of the other three\nprovisions. The normal one is 1 year from the date that\nthe conviction became final.\nAnd I think our primary submission in the case\nis however you construe the if clause, it can't possibly\nbe read to -- whatever interpretative problems there are\nthere, it can't be possibly be read to alter the totally\nplain language that Congress --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, it could because you\ncould say what the Congress intended to say. If the right\nhad X, Y, and Z, it shall in that event run from that\ndate.\nMR. FELDMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's implicit in it.\nMR. FELDMAN: And it's not --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Just like the words, by the\nSupreme Court --\nMR. FELDMAN: It's not -- it's not --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- would be implicit.\nMR. FELDMAN: -- it doesn't. But even then,\nit's not -- it doesn't run from that date, and the -- he's\n-- and the -- the petitioner has the -- the applicant has\nno date on -- if he's past his 1 year from the date the\nconviction became final, he has no date on which he can\nrely to make his application timely.\nAnd our primary submission --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, on Justice Stevens'\nanalysis, he does not have a date until the retroactivity\ndecision is made, and he has to sit there and wait. But\nwhen the retroactivity decision is made, he's got his\ndate.\nMR. FELDMAN: But this statute doesn't -- it's\nnot worded the way the -- the -- paragraph 6 as a whole\nsays you have the later of four dates. It names four\ndifferent things. But subparagraph (3) doesn't say, well,\nthe later of any of these things. It -- it tells you if\nthe condition is satisfied then you -- the question is --\nokay, the if condition is satisfied. I can use paragraph\n(3). What's my time limit? And it says the date on which\n-- 1 year from the date on which the right was initially\nrecognized by the Supreme Court, and that's the date he\nhas. If the -- if -- if it turns out that he can't use it\nbecause the appropriate thing doesn't happen till later,\nthen he just can't use that date. He has three other\npossible dates to use under paragraph (6) --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I follow your linguistic\n-- Justice Stevens follows the linguistic analysis. I\nthink the question that he's raising, the question I'm\nraising is, do we have a good reason here to doubt that\nthe linguistic analysis is getting us to -- to what\nCongress would have intended?\nThe proposed good reason or the best reason I\nthink is that if we read it your way, then as Justice\nBreyer said in Tyler, as a practical matter, second habeas\nis -- is -- a second habeas petitioner is -- is almost\nnever going to -- or probably, in fact, never will get the\nbenefit of the new rule. Well, maybe one answer to that\nis, so what.\nThe reason that cannot be dismissed, I think,\nthat way is this. As has been pointed out here, we do not\nunder our rules often make a new rule retroactive, but\nwhen we do under the conditions which we impose for that,\nit's -- it's one humdinger of a rule.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And it is -- it is unlikely --\nor at least there's a good argument that it's unlikely --\nthat Congress would have wanted to exclude all the\npotential second habeas people from it, particularly\nbecause they're second habeas people because they got in\nin time on first habeas. They played by the rules, and on\nyour theory basically they're out of the game on a very\nimportant rule. So that's the argument for saying that\nyour linguistic analysis may not be pointing to what\nCongress intended.\nMR. FELDMAN: Well, I -- I disagree with that.\nFirst, on second habeas, the -- this Court, I think all\nthree opinions, in Tyler against Cain recognized that\nthere can be cases where this Court recognizes a new right\nand it is retroactive at the same time where it's the\ncombination of some earlier decision that said all rules\nof a certain type are retroactive and then in the\nsecond --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that is --\nMR. FELDMAN: -- the Court said we are\nrecognizing a rule of that type.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That is a highly exceptional\ncase, and the problem with that is -- I mean, if -- if\nwe're going to -- if you're going to be linguistic about\nit, you'd have to say, well, that really is not very sound\nreasoning because that is not a holding because the -- you\n-- you've got not merely to have recognized it under the\nstatute, but you've got to have held it. And that's --\nthat's pretty unlikely.\nMR. FELDMAN: It -- it says actually made\nretroactive, and I -- all of --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I guess we've said you've\ngot to do it with --\nMR. FELDMAN: -- all three of the opinions in\nTyler recognized that that sort of thing can happen, and I\nthink that that actually is by far the most common kind of\ncase because that's likely to be a case where the Court\nhas said, for example, where Teague doesn't apply at all\nwhere the Court has narrowed the scope substantially of a\nFederal criminal statute such as in the Bailey case where\n-- where the question was whether it has to be active use\nor mere possession of a firearm. And those kinds of cases\nare very possibly, at least if the Court has made it clear\nthat they're narrowing the -- the Court is narrowing the\nconduct that was thought to be criminal in construing a\ncriminal statute, those are the kinds of cases that are\nlikely to arise most often. In those kinds of cases, that\nis likely to be the kind of the thing the Court was\ntalking about in Tyler against Cain.\nWith respect to the other class of cases, which\nwould -- the only other class of retroactive cases would\nbe those that come within the second -- what used to be\ncalled the second Teague exception for bedrock principles\nthat have the primacy or centrality of Gideon against\nWainwright. Now, the Court has suggested -- it has said\nthat it may be doubted that any such rules remain to -- to\nbe discovered. But if there were, I think a court of -- a\ncase of that level of centrality and primacy and\nimportance, I think that this Court and other courts could\ntake steps to decide whatever pending section 2255 motions\nthey have or whatever ones could be filed by someone who\nstill has their 1 year to go from date of finality of\nconviction to decide those quite quickly because that\nwould be --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In those cases, would the\nGovernment ever on its own motion have a defendant retried\nor released? Has that ever happened?\nMR. FELDMAN: I -- you know, I -- for instance,\nI don't know what the history was.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't think it has. If --\nlet me ask you this. If -- if a decision says that what\nwas a crime, as defined to the jury, is no longer a crime\n-- the conduct was no longer a crime -- I take it Teague\ndoesn't necessarily apply to that, but this is still a\nsubstantive rule that's retroactive. Is that the way it\nworks?\nMR. FELDMAN: I think the -- what the Court has\nsaid and clarified most recently in the Summerlin case\nlast year is that those -- Teague doesn't apply. It's not\nan exception to Teague, but Teague doesn't apply because\nthose cases are retroactive without going through a\nparticular analysis under Teague.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But what -- what interest does\nthe Government have in holding somebody when the conduct\nfor which he was convicted is no longer a crime?\nMR. FELDMAN: The Government doesn't have any\ninterest in doing that. And I -- I think if the\nGovernment --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why don't you let the guy go?\nMR. FELDMAN: I would -- I would recommend the\nGovernment do that if we found a case. What actually\nhappens, of course, in real life is there's argument about\nwhat were -- what -- how was the jury actually instructed.\nDid the jury find the necessary fact? Was it just\nharmless error because this case was tried on a theory\nthat made it totally clear that he did commit the crime\neven as narrowed by this Court and those kinds of\nquestions arising.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's say he's being --\nMR. FELDMAN: I can't say how they would work\nthemselves out.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's say he's being held\nbecause the Government insists that it's not retroactive\nand the Government is then proven wrong. Would that let\nhim qualify under (2) because then the -- the impediment\nto making the motion was the fact that he thought it was\nnot retroactive, but then -- and that was Government\naction because that's what you insisted on. But then\nthat's removed. So does -- so would -- does entitlement\nunder (2) apply?\nMR. FELDMAN: I don't -- I don't think -- I\ndon't think so because I would only think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I don't think this is\ngoing to work.\nMR. FELDMAN: Yes. I don't think the Government\nholding somebody pursuant to a hitherto valid judgment\nwould be seen as an impediment to making an -- a motion.\nI think that would be the Government --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- well, but it is\nbecause he -- it hasn't been found retroactive yet and he\ncan't file --\nMR. FELDMAN: Well, but the -- the defendant --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- under your view.\nMR. FELDMAN: The fact that the Government is\nholding him doesn't prevent him from file. If the\nGovernment did actually prevent him from filing something,\nsaid you -- we're not going to take your mail that you're\ntrying to send to the court, I think that's the kind of\nthing --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you prevented him from\nfiling effectively. I mean --\nMR. FELDMAN: I don't think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- the petition has to be\ndismissed.\nMR. FELDMAN: I don't think the Government has.\nI think the Government has said, go ahead and file\nwhatever you want to file, and if you can obtain relief,\nthen you should get it.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.\nMR. FELDMAN: And if the Government itself\nconcludes that someone should be released, there are\nmechanisms to do that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's probably right.\nMR. FELDMAN: -- the Government could.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The language -- the language is\non your side, I think there's no doubt. But it's not\nunambiguous. Imagine a prison rule that says that the --\nafter the prison board, the -- the prisoner has 2 weeks to\nappeal to the warden from the time of the decision of the\nboard if the prisoner has been notified. The prisoner\nisn't notified for 3 weeks. I think we'd read that to say\nhe has 2 weeks from the time of notification. You -- you\ncan use can if in that way. It's not impossible. And\nonce I begin to think it could be open, I think, well,\nlet's look for the most practical approach.\nMR. FELDMAN: I think under that -- those\ncircumstances, there may be circumstances under which\nequitable tolling would be appropriate in a particular\ncase. That's the kind of thing that also --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You -- you'd say, well the\nlanguage is clear -- clear, but let's go -- let's go on\nequitable tolling.\nMR. FELDMAN: But I don't -- I wouldn't go here\non equitable tolling. In other words, I think maybe -- I\ndon't -- I can't imagine all the possible cases under\n6(3).\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. What you're saying is\nthe language.\nMR. FELDMAN: But where the event that you're\nrelying on for tolling would be an event that is\nanticipated in the statute and would be across the board\nand would really have nothing to do with the particular\nconduct of the petitioner's case, but whether someone else\nhas gone and gotten a retroactivity ruling, I think it\nwould be unprecedented in those circumstances to just\nrewrite the statute to come to a different date than what\nCongress had set. Congress set the date on which the\nright initially was recognized by this Court.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Mr. Dreeben, could I bring you\nback to the -- the issue? I'm sorry. Yes. Can I bring\nyou back to the issue of whether the Court that recognizes\nthe right has to be the Supreme Court or not? You say\nthere are three other instances in which it is specified\nthat it be the Supreme Court, and it's not specified here.\nBut does any of those other three instances involve\nlanguage like this which -- which has the Supreme Court\nmentioned immediately previously?\nI mean, when I read that the first time, has\nbeen newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made\nretroactively applicable to cases, I mean, I think what it\nenvisions is the -- the very decision of the Supreme Court\nthat newly recognized it made it retroactively applicable.\nIs -- is any of the other ones phrased this way so that\nthe word, the Supreme Court, is immediately preceding the\nand made retroactively applicable?\nMR. FELDMAN: You know, I'd -- I'd have to look\nat the -- I can tell you where the statutes are. One is\n8(2), of course, which is right in 2255.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. FELDMAN: The other is in 2244 which I think\nis worded exactly the same as this is. The third is I\nthink 2264, which I -- I just would have to look at the\nspecific wording of each of those.\nBut I think the -- you know, and this --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The proximity of the reference\nto the Supreme Court there really --\nMR. FELDMAN: But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- when you read it the first\ntime, you think they're talking about the Supreme Court.\nMR. FELDMAN: You could also --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Has been newly recognized by\nthe Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable.\nMR. FELDMAN: You could also -- you -- you\ncould, but you -- and we did take that position in Tyler.\nYou could also read it, though, the -- the presence of the\nword Supreme Court right before and the absence of the\nwords, the Supreme Court, here and the presence of the\nSupreme Court in the first one -- you could certainly draw\nthe inference that this was not something -- this part of\nit didn't have to be made by the Supreme Court. And\nperhaps Congress was recognizing that it -- it does take\nthis Court a longer time to reach a retroactivity decision\nthan it would take the lower courts hearing cases.\nOnce --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is there anything in any of\nthese statutes or legislative history or any -- anyplace\nelse where Congress ever thought of the possibility that\nsome other court might make a new rule retroactive?\nMR. FELDMAN: I don't think there's any\nstatement one way or another, but I do think there are\nholdings. There are holdings as -- as the petitioner\nrelies on by the Eleventh --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I think the other reading is\n-- the assumption was -- and I think it's incorrect --\nthat we would simultaneously identify the new right and\ndecide it is or is not retroactive. That was the\nassumption I think.\nMR. FELDMAN: I -- I just -- I think that would\nbe unlikely because this Court's practice has certainly\nnot since Teague and even going decades before Teague --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No. I realize it's wrong, but\nI think that's probably the assumption Congress made.\nThat's what I'm suggesting.\nMR. FELDMAN: I -- I guess I -- I would just\nthink it's unlikely because although this statute has some\ndrafting -- it certainly raises some drafting issues, I\nthink they likely -- that basic element of this Court's\nretroactivity jurisprudence, which has been true for\ndecades, I think likely --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: See, the only thing about your\nreading of the statute that troubles me is you're --\nyou're reading the word only. If it's a 1-year statute,\nbut only if Congress -- the Supreme Court has already done\nthe next two things. 1 year is the maximum.\nMR. FELDMAN: Just -- I'm reading it has an if.\nIf is a condition. If --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: There's an only --\nMR. FELDMAN: What if does is states a\ncondition.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It's not an if, but if that\nhappens, then it shall be --\nMR. FELDMAN: Right, because Congress didn't say\nit. If Congress had phrased this the way it phrased the\n-- the 6(3) as a whole and said it shall it run from the\nlater of three dates, the date that the Supreme Court\nholds it -- recognizes the right or the date it holds it\nretroactive, that would have -- that would have been --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: See, it really --\nMR. FELDMAN: -- that would have --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- would accomplish your\nobjective if you just struck the whole clause after the\nword if. You don't really need that.\nMR. FELDMAN: I -- I don't think so. I think\nwhat the clause does is it makes it clear that in 6(3),\nwhich is a -- you know, intended to be a narrow exception\nfrom the -- the rule of finality -- that in 6(3) what\nCongress was doing was saying this is the only class of\ncases that we want this to apply to. And if they had just\nsaid the date on which the right was initially recognized\nby the Supreme Court, I think there might have been some\ninference that they were not -- they were trying to extend\nthat beyond cases that are retroactive under Teague, or\nperhaps someone might have read that and said, you know,\nTeague is no longer applicable. Now Congress has a new\nstandard that it's enacted here.\nAnd I think Congress wanted make clear -- the\npeople who drafted this -- that that was not what they\nwere trying to do. And by saying made retroactive -- if\nit has been newly recognized and made retroactive to cases\non collateral review, what they were plainly referring to\nwas this Court's jurisprudence under Teague so that no one\nwould think this deadline is supposed to somehow open the\ndoor to cases that would otherwise be barred by Teague.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what courts in -- in\nyour view have to make the retroactivity finding? The\ndistrict court? The circuit where he's -- which has\njurisdiction over his case? Any circuit?\nMR. FELDMAN: I think every court that has\naddressed that question has come to the conclusion that it\ncan be -- it has to be the circuit with territorial\njurisdiction over the applicant's case. That's generally\nthe jurisdiction of courts of appeals and the area in\nwhich their rulings are effective.\nIt also could be, in our view, the district\ncourt that's hearing the particular defendant's case\nbecause that's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If it's not that -- if it\nisn't the district court in that case, then you -- the\ndistrict court has to take this complaint and just freeze\nit until some other -- a higher court rules on it.\nMR. FELDMAN: Yes. I don't see any -- I don't\nthink that that would be the appropriate thing to do. I\nthink if -- if the view was that this had to -- it\ncouldn't be filed until a court with jurisdiction over the\ncase had actually held that the right was retroactive,\nthen I think the correct course for the district court\nwould be to dismiss it because it's -- it's not -- it's\nnot a timely petition. At the time when it's filed,\nthere's -- it's -- we're assuming 1 year past the date\nthat the conviction became final, and there's no other\nprovision at that point that can render it timely. And at\nthat point, the correct course for the district court\nwould be just to dismiss it.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So that if 10 other circuits\nhave ruled on this but not his own, there's nothing he can\ndo until somebody within the 1-year window files.\nMR. FELDMAN: Our view -- well, that -- that --\nif -- if the -- the made retroactive has to occur before\nhe files, that would be the consequence. But our view is\nit can be made retroactive in his own case, and therefore,\nanyone can file. They have a 1-year window from the time\nwhen a new right is recognized, and if in their own case\nit's held to be retroactive, then they were timely and\nthey may well get relief depending --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So far as first habe goes.\nMR. FELDMAN: So far as first habeas goes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Second habe, he's out cold.\nMR. FELDMAN: I -- I think that it's -- I don't\n-- second habeas is definitely a narrower window, and I\nthink Congress intended it to be a narrower window. But\nfor the reasons I said, there are decisions where the\nCourt holds -- where this Court recognizes, in effect, the\nretroactivity of a new rule at the same time as it\nannounces it, as the Court said in Tyler. And there are\n-- this Court and lower courts can act quickly on these\nkinds of things. If the kind of bedrock principle with\nthe primacy and centrality of Gideon against Wainwright\ncame up, I think the lower courts would see we have to act\nvery quickly on this.\nI -- one point of note is that Richardson\nitself, which the Government doesn't believe is\nretroactive, but that's not before the Court here -- the\nfirst decision holding Richardson retroactive came down 7\nmonths after this Court decided Richardson. The second --\nand that was where no one was thinking they had to\nparticularly rush on that.\nBut if this Court were to recognize a new right\nunder -- a -- a new right that satisfied the second Teague\nexception, I think it can be expected because it would\nnecessarily be -- have a certain primacy and centrality\nand sweep that there would probably be cases pending in\nthe courts of appeals, in the district courts raising that\nissue, and I think the courts involved, if they -- this\nCourt said, look, this is -- this is the way the thing has\nto be understood in accordance with --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What it would do -- let's take\na case which I guess we -- Apprendi. I mean, you know,\nApprendi, a big sort of an issue in the courts. And --\nand this would put tremendous pressure on us to decide it\nimmediately, wouldn't it? We'd have to say immediately\nwhether it was going to be retroactive or not retroactive\nbecause it's only likely to come along in some major,\nmajor matter like that, other than the kind Justice\nKennedy said, which is another kind of problem.\nI mean, I don't see a way, if we take your\napproach, of getting out of this tremendous pressure.\nMaybe it would be a good thing. But I don't think there's\na way of getting out of it.\nMR. FELDMAN: I think this Court has -- has to\ntake cases and plan its docket in accordance with a wide\nvariety of considerations and that may be something that\nthe Court would want to take into consideration.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what do you think about\nthe -- it seems to me we've tried three approaches, each\nof which try to get us out of this problem of the\npressure, call it. And we have Justice Stevens' and then\n-- but there were certain problems with Justice Souter's,\nwhich still I'm not certain might -- then I had started\nwith one that I guess the objection to it would be it's\nlaughable. But -- but is there -- is there any -- I mean,\nyou see, it's -- it's reading -- it's reading the word\nright in 6 to encompass all of the paragraph in 8. Is\nthere anything -- I mean, it's a pretty good objection\nthat really that just goes too far.\nMR. FELDMAN: I -- I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But is there any other\nobjection?\nMR. FELDMAN: I think essentially the same one,\nthat -- that they use the term right in 6 and they didn't\nintend that term to mean something different, whether it\nwas a first habeas or a second habeas.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you --\nMR. FELDMAN: They were talking about the right\nthat was asserted.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this question?\nIsn't it true that under some of the other references they\nrefer to a constitutional right?\nMR. FELDMAN: That's right. That's another --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Whereas this just refers to a\nright and it includes statutory rights. And, of course,\nthe odd thing about that is that normally when we construe\na statute, we say it always meant that. It's not -- it's\nnot a new right in the sense as a right as of the date of\nenactment.\nMR. FELDMAN: But --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So the difference between the\nConstitution and statutes sometimes is rather significant.\nMR. FELDMAN: Yes. In paragraph 8(2) only --\nonly -- it does require a constitutional right. But in --\nin 6(3) it refers just to right. But, as I said, that\nwould, I think, encompass the class of cases such as\nBailey where this Court interprets a Federal statute and\nnarrows it and makes conduct that was thought to violate\nthe statute earlier -- it means that conduct no longer\nviolates it. Those kinds of decisions may well under --\nif the Court has made those points clear, if that clearly\nis what this Court decided, those cases may well be\nretroactive at the time they're announced under the\nrationale that all the opinions in Tyler against Cain\naccepted.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Feldman, is there any case\nin which the Supreme Court newly recognizes a right in\nwhich it does not initially recognize the right?\nMR. FELDMAN: I think there's sound -- those\nseem to me to be synonymous and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they're -- they're -- I\nthought your position was newly recognized means that it\n-- it has to be the kind of a right that would -- would\novercome our usual bar to -- to, you know, rights that\nexisted before.\nMR. FELDMAN: That's correct. But I think\ninitially recognizing may well be another way of saying\nthe same thing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Every -- every newly recognized\nis an -- is an initially recognized, although every\ninitially recognized is not necessarily a newly\nrecognized. Is that it?\nMR. FELDMAN: I was actually thinking of it the\nother way around.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The other way around?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FELDMAN: Which -- but that -- that -- where\nthis Court has --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't know who wrote this\neither, do you?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FELDMAN: No, I don't. No, I don't. No, I\ndon't.\nBut I think the point of the newly -- in fact,\nif you look at -- if you kind of flip it, the point of\nthis provision can -- maybe becomes a little bit clearer.\nIt's if -- if you start with the if, if the petition is\nbased on a right that is newly recognized and made\nretroactive to cases on collateral review, that's the\nclass. If that happened --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Sure.\nMR. FELDMAN: -- then the time runs from the\ndate on which it was initially recognized. In other\nwords --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which would have been the date\non which it was newly recognized.\nMR. FELDMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So why couldn't they say, the\ndate on which the right asserted was newly recognized by\nthe Supreme Court if it has been made retroactively\napplicable? Wouldn't that have been a more --\nMR. FELDMAN: That -- that would have been\nbetter. I would definitely agree with that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But what about -- I think the\nprincipal argument that Ms. Bergmann made was your reading\nmeans people -- you're encouraging filings that inevitably\nwill be thrown out because the right will be made\nretroactive?\nMR. FELDMAN: I think I just have a couple of\nanswers to that. One is that when Congress enacts a\nstatute of limitations, any statute of limitations has the\neffect of pushing people into court who might otherwise\nlike to wait. And that was a predictable result that\nCongress would have surely known when it enacted this.\nI --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the other -- the other\nway avoids loading the district court with filings that\nare futile.\nMR. FELDMAN: But -- and which -- many of which\nmay be quite easy to -- to dismiss.\nBut I would say Ms. Bergmann's reading has a\nkind of -- the opposite problem with it, which is under\nher reading the -- no one -- when a court holds something\nretroactive can -- is an unpredictable matter. And under\nher reading, nobody -- even where there's a right that's\nrather important and that should be retroactive, no one\ncould get relief until an appropriate court has held it\nretroactive, which could take years. It could be never.\nAnd if the Court -- and I think that that reading of that\n-- therefore, I think that that -- that reading has just\nthe opposite problem.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You see, you're -- you're\nsaying --\nMR. FELDMAN: What Congress wanted --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that the district court\nshould take these filings, should not hold them. It\nshould itself make the retroactivity determination.\nMR. FELDMAN: It can do that subject to appeal\nand ultimately certiorari in this Court.\nI think, though, that ultimately what Congress\nwanted was a 1-year period after this Court initially\nrecognizes a new right. When the -- for that -- that\nperiod of time the finality that is so important to the\ncriminal law is -- does -- is suspended to a certain\ndegree. People can litigate the issue. After that, the\ncriminal law can go back to its retributive, deterrent\npurposes which can only be achieved if finality is\nrecognized.\nI think, in particular, when you're talking\nabout section 2255 motions, frequently the relief, if\nthere is any, is going to be a new trial. And there's a\nparticular cost, as the Court has recognized, of trying to\nretry somebody many, many years after an initial\nconviction. Sometimes it means, in effect, it's just an\nacquittal because you can't find the witnesses or you can\nno longer prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. And I\nthink, therefore, Congress said, all right, well if\nthere's a new right, that's a sufficiently exceptional\ncircumstance, that we can suspend that finality for a\nbrief period, but 1 year and that's all. These things\nshouldn't come out 10 years later or 15 years later or\n20 years later.\nAnd that was the purpose, I think a perfectly\nreasonable purpose that Congress intended to serve here.\nAnd I think that actually the language of it, which says 1\nyear from the date on which the right asserted was\ninitially recognized by this Court, accomplishes that\npurpose.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Your -- your position is\nstrengthened by the other three provisions of the statute\nthat mentioned this, but it's not controlled by that, I\ntake it. You think it's unambiguous just as it read -- as\nit's read on its own.\nMR. FELDMAN: I think that the date -- there's\nonly one possible date that can be found in this language.\nUnless the Court felt that it had to completely rewrite\nit, there's only one date, the date on which the right\nasserted was initially recognized by this Court. And even\nif -- whatever problems the if clause have -- has, that\nmay mean that this -- not very many people -- the worst it\nwould mean is that not many people can take advantage of\nthat date.\nBut unless it's -- that date is -- there's\nsomething unconstitutional, which no one has suggested,\nabout Congress picking that date and that limitations\nperiod for people who have had the chance to litigate\nthings on direct review -- in any event, it had 1 year\nfrom the date their conviction became final. Unless\nthere's something wrong with that, I think that the Court\nshould follow the terms of the statute, and the time\nshould run 1 year from the date on which the right was\ninitially recognized.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nFeldman.\nMs. Bergmann, you have 6 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JANICE L. BERGMANN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. BERGMANN: Just several quick points.\nI'd like to start with the last point that Mr.\nFeldman made saying that there is only possible date under\nwhich the limitation period can run and -- and cautioning\nthe Court about rewriting that date. What the Government\nneglects to mention is that it's asking this Court to\nrewrite the if clause by changing Congress' use of verb\ntense from a past tense to -- to something that could\nhappen in the future. They want this Court to read that\nlanguage contrary to Tyler, contrary to the use of verb\ntense and allow a district court to make a retroactivity\ndecision at some time in the future in every case in which\na motion is filed under paragraph 6(3).\nThe second point I'd like to make is that the --\nin situations such as this that involve these kinds of\nimportant rights, interests in finality are at an ebb.\nThese are the types of rights where someone may well be\ninnocent of the crime for which they are incarcerated,\nthat involve important rights that go to the accuracy of\nthe underlying adjudication. It seems to me in these\ncircumstances, there is -- it is a situation where\nCongress' need or -- or the need of the courts to enforce\nfinality to keep people in jail are at their lowest point.\nThese are very special rights and Congress went to the\ntrouble of drafting and enacting paragraph 6(3) and\nparagraph 8(2) to protect these rights. And -- and I\nthink the Court should read them as broadly as possible in\norder to protect those rights.\nJustice Scalia asked a question about the\ndifference between newly recognized and initially\nrecognized. I wanted to go back to that for a minute.\nThere are circumstances where a -- let me see if\nI can get this right -- where a -- a right may be newly\nrecognized but not yet initially recognized. And I would\n-- I would point the Court's attention -- the decision in\nPenry. In Penry v. Lynaugh, this Court stated that if\nthere was an Eighth Amendment bar to the execution of\nmentally retarded individuals, that would be a new right\nthat would be retroactively applicable to collateral\ncases. But then the Court declined to initially recognize\nthe Eighth Amendment right. It wasn't until Atkins was\ndecided that the Eighth Amendment right was initially\nrecognized. And so --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it didn't newly -- it\ndidn't newly recognize it either, did it?\nMS. BERGMANN: Well, it -- it -- I would say\nthat it -- it recognized that it was new and that seems to\nbe the way the courts have interpreted --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It was -- it recognized that\nwhen it would be initially recognized, it would be newly\ninitially recognized.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. BERGMANN: That's correct, Your Honor, but I\nwould say that there would be no additional decision of\nthis Court that would be necessary for -- for someone to\nconclude that all three provisions of paragraph 6(3) had\nbeen met.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I see your point.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought it could be, if you\nwant to play games, there is an imaginary right to which\nBlackstone has referred 48 times. Yet, for some odd\nreason, that right has never come to the Supreme Court of\nthe United States. But one day it does. It is a right of\nconstitutional dimensions embedded in the law of stoppage\nin transitu. And although it's well recognized, we've\nnever had a case. Finally, we get one, and it is\ninitially recognized here, but it is not newly recognized\nfor every treatise on stoppage in transitu has long\nassumed that it was part of the law of the United States.\nI don't know. That's what I thought it was.\nMS. BERGMANN: Well, yes, Your Honor. There --\nthere are -- every time this Court issues a decision,\nsomeone could argue that it initially recognizes a right,\nand whether that right is new in the Teague sense or\nold --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I take it that what I've just\nsaid is of total irrelevance to everything. Is -- is that\nright?\n(Laughter.)\nMS. BERGMANN: No. I disagree, Your Honor. I\nmean, there are circumstances where this Court initially\nrecognizes rights, but then later on determines that they\nare not new, that they are indeed old. That happened in\nSimmons v. South Carolina. The Court recognizes --\nrecognized a right to present certain types of mitigation\nevidence in the penalty phase of a capital case, but then\nthe Court later determined that that was not a new right.\nIt was an old right in the Teague sense, and so it,\ntherefore, applied retroactively because it was an old\nright but it did not newly recognize it at the time that\nit initially recognized it. And I'm sorry for the\nlinguistic -- but it -- it is complicated.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not your fault.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm laughing at the statute,\nnot at you.\nMS. BERGMANN: Thank you, Your Honor.\nI just wanted to say in closing that -- that it\nis a difficult statute, but I think that Mr. Dodd's\ninterpretation of the statute best respects Congress' use\nof tense and is consistent with the reading of paragraph\n8(2) that this Court gave in Tyler.\nIt also respects Congress' intention to create a\nspecific exception for new rights that apply retroactively\nand by allowing for the realistic possibility of -- of\nsuccess in either an initial or a second or successive\nmotion premised on such rights.\nIt also, as we've discussed, promotes judicial\nefficiency by eliminating from it frivolous motions\nbecause litigants would not file until it was clear that\nthey actually had a right to collateral relief.\nIn sum, this Court should conclude that the\ntriggering date is when all three of the prerequisites\nhave been met. In this case, that would be when the\nEleventh Circuit decided Ross v. Richardson.\nI guess my -- my final concern is for my client.\nIf the Court constructs a rule where the Supreme Court\nwould have to be the court that makes the retroactivity\ndecision, I hope the Court will consider the effect of\nsuch a rule on someone like my client who filed\nprematurely on -- in -- in hopes that at some point his\narguably meritorious Richardson claim would be heard.\nWhether the Court decides that those premature filings\nshould be dismissed without prejudice or if there's some\nkind of analysis the lower courts should take in resolving\nthose claims --\nJUSTICE BREYER: How -- how is -- how does that\nwork? I mean, can you explain that a little?\nMS. BERGMANN: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose he did -- he hasn't\nviolated the statute of limitations. He -- he filed it\nbefore a year ran from the time that we finally recognized\nit because we haven't even recognized it yet.\nMS. BERGMANN: Well, that would be my argument,\nYour Honor, that he was premature.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But what is premature? What\nprevents a person from being premature? They just might\nlose on the merits of their claim is all, and he might\nanyway.\nMS. BERGMANN: That's -- that's if the Court\nwould allow the retroactivity decision to be made in the\n-- on an initial motion by the district court in that\nparticular case. Am I correct? Maybe I'm\nmisunderstanding you, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. I -- I was the one who's\nhaving a problem. I -- I didn't see how your client would\nbe hurt if we adopted Justice Stevens' --\nMS. BERGMANN: Well, the problem is that some\nlower courts have held that if you -- you file a motion\nthat's untimely --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms.\nBergmann.\nMS. BERGMANN: Thank you, Your Honor.\n"
