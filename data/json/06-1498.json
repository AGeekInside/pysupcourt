        "content": "(11:05 a.m.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The Court will hear\nargument in Warner-Lambert against Kimberly Kent.\nMr. Phillips, whenever you're ready we will be\nhappy to hear you?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Justice Stevens,\nand may it please the Court:\nSix years ago, this Court in Buckman\nrecognized that policing fraud against Federal agencies\nis hardly a field the states have traditionally\noccupied. Based on that premise, this Court in Buckman\nstruck down a novel State tort that was based on the\nwhole concept of fraud on the FDA.\nAnd the Court concluded that that tortious\nanalysis as a matter of State law would inevitably\nconflict with the FDA's responsibility to police fraud.\nA responsibility that the Court recognized was\nessentially cradle to grave covered by Federal law. It\narises out of Federal law, it is regulated by Federal\nlaw and it is ultimately terminated by Federal law.\nMichigan has adopted a unique product\nliability statute, and on the one hand confers a very\nbroad immunity of defense against all product liability\nclaims for manufacturers who comply with the FDA's\nrequirements.\nBut then on the other hand, withdraws that\nimmunity for the defense, this is PDA App. 42A, if the\nmanufacturer intentionally withholds from or\nmisrepresents to the United States Food and Drug\nAdministration information concerning the drug that is\nrequired to be submitted pursuant to -- and then it goes\nand lists very specific provisions of the Food, Drug,\nand Cosmetic Act -- and the drug would not have been\napproved or the Food and Drug Administration would have\nwithdrawn approval.\nIt is difficult for me to imagine a statute\nthat would more consciously and openly tread into\nexactly the same territory that this Court declared in\nBuckman as a matter of exclusive Federal and concern not\navailable to the states to regulate.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Phillips, what if the\nstatute didn't have that provision, but it just said you\ncan bring a State tort action when the conditions\napproved by the FDA for the marketing of this drug have\nnot been complied with? That's all it says. Now, would\nyou knowledge that that -- that that suit could be\nbrought?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I will acknowledge that's a\nfundamentally different issue, Justice Scalia, because\nthere you are talking about what duties are owed to the\npublic that are enforced by the FDA and potentially are\nenforceable by the states as well.\nBut here we're talking about duties that are\nowed from the manufacturer exclusively --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's a duty that is defined\nby the FDA. And I didn't hear your answer. Would that\nsuit be allowable or not?\nMR. PHILLIPS: That suit would not be\nbarred, I don't think, by Buckman. I think the question\nthere will really go to what the Court is going to\ndecide next term in Wyeth as to how far when if you have\nFDA approval of certain activities that that has the\neffect of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't seem to me --\nwhat I worry about is that if we say in this case it\ntreads too much into the FDA's own responsibility to say\nwhat material should have been provided to the FDA, it\nseems to me the next what could be more central to the\nFDA -- to the FDA's job than determining whether the\nconditions the FDA prescribed for the marketing of the\ndrug have indeed been observed? That's central as well.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I don't think it is an\nunreasonable next step, but it is clearly the next step\nthat has to be taken. Because what this Court decided\nin Buckman -- and it's central and candidly we are here\nseeking a very narrow ruling from the Court is that when\nyou're defining the relationship between the\nmanufacturer and the seller of the drugs and the FDA in\nterms of the disclosure of information to that entity\nand the determination both whether that information is\nadequate to allow the agency to perform its business and\nthen, more fundamentally, whether or not the agency is\nacting in accordance with its own exclusive authority to\ndecide how to proceed --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But one can also reason in\nthe opposite direction; that is to say, one can know\nfrom the medical devices portion of the FDA that\nCongress has no objection to private tort actions\nthat -- where the medical device manufacturer has not\nobserved the requirements that the FDA's approval\nimpose, right? We know from that section that Congress\nhas no objection to that there.\nYou can probably guess that Congress has no\nobjection to it in the -- in the drug field as well as\nthe medical devices field. And if I make that guess,\nwhat is so different about having a jury second-guess\nthe provision of information portion?\nMR. PHILLIPS: It seems to me that the same\nargument you just made, Justice Scalia, would have led\nthe Court to the opposite result in Buckman, because\nwhat's the -- you know, if Congress didn't care about\nallowing State tort law to be -- to serve as the\nenforcement mechanism, then why wouldn't you allow them\nto do that in that context as well?\nAnd this Court said the reason is because\nthere is a very uniquely Federal interest in taking care\nof the business and the relationship between those two\nentities.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, It is -- it is more\nof a stick in the eye of the Federal Government to\ncreate a cause of action that consists of defrauding the\nFederal Government, which is what was at issue in\nBuckman. The very cause of action was providing false\ninformation to the FDA. Here the cause of action is a\nstandard tort cause of action for marketing a defective\nproduct.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, when you say \"here\"\nwhat we're talking -- what we're talking about here is a\nvery unique State statute that is the sole basis on\nwhich the tort liability is set aside.\nWe're not -- we're not pre-empting the\nunderlying tort claims by the Federal law that's at\nissue in this case. The State statute pre-empts the\ncommon law court claims. That first portion of the\ndefense wipes those out. So it's not pre-emption of the\ntraditional State law cause of action, as the Second\nCircuit wrongly evaluated it. What we're talking about\nhere is a provision that in the most exquisite terms\nsays: Allow the State, either by the court or the\njuries, to evaluate the adequacy of the information that\nthe FDA required.\nAnd it's important to understand how that\nplays out, because what it says is pursuant to those\nstatutes. It specifically identifies provisions in the\nstatutes. It doesn't say anything about how the FDA --\nhow the FDA interprets those statutes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Phillips, isn't --\nisn't the standard -- in the standard tort claim, no\nMichigan statute, but a defense that's available to a\ndrug manufacturer who is charged with putting on the\nmarket a defective drug, its regulatory compliance,\nright?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And so the State of\nMichigan has said: Drug dealers -- I'm sorry -- drug\nsellers --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- drug manufacturers, we\nare going to give you an invigorated defense. Instead\nof just saying you show regulatory compliance, we're\ngoing to take you off the hook altogether, except if you\ndidn't come clean with the FDA, if you withheld\ninformation or misrepresented information.\nIt seems to me that what -- you could say\nthis is just like Buckman, but you could also say this\nis giving the manufacturer an invigorated regulatory\ncompliance defense.\nSo why shouldn't it be looked at as the\nsecond, rather than the first?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think what you're\nbasically arguing for is an argument I think one of the\namici made on the other side, which is: Does the\ngreater power include the lesser power? That is, if we\nhad the authority not to give you a defense in the first\nplace, don't we have the authority to use this as a\nlever in order to allow us essentially to undertake to\nregulate in precisely the same way the FDA would?\nAnd the answer is: No, because this is not\na situation --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You're arguing an\nunconstitutional condition, in effect.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think it is an\nunconstitutional condition. But I think the bottom line\nis it's not a question of us taking the bad with the\ngood. The problem here is that the Federal Government\nhas an independent interest, and it is the Federal\nGovernment's independent interest that is being\nessentially wiped away.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If you're right in your\nargument, the Michigan statute provided two things: One\ngood for the manufacturer, immunity; two, a\nqualification on it. It seems to me that those two\ncan't be unstuck. So to strike out one, as was done in\nthe Sixth Circuit case, and not the other is certainly\nnot faithful to the Michigan legislature that put these\ntwo things together.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Ginsburg, that's\nclearly a question of State law. I mean, that's a\nseverability issue to be sure. And I -- but I think\nit's not fair to condemn the way the Sixth Circuit\nanalyzed this case.\nWhat the Sixth Circuit said is if it's still\navailable to the State to come in after the FDA has both\nfound that there has been a material deception of one\nsort or another and that the FDA has decided to withdraw\nthe product as a consequence of that, and that -- and\nthen State law is allowed to come in and enforce product\nliability claims under those circumstances, that the\nlegislature would have been perfectly satisfied with\nthat arrangement.\nAnd, candidly, that is precisely what we\nhave asked for before both the Second Circuit and this\nCourt.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Phillips, May I ask\nthis question that's related to Justice Ginsburg's, but\nnot the same. You are saying that the defense is not\npre-empted; the response to the defense is what is\npre-empted here.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Correct.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What if you didn't have a\nstatute at all and you just had a common law lawsuit in\nwhich you defended on the ground of compliance with the\nFederal statute shows, the Federal program, shows a lack\nof negligence. And then it then came back with the\nrebuttal: Yes, but your compliance was tainted by\nfraud, the same kind of thing. Would that response be\npre-empted in a common law lawsuit?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think the question goes to\nhow far that response goes. If you in fact instructed,\nif the trial judge instructed the jury that if it found,\nand then just quoted the language of the statute that\nthere's no, then I'd say, yes, that is pre-empted in\nprecisely the same way.\nAnd the language the Court used in Buckman\nwas \"critical element.\" If the FDA's regulatory\nauthority is a critical element of the case, then, yes,\nit is pre-empted.\nWhether or not -- whether evidence by itself\nwould be a critical element is harder to tell.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just finish with\none other thought before --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Sure.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In one of your arguments\nand the government's argument, this is very burdensome\nto the FDA because we have all this litigation. In all\nthe years we have had this kind of tort litigation, has\nthis issue ever proved to be burdensome to the\ngovernment in any of these -- these attempts to make out\nthis charge and this defense?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I mean, the government is\nprobably in a better position to evaluate that than I\nam. But, you know --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Because It seems to me\nthat we have three or four States that have these\nstatutes.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But most States don't have\nthese statutes. I wonder if the problem is really as\nserious as everybody --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think what the Court\nsaid in Buckman about that probably applies equally\nhere, which is that, rather than look to see whether\nthere is, in fact, going to be an interference, we ought\nto recognize that this is a territory that is locked off\nexclusively to the Federal Government's control, and we\nshouldn't -- and there shouldn't be that external pull,\nthe extraneous pull, that State law provides under these\ncircumstances.\nAnd the same logic obviously applied here\nwould say: We don't wait until there's a serious\ninterference with how the FDA is trying to do its job;\nwe try to prevent that because there's no -- there's no\nlegitimate State interest to be served here.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think there can\nalso be the same argument for pre-empting the section,\nthe subpart (b) of Michigan statute, the bribery\nexception?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No. I think there's a\ndifference between the bribery statute, because again\nthat doesn't go to the direct relationship between the\nmanufacturer or the seller or the regulated entity and\nthe FDA itself. That goes to the relationship\nbetween -- that -- that is governed by a different set\nof laws.\nAnd I think it's traditionally been the case\nthat States are in fact entitled to enforce laws against\nbribery of Federal officials. So I don't think the same\n-- as I say, what I'm looking for here is an extremely\nnarrow ruling from this Court.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about the defense\nitself, which says that the defense is available if not\nonly the drug was approved for safety and efficacy, but\nalso if the drug and its labeling were in compliance\nwith the FDA's approval at the time the drug left the\ncontrol of the manufacturer?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is it wrong to say that\nthat's -- you know, that that's interfering with the\nFDA's bailiwick?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think when the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are you going to let a jury\ndecide that?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, I'm not going to let a\njury decide that.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PHILLIPS: What the district court found\nhere, obviously, was that there was compliance, because\nthe other side didn't challenge the compliance.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Uh-huh.\nMR. PHILLIPS: And, candidly, I think that\nis going to happen 99.999 percent of the time, because\nthat's not going to be the issue.\nBut, you know, could it eventually be a\nproblem if a State jury -- if a State court were to\ndecide that there hasn't been compliance? It seems to\nme that's much closer, again, to what you're going to\ntake up again next term in Wyeth.\nI think that is a legitimate issue, but it's\na very different one from the question of how do you\nregulate the relationship between a -- the regulated\nentity and the FDA in terms of the information flow that\ngoes between those two entities.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me what you\nare saying is: We're going to win this case even if\nthere were no pre-emption.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Even if there is no\npre-emption on -- on the -- well, I hope I win this case\nregardless.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Because they have such a\nburden of proving that the drug wouldn't, in fact, have\nbeen withdrawn and so forth.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, well -- you mean I\nwould have won this case on the merits of it?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, clearly we know\nthat the FDA didn't withdrew this as a consequence of\nfraud. So in that sense, I suppose you're right, but --\nbut the reality is that the more fundamental problem\nremains, whether or not these kinds of statutes are\nstill out there, are going to create this -- as the\nCourt said -- extraneous pull.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Let's just say you use\nsomething like primary jurisdiction said that they\nactually have to -- to withdraw it. Now, if the FDA --\nthis is what Justice Stevens said in his concurring\nopinion, which I thought had a lot to be said for it --\nthat if you had a system where the FDA did withdraw it\nand found fraud, you could ask them, and then nothing\nwrong with the plaintiff going ahead there.\nMR. PHILLIPS: We don't have any problem\nwith that, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You don't have any problem.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, we were very --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's not --\nMR. PHILLIPS: If the Court wanted to go\nthat way, that's fine. I don't think it's presented in\nthis case, but that wouldn't present any problem for us.\nI think what we -- what we have here is the Second\nCircuit is wrong, and the judgment should be reversed.\nThank you, Your Honors.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Phillips.\nMr. Joseffer.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL JOSEFFER,\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. JOSEFFER: Justice Stevens, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Michigan statute presents the same\nconflict this Court found in Buckman, because it\nrequires the determination of fraud on the FDA as a\nnecessary predicate for establishing liability. And as\nthis Court explained in Buckman, the relationship\nbetween a Federal agency and the entities it regulates\nis inherently Federal. And that's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Does your argument carry to\nthe point of the same argument when regulatory\ncompliance is raised as a defense, or regulatory\nviolation is raised as a ground for liability?\nMR. JOSEFFER: It could depend, because in\nour view what's pre-empted here is a State court\ndetermination -- under Buckman, what's pre-empted is a\nState court determination of whether the FDA was\ndefrauded as part of FDA's approval process. So, for\nexample, under any circumstance, if a jury is being\ninstructed to find whether FDA was defrauded as part of\nthe approval process, we'd say there's pre-emption.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, whenever you --\nwhenever you raise FDA compliance, there is at least the\npotential for a response that they -- they defrauded the\nFDA; they didn't tell them what they should have, and --\nyou know, vice versa, when -- when it's raised on the\nother side.\nSo you always have the potential there for\n-- for just what concerns you, don't you?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well -- and what we would say\nis not pre-empted -- I mean, it's hard to analyze this\nin the abstract without a record as to what a jury was\nactually being asked to do. But if you had a situation\nwhere it was, say, a design defect claim, and the jury\nwas being asked to decide whether this design is\ndefective, and that's what it's looking at, and in\nconnection with that the jury is instructed that two\nrelevant things it can consider are, first, the fact of\nFDA's approval determination and, second, the\ncircumstances surrounding that approval determination,\nthen that by itself, we would say, is not pre-empted by\nBuckman, really for two reasons. One is that\npre-emption normally applies to legal theories, such as\nclaims or defenses, not the mere admissibility of\nevidence; and the second is that FDA's core prerogatives\nhere, as the administrator of its own drug approval\nprocess, are to determine whether it has been defrauded\nand what to do about that. And if the jury is not being\nasked to find those things, but instead is just\nconsidering evidence in connection with something else,\nwe would say that that is what's not pre-empted.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So it's the withdrawal\nelement, withdrawal of approval that kills it here?\nMR. JOSEFFER: That's part of it but not all\nof it. I mean, in our view, FDA, as the administrator\nof its own approval process, needs absolute discretion\nto determine what must be submitted to it as part of its\nown approval process, whether it is misled as part of\nits own approval process; whether as you said it would\nhave made a different determination in the absence of\nany fraud.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if you get beyond the\nelement of what the FDA would have done if it had known,\nthen it seems to me you get into an issue which is\nlikely to arise by -- whenever, by one side or the\nother, the question of regulatory approval is -- is\noffered as a mere matter of evidence.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, if it really is a mere\nmatter of evidence, and that's not what the jury is be\nasked to find -- and by the way, it's not at all clear\nthat there's -- that there's -- it's settled common law\ntradition in this type of litigation, because the\ncontext here, where a Federal agency does a\nproduct-specific approval based in part on a submission\nof information from a manufacturer, that's not a --\nthat's a question that, first, is of relatively modern\nvintage and, second, is not terribly common. So there's\nnot really a uniform, deeply rooted common law tradition\nhere. But if all we were talking about was the mere\nadmissibility of evidence, we would agree that that was\nnot pre-empted. But if you look at --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but that's what you've\ngot here, except that the mere admissibility of the\nevidence turns in part on what the -- the FDA would have\ndone.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, no --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But essentially -- I mean\nyou -- the fact is the evidence of the FDA approval is\nmade admissible and conclusive, and whether that in fact\nmay be admitted is subject to the -- what is it --\nclause (b) that you object to, but it comes down to a\nquestion of admissibility.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, it's not because the\nstatute expressly requires, as a predicate for\nliability, a finding that the information disclosure\nrequirements of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act\nwere violated. The jury has to find what was required\nto be submitted to FDA, was it submitted to FDA and was\nFDA misled? And if you had a State administrative\nagency that was set up to tell companies what they must\nor must not submit to FDA, as part of FDA's own approval\nprocess, the conflict with FDA's ability to administer\nits own approval process would be manifest. And it's no\ndifferent -- as in Regal, the juries instead of agencies\nwould be making those determinations in individual\ncases.\nAnd if I could illustrate the concern which\nthis Court explained in Buckman, it's that -- just two\nFDA regulations. The first explains that the technical\nsection of a new drug application must provide\ninformation and data in sufficient detail to permit the\nagency to make a knowledgeable judgment. Now, because\nthat is an extremely subjective standard, another FDA\nregulation -- and by the way, these are on pages 142a\nand 186a of the petition appendix -- the second goes on\nto explain that the type and quantity of information\nthat must be submitted to FDA necessarily depends on the\nparticular drug.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this sort of\ngeneral question? Apart from Buckman itself, which\ndescribes a very serious theoretical problem, as I\nunderstand it, there must have been a fair amount of\nlitigation over the years where the regulatory\ncompliance defense was raised or challenged or so forth.\nIs there -- are there any reported cases describing the\nmagnitude of the problem to the government, when the --\nas the result of debate about these issues?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Nothing that -- that that's\nbeyond the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The whole theoretical\nproblem.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, it's also a relatively\nnew problem, and what -- because -- because it's --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The litigation is not, not\nnew.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Right, but the\nproduct-specific approvals, and the desire to probe into\nthe circumstances surrounding a product-specific\napproval, is of relatively modern vintage. And Buckman\nitself stands for the proposition that that was not a\ntraditional State inquiry at that time. And Buckman\ncertainly has not encouraged a significant increase in\nsuch litigation since then. So this is something that\nthere's not been a whole lot of.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Leaving aside Buckman,\nwhat's your strongest case in support of your position?\nBesides that it is a new problem.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, it is. It's a novel\ntype of situation where you're -- where you're talking\nabout the Federal Government's prerogatives to\nadminister its own approval processes. There hasn't\nbeen a lot of State court litigation on this, in part\nbecause it's so obviously a Federal matter. I mean, if\na State supreme court wanted to tell litigants, private\nlitigants before this Court what they could and couldn't\nsay in their briefs to this Court, the conflict would be\nobvious and therefore the State supreme court would\nnever do it. And you have a similar problem here where\nthe State is essentially telling companies what they\nmust or must not be telling FDA, and there's just an\nobvious intrusion there with FDA's ability to administer\nits own approval process.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Joseffer, let's\nassume that -- that you're right. The Second Circuit,\nbecause it thought your position it was wrong, never got\nto the severance question. It had been decided by some\nintermediate appellate court. But would it not be\nappropriate then to leave it to the Second Circuit on\nremand, if it chooses to use the Michigan certification\nprocess to say, well, we want to find out from the\nMichigan Supreme Court whether they think that the sweet\nstays, but the bitter goes?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Right. And, I mean, as you\nknow, we don't have a position on the State law\nseverability question, because our concern here is\nprotecting FDA's prerogative to administer its own\nprocess, not with whether the plaintiff or defendant\nultimately wins.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It was decided by the Sixth\nCircuit, wasn't it?\nMR. JOSEFFER: It was. And one of the\nthings that that brings up, in the Sixth Circuit it was\nactually the plaintiff who was advocating Federal\npre-emption there, because she thought that she would\nthen win on severability analysis and would thereby\nknock out the entire State statute. What that\nunderscores is that the unusual Federal pre-emption\nquestion here is not necessarily one that is even bad\nfor plaintiffs. It just protects the important Federal\nprerogative of FDA's ability to administer its own drug\napproval process.\nBut -- but to answer your question, I mean,\nwe don't have a question -- a position on that analysis,\nbut I mean, among the procedural options that are\navailable, as you said, I mean, you're right. Michigan\ndoes have a State certification process that, if people\nthought appropriate, could be used.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: This -- this tracks\nsomewhat Justice Stevens' question. Do we know in this\ncase, would this have taken two or three days of\ntestimony? Was there discovery? Was it a thousand\ndocuments? Or three documents?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Right. I mean, this case was\nresolved promptly on a motion to dismiss. But if you\nwere going to seriously litigate the question, you would\nhave to know -- in order to put this in context, to\ndetermine things like withholding and materiality --\nyou'd have to know everything that FDA had before it,\nwhat FDA thought was required as part of that process.\nYou would then have to, I suppose, depose FDA witnesses\nas to what they would have found to be misleading and\nwhat decisions they might have made in hypothetical\ncircumstances.\nAnd those are incredibly intrusive inquiries\nthat, one, distort manufacturers' incentives in dealing\nwith FDA in the first place; two, if this was seriously\ngoing to be litigated would require, I assume, quite a\nlot of discovery from FDA, which we would resist, but\nthat's not to say that we would necessarily succeed in\nour objections.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask would you -- is\nthe bribery exception also pre-empted, do you think?\nMR. JOSEFFER: That's a -- there's a very\ndifferent analysis there.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I understand. Do you\nthink --\nMR. JOSEFFER: But we do think that that\nwould be pre-empted because -- for a slightly different\nreason, which is that the relationship between -- the\nbribery of a Federal official in connection with his\nFederal duties is obviously a matter of paramount\nFederal concern, and when the -- especially when the\nState is looking at that for purposes of essentially\nsecond-guessing the validity of a regulatory\ndetermination that FDA had made --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Supposing the -- supposing\nthe official pleaded guilty to bribery. Would it be\npre-empted then?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Obviously, it still gets much\ncloser, and at that point, I'm not sure that it would\nbe.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me we've got a\nlot of theoretical litigation out here without much\nactual experience with any of these cases.\nMR. JOSEFFER: You know, what I was going to\nsay is there are a lot of interesting issues surrounding\nthis case, but none of them actually seem to be\npresented in this case, because here -- I mean, the\nstatute clearly requires a determination of fraud on the\nFDA, including all the elements I mentioned, as a\nnecessary predicate for recovery; and, two, FDA has not\nmade such a determination.\nThank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you very much.\nMs. Zieve.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLISON M. ZIEVE\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMS. ZIEVE: Justice Stevens, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWarner-Lambert marketed a defective product.\nIt withheld information about the injury the product\ncould cause, and the product caused injury to a great\nmany patients, including Respondents. They sued\nWarner-Lambert alleging traditional State law claims,\nsuch as product defect and failure to warn. I'd like\nto begin by explaining why the misrepresentation\nexception to the Michigan defense does not implicate the\nconcerns that were raised by the Court in Buckman.\nSpecifically, the Court in Buckman identified three\nproblems or concerns that it thought warranted\npre-emption in that case: That the claim alleged would\ncause companies to submit too much information and slow\ndown the 510(k) process; that the claim alleged might\ncause companies not to submit products for approval\nbecause of concern about off-label use; and that the\nclaim would cause an unwarranted intrusion on the FDA's\ndecisionmaking about how to police and enforce fraud\nagainst it.\nSo the question is: Does the Michigan law\nimplicate these three concerns any more than traditional\nState tort litigation against a drug company?\nI'll start with what I think are the easy\nones. For three reasons, the Michigan statute creates\nno incentive for manufacturers to submit unnecessary\ninformation to the FDA. Unlike the streamlined 510(k)\nclearance process that was at issue in Buckman, in this\ncase we have a drug approval. Drugs are required to go\nthrough a comprehensive pre-market approval process.\nThe regulations require submission of, \"all available\ninformation about the safety of a drug, including\ndemonstrated or potential adverse effects.\" I was\nquoting from 314.50(b)(5). As Warner-Lambert points out\nin its brief, a typical new drug application can be\nthousands of pages long. So there's not really -- not\nonly is there not evidence that this 12-year-old statute\nwill lead companies to submit information that the FDA\ndoesn't want and doesn't need; but it's really unclear\nwhat such evidence would be because, after all,\ncompanies are required to submit all safety information\nto the FDA, and it's safety information that would be\nrelevant to a finding under the Michigan exception.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The converse of that is\nthat the discovery is exhaustive and quite burdensome.\nI mean, you're trying to say, well, don't worry; there's\nthousands of documents here; they won't be submitting\nanything else. But, on the other hand, that cuts\nagainst you when we're talking about the intrusiveness\non the Federal scheme because you have to have Federal\nregulators go back through all of this stuff again.\nMS. ZIEVE: No, Your Honor. The discovery\nin a case like this -- there is no evidence to suggest\nit would be any broader or more burdensome than\ndiscovery in a typical product liability case against a\ndrug company.\nIn that regard, Mr. Joseffer is wrong that\nthere was no discovery in this case. These cases are\npart of a multidistrict litigation and there was a\nsignificant amount of discovery.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All that makes -- makes it\nworse, in a sense, because what you're saying to me\nanyway -- and you can explain why I'm not right -- that\nall of the three things that you mentioned are only\naspects of something much more fundamental that\nunderlies all these cases -- Medtronics, drugs, all of\nthem. You came up and began and said this drug has side\neffects that hurt people. And that's a risk when you\nhave a drug, and it's a terrible thing if the drug hurts\npeople.\nThere's a risk on the other side. There are\npeople who are dying or seriously sick, and if you don't\nget the drug to them they die. So there's a problem.\nYou've got to get drugs to people and at the same time\nthe drug can't hurt them.\nNow, who would you rather have make the\ndecision as to whether this drug is, on balance, going\nto save people or, on balance, going to hurt people? An\nexpert agency, on the one hand, or 12 people pulled\nrandomly for a jury role who see before them only the\npeople whom the drug hurt and don't see those who need\nthe drug to cure them?\nNow, that it seems to me is Congress's\nfundamental choice, and Congress has opted for the\nagency. And that's why we're here --\nMS. ZIEVE: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- because you want the\njury to do it. And it seems to me, reading Buckman,\nthat Buckman says the agency should do it. So that's\nwhat underlies all my reactions to this, and I might as\nwell get it right out so that you can answer.\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, I think I have a -- State\nlaw torts suits aren't seeking to make a determination\nabout whether the product should have gone on the\nmarket. The purpose of the State law tort suit is to\ncompensate injured patients. That's a fundamentally\ndifferent role. It's complementary to the FDA's role,\nbut it's different. And I think your question, though,\nreally goes more to the broader issues that the Court\nwill consider next term.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Ms. Zieve, it doesn't\nobject to a system where the -- a court -- the State\nwould come in and give you your tort suit if it's really\ntrue that the agency would withdraw this drug. But what\nyou want is to be able to convince the jury that there\nwas fraud in a situation where the agency doesn't say\nthere was fraud. So what you're doing is removing a\ndrug from the market that they want out there.\nNow, that's the theory of Buckman. The\ntheory of Buckman is --\nMS. ZIEVE: But that is not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- they want to save people\nwhom you say they shouldn't because the drug shouldn't\nbe there. I overstate it slightly. So, explain to me\nwhy.\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, this case doesn't seek to\npull Rezulin from the market. Well, first of all,\nRezulin was pulled from the market seven years ago. But\nthat is not the goal of this case. The goal of this\ncase is to pay -- to get compensation for people who\nsuffered serious liver damage, every single one of them.\nAbout a third of the patient-respondents died from the\nliver damage caused by Rezulin, and what they're seeking\nhere is not a regulatory remedy; they're seeking damages\nand compensation for that.\nAnd the -- the place where we started with\nthe --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Your premise still is, is\nthat the drug should not have been marketed, or is that\nyour premise?\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, under Michigan law, the\nplaintiffs can only --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I know your purpose is\ndifferent, but the premise on which you operate is that\nthe drug should not have been sold.\nMS. ZIEVE: The -- if I can just back up to\n-- to the structure of the Michigan statute --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You can back up as long as\nyou want as long as you come forward and answer.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. ZIEVE: I promise will.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. ZIEVE: The Michigan statute takes as\nits starting point the notion that Federal approval is\nreliable evidence that a drug company has satisfied the\nduty -- State law duties of care owed to patients, and\nthen it says: But there are a couple of situations\nwhere that reliability is drawn into question.\nSo, if the company bribes the FDA or the if\nthe company misrepresented important information to the\nFDA, then the approval is no longer a sufficient basis\non which we can just say that approval in and of itself\nmeans that the manufacturer satisfied State law duties.\nAnd so, the -- the purpose of the finding\nabout whether there was misrepresentation and what the\nresults of it might have been is not to police\nenforcement with FDA requirements, and it is not to\nforce the drug off the market. It is only a hurdle that\nthe plaintiff has to get past so it can litigate -- he\nor she can litigate her State law claim the same way\nplaintiffs will be litigating those claims, and did\nlitigate those claims, with respect to Rezulin in States\nacross the country.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Aren't you going to tell\nthis jury that the drug should not have been on the\nmarket?\nMS. ZIEVE: Yes. In Michigan they will have\nto present evidence that if the company had been honest\nwith the FDA, the product wouldn't have been approved.\nThe discovery in this case shows that it doesn't -- at\nleast in this case, that wouldn't present a big problem.\nFirst of all, there is evidence in this\ncase, testimony from the medical officer who reviewed\nthe information, that Rezulin would not have been\napproved as a standalone therapy, that it is infused\nwithout insulin or another drug, if the company hadn't\nlied about -- withheld adverse event reports.\nBut certainly in the typical case a lot of\nthe information that comes out with respect to what went\non before the FDA, not only is it submitted in product\nliability cases in the first instance by the\nmanufacturer to show all of the hurdles they had to go\nthrough to get on the market, doesn't that show our\nproduct was safe, but a lot of it you can get in\ndiscovery from the company, themselves, as happened in\nthis case. A lot of --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought under the\nMichigan scheme you don't have to show that. You just\nshow approval, and that's the end of the case in\nMichigan.\nMS. ZIEVE: There are no Michigan cases\nexplaining just what you need to show to satisfy the\ndefense, so it is unclear whether you have to show that\nyou met -- if it is the right chemical formula, with the\nlabel originally approved, or does compliance with\napproval mean that you also had to show -- one of the\nterms of approval is that you continued to update your\nlabel when you become aware of new safety information;\nwould you have to show -- a manufacturer have to show\nthat to show that the defense was satisfied.\nThere's no cases under Michigan law which\ntell us --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me that you\ncould prove that the -- an exception to the defense\napplies and still lose your lawsuit?\nMS. ZIEVE: Absolutely, we could. Showing\nthat the exception applies is just the first step to\nbeing able to litigate this case the way plaintiffs\nlitigated these cases in California, and Illinois, and\nNew York, and other States.\nThere was Rezulin litigation throughout the\ncountry. And, again, the point about discovery is that\nthe broad discovery that was done, a lot from\nWarner-Lambert, some from the FDA, that was no different\ndiscovery really than would be required under Michigan.\nIt's all there.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Would you explain why you\nthink Mr. Joseffer was wrong when he argued that having\na jury decide whether the FDA would have approved the\ndrug or would have withdrawn it from the market if\nadditional or different information had been supplied is\nincorrect?\nDoesn't that -- wouldn't that very seriously\ninterfere with what the FDA is doing?\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, of course, in the specific\nfacts of this case it wouldn't, because Rezulin is off\nthe market and unapproved. But even as a general matter\nit doesn't affect FDA's regulation because, as I said in\nresponse to Justice Stevens, the effect of making that\nshowing and the jury agreeing that the product wouldn't\nhave been approved is -- there's no regulatory effect.\nThe effect is that the plaintiff can then go ahead and\nlitigate her case like she could in any other State.\nAnd that's why -- that's because what\nMichigan is doing is not policing enforcement. It is\njust defining the parameters of the compliance --\nJUSTICE ALITO: There wouldn't be discovery\nof internal processes within the FDA? There wouldn't be\nexperts testifying about what the FDA would or would not\nhave done?\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, the parties may seek\ndiscovery. There hasn't been enough Michigan litigation\nfor us to know exactly how it would work; but,\ncertainly, the courts in Michigan should be trusted to\nuse their discretion to keep discovery under control as\nthey do in every case. The Rezulin litigation --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Wasn't -- in this case\none of the charges was that the original FDA examiner\nhad recommended against approval for this drug, and then\nsomething happened inside the FDA, and that examiner was\ntaken off the matter, and another one who approved it\nwas put on?\nIsn't that the kind of thing that the FDA\nwould want to police itself and not have State courts\nlook into?\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, those are some of the\nbackground facts that happened here. But I don't think\nthose are the facts that go to a showing of what the FDA\nwould have done if Warner-Lambert had made honest\ndisclosures, because actually those facts tend to\nsuggest that the FDA did know what was going on.\nBut later the second medical officer, the\none who did recommend approval -- the approval came in\ntwo stages. One was for use as a combination therapy\nwith insulin and another drug called Metformin, and\nlater there was an approval for use of Rezulin on its\nown.\nThat is the use that happened to affect all\nof my clients, and that's the use where we already have\na medical officer who testified that the agency would\nnot have approved for that use if the company hadn't\nwithheld safety information.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what evidence would\nyou introduce to prove the -- to prove the exception if\nthe Second Circuit's decision stands?\nMS. ZIEVE: Deposition testimony from that\nmedical officer, for example. There are e-mails. We\ncited a couple of e-mails in the red brief of things\nthat were stated at the time: One an e-mail to\nWarner-Lambert and one from a medical officer to his\nsuperior talking about the way in which Warner-Lambert\nmade it harder -- to be kind to -- for them to assess\nwhat the true safety profile of the drug was.\nThere is -- as I said, there was a very\nlarge amount of Rezulin discovery done in the MDL, most\nof which is under a protective order. So I don't know\neverything that's in there, but --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The question is: Would\nwe be disrupting the FDA by taking depositions of\nexaminers to find out what went on at the FDA?\nMS. ZIEVE: No more so than product\nliability litigation in any other State. As I said, the\ndeposition that happened in this case, the plaintiff's\ncommittee asked -- they negotiated discovery with the\nFDA in the Rezulin cases in general, not looking at\nMichigan specifically at all. They got some discovery\nfrom the FDA and the deposition of the medical officer.\nThere's also a lot of information about\napproved drugs that the FDA posts as a matter of course\non its website, including the medical officer reviews\nthat form the basis for the approval decision.\nBut even in other cases, for instance, the\nVioxx MDL that was pending in Louisiana, the -- in that\ncase the FDA wasn't as interested in negotiating, and\nthere was motions to suppress and a motion to compel.\nAnd the judge had to decide whether to allow an FDA\nmedical officer to be deposed; and in that case, did.\nThere are other cases where the FDA has not\nwanted discovery and has successfully opposed it. The\nFDA has regulations about that, and there's no evidence\nthat it's burdening the FDA to cooperate to some degree\nin discovery or the judges are allowing plaintiffs to\noverrun the FDA with requests they can't handle. But,\nmore importantly --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I assume -- I assume -- you\ndon't stop between sentences, so I hate to interrupt\nyou.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I assume that if this drug\nwere still on the market, you could bring forward the\ninformation that you have alluded to about the\nwithholding of necessary data by Warner-Lambert, and the\nFDA would certainly be able to consider that and decide\nwhether sanctions were necessary, withdrawing of the\ndrug was necessary.\nIn this case, the drug has already been\nwithdrawn. So I assume the FDA has at least a reduced\nincentive to go into these questions. I guess they\nstill would want to go into them if Warner-Lambert were\nreally a bad actor. They could impose some sanctions,\ncouldn't they, even though the drug was already\nwithdrawn?\nMS. ZIEVE: I don't know if they still\ncould, but presumably sometime in the past they could\nhave.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think we could have\ntwo different rules: One for drugs that are still out\nthere and one for drugs that have since been withdrawn?\nBecause I frankly see little incentive for the FDA, you\nknow, to go back over past mistakes. The drug now\nhaving been withdrawn, it doesn't matter.\nBut if the drug was still out there, it\nseems to me you could come forward, and I would be much\nless sympathetic to what you're trying to do. You could\ntrust the FDA to do the job.\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, the job the FDA is going\nto do, even if it agrees with a plaintiff, is to\nsanction the company, perhaps, or to ask it for\ndifferent information. It does have the ability to\nwithdraw approval --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, but once it sanctions\nthe Plaintiff, the Government can't make the argument\nyou are interfering; you are second-guessing the FDA.\nThe FDA would have said: You didn't give us\ninformation that was necessary; and had we known this,\nwe wouldn't have gone ahead.\nMS. ZIEVE: There's no way for a plaintiff\nto compel the FDA to look into a situation of a\nmanufacturer being dishonest for the -- or to -- even if\nthe FDA starts a process for a plaintiff to compel the\nagency to make a finding that the company\nwithheld material information, and we would not have\napproved it otherwise.\nAnd even if the agency chose to do that, it\nwouldn't be of any help to the plaintiff because the\nplaintiff's family is seeking compensation because the\nbreadwinner is dead, or the person is impeded in their\nability to make a living in the future and has huge\nmedical bills now.\nAnd the FDA's finding that, yes, the company\nreally acted badly isn't going to do anything to help\nthat -- that family.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but it will lead to\nthe drug being withdrawn, in which case there may be\njust as many people on the other side who are dying,\ndead, no breadwinner, et cetera, because they didn't get\na necessary drug. And that's why what worries me is\nwhat happens if the jury is wrong?\nYou are absolutely right when you say you\ncannot make the FDA go into this matter and withdraw a\ndrug; and they are absolutely right when they say we\ncannot promise you that juries will be right.\nMS. ZIEVE: But, again --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So the the question is:\nWho is more likely to be right?\nMS. ZIEVE: With respect, I don't think\nthat's the question, because if the jury -- if a\nMichigan jury is wrong about what would have happened if\nWarner-Lambert hadn't acted so badly, the result is that\nMs. Kent and the other Plaintiffs get to litigate their\nclaims. The result is not -- there is no regulatory --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then you think they should\nbe able to litigate a claim where the FDA has approved a\ndrug.\nNow, is that the law in most places? Where\nthe FDA has approved a drug for use and the doctor\nfollows the label and the label is all okay, is it the\ncase that somebody can come in and say, despite that,\nthis drug is on balance harmful, and I get compensation?\nThis is a serious question. I'm not sure\nhow it works.\nMS. ZIEVE: That is the law in every State.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's been contested,\nand we are going to hear that case next term.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's the next issue.\nMS. ZIEVE: That's right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Right. But it's been --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I see.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- at least since the\n1930's, State tort litigation of the very kind that\nJustice Breyer has described has gone on. Isn't that\nso? That you -- even though the FDA has approved a\ndrug, an injured party can say this was a defective\ndrug, and the manufacturer says regulatory compliance.\nThat's a defense. And you would say it's a defense, but\nnot a conclusive defense.\nMS. ZIEVE: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's how -- that's how\n--\nMS. ZIEVE: Yes. The FDA approval, Federal\napproval, and State tort actions have co-existed since\n1938.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why? That's where I am\nmissing you. Why, then, does Michigan even have this\nthing? In other words, why -- you are saying if they\ndidn't have it at all, you would go ahead and bring your\ntort action.\nMS. ZIEVE: That's right. Michigan chose --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Thank you.\nMS. ZIEVE: -- to -- not to create a new\nclaim as the plaintiffs tried to do in Buckman, but,\nrather, to take a traditional claim and restrict\nplaintiff's ability to prevail on it.\nThis is not an expansion of State tort law.\nIt is a considerable narrowing of State tort law.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, would you say that\nmy characterization of it when Mr. Phillips was\npresenting his case, that this is an invigorated\nregulatory compliance defense, that it is more\nfavorable, far more favorable, to the manufacturer than\nthe standard regulatory compliance because it says that\nthe manufacturer is immune, totally immune, unless --\nand then the exception that we are debating here.\nBut it is a deliberately pro-manufacturer\nmeasure. It gives the manufacturer an immunity that the\nregulatory compliance defense does not.\nMS. ZIEVE: And I would go even further.\nIt's not just pro-manufacturer. This statute is the\nmost deferential to the FDA of any State tort law in the\ncountry. Other States will allow a manufacturer to\npresent evidence of compliance to show the product\nwasn't defective, and that's non-dispositive evidence in\nalmost every State.\nAnd then a plaintiff can come back and say:\nOh, but look, they didn't comply in these ways. And\nthat wouldn't be dispositive either in most States.\nBut only in Michigan not only is the\nmanufacturer's compliance defense dispositive in the\nmajority of cases, but the evidence of non-compliance\nisn't even allowed as a rebuttal unless the plaintiff\ncan show that it actually was a material non-compliance\nthat would have made a difference.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And in your view could a\nState prohibit introduction of evidence by the defendant\nthat the drug was approved by the FDA?\nMS. ZIEVE: Only to the extent that they\nsimply thought it wasn't relevant. And there are\nStates that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And all they say in the\nstatute: We just think -- they just think this is\nirrelevant.\nMS. ZIEVE: Sure. And there are States that\ndon't allow compliance --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I don't think that's\nconsistent with your position. There's no doubt about\nthat.\nMS. ZIEVE: There are States that don't\nallow compliance evidence if the plaintiff shows\nmaterial misrepresentation, \"material\" being that it\ncould have -- could have influenced the agency without a\nfinding that it did or would have influenced the agency,\nbut just that it was pertinent information.\nAnd in those cases, this is discussed in\ncommon -- either the restatement. In such a case some\nStates would say that the compliance evidence then can't\ncome in. And it is sort of the same theory as\nMichigan's, but just not as strict against the\nplaintiffs, that if you can't trust the -- the\ncompliance evidence isn't relevant. It's not meaningful\nif you can't trust it. Because the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So to me, which is a good\nanswer, is you are saying: Look at the basic tort\nsystem here. And if you can do that, you can do this.\nIs that -- do you see where I'm --\nMS. ZIEVE: If -- if the traditional tort\nsystem as it exists in most every State is not\npre-empted, then Michigan's statute is not pre-empted.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Zieve, how many\nStates have a statute like Michigan's?\nMS. ZIEVE: The Michigan statute is unique\nwith respect to the finding -- the requirement that\nthere be a finding of how the FDA would have acted if\nthe manufacturer had not made certain representations.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No other State does that?\nMS. ZIEVE: Texas has a similar statute\nexcept it doesn't have that last element. And one of\nthe questions on severability is whether -- if you think\njust that element is pre-empted, whether you can --\nwhether Michigan would want to sever that one element.\nAnd then there are a number of States that\nlimit punitive damages liability but along the lines of\nTexas, not Michigan. So, again, that last element is\nnot required.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But was there any\nexperience with this in Michigan? How many years was it\nin operation before the Sixth Circuit decision?\nMS. ZIEVE: I believe it went into effect in\nMarch of '96. So, seven years.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Have there been many\ntrials to test this theory that it would be disruptive,\nthat --\nMS. ZIEVE: We were unable to find any\nreported cases or Westlaw discussion of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's the Sixth Circuit\ncase? It must have involved this, no?\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, in the Sixth Circuit the\nplaintiff said: We can't prove the exception, but it is\npre-empted and not severable. So we -- so that the the\nstatute would fall.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I see. What is your\nposition on severability? Why shouldn't we -- you know,\nwe usually accept the circuit court's determination as\nto what the State law is. Michigan is in the Sixth\nCircuit. And I think it's overwhelmingly likely that\nthe Second Circuit would defer to the Sixth Circuit's\nview. Don't you think?\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, in footnote 4 of the\nSecond Circuit's decision, Justice Calabrezze points out\nthat certification to the Michigan Supreme Court would\nalso be an option, and an option that the court doesn't\n-- that court didn't even get to.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The discussion in the\nSixth Circuit was not very extensive on this point, on\nthis --\nMS. ZIEVE: No, it wasn't. And this Court\nhas no -- has no practice with respect to deferring to\nState law questions that were decided by courts of\nappeals in a different case. That is, this case didn't\ncome to the Court from the Sixth Circuit.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I want to be sure I\nunderstand something. In the other case, the plaintiff\nis the one who argued there was pre-emption, and the\nwhole statute was invalid, and not the defendant.\nMS. ZIEVE: That's right.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I see. I missed that.\nMS. ZIEVE: Yes. It was a good try. But I\nthink that the severability argument is very closely\ntied to the reason --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So the defendants kind of\ntake the risk when they make the argument they are\nmaking. They have a chance to either lose or win.\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, that's right. I mean, I\nthink the fact that Michigan is such a pro-manufacturer\nState --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If there is no\nseverability, the defense is gone, period.\nMS. ZIEVE: That's right.\nThe -- and the reason for severability,\nthough, was quite tied to the whole reason why we think\nthere's not preemption in the first place, which is that\nthe statute really needs to be looked at as a whole.\nYou can't -- you can't understand what the exception is\ntrying to accomplish without putting it in the context\nof the statute. After all, it is -- it's subparagraph\n(8) of subsection (5) of the Michigan statute.\nIf the Court has no further questions,\nthank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you.\nMr. Phillips, you have five minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Justice Stevens.\nHopefully, I'll give you back some of that time, so you\ncan get to lunch.\nJustice Kennedy, I think the best case for\nus without Buckman would have been Hoyle versus United\nTechnologies. That's a case involving again a uniquely\nfederal interest. And the advantage of that particular\ncase is it also reflects that pre-emption is not an all\nor nothing proposition. You can preempt out the\nspecific parts that is offensive and retain the part of\nState law that is not offensive. And that's precisely\nwhat we're trying to do in this case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: There was special\nconsideration because of military considerations.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think that's what\nmade it a uniquely Federal interest. But I don't know\nthat it's any more a uniquely Federal interest than this\none. At least this is the way the Court has analyzed\nboth of them in Buckman.\nJustice Ginsburg, with respect to\nseverability, I think, frankly, the Second Circuit\nalready answered the question. They said that we would\ndefer to the Sixth Circuit under Factors and then\nanalyze certification. And it concluded that, given the\nclarity of the Sixth Circuit's decision in Garcia, that\nthere's nothing left to be decided on that issue.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I didn't think that the\nSecond Circuit discussed severability, but I can go back\nand check.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, if you -- if you --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that it had\nbeen raised there, but they didn't get to it because\nthey --\nMR. PHILLIPS: I would suggest you read the\nPetition Appendix 14a, where it says on the one hand,\nunder Factors we are bound to follow Garcia's\nconclusions as to questions of Michigan State law, and\nthen the footnote reflects that the Sixth Circuit in\nGarcia had clearly decided the severability issue here.\nSo, frankly, if --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In a very, very quick --\nit isn't a very thoroughly reasoned discussion. It's a\nis very -- it's just one paragraph.\nMR. PHILLIPS: To be sure. But on the other\nhand, it does seem to me that it spoke specifically to\nthe issue and recognized the right outcome.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I mean, because it is\nodd -- I mean, it is odd that you'd have a statute that\nsays: Manufacturer, we're going to give you immunity,\nbut there's an exception. They seem so tied together\nand it really would be a case of letting one side keep\nthe sweet and get rid of the bitter. And it seems to me\nthat there is -- that there was no discussion of that in\nthe Sixth Circuit.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Oh, but there is a discussion\nof that in the Sixth Circuit decision. Garcia\nspecifically deals with that, because it says the bitter\nthat you have to take is if the FDA in fact makes all of\nthe very specific and intricate findings that are\nrequired by the exception and concludes that the product\nshould be withdrawn for fraud, then in fact you get the\nbitter, which is that the lawsuit goes forward under\nthose circumstances, and that that's the reasonable\ncompromise that the State legislature had in mind or\nwould have been satisfied with.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the question is\nwhether the legislature would have passed the statute\nthat it did if in a case like this one the manufacturer\ncould have the immunity without the exception.\nMR. PHILLIPS: All I'm saying is I think the\nCourt addressed that in Garcia and specifically\nconcluded that the legislature in fact would have passed\nthat; And that traditionally, the Second Circuit would\ndefer, as would this Court.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It would be -- it would\nbe open to the Second Circuit on remand because it's not\nforeclosed.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, clearly it's not\nforeclosed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, unless they choose\nnot to change their mind. I mean, they did say that\nthey're bound by this by Garcia as to questions of State\nlaw.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Exactly.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They said that: We are\nbound by Garcia as to questions of State law.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Exactly.\nJustice Scalia, I'd like to answer your\nquestion about if we were going forward with respect to\nwithdrawal as opposed to looking back. I mean, the FDA\nstill has the authority to order disgorgement, to order\nrestitution for victims. I think the notion that the\nFDA is indifferent to claims of fraud is just -- is\nflatly offensive. The reality is --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Does restitution for\nvictims include damages?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, whatever injuries --\nyeah, I mean, I don't know exactly what the sweep of\nrestitution would be, but disgorgement of profits would\ncertainly provide a mechanism for providing --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, you're not talking\nabout profits when you have an injured -- a patient who\ndied as a result of malpractice or something. That's\nnot disgorgement of profits. That's damages.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I understand that. All I'm\nsuggesting, Justice Stevens, is that there are remedial\nmechanisms still available to the FDA if in fact it\nconcluded that there was some problem, and that those --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It couldn't give recovery\nto a class action of a couple of hundred plaintiffs who\nwere injured, could it? No such remedy under the FDA,\nor am I wrong on that?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, as I understood the\nFDA's position is that they have pretty broad remedial\nauthority and that it extends to some form of\nrestitution to the victims. So I --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The government told us in\nits brief that the FDA has no system for addressing\npublic complaints -- this was in their brief at page\n24 -- because that would divert attention from their\nprimary mission. So there's no action for fraud that\none can bring to the FDA.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, there is a\nprovision for citizen petitions that exists, that's\ncited. So, yes, there is a mechanism.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But The FDA doesn't have\nto do anything about it?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, no. It entertains it.\nIn point of fact, there was a petition filed by Public\nCitizen to withdraw Rezulin in this specific case, and\nit was reviewed and it was rejected for exactly the\nreason Justice Breyer identified, because if you took it\noff the market, people would die. That was the concern\nthat drove the FDA to say: We're not going to do that\nunder these circumstances.\nIf there are no further questions, Your\nHonors.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The case is taken under\nadvisement.\n(Whereupon, at 12:05 p.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n24:24 admissible 17:8 34:11,17 35:12 51:1 52:2\n42:10 20:23 amount 22:6 36:11,23 37:18
