        "content": "(11:05 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Case 06-666, Department of Revenue of Kentucky\nv. Davis.\nMr. Trower.\nORAL ARGUMENT of C. CHRISTOPHER TROWER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. TROWER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nKentucky's tax exemption for municipal bond\ninterest paid by Kentucky and its political subdivisions\nto Kentucky taxpayers treats all private entities the\nsame, and favors only Kentucky and its political\nsubdivisions. This Court has never held that a law\nwhich favors government, whether the State or local\ngovernment, rather than private business enterprises\nviolates the dormant Commerce Clause.\nThe Court's decision last term in United Haulers holds\nthat State laws which favor government but which treat\nall private business entities in State and out of State\nthe same does not discriminate against interstate\ncommerce.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is what you just said true\nabout conduit bonds, where Kentucky issues bonds to\nfinance private construction? Is the statement that you\njust made accurate?\nMR. TROWER: Yes, it is, Your Honor.\nPrivate activity bonds, a subset of which are conduit\nbonds, account for approximately 20 percent of all\nmunicipal bonds issued. And I think your question has,\nhas two point to it.\nFirst of all is whether or not a State or a\nmunicipality ought to be able to use its tax exempt\nborrowing power to further a project chosen by the\nmunicipality to achieve public purposes, such as for\nexample tax exempt hospitals or other facilities that\nare tax exempt, should it be able to use that tax exempt\nborrowing power constitutionally? The answer there is,\nyes. Congress has already made that decision.\nThe second question is whether there's a\nCommerce Clause problem if a State exempts it's own\nprivate activity bonds but taxes private activity bonds\nissued in other States?\nJUSTICE ALITO: That's what you do, isn't\nit?\nMR. TROWER: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Doesn't that raise, in\neffect, sort of a distinction between Carbone and United\nHaulers? Or at least one way of understanding the\ndistinction between those two cases? In Carbone the\nfacility, in fact, was not the facility of the\ngovernment.\nMR. TROWER: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Here the, the immediate\nbeneficiary of the bonds is, in Justice Alito's hypo, is\na private entity?\nMR. TROWER: That's correct, that the\nimmediate beneficiary of the bonds or of the loan is a,\nis a nongovernmental entity. It's not necessarily a\nprivate business.\nAs we point out in our reply brief, 80\npercent of all private activity bonds go for --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But -- correct me if I'm\nwrong, just a matter of fact. I thought in most\ninstances the immediate beneficiary would be a private\nentity who, in effect, was enabled to borrow at a lower\nrate?\nMR. TROWER: That is correct. It would be a\nnongovernmental entity that would be able to borrow at a\ntax exempt rate.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So don't you have to\ntake -- therefore, if you're going to answer Justice\nAlito as you did, don't you have to take the position\nthat Carbone really is not good law and the\nCarbone/United Haulers distinction is not a -- is simply\nnot a relevant distinction?\nAs a dissenter in Carbone, I naturally do\nnot find that the worst answer you could give.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But don't you have to give\nthat answer?\nMR. TROWER: I thought the distinction that\nyou drew in your dissenting opinion in Carbone between\nthe one entity that has got to get the job done within\nthe jurisdiction is the key distinction in observing\nUnited Haulers.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, as a dissenter in\nUnited Haulers, I also don't think it's a good\ndistinction.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE ALITO: But couldn't there be\ninstances where some, an industrial, a company is trying\nto -- is deciding to locate a plant and is choosing\nbetween Kentucky and Ohio, and Kentucky says, come to\nKentucky because we'll issue private activity bonds so\nthat you can finance this more cheaply than if you went\ninto Ohio? And when you do that, aren't you, aren't you\ndoing exactly what the dormant Commerce Clause is\nsupposed to prevent?\nMR. TROWER: No. You're doing -- the\ndormant Commerce Clause in no way restricts the ability\nof States to provide economic incentives for in-State\nbusiness activity.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Trower, were private\nactivity bonds considered at all below? As far as I\nunderstand, this is not a private activity bond, it's\nnot, what's at issue here. And there was no\nadjudication with respect to that type of bond --\nMR. TROWER: That's exactly --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- in the lower courts.\nMR. TROWER: That is exactly right, ma'am.\nAnd our position is that Respondents have no standing to\nmake a claim focused solely on private activity bonds,\nbecause there is no evidence in the record as to whether\nRespondents own any private activity bonds.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose that you -- and I\nhave the same hypothetical for both you and your\nbrothers on the other side with some adjustment here,\nbecause I'm finding the case quite difficult. And the,\nthe -- for you, imagine we have some milk producers in\nKentucky. They are farmers. And they go to the\nlegislature and they say, you know, we can sell a lot\nmore milk in Kentucky if you will pass a law imposing a\ntax on Missouri farmers who want to ship milk into\nKentucky. That's the classic unlawful -- all right.\nIt's unlawful, unconstitutional, right.\nMR. TROWER: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, what is\nthe difference if a city in Kentucky that wants to\nfinance its schools says now to the legislature, we're\ngoing to find it easier to sell bonds in Kentucky or\nelsewhere, in Kentucky, for our school system if you'll\nonly put a tax on similar bonds that Missouri is\noffering to finance their city schools? That will help,\njust like the milk. Now, what's the difference?\nMR. TROWER: The difference is, is twofold.\nOne, the favoritism in the first example, the dairy\ncases, which have come up a million times, is a\nfavoritism of a private industry, whereas in your second\nhypothetical the favoritism is to the most public of\nindustries, education.\nThe second difference is that a tax on\nout-of-State dairy products increases the cost of\nout-of-State dairy products to in-State consumers with\nno detriment to in-State dairy producers, whereas, as\nour Respondents have pointed out in their brief, when a\ntax is imposed by a government on a transaction where\nthe government itself is paying the money, which is what\nwe have here, a tax on interest income paid by the\ngovernment, the effect is to impose a dollar-for-dollar\nreduction in the government's tax revenues equal to the\namount of the exemption. So you've got an in-State\nentity, namely, the government itself, that is suffering\na revenue loss.\nThat's not at all comparable to the dairy\nhypothetical.\nJUSTICE BREYER: We have consumers in the\ndairy products that are suffering loss. They're all the\nvoters in the States. Everyone drinks milk.\nMR. TROWER: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So they are suffering a\ndollar-for-dollar loss, because their milk becomes more\nexpensive.\nI don't know if that's analogous. I think\nit's a pretty strong analogy. As to the first, that's\nof course the point that's worrying me. It is true that\nthis is a public matter.\nMR. TROWER: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Would it make a difference\nin the first case if it happened to be some dairy\nfarmers who -- there are so few in Massachusetts now,\nunfortunately, that they all work on State-owned dairy\nfarms that are put up for, you know -- does it make a\ndifference?\nMR. TROWER: I think it would make a\ndifference.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It would make a difference?\nMR. TROWER: If a hamburger stand is owned\nby the State, it's okay under United Haulers. If the\nState wants to go into the dairy business, the Commerce\nClause doesn't prevent the state from doing that.\nThat's our answer, is that the Commerce Clause does not\nextend to activities by a State on behalf of all of its\npeople.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We have a different\nvariation here that wasn't present in United Haulers,\nwhich, of course, is that Kentucky does compete with\nother public entities in the municipal bond market. In\nother words, I think you have a strong case with respect\nto discrimination against private bonds, but Kentucky\ncompetes against Ohio bonds as well. And they're making\nthe Kentucky bonds more attractive through this\ndiscriminatory tax on the Ohio bonds.\nWhy isn't that a sufficient distinction from\nUnited Haulers?\nMR. TROWER: The key distinction in the\nUnited Haulers, Mr. Chief Justice, was between an entity\nwith the responsibility for the welfare of the citizens\nwithin the jurisdiction versus all other entities. It\njust happened to be in United Haulers that that was a\npublic entity versus private entities. But United\nHaulers, we submit, would have reached exactly the same\nresult if the trash haulers had wanted to take the\ngarbage to a municipal or a public facility in New\nJersey, as opposed to a private facility in New Jersey.\nAnd the second answer to your question is\nthat other public entities, other States, other\nmunicipalities have no responsibilities in Kentucky for\nthe public welfare. They're no different than private\nborrowers in Kentucky. They don't have sovereign\nimmunity in Kentucky if they default on their bonds.\nThey can be sued in Kentucky court. That's the\nessential difference.\nThe question I think that the Justice Breyer\nbrought up would also lead me to talk about what are the\npurposes of the Commerce Clause writ large, or the\ndormant Commerce Clause not writ large, that have\nmotivated this Court's jurisprudence? I think there are\nthree: Economic protectionism, which the Court has\nrepeatedly said does not apply to activity by the State\non its open behalf; secondly, the free market or free\ntrade rationale, which has motivated many of the Court's\ndecisions, but at the same time the Court has always\nbeen careful to say that the free trade rationale, Maine\nv. Taylor for example, does not value free trade above\nall other values that we have. And we would submit that\nthe value here is the fundamental sovereignty of the\nStates.\nOur political system subdivides\nresponsibility for government and responsibility for\npublic works in America. Bonds are not issued by the\nStates to make a profit or to leverage their return on\nequity. Bonds aren't issued to create an investment\nopportunity for Wall Street or for Main Street. Bonds\nare issued to finance the essential work of government.\nAnd this Court's decision should look at that part of\nthe equation as much more significant and weigh those\nvalues much more heavily than the values of the free\nmarket, which don't really apply to the State's\nprovision of goods and services. In all the dairy cases\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose a State said that\nit was unlawful for anyone other than a State resident\nto purchase the bond?\nMR. TROWER: That would be completely\nconstitutional.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What if -- what if the\nState offered its taxpayers a higher interest rate than\npurchasers from other States? Would that be\npermissible?\nMR. TROWER: Yes, sir, that would be totally\npermissible and would achieve the same result as the\nexemption that we've got here. So what you've got\nbefore you is --\nJUSTICE ALITO: How would that achieve the\nsame result if these bonds weren't negotiable and they'd\nbe hard to sell, hard for you to sell, if people who\nbought them couldn't sell them, and they could sell them\nto somebody out of State and get the higher interest\nrate?\nMR. TROWER: I thought the question was if\nthe bonds increased the interest rate and limited the\npurchasers to Kentucky citizens.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And these would be bonds\nthat Kentucky citizens could not sell to anyone else?\nMR. TROWER: They could sell them to anyone\nelse.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Anyone who wasn't a Kentucky\ncitizen?\nMR. TROWER: It would be -- let me back up.\nI think I got ahead of myself there.\nIt would be entirely constitutional for a\nState to offer bonds for sale and limit the sale to\nKentucky residents and limit the payment of interest to\nKentucky residents and have a mechanism to assure that\nthat would be the case. For example, contract\nsubmissions by brokers. The SEC does that right now\nthousands of times each day with Rule 144 sales. The\nadministrative mechanism would be there. Would it be\nconstitutional? Yes, sir. Our point is we've got a\ngiant market upon which the States depend for the\nfinancing of public goods and services.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would it be constitutional\nto say that the holder of the bond must always be a\nKentucky resident or, if you sold the bond, it has to be\nto another Kentucky resident?\nMR. TROWER: Yes, it would be. We've got\nthe same analogy in the securities law, where the\nintrastate exemption is conditioned upon the holder of\nthe security being an in-State resident who must agree\nnot to transfer the security out of State.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I suppose you\ncould achieve the same result simply by providing you're\nnot going to pay interest to somebody who is not a\nKentucky resident.\nMR. TROWER: Yes, sir, you could.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So if New York has a very\nstrong financial community, it can really benefit its\ncitizens by keeping the market in New York bonds for\nitself, if it chooses?\nMR. TROWER: Yes, it could.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And your case for that is\nwhat, United Haulers?\nMR. TROWER: Yes, sir, as well as an\nattention -- as I was going to earlier, the larger\nprinciples that are behind the dormant Commerce Clause\njurisprudence of the Court. The Court has -- we talked\nabout economic protectionism. We talked about the free\ntrade rationale. And then the third rationale which\ncomes up often in the Court's opinions is political\nsolidarity. That is to say that the Commerce Clause was\nnot a grant of power to the national government to enact\nfree trade laws, but rather it was a grant of power to\nthe national government to prevent Union-dividing\nfriction between the States.\nWe don't have that friction here. All 49\nStates support Kentucky's position. Where that\npolitical friction is not an issue, the need for\njudicial invalidation of the laws of 42 States is\ncommensurately less.\nOn the other hand, what are the things that\nwe think that the Commerce Clause doesn't require --\ndoesn't require the States to do? It doesn't require\nthe States to give up incentives to local business\nactivities within the State. The Commerce Clause\ndoesn't throw into the maw of the free market, the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: How do you reconcile that\nwith the Bacchus case?\nMR. TROWER: Well, Bacchus was a case which\nfavored the in-State pineapple wine producers --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Correct.\nMR. TROWER: -- with a tax.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I've always thought it was\nincorrectly decided, to be honest with you, but it's\nthere. It's been there a long time.\nMR. TROWER: That doesn't surprise me at\nall, Justice Stevens, because your concurring opinion in\nAlexandria Scrap said the same thing. We agree with\nthat position.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we have to\noverrule Bacchus to agree with you?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. TROWER: No, sir. No, sir. The\nsuggestion that we're making here today is that a tax\nexemption which applies directly and exclusively to the\npayment of money by a government to its direct trading\npartners is all you're dealing with here. That would\nnot change the result in Bacchus, Boston Stock Exchange,\nor any of the other discriminatory tax cases because all\nof those cases involved a -- a tax or an exemption.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does your argument\ndepend upon the uses to which Kentucky is putting these\nproceeds?\nMR. TROWER: No, sir.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought it\nwould because you're saying nobody else is responsible\nfor public works in Kentucky and so on.\nMR. TROWER: I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI thought you meant it made a difference whether they\nspent them on an airport or --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. Just a public\nfacility.\nMR. TROWER: Yes, sir. Governmental.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, if Kentucky had\na law that it could only -- no out-of-State car dealer\ncould sell cars in Kentucky, that benefited Kentucky car\ndealers, and then it had a special tax on Kentucky car\ndealers to fund local hospitals, airports, roads,\nwhatever -- that would be all right?\nMR. TROWER: I don't think that would be all\nright. I think that's the West Lynn Creamery case in\nreverse.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it doesn't\nmatter? So the use to which the proceeds are put\ndoesn't save an otherwise discriminatory activity?\nMR. TROWER: The -- it is the -- it is the\nentity which chooses the use to which the proceeds are\nput that determines the Commerce Clause situation. The\nchoice of -- of sewers, airports, schools, that's up to\nthe governmental entity to make.\nI'll reserve my time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Trower.\nMr. Brunstad.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF G. ERIC BRUNSTAD, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis is a tax case and that makes a\ndifference. It's not a case about a monopoly, and\nwhat's key about that is that Kentucky has not taken\nover the national municipal bond market. It hasn't\ntaken over the market. It is trying to regulate the\nmarket with this facially discriminatory tax. It is\nfacially discriminatory because on its face the statute\nsays if you buy in Kentucky an in-State bond you have a\ntax exemption. If you're in Kentucky and you buy the\nout-of-State bond, we tax you. This is no different\nfrom the Bacchus case or the Fulton case or Boston Stock\nExchange.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or United Haulers.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: It's very different, Your\nHonor. Oh, no, it's very different, Mr. Chief Justice,\nfrom United Haulers. There inherent in the power to\ntake over -- the State took over the local trash\nhandling market -- the power to create a monopoly is the\npower to exclude all competition.\nHere Kentucky does not have a monopoly.\nThey merely issue the commodity. Then, once it is in\nprivate hands, an interest in being paid.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then of course you win as\nsoon as we say the commodity is the same as milk.\nObviously to me you would, but that's the issue. And in\nUnited Haulers what the question was, I thought, is if\nit is a traditional governmental function, anyway --\nsay, like producing electricity, or cleaning the\nstreets -- there they discriminate and say you have to\nbuy in State -- well, it's different, and indeed it may\nbe okay.\nSo what you've just heard your brother --\nbrother argue is if this is a fortiori, because here\nit's not even making electricity; it's not even\ncollecting trash; it is financing the most basically\ngovernmental of all governmental institutions --\nlibraries, schools, streets.\nNow, why isn't it a fortiori from United\nHaulers, given the nature of the task that they are\nraising the money to finance?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Three reasons, Justice\nBreyer. First, as this Court stated in Oregon Waste,\nthe purpose of or justification for a law has no bearing\non whether it is facially discriminatory. Secondly, as\nthis Court held in Bacchus, as long as there is some\ncompetition between the locally produced exempt product\nand nonexempt products from outside the State, there is\na discriminatory effect. Here if you look at what --\nwhat are these bonds?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Can a State --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're arguing -- but can a\nState do this? It produces a service or product; it\nsells the service or product to in-State people at a\nprice 50 percent less than it sells to out-of-State\npeople.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Certainly, Your Honor. Under\nthe market participant doctrine, if -- if you want to\nsell cement and you own the State-owned cement plant,\nyou can choose. You recall in South-Central --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, you're saying if\nthe State owns cement, it can sell 50 percent less to\nits in-State citizens than out-of-State?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: That's what this Court held\nin Reeves v. Stake.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fine. Then could it do\nthis? Could it say that if you buy cement from\nout of State, the answer is no, right?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Through a tax, no. And I\nthink the Court's precedent in South-Central --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Suppose what\nthey are selling is education? Can the University of\nCalifornia say that when you send your child to the\nUniversity of California, you will get a thousand\ndollars back on your income tax. But if you send the\nchild to an out-of-State school, you don't?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: There the State is supplying\neducational services to its citizens, and under the\nmarket participant doctrine that would be fine. I think\nthis hypothetical --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well if that's fine, then\nwhat they say is we sell you participation in the\nfinancing of the project.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But that's not what the tax\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if you buy -- we sell\nyou the participation. It's called a bond, and if in\nfact you give the money to us, and you are in-State, you\nget a thousand dollars back. But if in fact, when you\ndo the identical thing, and you buy a similar thing from\nout-of-State, you do not get the money back? How is\nthat different from what you just said was okay in\nrespect to the University of California?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Breyer, that would be\na subsidy, and this Court drew the very distinction in\nthe New Energy case as the difference between subsidy\nand a tax. And that I think is absolutely critical; and\nI think here Justice Holmes' admonition that a page of\nhistory is worth a volume of logic makes sense. The\nrallying cry for the American Revolution was \"no\nsubsidies without representation,\" it was \"no taxation\nwithout representation.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm sorry, then I\nwasn't clear in the hypothetical. The hypothetical was\nthat you get a thousand-dollar rebate on your income\ntax. So I was trying to make it exactly like this case.\nYou pay a lower State tax.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But I think -- I think there\nyou would look through the form to the substance, and\nthe substance there is we will charge you X amount for\ntuition and we are giving you part of that back as a\nrebate. That is no different from a subsidy. Here is\ncompletely different, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is it any different\nfrom a tax credit?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Well here, Your Honor, as the\nCourt made plain -- made plain in the Camps case, Camps\nNewfound/Owatonna, a tax exemption is not the sort of\ndirect State involvement in the market that falls within\nthe market participation doctrine. There is a key\ndifference between a tax and a subsidy.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But in that case, the only\nthing the State was doing was taxing. Here in Justice\nBreyer's hypothetical, in the case we've got, the State\nis also participating in a bond market.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: No, Your Honor, not in -- the\npart that they are taxing is not their participation\npart. I think a hypothetical will crystalize this.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why do we draw that line?\nI mean, you -- a moment ago you were talking about the\n-- the realities of subsidy. Why don't we confront the\nrealities of -- of the fact that the State's\nparticipation in the bond market and the -- and the tax\nexemption go together hand in hand? It's unrealistic to\ndivide them.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Because, Justice Souter,\nthere is a fundamental difference between the two. A\ntax tears down; a subsidy builds up. If you want to\nsubsidize your local park --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So what? The economic\nreality is precisely the same.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But not constitutionally,\nJustice Souter, and here is why --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Not constitutionally, we\nhave said, in cases in which the State is not acting\npurely as the regulator. Here the State is not acting\npurely as the regulator. The State has a dual capacity,\nand you say ignore one side of that capacity for the\nother; and my question is why?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Because, Justice Souter, here\nwhat the State is taxing is the out-of-State commodity.\nIt is taxing -- it is doing a downstream regulation.\nThe State issues a commodity -- just like in\nSouth-Central; the State issued the timber; the State\nowned the timber, and then it imposed a downstream\nregulation on the purchase --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but it's not taxing an\nout-of-State commodity in the sense of a commodity which\nis manufactured or produced out-of-State.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But Your Honor, it's no\ndifferent than the Boston Stock Exchange case, where we\nare talking about securities -- or in Fulton, Your Honor\n-- shares of stock.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In which case the State was\nnot a participant, but the State is here.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But the State is using its\ntaxing power to regulate -- to regulate interstate\ncommerce, whereas in United Haulers, Chief Justice\nRoberts, there was no tax. There was no discriminatory\ntax. And inherent in the power to create a monopoly is\nthe inherent power to preclude competition. Here there\nis competition. There is economic gamesmanship, Justice\nSouter. They want to sell their bonds nationally but\nhoard their own investment dollars locally, which is\nprecisely --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you want to\nsuggest -- I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. Please.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you suggesting\nthat the result in United Haulers would have been\ndifferent if there were a competing trash processing\nfacility out-of-State?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: No, Your Honor, because there\nagain we have a monopoly. The State took over the\nentire market -- the trash disposal facility of\nrecycling and everything else in the United Haulers\ncase. Inherent in the power to create a monopoly is the\npower to exclude competition. There is no\ndiscrimination by definition.\nHere they have not taken over the market.\nThey are imposing a downstream regulation by taxing the\nout-of-State commodity, and the distinction is\nexactly --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they are not\ntaxing the out-of-State commodity. Their tax is imposed\nsimply on Kentucky taxpayers.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: I think, Chief Justice\nRoberts, the analysis that the Court made in the New\nEnergy case is directly on point and addresses this.\nThere the Court said the Commerce Clause does not\nprohibit all State action designed to give its residents\nan advantage in the marketplace, but only action of that\ndescription in connection with the State's regulation of\ninterstate commerce. Direct subsidies of domestic\nindustry does not ordinarily run afoul of that\nprohibition; discriminatory taxation does. Again --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And this situation is\nsomewhere in between the two. Because although we do\nnot have what in form is a subsidy, we have what in\neconomic reality is a subsidy for the benefit of the\nState's own activity as a bond issuer.\nSo the question again is, why do we accept\nyour characterization that this case should be treated\nexactly as if the State were acting merely in a\nregulatory capacity?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Because Justice Souter, the\nentire purpose of the dormant Commerce Clause\njurisprudence is to protect the integrity of the market.\nIf Kentucky wants to have a subsidy and say we are going\nto subsidize our own residents, fine. That builds up\nsomething in Kentucky.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And the whole purpose of --\nof the combined effect of market participant for the --\nacting for the purpose of providing an essentially\ngovernmental service is to give the State a free hand.\nWhy do we ignore that in your argument in favor simply\nof the regulatory side?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Because, Justice Souter, what\nthey are doing here is imposing a facially\ndiscriminatory tax. They have the burden of saying,\nunder the Court's precedents, they have no other\nalternative.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the question is whether\nit will be treated as we treat a facially discriminatory\ntax when there is no market participation, there is no\nState participation for the purpose of providing a\nfundamental governmental service. If -- if in fact\nthere is a good reason to treat them differently, then\nwe don't follow the -- the facial discrimination test.\nLet me -- let me ask a -- a question with\nthat as the premise. Assuming -- and I obviously do\nassume -- that we have a choice of analysis here, one\ngood reason to choose the analysis that your brother\nhas -- that the State is forwarding is the fact that we\nhave historically a bond market which has grown up since\nNew York issued the first tax-exempt or -- a bond.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: In 1919, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And we have an enormous\nmarket, the effect of interrupting which we really, as a\nCourt, cannot tell very much. And that seems to me a\nvery good reason to give the nod to the -- to the market\nparticipant, the essential services side of what the\nState is doing, as opposed to the regulatory side, and\nsimply confront the thing under Pike.\nWhy isn't that a good reason?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Because, Justice Souter, this\ncase represents a classic race to the bottom where the\nonly reason why we have these discriminatory tax laws is\nbecause New York started it in 1919.\nIt wanted to hoard its own local investment\ndollars and yet sell its bonds nationally.\nEvery other State caught on, and that\ncreates a problem in the marketplace which the dormant\ncommerce claim --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, you have a perfectly\ngood remedy in respect to that. If the States don't\nlike this race to the bottom, they need only create a\ncompact or go to Congress.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But a compact is precisely,\nYour Honor, what the dormant commerce clause was\ndesigned to prevent -- States coming together and trying\nto create regional compacts or trying to create favored\ntrade deals among themselves.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You know, I was only -- I\nwas only addressing your point that there was a\npractical problem. Insofar as there is a practical\nproblem, it seems to me the States have a perfectly good\nremedy even if they lose this case.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Even if they lose this case\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: Or win the case, whatever.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But Justice Breyer, the whole\npoint --\nJUSTICE BREYER: However.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: I think -- I think that the\nCourt's analysis in Quill is on point here. In the\nCourt's analysis in Quill the Court said look, we have\nthis very clear rule that says States cannot engage in\nfacially discriminatory taxation. They can't do it.\nAnd if, in fact, we are wrong -- if, in\nfact, the Court's precedent creates a problem, then it's\nsomething that Congress can easily fix. The States can\ngo to Congress.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But our approach in\nthe General Motors case was the exact opposite. There\nwe couldn't figure out whether the market for natural\ngas was captive or not captive.\nIt was a little of each, and we kind of said\nwell, you know, if it's kind of a close question, leave\nit for Congress. Because, after all, the Commerce\nClause talks about Congress' power. The dormant\nCommerce Clause is not mentioned.\nSo this is an area where Congress can\nregulate if it wants to, and it has never shown the\nslightest interest in interfering with State tax\nexemptions for their own bonds.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But, Chief Justice Roberts,\nthe same could have been said for the problem in\nGranholm, where 26 States had the same no direct\nshipment problem; or the same problem in Bacchus where\n36 States had the same discriminatory alcohol tax laws.\nCongress didn't --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It strikes me as\nmuch more fundamental, whether or not a State can issue\na tax exemption for its -- its bonds. That seems more\nfundamental than the more specialized issues in those\nother cases.\nAnd I think we have said when you're dealing\nwith a specialized issue that may not get the attention\nof Congress, we have a different approach.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But, Chief Justice Roberts,\nCongress is as unlikely to address this problem now that\nit's so pervasive as it was to address the problem in\nGranholm, or the problem in Bacchus, or any of those\nother cases, or the problem in Fulton. Congress has\nplenty of other things to do.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That argument cuts against\nyou in context, I think. You're saying in every case of\nany kind of discrimination one could go to Congress.\nAbsolutely right.\nAnd since that's true of every case, now we\nare back to the more basic question, leaving the\npracticalities that you were talking about out of it, of\nwhether this case is more like the cows. Is it more\nlike the garbage collection?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Or is it on the far side of\nthe garbage collection, even a stronger case for\npermission under the Commerce Clause?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Breyer, this case is\nlike milk. That's what that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's where I wanted you\nto begin.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: If you look at -- it is -- it\nis, Chief Justice Breyer. If you look at bonds,\nmunicipal bonds -- and we have some samples of an\nAlabama bond and a Kentucky bond in the supplemental\nappendix.\nThese are standardized forms that are traded\nas commodities like any other securities. They have the\nsame regulatory overlay, which is distinct from General\nMotors v. Tracy.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's not\ndistinct from United Haulers. Garbage is garbage, too.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: That's true.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the fact that\nbonds are bonds doesn't seem to me to be very\nresponsive.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But the point -- two points,\nChief Justice Roberts -- one is that in United Haulers\nwe did not have a tax on the out-of-State commodity\ncoming in. Here we do.\nThe second thing -- and I think this is\ncritical -- we have a monopoly.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You didn't have a tax on\nthe out-of-State. You have an income tax charged to\nKentucky residents on their income from that bond. It's\nquite different.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But, Justice Stevens, that\npoints out how this is a downstream regulation. The\nState's participation ends when it is done issuing the\nbond. It goes to underwriters who then trade them in\nthe privately-owned national bond market, no different\nthan in South Central.\nThe State of Alaska owned the timber. It\nsold the timber in the marketplace. Then it sought to\nimpose this downstream regulation.\nIt would be the same as if New York City\nsaid, we have a local water company, and we have a\nmonopoly. And now we have someone who we are licensing,\na private business, to bottle that water to sell. And\nwe are slapping a tariff on Poland Springs from Maine,\nbecause we want to protect the local business.\nThat's what's happening here. The State has\nalready issued the commodity. It is now in the\nmarketplace, and now they are basically prohibiting the\nsale of it, or they are restricting the sale, by a\ndiscriminatory -- in essence, tariff.\nIf you live in Kentucky, we want to\ndiscourage you from buying a Michigan bond. And they do\nit by saying we will tax the interest on the -- on the\nout-of-State bond, and not tax the interest on the\nin-State bond. They are giving themselves a leg up.\nAnd one of the pernicious aspects of this is\nthat it has the effect of pooling capital within the\nnational market. It has the effect of creating this\ndiscriminatory barrier.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The victims under your\napproach, as I understand it, are the 49 other States,\nand all of them seem to support your opponent in the\nbriefs that were filed in this case.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: True, Justice Stevens, but\nthey don't want to issue refunds. You can understand\nthat. A short-term gain for a long-term solution that\nwould make them all better off, that would end this race\nto the bottom.\nMy clients, the Davises, are penalized\nbecause they are engaging in interstate commerce. They\nare penalized. Because they own out-of-State bonds,\nthey pay a tax.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your argument that\nyou just presented in response to Justice Stevens'\nquestion, I think, relies on the discrimination against\nthe out-of-State issuers.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your clients are not\nout-of-State issuers.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: That's true.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We don't have an\noverbreadth doctrine under the Commerce Clause. Why\naren't their arguments limited to discrimination against\nthem rather than discrimination against out-of-State\nissuers?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Well, for the same reason\nthat it wouldn't be limited with the -- the taxpayer in\nFulton or the in-State taxpayer in Bacchus, where they\nare basically arguing that this affects interstate\ncommerce.\nAnd as illustrative of that, we are saying\nlook, in Bacchus you had the local brandy, and the local\npineapple wine got a tax rate.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your Kentucky\ntaxpayers can argue about the discrimination against\nout-of-State bond issuers?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: They can argue about the\ndiscriminatory effects of this law on the marketplace as\na whole, because they are participants in the market.\nThey are penalized for engaging in interstate commerce,\nthe same way that all of the same arguments were\npresented in the Bacchus case with an in-State taxpayer,\nthe Fulton case with an in-State taxpayer.\nAnd the Court has basically made that plain\nin the New Energy case. You don't have to demonstrate\nthat there is some overwhelming, you know, sky is\nfalling problem. Any discrimination with respect to\ninterstate commerce, any discriminatory effect,\nbasically --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do we know that\nyour clients will be better off regardless of how this\ncase is resolved? One way to resolve it, of course,\nwould be to take away the Kentucky tax exemption, which\nwould hurt your clients.\nAnother way to resolve it would be to extend\nthe tax exemption to the Ohio bonds, which may hurt your\nclients if the Kentucky bonds aren't competitive, and\nthe price of the Kentucky bonds goes down. They are\ngoing to lose either way.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: The remedy, Your Honor, would\nbe for the State to decide whether it wants to make all\nmunicipal bonds tax-exempt or to make them all taxable.\nNow, in Kentucky there is a constitutional\nprovision which says they cannot -- they basically\ncannot have their own bonds other than tax-exempt.\nSo unless they change their constitution,\nthe result would be to make all the bond, municipal\nbonds, tax-exempt in Kentucky, which, of course, would\nbenefit my clients, who hold out-of-State municipal\nbonds. But consider this --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But whether or not\nit benefits them, it seems to me, depends on how\ncompetitive they are with other States' municipal bonds.\nIn other words, their advantage now comes\nfrom the tax exemption for Kentucky bonds; and it's not\nclear, if that is eliminated across the board, that\nKentucky bonds are going to be competitive with, you\nknow, bonds of whatever other State. So the value of\nthem may go down, and your clients may lose, whether you\nwin or not.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But, Chief Justice Roberts,\nconsider these two critical points:\nOne cardinal principle of investment is\ndiversification. These discriminatory tax laws\nbasically compel people to hold only the bonds within\ntheir particular State. Prospectuses for these\nsingle-State bond funds say: Warning -- not diverse.\nThe second thing is their higher cost.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean it -- it\nprovides an advantage depending on the level of the\nState income tax and, I suppose, the level of the\nexemption. It doesn't necessarily mean that that's the\nonly bonds they are going to hold.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But that simply means that if\nthe State has a very high income tax, say, in\nCalifornia, that's all the more reason, all the more\npenalty, for people who want to engage in interstate\ncommerce and diversify their portfolios.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it's less of a\nproblem if it's like Kentucky, which, I assume, has a\nlower income tax.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Kentucky has a lower income\ntax, but I think on the -- on the problem that was\nraised, what if we -- if we affirm in this case, what\nwould the impact be?\nWell, the State of Kentucky has said,\nitself, that if it has to pay out refunds, we are\ntalking about a $4 million per year refund obligation\nthe State of Kentucky has said it will have to pay.\nThe sky is not going to fall. What would\nhappen is that bond prices might adjust, but we would\nhave the free national market with interstate trade and\nmunicipal bonds unimpaired by these artificial\nconstraints. These artificial discriminatory tax\nregimes create artificial demand. They pull assets.\nThey hoard assets, local investment dollars, within\nparticular States. And you have a problem where, say,\ncash-scarce States like, for example, Tennessee have\nmore of a restricted access to capital markets like New\nYork. If you're an investor in New York and you have\nmoney to spend in municipal bonds, you're discouraged\nfrom buying Tennessee bonds; you're encouraged from\nbuying New York State municipal bonds. The relatively\ncapital-scarce States are harmed. Again, people like\nthe Davises, they are harmed, they are penalized from\nengaging in interstate commerce.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I can ask your brother who\nrepresents Petitioner -- maybe I'd better should -- I'd\nget a better answer from him so far as his position.\nAs you understand his position, as you\nunderstand the State's position, would it be permissible\nfor State A to go to State B and say: We -- if you make\nyour bonds nontaxable to our residents, we'll make your\nbonds nontaxable to your residents.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: We actually have that,\nJustice Kennedy. Ohio, when it enacted its\ndiscriminatory tax scheme here similar to Kentucky's, it\nbasically said: We will tax the bonds of an\nout-of-State State, unless they do not tax Utah bonds.\nSo -- but you can see that clearly illustrates, to me --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you find that\nconsistent with the vision of the framers for our\nnational market under the Commerce Clause?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Inconsistent, Justice\nKennedy. Inconsistent. This is nothing more than an\nongoing low-level trade war. It was started by New York\nin 1919, when it basically created this discriminatory\ntax scheme for itself. It basically incentivizes all\nthe States to follow suit. And it's easy to understand\nwhy.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the example\nthat was given of a interstate compact, say, to operate\na port authority that covers a few States, and the\ncompacters agree that they are not going to tax the\nincome on bonds issued by the port authority, but they\nare going to tax the income from out-of-State municipal,\nbut it's only the bonds from this port authority. So\nthey -- it seems your theory would reach that too.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: It would, Justice Ginsburg.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And yet Congress has\napproved compacts that say just that.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But where Congress\nspecifically speaks to permitting a particular practice,\nthen it can't violate the dormant Commerce Clause. Here\nCongress has not spoken. The States are doing this on\ntheir own.\nAnd, Justice Kennedy, again, it is\ncompletely inconsistent with the vision of the framers\nbecause what's happening here, again, is the race to the\nbottom, where New York said: All right, we're going to\nsell our bonds nationally; ah, we're going to create an\ninvestment for all the capital in New York to stay in\nNew York.\nAnd you can see why every other State\nafterwards said: Oh, look what New York is doing. We\nhave to follow suit to try to equal the playing field.\nAnd, again, that is at the heart of the ongoing\nlow-level trade war with the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it assumes\nit's all in the definition of your market. If your\nmarket is tax-exempt bonds nationwide, it's one thing;\nbut your brother says the market ought to be people who\nissue bonds for public works in Kentucky, and Kentucky\nis the only one who does that so there is no\ndiscrimination against anyone else because nobody else\nis similarly situated to Kentucky with respect to\nKentucky public works.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But, Chief Justice Roberts,\nhere it's easy to tell what the market is. Kentucky\nmunicipal bonds, in spite of the tax discrimination,\nsell in a national, single market. There is a national\nFederal overlay. Under Federal income tax purposes,\nthey're all tax exempt. They're all regulated under the\nsame Federal securities laws. The fraud parts of the\nsecurities laws apply. They all compete for each other.\nIt's the fact that they compete for each other.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is there any evidence in\nthe record as to how much -- what percentage of the\nKentucky bonds are bought by Kentucky residents?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: There is no good data on that\ninformation, Justice Stevens. We do not have an answer\nto that. But I think the point --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Does it -- do we have it\nfor any State?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: No, we do not, Justice\nStevens. We do not.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought it\nwas inherent in your argument that most of them -- I\nmean, if you're talking about hoarding capital, it\ndoesn't work very well if a lot of people outside\nKentucky are buying these bonds. There's not much\nBalkanization if they're circulated widely. I thought\nthat your argument depended on the proposition that most\nof these bonds are bought by Kentucky residents.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: There is Balkanization, but\nit's not complete Balkanization, just like the tax in --\nthat Hawaii imposed on the alcohol didn't prevent the\nsale of fine California chardonnay imported into Hawaii;\nit just promoted the sale of the locally produced wine.\nIt doesn't have to be a complete ban, as this Court\nexplained in Limbach, a complete ban or a discrimination\nthat imposes a burden. There's no constitutional\ndifference.\nAnd that applies here too, but the market\ncriteria the Court applied in GMC versus Tracy, I think,\napplies here. You don't look to define the market by,\ngee, what's going to happen or what's the purpose of the\nparticular discrimination? You look at ordinary\ncommercial factors. And here the ordinary commercial\nfactors are there is one national market in which these\nstandardized commodities trade. They're issued by the\nState. They're owned by individuals. Kentucky doesn't\nown the bonds. Kentucky issues them. They are then\ntraded in the national market.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- not really standardize.\nEven without a tax exemption, residents of Kentucky\nwould be interested in public improvements in Kentucky\nand have -- give a slight edge in the market to all\nKentucky bonds. I think there would be just a natural\npreference for locally issued bonds.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: And if they choose to do\nthat, that's fine.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And not totally fungible.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: And of course that would not\nbe prevented by having nondiscriminatory taxes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but it's a fact of the\nmarket, it seems to me, that Kentucky bonds are\ncharacteristically more attractive to Kentucky citizens\nthan they are to out-of-State citizens.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But, Justice Stevens, I think\nthat's an idiosyncratic value, not shared. Most\ninvestors care about yield and --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I assume there would be a\npreference to Massachusetts milk for Massachusetts\nbuyers, to Michigan automobiles for Michigan buyers, and\nthe State did not subsidize.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But, Justice Kennedy, that\nstrikes me as the argument that Japan made --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- authorities --\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Kennedy, that strikes\nme as the argument that Japan made when it said: We\nshould keep American made skis out of the Japanese\nmarket because Japanese snow is different from American\nsnow. I mean you can't use those kinds of\njustifications to say --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's not\nfair because Kentucky is going to use the proceeds of\nthe bonds to build a hospital, a school that is going to\nserve Kentucky residents.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So there's -- it's\nnot just emotional attachment to Kentucky that would\npromote the purchase of those bonds by Kentucky\nresidents. It's self-interest. They want a public\nhospital nearby, and, therefore, it makes sense to buy\nthe hospital bonds.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But, Chief Justice Roberts,\nevery tax serves a public purpose. Every tax is for the\nState's purposes. If this Court opens the door in this\ncase to say that this facially discriminatory tax regime\nis okay, this Court will open the door to all of the\ndiscriminatory taxes the Court has heretofore struck\ndown. This case -- this Court's discriminatory tax\nprecedents --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's a very --\nthere's a very big difference between -- and it gets to\nthe difference with the Wisconsin cows, which was\naddressed in United Haulers. That's a tax on private\nactivity, and private actors don't have the\nresponsibility of providing government services.\nKentucky does.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But every State does that.\nAnd I think we need to maintain three clear\ndistinctions: Taxes, monopolies, and subsidies. They\nare constitutionally distinct. Why? If you look at the\nConstitution, you see all kinds of restrictions on\ndiscriminatory taxes. There is no --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't see a\ndormant Commerce Clause, though.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But the -- this Court's\ndormant Commerce Clause precedents are directed to\npreserving the integrity of markets. Once you stray and\nyou do not have those clear lines between monopolies,\nUnited Haulers, discriminatory taxes, and subsidies,\nthen I think you make -- you take what is a very clear\nmonument of economic freedom, this idea of no\ndiscriminatory taxes certainly not discriminatory taxes\non their face, and you blur those distinctions and you\npull down this monument the Court has.\nAs the Court -- for the reasons the Court\nsaid in Quill, these distinctions are important. If\nCongress, in this particular area, does not like the\nresult, it can change the result. But,\njurisprudentially, we need to maintain a distinction\nbetween subsidies, between monopolies, and between\ntaxes. Again --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The Court, in that old\nBonaparte case, it was just kind of very naive because\nthe Court made a decision that didn't -- that State A\ncan't create bonds that are going to be exempt from tax\nin other States, right?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Not quite, Justice Ginsburg.\nThat was a full-faith-and-credit case in which the\nMaryland resident said: Oh, I own out-of-State bonds;\ntherefore Maryland can't tax me because the out-of-State\nState wouldn't tax me if I lived there. A completely\ndifferent issue, Your Honor. This issue was not before\nthe Court in Bonaparte.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Brunstad.\nMr. Trower, you have 12 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF C. CHRISTOPHER TROWER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. TROWER: Let's start with the idea that\nthe Kentucky tax penalizes Respondents for participating\nin interstate commerce. The answer there is no. The\nKentucky tax affords a direct trading partner, that is\nto say a person that owns Kentucky bonds, a quid pro\nquo. If a Kentucky taxpayer loans money to Kentucky,\nKentucky gives a tax exemption to that person that loans\nmoney to Kentucky. If a Kentucky resident chooses to\nloan money to California by buying California bonds, no\ntax exemption is afforded.\nBut that different treatment is not a\npenalty, we would submit, but rather a recognition that\nthe Kentucky resident who loans money to Kentucky is\nentitled to receive something in return.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why do you\ncare, Mr. Trower? I mean, if you lose your tax\nexemption, it means you've got to pay more interest to\nsell your bonds, but it also means you're going to get\ntaxes that you don't get now. Isn't it kind of a wash?\nDoes it really matter.\nMR. TROWER: It matters tremendously, Your\nHonor. Seventy-five percent of all municipal bonds\nissued in America are issued by municipalities, local\nagencies, and those bonds -- under $10 million in\nprincipal amount -- those bonds account for only 7\npercent of the total volume of bonds outstanding. We\npointed this -- citations for this are in our reply\nbrief.\nThe significance would be that many\nmunicipalities might have no market access at all for\ntheir bonds. An investor could ignore 75 percent of all\nbonds that are issued.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but the State's\ngoing to have more money from their income taxes, and if\nthey want to spend it on a project in a particular\nmunicipality, they will be free to do that.\nMR. TROWER: They would be and that's\ncorrect, Mr. Chief Justice. But that choice is a choice\nthat the Commerce Clause lets the States make, the\nchoice to either raise taxes or to have a tax exemption.\nJUSTICE ALITO: It seems to me you're making\na lot of arguments that, if accepted, would -- maybe\nthis isn't true of all of your arguments, but certainly\nmany of them would demonstrate that the Commerce Clause\njurisprudence is utterly incoherent. If taxation is the\nsame thing as a subsidy, if congressional inaction is\nthe same thing as approval, if Kentucky bonds are not\nreally in the same market as out-of-State bonds, what\nwould be left of Commerce, of dormant Commerce Clause\njurisprudence if those arguments were accepted?\nMR. TROWER: Well, all of the cases in which\nthe tax exemption or -- or other restrictive law favored\nin-State private business would be left untouched. What\nwe're arguing for here is a rule that would apply only\nto a transaction between the State itself and the\nbondholder.\nMarket participation, contrary to my\nbrother's suggestion, does not end when the bonds are\nissued any more than when you borrow money your\nparticipation with your lender ends once the loan is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I think that's true.\nThere's a national securities market. Everybody knows\nthat.\nMR. TROWER: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I don't think either\nside can avoid that fact. He's suggesting that it cuts\nmore in his favor than it does for yours because you are\ncreating artificial barriers to that market. So that\nwhen a person who knows about Kentucky bonds and who\nknows what the good ones are moves out of state, he all\nof a sudden loses the advantage to purchase those bonds\nanymore, or at least he does -- he takes a penalty for\ndoing that.\nLet me -- let me ask you this, the question\nI asked your co-counsel. A and D get together and agree\non reciprocal advantages for their -- for their\nrespective residents. Is that constitutional?\nMR. TROWER: If it's approved by Congress,\nyes, sir.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose it's not. And --\nMR. TROWER: I think that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And isn't that exactly\nwhat's happening here? Isn't that exactly what's\nhappening here? You have, in effect, a pact among\nStates to favor their own residents.\nMR. TROWER: You could make that argument,\nJustice Kennedy. But the -- the idea that what has\nhappened here is a race to the bottom is post hoc\nreasoning extraordinaire. The Kentucky constitution was\nenacted in 1890, 40 years before Kentucky had ever\nenacted an income tax. The California constitution,\nwhich also requires California to exempt its own bonds,\nwas enacted decades before California enacted an income\ntax.\nWe would suggest that the record of history\nis the States saw the opportunity to give their own\nresidents tax exemption as a way of finding a natural\nmarket for their bonds, and they chose to do that and\nthat the fact that they chose to do that makes sense for\nthe States that did it. It also made sense for those\nstates that didn't choose to do that.\nI would note that the seven states that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose any favored\nlegislation favoring local industry helps the State, and\nthe State residents like it. That's the whole point.\nThat's why the Commerce Clause exists as a check.\nMR. TROWER: Well, it's -- I wouldn't accept\nthat as the reason that the Commerce Clause exists as a\ncheck.\nBut let's examine that analysis. Where is\nthe political check here? Well, we know how the other\nStates would vote because they support Kentucky. SIFMA,\nwhich represents 90 percent of the bond trading --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All politics is local.\nAll States want to protect their residents and make it\nlook like they're doing something for their residents.\nAnd that's exactly the purpose of Commerce Clause\nprohibition against explicit discrimination, which is\nwhat this is. There's no doubt that this is explicit\ndiscrimination.\nMR. TROWER: There's no doubt that the law\non its face differentially treats two different kinds of\nbonds or different bonds issued by different States.\nWe're not contending that at all. The question is, is\nwhether that different treatment is permissible? The\nsuggestion that the commerce --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Since we are talking here\nabout the negative Commerce Clause, we really should say\nthat's the reason the Commerce Clause doesn't exist.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. TROWER: That's right. That's exactly\nright. And if we were -- if we were reading the -- the\nnegative Commerce Clause, I would call your attention to\nthe decisions in Reeves, which is exactly equivalent to\na home embargo, because it kept all the cement in South\nDakota; to the decisions in White and Alexandria Scrap,\nwhich were exactly equivalent to a border blockade,\nbecause they kept all the out-of-State workers from\nworking in Boston or at least up to the extent of 50\npercent of the work forces; and under Alexandria Scrap\nthe effect of the legislation was to keep all of the\nout-of-state towing companies from collecting the\nbounties. And then in United Haulers, yes, it wasn't a\ntax case, but that's a distinction without a difference,\nbecause what United Haulers was equivalent to was a home\nembargo.\nAnd it's the home embargo, the border\nblockade, and the discriminatory tariff or tax that are\nalways held up as the prototypes of things that our free\nmarket prevents, as is the monopoly, which my brother\nsays is okay if a State monopolizes all the trade, but\nit's not okay if a State still competes in the national\nmarket in the issuance of bonds but yet offers a direct\nfinancial incentive to its own taxpayers.\nWe come back to the effect of a tax\nexemption of this type. It is exactly equivalent to the\npayment of money by the State, because every dollar of\nthat tax exemption represents a detriment to the State.\nThe State is giving up revenue.\nNow, you're right, Mr. Chief Justice, it may\nbe a wash at the end of the day, but that's a decision\nthat the Commerce Clause leaves to the States to make.\nAnd your reference earlier to General Motors v. Tracy is\ndirectly on point here, because there you had a\nwell-established, long-established market that the Court\nwas loath to jump in without any institutional\ncompetence or information to evaluate the effects, where\nCongress could take action if any was necessary.\nWhat do we know about the historical record\nhere? We know Congress excruciatingly discussed, just\nanalyzed State tax and their effects on interstate\ncommerce and did nothing.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you want us to -- do you\nwant us to hold that if Congress is, quote, unquote,\naware of some sort of discrimination that the States are\nengaging in, that there is, therefore, no dormant\nCommerce Clause problem?\nMR. TROWER: No. That's not what we're\narguing for. We're not saying that what happened here\nis equal to the kind of express approval of\ndiscrimination, which the Court's precedents have\nrequired.\nWhat we're saying is where what we got is a\nCongress that has studied this problem and done nothing,\nwith a Congress that has routinely approved interstate\ncompacts between the States that provide for\ndifferential taxation of bonds, with a Congress that has\nprovided exemption from all tax for territory bonds,\nPuerto Rico, Guam -- those are completely exempt per\nacts of Congress, but Congress didn't go any further\nthan that, what is the conclusions for this Court to\ndraw? Does this Court rush in where Congress has failed\nto tread? We think not.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What is the difference\nbetween that situation and the sort of flow control\nordinance that was involved in Carbone? Wasn't Congress\naware of those?\nMR. TROWER: Yes. In fact, Congress had\nauthorized the kind of flow control ordinance that was\nset up in Carbone. But as the -- as the Court decided\nthe Carbone case, the facility in Carbone, in the view\nof the majority, was not a publicly owned facility. It\nwas a privately owned facility. If Carbone came up\nagain today, maybe a different analysis. But the\ndistinction between Carbone and United Haulers was\ndiscussed at length in United Haulers, and the Court\nfound that a distinction --\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, but why wasn't there the\nsame kind of congressional whatever it is, acquiescence,\nin Carbone that you're claiming there was here?\nMR. TROWER: I don't know that there wasn't\nthat same kind of congressional acquiescence. The\nquestion is -- is what -- what is the Court to make of\nthat congressional acquiescence or congressional failure\nto act? That's what we are arguing for here. We are\nnot saying Congress has sanctioned differential\ntaxation.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We are talking about not\njust a dormant Commerce Clause, but a dormant Congress.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What are -- what are\nexamples -- what are examples of Federal statutes that\nhave allowed explicit discrimination?\nMR. TROWER: Prudential versus Benjamin. I\nguess that's the insurance case, which of course we've\ngot --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In the insurance industry?\nMR. TROWER: Yes, sir, and that's obviously\nhuge as well. I think that's enough.\nIf there are no other questions, thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n"
