        "content": "(10:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in No. 00-568, New York v. Federal Energy Regulatory\nCommission and the companion case, 00-809.\nMr. Malone.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. MALONE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 00-568\nMR. MALONE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nFrom 1910 until the issuance of the FERC\ndecision under review, all 50 States regulated\ntransmissions of electricity to retail customers. You\ndidn't see the rates, terms, and conditions of that\nregulation, with a few exceptions, because the rates were\nbundled in bills that charged customers for all of the\nelements of retail service which are basically the energy\nitself, or the commodity, its delivery over transmission\nhigh voltage and distribution low voltage lines, and\nmetering and billing.\nThe issue in this case is whether the 1935\nCongress intended the Federal Power Commission, now FERC,\nto displace the State laws that required that regulation\nfrom 1910 until 1996 if the commodity, the energy -- not\nthe transmission, but the commodity -- is unbundled from\nthe retail customers' bills.\nThe FERC, while conceding that unbundling was\nnever contemplated by the 1935 Congress, nonetheless has\ntaken the position that if the commodity comes out of the\nbill, in order to give the customer knowledge to effect a\nchoice to buy energy from a utility or a non-utility, then\nthe transmission, although it still remains bundled with\nother elements and is never shown on the bill, except in\nthe State of California, becomes a new and separate\nservice and that that transmission is subject to\npreemption so that the States have to leave the scene for\nonly FERC --\nQUESTION: What if there -- what if there were\nno statute at all? Do you think that under the Commerce\nClause, with today's multi-state grids for transmission of\npower, that the States could have directly regulated\nenergy transmission as a separate service?\nMR. MALONE: I don't think there's any question,\nYour Honor, that under today's Commerce Clause\njurisprudence, the States would be able to regulate retail\ndeliveries over transmission facilities, particularly\nwithin their own States. Remember that retail is\nessentially a local business. Retail electricity. We\nhave 127,000 customers in this country, and FERC certainly\nis in no position to be regulating the rates, terms, and\nconditions charged those customers for transmission. And\nI think the -- the jurisprudence, under the dormant\nCommerce Clause, leaves no question that the States would\nbe able to continue regulate retail transmission.\nQUESTION: But the statute does give the FERC\njurisdiction over the transmission of electric energy in\ninterstate commerce. Are you saying this isn't the\ntransmission of electric energy in interstate commerce?\nMR. MALONE: Exactly. We are saying, Your\nHonor, that that transmission that was described in 201(b)\nin 1935 was not transmission headed to retail customers.\nThe court -- the Congress at that time was attempting to\nfill --\nQUESTION: But in 1935, we didn't have these\ninterstate grids, and isn't it conceivable that you could\nhave a power company producing power within a State and\ndistributing it to customers within the State, everything\ntotally intrastate? That may have been a common\noccurrence at the time the statute was passed. Today,\nwith the multi-state grid, it's hard to know how any\ntransmission that goes on that is other than interstate\ncommerce.\nMR. MALONE: Well, Your Honor, the rate of\ninterconnection from 1920 to 1935 was actually greater\nthan the rate of interconnection that we have seen since.\nThe Indiana Consumer Council's reply brief points that\nout. So, there's no question that the '35 Congress knew\nthat interconnection was coming. There certainly was\ninterconnection at the time in '35, and it recognized that\nnotwithstanding that interconnection, that retail\nregulation was a local service and that the States should\ncontinue it.\nAnd that's why, in addition to crafting 201(b)\nwhich referred to transmissions and sales -- and frankly,\nthe Congress wanted to give FERC jurisdiction to regulate\ntransmission independently of sales because if you have a\nsale from company A to company C, you might have company B\nthat isn't taking title and is simply transmitting.\nQUESTION: Are you -- are you saying either of\nthese two things? Either transmission regardless of the\nrate at which it is billed is -- is not essentially\ninterstate commerce, or are you saying that you simply\ncannot read the act to pick up that activity in interstate\ncommerce?\nMR. MALONE: I'm saying that the -- the latter\nwith -- with one caveat.\nQUESTION: So, you admit then that -- that it is\ninterstate commerce. It is subject to regulation if\nCongress wants to regulate it. This statute just doesn't\ndo it.\nMR. MALONE: It clearly is subject to regulation\nby Congress if it wants to. We don't need -- the States\ndo not need to get into the question of which\ntransmissions are in interstate commerce and which aren't\nin order to preserve its jurisdiction over retail\ntransmissions because Congress wanted the States to be\nable to continue to regulate retail transmissions.\nQUESTION: This is what I don't understand. You\n-- why do you have to say that Congress wanted the States\nto regulate transmissions?\nAs I read the statute, if -- if there's anything\nwrong with -- with FERC's position, it is that the statute\ndivides the -- there are a lot of ways of dividing the\nuniverse. The -- the statute divides it between\ntransmission and sale, and giving -- giving FERC authority\nover transmission means it can regulate the manner of\ntransmission, who -- who is authorized to transmit, who is\nrequired to transmit, and all that.\nBut the universe of sale is covered by the next\nportion. And FERC is authorized to fix prices, to\ninterfere with the sales, only at wholesale in interstate\ncommerce. And once -- once you're dealing with a sale at\nretail, FERC is just not given sales regulation authority.\nIt's still given transmission regulation authority, and it\ncould still forbid certain people from transmitting and it\ncould still impose certain requirements over transmission,\neven at the local level, but it simply cannot regulate the\nsales price.\nWhy isn't -- why isn't that the way to look at\nit rather than --\nMR. MALONE: Because the -- as the Colton case\nheld, there's a -- there's a bright line here between\nretail and wholesale. There are -- with no exceptions is\nwhat -- what the Court said.\nQUESTION: That's what I'm saying.\nMR. MALONE: All right.\nNow, what FERC is saying is if you unbundle the\ncommodity, that transmission becomes unbundled and it\nregulates transmissions to retail customers.\nYour Honor, if -- what we're interested in is\nthe following: protecting the rates and the service to\nthe 127 million customers in this country, and we don't\nwant to lose the ability to do that if we take a pro-\ncompetitive position and unbundle the commodity.\nNow, when we do that -- you're right, Your Honor\n-- the transmission is not even unbundled. It's not\nseparate. It's still -- it's not shown on -- on bills.\nQUESTION: But you seem to concede -- and I\ndon't see why you do it -- that the right to regulate\ntransmission includes the right to regulate sale.\nMR. MALONE: No, we -- we don't. We don't\nconcede that.\nWhat I'm saying is that when unbundles -- when\none unbundles transmission, the States don't lose it, even\nif it's out there by itself, if it's part of retail. Let\nme give an example.\nQUESTION: But doesn't it depend -- doesn't it\ndepend on what sale means? If it's sale of the commodity,\nit says, sale of such energy at wholesale in interstate\ncommerce. Those are the words of the statute: sale of\nsuch energy. The transmission cost is -- is not the same\nas the energy itself. So, why couldn't one read this:\nthe sale of the energy, the commodity, at retail belongs\nto the State, but not the transportation or transmission\ncost?\nMR. MALONE: Because when -- let's go back to\n1935, Your Honor. When FERC brought this bill to\nCongress, it said the main portion of the bill is\ntransmission. The retail transmissions are being\nregulated by the State and that's the most important part\nbecause that's the most -- that's the largest part of the\nbill.\nNow, if we take the position -- and -- and --\nQUESTION: By bill, you mean the bill that the\ncustomer gets.\nMR. MALONE: Yes.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. MALONE: Now -- now, this Court has said\nmany time, Your Honor -- times, Your Honor -- I know,\nJustice Scalia, you don't reference the legislative\nhistory, but you do accept reading provisions in harmony.\nWe have to read 201(b), the language, Justice Ginsburg,\nthat you're referring to, with 201(a), 206(d), and 212(h).\nThose --\nQUESTION: Where do we find these?\nMR. MALONE: They are -- they are -- I'm sorry,\nYour Honor. They're in the -- the statutory appendix to\nour -- to our brief.\nQUESTION: And whereabouts? Starting with 652a?\nMR. MALONE: The -- I don't have the -- the page\nreference off the top of my head. It's -- they are\nrecited in our briefs. And the language -- I don't -- I'm\nnot trying to quote the language specifically, Your Honor.\nI'm just trying to give the conceptual strain that runs\nthrough these statutes.\nBasically what we have Congress saying is that\nthe Federal Government has to fill the Attleboro gap, and\nthat relates to wholesale transactions.\nQUESTION: Well, you're summarizing a series of\nstatutory provisions in those words?\nMR. MALONE: No. I'm -- no. I'm trying to get\nto what -- what 201(a), 206(d), and 212(h) do\ncollectively, Your Honor.\nThe -- the FERC has drawn your attention to\n201(b) throughout this case. The questioning has been on\nthe meaning of the word transmission in 201(b). The point\nis that the other provisions of the statute, 201(a),\n206(d), and 212(h), say something else. They say that\nFERC's jurisdiction over --\nQUESTION: Do you want to give us the U.S.C.\ncites of those things? It's crazy when you people who\nspend your whole life in this one statute use the old --\nthe old numbers instead of the United States Code numbers.\nYou're talking about 16 U.S.C. 824(a) and (b). Right?\nMR. MALONE: Yes. That's correct, Your Honor.\nThat's correct.\nAnd I -- and basically what -- what the first\nprovision says is that FERC's jurisdiction over\ntransmission is limited to that part of transmission that\ninvolves transmissions for distribution, so that where\nenergy that is --\nQUESTION: You're talking now about section (a)?\nMR. MALONE: Yes, Your Honor.\nAnd that's conceptually -- what it -- what it\nsays is that FERC's -- the universe of -- of transmission\nthat FERC is going to regulate is energy that is being\nresold.\nNow, the point here is that we all know what\nCongress intended in 1935.\nQUESTION: Well, just on that, is it the case\nthat if in 1935 Duke Power owns generating facilities in\nWest Virginia, owns lines from West Virginia to North\nCarolina, and owns a distribution company in North\nCarolina, all one company, does the FPC have any\njurisdiction at all in your opinion?\nMR. MALONE: If there's a sale for resale --\nQUESTION: No, no. Look. Take my example.\nMR. MALONE: No.\nQUESTION: Not what you're saying.\nMR. MALONE: There is a case in 1934 at 2 P.U.R.\n2d, where it's -- it's almost your -- your hypothetical.\nIt's Carolina Power & Light.\nQUESTION: All right. So, your point then is if\nmy hypothetical is true in 1935, all we have in this case\nis 1935, is my hypothetical, with the additional fact that\ninstead of Duke Power which really is generating that\npower, there's also the possibility that Enron will come\nin and supplant Duke Power.\nMR. MALONE: That's correct.\nQUESTION: That's your argument.\nMR. MALONE: Yes.\nQUESTION: Okay. I understand it.\nQUESTION: Mr. Malone, it would seem to -- is\nthat -- you're done?\nMR. MALONE: I just wanted to add, Justice\nBreyer, that if you look at 206(d), that calls on FERC to\nprovide costs in your hypothetical from West Virginia to\nthe North Carolina --\nQUESTION: Then I would say if that's your\nargument, the response to that argument will be this is an\nunforeseen case in '35, the possibility of Enron\nsupplanting Duke, and it's close enough to wholesale\nsales.\nMR. MALONE: If Enron supplants Duke and sells\ndirectly to a retail customer, it's going to be purchasing\nelectricity, selling retail, over a delivery system that\nEnron does not own. It's our -- it's our position that we\nregulate the rates for the delivery system.\nWe have here a case where FERC is admitting to\nthe Court that the sine qua non of preemption was not\ncontemplated by the '35 Congress. If Congress did not\ncontemplate the trigger point for preemption, it could not\nhave contemplated the preemption itself. So, the issue\nbefore the Court is, can the Federal Government displace\nthe laws of 50 States that have required us to regulate\nall aspects of retail service for 90 years when -- when it\nis conceding that Congress did not intend its action?\nQUESTION: May I ask you one question --\nQUESTION: Mr. Malone.\nQUESTION: -- about the words in the statute?\nThe statute uses an and. It says that -- that on the\nFederal side, there's authority over two things, and one\nis transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce\n-- that's one thing -- and the sale of such energy at\nwholesale in interstate commerce. Both (a) and (b) use\nthe and. But I take it from your argument that you're\nsaying the transmission has to be read as linked to the\nsale as wholesale, that they're not discrete pieces.\nMR. MALONE: Not quite, Your Honor. If you have\n-- if we go back to Justice Breyer's hypothetical and we\nhave company A in West Virginia which is selling to\ncompany C in North Carolina with an intermittent carrier\nby a transmission line, we would concede that FERC would\nhave jurisdiction over the transmission, even though\ncompany B is not taking title and is simply carrying. And\nthat was intended by Congress and that's why it did not\nlink the transmission and the sale. In other words, the\ntransmitter does not have to be selling the energy.\nEither way, FERC has jurisdiction.\nQUESTION: Mr. Malone --\nMR. MALONE: But it should be a wholesale\ntransaction.\nQUESTION: -- could I come back to Justice\nGinsburg's earlier question which focused on section\n824(b)(2), which says that the provisions shall not apply\nto any other sale of electric energy. And her question\nfocused on the fact that it just says, sale of electric\nenergy, and doesn't say, sale of transmission.\nNow, it seems to me your response to that -- if\nI were making the response, at least, I would have said\nthat if -- if sale of electric energy in (b)(2) is so\nnarrow that it just means the commodity and not the -- the\ntransmission and the servicing and -- and the metering and\neverything else, if it is that narrow in (2), it would\nalso be that narrow in (1). And -- and (1) gives -- gives\nFERC authority over the sale of electric energy at\nwholesale. And I -- I assume that that authority over the\nsale at wholesale includes authority over the price of the\ncommodity, the price of the transmission, the price of\neverything else.\nSo, if you're going to give it an expansive\nreading in (1), it seems to me you have to give it an\nexpansive reading in (2). And just as FERC has authority\nover the whole sale at wholesale, so -- so the States have\nauthority over the whole sale at retail.\nMR. MALONE: Including the transmission.\nQUESTION: Including the transmission.\nMR. MALONE: Your Honor, I think that is a valid\nreading of the statute.\nCan I just take a quick minute and explain why\nwe care so much about this?\nQUESTION: It's up to you.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MALONE: Your Honor, we have situations in\nNew York State, for example, where we have -- FERC has\nregulated curtailments over transmission systems. That\ninvolves which customers stay in the light and which\ncustomers go into the dark. When we have a decision to\nmake in New York, over the last 30 years that I've been\ninvolved in this, we're going to look to try to minimize\nthe number of people who go into the dark. That's number\none. Number two, we're going to protect critical\ncustomers: hospitals, prisons, people on life support\nsystems. We're on the ground and we're there to protect\nretail customers.\nWhen FERC preempts us on curtailment in this\ncase, it -- it says that curtailment under that situation\nhas -- has to be nondiscriminatory. It sounds wonderful,\nand it's consistent with our economic plan. But it has to\ngive way to critical care customers and keeping the most\npeople in the light that you possibly can.\nThis is an example of where an agency has\noverstepped its bounds. It's moved into retail\nregulation, conceding that Congress didn't intend it.\nThere's a Federal/State balance that this Court has\nprotected, absent clear evidence from Congress that it\nshould change. And here that balance has changed and it's\ncreating difficulties. We now have two hands on the\nretail wheel, and it doesn't work.\nIf there are no further questions, I'd like to\nreserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Malone.\nMr. Cohen, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS R. COHEN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN NO. 00-809\nMR. COHEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nFERC's open access transmission tariff is\nconcerned with usage of the interstate transmission grid,\nsomething that only FERC can effectively regulate. The\nOATT does require that interstate transmission rates be\npublished and be proportional to usage, but its major\nconcern, as Pennsylvania's amicus brief says more\neloquently than we did, is rules of the road, access,\nusage priorities, classes of service, reservation and\nscheduling of service, access to real-time information\nabout the system, pro rata curtailment in periods of\nconstraint, and similar matters that the States don't and\ncan't regulate.\nFERC found endemic, undue discrimination in the\nprovision of interstate transmission service by the\ntraditional utilities that collectively own most of the\ngrid. But FERC did not comply with the statutory command\nto cure that discrimination. FERC imposed the OATT but\nsaid it had no jurisdiction to apply it to transmissions\nthat are bundled with retail energy sales, and thus\nexempted about 60 percent of the traffic from the rules of\nthe road.\nQUESTION: Did it say it had no jurisdiction or\njust chose, in its discretion, not to regulate them?\nMR. COHEN: It said that the transmissions\nshould not be considered within the interstate\ntransmission clause giving FERC jurisdiction over\ninterstate transmissions, but rather, in the case of\ntransmissions bundled with retail sales, should be\nconsidered part of the bundled retail sale.\nThe D.C. Circuit then said --\nQUESTION: Which means what? Which means that\nit doesn't have jurisdiction. When you say should be\nconsidered part of, you mean discretionarily should be\nconsidered or must be --\nMR. COHEN: Well, the D.C. Circuit called it a\npermissible policy choice, and -- but --\nQUESTION: And you agree with that? You agree\nit was a policy choice and not a jurisdiction --\nMR. COHEN: I think FERC made a jurisdictional\nmistake and I think the D.C. Circuit --\nQUESTION: It misconstrued its statute.\nMR. COHEN: It misconstrued its statute.\nQUESTION: It didn't simply withdraw its hand.\nIt misconstrued the act.\nMR. COHEN: Yes, yes. And we are -- we are\nasking the Court to tell FERC that it did have\njurisdiction over that large portion of the\ntransmission --\nQUESTION: In your view --\nMR. COHEN: -- and that it should, therefore,\nsolve the problem that it found.\nQUESTION: In your view, if FERC does have\njurisdiction of this -- this part of the problem, must it\nexercise that jurisdiction or can it allow the States to\nregulate?\nMR. COHEN: What it must do under section 206,\nwhich is section 824(e), is cure the undue discrimination\nthat it found. I think FERC does have, would have a good\ndeal of discretion to decide how to do that.\nQUESTION: Well, then it's pretty much a Pyrrhic\nvictory for you if you persuade us that the CADC was wrong\nin saying it was just a policy choice, it was a\njurisdictional decision. It goes back to them and they\nsay, well, so we have jurisdiction, we're choosing not to\nexercise it.\nMR. COHEN: I'm hoping that what I had was a\nPyrrhic defeat in the -- in the D.C. Circuit and that --\nand that FERC, once told that it has jurisdiction, and\nhaving recognized that it has the obligation to cure undue\ndiscrimination, will exercise that jurisdiction properly.\nBecause this -- this is a problem that only FERC can\nsolve.\nQUESTION: We usually have cases in which the\nagency is alleged to go too far. What case do you cite\nthat we could look to for a model where the agency goes\nnot far enough and we have to push them?\nMR. COHEN: Well, actually in the Louisiana\nPower & Light case, which we cite and think is very much\nin point here, which arises under the same parallel\nprovisions of the Natural Gas Act, FERC's initial position\nwas that it -- I believe FERC's initial position was that\nit did not have jurisdiction to regulate bundled direct\nretail sales of -- of gas and that that included a lack of\njurisdiction over the transportation of that gas. And --\nand this Court said, yes, you do.\nQUESTION: I guess what would -- suppose FERC\nsays or suppose I read it as saying, since you're\nwhipsawing them between you and New York, look, in 1935\nyours is the case where Congress would have never dreamt\nthey had jurisdiction. Theirs is the case that's somewhat\nambiguous. I take it that's their reply. Theirs is the\nnew legal animal, the new factual animal. Yours is the\nold one. Yours is the situation I described in the\nhypothetical.\nMR. COHEN: What happened in 1935 was that,\nrecognizing that interconnection was coming, Congress\ngranted FERC jurisdiction over transportation of electric\nenergy in interstate commerce without limitation. It is\nonly more recently -- really only in the 1990's -- that\ncompetition for the use of the interstate grid, which is\nwhat we're -- what we're about here, has arisen and has\nbecome a problem.\nQUESTION: It gave them, without limitation,\nauthority over transportation of energy, but not without\nlimitation authority over sale of energy. Your argument,\nlike I'm sure the Government's which will follow, assumes\nthat the -- the power to regulate the transmission\nincludes the power to regulate the sale.\nMR. COHEN: No.\nQUESTION: Isn't that an essential part of your\nargument?\nMR. COHEN: No. We --\nQUESTION: Well, where does it -- where does\nit --\nMR. COHEN: We think that the States have\nplenary power to regulate who may serve their retail\ncustomers and at what rates and at what -- and on what\nother terms and conditions. But they must take into\naccount FERC's -- and properly respect FERC's regulation\nof the -- the item that is within FERC's jurisdiction,\nnamely transmission.\nAnd this is a parallel to the Nantahala case\nwhere this Court said --\nQUESTION: What do you mean take into account?\nI thought you're saying that -- that FERC has the power to\ndetermine a -- a component of the retail sale.\nMR. COHEN: It has the power to determine the --\nthe cost of -- of transmission of electricity insofar as\nthat -- and that may be one of the costs that the retail\nutility incurs for which the retail utility has the right\nunder State law to recover. That's just like the\nwholesaling cost. FERC is no more -- is no more\nregulating the retail transaction when it regulates the --\nQUESTION: That's right.\nMR. COHEN: -- the transmission --\nQUESTION: But it has authority to regulate the\n-- the wholesale sale. It does not have authority to\nregulate the retail sale.\nMR. COHEN: But it has authority to regulate\ntransmission, and what I'm saying is --\nQUESTION: But transmission by the statute, as I\nread it, is separated from sale. It says, the provisions\nshall apply to the transmission of --\nQUESTION: Where are you reading from?\nQUESTION: I'm reading from (b)(1). Shall apply\nto the transmission of -- section 824(b)(1). I don't know\nwhat -- at (2), whatever it is in the -- in the --\nMR. COHEN: It's 824 --\nQUESTION: 16 U.S.C. 824(b)(1).\nMR. COHEN: Yes.\nQUESTION: The provisions of this chapter shall\napply to the transmission of electric energy in interstate\ncommerce. And it does not then say, including the sale of\nelectric energy at wholesale. It doesn't say, including\nthe sale. It says, shall apply to the transmission in\ninterstate commerce and to the sale of electric energy at\nwholesale -- at wholesale -- in interstate commerce,\ndrawing a dichotomy between transmission and sale. And\nwhat the State is saying here is the only sale you're\ngiven authority over is the wholesale and -- and not --\nnot the retail sale.\nMR. COHEN: And we have stressed -- whereas the\n-- the nine States have tried to blur this distinction, we\nhave stressed the distinction between FERC's jurisdiction\nover transmission and FERC's jurisdiction over wholesale\nsales.\nLet me put it this way. The State regulates\nretail sales. A retail seller has two costs. It may have\nmore, but two of its costs are the cost of power, which it\nmay buy at wholesale, and the cost of transmission of\npower, which it incurs in order to make a retail sale.\nBoth of those two things are regulated by the -- by the\nFederal Government, by -- by FERC.\nAnd just as this Court has squarely held that\nthe -- that FERC's jurisdiction over the cost of wholesale\nsales is -- is -- does not encroach upon the States'\nretail sale authority, but it is something that the States\nmust respect in setting retail rates, so FERC's regulation\nof the cost of transmission.\nQUESTION: But FERC's regulation of the cost of\n-- of interstate transmission at wholesale comes about not\nbecause of its authority over the transmission of -- of\nelectric energy, but because of its authority over the\nsale of electric energy at wholesale. It can fix those\nwholesale prices, and once it does, the States have to\ntake that --\nQUESTION: That's the point of your\ndisagreement.\nMR. COHEN: Yes. I don't -- I don't agree with\nthat.\nQUESTION: That's the issue, isn't it?\nMR. COHEN: Yes. That -- that is the\nstatutory --\nQUESTION: Yes. The statute says, shall apply\nto transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce.\nAnd you take that as a separate grant.\nQUESTION: And it says and.\nQUESTION: And -- and, two, the sale of electric\nenergy at wholesale in interstate commerce, which you take\nto be a second grant of authority.\nMR. COHEN: Yes, and the basic --\nQUESTION: Not linked together.\nMR. COHEN: The basic structure of our argument\nis that just as your opinion for the Court, Justice\nO'Connor, explained in Nantahala, that the States must\ntake into account the wholesale cost of energy, so the\nStates can be required to -- to take into account FERC's\nregulation of transmission --\nQUESTION: What difference does it make whether\nthe transmission component is bundled or unbundled at\nretail sale?\nMR. COHEN: We don't think it should make any\nbecause transmissions, whether for wholesale or retail,\nwhether bundled or unbundled, compete for use of the\ninterstate grid. And what we are really about here isn't\neven rates in any important way. It is competition for\nthe use of the grid.\nQUESTION: Can you sell at retail in States\nwhich are -- which are bundled?\nMR. COHEN: Absolutely not. What we want --\nQUESTION: Well, then why -- then why is there\n-- then why is there a problem?\nMR. COHEN: Because what we want the right to do\nis to use the transmission system through those States\nwithout the retail -- the traditional monopoly utility\nthat owns the facilities in those States being able to hog\nthose facilities for its own use and keep us off the road.\nLet me -- let me try an example.\nQUESTION: In other words, even though you're\nnot trying to reach retail --\nMR. COHEN: Even though we're not trying to\nreach retail customers, we may be trying to sell energy to\nthe utility in -- in Wisconsin. I'm taking this example\npartly from the Eighth Circuit's decision in the NSP case,\nwhich is in our briefs. We're trying to sell energy to\nthe utility at wholesale in Wisconsin. To do that, we\nhave to transmit through Minnesota. The traditional --\nQUESTION: Well, then that -- then that\nwholesale sale can be regulated.\nMR. COHEN: The wholesale sale can be regulated,\nbut the traditional utility in Minnesota, which owns the\nfacilities and mostly makes bundled retail sales to its\ncustomers in Minnesota, can say, our bundled retail sales\nare not subject to FERC's OATT. We can schedule\ntransmissions an hour before we want to send them, but\nyour transmissions through to Wisconsin need 2 days.\nQUESTION: I'm very surprised that FERC is\nsaying that they have no jurisdiction over that. You\nwould have thought that if you are in State A and you are\nselling to a different, say, retailer in State C, the\ntransmission from A to C is certainly a transmission that\nfalls within the classical notion of this statute, isn't\nit? And if B puts something up on those lines that\nblocks the transmission, I'm very surprised that FERC\nwould say they don't have jurisdiction to stop that.\nMR. COHEN: Well, we were a little surprised\ntoo.\nQUESTION: But that's what this case is about in\nyour view.\nMR. COHEN: From our -- from our standpoint,\nthat's what our side of this case is about. And it's\nexactly what the Eighth Circuit said in the NSP case.\nThey said --\nQUESTION: That -- that would be an interference\nwith the transmission, not with the sale. I mean, sure,\nthey'd have authority over that because they have\nauthority over transmission, both interstate and\nintrastate.\nMR. COHEN: All that I'm asking the Court to say\nis that FERC has the ability to -- the jurisdiction to\napply its general open access transmission tariff not only\nto our sales at wholesale and to -- but -- but also to the\nbundled retail sales that compete with us for use of -- of\nthe transmission grid.\nQUESTION: Well, if the -- FERC can regulate\nyour transmissions and you go to FERC and say, you know,\nour transmissions are being blocked, why can't they say,\nwe will exercise jurisdiction over your transmission and\nwe will unblock you?\nMR. COHEN: Justice Kennedy, the answer to that\nis, first of all, that it's -- it's not just blockage. It\ncan be more complicated than that.\nBut -- but second of all, FERC actually said in\nOrder 888 we need to impose the OATT because doing this on\na case-by-case basis doesn't work. If you're going to\nhave an interstate highway system in which the traffic is\npresent simultaneously, instantaneously in all parts of\nthe system, you need a set of rules of the road that apply\nto everybody. You can't just say, weeks or months later,\nwe found that somebody -- that somebody improperly blocked\nsomebody else's through transmission.\nQUESTION: But I -- I thought you wanted the\nparticular reg -- there's a particular reg that New York\nhas been talking about, and I thought you wanted that\napplied to the bundled sales as well.\nMR. COHEN: Particular regulation.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. COHEN: Yes.\nQUESTION: And -- and that seems to me a\ndifferent issue than somebody climbing up a pole, for\nexample, and cutting the wire so that you can't get your\nelectricity between State A and State C.\nMR. COHEN: Well, the ideal example is the\ncurtailment example. What happens when there is a\nconstraint such that the system can't carry all the would-\nbe transmission? The OATT says there shall be a\ncomplicated formula pro rata curtailment of different\nuses.\nThe Eighth Circuit said in the NSP case, because\nFERC had no -- had said it had no jurisdiction over\nbundled retail sales, they don't get prorated. Our\ntransmissions through Minnesota to Wisconsin get cut back\nso that our service to the -- to the homeowners and -- or\nthrough the utility that serves the homeowners and\nhospitals in Wisconsin gets cut back so that the utility\nin Minnesota can provide full service to its retail\ncustomers.\nQUESTION: You want the Federal Government to\ndetermine which -- which will be the emergency users and\nthe preferred users in each State and locality. You want\nthat decided in Washington.\nMR. COHEN: We want the Federal Government to\nregulate the transmission of electric energy in interstate\ncommerce, and that has become a more complicated problem\nthan it was in 1935. There is new competition for those\nfacilities. Transmission has itself become a product, but\nwe think both the jurisdiction to regulate and the\nobligation to cure a discrimination have been in the\nstatute since -- since that time.\nQUESTION: There's always been a product. It's\nnow a separately sold product, but it's always been part\n-- in fact, it used to be even a greater percentage, I\nthink, of the cost of the electricity.\nMR. COHEN: Yes. I -- I'm told --\nQUESTION: It's a lesser percentage now than it\nused to be.\nMR. COHEN: -- on average it's now about -- it's\nnow about 10 percent. But there has not been --\nQUESTION: I don't know about you, but when I\nlook at my utility rate, it's a very small amount for\ntransmission and a substantially larger amount for the\nenergy.\nMR. COHEN: It is. It's a small fraction of the\ncost, which is one of the reasons why this case isn't\nprimarily about rates. The OATT, which is in the joint\nappendix, starts -- it runs about 110 pages. And two-\nand-a-half of those pages talk about rates and say that\nyou must publish a transmission rate and that it shall be\nessentially proportional to usage.\nBut what we're concerned about here is getting\non the system, being able to schedule your transmissions.\nQUESTION: I don't even see how this works. I\nmean, it isn't like water. I mean, you get on the system,\nyou get on the system, and they have these people\nunderground who pull levers and so forth. The electricity\nflows according to some scientific way. It's not like\nputting water through a dam. So, I don't even know how\nthis works, this blocking scheduling business.\nMR. COHEN: Well, in order to have the -- the\nelectricity flows -- the power flows generally over the\nsystem, but -- but in order to have the right to turn on\n-- to ramp up your generator to produce some additional\nelectricity which your customer -- at a time when your\ncustomer is going to take electricity off the system at\nsome other point, you need to have a contractual\narrangement or other right to do that.\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Cohen.\nMr. Kneedler, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. KNEEDLER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nOrder 888 fully respects and, indeed,\ncomplements State regulatory jurisdiction over the\ntransmission -- excuse me -- over the sale of electric\nenergy. Some States have chosen to maintain the\ntraditional monopoly system for the delivery of power to\nretail customers. In that situation, there is no separate\ntransmission service, and the customer pays a single rate\nthat includes all of the utility's costs, basically\ncalculated by that utility and regulated by the State, for\nthe generation, the transmission, and the distribution of\npower to the local customer. Order 888 does not affect\nthose traditional monopoly arrangements.\nOther States, however -- now about half the\nStates -- have decided to take a different path, which is\nto separate out the transmission service and -- and\nintroduce competition in the purchase of electric power at\nretail. In that system, the retail customer has the right\nto purchase the power not simply from the utility that\npreviously had the monopoly control, but from a broad\nvariety of utilities. In that situation, that power might\nhave to be generated, purchased and transmitted from out\nof State or in State by another utility. In that\nsituation, it is necessary for there to be access to the\ntransmission facilities to move the power from the\ngeneration place to the place of -- of retail delivery.\nIn that situation, there is now a new transmission service\nthat did not exist in 1935 when the Federal Power Act was\npassed.\nQUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, if -- if I understand\nit correctly, it is -- the position of the agency hinges\non the proposition that the power conferred by -- by\nsection 824 to regulate the transmission of electrical\nenergy includes -- includes the power to regulate the sale\nof the transmission of electrical energy. Isn't that\nwhat --\nMR. KNEEDLER: The sale -- the sale of the\ntransmission, yes.\nQUESTION: The sale of the transmission.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But what it does not -- what it\ndoes not include is the retail sale.\nQUESTION: Now, if that were true, it seems to\nme that 824(b)(1), instead of reading the way it does,\nshould read this way: The provisions of this subchapter\nshall apply to the transmission of electric energy in\ninterstate commerce -- which would include the sale of\nthat transmission, right? -- and to the sale of the\ncommodity portion of electrical energy at wholesale in\ninterstate commerce. Because you wouldn't need the second\nhalf to cover the sale of the transmission component.\nYou're saying the sale of the transmission component is\ncovered by the first half of the -- of the sentence, shall\napply to the transmission of electrical energy.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well --\nQUESTION: And -- but -- so, it should have gone\non to say, and to the sale of the -- of the commodity at\nwholesale in interstate commerce.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But -- but that is what it says I\nbelieve because electric energy is the commodity. And the\ntransmission -- it's the transmission of the commodity, to\nuse your words, or the wholesale interstate commerce of\nthe commodity. In both cases, the electric energy is the\ncommodity.\nAnd what FERC can regulate is two different\nthings. As Justice O'Connor pointed out, these are two\nseparate and independent grants of jurisdiction to FERC.\nOne is wholesale sales of -- of the commodity, and the\nother is the transmission of the commodity.\nNow, it's true in this case, this case turns\nprimarily on rights of access, physical access, to the\ntransmission capacity. But a necessary part of regulating\naccess is also regulating the rates because different\nqualities of -- of access, rights of access -- you could\nhave firm or non-firm power. Those different rights of\naccess necessarily would -- would cost more or less. A\nutility would charge more for -- for a firm power than --\nthan non-firm power. And that -- so, in that situation,\nthe rates being charged for the access are essentially\ninseparable from setting the rules of the road.\nSo, it seems to us not -- not feasible as a\npractical matter and not textually the natural reading of\nthe act to say that somehow FERC does not have authority\nto regulate the costs -- or excuse me -- the price on\nwhich interstate transmission will be sold.\nAnd I think it was Justice Ginsburg also pointed\nout that the clause of the statute that saves power to the\n-- authority to the State says that the provisions of this\nsubchapter affirmatively grant the power to FERC --\nQUESTION: Where are you reading from?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I'm sorry. This is (b)(1) on\npage 2 of New York's brief.\nQUESTION: (B)(1)?\nMR. KNEEDLER: (B)(1), yes.\nIt says, but except as provided in paragraph\n(2), shall not apply to any other sale of electric energy.\nIt does not say, does not apply to the transmission or the\nsale of transmission or matters having to do with\ntransmission.\nAnd it's also important in --\nQUESTION: And you think that -- that sale of\nelectric energy at wholesale in -- in the first portion of\nit, in -- in (1), only referred to the sale of --\nregulating the sale of the commodity at wholesale.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, yes, but -- but for\nexample, in setting a wholesale cost -- or excuse me -- a\nwholesale rate, FERC could take into account the costs of\ntransmission --\nQUESTION: Because --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- in setting a wholesale rate,\njust as the State could.\nQUESTION: Because of its authority over the\ntransmission of energy.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Either one. It has authority\nover the transmission. But that's -- what I just said is\nparallel to the way it would work for the State. The\nState, in setting a retail rate -- as Mr. Cohen explained,\nthe State in setting a retail rate, would have to take\ninto account all of the costs that are components of that\nretail rate. That could be the cost of the electric\nenergy, the commodity, and it would also include,\nimportantly, the cost of the transmission service.\nQUESTION: I think that's a very unrealistic\nreading of what Congress thought it was doing when it\nwrote this thing, that when it -- when it spoke of the\nsale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate\ncommerce, it had in mind only -- only the sale of the --\nthe commodity and not the sale of, you know, the\ntransmission and the entire cost. I think they were\nsaying FERC can regulate wholesale rates.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, absolutely. And I didn't\nmean to say anything else. All I'm -- all I'm saying is\nthat as part of -- one component of the wholesale rates\nincludes the cost of transmitting the electric energy at\nwholesale. So, if it is setting a -- a wholesale rate, it\nhas to include that as part of it.\nQUESTION: But you can't say that because if you\nsay that that -- that the reason you have that authority\nis because of the phrase, the sale of electric energy at\nwholesale, you would also have to say in the very next\nphrase, the sale of electric energy -- any other sale of\nelectric energy, sale at retail, would also include the\ntransmission component. You'd have to exclude the\ntransmission component from both of them.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. If I could -- if I could\nanswer that. First of all, quite aside from whether it --\nit -- FERC would have the power under the wholesale sales\nclause, it would unquestionably, we think, have the power\nunder the transmission clause, which I said is a -- is\na --\nQUESTION: I don't think that's unquestionable\nat all.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But -- well, it's -- it's an\nindependent grant of authority. And -- and for FERC's\nauthority in this area to be complete, especially in these\ndays of interconnected grids, it's -- it's necessary that\n-- that FERC have the ability to regulate all aspects of\naccess to the grid, which as I said, is not just technical\nproblems of scheduling but also what the costs of\ndifferent -- different quality of access to the grid will\nbe.\nBut the other point I wanted to make -- and this\n-- this ties in, I think, to a -- a misconception of\nAttleboro and Pennsylvania Gas, which is the background\nagainst which Congress acted, that I -- that I would like\nto address here.\nStates, in setting retail rates, have the\nauthority -- and I was saying this before -- have the\nauthority to take into account all of the costs that the\nutilities serving retail customers may incur. And in the\nmonopoly situation, the -- the State will regulate the --\nwill take into account the generation costs, the\ntransmission costs, and the -- and the retail delivery\ncosts and come up with a rate.\nAnd in -- in the Pennsylvania Gas case, this\nCourt held that a State, consistent with the Interstate\nCommerce Clause, could regulate the retail rates of\nnatural gas that were -- that were paid by retail\ncustomers at the end line of the distribution system for\nthe cost of natural gas. And the Court rejected the\nargument that because that gas had moved interstate, that\nthe State had no power to regulate the delivery to the\nretail customer.\nBut in so holding, the Court didn't say that the\nStates could regulate interstate commerce. What they said\nwas that the States could regulate the local distribution,\neven though it had an incidental effect on interstate\ncommerce. So, the rates that were left to the States,\nunder Attleboro and under Pennsylvania Gas, were the\nability to actually regulate the rates that the local\nutility is going to charge to the local customer, but it\n-- the Court did not say that the States had affirmative\nauthority to directly regulate the interstate transmission\nitself.\nQUESTION: Well, suppose you have -- have a\ncondition, as described by counsel for Enron, and they\nsay, we just can't transmit our gas through this State.\nDo you have jurisdiction to exercise -- does the\ncommission have jurisdiction to exercise if it chooses to\ndo so?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Absolutely. We think that\nFERC's --\nQUESTION: So, this is just discretionary -- a\ndiscretionary choice.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, there are two different\nthings, and I think it was maybe you who put the question.\nThere's -- or maybe Justice Breyer. What Enron is seeking\nhere is to have an existing regulation on open access, all\ncomers, anytime, anywhere to -- for retail -- excuse me --\nto have a -- a pricing provision under an open access\nregime applied to the -- the transmission component even\nin the monopoly State. That -- that is -- that would be a\nsignificant change in the way that retail rates for\nbundled sales have been handled.\nQUESTION: Well, it might. He's seeking a\nnumber of different things. But the first thing he's\nseeking is an acknowledgement that you do have\njurisdiction to exercise if you choose to do it.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right. And -- and as --\nQUESTION: Do you concede that you have that?\nMR. KNEEDLER: We don't just concede, we\naffirmatively assert that we do have authority. And --\nand, for example, in the Northern States --\nQUESTION: So, then this isn't a jurisdiction\ncase.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Not in that respect, no, because\nI think that all -- with respect to this order --\nQUESTION: And so you would have no objection to\nour saying -- and I don't know quite how we'd say it, but\nthe FCC has jurisdiction over transmissions of bundled\nsales at retail.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, let me -- let me just\nmodify that in one respect. What Enron was seeking here\nwas essentially to have FERC regulate the transmission\ncomponent of a retail sale while it remained bundled.\nFERC did not disclaim the authority in an appropriate case\nto order the unbundling of -- of that service --\nQUESTION: Well, that's just a two-step -- you\nsay, first, unbundle, and now that you've unbundled, we're\ngoing to regulate it.\nMR. KNEEDLER: And the court of -- and what the\n-- the court of appeals analysis in this case essentially\nlooked at the -- at the transaction --\nQUESTION: If we can get back to my question.\nThat means that you do have jurisdiction to reach this\nproblem and to regulate transmissions.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. And in the -- in the\nNorthern States Power case, that is discussed in the -- in\nthe briefs, it -- it addresses the question of\ncurtailment. Under the open access tariffs, a -- a\nutility is required to curtail all service in a\nnondiscriminatory manner. And in -- in FERC's view that\nmeant that a -- a utility having control over transmission\ncapacity had -- would have had to curtail all service --\nall transmission for retail on a nondiscriminatory basis.\nAnd that --\nQUESTION: Well, if jurisdiction is thought of\nin constitutional terms, the answer is pretty clear. You\nhave jurisdiction. If it's thought of in statutory terms,\ndo you have statutory jurisdiction to order the\nunbundling?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I believe FERC does.\nQUESTION: To order unbundling.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I believe FERC does. I mean,\nthat's essentially what FERC ultimately did in the natural\ngas area.\nQUESTION: But aren't -- aren't you --\nMR. KNEEDLER: But -- but let me be clear. That\nwould be a -- that would be a -- a major change in the way\nthat utility regulation has happened. And what -- what\nFERC has done is leave to the States the decision as to\nwhether to maintain the traditional --\nQUESTION: What FERC has --\nQUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, I'm really puzzled\nbecause I -- I must have misread the papers. I thought\nthat the position of the FERC, at the agency level and the\ncourt of appeals, was that it did not have jurisdiction to\ntake the action that Enron wants it to take.\nMR. KNEEDLER: To order -- to order unbundling.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. KNEEDLER: That -- that may well have been\nan implicit understanding of FERC, but if you look at the\norder, it actually never says that.\nAnd the court of appeals opinion, in affirming\nthe -- the FERC order, simply says that it -- that FERC's\ncharacterization of a bundled transaction is within the --\nthe realm of its discretion. What the court of appeals\nsaid is you could look at the bundled transaction as being\nprimarily a -- a retail sale, and that has traditionally\nbeen subject to State regulation. Or you could look at it\nas including that -- the transmission component, and that\nwould be subject to FERC regulation. But FERC made a --\nFERC made a permissible --\nQUESTION: So, the position of the Government\nis, in respect to Enron's case, not New York's, Enron is\nright. FERC does have jurisdiction, but FERC, in\nexercising that jurisdiction, could say, we do not wish to\nexercise it. And that's what happened here.\nMR. KNEEDLER: The commission in this --\nQUESTION: Is that -- is that your position or\nnot?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I cannot speak for FERC on that\nquestion because FERC did not address that in this order.\nAll FERC said was it was not going to order the\nunbundling, and -- and all it was doing was -- was\nregulating the transmission component where there is\nunbundling.\nQUESTION: But I want to know what -- I have an\nargument in some briefs made by Enron, and perhaps I\nmisread them and I'll go back to them. But I thought\nEnron was saying the error that FERC made and the\nGovernment in this case is that FERC denied it had\njurisdiction to give us the order we'd like them to give.\nNow, I read that, I think, in their briefs.\nTherefore, I want to know what does the\nGovernment say about that. And what I hear you saying is\nthey are right in claiming that FERC had jurisdiction, but\nthey are wrong if they say that FERC had to exercise it.\nNow, that's what I would like to know, just what the\nposition is.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, there are really two points\nabout FERC's power here -- authority here that I would --\nwould like to separate. One is the -- the power -- the\nauthority of the sort Justice Kennedy was asking, where --\nwhere a utility is -- is reserving its load for bundled\nretail in a way that frustrates the ability of someone\nlike Enron to pass through its power to another State.\nThat would -- that would be, in effect, imposing an\nobstacle, like cutting the line, that is frustrating the\nability of FERC to regulate the -- the aspects of\ntransmission that New York, I think, concedes that FERC\nhas. I think in that situation -- and that's like the\nLouisiana Power & Gas case. I think in that situation,\nFERC unquestionably has the authority to prevent any --\nQUESTION: Whether they have the authority --\nhow do I answer this question from your question\npresented? Number 2, in 00-809, the question presented is\nwhether the court of appeals properly deferred to the\ncommission's determination that it lacks jurisdiction over\nretail transmission service that is sold together with\nelectric energy in a single bundled transaction, et\ncetera.\nNow, I have to answer that question. Do I\nanswer that question yes or no, that it did properly defer\nor that it did not properly defer?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It did properly defer because the\npredicate is that there is a single transaction. The --\nthe transmission service has not been separated out of the\none bundled transaction.\nQUESTION: Okay. Are you -- are you saying that\n-- are you drawing this line? You're saying that FERC has\nthe authority to order unbundling. No question.\nJurisdiction, constitutional and statutory, to do that.\nAre you also saying that if FERC chooses not to\norder unbundling, it has no jurisdiction to regulate the\ntransmission that is a component of the ultimate unbundled\ncost? Is that where you're drawing the line?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. That -- and that -- that is\nI think all that FERC said.\nI would like to modify the first point, which is\nI am not -- I'm not affirmatively asserting at this point\nthat FERC has the jurisdiction to order unbundling. I\ndon't see anything in the act that prevents it, and under\nthe --\nQUESTION: So, you're saying that you see\nnothing in the act that would prevent FERC from doing just\nwhat Mr. Cohen wants it to do so long as it takes two\nsteps, so long as it orders unbundling first. That's the\ndifference, I think, between you and Enron. Is that\ncorrect?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Assuming that FERC has this\nauthority. As I stated, it didn't disclaim it, but FERC\nin this order did not -- did not stress that.\nQUESTION: Right. But you're assuming they have\nauthority. You see no reason --\nMR. KNEEDLER: I'm -- I see nothing in the act,\nin the parallel provisions of the Natural Gas Act --\nQUESTION: Well, again, referring to the\nquestion presented that you drafted, question 2, the\nquestion presented is whether the court of appeals\nproperly deferred to the commission's determination that\nit lacks jurisdiction over retail transmission. And you\nwant us to say yes.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But the rest of the question is:\nwhen it is sold together with electric energy in a single\nbundled transaction. And that is -- and that is the\ntransaction. That is the transaction that --\nQUESTION: And you want us to say yes, it lacks\njurisdiction.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes.\nQUESTION: In that circumstance.\nMR. KNEEDLER: In that circumstance.\nQUESTION: Therefore, when Mr. Cohen put the\nexample that he did of a grid, and the grid covers several\nStates, and there are many sales for wholesale between --\nsales for resale between A and C and D and F, but there's\none in the middle, C, where it in fact is all bundled.\nAnd they all -- you know, it's a big grid. It goes\neverywhere. And if in fact they are scheduling\ndeliveries, the State commission, in that C so that the\nwrong people are getting the energy and so that the\nwholesale -- the sales for resale in A, E, and F are all\nmucked up, the answer is, of course, the commission has\njurisdiction to deal with that situation.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes.\nQUESTION: Of course.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Even -- even under Order 888 --\nwhat Order 888 does is decline to extend the plenary rate\n-- the plenary jurisdiction of Order 888 itself over the\ntransmission component of bundled sales.\nQUESTION: So, the sole thing it doesn't have\njurisdiction over, in your opinion, is to make this kind\nof nondiscriminatory order applicable in our middle State\nC where the transactions are all run from generating to\ndistribution to transmission, everything is run by one\ncompany, PG&E.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right.\nQUESTION: It doesn't have jurisdiction over\nthat.\nMR. KNEEDLER: As long as they -- as long as\nthey are -- as long as the State hasn't unbundled it, the\nutility has not unbundled it, and FERC has not exercised\nwhatever authority it would have to unbundle it --\nQUESTION: Even though they're in the grid.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Even though they are in the grid.\nQUESTION: See, I didn't --\nMR. KNEEDLER: But -- but let me -- let me make\nclear. This does not mean -- this does not mean, with\nrespect to Justice Breyer's question, that even -- even\nthough FERC did not impose that requirement across the\nboard by imposing the -- the separate rate component\nrequirement on bundled retail transmission, if a utility\nexercises its authority in a way that disadvantages, that\ndiscriminates the matters that are within FERC's\njurisdiction, FERC can -- can act to eliminate that\ndiscrimination, which is what FERC -- the position FERC\ntook in the NSP --\nQUESTION: And your reason, as I interpret it,\nin a sentence is if we go back to 1935, even if the New\nYork situation was something they never would have dreamt\nof, the Enron situation is something that they certainly\ndid dream of. It was absolutely common, and they rejected\nit, the statute covering that.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right. The -- the statute leaves\nthe retail rates.\nBut again --\nQUESTION: Am I right? Don't say I'm right if\nI'm not.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. No, you're correct.\nBut -- but again, what -- what --\nQUESTION: Where? Where does the statute -- you\nsay the statute leaves the retail rates. What are you\nreferring to?\nMR. KNEEDLER: In the -- in the clause in 201(b)\nthat you were referring to, shall not apply to any other\nsale of electric energy. That is leaving to the States\nthe authority to set the rates for the retail sale of\nelectric energy, which is essentially what was left to\nthem under the Pennsylvania Gas case as -- as a matter of\nthe Interstate Commerce Clause.\nQUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, would you please\nclarify what FERC has no jurisdiction -- that is, no\nauthority -- Congress gave them no authority to do what\nversus what they can do or decline to do as a matter of\npolicy? As I read Judge Sentelle's portion of the per\ncuriam opinion, those two were put together, and they're\ntwo quite different things. One is a question of power.\nDoes FERC have the power to do it? One is a question of\nshould it exercise that power, the policy question. Which\nis no power and which is a matter of policy?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think what is no power is where\nthe transaction remains bundled, FERC may characterize\nthat in the same way that it has always been treated, as\n-- as a single retail rate, and that FERC cannot require,\nas long as the transaction remains bundled, that be --\nthat a separate cost component for retail transmission be\nstated.\nQUESTION: What do you mean? You say, may\ncharacterize it. You mean must characterize it.\nQUESTION: Yes. That's a crucial point.\nQUESTION: If -- if you're going to say it has\nno power, you have to say must characterize it, not may\ncharacterize it.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, but -- but I don't have to\nsay -- it depends by what you mean by must because --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- the court of appeals did not\nsay that was the only way to read the statute. The court\nof appeals said the agency could have --\nQUESTION: Well, but we want to know your --\nyour position, and it's a very odd answer to the question\nto say that we may say we may have no jurisdiction -- we\nhave no jurisdiction. I've never heard of such a thing.\nWe may say we have no jurisdiction.\nMR. KNEEDLER: This is a Chevron point. Where\nyou -- where you have a -- where you have a bundled\ntransaction, what the court of appeals said is that FERC\ncould have looked at the bundled transaction as being\nprimarily a retail sale over which the States are -- are\n-- their jurisdiction is preserved under the clause I just\nmentioned. Or FERC has plenary jurisdiction over the\ntransmission and it would be possible to look at that and\nsay that the -- that the transmission component of the\nbundled sale does come under FERC's jurisdiction.\nWhat the court of appeals said is that it was --\nand this is on page 35a of the -- of the petition\nappendix, Enron's petition appendix -- FERC's decision to\ncharacterize bundled transmissions as part of retail\nsales, subject to State jurisdiction, therefore,\nrepresents a statutorily permissible policy choice. In\nother words, it's the characterization of the bundled\nsale.\nQUESTION: If you have the power to characterize\nit one way or the other, it seems to me you have the power\nto assert jurisdiction. So, you're saying FERC has the\npower to assert jurisdiction.\nMR. KNEEDLER: As a Chevron matter, FERC has --\nhas concluded -- has construed the statute not to\nauthorize it to -- under Chevron, the -- the agency could\ngo either way.\nQUESTION: It could have done differently, and\nif it had done differently, it could move in to regulate\nit all. Right?\nMR. KNEEDLER: But -- but FERC has now construed\nthe statute, in a statutorily permissible way, that does\nnot give it jurisdiction over the transmission component\nof bundled retail sales.\nQUESTION: May I ask this question?\nQUESTION: So, FERC couldn't -- couldn't\nexercise the power on that reading unless Congress gave it\nto them.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right, as long as the transaction\nremains bundled.\nBut what we -- what we fundamentally have in 25\nStates is that 25 States have provided for the unbundling\nand created a separate transmission service, transmission\nof power in interstate commerce, which the States could\nnot have regulated in 1935. They couldn't have regulated\na separate transmission service. All they were allowed to\ndo was regulate the local retail rate, which --\nQUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, may I ask you this\nquestion? If we assume -- we assume the commission has\nsaid that they do not have jurisdiction when the\ntransaction remains bundled, because it wasn't voluntarily\nunbundled or compelled to be unbundled by State or Federal\nauthority. If we disagreed with that and said, no, you do\nhave jurisdiction there, is there anything in the statute\nthat would compel them to exercise the jurisdiction?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. I think -- I think FERC\nwould have great authority in deciding how to identify\ndiscrimination and how to deal with it.\nI wanted to mention one last point with respect\nto New York's claim -- desire to protect its -- its retail\ncustomers, and particularly those in dire needs. Nothing\n-- this tariff -- and I'd point the Court to pages 772 to\n775 of the joint appendix. Utilities are allowed to set\ncurtailment priorities under their tariffs, and therefore,\nthey could protect retail customers, they could protect\nhospitals, that sort of thing. It's just that when you\nhave curtailment, the utility has to curtail in a\nnondiscriminatory way. It can't favor its own\ntransmission at retail to hospitals and discriminate\nagainst another supplier of electric power to hospitals.\nIn other words, it has -- it can have -- it can have\npriorities based on the -- the need for the power, but it\ncan't discriminate against suppliers of the power. And\nthat is the whole point --\nQUESTION: It's all at the sufferance of FERC,\nhowever. I mean, in FERC's graciousness, it -- it allows\nthe -- the State of New York to decide who should be\nserved first, and if FERC wanted to change that and say,\nwe say these should be your priority -- right?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, there may well be\nlimitations on that because, among other things, the act\npreserves to the States the authority over local\ndistribution systems and over retail rates. The sense of\nthat, I think, is to preserve the general State police\npower over the way power is being delivered to the\nultimate customer. That's what this act was really\nleaving to the States.\nBut in any -- any event, FERC did not seek to\nupset the priorities for power --\nQUESTION: Now, if FERC has -- has determined,\nafter a hearing, that there is discrimination going on in\nthe allocation of transmission services, must it then\norder a remedy?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think if it finds\ndiscrimination, it has to order appropriate relief. It\nwouldn't necessarily be relief under Order -- Order 888.\nThere may well be other -- other measures that could be\ntaken.\nQUESTION: And are there still some intrastate\nelectric producers that also transmit their energy totally\nwithin the State and FERC has no jurisdiction over that at\nall?\nMR. KNEEDLER: The -- if they -- if a utility --\nsuch utility is connected to the grid, it cannot\ntransmit --\nQUESTION: But probably there are some that are\nnot connected to the grid.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I'm informed by FERC that there\nare virtually none anymore, and that -- that while the act\ndoes preserve intrastate transmission to the -- to the\nStates, there's virtually none that isn't connected to the\ngrid. And if it is connected to the grid, as the\ncommission said in the Florida Power case, because of the\nelectromagnetic connection of all generators and all users\nto the grid, it is -- anything put onto the grid is\nnecessarily in interstate commerce.\nSo, Congress -- the limitations Congress placed\non FERC's power come elsewhere in preserving the power\nover the ultimate retail rates and the local distribution\nto the -- to the local utilities, and -- and the State\nregulation. But the transmission, the control over that\ncritical interstate grid, is left to the Federal Energy\nRegulatory Commission.\nNow, there's also in Texas, the Texas -- a\nportion of Texas is not connected to the interstate grid,\nand that would -- that would remain --\nQUESTION: Would you say that if a State\nregulates a bundled retail sale, it is, for all practical\npurposes, in part regulating transmission?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I would say it is not regulating\ntransmission, and I -- and I think that that is what the\nCourt said in -- in Pennsylvania -- in Pennsylvania Gas.\nIt's regulating the retail sale that may have an\nincidental effect on interstate transmission, but it is\nnot directly regulating the transmission itself. And we\nthink the Commerce Clause then and the Federal Power Act\nnow wouldn't allow it.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.\nMr. Malone, you have 1 minute remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. MALONE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN NO. 00-568\nMR. MALONE: Your Honor, Justice Scalia, in\nresponse to your question as to whether FERC has given the\nauthority to the States to decide prioritization of\ncurtailment, the answer is no. The utility has sole\ndiscretion to decide that, not the State of New York.\nIt's joint appendix 350 where FERC says, in\nasserting jurisdiction over unbundled retail transmission\nin interstate commerce, the commission in no way is\nasserting jurisdiction to order retail transmission\ndirectly to an ultimate consumer. 888 directly says that\nthey cannot order retail wheeling to a consumer, and they\nare correct in that respect.\nTransmission is not a new service. It is the\nsame service that we have always seen. It is a monopoly\nservice to retail customers. Justice Kennedy, when we\nhave a bundled sale, there's no question that the State is\nregulating the transmission within that bundled sale, and\nthat's why the Northern States case held that FERC could\nnot govern curtailments in the bundled case, as it is\nattempting to do in this case in the unbundled case.\nThe FERC order is at war with itself in several\nrespects. It says that it has exclusive jurisdiction over\ntransmission and it can't delegate an iota of it. And\nyet, it turns around and says, but, States, you regulate\ncustomer complaints. That's the sort of thing that\nhappens when a Federal agency is over-reaching, rewriting\nthe law, and trying to regulate, in this case, retail\ntransactions which Congress expressly left to the States\nin 1935.\nThere's no question Congress in '35 did not\nintend FERC to do what it is doing today, which is taking\nover the relationship between 127,000 retail customers and\nthe people who deliver electricity to them.\nThank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Malone.\n"
