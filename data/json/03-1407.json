        "content": "(10:03 a.m.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We'll hear argument in the\ncase of Rousey against Jacoway.\nMs. Karlan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. KARLAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMS. KARLAN: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may\nit please the Court:\nYesterday in Koons Buick against Nigh, this\nCourt emphasized once again that statutory interpretation\nis a holistic process based on common sense, that the\nreading of the statute should look at all the words to\navoid a passing strange or an anomalous result when the\ntext does not dictate it and the statutory history\nsuggests otherwise.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That was a case I dissented in,\nwasn't it?\nMS. KARLAN: Yes, but actually, Justice Scalia,\nI think even you will find our case more appealing.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, but -- but it is true you\nhave a strong textual --\nMS. KARLAN: We have an excellent textual\nargument.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I was a little bit surprised\nat your opening because it seems to me you have a strong\ntextual argument you're now defending.\nMS. KARLAN: We do. A holistic reading of the\ntext shows that section 522(d)(10)(e) of the Bankruptcy\nCode --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What does a holistic reading\nmean? Can you stay within the --\nMS. KARLAN: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- text and still be holistic?\nMS. KARLAN: I'm not going to look outside the\ntext at all.\nA holistic reading of section 522(d)(10)(e) of\nthe Bankruptcy Code, which is on -- in the petitioners'\nbrief at pages 1 through 2 --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What does the word holistic\nmean?\n(Laughter.)\nMS. KARLAN: I think it means read all the words\nin the sense that makes the most sense to you rather than\nplucking words at random or rather than looking at a word\nartificially. For example, when you look at a phrase like\non account of in the Bankruptcy Code, as the Court did in\nNorth LaSalle, account means a lot of different things,\nbut there it clearly meant because of, as it does in this\nstatute.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So the antonym would be\nparsimonious or something like that?\nMS. KARLAN: I think it'd be partial, but I'm\nnot sure.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let -- let me ask --\nMS. KARLAN: Sure.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- ask you this. The -- the\nstatute does say that the right to receive a payment is on\naccount of age, and that seems to me to be an argument\nsomewhat in respondent's favor because the -- the payment\nhas to be triggered by the age, if you read it that way,\nand it seems to me that's a fair way to read it.\nMS. KARLAN: Yes, and I think payments are\ntriggered by age because section 522(d)(10)(e) is a\nstatute eminently about the protection in bankruptcy of\nretirement payments. For individuals --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, the problem for the\ncourt below was that the person covered can ask for it in\na lump sum and pay a penalty.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Right, and that's not --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And -- and that isn't then on\nthe basis of age. Am I right? Is that -- that was the\nproblem the court had below.\nMS. KARLAN: Yes, that's the problem the court\nhad below. I think it's an illusory problem for the\nfollowing reason.\nIt's clear that the right to receive full\nenjoyment of payments under an IRA does not attach until\none of the triggering events occurs. The trigger events\nare age 59 and a half, disability, illness, or for the\nestate, death. And that's the right that we're talking\nabout here, and that's why --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, when you say full\nenjoyment, you -- you think when -- when I'm taxed on\nsomething, I -- I don't have full enjoyment of it? The\nonly thing triggered by age, as far as I can tell -- the\nonly thing triggered by age -- is your obtaining of a tax\nbenefit. That's all. Once you reach a certain age, you\ncan withdraw it without -- without paying the 10 percent\ntax.\nMS. KARLAN: That's correct, but the 10 percent\ntax here is designed and does, in fact, operate as a\ndeterrent and a penalty.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I'm sure it does, but --\nbut it's -- it's hard to accept the notion that simply\nbecause after a certain age I get a tax benefit, I'm\nreceiving the money on account of my age. That doesn't\nmake any sense to me.\nMS. KARLAN: Well, Justice Scalia, the way that\nI would view that is prior to age 59 and a half, you pay a\npenalty. And Congress put that penalty in there because\nthe holistic sense, the full reading of section\n522(d)(10)(e) is it is designed to protect retirement\nsavings, replacement income of the elderly, the disabled,\nor ill people, once they get to the point where those\ntriggering events, which are in 522(d)(10)(e), occur.\nThose are the same triggering events --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Karlan, the -- as long as\nthis money was in the plan, it was shielded from\nbankruptcy, and there are -- there was not unlimited\naccess even with the penalty when it was in the plan. One\nthing that I don't know and may be of some significance,\ndid the Rouseys have a chance, even though they lost their\nemployment, to keep their money in the plan where it would\nbe shielded from bankruptcy or did they have to roll it\nover?\nMS. KARLAN: Northrop Grumman's policy is to\nrequire individuals who leave the company's employment to\nroll their pension plans into an IRA. The Rouseys tried\nto get work in Arkansas when they moved there. Had they\ngotten a job there that they were able to keep, which they\nwere unable to do because of their health, they could have\nrolled that money back into an undeniably, completely\nexemptible.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Another employer's plan.\nMS. KARLAN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But they could not have kept\nit in this employer's plan?\nMS. KARLAN: No. This employer did not permit\nindividuals to keep the money in the plan. They were told\nthey had to remove the money when they lost their jobs.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That was a term of the plan\nthat it -- you can remain in it only so long as you're\nemployed?\nMS. KARLAN: Apparently so.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are there any other plans that\nare -- are entities clearly covered by the statute in\nwhich the only effect of age is to enable you to avoid a\ntax?\nMS. KARLAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right. Well, then --\nMS. KARLAN: Let me give you a couple --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- then you might persuade me.\nMS. KARLAN: Let me give you a couple of\nexamples --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMS. KARLAN: -- that I think will be quite\nfamiliar. A 401(k) plan allows you to get access to money\nbefore you turn 59 and a half on account of hardship, and\nyou pay a 10 percent tax penalty if you do so.\nThe Federal Government's thrift savings plan for\nFederal employees allows you to take a loan out of the\nplan and to pay the interest back into your own account\nbefore you turn 59 and a half, thereby essentially giving\nyou free use of the money. If you don't pay the loan\nback, it's then treated as a -- as a distribution, and you\npay the 10 percent tax penalty on it.\nSo that if you read this statute to -- not to\ninclude IRA's, to deny exemption to IRA's, you read this\nstatute to deny exemption to virtually all of the modern\nforms of defined contribution pension plans or savings\nplans.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes. That was what I was\ngoing -- aren't most of the pension profit-sharing, stock\nbonus plans, and annuities similar to the IRA's in terms\nof allowing withdrawal on the payment of a penalty?\nMS. KARLAN: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: I thought they were all\nin the same boat. So what the effect of this rule is --\nof the Ninth Circuit is that they would all fail to\nqualify --\nMS. KARLAN: Yes, that's correct. You would\nrender section 522(d)(10)(e) essentially a nullity.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Oh, it's the Eighth Circuit.\nExcuse me.\nMS. KARLAN: Yes. I -- I can see why you might\nhave thought it was the Ninth Circuit.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It -- it might be wrong anyway.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. KARLAN: Yes, yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is the percentage amount\nof the payments that are taken out of all IRA plans before\npeople are 59 and a half?\nMS. KARLAN: Well, in the Cilek case from the\nSeventh Circuit, which is cited in our brief, the court\nthere cited statistics that suggested it was between 1.2\nand 1.7 percent of funds in IRA's were removed early under\nthe penalty process.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the -- the payment here --\nit says -- the statute uses the word payment. So suppose\nyou simply have an IRA plan but you don't take money out\nof it. Then is it exempt from bankruptcy?\nMS. KARLAN: It would be because it's the right\nto the future payments and not just the present payments,\nJustice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So -- so -- but I'm trying --\nwhat I'm trying to figure out is if a person were to take\n-- just reading it in English, it sounds as if a person\nwere to take the plan out before he's 59 and a half and\npay the penalty, that that amount that he took out would\nnot be a -- a payment because of age, but one that he took\nout after he's 59 and a half and didn't pay the penalty\nwould be.\nMS. KARLAN: That's correct, Justice Breyer.\nBut in order to protect the ability to take money out\nafter someone turns 59, you have to protect the corpus of\nthe IRA now because otherwise, when he turns 59 and a\nhalf, there won't be any money there for him to take out.\nAnd that's why the exemption extends not just to present\npayments, as the Third Circuit erroneously held, but also\nto the corpus when it is necessary for the support of the\ndebtor. And I can't emphasize --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Ms. Karlan, let me ask\nsomething about that very point because the statute says\nthat to the extent reasonably necessary for the support of\nthe debtor it's allowable.\nMS. KARLAN: Yes, Justice O'Connor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Are you aware of cases where\nthe bankruptcy court has said, well, you don't need all\nthat money? That's a big plan. You don't need all that.\nWe'll just let you deduct X amount.\nMS. KARLAN: Absolutely, Justice O'Connor. We\ncite a number of them in both the opening brief and in the\nyellow brief on pages 19 through -- to 20, I think is\nwhere we -- where we talk about --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we take this concrete\ncase? Hers was something over $12,000; his, something\nover $42,000.\nMS. KARLAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the claim here as to\n-- was part or all of that -- it would be some $54,000.\nMS. KARLAN: The claim was all that all of that\nwas necessary. If I could give an example that I think\nJustice O'Connor might find instructive here. When a\ndebtor, for example, is 40 years old, they generally\nrequire turnover of the entire IRA because people have\ntime to earn the money back again. When the debtor has\nother retirement savings, for example, in a case from\nVirginia called Abate, because the person also had a\n401(k) plan, they were required to turn over the entire\nIRA. When a debtor is able to work, even if the debtor is\nin his or her 50's, courts will often require exclusion of\nat -- will also require turnover of at least part of the\nIRA. In this case --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what do the courts do\nif they say, well, my client might be ill or something\nlike that? It seems to me --\nMS. KARLAN: Well, if the client is ill now,\nthey get to keep it --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. They -- they say my\nclient is able-bodied now, but we -- we need something\nbecause -- I don't know -- there's a history of family\nillness or something.\nMS. KARLAN: There isn't a reported case that\ntalks about the possibility of future illness as a reason\nof exempting the money.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's -- I'm trying to figure\nout how -- how -- what the theory is. Is -- you say I\nhave a right to receive payments because of age. And you\nsay, well, here I have a body of money and 99 percent\ncomes out of it after you're 60. 1 percent comes out\nbefore. So it's very tempting to say that that corpus\nthere, of course, is a body of money that you're going to\nhave a right to receive because of age because the\npractical effect of the 10 percent is -- is -- stops the\n-- the younger person getting the money.\nSo does the case then turn on that? I mean,\nsuppose -- suppose it were a 3 percent penalty and 40\npercent of the people took out the money before they were\n60 or a 1 percent penalty and 80 percent did it. Then\nshould I reach the other result? I'm just trying to think\nof how does this analysis work. What's the right\nanalysis?\nMS. KARLAN: I would say at the 1 percent and 80\npercent of the people are taking the money out, it\nwouldn't operate really as a retirement plan anymore.\nBut if I can give another statistic that might\nbe helpful in thinking about this. 18 percent of the\nparticipants in large 401(k) plans who are under the age\nof 50 are taking loans out against those plans today.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What percent?\nMS. KARLAN: 18 percent in one of the surveys.\nAnd yet, those plans are undeniably, absolutely exempt\nunder the bankruptcy --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they're taking out loans\nagainst it. They're -- they're not withdrawing the money.\nMS. KARLAN: Well, but the loans because -- for\nexample, in the Federal thrift savings plan, the interest\nis being paid back into your own account, it's essentially\nas close to taking out the money as you can get.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I still don't have your answer\nto the problem that bothered me at the first. How -- how\ndo you reconcile your positions with on account of\nlanguage? If the -- if your clients can take the money --\njust take the money out of the IRA at any time, then why\nis it on account of age?\nMS. KARLAN: It -- it's not the -- if you look\nat the statute -- and let me just work my way through it\nwith you. It's the right to a payment under a stock\nbonus, profit-sharing, annuity, or similar plan on account\nof illness. And the question is what does on account of\nmodify there. I think the most natural and sensible\nreading of the statute is a plan that is because of age, a\nplan that is because of disability, and the like.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So you say that payment\ndoesn't -- on account of doesn't modify payment.\nMS. KARLAN: I don't -- I don't think you need\nto read it that way, and I think the most sensible reading\nhere, especially given that the statute --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I think the logical\nreading is that it -- it modifies payment.\nMS. KARLAN: Well, I -- I'm not sure that it\ndoes, but even if it did, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Holistic for me. What\n-- what does it -- what does it modify? I mean, if you\nhad to diagram it, on account of goes to what noun?\nMS. KARLAN: Well, this is again -- I know you\ndissented yesterday, but this is a less than meticulously\ncrafted statute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. I thought I was being\nholistic yesterday, to tell you the truth.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. KARLAN: Okay. Okay.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But --\nMS. KARLAN: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- but what does on account of\nmodify?\nMS. KARLAN: I think what on account of modifies\nhere is the kind of plan out of which the payment is\ncoming.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where is that noun?\nMS. KARLAN: There are a variety of plans, stock\nbonus, pension --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The right to receive a payment\nunder a stock bonus, pension --\nMS. KARLAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- profit sharing, annuity, or\nsimilar plan or -- or contract. It's a plan on account of\nillness, an annuity?\nMS. KARLAN: Plans --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why -- why isn't it a right on\naccount of?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's the right on account of.\nMS. KARLAN: Well, I think you can read it\neither way and you'll get to exactly the same result. So\nlet me read it the way that you've been reading it, which\nis if you want to protect the ability of people who have\nIRA's to withdraw money on account of age, you have to\nprotect the IRA now or there will be no money in it for\nthem to exercise their right to withdraw on account of\nage.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, but -- but there still is\na right to take payments at any time.\nMS. KARLAN: Justice -- Justice Kennedy, we\ndon't believe --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So -- so then you're --\nyou're --\nMS. KARLAN: -- that that's actually a right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Under that, you're giving the\n-- the language that follows it no meaning.\nMS. KARLAN: No, Justice Kennedy, I don't think\nthat's what I'm doing here, and the reason I don't think\nthat's what I'm doing is because this statute clearly\nrefers to IRA's by name as one of the plans that's\nentitled to exemption.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But as purely English -- as\npurely English, I read it as saying it's a right. What is\nthat right? The right is a right to receive a payment on\naccount of age. That's the -- a plan. That's the right.\nNow, your argument, I take it, was -- is that\nyes, it's true you also have a right under certain\nconditions to take it without respect to age. So what we\nhave here is a plan that gives you both kind of rights.\nMS. KARLAN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's a kind that gives you a\nright to take it with a penalty and a right to take it\nbecause of age without a penalty. And thus, the question\nis, is that kind of plan which gives you both kind of\nrights covered? And the language doesn't answer it.\nSo --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But under Justice Breyer's\nhypothetical, that's just like a savings account.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMS. KARLAN: No.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, because the savings account\ndoesn't have -- I mean, the savings account doesn't have\nthe -- the penalty. Isn't your argument that you've got\nto read the right as meaning a right without penalty,\nbecause if you don't read it that way, then every one of\nthese other retirement instruments is likewise going to\nfail? Isn't that your -- your strong point?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's your strong point.\nMS. KARLAN: That's correct. That's -- that's\nour strong point and we're sticking with it.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right. Right -- it's not a\nright if you have to pay a penalty for it.\nMS. KARLAN: That's correct. It's not a right,\nas we say in the reply brief, to park on the sidewalk\nbecause if you pay the parking ticket, you can park there.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMS. KARLAN: And I think no matter how --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's a good argument. I like\nthat.\nMS. KARLAN: Thank you.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. KARLAN: No matter how you read the statute,\nit's designed to cover IRA's, and any reading of the\nstatute that ends up not covering IRA's will also not\ncover many of the other --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why didn't Congress just put\nin IRA's along with the other things?\nMS. KARLAN: They did, Justice Ginsburg. They\ndid in the last line of the statute.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but that's sort of an\noblique way to get it there. I mean, why didn't they put\nit together with the other string of plans?\nMS. KARLAN: Well, my best guess as to why they\ndidn't do that is they started drafting the exemptions\nstatute in 1973 and they enacted IRA's in 1974, so they\nstuck it in at the end of the list. That's my best guess.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What your -- what your\nopponents say is that the -- the thing at the end doesn't\nprove anything because they're willing to acknowledge that\nsome IRA's can be so structured that you cannot withdraw\nuntil -- until you reach a certain age. And if they're\nstructured that way, they would be covered. So you had to\nmention 408 in the -- in the exceptions. What's wrong\nwith that argument?\nMS. KARLAN: Well, what's wrong with that,\nJustice Scalia, is that all IRA's are designed and they're\nadministered on forms that the Internal Revenue Service\nsets out and you buy the forms to allow for early\nwithdrawal. So under their theory, there has -- there is\nnot now and there has never been a single IRA anywhere in\nthe United States --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well --\nMS. KARLAN: -- that had that inability to take\nthe money out subject to penalty prior to the age 59 and a\nhalf.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do -- do we know that? I mean,\ncouldn't someone -- I -- I don't think this is a very\nplausible basis for construing the statute, but just as a\ntechnical matter, couldn't someone go to the bank or\nbrokerage firm and say I want to set up an IRA, but I want\nthe IRA to be, in -- in effect, like an irrevocable trust\nin which withdrawals can only be made on certain, specific\nconditions? And couldn't someone, using both the IRA\nmechanism and a State irrevocable trust document, create\nan IRA that would be as restricted as -- as the circuit\nsuggested it might be?\nMS. KARLAN: I don't necessarily think so for\nthe following reason. IRA's are off-the-rack products.\nThey're a basic consumer product that 40 million people\nbuy. People don't usually negotiate the terms.\nIf you did negotiate the terms, though, here's\nthe second problem. Anytime you deviate from the form\nthat the Internal Revenue Service gives you, which also\ngives you these rights to withdraw early subject to\npenalty, you run the risk that your plan will then be held\nto be a nonqualifying plan under section 408 of the tax\ncode. You then lose the ability to deduct the\ncontributions going in. You then lose the ability to\ndefer the payments on the income as it accrues in the\naccount.\nNow, to answer the last part of your question,\none of the things that has occurred over the last, say, 5\nto 10 years is more and more States are passing laws that\nessentially protect IRA's in bankruptcy and out, as a\nmatter of State law, from any attachment by creditors.\nWhy do they do that? Because they recognize that IRA's\nare a fundamental piece of the retirement system today.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And some don't. And the --\nand the State systems vary.\nMS. KARLAN: That's correct, but only four\nStates offer no protection to IRA's from creditors as\nopposed to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: As opposed to how many who\ndo?\nMS. KARLAN: 46 States offer some kind of\nprotection. 23 States protect them without limit in\nbankruptcy and out. 6 of them protect them inside of\nbankruptcy using the State exemptions as long as the\namount is reasonable and necessary for the debtor's\nsupport.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that's what -- with the\npurpose that we're talking about now --\nMS. KARLAN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- if it's only 6 that, faced\nwith a bankruptcy, would shelter the IRA.\nMS. KARLAN: No. No. 23 of them would protect\nall IRA's. 6 would protect all IRA's if the money in them\nis necessary to the debtor's support, an additional 6. 6\nmore would protect all the money in an IRA as long as it\nwas deposited 120 days or a year or 3 years before the\ndebtor filed for bankruptcy. 3 of them will protect all\nIRA's up to a dollar amount. In Nevada, the dollar amount\nis $500,000. 8 States use, as their State exemption law,\nan IRA that -- a statute that has exactly the same\nlanguage as the Federal statute. 6 of those State\nstatutes have been interpreted by Federal courts to\nprotect IRA's.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But here there was no choice\nof picking up on the State?\nMS. KARLAN: There's a -- there's a weird\nanomaly in Arkansas, Your Honor, which is Arkansas law\ndoes, in fact, protect IRA's, but the Federal bankruptcy\ncourts in Arkansas have interpreted that law only to\nprotect the IRA up to $500 because of a provision in the\nArkansas constitution, article 9, section 2, that means\nthat you can only save up to $500. So any bankrupt person\nin Arkansas who wants to keep any money in his -- in his\nIRA has to elect the Federal exemptions rather than\nelecting the State exemptions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And one train that we didn't\nfinish before. You were explaining that in this case the\nentire $55,000 -- that entire sum would be needed -- would\nbe necessary for the support of the debtors.\nMS. KARLAN: That's correct. The bankruptcy\ncourt did not rule on our claim that it was all reasonably\nnecessary because they decided first that IRA's didn't\ncome within the meaning of section 522.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- that was your\nclaim, and I --\nMS. KARLAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How did you come to that\nconclusion, that the entire amount?\nMS. KARLAN: Well, if you take, say, $55,000 and\nyou ask what sort of annuity could you purchase when you\nhit age 59 and a half with that money, it will be an\nannuity that, I would guess -- you know, I -- I hate to do\nmath in my head like this. I'd guess it would throw off a\ncouple of hundred dollars a month in additional income.\nAnd so if you ask will the Rouseys need that\nmoney for their support, I think the answer is yes because\ntheir only other support --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well. Oh, yes.\nMS. KARLAN: -- is Social Security and a $2,000\na month defined benefit plan that will never go up and\nagainst which their Social Security will be offset. So\nwhen they start becoming eligible, as Mr. Rousey is about\nto be, for Social Security, that defined benefit plan\nreduces their benefits. So if the Rouseys are to have an\nold age in which they can afford to live in any kind of\nreasonable circumstance at all, they need this money.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I go back and just nail\ndown one lose end in -- in an answer that you -- you gave\nto my question, can you set up a kind of irrevocable? I\nassume clearly from what you say is that there is not only\nno statute, but no IRS reg or ruling to the effect that\nyou can make your IRA terms more restrictive without\njeopardizing your qualification.\nMS. KARLAN: I was unable to find one, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMS. KARLAN: I'd like to reserve the remainder\nof my time.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why didn't the Government come\nin here, just as a matter of curiosity? We don't have an\namicus brief here from the Government, do we?\nMS. KARLAN: I -- no, we do not have one, and I\ndon't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The Government has no position\non the matter.\nMS. KARLAN: Well, I -- I don't think they've\ntaken a position here. I will say that in Patterson\nagainst Shumate, they referred to IRA's in a footnote in\ntheir brief, I believe, as pension plans under section\n408.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There -- they never go\nbankrupt, so the position they usually take is against\nany exemption from the --\n(Laughter.)\nMS. KARLAN: Well -- well, that's correct. The\nUnited States trustee may have wanted them to -- I'd like\nto reserve the remainder of my time.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. McKiever.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF COLLI C. McKIEVER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. McKIEVER: Justice Stevens, may it please\nthe Court:\nPursuant to section 522(d)(10)(e) of the\nBankruptcy Code, a debtor's right to receive a payment is\nnot exempt unless two requirements are met. First, the\nright to receive the payment must be on account of\nillness, disability, death, age or length of service, and\nthe right must come from a specified similar plan or\ncontract. Because neither of those elements is satisfied\nin this case, the petitioners' IRA's are not exempt.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is it -- is it the case that\nother plans that are clearly covered by the text of this\nstatute also permit early withdrawal for certain reasons?\nMS. McKIEVER: Yes and no, and let me explain\nthat. Yes, they do permit withdrawals based upon certain\nfactors. Those are enumerated based -- based upon each\nindividual plan. However, they do not permit withdrawals\nfor any reason at any time for any purpose.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not a single one of them.\nMS. McKIEVER: Not a single one of them. Now,\nof course, I've not read every plan ever created, but none\nof the plans that I have ever seen, as the specified\nplans, the pension plans, the profit-sharing plans, any of\nthose, allow withdrawal for any reason at any time.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you'd say that if one of\nthem did, it would also not be covered.\nMS. McKIEVER: That's correct. It -- it is\nthought --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What -- what --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I take it -- in -- in answering\nJustice Scalia, I take it from what you didn't say that\nnone of the -- we'll call them kind of the paradigm\nexample plans are, however, as -- as restricted as the\nlanguage in this -- this statute would suggest that it had\nto be if you read it in a -- in a very literal way.\nMS. McKIEVER: There are --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, they're all a\nlittle bit sinful, at least, even if they're not as sinful\nas -- as you say the -- the 401 -- the -- the IRA is.\nMS. McKIEVER: That -- that is correct. The --\nthere probably are plans out there -- once again, there\nare so many plans. And those are created by financial\ninstitutions, by employers, by different entities. So\ntherefore there are thousands of variations of those.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, why? Okay. Once you're\ndown that road, you have conceded, as you must, that a\nplan that says you get the money because of age but you\nalso can get the money without respect to age in certain\ncircumstances can be a plan covered by the act. Now,\nthat's the kind of a plan that's right in front of you.\nSo, therefore, literally it falls just as much within the\nlanguage as the other that you want to say even though\nthat is literally true, this plan is very different from\nthe others in terms of the purposes of the act. That's\nwhat I would like to hear because to me, I'm not so moved\nby holistic as I am by purposes, which is part of\nholistic.\nSo -- so the -- the point that I would like to\nknow is why, since ordinary people think of IRA's as\npensions -- I do. I think of it that way. I don't know\nmuch about it. It's designed to help in the future, help\nwhen you're old and sick. But there is this extra thing\nin it which you point to. So why, in terms of purposes is\nthis different from the others?\nMS. McKIEVER: This is different because this is\nthe only kind of plan where you can access the funds at\nany time for any purpose. It is also --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know that, but -- but -- and\nyou do it with a penalty. We agree about the facts.\nMS. McKIEVER: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I want to know why that\ndifference makes a difference in a world where only 1 or\nless 2 percent of the people do access it before they're\n60, 59 and a half.\nMS. McKIEVER: Because the right to -- to\nreceive the payment, the right to access the money at any\ntime exists no matter if it is exercised or not, and it\ndoes not meet the language of the statute. The statute\nvery specifically --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I -- you've missed my\npoint and I'm sorry. I put you on the wrong track with my\nfollowing up. I shouldn't have.\nMS. McKIEVER: I'm sorry. Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: My question is we all agree\nthat there can be plans where you can get the money not\nhaving to do with age, and they fall within the language\nof the act, and indeed, you say some are covered. But\nthis one you say is worse than the others in terms of the\npurposes of the act, and that's what I want to hear why.\nMS. McKIEVER: Because there is no causal\nconnection between any of the factors that are enumerated\nin the statute and the right to receive the money. And\nthat is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question?\nSupposing instead of a 10 percent penalty, there was an\nabsolute prohibition, would you agree -- on getting the\nmoney before you're 59 and a half, would then that\nqualify?\nMS. McKIEVER: Absolutely, yes, it would.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Now, what if there were a 50\npercent penalty?\nMS. McKIEVER: Clearly, there's a point at which\nit would qualify as a prohibition more than just --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And what is it that makes it a\nprohibition? Is it -- is it because the purpose is to\ndeter withdrawals, or it is that it becomes economically\nunacceptable? What -- what is the reason for drawing the\nline somewhere above 10 percent?\nMS. McKIEVER: The reason for drawing the line\nis because at 10 percent, as the Eighth Circuit has stated\nin -- in the Huebner case, it -- it said that it's a\nminimal penalty. However, there is still the unfettered\naccess that's available.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But what is the purpose of\nimposing any penalty at all?\nMS. McKIEVER: I would assume as a disincentive\nto -- to withdraw, but it's clearly not a prohibition,\nsuch as the -- the parking --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But 50 percent would not be a\nprohibition and neither would 90 percent.\nMS. McKIEVER: It would not be a prohibition,\nbut it would operate more as a prohibition than 10\npercent.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So it's a matter of degree\nrather than a difference in kind.\nMS. McKIEVER: Clearly that -- it's a very\ndifficult line to draw. I -- I can't make that call at\nthis moment, but --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me the easiest\nblack letter rule is no tax or some tax. I mean, if it\nwas totally free like an ordinary bank account, then you'd\nbe dead right. But the fact that for a -- an important\npurpose there is a 10 percent penalty put in seems to me\nputs it into the category of things that are -- you're not\nsupposed to have an absolute right to get.\nMS. McKIEVER: But the -- the hallmark\ndifference here is that it -- it is the only type of\naccount that you can access paying the penalty for any\nreason --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I assume --\nMS. McKIEVER: -- regardless of the specified\nreason.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that -- that your answer to\nJustice Breyer as to why that makes a difference with\nregard to the purpose of the statute is that the purpose\nof the statute is to make sure that people have money for\ntheir retirement, and that if you can withdraw it for any\nreason whatever, there is no security that that money will\nbe there for their retirement; whereas if you limit the\nreasons to sickness and -- and a certain other number of\nemergency reasons, the chances the money will be there for\nthe retirement are much higher.\nMS. McKIEVER: Well, that -- that's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that the answer?\nJUSTICE BREYER: But if that's the answer,\nexcellent. So now we have --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- let's say --\nMS. McKIEVER: Thank you, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Let's try -- let's try a\nmillion percent tax and nobody in history has ever\nwithdrawn the money. Now, would -- that you would say\nwould fall within this.\nMS. McKIEVER: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fine, yes.\nMS. McKIEVER: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, if that would fall\nwithin this, going back to Justice Stevens, because that\noperates as a bar to prevent the bad world that Justice\nScalia mentioned, why doesn't a tax that operates as a bar\nthat's good enough to stop 98.5 percent of the people from\nwithdrawing their money and having nothing left for old\nage -- why isn't that just as good as the million percent\ntax in a world that is imperfect?\nMS. McKIEVER: Because clearly the -- the access\nof money and the ability to use it prior to retirement,\njust as -- as Justice Scalia just stated, that allows the\n-- the debtors to -- to access freely for any purpose,\nclearly not showing that -- that it would be for\nretirement purposes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But attachment of the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right, but it's acquired.\nSay -- say retirement, not old age. I mean, you know, 60\n-- it's not that bad --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: 93.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If -- if that is going to be\nyour criterion, the -- the total freedom for any purpose,\nthen why, if we accept your argument, why -- why don't we\nface sort of a daunting run or the courts face sort of\ndaunting future? Because the -- the question then is\ngoing to be, well, what purposes are sufficiently close to\nold age to -- to allow for a continued exemption and how\nfree may the purposes be before a plan falls into the IRA\ncategory. You told us a few moments ago -- and I'm sure\nyou -- you were right -- that the kind of the paradigm\nexample plans vary enormously depending on the terms in\nwhich employers set them up. So if -- if we say that the\n-- the dividing line is going to be between plans under\nwhich withdrawal can be for any purpose versus plans in\nwhich withdrawal is going to be somehow limited, then\nwe're going to have to litigate an awful lot of plans.\nAren't we?\nMS. McKIEVER: Not necessarily. The -- the line\nthat we're really looking to is that there has to be a\ndirect causation factor between one of the five specified\nfactors such as on -- on account of factors, age,\ndisability, death, length of service, and the right to\nreceive the payment.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but typically these\nplans like 401(k) plans permit hardship withdrawals, and\nother plans that are mentioned in the act allow\nwithdrawals for medical reasons or to buy housing or\nsomething like that. I mean, you -- we would just have\nendless cases trying to figure out what qualifies and what\ndoesn't. It seems like such a hard line for you to try to\ndraw here.\nMS. McKIEVER: Well --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And every plan that I know of\nallows withdrawal if you terminate employment.\nMS. McKIEVER: And that's typically --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: In fact, that's what happened\nto these people.\nSo I just don't see how your argument is going\nto --\nMS. McKIEVER: Well, the -- the ability to\naccess the funds, oftentimes with termination, has to do\nwith the length of service, the years in service because\nthey accumulate and oftentimes are not payable at the full\npercentage. They're not fully vested until that time.\nAlso, with the -- when there are multiple\nfactors existing in the right to receive the payments,\neach multiple factor can be a cause of the -- of the\nability to reach the money. When there are no meaningful\nfactors imposed, though --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Isn't it simpler to just\nrecognize that these plans are covered despite the right\nto withdraw and then rely on the provision in the statute\nthat only permits the deduction to the extent reasonably\nnecessary for the support? I mean, that -- that seems to\nme a fall-back position that's provided for in the\nstatute.\nMS. McKIEVER: I understand that -- that may\nappear to be correct, but the problem with that is that as\n-- taxpayer status is not the hallmark in this case of if\nit is or is not exempt. Therefore, all types of accounts,\nwhether they are truly retirement accounts or -- or if\nthey're just savings accounts, could potentially qualify\nunder this statute. If -- if you want to open it up and\n-- and allow all kinds of accounts to be exemptible under\n522(d)(10)(e), the problem is that there is no limit on\nwhat can be potentially exempt under that statute.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: No. Well, obviously, it's --\nit's governed by the statutory provision that it has to be\na stock bonus, pension, profit-sharing, annuity, or\nsimilar plan or contract on account of, and so on.\nMS. McKIEVER: That's correct.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And it includes IRA's\napparently because of the last provision in the statute\nreferring back to individual retirement acts under section\n408 of the Internal Revenue Code.\nMS. McKIEVER: The section 408 reference is --\ndoes not in any way expand the exemption. In fact, it is\na further condition to place on the -- the exemption.\nFirst of all, section 408 sets out only the minimum\nrequirements for an IRA to qualify as a -- as a tax-\nfavored plan. That --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. -- Ms. Karlan says she\ndoesn't know of any -- of any IRA that did place a -- a\nrestriction which would bring it within that exemption\neven though the ordinary IRA wouldn't be within the\nexemption. Do you know of any IRA, a single IRA that --\nthat has a provision in it restricting withdrawal?\nMS. McKIEVER: Absolutely. Those are\ncustomizable plans. Any person can go into --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They can, but do -- do you know\nthat there's -- there's one out there? I don't know --\nMS. McKIEVER: I -- I do know of several out\nthere.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You didn't just draw one up for\nthis case, did you?\n(Laughter.)\nMS. McKIEVER: I did not create one for this\ncase. No, I did not.\nBut they -- they definitely exist. In fact, in\nthe Andersen case out of the Eighth Circuit Bankruptcy\nAppellate Panel, the debtor had an annuity and prior to\nthe filing of the bankruptcy petition, she elected that\nshe would only receive periodic payments based upon her\nage, and that was found to be exempt by the Bankruptcy\nAppellate Panel because that qualified. The payments were\nbased upon her age, and it was then a similar plan because\nshe could not access the funds at any time but only for\nthe specified reason such as age.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was that -- was that an IRA\nthat she had? It was an IRA?\nMS. McKIEVER: My understanding is, yes, it was\nunder section 408(b) was -- that's my understanding based\nupon that case.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let me -- let me ask you.\nMaybe this is irrelevant, but were -- were these\nrestrictive IRA's that you're aware of set up under those\nterms in contemplation of bankruptcy? If the answer is\nno, why would anyone so restrict his -- his IRA?\nMS. McKIEVER: I -- I do not know if that one\nspecifically was, but no. These have not been set up\nthrough --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But why -- why would anyone do\nthat? They're -- they're qualified without these\nrestrictions. Why would anyone want to cut off his -- his\nrights to -- to withdraw?\nMS. McKIEVER: Clearly to protect the money\npotentially for retirement and -- and just as --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, like setting up\na personal spendthrift trust?\nMS. McKIEVER: That's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I want to make it tough so\nthat I -- I will not be tempted to withdraw. Is that the\nmotivation?\nMS. McKIEVER: Well, that would potentially be a\nmotivation because clearly the money is there readily\naccessible at any time to -- to buy anything that the\ndebtor chooses throughout their life. So someone who's 30\nor 40 years old can liquidate their -- their IRA account,\nwhereas with a pension or profit-sharing plan, they don't\nhave that kind of access --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Should we put any weight on the\ntitle, on the name? I mean, I -- I can't but thinking\nit's an individual retirement account. Was Congress\ntrying to fool people?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: Was the Federal Trade\nCommission? Should they investigate? What -- I mean, the\n-- the -- I think of it as an account that's basically\naimed, at least Congress thought it was aimed, at\nretirement, which has usually to do with age.\nMS. McKIEVER: Well, the -- the name is clearly\nnot determinative.\nAlso, Congress in the -- in the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm reading the statute and if\nI were voting on it and put in the 408 reference and think\nof the word individual retirement account, is there any --\nI would have thought, knowing not that much about it, that\nof course, they'd be included. Now, is there any\nindication, when people passed this, that they didn't\nthink they would be? Any -- any reference in the terrible\nwords, legislative history, that might shed light on it?\nMS. McKIEVER: Yes. First of all, Congress did\nhistorically reject, first of all, just tax-favored status\noverall, such as what an IRA account is. An IRA account\nis set up just for tax-favored status. Congress set\nforth, instead, the (d)(10)(e) -- 522(d)(10)(e)\nrequirements that -- that are much more stringent in the\nrequirements of the traditional IRA.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, are they? Because\nthere was one statement -- I think it was in Ms. Karlan's\nbrief -- that the Fifth Circuit said profit-sharing plans\npermit participants to withdraw up to the entire amount on\npayment of the penalty. So a profit-sharing plan, which\nwas one of the ones on the list, seems to be substantially\nidentical if you can also take out, whenever you like, as\nlong as you're willing to pay the penalty.\nMS. McKIEVER: That's a misnomer that that's a\n-- a right to payment. That is rather the right to borrow\nas a loan. And a loan is very different than a right to\npayment. They have the right to borrow the funds.\nHowever -- for example, in the New York Police Department\npension plan, which she referenced in the reply brief, the\npolice officers can borrow up to 90 percent of their\npension plan funds. However, they -- as long as they're\nemployed there, they have to continue to repay that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what if they don't\nrepay it? What's the sanction?\nMS. McKIEVER: There is a 10 percent penalty.\nHowever, as the bankruptcy --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But what -- where -- where\nwould the -- where would the principal repayment come\nfrom? I assume it would come from deducting whatever the\nbalance was from the -- the person's account.\nMS. McKIEVER: That would be correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, we call it -- the --\nthe loan feature then boils down to a -- a withdrawal\nsubject to a periodic repayment obligation, but if that\nobligation is not satisfied, the bottom line will be\nexactly like a withdrawal because they will simply deduct\nwhatever the balance is from the person's rights under the\nplan.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Plus 10 percent you say.\nMS. McKIEVER: That's correct. However --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So it's just -- just like an\nIRA.\nMS. McKIEVER: But -- but this is in the\nbankruptcy context, which makes it completely different.\nThe bankruptcy filing of a chapter VII bankruptcy is a\npicture in time. At the time that the debtor files the\nbankruptcy petition, you look to the assets that the\ndebtor has possession of and the interest that the debtor\nhas at that moment. There's also, for some things, a 1-\nyear look-back period. But because it's a picture in\ntime, it's what the -- the debtor can reach is what the --\nthe bankruptcy trustee looks to, the types of assets that\n-- that the debtor owns. This is very different than the\npension plan which, of course, the debtor could not have\n-- have exhausted to pay the creditors prior to filing the\nbankruptcy, but any other type of account would be there,\nwould be present at the retirement. But because they\ncould have liquidated their IRA's to pay off their\ncreditors prior to filing the bankruptcy, the bankruptcy\ntrustee steps into the shoes of that debtor and has the\nability to reach the funds that the debtor can potentially\nreach.\nThere are other exemptions, of course, set forth\nin -- in section 522(d), you know, for a home or jewelry,\nbut the assets that are not exempt are readily available\nto repay creditors, for -- for the benefit of the\ncreditors. Therefore, that -- that makes it\nsignificantly --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Subject to the 10 percent if\nthe bankruptcy trustee does that?\nMS. McKIEVER: That's correct. That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The -- the penalty still has to\nbe paid even if it's the trustee who takes money out to\npay the creditors, on your view.\nMS. McKIEVER: That's correct. Yes, they do.\nThey do.\nAdditionally, the petitioners' IRA's are -- by\nallowing unfettered access, are unlike any of the other\nplans because the petitioners' standard IRA is much more\nlike a savings account. It's not any form of deferred\ncompensation. They can't look to that to fill a salary\nvoid after they retire because the money may not be there.\nUnlike in the pension plans or a profit-sharing plan, they\ncould have liquidated those funds prior to their reaching\nany age or any illness that -- that may befall them.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there -- there is no\npenalty attached to withdrawing from a savings account,\nand there's also no limit on the annual contribution.\nMS. McKIEVER: That's correct. That is correct.\nThat is correct.\nBut the -- the key here --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let me just get -- get straight\nwhat -- what the -- what the universe of plans we have in\nfront of us here. Do you assert that there are no other\nplans, clearly covered by this statute, that permit\nwithdrawal for any reason but with a penalty?\nMS. McKIEVER: That's correct. None of the\nspecified plans listed, the -- the ones enumerated.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would permit withdrawal for any\nreason whatever provided that a penalty is paid.\nMS. McKIEVER: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: None of them is like that.\nMS. McKIEVER: None of them is like that. They\nall have specific factors. There has to be a causal\nconnection between the ability to access the money.\nAdditionally, it's very important that -- that\nan account or plan that qualifies under the statute -- it\nhas to be determined on a case-by-case basis. And there's\nno question that there are definitely IRA's that -- that\ncould and do qualify for this exemption. It is, instead,\nthat --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do -- do you disagree with\nMs. Karlan that this is -- this is a standardized product\nso the people, the Rouseys of this world, really couldn't\nget a tailor-made IRA? They would have to take the\nstandard product.\nMS. McKIEVER: That's not -- that's not correct.\nThere are many customizable products that are -- are out\nthere. In fact, for example, when employers set up\ndifferent kinds of plans for their employees, they go and\nthey can choose from many different options. For example,\nthey can choose if they even have a -- a loan provision\nbuilt into a -- a 401(k) or a pension plan, just like the\nIRA. They -- they can be customized because section 408\nonly sets forth the minimum requirements for it to qualify\nfor tax-favored status. That -- that is an Internal\nRevenue Code section, and it does not in any way prohibit\nadditional factors being placed into the plan. Rather, it\nallows the -- the individual or the employer because some\n-- there are two different types of IRA's that can be set\nup by an employer -- to go and customize those so that\nthey could potentially meet the statutory requirements.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: These -- these other plans that\nallow you to withdraw for certain reasons but not for any\nreason -- what happens if you withdraw for any reason?\nMS. McKIEVER: That --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is the sanction against --\nI mean, you just go in. You withdraw the money for -- for\na reason that is not allowed by the employer plan. What\n-- what is the sanction?\nMS. McKIEVER: My understanding is that -- is\nthat you cannot access the funds for a reason not allowed\nby those plans, that that is prohibited. And that -- that\nis similar to Ms. Andersen's IRA in the Bankruptcy\nAppellate Panel case. She could no longer reach the funds\nin the -- she could no longer reach the corpus of the\naccount. The -- the lump sum of money was there for her\nretirement years. Whereas, in the IRA situation, the\nmoney is not protected at any time. There's no\nprohibition at all whatsoever on withdrawing the funds\nfrom the account other than the payment of the penalty.\nBut whether an account or plan qualifies under\nthe statute, it -- it -- you look at the language of the\nplan on a plan-by-plan basis. The petitioners' argument\nrenders the terms of the statute superfluous because,\nfirst of all, it is dissimilar from the enumerated plans,\nand secondly, it is not on account of any factors that the\nmoney can be reached. The right to receive the payment is\nnot based upon any factor other than the -- the account\nholder wanting to withdraw the funds.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The right to receive\n100 percent is -- is dependent on a factor, isn't it?\nMS. McKIEVER: Yes, it is.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. At least as to the 10\npercent that would be penalty, there's no right to get\nthat money unless you have a certain age.\nMS. McKIEVER: That's correct. Unless you have\n-- or another factor such as for education or for a home\nloan, something like that. There are several different\nreasons that you can -- you can reach the money and not\npay a penalty.\nHowever, the penalty is not -- is not the\ndeciding factor. It's their ability to access the funds\nat any time that -- that makes that a right of payment.\nIt's not a right of payment without a penalty. It's just\nthat the right to payment exists at all times.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You don't dispute that --\nthat it's a very small percentage of people who have IRA's,\nin fact, exercise the right to withdraw, given the penalty.\nMS. McKIEVER: That -- that -- that is --\nappears to be correct. I don't have those exact\nstatistics, but yes, that -- that appears to be correct,\nthat they have -- that they may not exercise that at -- in\ngreat numbers.\nFirst of all, going back to the causation factor\nabout the -- the ability of the debtors to withdraw the\nfunds for any reason or no reason, this Court in the 203\nNorth LaSalle case determined that on account of must mean\nbecause of, and that -- that is a key point here because\nif the debtors can reach the funds for any reason, it is\nnot because of any other factor. And in the LaSalle case,\nthis Court found that that reading, the because of\nreading, absolutely applies to this section of the -- the\nBankruptcy Code, that means that the result is that a\ndirect causal connection is required between the right to\nreceive the payment in the on account of requirements. In\n-- in this case there is no causal connection whatsoever\nbetween the right to receive the payments and -- and any\nof the factors enumerated in the statute.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The words, on account of, in\nthis -- this statute are sort of unusual, no matter how you\nconstrue them, because really the payment is on account of\nthe years of service or it's on account of a lot of things.\nYou may become eligible at a certain time. It would be\nbetter if it said a payment for which you became eligible\nfor one of these reasons because the payment isn't really on\naccount of all of these things. You may get the same amount\nwhether you're disabled or not depending on what the terms\nof the plan are.\nMS. McKIEVER: That's correct. There are, of\ncourse, always some other factors, such as you have to\nfirst deposit the money, you have to become eligible. But\nonce those barriers are passed, then -- then the right to\nreceive the payment has to be at least -- one of the\ncauses must be one of these factors. And it has to be\nenumerated in the plan. It cannot be for any reason, but\nmust be an enumerated reason in the plan.\nAnd the -- with the penalty, only the avoidance\nof a penalty is based upon the -- the age of the debtor or\nthe -- or any of the factors. It's -- section\n522(d)(10)(e) is void of any reference to the tax status\nor to the right to receive the payment without penalty.\nIt's only the right to receive the payment overall.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Does your argument draw a\nring around IRA's? It was suggested that if your argument\nprevails, then these other plans would be affected as\nwell.\nMS. McKIEVER: Only to the extent that -- that\nthey are not payable for any of the reasons enumerated in\nthe statute. If -- if they are available for payment at\nany time for any reason, then -- then they would not\nqualify. But the specified accounts, so long as they're\npayable for -- for one of the factors and that there's a\ndirect nexus between the right to receive the payment and\n-- and the factors, then -- then they would qualify for\nthe exemption. It is not, by any stretch, all IRA's. It\nis just the types that -- currently that the petitioners\nwould have or that people would have that would allow the\naccess at any time for any purpose. So it's not that the\ntrustee is looking to have IRA's not be eligible for\nexemption. It's just the types of accounts from which all\nthe funds can be withdrawn at any time for any purpose.\nThere are many qualifying IRA's that do exist,\nthat can exist. It's just that people have set these up\nfrom standard plans allowing them access. Whether they\naccess the funds or not is not the key, but the ability to\naccess the money because it doesn't meet the statutory\nrequirements. There are several IRA's, though, that can\nand do meet the statutory requirements. It's just that\nthe petitioners' don't.\nThe case law in the Eighth Circuit was well\nsettled, prior to the filing of this bankruptcy, that for\napproximately 12 years, that the definition of similar\nplan or contract did not include IRA's such as this, and\nthat the on account of factors had to be satisfied to\nclaim this exemption. The -- the debtors knew or -- or\npotentially should have known that -- that their IRA's\nwere likely not exempt out of Eighth Circuit at the time\nthat they filed because of the way that -- that these had\nbeen construed for a long period of time. So that they\ncould have set up accounts that did qualify for such\nexemption, but -- but they did not restrict their access\nin that way.\nThank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Ms. McKiever.\nMs. Karlan, you have about 7 minutes. You're\nnot required to use it all.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. KARLAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMS. KARLAN: I'm going to retire early.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. KARLAN: The -- the first point is that\nthere are two rights under IRA's: the right after age 59\nand a half or upon death or disability or illness to\nwithdraw the money without any kind of penalty; and\nthere's a second little exercise, an entirely subsidiary\nright, which is the ability to withdraw money subject to a\npenalty earlier. The existence of that second entirely\nsubsidiary, almost never used right -- and the statistic\non this is in the green brief at page 23 -- means that the\nreal essence of an IRA is it is a plan on account of age.\nThe second point. As this Court said last\nyear --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't really have a right\nto receive it on account of age. You have a right to\nreceive it without a penalty on account of age.\nMS. KARLAN: Well, at the age of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It isn't the right to receive\nthe money that depends on your age. It's the right to\nreceive the money without paying a tax.\nMS. KARLAN: Well, that's a right that's very\nimportant because let me give you just a mathematical\nexample of the difference.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is a right that's important,\nbut it's not what the statute says. The statute says --\nMS. KARLAN: The statute gives that right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- the right to receive a\npayment on account of, among other things, age.\nMS. KARLAN: And you do have that right. You\nalso have another right. But the existence of that second\nright doesn't negate the first right. The statute doesn't\nhere, for example, as section 522 or section 365 of the\nBankruptcy Code does, use the word solely to say you -- a\nplan is eligible only if you have solely the right to\nreceive on this --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, but it lists the other\nreasons: on account of illness, disability, death, age,\nor length of service. And -- and, you know, when you have\na list like that, you would think that the right to\nreceive the money for some other reason doesn't -- doesn't\nqualify. I mean, I would think that that's --\nMS. KARLAN: That might be your first thought,\nbut then --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or -- or at least -- at least\nsome other reason that isn't closely related to those.\nMS. KARLAN: Oh, but I think even if that were\nyour first thought, you would then get to the implication\nthat many of the Justices have been pressing today, which\nis the implication of that for all plans is tremendous\nbecause all plans give -- well, I shouldn't say all plans,\nbut I should say the vast majority of other plans, 401(k)\nplans, profit-sharing plans, and the like, do give you\nearly access to your money, and that's valuable to you.\nThat's why in section --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is it true that none of them\ngive unfettered access? They're all qualified in some\nfashion. Do you agree with that?\nMS. KARLAN: Well, the qualification of hardship\nhas been interpreted by many employers to say, you want to\nbuy a house and you can't otherwise? That's a hardship.\nYou want to sent your kid to school and you can't\notherwise? That's a hardship. You have huge, you know,\nconsumer loans and you could consolidate that? That's a\nhardship. So it's not as if IRA's operate differently\nfrom everything else in the system. That's why --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, yes. You -- you don't\nhave to make up a hardship. You just say I want the\nmoney. Okay, you want the money? Here's the money.\nMS. KARLAN: I think that's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't even have to lie about\nthe hardship. I mean --\n(Laughter.)\nMS. KARLAN: I need the money. I don't have the\nmoney. That's a hardship. If you -- if all you have to\nsay is the magic word hardship, I think that's why we\nwould say IRA's are similar plans or contracts because\nthis Court has made it clear similar is not the same thing\nas identical. So if similar reasons allow you to\nwithdraw, that's enough.\nAnd that's why in section --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In any of these other plans,\ncan you get the money so long as you're willing to pay a\npenalty?\nMS. KARLAN: As I read the New York City --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Without any qualification for\ndisability, illness. No. I just want the money. Give me\nthe money and I'll pay you 10 percent. Is there any plan\nthat works like that?\nMS. KARLAN: I don't know, but the New York City\nPolice Department plan appears to work like that. You can\ntake the money out if you pay the 10 percent penalty.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Has any judge ever taken the\nview that -- adopting Justice Scalia's approach, that\nwhile you can't put the whole IRA -- exempt the whole IRA,\nbut you can exempt 10 percent of it?\nMS. KARLAN: Not to my knowledge.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: At least you ought to get that\nmuch, it seems to me, under his -- his analysis.\nMS. KARLAN: We'd be happier with 10 percent\nthan nothing, but no judge has ever read the statute that\nway.\nThe second point is a point that comes out of\nthis Court's decision last year in the Till case where the\nCourt said, look, you want to pick a manageable line, a\nline that's straightforward and familiar. And here's one\nthat I'll give you that comes directly from the text of\nsection 522(d)(10)(e), which is you should hold that\nsection 522(d)(10)(e) permits the exemption of all plans\nor contracts that qualify under section 401(a), section\n403(a), section 403(b), or section 408 of the Internal\nRevenue Code, which IRA's do.\nAnd this may have led to some of the confusion,\nI think, between counsel in this case, which is in the\nAndersen case, although Ms. Andersen was receiving money\nunder section 408, it was not a 408 individual retirement\naccount. It was, instead, under section 403(b), an\nindividual retirement annuity. So there are, as far as we\nknow, no individual retirement accounts, the things you\nput money into while the money accumulates before you're\nready to retire and you transfer it into an annuity that\nare customizable.\nAnd indeed, for the kinds of debtors who need\nthe protections of section 522(d)(10)(e) the most, the\nunsophisticated people who are putting their money away in\nan IRA because their pension plan either doesn't exist at\nall or isn't adequate for their retirement, the idea that\nthey would understand to go in and negotiate at a bank for\na customizable IRA strikes me as quite implausible.\nThat's why we think the most sensible reading of\nthe statute here is to exempt IRA's when the money in them\nis necessary for the support of the debtor.\nThank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you.\n"
