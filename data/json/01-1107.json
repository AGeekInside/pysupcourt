        "content": "(10:02 a.m.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We'll hear argument now in\nVirginia against Black.\nMr. Hurd, please, you may proceed.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. HURD\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. HURD: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nOur Virginia cross-burning statute protects a\nvery important freedom, freedom from fear, and it does so\nwithout compromising freedom of speech. Our statute does\nnot ban all cross-burning, only cross-burning used to\nthreaten bodily harm. And unlike the ordinance in R.A.V.,\nour statute does not play favorites.\ncross-burning as a tool of intimidation by anyone, against\nanyone, and for any reason. Surely, for all the reasons\nwhy we can ban threats of bodily harm, 100 times over we\ncan ban this exceedingly virulent weapon of fear.\nQUESTION: Mr. Hurd, I -- there's one part of\nthe statute that may be troublesome, and that is the prima\nfacie evidence provision. I suppose you could have a\ncross-burning, for instance, in a play, in a theater,\nsomething like that, which in theory shouldn't violate the\nstatute, but here's the prima facie evidence provision.\nWould you like to comment about that, and in the process,\nwould you tell me if you think it's severable, or what's\nthe story on that --\nMR. HURD: Justice O'Connor, I would like to\ncomment about that. There are three major points I would\nlike to make.\nFirst is the inference is simply a common sense\nrule of evidence. It says that a burning cross may be\npresumed to mean what we all know it ordinarily does mean,\na threat of bodily harm. And so it says no more than what\na prosecutor could argue if the inference were not there.\nQUESTION: And the jury is instructed\naccordingly by the judge?\nMR. HURD: The jury is not required to accept.\nIt's --\nQUESTION: No. Is the jury so instructed by the\njudge?\nMR. HURD: Where the inference is given, yes,\nYour Honor, it -- it is so instructed, and was so\ninstructed in -- in the Black case, though not in the\nElliott case.\nQUESTION: Do we have the instruction that was\ngiven in the Black case?\nMR. HURD: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. It appears in\nthe appendix. The instruction is a burning cross --\nQUESTION: What page? Are you talking about the\njoint appendix?\nMR. HURD: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And where would that be?\nMR. HURD: Instruction number 9 in the joint\nappendix. I apologize for the delay.\nQUESTION: Well, maybe you -- maybe you should\ntell us later, and proceed.\nMR. HURD: On page 146. The burning of a cross\nby itself is sufficient evidence from which you may infer\nthe required intent.\nQUESTION: It didn't say that they -- it just\nsaid the positive, that they could make such an inference.\nMR. HURD: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. It is a\npurely permissive inference.\nburden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that there was\nan intent to intimidate.\nQUESTION: In this -- in the particular cases\nbefore us, what evidence, other than the burning itself,\nwas there to show intimidation?\nMR. HURD: What we had in the case of -- of\nBarry Black was he heard that -- he's from Pennsylvania,\nand he heard that down in Carroll County, blacks and\nwhites were holding hands on the sidewalk. And so they\ncame down. He came down, and they had this event. They\nchose a spot near an open stretch of highway where they\nerected a 30-foot cross. That's as high as these columns.\nAnd they burned it at night with a loudspeaker and talk\nabout taking a .30/.30 and randomly shooting blacks.\nQUESTION: Now, was that -- did that intimidate\neveryone who drove by in their passenger vehicle or --\nlet's put it this way -- racial minorities who drove by in\ntheir passenger vehicle? All of those were intimidated?\nMR. HURD: Whether or not there was actual\nintimidation of minorities who drove by was not clearly\nestablished by the record. There was evidence in the\nrecord that a black family did drive by, pause, saw it,\nand took off at a higher than normal rate of speed.\nQUESTION: Yes, but surely they were in no fear\nof immediate violence, and our -- our Brandenburg line of\ncases says there must be an element of immediacy --\nMR. HURD: Justice Kennedy --\nQUESTION: -- before you can punish speech by\nreason of its content.\nMR. HURD: Brandenburg was an incitement case,\nnot -- not a threat case, although there was a\ncross-burning in Brandenburg --\nQUESTION: Well, then if I -- if I have a\npicture of a burning cross, and I -- and I give it to\nsomebody, that's --\nMR. HURD: No, Your Honor. There has to be a --\na burning cross. In Brandenburg --\nQUESTION: Isn't that because there's an\nimmediacy element to the threat?\nMR. HURD: Well, we believe, Your Honor, that --\nthat if you read into the -- the threat jurisprudence an\nimmediacy element, then -- two points I would make.\nNumber one is that you would -- you would\nconstitutionalize threats when someone said, I'm going to\nkill you, but it won't be for a little while. Surely that\ncan't be the case. A threat, say, against the President\nwould be constitutional so long as the -- the time when\nthe threat was going to be delivered was delayed.\nQUESTION: Well, that -- that may be -- that may\nbe a different -- so -- so in your view if a burning cross\nis just put on a hill outside of the city, everybody in\nthe city can be deemed intimidated?\nMR. HURD: Not necessarily, Your Honor. The --\nthe burning cross carries not merely a message of\nintimidation, but -- a -- a threat of bodily harm, but a\nthreat of bodily harm soon to arrive. Now, the --\nQUESTION: Why doesn't Virginia just have a\nstatute making it a crime to threaten bodily harm that's\nsoon to arrive --\nMR. HURD: Well, we --\nQUESTION: -- burning cross or not?\nMR. HURD: We could have such a statute, Your\nHonor, but the -- the availability of other options does\nnot mean the option we have chosen is unconstitutional.\nQUESTION: Do other States have criminal\nstatutes that have the broad-based intimidation\nprohibition that I've just described?\nMR. HURD: Your Honor, some -- some very well\nmay. Again --\nQUESTION: I have not found one.\nMR. HURD: Respectfully, that -- that event\nwould not -- would not be the test we believe established\nby this Court in R.A.V.\nMoreover, Your Honor, there's a -- there's a\ndown side to having a broad statute, and it is this. That\nwhenever you prohibit a proscribable category of speech,\nthere will be a -- a zone of protected speech that looks a\nlot like the proscribed category and in which people must\nbe somewhat careful or they may be arrested mistakenly, as\nhappened with Mr. Watts in the Watts case.\nQUESTION: I thought the key here is that this\nis not just speech. It is not just speech. It's action\nthat -- that is intended to convey a message.\nMR. HURD: It is --\nQUESTION: Surely -- surely your State could\nmake it unlawful to brandish -- brandish an automatic\nweapon with the intent of -- of intimidating somebody,\ncouldn't it?\nMR. HURD: Justice Scalia, we -- we have\nstatutes that prohibit brandishing of firearms. In fact,\na -- a burning cross is very much like a brandishing of a\nfirearm.\nQUESTION: That's your point.\nMR. HURD: It is virtually -- it is virtually\na -- a present offer of force. That makes it an\nespecially virulent form of -- of intimidation.\nLet me, if I may, come back to Justice\nO'Connor's point about the inference. Justice O'Connor,\nyou asked whether the inference could be struck down,\nsevered.\nabsolutely. If this Court were to decide it was\nproblematic, under Virginia law, as we cite in our briefs,\nit is -- it is severable. We have a general severability\nstatute in Virginia so that if the Court were not to agree\nwith us that this inference is constitutional, it should\nnot declare the entire statute invalid, but should sever\nthe inference and remand these cases for further action.\nQUESTION: Well, just to make it clear, anytime\nin Virginia a burning cross is put near a highway, that is\nan -- a criminal offense.\nMR. HURD: Your Honor, it is a criminal offense\nto burn a cross with intent to intimidate. Now, what --\nQUESTION: Even on your own property.\nQUESTION: No, not on your own --\nMR. HURD: On your own property if it is a -- a\npublic place. A public place is defined in our statute --\nactually on a jury instruction -- as being not public\nownership, but public view.\nQUESTION: And intimidate means to cause fear of\nviolence at some unspecified time in the future --\nMR. HURD: To -- to --\nQUESTION: -- from some unspecified people.\nMR. HURD: To instill fear of -- of bodily harm.\nThe specificity of the people is not hard to figure out.\nIt's whoever burns the cross is the one who is delivering\nthe threat. Justice Kennedy, there -- there are --\nQUESTION: May I ask -- may I ask you a question\non -- about instruction 9 to which you called our\nattention? It says, the court instructs the jury that the\nburning of a cross by itself is sufficient evidence from\nwhich you may infer the required intent. Does that mean\nit is sufficient beyond a reasonable doubt by which you\ncan do it?\nMR. HURD: Certainly the jury could, by this\ninstruction, by the burning cross infer -- infer guilt.\nQUESTION: So that in -- in a case in which\nthere was a cross burned out in the middle of a desert\nsomewhere, and that's all that's proved, that would be\nenough to sustain the conviction.\nMR. HURD: That would be enough to -- to get you\npast a motion to strike. Of course, sustaining a --\nQUESTION: Let's say there's no -- the defendant\nputs in no evidence, just rests on the -- on -- on just\nremains mute. He could be convicted on it in that case,\nI think.\nMR. HURD: If the instruction were given, he\ncould be convicted. Of course, in this case, we have more\nthan a burning cross. And his -- his argument, Your\nHonor --\nQUESTION: I understand that. But then my next\nquestion is -- I'm asking about whether there's content\ndiscrimination. Supposing he burned a -- a circle, he\ncould not be convicted on the same evidence.\nMR. HURD: He could not. A burning circle,\nunlike a burning cross, carries no particular message.\nAnd, Justice Stevens, I would -- I would point\nout that where this Court has previously struck down\nevidentiary inferences, it has done so under the Due\nProcess Clause.\nQUESTION: In the case of a desert, he's out in\nthe desert, and he's burning the cross for symbolic\npurposes and nobody else is around. I guess wouldn't the\njudge have to set aside the conviction on -- on First\nAmendment grounds.\nMR. HURD: Justice Breyer, absolutely.\nThere's -- there's -- the General Assembly chose this word\nvery carefully when it said a prima facie case. The State\nsupreme court was very careful when they said, based on\nthat language, it would survive a motion to strike, but\nthere's no attempt in the statute to preclude the kind of\nindependent post-conviction review as required in First\nAmendment cases.\nSo absolutely in that case, if -- if -- first of\nall, if the police made an arrest, which is doubtful, and\nif it was prosecuted, which is doubtful, and if the jury\nfound guilt, which is doubtful, then the court could in\nthat case and should in that case vacate the conviction.\nQUESTION: Well, that -- that's fine if you use\nthe term prima facie case, which is what the statute says.\nBut the instruction here said the burning of a cross by\nitself is sufficient evidence from which you may infer the\nrequired intent. And you think that's an accurate -- an\naccurate conveyance to the jury of what is meant by prima\nfacie case.\nMR. HURD: The -- the -- that obviously was not\nthe only instruction given, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: I understand.\nMR. HURD: There was also instructions given\nthat -- that required the prosecution to prove its case\nbeyond a -- a reasonable doubt. And --\nQUESTION: But -- but then it goes on to say the\nburning of a cross is sufficient evidence from which you\nmay infer the -- the required intent.\nMR. HURD: May, but -- but need not necessarily.\nQUESTION: Need -- no, not necessarily. But\nthat seems to me to be much more than what you now\ndescribe as the consequence of a prima facie case.\nJust -- just one that gets you past a -- a motion to\ndismiss.\nMR. HURD:\nQUESTION: It says it's sufficient evidence to\nfind it if -- if that's all you --\nMR. HURD: And Justice Scalia, if there were a\nproblem with that instruction, it would be in our view\na -- a due process problem, not a First Amendment problem.\nQUESTION: Well, I thought there would be a\nFirst Amendment problem in the unusual hypothetical\ninstance of the desert, where they gave this instruction\nand the very thirsty jury convicted the person under this\ninstruction. Were that to happen, then that might violate\nthe First Amendment since there was no evidence in the\ncase that this was going to intimidate a person, and the\nonly basis for a conviction would have been the\ninstruction of the State. And under those circumstances,\nI guess the State instruction permitting conviction would\nviolate the First Amendment.\nQUESTION: In other words, every due process\nviolation in a First Amendment case is a First Amendment\nviolation.\nQUESTION: Not necessarily.\nQUESTION: But that's quite a far --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HURD: Justice Scalia, Justice Breyer, in\nany event that very unusual case would present an\nas-applied challenge.\nQUESTION: May I ask you --\nQUESTION: I agree it's unusual.\nQUESTION: -- about a more -- a more -- case of\nimmediate concern? You have said that the cross --\nburning cross is a symbol like no other. And so this is a\nself-contained category. What about other things that are\nassociated with the Klan? For example, the white robes\nand the mask? Are they also symbols that the State can\nban, or is there something about the burning cross that\nmakes it unique?\nMR. HURD: Justice Ginsburg, there -- there are\nseveral things about the burning cross that make it\nunique.\nFirst, it is the symbol that the Klan has used\nto -- to threaten bodily harm. The connection, if you\nwill, in our history is -- is between the burning cross\nand ensuing violence, not so much between people wearing\nwhite sheets and ensuing violence.\nQUESTION: Isn't there a Federal statute that\nmakes it -- makes it an offense to go on the highway\nwearing a -- wearing a sheet?\nQUESTION: In disguise.\nMR. HURD: And going in disguise on the highway\nwith a particular intent -- I believe there is. And we\nhave a statute in -- in Virginia.\nOne of the things -- let me -- let me make this\npoint about the burning cross --\nQUESTION: I -- I --\nMR. HURD: -- and why it's -- why it's unique.\nQUESTION: You're saying it's not unique then if\nyou could also make going on the highway in disguise a\ncrime.\nMR. HURD: Well, I think going on the highway in\ndisguise is -- is a different kind of -- of concern.\nIt's -- it's the same kind of concern that might, in a\nvariety of cases, prevent people from disguising their\nidentity from -- from law enforcement.\nBut in terms of -- of delivering symbols and\ndelivering threats, it really is unique. It says -- it\nsays, we're close at hand. We don't just talk. We act.\nAnd it deliberately invokes the precedent of 87 years of\ncross-burning as a tool of intimidation.\nBurn anything else. Burn the flag. Burn a\nsheet. The message is opposition to the thing that the\nsymbol unburned represents. Burning a cross is not\nopposition to Christianity. The message is a threat of\nbodily harm, and it -- it is unique. And it's not simply\na message of bigotry. It's a message that -- that whoever\nhas it in their hands, a message of bodily harm is coming.\nThat is the primary message --\nQUESTION: It sounds to me like you're defending\nthe statute on the ground that the message that this\nparticular act conveys is particularly obnoxious.\nMR. HURD: Obnoxious. Justice Stevens, we have\na lot of obnoxious speech, and it's all perfectly fine.\nThis is not obnoxious speech. This is a -- a threat of\nbodily harm.\nJustice Souter made the point in the concurrence\nin -- in Hill v. Colorado the Government may punish\ncertain types of expressive conduct even though that\nconduct is associated with a particular point of view.\nThose who burn draft cards typically oppose the draft.\nThose who engage in sidewalk counseling typically oppose\nabortion. But we can oppose restrictions on those\nactivities.\nSimilarly, we can ban cross burning as a tool of\nintimidation even though many people who practice\ncross-burning may also carry with that cross-burning some\nmessage of bigotry. But the primary message -- the\nfundamental message is a threat of bodily harm.\nAnd this is not something that we just made up.\nCross-burning has that message because for decades the\nKlan wanted it to have that message because they wanted\nthat tool of intimidation. And so it rings a little\nhollow when the Klan comes to court and complains that our\nlaw treats that message -- treats that burning cross as\nhaving exactly the message that they for decades have\nwanted it to have.\nAnd so, we do believe that our statute is -- is\nquite constitutional. They may have a political rally\nwith a burning cross, but what they cannot do is use a\nKlan ceremony as a way to smuggle through real threats of\nbodily harm with a specific intent to intimidate. That is\nwhat happened in the Barry Black case, as the jury found.\nThe sufficiency of the evidence in that case has -- has\nnot been contested.\nFor these reasons, we would ask the Court to\nreverse the decision below and, Justice Stevens, I'd like\nto reserve the balance of my time.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Hurd.\nMr. Dreeben.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. DREEBEN: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and\nmay it please the Court:\nVirginia has singled out cross-burning with the\nintent to intimidate because it is a particularly\nthreatening form of such conduct. History has revealed\nthat cross-burning has been used as a tool to intimidate\nand put people in fear of bodily violence in a way that no\nother symbol has been used.\nQUESTION: Does it fall under the fighting words\nnotion, or is it a separate category of constitutionally\nproscribable speech do you suppose?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice O'Connor, our analysis of\nthe intimidation element is that it's akin to a threat to\nput somebody in bodily harm. And as such --\nQUESTION: Is it -- is it a defense under the\nstatute for someone to prove that they didn't intend to\nthreaten anyone, but just purely to express a viewpoint?\nMR. DREEBEN: Apart from the presumption or\nprima facie case provision that Your Honor called\nattention to earlier, the prohibitory language of the\nstatute does not reach cross-burning when it is done\nsolely for the point of expressing a particular view.\nQUESTION: And how -- how do you look at the\nstatute in light of the prima facie evidence provision?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice O'Connor, it raises\nseparate issues that are distinct from whether a\ncross-burning statute can single out that particular\nactivity and prohibit it on the basis of its\nthreatening --\nQUESTION: But that's part of this statute that\nwe have to look at, isn't it?\nMR. DREEBEN: It is, but the Virginia Supreme\nCourt approached the issue by first asking whether the\ncross-burning provision, insofar as it targeted\ncross-burning --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. DREEBEN: -- ran afoul of this Court's\ndecision in R.A.V., and it only then turned to the prima\nfacie case provision --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. DREEBEN: -- and concluded that it rendered\nthe statute overbroad.\nThe United States has not taken a position on\nthe validity of the prima facie case provision, which does\nraise distinct issues because it could allow a jury in\ncertain instances to infer solely from the act of\ncross-burning, without any other evidence at all --\nQUESTION: And that was the instruction given\nhere.\nMR. DREEBEN: That was the instruction given in\none of the two cases. In the Elliott case, there was no\ninstruction --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. DREEBEN: -- whatsoever on the prima facie\ncase provision, and so Elliott's case is somewhat\nsimilar -- differently situated from -- from the Black\ncase.\nBut a cross-burning statute like this functions\nnot like a fighting words statute which seeks to avert\nbreaches of the peace by the use of particularly obnoxious\nlanguage that would induce anybody to strike back with a\nviolent reaction. It functions instead on the theory that\na signal to violence, or a warning that violence will come\nis not protected within the First Amendment. It is a\nprohibited form of conduct, and when done as here by an\nact of putting a flaming cross in a place with the intent\nto actually put somebody in fear of bodily harm, it's not\na form of protected conduct that directly implicates the\nFirst Amendment. It's --\nQUESTION: Is it -- is it unlawful in Virginia\nto put somebody in fear of bodily harm in some other\nfashion, not to burn a cross, but to say I'm going to\nlynch you? Is that -- is that unlawful in Virginia?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, my understanding\nof Virginia law is that it has a -- a written threats\nstatute which would cover any threat of any kind in\nwriting, but it does not have a general intimidation or\nthreat statute that would reach other means of oral\nexpression.\nQUESTION: It's sort of peculiar, isn't it?\nMR. DREEBEN:\ntake something which has historically been used as a\nparticularly dangerous means of intimidation because it\nhas so often been followed up by actual violence and\nestablish a prohibition that is limited to that. Rather\nthan sweeping in other classes of speech that may raise\nquestions when you come close to the line of whether it is\nor isn't intimidating and therefore might chill free\nexpression, Virginia has chosen to focus on what conduct\noccurred within its borders that caused particular harms.\nAnd what --\nQUESTION: Was -- was there a common law of\nintimidation, a tort -- a tort that went beyond assault?\nMR. DREEBEN: There is a common law of -- of\nputting somebody in fear of bodily harm through the tort\nlaw. And there were similarly antecedent criminal\nprovisions that are --\nQUESTION: Is there -- is there an immediacy\ncomponent to that as there is with assaults?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, there is not, Justice Kennedy,\nand it's crucial to underscore why that is. The harms\nthat can be brought about by threat statutes are not only\nputting somebody in fear of bodily harm and thereby\ndisrupting their movements, but providing a signal that\nthe violence may actually occur. It may not occur\ntomorrow, the next day, or next week, but it's like a\nsword of Damocles hanging over the person whose head --\nwho has been threatened. And in that sense it creates a\npervasive fear that can be ongoing for a considerable\namount of time.\nQUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, aren't you understating\nthe -- the effects of -- of the burning cross? This\nstatute was passed in what year?\nMR. DREEBEN: 1952 originally.\nQUESTION: Now, it's my understanding that we\nhad almost 100 years of lynching and activity in the South\nby the Knights of Camellia and -- and the Ku Klux Klan,\nand this was a reign of terror and the cross was a symbol\nof that reign of terror. Was -- isn't that significantly\ngreater than intimidation or a threat?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I think they're coextensive,\nJustice Thomas, because it is --\nQUESTION: Well, my fear is, Mr. Dreeben, that\nyou're actually understating the symbolism on -- of and\nthe effect of the cross, the burning cross. I --\nI indicated, I think, in the Ohio case that the cross was\nnot a religious symbol and that it has -- it was intended\nto have a virulent effect. And I -- I think that what\nyou're attempting to do is to fit this into our\njurisprudence rather than stating more clearly what the\ncross was intended to accomplish and, indeed, that it is\nunlike any symbol in our society.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I don't mean to understate\nit, and I entirely agree with Your Honor's description of\nhow the cross has been used as an instrument of\nintimidation against minorities in this country. That has\njustified 14 States in treating it as a distinctive --\nQUESTION: Well, it's -- it's actually more than\nminorities. There's certain groups.\nAnd I -- I just -- my fear is that the -- there\nwas no other purpose to the cross. There was no\ncommunication of a particular message. It was intended to\ncause fear --\nMR. DREEBEN: It --\nQUESTION: -- and to terrorize a population.\nMR. DREEBEN: It absolutely was, and for that\nreason can be legitimately proscribed without fear that\nthe focusing on a cross -- burning of a cross with the\nintent to intimidate would chill protected expression.\nThis is a very different case than the R.A.V.\ncase that was before the Court. There the Court was\nconfronted with a statute that prohibited the use of\nlanguage based on particular messages of group-based\nhatred. And in singling out speech based on the content,\nthe State was expressing disagreement with particular\nmessages.\nIn the Virginia statute, and in the other\nstatutes that the States have, the focus is not on any\nparticular message. It is on the effect of intimidation,\nand the intent to create a climate of fear and, as Justice\nThomas has said, a climate of terror.\nQUESTION: So your argument would be the same\neven if we assumed that the capacity of the cross to\nconvey this message was limited to certain groups, blacks,\nCatholics, or whatnot.\nMR. DREEBEN: I would, Justice Souter, and I\nthink it's for the reason that Your Honor pointed out in\nhis concurrence in Hill versus Colorado. Merely because a\nparticular activity might have become the signature of a\ncertain ideological group does not prevent the State from\naddressing and regulating what is proscribable about that\nactivity.\nQUESTION: But it seems to me from this\nargument, if the message is as powerful as Justice Thomas\nsuggests it is -- and I'm sure he's -- he's right about\nthat -- why is it necessary to go beyond the message\nitself? Why -- why wouldn't it still be proscribable even\nif the person burning it didn't realize all of this\nhistory, just did it innocently, but it nevertheless had\nthat effect?\nMR. DREEBEN:\nQUESTION: Why do you need the intent?\nMR. DREEBEN: I think that would raise a much\nmore difficult question because notwithstanding the fact\nthat there is a very powerful linkage in our society such\nthat the State is justified in singling out the cross, it\nmay be that under certain contexts, a particular\nindividual is attempting to express a message rather than\nattempting to intimidate.\nAnd it -- it is important to note that merely\nexpressing a message of race-based hatred is not something\nthat the State can proscribe --\nQUESTION: Surely -- surely one can burn a cross\nin the sanctity of one's bedroom. Right?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DREEBEN: There -- there are -- there are\nhypothetical cases that one can imagine, the desert, the\nbedroom --\nQUESTION: No, but my assumption is that the\ngeographic scope of the statute is just like this statute.\nIt doesn't apply to your own property, but on anyone\nelse's property, or in public view. If the message is as\npowerful as -- as we're assuming as it is, why isn't that\na sufficient basis for just banning it?\nMR. DREEBEN: It might well be, Justice Stevens,\nbut I think that a law that is more tailored, as this one\nis, and reaches those acts of cross-burning where it is\nthe very intent of the actor to put a person or group of\npeople in fear of bodily harm makes it quite clear that\na -- that statute aims at the proscribable feature of that\nconduct and not at the protected feature, namely\nrace-based hatred.\nQUESTION: But if you can infer the -- the\nintent to intimidate just from the act, even when this is\ndone on one's own property, as it was in one of these\ncases, doesn't that go beyond the line, if -- if you --\ncross-burning on your own property?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Stevens, may I answer?\nJustice Ginsburg, the inference provision is\nproblematic because it does raise the potential that a\nwholly protected act of cross-burning, which this Court\nmight find within the scope of the First Amendment, could\nserve as the exclusive source of evidence from which a\nconviction could be rendered for unprotected conduct. And\nit's for that reason that most States don't have any sort\nof analogous provision. The Federal Government doesn't,\nand it raises distinct problems from the targeting focus\nof the law that's at issue here.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Dreeben.\nMr. Smolla, we'll -- we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF RODNEY A. SMOLLA\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. SMOLLA: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nAt the heart of our argument is that when the\nState targets a particular symbol or a particular symbolic\nritual, it engages in content and viewpoint discrimination\nof the type forbidden by the First Amendment.\nQUESTION: What -- what about the symbol of\nbrandishing an automatic weapon in -- in somebody's face?\nMR. SMOLLA: Justice Scalia, I think --\nQUESTION: You're next.\nMR. SMOLLA: I think that a core element of our\nargument is that there is a fundamental First Amendment\ndifference between brandishing a cross, and brandishing a\ngun. The physical properties of the gun as a weapon add\npotency to the threat, and so if the State makes a threat\ncommitted with a firearm an especially heinous type of\nthreat, it is acting within the confines of what is\npermissible under R.A.V. because it is creating a subclass\nof threat and defining that subclass of threat for the\nsame reasons that allow it to define the outer perimeter\nof threat law, things going to the danger posed by that\nthreat.\nBut the properties of the cross are not physical\nproperties, and the burning element of a burning cross are\nnot what communicate the threat.\nQUESTION: But is -- isn't the -- isn't your\nargument an argument that would have been sound before the\ncross, in effect, acquired the history that it has? If we\nwere in the year 1820, and you had a choice between\nsomebody brandishing the loaded gun, and somebody\nbrandishing a cross and nobody knew how the cross had been\nused because it had not been used, your argument, it seems\nto me, would be -- would be a winning one.\nHow does your argument account for that fact\nthat the cross has acquired a potency which I would\nsuppose is at least as equal to that of the gun?\nMR. SMOLLA: Justice Souter, I think that our\nargument is that in fact it works the reverse way, that\nwhat the cross and the burning cross have acquired as a\nkind of secondary meaning, somewhat akin to the way that\ntrademarks acquire secondary meaning in intellectual\nproperty law, are a multiplicity of messages. Undoubtedly\na burning cross identified as -- as effectively the\ntrademark of the Ku Klux Klan carries horrible\nconnotations of terrorism of the kind --\nQUESTION: But it -- it carries something else,\ndoesn't it? Isn't it not merely a -- a trademark that has\nacquired a meaning? Isn't it also a kind of Pavlovian\nsignal so that when that signal is given, the natural\nhuman response is not recognition of a message, but fear?\nMR. SMOLLA: No, Your Honor. Respectfully\nI think that that overstates what is being communicated.\nAny symbol in its pristine state that has gathered\nreverence in our society -- the American flag, the Star of\nDavid, the cross, the symbols of government -- is a\npowerful, emotional symbol in -- in its revered state.\nQUESTION: But they don't make -- they don't\nmake you scared, and if you start -- for your own safety.\nAnd if you start with the proposition that State can, in\nfact, prevent threats that scare people reasonably -- for\ntheir own safety, this is in a separate category from\nsimply a -- a symbol that has acquired a potent meaning.\nQUESTION: I dare say --\nMR. SMOLLA: Your Honor, the word scared is\nimportant in answering your question because it's -- it's\nwhat we mean by being scared, or what we mean by being\nintimidated. If I see a burning cross, my stomach may\nchurn. I may feel a sense of loathing, disgust, a vague\nsense of --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. SMOLLA: -- of being intimidated because I\nassociate it --\nQUESTION: How about a cross -- how about a\ncross --\nMR. SMOLLA: But that's not fear of bodily harm.\nQUESTION: How about a cross on your lawn?\nQUESTION: Yes. I dare say that you would\nrather see a man with a -- with a rifle on your front\nlawn -- If you were a black man at night, you'd rather see\na man with a rifle than see a burning cross on your front\nlawn.\nMR. SMOLLA: Your Honor, I concede that.\nHowever -- however --\nQUESTION: The whole purpose of that is -- is to\nterrorize.\nMR. SMOLLA: -- as -- as powerful as that point\nis -- and I totally accept it, and totally accept the\nhistory that Justice Thomas has -- has recounted, and that\nthe United States recounts in its brief as accurate. As\npowerful as all of those points are, there's not a single\ninterest that society seeks to protect in protecting that\nvictim that cannot be vindicated perfectly as well,\nexactly as well with no fall-off at all, by\ncontent-neutral alternatives, not merely general\nrun-of-the-mill threat laws, or incitement laws, or\nintimidation laws which may have an antiseptic and sterile\nquality about them. You can go even beyond that --\nQUESTION: But why isn't this just a regulation\nof a particularly virulent form of intimidation? And why\ncan't the State regulate such things?\nMR. SMOLLA: Your Honor, it is not a\nparticularly virulent form of intimidation.\nQUESTION: Well, it is for the very reasons\nwe've explored this morning. What if I think it is? Why\ncan't the State regulate it?\nMR. SMOLLA: Because, Justice O'Connor, it is\nalso an especially virulent form of expression on ideas\nrelating to race, religion, politics --\nQUESTION: You were -- you were saying that the\nState can go -- doesn't have to have a sterile law on\nintimidation. It can go further, but not as far as this.\nWhat --\nMR. SMOLLA: Justice --\nQUESTION: What is this midpoint?\nMR. SMOLLA: Justice Kennedy, it is the\nWisconsin versus Mitchell bias enhancement-style model\nwhere the interest of the State goes beyond just\npreventing physical crime. It goes to preventing racism,\nacts of violence, threats, intimidation that are done out\nof bias and animus. That captures the fullness of all the\nconceivable State interests that there could possibly\nbe --\nQUESTION: Well, that was in conjunction with an\nactual physical assault.\nMR. SMOLLA: But -- but, Your Honor, in any\ninstance in which the State were operating upon some\nconduct that it is constitutionally permissible to\nproscribe, such as a threat, the State could then enhance\nthe penalty. If you threaten out of racial animus, you\nget double the penalty, triple the penalty. And that\nwould work in any cross-burning case --\nQUESTION: Suppose -- suppose if you threaten by\nuse of a cross -- burning cross, would that be a specific\nstatutory category that allows the penalty be -- to be\nenhanced?\nMR. SMOLLA: Yes, Your Honor, and even more --\nQUESTION: Well, how can you have a statutory\ncategory which enhances the penalty that you can't also\nuse to -- to describe the underlying offense?\nMR. SMOLLA: The -- the answer to that question,\nJustice Kennedy, lies in Wisconsin versus Mitchell where\nthis Court held that the mere evidentiary use of speech to\nprove intent does not implicate the First Amendment. And\nalthough the line is thin, it is gigantic in terms of our\nFirst Amendment values. It is the difference --\nQUESTION: Well, let me ask you this. Supposing\nyou have a statute that prohibits intimidation by burning\ncircles, any -- any design of any kind, and the maximum\npenalty is a year in jail, but if you burn a cross, it's\n2 years in jail. Would that be permissible?\nMR. SMOLLA: It would not be permissible, Your\nHonor, and the reason it --\nQUESTION: And -- and it's --\nMR. SMOLLA: -- would not be permissible is the\ncross has acquired this meaning as an ideological symbol.\nQUESTION: Because it's content-based\ndiscrimination within the category of activity that can be\nentirely proscribed.\nMR. SMOLLA: That is precisely our argument.\nQUESTION: Now, is there any support for that\nproposition other than the majority opinion in R.A.V.?\nMR. SMOLLA: Your Honor, R.A.V. is the only case\nthat dealt squarely with this puzzle of what happens when\nyou're dealing with a category of speech that you have the\nright to proscribe, and then you draw gratuitous content-\nor viewpoint-based distinctions within it.\nHowever, Justice Stevens, I would say that it\nisn't alone in this Court's powerful condemnation of\nviewpoint discrimination, and a key element to this\nCourt's First Amendment history is that we don't want to\ncut matters too finely.\nQUESTION: What was involved in R.A.V.? Was\nit -- was it activity? What kind of activity was\ninvolved.\nMR. SMOLLA: Well, the -- the fact pattern in\nR.A.V. was identical to one of the fact patterns here. It\nwas going on to the yard of an African-American family --\nQUESTION: Yes --\nMR. SMOLLA: -- and burning a cross in the\nmiddle of the night, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Yes, but what was made a crime was\nthe burning it with a particular motivation, wasn't it?\nMR. SMOLLA: The -- the --\nQUESTION: It wasn't the mere act.\nMR. SMOLLA: And -- and at the core of our\nargument, Justice Scalia, is the claim that the concept of\nviewpoint discrimination is, and ought to be broad enough\nto encompass not only viewpoint discrimination articulated\nlinguistically, the way that it was done in the statute in\nR.A.V., but also viewpoint discrimination through the\nsingling out of a symbol because symbols acquire meaning\nin precisely the same way that words acquire meaning.\nQUESTION: But words -- words are even more.\nI mean, your argument applies a fortiori to words. Right?\nMR. SMOLLA: It does, Justice Breyer.\nQUESTION: I guess you could have statutes, if\nthe need were great, that forbid you from using certain\nwords with a certain intent like, for example,\nimpersonating somebody or -- or counterfeiting, or -- I\nmean, if -- I've never heard of a case which said you\ncouldn't have a statute that in -- if the circumstances\nwere right, forbid a person to use certain words.\nMR. SMOLLA: Justice Breyer, the -- the First\nAmendment speaks to this, and -- and it's --\nQUESTION: You can't have that? To have a\nstatute that says --\nMR. SMOLLA: In fact --\nQUESTION: -- you cannot say I am the President\nwith the intent to confuse people that I'm the President,\nI mean, that would be unconstitutional.\nMR. SMOLLA: The -- the normal -- the normal\nlegislative process, Justice Breyer, is not to name the\nwords, not to put in the statute if you utter these --\nQUESTION: I know that's not normal. I -- I --\nthat's why --\nMR. SMOLLA: -- but to describe -- but to\ndescribe the conduct that you are attempting to get at,\nand then various combinations of words may fit into it.\nBut let's take the example of naming a set of\nwords. Even that is enormously problematic for First\nAmendment purposes.\nQUESTION: It is a crime to impersonate the\nGreat Seal of the United States --\nMR. SMOLLA: The --\nQUESTION: -- for purposes of obtaining money.\nIt violates the First Amendment.\nMR. SMOLLA: But -- but the -- but the -- it\ncould, Your Honor, in -- in an appropriate circumstance.\nTake --\nQUESTION: In other words, all it -- all it --\nall you're saying is that heightened scrutiny applies.\nMR. SMOLLA: We are certainly saying that,\nand --\nQUESTION: That's all you're saying. You can't\npossibly say more than that once you acknowledge that --\nthat symbols can be proscribed.\nMR. SMOLLA: We -- we say that --\nQUESTION: And so the question before us is\nwhether burning a cross is such a terrorizing symbol in\nAmerican -- in American culture that even on the basis of\nheightened scrutiny, it's okay to proscribe it. That's\nbasically the --\nMR. SMOLLA: That is a -- that is a fair\ncharacterization of the question. And -- and accepting\nstrict scrutiny as the -- the test here, but strict\nscrutiny we would argue bumped up a bit in its intensity\nif this is viewpoint discrimination because --\nQUESTION: Well, why shouldn't we apply --\nMR. SMOLLA:\nviewpoint --\nQUESTION: -- the O'Brien test? Why -- why some\ntougher test than that here?\nMR. SMOLLA: Your Honor, whether you apply\nO'Brien or strict scrutiny, it's our submission we win\nbecause when you get to the point at which you look at\nalternatives, there are content-neutral alternatives that\nwork perfectly as well.\nBut to answer directly your question, Justice\nO'Connor, this Court has never allowed the use of the\nO'Brien test or any of the cousins of O'Brien, such as the\nsecondary effects doctrine or time, place, or manner\njurisprudence, when the harm that the government seeks to\nprevent is a harm that flows from the communicative impact\nof the expression.\nAnd there is no getting around the fact that the\nharm the government seeks to prevent here indubitably\nflows only from the formation of this symbol. If I --\nQUESTION: So I would think then that if the\ntest suggests that you cannot have a statute which says\nyou cannot use the words, I'll kill you, with an intent to\nkill somebody or threaten him, then there's something\nwrong with the test, not that there's something wrong with\nthe statute. That's --\nMR. SMOLLA:\nwords -- take the words, if you do that again, I swear\nI'll kill you. Those words in a given context might be\nbreakfast banter, might be a joke.\nQUESTION: Correct, they might.\nMR. SMOLLA: It might be something a teacher --\nQUESTION: So what we put in the --\nMR. SMOLLA: -- says to a student, or might be a\ntrue objective threat. And the -- a core element of this\nCourt's commitment to freedom of speech has been to\nseparate abstract advocacy from palpable harm.\nQUESTION: -- fails to do that.\nQUESTION: If it's intended to be --\nQUESTION: -- the requirement of intent.\nQUESTION: -- a threat, you can get it. Right?\nMR. SMOLLA: Pardon me, Your Honor?\nQUESTION: You're saying if it's intended to be\na threat, it can proscribed.\nMR. SMOLLA: If it meets the Watts true threats\ntest, it -- it is permissible. This law -- this law,\nhowever, is a fusion of true threat law, and a gratuitous\naddition to the true threat law, cross-burning. The law\nwould have been --\nQUESTION: Mr. -- Mr. Smolla --\nMR. SMOLLA: -- perfectly sufficient --\nQUESTION:\nsufficient laws, we have in the appendix to the United\nStates brief several laws. They don't mention\ncross-burnings. Are all those adequate under your test?\nWould they be constitutional?\nMR. SMOLLA: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. The Federal\nmodel, for example. There are a variety of Federal civil\nrights laws that punish conduct that the United States\nuses routinely to punish acts of cross-burning are\nperfectly permissible.\nAnd the difference, which is enormous for First\nAmendment purposes, is that both at the front end of that\nlegislation and at the back end, there is breathing space\nfor the First Amendment. It's important to remember that\nour First Amendment jurisprudence is not just about\ndeliberate censorship and realized censorship. It is also\nabout possibility, about chilling effect, and about\nbreathing -- about breathing space.\nIn effect, in Virginia --\nQUESTION: But this statute --\nMR. SMOLLA: -- you burn a cross at your peril.\nQUESTION: -- this statute incorporates the\nintent to intimidate feature.\nMR. SMOLLA: That is true, Justice O'Connor, but\neven if it does, the learning of R.A.V., we'd submit, is\nthat that alone does not rest in the statute.\nQUESTION: Well, this --\nMR. SMOLLA: A law can't be half constitutional.\nQUESTION: -- this seems to fall within the\nfirst exception mentioned in R.A.V. This does address\nconduct and with a certain intent. I mean, to apply\nR.A.V. is to extend R.A.V.\nMR. SMOLLA: Your Honor, it's our submission\nthat in fact the two cases are identical, and the reason\nthey don't seem identical perhaps is that it is harder --\nit is harder -- to locate the viewpoint and content\ndiscrimination in our minds when we think of the burning\ncross than when we think of the language of R.A.V., which\ntalked about anger or resentment on the basis of race,\ncolor, creed. And that may well be because of the kind of\nPavlovian connection that you have identified where we\nfeel this loathing, and we feel this -- this generalized\nfear when we see the sight of the burning cross.\nBut our point is that ought never be sufficient\nbecause even if at a given moment in time, you could take\nsome symbol and freeze it and you could say at this second\nthis symbol always seems associated with violence --\nimagine you had a terrorist group that was on a serial\nkilling spree and every time they committed an act of\nviolence, they left a little calling card, and that symbol\nbecame a terribly frightening --\nQUESTION: Well, I guess what -- you have a very\ninteresting point. And as I've been thinking about it, it\nseems to me that the -- a difficulty, possible difficulty\nwith it is that the First Amendment doesn't protect words.\nIt protects use of words for certain purposes. And it\ndoesn't protect, for example, a -- a symbol. It protects\na thing that counts as a symbol when used for symbolic\npurposes.\nMR. SMOLLA: That's correct.\nQUESTION: So just as it doesn't protect the\nwords, I will kill you, but protects them when used in a\nplay, but not when used as a threat --\nMR. SMOLLA: That is correct.\nQUESTION: -- so it doesn't protect the burning\nof the cross when used as a threat --\nMR. SMOLLA: That is correct.\nQUESTION: -- and not as a symbol.\nMR. SMOLLA: That is -- that --\nQUESTION: And now we have a statute that says\nyou can use it as a symbol, but you can't use it as a\nthreat. And therefore, the First Amendment doesn't apply.\nMR. SMOLLA: And -- and --\nQUESTION: Now, if that's the right analysis,\nthen what's your response?\nMR. SMOLLA:\nyou said up until the very end --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SMOLLA: -- we would not accept.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SMOLLA: I have a -- I have a hunch I have\nto at least say that much.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SMOLLA: And -- and, Justice Breyer, it\ncomes to this, that you cannot make the judgment that this\nlaw in its actual impact only penalizes those acts of\ncross-burning that result in threat. It certainly chills,\nJustice Breyer, a wide range of expression, as it did in\nthis case, that cannot plausibly be understood as a threat\nof bodily harm in any realistic sense.\nEvery time the Ku Klux Klan conducts one of its\nrallies, at the height of its rally, it burns a large\ncross, and it plays a hymn such as the Old Rugged Cross,\nor Onward Christian Soldiers or Amazing Grace, and this is\na ritual that it engages in. Now, it is inconceivable --\nthere is absolutely nothing in this record that says that\nevery time the Klan does that, that is, in fact, a true\nthreat.\nQUESTION: No, it isn't, so long as the Klan\ndoesn't do it in -- in sight of a public highway, or on\nsomebody else's property, there's not a chance that this\nstatute would apply to them.\nMR. SMOLLA: Your Honor, but the --\nQUESTION: They have to do in sight of a public\nhighway?\nMR. SMOLLA: The -- the -- all the statute\nrequires is that it be visible to others. And of course,\nthe First Amendment value here in our view is that speech,\nparticularly disturbing and offensive speech that runs\ncontrary to our -- our mainstream values that the majority\nof us embrace, is ineffective unless it is put out to the\nworld where others can see it.\nAnd as Justice Brandeis said in Whitney versus\nCalifornia in his concurring opinion, you don't make the\nworld safer by driving the speech of hate groups such as\nthe Ku Klux Klan underground. In many societies in this\nworld, you can ban racial supremacist groups.\nQUESTION: I want you just to address -- but\nit's hard for you because you have clients with different\ninterests here perhaps. But -- but if -- if it's right\nthat you can ban speech, i.e., the use of words for\npurposes of threatening people with bodily harm, which I\nthink we can, then what about this prima facie\nprohibition?\nThe way I was thinking about it, to get you to\nrespond, is if you did have a statute that was\nconstitutional that said it is a crime to use the words, I\nwill kill you, with the intent to threaten someone with\ndeath. That statute might go on to say, and the jury may\ninfer from the use of the words themselves on a particular\noccasion that the threat existed. And I think --\nMR. SMOLLA: And I accept that, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- if all that's true, then I guess\nthat the -- the prima facie presumption here is no\ndifferent. It says the jury may infer from the -- the\nburning cross on a particular occasion, just like the use\nof the words, I kill you, on a particular occasion --\nMR. SMOLLA: There's a world of difference, Your\nHonor, and the difference is that the words, I will kill\nyou, are words of threat that have no additional\nemanations. They have no additional secondary meaning in\nthis society either as the symbol of a group, or as the\nsymbol of an idea such as bigotry. They partake of the\nsame rationale, the same defining parameters that allow\nyou to attack threats in the first instance.\nWhereas the burning cross -- the burning cross,\nwhether it's the 19th century burning cross before the\nKlan began, or today, introduces a symbol -- first of all,\njust a cross before we get to the burning part, a symbol\nthat you must concede is one of the most powerful\nreligious symbols in -- in human history. It is the -- it\nis the symbol of Christianity, the symbol of the\ncrucifixion of Christ. When the cross is burned, in much\nthe same way as when the flag is burned, undoubtedly the\nburner is playing on that underlying positive repository\nof meaning to make the intense negative point, often a\npoint that strikes as horrible and as evil and disgusting,\nbut that's --\nQUESTION: Mr. Smolla --\nMR. SMOLLA: -- what the person is trying to do.\nQUESTION: -- there's a huge difference between\na flag and a burning cross, and it's been pointed out in\nthe briefs. The flag is a symbol of our government, and\none of the things about free speech is we can criticize\nthe President, the Supreme Court, anybody, and feel\ntotally free about doing that. It's the symbol of\ngovernment.\nBut the cross is not attacking the government.\nIt's attacking people, threatening their lives and limbs.\nAnd so I don't -- I think you have to separate the symbol\nthat is the burning cross from other symbols that are\ncritical of government, but that don't -- that aren't a\nthreat to personal safety.\nMR. SMOLLA: Justice Ginsburg, I only partially\naccept that -- that dichotomy. In fact, when the Klan\nengages in cross-burning, as it did in Brandenburg versus\nOhio, and as it did here, it is -- it is a melange of\nmessages. Yes, to some degree, it is a horizontal message\nof hate speech, the Klan members attacking Jews and\nCatholics and African-Americans and all of the various\npeople that have been the -- the point of its hatred over\nthe years.\nBut it's also engaged in dissent and in a\npolitical message. If you remember in Brandenburg versus\nOhio, Brandenburg says if the Congress doesn't change\nthings, some revenges will have to be taken. In this\ncase, President Clinton was talked about by the Klan\nmembers. Hillary Clinton was talked about by the Klan\nmembers. Racial preferences and the idea that the --\nwhere they're using taxes to support minority groups.\nThere is a jumble of political anger, of --\nQUESTION: Mr. Smolla, I would -- I would like\nto take exception to your suggestion in response to\nJustice Breyer that the words, I will kill you, always\nhave a threatening meaning.\nMR. SMOLLA: They may not, Justice Stevens.\nQUESTION: I think they're often used in casual\nconversation without any such threatening meaning at all.\nMR. SMOLLA: Justice Stevens, I accept that.\nBut I -- I'm merely making the argument that you can fit a\nphrase such as the words, I will kill you, within the\nexceptions to R.A.V. in a way that you cannot fit\ncross-burning within the exceptions to R.A.V. or\nflag-burning within the exceptions to R.A.V. because\ncross- and flag-burning and any symbol, the burning of the\nStar of David, the swastika -- Virginia has a law\nvirtually identical to the cross-burning law that singles\nout the swastika. The -- you could -- you can go through\nthe universe of symbols --\nQUESTION: Your argument is not the same with --\nI mean, it's an -- your argument, I take it, is that if\nyou actually have a statute that criminalizes the use of\nparticular words, or -- or the burning of a -- of a\nsymbol, even if you qualify that by saying you -- it's\ncriminal to use them for certain purposes, you've\nmonopolized those words because people who are using them\nfrom different purposes will be afraid to use them.\nMR. SMOLLA: And chilled --\nQUESTION: And then they can't express what they\nwant even though that expression is not to hurt someone.\nMR. SMOLLA: And not merely monopolize,\nJustice Breyer, but --\nQUESTION: That's right, yes.\nMR. SMOLLA: But chilled the use of that\ncombination of words or chilled the use of that symbol --\nQUESTION: Yes. All right. I see your point.\nMR. SMOLLA: So that in effect it becomes --\nQUESTION: That -- that seems to give them a\nfree ride when they really want to intimidate and -- and\nthreaten.\nMR. SMOLLA: Justice Kennedy, there's no free\nride if the government employs content-neutral\nalternatives, which really --\nQUESTION: Well, why isn't -- why can't we say\nthere's no three -- free ride when the government imposes\nscienter?\nMR. SMOLLA: Your Honor, because the First\nAmendment requires that we flip the question. It is not\nwhy can't the government single out this particular form\nof expression. It is why do you need to. And if you have\nno need to --\nQUESTION: Wait, wait, wait. I think -- I don't\nthink our cases say you have to use the least restrictive\nalternative. I'm sure there are other ways of getting at\nthe person who brandishes an automatic weapon, but surely\nyou can make brandishing an automatic weapon a crime --\nMR. SMOLLA: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: -- even though there are other ways\nyou could get at it.\nMR. SMOLLA: Justice Scalia, you do not need to\nuse the least restrictive alternative when you are not\nregulating a fundamental right, or engaged in a suspect\nclassification.\nQUESTION: A symbol -- I mean, that's a symbol\ntoo. Brandishing a weapon is a symbol just as burning a\ncross is a symbol.\nMR. SMOLLA: Except, Your Honor, under -- under\nthe Brandenburg test -- excuse me -- under the O'Brien\ntest, the government has functional elements of -- of --\nthat relate to the weapon that allow it to cite things\nutterly unrelated to the content of expression that\nempower it to say you may not -- you may not brandish a\nweapon.\nQUESTION: I don't know what you're talking\nabout.\nMR. SMOLLA: That -- that it's -- it's like the\ndifference, Justice Scalia, between burning a draft card\nand burning a cross or burning a flag, that -- that the\nreason O'Brien -- the draft card case -- allowed the\ngovernment to punish burning the draft card was that the\ndraft card had a functional purpose -- the administration\nof the Selective Service System -- that had nothing to do\nwith what was being expressed when one burned the draft\ncard.\nThe gun is like that. When the government says\nyou may not threaten someone by brandishing a gun, there\nis a functional element to the gun. It's a weapon that\nthe government can cite as its basis.\nBut a symbol only has symbolic meaning.\nQUESTION: Okay, but --\nQUESTION: It's an unloaded gun. This is an\nunloaded gun that's being brandished.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: So once it's unloaded, it's nothing\nbut a symbol.\nMR. SMOLLA: It is -- it is --\nQUESTION: It is nothing but a symbol.\nMR. SMOLLA: It is -- it's still -- it's still a\nweapon, Your Honor, and -- and it is gigantically\ndifferent from a cross.\nIf -- if I -- take a torch. What would be the\ndifference between brandishing a torch and brandishing a\ncross? If I -- if I take two wooden sticks --\nQUESTION: 100 years -- 100 years of history.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SMOLLA: Exactly, Justice Kennedy, that's\nthe difference. And that 100 years of history is on the\nside of freedom of speech, that it is 100 years of history\nthat a particular group has -- has capitalized on this\nparticular ritual to make not only points that are\nthreatening, but to advance their agenda.\nQUESTION: All right. We'll -- we'll accept --\nI mean, I think we accept that, but we -- our problem is\nthat the 100 years have also added something else, and\nthat is the kind of specific Pavlovian quality that I\nspoke of. And if that is giving us difficulty in deciding\nwhether we should classify this in the O'Brien direction,\nor the flag direction, what's the -- what's the -- in\neffect, the tie-breaker?\nMR. SMOLLA: Your Honor, I think the tie-breaker\nis what I've kept coming back to a number of times, which\nis really would there be any fall-off through\ncontent-neutral alternatives, and if there would not be\nany fall-off through content-neutral alternatives, then\nerr on the side of freedom of speech.\nImagine that you have two rallies going on\nside-by-side. The -- the Klan is going to make -- engage\nin a rally, and then a group that wants to counter the\nKlan's message, a Christian group, has a counter-rally in\na public forum in Richmond. And imagine that at the\nheight of those two rallies, the Klan ignites its cross.\nUnder this statute, the Klan can be prosecuted, the other\ngroup cannot. It's --\nQUESTION: Mr. Smolla, I thought that --\nQUESTION: What if the other group all are\nbrandishing guns as Justice Scalia said?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SMOLLA: Then -- then round them up, Your\nHonor.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: I thought Mr. Hurd told us that in\nthe Brandenburg case, where it was just burned at a rally\nas part of the ceremony, that's not what this statute is\ngetting at. It's only when it's used as a signal of\nintimidation, and that what sparked this particular\ncross-burning at this rally -- this was no ordinary rally.\nThis was in response to something that the Klan opposed.\nMR. SMOLLA: And -- and I think, Justice\nGinsburg, again to think about this in content-neutral\nterms, the First Amendment would not forbid the government\ncharging the Klan in the case that we have with an\nordinary, run-of-the-mill threat law, or a hate crime law,\nsuch as a bias enhancement statute, and then introducing\nthe fact that the cross was burned as evidence of the\nthreat, and as part of the emotional atmospheric of the\ncase to try to convince a jury of the heinousness and the\nseriousness of the threat.\nThat was approved by this Court in Wisconsin\nversus Mitchell, and it may seem not worth the candle. It\nmay seem that it's just a way to get to the same result\nthrough some other formality, but our position is that\nthat is enormous for First Amendment purposes. It is the\ncentral divide of modern First Amendment law in which the\nCourt insists that you use content-neutral alternatives\nwhen you can accomplish the governmental ends equally well\nthrough them.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Smolla.\nMr. Hurd, you have 2 minutes in which to discuss\nall these hypotheticals.\n(Laughter.)\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. HURD\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. HURD: Very briefly.\nJustice Souter, the tie-breaker is the intent to\nintimidate which is in our statute. If there's no intent\nto intimidate, there's no violation here.\nOpposing counsel's problem is how does the Klan\ngo out in public and burn a cross and have it viewed not\nas its common, ordinary meaning backed up by 100 years of\nhistory. Well, one thing they could do is not talk about\nshooting blacks with a .30/.30. That might suggest\nthere's no intent to intimidate.\nOpposing counsel suggests that there should be a\nbroader law. Well, Congress could pass a broader law, one\nthat didn't focus on threats against the President, one\nthat focused on threats against any Federal employee, but\nthis Court has said a broader law is not needed because\nthreats against the President are especially problematic.\nSo is cross-burning. It is not just hate\nspeech. It doesn't just say I don't like you because you\nare black. In the hands of the Klan, the message is the\nlaw cannot help you if you're black or Catholic or Jewish\nor foreign-born, or we just don't like you, and if you try\nto live your life as a free American, we are going to kill\nyou. That is the message of cross-burning backed up by\n100 years of history. That's why it is especially\nvirulent. And that's why under R.A.V., this Court can\nallow us to proscribe it without having to pass any other\nlaw, or pretend it is the same as something quite\ndifferent than what it is.\nWe have not interfered with freedom of speech.\nWe have not tried to suppress any idea. All we have tried\nto do is to protect freedom from fear for all of our\ncitizens by guarding against this especially virulent form\nof intimidation.\nWe ask that the decision below be reversed and\nthe statute upheld. Thank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Hurd.\n"
