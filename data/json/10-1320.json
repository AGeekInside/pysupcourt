        "content": "(11:22 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Case 10-1320, Blueford v. Arkansas.\nMr. Sloan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CLIFFORD M. SLOAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SLOAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe question in this case is whether the\njury foreperson's announcement that the jury had voted\nunanimously that Petitioner was not guilty of capital\nmurder and first-degree murder has double jeopardy\nconsequences. We respectfully submit that it does, for\ntwo reasons.\nFirst, the foreperson's announcement on this\nrecord establishes an acquittal; and, second, even if it\nis not viewed as an acquittal, under this Court's\nwell-established standard, there was not manifest\nnecessity for a second trial on the same murder charges.\nNow, with regard to the acquittal, the\nreasons why the foreperson's announcement was an\nacquittal are twofold: First, the foreperson's\nannouncement was clear and explicit that the jury had\nvoted unanimously against guilt; and, second --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that -- is that\naltogether clear, because she first said -- didn't she\nfirst say that the jury cannot agree on any one charge?\nMR. SLOAN: Yes, Your Honor. And then the\ncourt specifically asked what is the count on capital\nmurder? And she said unanimous against that. What is\nthe count on first-degree murder? Unanimous against\nthat. And both the Arkansas trial court and the\nArkansas Supreme Court here observed that the foreperson\nhas been explicit that the jury had voted unanimously\nagainst --.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's the count. The\njury takes lots of votes. Was it utterly clear that the\njury could not go back and reconsider that? Unless that\nwas absolutely clear, it seems to me a verdict had not\nbeen announced. She just said how we voted the last\ntime.\nMR. SLOAN: With regard to finality, Your\nHonor, I think that -- that the jury could have changed\nits mind, but I want to emphasize the reason I say that\nbecause I think it highlights something very important\nthat is conspicuously absent here; and three brief\npoints on that, Your Honor.\nFirst, when the foreperson announced that\nthe jury had voted unanimously against guilt on the\nmurder charges, she was announcing a jury decision.\nThere was nothing equivocal or qualified about that.\nSecond, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Excuse me.\nWhen you say she was announcing a decision, then you\nmean they can't go back on it?\nMR. SLOAN: No, that was -- well, that's\nmy second --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: She was announcing a vote.\nMR. SLOAN: Yes. She was announcing the\ndecision that they had made at that point. But the\nreason -- my second point, Your Honor, the reason why I\nsay that they could have gone back is the historic\ntraditional principle that a jury can correct or revise\na verdict while it continues to be sitting.\nNow, in this Court's opinion, in Smith v.\nMassachusetts, this Court talked about that traditional\nand historic principle, cited an English case from 1824,\nthe Parkin case, where the jury had done that, had gone\nback after announcing a verdict. And how that would\nplay out here, if the jury came back and they said, you\nknow, we were unanimous before, but now one juror says\nthat he doesn't really agree with that, then, of course,\na court could take that into account.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I think you've conceded away\nyour case when you say that. The one characteristic of\na verdict that seems perfectly clear to me is that it is\nfinal.\nThe jury can't render a verdict and be\ndischarged and then come back the next day and say, you\nknow what, some of us -- one of us has changed his mind\nor her mind. It's the final vote. And so, why isn't\nthe critical question here whether what the -- what the\nforeperson said was this is our final vote, we're not\ngoing to go back, this is it; or this is the way we\nvoted now, and it's -- one or more of us may have wanted\nto -- wanted to retain the right, reserve the right, to\ngo back and -- and vote again.\nMR. SLOAN: Because the -- the reason why I\nthink the announcement was an acquittal here is twofold:\nFirst, there was the explicit statement of -- of what\nthe vote was at that time; but, second, there is nothing\non the record in this case that contradicts that\nstatement. At the time the jury was discharged and at\nthe time the trial ended, the jury had said nothing that\ncontradicted that earlier statement.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the -- suppose the\ncourt said, after this colloquy, I want you to go back\nand think about this whole case again. Could the jurors\nthen have revisited the first count?\nMR. SLOAN: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The capital murder count?\nMR. SLOAN: Your Honor, if -- if the jurors\nhad come back and said --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No. The colloquy is what\nwe've got.\nMR. SLOAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And the judge said I want\nyou to deliberate more about this entire case. (A) was\nhe permitted to do that under Arkansas law, I guess is\none of my real questions.\nMR. SLOAN: Oh. Well, in terms -- in terms\nof Arkansas law and the particular transition\ninstructions here, no, we don't think that the\ntransition instructions operate that way, Your Honor.\nThere's nothing in the instructions that say that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Nothing -- nothing --\nArkansas law doesn't permit the jury to -- before it's\ndelivered its final formal verdict, to think about the\ncase again and vote on it again?\nMR. SLOAN: No. It -- it does, Your Honor,\nand that's why I'm trying to draw a distinction between\nhow the transition instructions here operate, the sort\nof acquittal-first instructions, and the general\nprinciple that a jury can correct or revise its verdict.\nI mean, in a sense, one way to think about --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but I -- I think\nthis may be what Justice Alito asked. Well, I -- I\ndon't think it gave a verdict here. I don't think it's\nrevising its verdict.\nMR. SLOAN: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's mid-deliberation, as\nJustice -- Justice Scalia said at the outset.\nMR. SLOAN: There -- there's nothing in the\njury statement at all that suggested that it was\ntentative. It said we have unanimously voted against\nguilt on the murder charges.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, one --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But then they went -- then\nthey went out again.\nMR. SLOAN: Pardon me?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And that's the problem.\nThey, the jury -- the judge gave them an Allen charge,\nand they went out again. And I think you have\nrecognized that the jury could have then said we'll go\nback to square one, we'll consider capital murder,\nfirst-degree murder.\nSo, they -- I think you recognize that after\nthe judge gives them a charge of this kind, they can\nbegin all over again. And here, when they came in and\nsaid we -- we can't agree, defense counsel didn't ask to\nhave the jury polled.\nMR. SLOAN: The -- the defense counsel asked\nfor verdict forms to be sent into the jury room that\nwould allow them to record their verdicts on the murder\ncharges. And that's a very important point here, Your\nHonor, because it was the State that prevented any\nadditional elucidation about what the jury thought on\nthe murder charges.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that -- so long as it's\nstill tentative thoughts, it doesn't matter. The jury\ncould have -- suppose the jury went back after this\nannouncement -- you know, we -- you know, we've decided\non a -- on the greater charge, or we voted on the\ngreater charge for the defendant. Suppose they go back\nand one of the people who wants to convict on the lesser\ncharge, as to which they are deadlocked, finally says,\nwell, look it, if you won't come along to convict him on\nthe lesser charge, by God, I'm not -- I'm not going to\nacquit on the greater charge.\nIsn't that the kind of stuff that goes on in\njury rooms all the time?\nMR. SLOAN: Yes, it does, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, there is no certainty\nwhatever that -- that what was the vote at that time\nwould be the vote when they finally got done.\nMR. SLOAN: Well, but, Your Honor, on the\nrecord as the case comes to this Court, what you have is\nthis very clear and explicit statement against guilt on\nthe murder charges and then nothing in what the jury\nsays when it comes back that contradicts that --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I guess one --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I thought that\npart of your argument was that, given the instructions\nin this case, which the jury appears to have followed to\nthe T, they can't get to a lesser count unless they've\nacquitted on the preceding count.\nMR. SLOAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: When the judge asks\nthem, did you reach criminal negligence, they say we\nwere told not to.\nNow, the judge, whether he was right or\nwrong under Hughes as to whether they followed the\ninstructions or he misunderstood them, I don't know.\nBut it's very clear in context from the government's\narguments to the jury, to the defense argument to the\njury, you don't reach the split count or even talk about\nit unless you've been acquitted.\nSo, given that the jury responds at the end\nwe haven't reached a verdict, and the jury said earlier\nthat they hadn't reached a verdict on the one issue,\nisn't the -- the only assumption is that they didn't go\nback?\nMR. SLOAN: Yes, I think that's exactly\nright, Your Honor, because the jury instructions very\nexplicitly said that you don't go to a lesser offense\nunless you have a reasonable doubt on the greater\noffense. The State --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's --\nMR. SLOAN: -- over and over --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Go\nahead.\nMR. SLOAN: I was just going to say the\nState over and over again in its closing argument said\nto the jury you cannot reach a lesser offense unless you\nunanimously find the defendant not guilty on the greater\noffense. And as you point out, the Arkansas Supreme\nCourt in the Hughes case has said that the law in\nArkansas is that you don't get to a lesser offense\nunless -- the jury doesn't get to a lesser offense\nunless it in essence acquits on the greater offense.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right, but that's\nthe final say. You don't know what the jury did as a\npreliminary matter. I would think it in a case like\nthis perfectly reasonable for the jury to say: Let's\ntake a preliminary vote; we'll go down; and if -- if we\nall agree on something right away, that's what we'll do.\nDoes everybody agree on capital murder? No,\nsome don't. Does everybody agree on murder? No. Does\neverybody agree on manslaughter? Yes. Okay, we all\nknow that manslaughter, he's at least guilty. Now let's\ngo back and talk about the more serious offense, and\nsome of us will try to persuade the holdouts.\nAnd yet, you would say as soon as they\nreached the point of saying, yes, he's guilty on\nmanslaughter, they can't go back.\nMR. SLOAN: Well, the instructions don't\nprovide for them to -- for them to go back. The State,\nwhich had never made that argument until this Court in\nthis litigation, that they can go back, doesn't point to\nany case that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but then I'm not\nsure it's just a matter of State law then, we're --\nwhat we're doing here is talking about the\nconstitutional minimum. And I -- Justice Scalia gave a\nhypothetical, you can have a more -- even a more\nprincipled juror than that. He says, you know, now that\nwe're thinking about manslaughter, it is true that thus\nand so happened; maybe we were wrong on the first --\nfirst-degree count. I mean, that's perfectly plausible.\nMR. SLOAN: Well, let me say, whatever one\nthinks about finality -- and I do think there was\nsufficient finality here for the reasons we have been\ndiscussing, but whatever one thinks about finality,\nlet's consider this in the context of manifest necessity\nbecause whatever one thinks of finality, I submit that\nit is clear that when a jury foreperson stands up in\nfront of the jury, in front of the defendant, lawyers\nfor both sides, and says we have voted unanimously that\nhe is not guilty of these murder charges, that is\nsomething at the very core of the Double Jeopardy\nClause --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Are you saying --\nMR. SLOAN: -- at the heartland of it.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Are you saying that there\nwas no manifest necessity to declare a mistrial as to\nany count, in which case there could be no retrial\nwhatsoever, or no manifest necessity to declare a\nmistrial on capital murder? And if you're saying the\nlatter, then what would you have us do with the decision\nby the Arkansas Supreme Court that Arkansas law does not\nallow a partial verdict?\nMR. SLOAN: Okay. Your Honor, so, first I'm\nsaying only that there was no manifest necessity as to\ncapital murder and first-degree murder, which were the\ntwo charges on which they were unanimous. We agree he\ncan be retried on manslaughter and negligent homicide.\nNow, as to the Arkansas Supreme Court\ndecision on that -- and that brings up a very important\npoint because the State's position essentially is it\ncould never be final enough, as Your Honor suggests,\nbecause it simply is impermissible under Arkansas law to\nhave an acquittal on a greater offense as long as you're\ndeadlocked on a lesser offense.\nAnd as to that, this Court's opinions are\nclear that if you have a State law that prevents giving\neffect to what is in substance an acquittal, it must\nyield to the Federal constitutional command of the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause.\nAnd Hudson v. Louisiana is very instructive\non this point because, in Hudson, Louisiana had a law\nthat after a conviction, a judge could not enter an\nacquittal order; he could only enter a new trial order.\nAnd after the conviction on murder in Hudson, the judge\nentered a new trial order and explained that it was\nbecause of insufficient evidence.\nAnd this Court unanimously said that that\nsubstantively was an acquittal; it has full double\njeopardy consequences, notwithstanding the fact that\nLouisiana law does not allow a judge to enter an\nacquittal order --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's bothering me is I\ncan't figure this out very well. We have an imaginary\nState, and what the State says to the jury: Jury, you\nhave three choices. Choice one is you acquit this\nperson of everything. Choice two is you convict him of\nsomething. Choice three is you say you're hung. Okay?\nI don't see anything in the Constitution\nthat prevents a State from doing that. So, if that --\nif no -- what is it? And, of course, if you follow\nthat, there was no acquittal on those early charges.\nThat wasn't a permissible verdict. And now you\nstructure your argument any way you want, but that\nthe State has -- I would think, within the limits of due\nprocess, it can structure the jury's arguments as it\nwishes.\nBut -- so, what's wrong with that? And if\nthat -- if there's nothing wrong with that, then how do\nyou win?\nMR. SLOAN: Okay, Your Honor. Two points:\nOne that focuses on the jury foreperson's announcement\nhere --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, you could say, well,\nyou could -- well, that's one route. What you say is\nnothing wrong with that. But if the judge is foolish\nenough to get the jury -- to get the foreperson to say\nwhat the state of the deliberation is in detail, then\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause kicks in. Well, that's an\nargument.\nMR. SLOAN: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, they make a mistake and\nnow suddenly it's jeopardy where it wasn't before,\nor -- this seems like a minor matter compared to the\nissues of jeopardy, whether the jury honestly said what\nwas going on in the room, particularly if it's\nchangeable.\nMR. SLOAN: With respect, Your Honor, I\ndisagree that it's a minor matter when a foreperson\nstands up, with the jury present, and says we have voted\nnot guilty. And as to that, with an announcement -- for\nexample, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court\ndecision in the Roth case, which is in the briefs, is\ninstructive because in that case the Massachusetts court\nsaid very emphatically you should not ask a jury that\nkind of question, but --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So, let's -- go\nahead.\nMR. SLOAN: But -- may I just finish --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Please.\nMR. SLOAN: -- the sentence, Your Honor?\nBut in that case, the trial court had asked\nthe jury, and the foreperson had said that they had\nvoted against guilt on the greater offenses. And so,\nthe Massachusetts court said, if the -- essentially,\nthese are my words -- but if the Double Jeopardy Clause\nmeans anything, it means that when you have an\nannouncement like that, it has to matter.\nAnd the other point, Your Honor, is that\nthis Court's opinions such as Fong Foo and Sanabria say\nthat it doesn't matter if an acquittal is on an\nerroneous basis. Once it happens, we give full double\njeopardy consequence to it. So, even if one thinks that\nthe judge shouldn't have asked the question and it would\nhave been permissible not to ask the question, once he\ndid and once that's on the record, that is of\nconsiderable constitutional --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Only if --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why should there --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Only if -- and I think this\nis the premise of your argument. Only if there is a\nconstitutional necessity to -- to sever the various\ncharges, there is a constitutional necessity to let the\njury come in on one charge without coming in on the\nother. It seems to me that's the premise of your\nargument. And I don't know where that constitutional\nnecessity comes from.\nMR. SLOAN: Well, Your Honor, first, on the\nmanifest necessity point, when there is an\nannouncement like this, because --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Your manifest necessity\ndepends upon the necessity of severing, yes. If you\nsever, then there is no manifest necessity of\nresubmitting the greater charge. But it assumes -- it\nassumes a severing, and I don't know where the severing\ncomes from.\nMR. SLOAN: The -- the manifest necessity\nargument is that when there is an announcement like this\nthat goes right to the core of double jeopardy -- and,\nyou know, we know that with greater and lesser included\noffenses, if there is a basis for an acquittal, then\nthat has to be given effect on the separate charges.\nThat's Green and Price.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's -- but that's\nafter a verdict. Why is it that the purposes of the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause are implicated when a jury,\nbefore it delivers a final verdict, says where -- where\nit is mid -- mid-deliberations? The defendant, of\ncourse, is terribly disappointed if they go back and\nthen find him guilty. So, I guess there's a personal\ndisappointment interest for the few hours that it takes\nfor the jury to come to a different verdict, but he\ndoesn't have to prepare the defense again; he doesn't\nhave to go to trial again. It's all one trial.\nI don't see why there's a double jeopardy\ninterest in the Massachusetts case that you point out.\nI don't see where the double jeopardy interest was in\nsaying that you can't go back.\nMR. SLOAN: Well, because --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what --\nMR. SLOAN: It's not --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What purpose of the Double\nJeopardy Clause is implicated by the rule that says you\ncan't go back?\nMR. SLOAN: Well, Your Honor, on the\nmanifest necessity point, I'm not saying you can't get\nback. What I am saying is that when you have an\nannouncement of such constitutional moment at the\nheartland of the Double Jeopardy Clause, a judge can do\nmany things --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm asking why it's the\nheartland of the Double Jeopardy Clause.\nMR. SLOAN: Well, because this Court --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I question that.\nMR. SLOAN: Yes, Your Honor. Because this\nCourt, again and again, has talked about the special\nrole of an acquittal where a jury finds the defendant\nnot guilty. Now, even if one views that as not final,\nit surely is significant at the heartland of the Double\nJeopardy --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why \"surely\"?\nMR. SLOAN: Pardon?\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, why \"surely\"?\nLook, the thing ends. To go back to my example, the\ncase is over, the jury comes in and says, Judge, we're\nhung. Okay? Everybody is going to go home.\nMR. SLOAN: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But the defense lawyer\nsays, Judge, I'd like to know which of the five charges\nthey're on. Does the defense lawyer or the prosecutor\nhave a constitutional right to find out?\nMR. SLOAN: Okay. Well, Your Honor. If one\nassumes the foreperson's announcement is not in it or\nit's of no consequence -- it's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm not assuming\nanything. I'm giving you the example.\nMR. SLOAN: What -- but, no, no -- it's just\nwhat I'm saying. So, there's just the question, does\nthe defendant have a right to inquire?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. SLOAN: And here --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's the answer?\nMR. SLOAN: -- there's -- I would say\ndefinitely, yes, in a hard-transition State. This\nis where you get into the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: In the State I imagine\nis -- remember, there were three possible verdicts:\nAcquit of everything, convict of something, or say\nyou're hung. That's what we're imagining. Okay? And\nyou can imagine the set of instructions -- go to A, B,\nC. That's fair enough. Those four things.\nMR. SLOAN: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay? Now, case over,\nacquitted -- no, hung, Your Honor.\nDefense attorney: I want to find out which\nof the five they're on.\nDoes he have a constitutional right to get\nthe answer?\nMR. SLOAN: He does, if --\nJUSTICE BREYER: He does?\nMR. SLOAN: Yes, if it is a hard-transition\nState. And the -- or especially if it's a\nhard-transition State.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't know what -- I'm\nsorry.\nMR. SLOAN: Okay. What a hard transition --\nor sometimes it's called an \"acquittal first\" State,\nwhich may put it in relief more, which is where, as in\nthis case, the jury is told you may go to a lesser\noffense --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Okay. I see, okay,\nfine.\nMR. SLOAN: -- only if you acquit on the\ngreater offense.\nJUSTICE BREYER: In other words, here -- I\ngot it. If --\nMR. SLOAN: And every State court, except\nfor Arkansas here, that has addressed the issue in the\ncontext of a hard transition, has said that the\ndefendant does have a right to inquire --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Okay.\nMR. SLOAN: That's very different if you\ndon't have that kind of hard transition.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Wait. I'm only midway,\nbecause I'm trying to follow this through. I still\ndon't know why the Constitution does that, but I'll take\nyour word for it. I'd assume it was State law that does\nthat, but -- but fine.\nNow he says, yes, you have the right, either\nof you has the right.\nWe're on number three.\nYour Honor, I would like a poll of the jury\nas to the acquittal as to one and two.\nDoes both -- do both sides have the right to\nget that?\nMR. SLOAN: So, after -- after they've\nannounced an acquittal?\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. Well, here's what\nhappened: Judge, I want to know what number they were\non when they couldn't reach a --\nMR. SLOAN: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Foreman: Number five, Your\nHonor.\nJudge, I would like a poll of the jury, each\njuror, as to numbers one, two, three, and four to be\nsure that they were unanimous on each as to the\nacquittal, which under the instruction allowed them to\ngo to the next one.\nOkay? Constitution requires it?\nMR. SLOAN: Well, no. I mean, look, I think\nthere can be variations in State procedure, but I think\nthe core --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. Why doesn't the\nConstitution require it? You have to be sure there was\nan acquittal. You have to be sure there was an\nacquittal. And what -- what I'm doing obviously is I'm\nspinning out what I see as the constitutional\nconsequences of taking your constitutional position, and\nI'm going to be ending up by saying I've never heard of\nthis before.\nMR. SLOAN: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But there's a lot of stuff\nI haven't heard of. So, that doesn't prove that much.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SLOAN: Well, there are several States\nthat have this, and the reason --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, what do several\nStates have? I've -- if I read what those States are\nsaying, including the Massachusetts State that you point\nto, it's a very simple rule. And you seem to be arguing\npast it or around it or -- I think what they say is,\nonce the jury announces an acquittal, then that's the\nsubstance; the person's been acquitted once they've made\na judgment and announced it. It -- the Constitution\ndoesn't -- the Double Jeopardy Clause doesn't entitle\nsomeone to have it announced, doesn't entitle someone to\nforce the jury to announce it.\nBut if the jury gets up at the end of the\ntrial in a State that doesn't permit partial verdicts\nand said, contrary to the instructions of the judge,\ncontrary to the law of the State, the jury says we\nacquitted on counts one and two, we're hung on count\nthree, the Constitution says jeopardy attaches because\nthere has been an announcement of a verdict. Isn't that\nyour position?\nMR. SLOAN: That's exactly right. There's\nanother body of case law also which I was addressing,\nwhich talks about when jeopardy attaches even if there's\nnot that kind of announcement. But, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, Ball -- our case\nin Ball says it doesn't matter whether a judgment is\nentered or not. As far back as 1896, Ball said the\njudgment is irrelevant. It is the verdict of acquittal,\nand it basically equated that verdict with -- it doesn't\nmatter if it's entered properly, if the jury is polled,\nif anything happens. It's as soon as the jury announces\nacquittal, that's the operative double jeopardy kicker.\nIsn't that what you're saying?\nMR. SLOAN: Yes. Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And I thought I heard\nyou arguing that here the lack of manifest necessity was\nthat the judge had heard they reached that verdict.\nMR. SLOAN: Well --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And he should not have\ndischarged the jury without asking them, could they\nreach a verdict that they had -- had they reached the\nverdict that they announced?\nMR. SLOAN: Yes. From a manifest necessity\nperspective, this Court's decisions on manifest\nnecessity, from United States v. Perez in 1824 through\nRenico v. Lett in 2010, have emphasized the judge has to\nexercise sound discretion. And to exercise sound\ndiscretion here, the judge could have done many things,\nbut the one thing he could not do, consistent with sound\ndiscretion, is to do nothing and to proceed as though\nthat announcement hadn't happened, and --\nJUSTICE ALITO: You suggested that the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You've talked about\nour manifest necessity decisions. It's true that we --\nisn't it, that we said last year we have never reversed\nthe district courts' exercise of discretion under the\nmanifest necessity standard?\nMR. SLOAN: In the case of a jury deadlock?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. SLOAN: Is what Your Honor is talking\nabout? Yes, this Court has emphasized the -- the\ndeference due a district court. But Renico --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In -- and under\nthat -- I'm sorry. Go ahead.\nMR. SLOAN: Renico did not present the\nimportant threshold issue about what are the charges on\nwhich the jury is deadlocked. And here there's an\ninsufficient basis to conclude that the jury was\ndeadlocked on the murder charges. There was nothing\nlike the foreperson's announcement at issue in Renico.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't want to --\nI'm sorry for taking up your time, but your friend says\nyou did not object when the judge announced that he was\ngoing to declare a mistrial; is that correct?\nMR. SLOAN: Your Honor, there's not an --\nan objection at that time, but that is not a waiver for\na couple of reasons. First, the Arkansas Supreme Court\nreached the merits. It's a Federal constitutional\nissue.\nSecond, before that point, defense counsel\nhad been very explicit that it only wanted a mistrial on\nthe -- on the remaining counts and not on the other\nones.\nAnd, third, this Court has emphasized that\nthe distinction in manifest necessity is when the\ndefendant affirmatively consents or moves for a\nmistrial, as opposed to either if the judge does it\nsua sponte, and the defendant doesn't have to object, or\nthe prosecutor moves for it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nGeneral McDaniel.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DUSTIN MCDANIEL\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. MCDANIEL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThere are three key reasons why jeopardy has\nnot terminated in this case. First, the jury was free\nto revisit capital and first-degree murder when it\nresumed its deliberations. Thus --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Where does it say that in\nthe jury charge?\nMR. MCDANIEL: I think that there's a\ncritical misunderstanding by Petitioner of Arkansas's\njury instructions, and there's a lot of use of -- of\ntitles, such as \"acquittal first\" or \"hard transition\"\nor \"soft transition.\"\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, as I understand what\nthe Arkansas instructions said, what the instructions in\nthis case said, is that the jury unanimously had to have\na reasonable doubt on an offense before it could go down\nto the next offense. So, that's to say that the jury\nunanimously had to find what is -- what leads to an\nacquittal. So, the jury had to unanimously acquit on\nthe greater offense before it could go down to the next.\nAnd the -- the instructions don't say\nanything about moving back up. And this jury seems to\ntake its responsibility under these instructions\nextraordinarily seriously. This jury was instructing\nthe judge on the instructions --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- and about how they had to\ngo down step by step and reach unanimity on the one\nbefore they could get to the next lowest down. So, I\nguess I'm asking why do you think, under these\ninstructions, that the jury felt itself able to go back\nup?\nMR. MCDANIEL: Well, there are three primary\nreasons. One, in States that are acquittal-first\nStates, States that truly require a resolution of each\ncharge before the transition to subsequent charges, they\nuse words like \"unanimous.\" In fact, they all use the\nword \"unanimous\" in their instruction. Arkansas doesn't\ndo that. We use a rather ambiguous, or unambiguous,\ndepending on how you look at it --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: The chief prosecutor kept\nsaying: You all have to agree on this.\nMR. MCDANIEL: And he was accurate, and he\nwas echoed by the defense counsel in her closing\nargument as well. But there is no requirement of a\nresolution. The jury verdict forms reflect that\nperfectly.\nIn fact, Justice Breyer's example of a given\nState is exactly what Arkansas does, as compared to a --\na true acquittal-first State, where there are multiple\njury verdict forms, where you truly resolve one charge\nattaching final resolution and, in fact, attaching\njeopardy or terminating jeopardy at that point.\nIn this case, there is one verdict form.\nYou can decide something --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. I'm so\ntotally confused by you ignoring Hughes.\nMR. MCDANIEL: I think --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The Arkansas charge\nsays: If you have a reasonable doubt of the defendant's\nguilt on the charge of capital murder, you will consider\nthe charge of murder in the first degree.\nAnd I thought the Arkansas cases said no one\njuror is going to think they can go to the next count.\nThey have to understand from this charge that it has to\nbe unanimous. And that's what the prosecutor argued.\nIt's what the defense argued. It's what your supreme\ncourt has said has to happen. I'm a little confused,\ngiven your case law, your supreme court case law, that\nsays you can't move on to the next one unless it's\nunanimous, how you can answer Justice Kagan's question\nthe way you have. I mean, there's nothing in your case\nlaw that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You didn't finish your\nanswer, did you? I thought you were going on to some\nother points.\nMR. MCDANIEL: I did. And, in fact, I think\nthat Hughes is extraordinarily important. And,\nrespectfully, I believe that the Petitioner has\nmischaracterized Hughes. There is a line of dicta in\nHughes that is particularly useful in the Petitioner's\nbrief, but it is Justice Corbin of the Arkansas Supreme\nCourt who authored Hughes, who was rejecting a double\njeopardy claim in Hughes and, in fact, invoked this line\nwhich says -- what has been quoted in the briefs. It is\nJustice Corbin who was presented with this exact same\nargument to interpret the instructions in Blueford and\nauthored Blueford and rejected what allegedly was his\nposition on the instructions. Hughes was not about the\ninstructions. No part of Hughes was asked to interpret\nwhat our instructions are.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I think if you -- if you\nlook at what the -- what the judge said, what the\nprosecutor said, what the defense counsel said, and then\nwhat the jury said, it's clear that they all thought\nthat they had to unanimously agree on something before\nthey could go to the next crime. And, again, there's no\nsuggestion in what anybody said that they could go back\nup.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is there any suggestion\nthat they couldn't go back up?\nMR. MCDANIEL: That is extraordinarily\nimportant, Justice Scalia. There's not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't it usually assumed\nthat a jury is not finished until it's finished?\nMR. MCDANIEL: The State would assert that\nthat is precisely the case here. You have exactly the\ntype of jury verdict form that Justice Breyer suggested\nin his example. They have to decide on something. You\nhave one charge, capital murder and its lesser -- lesser\nand includeds.\nThis person, Mr. Blueford, does not deny\nthat he is guilty of a homicide offense. That was\nincluded in their closing argument. Does not deny that\nhe's subject to retrial because there was manifest\nnecessity on at least two of the charges. They simply\nwould like to say that there was not manifest necessity\nfor the greater of the two.\nAnd the only way that that happens is\neither -- to answer, I believe it was Justice Kennedy's\nhypothetical earlier -- are you required to go in and\nengage in partial verdicts even if a State does not\nchoose to do so, even if a State is, in fact, a general\nverdict State?\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, even if, General --\nMR. MCDANIEL: Or --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Even if you're not\nrequired -- and maybe you are required -- but even if\nyou're not, here the jury comes back. The jury tells\nthe judge we've unanimously reached acquittal on these\ntwo counts. At that point, why doesn't the judge have\nan obligation -- you know, the judge sends them back for\na half hour. There's no reason to think that in that\nhalf hour they moved back up the scale. There's every\nreason to think they just remained stuck where they\nwere.\nBut even assuming that there is some\nconceivable possibility that they went back up, why\ndoesn't the judge, working with the manifest necessity\nstandard, have an obligation to say, well, what about\nit? Did you? Did you reach acquittal? Did you reach a\njudgment on these two counts?\nMR. MCDANIEL: Well, there are a couple of\nreasons. One, I think it's fair to say that the State\nrecognizes it was improper for the judge to inquire in\nthe way that he did. I think that it's fair to say that\nhe recognized that it was improper, as he didn't do it\non their first announcement of deadlock and he didn't do\nit on their final announcement of deadlock.\nIt's important to note that, although\ndefense counsel at trial did ask for revised verdict\nforms, that was not her initial reaction. Her initial\nreaction was to say, judge, I think that the jury needs\nto go back and keep deliberating, and I would ask that\nyou give them another Allen charge. That's not the\nreaction that anyone would have if they had just heard\nan acquittal of their client. This was, in fact, a\nmid-deliberation report, probably wrongfully elicited by\nthe trial judge, but it was just that, a snapshot in\ntime with no intent by the jury to make an announcement.\nSo, when they returned, the real question, I\nthink, hinges -- as this Court analyzed in Smith v.\nMassachusetts, is, is it possible for there to be\nrevision? And it doesn't, in fact, Justice Kagan, have\nto be the entirety of the jury completely pivoting in\ntheir decisions. All it would have to be is one. And\nwe recognize that, even after they have announced\nunanimously, signed a verdict form, offered their\nassent, if they're polled in the box and one person\nchanges their vote, then that bears the effect of\nchanging the verdict.\nSo, is it possible? Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would this be different\nif they had -- if the judge had called them back in and\nsaid, are you deadlocked on the third count? And -- my\nhypothetical to your adversary. And they said: Well,\nwe have acquitted on capital murder. We've acquitted on\nthe second count. We are still, Judge, deadlocked.\nIf this had been announced at the very end,\nwhat would be your position today?\nMR. MCDANIEL: Certainly, there would be --\nit would be a tougher case if everything ended at that\nmoment because, at that point, counsel would have to ask\nthe trial court, if you're declaring a mistrial at this\nmoment on this report, what are you going to do? Are\nyou going to accept this or are you not going to accept\nit? Will there be an opportunity for polling?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Doesn't sound like the\njudge was interested in any of the defense counsel's\npositions on mistrial. He announced that whether the\njury told him they were deadlocked or not, he was going\nto call them back.\nSo, I don't know that the judge would have\ndone what you suggested.\nMR. MCDANIEL: It's --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because a judge -- the\ndefense attorney did ask for partial verdicts after\ntheir first announcement.\nMR. MCDANIEL: And, Justice Sotomayor, they\nwere -- they were rightly rejected. Partial -- partial\nverdicts are not contemplated in Arkansas law. It would\nhave been error for him to engage in partial verdicts at\nthat time. And there's nothing in the Fifth Amendment\nthat would require this Court to intrude upon the\nliberty of the States to determine whether they're\ngeneral --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, if the State rule\nsays we don't take partial verdicts and the judge had\nentered a verdict -- a judgment -- declared a mistrial\nor entered a judgment saying hung jury as to all counts,\nwould jeopardy have attached?\nMR. MCDANIEL: If there's a hung jury as to\nall counts, then --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No. If the jury had\nannounced what it did, but following Arkansas law as you\nread it, you don't take partial verdicts, it could only\nbe one hung jury.\nMR. MCDANIEL: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would jeopardy have\nattached?\nMR. MCDANIEL: No. If there's manifest\nnecessity for a mistrial, and in this case there's one\ncharge, one homicide offense, and as this Court has long\nrecognized, Brown v. Ohio being a key -- a key\nanalysis --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, really the only\nissue here is whether it's reasonable to conclude that a\njury that had been told acquit first comes back and says\nwe're only hung on this, and the jury says listen to\neach other on what your hung on, that that jury\nreasonably -- the judge could have ignored their stated\nverdict and enter a trial -- a mistrial on everything\nelse.\nMR. MCDANIEL: Respectfully, Justice\nSotomayor, they were not told acquit first.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't agree --\nMR. MCDANIEL: That is a -- a subtle but key\ndistinction.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't agree -- I don't\nthink you agree that it was their stated verdict, do\nyou?\nMR. MCDANIEL: I absolutely do not. It was\nnot a verdict. And bears none of the hallmarks.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There is no room in Arkansas\nlaw for saying you're acquitted as to one, acquitted as\nto two. But Arkansas law says you come in with a\nverdict of guilty of something, a verdict of acquittal\nof everything, or the words \"hung jury.\" Is that right?\nMR. MCDANIEL: Well, it's not up to the jury\nto determine whether they're hung.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. They say to the judge,\nJudge, we are hung. Judge says \"hung jury.\"\nMR. MCDANIEL: That is correct, Justice\nBreyer. That is correct.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I guess, General McDaniel,\none question about what Arkansas law does is -- it seems\na little bit as if it's trying to get the sweet of an\nacquittal for a State without the bitter. So, the sweet\nis an acquittal-first system, where you force a jury to\nreach agreement on one thing before it goes to the next\nthing, makes compromised jury verdicts harder, and\nthat's why a State might say we want an acquittal-first\nsystem.\nThe bitter that most States take with that\nis that they say, well, if we're forcing them to agree\non these things and they agree on a verdict of not\nguilty, we're stuck with that.\nNow, what Arkansas seems to want is a system\nin which it forces juries to agree on the -- the greater\ncharges before going to the less, but won't take the\nconsequence of that, which is that sometimes they agree\nthat on the greater charges, they're not guilty.\nMR. MCDANIEL: No, Justice Kagan. The --\nthe majority of the States and circuits recognize there\nis a difference between a hard-transition instruction\nand an acquittal-first instruction. They recognize the\ndifference between a partial verdict and a general\nverdict on charges that include lesser and includeds.\nAnd what we require is one verdict on a charge: guilty\nor not guilty.\nAnd they are at liberty to consider -- they\ncan be at the very end -- again, it's very important to\nknow -- it's wholly speculative in this case to know\nwhere they were when they ultimately were hung. And so,\nwe are -- we are operating in the world of bright-line\nrules, which are very important for jeopardy.\nWe know when jeopardy attaches. When the\njury is in the box. We know when jury -- or when\njeopardy terminates, and it's when there's some\nconclusion with finality. Every case that this Court\nhas analyzed, even Price and Green and Selvester, where\nthe jury remained silent, there was some finality that\nled to termination of jeopardy.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: General McDaniel, in this\ncase, they deliberated for 4-1/2 hours at the point\nwhere the judge asked them where do you stand on this\ncount; where do you stand on that? And so, they were up\nto the manslaughter, and they were stuck on that. And\nthe jury foreman said we can't go to negligent\nhomicide because we haven't reached agreement on -- on\nthe manslaughter charge. Then they go back for just a\nhalf hour.\nHow realistic is it to think that they began\nover at that point, rather than trying to resolve the\nmanslaughter charge so they could do exactly what the\njudge told them, and then get to the negligent homicide\ncharge?\nMR. MCDANIEL: The State wouldn't venture to\nspeculate as to what they did, although I would\nrespectfully say that that is probably what happened.\nThey went back and they tried to follow the instructions\nof the court. That's certainly viewing things in a\nlight most favorable to the Petitioner, and there's no\nevidence --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: General McDaniel, how --\nhow probable is it that when the jury is polled, and\nhaving voted unanimously when they were back in the jury\nroom, one of the members of the jury changes his mind\nand votes the other way? That's not at all probable, is\nit? But it happens sometimes, doesn't it?\nMR. MCDANIEL: It does.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And when it happens, what's\nthe result?\nMR. MCDANIEL: It -- it bears all of the\ndifference in the finality of the verdict. And, again,\nas this Court noted in Smith, it's the availability;\nit's the incorporation within a State's procedure for\nthat finality to be undone. My Lord, how likely is it\ntruly for a trial court to completely reverse his or her\ngranting of a motion of dismissal? But this Court said,\nif there's a procedure in place for it to be revisited,\nthen jeopardy doesn't terminate until the point at which\nthere's no return.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is this a fair explanation\nof Arkansas law, which doesn't seem to me to be\nperfectly clear? What the jury is supposed to do is to\nvote on the greatest offense first and reach a\nreasonably firm vote. And if they reach a reasonably\nfirm vote that is unanimous not guilty, then they can\nmove on to the next -- to the lower offenses, but that\nreasonably firm vote is not an absolutely final vote,\nand there is still the possibility for the jury to go\nback.\nMR. MCDANIEL: Yes, Justice --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is that a correct\nunderstanding?\nMR. MCDANIEL: Yes, Justice Alito, that's\nprecisely correct. And, just as Justice Scalia noted\nearlier, we recognize that there are compromises that\nare incorporated into transitions. One may be willing\nto say: I'm willing to move on from first-degree\nmurder. I'm the only one here that believes that we\nshould find guilty of first-degree murder, but that's\nnot going to happen. I'm not going to change your\nvotes. But I'm willing to move on and go to\nmanslaughter.\nJUSTICE ALITO: For double --\nMR. MCDANIEL: But would that vote equate to\nan acquittal if asked in -- with finality?\nJUSTICE ALITO: For double jeopardy\npurposes, is the question what Arkansas law actually\nsays, or what the jury understood Arkansas law to be?\nMR. MCDANIEL: I think what Arkansas law\nactually says is how we should be judged, but at the\nsame time, the evidence here was that the jury came in\nto answer questions about the status of their\ndeliberation. I think that Justice Kagan properly noted\nthat they were in fact giving the judge some\ninstructions on how the instructions should work.\nAnd they were answering that question, and\nthe foreperson -- one person was asked, well, where are\nyou? And she announces -- and we have no reason to\nbelieve that she was not being truthful. At the same\ntime, we have no way to verify it. And the defense\ncounsel said, Judge, I think they ought to be given\nanother Allen charge, and they need to go keep\ndeliberating.\nAnd at that point, if they had returned, no\nmatter how unlikely -- if they'd come back in 10 minutes\nlater and said we find unanimously guilty of capital\nmurder, no matter how unlikely, if that was possible,\nthen jeopardy could not have terminated upon that\nreport. It could not have been an acquittal because\nthey couldn't have continued deliberating on those\ncharges for another instant.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General, how do you deal\nwith our cases, Ball and Martin Linen and the whole line\nthat says State -- the form of State law judgments\ndoesn't control?\nMR. MCDANIEL: I think that Ball is\nparticularly helpful to us, and I think that the Hudson\ncase cited by Petitioner is also important.\nIf -- if a State puts a procedural bar to\nconsidering a final judgment of acquittal, then that\nprocedural bar is trumped by the Fifth Amendment of the\nConstitution. Mr. Ball was --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure what that\nmeans.\nMR. MCDANIEL: Well --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And that's the problem\nwith all of this area, which is States vary on how they\nenter judgments after the jury speaks its verdict. So,\nwhere do we draw the line as to when a State law\ntrumps -- when a Federal law, the Double Jeopardy\nClause, trumps a State system?\nMR. MCDANIEL: Justice Sotomayor, I think\nthat your answer is contained within the question. A\nverdict is the true answer. If there is a verdict, then\nthe -- the force and impact of that verdict is what\nmatters. Did this jury announce a verdict? If so,\njeopardy attached. But this was not a verdict. It bore\nnone of the hallmarks of a verdict. It wasn't\npublished. It wasn't verified. It wasn't accepted by\nthe court. It wasn't even accepted by the defendant's\nattorney. It wasn't a verdict.\nIn Ball, there was a clear verdict. The\njury announced acquittal. The judge entered acquittal.\nAnd later, the indictment was dismissed as being faulty.\nAnd under the law of England up until that time, even in\nthe United States, a faulty indictment dismisses\neverything, and you start de novo. So, even the\nacquittal gets thrown out because you can't acquit of\nsomething that was void ab initio.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Sloan told us that it\nwas the State that prevented the elucidation because\ndefense counsel said: Judge, we can try to do what\nDouble Jeopardy Clause says, not try a person twice for\nthe same offense. So, Judge, please ask the jury to\nrule on those two -- give them a sheet that gives them a\nchoice of guilty or not guilty.\nBut they went -- that originally was just a\nseries of guilty on the four counts, and then their\nother choice was acquittal.\nNow, defense counsel says, ask them, is it\nguilty or not guilty, instead of asking just is it\nguilty. And the judge declines to do that. Isn't that\nwhy we don't have definitive answers? Because defense\ncounsel says -- said, Judge, give the jury the chance to\ntell us whether they --\nMR. MCDANIEL: Some States do, in fact, give\nthe opportunity to inquire into the jury's\ndeliberations. Partial verdict forms and inquiries are\npermitted, but they're not required. And in Arkansas,\nthe State properly objected to changing the agreed-upon\nverdict forms, as the judge said, midstream. They had\nbeen agreed to; they had been submitted; and they\nproperly reflected the law in Arkansas. So that to\nchange them would have either been by agreement or\nbecause they were constitutionally required. And that's\nultimately the case -- the question in front of this\nCourt: Are they -- are they constitutionally required?\nAnd that leads into the manifest necessity\nanalysis because anytime there is a charge with lesser\nand included offenses and a general verdict State, and\nthe jury simply announces we cannot reach a\ndetermination, is -- is the constitutional trigger truly\nresting on the fortuity of the announcement of a\nsnapshot vote in open court, or is a constitutional\ntrigger how they voted back in the jury room? And if\nthat is the constitutional trigger, then wouldn't\nverdicts -- partial verdicts be required?\nIn fact, this Court does not require partial\nverdicts. A -- an announcement of unable to render a\nverdict warrants a mistrial. This Court has said\nclearly in Renico that we defer to a -- a trial court's\ndecision that manifest necessity exists. In fact, this\nCourt has never overturned a trial court's decision that\nmanifest necessity existed for the -- on a hung jury.\nHere a jury was hung. They simply could not\nrender a decision on the verdict forms they were\nsubmitted: guilty or not guilty of a homicide? They\ncouldn't answer the question. And, therefore, jeopardy\nshould continue, and the retrial should be permitted.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: General, you mentioned Green\nand Price before, and those are the cases, of course,\nwhere there is a conviction on a lesser charge. We\ndon't know anything about the greater charge. And then\nthe conviction is overturned.\nAnd what the Court says there is, well, we\ndon't know anything, but we're going to make a\nreasonable assumption, and the reasonable -- no, I think\nit said a \"legitimate\" assumption. The legitimate\nassumption that they acquitted on the greater charges\nbefore they went down to the lesser charge.\nNow, it seems to me as though there are a\nhundred reasons why that might not be true. The jury\ncould have just gone to the lesser charge immediately as\na compromise position without voting on the greater\ncharge, but the Court said we'll make a legitimate\nassumption.\nSo, why isn't the same true here? We're\nmaking a legitimate assumption, I think honestly, on the\nbasis of much more than Green and Price had to work\nwith, if you will, that the jury, in fact, acquitted of\nthose greater offenses.\nMR. MCDANIEL: Well, in Green and Price\nthere were verdicts, and --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: There was a verdict --\nMR. MCDANIEL: -- in this case there's no\nverdict.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- that eventually got\noverturned. There was no verdict on the greater\noffenses.\nMR. MCDANIEL: You have to look at Green and\nPrice in conjunction with this Court's holding in Brown\nand the analysis of lesser included offenses within a\ngeneral offense. They are one for jeopardy purposes.\nIn this case, Mr. Blueford was facing one\ncharge for jeopardy purposes. The information, the\nindictment, only included one charge. So, he could not\nhave been convicted of both manslaughter and murder in\nthe first degree. This Court's very clear about that.\nSo, in Green and in Price, where there was a\nconviction on a lesser charge and silence -- in other\nwords, they didn't expressly say not guilty of this\nhigher charge and not guilty of this higher charge, and\nguilty of this lesser charge -- it stands only to\nreason, and certainly to constitutional scrutiny, you\ncan only be convicted of one of them. And if a jury\nfinds -- and, again, it still requires publication,\nverification, and acceptance by a court of an actual\nverdict of one of those charges -- it only stands to\nreason and logic that the upper charges were dismissed.\nThat's -- that is entirely different, respectfully --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well --\nJUSTICE ALITO: In Green --\nMR. MCDANIEL: -- from this case.\nJUSTICE ALITO: In Green and Price, the\ndefendants were tried once on the greater offense, and\njeopardy terminated without a finding of manifest\nnecessity regarding the termination of jeopardy. To me\nthat is the sound basis for those decisions. But I have\nto agree with what Justice Kagan said. The -- Justice\nBlack's reasoning in Green, that the jury impliedly\nacquitted the defendant of the greater offense by\nconvicting the defendant of the -- of the lesser offense\ndoesn't really make any sense because they could have\nsimply been in disagreement about the greater offense.\nMR. MCDANIEL: Well, and I think that's\ncorrect, and I think that there has to be some question\nhere as to, is it an implied acquittal or was it an\nexpress verdict? I think the Petitioner can't really\ndecide, or at least hasn't articulated, where the\njeopardy terminating event occurred. Was it when they\nmade their announcement? In which case, why did they go\nand subsequently deliberate even on the request of\ncounsel? Was it at the conclusion when there was the\npossibility that nothing really had changed after the\nreport and a declaration of manifest necessity? Which\ndid not come, by the way, at the request of the State.\nIt was sui sponte by the court.\nAnd then there was, in fact, a waiver, and I\nthink a legitimate waiver, of an objection by defense\ncounsel. There was -- at no time at that point before\nreleasing this jury did defense counsel renew a motion\nto submit partial verdict forms, to inquire into the\njury, to poll where they were.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well -- she had asked;\nso, why was it necessary for her to repeat it? And she\nsaid, Judge, please let them vote yes or no on the --\nthe two most serious charges. And the judge said no.\nShe might have figured if she was going to repeat that,\nshe would just annoy the judge. She had made the -- she\nhad made the request.\nMR. MCDANIEL: The primary difference would\nbe, in fact, the possibility that polling may be\ndifferent after another half hour of deliberations. All\nit takes is one juror to change their mind. And, in\nfact, it may have benefitted the defendant. What if they\nhad already decided they'd changed their mind again and\nacquitted on -- on manslaughter and had moved down to\nnegligent homicide? And that's what they were talking\nabout.\nWhere they were at the end of the final 30\nminutes of deliberation is purely speculative. And\nbecause it's purely speculative, regardless of whether\nit could benefit the State or the defendant, it means\nthat no report was a verdict. No report could have been\na verdict.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General, other than\ntrenching on State rules that don't create the\nconstitutional protection, what's wrong with a simple\nrule that says, once a jury announces that it is\nunanimous on acquittal of a count, you can't go back\nunless the jury says that it's not unanimous in some\nway? What's wrong with that rule?\nMR. MCDANIEL: It would be difficult to\napply in practicality, and it certainly would be --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why? The jury comes out\nand says we're unanimous. There's a poll. One juror\nsays I'm really not unanimous. They go back. But once\na jury says it's unanimous, a judge can't declare a\nmistrial, can't do something until it ensures itself\nthat -- that jeopardy hasn't attached.\nMR. MCDANIEL: The primary reason why the\nmajority of jurisdictions have rejected that analysis,\nwhether it's announced or not, is the coercive effect on\n-- on a jury.\nIf you have a tired, frustrated, potentially\nangry jury, and they're told we're either going to let\nyou go or you're -- we're not going to let you go home\nuntil you decide something; you have to tell\nus something.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, I'm not -- I'm not\nasking -- I'm not announcing or setting a rule that says\nyou have to ask them, you have to force them to give a\nverdict. I'm not -- I'm saying what's wrong with the\nconstitutional rule that simply says, once the jury says\nwe're unanimous, there can't be manifest injustice --\nthere can't be manifest necessity until you're sure that\nthey can't reach a verdict -- that that verdict is not\ntheir verdict?\nMR. MCDANIEL: So, we're not asking, but if\n-- just so I understand your hypothetical -- we're not\nasking them, but if for fortuitously they happen to\nannounce --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's what --\nMR. MCDANIEL: -- spontaneously or\notherwise --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's what three State\ncourts have said. Three State courts have said, if\nthere's any meaning to jeopardy, it is that once a jury\nout loud says to a defendant you're not guilty, the\ndefendant is entitled to rely on that. So, what's wrong\nwith that simple rule?\nMR. MCDANIEL: First, this Court hasn't --\nthat court -- that rule -- could be allowed to work,\nand, in fact, it does work in some States. I don't see\nhow it could benefit Mr. Blueford; and so, I don't see\nhow it follows into his relief because it didn't in fact\nhappen. And so, it takes us -- it might be beneficial\nto future defendants if they ever find themselves in\nsuch a circumstance, but it doesn't apply retroactively.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\nMr. Sloan, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CLIFFORD M. SLOAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SLOAN: Thank you, Your Honor.\nThe core of the State's position is that the\nforeperson's explicit announcement that the jury had\nunanimously voted against guilt is of no constitutional\nmoment whatsoever.\nNow, there is no opinion of this Court that\nhas ever said that a jury statement like that is\nentitled to no weight whatsoever. And if this Court\nwere to say that in an opinion, it would open the door\nto many of the core double jeopardy evils that this\nCourt has repeatedly focused on. For example, acquittal\navoidance, emphasized in the Arizona v. Washington. A\ncourt doesn't want to accept the acquittal consequences;\nso, it just says we're not going to accept that.\nAnd something that's a very real and\npractical danger here, which this Court has emphasized\nover and over again in opinions, is giving the State the\nopportunity to refine and hone its case based on what it\nlearned at the first trial about what went badly.\nAnd that is exactly what happened here. So,\nit was vigorously contested. The State's capital murder\nand murder -- first-degree murder case fell apart.\nTheir lead expert on it was destroyed. The jury heard\nboth sides, voted unanimously not guilty. And as this\nCourt said in Ashe v. Swenson, a core evil of the Double\nJeopardy Clause is that we don't let the prosecutor have\na dry run at a first trial, and then get to go before a\nsecond trial with a new jury and plug the holes in it.\nAnd the State's position here, that this is of no moment\nat all, would raise that danger very prominently.\nIn conclusion, Your Honor, the jury in this\ncase heard the evidence on both sides, unanimously voted\nagainst guilt on the murder charges, announced that in\nopen court, and never said a word that contradicted it.\nForcing Petitioner to run the gauntlet a second time on\nthe murder charges would run counter to what this Court\nhas repeatedly emphasized as the core purposes, policy,\nand language of the Double Jeopardy Clause.\nIf there -- if there are no further\nquestions, Your Honor --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Sloan, General.\n"
