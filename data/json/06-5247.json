        "content": "(10:06 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nthis morning in case 06-5247, Fry versus Pliler.\nMr. Haltom.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF VICTOR S. HALTOM\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. HALTOM: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe constitutional error that occurred in\nMr. Fry's third trial is the type of error that can\nresult in a conviction of an innocent person.\nNotwithstanding the nature of the error that occurred in\nMr. Fry's trial, no court has reviewed the effect of\nthat error or evaluated the effect of that error under\nthe constitutionally mandated Chapman standard.\nMr. Fry's position is simply that he is\nentitled to one bite at the Chapman apple. In the\nCalifornia Court of Appeals, that State appellate court\nshould have, but did not, rectify the constitutional\ntrial error that occurred in this case. Had that court\ncomplied with this Court's precedent, that court would\nhave first identified the constitutional error that\noccurred at trial, namely the chambers error, and\nsecond, reviewed the effect of that error, assessed the\neffect of that error under the Chapman test.\nThe failure of that court to do so, the\nunreasonable decision-making of that court, relegated\nMr. Fry to seeking relief in Federal habeas proceedings.\nIt scarcely seems reasonable --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose he could have\ncome here on direct.\nMR. HALTOM: He could have, Your Honor,\nhowever, he didn't have the right to counsel to come\nfollowing his appeal to the State appellate court, and\nthen after the denial of his petition, it would be a\ndiscretionary review in the California Supreme Court, he\nno longer had the right to counsel.\nAnd the fact of the matter is if he had\nfiled a petition for writ of certiorari following that,\nit would have effectively been asking at that stage for\na type of error correction.\nIt scarcely seems logical that the scope of\nthe remedy to which Mr. Fry is entitled for the\nconstitutional violation that he suffered, that that\nshould be curtailed based upon simply the unreasonable\ndecision-making of the State appellate court in the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if we're talking\nabout what -- where is the logic in the result that I\nbelieve you're position produces, which is that a\nprisoner who loses in the State court on harmlessness\ngrounds, because the State court finds it's harmless,\nobtains no habeas relief in Federal court unless the\nerror actually prejudiced him. Whereas if the State\ncourt never reached the harmlessness ground, and erred\non -- or ruled on whether the violation occurred,\nwhether there was any constitutional violation, then he\nwould obtain relief if there is merely a reasonable\nprobability of harm.\nNow, you know, why would there -- what does\nhe care whether -- whether the error below consisted in\nan erroneous harmlessness determination or an erroneous\ndetermination that there was no violation? Why should\nthere be a different standard of review between the two?\nMR. HALTOM: Justice Scalia, that's the\npoint raised in the Solicitor General's amicus brief\nhere. And in Mr. Fry's case, what happened was that\nthere was a harmless error analysis conducted, albeit\ntruncated, by the State appellate court. But it was not\na Chapman analysis. And that failure of the State\nappellate court to engage in a Chapman analysis is\ncontrary to this Court's precedent. It ignores Chapman,\nit also would be an attack on --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let's assume another\nviolation, the court erroneously determines --\nerroneously -- that there was no constitutional\nviolation at all. Its error is not with regard to the\nharmlessness, but with regard to whether there was a\nconstitutional violation. Why should there be one\nstandard of review for one error and a different\nstandard of review for the other, regardless of whether\nthe State court conducted Chapman or not?\nMR. HALTOM: I don't know that necessarily\nthere has to be one standard of review for the other --\nfor one or the other, Your Honor. Our position in this\ncase is simply following the logic of this Court's\ndecision in Mitchell versus Esparza, that this Court or\nany Federal habeas court needs to consider what the\nState appellate court did. You cannot divorce -- there\nis the underlying constitutional violation that occurred\nin Mr. Fry's trial. Then that error is compounded when\na State appellate court fails to assess the effect of\nthat error under the Chapman standard.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You could say the same\nthing when the State court has erroneously determined\nthat there was no violation.\nIn that case, you apply the Kotteakos\nstandard. I just don't understand the rationale of\napplying a higher standard to the other error.\nMR. HALTOM: Well --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the State court\ndidn't find that there was error. I thought the State\ncourt said, this was cumulative, I'm not going to let it\nin.\nMR. HALTOM: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It wasn't until we got\ninto the Federal court that there was an error found.\nAs far as the State was concerned, there was no reason\nto engage in any kind of harmless error review, Chapman\nor not, because there was no error.\nMR. HALTOM: That's correct. That's in\npages 94 to 97 of the joint appendix. The State\nappellate court concluded there was no error as a matter\nof State law in this case. The court also concluded\nthat there was no constitutional error.\nThen in a footnote, footnote 17 on page 97\nof the Joint Appendix, the State appellate court stated\nin the alternative, effectively, there was no prejudice\nthat Mr. Fry possibly could have suffered in this case.\nHowever, in making that alternative holding, the State\nappellate court, the California court, was applying\nwhat's known as the Watson standard, which as this Court\nhas repeatedly recognized, is the functional equivalent\nof the Kotteakos type standard.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And it is that\ndetermination that you are objecting to here. The\nharmlessness determination.\nMR. HALTOM: I am, Your Honor. Obviously,\nwe are objecting to the State court's finding of no\nunderlying substantive constitutional violation, as well\nas the State court's determination that there was no --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But for the former, you are\nperfectly content with our applying Kotteakos. And for\nthe latter, however, you say we have to apply Chapman.\nI just don't see the logic of that.\nMR. HALTOM: Well, first of all, this case,\nsince it has now been determined in the Federal courts\nthat there was an underlying constitutional violation,\ndoes not present that question. We do -- and I\nunderstand the position that you are raising,\nJustice Scalia, that there is a potential split in the\nlogic there. I don't think the Court has to resolve\nthat here.\nSome of the lower Federal courts have\ndetermined that now, in light of AEDPA, the Brecht\nstandard has been completely supplanted. Some courts\nhave construed this Court's decision in Mitchell versus\nis Esparza to lead to that conclusion. And that may\nvery well be the case. However, I don't think the Court\nneeds to ultimately address that proposition in this\ncase.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: As I read the\nCourt's opinion in Brecht, the Brecht standard on\nharmlessness is based on the structural consideration\nthat your under collateral review at that point, rather\nthan under direct review. You would apply a different\nharmlessness standard that doesn't seem to take into\naccount the fact that it's collateral review rather than\ndirect.\nMR. HALTOM: Certainly, Mr. Chief Justice,\ncollateral review, as this Court pointed out in Brecht,\ncan result in a more deferential standard of harmless\nerror inquiry. The -- those considerations that led\nthis Court in Brecht to adopt Kotteakos rather than\nChapman apply across-the-board in all habeas cases.\nHowever, a central theme of the Brecht\ndecision was that there have been Chapman analysis\nconducted by the State appellate judiciary --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess that's\nwhere maybe we -- is the subject of debate, whether the\ncentral theme in Brecht was, this is collateral review,\nand that calls for a different standard, or whether the\ncentral theme was Chapman review had been undertaken,\nand therefore, that calls for a different standard.\nI'm not sure I agree with you that the\nlatter is the case.\nMR. HALTOM: I agree that it could be -- it\nis a debatable point. But the -- to ignore the\ncircumstance that this Court stressed, I think\nundoubtedly stressed in Brecht that there had been that\nState appellate review is to basically divorce the\nholding in Brecht from the factual context in which that\ncase -- or out of which that case arose.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The dissenters certainly\nthought that that was the consequence, the dissenters in\nBrecht. They said that Kotteakos would apply even where\nthe State court has found that \"no violation has\noccurred.\"\nMR. HALTOM: That's true, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In other words, never\napproached the harmlessness thing. That's what the\ndissenters thought.\nMR. HALTOM: The dissenters thought that the\nimport of Brecht was that it was going to apply\nacross-the-board in Federal habeas --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I don't think the\nmajority said the contrary. I mean, I wrote it. I\nmean, I don't know -- what counts is what I wrote, not\nwhat I thought. But if you read it, I don't think it\ndecides this question.\nWhat I wonder, though, is why does the --\nhow does this case present the issue you want to argue?\nI'm -- Justice Ginsburg made me wonder about that. As I\nunderstand it, the trial court said, I'm not going to\nlet this witness testify, it is cumulative. All right.\nAnd then the appeals court said, well, that wasn't a\nmistake. And one reason it wasn't a mistake is that\nthis witness added nothing. There could no possible\nprejudice, says the trial court, when he excluded that\nperson. That means it was cumulative, that means it did\nnothing, and that was the appeals court. So the appeals\ncourt finds no error.\nNow, we get over to the Federal court. And\nthey say, oh, no, this witness added a lot. Well, they\ncouldn't have thought this witness added a lot to the\npoint where the constitution is violated unless they\ndisagreed with that decision of making no possible\ndifference. Very well. We disagree, send it back. End\nof case.\nNow, where does it raise all this stuff\nabout harmless error and -- I mean, when I -- it is hard\nfor me to get my mind around this issue, because it's so\ncomplicated. How does this case raise it?\nMR. HALTOM: Well, I suppose, Your Honor,\nbecause of the fact that the State appellate court\ndidn't simply state, we find no error, and leave it at\nthat, but rather, the State appellate court also raised\nthe point that, in a footnote, in a truncated manner,\nthat there is no possible --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Was that as a reason for\nthere not being error? Or was it in the context of\nsaying, well, even if there was a mistake, there was no\npossible prejudice. What does the footnote mean, in\nyour opinion? The second?\nMR. HALTOM: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is the footnote\nnumber?\nMR. HALTOM: It's footnote 17.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. I'll read it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Page what?\nMR. HALTOM: It's 97 in the Joint Appendix,\nYour Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Thank you. Very helpful.\nThe other thing which I brought up, so I might as well\nget both my questions out, is that years ago I read a\ndecision by Judge Leventhal that made a big impression\non me. And he was a very good judge. It's in a\ndifferent context, it's the same problem.\nHe said, I originally thought this was the\ncase dreamed of by law professors, a case where I could\nconscientiously say, although I consider the findings\nclearly erroneous, so I'd reverse if it were a judge's\ndecision, nonetheless, there is support and substantial\nevidence. And therefore, I affirm it, because it comes\nfrom an agency.\nBut when I think about it, I don't think\nthere's substantial evidence either. Okay. In other\nwords, has there ever been a case in the history of\nmankind where you think a judge has actually thought to\nhimself, after reviewing the record, oh, I think that\nthis is harmless, so I'll affirm. But I don't think\nit's harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, so I'll\nreverse.\nI mean, I find it very difficult to get\nmyself in that state of mind, where I think such a thing\nis possible.\nMR. HALTOM: I agree with you, Your Honor.\nIt's angels on the pin of a needle, I guess is the\nphrase here, and this case may be a case where the\ndifference between Chapman and Brecht could be of\nconsequence. If you'd look at the district court's\ntreatment of this case, at the district court level the\ncourt stated: \"Mr. Fry comes close to demonstrating\nactionable error,\" and that court is applying the Brecht\nstandard. The district court states: \"I cannot rule\nout prejudice in this case.\" So seemingly had that\ncourt applied Chapman, Mr. Fry would have prevailed in\nthe district court.\nLikewise, in the Ninth Circuit we have the\ndissenting justice concluding that there is prejudice\neven under the Brecht standard, and then we have the\npanel majority in ruling against Mr. Fry on the\nprejudice issue stating that had Pamela Maples'\ntestimony been admitted that would have substantially\nbolstered Mr. Fry's claim of independence. That\nstatement seems inconsistent with the finding that it is\nharmless error under Brecht; and even if it's not\ninconsistent it seems that had that court been applying\nthe Chapman standard, that court would have ruled in\nMr. Fry's --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If I could come back to,\nmay I ask this question: Is part of your argument that\neven under the Brecht standard it was not harmless?\nMR. HALTOM: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: This is a case, am I\ncorrect, where there were two, two hung juries and then\na five-week deliberation in this case? And there was a\nharmless -- and the testimony of Maples was she had seen\na guy who didn't fit the description do the killing?\nMR. HALTOM: Correct, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where is that in the\nquestion presented?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It says that if the Brecht\nstandard applies, does the Petitioner or the State bear\nthe burden? I guess that's the narrower question, who\nhas the burden.\nMR. HALTOM: Well, the Respondent has\nessentially conceded that under O'Neal that they bear\nthe risk of non-persuasion.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But O'Neal, I thought\nO'Neal just says that this word \"burden of proof\" is out\nof place when you talk about an appellate judge reading\nthe record.\nMR. HALTOM: I think that that was what the\nholding in the majority opinion was, but I think, as\nJustice Thomas pointed out in his dissenting opinion,\nthe effect of that is to allocate the risk of\nnon-persuasion to the State. And so I think that\nthat's -- I could be wrong, but it seems to me a\nsemantic point.\nAnd to Justice Stevens' question, as you\npointed out in your concurrence in Brecht, the Kotteakos\nstandard which this court adopted in Brecht is an\nexacting standard. And in applying that standard, if\nyou'd look at this case, the Court's decisions,\nSullivan, Kotteakos, say that the focus has to be on the\njury. Here we have a jury in the third trial that\ndeliberated for 23 court days after 29 court days --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're now arguing\nthat under Brecht this should not have been harmless; is\nthat the point you're making?\nMR. HALTOM: Yes, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Okay. Now, I didn't hear the\nanswer to my question. I'm not sure that is in the\nquestion that you presented and on which we granted\ncert. It says which standard applies, who bears the\nburden. I don't see anything saying is this -- was it\nerroneous to conclude that this was harmless under\nBrecht.\nMR. HALTOM: Well, I believe, number one,\ndoes it matter which standard applies as part of the\nquestion presented? Does it matter which harmless error\nstandard is implied? My answer to that is no, because\nMr. Fry prevails under either Brecht or Chapman.\nAnd this Court could in this case simply\ndecide this case on that very narrow question, like many\ncourt do where this issue is raised, this intellectually\nchallenging issue of what should a habeas court apply,\nBrecht or Chapman, when there has been no Chapman\nanalysis in the State court or when there has been an\nobjectively unreasonable Chapman analysis in the State\ncourt. Most courts confronted with that issue say, we\ndon't need to decide the question here because either\nthe error was plainly harmless under both of those\nstandards or plainly not harmless under both of these\nstandards. And I simply recounted the history of the\nlitigation below in the Federal courts to point out that\nthis could be a case where that make a difference. It\nseems like --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The trouble with reading\nthat second question that way is that, you know, it\nfollows from your first question, which speaks in the\ngenerality of cases. It's not speaking to this case.\nYour first question presented is, if constitutional\nerror in a State trial is not recognized by the\njudiciary until the case ends up in Federal court, is\nthe prejudicial impact assessed under the standard set\nforth in Chapman or in Brecht? That's the first\nquestion. Very generalized.\nSecond question: Does it matter which\nharmless-error standard is employed? I didn't take that\nto mean does it matter in this case which of the two. I\nthought it meant, you know, is there any difference\nbetween the two standards? Don't you think that's fair\nreading of it.\nMR. HALTOM: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You think it means, does it\nmatter in this case which harmless -- you think that\nsecond sentence means would, would the defendant be\nentitled to reversal of the conviction no matter which\nharmless error standard is employed? You think that's\nwhat it means?\nMR. HALTOM: I think that that is the import\nof that portion of the question.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that a question on\nwhich we would be likely to grant cert?\nMR. HALTOM: Perhaps not if that was the\nonly question in and of itself, but perhaps so because,\nas I indicated before, as Justice Stevens stressed in\nhis concurring opinion in Brecht, the Kotteakos standard\nis a demanding standard. And look at this case. If the\nerror in this case can be deemed harmless under any\nstandard, then what cannot? What is prejudice when\nyou're looking at the jury and when you have a jury\nwhere nine days into the deliberations at least five of\nthem voted that Mr. Fry was not guilty. They told the\njudge that they were at an impasse. This jury struggled\nmightily with this evidence.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would you help me with one\nthing I'm not terribly clear about, though. Is it clear\nwhich -- what side the magistrate thought had the burden\nof persuasion?\nMR. HALTOM: It is not, and it seems as\nthough, looking at the language that the magistrate\njudge utilized in his findings and recommendations, that\nhe was looking to me, to Mr. Fry, to meet that burden.\nAnd I quoted his language in my brief and to the Ninth\nCircuit and I argued to the Ninth Circuit that the\nburden of persuasion had been improperly allocated to\nMr. Fry. However, that issue was simply not addressed\nin the Ninth Circuit's opinion.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Does your opponent now\nconcede that the State has the burden?\nMR. HALTOM: Yes, Respondent concedes that\ntheir burden -- that it's their burden --\nJUSTICE BREYER: How do they say that after\nI thought I wrote an opinion for the majority of the\nCourt which said this concept is not applicable in --\nwhen you're reviewing a record for harmless error. It's\nnot a question of presenting evidence. What I think it\nsaid is that it's not a question of presentation of\nevidence. In such a case, we think it's conceptually\nclear for the judge to ask directly, do I the judge\nthink that the error substantially influenced the\njudge's -- the jury's decision? Now, maybe I was wrong,\nbut I think there was a majority of the Court that\nagreed with it.\nMR. HALTOM: Yes, Your Honor. And I think\nyour point, as I understood it, in O'Neal was that it\nanalytically does not make sense --\nJUSTICE BREYER: To talk about burdens of\nproof?\nMR. HALTOM: -- when the appellate court is\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. But that's my basic\nquestion in this case and it's a serious question.\nSuppose I think, which I do think, that I as a judge can\nconscientiously review a record and decide for myself\nwhether I think this error of the judge was harmless,\nand if I really try I can bring myself to understand\nthis question. Regardless of what I think, could\nanother judge, say a State judge, reasonably have\nthought the opposite? I can do that mentally.\nYou try to get me to make more fine\ndistinctions than that, I cannot do it. I can't. I'm\nsorry. I admit it.\nNow, if that's the state of mind that I can\nget myself into -- and I believe that's true of many\njudges -- how do I write words that are realistic in\nthis area?\nMR. HALTOM: I think that that's a question,\nYour Honor, that this court has struggled with. As\nJustice Scalia pointed out in his concurring opinion in\nDominguez Benitez, that we're talking about with these\nharmless error standards ineffable gradations of\nprobability that are beyond even the judicial mind to\ngrasp. But I think if we just tie it to the facts of\nthis case, I think that in the explanation you just gave\nthat there is no reasonable judge who could look at this\ncase and conclude --\nJUSTICE ALITO: There are many situations in\nwhich an appellate court has to apply a legal standard\nto facts in criminal cases and civil cases. In a\ncriminal case, an issue on appeal could be whether\nthere's sufficient evidence to support the verdict. Do\nyou think there's a burden of persuasion on appeal on\nall of those issues?\nMR. HALTOM: With respect to a standard\nsufficiency analysis, no, Justice Alito. It's just a\nquestion for the appellate judge to discern, was there\nsufficient evidence in the record reviewing the evidence\nin the light most favorable to the prosecution.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What's the difference\nbetween that and applying any harmless error standard?\nIt's exactly the same kind of analysis. It's a\ndifferent legal test, but you're applying, you're\napplying the law to facts.\nMR. HALTOM: I agree. And I don't quarrel\nat all with the way that the court described -- said\nthat looking at the prejudice inquiry or a harmless\nerror inquiry in the O'Neal case, that it doesn't fit to\nlook at it in terms of the allocation of burden. I\ndon't think that this case ultimately turns on that,\nexcept to the extent that the magistrate judge when he\nwrote his finding and recommendations that were adopted\nby the district court judge did state that he was\nlooking to Mr. Fry to make the sufficient showing --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you talking about\nwhat's on the bottom of page 181 of the joint appendix?\nThat was the only place that I found where the\nmagistrate expressed a view on this. It reads: \"The\ncourt does not find that there has been\" -- \"the court\ndoes find that there has been an insufficient showing.\nSo that \"insufficient showing\" means showing by the\nPetitioner.\" Is that what you're relying on?\nMR. HALTOM: Yes. That's exactly what I'm\nrelying on, Your Honor.\nSo, going back to specifically the facts of\nthis case, this Court could, as I indicated earlier,\nwithout regard to the thorny Chapman versus Brecht\nquestion, decide this case solely in terms of, under\nBrecht, does Mr. Fry prevail; and we look at the nature\nof the constitutional violation that occurred.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That wouldn't help\nus resolve the conflict in the circuits between which\nstandard is applicable, though, right?\nMR. HALTOM: No, it certainly would not,\nYour Honor. And this Court may very well deem that to\nbe necessary. But I think also that this Court\nfashioning a decision which is faithful to the\nrequirement that -- or the principle that Kotteakos is\nan exacting standard, would also be an important\nconstitutional principle. In a case like this, where\nthere has been no Chapman review and where the Chapman\ncourt stated that we need a rigorous harmless error\nstandard in order to safeguard convictions, safeguard\nagainst erroneous convictions where there is a close\nquestion of guilt or innocence, that hasn't happened in\nthis case and it would be appropriate for this Court to\nfashion a rule or holding in this case that would ensure\nthat that happens.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And that would put 2254\nout of sync with 2255, where I understand if it's a\nFederal conviction then it's always Brecht on\npost-conviction relief?\nMR. HALTOM: As I understand that question,\nthe Solicitor General pointed out in the introduction of\nits amicus brief that there are some 2255 cases where\nthere's been an intervening change in the law which\ncould involve this question of Brecht versus Chapman.\nAnd I've cited in my brief a district court case, United\nStates versus Monsanto, where the court concluded, in\naccordance with the position that I'm advocating, that\nit makes no sense for a reviewing court in a habeas\nproceeding to apply the Brecht standard blindly without\nregard to what was done in prior proceedings, but rather\nthere's no need for deference, where the -- the big\nissue in Brecht, as I understand it, was this Court was\nconcerned about simply repeating a harmless error\nanalysis that the State court had already done; and\nwe're not asking this Court to do that in this case.\nThe same concern, Justice Ginsburg, holds\nover in certain limited 2255 cases.\nIf I may save the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Haltom.\nMr. Moody.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROSS C. MOODY\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. MOODY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nFederal habeas is limited in scope and\npurpose. It is not a continuation of the appellate\nprocess. Rather, it is an extraordinary remedy limited\nby fundamental concepts of federalism, comity, and State\nsovereignty. In Brecht, this court held that the\nstringent Chapman standard was inappropriate for use on\ncollateral review. Instead, in order to strike a proper\nbalance between State and Federal interests, the actual\nprejudice standard of substantial and injurious effect\non the verdict should be used in collateral cases.\nPetitioner is asking for an exception to\nthis rule. He claims that if he did not receive Chapman\nreview in State court, he should receive it on Federal\nhabeas. That was not the rule in Brecht and it should\nnot be adopted by this Court here. The Brecht decision\ndid not state an exception based on the State standard\nused. The key in Brecht was that appropriate balance\nbetween the Federal Government and the State. This\nCourt has never treated cases where there was not a\nstate Chapman finding differently from other cases. It\napplies Brecht throughout. In the Penry case and in the\nO'Neal case there was no Chapman finding in state court,\nyet this Court applied Brecht and made no comment about\nthat.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You said in your brief\nthat the remedy, if the Petitioner wants to assure he's\ngoing to get Chapman review someplace, then he should\nhave sought cert -- direct review from the State court's\nconviction. Did you say that?\nMR. MOODY: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But realistically, the\nlikelihood that such a petition would be successful,\npassing the problem that the Petitioner is not likely to\nhave a lawyer, does the likelihood that this Court would\ngrant cert on such a question is very slim.\nMR. MOODY: I agree, the likelihood of the\ncert grant in that circumstance is slim but it does not\nchange the fact that once you come to court under 2254,\nyou are asking for collateral review. And in collateral\nreview, it's inappropriate to apply the Chapman\nstandard.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose you could say\nthat of all the questions that go into habeas under\n2254, that they could have brought up directly but the\nchances are their being taken here are negligible?\nMR. MOODY: I, I agree with that, Your\nHonor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if the\nState court had conducted a Chapman review, erroneously,\nhow would that be reviewed under Federal habeas? You\nwould ask under AEDPA whether it was an unreasonable\napplication of Chapman?\nMR. MOODY: Yes, Your Honor. First you\nwould ask if it was an unreasonable application of\nChapman. If you found that it was not, then the case is\nover, there's no need to grant the writ. If you found\nthat it was, you would proceed and do a Brecht analysis.\nAnd that's what we learned from --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That seems awfully\nrefined, doesn't it, to do two different analyses? Is\nthis an -- is this an unreasonable application of\nChapman? And then apply the Brecht standard after\ndetermining that it was an unreasonable application of\nChapman?\nMR. MOODY: I don't disagree. I'm merely\ntrying to make sense of the various decisions in this,\nin this arena. There's some tension between the Esparza\ndecision and other decisions of the Court; and one has\nto find a place for AEDPA standard. So we would not\nobject to simply an application of Brecht which is what\nthis Court has always done. But as far as it seems to\nsuggest there may be an interim step.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose we apply Brecht.\nThis is what I'm having to little trouble with but I'd\nappreciate your commenting or straightening this out.\nThe Ninth Circuit holds two things according to the SG\nin the briefs. He states them very well. The first is\nlet's look at this witness. The testimony was excluded.\nNow the Ninth Circuit says that exclusion was\nunreasonable of -- an unreasonable application of\nclearly established Federal law, because that testimony\nof the witness that was excluded was not only material,\nit would have substantially bolstered the claim of\ninnocence. So that's their finding on the merits.\nThen they go on to say, but the exclusion\nwas harmless.\nHow could both those things be true? How\ncould it be true that the reason that there was error in\nexcluding it was that the evidence is so important that\nit substantially bolsters the claim of innocence?\nThat's one thing they say.\nBut the exclusion was harmless. I just fail\nto understand how anyone could think both those things.\nBut maybe in the context of the case it was possible,\nbut that's what I'd appreciate your explaining.\nMR. MOODY: I think that the explanation is\nas follows. When you're analyzing the denial of a\ndefense type of evidence, a Chambers claim, you first\nlook to see how it fit into the defense. And that is\nwhat they were doing. You're not looking at the entire\ncase. You're looking only at the defense.\nAnd so in the sense that something is better\nthan nothing, adding a twelfth witness instead of eleven\nmay improve the defense case.\nAnd yet nonetheless, when you move to the\nnext question, which is, was there a substantial and\ninjurious effect on the verdict in the case, and now\nyou're not just looking at the defense, you're looking\nat everything that was available to the jury -- it may\nbe that there was still so much other evidence that it\ncould overcome whatever increase you received on the\ndefense.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why is it necessary for us\nto try to reconcile those two statements? The Ninth\nCircuit may well have been wrong in finding that there\nwas a violation at all, but we have to assume that, for\npurposes of the question that's presented to us. So why\nshouldn't we just analyze the harmless error question\nindependently of what they said about whether there was\na Chambers violation?\nMR. MOODY: We would not object to that.\nI'm trying to -- I'm trying to assist Justice Breyer in\nthat perceived imbalance between a finding of a\nsubstance above and then a finding of harmless error\nbefore.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, every time evidence is\nexcluded on the grounds that it is cumulative, or is the\nequivalent of a 403 balancing in Federal Court, there's\nnot a constitutional error under Chambers and related\ncases, is there?\nMR. MOODY: Yes. We agree. That's\ncertainly the law of this Court. And in this, in --\nwell, let me move on. I'd like to make a couple of\nother points.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I go just back to\nJustice Breyer's question for a second?\nMR. MOODY: Sure.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And I mean, I think your\nanswer to Justice Breyer was a very good answer as a, as\nsort of a general statement. But in -- would you agree\nthat in this case, if we -- if we do proceed, number\none, to agree with you that Brecht is the standard, and\nwe then do proceed to apply Brecht here or to determine\nwhether Brecht was properly applied here, that in this\nparticular case, the, the record indicates that the case\nwas so close that there would have to be a finding of\nharmful error, or at least it would be impossible to\nfind harmless error. Even applying Brecht clear.\nAnd you know what I'm getting at. I mean,\nfive weeks of deliberation. The question after,\nwhatever it was, two weeks, and four ballots, and so on.\nObviously this -- this case was just to tottering on the\nedge. So even if we, if we do get to the point of\napplying Brecht, wouldn't it be impossible to say that\nhe's -- he gets no relief under Brecht?\nMR. MOODY: No, I would disagree with that.\nYou've the sixth court to hear this case. The prior\nfive have all rejected his claim. And while --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But two or three of those\ndid it on an improper ground, that you agree with now,\ndon't you?\nMR. MOODY: No, I don't agree with that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: For purposes of argument.\nMR. MOODY: For purposes of argument I do.\nThe district court and the Ninth Circuit both applied\nBrecht and found that this was not an error which --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It was two to one in the\nNinth Circuit.\nMR. MOODY: This is true.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Judge Rawlinson I think\nsaid that using the Brecht standard, that there was\nactual prejudice.\nMR. MOODY: Yes, she did. There was a\ndissent in the Ninth Circuit.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't this the -- I may\nhave it wrong -- but isn't this the case in which the\nwitness was unique not cumulative because she was the\nonly one who was completely disinterested.\nMR. MOODY: No. I would disagree with that.\nShe's been characterized that way. But, and I want to\npoint out that, I would like to clarify the record in\nresponse to your question, Justice Stevens. You asked\nwhether or not she saw another man commit the murder.\nAnd counsel appeared to agree with you. That was not\nher testimony. Her testimony was that she overheard\nsomeone else confessing to murders that may or may not\nhave been these murders.\nAnd the -- and this was a very long case.\nThis case lasted eleven weeks, it involved a hundred\nwitnesses. You can look at the opinions it produced in\nstate court and in the district court. They're each 100\npages long. It's not unreasonable to expect the jury to\ntake a long time to decide that case.\nNow there are 25 court days of\ndeliberations --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Five, five weeks?\nMR. MOODY: Five weeks, 25 court days, 24 of\nwhich were taken up with read back. Several -- several\nholidays. I mean if you want to go through and look at\nit, now --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do you know of any other\ncase in which the jury deliberated for five weeks?\nMR. MOODY: I haven't attempted to find one.\nIt is a long deliberation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm sure there's an example\nsomewhere, but I -- I practiced law for over 40 years,\nand I never heard of it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: At what point, how many\nweeks had gone by when they said they were hung?\nMR. MOODY: I believe that was -- I keep,\nI've been switching back and forth between calendar days\nand court days. So forgive me. I believe that was on\nthe eighth court day. And at that point, when they\nannounced they were hung, they selected a new foreperson\nand then rolled up their sleeves and went back in and\ndeliberated the case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So --\nMR. MOODY: And after --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Go ahead.\nMR. MOODY: After they selected the new\nforeperson, they asked for 15 read backs, including the\ncrucial evidence in the case. The ballistics experts.\nThey asked for that. They asked for the testimony of\nthe in-custody witness who heard the confession of\nMr. Fry. They asked for Mr. Fry's testimony.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Did they ask for a read\nback of Mrs. Maples' testimony?\nMR. MOODY: Well, Mrs. Maples' testimony was\nnot admitted. It was excluded.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Oh, that's right. Of\ncourse.\nMR. MOODY: But they did not --\nsignificantly they did not ask for read back of the\nwitnesses who testified similarly to, to Ms. Maples.\nThe third party culpability case was basically not\ncredited by the jury. They did not a read back of those\nwitnesses.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, maybe, maybe you'd\nend up --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, maybe a critical\nwitness was left out. That argues the other way, I\nthink.\nMR. MOODY: I would encourage the Court to\ncarefully look at what Ms. Maples was going to say. If\nyou look in her own words, and I'm quoting: I was just\nin and out of the room. I just listened to bits and\npieces of it. And that's at joint appendix 10. This,\nthis witness may have been Mr. Hurtz's cousin, and not\nhis ex-girlfriend, or his ex-girlfriend's mother, but\nshe did not have very much to say about this. She said\nshe didn't hear the beginning of the statement. She\ncould not tell you whether it was a serious discussion.\nShe was in and out of the room. She heard only bits and\npieces.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But what she heard was that\nthey were going to kill, this other person was going to\nkill a man and a woman, and it turned out that that was\nthe crime at issue.\nMR. MOODY: With respect, that's not what\nshe heard.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What did she hear?\nMR. MOODY: What she heard was a statement\nthat he had killed a man and a woman. And this was not\nimmediately after the offense. This is 18 months after\nthe offense, this is not next day.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do you think -- do you\nthink, do you think I should do this? I'm still\nlooking, I'm worried about on the one hand, as you are,\nhaving this Court announce too many six-part tests, and\nhaving a lot of words and it becomes easy to make a\nmistake for a judge and then you never finish a\nproceeding. I'm worried about that, as are you.\nMR. MOODY: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: At the same time, I think\nwhat counts is what the judge does, the reviewing judge.\nNot what -- quite what the test says.\nSo there has to be a conscientious effort to\ndecide, was there -- was it harmless? Could a\nreasonable jurist in California have concluded the\nopposite? Okay.\nSo maybe we should do it in this case. We\nsimply try ourselves to go through this record, make\nthat determination to show by example, rather than by\ntrying to find a form of words.\nMR. MOODY: Well, you don't do it very\noften. I understand that that's something you could do\nif you wanted to. I think that this is just a classic\ncase where two courts applied the Brecht standard and\nreached their conclusions and there's nothing really\nremarkable about it.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The third party\nperpetrator that Maples was going to talk about\naccording to the prosecution's theory, was Hurtz or\nHearst?\nMR. MOODY: Hurtz. Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And there -- there was a\nlink between Hurtz, there was an acquaintanceship\nbetween Hurtz and the victim?\nMR. MOODY: That's right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Was that established in\nother testimony or would that all have come out just\nonly through Maples?\nMR. MOODY: Actually, I'm thinking about my\nanswer because I was thinking about Borelli. There were\nthree third party culpability, potential targets in this\ncase. And I believe that Hurtz, the testimony of\nseveral of the witness who were admitted did testify of\na link between Cindy Bell and Hurtz.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Otherwise, I mean, they\ncouldn't have found it was cumulative if -- if that had\nnot been the case.\nMR. MOODY: In order to -- I need to correct\nthe record on that as well. The trial judge did not\nfind that this was cumulative. He found a lack of\nfoundation. What happened was, was Ms. Maples was\noffered as a witness --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But -- on appellate review\nin California, they found it cumulative, didn't they?\nMR. MOODY: The alternative prejudice\nholding, the footnote 17, they said it would have been\ncumulative.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Right. Okay.\nMR. MOODY: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And they -- they couldn't\nhave found that if there hadn't been some evidence on\nHurtz, apart from Maples?\nMR. MOODY: Oh, that's right. Yes. There\nwas, and that's really my point. My point is that 11\nthird party culpability witnesses were allowed to\ntestify in this trial. And one was excluded.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: How did Hurtz's name enter\ninto the trial?\nMR. MOODY: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why did anybody mention\nhim?\nMR. MOODY: Well, for one thing, he was\ncalled to testify and asked if he killed these people.\nMr. Hurtz testified at this trial. The jury got to see\nhim, they got to look him in the eye, they got to hear\nhim on direct, they got to hear him on cross. And they\ndid not ask for a read back of that testimony.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And if Maples' testimony\nhad come in, I presume they could have cross-examined\nhim on the basis of Maples' testimony?\nMR. MOODY: Well, he stated he never said he\nkilled these people. And he, he stated he'd never said\nhe killed a man and a woman in a car. So it -- it went\nto what Maples would have said, and also --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Did he say he'd killed\npeoples otherwise, or at other times?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MOODY: He also denied doing that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but then at that\npoint in time, Maples, Maples' conviction -- Maples'\ntestimony becomes, assuming there's a foundation,\nbecomes more relevant.\nMR. MOODY: I would disagree, simply because\nshe says she didn't hear the conversation well enough to\nreally give her testimony any true probative value in\nthe case because she was in and out of the room. She\ndidn't hear the beginning. She didn't hear the end.\nAnd when she's asked, was it a serious discussion, she\nsays, I don't know. So this could be -- this could be\nsomething very different --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's classic going to\nthe weight of the evidence. That goes to the weight,\nnot the admissibility.\nMR. MOODY: Ordinarily I would agree with\nthat. And if we knew, Your Honor, that he was speaking\nabout these killings, then certainly it would go to the\nweight. But since he was speaking about killings that\nshe said she didn't know if they were in California, New\nJersey, she didn't know when they occurred, and\ntherefore -- in California we ask that before you\npresent third party culpability evidence you tie it to\nthis crime.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So we don't assume that\nhe's committed a whole lot of killings, I don't suppose?\nMR. MOODY: Well, it's -- he may have\ncommitted other killings, but if did not confess to\ncommitting these killings then there's no probative\nvalue to her testimony.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think the\nquestion of the application of Brecht is included within\nthe questions presented?\nMR. MOODY: No. I briefed it because I was\nconcerned that the Court might reach it, but I don't\nthink it is fairly presented.\nThe only other point that I wanted to make\nis that if one accepts Petitioner's rule it will\nbasically swallow up the Brecht standard and return to a\nnear wholesale application of Chapman on collateral\nreview. As Tyson and Trigg pointed out, many, many\ntimes Petitioners come to court and they have a case\nwhere there was no finding of constitutional error in\nState court and therefore no Chapman application, but\nthey're going to assert that in Federal court. And so\nif in every one of those cases you apply Chapman, then\nyou really have reduced application of Brecht.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But on the other side,\nState courts say, we don't have, we don't have to bother\nin any case with Chapman because when it goes over into\nthe Federal court they're going to apply Brecht.\nMR. MOODY: I don't think we should assume\nthat the State courts are going to do that. I think\nthat what -- it's sort of like what we said earlier in\nthe argument, Your Honor, where not every evidentiary\nruling is a constitutional violation. I would say most\nof them are not. And this Court has not drawn a bright\nline of exactly where that is. So in many cases, this\nis just an erroneous exclusion of evidence at best. And\nso, therefore, the State court would not be going to a\nChapman standard because it would not be finding error.\nAnd with that, I'm prepared to submit.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Millett?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS\nCURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT\nMS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe distinction between collateral review\nand direct review is deeply rooted in the law, and what\nPetitioner is asking is to have the standard of review\nfor harmlessness in collateral review become the same\nstandard as direct review whenever the courts on direct\nreview got Chapman wrong or unreasonably applied it.\nThat is the exact same argument Mr. Brecht made in this\nCourt. He got Chapman review. They cited Chapman.\nThey didn't cite it here. That's the only difference.\nMr. Brecht came to this Court and said they\nunreasonably applied Chapman review and I should get it\nagain on habeas, and this Court said that there is a\ndeep difference, a deep distinction, between collateral\nreview and direct review and that distinction turns upon\nthe fundamental rule of habeas corpus, and that is not\nto sit here as the sixth court on direct review of a\nlong record where difficult calls were made. It is to\ncorrect fundamental miscarriages of justice, grievous\nwrongs that have caused custody in violation of\nconstitutional --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask two questions\nand then you can proceed. One, do you take a position\non who has the burden of persuasion? That's the first\nquestion. And do you have an opinion on proper\napplication of Brecht in this case?\nMS. MILLETT: If I can adopt\nJustice Breyer's language from O'Neal and say that this\nCourt eschewed couching this discussion in terms of\nburden of persuasion. We accept O'Neal's holding what\nthen there is equipoise, which did not what happened in\nthis case, the tie goes to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you do agree if it\nwere in equipoise the State would have the burden?\nMS. MILLETT: The tie would go to the\nprisoner, yes. Were it in equipoise, because the State\nwould have the burden the State would lose. I don't\nthink that's what happened in this case. I think what\nJustice Breyer, what this Court said O'Neal said is, the\nway you articulated it, instead of burden of proof is\nthat it's a level of conviction on the part of the court\nand what the judge will say in, what the court said in\nO'Neal, is, do I think the error substantially\ncontributed to the jury's verdict? And that is\nessentially what the court said here on 181 at the very\nbottom when it said \"The court doesn't find that there's\nan insufficient showing\" -- that's the same way of\nsaying I haven't been persuaded -- that the error\ncontributed to the verdict. So I don't think that this\ncase in any sense could turn upon, whether we call it\nthe burden of persuasion or the proper level of\nconviction on the part of the court. This court was not\npersuaded and that is all that matters. When the court\nis not persuaded and not left in equipoise, the prisoner\nloses.\nThe second question you asked was whether we\nhave a position on application of Brecht, and we do.\nWe've laid it out in our brief. We think that in no\nsense does this record support the notion, support the\nargument, that there was a substantial and injurious\neffect when the twelfth out of eleven witnesses was\nexcluded, talking about third party culpability. And\nthat requires not just looking at what, in isolation,\nwhat evidence was in there about Mr. Hurtz. There was I\nthink six or seven witnesses who said they heard him\neither say he did it or he was there or he was involved.\nBut it requires looking at the whole record.\nAnd there were -- the defense here was not a Hurtz\nversus Fry. This was a case where the defense did an\nexcellent job. It was a well defended case, and threw\nup a buffet of options for the jury, none of which it\nbought on.\nIn the third trial you had what you didn't\nhad in the prior trials. You had ballistics evidence\nthat linked his gun to the crime. You have his own\nadmission, his own testimony, that he left the house\nthat night with the gun, with the bullets, and went out\nin the truck that was seen at -- a truck of the same\ntype, that was seen at the crime scene.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I have the same problem\nJustice Souter does, in all candor. The jury takes five\nweeks to decide the case and there's a fairly\ninteresting bit of testimony that doesn't get in. And\nto say to be totally satisfied it didn't have an\ninjurious effect on the deliberations is a close\nquestion, I think.\nMS. MILLETT: Well, two answers. If it's a\nclose question, if AEDPA and if Kotteakos and Brecht\nmean anything, it's that the close calls go to the State\nand are not overturned by the sixth court on review.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but an equally divided\ncall goes the other way.\nMS. MILLETT: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If it's not just a close\ncall, but if it's equal, it goes the other way.\nMS. MILLETT: It is, and no one has thought\nthis was equal. The two courts -- the three courts, the\nCalifornia Court of Appeals also said in any event\nthere's no possible prejudice.\nNow, how they could say no possible\nprejudice under a State standard and still say, ah, but\nit would have affected the verdict under Chapman, is not\nsomething I'm able to understand. So I think you have\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Neither am I. But I draw a\ndifferent conclusion from it from the one you're\ndrawing.\nMS. MILLETT: I guess I misunderstand your\npoint, because I think when the court said there's no\npossible prejudice --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, I cannot accept the\nState -- the conclusion that there was no possible\nprejudice, on the premises that Justice Stevens a moment\nago and I a moment before sort of put out. I just do\nnot find that a reasonable conclusion.\nMS. MILLETT: Well, again, even if the Court\nthinks there may have been some chance, may have been --\nyou know -- relevant testimony -- this Court can well\ndisagree and can conclude that this was abuse of\ndiscretion. If it were Federal Rule of Evidence 403,\nyou could decide this was a an abuse of discretion.\nWhether it was unconstitutional, so clearly\nunconstitutional as to merit under AEDPA and under\nBrecht reversal of the conviction 12 years after the\nfact --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the AEDPA\nquestion was out of it because that hasn't been -- there\nwas no cross-appeal on that question. I thought it was\na given, a given in this case, that the California\ncourts did not apply or unreasonably applied clearly\nestablished Federal law.\nI didn't think that was an issue in the\ncase. I think we took it on the assumption that it was\nsuch an error.\nMS. MILLETT: Again, the Respondents in this\ncase have not conceded constitutional error, and in\ntheir brief they repeat that. And I think there's a\nquestion whether a court should --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's not raised here.\nThere was no cross-appeal from that.\nMS. MILLETT: Well, a Respondent is entitled\nto defend on any ground supported by the record. But\neven assuming that, we'll assume the error, assumes that\nthere was an error and one assumes that it was -- which\nis hard for me to get to, but one assumes it was clearly\nunconstitutional in this close call, the type of call\nthat's made hundreds of times in every trial, balancing\nthis, and the combination of lack of foundation and\ncumulativeness. It's hard for me to understand when\nthat rises to the level of unconstitutionality.\nBut if we assume that it did, you have the\ntwo courts that applied the Brecht standard here. And\nthe district court decision here is nearly 100 pages\nlong. It's a very careful, methodical analysis.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's because there were\nmany, many issues raised.\nMS. MILLETT: There's many issues, but also\nit was being careful and it was being very methodical.\nAnd it went through this and it went through this\nrecord. That court went through true this record, more\nthan 5,000 transcript pages, 11 week of trial, more than\n100 witnesses. And it was on that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose if we're\ngoing to apply the Brecht standard ourselves, we would\nhave to do the same thing.\nMS. MILLETT: I think that's what this Court\nhas said.\nThe other thing I want to get back to is the\nquestion about the length of jury deliberations. Sure,\nthis was really wrong. Now, they changed forepersons in\nmidstream and got a reasonable doubt instruction\nrepeated. Who knows what happened. But what I will not\nconcede -- I will concede it's long, but I will not\nconcede that the mere fact of length of deliberations\nsays anything about if this one particular error in\napplying a balancing test substantially affected the\nverdict. I think the length of deliberations is so\nincredibly speculative.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You will concede it was a\nclose case, won't you?\nMS. MILLETT: I will concede it was, I will\nconcede it was a difficult case.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If you take five weeks\nit's pretty clearly a close case.\nMS. MILLETT: That's right. But you know,\nthe whole the point of federal habeas corpus is that\nthis is not filling in the gaps in direct review. We're\nnot going to give you --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's no evidence\nor inference that it was close on the alternative\nmurderer theory, which is the only thing that Maples'\ntestimony goes to.\nMS. MILLETT: That's exactly right. In\nfact, if you look at the closing arguments, Mr. Hurtz\nhas a couple of references in a two-day closing\nargument. That was not the centerpiece of his case.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It has to be close on an\nalternative murderer. It wasn't suicide. Obviously, if\nhe didn't do it, somebody else did. So if it's a close\ncase from the first, it's obviously a close case for the\nsecond.\nMS. MILLETT: No, but as to who did it and\nwhether Hurtz did it or whether -- remember, what the\ndefense is trying to show is not who did it; it's that\nthis person didn't do it, and whether it was them or\nsomeone else is what we don't know.\nAgain, this is Federal habeas corpus before\nthis Court, and I don't think that the misapplication of\na valid rule of evidence, which is not what this Court\nhas in Chambers, Holmes, or any of the cases that were\ninvolved, was so -- that simply disallowed the twelfth\nout of eleven witnesses on third party culpability is so\nclearly erroneous, it was so clearly impacting the\nverdict in this case, as to warrant a retrial 15 years\nafter the crime.\nAnd yes, the jury -- it was close in the\nsense that they worked a long hard time. But at the end\nof the day, they were unanimous. There's nothing close\nabout unanimous. And I think it would be the wrong\nmessage to say that a jury that works as hard as this\none did, did the readbacks, culled through this\nrecord --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but we don't know\nwhat they would have done if they had this evidence that\nwas excluded. That's the problem.\nMS. MILLETT: One never knows that in habeas\ncorpus. But what you do when you look at what they were\nfocusing on, they were focusing on the two ballistics\nexperts. They had them read back right next each other.\nThey made that call. It's their job to do it.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the reason they may\nhave been doing that is that they may very well have\nthought that the evidence indicating third party guilt\nwas close and perhaps persuasive and what they wanted to\nknow was whether the evidence going specifically to this\ndefendant was strong enough to overcome it.\nMS. MILLETT: May I answer? One would have\nexpected at least one readback on third party\nculpability instead of three readbacks of Mr. Fry's\ntestimony which put himself that night with the gun in\nthe truck, and which he said -- you know -- and\nbeforehand he agreed he might have said he wanted to\nblow them away.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Haltom, you have three minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF VICTOR S. HALTOM\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. HALTOM: Thank you. The trial counsel\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Mr. Haltom, before you go\ndrifting, counsel, into the evidentiary questions in the\ncase, I have one question. Two cases. A, Hurtz did not\ntestify at all. B, he did. Is the foundation ruling\nany different in the two cases insofar as Maples'\ntestimony or is it the same? I.e., is there a lesser\nshowing for foundation if Hurtz did testify?\nMR. HALTOM: I think that possibly the\nfoundation with Hurtz there could be increased. The\njury sought Mr. Hurtz.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, you mean, oh, you mean\nmore? You have to be more strict for foundation after\nHurtz testified? I was suggesting the opposite.\nMR. HALTOM: Well, I was just thinking that\nhis presence there would be relevant. The jury actually\nsaw him. They heard a truck driver describing, a\nneutral truck driver, describing the actual killer, who\nin no way fit the description of Mr. Fry.\nUnfortunately, the record doesn't indicate what Mr.\nHurtz looked like, but the jury saw it. And if the jury\nsaw that that truck driver was describing a man that\nlooked like Mr. Hurtz, then that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there were all kinds\nof infirmities in that truck driver's testimony,\nincluding the time, the timing of the murder.\nMR. HALTOM: There were infirmities in his\ntestimony, Your Honor. However, he came from Missouri,\nso maybe he was looking at a Missouri clock. We don't\nknow. But why would that man make up a story? He has\nno axe to grind in this case. And then his testimony is\ncorroborated by a gentleman who sees him immediately\nafter it and says: He looked like he had just seen a\nghost, and described seeing a double execution-style\nmurder. Now --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That was all presented to\nthe jury, right?\nMR. HALTOM: That was all presented to the\njury. However, Ms. Maples' testimony was not, and\ncounsel did not argue that heavily focused on Mr. Hurtz'\nguilt. She certainly did argue it, but the reason that\nshe didn't is because, as the Court of Appeals, the\nCalifornia Court of Appeals, said, the other seven\nwitnesses who said Mr. Hurtz said he had killed the\nBells were all described as having been flimsy witness\nwho gave contradictory unbelievable testimony.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how strong is\nthis witness, who didn't even know if it was a serious\nconversation, didn't hear the beginning of it, and\ndidn't -- couldn't tell whether he was talking about\nsomething that happened 10 years before or 2 days\nbefore?\nMR. HALTOM: Mr. Chief Justice, she was\nextremely strong. Page JA-78 in the joint appendix,\nRespondent concedes she was the only unbiased witness\nconcerning Mr. Hurtz's -- concerning Mr. Hurtz. She\nheard this, her cousin, saying he shot a man and a woman\nin a parked car, first shooting the woman in the head,\nthen shooting the man, getting blood all over himself.\nThat linked up with all the other confessions in this\ncase. Interlinking confessions just like in Chambers\nwere deemed to provide adequate assurance of\nreliability.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
