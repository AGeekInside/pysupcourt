        "content": "(10:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow on number 00-201, the New York Times Company versus\nJonathan Tasini.\nMr. Tribe.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE H. TRIBE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. TRIBE: Mr. Chief Justice and may it please\nthe Court:\nThe parties on both courts below agree on at\nleast two things, first, that section 201(c) represents a\ncompromise that assures freelance authors that they may\ncontrol and exploit their individual contributions to\ncollective works like newspapers and magazines in new\nanthologies and serializations and screenplays and other\nderivative works unless they've expressly transferred that\nright.\nThe parties are also agreed as are both courts\nbelow that 201(c) assures the publication of collective\nworks that the publisher of such collective works has the\naggregate right to publish any article in the collective\nwork both in publishing the collective work itself of\ncourse, but also in publishing that article, quote, as\npart of any revision of that collective work, again unless\nthere has been an express transfer of the right.\nNow the principal impetus for this measure was a\nrather strong wish to undo several quite notorious rulings\nlike that of the Southern District of New York in the\nGeisel case in 1968 which of course involved the legendary\nDr. Seuss and denied him the right to stop the\nunauthorized distribution of toy dolls that were derived\nfrom cartoons that he had published decades earlier.\nThere is no hint at all in the history of this\nmeasure and I think no hint in the way it's written that\nmicrofilm, for example, which had been in use for some 40\nyears at the time this measure was passed and which people\nused to make copies of individual articles more often than\nto make copies of entire cumbersome periodicals was seen\nby anyone as a problem to be addressed or solved by\n201(c).\nQUESTION: When you say people used to make\ncopies you mean the ultimate user?\nMR. TRIBE: The ultimate end user.\nQUESTION: Yes, but the person who produced the\nmicrofilm or the microfiche produced the entire work. It\nproduced the article as part of the entire work, not to be\nshown. When a person went to the machine he would only\nlook to the article that he was interested in.\nMR. TRIBE: As do we, Justice Scalia, in Nexis\nand in the CD-ROMs, the entire text with the exception of\ncertain graphics that cannot be handled by ASCII is put\nin.\nQUESTION: When you would look at a newspaper on\nmicrofilm you would get the whole page. You would probably\nwant to single out a particular article but it was the\nwhole page that appeared to you.\nMR. TRIBE: That's right and in this case you\nbasically conduct a search under the algorithms that are\nused by Nexis, conduct a search of the entire periodical\nwhether you call for a particular topic --\nQUESTION: But it's not all in one piece, is it.\nMR. TRIBE: Well it's in virtual -- it's in --\nit's certainly not -- it's not a newspaper that we're used\nto. You can't drink your coffee to it or wrap your fish,\nin it but that really is a red herring, if I may say so.\nQUESTION: Well, but I suppose that it has\nremoved the photographs and the ads. It's been\ndisaggregated and what you see are the individual articles\nfrom a particular --\nMR. TRIBE: At any one time, but with a very\nsimple prompt of about 15 characters you can get the\nentire periodical.\nQUESTION: But at least in let's talk about the\nNexis for a minute. You don't see ads and the photographs\nand all that. But you can pull out an entire article that\nhad appeared in the Times.\nMR. TRIBE: You certainly can. That's why we're\n--\nQUESTION: Now, I assume that the publisher can\nenter a contract with an independent author to cover the\nsubsequent use in database material and --\nMR. TRIBE: Yes, and for decades --\nQUESTION: Probably the publisher does that\ntoday --\nMR. TRIBE: Sometimes. What's happened, Justice\nO'Connor, it appears that for at least 20 years people\nhave assumed because no one complained of this practice\nthat the standard contract was not limited to the print\nmedium. Now as of 1995, for example, the New York times\nmade clear they would not make contracts with people for\nprint only.\nQUESTION: I notice, though, that the head of\nthe copyright division has at least written a letter that\nlooks like she thinks the court below was absolutely\nright.\nMR. TRIBE: That's right. On the basis of a\ndisplay argument that is disclaimed by the Tasini\nrespondents that wasn't made below and that doesn't make\nsense under the statute, because quite clearly if we are\ninvolved in reproduction and distribution display is\ncovered in the intersection of those.\nIt's not, I think, a serious argument. You\nnotice the solicitor general did not decide to come into\nthis case. But you're right about the register of\ncopyright. However that --\nQUESTION: Mr. Tribe, does that view of the\nregister of copyright relate at all to one effort that was\nmade in the 76 act and to give the independent artisan,\nthe artist, the author more muscle vis-a-vis the publisher\nor the patron than before?\nMR. TRIBE: It's an interesting theory, Justice\nGinsberg, but I've tried to imagine how by carving this\npie into two pieces one could give the older, the other,\nmore muscle.\nQUESTION: One could pay that's --\nMR. TRIBE: Well, in 1995, I was saying a minute\nago, the New York Times said we're not going to run\narticles print only. It would be kind of pointless now\nwhen almost everything has to go onto the Internet or be\npreserved in some other way other than print and they said\nthat our contract will automatically cover print and\nelectronic rights. And what's interesting is that the\nroyalties didn't change a cent after that.\nI think it's a kind of belief in magic that\nleads some people to think that if there's an inequity of\nbargaining power it will be solved by creating two estates\nrather than one. In fact, in the mid 1980s it's\ninteresting that the respondents went to Congress, the\nNational Writers Union went to Congress and tried to get a\nmeasure much more modest than this one, a measure that\nwould say that when there is a demonstrable inequity in\nbargaining power, an unconscionable arrangement, and when\nthat's shown by individualized proof there could be a\ntransfer of rights.\nHere they want a wholesale, global transfer\nwhich I don't think is necessarily going to change\nanything for the future but could have very serious impact\non existing writings whose authors and heirs and assigns\nare going to be extremely difficult to locate.\nQUESTION: So far as the future is concerned,\nMr. Tribe, we're just talking about money, aren't we. I\nmean the people can negotiate one way or the other,\nhowever --\nMR. TRIBE: That's right and all I'm saying is\nthere is not any particular reason to think the deals will\ncome out very differently.\nQUESTION: But at least people evidently think\nit will. They're expending a fair amount of money.\nMR. TRIBE: Well, I think, Justice Scalia, that\nthey think quite rightly that they can get a lot of money\nto settle a case in which, if we were to lose, we and many\nother publishers around the country would have no choice\nbut to engage in defensive deletions of a lot of material\nthat could otherwise expose us to massive statutory\ndamages under the copyright laws. That's why a number of\nPulitzer Prize winning historians have said they're afraid\nof what it will do to their research. That's why the\nAmerican Library Association which is an amicus on their\nside has conceded that it's awfully difficult to find\nthese people and there may be an adverse impact. Even the\nregister of copyright in the letter to which you referred,\nJustice O'Connor said there may be an impact on\nscholarship and research. And I think that's an\nunderstatement.\nQUESTION: Well, for one thing, this is a three\nyear statute of limitations which will --\nMR. TRIBE: I don't know that that will help a\nlot, Justice Ginsburg and the reason is that keeping\nsomething on Nexis or in CD-ROMs that you have in\ncirculation after it has been determined to be infringing\nand letting people potentially have access to it, which\nthe download might be an infringement, would be a new act.\nSo I don't think the statute of limitations will solve the\nproblem.\nQUESTION: It's hard for me to see that that's\ngoing to be the effect in the real world because after all\nthese authors have an interest in exposure, it's just like\na lot of people now no longer have to be artists for hire\nare that anyway, because they will give the copyright to\nthe patron, they want people to get to know who they are.\nMR. TRIBE: I think that's the irony, Justice\nGinsberg. I think the erasures of a lot of these things\nwill not be in the interest of the people whose work may\nbe erased but someone who wrote an article in 1980 and\nmaybe was 60 years old at the time and maybe isn't around\nat the moment, there are a lot of people like that. We\ndon't know how many. We don't know how many articles, but\nthe U.S. News and World Report has already decided in\nanticipation because there's no -- they think no analytic\ndifference between microfilm and some of these products,\ncertainly the GPO CD-ROM which is a photographic copy is\nnot different, they've stopped putting their work on\nmicrofilm.\nThe line drawing problem here, if I may say, is\none of several reasons why recalibrating the balance that\nCongress struck is a particularly inappropriate job for\nthe Court.\nQUESTION: Mr. Tribe, can I pursue this damages\nquestion. I mean, as far as ripping out everything that's\non the systems already, that certainly need not be done by\ncourt decree.\nMR. TRIBE: No, certainly.\nQUESTION: A court can say, you know, taking\nequity into account we're not going to issue such an\ninjunction so the question would be your clients would be\ncompelled to erase all of this stuff because of the\ndamages they would have to pay. What would the damages be\nif, as you say, it was worthless.\nMR. TRIBE: Well under --\nQUESTION: If it was worthless, the damages\nwould be negligeable.\nMR. TRIBE: You would think that, but under 504\ndamages are not measured by the harm to the person who\nsues. There is a provision that says that they can take\nthe -- get the benefit of the presumption that all of our\ngross income was attributable to their contribution and\nthe theory of that would I suppose be that they don't need\na theory because the statute says it, but the theory would\nbe that all of the work we put in electronic form would\nnot have been worth anything if it looked like Swiss\ncheese with stuff missing.\nQUESTION: Rebuttable or irrebuttable?\nMR. TRIBE: It's rebuttable. But they can also\nelect statutory damages which can go up to $30,000 a\nviolation and some courts accept the Nimmer theory of\nmultiple violations per infringement. It would be more\neven, if not, it could be --\nQUESTION: The statutory violation applies only\nto willful violations.\nMR. TRIBE: No, it's more if it's willful. But\nthere is a statutory provision in any event and it would\nbecome willful.\nQUESTION: What's the nonwillful amount?\nMR. TRIBE: I think it's a sliding scale,\nJustice Scalia, and I think there is discretion to set it.\nAnd it can be very low, I think as low as $250 and as high\nas over 10,000, but I have to say I don't remember for\nsure.\nBut the point is there are something like\n100,000 freelance articles just on Nexis. There are\n18,000 journals on Nexis. You don't have to multiply\n100,000 or 50,000 or 20,000 by a very large number to know\nthat a good business judgment for a lot of these companies\nis going to be who wants the litigation, and you couldn't\nput together class actions to solve the problem easily,\ngiven Amchem and Ortiz because of the incredible\nvariability of the contracts of the -- some of them, for\nexample, will have registered the copyright in the article\nwithin three years of its publication and then be eligible\nfor statutory damages, others won't. They'll be\nplaintiff-specific defenses, statutes of limitations and\nlaches. You mentioned the statute of limitations, Justice\nGinsberg.\nIt seems to me that of course that is not a\nreason to read the statute incorrectly but I think --\nQUESTION: I think if we go back to that for\njust one second, because I'd like to go about to where\nJustice O'Connor, I think, started. The part that I'm\nhaving difficulty understanding and I don't actually\nunderstand this is what precisely, precisely say in the\ncase of Nexis was the event that you think the other side\nis saying changed the work from a revised work to a new\nwork. In particular I'm thinking, say, at ten in the\nmorning on May 11th, 2001, the Washington Post has a piece\nof paper, it's called the Washington Post. And then in a\nanalogous form that piece of paper is in its computer.\nAnd then something happens. That is, there's a transfer\nof that information over to Nexis and what, I'd like you\nto focus right on that, because what you -- I want to know\nwhat event in that series of events on that morning we're\ntalking about as being the copying, the unlawful copying.\nMR. TRIBE: That moves beyond revision.\nQUESTION: Yes, in their view in your opinion.\nMR. TRIBE: I assure you, Justice Breyer, I'd\nlove to know at least as much as you would and I hope Mr.\nGold will enlighten us, because --\nQUESTION: All right. Well, then, let me give\nyou a little bit further -- imagine what it might be. It\nmight be this. It might be that there is a person in the\nWashington Post who pushes a button called send, and at\nthat point what is sent is not the electronic and analog\nof the Washington Post several pages, but rather a few\narticles from the Post and then a little later in the day\na few more are sent. And then a little later a few more\nare sent, and when they arrive in Nexis, they are nowhere\nstored in a form that is in any sense analogous to that\npage or several pages in the Washington Post, but rather\nis in a large computer where they are mixed with hunting\nfishing journal and everything else.\nMR. TRIBE: Justice Breyer, the record is\ncompletely unambiguous that nothing like that happens.\nWhat happens is that the computer text itself, the very\nsame computer text that goes to the printing office so\nthat the New York Times then arrives at your front desk.\nQUESTION: -- example is the Post.\nMR. TRIBE: Well the Post, that's fine. I'll\ntake the Washington Post, Washington Post, Washington\nStar, we can pick our paper. The Washington Post, they\nall follow the same protocol. There is a computer text and\nthat text is ASCII readable. That means it can be put in\ncomputer form and one version -- one copy, it's not even a\nversion, the identical thing goes to the printing facility\nand --\nQUESTION: With an identification code for this\nday's edition of the Washington Post. Is that the\nidentification code?\nMR. TRIBE: Yes absolute -- the identification\ncode --\nQUESTION: So that when you pull it up what you\nget is the whole Washington Post.\nMR. TRIBE: If you ask for the Washington Post.\nQUESTION: Ah, you have to go out of your way to\nask for -- have it recompiled.\nMR. TRIBE: I wanted to first describe what\nhappens when it gets there and then I'll try to say what\nhappens at the other end when someone --\nQUESTION: I want to know what's sent.\nMR. TRIBE: What is sent is computer data, whole\nWashington Post and it's put before it goes there they add\nadvertisements and some other graphics. And then it goes\nto the assembly room and then it's delivered and put on\nnewsstands. That edition of the ads and the graphics\nwhich are not ASCII --\nQUESTION: Forget about the ads and the\ngraphics.\nMR. TRIBE: That edition is not made in the\nversion that goes to Nexis. Nexis processes that unitary\ncomputer data. It goes instantaneously, not in driblets,\nand it doesn't go article by article.\nQUESTION: So I could look to the opinion of the\ndistrict court to find that because it might very\ntechnically turn on whether the transmission to Nexis is\nthe transmission at one instant of time of the electronic\nanalog, and I chose the Post purposely because it's not\ninvolved in some other aspects of the case, the -- it\nmight turn on whether that whole electronic analog of the\nentire paper is transmitted instantly at one instance over\nto Nexis where later on they use electronic scissors and\ncut it up or whether article by article at different times\nit's transmitted so that there is no cutting up.\nMR. TRIBE: There's not a shred of evidence, not\na whisper that suggest that they're first disassembling\nthe paper into articles and then whisking it over. It is\ntrue that the computer text registers each article and\nidentifies it just as it identifies pages and there is a\nfile for each article. But a file is really a conceptual\nthing here. It's not that they have a little file and\nthey have the article stuffed in it. And the result of\nall this is that the technology shouldn't obscure what's\nhappening. What's happening is that something that is as\nclose to the Washington Post for that day as it could be\ngiven this medium appears in the Nexis computer.\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. Tribe, despite how it is\ntransmitted, if the whole thing goes immediately, then at\nNexis is it disaggregated and stored in a way that one\nfinds as individual articles.\nMR. TRIBE: No, Justice O'Connor. What happens\nis --\nQUESTION: That's odd, because when I've used\nsomething like that I've gone to an author's name or a\nsubject matter and tried to retrieve an individual\narticle, not the whole newspaper.\nMR. TRIBE: No, of course not. Although some\npeople want the whole newspaper and you can get it by\nsaying date, paren, 3/28/2001. But let me answer your\nquestion --\nQUESTION: Well, I think it's fair to say that\nNexis at least strips out the ads, strips out the graphics\nand the photos.\nMR. TRIBE: Nexis doesn't strip out the ads.\nQUESTION: Well, somebody is doing it because\nwhat you get --\nMR. TRIBE: The ads are just not added.\nQUESTION: What you get is the article.\nMR. TRIBE: First of all, you get the whole\nthing in the GPO CD-ROM. Secondly, Nexis doesn't subtract\nthe ads, they're just not added by the Washington Post,\nalthough I'm not sure that that matters. Third --\nQUESTION: They're not added but they are in the\noriginal version.\nMR. TRIBE: That's right. That's why this is a\nrevision. We're not claiming it's the same thing but it\nis awfully close and if this isn't a revision, it's hard\nto know what would be. The point I want to make is that\nwith -- once the computer has all of the digital\ninformation, it indexes it according to key words and\namong those words are the date and an author and the data\nis sort of scattered to the magnetic --\nQUESTION: Isn't that the point, Mr. Tribe, at\nwhich there is no longer any functional difference between\nthe way Nexis stores and the Nexis subscriber calls up on\nthe one hand and simply a freestanding reprint of the\narticle which anybody can walk into a store and buy on the\nother hand.\nMR. TRIBE: There are several important\ndifferences, Justice Souter. One, the search inside Nexis\nis always of whole periodicals, and that's undisputed, two\n--\nQUESTION: I don't understand what you mean. If\nI want an article by Smith, I understand that I can search\nfor an article by Smith not for the entire New York Times\nor Washington Post in which Smith's article occurred.\nMR. TRIBE: I understand Justice Souter but it\nis undisputed that the way they do it, it's more\nefficient, is that they will take the intersection of all\nof the indices you want and they will search the entire\nperiodical by periodical to find the article. They don't\n-- it's not after all a thinking machine. It's a dumb\noperation, but more important, you're not charged for the\narticle the way you would be at a copy service. You're\ncharged for search time and that's the time for searching\nentire periodicals. Also --\nQUESTION: Okay. And if I want to get the\narticle cheap I identify the article very specifically so\nthat the search time will be less rather than more and the\nfunctional effect is that I buy the article.\nMR. TRIBE: When you get it, you get it as part\nof the revision and that's --\nQUESTION: Well, no, but I don't. If I get --\nmaybe you're telling me something in fact that I shouldn't\ndispute, but if I want Smith's article, what comes out of\nthe machine is Smith's article not the entire edition of\nthe Post.\nMR. TRIBE: I understand Justice Souter, but if\nyou'll permit me, let me say why I nonetheless think\nyou're getting it as part of the revised periodical, and\nthe reason is this, it's very important, so please let me\nstress it. If it were the case that the only way you\ncould comply with 201(c) was that when you asked for an\narticle you get, whether you want it or not, the whole\nperiodical in which the article appears, that would\nsatisfy the concern you're expressing.\nBut if that was the only way you could do it,\nthe statute would be incoherent because it says that you\nmay reproduce and distribute the contribution as part of a\nrevision or you may distribute the revision itself or a\nlater element in the series, and if it were the case that\nyou have to get the whole thing, then we would have erased\nfrom the statute the key compromised words --\nQUESTION: I will accept that but it may then\nsimply be that the price of coherence, as you put it, is a\nlimitation on the right of the periodical or of the\ncollection and a corresponding recognition of the right of\nthe author. That may be what coherence demands.\nMR. TRIBE: Well, but wouldn't that be for\nCongress, Justice Souter? That is, Congress said --\nQUESTION: If that is a necessary -- if that is\nthe only way to avoid for practical purposes reading the\nauthor's copyright protection right out of the statute\nthen I would suppose that's what Congress necessarily has\nprovided.\nMR. TRIBE: But Justice Souter, to say that it\nreads that protection out of the statute is hard to square\nwith the fact that these authors in undisputed testimony\nthemselves said that when they tried to syndicate their\nwork or serialize it or sell it in some way there was\nnever any evidence that its appearance in this archival\ncontext on Nexis or the CD-ROMs ever made the slightest\ndifference. They can fully exploit their individual work,\nthe argument is that we should be able since Congress said\nso to reproduce and distribute not just a revision of the\ncomposite work, but the article as part of that revision,\nand that cannot mean --\nQUESTION: Well, because you played -- the idea\nis you played their song beyond their permission. Tell\nme, Mr. Tribe, why if it is wrong to think of what's going\non here if you put it in very simple terms as taking the\narticle that the Post has received, to put it in the Post,\nand just putting it in a much, much larger journal? When\nyou give it to Nexis, isn't that what happens?\nMR. TRIBE: No. No, Justice Ginsberg, it's when\nyou bind the book and put it on a library shelf you could\nsay it's part of a huge book. The fact is that this is a\nhuge database and the Second Circuit's suggestion that we\nare treating that whole database as the revision is\ncompletely wrong. We've said all along that the revision\nis simply the digitized version of the periodical. That\ndigitized version is one that contains --\nQUESTION: That doesn't exist -- that does not\nexist separately, it does not exist by itself, it's part\nof this big mass of data.\nMR. TRIBE: That's the nature of the medium.\nNothing exist separately.\nQUESTION: You're inventing a revision that has\nno real world existence. You're saying there's just this\npart of the data which is scattered all through I don't\nknow how they scatter on the disk or wherever --\nMR. TRIBE: But Justice Scalia, Congress was\nwell aware -- they talked about disks, they talked about\nany medium, they talked about machines having to read the\nstuff, they knew about the computer, 1978 wasn't that long\nago. This law was written to make sense in the computer\ncontext.\nQUESTION: It would have been thoroughly\nfeasible, would it not, to send over the Washington Post\nwith identification that would only refer to this edition\nof the Washington Post.\nMR. TRIBE: But the statute allows --\nQUESTION: In which case you would have no\nproblem in the world, you have sent over the Washington\nPost.\nMR. TRIBE: No. The problem in the world we'd\nhave, Justice Scalia, is the world doesn't want only --\nand Congress --\nQUESTION: That may well be so pay for it then.\nThat just proves that it's better to do it the way you're\ndoing it, commercially better, but that doesn't prove you\nshould have to pay for it.\nMR. TRIBE: I think we're paying for the\nexisting royalty and secondly, Congress said that we could\npublish as part of that compromise that we could publish\nthe individual article as part of the revision. I'm\nsaying that carries this implication and it doesn't\ndestroy their copyright.\nQUESTION: Suppose you had an old fogy editor\nwho didn't want to use any of new-fangled stuff so what he\ndoes is he cuts out each article in a magazine, each\nseparate article and he sends it over to some separate\nlibrary, he sends over the whole thing but it's sent over\narticle by article and it is and knowingly to be -- to be\nindexed in that library that he's sending it to by the\narticle, rather than by the Washington Post of the day,\nwould you say that somehow this is just a revision?\nMR. TRIBE: Probably not. Probably not, because\nI think --\nQUESTION: I don't see why this is any\ndifference in substance.\nMR. TRIBE: It differs in a lot of ways. We are\nsending over the entire periodical and people can find --\nQUESTION: My case, too. The whole thing's sent\nover, but it's sent over article by article and it is\nindexed by the article, in a whole mass of articles from\nevery magazine in the country, now would that be okay if\nit was done in print? I don't see why --\nMR. TRIBE: Would they be charged for the\narticles or charged for the time it takes to search the\nwhole library.\nQUESTION: Oh, you think that's the difference?\nMR. TRIBE: I think it makes an important\ndifference. These things are also -- if you look at the\npromotional materials they're promoted as complete\nperiodicals, hundreds of volumes of the most widely-read\nperiodicals. I think I should reserve the balance of --\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Tribe.\nMr. Gold, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE GOLD\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS\nMR. GOLD: Mr. Chief Justice and may it please\nthe Court:\nI'd like to begin by addressing the part of the\ndiscussion that just concluded, Section 201(c) and its\ncognate Sections 103 and the definition sections as has\nbeen discussed distinguished between the author's\ncopyright in his individual contributed work, which he\nretains when he contributes it to a collective work, and\nthe collective work copyright owners, this language\ncouldn't be more cumbersome, mainly the publishers'\ncopyright in the collective work as a whole. The statute\ncouldn't be clearer, we believe, in the proposition that\nthe collective works copyright owner has no copyright in\nthe individual article in these free-lance situations\nwhere there is the separate author copyright.\nIt seems to us that the clearest lesson from\nthat is that if the publisher were in print terms to\npublish reprints of individual articles and treat them\nseparately that would be an infringing action, the\npublisher would be exploiting the article as an article\nand without any authorization.\nQUESTION: Suppose that the Times published\nbound volumes of its paper but it had an index in the\nfront of it, maybe it does, with all of the authors names\nand all of the subjects names and the other thing it did\nwas it had tabs so that you could easily find the index.\nI take it that would be a permitted revision just because\nit's in paper.\nMR. GOLD: Well, if in paper terms, the Times\nwere to publish a version of what they electronically\nprovide to Nexis, article by article, by the way in file\n-- each article in a file. But if they were to publish\nthat as a coherent whole, the reader's condensed May 1st\nNew York Times, I think there's a very strong argument\nthat that's a revised version of the paper.\nQUESTION: Well, at some point it changes so\nmuch that it's not --\nQUESTION: What you're saying --\nQUESTION: Electronically that's all this is, is\nit not?\nMR. GOLD: I'm saying that is a fair argument\nbut we're miles away from that fair argument.\nQUESTION: No, but take Justice Kennedy's\nprecise example, it's not just the indexed New York times\nof this date but the Times publishes a massive volumes,\nall of the New York Times from 1950 to 1990 with an index\nin it, would you consider that just a revision of the one\nedition of the New York Times for which the Times had the\ncopyright.\nMR. GOLD: I do not think that's --\nQUESTION: I wouldn't think that either.\nMR. GOLD: -- a revision.\nQUESTION: It also could be a later collective\nwork in the same series.\nMR. GOLD: The question here, though, at least\nthere is an argument that that's a revision and not an\nexploitation of the copyrighted author's article as an\narticle, but my point, my beginning point is that as I\nunderstand Mr. Tribe's argument, if the Times were to\npublish an article as an article, saying this was part of\nthe New York Times and offer it on the market, make copies\nand offer it to anyone who wants to buy it, that that\nwould be part of the publisher's 201(c) right.\nAt that point there's nothing, on that theory,\nthere is nothing left of the fact that the author is the\ncopyright holder in the article. We thought that was the\nstarting point, that the one thing that is plain is that\nthe collective work copyright holder cannot exploit the\narticle as an article, as a separate freestanding work.\nAnd in the end what the Nexis system does is exploit\narticles on an article by article basis. They're drawn\nfrom hundreds of collective works.\nQUESTION: Mr. Gold, it would help me if you\nwould identify for me precisely when the infringement\noccurs. Let me just take the very first step. Supposing\nthe New York Times sends an E-mail to Nexis and attaches\nan exhibit and on that exhibit is an entire copy of all\nthe stories in the paper that day. Is that an\ninfringement?\nMR. GOLD: I don't think that if you take a\nparticular view of what the revised work is at that stage\nwhether there is an infringement seems to me questionable,\nbut --\nQUESTION: And the reason it would not be an\ninfringement is because translating it from the paper\nmedia to the electronic media would be a revision? Is\nthat correct? Just as though you put it in Braille, that\nwould be a revision.\nMR. GOLD: As long as a collective work, but\nwhat is done here --\nQUESTION: So that step isn't an infringement.\nNow when does the infringement occur and by whom?\nMR. GOLD: The -- it seems to us there are a\nseries of infringements, the first is --\nQUESTION: Let's take the first one and by whom.\nMR. GOLD: The first is that the articles are\ncoded, the article files are coded and then inserted into\nan overall database of millions and from the latest\nnumbers, billions --\nQUESTION: And then you're going to have to tell\nme, why is that different from putting a photostat or a\nmicrofiche of a New York Times in a particular place in a\nbig library?\nMR. GOLD: Because you're not putting a\nmicrofiche of the New York Times as a New York Times what\nyou're --\nQUESTION: No, but you're putting a revision in.\nMR. GOLD: No.\nQUESTION: What you just said was a revision.\nMR. GOLD: No, you're putting articles that were\npart of the revision into an undifferentiated mess and in\nthat sense you're creating a quite different work. Those\narticles --\nQUESTION: I thought your complaint alleges\ncontributory infringement by the New York Times the minute\nit sends it to me, data central. I thought that was the\nallegation in your complaint, that that's a contributory\ninfringement because the New York Times knows what they're\ngoing to do with it, they're going to disaggregate it and\nhave it available. Is that the allegation or not?\nMR. GOLD: That's the allegation.\nQUESTION: That's how I read it.\nMR. GOLD: But my point was that it by putting\n-- they're not sending an integrated New York Times to\nNexis, they're sending disaggregated articles which will\nbe further disaggregated.\nQUESTION: But that -- even if they --\nQUESTION: The other side disputes that. Mr.\nTribe says that's not it. We send exactly what we had,\nbut be that as it may. Is it not your allegation in the\ncomplaint that whatever the New York Times sends is a\ncontributor infringement?\nMR. GOLD: Yes.\nQUESTION: Okay, now if that is so, why should\nit make a difference whether the Times sends it in an\narguably aggregated form or an arguably disaggregated\nform, isn't the real point from your -- from the\nstandpoint of your case that the newspaper is\nparticipating in a process the end point of which is\ndisaggregation and access to disaggregated materials.\nMR. GOLD: Yes.\nQUESTION: And if that's the case then why isn't\nit on your theory an infringement, no matter what the\nformat in which the Times or any newspaper sends the\nmaterial to Nexis?\nMR. GOLD: My only point in making -- in stating\nthat the form of the transmission, namely in article\nfiles, is that is part and parcel of what you've just\nstated, namely an overall process, to create a set of\ndisaggregated article files.\nQUESTION: Then I should think your answer to\nJustice Stevens' question would be the infringement on the\npart of the newspaper takes place at the moment of\ntransmission.\nMR. GOLD: I think that in those terms that's\ntrue and I thought I did answer it that way in the -- in\nthe sense that it is the nature of the -- the nature of\nthe disaggregation and assigning each article to an\narticle file which is part and parcel of this overall --\nQUESTION: I'm still not clear of your answer of\nJustice Stevens' question, when does the first\ninfringement take place? It sounds as if you're saying\nthe infringement takes place when the Times pushes the\nbutton to remove all the ads and the graphics or when the\nTimes pushes the button to enable a searcher to pull up\nthe article by author and that seems very strange to me.\nWhen is the first act of infringement? Forget about\ncontribution to the tort, when is the first infringing\nact?\nMR. GOLD: When you say forget about\ncontributing to, I'm just not clear on what you're asking.\nThe --\nQUESTION: There's a tortfeasor and persons who\ncontribute to the tort. When is the tort first committed?\nThe tort of infringement.\nMR. GOLD: This is, I guess, as I see it an act\nthat is the first step in a continuing process of\ninfringement. The Times --\nQUESTION: When can I say, ah-ha, there's an\ninfringement.\nMR. GOLD: It seems to me that in practical\nterms the first act of infringement of any substance is\nthe putting of the article files as separate article files\non the Nexis database and making it available in this\nsystem to be accessed, printed out, downloaded and so --\nQUESTION: I understand that, but why, since the\nnewspaper knows that that is what is supposed to happen,\nthat in fact is what it called for in its contract with\nNexis, why doesn't the newspaper infringe at the moment\nwhen it takes the first step in that process, which I\nsuppose would be the moment at which it presses the send\nbutton to send the material to Nexis?\nMR. GOLD: I don't think I've ever before been\nfaced with an embarrassment of riches where I'm being\nasked to say how many multiple --\nQUESTION: I'm not going to ask that, I'm asking\nthe opposite. That is, what is the process, and the\nreason I find it important is it seems to me possible from\nwhat your opponents have said that what happens at say the\nPost or the Times is there is the analog electronically of\nthe front page. It doesn't have the pictures, it doesn't\nhave the graphs. I don't care about that for the moment.\nAssume you lose on that one. I have the electronic analog\nwhich is close enough. And then what happens is somebody\npushes the send button and at one instance of time that\nelectronically is transmitted to Nexis where it's on a\nchip. Now all that happens after that, where we have the\nelectronic analog on a chip, is some electronic signals\nare added by Nexis to parts of the chip so that any user\nof Nexis who wants to can call it up like any other thing,\narticle by article. Now I want to know is, is that what\nhappens?\nMR. GOLD: My understanding of what happens is\nthat the Post creates a set of article files, each of\nwhich are an electronic --\nQUESTION: Creating an article file maybe that\non a chip there's the electronic analog or on a disk and\nyou add a few other signals.\nMR. GOLD: Well --\nQUESTION: Now the reason I'm asking this and\nthe reason I think it's important is because it seems to\nme it might make an enormous difference if the only\ninfringing act is when a user comes in and calls up a\nfile, because at that point principles of fair use come\ninto play, and I think principles of fair use might make\nan enormous difference to the end result and the reason to\nget my whole question out because I might not have another\nopportunity is I am disturbed very much by what I call, by\nway of parody, their Chinese Cultural Revolution argument.\nThat is, we wipe out the history of the 20th Century and\nthat's an overstatement but it's not such an overstatement\nwhen you think that most school children today will be\nlooking for information on machines and if it isn't in the\ndatabase library D.H. Lawrence, John P. Marguand or lesser\nfigures will simply disappear because it's two expensive\nfor them to locate each heir and to get the copyright\npermission to put the article on the machine. All right,\nI've got it all out now I'd like your response.\nMR. GOLD: Do I get one sentence or two?\nQUESTION: I'd like you to take as long as you'd\nlike and I won't interrupt further.\nMR. GOLD: First of all the -- it is enormously\ndifferent, I would suggest, to breakdown and disaggregate\na collective and into component parts when the component\nparts are the copyright property of someone else and to\ntake the first and necessary step for those component\nparts to be exploited as individual freestanding works and\nwith the purpose of -- providing that they will be\nexploited as freestanding works.\nThe -- every step from the first step taken by\nthe newspapers and breaking this down into article files\ncoding it, providing those article files to Nexis where\nthey are further coded and inputted, not necessarily in\nsequence, is to create a system in which the article files\ncan be exploited as individual files, as individual\narticles. This process is the print equivalent process of\nprinting each article as an individual article which can\nbe combined with any other of a billion articles in a knew\ncompilation which has nothing to do with the original\ncollective work or any revised collective work or\npublished by itself, printed and published.\nQUESTION: Mr. Gold, if you've had a chance to\nfinish your answer, why is that different from sending a\nnewspaper to a library with very detailed indexes, knowing\nthat the library will allow people to come in and make\nindividual copies of individual stories, individual\ncontributions to it.\nMR. GOLD: Well if the library --\nQUESTION: Has a very elaborate index system and\nit's part of a huge library.\nMR. GOLD: Yeah. Justice Stevens, all I can say\nis if the library is part and parcel of copying individual\narticles, that's a copyright infringement.\nQUESTION: All it does is provide the\ninformation that enables the person to pick and choose\nwhat he wants.\nMR. GOLD: Well, there are two different\nquestions that it seems to me you're raising. If the\nlibrary simply gives someone an index and a copy of the\npaper and says --\nQUESTION: And has a xerox machine where the guy\ncan go in and get the particular one he wants.\nMR. GOLD: The question is whether the library\nis implicated in providing the duplicating system. The\nlaw could not be clearer on that. There are elaborate\nprovisions in the Copyright Act with regard to library\npermitted or created copying for a price and don't forget\nthis is all commercialized. Nexis is not a free service.\nIt is a publishing service creating new copies of these\nworks for --\nQUESTION: So just to be sure I understand, the\ninfringement occurs, I still want to know just when it\nfirst -- the infringement occurs when the individual makes\na selection and then makes a copy of his particular\nchoice.\nMR. GOLD: You mean in the library example you\nare raising?\nQUESTION: Is it not the same in the electronic\nsituation? There's no infringement and some individual\npicks out a particular article that was both part of a\nrevision and part of original copyright by the author and\nmakes a copy of that without making a copy of the whole\nrevision.\nMR. GOLD: Two things if I can, the copying of\nthe work onto the disk is one kind -- if we're correct, is\none kind of copyright infringement.\nQUESTION: I thought you said earlier that if\nthe whole E-mail was copied in electronic form that would\nbe a revision, not an infringement. Are you changing your\nview on the --\nMR. GOLD: No, I'm sorry, I don't understand\nwhat you're asking. If the -- we're discussing your\nnewspaper --\nQUESTION: Correct.\nMR. GOLD: -- library example. The only\ninfringement is if the library is actively engaged in\nfacilitating, allowing further --\nQUESTION: Selling individual articles, yeah,\nright.\nMR. GOLD: Duplications for a price. In this\ncase, there are multiple infringements before that because\n--\nQUESTION: What's the first one before that.\nMR. GOLD: The first one is the preparation of\nthe article files as separate article files for the\npurpose of creating an overall compilation of separate\narticle files which are to be exploited as separate\narticle files.\nQUESTION: Is that analytically different from\ncreating elaborate indices in a print library.\nMR. GOLD: Yes, because it is part and parcel of\na process for printing, if you will, for reproducing and\ndistributing separate article files, separate articles as\nsuch. If the news -- to go back to --\nQUESTION: Well, its equivalent in the print\nmedia, I guess, would be sending over a package of\nseparate articles which in combination were the Washington\nPost of that day, but they're sent over as separate\narticles and each one indexed in such a way as to\nfacilitate the obtaining of those articles without\nobtaining the rest of the Washington Post.\nMR. GOLD: Right, for a price, for sale. That is\nprecisely what I --\nQUESTION: That's what my understanding of the\nrecord is, they sell it -- send it over as a bundle. They\ndon't send it over in separate pieces.\nQUESTION: That's what I wanted to know.\nMR. GOLD: They send over a bundle of separate\npieces.\nQUESTION: Well, all right, but suppose it's the\nexact electronic analog of the morning paper. I mean, if\nit's the exact electronic analog of the morning paper that\nthey send over, I know it's technical but this is a pretty\ntechnical case and then it seems to me that it is not just\nsending separate articles. If they send one at ten in the\nmorning and another at four in the afternoon it might be\nquite different.\nMR. GOLD: Justice Breyer, if to use Justice\nScalia's example, you send to the print shop every\nseparate article that appeared in the newspaper and said\nprint each one up as a separate article to be purveyed to\nthe public, given the structure of this act, that is\ndifferent from saying here is a collective whole, because\n--\nQUESTION: You have to establish that they are\nsent over as separate articles. What constitutes the\nsending over of them as separate articles? I thought it\nwas the fact that when they're sent over they are coded\nand identified --\nMR. GOLD: Right.\nQUESTION: -- separately, not as simply one\nunidentifiable part of the Washington Post of May 2nd.\nMR. GOLD: Correct.\nQUESTION: Each one has a code on it which\nenables it to be treated as a separate article.\nMR. GOLD: Right, and the only togetherness, if\nyou will, is that it's our understanding, and it is my\nunderstanding of the record that after the paper is broken\ndown and these article files are created and coded, they\nare transmitted or streamed as a set of distinguishable\narticle files but they are not a unit, an electronic unit\nof the May 1st paper, they are a separate --\nQUESTION: That would be quite useless for the\npurposes for which they want it. They don't want the\nWashington Post of May 2nd. They want the ability to get\nindividual articles.\nMR. GOLD: Correct. This is a purpose of\ncommercial activity.\nQUESTION: Mr. Gold, before you finish I would\nlike you to respond to Mr. Tribe's point that on your\ntheory the microfiche, it would be the same thing, equally\ninfringing.\nMR. GOLD: We don't believe that the microfiche\nis equally infringing?\nQUESTION: Why not.\nMR. GOLD: Because it is a reproduction of the\nwhole paper in integral form. Now, if to the extent that\nthe paper is shown rather than read, you have the whole\npaper, you can read what you want, but it's a one to one\nrelationship between the number of copies that are made\nand the number that are --\nQUESTION: Isn't that a problem that with\ncomputers we can -- you can simultaneously be a bundle and\na whole bunch of separate things, depends on which button\nwe decide to push whether you want the whole thing or just\none.\nMR. GOLD: Well, that's why the fact that it is\n-- that the system is one of articles which can be\nexploited as articles or in any combination of articles\nmakes all the difference. It is not a set in any real\nterms of the work.\nQUESTION: Thank you Mr. Gold.\nMr. Tribe you have two minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE H. TRIBE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. TRIBE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Let me\nfirst say very clearly it is not the case that these\nnewspapers disaggregate something and break it down to\nfacilitate copyright violation. It is disaggregated from\nthe word go, that is, when they put together the computer\ntext file that's going to go to the printer they do it\narticle by article because as it happens, that's what goes\ninto a newspaper. That exact text, and you'll see it\nunmistakably in the record, is exactly what is sent.\nQUESTION: No additional code on it?\nMR. TRIBE: Well, sometimes indexing codes, but\nnot only for articles. You've got to be able to find this\nstuff. You can't just wander around inside a computer.\nAnd it is the readers guide to periodicals. That's what\nwe've got here. Whether it is in written form or in index\nform, it's the same thing.\nSo point one, they don't deliberately\ndisaggregate. Point two, if you look at 349 A of the\njoint appendix, that's one of many places, I just happened\nto find this one, where they say they're not claiming any\ncontributory or vicarious liability with respect to\ninfringements by end users.\nTheir whole theory was putting this stuff in the\nway that the 20th and 21st centuries has to do it is an\ninfringement. It's really a quite Luddite theory. Their\ndistinction with microfilm is that microfilm is a piece of\nsomething, you can see it. Well, what about the CD-ROM,\nthen? You can't see it except with a machine. It just\nlooks like it might be Joan Baez singing, but it turns out\nit's got volume upon volume of material.\nThere's nothing fancy that's done here to\nfacilitate violation. What they're doing is making entire\nbunch of material available and I didn't hear an answer to\nJustice Breyer's question. If we read the law the way\nthey propose to read it and I still don't know the exact\nmoment they think is an infringement and how analytically\nit differs from Justice Stevens' library example, we're\ngoing to have a serious problem with our kids doing\nhomework and with professors of history finding out what\nhappened in the middle of the 20th century. It seems to\nme that before this Court takes a step like that it should\npause.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Tribe.\n"
