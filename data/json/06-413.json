        "content": "(1:00 p.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument next\nin 06-413, Uttecht versus Brown.\nMr. Samson.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN L. SAMSON,\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. SAMSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court.\nThe Ninth Circuit's conclusion that\nMr. Brown is entitled to habeas corpus relief should be\nreversed for three reasons. First, under Section\n2254(3)(16) of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act the trial judge's dismissal of Mr. Deal from\nthe jury is a finding of fact of substantial impairment\nthat is presumed correct unless it is rebutted by clear\nand convincing evidence. Mr. Brown has not presented\nsuch evidence because the record before the State court\nsupports the decision to remove Mr. Deal, especially\nsince the trial judge had the opportunity to observe\nMr. Deal and the defense had no objection to his\nremoval.\nSecond, under 2254(d)(2) the State court\ndecision was based on a reasonable determination of the\nfacts. Since the finding of fact was correct it is\nnecessarily reasonable.\nAnd third, under 2254(d)(2), the State court\ndecision was not contrary to Supreme Court precedent.\nSince the trial court applied the correct standard under\nWitt and found as fact that Mr. Deal was substantially\nimpaired and this case is immaterially indistinguishable\nfrom Witt, the State court's decision was a reasonable\napplication of clearly established Federal law.\nMr. Deal did indicate in the voir dire that\nhe could impose the death penalty and consider it, but\nhis other statements created an ambiguity which the\ntrial judge was in the best position to resolve.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Counsel, may I ask you one\nthing, which I have assumed, and I think it is correct,\nbut I'd like to be sure of it. Is it the case, is it\ncorrect, that prior to the voir dire questions, no one\nhad given a statement to the venire people of what the\nlaw was with respect to the imposition of the death\npenalty; is that correct?\nMR. SAMSON: Not exactly, Your Honor. Prior\nto the individual voir dire, they were -- there was\ninstructions given to the jurors. Prior to the filling\nout of the questionnaire.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Were they told what the --\nI forget how many factors are enumerated under the\nWashington law? Were they told what they were?\nMR. SAMSON: No, Your Honor, it was more a\ngeneral instruction regarding how the system operates.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. SAMSON: In the individual voir dire of\nMr. Deal --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But one piece of\nevidence that -- one piece of information that wasn't\ngiven apparently to those jurors, they didn't know about\nit, was that life meant life without parole. Because\nwhen he was questioned, he was surprised, he didn't know\nthat that was the law.\nMR. SAMSON: Your Honor, he learned an hour\nbefore his questioning that that was the law. He was\nnot informed of that -- of tht law when he filled out\nhis questionnaire. But approximately an hour before the\nindividual questioning, he was informed of that, and he\nindicated that in his questioning that he had just\nlearned an hour ago.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And how did he learn\nthat?\nMR. SAMSON: He learned that from the\ninstructions given by the trial judge as well as through\nthe statements by defense counsel and by the prosecutor.\nAnd the defense counsel reminded Mr. Deal of\nthe fact that there was life without parole. She asked\nhim if he can consider both options, death and life\nwithout parole. He said he could. And then defense\ncounsel asked why do you think the death penalty is\nappropriate? And he stated again, as he stated in his\nquestionnaire, it would be a case where the person was\nincorrigible and would reviolate if rereleased.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: He gave that as an\nexample. He didn't say and that's the only circumstance\nin which I be willing to vote for the death penalty.\nMR. SAMSON: That is correct, Your Honor,\nbut the prosecutor in viewing Mr. Deal's responses\nthrough the course of the voir dire, the prosecutor\nviewed Mr. Deal as saying the only time, or I would have\ngreat difficulty in imposing the death penalty, unless\nthe person would be released and would be in a position\nto -- to reoffend or kill again.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did he say, \"for example,\"\nwith regard to the quotation that Justice Ginsburg\nmentioned? I didn't recall that he said for example.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: He was asked to give an\nexample. He didn't say for example. But he didn't say\nthis would be the only situation in which I would vote\nfor the death penalty.\nMR. SAMSON: That is, that is correct. Both\n-- both are correct, Your Honors. At Joint Appendix 62,\nhe was asked for an example of why he believed the death\npenalty was appropriate, and he says, \"I think if a\nperson is or would be incorrigible and would reviolate\nif released, then it would be appropriate.\"\nAnd, in fact, the only two examples he ever\ngave of when he believed it would be appropriate is when\na defendant wants to die or a defendant would be\nreleased on parole and could kill again. And the\nprosecutor specifically asked Mr. Deal, can you think of\nan example, or a situation of when you would be able to\nimpose a death penalty now knowing there is life without\nparole, and Mr. Deal at Joint Appendix 71 to 72 said I\nwould have to give that some thought. Like I said up\nuntil an hour ago I did not realize that life without\nparole was --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you agree that if we\ngrant your position and grant you relief, that it would\nbe something of an extension over Witt and Darden, in\nthat the jurors in Witt and Darden had fixed views, that\nthey were as a matter of conscience opposed to the\npenalty?\nMR. SAMSON: Your Honor, I would agree that\nthe statements given by the jurors in Witt and Darden\nwere not exactly what Mr. Deal said. But I think the\ngeneral rule that the deference given to the trial judge\nwould be the same rule. And we are only asking this\ncourt to apply the rule.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I understand that. But I\ndo think that the views of this juror, Deal, were\nsomewhat more equivocal than in the cases I've\nmentioned.\nMR. SAMSON: They were, Your Honor. There\nwas not a statement as in Witt and Darden where the\njurors said that they had an opposition to the death\npenalty and would have difficulty applying it. That is\ncorrect. The statements were -- were different.\nAnd certainly if the judge viewing a juror\nof this type determined that the juror was not impaired,\nthen that decision would also be entitled to deference.\nIn fact, an example occurred in this case, Juror Obeso,\nthe judge -- there was a challenge by the prosecutor.\nThere was actually an objection by the defense. And the\njudge said Mr. Obeso says that he can follow the law and\nimpose the death penalty and I think he can.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One thing I couldn't\nclearly discern from your brief is the significance you\nattached to the defendant's, defense failure to object.\nHow does that enter into our analysis?\nMR. SAMSON: Your Honor, there's two points\nmade from the failure to object. The first is it\nexplains why there's no evidence, expressed evidence\nregarding demeanor or credibility or even an express\nstatement regarding demeanor or credibility or even an\nexpress statement as to substantial impairment.\nThe second is that as the Court stated in\nWitt, it is a significant factor the court may consider\nin its evidence that show the judge acted appropriately.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me on that\npoint that the State is somewhat surprised and\nwhipsawed. And I understand that the Washington court\nreached the issue. It is not independent State ground.\nI take it the prosecutor had some peremptories left?\nMR. SAMSON: Yes, Your Honor. The\nprosecutor had two.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: How late in the process\nwas -- was Deal considered? Was he one of the early\njurors or one of the late jurors?\nMR. SAMSON: He was one of the -- the early\njurors. He was on November 3, which was about five to\nsix days into the individual voir dire on the death\nqualification.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: This was about a 17 day\nvoir dire?\nMR. SAMSON: That is correct, Your Honor.\nAnd --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that cuts a little\nbit against the peremptory. I mean, if it was early in\nthe game the prosecutor might not have exercised the\nperemptory.\nMR. SAMSON: Well the peremptories were not\nexercised until the death qualification and the other\nfor-cause checks are were done.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, I see. So the whole\njury is -- I see.\nMR. SAMSON: Yes, Your Honor. So they, they\ncompleted all the death qualification. And then those\njurors that that remained they had further individual\nvoir dire, and the defense and the prosecutor then used\ntheir peremptories interchangeably to remove jurors.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I go back to the\nChief's question about the failure to object? I think I\ngot the impression from Judge Kozinski's opinion that he\nthought that the Washington Supreme Court found that\nwith respect to two out of the three jurors at issue\nthat there had been a finding that they were\nsubstantially impaired, but with respect to this juror,\nthat the Washington Supreme Court seemed to rely on the\nfailure to object as the principal explanation for their\ndecision.\nMR. SAMSON: I would -- I would disagree\nwith that, Your Honor.\nThe -- the State Supreme Court on page 171a\nof the Petitioner's appendix specifically was citing to\nWitt and the rules from Witt. And that includes the\nrule that the trial judge's exclusion of a juror\nconstitutes a finding of fact.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought\nJustice Stevens's articulation of Judge Kozinski's\nopinion was exactly right but I thought you would in\nresponse cite us to page 208a where the Washington\nSupreme Court said that those jurors' views, including\nMr. Deal, would have prevented or substantially impaired\ntheir ability to follow the court's instructions and\nabide by their oaths as jurors.\nIt seems the court of appeals judge\noverlooked that.\nMR. SAMSON: They did, Your Honor. They\ndid. And that is a specific finding of fact by the\nState Supreme Court.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it a finding? It's\nlisted under \"Summary and conclusions.\" Under\n\"Findings,\" I thought under \"Findings\" the -- the\nfindings were that he misunderstood the standard. He\nsaid beyond a shadow of a doubt, rather than beyond a\nreasonable doubt. And what other finding of fact was\nthere? Because this one is listed under conclusions.\n\"From the facts, I conclude that he would be impaired.\"\nBut the impairment is the conclusion from what facts?\nMR. SAMSON: It is from all the facts that\nthe State Supreme Court had before it. It's\none-paragraph analysis of Mr. Deal did not lay out all\nthe facts that were before the court. And the statement\n208-A, although it's listed as a conclusion, essentially\nconstitute a finding of fact. And even if this Court\nwere to say that is not a finding of fact, it contains\nwith it the implicit finding of fact.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, aren't we obliged\nunder AEDPA to give deference to any reasonable\nconclusion from the facts?\nMR. SAMSON: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So even if it is just a\nconclusion, AEDPA still applies to it unless it's a\ntotally unreasonable conclusion, right?\nMR. SAMSON: That's exactly right, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the point stands that\nthe court of appeals was just incorrect in, in, in not\nnoting what's there too late. It's just not a fair\nsummary of what the Washington Supreme Court did.\nMR. SAMSON: Yes, Your Honor. The Ninth\nCircuit found that the State courts made no Finding of\nfact and, as Mr. Brown has essentially admitted in his\nresponse brief, there are two State court findings of\nfact, one by the Washington Supreme Court and one by the\ntrial judge.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is this something\nparticular under Washington procedure, this summary and\nconclusions section at the end of the opinion?\nMR. SAMSON: No, Your Honor. I think this\nis more just the style of the justice who wrote the\nopinion and how he writes his opinions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I take it your position is\nthat if the State courts had made or had expressed no\nconclusion other than the final conclusion that he is\nimpaired, that that conclusion itself would be entitled\nto AEDPA deference if the record could be read to\nsupport it; is that correct?\nMR. SAMSON: Yes, Your Honor. Yes, Your\nHonor. The AEDPA --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If that's the case, then\nAEDPA deference is more than deference, isn't it? AEDPA\ndeference has reached on your view the conclusion that\nif there is any factual support in a record, the\nultimate conclusion of the court will be upheld, whereas\nI thought AEDPA deference went to factfinding and to\nexpress conclusions that the court drew.\nMR. SAMSON: Your Honor, we're not saying\nthat there will never be a case where the deference\ngiven to a trial judge and the deference given to a\nState court in factual determinations can be overcome.\nCertainly, it's hard to think of one, but there can be a\ncase where that deference could be overcome.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't this perhaps just\nsuch a case? Because this finding by the Supreme Court\nof the State is based only on the written record, so it\ndoes not get any benefit of observing the demeanor of\nthe witness -- I mean, the demeanor of the prospective\njuror; isn't that correct.\nMR. SAMSON: It is correct the State Supreme\nCourt --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So if we disagreed and\nthought there was not evidence in the written record\nthat would support that conclusion, we should not give\ndeference to that appellate court finding.\nMR. SAMSON: Your Honor, but the appellate\ncourt finding also was based on the trial court finding\nof fact, and the State Supreme Court recognized, as this\nCourt did in Witt, that deference must be given to the\ntrial judge, who did have the opportunity to observe the\njuror.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the trial judge made no\nconclusion about demeanor. He didn't say anything about\ndemeanor, did he?\nMR. SAMSON: No, Your Honor, and neither did\nthe --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If we're going to get --\nthat takes -- it seems to me it takes deference yet one\nfurther step. We're saying that even if there is\nnothing on the record about demeanor, we are supposed to\nassume that a trial judge drew a conclusion based on\ndemeanor. I mean, that is not deference. I mean,\nthat's simply imputing fiction.\nMR. SAMSON: Your Honor, there's no evidence\non demeanor because the defense counsel did not object.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why is it the defense\ncounsel's obligation to object? It seems to me that if\nthe State is objecting, saying I want this juror\nremoved, and the trial judge is saying, okay, I will\nremove him, that there is an obligation to make a\nrecord.\nMR. SAMSON: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Wouldn't there be? I guess\nmy point is if there isn't, then in effect you are\nmaking the defendant responsible for creating a record\nto support what the other side asks for.\nMR. SAMSON: Your Honor, as this Court\nexplained in Witt, when there is no objection or no\ndispute as to the factual issue in the trial court, the\njudge has to reason to elaborate on his finding and\ntherefore he has no obligation to do so.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that means that the,\nthat the argument for sustaining the trial judge's\naction on the ground that the trial judge could observe\ndemeanor in effect is the elimination of judicial review\non that subject, because we know that if the venire\nperson was present in the courtroom and the judge was\npresent in the courtroom, the judge probably looked at\nhim, and if that is enough to sustain judicial action on\nthe grounds that we defer to demeanor then there's no\njudicial review at all. I think that's what Judge\nKozinski said.\nMR. SAMSON: Your Honor, if there is\nabsolutely no evidence to support the trial judge's\nconclusion in the record --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm talking about demeanor.\nI'm talking about demeanor. And there's nothing as I\nunderstand it on the record about demeanor.\nMR. SAMSON: Yes, Your Honor. In Marshall\nversus Lonberger the Court said there is no requirement\nfor explicit finding as to credibility.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And if there is no\nrequirement that there be anything on the record about\ndemeanor, then there is no judicial review on that point\nat all, is there?\nMR. SAMSON: Not on demeanor, but there can\nbe judicial review on the other facts that are presented\nin the record.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course there is on\ndemeanor. I mean, I suppose, to begin with, is it not\nthe case that the burden is on the habeas applicant to\nshow that demeanor did not make the difference? It's\nthe burden on him to show that it was an unreasonable\ndetermination.\nMR. SAMSON: It is the burden on him to\npresent clear and convincing evidence.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And the question --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And secondly, he could\npresent such evidence if he showed that there was\nabsolutely no ambiguity in what the person's statements\nsaid, so that demeanor could not have made a difference.\nBut in a case where the statements are seemingly\ncontradictory or arguably contradictory, demeanor is\nvery relevant and it's the burden, it seems to me, of\nthe Petitioner to show that demeanor wasn't what made\nthe difference.\nAnd besides which, wasn't there some part of\nthe record that you referred to where he said \"and I\nbelieve him\"?\nMR. SAMSON: Yes, Your Honor. That's as to\na different juror when there was an objection, and\nbecause there was no objection there was no obligation.\nIf I may --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is there any way that he\ncan show that demeanor didn't make a difference when the\nrecord is absolutely silent on demeanor? Is there any\nway he can show that?\nMR. SAMSON: Your Honor, he could attempt to\nbring evidence in a State court collateral -- he\nactually filed a motion for reconsideration as to\nanother juror. He did not do that in this case.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask to be sure I\nunderstand the record, because I did miss something\nbefore. Did the trial judge say in so many words that\nDeal's views would have prevented or substantially\nimpaired his ability to follow the court's instructions\nand abide by the rules of the jurors?\nMR. SAMSON: The trial judge made no such\nexpress finding because there was no objection raised.\nAnd if I may reserve --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So that's the point of the\nabsence of objection. That's why he didn't make the\ncritical finding.\nMR. SAMSON: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Because the judge didn't\nmake the critical finding.\nMR. SAMSON: He would have made a finding if\nthere was an objection.\nIf I may reserve --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You may reserve the\nremainder of your time for rebuttal.\nMR. SAMSON: Thank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Dreeben.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. DREEBEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Please finish up the\nthought because you're equally well prepared. How do we\nknow the trial judge would have made that a finding if\nthere had been an objection?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Stevens, this is a\nrecord in which the trial judge showed that he was\nmeticulously careful in applying the standard from\nWainwright versus Witt. In the joint appendix, I\nbelieve at pages 7 through 9, there's an extensive\ndiscussion of how the judge is going to apply the Witt\nstandard evenhandedly. He's going to eliminate those\njurors who are like-biased. He's going to eliminate\nthose jurors who --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Does that respond to the\npossible suggestion that Judge Kozinski made that what\nhe really did was act on the basis of no objection,\nrather than on the basis of a finding that he failed to\nmake?\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't think so,\nJustice Stevens, because it's very clear that he told\nthe parties, if you have any question, if you have any\nproblem with any of the objections that are made, speak\nup and I will intervene and question the juror myself\nand clarify it.\nAnd this is a judge who, against the\nbackground of the entire voir dire, clearly was making a\ngood faith effort to apply the Witt standard. There\nwere 12 objections by the prosecution to various jurors\nthat they should be excused for cause because of\ninability to apply the law as Washington gives it. The\ndefense objected, I believe, to seven of those; and the\nprosecution lost on five of those occasions.\nSo the judge basically went with the defense\nwhen the defense spoke up and objected. There were two\njurors that were excused over the defense objection.\nThe transcript is also in the voir dire on those and it\nshows that the defense objected and said these jurors\ncan apply the standard under the law, and the judge\nfound that they could not and excused them.\nIn the case of Juror Deal there is no\nabsolutely reason to believe that the judge wouldn't\nhave done exactly the same thing if the defense had\nobjected.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what is -- I know,\nJustice Breyer; just on this point. The defense\nactually volunteered \"no objection.\"\nMR. DREEBEN: Said \"We have no objection.\"\nAnd I think that this is one of the three significant\nlegal errors that the Ninth Circuit made in disposing of\nthis challenge. This Court made clear in Wainwright\nversus Witt that the absence of a defense objection is\nvery critical in assessing whether a judge's implied\nfinding of bias is to be upheld on appeal. And it's for\nthe reason that my colleague mentioned in part: If the\njudge is not asked to give a fuller explanation, there\nis no reason --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What has this to do with\nthe -- aside from the explanation, when I read through\nthe transcript, as I have, it seemed to me in the\ntranscript he didn't say a word that suggested he's\nagainst giving the death penalty. He kept saying yeah,\nin special circumstances, not always. Then they get\ninto this thing where he's been thinking of a person who\nwill in fact commit a crime again. And then it's put to\nhim directly: Have you thought about that he won't be\ncommitting a crime again if he's in jail the rest of his\nlife. He says: You're right; I hadn't really thought\nit through.\nI want to know, thinking it through, could\nyou consider the death penalty? Do you think under the\nconditions where the man would never get out again you\ncould impose it? Yes, sir.\nSo you don't think that if parole was an\noption, etcetera, repeating it. Death penalty? I could\nconsider it. Then could you impose it? I could if I\nwas convinced that was the appropriate measure.\nAnd it's absolutely clear he's not thinking\nof the repetition. It is clear he is thinking that it's\nsome kind of a mean. And I compare that with Witt,\nwhere the person just says no, I can't, and I compared\nit with this other case, Gray, and they say it's illegal\nto push him off a jury, a woman who is confused, and\nfinally she says: I think I could.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, I think your\nquestion goes to the heart of the case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's probably\nright.\nMR. DREEBEN: But the reason it goes to the\nheart of the case, Justice Breyer, is that you and I and\nevery other appellate lawyer and judge who have looked\nat this is dealing with a cold record, but the only\nperson who actually saw and heard this juror give the\nresponses was the trial judge.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what is it that he could\nhave done? Was he shaking, making faces? Was he\nshaking his head to indicate he believed the opposite?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Breyer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If something like that\nhappened, isn't a prosecutor of any sense going to say,\nI want it noted for the record that the witness while he\nsaid these words was chortling inwardly or something\nlike that?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Breyer, there\nwere five separate occasions during Juror Deal's voir\ndire in which he expressed either uncertainty or a\nmisconception about what the death penalty should be\nexposed for when measured against Washington law.\nAnd the overarching point that I make before\nI talk about those five instances is that this is a\nrecord in which there is confusion and uncertainty about\nwhether Juror Deal really can adhere to the law. And in\nthose circumstances, the only judge who can truly\nresolve that and determine whether he should be credited\nis the trial judge. And this Court has made that point\nover and over again in describing its voir dire.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If there is confusion, is\nthat grounds for excluding him?\nMR. DREEBEN: Confusion alone is not. If\nit's confusion it must rise to a level of preventing or\nimpairing the juror's ability to follow the law.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But even at this point,\nthis juror, he doesn't know anything about aggravating\ncircumstances. He doesn't know about mitigating\ncircumstances. He hasn't been told what the standards\nof -- that it was beyond a reasonable doubt.\nAnd to say that he should be criticized\nbecause when he was asked to give an example he said one\nthing and not another, it seems if you just read the\ntranscript, that there's nothing disqualifying. So as\nyou said, everything is the weight falls on the\ndemeanor, which an appellate court can't review.\nMR. DREEBEN: I think that that's right,\nJustice Ginsburg. It doesn't mean that there is no\njudicial review at all, in response to Justice Souter's\nquestion and I think the concern underlying your own.\nThere has to be fair support in the record for the\nconclusion that the trial judge could have resolved the\nquestion of a juror's competence to sit in the way that\nhe did.\nAnd if you had a record in which everything\nthat juror said was consistent with complying with State\nlaw, which I don't think this record is, and the\nprosecutor objected, and the judge says granted, and\nthere's no explanation, I think that would be difficult\nto uphold, even if it is possible that everyone in the\ncourtroom knew that the judge was relying on demeanor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is there anything in this\nrecord to indicate that the judge did rely on demeanor?\nMR. DREEBEN: What is -- no. There's\nnothing explicit. But this Court has said over and over\nagain that there does not have to be because in this\ncase, in particular, since there was no objection, the\njudge did not elaborate on his reasons at all. But the\nCourt has gone further in Witt and in Darden and\nbuilding on cases like Patton versus Yount, and made\nclear that it is implicit in a judge's action in\nresponse to an objection that he has relied on the\ntotality of the law and his observations.\nAnd here there were two instances during the\ndefense colloquy in which the juror specifically said\nthat his example of when the death penalty is\nappropriate is a circumstance when somebody is\nincorrigible and will reoffend if released. And then\nthree times during the prosecution's voir dire, he\nvolunteered, first of all, that it would have to be in\nmy mind very obvious that the person would reoffend.\nAnd this was a particularly significant answer because\nit wasn't given in response to a death penalty question,\nit was given in response to whether he could apply the\nreasonable doubt standard to the crime.\nHe again comes back to the reoffend notion\nafter having State law explained to him again, and said,\ncould you consider imposing the death penalty, he said I\nhave to give that some thought.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But he had not been given,\nas I understand it, the explanation of what the -- I\nkeep saying nine factors. Whatever the enumerated State\nfactors were. He had not been told that at any point,\nhad he?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, but I think the important\npoint, Justice Souter, is that under Washington law\nthere were really two alternatives, life without parole\nor death.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah, but the -- the\nquestioning was what grounds are you going to look to\nmake that decision; and he had not been instructed on\nWashington law on that at all.\nMR. DREEBEN: The concern that I think the\nprosecutor had and that the judge accepted is that this\njuror's vision of when capital punishment is appropriate\nis when somebody will get out and kill again. And under\nthat analysis, you would never impose capital punishment\nunder Washington law, because the defendant is never\ngoing to get --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But doesn't it follow that\nhis limited cases, the views about when the death\npenalty is appropriate would translate into views of\nwhether he could or could not impose the death penalty\nif instructed properly by the court?\nMR. DREEBEN: Not -- not automatically,\nJustice Stevens. I mean, this is an juror --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Doesn't it have to be\nautomatic in order to justify the result in this case?\nMR. DREEBEN: No. What has to be the case,\nand this Court in Witt made clear it is not going to\napply an unmistakable certainty requirement, is that the\njudge has to conclude that juror's views would prevent\nor substantially impair juror in applying the law. And\nthe judge had to make a call based on what he saw and\nwhat none of us did, of whether this juror's views --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't there a world of\ndifference, at least it has been my experience in trials\nlike this of what a juror will do on his own and what he\nthinks the law might be, and what is fair, and so forth,\nas opposed to what a, the juror will do in response to\nproper instructions?\nMR. DREEBEN: Yeah.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The jurors mostly are\npretty conscientious.\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, they there are. And --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is there any reason to\nbelieve this guy wasn't?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well the judge found one. By\nexcusing him after having --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well -- without -- because\nthere was no objection.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well he made clear, if I may\nconclude, he made clear at the outset as I think I did\nwhen I started my presentation, that this record shows a\njudge who was conscientiously applying the Witt\nstandard.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Dreeben.\nMs. Elliott.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MS. SUZANNE LEE ELLIOTT,\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMS. ELLIOTT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court.\nThere were in our view two findings by the\nWashington courts here. The first by the trial court is\nobjectively, an objectively unreasonable determination\nof the facts in light of the evidence presented, and\nthus the writ should be granted under 50 -- 28 --\n2254(d)(2)? And the supreme court's decision -- and\nI'll get to a moment to where I think their decision is,\nin the record, which conflicts with the State's view of\nwhere that is -- was an unreasonable application of this\nCourt's controlling precedent in Witt versus\nWitherspoon.\nAnd I would direct the Court to, in terms of\nthe State Supreme Court's finding, to page 173a of the\nappendix of the Petition for certiorari. But I would,\nof course, first like to start with the actual record in\nthis case.\nIn this case, the Washington State trial\ncourt's decision to excuse juror Deal for cause was be\nobjectively unreasonable based upon the record, because\njuror Deal said many times on the record, when presented\nwith the question of whether or not he could impose the\ndeath penalty under the sketchy view he had of\nWashington State's statutory capital punishment scheme,\nthat he could do so.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's the\nbeginning of the questioning, isn't it? It is not the\nend of it. It is surely not the law that just, whenever\na juror says sure, I'll follow the instructions, that\nhe's automatically -- has to be seated?\nMS. ELLIOTT: No, Your Honor. But it went\nbeyond that. And at page 73 of the joint appendix, the\nvery question was put to him by the prosecutor. \"Now\nthat you know that in Washington, if you find the\ndefendant guilty, you're only going to have two choices,\nthe death penalty or life in prison without the\npossibility of parole, could you still consider under\nthe appropriate evidence imposing the death penalty?\"\nAnd Mr. Deal said, \"I could consider it. Yes.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: After several times\nsaying the only time he would consider it is if the\nperson is going to reoffend. I mean, if he just gets\nthe right answer once out of six times and it's the last\ntime, is the judge required to ignore the prior\ncolloquy?\nMS. ELLIOTT: No, Your Honor, but I don't\nthink he only said it once out of those times. Judge\nKozinski identified in his opinion six times, and those\nare found on the record of proceedings at page 62, at\npage 72, and again at page 73. And he was repeatedly\nasked, and one time he was asked first I'm going to ask\nyou if you could consider it -- this is on page 72 and\nthen I'm going to ask you if you could impose it? Even\nif he would never get out.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But look at page --\nlook at page 262. He says, you know, could -- could\nyou -- when do you think the death penalty is\nappropriate? If the person would reviolate if released.\nMS. ELLIOTT: But that is one of, under --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There are others.\nMS. ELLIOTT: -- Washington law it's an\nappropriate consideration. And that's the -- and then\nthat was the example he gave, but he didn't say but I'm\nnever going to do it, if he -- if my only choice is\ndeath or life in prison.\nAnd I think that the State's reading of the\nvoir dire here actually expands both the objection made\nby the prosecutor and the -- the substance of the\ncolloquy with juror Deal.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What do you make of the fact\nthat twice just before his final statement he's given\nexactly the question whether he could -- whether he\nimpose the death penalty in any situation other than\nwhen the person might get out and kill again, and he --\nhis answers are at best equivocal. The first time he\nsays I would have to give that some thought. That's on\n72. And then he says I do feel that way if parole is an\noption. Without parole as an option I believe in the\ndeath penalty. Which is totally ambiguous. What do you\nmake of those answers?\nMS. ELLIOTT: I make of those answers as\nbeing entirely appropriate under the questions given and\nalso demonstrating that he's clearly not a juror who is\nsubstantially impaired or whose views would prevent him\nfrom considering the instructions that would be given to\nhim at the end of this case. If fact include him as a\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the -- what\nif the voir dire -- what if the juror said just what he\nsaid on a few occasions, that I would consider it if the\nperson would reviolate? And that was all. That would\nbe a basis for excusing him?\nMS. ELLIOTT: Under your hypothetical, no.\nIf, however, he said I will never impose the death\npenalty if the only choice is life without and the death\npenalty, I think that would be problematic under\nWashington law.\nBut he never said that. That's the reading\nthe State gives his voir dire but it's not there.\nBecause that would prevent him from making the decision\nthat Washington requires.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you -- you -- you\ninsist that he come out and say in so many words, I am\ngoing to be an unreliable juror. That's -- that's not\nthe way it happens. And somebody has to evaluate\nwhether indeed he's shading the truth a little bit and\nwhether, in fact, he will be impaired in his service.\nAnd some of these -- some of these answers suggest that.\nAnd it, it is not an easy call to simply say well, you\nknow, unless he comes out and admits yes, I'm going to\nbe a lousy juror, nobody is going to say that.\nMS. ELLIOTT: Well, Your Honor, I agree that\nnobody is going to say that, although in other cases, in\nother records and other cases cited by the State here,\nin fact, trial judges have made records of those kinds\nof situations, which are not present here. And in fact,\nfor example, I believe it was Gray versus Mississippi,\nthe judge got the feeling that jurors were giving\nanswers that would get them off the panel.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why was there no\nobjection if this was so clear? If this fellow had\nanswered all the questions the way you expect a, a good\njuror to answer, why was there no objection when the\nState moved to dismiss him?\nMS. ELLIOTT: It is not required under\nWashington law. And, in fact --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It may well be objected,\nthere were 12 instances --\nMS. ELLIOTT: That is corrected.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- in which the prosecutor\nwanted to excuse; in seven of those, there was an\nobjection.\nMS. ELLIOTT: That's correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So he certainly knew how\nto object. And you absolutely trap the trial judge here\nby not indicating to him that he should make some\nfurther finding. In fact, the -- the -- the lawyer\ndoesn't just remain silent. He's standing and says I\nhave no objection.\nMS. ELLIOTT: Well the question --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Judge Kozinski thought\nthe reason there was no objection was that this juror\ncame across as being pro-death penalty. Isn't that what\nhe said?\nMS. ELLIOTT: That's what he said. I --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't go as far\nas Judge Kozinski?\n(Laughter.)\nMS. ELLIOTT: On two points I don't go as\nfar as Judge Kozinski. One, I believe that actually\nthere has to be some deference to implicit findings; let\nme clarify that, and I know the State has pointed that\nout. I think Judge Kozinski's language was a little\nloose there. I think he probably agrees with me.\nAs to the -- the failure to object, first of\nall, if the court says, first of all, are there any\nobjections; now again we have admitted that what he said\nwas I have no objection. But the -- under Washington\nlaw, the prosecutor, the judge, and the defense attorney\nall knew that this issue could be raised for the first\ntime on appeal.\nThe prosecutor -- and I'm not saying on\nhabeas review, but in the trial court, a challenge for\ncause, the burden falls on the prosecutor to articulate\na basis.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's fine. But,\nbut competent counsel knows that getting something\noverturned on appeal is a lot harder than getting it\ndone right the first time. And he also knows that if\nyou raise an objection, you're more likely get it done\nright.\nI can't imagine why if he thought this\nperson was not properly strikeable he would have sat --\nindeed not just sat silent but said I have no objection.\nIt just doesn't make any sense.\nMS. ELLIOTT: Well I think he made a\nmistake, then.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, he made the same\nmistake the judge did. I wonder who else was there that\nmade the same mistake. I mean, you know, it makes you\nthink maybe, maybe the judge was right.\nMS. ELLIOTT: Well, Your Honor, the only\nbasis we have for the trial judge's ruling is the\nobjection made by the prosecutor. And the -- assuming\nhe incorporated that as the basis for his ruling. What\nprosecutor said was that -- he had two rulings. First,\nhe said I think he's overcome his problem with the\nexplanation about reasonable doubt. And so that's not\nan issue in this case. And he said, and I don't think\nhe has said anything that overcame this idea that, of he\nmust kill again before he imposed the death penalty or\nbe in a position to kill again.\nThat, it's our position is incorrect,\nunder -- an incorrect summation of what happened in the\nvoir dire and, in fact --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where are you\nquoting from?\nMS. ELLIOTT: I'm quoting from page 675.\nWhich is Mr. Matthews --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: 75 of the --\nMS. ELLIOTT: Of the joint appendix. Which\nis Mr. Matthews' objection. And the court makes\nbasically an unadorned grant of objection that for\ncause.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And incidentally the court\ndid not say are there any objections? The court did not\nsay that.\nMS. ELLIOTT: I'm sorry, Your Honor. The\ncourt says -- uh -- the bailiff will excuse you.\nCounsel, any challenge to this particular juror? That's\nat the bottom of page 64. And then what Mr. Mulligan\nsays is we have no objection.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but the court didn't\nsay is there an objection? So you're incorrect.\nMS. ELLIOTT: I'm sorry. So --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now on the that,\njust the language you just focused on, on page 75, if\nthat was correct, you disagree with it, but if if the\ncourt concluded that the juror had not overcome the idea\nthat he must kill again before imposing the death\npenalty, that would be a sufficient basis for excusing\nhim?\nMS. ELLIOTT: Under Washington law, I think\nthere would be a sufficient basis for excusing juror\nDeal if he said I now know what the statutory scheme is,\nand only if there's some possibility for release of\nMr. Brown and the opportunity for him to kill again,\nwould I impose the death penalty.\nWe know that would prevent him from imposing\nWashington's statutory scheme because once finding him\nguilty, the juror will never be released again. So the\npossibility of release would not be there. And so he\nwould reject the notion that you must consider\nmitigating factors if there's no possibility of release.\nWe argue in our brief that that's not what\nhe said. And in fact, Juror Deal was a thinking juror,\na juror who could, in fact, consider all of the options.\nWe disagree, of course, with the prosecutor's summary\nthat this concern about recidivism was somehow central\nor pivotal to Juror Deal.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You think he could have\nimposed the death penalty in this case?\nMS. ELLIOTT: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What's the harm then in\nreplacing him, from your standpoint?\nMS. ELLIOTT: The harm?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You're complaining about\nthe excusal of a juror who by your own submission would\nimpose the death penalty. So why am I here?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Because you don't know\nhim.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I would like to hear the\nanswer.\nMS. ELLIOTT: My answer is because it's a\nconstitutional issue and this juror could also have\nconsidered the mitigating circumstances that would have\nbeen proposed by the -- at that stage that were clearly\non the table for argument in front of the jury at the\npenalty phase.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You, according to this\nstructural error, so you have a death case, and so you\nhave this kind of error you don't have to prove.\nMS. ELLIOTT: Under Gray versus Mississippi,\nI don't have to -- Mr. Brown does not have to prove that\nit's harmless.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And then you're zeroing\nin on this particular juror and the colloquy, but\nshouldn't we look at the entire proceeding of the\njurors, including that there were -- what was it --\nseven attempts by the prosecutor to have a for cause\nexcusal?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: There were actually 12, I\nthink. Weren't there 12 objections by the prosecution?\nI was going to ask, we've already destroyed the rebuttal\ntime of your colleagues, but it seems to me that this is\na large number of challenges by the prosecutor. Can you\ncomment on that? 12? I mean, the defense objected to\nseven, and five objections were sustained.\nMS. ELLIOTT: I can't say in the vast\nuniverse of capital cases in Washington whether that's\nextraordinary or not.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Thank you.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How many days did this\ntake?\nMS. ELLIOTT: 17, I believe.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: 17 days? Less than one a\nday. That's pretty good.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah. How many\nparaded by? I mean, do we know?\nMS. ELLIOTT: I didn't count on a daily\nbasis, Your Honor. In a quality case in Washington, 17\ndays is probably pretty average, maybe a little short.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it does seem that\nthis trial judge was doing a conscientious job. He\ngranted five of the -- rejected five of the\nprosecutor's, and how many of those had been where\ndefense counsel had objected?\nMS. ELLIOTT: I think seven.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: He objected in seven and\nin five of those --\nMS. ELLIOTT: No. He objected to 12, and\nseven of those were granted, that's my understanding.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I'm not --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No. I think the\nprosecution challenged 12 times. There were seven\nobjections. Five were sustained.\nMS. ELLIOTT: Excuse me. I'm sorry, Your\nHonor. I misunderstood your question.\nSo yeah, I don't disagree that this Court\nshould look at the entire record of voir dire, and I\ndon't disagree that Judge Martinez is a conscientious\ntrial judge. The problem in this case is that when he\ngranted the challenge for cause to this juror, he did\nnot and he could not find that this juror was\nsubstantially impaired. He could not -- he was not\nprevented from following Washington law.\nThe --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In your view, do we\nlook at this any differently through AEDPA than if we\nwere looking at this on direct review?\nMS. ELLIOTT: Well, yes. I mean, you have\nto view it through the lens of the statute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that makes a\ndifference in the standard of review that we apply in\nthis case?\nMS. ELLIOTT: Well, there is -- prior to the\nenactment of AEDPA, there was -- this Court said you\ngive deference to the trial court's findings. AEDPA\nhas, of course, codified that deference by saying that\nthe trial judge has to be objectively unreasonable based\nupon the facts developed at the trial court level.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, does that mean\nwe give a greater degree of deference?\nMS. ELLIOTT: I don't think this Court has\nsaid what, on balance, what the difference between the\nkind of deference that was required under Witherspoon\nis, as laid against the kind of deference now. It's\nclear Congress wanted to provide a substantial amount of\ndeference to the trial court and limited habeas review\nof State court decisions. But as Judge Kozinski pointed\nout in his opinion in this case, that didn't mean that\nthey were going to completely eliminate Federal habeas\nreview.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm just trying to\nget a handle on your view as to whether the standard of\nreview with respect to deference to the State court is\ndifferent in this respect than it would be on direct\nreview?\nMS. ELLIOTT: Yes. I think under habeas\nreview, it's a more substantial review, because we have\nto show not only that the findings were unreasonable but\nthey were objectively unreasonable, which I think is a\ndifferent standard than saying you give deference to the\ntrial court.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask, one of the most\ntroubling parts about this case is the failure to\nobject. As I understand, under Washington law, that\ndoesn't making any difference, the review is exactly the\nsame as it would have been if there had been an\nobjection. But under our review as a matter of\nconstitutional law, should it make a difference?\nMS. ELLIOTT: I don't think so. I think\nit's one of those peculiarities of Washington law that\nyou should give respect to, but it is essentially\nmeaningless in the context of this case, because all the\nparties knew this case was going to be reviewed and\nreviewed. I mean, there's automatic appellate review.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you have any response\nto Justice Kennedy's concern that this really allows for\na mouse trapping of the trial judge who very likely\nwould have paid less attention to the issue as long as\nany counsel doesn't object, just as a realistic way that\nthis kind of thing is handled?\nMS. ELLIOTT: Well, I respect his concerns\nabout bushwhacking or mouse trapping, but the fact of\nthe matter is that that's Washington law and the judge\nwas well aware of it, as were the parties.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let me put it to you\nthis way: There's no demeanor finding here. Suppose\nthe judge had made a demeanor finding. That would be\ndifferent, the case would be a different case, wouldn't\nit?\nMS. ELLIOTT: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And if the objection is\nwhat prevents the demeanor finding, then maybe we should\nbe able to consider the fact there was no objection,\neven though Washington law doesn't require it before we\nconsider the issue.\nMS. ELLIOTT: But there's nothing in the\nrecord that says that the reason that the judge didn't\nmention the demeanor, or the prosecutor who made the\nobjection didn't mention demeanor. Certainly, it seems\nto me that if demeanor had been a concern based upon the\nanswers given by the juror here, and because the\nprosecutor had the laboring oar at the trial court to\nprovide a basis for the challenge for cause, he would\nmention it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your\nbrother made the point that there was a more elaborate\nexplanation of the trial judge's determinations when\nthere had been an objection.\nMS. ELLIOTT: I do believe that he had a\nmore lengthy explanation where there were objections.\nBut whether or not that would have -- there was\nsomething in the demeanor of this particular judge here\nthat he simply didn't mention, it can't be found here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but he said for one\nof the other witnesses, I just don't -- I don't believe\nhim. And if that had been his problem here, he\npresumably would have said the same thing.\nMS. ELLIOTT: Well, presumably then, he\nwould have said that in response to the prosecutor's\nobjections, which was not that we don't believe that\nJuror Deal could be credible.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not if there's no opposing\nobjection by defense counsel. When there was, and when\npart of his reason for granting the motion to strike the\njuror was demeanor, he mentioned demeanor.\nMS. ELLIOTT: That's correct, and here he\ndidn't. So I think the assumption was, he was granting\nthe objection on the basis provided by Mr. Matthews,\nwhich was incorrect both under Washington law and under\nthe facts developed in the voir dire.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The law on this, and you've\nread the cases more recent probably -- I've skimmed\nthrough some but not read them all, as I'm sure you\nhave. And the statement of the law that I want to know,\nis it still valid law, is in Witherspoon on 522, Justice\nStewart in the footnote. And what he says in that\nfootnote is, \"the most that can be demanded of a venire\nman in this regard is that he be willing to consider,\"\nand those are his italics, \"to consider all of the\npenalties provided by State law, and that he not be\nirrevocably committed before the trial has begun to vote\nagainst the penalty of death, regardless of the facts\nand circumstances that might emerge. If the voir dire\ntestimony in a given case indicates that venire men were\nexcluded on any broader basis than this, the defendant's\nsentence cannot be carried out.\" Is that still a valid\nstatement of the law or has it changed?\nMS. ELLIOTT: That is still a valid\nstatement of the law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of what law?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Of Washington law. No,\nthis is Justice Stewart of the Supreme Court.\nMS. ELLIOTT: This Court, which has been\nshortened into a --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Substantially\nimpaired.\nMS. ELLIOTT: -- substantially impaired\ntest.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which is a lot\ndifferent than irrevocably committed.\nMS. ELLIOTT: Well, it's substantially\nimpaired to prevent or substantially impaired, the\nability. And this juror never --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You would agree that\nsubstantially impaired is not the same as irrevocably\ncommitted?\nMS. ELLIOTT: Yes, I would agree, because\nyou could say I favor the death penalty, as this juror\ndid, and still sit on the jury.\nJUSTICE BREYER: This doesn't say -- that's\none of the things it says. But the other is, \"the most\nthat can be demanded of a venire man is that he be\nwilling to consider\" -- that's the word that's\nitalicized -- now, is there any -- \"and if you exclude\nhim on a broader ground than that, the death sentence\ncannot be carried out\". Now, is there anything in any\nlater case that suggests a change in that respect?\nMS. ELLIOTT: No, Your Honor. In fact, the\ncases affirm that. And in fact, this juror was\nprecisely the kind of juror that I think was appropriate\nto sit. What he said was, I can consider.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, he said that, but\nelsewhere he sort of indicated that he couldn't consider\nit unless it were a situation in which this person would\nbe able to commit the crime again.\nMS. ELLIOTT: But none of those statements\nindicated he would be prevented from voting for the\ndeath penalty, or that he was substantially impaired\nfrom doing that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They did indicate that\nunless that was the situation, he wouldn't consider\nimposing the death penalty. I think that's precisely\nwhat they indicated.\nMS. ELLIOTT: Well, if it means only that he\nwould consider the issue of future dangerousness, it\nwouldn't prevent him under Washington law. Because\nunder Washington law, first of all, the presumption is\nfor life. And second of all, the consideration of\nwhether or not a person would recidivate is both an\naggravating and a mitigating factor. So the fact that\nhe's concerned about reoffense is perfectly appropriate.\nWhere I think he could be prevented is if he\nsaid, if this -- unless this guy is going to be released\nin the future, and I don't think that's what he said\nhere, Your Honor. What he said was, recidivism is\nimportant.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I like recidivate by the\nway. I'm going to use it in the opinion. It's a very\nuseful verb.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If I can get back to my\nconcern about the failure to object again. Supposing\nthis defense counsel instead of just saying no\nobjection, said no objection, I think he's a hanging\njuror?\nMS. ELLIOTT: I think he's a hanging juror?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In other words, he thought\ncontrary to the prosecutor, his appraisal of this man\nwas that he's going to be pro-death penalty, and he let\nthat be known. Would that make a difference?\nMS. ELLIOTT: Well, I think that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I don't think it would\nunder Washington law. I don't suppose it would.\nMS. ELLIOTT: Well, if the juror said -- it\nwould make a difference under Morgan if the juror said\nI'm not going to consider any mitigating factor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, no. The juror just\ndid what he did, but everybody was evaluating his\ndemeanor in the courtroom, and defense counsel's\nevaluation was to mean I don't want that juror, he's\ngoing to hang my client, and that's what he thought and\nhe let it come out when he told the judge no objection.\nMS. ELLIOTT: Oh.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would that make a\ndifference?\nMS. ELLIOTT: It wouldn't make a difference\nunder Washington law because it could be raised for the\nfirst time on appeal, yes, if that wasn't what the\nrecord demonstrated.\nDid I understand your question?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You did. Do you think it\nshould make a difference to us if we think that he\ndidn't really want this guy on the jury?\nMS. ELLIOTT: I don't think there's anything\nin the record to suggest that, but for lack of his\nobjection. Because there's no harmless error analysis,\nI don't think it can make a difference to this Court,\nand because in Washington we have this peculiar rule\nwhich says you don't have to object.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the fact that this is\nstructural error, that there's no harmless error\nanalysis, mean that we should be very careful to give\nsubstance to the rule that there's deference to the\ntrial judge? And in fact, in the Witt case, we said\nthat the determination to excuse a juror is based on\ndeterminations of demeanor and credibility that are\nwithin the trial judge's province. We said that.\nMS. ELLIOTT: Absolutely. And if there had\nbeen a mention of demeanor on this record, I think this\nCourt's decision would be easy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What presumes that there\nis that judgment made by the district judge, whether or\nnot it's mentioned? It was not mentioned in Witt.\nMS. ELLIOTT: Well, what Judge Kozinski says\nabout that is if on the record -- you have a cold record\nhere which demonstrates in our view that the juror is\ncompletely qualified to serve, and nothing about him\nwould prevent him from serving. And you have no mention\nof demeanor by the trial judge, but speculation on the\npart of the prosecution, then all substantive evidence\nreview of juror challenges in capital cases is dead and\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Should defer to Judge\nKozinski's observation or to the Supreme Court in Witt?\nMS. ELLIOTT: You should defer to the\nSupreme Court's observation in Witt, but only I think if\nthere's some indication on the record that there is\ndemeanor. And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there's a\nthird choice which under AEDPA is the Washington State\ncourt decision to which we should defer.\nMS. ELLIOTT: The Washington State Supreme\nCourt decision?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMS. ELLIOTT: The Washington State Supreme\nCourt decision suffers a different problem, I think,\nYour Honor, which is that what the Washington State\nSupreme Court said on page 173 was that on voir dire he\nindicated he would impose the death penalty where the\ndefendant, quote, \"would reviolate if released,\" which\nis not a correct statement of the law. And in fact,\nthat is -- the considerations about whether or not\nMr. Brown would reviolate whether in prison or not are\nconsiderations under Washington law in a death penalty\ncase.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: On page 208, though,\nthe Washington Supreme Court also stated the standard,\nas I understand it from Witt, that Mr. Deal's views\nwould have prevented or substantially impaired his\nability to follow the court's instructions.\nMS. ELLIOTT: But -- I agree that there is a\nsummary that says that. But the substantive basis for\nthe trial court' decision I think is back at page, as I\nsaid, 173a, where he --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't the number of the\npage that you gave telling this is an appeal from a\ncapital sentence, and there are umpteen challenges made.\nSo the judge is dealing with Richard Deal in one\nparagraph. The defendant raised a host of challenges,\nand so there's not perfect consistency with what these\ntwo passages in the opinion. But mustn't we take into\naccount what this was? It was the defense brought out\nevery objection they probably could conceive of and they\ndidn't put particular emphasis on this, so it comes out\nthis way.\nMS. ELLIOTT: Well, if you're -- you mean in\nterms of the -- in the trial court? Or in the State\nSupreme Court decision?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In the Supreme Court.\nNow we're talking about the Washington Supreme Court.\nYou said they got it wrong because they said in this\nparagraph that he got the law you wrong, he made an\nincorrect statement of the law because he said he would\nimpose the death penalty where the defendant would\nreviolate if released, which is not a correct statement\nof the law.\nWe don't know exactly what that court meant\nby that paragraph, but we do know that the Washington\nSupreme Court was basing -- I don't know how many\nobjections they were dealing with in this opinion, but a\ngreat many.\nMS. ELLIOTT: Yes, and so if you then turn\nto the end of the opinion, if that's what you're asking,\nat 208, there's kind of a summary of their basis for all\nof the challenges made by Mr. Brown to all sorts of\nthings in the case.\nThere were also challenges to other jurors\nas well. And there are separate paragraphs where the\ncourt -- those jurors that are mentioned in the summary\nparagraph, where the court then explains the various\nreasons why it's upholding the trial judge as to those\njurors as well.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, my point is simply\nthat where the court is faced with so many challenges,\nthis particular one, there had been no objection at the\ntrial. So an appellate court might think we don't want\nto spend too much time on that one.\nMS. ELLIOTT: That is true. It appears as\nthough what they did was to, because this is not what\nthe trial judge said, this is the basis for the\nobjection by the prosecutor, that they assumed the trial\njudge adopted the prosecutor's objection.\nIn sum, there's nothing in the record that\nsupports a conclusion here that Juror Deal could not\nsubordinate his personal views about the death penalty\nor that he would frustrate the State's legitimate\npurpose in carrying out the State's legitimate interest\nin a constitutional capital death penalty scheme. So we\nwould ask this Court to affirm the opinion of Judge\nKozinski in the Ninth Circuit and grant the writ of\nhabeas corpus in this case. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMs. Elliott.\nMr. Samson, you have one minute remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. SAMSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SAMSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nIn response to the questions regarding the\nWitherspoon language and whether it's still good law,\nthe Court in Witt essentially said that is no longer the\nstandard. The standard instead is the substantial\nimpairment standard, and it is not required to show that\nthe juror would never impose the death penalty or\nautomatically vote against it by unmistakable clarity.\nAnd the fact that there were -- in response\nto Justice Ginsburg's question, the fact that there were\nso many claims presented to the State Supreme Court may\nexplain in part the summary opinion regarding this\nparticular issue. AEDPA does not require a perfect\nopinion by the State court to survive review. It only\nrequires reasonableness and an objective standard.\nIn addition, the arguments presented by\nMr. Brown are essentially: We disagree and the Federal\ncourts should disagree with the factfinding process done\nby the State courts. But the fact that a reviewing\ncourt reviewing the same transcript may reach a\ndifferent factual determination is not sufficient. If\nthe view reached by the State court is supported by\nevidence and is -- thank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
