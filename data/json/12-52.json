        "content": "(11:11 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will have\nargument next in Case 12-52, Dan's City Used\nCars v. Pelkey.\nMr. Bouffard?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDRE D. BOUFFARD\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BOUFFARD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe issue in this case is whether Section\n14501 of the United States Transportation Code expressly\npreempts the Respondent's State law consumer protection\nin tort claims for damages against a tow trucker who\ntowed his vehicle lawfully and then, several months\nlater, disposed of the vehicle after the fees for towing\nand storage had not been paid.\nBoth of these claims are preempted because\nthey are directed at the conduct -- the type of conduct\nthat tow truck companies all over this country every day\nengage in, in dealing with a particular type of tow\nthat's referred to in the business as nonconsensual\ntows.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Bouffard, this law,\nthis New Hampshire law, it regulates storage. Is this a\nlaw that applies only to the towing companies who tow\nthe automobile and then store it, or does the law apply,\nsay, to a garage, say, someone brings a car to a garage\nfor repairs, and does this storage law regulate garage\noperations as well as towing operations?\nMR. BOUFFARD: Justice Ginsburg, this law\nregulates abandoned motor vehicles. It's an abandoned\nmotor vehicle law.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- so it would apply\nto a garage operator.\nMR. BOUFFARD: Well, if a garage operator\ncame into possession of an abandoned motor vehicle, then\nI suppose it would. If -- if you look at the -- at the\ntitle to this subchapter of this New Hampshire statute,\nthe title is abandoned vehicles, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but what made it\nabandoned was that they tried to locate the owner,\ncouldn't and so -- this same thing could happen with a\ngarage owner as happened to the towing truck. So\nthere's nothing peculiar about being in the towing\nbusiness that makes this storage application -- storage\nstatute apply.\nMR. BOUFFARD: Well, let me be clear about\nthis statute, Your Honor. It's an abandoned vehicle\nstatute, and what's really important to understand with\nthis case is that none of the Plaintiff's claims rely on\nthis abandoned vehicle statute.\nThe Plaintiff has pled in his complaint a\ncouple of allegations of violations of this abandoned\nvehicle law, but the substantive rights that were sued\nupon by the Plaintiff in this case do not live in the\nabandoned motor vehicle law.\nThe substantive rights that were sued upon\nby the Plaintiff live in the State's consumer protection\nlaw, which is a separate New Hampshire statute,\nunrelated to the abandoned vehicle law. And secondly,\nthe claim that the -- the common law negligence claim in\nthis case arises out of the common law of New Hampshire.\nIt doesn't arise out of the abandoned motor vehicle law.\nOne of the sources of confusion, I would\nsubmit, in the New Hampshire Supreme Court's decision is\nthat it did not adequately deal with the -- the role of\nthe abandoned vehicle law in this case. The abandoned\nvehicle law actually plays a relatively minor role as it\nrelates to the causes of action that were pled in this\ncase and the causes of action that the preemption\ndefense is directed to in this case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's -- what's your\npoint? If it's not part of the towing law, then it's\nfurther removed.\nMR. BOUFFARD: The reason -- the reason why\nthese claims are preempted, Your Honor, is because they\nall stem from the towing of the vehicle, which was\nfollowed by the storage of the vehicle.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I guess you could\nhave thousands of claims across the country, millions of\nclaims where there are all kinds of towing laws.\nAnd -- you know, it says in Cambridge, Massachusetts\npark your car here during a snow emergency, it will be\ntowed. Probably every northeastern country has laws\nlike that. I guess there could be millions of\nnegligence claims when the thing is towed, the guy broke\na headlight.\nMR. BOUFFARD: Well, I think that's a\ndifferent -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And are all those things\npreempted? I would be amazed.\nMR. BOUFFARD: I don't think so, Your Honor.\nWe're not -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then what's the difference\nbetween this and -- and what could arise any day of the\nweek? I mean, as I read your brief, I -- are you saying\nthat all the northeast statutes that say your car will\nbe towed if you park here during a snow emergency, what\nhappens? I mean, do they have to go to the Department\nof Transportation? Boston couldn't function. I know\nthat they do tow cars. I don't know that firsthand, but\nI've seen it.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: So how's it supposed to\nwork?\nMR. BOUFFARD: There's no -- there's no\nclaim in this case, Your Honor, that the abandoned motor\nvehicle law is preempted, that New Hampshire's abandoned\nmotor vehicle law -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, all right, there\nisn't in this case, but I'm curious to know how it works\nbecause it seemed to me from what you're arguing, all\nthe abandoned motor vehicle laws and all the snow\nemergency towing and everything else that I see every\nday would be preempted a fortiori. So you tell me how\nit all works.\nMR. BOUFFARD: We are arguing that the\ncauses of action that were pled in this case, which are\na Consumer Protection Act claim for damages and\nattorneys' fees -- treble damages actually in the\nConsumer Protection Act claim. That claim is predicated\non the consumer protection law. It's predicated on the\nState of New Hampshire's policy protecting consumers.\nNow, there's -- there's an allegation in the\ncomplaint that there was also -- there happened to be a\nviolation of this abandoned vehicle law. But that is a\ncompletely meaningless allegation as it relates to the\nConsumer Protection Act because even if it were a\nviolation of the abandoned vehicle law, that would not\nmake it a violation of the consumer protection law.\nConsumer protection laws are intended to regulate\nfairness in business practices. That's what that\nstatute is about.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: My question is -- is the\nsame as Justice Breyer's. It seems to me you are\nrunning in the wrong direction. To the extent you say\nthe case doesn't involve New Hampshire's towing law but\ninvolves just its general consumer protection law,\nit's -- it's even further distant from being preempted.\nI -\nMR. BOUFFARD: Well, there's a difference,\nYour Honor, Justice Scalia, between whether the case is\npredicated on the New Hampshire towing law and whether\nor not these causes of action are related to the towing\nof the vehicle. Our point, and our primary argument, is\nthat all of these claims are related to, within the\nmeaning of this statute, to the towing of the vehicle.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose -- I understand.\nMy goodness. Suppose a vehicle -- I pay for somebody to\ntow -- I agree that somebody will tow my vehicle and I\nwill pay them $100. And he tows the vehicle, puts it in\nmy garage and says, give me the $100. And I say, ha,\nha, I'm not going to give you $100.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now, do you think that that\ngeneral obligation under State law to pay a debt that\nyou've contracted to pay is eliminated?\nMR. BOUFFARD: That's a very different set\nof circumstances, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that different from\nnormal consumer protection law? I -- I don't see that\nit's so much different.\nMR. BOUFFARD: Well, this -- this case\ninvolves a nonconsensual tow. This case involves a\nsituation where there was an opportunity, a fair\nopportunity, to pay for the towing and the storage\ncharges that had been incurred, and -\nJUSTICE ALITO: What difference does that\nmake? Suppose there was a towing company that lawfully\ntowed cars, but its practice was to hold the car for\n24 hours and if it wasn't picked up they would\nimmediately sell it for parts.\nYour argument would be that's preempted by\nthe Federal statute?\nMR. BOUFFARD: No, we wouldn't -\nJUSTICE ALITO: The State can't regulate\nthat?\nMR. BOUFFARD: I -- I think the State could\nregulate that, Your Honor. What the State -- what\nthe -- what a private plaintiff can't do in a case like\nthis is assert claims like common law negligence\nclaims -\nJUSTICE ALITO: All right. A private\nplaintiff could not assert a common law negligence claim\nif that were done?\nMR. BOUFFARD: A -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Lawfully towed, sold for\nparts within 24 hours because it wasn't picked up.\nMR. BOUFFARD: I think -- I think a private\nplaintiff could -- could probably assert that, that\nnegligence claim.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if that's -- if that\nis not related to payment for services, then why is this\n-- why is there such a relationship here?\nMR. BOUFFARD: That situation doesn't\ninvolve a payment dispute, Your Honor. This case -- the\ncase we have before us today, involves a payment\ndispute. This is really a payment dispute. A person -\nJUSTICE ALITO: It would involve a payment\ndispute to the same extent as this. Towed, notice sent\nout immediately, wasn't picked up within 24 hours, sell\nit for parts.\nMR. BOUFFARD: Well, that -- that's not a\npayment dispute. The parties haven't -- haven't\ndisputed whether or not there -- there is a payment\nobligation. The part -- this -- this case is about a\ndispute over whether there is even an obligation to pay\nfor the -- the towing and the storage services. That's\nwhat this case is about. This -- this plaintiff had an\nopportunity to pay for and to discharge his obligation\nunder State law. I -- I feel the need to -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: When? When did that\nopportunity come up? Because I thought that the notice\ndidn't get to the -- to the plaintiff, and then when the\nlawyer said, I have a client, it's his car, then the\ntowing company went ahead and put it up for auction.\nAnd then no bidders, so they sold it, pocketed the\nmoney, gave nothing to the car owner. So I don't\nunderstand how it's a dispute about payment. This is\nnot a case where the car owner said I won't pay for the\ntowing.\nMR. BOUFFARD: Well, Justice Ginsburg, we\ndon't agree with that. It is -- it is exactly that kind\nof case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: At what point did Pelkey\nsay, I won't pay for the towing?\nMR. BOUFFARD: There -- there's a letter in\nthe record of the New Hampshire Supreme Court, Your\nHonor, it's -- I believe it's at page 86 and 87 of the\nrecord in the New Hampshire Supreme Court, which is a\nletter from Mr. Shaughnessy, counsel for Mr. Pelkey, to\nmy client. And this letter was written something in the\nrange of 3 months after the towing took place, and -\nand before the vehicle had been disposed of.\nAnd the letter asserts that Mr. Pelkey\ndoesn't believe he should have to pay for any storage\nfees. He would -- he would pay the towing fees, but he\ndoesn't believe he should have to pay for any of the\nstorage fees. And that's -- that's -- that's really\nreflective of what this case is really all about. It's\nabout a dispute over payment.\nAnd the reason why this case is so\nsignificant -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Not payment over towing,\npayment over storage.\nMR. BOUFFARD: He -- he offered in this\nletter to pay the towing fees only. There was never any\ntender of payment. There was an offer to pay, provided\nthat -- provided that my client would tow the vehicle\nback to his place of residence because the vehicle\nwasn't operative at the time.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If this was a consensual\ncontract, he asked -- Justice Scalia's question. They\ncontracted for the tow. What State laws would be\npreempted under the FAAAA with respect to that private\ncontract? Would there be any?\nMR. BOUFFARD: The -- any breach of contract\nclaim that might arise on behalf of the plaintiff would\nnot be preempted. That's what the Court decided in the\nWolens decision.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How about, do consumer\nfraud laws apply to that contract between the parties?\nMR. BOUFFARD: The consumer fraud law\nmight -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's the basis of his\nclaim here.\nMR. BOUFFARD: It might apply as a matter of\nState law, but it would be preempted.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Ah, so you're arguing\nthat those laws would be preempted.\nMR. BOUFFARD: It would be preempted to the\nextent that it's a -- the case involves a dispute over\npayment for the services. This is a -- this case is\na -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That gets back to\nwhether the services include storage, which is what the\nNew Hampshire court said it doesn't.\nMR. BOUFFARD: The New Hampshire -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That the movement of\nproperty or towing doesn't include services for storage.\nMR. BOUFFARD: That's what the New Hampshire\nSupreme Court said, relying on the minority view that's\ncome out of the Ninth Circuit in the Charas decision.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why don't you answer\nthat question? As I read the list of things that are\npreempted, they have to do with storage during\ntransportation. Why should we read it more broadly than\nthat?\nMR. BOUFFARD: I think -- Justice Sotomayor,\nI think you are referring to the argument that's been\nmade by my friends with regard to the final phrase in\nthe statute with respect to transportation -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly.\nMR. BOUFFARD: And the short answer to that\nquestion is that the term \"transportation\" is a defined\nterm in Title 49, and it's defined very broadly for -\nfor good reason because that term is used throughout\nTitle 49. In fact, the term is used to define the scope\nof jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation, and\nthe definition of transportation is quite broad, and -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It -- it includes storage,\nis the point you are coming to, right?\nMR. BOUFFARD: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The definition includes\nstorage. You think it means -- it means storage at the\nend of the transportation? Suppose you're -- you're a\ncompany that moves goods, but we also store goods. You\ncan -- you know, rent -- rent space and we will store\nyour furniture for years. If that company picks up some\ngoods, brings it to its warehouse and leaves it in its\nwarehouse for 3 years, that storage is covered by\nthis -- by this statute, you think?\nSee, I thought the storage was -- was\nstorage in the course of the transportation. Sometimes\nwhen you're -- you know, changing the mode of\ntransportation, going from trucks to ships or something,\nyou have to store it temporarily during -- during the\ncourse of the transportation. That's how I would read\nit. But you're saying, even if you're a storage\ncompany, if you pick up goods and bring it to the place\nwhere you store it, that's covered by -- by this\nstatute.\nMR. BOUFFARD: No, that's not what I'm\nsaying, Your Honor. I'm saying that if you tow a motor\nvehicle, you bring the motor vehicle into your\npossession via towing and, as is the case here, you also\nstore the vehicle. And in particular in a case like\nthis, where the claimant was seeking to have the vehicle\nreturned to his place of business -- to his place of\nresidence, those are the facts of this case.\nThis wasn't necessarily the end of the\ntransportation. The plaintiff here, the Respondent, was\nasking for further transportation services at the end of\nthe day. So on the facts of this case, the\ntransportation hadn't ended. But even if -- we do have\na situation where there would have been no further\ntransportation.\nThe -- the reading that my friends have\nadvocated inserts the word \"incidental\" to -- to\ntransportation in the statute that doesn't appear in the\nstatute.\nThe definition of \"transportation\" doesn't\ninclude the word -- doesn't say \"storage incidental to\nthe movement of property.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let's say you park\nyour tow trucks on somebody else's parking lot, and you\ndon't pay the rent. So they sell your tow truck. Is\nyour claim against your landlord preempted?\nMR. BOUFFARD: I don't think so, Your Honor,\nbecause I don't think that that scenario would fall\nwithin what Congress intended by the term \"services\"\nthere. That -- that claim -- that claim that -- that\nyou've described, Mr. Chief Justice, is a claim that\nwould really be a -- a breach of contract claim between\nthe tow truck owners and his landlord. That would be\na -- a contract dispute. It wouldn't -- wouldn't relate\nto the transportation services of the -- of the tow\ntruck company in a way that is picked up by this\npreemption statute.\nIt relates to it in a very tangential way,\nin a very remote way, I suppose, but not -- not in a way\nthat's close enough -- not in a way that -- that relates\nto the business of a tow truck company in the way that\npayment disputes over -- over the services relate to the\nbusiness of the tow truck company.\nThere are any number of different types of\ndisputes that motor carriers, like tow truck companies,\ncould get involved in that wouldn't be preempted here.\nMotor carriers are involved in lots of different types\nof business activity that doesn't involve the delivery\nof their services. They could be involved in a real\nestate transaction, for example.\nThey may be buying a new -- a new depot, and\nthere may be claims that arise out of disputes in\nconnection with that real estate transaction. Those\nclaims aren't preempted by this statute, even though in\na very remote sense, they -- those -- those disputes\nmight be related to the business of -- of the motor\ncarrier. It's very remote, unlike a situation where the\nclaim arises out of the actual delivery of the\ntransportation services.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How does -- so if\nyour tow truck is involved in an accident, is that -\nand a suit is filed for negligence. Is that preempted?\nMR. BOUFFARD: I don't think that's\npreempted, Your Honor. I -- I -- and the reason I say\nthat is because there's a whole line of Court of\nAppeals' decisions in the airline area that deal with\nnegligence claims arising out of the negligent operation\nof the aircraft. And your scenario is the negligent\noperation of a tow truck as opposed to an aircraft.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm just looking at\nthe statutory language. It says -- you know, \"related\nto a service of a motor carrier with respect to the\ntransportation of property,\" and you know, your motor -\nyour truck is involved in transporting property. That's\nthe claim against you, that you don't -- you don't\nrender good service because you're negligent in a -- and\nit just seems to me to fit within the terms of the\nstatute, if you adopt as broad a reading as you adopt.\nMR. BOUFFARD: Well, literally, I think\nyou're -- you're right, Your Honor, that -- that the\nscenario you describe could fall within the literal\nlanguage of the statute, but the Court has said that we\ncan't go -- we can't necessarily go to the literal end\nof the earth in the reading of the statute, and we have\nto -- we have to limit this in some fashion. And the\nlimitation that the Court has fashioned -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, let me tell you how\nwe -- it seems to me we've limited it in -- in the\nColumbus case, Columbus v. Harrah's Garage and Wrecker\nServices, Inc. We said that, \"The clause -- the\nclause's limitation to motor carrier services with\nrespect to the transportation of property massively\nlimits the scope of preemption to include only laws,\nregulations, and other provisions that single out for\nspecial treatment motor carriers of property.\"\nAnd here you've told us that this case\ndoesn't involve any law that singles them out for -- for\nspecial treatment. To the contrary, it's the general\nconsumer protection law.\nMR. BOUFFARD: Well -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you want us to eat those\nwords, they were wrong, or -- or somehow you don't come\nwithin them?\nMR. BOUFFARD: Respectfully, Justice Scalia,\nI think those words came from your dissent in that case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ah.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I forgot that.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you say they were wrong,\nyou say?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BOUFFARD: No, no. No, I don't say that\nthey were wrong, Justice Scalia. What I -- what I would\nthough -- do though is I would point the Court to the\nlanguage of the statute, and not only the -- not only\nthe specific statute involved here, the motor carrier\nstatute, but there's a -- there's a twin statute that\napplies to air carriers. And it also applies to hybrid\nair and -- and motor carriers.\nAnd I apologize, I haven't sent up a text of\nthis statute in our appendix or anything, but it's -\nit's Section 41713 of Title 49, and -- and it includes\nvery similar, general -- broad, general, preemptive\nlanguage. And it does not -- neither of those -- those\nprovisions in 41713 contains limiting language that -\nthat -- that would limit the scope of preemption in any\nway.\nThe -- the -- and we know from the -- the\nlegislative intent with regard to the statute involved\nin this case directly that Congress intended that the\nscope of preemption for all of these different kinds of\nindustries would be coextensive. That's what Congress\nwas trying to achieve with this statute, was to give\nmotor carriers the same breadth of protection through\npreemption that air carriers enjoy and that hybrid air\nand motor carriers enjoy.\nAnd so if there are no -- if there are no\nlimitations with regard to air carriers and -- and\nhybrid air motor carriers of -- of the type that are\nsuggested by my friends for motor carriers, then -- then\nthat language at the end of 14501 can't be interpreted\nin a -- in a strictly limiting fashion.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, there's a lot of\nlanguage in the majority pretty much along the line that\nJustice Scalia said. And I might mention that point. I\nmean, Justice Ginsburg wrote the majority, and she said\nthe reference to regulatory authority of a State, which\nis a different reference, I agree, should be read to\npreserve, not preempt traditional prerogative for the\nState.\nAnd Justice White said previously that you\nhave to start with the idea that this is -- historic\npolice powers of the State are not going to be\nsuperseded by the Act, unless it's a clear manifest\npurpose of Congress.\nSo I guess the problem is, with a lot of the\nother things, that you yourself are in an area that is a\ntraditional matter of State regulation. It is, in fact,\nregulated in a way that applies to everybody. It is\nindirectly related to the transport itself, and that it\ntakes place on -- about storage that took place after\nthe event. So you have all that working against you.\nNow, the Columbus case does offer some hope\nfor the other side, I would think. But what do you\nthink?\nMR. BOUFFARD: Well, Justice Breyer, let me\njust say, first of all, that -- that consumer protection\nis -- is -- I'm not sure I would concede that consumer\nprotection is -- is an area of traditional State\nregulation. In fact, the New Hampshire consumer\nprotection law dates to 1970, and the Federal government\nhas largely occupied the field of motor carrier\ntransportation since 1935 with the enactment of the\nMotor Vehicle Act in that year. So -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's your problem,\nwhich is, what is it directed to? And that's the real\nissue in this case. Yes, it's preempted with respect to\nany towing activity. The issue is, is it -- is it\npreempted, as the New Hampshire court, said to storage\nand sale?\nMR. BOUFFARD: That is what the\nNew Hampshire Supreme Court said, Justice Sotomayor. I\nwould submit that -- that that's an artificial\ndistinction that fails to take into account the broad\ndefinition of \"transportation\" in Federal law.\nIf the Court has no -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But why should the tow\noperation be treated any different from the garage when\nthey're doing the identical thing, that is, storing and\nthen selling the vehicle?\nMR. BOUFFARD: Well, if a -- if a person has\nbrought their vehicle into a garage, Justice Ginsburg,\nthere's been no transportation by a motor carrier. The\ndifference is that in this case this whole scenario\nstarted out with a transportation by a -- by a motor\ncarrier which also, once it had possession of the\nvehicle, stored it.\nAnd so in a garage scenario, I suppose if a\ntower towed the vehicle to a garage and then left it,\nleft it at a garage to be worked on, that -- that garage\nowner wouldn't be in a position to say that I can assert\na preemption defense because that garage owner has\nnever -- has never engaged in the kind of transportation\nactivity that triggers this preemption law.\nI hope that answers the question. May I\nreserve?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. Thank you,\ncounsel.\nMr. Shaughnessy?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN C. SHAUGHNESSY\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. SHAUGHNESSY: Thank you,\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nTransferring title and disposing of\nMr. Pelkey's car against his will and not compensating\nhim for the loss of his personal property is not a\nservice of a motor carrier with respect to\ntransportation of property. The regulation of\nState-created property interests is a field of\ntraditional State regulation, and the broad sweep\nadvocated by Dan's City Used Auto in this case would\ncreate a regulatory vacuum because there are no Federal\nlaws that allow the sale of a motor vehicle.\nNow, let me address some of the things that\nmy brother has argued that this case is about that we\ndisagree about. My brother has argued that this case is\nabout payment. This case is not about payment. Mr.\nPelkey is not challenging that Dan's City Used Car had\nthe ability to tow the vehicle. We are not challenging\nhow it was towed. We are not challenging the price of\nthe tow. None of that is being challenged, and those\nare all the services of a motor carrier.\nLet me also -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about the price of the\nstorage? Are you challenging that?\nMR. SHAUGHNESSY: We are not challenging the\nprice of the storage. There was a reference to a letter\nthat I had sent to the Dan's City people several\nmonths -- but there were two letters. The first letter\nwas actually quite close to, within several weeks of the\nauction, where we said, no, we are looking to pay for\nit.\nThe other letter was, I think in June, was\nsaying, you need to account for these proceeds. You\nsold the vehicle at auction and there is equity in this\nproperty, you need to account for these proceeds.\nSo we didn't challenge the storage, but that\nbrings up the issue raised by Justice Sotomayor with\nrespect to the storage. And I would disagree with the\ncharacterization of my brother with respect to what RSA\n262 is. RSA 262 talks about removed vehicles. It\nactually provides the authority to law enforcement to\nremove a vehicle that might be in a public way, but it\nalso gives the authority to a private landowner to have\na car removed that's on their private property. It does\nnot relate to the motor carrier services of a tow truck\noperator.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it seems to me\nthat you can't ignore the fact that part of what tow\ntrucks do is store things. I mean, it's a necessary and\nintegral part of the motor service, the transportation\nof property, that they do. And regulation of the\nstorage will affect the services that they provide.\nMR. SHAUGHNESSY: Well, we would say -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not just\nlike -- it's not just like storing anything else.\nMR. SHAUGHNESSY: Well, respectfully,\nMr. Chief Justice, we would say that storage is a\nseparate service altogether. And the act of\ntransportation -- and this is another place where I\nwould disagree with the characterization by my brother\nwith respect to the definition of \"transportation.\" I\nbelieve the definition of \"transportation\" specifically\nrefers to a \"motor carrier,\" meaning a person providing\nmotor vehicle transportation for compensation, but also\nrelates to the movement of the passengers and the\nproperty, and the services related to that movement.\nSo the very definition that applies to this\ncase and to the transportation services relate to the\nmovement of the property.\nHere the movement has stopped. And the\nstorage that we are dealing with in this case is\nprecisely the storage that is in RSA 262, which is the\nstorage charges, not for the movement of the property.\nSo I would clarify, Mr. Chief Justice, that it is our\nposition that the transportation, with respect to the\ntransportation of property which Justice Scalia has\naptly pointed out, severely limits the scope of this\npreemption statute.\nThe services of the motor carrier terminated\nonce the hook was off the tow truck. That is when it\nstopped.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Suppose, Mr. Shaughnessy,\nthat the New Hampshire laws were more onerous than they\nare. Suppose they said to a towing company, once you've\ntowed this car you have to hold on to it forever. Or\nsuppose they said to the towing company, you have to\nhire private investigators to go figure out who owns\nthis car. Would any of those be preempted?\nMR. SHAUGHNESSY: Yes. I believe it's\npointed out in the Rowe decision, in order for it to be\nrelated to the motor carrier service you have to either\ndirectly regulate that service or it has an indirect\nconnection with the service that significantly affects\nthe service.\nIn your example, it would be a direct\nregulation. You're actually requiring a motor carrier\nto actually provide a service that the marketplace\nitself wouldn't provide or that the motor carrier would\nnot otherwise provide. So that is a direct regulation\nor an example of directly regulating that would be\npreempted under this statute. But what we are dealing\nwith here, the storage afterward, is not that motor\ncarrier service. And I do believe the language at the\nend with respect to -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do we draw the line,\nthat line that you just asked us to draw between direct\nand indirect? How do we articulate that line?\nMR. SHAUGHNESSY: The direct -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because now you're -\nnow you're articulating a different line. You are\nsaying this -- the hypothetical that Justice Kagan\nposited is not storage-related, it is something\nelse-related. It's towing-related. What's the\ndifference?\nMR. SHAUGHNESSY: Correct. The way I -- the\nway I interpreted the hypothetical is the State is then\nsaying in order as a precondition to or as part of the\nmotor carrier service of transporting or towing that\nvehicle, you also must provide this other service over\nhere, which is actually one of the problems with the\nRowe case and under the Maine State statute. Under\nMaine State law what they were requiring the motor\ncarrier to do in Rowe was actually to provide the\nverification service. And so that was a direct\nregulation I believe that this Court found under Rowe.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You've just told us\nanything that significantly affects the transportation\nservice is covered. And I think what your brother's\nargument is, is that this significantly affects the\nservice, whether he can collect for the storage\nafter -- you know, after the -- after towing it by -- by\nselling it, and by selling it on terms that are not so\nonerous as to impinge upon his -- his ability to run the\nbusiness.\nMR. SHAUGHNESSY: Well, it may impinge upon\nhis ability or impinge upon how much he can collect. It\nmay impinge upon those things, Your Honor. But it\ndoesn't affect the service of the motor carrier with\nrespect to the transportation of the property because\nthat's the movement of the property.\nCertainly getting paid is an important part\nof the service that anybody provides, but that is\ngetting too attenuated, that's getting too far out.\nThat's getting towards -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it isn't\ntoo -- I mean, this is a provision of course in the\nFederal Aviation Administration Act. Whatever rule we\nadopt is going to apply to air transportation as well.\nAnd is your position, for example, that\nthings related to a hangar at an airport, that those are\nnot covered by this at all? It seems to me that there\nthe connection between the transportation and the\nstorage, the storage of the airplane, you can see a\nlittle bit more clearly how that would affect what the\nairplane -- you know, can do. A lien -- you can't take\nthe airplane out of the hangar because you didn't pay\nthe rent or whatever.\nMR. SHAUGHNESSY: There is an effect there,\nand I do believe that this Court started drawing that\nline actually in the Travelers case. And when the\nTravelers case looked at this \"related to,\" that's\nwhat's causing the problem, \"related to\" and what does\n\"related to\" mean? And as has been pointed out, if you\nactually use \"related to\" to its extreme, everything is\nrelated to everything else. That has been said several\ntimes in the case law.\nBut \"related to\" in Travelers, I believe in\nthat case the Court looked at -- there was attention to\nthat type of broad sweep of \"related to\" and the\npresumption against preemption, which says we're not\ngoing to preempt, but \"related to\" seems we are\npreempting everything. So there was a tension.\nSo in Travelers we went to, well, we have to\ntake a look at what the manifest intent of Congress was\nfor the regulatory scheme. You have to look at the\nintent of Congress, and certainly the best place to look\nfor that intent was first in the words that are used.\nBut once we are looking at the intent, we\nhave to say does the actual thing that is being\nregulated by the State, and they are putting in their\nown policies by direct regulation by a positive\nenactment, does it affect or significantly affect the\nderegulatory purposes. And I believe that's the line\nthat was adopted in Rowe.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, don't lose\nthat. I will ask you this question to, which favors you\nin a sense but I want the answer really from the\nSolicitor General who may know. But I'm going to ask it\nto you too because you've probably both thought about\nit. He may have -- they may have some experience on it.\nIf you start talking about significant\neffect, without those last words, \"deregulatory purpose\"\nI suddenly worry about the following, that every city in\nthe United States depends upon towing to regulate\nparking within the city. We couldn't function without\nit, although none of us like it. We know that it's\nnecessary. And certainly a law that provides for towing\ndoes directly regulate the service of the tow truck. It\nsays do it. And then it tells you when not to do it.\nSo what's the -- what happens? Is every\ntraffic law in the United States involving towing\nsuddenly preempted? I can't believe that. How does\nthis work? So there is much more significance in this\ncase than the words we write, perhaps, than in the\nparticular case.\nAnd now, do you want to, in light of what my\nconcern is, add anything to what you say. And you may\nnot, the Solicitor General might, but I'd like to hear\nanything you have to say about that.\nMR. SHAUGHNESSY: Well, believe -- I believe\nwith respect to RSA 262, which is the statute that is in\nthis case, it doesn't require a tow truck company to do\nanything.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, you -- you can just\nrest on that, but I'm going to have -- or somebody's\ngoing to have to write an opinion. And we could just\nsay that, but I -- I don't see I can -- my own problem\nis not being able to have an intelligent answer to that\nwithout having some answer to the bigger picture. And\nthe bigger picture seems to me horrendously important.\nAnd -- and I don't know what that answer is.\nYou seem to be getting there with the words\n\"deregulatory purpose.\" And I -- and I was thinking how\nwe might try to work with those, but go ahead.\nMR. SHAUGHNESSY: Well, I think it's -- it\nis an easier case in this case under the FAAAA -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, I think it's much\nharder than this case -\nMR. SHAUGHNESSY: Well, I -\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- because the relationship\nis -- is in the -- in the more general case is more\ndirect to the tow truck. It says \"go tow.\" And\nthat's -- that's why I need some kind of bigger picture.\nMR. SHAUGHNESSY: I'm getting lost in the\n\"go tow\" command, if you will.\nJUSTICE BREYER: We have a statute which\nsays, if you park your car here for more than 3 hours,\nyou will be towed, okay? And as part of that statute,\nthough we don't see it, there is an arrangement for the\nservice of the city with the tow truck company, which\nsays when the parking person calls you and says -- the\nmeter says red, yellow, purple, green, you are to go\nthere and tow, okay?\nDoesn't that sound as if it's regulating the\nservice of tow trucks? And I suspect across the\ncountry, there is some variation on that theme, but\nthere are thousands of them. And since the words -- I\nwould be repeating it -- the words of this case may\naffect that situation, I want to know what you know,\nwhich may not be very much -- I don't blame you -- about\nthat broader situation.\nMR. SHAUGHNESSY: Well, thank you for the\nout, Justice Breyer. But again, I -- I -- the reason\nI'm getting lost is -- and I understand the -- the\nexample having to do with the City of Cambridge having\nno -- no parking, and if you're there for 3 hours, that\nallows -- there is this -- statutes that allow the tow\ntruck operator, the motor carrier, to go and collect\nthat under a nonconsensual tow. And a nonconsensual tow\nis a special animal, unfortunately, because there are no\nmarket forces in play there.\nBut I don't believe that that's affecting\nthe motor carrier service. There is nothing that forces\nthat tow truck carrier to go out and actually undertake\nthat tow. And if they do undertake the tow or do the\nbusiness or whatnot, then certainly, they would be under\nwhatever obligations that the State has.\nAnd that's one of the problems I think we\nhave -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I think that\nJustice Breyer is -- I may be speaking for him -- he's\nthinking that that State contract or that State\nregulation that permits towing companies to do this is\npreempted in some way. That would be his argument\nbecause it affects -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Or the opposite.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He's worried that it'll be\npreempted.\nMR. SHAUGHNESSY: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And he didn't -- he didn't\nmention Cambridge, did he?\nMR. SHAUGHNESSY: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think so.\nMR. SHAUGHNESSY: I think he did yesterday,\ntoo, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, you're both from\nBoston, Massachusetts.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And they're -- they're very\nattractive places except in the winter.\nBut a -- a motor carrier vehicle -- a\nservice, transportation includes related to the movement\nof passengers or property. Related to the movement of\npassengers or property. So we have these words \"related\nto\" again. I -- well, you've given me a couple of\nideas, but I -- maybe they'll turn out not to be\nrelevant, but -- but -- which I hope.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think maybe -- maybe we\nhave to make it up, what the limitation -- I mean,\nyou're quite right, everything's related to everything\nelse. And we've had trouble with the same -- the very\nsame words with ERISA, and -- and started off trying to\ngive it its -- its apparent meaning, \"related to,\" and\nwe finally concluded you can't do that.\nSo what do you want us to make up? What\nkind of a limitation do you -\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SHAUGHNESSY: Well -- Justice Scalia, I\ndon't think you have to make up too much in this\nparticular case. It gets easier to draw the line\nbecause of the with respect to transportation of\nproperty. So with respect to the FAAAA and motor\ncarriers, we're drawing the line as to only the services\nof the movement of the property, and that is limiting.\nAnd I do -- I would agree with your dissent.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Related to -- related to -\nrelated to the movement of the property. That's the\nproblem. It's the \"related to\" words.\nMR. SHAUGHNESSY: Correct. And then we go\nback to the instructions in Rowe, which -- which\nprovided the framework that when you're interpreting\nrelated to, you go: One, is it direct -- directly\nregulating or directly affecting service; or, if it's an\nindirect effect, which obviously it can be, it has to\nhave a significant impact on the services.\nAnd then there's the ultimate out of Morales\nthat says if it's -- it could certainly connect, but if\nit's too far attenuated to the purposes of Congress,\nit's just not going to be done.\nI know that doesn't help with the line\ndrawing in -- in connection of the gray area that we're\ndealing with in this case, but I do believe in this\nparticular case, it is easier because we have that -\nthose words of limitation, \"with respect to the\ntransportation of property\" are words of limitation, and\nthey are not present in the ADA, and they were not\npresent with the ERISA cases, which deals with a broad\nregulatory scheme with long history and other things\nthat apply.\nWe don't have that in this case. I believe\nthe New Hampshire Supreme Court got it right when they\nwere focusing on actually what is a service of a motor\ncarrier, and I believe we do have words of limitation in\nthis particular case.\nSo what the Supreme Court of New Hampshire\nsaid is, \"The manner in which a company in possession of\na towed vehicle may\" -- not must -- \"may dispose of the\nvehicle to collect on a debt created by the operation of\nState law is far removed from Congress's aim of\npromoting free markets and equalizing the competitive\nplaying -- playing field between motor carriers and air\ncarriers, and help assure transportation rate services\nreflect maximum reliance on -- on forces.\"\nI also believe that the Petitioner has\nbasically given up the case and conceded the case in\nseveral places in their brief and in here in oral\nargument today. If you look at page 34 of the\nPetitioner's brief, it says that most -- that \"The most\nthat Dan's City really can say is that the services\nwithin the meaning of Section 14501(c)(1) includes\nactivities that are incidental and distinct from the\nactual transportation services.\"\nSo the Petitioner's brief is calling the\nstorage afterwards, after the transportation has\nstopped. And -- and they call it incidental and\ndistinct.\nIn the reply brief at page 21, they say,\n\"Moreover, criminal laws prohibiting theft are not the\nkind of burdensome State economic regulation Congress\nsought to prevent with the FAAAA, nor are abandoned\nvehicle laws such as New Hampshire Chapter 262 in its\nregulations which do not hamper the operations of tow\ntruckers. Instead they establish procedures for the\nefficient handling and disposition of abandoned\nvehicles.\"\nSo they're conceding that RSA 262 in this\ncase, the statute does not have a specific impact, so\nthis is not a clear case.\nI see I have more time, but I think I've\nmade all my points, if there are no more questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Yelin, welcome.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LEWIS S. YELIN,\nFOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMR. YELIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nCongress deregulated the trucking industry\nto eliminate undue interference with market forces and\nconsumer choice. But market forces and consumer choice\ncannot operate on the sale of nonconsensually towed\ncars, and there's little reason to think that Congress\nintended to preempt State laws that regulate that\nconduct.\nThis Court in this case, as in many\npreemption cases involving the phrase \"related to,\" must\nengage in a -- in a process of sensible line drawing.\nEverything is related to everything else in\nthe literal sense. And the Court in Travelers suggested\nthat the Court should not -- courts should not use\nuncritical literalism in determining the scope of a\npreemption provision.\nI think that this Court does have some work\nto do in this case, but a lot of the groundwork has\nalready been laid in the Rowe case. In Rowe, this Court\nheld that a State law is related to a motor carrier\nservice if the State law either directly regulates the\nservice or if it has an indirect connection with the\nservice and a significant -- forbidden significant\neffect on Congress's deregulatory and preemptive\nobjectives. I think -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's -- I\nasked your friend on the other side the question.\nStorage is part of what tow trucks do. Maybe in a way\nthat -- you know, cross-country trucks don't. And it\nseems to me if you have a local jurisdiction who figures\nout, well, this is a great way to make a lot of money\nor -- you know, to give -- or the other way -- you know,\nyou can charge -- charge a lot because we want to keep\nsubsidized tow trucks. I mean, why isn't that fairly\ndirectly related to the service they provide?\nMR. YELIN: It's certainly a foreseeable\nservice that could be provided. The question is whether\nit has a sufficient locus to the transportation itself.\nI think there are indications in the statute\nitself and the statutory purposes which suggest that the\nCourt should view service as a separate type of service,\nindependent and distinct from transportation, at least\nin the towing context where the motor transportation has\nceased.\nThe reason for that, Your Honor -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand what you\njust said. Say it again.\nMR. YELIN: Yes, sir. I think that there\nare reasons in the statutory text itself and in the\nstatutory objectives for viewing service as\nindependent -- excuse me, storage -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Service where? Service\nwhere?\nMR. YELIN: I misspoke, Justice Scalia.\nStorage -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Storage, ah. I see.\nMR. YELIN: -- as independent of\ntransportation. And the reasons for that are as\nfollows: First, let me start with the statutory text.\nThe statute defines \"transportation\" as \"services\nrelated to the transportation of property.\" And storage\nhas been in the Interstate Commerce Act for over\n100 years, the term \"storage.\" And for over 100 years\nthis Court has construed disputes concerning storage and\nconsidered whether or not Federal law governed or State\nlaw governed.\nWhen the storage was before delivery of a\npackage, for example, the storage was considered to be\nstorage in transit and it was part of the transportation\nitself. But if the storage occurred after delivery,\nthat was a separate service not connected with the\ntransportation.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Yelin, I gave\nMr. Shaughnessy a couple of hypotheticals about very\nonerous regulations involving storage after the towing\nthat might very conceivably have an effect on the tower,\ndrive up the tower's prices, conceivably even drive the\ntower out of the market. So how do we draw the line as\nbetween this and those kinds of things?\nMR. YELIN: So I have two points that I\nwould like to make with respect to that, Your Honor.\nThe first is that I think the hypotheticals you gave are\nmuch more difficult cases and could very well cross the\nline if a State tried to indirectly influence towers.\nFor example, let's assume, if I may elaborate on your\nhypothetical, that a State really disliked the practice\nof nonconsensual towing, and really wanted to try and\nreign it in and so imposed certain conditions on towers\nthat would discourage them from engaging in this\nparticular type of service.\nI think that would be an indirect type of\nregulation, but it would, as a matter of fact, it really\nwould impair the ability or the interest of towers to\nprovide this service to -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How do we discover that?\nDo we look into the city council hearings or what?\nMR. YELIN: I think in part, Your Honor -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, I want to be able to\nlook at the law and say the law is preempted or the law\nisn't preempted. Don't tell me -- you know, the purpose\nof the law is this or that. That's not something I am\nable to do.\nMR. YELIN: Your Honor, I think some of\nthese preemption questions necessarily are factual in\npart in nature. The Court, to consider whether or not a\nservice of the motor carrier is affected by an indirect\nstatute is -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, that's factual. But\nwhether the intent of the city council was this or that\nis not factual.\nMR. YELIN: Oh, no. That's right, Your\nHonor. And I didn't mean to suggest that that would be\npart of the inquiry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that is what you\nmeant.\nMR. YELIN: No, Your Honor. The question is\nwhether it would have that effect, that factual effect.\nAnd if I may, I think it's critical in this case to\npoint out that Petitioner has conceded at page 21 of its\nreply brief that laws like Chapter 262 do not hamper\ntowing industry practices. And Respondent's amicus\nTowing and Recovery Association explains that laws like\nthis provide a critical backbone for nonconsensual\ntowing services. In the absence -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but I mean,\nmaybe these, but you can easily imagine that these types\nof laws would be subject to abuse and would have an\nadverse impact on the towing company and, therefore, on\nthe transportation of property.\nMR. YELIN: And if there were such abusive\nlaws, Your Honor, and if they do impair the\ntransportation of property and the services that a tower\nwas willing to provide, I think that the Court would\nlikely consider those cases and consider those -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, now we only -\nnow we not only have to decide whether this type of law\nis related to it, but once we say some of those laws\nmight be and some won't be, depending upon the impact in\na particular case.\nMR. YELIN: Your Honor, I think every law\nhas to be considered in its application, and I think\nthat, for example, in Morales, the Court just didn't\nconsider -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Every law doesn't\nhave to be considered in its application. If you say\nyou can't speak out on the sidewalk, it doesn't matter\nwhether they apply it, you can consider that law\nabsolutely.\nMR. YELIN: Fair enough, Your Honor. My\ncomment was too broad. What I would say is some laws\nwill be obvious. Those that directly regulate towing\nindustries, for example, a State law that flatly\nprohibits nonconsensual towing would be the type of\ndirect regulation which is proscribed by this preemption\nclause.\nWhen you are talking about indirect\nregulation, however, that perhaps is where I think one\nneeds to consider it on an as-applied basis because\nindirect regulation by definition is not going to have\nan obvious direct limit on towing services and the\nquestion the Court will have to consider is whether the\nindirect regulation is sufficiently onerous that it does\nimpair the provision of towing services.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It seems to me we have two\nchoices. In Morales, since I can mock my own opinions,\nI wrote at the end, \"it's not -- when it's too tenuous,\nremote or peripheral.\" That's singularly unhelpful.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: It seems to -- there -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought so at the time.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, you were right.\nThere are two directions you could go. But\nfirst I would like to know, it seems my guess is it is\nuniversally thought by cities that this Act does not\npreempt their normal parking regulations. Am I right\nabout that?\nMR. YELIN: You are right about that, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Then we either have\nto take this tenuous, et cetera, this is too much, this\nisn't too much, da, da, da, or you've given -- there is\nanother thought being thrown out and that is you relate\nit to the basic purposes of the deregulation act and you\nsay that where the city is regulating something that\nnever was, could not be, and is not part of a regulated\nor deregulated market, i.e. has nothing to do with the\nsubject matter, then it is not preempted.\nNow, do you want us to take that approach?\nShould we punt and just use the words like \"tenuous\"\nor -- and if we take the implicit suggestion, what's the\nright way to do it?\nMR. YELIN: Your Honor, I think the two\nalternatives you sketched are not mutually exclusive.\nIn fact, I think they support each other. I believe\nthat when a State law does not have a significant effect\non Congress's deregulatory and preemptive objectives, it\nis by definition going to be too tenuously connected to\nthe motor carrier services.\nI would propose, Your Honor, that in this\ncontext, where the Department of Transportation would\nhave no regulatory authority and where there is no\nprivate market that could fill the vacuum that would be\ncreated by the removal of State laws creating the\nstructure for the private choices that are undertaken\nhere, this would be a prime example.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So it would depend upon how\nsevere the consumer protection law is, is that right?\nIf it's a consumer protection law that really whacks the\ntow truck operator, that would be different from a\nmoderate, benign consumer protection law? We have to\nexamine each consumer protection law on its own, is that\nit?\nMR. YELIN: I think the answer has to be\nyes, Justice Scalia. In Morales, for example, the Court\nconsidered the application of the consumer protection\nlaw where the States were trying to use specific\nguidelines.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why doesn't\nthis one really whack them, though? It's treble damages\nand all that.\nYou can answer my question, yes.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. YELIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nYour Honor, the Consumer Protection Act\nclaims that are asserted here are premised on Chapter\n262, which structures the background organization of the\nnonconsensual towing services altogether. There will be\nno treble damages if the substantive provisions wee\nsatisfied. If they are not, that would be a different\nquestion.\nAnd, Your Honor, there has been no evidence\nsuggested here that in fact treble damages for a\nviolation of the background laws which structure the\nstandards that tow truck companies are supposed to\nundertake would have that harm.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Bouffard, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW D. BOUFFARD\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BOUFFARD: Thank you.\nLet me take a couple of moments to try to\naddress some of the questions that seem to be troubling\nsome of the Justices.\nJustice Breyer, the simple answer to why\nlocal traffic safety laws wouldn't be preempted is that\nthere's an exemption for the safety regulatory authority\nof States in the statute.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Thank you.\nMR. BOUFFARD: And, Justice Kagan, the\nreason why this -- this case goes over the line and is\npreempted is because what the Plaintiff's damages claims\nin this case seek to do is they seek to enforce duties\nthat go well beyond what even the New Hampshire\nabandoned vehicle law requires.\nThey seek to impose duties of reasonable\ncare to seek out the owner of the vehicle; they -\nthe -- the -- the negligence claim seeks to impose a\nduty to act -- a duty of reasonable care in disposing of\nthe vehicle; and -- and a duty of reasonable care to\nreturn the vehicle to Mr. Pelkey.\nAnd those duties and what has been a breach\nof those duties will be determined by a jury. And so\nwhen tow truckers are faced in the future with having to\nlive up to those sets of duties, they will never know\nwhether or not, in any given situation, their conduct\nwill be second-guessed as having been not reasonable by\na jury and they will be subjected to damages claims by\nplaintiffs. Under the -- the abandoned vehicle law, the\nrule is very simple in New Hampshire and under -- and in\nmany other jurisdictions -- pay, or your vehicle can be\nsold. It's a very simple rule. And -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it also tells how the\nvehicle will be sold -- sold, and your client is\ninvoking that statute in order to be able to sell the\ncar, but wants to have enforced only the parts that are\nfavorable to the tow operation. And the -- the regime\nin New Hampshire is, yes, you can sell the vehicle, but\nthis is how you do it. And it seems to me that that's\nnot how it was done here.\nMR. BOUFFARD: Well, Justice Ginsburg,\nactually, the -- the tower here wasn't invoking the law,\nthe tower was simply following what the law says in\nterms of the process. This is a mandatory process.\nWhen -- when a person comes into possession of another's\nvehicle in New Hampshire and -- and there's no claim\nmade for the vehicle, the law requires that the tow\ntrucker report that fact to the Department of Motor\nVehicles.\nAnd the Department of Motor Vehicles then\nlooks at the information that's provided and then\ninstructs the tower about the process of whether or not\nthe vehicle can -- can be sold without notice, or if\nit -- if notice is required, what notice is required.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But it's a process that\nallows you in certain circumstances to sell the car and\nto take the money. And what Justice Ginsburg is\nsuggesting is -- you know, you have to take the bitter\nwith the sweet.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Please.\nMR. BOUFFARD: Well, I -- I think\nthat the -- the New Hampshire law is the New Hampshire\nlaw, and what we have here is -- is a tow trucker that\nwas just making a good faith -- a good faith attempt to\ncomply with the law. And if -- if tow truckers that are\nmaking good faith attempts to comply with the law are\nfaced with Consumer Protection Act claims and negligence\nclaims and the kinds of remedies that come with Consumer\nProtection Act claims, that will have a significant\nimpact on the business of these motor carriers.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
