CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the court: In 1996 Congress updated the child\npornography laws to keep pace with technological\ndevelopments. Congress extended the existing prohibitions\non visual depictions of actual children engaged in\nsexually explicit conduct to cover virtually\nindistinguishable images in material pandered as child\npornography. These provisions are constitutional for the\nsame basic reason that other laws prohibiting child\npornography have been upheld. They protect real children\nfrom real abuse.\nThey do so in two important ways. First, by\npreventing the publication and production of materials\nthat are as effective as traditional child pornography in\nseducing children, and second, by allowing the government\nto effectively prosecute cases involving traditional forms\nof child pornography.\nFirst, these provisions allow the government to\nattack material that poses the same risk of enticing\nchildren into illicit sexual activities and to pose for\nchild pornography as traditional child pornography.\nThe government has a clear and compelling\ninterest in targeting such material; indeed, this court in\nOsborne against Ohio used that rationale to uphold Ohio's\nprohibition on the possession of child pornography.\nSecond and equally important, the government has\na clear interest in promoting the effective prosecution of\nthe traditional laws against traditional forms of child\npornography. The advent and increasing availability of\ncomputer technology has allowed individuals to generate\ncomputer images that are virtually indistinguishable from\ntraditional photographs. This allows criminal defendants\nto inject reasonable doubt arguments into virtually every\ncase.\nQUESTION: Has any case, to your knowledge, been\nlost on that ground in which that was a substantial\nargument?\nMR. CLEMENT: No case has been lost on that\nground but that is largely a result of the 1996 Act, which\nhas taken that argument away from criminal defendants.\nAnd to give you one very specific example, the case that\nthe Fifth Circuit heard in the Fox case, United States\nagainst Fox which is one of the cases where the lower\ncourts upheld this law in an as applied context, the\ngovernment's expert witness, Special Agent Barkhausen was\nforced on cross-examination to admit that she could not\ntell definitively whether or not the image was of a real\nchild. Now that concession prior to the 1996 Act would\nlikely have been fatal to the government's prosecution.\nQUESTION: Was that because she couldn't tell\nwhether the real child was over 18 or under 18 or because\nshe couldn't tell whether it was a real person?\nMR. CLEMENT: That case was because she couldn't\ntell it was a real person.\nQUESTION: Wouldn't she have the same difficulty\non the distinction between an 18-year-old and a\n19-year-old?\nMR. CLEMENT: In the cases where the line that\nthe courts are concerned with is the line between 18 and\n19, there's an additional aspect of the statute that\nclears up many of the problems and that's the affirmative\ndefense which allows individuals to produce and distribute\nmaterials if they make clear they involve actual\nindividuals who are over 18.\nQUESTION: But in terms of what you outlined, in\nterms of the two dangers, you say just the same as if it\nwere an actual child. Well, if it's a very young adult\nwho looks like a child, it seems to me everything that you\nsaid about the virtual pornography would apply to a young\nadult who looks like a child.\nMR. CLEMENT: That's certainly true, but I think\nCongress in recognizing an affirmative defense for\nmaterials that were produced using people who had reached\nthe age of majority struck a balance and recognized that\nthis Court has provided additional protection to\npornographic depictions involving actual adults.\nQUESTION: Okay, well the question of the\nbalance raises the question of tailoring, and what I\nwanted to ask you was if it's appropriate to have the\naffirmative defense that the children or that the people\ndepicted were in fact over 18, why isn't it equally\nappropriate to have an affirmative defense to the effect\nthat the depiction does not have anyone who is not a real\nchild under 18. In other words, if the government's\ninterests are protected by the affirmative defense in the\nreal child case, why shouldn't there be a comparable\naffirmative defense for the simulation.\nMR. CLEMENT: I think there are at least two\nreasons for that differential treatment. One is with\nrespect to age that's a fact that's uniquely verifiable\nand in a lot of contexts we recognize that somebody's age\nis something that one can verify. And in fact what we're\nreally talking about in most of these cases where the\naffirmative defense for age would be implicated are films\nand the like where there would be witnesses who could\ntestify that somebody was of a particular age on a\nparticular date.\nQUESTION: But in effect you're depending on the\nwitness to say that the actors here were in fact over 18.\nMaybe they'll produce facsimiles of birth certificates or\nmaybe they'll produce children or whatnot. Why can't you\nhave the same evidence to the effect that there were no\nreal children being used in manufacturing the film?\nYou're depending on witnesses in each case.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, in most of the cases when\nyou're talking about somebody who's going to make the\nclaim that they actually generated the photographs\nthemselves, there will be no witnesses. But I think more\nimportant than the presence or absence of witnesses is --\nQUESTION: But that's a question of proof and I\nsuppose that if the only person who steps up to the stand\nand says, there were no live children here, is the person\nwho was accused of the pornography, that person may have\nsomething to worry about in not having a very convincing\naffirmative defense. But that's the defendant's problem,\nnot the government's problem.\nAnd so I don't think that answers the question,\nwhy if the government is sufficiently protected with the\naffirmative defense in the one class of cases it wouldn't\nbe in the other.\nMR. CLEMENT: And I do think that age rather\nthan whether an image is computerally generated is\nsomething that is uniquely subject to verification and\nthis Court in its Ferber decision confronted the argument\nthat the New York statute was overbroad because it didn't\nlimit its protections to photographs and images that were\nproduced in the state of New York.\nAnd the court rejected that overbreadth argument\nfor two reasons; one, that it would be virtually\nimpossible for anybody to prove what was the state of\norigin for the photo. And I think the same analysis\napplies for a computer generated image. The second reason,\nof course, was that even materials --\nQUESTION: Why is it -- why is it that witnesses\ncan explain the age but cannot explain whether it was\ncomputer generated?\nMR. CLEMENT: Because, again, in sort of the\nstylized case that the person who's computer generated an\nimage, that's not something that requires a film crew to\nbe brought in so there aren't necessarily going to be\nwitnesses. In the case --\nQUESTION: But that's not the government's\nproblem. I mean, that may be the problem of the person\nwho has the burden of proof to carry on the affirmative\ndefense and if it is a problem then the government is the\n-- in effect going to be the winning party in resolving\nthat problem, but like Justice Stevens, I don't see what\nis essentially unique in the probative process to acclaim\nthat it was a computer generation rather than a claim that\nthe kid shown was over 18.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I'm not sure it's absolutely\nunique but I do think age is uniquely subject to\nverification. And if I could get to the second reason\nthat this Court pointed out in Ferber why you didn't need\nto have a limitation just to pictures generated in the\nState of New York, the Court recognized in footnote 19\nthat those materials, even if produced outside the State\nof New York, pose harms and potential risk to children\ninside the State of New York.\nQUESTION: Mr. Clement, may I ask you a question\nagain relating to the affirmative defenses or youthful\nadult pornography. There appears to be no affirmative\ndefense for possession of something that in fact used\nadults, is that right?\nMR. CLEMENT: That's right as a matter of the\nstatute. There's no express affirmative defense for\npossession.\nQUESTION: Well, let's relate that to something\nthat perhaps a number of people in this courtroom have\nseen. The film, Traffic, which depicts I guess someone\nwho purports to be under 18 engaged in conduct that would\nfit under the definition of the statute to be banned,\nright.\nMR. CLEMENT: I believe that's true.\nQUESTION: Did you see it?\nMR. CLEMENT: I did see it.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Okay. So presumably it would be\ncovered. Now, there is no defense to someone who rents\nthe movie, they possess it, no affirmative defense.\nMR. CLEMENT: There's no affirmative defense for\npossession but I think what the statute does is it\neffectively makes it so that in virtually, in the vast\nmajority of cases where the producers and distributors of\na film will be able to claim the affirmative defense, the\nindividual possessor will be able to claim the affirmative\ndefense because of a failure of the government's ability\nto prove scienter, because if you think about the\naffirmative defense it gives people the ability to\ndistribute a movie if it involves actors. But if they\nhave the right to distribute a movie that nobody can\nlawfully possess, it doesn't give them much, that's not\nmuch comfort to them.\nQUESTION: I don't understand. I mean I buy at\nthe video store three films, Traffic, Lolita, and Titanic.\nEach film has a scene of simulated sexual behavior by\n17-year-olds, all right? I think that was the question.\nThe question is, why am I not guilty under your\ninterpretation of the statute of a federal crime for\npossessing those three films?\nMR. CLEMENT: There's two reasons. One is\nprecisely in order to deal with this anomaly that they\ndon't want to be producing a film that nobody can lawfully\npossess, the affirmative defense gives an incentive to\nproducers and distributors to make it clear in the\nmarketing of the material that those scenes that you're\ntalking about were scenes that were produced using adults\nor scenes used with body doubles, and so in that sense\nthrough the marketing of the material they can make it\nclear to people that it involved adults.\nQUESTION: There is the defense for the\nproducer, but there isn't for the person who rents the\nfilm. It's just I --\nMR. CLEMENT: Exactly.\nQUESTION: -- I'm struck by what we're supposed\nto do with a statute like this.\nMR. CLEMENT: There is a requirement, though,\nthat the government prove scienter with respect to age in\nany prosecution for possession and I don't see how the\ngovernment could prove scienter as to age in the case of\nthese films where they're marketed in a way where it's\nclear that they involve adult actors.\nThere's a second aspect in which this Court\ncould find the affirmative defense to cover individuals\nand that -- individual possessors, and that is the statute\ndoes give an affirmative defense for receipt and as the\ngovernment argued in its briefs that naturally would cover\npossession incident to receipt.\nWhat it doesn't cover, though, and why I think\nCongress didn't have a blanket affirmative defense for\npossession is it doesn't apply to somebody who receives\nsome material that's marketed in a way or has a disclaimer\nthat makes it clear that it involves adult actors, but\nthen the individual somehow modifies it, strips out the\ndisclaimer. In that case, the possession is covered by\nthe statute and I think rightly so.\nQUESTION: Does it trouble you at all that the\nstatute would prohibit a motion picture company from\nemploying an 18-year-old actress to play the three roles\nthat Justice Breyer identified?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, it would trouble me if the\nstatute had that effect but it doesn't have that effect.\nThe affirmative defense makes it crystal clear.\nQUESTION: Even though the actress is under the\nstatutory age, 18?\nMR. CLEMENT: Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you said\n18.\nQUESTION: Would it trouble you that the statute\nwould prohibit an 18-year-old who is a child under the\nstatute from performing those three roles?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I think it's 17, but in any\nevent it doesn't trouble me if it's a 17-year-old is\nprohibited because they wouldn't be prohibited from\nplaying those roles if -- the studio would have two\noptions. They could either not include the sexually\nexplicit conduct which is all that's covered by the\nstatute, and I think it would be possible to have made the\nfilm Traffic without involving simulated sexual activity.\nBut putting that to the side, the other option\nis to use a body double and make it clear in the marketing\nof the film that that's precisely what you've done.\nQUESTION: I take it your answer to the question\nif this afternoon I go out, go to the video store, buy the\nthree films and bring them home is, yes, I am guilty of a\nfederal crime.\nMR. CLEMENT: Not at all. You could not be\nguilty because the government could not prove scienter and\nbecause you would have lawful --\nQUESTION: What do you mean you can't prove\nscienter? It says that it is a crime to buy, to possess a\nfilm that has simulated sexual activity by persons who\nappear to be under the age of 18. Well, I would tell you\nright now, I think that film did contain simulated sexual\nactivity by persons who appeared to be under the age of\n18.\nMR. CLEMENT: And again --\nQUESTION: I don't think it was real activity, I\nthink it was simulated, and I think they did appear to me\nto be under the age of 18. So am I guilty or not?\nMR. CLEMENT: You are not guilty for the two\nreasons that I've said and let me just say that you would\nhave the same problem with respect to the statute at issue\nin Ferber.\nQUESTION: Mr. Clement, I'm not sure what\nsimulated sexual activity consists of. I didn't see any\nof these movies.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: They were pretty good actually.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: One described in the briefs\nsupposedly was the shot of a juvenile, whether played by a\njuvenile or not, from the waist up supposedly engaged in\nsexual activity. Would you consider that to be covered by\nthe statute as sexually explicit conduct? I mean what if\nit was just the hand?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, certainly if it was just the\nhand and certainly -- I think there would be certainly a\nnumber of ways --\nQUESTION: Don't you think, I mean the\ndefinition of sexually explicit conduct is and what the\nstatute prohibits is this conduct by minors under 17 or\nyounger, sexual intercourse, engaging in sexual\nintercourse, bestiality, masturbation, sadistic or\nmasochistic abuse or lascivious exhibition of the genitals\nor pubic area. Now, the government has not made the\nargument that at least as applied to juveniles this is\nunprotected speech anyway and consists of obscenity which\na state or federal government is free, if it wishes, to\nprohibit?\nMR. CLEMENT: To the contrary, the government\nhas argued throughout this case that it's all unprotected\nspeech because it's child pornography. And I think\nQUESTION: Not because it's obscenity, you're\ncreating, you would have us create yet another category of\nprohibitive, something that falls totally outside the\nfirst amendment. Have you claimed, as Justice Scalia\nsuggested you might have, that at least some of this\nmaterial is obscene and therefore covered without regard\nto any new, any child pornography catalog -- category.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I want to be clear, I think\ngovernment would take the position that virtually all the\nmaterial covered by this statute is independently obscene,\nbut that's not how the government chose to regulate it.\nQUESTION: If the scene of a head of a person\nwho the other information in the movie makes it appear\nthey're engaged in sexual intercourse and all that is seen\nis the head of a male and a female kissing one another,\nthat would come covered by the statute.\nMR. CLEMENT: No, I don't think that would be\ncovered by the statute.\nQUESTION: Why not? It's simulated sexual\nintercourse.\nMR. CLEMENT: I think you have to read the term\nsimulated sexual intercourse in conjunction with the other\nterms in the statute.\nQUESTION: It expressly says there's no patently\noffensive requirement.\nMR. CLEMENT: That's certainly true but I think\nif you read the statute in context, I think there's some\nrequirement that the sexual intercourse that would be\ndepicted would require some display of nudity in the\nprocess. Certainly -- well, it doesn't -- it may not say\nthat and the statute itself may not address that case.\nAnd I would suggest that the proper way to resolve that\ncase is in an as applied challenge. Wait for the\ngovernment to bring that prosecution. In fact, I think\nthe government won't bring that prosecution. I mean, it's\ninteresting to talk about the film version of Lolita and\nthe like but that involves just a tiny fraction of\nmaterials covered by this statute, and if you want to bet\n--\nQUESTION: Ferber pretty much said that child\npornography is of almost no value, did it not?\nMR. CLEMENT: Absolutely, and that's why this\nmaterial that we're talking about is all probably\nvirtually, the government could capture it as obscenity\nbut of course if it tried to do that it couldn't ban the\npossession, and child pornography was treated as a\ndifferent case in Ferber.\nQUESTION: Child pornography is a different case\nbut very much like obscenity.\nMR. CLEMENT: Absolutely, like obscenity, what\nthis Court said in Ferber is the reason the statute was\npermissible is because it defined a category of conduct\nthat could be proscribed and was outside the protection of\nthe First Amendment.\nQUESTION: There's a vast difference between an\nactual child who was violated and a picture, a simulation\nin Ferber that you have relied on so heavily, what do you\nmake of a sentence that is not in the footnote, it is the\ntext, that simulation outside the prohibition and the\nprohibition was using an actual child, simulation outside\nthe prohibition could provide an alternative?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, let me just clarify one\nthing because the statute in Ferber itself also covered\nsimulated sexual activity so all these line drawing\nproblems about what, you know, at what point does the\nscene in Traffic come under the coverage of the statute\nalso applied in Ferber because it also captured simulated\nacts involving adults. So the only difference between the\ncoverage of this statute and Ferber is that this statute\ndoes attempt to prohibit materials that do not involve\nactual individuals but are virtually indistinguishable\nfrom --\nQUESTION: Yes, but even that sentence in Ferber\nsaid we're not touching in this case, here we have an\nactual child simulation outside that prohibition could\nprovide an alternative.\nMR. CLEMENT: With respect, I don't think that's\nwhat Ferber meant to say. I mean, Ferber, after all, was\ndecided in 1982.\nQUESTION: It used those words. It used those\nwords.\nMR. CLEMENT: It did, but it was decided in 1982\nbefore this technology even existed. And interestingly,\nif you look at footnote 20 in the Ferber opinion the Court\nwent out of its way to invoke the general doctrine that\nyou don't apply cases before they arise and you don't\nadopt a rationale any broader than necessary to decide the\ncase before it. And it just seems to me --\nQUESTION: What if we read that sentence as\nthough it were not there?\nMR. CLEMENT: No I think you read it in the\ncontext --\nQUESTION: Not in the opinion.\nMR. CLEMENT: -- with respect, I think you treat\nit in the context of what was prohibited by the New York\nstatute and the technology that was available at the time.\nAnd I think what's important here is any avenues for\nspeech that were left open in Ferber are left open by the\nstatute in conjunction with the affirmative defense. The\nonly materials that are covered by the statute and not\ncovered by Ferber are materials that didn't exist at the\ntime of Ferber and it seems to me that Congress is\nentitled to update the tech -- the pornography and\nobscenity laws to deal with technological developments.\nThe first federal obscenity statute in 1842\ndidn't cover photographs because the technology wasn't in\nwidespread use at the time. Subsequently Congress added\nphotographs to the cover to the obscenity statutes because\ntechnology developed and new problems arose.\nQUESTION: The Court relied very heavily on the\nnotion that if you use actual children they are harmed,\nthey are actually harmed, so what is the primary reliance\nthat you make for applying the same prohibition to these\nvideo images?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well I think there's -- I would\nmake two responses. First, I think this Court has never\nstrictly limited itself to the protection of the child\ndepicted in the image and it recognizes that legislatures\nin Congress have an interest in protecting all children\nbut secondly --\nQUESTION: It did seem to me that the Court, and\nI was here, played heavy reliance on harm to children.\nMR. CLEMENT: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: Actual children. So I'm asking you\nwhat is your primary reliance when you don't have that?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I don't know that we have to\nanswer that question in this case because we do have that,\nbecause this statute enables the government to continue to\nprosecute effectively cases involving traditional forms of\nchild pornography, because the advent --\nQUESTION: But that's not an answer to Justice\nO'Connor's question. Basically we're talking here about\noverbreadth and the government's argument seems to be that\nsince there is a class of materials that we can proscribe,\nthe fact that it's overly broad is the respondent's\nproblem. But the law works the other way around, you have\nto show that this statute is precise as to its coverage\nand that it covers no more and let's just for argument's\nsake, although I don't think that's the law, concede not\nsubstantially more than what can be prohibited. And\nJustice O'Connor's question was directed to this latter\nproblem and it seems to me you're not answering the\nquestion.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I'm trying to and I think\nthat, I mean, first of all, even in an overbreadth\nchallenge the burden does lie on the party challenging the\nstatute and they have to show things from actual fact in\norder to challenge the statute and I don't think they've\ncarried that burden.\nSecond, this statute is responsive to the\nproblem of protecting both the children depicted in the\nimage and all children who can be seduced or enticed into\nthis kind of activity can be depicted themselves.\nQUESTION: But the gravamen of her question,\nJustice O'Connor can explain her own question, but as I\nunderstood it, is that there's a substantial area here\nwhere adults who are play acting roles of children are\ncovered, and the question is what is the government's\ninterest in that?\nMR. CLEMENT: There isn't an interest in those\nplay acting cases and that's why the affirmative defense\nallows those to take place. But again, the question is as\nyou indicated substantial overbreadth and these questions\nwe're talking about, about Traffic and the film version of\nLolita really are a tiny fraction of the cases covered by\nthe statute.\nQUESTION: Why is it that the question I really\nwould like you to get to if you can is one that's really\nbothering me very much is the question that Justice Scalia\nasked and the thing in this area I do not understand, in\nthe entire area is why doesn't Miller work? There is\nobviously a set of materials which Justice Stewart used to\nrefer to as I know it when I see it and that material does\nnot have at its object communication. It has at its\nobject a certain activity which is not communication. Now\nthat's all over our society, and why, given this Court's\ndecision in Miller, is that so? And if I knew the answer\nto that question I would be better able to deal with this\nkind of case.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, let me first try to say two\nreasons why I don't think Miller is directly relevant and\nif those aren't responsive to your questions, maybe --\nQUESTION: I'd rather not hear why it's directly\n-- not directly relevant because my question, which is my\nown problem, not your problem, is I'm trying to understand\nthe area. There are several cases in this area coming up,\nthis is not the only one, and I want to know from the\ngovernment why it is, you've read in this area, maybe you\njust should direct me to an article. The problem I\npersonally am having as a judge is I think what Justice\nScalia was driving at, maybe, that's his question, is why\ndoesn't Miller work. Now maybe you'll tell me that it\ndoes, but that's contrary to my experience because it\nseems to me I see much material that would have flunked\nJustice Stewart's test all over the place. And it seems\nto me that that's the material that parents are worried\nabout their children getting a hold of.\nNow, if I knew why Miller was insufficient to\ndeal with that problem I would know better how to deal\nwith this kind of a case.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, one reason that Miller is a\ndifficult case and doesn't -- isn't terribly satisfying is\nit requires a case by case adjudication of that\nthree-prong test which I would say with deference is not\nself-defining. And what Congress decided to do in this\ncontext is follow the lead of Ferber where it said that\nMiller wasn't the test of child pornography and defined a\nmuch clearer class of material that whether or not it\napplies in Miller, whether or not the work as a whole is\nimplicated, this is a definable class of material that is\noutside the protection of the First Amendment.\nIf you have concerns about the Miller test then\nyou really should seize upon this statute and Ferber and\nthe analysis in Osborne as one way to deal with that\nproblem because here's a test that doesn't rely on\ncommunity standards or other difficult considerations to\napply in practice. It has a test that says when we're\ntalking about visual depictions only, we're not talking\nabout novels here, and we're talking about material that\ndepicts children engaged in sexually explicit conduct then\nwe don't have to look to the value of the work as a whole.\nYou can put all the Shakespeare around these visual\ndepictions you'd like and they're still visual depictions\nof children engaged in sexually explicit conduct.\nQUESTION: Mr. Clement, before you finish\nthere's something of great concern to me too because it\nseems that this is a big step away from actual child,\ninjury to an actual child to the effect on the viewer and\nthe same thing could be said for women with respect to\npornography, portraying women in a degrading way. The\nsame thing could be said for hate speech. So this, where\nthere is no actual child victim, where it's a picture and\nyou're talking about the effect of that on the viewer, why\nisn't it the same for all these other things that can have\na very bad effect on the viewer?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I think there are two\nprincipal reasons why you shouldn't be worried about that\nparticular slippery slope. One is this Court already put\none foot down that slope in Osborne when it relied on the\nseduction rationale in conjunction with the concern for\nthe children who were depicted. And in the same way this\nstatute responds both to harm, potential harm, to other\nchildren in the seduction rationale and to children\nactually depicted because as a matter of practical reality\nit's become very difficult for the government to prosecute\ncases involving actual, traditional child pornography.\nQUESTION: If you have this out you can use\nsimulated children, that will protect the actual children\nfrom being exploited. Why can't you say one as much as\nthe other?\nMR. CLEMENT: Because I think, as I indicated\nbefore, there are real verifiability problems that don't\narise in the context of age that do arise in computer.\nThe second reason, though, I think that you have\nto be less worried about the slippery slope in this\ncontext is the government has consistently gone to the\ncourts and told them to interpret appears to be to cover\nimages that are virtually indistinguishable from\ntraditional child pornography. It doesn't seem to put this\nCourt on a slippery slope to say that material that is\nvirtually indistinguishable from material that's already\nbeen held to be outside the protection of the First\nAmendment also will be outside the protection of the First\nAmendment.\nQUESTION: Are you asking us to read that phrase\ninto the statute, the virtually indistinguishable phrase?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, the virtually\nindistinguishable phrase already appears in the text of\nthe statute, it just doesn't appear in the operative\nprovision. So what we're asking you to do is to read that\nterm, appears to be, in light of the legislative finding,\nwhere it's not just the legislative finding where it's\nvirtually indistinguishable.\nQUESTION: You're asking us to construe the\nstatute narrowly to apply only to things that are\nvirtually indistinguishable from actual behavior, it would\neliminate cartoons and that sort of stuff?\nMR. CLEMENT: That's absolutely right and that's\nthe position we've taken in all the lower courts.\nQUESTION: Even the language that says conveys\nthe impression, you want us to give the same meaning to\nthat?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I actually think that the\nconveys the impression language could be given that\nmeaning but I think the conveys the impression language is\nmuch less problematic from a constitutional standpoint if\nyou understand subsection D of the statute to be addressed\nto pandering and in that context the concerns about\nvagueness are much reduced because you're not going to be\nfocused on just the image, you're going to be focused on\nthe way it's marketed, and I think in that context it\nwon't be difficult to see whether or not it conveys the\nimage. I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for\nrebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Mr.\nClement. Mr. Sirkin, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF H. LOUIS SIRKIN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. SIRKIN: Mr. Chief Justice and may it please\nthe Court: The petitioner's argument if adopted would\nhave three radical tragic consequences for First Amendment\njurisprudence. First in the name of protecting children\nall visual messages of adolescent sexuality will be\nforever barred regardless of their scientific, artistic or\neducational value.\nSecond, countless visual depictions --\nQUESTION: Excuse me, such as what? Such as\nwhat? You know, I try to think what great works of art\nwould be taken away from us if we were unable to show\nminors copulating or any of the other acts set forth in\nthe definition here. Can you give me a couple of\nexamples?\nMR. SIRKIN: Certainly, in the film area.\nQUESTION: Lolita?\nMR. SIRKIN: Lolita, Traffic.\nQUESTION: That would be a great -- leaving the\nbook, the movie Lolita, the book is perfectly okay, right?\nThis only applies to the movie?\nMR. SIRKIN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: The great work of western art.\nMR. SIRKIN: It's gotten critical acclaim. The\nmovie Traffic, I think, won an Academy Award. There's the\nmovie Tin Drum.\nQUESTION: What else besides the movie Lolita\nwould we be deprived of in order to prevent little\nchildren from being exploited?\nMR. SIRKIN: There's the movie Traffic, there's\nthe movie Tin Drum, there's a whole bunch of, you know,\nthere's the Brooke Shields movies that maybe some people\ndon't enjoy, but again it's there, the Blue Lagoon and the\nseries of movies such as that.\nQUESTION: In respect, this is not, you know,\nthe Mona Lisa or Venus de Milo or anything that has lasted\nmore than 30 years.\nMR. SIRKIN: It could very well affect, I think,\npainters because the statute -- excuse me.\nQUESTION: How about Romeo and Juliet? It\ninterprets one scene there that way.\nMR. SIRKIN: It could, if the movie -- a movie\nof Romeo and Juliet were made.\nQUESTION: Gee, you've seen a different version\nof that play than I have.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SIRKIN: Well, it depends on how they wanted\nto portray it. I think they would have to be prevented\nfrom showing or simulated sexual activity because if they\nare in fact, you know, to be considered to be underage.\nAnd secondly, countless visual depictions of adult\nsexuality will be prohibited where the adults depicted\nappear to some unknown censor to be younger than 18. And\nthird, it would open the door to banning other forms of\nexpression simply because the expression could be misused\nand/or abused by a small segment of society.\nQUESTION: Very well, how should it be read?\nHow would you write the statute so that it did take\nJustice Stewart's material that flunks.\nMR. SIRKIN: One is, I think, enforcement of the\nobscenity laws would be one way.\nQUESTION: Apparently that doesn't work and\nthat's why I'm puzzled. And where children, where you're\ndepicting children engaged in this activity, let's say\nthat flunks the Algerian seaman test or whatever it was he\nused to have.\nMR. SIRKIN: Your honor, there's --\nQUESTION: How is Congress to write a statute in\nthe area of children that gets at that problem, which is a\nproblem?\nMR. SIRKIN: I believe that Title 18, section\n2251 covers that problem. In the past there have been\nnumerous prosecutions, I think, prior to the passages of\nthis Act. In 1995 a member of the Department of Justice\ntestified before the Senate committee that heard evidence\nabout this statute and indicated that there had been a\nconviction rate of over 97 percent in cases that had been\nbrought against people for the possession or dissemination\nof material containing a depiction of a minor.\nSo that in fact has not been a problem in the\npast and apparently in this all in umbrella statute where\nthey used any visual depiction, which in fact if you use\nthe terminology any visual depiction it's not just limited\nto virtually indistinguishable --\nQUESTION: You have no problem then with the\nstatute before it was amended.\nMR. SIRKIN: I have no problem, this is a new\nstatute, 2251 and 2252 did exist.\nQUESTION: What did it do? How did it change\nthe law?\nMR. SIRKIN: It used the terminology, it created\na category of computer images that would be nonreal or\nother pictures or images that are nonreal and that are\nfictional characters into the act and it would be\nprohibited if disseminated or possessed.\nQUESTION: So, well, whatever was going to be\nthreatened in the way of free expression and so forth\nunder the new act was simply computer images of things\nthat were already prohibited if done by real people?\nMR. SIRKIN: No it did not, it included, it said\nany visual depiction, that would include that could be\nconsidered cartoons, illustrations, drawings, paintings.\nQUESTION: If the statute is construed to be,\nsay, virtually indistinguishable then I think cartoons\nwould not be covered.\nMR. SIRKIN: But the problem is it would still\nsuffer from the vagueness because what would happen is\nthat in fact I had a computer image of a fictional\ncharacter I'd never have a defense because I could not\ncome forward and prove that that fictional character was\nover 18. So if someone believed --\nQUESTION: That seems way out at the fringes\nsomewhat.\nMR. SIRKIN: Well but that leaves it to the\ndiscretion. It may be that the current administration may\nnot enforce this language but down the road nobody knows\nwhat will happen.\nQUESTION: You could cross that bridge when you\ncome to it then.\nMR. SIRKIN: Well, I believe when you begin to\ntalk about First Amendment rights to put it on to a case\nby case basis I think you are abridging, you know, a\nfundamental right and I think that in addition to that you\nhave the problem that if I get charged you're not just\nbeing charged with a violation of an obscenity law, you're\nbeing accused of being a child pornographer and that does\nhave some connotation and that has some ill effects just\nfrom the fact of being charged. And I would have no\ndefense.\nQUESTION: Well, does it cover things beyond\nobscene speech?\nMR. SIRKIN: Well --\nQUESTION: In your view.\nMR. SIRKIN: In this it does, it would cover,\nyou know, the morphing situation --\nQUESTION: Excuse me?\nMR. SIRKIN: I'm using the term morphing where\nyou use an identifiable and you can merge it in on the\ncomputer to, you know, into similar --\nQUESTION: Images of obscenity.\nMR. SIRKIN: That's correct, or of a sexual act\n--\nQUESTION: That is the expansion, is covering\nimages of obscenity.\nMR. SIRKIN: Well, it would be images, it would\nbe copying images of obscenity with an identifiable\nindividual or in sexual conduct and that is harm to a real\nchild because that person is an identifiable child and\nthat becomes a permanent record.\nQUESTION: But does it cover depictions of\nsomething more than obscenity?\nMR. SIRKIN: Well, when you use the terminology\nsimulated sexual activity it would, you know, it depends,\nI guess that goes community to community. But what you\nhave is like in the movie Trafficking where you have a\nyoung lady under a cover with a man on top of her, you\nonly see their heads but, you know, the simulated means\nthe appearance of, and that in fact does give the\nappearance and, you know, in that situation it is a\nrepresentation in the movie that that person is under the\nage of 18 --\nQUESTION: Don't you think the statute can\nreasonably be read giving the definition of the activities\ncovered not to cover two people under a bed with no\ndepiction of sexual organs or anything else.\nMR. SIRKIN: The problem is, is that the statute\nuses the term actual sexual activity and/or simulated, and\nagain\nQUESTION: It depends on what you mean by sexual\nactivity. If it's just a depiction without any indication\nof the sexual organs it's certainly reasonable to say that\nthat isn't covered.\nMR. SIRKIN: But that's not what the statute\nsays, though.\nQUESTION: Well, the statute does say explicit.\nDoesn't that cover what Justice Scalia --\nMR. SIRKIN: No it doesn't, because it says\nexplicit sexual conduct, actual or simulated and I guess\nit depends on how you read that word simulated.\nQUESTION: You say explicit. What work does the\nterm explicit do?\nMR. SIRKIN: It means clearly and again clearly\nwould mean to me that if it appears that they're under the\nblanket and that's what they're doing I think it's a\nreasonable inference to be made and I think that it would\ncover that as simulated activity.\nQUESTION: But explicit certainly can mean\nsomething different than clearly.\nMR. SIRKIN: It can, but it's not defined in the\nstatute. They could have gotten rid of the word\nsimulated.\nQUESTION: Then maybe the courts will define it\nso that it wouldn't cover the kind of thing you're talking\nabout.\nQUESTION: It is defined in the statute,\nsexually explicit conduct that was in quotes means actual\nor simulated sexual intercourse.\nMR. SIRKIN: And some other things, and it uses\nmasturbation and --\nQUESTION: It includes sexual intercourse, it\nseems to me it's sexual intercourse whether you see the\nentire body or only part of it.\nMR. SIRKIN: I agree with Your Honor that it\nwould be simulated if they're under the blanket and you\nsee the heads.\nQUESTION: I think the question is whether you\ncould, a court could say well, to keep this within\nconstitutional bounds we will read into the statute this\nbroad requirement that there be an actual showing of\nsexual organs.\nMR. SIRKIN: You know, legislatures write\nstatutes, I think the courts interpret them and I think to\nconstrue it you'd be basically rewriting the statute if\nyou did that, if you eliminated that terminology and I\ndon't think the government has urged that.\nQUESTION: Am I not correct in remembering that\none of the amendments to this series of statutes by\nCongress specifically eliminated the requirement of\npatently offensive and the like?\nMR. SIRKIN: They've done that in the child\npornography area a long time ago. They did that in Ferber\nwhen they said that it, just if it merely is children\ninvolved in sexual activity it's a violation of the law\nand it's not subject to the three-prong test of Miller and\nthe patently offensive is a part of the Miller test.\nQUESTION: Do you have any examples of the use\nof computer generated images covered by this statute where\nit has serious literary or educational value or scientific\nvalue?\nMR. SIRKIN: Well --\nQUESTION: Do we have examples of that?\nMR. SIRKIN: Today I don't know that we have\nexamples today of that. I mean, I would think that if we\nconvert the videos and the films that are being made today\ninto DVD, those are, that's a computer, digital computer\n--\nQUESTION: Because your concern is with the\nexpansion to these images of things that are already\nprohibited and yet I don't think we have examples of any\nserious use of them in --\nMR. SIRKIN: Well, if I --\nQUESTION: -- areas which would be of concern.\nThe examples that we've talked about today and that I\nthink you've identified seem to be of films using youthful\nadults.\nMR. SIRKIN: Well, that would be correct but I\nthink it's not, you know, too in the distant future that\nwe will be making films that will be virtual reality.\nQUESTION: But they're their strongest argument\nis -- I mean, I thought their argument is you're right,\nthose things you're talking about are not covered.\nThey're not covered today because everybody knows they're\nnot really under the age of 18, the actors. And tomorrow\nif we have a new system we'll worry about it tomorrow on a\ncase by case basis. Maybe all they'd have to do is put on\nthe top these are not real, I don't know what they'd have\nto do, but they're so few and far between that we\nshouldn't strike the statute down on its face.\nNow that's why I think people are asking you for\nparticular examples because if you have to make up an\nimaginary example that doesn't really exist then maybe the\ncorrect thing to do is say the statute shouldn't be struck\ndown on its face and we'll proceed case by case as a\nreasonable literary or scientific virtue to a particular\nthing. Of course the person can't be convicted. Now\nthat's case by case. I'm putting what I take it is their\nargument here.\nMR. SIRKIN: But the problem with that is it\ncreates a chilling effect because who's going to take the\nchance? I mean that's it, if the government says if it's\nclose to the line I think the petitioners have indicated\nin their brief that if it's close to the line then just\ndon't do it, you know, don't publish it, don't make it,\nand that's censorship.\nQUESTION: What about the other argument which\nis look, we're trying to protect the real children who are\nthe subjects of the film and the reason we need this to\nprotect them is because there is no way for any expert or\nanyone else to say when they see a film whether this is a\nfilm of a real person or whether it is a fake film made\nthrough virtual technology. The experts just can't tell\nus.\nMR. SIRKIN: Well, I think that becomes, you\nknow, an excuse.\nQUESTION: Is it true?\nMR. SIRKIN: It is not true.\nQUESTION: All right. You think it is not true,\nthey think it is true. Is there somewhere in the record I\ncould look or some place I could find out as to what\nexperts think?\nMR. SIRKIN: Yes, because I think you can look\nat the Senate hearing report where it's indicated that in\n1995 in relation to cases that were brought there was a\nconviction rate of 97.6 percent. In addition to that, that\nsince the enactment of this law the government has not\nlost a case and it was raised in the Kimbrough case and it\nwas raised in the Fox case, they were able to get a\nconviction.\nQUESTION: You say the congressional finding is\nwrong then because the statute begins with, among other\nfindings, new photographic and computer imaging\ntechnologies make it possible to produce by electronic,\nmechanical or other means visual depictions of what appear\nto be children engaging in sexually explicit conduct that\nare virtually indistinguishable to the unsuspecting viewer\nfrom unretouched photographic images. You say that that\ncongressional finding is wrong?\nMR. SIRKIN: That congressional finding, I don't\nthink it was empirically, there was no empirical evidence\nthat was really shown to Congress that that is correct,\nthat the computer, and I believe, and I think it's clear\n--\nQUESTION: So you have both your opponent and\nthe Congress who think you're wrong on this point.\nMR. SIRKIN: Yes.\nQUESTION: Okay. But your point still is, I\ntake it is, even if in fact the Congress is correct on\nthat, there's no evidence that cases are being lost\nbecause of this virtual indistinguishability problem,\ncases involving real children.\nMR. SIRKIN: That's correct. And I believe if\nyou want to make it easier for the government to make\nconvictions I think that we could get rid of the Bill of\nRights and it would be much easier for the government then\nto get convictions.\nQUESTION: Mr. Clement gave an example of\nanother case in which the government did obtain a\nconviction but only because of the new statute in which\nthe government witness was unable to say.\nMR. SIRKIN: That was that government witness.\nThat doesn't mean that there are not witnesses out there\nand experts that can make that distinction that if, you\nknow, there clearly would be, pardon?\nQUESTION: This was just a bad government\nwitness, you say?\nMR. SIRKIN: It could have been. I didn't hear\nthe testimony in that case but they did in fact get a\nconviction in that case. But I think it's equally as\ndangerous to create a barrier to First Amendment.\nQUESTION: Wouldn't have gotten a conviction if\nthe law had been what you want it to be, isn't that right?\nMR. SIRKIN: We don't know they wouldn't have\ngotten a conviction with that -- the testimony in that\ncase was that the expert indicated that he was not sure\nand could not positively say whether it was real or not\nreal.\nQUESTION: And on that basis can you find beyond\na reasonable doubt that it was a depiction of an actual\nminor.\nMR. SIRKIN: It creates an inference and a jury\ncan draw inferences from the evidence.\nQUESTION: Suppose the law put the burden on\nyou, on the defendant to show that this depiction does not\nuse an actual child. The defendant, because of this proof\nproblem, is not brought out, the confusion is it a real\nchild, is it a simulation. Suppose it were made the\ndefendant's burden to show that no actual child was used\nin this picture, would you have a constitutional objection\nto that?\nMR. SIRKIN: Yes, I would. And the reason being\nis that at least in the possession area that is not an\naffirmative defense because all it has to be in the\naffirmative defense, there is no, the element of age, of\nbeing able to come forward and show that it's not a real\nchild or that it's underage is not available --\nQUESTION: Okay, let's assume that that too was\nfixed. Those two features, Justice Ginsburg's and the\ninclusion of the possession is subject to the defense,\nwould the statute then be constitutional?\nMR. SIRKIN: I, the possessor though, you'd be\nswitching the burden of proof then I believe and I think\nthat would be an unconstitutional shifting of the burden.\nQUESTION: Well, you'd be making, you be -- are\nyou saying that the affirmative defense therefore is, in\neffect, has got to be constitutionally relevant across the\nboard?\nMR. SIRKIN: I believe that it is. I think the\naffirmative defense that's in this statute is\nunconstitutional.\nQUESTION: So there's no way to tailor it by\naffirmative defense in effect is your argument.\nMR. SIRKIN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: And how would that affirmative\ndefense prevent some of the evils that the government is\ntrying to prevent, for example the seduction of minors to\nsexual conduct by showing things that appear to be minors?\nHow would this, affirm -- the existence of this\naffirmative defense still enable the government to do\nthat?\nMR. SIRKIN: There are currently, there are\ncurrently lots of laws that deal with anyone who attempts\nto entice a child and I believe that those laws could be\nenforced and I believe that the penalties could be\nincreased and that could be a deterrent effect on that.\nWe're talking about the use of this material potentially\nby a very small segment of the population and I think it\naffects --\nQUESTION: Well, you could say the same thing\nabout a murder statute, you know, you don't expect a whole\nlot of people to go out and commit murders but that\ndoesn't mean Congress can't legislate against it.\nMR. SIRKIN: But here you can't legislate that\nif it's not, if it's a virtual murder and there has been\nno murder, you don't go out and arrest people. Here if\nyou use a virtual, a fictional character you can go out\nand arrest people.\nQUESTION: Well, if you want to talk about a\nvery small portion of the population I would think there's\na very small portion of the population that wants either\nto produce or to watch adolescents and children engaging\nin sexual conduct of the sort described in this statute.\nYou're dealing with a small portion of the population to\nbegin with.\nMR. SIRKIN: But if you use the principle that's\ninvolved here then I do believe you begin the slippery\nslope. You go from the idea you can use this and expand\nit, you can use it, you know, that if you have depictions\nsuch as, you know, the movie the Godfather, the movie Pulp\nFiction which are cult, you know, movies that are\nattractive to children, someone could come out and say,\nhey, look, join my gang, look how much fun it can be if we\ngo out and become extremely violent.\nQUESTION: What's worrying me about what you're\nsaying now is that if their factual hypothesis is true,\nwhich I tend to doubt, but I'm not an expert, that there\nis no technical way to distinguish between a photograph of\na real child and an imaginary child, if it were true,\nthere is no expert who could tell you the difference and\nyou tell me I can not have an affirmative defense, then\nthe government cannot prosecute real child pornography.\nMR. SIRKIN: I think they can --\nQUESTION: Because there would be no way to\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt that it was a real child.\nSo if you deny the government the possibility of the\naffirmative defense weapon you are denying them the\npossibility of prosecuting real child pornography.\nMR. SIRKIN: That's not correct because they've\nbeen able to get convictions and they've gone forward and\nthey've gotten convictions.\nQUESTION: Well, presumably people think that it\nis possible to distinguish between the real child and the\nvirtual fake.\nMR. SIRKIN: But I don't believe, you know, at\nleast currently they've not lost any of the cases and\nthere's only been the one where someone has raised the\nissue and that expert had indicated that they weren't\nsure.\nQUESTION: I think what you're doing is in\neffect varying the question, you're saying, look, in the\nreal world it doesn't happen, they can tell. But if you\nassume the hypothesis that Justice Breyer started with,\nthe factual hypothesis that if these are well enough made\nyou can't tell the difference, then doesn't it follow that\nif you rule out the affirmative defense route for the\ngovernment, the government simply won't be able to prove\nthe case in the instances in which real children are being\nused.\nMR. SIRKIN: I'm going to go back and I'm not\nbegging the question, again, if I have, if there is\nvirtual murder that looks so real on the screen, I don't\ngo out and charge anyone with murder.\nQUESTION: Well, we can distinguish attraction\nto other forms of socially damaging behavior from that\nparticular category of social -- socially damaging\nbehavior that has for hundreds of years been treated as\nobscenity. I don't think there's any risk of the Court\nsuddenly declaring that excessive violence constituted\nobscenity. We know what obscenity is. There have been\nlaws against this particularly infectious kind of\nsolicitation to conduct for centuries. I don't know why\nyou think we're going to suddenly flop over into\nprohibiting the Godfather because that also portrays\nsocially undesirable conduct.\nMR. SIRKIN: If you take the logic that's behind\nhere about people, you're getting at the person who is\nmisusing the material and there certainly I think is, you\ncan't even do medical --\nQUESTION: Sexual material in a category called\nobscenity which has traditionally for hundreds of years\nbeen regulable by government.\nMR. SIRKIN: But the obscenity here we're making\njust because it's a fictional character visually\nparticipating in an activity that I can write about, we're\nnow saying you cannot express, that we're saying, we're\ngiving it a social status, and I think when we start to do\nthat then we start to eliminate, we can start eliminating\nother areas equally.\nI further believe that, you know, as I've\nindicated, that the affirmative defense seems to be\ninadequate. It certainly does not cover the individual\npossession and that individual is in a position where if\nhe has three images, if he gets a DVD movie and he takes,\nand it has more than three images in it, he's now, you\nknow, can be prosecuted for possession of child\npornography. And, again, with the definition, when you\nput it together with the definition of simulated.\nI think that it is not narrowly tailored, it is\noverly broad because I think, again, it covers literary\nmaterial, it carries certainly for medical research, one\ncannot, there is no bona fide exception here for medical,\nscientific or educational or artistic merit, it's a\nblanket across the board prohibition. I believe the Court\nclearly indicated in Ferber --\nQUESTION: But what if we accept the\ngovernment's limiting construction, the government is\nurging that we use this, take the congressional finding,\nread it into the text of the statute and then it would cut\nout all the good things.\nMR. SIRKIN: I believe that the Court has\nindicated in the past in Turner Broadcasting and in the\nlandmark communications case that it's not for the Court\nto be rewriting statutes as they come out of Congress and\nparticularly in the area when it deals in areas of First\nAmendment. And I think that the Act, you know, and what\nwe're proposing here --\nQUESTION: Supposing that -- suppose we could\nconsult Congress, they would say yeah, preserve as much of\nthis as is constitutional. We wanted to do a whole lot\nbut if the constitution only allows us to do a little we'd\nrather have the Court say that than to throw out our\nentire product.\nMR. SIRKIN: All we're asking is, is the Court\nsever out two phrases and that is that is, is it appears\nto be and that it, you know, and where it conveys the\nimpression that a minor is engaged in sexual activity.\nQUESTION: Well, in X-Citement Video we did\nsomething not too different from this, reading in a\nrequirement that wasn't express in the statute.\nMR. SIRKIN: You did read in the elements of\nknowingly and you have to do that. Basically the\ngovernment is doing the same thing in this particular\nstatute because the knowingly appears in this statute\nexactly as it appeared in the statute that was interpreted\nby the Court in X-Citement Video. It says knowingly in\nrelation to mailing or to transporting, it doesn't say\nknowing as to the knowledge of the particular minority.\nQUESTION: But that's an example of a case where\nthere was a First Amendment challenge where we have read\nsomething into a statute that we might not necessarily\nhave done.\nMR. SIRKIN: The Court has the power to do that.\nQUESTION: And there's precedent for our doing\nit.\nMR. SIRKIN: Yes, in X-Citement Video the Court\ndid do that. But we're urging here that the fact is that\nthe Ferber and Osborne were based upon the harm to real\nchildren and we're now limiting something because of the\nmessage. We are socially making a determination here that\nthis is speech we don't like.\nQUESTION: Are you saying that if real children\nare not used in the depiction of simulated sexual activity\nthat it cannot be barred unless it meets the Miller\nstandard?\nMR. SIRKIN: Yes. It would mean --\nQUESTION: Eight year olds, ten year olds,\ntwelve year olds.\nMR. SIRKIN: They're fictional characters,\nbecause I think they do have a valid use in medical\nresearch.\nQUESTION: Suppose you said -- suppose you said\n-- suppose I -- I don't know how I'd do it, suppose I\ncould draft a statute which had a medical research\nexemption.\nMR. SIRKIN: It would make it narrower.\nQUESTION: Would it be constitutional?\nMR. SIRKIN: Again, I'd have to see the whole\nstatute and, again, I think that it would depend on how it\nworks and whether it still had the problems with the\naffirmative defense.\nQUESTION: Suppose you took -- I just want to\nfollow up on what Justice Kennedy said. Suppose you took\nMiller and said where you have clearly minors we as a\nmatter of law assume that it's patently offensive.\nMR. SIRKIN: That could be done.\nQUESTION: That could be done, you'd still have\nthe other two parts.\nMR. SIRKIN: Yes, and I think that most\ncommunities would feel, I think that all communities would\nfeel that that is patently offensive.\nQUESTION: I wonder if Miller would work more\nsatisfactorily if you did that in the case of people who\nclearly appear to be minors.\nMR. SIRKIN: I believe that it would.\nQUESTION: You think it would.\nMR. SIRKIN: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you Mr. Sirkin,\nMr. Clement you have one minute remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. CLEMENT: Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.\nCounsel for Respondent notes the 97 percent conviction\nfigure. Well, that reflects a couple of things. One, it\nreflects that the 1996 Act has allowed us to prosecute\ncases even where there is a reasonable doubt about whether\nit is a virtual image or not. The other thing that the 97\npercent conviction rate reflects is that we are not out\nthere prosecuting people who pick up Traffic at the\nBlockbuster. It's no accident that the one court that\nconsidered this case in a facial challenge struck the\nstatute down, but the four courts of appeals that\nconsidered it in an as applied challenge upheld the\nstatute.\nThose cases give you an illustration of what the\nstatute is really applied to. The Mento case involved\nover 100 images of prepubescent children. The Acheson\ncase in the 11th Circuit\nQUESTION: Is there any precedent that we judge\na free speech statute based on the kind of prosecutions\nthe government has been bringing?\nMR. CLEMENT: There is precedent and the best\none I can think of is Ferber for waiting until as applied\nchallenges to deal with the fringe cases, the tiny\nfraction cases. And I think, as in Ferber, if you wait\nfor those cases to be brought you'll find that they are\nnot brought in these cases.\nAnother point I think worth emphasizing is that\nI don't think given that this statute only covers explicit\nsexual conduct that there'll be much medical research\ninvolved.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\n"
