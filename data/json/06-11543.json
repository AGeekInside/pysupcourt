        "content": "(11:09 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Case 06-11543, Begay v. United States.\nMs. Katze.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MARGARET A. KATZE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. KATZE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe issue in this case is whether DWI is a\nviolent felony for purposes of an Armed Career Criminal\nAct sentencing enhancement. Sentencing enhancement\ntakes the statutory sentencing range from zero to 10\nyears and raises it to 15 years to life. The intent of\nthe Armed Career Criminal Act is to punish most severely\nthat category of recidivist violent offenders who are\ndisproportionately responsible for the violent crimes\nand who, when they possess a weapon, are more dangerous.\nThe government is trying to expand the reach\nof the statute by so broadly reading the residual clause\nas to include any crime that presents a serious\npotential risk of injury to another.\nSuch a reading of that residual clause would\nswallow the entire statute. Congress had no intention\nof including DWI within the ambit of the Armed Career\nCriminal Act. As Justice Breyer, writing for the First\nCircuit in Doe, said, \"there is no reason to believe\nthat Congress meant to enhance sentences pursuant to the\nArmed Career Criminal Act based on convictions --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If you're quoting that,\nthen this is what's now bothering me. I'm not saying I\nhave an answer one way or the other.\nLet's take two crimes and imagine that the\nsame number of people injured or killed is identical for\nthe two. One let's say is burglary and the other is\ndriving under the influence. Now, let's imagine exactly\nthe same number are put at risk, exactly the same number\nhurt, exactly the same number killed.\nWhen I wrote that opinion, it seemed to me\nthat there still is an important difference between the\ntwo crimes that is controlling here. But if you look at\nwhat I wrote, I didn't articulate that difference very\nwell. So I would like you to tell me what I should have\nsaid in order to have said very clearly just what that\nintuitive difference was.\nMS. KATZE: Your Honor, I think what you\nsaid was sufficient, but you might have added that there\nare other attributes to the -- the crimes in the -- the\nenumerated crimes, those being burglary, arson,\nextortion, use of explosives. There are certain\nattributes that they share in common that DWI does not\nshare, and those would include those, as you stated, an\nactive violent crime. But in addition to that, they're\nall property crimes, as this Court said in Taylor.\nThey are also all acts that have the intent\nof causing harm. DWI does not have that. They are all\nmore dangerous when committed with a gun. And they're\nall typical of crimes that would be committed by career\ncriminals.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Some of those\ncharacteristics don't seem to apply to all of the\nspecific crimes that are mentioned. Take somebody who\nsends a series of letter bombs for the purpose of\ninjuring other people. Now, that would fall within a\ncrime involving use of explosives. But it's not really\na property crime and it's not a crime that's more\ndangerous when done with a gun.\nSo how -- how can you say that those\ncharacteristics apply to every crime in the list?\nMS. KATZE: Your Honor, arguably they might\nnot apply to everyone every time. But I think the vast\nmajority of them do. And what we're looking at are in\nordinary cases. And the example that you gave of the\nletter bomb, I believe that would be a property crime.\nWhen we're talking about a property crime as with arson\nor use of explosives, it's the destruction of property.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think you can say that\nall of the crimes that are listed require mens rea and\nDUI doesn't; does it?\nMS. KATZE: Absolutely. Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's a big different,\nisn't it?\nMS. KATZE: I think it's a huge difference.\nDUI -- DUI in New Mexico is a strict liability crime.\nIt has no mens rea whatsoever. An individual doesn't\neven have to have the intent to drive. And, in fact, we\nhave a case in New Mexico where a woman had taken Ambien\nand was driving, and she didn't even know she was\ndriving, but she still was convicted because she merely\nwas in control of the vehicle. So in New Mexico, a\nstrict liability crime where you don't even have to know\nyou're driving, as opposed to the four enumerated\noffenses, where there is clearly some intent to cause\nsome harm --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you have the same\nanswer if you had a State statute which defined felony\ndrunk driving, as many do, as felony drunk driving which\ncauses serious death or serious physical injury to\nanother?\nMS. KATZE: I think it would -- the analysis\nwouldn't be different. There would be an additional\nelement, an additional piece of harm. But the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You would still say that\nthat statute does not qualify?\nMS. KATZE: Not unless there is a definition\nof -- if there is an actual intent to cause harm. If\nthere is just merely harm that's caused --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, there isn't in the\nusual felony drunk driving statute, there is --\nMS. KATZE: And I agree. I think in that\ncase, then that also would not fall within the statute.\nThere is not the intent to cause harm.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if the crime is\nvehicular homicide, defined as causing the death of\nanother person while driving intoxicated? Would that be\na crime that creates a serious potential risk of\nphysical injury to another?\nMS. KATZE: That would not fall under\nparagraph 2, because it would not meet any of the other\nattributes of the enumerated crimes. Possibly could it\nfall under paragraph 1, the use of force? It would\ndepend how the elements described what the definition of\nuse of force. This Court has previously defined use of\nforce as an intentionality that I think normally in that\ntype of vehicular homicide would not be included.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You are assuming, of\ncourse, that the canon of ejusdem generis applies to the\nstatute, as opposed to Congress just singling out a\ncouple of things it wanted to be sure were covered. And\nwe left that issue open in James, didn't we?\nMS. KATZE: Yes, you did. In James you were\ndealing with a clearly analogous case, and DWI is not\nanalogous in any way, shape, or form with those four\nenumerated crimes. And I think that it's pretty\nclear --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, in one way -- in\none way it is, in that like those other crimes it\npresents a serious risk of potential injury to another.\nThat's what they all have in common. It's a residual --\none argument that was made was when the statute was\nfirst drafted all it had was the residual, \"presents a\nserious risk of potential injury to another.\" So\nthat's, the argument is, that's what drives this\nstatute, and then these, these specific crimes, were\nadded just to be sure they would be covered.\nMS. KATZE: Your Honor, answering your\nquestion and the Chief Justice's question, I think it's\nimportant to remember that the first version of this\nstatute came out in 1984, and that just involved\nburglary and robbery. And then in 1986, we have the\nversion that we have now.\nWhat we are discussing is the debate in\nCongress that occurred between then and how the actual\nwording was made up. But I submit that if Congress\nwanted to use those four enumerated crimes merely as an\nexample, they would have structured the paragraph\ndifferently. They would have made a third paragraph\nunder definition of violent felony and they didn't.\nThere are two paragraphs. The second\nparagraph, the one that we're dealing with, clearly\nthere's a substantive connection between the four\nenumerated crimes and it says, \"or otherwise crimes that\npresent a serious potential risk of injury.\"\nIt seems clear to me if we look at this\nunder the rules of statutory interpretation -- and this\nis a statutory interpretation case -- that Congress\nadded those four crimes as a means of limiting the\nresidual clause.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then why did it use the\nword \"otherwise\"? Why didn't it use the word\n\"likewise\"?\nMS. KATZE: I would agree, \"likewise\" would\nhave been a more artful way to have written it.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It would have meant\nsomething different, wouldn't it?\nMS. KATZE: I think, in fact --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: \"Otherwise\" means in some\nother way.\nMS. KATZE: That's the dictionary\ndefinition, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, yes.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's usually the best way\nto understand each other is by, you know, assuming that.\nMS. KATZE: I would agree that's one thing\nthat we look at. But under -- this is a statutory\ninterpretation case, not a dictionary case, and we have\nto look at the plain meaning. And that involves looking\nat this turn of the phrase in context, in the whole\ntext. What was -- what was the intent of this statute?\nWhat's the term to be defined, \"violent felony.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You've run away from me on\n\"otherwise.\" I think the \"otherwise\" ties the last\nparagraph to the -- to the preceding four enumerated\ncrimes. And if -- if it had just gone on to say \"or\npresents a serious risk of injury\" without the\n\"otherwise,\" then I don't think you'd have any argument\nthat you have to somehow look to the degree of injury,\nthe -- the manner of injury that the four enumerated\ncrimes have. The \"otherwise\" ties it together, \"or\notherwise presents a risk of serious injury.\"\nAnd I think the implication is that the --\nthat the -- the injury must be similar to the -- at\nleast in degree to the enumerated crimes beforehand. I\nwouldn't run away from the \"otherwise.\"\nMS. KATZE: Your Honor, and I'm not running\naway from the \"otherwise.\" While I don't agree that\nit's the dictionary meaning, I do agree with you, Your\nHonor, that it is the substantive link. It's the\nconnection. It's a word and we have to give meaning to\nevery word in the statute --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But in -- in doing that,\nyou've got, in other words, to understand what\n\"otherwise\" means. You've got to look at the language\nthat follows \"otherwise.\" And that's -- that then\nrefers to \"risk of serious injury to a person.\" And in\neffect, it is saying the common element is risk of\ninjury to the person. How that risk is raised may be in\ndifferent ways from the way the risk is raised, say, in\na burglary case or what-not. And if that is the proper\nanalysis, then it seems to me you've got a tough row to\nhoe here.\nMS. KATZE: I believe the correct\nanalysis -- and I do believe that ejusdem generis does\napply here, because here we have a list of four specific\noffenses followed by a general term, and we have to read\nthat general term narrowly so as not to give additional\nbreadth to acts of Congress. And we have to remember\nthat we're defining the term \"violent felony\". And\nthose four violent felonies that have the certain\nattributes in common then are followed by \"or\notherwise.\" And in looking at it all in context, there\nhas to be some --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but then I was\nwondering about that as well, that as a violent felony\nwhether that gives you any traction. But extortion, you\ndon't normally think of that as a violent felony and yet\nit's clearly included in the definition.\nMS. KATZE: It's violent in the sense that\nextortion is trying to get something from somebody of\nvalue. It's the idea that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but you don't\nsay, give me that or I'll break your legs all the time.\nYou may say, give me that or I'll release this\nembarrassing letter. That's extortion. It's not\nviolent, though.\nMS. KATZE: I think it is violent in the\nsense of the terms that this Court used in Leocal and\nthat Justice Breyer used in Doe, the idea of some kind\nof violent act or more closely related action.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But then, releasing\nthe letter is not violent and it may cause embarrassment\nrather than physical injury. Yet it would qualify as\nextortion.\nMS. KATZE: It absolutely would, and this\nCourt in Taylor said that the four crimes all have those\n-- basically, in general, have those attributes.\nBut I think we have to look at the ordinary\ncase. I believe even in the hypothetical that you have\ngiven, Your Honor, is that -- that that does involve an\nact of violence against an individual's reputation, that\nreputation in the common law sense --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but it says \"person,\"\nnot -- it says \"person,\" not \"reputation.\"\nMS. KATZE: I'm sorry, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You're saying the violence\ncan be against the reputation. That's not what the\nstatute is talking about. I mean that is -- that's\ninconsistent with the plain language of the statute.\nMS. KATZE: But the statute does talk about\nviolence. If we look at the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It doesn't talk about\nviolence in the abstract. It talks about physical force\nagainst the person of another in number 1; and in number\n2, where we are here, \"a risk of physical injury to\nanother.\"\nMS. KATZE: Yes, Your Honor. And in the\nsecond paragraph it deals with property crimes. And the\nwhole -- it all comes under the rubric of violent\ncrimes. That's what Congress was concerned about. Even\nthe serious drug offenses, the reason those were added\nto the statute is the concern about violence with drugs.\nSo it all has to do with the idea of violence, and so,\ninitially, it was --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it has to do with the\nidea of risk of violence. A burglar when he commits\nburglary does not want violence. He wants to get the\nsilver out of the sideboard and get back down the\nladder. He doesn't want any violence with anybody.\nMS. KATZE: I would agree with you, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And the problem is that, by\nbeing in the situation he's in, he creates a risk that\nviolence will occur. Somebody may show up.\nAnd the person, likewise, who commits DWI\ndoesn't want to hurt anybody, but he has placed himself\nin a situation in which, if somebody shows up driving\nanother car in front of him or walking across the street\nor maybe even in apprehending him for his DWI, a risk of\nviolence is raised. The two cases in that respect are\nparallel.\nMS. KATZE: I would disagree, Your Honor,\nand here's why I don't think they're parallel. In a\nburglary, I agree with you, The individual doesn't want\nto get caught, but goes with the fear or the knowledge\nthat they may be apprehended. They may arm\nthemselves -- again, the concern with those violent\nactivities and being armed.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: When the drunk leaves the\nbar, doesn't he have the realization, unless he is just\nblind at that point, that he may be apprehended?\nMS. KATZE: It is just --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: He's not going to throw\nhimself into the arms of the nearest cop.\nMS. KATZE: Absolutely not, but here's the\nbig -- the big difference. If somebody is drunk and\ngets in a car, at most their intention is to get from\nPoint A to Point B. They have no intention of hurting\nan individual. They don't even have the intent of\ndriving.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right, but when a guy goes\nup the ladder for the silver in the sideboard, at most\nwhat he wants is the silver.\nMS. KATZE: But he intentionally goes to\nsomebody else's property to commit this act that will\ncause harm.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the driver\nintentionally drives the car knowing that there's a\nrisk.\nMS. KATZE: With all due respect, Your\nHonor, in DWI there is no intention to drive. It's a\nstrict liability offense, as the example I gave in --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that -- that is\nbecause everybody knows there are -- there are two\nconditions: One in which he just is reckless and he\ndoesn't care, in which case he has the intent; the other\none, he's so drunk he can't form the intent. Both of\nthem are covered, and the latter is simply because we\ndon't want an excuse to exonerate the more culpable of\nthe two.\nMS. KATZE: Your Honor, in New Mexico, DWI\nis a strict liability. There is no intent. There is\nnot even negligence. It's merely being in control of a\nvehicle.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's true in almost\nevery State, for the reasons that I've indicated,\nbecause many people have the intent, and those that\ndon't shouldn't be exonerated because they're more\ndrunk.\nMS. KATZE: If I may just add as well, in\nsome of the discussions about the actions of DWI and\nrunning into people, it's important to note, if we're\nlooking at this with a categorical analysis, just to\nlook at the elements of the offense. DWI in New Mexico\nwould necessarily -- there would have to be another\nelement. If somebody --\nJUSTICE ALITO: The residual clause is a\ndifficult problem, but I still have not heard what\ncharacteristic the enumerated offenses have in common,\nall of them, that provides a basis for limiting the\nresidual clause.\nThey're not all property crimes. A lot of\ncrimes involving explosives: Illegal possession of\nexplosives, illegally manufacturing explosives,\nobtaining explosives by making false statements. None\nof those are property crimes and none of them involve\ninjury to a person -- I mean involve the threat of the\nuse of force against a person. So what is the\ncharacteristic that all of the enumerated crimes have in\ncommon that would provide a limitation on the residual\nclause?\nMS. KATZE: At their very least, they all\nare acts that intend to cause harm. They all are\nproperty crimes. This Court reiterated --\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, they're not. In 18\nU.S.C. 842, explosives, unlawful -- \"It shall be\nunlawful to engage in the business of importing,\nmanufacturing, or dealing in explosive materials without\na license issued under this chapter.\"\nMS. KATZE: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE ALITO: There's no intent to cause\nharm there.\nMS. KATZE: Your Honor, the term in the\nArmed Career Criminal Act is the \"use of explosives.\"\nThis Court has defined \"use\" as having an\nintentionality, and intent -- and I think it's fair to\nsay that that intent to use those explosives -- and,\nfrom a practical point of view, people who -- and we\ncould talk about the ordinary case. People who use\nexplosives, they blow up property. They blow up houses.\nThey blow up bridges. At the very least, they're\nblowing up explosives. That certainly -- that certainly\nis an act to cause some type of harm to property.\nAnd, with respect to whether they are\nproperty, I submit all four are property crimes. This\nCourt said in Taylor all four of them are property\ncrimes. This Court interpreted the congressional -- the\nlegislative history. Those were four property crimes\nthat Congress specifically wanted to add to the concern\nabout violence --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- I don't\nunderstand this line of argue. You would exclude, let's\nsay, physical assault from -- from this, I mean assault\nwith intent to kill, because it's not a property crime?\nMS. KATZE: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That wouldn't be included\nin the \"otherwise involved\"?\nMS. KATZE: No, Your Honor, that would not\nfit under paragraph 2. That would fit under paragraph\n1, the use of force against an individual.\nCongress carefully crafted this statute.\nThey dealt with serious drug offenses and they dealt\nwith offenses against people, and then they dealt with\noffenses against property where there was --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's kind of odd,\nwhen the catch-all is phrased in terms of physical\ninjury to another, to say that it's concerned only with\nproperty crimes.\nMS. KATZE: Property crimes with the\npotential for physical injury to another, not just\npurely property crimes. The four enumerated crimes all\nhave the potential for physical injury to another.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it seems to me that\nyour argument gives us greater reason to treat the last\nclause as independent just so that we can be sure that\nit doesn't include only property crimes, because, as the\nChief Justice just pointed out, \"physical injury\" is\nreally the term that does the work in the second clause.\nSo it seems to me that you're almost giving\nus a reason to make that clause more independent, more\nforceful, more significant.\nMS. KATZE: Absolutely not, Your Honor. You\nwouldn't be able to make that interpretation, which is\nbasically what the government is suggesting, which would\nread \"otherwise\" out of the statute and therefore either\nmake it tantamount to a third paragraph, which there is\nnot a third paragraph, or would basically make the\nresidual clause so broad it would swallow the entire\nstatute. And we can't believe that Congress would have\nso carefully delineated the different areas of violent\nfelonies and then eviscerate it all with this residual\nclause.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question\nabout your interpretation of the word \"otherwise.\" Do\nyou think it is the equivalent of the statute that\nomitted that word, but added in \"conduct that presents\nan equally serious potential risk of physical injury\"?\nDo you think -- in other words, do you think that the\nfour examples define the risk of physical injury that,\nthe risk of potential physical injury the statute\ncontemplates?\nMS. KATZE: Your Honor, I don't know that I\nwould agree \"equally serious\" would be the exact correct\nequivalent. I think that that would be in keeping with\nJustice Scalia's, more or less, my impression of Justice\nScalia's dissent in James, because I would submit that\nthere has to be even more than just an equal balance of\nrisk. I do think that is an issue that needs to be\ncompared, as this Court did in James. The Court\ncompared the risk of attempted burglary to burglary and\nfound that they were similar.\nI think in a non-analogous case there are\nother attributes that we'd have to look at, and that's\nwhy we suggest --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, doesn't that\nsuggest that \"otherwise\" in the statute is in fact used\nto mean \"likewise\"? I mean, if we said \"attempted\nburglary\" in James it's obviously included because\nburglary is -- attempted burglary doesn't present a risk\nin a different fashion from burglary. It presents it in\nthe same fashion.\nMS. KATZE: And that was this Court's\nanalysis in James, and I think that that's reasonable to\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That was a helpful\nquestion.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. KATZE: I think it's important not to\nlose sight of the term that we are defining, \"violent\nfelony,\" and that -- as well as the purpose or intent of\nthe statute was to punish a very small percentage, as\nthis -- as this Court said in Taylor, a very small\npercentage of very serious offenders. This isn't a\nstatute that is written to say any individual who has\nthree felony convictions that may cause serious\npotential risk of injury to an individual is going to\nget 15 years. That simply wasn't the purpose. The --\nthe intent of the statute was to punish this small\npopulation of individuals.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, particularly\nwhen you look at subsection (i) in the broad reading of\nserious potential risk of (ii), why would -- why would\nCongress mean to exclude a particular category of\nphysical injury from the reach of the statute?\nMS. KATZE: Because if it -- if it did\ninclude absolutely everything, then it would swallow the\nwhole statute, because certainly --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, not everything;\neverything that presents a serious potential risk of\nphysical injury.\nMS. KATZE: I think it -- if it -- for\nexample, if it could include DWI, it would be hard to\nimagine what kind of crime wouldn't be included in\nthere. Under that type of reading, if we look at the\nstructure --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Filling out a false income\ntax return. I mean, I thought of one.\nMS. KATZE: Other than maybe some\nwhite-collar crime.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, there is a whole\ncategory of those. So --\nMS. KATZE: But the -- the problem with that\nanalysis is that Congress was very clear who these --\nwho this statute was geared at; and as Judge McConnell\nsaid in his dissent, the name of the statute, the Armed\nCareer Criminal Act, is not just window dressing.\nThere's a -- I mean, that just reinforces our\ninterpretation that there is this very small percentage\nof individuals. It's not supposed to be a general catch\nphrase. And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you think\npresents the most serious potential risk of injury to\nall of us, that we are going to be a victim of arson or\nthat we are likely to get hit by a drunk driver?\nMS. KATZE: Here's why it's hard to answer\nthat: I wouldn't argue with you that there are more\npeople driving drunk than there are people burglarizing\nhouses, but the relevant analysis is what's the risk in\nan individual incident? And in that case statistically\nthere is a greater risk of injury in a burglary, under\nthis Court's -- in Tennessee v Garner, it said 8.3\npercent, as opposed to a quarter of a percent in an\nindividual episode of drunk driving. So we can't put\nthe cumulative drunk driving on the back of Mr. Begay.\nWe look at the individual incident, doing categorical\nanalysis, looking at the elements in that individual\nincident.\nCongress was very concerned about issues of\nfederalism. The reason for the Armed Career Criminal\nAct was to support law enforcement efforts on the part\nof States, not to federalize crime, not to federalize\ncriminal investigation and prosecution. We are\nsuggesting that keeping that in mind and looking at the\n-- the plain meaning of the phrase that we were\ndiscussing, and looking at the way the statute is\nactually structured and the fact that there are not\nthree different paragraphs, as well as the fact that\nCongress could have picked to just say \"or\" as opposed\nto \"or otherwise,\" and we have to give \"otherwise\" a\nmeaning; and we suggest that our meaning of \"likewise\"\nis one that this Court has adopted previously.\nPreviously this Court has said \"or otherwise\nqualified for a position\" and found that people were\nqualified in a similar way than other people; \"otherwise\nqualified to vote,\" found that individuals were as\nqualified or similarly qualified as individuals of\nanother race. One other example, bringing a -- by\ncertiorari \"or otherwise\" was found to be found to mean\nto be by similar means as certiorari.\nAnd, Your Honor, if I may reserve the\nremainder of my time?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMS. KATZE: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Kruger.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONDRA R. KRUGER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. KRUGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nDrunk driving is an act that by its nature\nendangers people's lives. It is precisely for that\nreason that it is a crime under the laws of all 50\nStates. When a person is repeatedly convicted of that\noffense and therefore becomes subject to punishment as a\nfelon, he has committed a violent felony as Congress\ndefined that term in the Armed Career Criminal Act, that\nis because he has committed a crime that in the words of\nthe statute involves conduct that presents a serious\npotential risk of --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How about a habitual\nspeeder?\nMS. KRUGER: Well, speeding isn't a felony\noffense under the laws of any State, to my knowledge.\nAnd we have to recall that the ACCA contains two\nrequirements for treatment for prior conviction as a\nviolent felony that would support enhanced sentencing\nunder that act. The felony requirement is not a trivial\nrequirement. It was in fact a focus of congressional\ndebate, and it was intended to capture only serious\ncrimes. As a general matter, crimes of ordinary\nnegligence, simple carelessness, or totally blameworthy\nacts don't merit felony punishment.\nAs this Court recognized in Staples, to\nlabel a criminal act as a felony is indeed a serious\nthing and something that legislatures, by long\ntradition, reserved for truly serious acts.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And what is the -- if the\nlegislature made it a crime to send text messages on a\ncell phone while driving, and the punishment were severe\nenough to qualify here? Would that be treated the same\nway?\nMS. KRUGER: Well, it would present a harder\nquestion, Justice Alito, and that's because, for one\nthing, we don't have the uniform judgment of\nlegislatures that helps us know in this case that drunk\ndriving does in all cases present a serious risk of\ninjury. And also because the conduct that's defined by\nthe DUI statute of New Mexico, as well as other States,\nby definition defines conduct that is unsafe. You only\nviolate the statute if you are impaired to such a degree\nthat your faculties and motor skills are such that you\nare unable to drive a car safely. With text messaging\nthere isn't quite that categorical mapping on of the\nrisk to the conduct that's proscribed.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So there is no State where\nspeeding -- even if maybe you hurt somebody or something\n-- there is no State where speeding is under a statute\nthat you could be imprisoned for more than a year?\nMS. KRUGER: To my knowledge, there is no\nState in which speeding itself is a felony offense.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, a felony as defined\nhere. I just wanted to be sure you're focusing -- it's\ndefined here as \"subject to by imprisonment for a term\nexceeding one year.\" Now is --\nMS. KRUGER: To my knowledge, at least,\nJustice Breyer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay, I just want to be\nsure we're on the same wavelength. Fine.\nMS. KRUGER: Reckless driving, on the other\nhand, when it does result in serious physical injury to\nanother, is often punished as a felony. But there is\nobviously a difference between speeding by itself and\nreckless driving.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Kruger, what I don't\nunderstand about this statute as you're interpreting it\nis why you need any of it except the last phrase? Once\nyou give the last phrase, \"involves conduct that\npresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to\nanother,\" all of the rest of it is automatically\nincluded. \"Has as an element the use, attempted use or\nthreatened use of physical force against the person of\nanother\" -- that obviously presents a serious potential\nrisk of physical injury to another. Or is burglary,\narson, extortion, the use of explosives? Congress could\nhave saved itself a lot of trouble by simply erasing all\nthe rest of the statute and simply saying any conduct\nthat presents a serious potential risk of physical\ninjury or not. That can't be what they meant.\nMS. KRUGER: Well, what this Court said\nabout the structure of the statute in Taylor is that\nCongress's purpose was first to identify crimes that do\nhave as an element the use force, but also to capture a\ncategory of crimes that do not have as an element the\nuse force but nevertheless present a potential harm to\nanother human being.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why would Congress\ngo through that trouble, unless they wanted to suggest\nwhat other kind of crimes they need to include by this\nresidual category of \"any conduct\" that presents a\nserious potential risk of physical injury?\nMS. KRUGER: Well, indeed as the Court said\nin Taylor and I think as the Court reiterated in James,\nit included the examples of four enumerated offenses in\nclause 2 to provide examples of the kinds of crimes that\nthey believed to present a serious --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The degree of risk -- the\ndegree of risk, for example?\nMS. KRUGER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So if it doesn't come up to\nthe degree of risk that any of those four would, it\nwould not be included?\nMS. KRUGER: Well, I don't know that the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No.\nMS. KRUGER: -- that the enumerated crimes\nset an absolute four. Congress could have written a\nstatute that said that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then what did it do?\nWhat's it do?\nMS. KRUGER: They do provide examples of the\nkinds of crimes that Congress thought did present a\nserious risk.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How? How? How does it\nlimit the latter part? Is it because they are all\ncrimes that require mens rea, intent? So should we\nlimit it by saying it has to be a -- a conduct that's\nintentional conduct that presents a serious risk?\nMS. KRUGER: Well, I think, as the Court\nsaid in James, all of these crimes are quite different\noffenses that don't share very many characteristics in\ncommon, including incidentally intent to cause harm.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you say it does limit\nit. So tell me how it limits it?\nMS. KRUGER: Well, what it does is it\nprovides a useful benchmark against which to assess the\nrisks that are associated with any other crime.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's nice. Benchmark of\nwhat? Of intent, of degree of risk?\nMS. KRUGER: Of degree -- it's degree and\nkinds of risk. Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So the degree of\nrisk has to be pretty much similar to those four?\nMS. KRUGER: It has to be comparable, which\nis what the Court said in James --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Comparable --\nMS. KRUGER: And in this case we do think\nthat the risks associated with DUI are comparable to the\nrisks --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do we know that?\nI guess this is a question I asked your friend. I mean,\ndegree of risk. I mean what are the odds that we're\ngoing to -- that if there's a burglary, some physical\ninjury might result as opposed to an episode of drunk\ndriving.\nMS. KRUGER: Well, Your Honor --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, I\nguess -- do we really look at how -- what percentage of\ndrunk drivers are involved in accidents as opposed to\nwhat percentage of burglars are involved in violent\nconfrontations?\nMS. KRUGER: No, Your Honor. I don't think\nthat the answer to the question can turn on statistical\ncomparisons of the likelihood that harm will result in\nany given episode of any of these crimes. I think that\nthat is a proposition that the Court underscored in\nJames, when it decided whether attempted burglary\nqualified without reference to hard statistics. And the\nfact of the matter is that hard statistics in most of\nthese crimes are simply unavailable. So to make the\nanswer in any case turn on the availability of\nstatistics would lead to fundamentally arbitrary\nresults.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: One of the anomalies\nabout this, and we start out -- this is an armed career\ncriminal. And you can say, well, burglary -- burglary\nand arson, if you're apprehended, you're the career\ncriminal; you commit these kinds of crimes. Congress\ndoesn't want you to have a gun, or if you do, you're\ngoing to get the book thrown at you. But there doesn't\nseem to be much of a connection. I mean how -- how is\nit going to make the dangerous -- the drunk driver more\nor less dangerous if he happens to have a gun in the\nglove compartment?\nMS. KRUGER: Well, we think that it's clear\nfrom the enumeration of the offenses in clause 2 in the\ndefinition of \"violent felony\" that Congress wasn't\nintending to capture only a set of crimes that are made\nmore dangerous when they're committed with a firearm.\nIt is, in fact, the kind of statute that Congress wrote\nin 18 U.S.C. 942(c), which concerns the use or carrying\nof a firearm during and in relation to a crime of\nviolence. But here what Congress was concerned about\nwas capturing a set of offenders who, by their criminal\nhistory, have demonstrated an inherent disregard for the\nvalue of human life and therefore should not only be\nprohibited from possessing firearms but should face\nparticularly severe sanctions for failure to abide by\nthat prohibition. Our --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then they could have turned\nit just on dangerousness. I'm back to Justice Scalia\nand Justice Ginsburg's question, and I'm simply sort of\nrepeating those in a sense that make it quite specific.\nImagine a universe of crimes. Every member of that\nuniverse we concede has precisely the same degree of\ndanger as arson, explosives, burglary. So there's no\nargument about the risk to human life. It is identical.\nAnd now we write a statute, and the statute's object is\nto take people who are felons in possession of a gun and\nthose persons whom it is particularly bad that they have\na gun are going to go away for 15 years minimum. So\nwhat we're looking are people who are particularly bad\nthat they have a gun. Now go back to our universe, and\nin that universe we have some things on the one hand\nlike arson, but on the other hand -- I have to name a\nfew, environmental crimes committed by negligence or\nrecklessness, where somebody flushed a toxic substance\ndown the drain or -- here's a good one I found -- if you\nare a steamboat captain or an executive of a steamboat\ncompany and you fail through negligence or simple\ninadvertence to stop somebody from not inspecting a\nlifeboat, well, felony or worse. And there are quite a\nfew dozens of these things: Failing to stop at an\ninspection station if you are a trucker. You know?\nThere are quite a few, where what's at issue is\nnegligence, thoughtlessness, and maybe even\nrecklessness, but it seems to have nothing -- and it's\ndangerous -- but has nothing to do with whether, when\nlater on you want a gun, you are a greater risk for\nhaving a gun, you're more likely to pull the trigger,\nyou're more likely to aim it at somebody and shoot him.\nNow, that's I think what we are trying to drive at.\nMS. KRUGER: Well, Your Honor, I think that\nthe initial response to that question is that the\nstatute that Congress wrote unequivocally focuses the\ninquiry on the risk of harm to other human beings.\nCongress could very well have written a statute that\nrequired intent to harm. It could have written a\nstatute that required intentional use of force, as it\ndid in --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, but it didn't mean that\n-- you said it didn't mean that because they could have\nsaid that and nothing else. If that's what they meant,\nthey could have eliminated everything else that they\nsaid. They obviously meant to tie that to the preceding\nportions. And when you tie it to the preceding\nportions, you come up with some limitations of the sort\nthat Justice Breyer was suggesting.\nMS. KRUGER: Well, I think you don't, Your\nHonor, because I think the most obvious way to tie it to\nthe preceding sections is, again, to import a kind of\nuse-of-force requirement such as the 18 U.S.C. 16(b)\nrequirements that would look at the risk of force\nintentionally will be used in the course of committing\nthe offense, and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How much of a\nlimitation is the point Justice Breyer was making? I\nmean, let's say you've got a habitual drunk driver.\nEverybody in town says he always drives drunk. I mean,\nhow would they greet the news: Guess what? He's just\ngot a gun. I mean, that raises the level of risk\nsignificantly, doesn't it?\nMS. KRUGER: Well, indeed, I think that it\ndoes, and I think the facts of this case bear out that\nCongress's concern about possession of firearms by\npeople who have committed crimes of a character that\npresent a serious risk in a serial manner was indeed\nwell-founded.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me what test,\nwhat conclusion, you want me to come to in your\nargument? Drunk driving is within the last clause\nbecause --\nMS. KRUGER: It is because, first of all,\nthe risks of drunk driving are commonly understood.\nThey're supported by the uniform legislative judgment of\nthe 50 States. And also because those risks are\ncomparable in both kind and degree to the kinds of risks\nthat are associated with crimes that Congress\nspecifically enumerated in the statute as meeting the\ntest.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: She says not at all. Your\nfriend on the other side says that it's something like,\nwhat, two and a half percent for burglary and point\nsomething for the chances of hurting somebody if you're\ndriving DUI?\nMS. KRUGER: Well, I think, again, the\nstatistical inquiry, while it can be helpful and\nrelevant in individual cases, is not dispositive. I\nthink if you look at the statistics, the chances of\ninjury resulting from a given arson fire are also well\nbelow 1 percent. What Congress wasn't concerned about\nwas the statistical likelihood of any injury in a\nparticular episode --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I suppose you say\nmost legislatures think this is dangerous. That's\nenough?\nMS. KRUGER: Well, I think that Congress was\nentitled to look at --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not trying to be\ncaptious, but I -- it's difficult to find out what the\nstandard is.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't the significance of\nJustice Breyer's point that each of the listed crimes is\nmore dangerous when a criminal is carrying a gun, but\ndriving drunk isn't made any more dangerous whether or\nnot there's a gun in the car?\nMS. KRUGER: Well, Justice Stevens, it's\ndifficult to see how arson, for example, or explosives\nuse is made more dangerous when the criminal is carrying\na gun. Presumably in those cases the criminal's use --\nweapon of choice is fire or explosives rather than a\ngun. The only risk that would inhere would be the risk\nthat any criminal would pose when apprehended by the\nauthorities, and it's the same risk that a presumably a\ndrunk driver would pose to others when apprehended by an\nofficer who pulls them over.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is a person who\ndeliberately burns down buildings, is a person who if he\nhad a gun might pull the trigger? And I will suggest\nthat's a reasonable inference. I also will give you\nthis: That a person who's so careless as to go drunk\ndriving is a person whose gun might go off carelessly or\nhe might leave it around the house. So I'll give you\nthat one. But my instinct is that Congress, in this\nAct, is not worried about guns going off carelessly\naround the house. They are worried about a person being\nthe kind of person who will point a gun at somebody and\npull the trigger. Now, is there something you can say\nthat disabuses me of that instinct?\nMS. KRUGER: Well, I think one way to start\nto answer that question is by looking specifically at\nwhat Congress likely meant when it referred to \"arson\"\nin the statute. Under 18 U.S.C. 844(i), arson is\ndefined as maliciously damaging property by means of\nfire or explosives. But the way courts have interpreted\nthat language is not to require intent to damage\nproperty in all instances. It also covers situations in\nwhich the fire is set with willful disregard for the\nlikelihood that damage will occur; in other words, in\nsituations in which the fire has occurred and recklessly\nposes harm. And we think that that is the kind of\ninjury that is at issue in this case; that is,\nfundamentally the same kind of risk that DUI poses.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't think this is\njust limited to intentional arson? You think negligent\narson? Wow.\nMS. KRUGER: Well, it's certainly true that\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Negligent extortion,\nnegligent use of explosives? I mean, it's in a list of\nthings that are talking about, you know, intentional\ncrimes that armed career criminals would be likely to\ndo.\nMS. KRUGER: Well, I think that Congress was\nmore than likely aware of the fact that 18 U.S.C. 844\ndid treat arson in this manner, particularly considering\nthat --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think Congress had\nthe slightest idea.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. KRUGER: Well, the definition of -- the\nreach of the Federal arson statute came to encompass use\nof fire in 1982, only shortly before the ACCA was\nenacted. And certainly it's true that most State\nlegislatures have also defined arson offenses to include\nsimilar kinds of intentional setting of fire with\nreckless disregard to the likelihood of damage or injury\nthat would result.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Could you comment on one\nother point that Judge McConnell made in his opinion?\nIs there significance in the title of this statute,\n\"Armed Career Criminal Act.\" Does this statute intend\nto identify career criminals?\nMS. KRUGER: Well, I think it's difficult to\nsee how it would support a limitation to the kinds of\ncrimes that are normally committed as a means of\nlivelihood in that sense of \"career.\" It certainly does\nrefer to career criminals in the sense that they are\nhabitual offenders, that they are recidivists. But\ncertainly not all the enumerated offenses, nor even the\noffenses that are encompassed by the definition that's\ncontained in clause 1 of the statute, are normally\ncommitted as a means of violent --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not so sure. It\nseems to me that the burglary, arson, extortion,\nexplosives involves at least the stereotype of the armed\ncareer criminal that you see in movies and hear about in\norganized crimes testimony and so forth. I don't -- I\ndon't think it's completely far of the mark.\nMS. KRUGER: Well, it is certainly true that\nthe kind of --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Obviously -- obviously\nincomplete.\nMS. KRUGER: Well, it's certainly true that\nthe kinds of crimes that are encompassed by clause 1 of\nthe definition, sort of traditional crimes of violence\nlike murder, assault, rape, are not ordinarily committed\nas a means of livelihood. People rarely make a\nprofession of those types of careers.\nAnd it's also true that ordinarily arson is\nnot committed for insurance fraud, but is committed for\na large number of other purposes that have nothing to do\nwith the profit motive, including covering up evidence\nof other crimes, including simple vandalism.\nSo I think it's implausible to think that\nCongress was really focused here on the kinds of crimes\nthat are normally committed for profit.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What else -- what else\nwould be in this catalogue? You rejected my speeder,\nbut I think you said something about a reckless driver\nmight, habitually reckless driver. What else would fit\nthe description \"conduct that presents a serious\npotential risk of physical injury to another\"?\nMS. KRUGER: We think the category of crimes\nof recklessness that pose an injury, reckless disregard\nof the risk of injury to others, would qualify because\nin those cases juries have necessarily found that there\nwas objectively a serious risk and that failures to\nappreciate that risk and to act accordingly constitutes\na gross deviation from the ordinary standard of care\nthat a reasonable person would exercise.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'd like to know\nspecifically. You said reckless driving; and what else?\nMS. KRUGER: Reckless driving that results\nin serious bodily injury or death to another, which is a\nfelony under the laws of many States, would qualify.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That has the potential of\ndoing that, not --\nMS. KRUGER: Yes, but reckless driving\nsimple is ordinarily, not punishable as a felony under\nthe traffic laws. We think, similarly, reckless\nhomicide would qualify.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But wouldn't that come in\nin the first, the violent crime, the first part?\nMS. KRUGER: Well, presumably it wouldn't,\nbecause by definition a reckless homicide does not\ninvolve the intentional use of force, the threatened use\nof force, or attempted use of force. And the definition\nrelates solely to the killing of another, whether or not\nby intentional use of force, in situations that\ndisregard the great dangerousness to human life and\nthose actions.\nThe other things that would qualify would be\ncases like DUI, where recklessness need not be proved as\nsuch, but that are underscored by legislative\ndeterminations that the conduct that is proscribed is by\ndefinition reckless, by definition poses a serious risk\nthat a person should appreciate and should accordingly\nconform their conduct to a different standard.\nPetitioner's argument suffers from the\nfundamental flaw that it describes a statute that\nCongress didn't write. Congress did indeed consider\nincorporating the definition of \"crime of violence\" that\nis set forth at 18 U.S.C. 16 when it redrafted the\nstatute in 1986 and it decided against it, instead\nmaking the inquiry turn on the potential for risk to\nhuman life as opposed to the potential that -- the risk\nthat force would be used or on the intentional use of\nforce.\nWe think that that decision is one that\nneeds to be given effect in interpreting the statute.\nAs this Court recognized in Leocal, the risk of\nintentional use of force is simply not the same thing\nthat a risk of -- the risk that an accident will occur\nthat will cause serious injury to another.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask about something\nin your brief on page 37? You said: \"Congress settled\non this language because it had two other proposals, one\nthat it considered too narrow and one that it considered\nas potentially too broad.\" And the one that it\nconsidered potentially too broad is \"any felony that by\nits nature involves a substantial risk that physical\nforce against a person or property of another may be\nused in the course of committing an offense is the\" --\nthis is on page 37 of your brief.\nMS. KRUGER: Yes, Your Honor. That is the\ndefinition of \"crime of violence\" that's contained at 18\nU.S.C. 16. And it is, indeed, unquestionably broader\nthan the definition of \"violent felony\" at\n924(e)(2)(D)(ii) in at least two respects. One is that\nit would cover misdemeanors involving use of force as\nwell as felonies. And the second is that it would cover\ncrimes that involve a risk that force would be used\nagainst property, rather than focusing exclusively on\nthe risk of harm to a human being, as the definition of\n\"violent felony\" in the ACCA does.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It would, in the case of\ndrunk driving - though, it seems this would be a better\ncase for the Petitioner if we were operating under this\nstatute.\nMS. KRUGER: Well, indeed, I think that that\nis the thrust of the court's decision --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's narrower in that\nsense as applied to this case.\nMS. KRUGER: That's correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: May I ask you this\nquestion? If the government were not to prevail in the\nfirst case, Rodriguez, should we remand in this case,\nbecause -- because then he -- the fourth felony would\nhave been improperly found if we rule against the\ngovernment in Rodriguez?\nMS. KRUGER: Well, if the Court decided to\nreach that issue in this case, even though the issue was\nnot pressed or passed on in the court of appeals and\nwasn't raised in the cert petition, we do think the\nCourt's analysis of the issue in that case applies\nequally to its analysis of the issue of whether or not\nthe felony prong of the definition of \"violent felony\"\nis applicable in this case.\nSo were the Court to decide that the\napplicable maximum term of imprisonment that applies to\na recidivist is the term of imprisonment that would\napply to a hypothetical first-time offender, then that\ndecision would control in this case as well. And the\nCourt should dispose of this case accordingly.\nBut it bears noting that that would not\ndispose of this question entirely, because there are, of\ncourse, other reasons why States treat drunk driving\noffenses as felony offenses, particularly in situations\nin which they result in serious bodily harm or death to\nanother, as Your Honor previously noted.\nThe issue in this case comes down to the\ninterpretation of the statute that Congress wrote, not a\nhypothetical statute that Congress could have written.\nAnd that statute identifies one criterion for\ndetermining whether or not a felony offense qualifies as\na violent felony under the ACCA, and that is its\npotential for harming other human beings.\nDrunk driving is commonly understood to\npresent a serious potential risks of injury. The\npotential risks of injury are the only reason why it's a\ncrime under the laws of 50 States. And the risks\nassociated with drunk driving are comparable in both\nkind and degree to the risks associated with arson and\nexplosives use, two crimes that Congress specifically\nidentified in the statute as satisfying its definition.\nFor that reason, we think that the court of\nappeals correctly determined that Mr. Begay was\nsentenced properly under the Armed Career Criminal Act\nand would urge the Court to affirm its determination.\nIf there are no further questions, thank\nyou.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.\nKruger.\nMs. Katze, you have four minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARGARET A. KATZE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. KATZE: The problem with the\nGovernment's interpretation is that it offers no\nlimiting principle whatsoever. It's merely open to say\nabsolutely any offense that would present a serious\npotential risk of injury to another would fall within\nthe statute. And that clearly does not take Congress's\nintent to heart.\nAnd there has to be some other limiting\nprinciple, something more than just the words in the\nresidual clause, especially when we are giving every\nword in the statute meaning. We suggest that our test\nof analyzing those four enumerated crimes which were\nintentionally put there by Congress, to look at the\nattributes of those four crimes. That they are active,\nviolent property crimes more typical of crimes committed\nby career offenders, more dangerous when committed with\na gun --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why wouldn't drunk driving\nbe property crime? Doesn't it cause an enormous amount\nof property damage?\nMS. KATZE: Under a categorical analysis,\nthere is no element that has anything to do with\nproperty whatsoever in DWI, which brings me to my next\npoint that recidivism is not an element of DWI in New\nMexico.\nThe elements to commit DWI in the first\noffense are exactly the same as the fourth offense.\nThere is no difference. And there is -- certainly,\nCongress, intended that there would be a distinction\nbetween violent, intentional felonies and accidental or,\nat worst, negligent crimes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Extortion doesn't\ninvolve property as an element.\nMS. KATZE: I believe it does. It's trying\nto get something of value from another person. That\nthing of value is property.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Something of value\n-- something of value could be, you know, a confession\nin a related case or something. It doesn't necessarily\nhave to be property.\nMS. KATZE: In the ordinary case, it's\nproperty even if we think of it as reputation; property\nin the sense of the common law, life, liberty, and\nproperty; that that includes more than just physical\nproperty, I think. In addition, this Court has said\nthat those four offenses are --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't understand\nthat. Yes. Life, liberty, and property include more\nthan property, but --\nMS. KATZE: \"Property\" includes more than\ntangible, physical property. Reputation is considered\nproperty under that definition. Merely stating that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought you said that\nyou -- you look at the generality of cases. In most\nextortion cases what they want is money.\nMS. KATZE: That is correct, and money is\nproperty. And that is exactly what -- in addition to\nthe fact that this Court said in Taylor that those four\noffenses are property offenses. And, again, in James\nthis Court again referred to those four offenses as --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if you look at the\ngenerality of drunk-driving offenses, those that result\nin physical injury almost always involve, or in the\ngreat majority of cases involve, property damage, too;\ndon't they?\nMS. KATZE: But that's not an element of the\ncrime. We can --\nJUSTICE ALITO: It's not an element of some\nof these other crimes, either. Is it an element in\nburglary? Is there a property element in burglary?\nMS. KATZE: Yes, Your Honor. There is a\nbreaking and entering into a building, in some type or\nrespect a property.\nJUSTICE ALITO: That's an entering. An\nunlawful entering --\nMS. KATZE: Right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: That's a property element?\nMS. KATZE: Yes, sir.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about --\nMS. KATZE: You have to enter a property.\nIt's this something -- property --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we know that\nattempted burglary is covered, and you don't have to\nenter the house in an attempted burglary.\nMS. KATZE: I think that's exactly the\nsituation when there are analogous crimes. It's clear\nto see that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. Well, you are\nsaying this is an analogous crime to the four that are\nlisted, or it is not an analogous crime to the four that\nare listed?\nMS. KATZE: That's correct, but this Court\nhas said that the four offenses that were enumerated by\nCongress are, in fact, property crimes. This Court has\nsaid that in Taylor and again referred to those four\ncrimes as property crimes in James.\nBut even if this Court doesn't believe they\nare property crimes, the bottom line is DWI is so far\nafield of the four enumerated crimes, the attributes\nthat they had, at the very least the intent to do crime,\nthat it's clearly outside the scope of what Congress\ncould ever have intended.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.\n"
