        "content": "(10:48 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext No. 02-1689, Grupo Dataflux v. Atlas Global Group.\nMr. Boyce.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM J. BOYCE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BOYCE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThe central question here is whether Atlas'\npost-filing change in citizenship should be allowed to\ncreate retroactive diversity jurisdiction in this case.\nTo justify rewriting the longstanding time of\nfiling rule, Atlas relies on the fact that this case was\ntried to verdict before the jurisdictional issue was\nidentified and raised in the district court.\nQUESTION: May I ask you with respect to that?\nWhen you found out that you had this fundamental\njurisdictional objection, when did you know that the\npartnership included partners not only Texas entities but\ntwo Mexican citizens? When did you find that out?\nMR. BOYCE: There are two answers to your\nquestion, Justice Ginsburg. In terms of when we became\naware of the issue, that was after verdict, and that's\nreflected in the affidavit which appears in the record at\nvolume I, page 1887.\nIn terms of the question of was there evidence\nin the record that could have been pieced together to\nidentify this issue earlier, the answer to that question\nis yes. If -- if -- it probably could have been\nidentified earlier, should have been identified earlier,\nbut it was not.\nQUESTION: There's a curious thing about what\nDataflux did. Dataflux at one point moved to add the\nMexicans as individuals as counterdefendants.\nMR. BOYCE: Correct.\nQUESTION: And why would it do that if they were\nmembers of the partnership. If -- if it was sure that\nthey were members of the partnership, then you wouldn't\nneed to make them defendants as individuals because\npartners have individual liability.\nMR. BOYCE: Two answers to that -- that\nquestion, Your Honor. First, under the Texas Revised\nLimited Partnership Act, the -- the partnership can sue -\nthe limited partnership can sue on its own without the\nparticipation of the limited partners. In terms of all of\nthe counterclaims against Llamosa and Robles, again under\nthe Texas statute, we can choose to sue the partnership\nitself or we can sue individual limited partners. In this\ncircumstance, our counterclaim against them was predicated\nnot on their status as limited partners, but rather on the\nfact that Mr. Llamosa and Mr. Robles made affirmative\nmisrepresentations, was our position, directly to us to\ninduce us to enter the contract that led to the -- the\nlawsuit. So -\nQUESTION: But at that stage, you called them\nemployees or former employees. So it seems that the -\nthat you had some inkling.\nMR. BOYCE: There -- there was some confusion\nearly on in terms of what exactly their status was and we,\nDataflux, did not thoroughly explore that issue early on.\nAnd -- and that should have been done earlier.\nBut I would also note that the bottom line here\nis that -- is that Atlas, the party with unique knowledge\nof the exact circumstances of its partnership at the time\nof filing, is the party here who filed the case in Federal\ncourt at a time when there was not diversity jurisdiction.\nThere certainly could have been more that we should have\ndone to explore the issue earlier.\nQUESTION: Well, you've admitted it. You -- you\njust admitted it flat out in your answer.\nMR. BOYCE: Yes, Your Honor. There were\nadmissions that jurisdiction existed, but I would hasten\nto add that pursuant to the longstanding rule that\njurisdiction cannot be stipulated to, agreed to, created\nby estoppel or waiver, that those statements are not\neffective to create jurisdiction if it does not exist at\nthe outset. And -- and I would emphasize the language\nthat was relied on most recently in this Court's decision\nin Kontrick from January in which the Court noted that a\ncourt's subject matter jurisdiction cannot be expanded to\naccount for the parties' conduct during litigation. And I\nthink that principle addresses that.\nIs there more that could have been done to\nexplore this earlier -- this issue earlier and bring it\nup? The answer to that question is yes, but I don't think\nthat that circumstance undermines the fundamental rule\nhere, which is that as of the time of filing, there was\nnot a diversity present, and because of that -\nQUESTION: Well, there was in the constitutional\nsense. There wasn't under the statute. There was\ndiversity, but not complete diversity.\nMR. BOYCE: I think the -- there is some room to\ndiscuss that, Justice Ginsburg, in light of the dissent's\ncontention that there was, in fact, no diversity where you\nhave one litigant here, one plaintiff, one defendant, and\nboth are citizens of Mexico at that time. It may be a\nsituation where -\nQUESTION: But that's not what -- well, correct\nme if I'm wrong. I thought that Atlas is a partnership.\nMR. BOYCE: That is correct.\nQUESTION: And that it -- and that there are\nthree players involved -- five. Two are Mexican and three\nare Texan.\nMR. BOYCE: There -- there -\nQUESTION: So then you would have on one side\nTexan and Mexican and the other side Texan. If you drop\nout the Mexicans, then you're left, from the plaintiff's\nside -- you're left with a complete diversity case.\nMR. BOYCE: Atlas is one entity with multiple\ncitizenships, and -- and if -- if the question suggests\nthat there was some kind of a -- a dismissal mechanism\navailable to make the -- the Mexican citizenship go away,\nI don't believe that that is available under the facts of\nthis case because it's -- it -- there were -\nQUESTION: But it's what happened. They did go\naway for a reason unrelated to this lawsuit.\nMR. BOYCE: Pursuant to Atlas' decision to\nchange the constitution of its partnership after the time\nof filing and before the case was submitted to the -- to\nthe jury. That is correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Yes, long before the case was tried.\nMR. BOYCE: Before the -- approximate -\nQUESTION: Well, so when the case -- when this\ncase was tried, there was complete diversity.\nMR. BOYCE: That is correct. Approximately 6\nweeks prior to trial, the change in Atlas' composition\nbecame effective so that at that point there would -\nthere is complete diversity if that post-filing change is\ngiven effect.\nAnd I would submit to the Court that under the\nlongstanding rule, going back as far as 1824 in Mollan v.\nTorrance, reflected in the 1891 decision in Anderson v.\nWatt, that the longstanding rule has been, and should\ncontinue to be in this case, that post changes -\nQUESTION: I thought in Mollan v. Torrance\nexactly what I described happened. Chief Justice Marshall\nsaid you've got one spoiler on the plaintiffs' side. Take\nit out and you'll have complete diversity.\nMR. BOYCE: I think that the statement in\nMollan, as reflected in Conolly and then applied in\nAnderson v. Watt, Your Honor, is that if the change in\ncircumstances is the result of the addition or subtraction\nof a party, that's one circumstance, but here we have\nsomething entirely different, which is a change in\ncitizenship. It would be the same as if a plaintiff had\nlived in one State and then moved to another State.\nQUESTION: No, it's not the same. It isn't the\nsame because a partnership is a citizen of every State in\nwhich a partner resides. Isn't that correct?\nMR. BOYCE: Correct, under Carden.\nQUESTION: So you have, just as if you'd have\nfive individuals -- that's what they are in fact -- in\neffect, because they're jointly and severally liable. So\nyou have, as I said before, three Texan and two Mexicans.\nYou don't have one person that can say, ah, I'm going to\ndefeat diversity by moving where I live, or I'm going to\ncreate diversity. You -- none of these people's\ncitizenships has ever changed. That's quite different\nfrom somebody saying, I want to change my citizenship.\nMR. BOYCE: I would respectfully disagree, Your\nHonor, because I think Atlas' citizenship changed by\nvirtue of changing the composition of its partnership, and\nthat is on all fours the same circumstance as if a -- a\nlitigant had lived in one State and then tried to move to\nanother State in an effort to create retroactive diversity\njurisdiction.\nQUESTION: But it didn't leave Texas behind.\nTexas was always there. The Mexican partners left. So I\njust don't see that it's anything like -- I mean, this -\nas I said before, there's the same five people. Two drop\nout and so you've got three Texans, and there were always\nthree Texans. They didn't move to Texas. They were there\nfrom the start.\nMR. BOYCE: The -- the function of Atlas\nchanging its citizenship after the time of filing and\nthereafter claiming -- this is Atlas' argument -- that\nthat cures our jurisdictional defect, I would submit to\nthe Court, is the same thing as a citizen moving from one\nState to the other because, in effect, what Atlas is\nsaying, by relying on that argument, is we moved out of -\nmove out of Mexico and -- and resided exclusively in Texas\nas of the time of suit. That is the whole basis for\nAtlas' argument as to why the jurisdictional defect,\naccording to Atlas, was cured as of the time of trial.\nAnd I think that's where the -- the conflict comes in with\nthe change of -\nQUESTION: If Atlas had been a corporation\nincorporated in Texas, then there would have been complete\ndiversity. Right?\nMR. BOYCE: I'm -- I didn't -\nQUESTION: If Atlas -- instead of being a\npartnership composed of five members, it had organized as\na corporation, as a Texas corporation.\nMR. BOYCE: Then it would be under the -- the\ndifferent provision of 1332. It would be a citizen of its\nplace of incorporation and its principal place of\nbusiness, and that would not be the issue that -- that we\nhave here today.\nQUESTION: But would -- would -- my question is\nwouldn't the -- if these -- if this entity had been\norganized as a corporation, there would have been complete\ndiversity.\nMR. BOYCE: There -- there -- yes, there would\nnot be an issue here because of a different operation of\n1332 as applied to corporations, but the point of Carden\nwas, as -- as I read the case, is that limited\npartnerships are going to be treated differently.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. BOYCE: There is no analog from corporate -\nQUESTION: But I don't want to belabor this any\nfurther, but you do see the difference between an\nindividual moving from New York to New Jersey, say, and a\n-- a partnership with five partners, all of whom remain\nwhere they are. They don't move anyplace else. Those\npartners, those live human beings, stay exactly what they\nwere. Their citizenship doesn't change.\nMR. BOYCE: I understand the -- the point, and\nour position is that when Atlas contends that it has cured\nthe jurisdictional defect by changing the composition of\nits partnership, that is effectively the same as the\nlitigant moving from New Jersey to New York and claiming I\nhave -- I have fixed the jurisdictional problem because my\ncitizenship has changed. It comes down to a change in\ncitizenship, and I think that's what implicates the\nlongstanding rule that the Court has enforced repeatedly.\nQUESTION: Mr. Boyce, can I ask you a question\nabout how far your position extends? You say that it\nwasn't too late to -- to raise the jurisdictional issue\nwhen you did. Supposing there had been a trial and\ninstead of your losing, you had won, and then you knew\nabout the jurisdictional defect, and then you waited to\nsee what would happen on appeal. Then you lost on appeal.\nAnd then you decided to raise the jurisdictional defect.\nWould you say that was -- they would then be required to\ndismiss?\nMR. BOYCE: Yes, Your Honor. I think the -\nQUESTION: All right. Suppose then it was\naffirmed and then you decided you didn't realize it until\nafter the judgment had been entered and become final and\nso forth, and then a year later you find out about it.\nCould you raise it then?\nMR. BOYCE: I don't think it would be the proper\nsubject of a collateral attack after the initial case in\nwhich it has been adjudicated is over with. But in terms\nof where along the line within that case can it be raised,\nour position is it can be raised, indeed, must be\nraised -\nQUESTION: So you say it can always be raised on\ndirect -- while -- until final judgment is entered, but it\ncan never be raised on collateral attack.\nMR. BOYCE: That is my understanding. And -\nand I think the most closely analogous case to the\nhypothetical that -- that you're putting forth would be\nthe Capron v. Noorden case from 1804. It was discussed in\n-- in this Court's recent decision in Kontrick where in\nthat case the plaintiff who had filed the case in Federal\ncourt lost at trial and then went up on appeal to this\nCourt. The plaintiff who filed the case at that late\nstage identified the lack of jurisdiction, and then the\nCourt said there is no jurisdiction here. If there's no\njurisdiction, there's no jurisdiction and the -- the\ntiming of the conduct of it is not germane to that inquiry\nbecause it's not something that can be created by the\nparties' litigation conduct -\nQUESTION: We have to punish you some other way,\nmaybe fine you or make you pay costs for the other side,\nbut we cannot punish you for that by expanding our own\njurisdiction. That's your point.\nMR. BOYCE: That -- that's our point.\nQUESTION: Capron against Noorden was one party\non one side, one party on the other. It wasn't a case\nwhere at the time of the trial there was complete\ndiversity.\nI frankly have a hard time distinguishing this\ncase from Caterpillar which started out non-diverse but\nbefore trial, became diverse.\nMR. BOYCE: I -- I would like to address the\ncircumstances under which this case is distinguishable\nfrom Caterpillar because that obviously is -- is what\nAtlas relies very heavily on in its briefing.\nAnd I think there are a number of important\ndistinctions here, the first and foremost being that the\ncitizenship of the parties to the final judgment in\nCaterpillar did not change. That was a circumstance where\nthe -- the diversity-spoiling litigant was dismissed\npursuant to rule 21. That is not our circumstance here.\nQUESTION: So if the -- this would be the same\nif the -- Atlas had come to the court and said, now,\ncourt, I want you to dismiss the two Mexicans because\nthey're no longer part of the corporation, and gotten an\norder to -- to do that.\nMR. BOYCE: That would be a different\ncircumstance. I -- I hasten to add that in terms of Atlas\nsuing Dataflux, Mr. Llamosa and Mr. Robles were not\nplaintiffs. Atlas itself was the plaintiff, and the\nproblem arises because of the -- the Mexican citizenship\nof Mr. Llamosa and Robles is attributed to Atlas.\nBut if -- if a different circumstance is -- is\nhypothesized where there's a dismissal, then I think that\nbrings rule 21 into play. As -- as the Court discussed in\n-- in the Newman-Green decision, there is a source of\nauthority for addressing that circumstance under rule 21.\nHere we have a situation where this is not a\nremoval case, this is not a dismissal case, and the\nquestion arises -\nQUESTION: My question was could they have\ndismissed and -- and as far as removal, I perhaps don't\nremember Caterpillar that well, but of course, it arose\nout of a removal. That's how it happened. But the Court\ndidn't make the removal dispositive.\nMR. BOYCE: Your Honor, I -- I would not presume\nto -- to say what the -- the Court meant to do, but I\nwould highlight the discussion in the subsequent Lexecon\ncase where the point, I think, was made that indeed\nCaterpillar was grounded on the removal statute and\nspecifically section 1441, the issue being in Caterpillar\nthat the case was not fit for Federal adjudication at the\ntime of removal and that that was the error. There was an\nuntimely compliance with -\nQUESTION: Yes. It certainly was a 1441, and\nthe opinion certainly alerts district judges that when a\ncase comes over from the State court, maybe you ought to\nlook at it to make sure that there is Federal\njurisdiction. But I didn't think that there was anything\npeculiar about 1441 and the obligation of a judge to look\ninto jurisdiction. I don't know why the same thing\nwouldn't apply to 1332.\nMR. BOYCE: I would submit, Your Honor, that\nthere are different -- there's a different statutory\noverlay that -- that was being addressed in Caterpillar,\nthe overlay of the removal statutes. Here we're under a\ncircumstance where this -- this is not a removal case.\nTherefore, we are under section 1332 alone, and the -- the\nlongstanding rule that the citizenship is going to be\nmeasured as of the time of filing. At -- at this stage\nwhere the rule has been followed for some 180 years, I\nbelieve that similar to a complete diversity requirement,\nit is now part and parcel of section 1332. So there --\nthere's no removal overlay to be addressed.\nAnd -- and there's an additional circumstance\nhere that I think in significant part, Caterpillar\noperates to protect a defendant's right to removal. The\n-- the removal in that case -- the removal right was\nsubject to being lost because of the timing of the\ndismissal of the non-diverse party. There was a -- a\nproblem for Caterpillar in bumping up against the 1-year\ntime limit. In other words, Caterpillar operates to\nprotect a -- a right to invoke the Federal forum.\nHere, by definition -\nQUESTION: Well, I don't -- I don't follow that\nbecause it was wrongfully removed by the defendant, had no\nright to be in the Federal forum when he got there, and -\nand the poor plaintiff who wanted to be in the State court\ngot stuck with losing a Federal court case. So it wasn't\nprotecting the defendant right to remove. The defendant\nhad no right to remove. It wasn't a proper Federal case\nuntil -- who was it -- one of the parties got dropped out.\nMR. BOYCE: I -- I would go back to Lexecon's\ndescription of Caterpillar which is that there was an -\nQUESTION: Why don't you go back to\nCaterpillar's description of Caterpillar?\nMR. BOYCE: Yes, Your Honor. I -- I think at -\nat bottom Caterpillar cannot be divorced from the removal\ncontext in which it arose. And it -- it was -- it was -\nQUESTION: Do you rely on a distinction between\na defendant's right to a Federal forum and the plaintiff's\nto a Federal forum? It seems to me they're exactly the\nsame. At the time it's invoked, it's -- there's no\nFederal jurisdiction.\nMR. BOYCE: I think that under certain\ncircumstances Congress has made a distinction between a\ndefendant's right to invoke a Federal forum and a\nplaintiff's right to invoke a Federal forum.\nQUESTION: Then are you -- are you saying this\nis -- is the rule you rely on a constitutional rule or a\nstatutory rule?\nMR. BOYCE: It is a -- primarily a statutory\nrule operating -\nQUESTION: In other words, you don't say the\nConstitution would prohibit us from affirming.\nMR. BOYCE: I -- I need to qualify my answer,\nJustice Stevens, because under some circumstances there\nmay be Article III implications here because if -- if it's\na circumstance where you have just an issue of whether or\nnot there's complete diversity, then that's a statutory\nissue. But if -- if retroactive diversity is being\nrecognized so as to allow a case to remain in Federal\ncourt for some 2 or 3 years, as happened in this\nsituation, where there isn't even Article III diversity\nrequirement -- let's say you have an alien versus an alien\nwith no citizen present. That does have Article III\nimplications.\nQUESTION: So there's a -- there's no subject\njurisdiction as a matter of constitutional law, just no\nsubject matter jurisdiction. But nevertheless, you say\nthere could be no -- no collateral attack on the judgment.\nI'm not sure that I understand the -- why there couldn't\nbe a collateral attack if you're dead right on this.\nMR. BOYCE: I think that -- and I -- I cannot\ncite the case that -- that I'm relying on for that, but in\nthe -- in the course of reviewing, I -- I believe that I\nsaw the -- the statement regarding collateral attack. But\nI --\nQUESTION: You are correct in that respect.\nQUESTION: I think you're right, but I'm just\nwondering why.\nQUESTION: If there -- if there was -- if there\nwas an adjudication of the jurisdiction in the direct\ncase, that's binding on the parties when the thing has\nbecome final, just as well as the merits.\nMR. BOYCE: But I -- I think maybe the -- the\nprimary focus here in terms of the applicability of the\ntime of filing rule is one that -- that turns on the -\nthe purposes of the time of filing rule. These are\nsummarized in -- in the -\nQUESTION: May I take you back a little way?\nIt is unconstitutional because incomplete diversity is\nfine. Minimal diversity is fine under the Constitution.\nThe statute, 1332, has always been interpreted to require\ncomplete diversity.\nMR. BOYCE: Correct.\nQUESTION: When Marshall first mentions that you\ncan't oust jurisdiction by something that happens after,\nhe doesn't talk about the statute. The cases that you are\n-- are discussing, out of which the timely filing rule\narises -- it's a kind of a common law that he's spreading\nout. He doesn't cite the -- the jurisdictional statute\nfor that.\nMR. BOYCE: I -- I have to agree that -- that\nboth Conolly v. Taylor and Mollan v. Torrance do not\nspecifically anchor it in the statute, and to -- to some\nextent, I would -- I would have to acknowledge that\nthey're somewhat cryptic. But I think the -- the clearest\nstatutory anchor as the basis of this rule comes from\nAnderson v. Watt which, applying Mollan and applying\nConolly, does specifically anchor it in the 1875 iteration\nof the diversity statute in the course of its discussion.\nAnd -- and I think that's the clearest indication that\nthis is indeed -\nQUESTION: What was the date of Anderson? 1891?\nMR. BOYCE: 1891. Correct.\nAnd the point that we would emphasize here, Your\nHonor, is that the longstanding interpretation, similar to\ncomplete diversity as discussed in the Owen Equipment v.\nKroger case, is now a part and parcel of section 1332 and\nits predecessors.\nAnd -- and so it's not a situation merely that\nthe Fifth Circuit is -- is stepping into some area where\nthe Court did not expressly address it in Caterpillar. I\nthink the Fifth Circuit has, in fact, gone beyond that by\ncreating this new rule because it's a circumstance where\nit is going contrary to the longstanding interpretation\nand understanding of 1332.\nQUESTION: As I understand the bottom line of\nwhat the situation would be, there was a trial between\ntotally diverse parties. You -- you say that has to be\nundone. There's no question now that there's complete\ndiversity between these same two parties. So this isn't a\ncase where there's any federalism interest. This wouldn't\ngo back to the State court. This is a proper suit for\nAtlas to bring in Federal court, and so you'd have the\nsame court, the same parties going over exactly the same\ncase, which does seem a terrible waste.\nMR. BOYCE: I -- I would focus on one portion of\nYour Honor's question, which is in terms of an assumption\nthat this case automatically would go back to Federal\ncourt. That may well happen, but we don't know -\nQUESTION: No, no. It would be up to Atlas, but\nAtlas at this point, being totally diverse from Dataflux,\ncould walk in -- the day that Atlas is thrown out, it can\ncome in the revolving door and say, here's a fresh\ncomplaint. Let's start all over again.\nMR. BOYCE: I think an underlying assumption of\nthat question is that Atlas has not yet again changed its\n-- its partnership, and I do not know the answer to that\nquestion.\nQUESTION: May -- may I ask you is there another\nimpediment that you do know about like the statute of\nlimitations?\nMR. BOYCE: There will be an issue -- the answer\nto your question is that -- that whether or not\nlimitations would prevent -- present an obstacle to Atlas\nis going to be determined under the Texas savings statute\nand/or the New York savings statute. There was a choice\nof law dispute in the case.\nQUESTION: Well, I assumed -- I assumed you\nlooked into this.\nMR. BOYCE: And there is a -- a savings statute,\nassuming Texas law applies, that would allow Atlas to\nrefile suit.\nOne point that I would note -- and -- and this\nis outside the scope of the record, but I -- I would put\nit before the Court to completely answer the question -\nis that Atlas already has refiled once within 10 days of\nthe initial dismissal. It refiled in Federal court and\nthen subsequently dismissed the second Federal court\nlawsuit. There may be an issue under the savings statute\nin terms of how many times do you get to refile, and -\nand I don't know the answer to that. We haven't looked at\nthat specifically. But there is a savings statute\navailable, and -- and I presume Atlas would invoke it.\nQUESTION: At what point did they file and\nrefile? Because the court of appeals held in their favor.\nMR. BOYCE: They filed after the trial court\ndismissal and before the Fifth Circuit held in their\nfavor, and I believe that the -- the second suit was filed\nin December of 2000 and dismissed in approximately October\nof 2001. I think that's the chronology of it.\nQUESTION: Dismissed after they won on appeal or\nbefore?\nMR. BOYCE: I think it was before the -- the\nFifth Circuit ruled in the case.\nBut the -- the point that I would emphasize is\nthat the -- the purposes of the time of filing rule\ntranscend any individual case -\nQUESTION: What is it? What is it? I mean,\nimagine the worst case. A Lithuanian sues a citizen of\nTaiwan in New York on July 1st. On July 2nd, they both\nbecome citizens. Well, what I'm going to ask is what's\nthe worst -- I don't see a constitutional problem. They\ndidn't notice till after judgment.\nWhat's the worst thing that could happen if we\nwere to say, as a matter of policy, if you like, Federal\npolicy, there's an exception to the time of filing rule -\nwhen nobody notices until after the judgment is entered -\nto prevent manipulation? What's the worst thing that\nwould happen?\nMR. BOYCE: Justice Breyer, the worst thing that\ncan happen is uncertainty in what was formerly a bright\nline rule in terms of litigants being able to determine\nwith some certainty whether or not they belong in Federal\ncourt.\nAnd I would also focus on this point, which is I\n-- I think the one question that the Fifth Circuit and\nAtlas do not answer is what is the source of authority for\na Federal court to recognize this retroactive jurisdiction\nhere? By process of elimination, we know what it is not.\nIt is not section 1653, because that addresses only\ndefective allegations, not defective facts. It is not\nsection 1441 or 1446 because this is not a removal case,\nand it's not rule 21. So the -- the bottom line inquiry\nthen is what is the source of this authority and -- and I\ndon't think the authority is there, and in fact this is\ncontrary to section 1332.\nAnd with that, I would reserve the balance of my\ntime.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Boyce.\nMr. Greenberg, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROGER B. GREENBERG\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. GREENBERG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nRespondent asks that this Court affirm the Fifth\nCircuit's judgment and hold that, based on this Court's\nprecedent, the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction\nat the time of trial because the lack of complete\ndiversity between the parties was cured before trial.\nThis Court unanimously held in Caterpillar that\nif the jurisdictional defect is cured before trial and\nthen a case is tried on the merits and the court has\nArticle III -- it's an Article III court, it has subject\nmatter jurisdiction, that it has the judicial power to -\nto preside over -\nQUESTION: Yes, but Caterpillar involved a -- a\nsituation in which the jurisdictional defect was cured by\na change in which parties were in the case. That has not\noccurred here.\nMR. GREENBERG: That's correct.\nQUESTION: The party is the same, and that makes\nit a different case. You can't possibly say we've decided\nthis.\nMR. GREENBERG: With all due respect, Justice\nScalia, our position is that Caterpillar and the thread\nthrough Caterpillar of Newman-Green and Grubbs points out\nthat that is not an issue that was determinative of the\ndecision. The Court specified unanimously in Caterpillar\nthat once diversity is cured -- it didn't say has to be\ncured a certain way. It didn't say has to be cured by a\ndispensable party leaving, et cetera. It said simply once\na case has been tried and diversity obtained at the time\nof trial, that the -- that -\nQUESTION: Well, Caterpillar certainly is not a\nwhite horse case for you. Otherwise, there wouldn't be a\nconflict in the circuits the way there is. Certainly\nthere are significant similarities but there are\ndifferences too.\nMR. GREENBERG: Respectfully, Chief Justice\nRehnquist, our position is that the facts in this case are\nmuch narrower than Caterpillar. We fall under the\numbrella of Caterpillar. Here we did not have, for\nexample, as in Caterpillar a mistaken challenge at the\ninception of the case that the Court decided in\nCaterpillar to overlook when it did not remand the case.\nThere is no issue of that ilk.\nQUESTION: But there was something that you\noverlooked or whoever was representing Atlas.\nWhen did Atlas first become aware that the\ncitizenship of each partner counts for diversity? I mean,\nthis was set up as a Texas business, but in a partnership,\nunlike a corporation, each partner's citizenship counts\nequally. And when did you first become aware of that\nrule?\nMR. GREENBERG: Justice Ginsburg, I don't know\nif the record reflects that issue, but answering your\nquestion, I don't think either party in the record\nadverted to that issue until the motion to dismiss was\nfiled by Grupo Dataflux. Therefore, the case continued on\nfrom filing through trial to verdict without either party\nadverting to the fact that there may have been a\njurisdictional problem until after -\nQUESTION: Is it your understanding that the -\nthat the attorney for Atlas in this case would have the\nobligation to advise the court of the problem the moment\nit was discovered? Does the attorney have an ethical duty\nto advise that the original pleading was -- was misleading\nas -- as soon as the attorney finds out that this problem\nexisted?\nMR. GREENBERG: Justice Kennedy, I believe so,\nyes. And I -- and I believe that the parties on either\nside, as well as the court I might add, if the court\nlearned of or had an issue would have brought it up, but I\nthink certainly counsel had an ethical duty to do so.\nThe -- the issue before you is whether this case\ncreates a new or different exception to the rule of time\nof filing, and we posit it does not because Caterpillar,\ncontrary to -- to the position of the petitioner -\nCaterpillar stands for the propositions, as I have stated,\nwhich are overwhelming according to the court. Finality\nin that opinion, costs of litigation, litigants waiting in\nline. That is an exception to the rule of the time of\nfiling. This case falls within much narrower -- because\nthe Fifth Circuit said, if it's cured before trial and not\nraised till after trial, then that's the test. That's a\nmuch narrower test.\nQUESTION: What -- what's the latest time it can\nbe raised in the view of the Fifth Circuit?\nMR. GREENBERG: In the -- in the view of the\nFifth Circuit, raised before trial -- cured before trial,\nbut not raised -- but raised after is what the court's\ntest was.\nQUESTION: Yes, but in your time of filing rule,\nyou -- you have a very definite period. Now, this is an\nexception. And when is the -- under the rule of the\nexception, when is the last time this can be raised?\nMR. GREENBERG: I would -- would --\nrespectfully, Chief Justice Rehnquist, I would think\nbefore trial is -- is the last time it can be raised\nbecause Caterpillar says once a case has been tried. It's\nvery clear.\nAnd -- and our -- in this case Atlas was tried\nto a jury. And as Justice Ginsburg correctly pointed out,\nthis case goes right back to the same court. And if the\nconsiderations of finality, of costs of litigation, of\npeople, litigants waiting in line to have their cases\ntried is to have any meaning, then this Court should\noverlay that on the facts of this case and say, well, it\nwould be as Yogi Berra said, deja vu all over again, just\nto go try this case.\nQUESTION: Does -- does the record tell us why\nthe partnership was changed in its composition?\nMR. GREENBERG: The -- the record does not. The\n-- the record only reflects that 6 -- 6 months before the\ntrial, the two Mexican partners were bought out, if you\nwill, were no longer partners. That was not finalized\nbecause of some -- it was -- it was final from the\nparties' standpoint, but there was a technical need for\nsome document from the NASD, and I'm not sure that's in\nthe record, that that's why petitioner says, well, it was\nreally only finally cured a month before trial. But\nnevertheless -\nQUESTION: Did the same attorneys represent the\npartnership in -- in this change of partner transaction as\nwere representing the -- Atlas in the litigation?\nMR. GREENBERG: No. No, Your -- no, Justice\nKennedy, that is not the case.\nQUESTION: Do you see any impediment? Or, first\nof all, explain to me what that second filing was. Mr.\nBoyce told us -\nMR. GREENBERG: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- that you filed a second complaint.\nMR. GREENBERG: That is not in the record, but\nwhat occurred is when the judge dismissed this case after\nthe jury trial, the thought process was, well, let's start\nanew so that whatever happens on appeal, that case will be\nadvanced so much it would be tried right away, we thought.\nBut after discussing it and after thinking about it, we\ndidn't want two cases to go along at the same time. So we\n-- it -- we dismissed it without prejudice, relying on\nwhatever happens in this case.\nQUESTION: So you did that before you knew what\nthe outcome was -\nMR. GREENBERG: Oh, yes. We did that long\nbefore we knew what the -- long before we knew what the\noutcome or the briefing was in -- in the -- in the Fifth\nCircuit.\nQUESTION: Do you know of any impediment? Now\n-- now it's for sure that you can go back to the same\ncourt with the same parties, do the same thing all over\nagain. Mr. Boyce said that as far as the Texas statute of\nlimitations is concerned, it's not a problem. Is -- is\nthere anything that -- apart from repeating the same\nthing, that would put you at a disadvantage?\nMR. GREENBERG: Mr. Boyce is a bright lawyer and\nI don't know what's in his mind, but as for me, I believe\nthere's a savings clause in the Texas statutory scheme\nthat upon ruling by this Court, if it were not to uphold\nthe Fifth Circuit and this case had to be refiled in\ndistrict court, I -- I believe that that savings clause\nwould pertain except -- except -- that in the record it\nshows that New York law is to apply to this litigation.\nAnd I don't know whether New York substantive law would\napply or Texas procedural law would apply.\nMy coming here today, of course, was the hope of\nan affirmance and not have to face that issue. And -\nQUESTION: Under the Fifth Circuit rule, suppose\nthere's no diversity when the suit is filed because the\nplaintiff resides in the same State as one of the\ndefendants, and then the plaintiff moves in order to\ncreate diversity. Doesn't the Fifth Circuit rule permit\nthat to occur without destroying the jurisdiction of the\ncourt?\nMR. GREENBERG: I'll answer -\nQUESTION: Then let's say this is done just\nbefore trial.\nMR. GREENBERG: And the issue then is raised\nafter the trial?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. GREENBERG: I would respectfully say this,\nnot only do I think the Fifth Circuit rule allows that, I\nthink Caterpillar allows that.\nQUESTION: You think which?\nMR. GREENBERG: I think Caterpillar -\nQUESTION: Caterpillar.\nMR. GREENBERG: -- the unanimous decision of\nthis Court, would allow that same fact situation, but -\nQUESTION: It's -- it's really -- it's really\nquite different to say, look it, it's the same party here\nwho was here at the outset of the trial, this very same\nperson, and he's been here all through. All that's\nhappened is one other person who -- who destroyed\njurisdiction has gotten out. It seems to me it's quite\nsomething different to say we had -- we had one person,\nyou know, originally with -- with a certain citizenship.\nThat's -- that same person is here. It was bad as to -\nas to him originally, but now it's changed because he's\nchanged his citizenship. I'm not sure that that's the\nsame situation. It seems to me quite different.\nQUESTION: It seems to me that that situation is\njust what Justice Marshall dealt with when he said you\ncannot oust a court of jurisdiction once lodged. So if\nthere is authority, then it doesn't matter whether that\nplaintiff moves. I mean, the plaintiff who certainly\ncouldn't move and become non-diverse and hope to escape an\nadverse judgment -- I thought -- I thought that rule was\nfirm, that a single plaintiff, if it's just a two-party\nlawsuit, jurisdiction is not ousted. And I don't think\nthat Caterpillar in any way suggests that that one party\nplaintiff situation would be different.\nThe -- the partnership is sort of in between.\nIt's not like a single individual, but it's not quite like\nCaterpillar either where there were wholly discrete\nparties.\nMR. GREENBERG: I -- I noted in Caterpillar at\npage 11 that the Court cited the McMahan case from the\nThird Circuit in which there was a change in the\npartnership after the filing, but before the trial so as\nto empower the court with complete diversity and the court\nhad the judicial power to decide the case.\nI take it that if this Court in its unanimous\nopinion referred to the McMahan case, Knop v. McMahan,\nthat it -- it understood that change in that case and did\nnot dispute the fact, therefore, that the change in a\nlimited partnership is acceptable so that when that change\noccurs and then there is complete diversity and then there\nis a trial, that the court has the Article III judicial\npower to decide the case.\nOr as -- or as Justice Souter said in Lexecon,\nwhile not on all fours with this case by any means, there\nwas no continuing defiance but merely untimely compliance.\nIn this case there was no continuing defiance of the\ncourt's jurisdiction. Once the limited partners were\nbought out of the limited partnership, this court acquired\nthe power, and once it acquired the power, the lineage of\ncases, the thread of cases from -- from Grubbs, Newman-\nGreen, and Caterpillar say this court has the power to\nconsider that case.\nQUESTION: Well, Grubbs -- what -- what --\nGrubbs was a removal case.\nMR. GREENBERG: Yes, that is true. The only\ndirect filing case -- you are correct, Justice -- Chief\nJustice Rehnquist.\nQUESTION: I'm glad to know that.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GREENBERG: Well -- and -- and following on\nthat, but of course, Newman-Green, a rule 21 case,\nadmittedly is very instructive here because Newman-Green\n-- the court gave the plaintiff the option of dismissing\nthe dispensable party. The plaintiff took the option.\nWhile the case was on appeal, the appellate court gave the\noption. The plaintiff dismissed the dispensable party and\nthe court said okay, we had jurisdiction then to render -\nthe district court had jurisdiction then to render summary\njudgment in that case.\nThe plaintiff could have turned down that power\nand said, no, I don't want to lose that dispensable party.\nHe may be the money man. He may be the one that I can\ncome after later on.\nSo you do have this Court in Newman-Green\napproving, if you will, the act of the plaintiff\nunilaterally to make the decision whether it's going to\nstay in Federal court or in that case -- well, stay in\nFederal court.\nHere, there are -- there are -- the -- the\npetitioner raises two salient issues: removal is\ndifferent than remand and this was unilateral. I've\ncovered the unilateral in my opinion, and I will say one\nfinal thing about -- subject to questions, about the\nremoval.\nAnd that is once a case comes to this court by\nremoval or by direct filing, the jurisdictional questions\nare the same at that point, and that is, is there\ndiversity? And in Caterpillar, it said, well, there\nwasn't and the court erroneously ruled, but later on\ndiversity obtained and we had Article III jurisdictional\npower to try the case.\nI -- it's like coming to Washington, D.C. by\ntrain, boat, plane. Once you get to Washington, D.C.,\nyou're subject to the same rules. Once we be -- came\nbefore the Federal court by direct filing, or once\nCaterpillar in the removal filing, the test was the same.\nWe -- we believe this is a very, very narrow case.\nQUESTION: May I just ask you one general\nquestion? In -- in your view is the rule that you\nadvocate a one-way street in the sense that if there was\njurisdiction when the case was filed, then the next week\nthe plaintiff moved to the same State of the defendant,\nthere would nevertheless continue to be jurisdiction all\nthe way down the line?\nMR. GREENBERG: That -- Justice Stevens, that is\ncorrect.\nQUESTION: So it's -- this -- this rule, if we\nadopt it, is 100 -- it's -- it's to -- it's always to\npreserve or to allow a -- a belated creation of\njurisdiction.\nMR. GREENBERG: Once the court acquires the\npower, it doesn't lose it or it is not divested by the\nactions of the parties.\nQUESTION: Okay. Then the second question is -\nI just want to be 100 percent sure on your view -- is if\nthe original defect is discovered before trial, even\nthough it had been corrected a day or 2 later, there would\nstill be a duty to dismiss the complaint, dismiss for want\nof jurisdiction because there was no jurisdiction at the\ntime of filing, under your view.\nMR. GREENBERG: Respectfully, Justice Stevens,\nit's not my view. It's what I believe Caterpillar says\nbecause Caterpillar speaks of a case having been tried.\nThe words are cases tried on -- on -- and I hope it's page\n11 -- it -- it -\nQUESTION: Well, that would be the end of\nfiling, not -- not before trial. He said -- the -- the\nquestion is before -- you're -- you're taking the position\nbefore trial. Once trial has started -\nMR. GREENBERG: I think the court would have to\ndismiss the case.\nQUESTION: Well, that's not what Caterpillar\nsays. Having been tried is what -\nMR. GREENBERG: It says, having been tried.\nQUESTION: I -- I take that to mean the trial\nhaving been completed.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. GREENBERG: So do I. So I'm agreeing with\nyou. I think the court -\nQUESTION: As Caterpillar said, that if at the\ntime of trial -\nMR. GREENBERG: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- you have no spoiler in the\npicture, which was what Caterpillar was.\nMR. GREENBERG: That's correct.\nQUESTION: And if there's a sentence that says\nsomething different, but the facts in Caterpillar was\nbefore the trial began, it was complete diversity.\nMR. GREENBERG: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Your answer to Justice Stevens, when\nhe put his question, was yes.\nMR. GREENBERG: Yes.\nQUESTION: If in fact it's noticed before the\ntrial is complete, it is necessary to dismiss. And that\nyou believe the answer is, one, yes, and you believe\nthat's implicit in Caterpillar because you agree with what\nJustice Scalia said.\nMR. GREENBERG: That is correct. That's very\nwell put and I thank you very much.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Suppose -- suppose -\nMR. GREENBERG: I honestly thought that was my\nanswer.\nQUESTION: Who -- who is that man?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GREENBERG: I honestly thought that was my\nanswer.\nQUESTION: I did too.\nMR. GREENBERG: But -- but I also -- I also have\nto hasten to point out that Justice Ginsburg's opinion\nsays cured -- you know, if it's cured before trial. In -\nin this case, it was cured before trial, but it wasn't\nraised before trial. It was raised after the trial. We\nfall well within the umbrella of Caterpillar.\nQUESTION: Suppose you had gone to that trial\nwith the two Mexicans still in the partnership and you had\nwon, and then could you then have said to the court, we\ndon't need those Mexican partners? They're out of here.\nSo now, we'd like to make a motion under rule 21 to drop\nthose two people from the party lineup. Could you have\ndone that?\nMR. GREENBERG: Under rule 21, if they were\ndispensable, yes.\nQUESTION: So you're suggesting that a plaintiff\ncould play the same game as a defendant could play, say,\noh, I'm going to go in -- I'm going to go in and get my\ntrial, and I'm going to have those two spoilers in the\ncase, and if I win, fine, I won't open my mouth. If I\nlose, out they go and I start over again.\nMR. GREENBERG: I understand the question, and\nrespectfully, Justice Ginsburg, I would say that rule 21,\nNewman-Green, and Caterpillar does allow that.\nI would say, though, on the other hand, that\nthere are other checks on -- on the ethics of -- of\nlawyers. If they do go in with that type of mental frame\nof mind, that there are ethical obligations, and you're\ngoing to face the wrath of the court. The court may have\na -- a hearing, for example, to you -- for you to show\ncause why you should be sanctioned for misrepresenting\nthings to the court. I'm very concerned about that.\nQUESTION: If -- if the rule you're proposing\nkind of invites the sort of conduct that you say is\nprohibited, maybe there's something wrong with the rule.\nMR. GREENBERG: I'm not proposing a rule, Chief\nJustice -\nQUESTION: Well, you're -- you're proposing a\nrule that is derived, you say, from Caterpillar.\nMR. GREENBERG: I'm proposing that -- that this\ncase on its facts falls within the exception in\nCaterpillar. I'm not advocating any new rule.\nQUESTION: Well, except that there was not a\nlimited partnership in Caterpillar.\nMR. GREENBERG: There was not a limited\npartnership in Caterpillar, but diversity was cured before\ntrial and the issue was not raised until after trial.\nQUESTION: And I suppose you would argue that if\nwe're looking for bright line rules, we shouldn't make it\nturn on what the nature of a particular jurisdictional\ndefect was or they moved to another State or you let one\npartner resign or something like that. The bright line\nrule, it seems to me, has to turn on whether it's equally\nbright line to say you can make this objection up till the\ntime of a verdict in the trial court or it's equally\nbright line to say you can do it up to the time that the\nappellate court judgment is final. You can't do it after\n-- we all agree you can't do it on collateral attack.\nAnd I don't know why one is any more bright line\nthan the other, unless you get into these ramifications\nthat there's a difference between removal and filing or a\ndifference between the -- the plaintiff moving to another\nState or -- or adding a partner. Those are all -- it\nseems to me any one of those would depart from the need\nfor a bright line rule.\nMR. GREENBERG: Respectfully, Justice Stevens, I\ndo agree with that. I think the rule -- the time of\nfiling rule is -- is a general rule and it has been\nsubject to exception. We fall -- we -- this case falls\nwithin the Caterpillar, Newman-Green, Grubbs exception.\nYes, there are distinctions in the factual issues, but\nthose distinctions are without a difference as far as what\nwe would ask this Court to do.\nQUESTION: Well, they're pretty big distinctions\nbecause in the other cases, they were just extra parties\nthat could be dropped out. Here the whole partnership -\nthe nature of the partnership had to change. There was -\nthe -- the initial premise for the jurisdiction was wrong\nbased on the identity and the composition of the\npartnership, not the identity and the composition of all\nof the parties that are in the complaint. Now, that may\nbe metaphysical, but it -- it does seem to me to open more\nroom for manipulation than existed just with Caterpillar\non the books.\nMR. GREENBERG: Respectfully, Justice Kennedy, I\nwill answer your question. I -- I do not think it opens\nthe door to more manipulation. Two reasons.\nNumber one, in Texas the general partner has the\nright to bring lawsuits. The limited partners do not have\nthe right to sue or be sued in their name on behalf of the\nlimited partnership. That's a very important distinction\nhere.\nThe -- the second point -- and I think this is\nmore important -- the precedent of this Court does not\ndiscuss intent. Caterpillar, Newman-Green, Grubbs did not\ntalk about what were the parties' intent at the time that\nthe jurisdictional Article III power came to this court.\nSince there is no discussion in those cases of intent, it\nis my reading that intent is not an issue. It's an\nabsolute. Did the court have jurisdiction or does it not?\nAnd I think there are checks and balances on\nlawyers who would manipulate, as you say, Justice Kennedy.\nQUESTION: Can I get back to -- to bright line\nrules? It seems to me it is a bright line rule, that you\ncan preserve jurisdiction by dismissing a party. That's\nvery bright line.\nI don't think it's very bright line to say, you\nknow, whenever there was a jurisdictional defect which\nlater is cured -- in any way whatever? I mean, this case\ninvolves an alteration in the citizenship of the\npartnership. What about an alteration of the citizenship\nof the corporation? They reincorporate somewhere else\nbefore the thing happens? What about a -- a private\nindividual who decides to move to another State? Is that\ncovered? Is this bright line when -- when we still have\nall of these -- all of these future cases in front of us?\nIt seems to me it is not.\nMR. GREENBERG: Respectfully, Justice Scalia, in\nCaterpillar at page 11, there are overriding\nconsiderations to those analogies, which of course are not\nthe facts here. There's no showing of intent here.\nThere's -- there's -- the only showing is neither party\nadverted to the issue. This case was tried. But -\nQUESTION: There's a difference between the\nabsence of jurisdiction at the outset, which is what is\ninvolved when you have a plaintiff from the same State as\nthe defendant which can't be cured by the plaintiff moving\nto a diverse State, and imperfect jurisdiction, in other\nwords, that you do have diversity, but you have a spoiler\nin the picture. That is -- that is very clear in\nCaterpillar, less clear in the partnership. Although the\npartners are five individuals, they are not an entity the\nway a corporation is.\nMR. GREENBERG: That's correct. In this -- in\nthis partnership, there were, I think, two corporations.\nQUESTION: Wasn't the partnership sued as an\nentity? I thought that it was sued as a partnership.\nMR. GREENBERG: It was a sued as a partnership.\nThat is correct.\nQUESTION: As a partnership. And so -\nMR. GREENBERG: Yes, and two individuals.\nQUESTION: So there was no jurisdiction\ninitially over the partnership.\nMR. GREENBERG: That's correct.\nQUESTION: It wasn't -- it was sued. It -- it\nsued. It was the plaintiff, wasn't it? The -\nMR. GREENBERG: Atlas sued -\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. GREENBERG: -- and was counterclaimed\nagainst by Dataflux as an entity, and then Dataflux third-\npartied in the two Mexican individuals.\nQUESTION: But at -- at the outset, contrary to\nthe earlier statement, it was not a matter of imperfect\njurisdiction. There was no jurisdiction over Atlas.\nPeriod. The -- of the partnership.\nMR. GREENBERG: According to Carden v. Arkoma,\nJustice Scalia, the way I read it, the jurisdiction did\nnot obtain at the time of filing. That was only cured\nlater, but the overriding consideration in Caterpillar\nunanimously by this Court is once a diversity case has\nbeen tried in Federal court, with the rules of decisions\nunder State law, under Erie v. Tompkins, considerations of\nfinality, efficiency, and economy become overwhelming. If\nI have to take those words as they are, they are\noverwhelming, then it is overwhelming in this case because\nthis case is narrower than Caterpillar. Why send this\ncase back?\nI would ask this Court -- these principles apply\nregardless of whether the case arrives to Federal court\nthrough removal or original filing. I would ask this\nCourt, on behalf of the respondent, that this Court apply\nthese principles to conclude that the trial court in this\ncase had subject matter jurisdiction at the time of trial,\nand allow this case to return the district court for entry\nof judgment consistent with the jury verdict.\nQUESTION: Thank -\nMR. GREENBERG: If there are no more questions,\nI give back the Court my -- the balance of my time.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Greenberg.\nMr. Boyce, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM J. BOYCE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BOYCE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI would like to elaborate on an answer to\nJustice Breyer's question, which has been touched on by a\nnumber of the questions here, which is what's the worst\nthat can happen. And I -- I think the point would be\nthis. Once the efficacy of a post-filing change in\ncitizenship is -- is taken as a given, then I think you're\n-- you're setting up a situation where the door swings\nboth ways. Jurisdiction can be created and jurisdiction\ncan be destroyed by virtue of post-filing changes.\nQUESTION: Well, he says it's the opposite.\nmean, you -- you could do that, but I mean, it's very\nclear to say it could destroy it; no. It could create it;\nyes. I mean, that's not hard to understand, and there's a\nlot of authority.\nMR. BOYCE: The -- the rule -- if -- if the line\nis drawn there, then I -- I think that raises implications\nof manipulation. You can move and create it and then move\nback and not destroy it. If -- if the concern is creating\nincentives -\nQUESTION: Only if the court says -- only if the\ncourt says so because the rule, even the timely filing\nrule was -- was something that John Marshall said and it's\nbeen that way ever since, with exceptions and recognizing\nthat a human individual is different from a corporation is\ndifferent from a partnership. If -- if a court is going\nto make such a regime, surely it would make a sensible one\nand not one that's subject to abuse.\nMR. BOYCE: If -- there -- there may be -- the\n-- the court will do what it will do. The -- the question\nis, is there an -- a creation of additional opportunities\nfor manipulation or confusion, and we -\nQUESTION: What are they? You were going to\nsay. What are they?\nMR. BOYCE: And -- and I submit that if the\nbright line rule is no longer bright, if it -- if it turns\non the fact of how far into the trial court proceedings\nbefore this came up, then it's -- the -- the time when you\nneed certainty most, in terms of being able to decide\nwhether or not you have jurisdiction, that's when there's\ngoing to be the least amount of clarity. And that's the\nreal -- the real problem that's -- that's created here.\nAnd -- and Justice Stevens had -- had asked the\n-- the question saying, well, why don't we just draw the\n-- the line? You want a bright line rule? We'll -- we'll\ndraw it at the time of trial. I think the problem here is\nthat what you're setting up is a circumstance where for\nsome period of time, a trial court, a Federal district\ncourt is acting ultra vires, to borrow the phrase from\nSteel Company, for some period of time prior to whenever\nyou say the -- the post-filing change could become\neffective. You've got a Federal trial court that is\noperating without authority. It's issuing orders.\nQUESTION: No. You assume the jurisdictional\ndefect has been cured.\nMR. BOYCE: But prior to the time of that curing\nof that defect, you have a circumstance as you had here\nfor 3 years, for example, where you've got a Federal\ndistrict court issuing summary -\nQUESTION: And as you had in Caterpillar.\nMR. BOYCE: And -- and I guess the point I would\nmake is -- is this. If Caterpillar opened the door to a\ncomponent of retroactive jurisdiction, it did not open\nthat door very wide. And -- and the -- the choice is\nshould that -- should that door be opened wider and what\nare the problems that result from that. And our position\nwould be that the confusion and uncertainty and\nopportunities for manipulation that are going to result\nfrom opening that door wider make it appropriate to leave\nthe line drawn where -\nQUESTION: Can you imagine a plaintiff's lawyer\ndeliberately filing a Federal lawsuit where he knows\nthere's no Federal jurisdiction? Why would he ever do\nthat?\nMR. BOYCE: That may not be a -- a circumstance\nthat -- that is likely to happen, but -\nQUESTION: But you're talking about deliberate\nmanipulation, and I just don't understand why a competent\nlawyer would ever do that.\nMR. BOYCE: I -- I think the -- the greater\nissue is -- is one of uncertainty and of having a\ncircumstance like this case or going back as early as -\nas the Capron case where the case gets filed and gets\ntried and then the issue comes up.\nI do want to make one note about the reference\nto the Knop case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Boyce.\n"
