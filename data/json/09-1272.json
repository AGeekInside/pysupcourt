        "content": "(11:00 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext this morning in Case 09-1272, Kentucky v. King.\nMr. Farley.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSHUA D. FARLEY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FARLEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe issue before you today, of whether or\nnot police can impermissibly create exigent\ncircumstances, arises from the improper suppression of\nreasonably seized evidence after a reasonable\nwarrantless entry. The test set forth by the Kentucky\nSupreme Court is improper for several reasons, the first\nof which is that this Court has routinely held that the\nsubjective intent of police officers when effecting a\nwarrantless entry is irrelevant.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where did the -- where\ndid the Kentucky Supreme Court -- where did the Kentucky\nSupreme Court say that it was looking to a subjective\nstate of mind on the part of the police?\nMR. FARLEY: Well, the Kentucky Supreme\nCourt's first prong of their test -- and I believe it's\nin our petition appendix on page 26 -- I'm sorry.\nTheir -- their discussion starts on page 44a and carries\nover to 46a. The first question of their test is\nwhether or not the officers acted in bad faith in an\nattempt to purposefully evade the warrant requirements.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That didn't -- that\ndidn't apply in this case?\nMR. FARLEY: That is correct.\nThe second prong of the Kentucky Supreme\nCourt's test is whether or not the actions of the\nRespondent in this case or the occupant of the home\nwould have been foreseeable by the police officers\nbefore they knocked and announced their presence.\nNow, the problem with the foreseeability\ntest -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But why is -- why is that\nsubjective? Why isn't that -- would it be foreseeable\nto a reasonable police officer similarly situated?\nMR. FARLEY: Well, Justice Ginsburg, it -\nit isn't directly a subjective inquiry. However, police\nofficers are trained to expect and foresee illegal\nactivity so that they may carry out the duties of their\njob in protecting the citizens. So under a\nforeseeability test, a reasonable officer will always\nforesee illegal activity in response to his actions, be\nit walking down the street or knocking on your door. A\nreasonable officer will always foresee illegal activity,\nand for that reason, the Kentucky Supreme Court's test\nis completely unworkable.\nSeveral of the other circuits and the lower\ncourts have adopted tests that also attempt to add an\nextra exception, an unwarranted closure of the exigent\ncircumstances exception that narrows the use of that\nexception by police officers. The test that the\nCommonwealth would propose is a simple lawfulness test.\nNow, under this test, as long as an officer\nbehaves lawfully, there should be no suppression of\nevidence seized after an otherwise reasonable search.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, you have an\napartment building where the police know from experience\nthere's a lot of illegal activity, a lot of drugs, drug\ntransactions. Every 2 weeks, they walk through and\nknock on every door and wait for evidence of the\ndestruction of -- of drugs. Is that all right?\nMR. FARLEY: Well, there's -- I would say\n\"yes,\" if there's probable cause as well as exigent\ncircumstances.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the probable\ncause, of course, comes when they hear the, you know,\nflushing and the, you know, hiding or whatever behind\nthe door.\nMR. FARLEY: Well, I would assert that there\nare -- there are two separate issues here. You must\nhave probable cause separate from the existence of\nexigent circumstances. In this case, there was probable\ncause due to the smell of marijuana.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They go to the apartment\nbuilding, and they sniff at every door, and when they\nsniff, when a strong smell of marijuana emanates from\nthe door, then they go through this routine, but they do\nit as a matter of every 2 weeks, as the Chief said, as a\nroutine matter. They don't just knock on every door,\nbut they knock on the doors where they smell marijuana,\nand they do that just as a routine, in all the buildings\nwhere they suspect there may be drug -- drugs being\nstashed.\nMR. FARLEY: Justice Ginsburg, under a\nsimple lawfulness test, since the officers have not\nviolated the Fourth Amendment prior to the exigency\narising, there would be no need to suppress any\nevidence. That would be perfectly fine for the officers\nto do that. It may not be the most -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- to the Chief Justice\nwhen he said -- and I think this was the Solicitor\nGeneral's position -- that the police can routinely\nknock at a door and wait to see if they hear a toilet\nflushing. I -- I've taken it out of this case but -\nbecause I don't know what noise means. But your answer\nwould be \"yes\"?\nMR. FARLEY: Yes, if -- if probable cause\nexists, because -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's what -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, why -- why do you\nneed the probable cause inquiry? What does it have to\ndo with anything?\nMR. FARLEY: Well, under the Fourth\nAmendment, for a reasonable warrantless search to occur,\na police officer must have -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Before they can go in -\nMR. FARLEY: Yes. The police officer must\nhave -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- because they've just\nheard the toilet flushing?\nMR. FARLEY: They must have probable cause\ncoupled with exigent circumstances.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. I think\nI've got two different probable causes that's caused -\ncausing me some confusion. I understand their\nrequirement of probable cause, and that they hear sound\nof evidence being destroyed and therefore enter. Is\nthat -- or are you talking about the probable cause to\nthink there's something going on in the first place?\nMR. FARLEY: There are two separate issues\nhere. They must have probable cause aside from exigent\ncircumstances. Then they must also have -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: To knock on the door?\nMR. FARLEY: -- a reasonable belief -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: They must have probable\ncause to knock on the door?\nMR. FARLEY: No, Justice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No. All right.\nMR. FARLEY: They can -- just as citizen\ncould -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay. Take us -\nMR. FARLEY: -- they could knock on the\ndoor. However -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Take us through it -- take\nus through it chronologically. The policeman is walking\nthrough the hallway. He has no probable cause. He -\nhe -\nMR. FARLEY: He could knock on the door.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: He smells marijuana -\nMR. FARLEY: The smell of -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- then he knocks on the\ndoor. When did the probable cause arise and when must\nit arise?\nMR. FARLEY: Well, the smell of marijuana\nwould give probable cause to obtain a search warrant.\nOnce he knocks on the door and hears noises consistent\nwith the destruction of physical evidence, then an\nexigency has arised. Now the officer has both probable\ncause and an exigent circumstance. And under the -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But I don't understand why\nthe smell of marijuana is necessary. This goes back to\nwhat Justice Sotomayor was saying, you don't need\nprobable cause to knock on a door. Knocking on a door\nis perfectly lawful. So, if there's just a lawfulness\ntest, the knock is fine. And then when you hear\nwhatever it is that you hear that you think creates\nexigent circumstances, whether it's a toilet flushing or\nwhether it's just noise, that, too, gives you the\nability to go right in.\nSo -- so if it's just lawfulness, you don't\nneed the marijuana smell even, do you?\nMR. FARLEY: Well, I think -- I think we're\nconfused. In order to enter with exigent circumstances,\nyou must also have separate probable cause, and it's\nthat you could have gotten -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Probable cause beyond\nthinking that the evidence -\nMR. FARLEY: Beyond the reasonable belief --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- is being destroyed?\nMR. FARLEY: Yes. Correct.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Okay.\nMR. FARLEY: That is correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It might just be somebody\ngoing to the toilet, right?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FARLEY: It could be. It could be. It\ncould very well be.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, you have to suspect\nthat the reason the toilet is flushing is somebody is\ntrying to get rid of evidence. And in order for that to\nbe the case, you have to have smelled the marijuana?\nMR. FARLEY: Yes, Justice Scalia, you're\nabsolutely correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So there's only one\nprobable cause, right?\nMR. FARLEY: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.\nMR. FARLEY: Yes. The exigent circumstances\nis a reasonable belief based upon the totality of the\nsurrounding circumstances. Here, given that the\nofficers had a reasonable belief that they were chasing\na fleeing felon, they had a reasonable belief that this\nwas the doorway he had entered, then you couple that\nwith the noises that they heard, they testified were\nbased on their training -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May -\nMR. FARLEY: -- and experience -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May we just go back\nover -- you're putting in the fleeing felon, but as far\nas I understand from this record, it was never shown\nthat the dealer that the police were following was aware\nthat he was following and that he was fleeing from them.\nThis is the -- it's not part of the question you\npresented, because we granted only on the exigent\ncircumstances, but I didn't think that there was -- the\ndealer wasn't called, and he wasn't asked did you even\nknow that the police were following you?\nMR. FARLEY: That -- that's correct, Justice\nGinsburg. However -- and we cannot divorce the\nofficers' chase of this suspect, regardless of whether\nhe knew of their hot pursuit or not, we cannot divorce\nthose facts from what the officers knew when they\nknocked on the door.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure, you can.\nThere's nothing illegal about walking down the hall and\nknocking on somebody's door. And if as a police officer\nyou say I smell marijuana, and then you hear the\nflushing, then there's probable cause. You don't need\nany business about the dealer and the breezeway and all\nthat at all.\nMR. FARLEY: Certainly. Certainly, Mr.\nChief Justice. You're absolutely correct. I was -- I\nwas just speaking in terms of this case, saying that\nthere were -- there was ample evidence that exigent\ncircumstances existed here, coupled with the probable\ncause.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask a question -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And in your view -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask a question that\ngoes back to what you said? You have clarified very\nnicely that there has to be probable cause to think that\nthere's something wrong going on in the -- the\napartment. And you said that is, at that point when\nthey -- the marijuana -- a strong smell comes from the\ndoor, at that point the police could go and get a\nwarrant. Then they don't have to, because then they\nknock on the door.\nWe start out with a strong presumption that\nthe Fourth Amendment requires a warrant, a strong\npreference for getting the warrant. So why in this\nsituation wouldn't the first response of the police\nbe -- instead of knocking, because once they knock they\nalert the people in there: Let's get a warrant; we'll\ncome back.\nMR. FARLEY: Well, the officers testified\nunder these circumstances that they believed that they\nwere in hot pursuit of this felon. So at the time they\nwere at the door, they believed he had entered this\napartment and was aware of their presence and was\ndestroying evidence of his deal of crack cocaine, so\nthis is a fluid, evolving -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, how does this\n-- how does this holding by us not become a simple\nwarrantless entry in any drug case? Meaning: Police\nknock on the door, suspect doesn't answer it, gets up\nand moves to their bedroom. Because there's no noise\nthat was described by this police officer. It was\nsimply not answering the door and moving. So if that's\nall it takes, any police officer will come in and say:\nIn my experience, most drug dealers destroy the evidence\nwhen we knock.\nMR. FARLEY: Well -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Aren't we just doing\naway with Johnson? And aren't we just simply saying\nthey can just walk in whenever they smell marijuana,\nwhenever they think there's drugs on the other side?\nWhy do we even bother giving them a -- a warrant?\nMR. FARLEY: Well, I would disagree with\nyou. I think that when determining whether an exigent\ncircumstance exists, you look at the totality of the\ncircumstances. So -- and there would be a myriad of\ncases in which a court would determine that, simply\nbased upon the testimony or the noises that were heard,\nwith no surrounding circumstances, that exigent\ncircumstances may not have existed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what if the\ndefendants here had not flushed the evidence down but\nhad answered the door and said \"Yes?\"?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would the policemen have\nbeen able to do anything just because they had smelled\nmarijuana?\nMR. FARLEY: They could have sought a\nconsensual encounter with the occupant.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, yes, but they'd say:\nOh, heck, no, you can't come in -\nMR. FARLEY: Well, then -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- do you have a warrant?\nMR. FARLEY: Then the officers would not\nhave been able to force entry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So basically the -- the\npolice were taking advantage of the stupidity of the\ncriminals; is that right?\nMR. FARLEY: Well, I don't know about -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's terrible. That's\nnot fair, is it?\nMR. FARLEY: I don't know that I would\nphrase it -- there is no -- there is not a requirement\nto inform an occupant of a right to denial. However,\nthe officers could not have forced their way into the\nhome. That would have made this a case like Johnson.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What if the officers had\nsimply knocked, said \"We're going to kick the door in if\nyou don't open it\"?\nMR. FARLEY: I believe that's still fine\nunder a lawfulness test, unless the occupant of the home\nsubmits to that show of authority and comes to the door\nand allows entry. Now, if that -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, after -- after\nthey've heard the -- the movement inside or the flushing\nor whatever. You can't just kick it in because you've\nsmelled marijuana. You -- can you do it, because you -\nyou knock on the door because you smell marijuana,\nnobody answers, and you kick the door in?\nMR. FARLEY: Well, I believe that the noises\nthat they heard were consistent with destruction of\nphysical evidence based upon their training and\nexperience.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but without that\nnoise. Just -\nMR. FARLEY: Then, no. No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, of course not.\nMR. FARLEY: No, of course not. They would\nhave to obtain a warrant at that point. If the person\ncame to the door and denied them consent, they would\nhave to obtain a warrant. If the person did not come to\nthe door and made -- no exigency arose, then the\nofficers would still have to go and obtain a warrant -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- this may be a bit\nrudimentary, but can you tell me why isn't the evidence\nalways being destroyed when the marijuana is being\nsmoked? Isn't it being burnt up?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FARLEY: I -- Justice Kennedy, I -- I\nwould tend to -- I would tend to agree with you.\nHowever, I know this Court in Johnson stated that the\nsmell of burning opium was not the destruction of\nevidence, and the only thing they could have obtained\nwould have been the fumes or the vapors. I tend to\nagree -- disagree with that personally. However, from a\nlegal viewpoint, the simple smell of burning marijuana\nis not -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So the distinction is\nbeing destroyed as opposed to being consumed?\nMR. FARLEY: Correct, that is -- that is\ncorrect.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And how is it -- you\nmention Johnson.\nMR. FARLEY: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And I think the other\nside says it was the same thing except it was a hotel\nroom instead of an apartment building. The police\nsmell -- in that case, it was -- what was it?\nMR. FARLEY: Well, what occurred in Johnson,\nI believe, is -- is completely different than what\noccurred here. What occurred in Johnson was the\nofficers forced their way into the occupant's apartment\n-- the occupant's hotel room and then said: Consider\nyourself under arrest.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Didn't they smell\nmarijuana or opium or something?\nMR. FARLEY: Well, they did, and they\nknocked on the door, and she came to the door and\nthey -- they forced their way in. There was no -- there\nwas no \"let us in,\" there was no demand for entry, there\nwas no even ask-for consent to enter. They then said:\nConsider yourself under arrest. They searched, and then\nheld her under arrest based upon the evidence that they\nobtained.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You left out one thing.\nI thought they heard ruffling noises before they\nattempted to get into the apartment -- into the hotel\nroom. There was something about noises.\nMR. FARLEY: Well, I believe they heard\nsounds when they knocked on the door. But she actually\ncame to the door, and then the officers forced entry.\nHere we don't have that. We have no forced entry.\nThese are two different circumstances. In Johnson, an\nexigency did not exist. Here an exigency does exist.\nIf there are no further questions, I'd like\nto reserve the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nFarley.\nMR. FARLEY: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. O'Connell.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O'CONNELL,\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMS. O'CONNELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nIf police officers act lawfully in\nconducting their investigation, they may respond to any\nexigencies that arise. It is up to police officers to\ndetermine how they will collect evidence in any given\ncase as long as they stay within the confines of the\nFourth Amendment. Although securing a warrant -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you -- does a\nruling in this case that any lawful conduct by the\npolice mean that the police knock, somebody gets up on\nthe other side and walks through a closed door, and\ncloses a door in the back, and police say, \"In my\nexperience it's -- it's consistent with the destruction\nof property that drug dealers will go into a closed room\nto get rid of it\" -- is that enough?\nMS. O'CONNELL: I don't think so, Justice\nSotomayor. I think that in any case -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why not? I mean\npeople -- you know, when there's a knock on -- on the\ndoor, is the normal human reaction to walk into the\nother room and shut the door?\nMS. O'CONNELL: Well, a person might not -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, that's peculiar\nbehavior, isn't it?\nMS. O'CONNELL: A person doesn't have to\nanswer the door. A person might come to the door; they\nmight also ignore whoever is at the door. Both of those\noptions are fine.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that a common\nexperience, that you knock on a door and all you hear is\nsomebody walking out of the room and shutting a door?\nMS. O'CONNELL: I mean, I -- I guess that a\nperson is entitled to do that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't recall it ever\nhappening to me, but maybe -- maybe I'm a likable fellow\nand people open the door.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. O'CONNELL: I mean, I think that that -\nthat's certainly a lawful option that somebody has when\nthe police officers knock at their door. And,\ncertainly, in this case -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They could say \"Go away.\"\nThey could do a lot of stuff. But walk in the other\nroom and shut the door?\nMS. O'CONNELL: That's -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Strange.\nMS. O'CONNELL: I guess some people might do\nthat if they don't want to give consent to police entry.\nI think that in order to go in, based on an exigent\ncircumstance, the police would have to be able to\narticulate to a court that they objectively, reasonably\nbelieved that there was destruction of evidence\noccurring inside.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And what was that here?\nBecause it was kind of vague. They heard movement.\nWhat kind -- what kind of movement? It didn't -- it\nsaid nothing about a toilet flushing -\nMS. O'CONNELL: Justice Ginsburg, it's our\nposition that the Court should assume that there was an\nexigency in this case.\nIn the Respondent's brief in opposition, he\nargued that there was insufficient evidence of exigency.\nThe Court nonetheless granted cert on the question of\nwhether a police-created exigency would be okay under\nthe Fourth Amendment. The Solicitor General believes\nthat the Court should assume there was an exigency, and\nif it agrees with Kentucky on the question presented and\nthen reverses, it should remand to the Kentucky Supreme\nCourt for a determination of whether an exigency\nexisted.\nThe trial court in this case certainly found\nthat the movement inside of the apartment was enough for\nthe officer to reasonably conclude that somebody inside\nwas destroying evidence. The Kentucky Supreme Court\nassumed that that was so in order to reach the question\npresented in this case that the Court granted cert on.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. O'Connell, if I could\nask you about the government's proposed standard: You\nsay that as long as each step in the police conduct is\nlawful, that's sufficient. And each step would -- the\nway the Fourth Amendment works, each step -- we're\nasking, essentially, whether each step is reasonable.\nWhat some courts have done, in addition to\nthat -- and this was not the approach of the court\nbelow -- but what some courts have done is to say we\nalso ask a more holistic reasonableness question. We\nsay: Is the whole process by which the police operated\nwith respect to this person reasonable? So, for\nexample, we might say, you know, was there time to get a\nwarrant, or did it look like the police were just -\nthey preferred not to have to deal with a magistrate?\nSo what's wrong with that sort of standard?\nIn addition to asking whether each step is reasonable,\nto say, look, is the whole pattern here of what the\npolice did to come up with this evidence reasonable?\nMS. O'CONNELL: I think the problem with\nthat test, Justice Kagan, is that police officers have\noptions of how they can conduct searches and seizures.\nGetting a warrant is one way that they could do that.\nGetting consent to conduct a search or a seizure is\nanother way. There's no justification in this Court's\nprecedents for requiring police officers to choose one\nof those options over another if both options are\nlawful.\nIn this case, the police officers knocked on\nthe door, not sure which apartment the person that they\nwere pursuing fled into, in order to determine whether\nthat was the correct apartment. There's no reason why\nthey needed to get a warrant before knocking on the door\nand seeking cooperation of the people inside.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it your position that\nthe police can do anything that's lawful, even if the\npurpose of doing so is to create exigent circumstances?\nMS. O'CONNELL: Yes, I think that under this\nCourt -- the way that this Court has interpreted Fourth\nAmendment warrant exceptions, as long as there is no\nviolation of the Fourth Amendment, that is okay. The\npolice officers can rely on any ensuing exigency.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The -- the question\npresented in the blue brief used the word\n\"impermissible,\" and we're talking about \"unlawful.\" I\ntake it that there is a difference in those -- or no\ndifference?\nMS. O'CONNELL: Well, yes, there is a\ndifference. I think that that comes up in Respondent's\nargument that if there was an impermissible demand for\nentry -- for example, if the police officer said \"I have\na warrant, let me in,\" even though he didn't, as in\nBumper v. North Carolina -- that that could still be\nokay under a lawfulness test as long as the suspect\nreacted by destroying evidence instead of by coming to\nthe door, like in Bumper or Johnson, and going about\nwith a -\nJUSTICE BREYER: What are the objections to\nadding in the alternative \"or in bad faith\"?\nMS. O'CONNELL: Justice Breyer, the\nobjection to that is simply that in all cases that are\nfounded upon probable cause that are not programmatic\nsearches that are conducted without any individualized\nsuspicion, this Court has repeatedly rejected prongs of\na Fourth Amendment test that -- that rely on the\nsubjective assessment -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Objectively? I mean, what\nwe're trying to rule out is they -- they hitch -- they\nget this bright idea, the police: We'll go knock at\nevery door. You know. So what about that, objectively\ndetermined bad faith?\nMS. O'CONNELL: I'm sorry. I don't -\nJUSTICE BREYER: My point is a solely\nunlawfulness test would allow the police to get into the\nhabit of just knocking at every door, but if you say\nthat also it has to survive a bad-faith test, where bad\nfaith is objectively, not subjectively, determined, then\nyou will rule out the possibility of the police\nhatching -- which I don't know if they would, but\nhatching such a plan.\nMS. O'CONNELL: I guess that it's not\ntotally clear what bad faith would mean in this\ncontext -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, there are circuits\nwho have adopted a bad-faith test in the alternative\nwith other things than the word \"unlawful.\" The Second\nCircuit uses only the word \"unlawful,\" and I thought we\ntook this case to iron out that discrepancy. And if we\ndid, I'd like to know your objection to ironing it out\nby taking the Second Circuit test but adding on an\nobjectively determined bad-faith rule.\nMS. O'CONNELL: Justice Breyer, I don't -- I\ndon't know what it means to act in bad faith in a case\nlike this as a police officer.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Maybe it could mean having\nno reason for knocking on the door other than to create\nexigent circumstances.\nMS. O'CONNELL: Well, Justice Alito, I think\nthat it would be difficult to determine objectively\nwhether that was the case. Certainly -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, the police say: Oh,\nI don't want to get a warrant. It's such a bore. We\nhave other things to do. I have a great idea; let's\nknock at the door, and then as soon as he starts moving\naround, I know what his going to the -- going into the\nbathroom means, and we'll hear that, and we'll be able\nto get in.\nMS. O'CONNELL: I think that -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Hey, great idea.\nOkay? Now suppose that's the record.\nMS. O'CONNELL: I think that there's already\na significant risk built into the Fourth Amendment that\npolice officers, if they knock on the door and they\ndon't hear somebody destroying evidence inside, they're\ngoing to have to leave and get a warrant. I think\nthat's enough of a deterrent.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't know that they're\ndestroying evidence unless you have reason to believe\nthat there is contraband inside. I mean, the -- the\nhypothetical is an unrealistic one. They knock on the\ndoor, and somebody moves inside -- that doesn't give\nthem any exigency -\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I mean to add:\nAnd, in fact, there's probable cause.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. They -\nJUSTICE BREYER: In addition, he smelled the\nmarijuana. I just was trying to stick to the relevant\npoints.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's a different\nhypothetical.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. All right. Add that\nto the hypothetical.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There's a hypothetical in\nwhich they knock on every door under which they smell\nmarijuana.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Correct. That's what I\nmean, and I don't always spell it out.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Perfectly okay?\nMS. O'CONNELL: Right, and I think that\nthere's -- the Court shouldn't be concerned, and\ncertainly shouldn't be concerned enough to adopt a\nbad-faith or a subjective motivation prong to a test\nthat it creates which is -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But what makes that\ndifferent than knocking on the door and saying \"Open the\ndoor or I'm going to kick it in\"? You're saying that's\nlawful because until the person submits, you're\nsuggesting there's no coercion in that whatsoever.\nMS. O'CONNELL: That's true, and, Justice\nSotomayor, to be clear -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why wouldn't that\nobjectively be bad faith if what we find out is that\nthey now have a tactic which is they go through this\nbuilding, and every time they smell marijuana, hash, or\n-- I don't know if crack cocaine smells or not when\nthey're smoking it -- but whenever they smell something,\nthey just do that.\nMS. O'CONNELL: I think the -- the fact that\nif the person actually does what the police officer says\nand answers the door will mean that the evidence would\nbe excluded as a coerced consent search is enough of a\ndeterrent to that sort of conduct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So there's no bad-faith\nmeasure whatsoever in your analysis -\nMS. O'CONNELL: I don't think it's\nnecessary.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- and lawfulness is\ndefined by actual physical seizure. So if we have cases\nthat suggest something else, a command to submit, your\nargument would be lost, correct?\nMS. O'CONNELL: I think that's right, if the\nperson submits to the command.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no. I -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMs. O'Connell.\nMs. Drake.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMESA J. DRAKE\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. DRAKE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe odor of burnt marijuana, coupled with\nOfficer Cobb's cursory and equivocal testimony about the\nsounds of movement he couldn't discern exactly and that\nhis training and experience led him only possibly to\nconclude was consistent with the destruction of\nevidence, is insufficient to establish exigent\ncircumstances.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Although you're -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The -- I'm sorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're describing\nwhat you think the evidence was to support exigency, and\nthe suggestion we've heard on the other side is that\nthat's an issue that can be addressed on remand once we,\naccording to the other side, correct the State court's\nerror in that this -- you -- the police cannot create\nexigent circumstances.\nSo I -- I don't know that it's terribly\nrelevant what the underlying facts about what they heard\nwas. That will be relevant depending, or not -\ndepending on what our opinion says.\nMS. DRAKE: It's relevant because it goes to\nwhether exigent circumstances existed. And as to the\nquestion of whether a remand would be appropriate in\nthis case, the question of whether exigent circumstances\nexisted is logically antecedent in any created exigency\ncase.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, it's -- it's not\nat all. The court said: I don't care whether exigent\ncircumstances existed; you cannot create exigent\ncircumstances; so I don't care whether they were or not.\nThe legal standard is antecedent to the\napplication of the facts.\nMS. DRAKE: There's no point in delving into\nwhether an exigency was created by the police if there\nis no exigency to begin with.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I think the\nCourt is interested in taking the case on the question\nwhether or not the police may create exigent\ncircumstances and use those exigent circumstances to\nenter. Now, whether or not there were exigent\ncircumstances here because of the sound is -- is, it\nseems to me, a subsidiary question.\nMS. DRAKE: The other problem with remanding\nthis case for further determination on this issue is, as\nthis Court is aware, the procedural posture of this case\nis troubling. The case has already been dismissed.\nThere is no potential for further proceedings here.\nThere is no --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, sure, there is.\nIt was dismissed because the State supreme court held\nyou can't bring this evidence in. If we say, oh, yes,\nyou can, then the issue becomes live again.\nMS. DRAKE: That conclusion is dependent on\nthe notion that an indictment is merged with the\njudgment such that a decision in the Commonwealth's\nfavor in this case would vacate the decision of the\nKentucky Supreme Court, which in turn vacates the\nunderlying suppression order. But there is no authority\nfor the notion that an indictment and a judgment merge\nas a matter of Kentucky law, and so a decision -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is the argument\nyou presented to us in the letter, right?\nMS. DRAKE: Yes, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And yet, we\nnonetheless decided to have argument.\nMS. DRAKE: Yes, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So maybe it would\nbe -- it's your case, but maybe it would be best to move\non to the legal issue.\nMS. DRAKE: If we move to the question of\nwhether the police have created exigent circumstances,\nit's important that we're all operating on the same\nunderstanding, the facts in this case. This case does\nnot involve a simple knock at the door, and -- and the\ndistinction is important. In this case, at 9:50 p.m.,\nthe officers banged on the door as loudly as they could.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Did the trial court make\nthose findings? I know that you said it in your brief,\nand I thought I read the trial court record. I know\nthey knocked loudly.\nMS. DRAKE: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But what else did they\ndo?\nMS. DRAKE: Yes. And this is located at the\nappendix to the petition in the bottom of page 3a\ncarrying on to 4a. The trial court found: Detective\nMaynard, who was accompanying Officer Cobb in the\nbreezeway attempting to locate and arrest the suspect in\nquestion, banged on the door of the apartment on the\nback left of the breezeway, identifying themselves as\npolice officers and demanding that the door be opened by\npersons inside.\nOfficer Cobb testified at the suppression\nhearing -- and this is at page 22 of the joint appendix:\nDetective Maynard made contact with the door, announced\nour presence, banged on the door as loud as we could,\nannounced \"Police, police, police.\"\nThis is not the case where --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where's -- no \"Open\nup.\" I thought you said earlier they said \"Open up.\"\nMS. DRAKE: Yes. Then Officer Cobb later\ngoes on to explain -- and this is on page 24 of the\njoint appendix: Detective Maynard with Sergeant\nSimmons, we explained to them -- referring to the\noccupants of the apartment -- we were going to make\nentry inside the apartment.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that after -\nafter the exigent circumstances or the alleged exigent\ncircumstances were presented? And that's after they\nheard what they thought -- and I know you disagree -\nwas the destruction of evidence.\nMS. DRAKE: It's -- it's unclear from the\ntrial court's factual finding what the order of events\nwas. The trial court found: Banged on the door of the\napartment, identified themselves as police officers,\nand -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Loudly. Is any of that\nunlawful? Is -- is knocking loudly on the door\nunlawful?\nMS. DRAKE: It's unreasonable conduct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is it -- is it unlawful?\nIs -- is saying \"Open up, police\" -- is that unlawful?\nMS. DRAKE: Well, it's certainly not\nunlawful in the sense that it violates any provision of\nthe penal code. But this is a Fourth Amendment case, so\nthe question is whether it's reasonable.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Drake, the problem I\nhave is there are a lot of constraints on -- on law\nenforcement, and the one thing that -- that it has going\nfor it is that criminals are stupid.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And we had a case some\nyears ago in which the issue was whether the Washington\npolice could enter buses arriving from -- from the south\nand -- and randomly ask passengers, do you mind if we\nlook in your luggage? And the -- the -- the mules who\nwere carrying marijuana were stupid enough to say, oh,\nof course. Just to show that they had nothing to fear.\nAnd an enormous number of arrests were -- were effected\nin that fashion.\nWe didn't say that's not fair because you're\ntaking advantage of the -- of the ignorance of these -\nthese poor criminals. We said that's perfectly okay.\nAnd it seems to me the same thing is going on here.\nThese people could have answered the door -\nthere's a policeman knocking on the door; all he's\nsaying is \"Open the door, open the door\" -- and say\n\"Yes, what do you want?\" Say -- you know, blah, blah,\nblah. They say \"Well, get a warrant.\" Shut the door.\nThey didn't do that. But everything done\nwas perfectly lawful. It's unfair to the criminal? Is\nthat -- is that the problem? I really don't understand\nthe problem.\nMS. DRAKE: I have two responses to Your\nHonor's question. The first is that -- and along with\nthis notion that criminals are stupid and so that's why\nwe get all these criminal cases, there is no difference\nbetween what happened in this case and how an innocent\nperson would respond.\nRecall Officer Cobb's testimony is simply\nthat, after banging, he heard movement. Any innocent\nperson at 10:00 at night would have to move in order -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you this? It\nmight -- it might make a difference to me whether the\npolice demanded entry prior to the time when the alleged\nexigent circumstances arose. And the only testimony on\nthis point that I am aware of is on pages 22 and 23 of\nthe appendix, when police banged on the door as loud as\nthey could and announced \"Police, police, police,\" and\nthen Detective Maynard banged on the door and said \"This\nis the police.\"\nNow, is there any -- anything more in the\nrecord? Any evidence that they -- prior to the time\nwhen they heard what they allegedly heard, that they\nsaid \"Open the door\"?\nMS. DRAKE: The portion of the Joint\nAppendix that I quoted to the Court -- we explained to\nthem we were going to make entry -- appears on page 24.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Right.\nMS. DRAKE: So, if Your Honor keeps\nreading -\nJUSTICE ALITO: It starts -- it says: We\nknew that there was possibly something that was going to\nbe destroyed inside the apartment. At that point\nDetective Maynard -- this is after they heard the\nsounds, after they claim to have heard the sounds.\nMS. DRAKE: Yes. Officer Cobb's testimony\nsuggests that the demand came after they heard the sound\nof movement. The finding by the trial court, however,\nis that this was all happening simultaneously and in\nvery quick fashion.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is there any -- is there any\nevidence of that? Did anybody else testify to what\nhappened?\nMS. DRAKE: No, Your Honor. Officer Cobb's\ntestimony was -- was all the Commonwealth offered.\nBut the chronology of the demand is not\ndispositive in this case because the demand itself is\nnot dispositive. The demand removes any doubt that the\nofficers were not seeking a consensual encounter, but\nyou still have the behavior of banging on the door.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, does it -- does it\nturn on how loudly they knocked? If they just knock on\nthe door and say \"This is the police,\" is -- is that -\nis there anything wrong with that?\nMS. DRAKE: It -- it depends entirely on\nwhether a reasonable person would interpret that\nbehavior as the officer conveying the impression that\nentry was imminent and inevitable. And this feeds back\nto Justice Scalia's question, which is, well, what -\nwhat is unreasonable about what the officers did here?\nJUSTICE ALITO: What was there here to make\na reasonable person believe that -- that entry was\nimminent and inevitable, if -- if all that's done is a\nknock on the door and they say \"Police, police, police,\nthis is the police\"? Maybe it turns on how loudly they\nspoke or how loudly they -- they knocked; is that the\npoint?\nMS. DRAKE: That is the point. Those are\nall relevant criteria because, in every Fourth Amendment\ncase, we're considering the totality of the\ncircumstances.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me that\nyou're trying to change the case. I mean, this is not a\ncase where they come in and, in effect, demand entry.\nMy understanding is that the issue in the case is\nwhether or not, after a request for entry, they can then\nbase probable cause in dispensing with the warrant based\non what they hear from behind the door.\nNow, I know you think that they -- whatever\nthey hear is perfectly innocent; but the issue is\nwhenever they knock on the door, \"Police\" or \"Can we\ncome in\" or whatever, and then they hear that, the\nactivity behind the door, they have reason and can -\ncan enter.\nNow, what you're -- it seems to me what\nyou're arguing is, well, they did something else. They\nbanged on the door, they yelled \"Police\"; it wasn't\nsimply knocking on the door and seeking entry. And you\nmay be right, again, on the facts, but it seems to me\nthat's for -- for later on.\nI want to know what your position is on\nwhether they can assume, at least for me, they knock and\nsay \"Can we come in\" or knock and say \"Police\" -- no\ndemand to get in.\nMS. DRAKE: If I understand Your Honor's\nquestion, the officers are engaging in what we would\ncall a true \"knock and talk.\" They're seeking --\nthey're on -- the scenario is such that no one would\ndoubt they're attempting a consensual encounter.\nOur position is because that behavior is\nreasonable, it is not made unreasonable by the fact that\nevidence may be destroyed, and so suppression would not\nbe the remedy. Well, then, here -\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So you agree\nthat -- that the court below is wrong because what they\nsay, as I read it, is irrespective of how reasonably the\npolice behave, if it is reasonably foreseeable that\ntheir tactic will create exigent circumstances -- and I\nwould think it's reasonably foreseeable, when you knock\non the door very politely and say \"The police,\" that\nsomebody might shout out \"Hide the pot\"; all right?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: That if that's reasonable\nforeseeable, says the court, then that violates the\nFourth Amendment. But we have the Second Circuit that\nsays as long as the police behaved unlawfully, it -\nlawfully, lawfully -- it does not violate the Fourth\nAmendment; and we have the First Circuit that has some\nkind of bad-faith test plus an unreasonable or improper\ntest; and we have the Fourth and Eighth circuits that\nyet have some different kind of test.\nAnd one of the things I'd be interested in\nhearing your view on at some point is just what the\nChief Justice said, that assuming from your point of\nview this is a hypothetical case, nonetheless we would\nlike your view on which of those tests or some other\ntest is the appropriate test and why. That was the\nquestion he started with and Justice Kennedy started\nwith, and I'd also be interested in your view on that.\nMS. DRAKE: The appropriate test is the test\nthat we propose. Under our test, the police act\nunreasonably when they convey the impression to an -- to\na reasonable person that entry is imminent and\ninevitable. Our test follows directly from the Fourth\nAmendment requirement that people in their homes deserve\nprecision.\nBy conveying the impression that entry is\nimminent and inevitable, the police are -- and they\ndon't have judicial authority for doing that -- there -\nthere's no warrant -- they are engaging in behavior that\nwould confuse an ordinary citizen and make him or her\nuncertain about whether the assertion of right to\nprivacy and security in the home -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Ms. Drake if that's\nthe case, in some way you're agreeing with the\nGovernment. You, too, are saying that -- that there's a\nlawfulness test. You're just disagreeing about what's\nlawful.\nMS. DRAKE: And to the extent that \"lawful\"\nis defined as a synonym for \"unreasonable\" and to the\nextent that there does not need to be a completed\nantecedent Fourth Amendment violation, we would agree.\nThere is area of agreement between the Commonwealth and\nI, and it is on the issue of this \"knock and talk.\" Of\ncourse, police officers need to have the investigative\ntool of a knock and talk. There's nothing wrong with an\nofficer attempting to gain consensual entry. And our\nposition is that that's not made unreasonable by factors\noutside the officer's control, no matter how\nforeseeable.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So what took this outside of\nthe category of the ordinary knock and talk?\nMS. DRAKE: This is not a knock and a -\nknock and talk case; this is a knock and announce case\nor a knock and demand case, which is how the trial court\ncharacterized it. And the staff -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I don't know about the\nlabels, but what did they -- what did the police do that\nwent beyond what would be permitted under your\nunderstanding of a pure knock and talk? It's -- it's\nthe volume of the -- of the knocking?\nMS. DRAKE: Yes, it's the -- it's the\nbanging, not knocking. It's announcement -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Banging, not knocking?\nMS. DRAKE: Banging, not a soft -- not the\nknock that you would expect a reasonable person to\nengage in, in the ordinary discourse with another\nperson, or that you would expect from an officer\nattempting to gain consensual -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But I -- you -- you might\nhave considerable support on the Court for the\nproposition that if the exigent circumstance is created\nby unlawful activity by the police, which would include\nconveying the impression that they are about to kick the\ndoor in, then -- then you have a different case. But -\nbut I thought the case we had before us is what if the\npolice officers are behaving perfectly lawfully and\nthey're not threatening to kick down the door, and they\nsmelled the marijuana and then they hear the motion\ninside, does that justify their going in?\nAnd that's what I thought we took the case\nfor, and that's a different question. You're trying to\n-- you're trying to make the police officers' actions\nunlawful, and I will stipulate that if their actions\nwere unlawful you have a different case, and probably\nthe evidence would have to be suppressed, but I didn't\nthink we were here to decide that, whether they knocked\ntoo loud, whether they threatened to kick in the door.\nThe opinion below says if they created the exigent\ncircumstances, whether they did so lawfully or\nunlawfully, they cannot go in. And that's, that's the\nissue.\nMS. DRAKE: What the officers did in this\ncase is the functional equivalent of saying \"We're going\nto kick in the door.\" Now, I wouldn't go that -- that\nfar, but it -- it's the functional equivalent of a knock\nand announce, which is exactly the behavior the police\nengage in when they are executing a warrant. And it is\nthat behavior that conveys the impression that an\noccupant has no authority to keep the officers at arm's\nlength.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That wasn't the basis for\nthe decision below, though. The court below didn't say\nthese police officers were behaving as though they had a\nwarrant and were about to kick in the door. The opinion\nbelow just said, yes, there were exigent circumstances,\nbut they were the result of the police knocking on the\ndoor and saying \"We're the police.\"\nMS. DRAKE: I don't disagree that the lower\ncourt did not analyze the problem in this fashion, did\nnot analyze the question in this fashion, but it's a\nlegal question that calls for an examination of how a\nreasonable person would interpret the behavior, and\nso -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But what does that have\nto do with the -- the police officers' lawfulness? Now,\nI -- I grant you that attempting -- that there is\nsomething troubling about the police attempting to\ncoerce entry as opposed to requesting entry, but as my\ncolleagues have pointed out, it's not clear from this\nrecord which of the two the police did, in a loud voice\nor not.\nYou're saying just a loud knock, a scream,\n\"Police,\" that that would be coercive? That's how I'm\nreading you.\nMS. DRAKE: I -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or -- or are you going\nfurther and trying to say that, as a matter of fact, the\ntestimony's critically clear that they knocked loudly,\nsaid \"Police,\" and said \"Let us in or we're going to\nbust it\"?\nMS. DRAKE: The factual record is clear.\nThe -- Officer Cobb testified he banged as loud as\npossible. This is -- this not the normal knock that an\nofficer engages in when he's seeking consensual -\nconsent, you know, consent to search, and this is at\n10:00 at night. He's saying we announced \"Police,\npolice, police!\" -- exclamation point. That -- that's\nhow it appears in the record. Again -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So just assume, for\nmy sake, that the police comes to the door. It's not\n10:00 at night; it's, you know, 6:00 at night. Knocks\nquietly on the door and says \"We're the police. Can we\ntalk?\" And then there was the smell of marijuana. And\nthen he hears the sounds that do convey to a reasonable\npolice officer that evidence is being destroyed. At\nthat point can they enter without a warrant?\nMS. DRAKE: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But you said -- just add on\nto that. Look, the question presented that they raised:\nWhich of the five tests currently being used by the U.S.\ncourt of appeals is proper? Now, you've said something\nabout your view on that, but I'd like you to say\nanything else you'd like to say about that, which of the\nfive tests, or some sixth test if you like, and you tell\nme the words that you would like us to use when we\nanswer that question.\nMS. DRAKE: I would like this Court to adopt\nthe test that we have proposed.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Which is?\nMS. DRAKE: Which is that an officer acts\nunreasonably when he or she conveys the impression that\nentry into a home is imminent and inevitable.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. But the test\nyou're using there, the key word is \"unreasonable.\"\nMS. DRAKE: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. And the reason you\nchoose the word \"unreasonable\" rather than the Second\nCircuit's test of \"unlawful\" is?\nMS. DRAKE: Because, frankly, I'm not sure\nwhat that means, and I think that's become clear in the\ncontext of this briefing. Does \"unlawful\" mean the\npolice have had to violate a portion of the penal code?\nDoes \"unlawful\" mean, as the Commonwealth is contending,\nthat there has to be a completed Fourth Amendment\nviolation -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You know -- you\ndon't know what -\nMS. DRAKE: -- the seizure went forward.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't know what\n\"unlawful\" means, but you know what \"unreasonable\"\nmeans.\nMS. DRAKE: Yes. Unreasonable is the\ntouchstone of every, you know, Fourth Amendment case,\nand so we're saying there does not have to be an\nantecedent completed Fourth Amendment violation. The\nquestion is, as is the case in every Fourth Amendment\ncase, did the officers act -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have any doubt that\nit's unlawful for a police officer to threaten to burst\ninto a home?\nMS. DRAKE: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So why do you need\nunreasonable? If, indeed, there -- there was a threat\nof imminent entry -- we're going to bust down the -- if\nthat was the threat, then it's unlawful, surely.\nMS. DRAKE: Yes, and that's why my answer to\nJustice Kagan's question was to the extent that\n\"unlawful\" and \"unreasonable\" are synonyms, we would\nagree.\nNow, if the Court is not terribly -- does\nnot find our test convincing, the next-best test, we\nbelieve, is a foreseeability test.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is your test is something\nnovel? I mean, Justice Breyer mentioned that there are\nsome five tests in the different circuits, and the\nforeseeability test is the one that the Kentucky Supreme\nCourt used, but is your -- does your test coincide with\nthe tests of any other circuits, or is it different?\nMS. DRAKE: Our test is a novel test. It\nhas not been, to my knowledge, considered by any of the\nother circuits.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But your test is -- I mean,\nit's not wild. It just says it says \"unreasonable\" in\nthe Fourth Amendment. Probably when they act lawfully,\nthey are acting reasonably and not unreasonably, but it\ncould be sometimes they're not. That's your view?\nMS. DRAKE: That's correct, and by the\nway -\nJUSTICE BREYER: No test. All right.\nMS. DRAKE: -- we're not saying that -\nwe're essentially saying the police shouldn't act as\nthough they have a warrant when they don't have one,\nwhich is exactly what they did in this case. And that\nproposition is not new. In Bumper, this Court made\nclear that if the police act as though they have a\nwarrant when they don't have one, any consent would be\ncoerced.\nSo reviewing courts are already making these\ndeterminations about how loud was the knock and how\naggressive was the demand, simply in another context.\nAnd by the other -- on the other hand, police officers\nare already receiving the same instruction that they\nwould need in order to apply our rule, which is, don't\nact as though you have a warrant. Don't engage in the\nfunctional equivalent of a knock and announce if you do\nnot have prior judicial authority.\nAnd what is appealing about our test, unlike\nthe foreseeability test, which we believe it's a\nrefinement of, is it allows for conduct by the police\nthat's reasonable at its inception to remain reasonable\nregardless of the suspect's response, no matter how\nforeseeable.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is -- what is\nan example of conduct that you would consider\nunreasonable resulting in suppression of the evidence\nthat would not be unlawful?\nMS. DRAKE: Well, it's very hard -- it's\nvery hard to conceive of where the daylight would be -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMS. DRAKE: -- between those terms,\n\"reasonable\" and \"unlawful,\" so long as \"unlawful\"\ndoesn't mean violation of a penal code provision and so\nlong as it doesn't mean, as the Commonwealth is\nsuggesting, that there has to be -- that the defendant\nwould have to first demonstrate that the police were\nseized in order to be able to convincingly argue that\nthe search was unreasonable.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you can't -\ncan't give me one example of some conduct that's\nunreasonable under your test that would not be unlawful?\nMS. DRAKE: I can't -- I can't think of one,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The problem is that as\nreasonable as the test is, it's not the test that was\nused by the court below, and you want us to affirm the\ndecision below, which simply said if the exigent\ncircumstances are -- are the consequence of the police\naction, whatever the police action was -- lawful,\nreasonable, whatever -- the evidence has to be excluded.\nHow can we affirm that decision as you want\nus to do, even -- even applying your test?\nMS. DRAKE: Well, the factual record in this\ncase is fully developed, and how a reasonable person\nwould interpret the scenario is a mixed question of law\nand fact, which -- this Court would review the decision\nof the Kentucky Supreme Court in that regard de novo\nanyway. In that regard, it's no different than any\nother case that makes its way to this Court where this\nCourt is asked to review the record, make a\ndetermination of how an ordinary person would interpret\nthe officers' conduct.\nIt is simply unreasonable and unlawful for\npurposes of the Fourth Amendment for an officer to\nconvey the impression that he has the authority of a\nwarrant when he doesn't have one and when that prompts,\nas it obviously would, an occupant of a home to move,\nand then that movement is used as evidence that exigent\ncircumstances exist and warrantless search is justified.\nIf this Court were to, you know, adopt the framework the\nCommonwealth is arguing for, the exception to the\nwarrant requirement would be the rule.\nSo we would ask this Court to affirm the\ndecision of the Kentucky Supreme Court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Farley, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSHUA D. FARLEY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FARLEY: My time is short, so I would\njust like to make a few quick points.\nI believe Mr. Chief Justice and Justice\nKennedy were absolutely, absolutely correct. The\nquestion before this Court is: Can lawful police action\nimpermissibly create exigent circumstances? And the\nanswer to that question is no.\nThere is never a circumstance in which\nlawful police behavior under a Fourth Amendment analysis\ncan impermissibly create an exigency. I would point the\nCourt to Hodari D., which I believe Justice Scalia wrote\nfor the Court, that we should not punish police officers\nfor attempted Fourth Amendment violations or Fourth\nAmendment violations that do not reach fruition, because\nit does not serve the point of the exclusionary rule.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Farley, one of the\npoints of the Fourth Amendment is to ensure that when\npeople search your home, they have a warrant. And, of\ncourse, there are exceptions to that. But if there is\none place where the warrant requirement has real force,\nit's in the home.\nAnd I think that the concern here -- and you\nhave some strong arguments on your side, but the concern\nhere is that your test is going to enable the police to\npenetrate the home, to search the home, without a\nwarrant, without going to see a magistrate, in a very\nwide variety of cases, that all the police really have\nto say is: We saw pot, we heard noise. Or: We think\nthere was some criminal activity going on for whatever\nreason, and we heard noise.\nHow do you prevent that from happening? How\ndo you prevent your test from essentially eviscerating\nthe warrant requirement in the context of the one place\nthat the Fourth Amendment was most concerned about?\nMR. FARLEY: Well, Justice Kagan, I would\ndisagree with you. I don't think that it would. I\nbelieve that what the Commonwealth is asking for is no\nmore or no less than reviewing courts have done for\ngenerations. You look to determine whether there was a\nFourth Amendment violation, whether there was an\nunlawful entry, whether there was an unlawful seizure,\nor whether there was a coercion that then they gained\nconsent for entry.\nIf those things occurred, they are clearly\nFourth Amendment violations. There should be a\nsuppression of the evidence. The exigent\ncircumstances -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It wouldn't technically be\na Fourth Amendment violation, would it, if the police\ngave the impression that they had a warrant and were\nabout to kick in the door? Is that a Fourth Amendment\nviolation in and of itself?\nMR. FARLEY: I don't believe so.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So your -- the -- the\nunlawfulness test would not prevent that then?\nMR. FARLEY: No, Justice Scalia, it would\nnot.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It would not prevent it?\nMR. FARLEY: It would not prevent -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, whoa. Maybe we have to\ncome up with an unreasonable test, then.\nMR. FARLEY: Well, I believe, under\nHodari D., if the officers demand entry and there is no\nresponse to that demand, there is no -- been no\ncompletion of the Fourth Amendment violation. The\nofficers could stand outside the door -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, it's perfectly okay for\nofficers to do that? To pretend that they have a\nwarrant and \"Open the door or we'll kick it in\" -\nthat's perfectly okay?\nMR. FARLEY: Well, I believe that there are\n-- there are large restrictions and prohibitions to\nthat, that officers are well aware of, because if the\nperson does answer the door, the officers know, well,\neverything is going to be suppressed. Or if the\nofficers do -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But why? You say that what\nthey've done is not unlawful. Why would it be\nsuppressed?\nMR. FARLEY: Well, if they demand entry and\nentry is given, that is then a Fourth Amendment\nviolation, because they've demanded entry without a\nwarrant. And in that case, suppression -- once they\nhave entry, the evidence would be suppressed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they can't gain\nentry by deception. They can't knock on the door and\nsay \"Pizza\"; right?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FARLEY: No.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no? Okay.\nMR. FARLEY: We would just assert that under\nthe lawfulness test, we aren't asking for anything more\nor less than this Court has done or other reviewing\ncourts have done for generations, and this is a simple\nFourth Amendment analysis.\nThere was no demand in this case. This was\na simple knock-and-announce case, regardless of the time\nof day. There was no coercion. There was no seizure.\nThere was no consent given. Officers should not be held\naccountable for unlawful reactions by suspects.\nThank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nYou will have noticed that Justice Kennedy\nleft the bench a few minutes early. He is going to\nTucson to represent the Court as the Circuit Justice for\nthe Ninth Circuit at the memorial service there. He\nwill review the tapes and transcripts of the rest of the\nargument and fully participate in the decision.\nThis case is submitted.\n(Whereupon, at 11:58 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n26:3 agrees 21:13 34:22 arose 16:9 35:18 27:24\nalert 12:25 answering 13:15 arrest 17:16,24 bad-faith 24:23\n55:23 35:15 36:6,9,19 28:7 arrests 34:16 28:10 39:22\n51:16,16 41:20 42:2 30:8 41:5 46:25 articulate 20:22 32:23 33:16\n35:17 anyway 50:17 asked 11:13 44:21\nallow 24:21 6:6 12:15 13:6 asking 22:3,14 37:3 42:1,2,3\n47:2 48:4 alternative 24:6 21:18 23:2,4 ask-for 17:23 based 10:21 11:2\n25:7 32:16 33:7,8,17 assert 6:1 55:3 14:5 15:24\n23:12,13 24:12 APPEARANC...
