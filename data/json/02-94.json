        "content": "(10:07 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in No. 02-94, William Overton v. Michelle Bazzetta.\nMr. Casey.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS L. CASEY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. CASEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court, the lower courts in this case were wrong for\ntwo reasons. First, because the Constitution does not\ngive prison inmates a right to receive in-person visits\nsince that activity is inherently inconsistent with the\nstatus as a prisoner and with legitimate penological\nobjectives and second, because the Michigan visitation\nrules are rational and reasonably related to legitimate\npenological interest.\nThe Court has recognized the right of intimate\nassociation with certain people in certain circumstances\noutside of the prison context in cases such as Roberts v.\nUnited States Jaycees.\nIn Turner v. Safley, the Court examined the\nquestion of how to evaluate a right which is recognized\noutside of the prison context and determine whether it\napplies inside the prison.\nThe right there was the right to marry. The\nCourt said you should look at the elements or incidents of\nthe rights to determine whether it is affected by\nincarceration or the pursuit of legitimate corrections\ngoals. In Roberts, the Court also identified several\nattributes of the right of intimate association which\nrespondents assert.\nThese rights include a high degree of\nselectivity and decisions regarding the affiliation,\nseclusion from others, relative smallness of the group.\nOur contention is that all of the these\nattributes are significantly affected by incarceration and\nthey are inherently inconsistent with incarceration. And\nso the --\nQUESTION: Well, does the right to association\nwhile in prison survive in some form, do you think?\nMR. CASEY: In -- the right to have the\nrelationship which is what was actually at issue in Safley\nwith marriage and in the Jones case with prisoner -- with\nthe union membership. That status can survive. There's\nno effect on the relationship here. What this case is\nabout is activity --\nQUESTION: Noncontact visits, aren't we talking\nabout here?\nMR. CASEY: Noncontact visits but it involves\nactivities inside the secure prison walls in furtherance\nof the relationship. There's no impact on the\nrelationship itself, the question is, can prison officials\n-- do the necessities of prison have an impact on the\nright of association.\nQUESTION: What would exist outside -- what\nrelationship are you talking about?\nMR. CASEY: The relationships that the prisoners\nare asserting are family members beyond the definition of\nthe Michigan prison system -- has adopted particularly\nminor nieces and nephews. One of the problems with --\nQUESTION: Well, presumably children of the\nprisoner are included, are they not?\nMR. CASEY: Children of the prisoner are\nincluded within the definition --\nQUESTION:\naccompanied by, what is it, a legal guardian?\nMR. CASEY: By a family member within the\ndefinition or a legal guardian, that's the Michigan\nregulation.\nQUESTION: As I understand it, the regs\noriginally would have prohibited visits from minor\nsiblings of the prisoner and that has been changed by\nstatute; is that correct?\nMR. CASEY: There was a statute passed, right at\nthe close of the district court opinion that permitted the\nDepartment to permit visits by siblings, the Department\nchanged the regulation to include siblings, minor sibling\nvisits, so that issue is no longer before the courts.\nQUESTION: Excuse me. I'm sorry.\nMR. CASEY: Pardon.\nQUESTION: On the class of visitor eligibility\nthen, what we're arguing about is nieces and nephew, minor\nnieces and nephews?\nMR. CASEY: That is the class with respect to\nminor children, they also have a contention about former\ninmates and --\nQUESTION: That's, that's what I meant. What is\nthe State's interest in -- in restricting visits from\nminor nieces and nephews of the prisoner?\nMR. CASEY:\nuniformly that there were serious overcrowding problems,\nprison management problems, concerns about safety, so the\noverriding interest was to reduce the volume of visitors.\nQUESTION: So it's simply a means of reducing\nvolume? There's nothing peculiar to the niece/nephew\nrelationship?\nMR. CASEY: That's correct.\nQUESTION: You just want to keep the numbers\ndown and this is one way to do it.\nMR. CASEY: To keep the numbers down, the\nDepartment is permitted to draw lines. And that is to\ndraw a line --\nQUESTION: Is it also of some concern with the\nactivities of children within the prison as opposed to\nadults?\nMR. CASEY: Oh, absolutely. That -- there was\n-- there is extensive testimony that not only was there a\nproblem with overcrowding and management, just because of\nthe volume in general, but particularly, because of\nchildren.\nQUESTION: Mr. Casey, I would like to back up to\ngo where you were when you were responding to Justice\nO'Connor's question. Do I take it that your position is\nwhatever rights there may be to have a relationship, for\nexample, by telephone call, correspondence, there is\nabsolutely no right to any visitation, even noncontact, so\nthat whatever you permit is a matter of administrative\ngrace? Is that your starting position?\nMR. CASEY: Yes. In response to --\nQUESTION: There is no right to visitation,\nnoncontact visitation at all?\nMR. CASEY: That's correct.\nQUESTION: So everything that we're arguing\nabout -- you -- in your view of this is a matter of\nadministrative grace?\nMR. CASEY: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Do you have a fallback position from\nthat? And if so, what is it?\nMR. CASEY: The Court specified three issues and\nthe first issue is whether there is a right to visitation\nat all. Our position on that question is there is no\nconstitutional right. It's a privilege. It's not a\nright.\nThe second question was whether assuming there\nis some limited right, are the Michigan regulations\nrational and reasonably related to legitimate\ncorrectional goals.\nQUESTION: Mr. Casey, would you explain -- you\nhave been very clear of what is your position about --\nround one of this case in the lower courts, when you\nclarified that your regulations went only to contact\nvisits and then you came around and said it applies to all\nvisits.\nMR. CASEY: The way the case evolved -- the\nregulations on their face apply to all visitation. The\nrestrictions apply to both contact and noncontact. When\nthe case was initially filed, there were motions for\nsummary judgment. There was a 3-day hearing on that\nmotion and most of the testimony that was introduced\nrelated to contact visitation. So when the case first\nwent to the court of appeals, the court of appeals\nmistakenly viewed the case as relating only to contact\nvisitation.\nQUESTION: Well, I got the impression that the\nState had represented that they -- that they covered only\ncontact visitation?\nMR. CASEY: There were statements in the brief\nreferring to contact visitation, largely because that was\nthe evidence that was adduced at the summary judgment\nproceeding. But the complaint challenged the regulations\nin their entirety. And the parties, I believe, understood\nthat it applied to both contact and noncontact.\nQUESTION: But the Court thought it only applied\nto contact visitation --\nMR. CASEY:\nopinion it held that it applied only to contact. Then it\nwent back to the district court and then we had longer\ntrial, more elaborative evidentiary proceeding.\nQUESTION: In the district court the first time\naround the district court didn't think it was limited to\ncontact?\nMR. CASEY: The district court dismissed the\ncomplaint in its entirety on our motion. There was no\nmisrepresentation. There may have been some unintentional\nstatements which led the court of appeals to conclude in\nthe first view --\nQUESTION: But the district court understood\nthat it was dismissing the complaint with respect to any\nvisitation, contact and noncontact, or we just don't know?\nMR. CASEY: The first order of the district\ncourt dismissed the complaint in its entirety. And the\ncomplaint, the initial complaint, did not say we are\nchallenging only contact. The -- as I say, because of the\nway the summary judgment evidence went in, it evolved that\nthe -- the court of appeals thought it was related only to\ncontact. But the rules on their face don't make a\ndistinction between contact and noncontact.\nQUESTION: May I ask this question? The rules as\nI understand are at page 174 of the appendix of the cert\npetition and they don't tell us anything, at least I\ncouldn't find anything, about the number of visits a\nperson can have or how often. Do the rules regulate that\nthe number of times a particular visitor may visit an\ninmate?\nMR. CASEY: Yes. At page 111 of the joint\nappendix, there's a memorandum that was issued in April of\n1995, which sets out hours of visitation for different\ninstitutions -- it varies between institutions.\nQUESTION: 111 of the joint appendix?\nMR. CASEY: Of the joint appendix.\nQUESTION: I see.\nMR. CASEY: Yes. And it varies -- excuse me,\nYour Honor.\nQUESTION: It limits the number at any one time.\nBut does it limit, you know, you can only have so many\nvisitors a month?\nMR. CASEY: Yes.\nQUESTION: Why isn't that sufficient to solve\nthe problem of overcrowding and too many -- too many\npeople? If -- if you have too many people, an easy way to\nsolve it is just to reduce the number of visits each one\nof the inmates is allowed to have per month.\nMR. CASEY: That would have been one solution.\nThe Department chose a solution where they evaluated the\nvisitors and concluded that it would be best to make\nquality visits for close family members following\nessentially --\nQUESTION: Is there any evidence they found out\nhow many nephews and nieces would be excluded by the rules\nand, therefore, worked that into the quantity\ndetermination, that's a strange way to regulate quantity.\nMR. CASEY: They did not know in advance how\nmany nieces and nephews. We simply don't keep that kind\nof record.\nQUESTION: Is there a specific anti-niece -- I\ndidn't understand this case, I guess. I thought there's a\nsimple determination by the prison authorities, we don't\nwant children in the room, period. Now, we'll make an\nexception for that if they're your children.\nMR. CASEY: That's essentially what they did.\nQUESTION: And the reason had nothing to do --\nit had something to do with a lot of people, but basically\nthey think children are more dangerous to the child or\nmore disruptive, because they're younger, harder to\ndiscipline, they might run around in the room. They might\nlearn things that -- that they don't want children exposed\nto the language or behavior of the prisoners, et cetera.\nSo I just thought it was -- now maybe you're telling me,\nno no, that's not the reason it was totally different.\nMR. CASEY: No. That's --\nQUESTION: This is quite interesting to me.\nMR. CASEY: No, that's one of the bases, it\nwould possible to prohibit all children in prisons.\nQUESTION: No, they don't prohibit all children.\nThey say generally children are more of a problem than\nadults to have in visits.\nMR. CASEY: That's correct.\nQUESTION: So we draw a line. We say no\nchildren except for your own children.\nMR. CASEY: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. CASEY: That's our position.\nQUESTION: So why don't you defend it on that\nbasis, if that's what it is?\nMR. CASEY: Well, I thought I was, I'm sorry if\nI didn't make that clear, Your Honor. The Department made\ndecisions on who is to visit. And they said we are going\nto permit visits with close family members, children,\ngrandchildren, at some point they have to draw a line, as\nyou've said, Justice Kennedy -- and they drew a line to\neliminate certain extended family members.\nOne of the problems is -- is -- if the Court\nfinds that there is a right to visitation, the -- there\nwill be -- I suspect a great deal of additional litigation\non where those lines can appropriately be drawn.\nMichigan, for example, has very generous rules\nconcerning times of visitation, they permit visits on\nevenings, on weekends and holidays, some States don't do\nthat. If there's a right to visitation, I suspect there\nwill be litigation on --\nQUESTION: Is there any limit on the number of\ntimes the same person can come in a given month?\nMR. CASEY: No. There -- inmates, for example,\nin the lowest security level are entitled to eight visits\nper month. And the time is -- is not regulated either. It\ndepends on overcrowding and situations like that.\nQUESTION: What adults are permitted? Suppose I\ndon't have any children, I don't have any spouse, I don't\neven have any siblings.\nMR. CASEY: The rule permits an inmate to\ndesignate immediate family members as defined by the\nDepartment and 10 other individuals.\nQUESTION: Ten others, okay.\nMR. CASEY: Now, there are certain prohibitions,\nformer prisoners are prohibited, I think, unless they're a\nfamily member and receive the warden's permission. That\nis being challenged here as well, but --\nQUESTION: In relation to the family, this one\nlast question, a child must be accompanied by an adult and\nyou cut that back from any adult on the filing of the\naffidavit to only an immediate family member. Does an\nimmediate family member include an unwed father?\nMR. CASEY: No, it includes spouses, but it\nwould include, it would include --\nQUESTION: But an unwed father would not be a\nspouse? This is the child -- the mother is incarcerated,\nthe child is brought to visit her. Can the person who\nbrings the child be that child's biological father, maybe\neven care-giving father?\nMR. CASEY: The child can visit if the child,\nyou know, is the biological child, but the child has to be\nbrought by a member of the immediate family.\nQUESTION: But the unwed father would be a\nmember of the child's immediate family.\nMR. CASEY: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Although not of the mother's\nimmediate family?\nMR. CASEY: That's correct. Someone other than\nthe unwed mother would have to bring that child under the\nrules.\nQUESTION: The mother is in prison?\nMR. CASEY: But someone other than the unwed\nfather would have to bring --\nQUESTION: The unwed father would not qualify?\nMR. CASEY:\nQUESTION: Unless he's the guardian? Unless\nhe's the guardian?\nMR. CASEY: If he is the legal guardian, yes.\nQUESTION: If he's the legal guardian, he would?\nMR. CASEY: Yes. If the mother, the custodial\nparent, has gone through legal guardianship.\nQUESTION: That's enough family relationship\ndespite the lack of the wedding bond, he would probably be\nthe guardian, I would guess, wouldn't he?\nMR. CASEY: The guardian in fact, perhaps, but\nthe Department is permitted to insist on enough evidence\nto demonstrate the legal relationship. And, again, this\ncase is about drawing lines, and the prison officials here\ndrew reasonable lines based on a perception that they\nobserved in --\nQUESTION: This is a facial challenge not as an\nas-applied? Would an as-applied challenge be possible,\nassuming we recognize some right of visitation?\nMR. CASEY: These rules could be challenged as\nan -- on an as-applied basis but we did go through a\ncomplete trial on the merits here. There is evidence.\nOur position is we submitted evidence to\ndemonstrate the reasonable relationship under Turner v.\nSafley. So if there is a right, then we satisfied the\nrequirements of -- of permitting our rules to take -- to\ntake a --\nQUESTION: A particular person brought this\naction, did they not? Michelle Bazzetta?\nMR. CASEY: Yes. It's a class action. Inmates\nand --\nQUESTION: And she was an inmate somewhere?\nMR. CASEY: She was an inmate. So -- I have not\naddressed the Court's third question, the cruel and\nunusual punishment. If there are no questions on that,\nI'll rely on the briefs.\nAnd I would like to reserve my remaining time\nfor rebuttal.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Casey.\nMr. Lamken.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONERS\nMR. LAMKEN: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court. The right asserted here for inmates to\nreceive in-person visits other than those permitted by\nCorrections Department rules is consistent neither with\ninmate status nor with the legitimate penological\ninterests underlying Michigan's rules.\nQUESTION: But, Mr. Lamken, you are then\nagreeing with Mr. Casey that there is no right of -- no\nright to any visitation, contact, noncontact, that what\nright -- what privilege is extended is a matter of\nadministrative grace?\nMR. LAMKEN: That is our initial position, yes.\nAnd we also have two backup positions.\nQUESTION: On your initial position, in your\nview, under a scheme like this could complete discretion\nbe given to the warden to determine who gets the\nvisitation and who does not? He said, you know, you\ndidn't really -- you've been looking sloppy for a couple\nof days so I'm going to take away your visiting\nprivileges?\nMR. LAMKEN: Not necessarily. The fact that the\nFederal Constitution itself does not create a liberty or a\nproperty interest in visitation, does not preclude the\npossibility that State prison regulations or State law\nmight create that type of interest. It could not be taken\naway under --\nQUESTION: I know it isn't an issue here. But\none of the reasons I'm asking is because if the warden\ndoesn't have complete discretion, then that indicates that\nmaybe there's some right that's either conferred by the\nstatute or by the Constitution. You say the warden has\ncomplete discretion?\nMR. LAMKEN: The answer is not necessarily. And\nthat is the Court would have to examine under the\nstandards established by -- in Sandin v. Conner, whether\nor not State law provides a property or a liberty interest\nthat can't be taken away without sufficient process.\nAnd that --\nQUESTION: As you read these regulations, does\nthe warden have the complete discretion?\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, it's not a question of what\nthe content of the regulations are. That was -- Sandin v.\nConner got rid of that inquiry. Instead, the question is\nwhether it is a grievous deprivation or an adverse -- or\nexcuse me, an atypical hardship that is contrary to the\ntypical norms of incarceration.\nQUESTION: And under that standard, do you think\nthe warden should have complete discretion to deny anybody\nfor any reason visiting privileges?\nMR. LAMKEN: We think that's a very difficult\nquestion. If push came to shove, our answer would be the\nwarden should have that discretion but I should point out\nthat Bureau of Prison regulations and the State of\nMichigan both provide extensive hearing procedures before\nsuch rights are withdrawn. And such that the type of --\nfor example, in Michigan, you can challenge the underlying\nfinding of misconduct if your rights are going to be taken\naway for the minimum 2-year period ban that's at issue\nhere.\nhearing, you get administrative review, you get judicial\nreview. And we believe that those types of procedures are\ncertainly sufficient in terms of due process.\nThe answer to our question would be if push came\nto shove, we would say no, it could be a matter of --\nQUESTION: Then how would you distinguish the\nholding in Turner against Safley pertaining to the right\nto marry?\nMR. LAMKEN: On two bases, Justice Stevens.\nFirst, marriage has or can have a religious, that is free\nexercise element, and it also has an effect on property\nrights and the rights to certain benefits outside the\nprison context. Neither is true of the right to -- of\nvisitation.\nSecond, incarceration as a form of punishment\nnecessarily places a barrier between the prisoner and\nthose with whom he would otherwise associate. The very\nessence of the punishment is that separation and the\nvesting of control over exceptions to that separation, in\nthe State and corrections authority.\nMarital status in contrast, such as free\nexercise of religion, doesn't have the necessary\nrelationship to incarceration as a form of punishment.\nQUESTION: But if you say there's --\nQUESTION:\nvisitation for prisoners? Isn't that a pretty universally\naccepted practice?\nMR. LAMKEN: It is a universally accepted\npractice, that for certain prisoners under proper\nconditions, certain visits, will aid in rehabilitation and\nthat is the accepted view and one that the Bureau of\nPrisons firmly supports.\nQUESTION: Right. If you're going to release\nsomebody back into society, you don't want to cut off all\ncontact with family members or friends who might help that\nperson on release, do you?\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, that, Justice O'Connor, is a\nmatter of penological philosophy, but not a matter of\nconstitutional right. And as a matter of sound\npenological philosophy, the Bureau of Prisons, for\nexample, does allow visits. But it will restrict those\nvisits rather severely if the -- if the circumstances\nprovide. And we believe that one --\nQUESTION: Well, why isn't the Turner/Safley\nrule quite adequate here to deal with this?\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, Your Honor, you could decide\nit -- actually Turner v. Safley, as we read it has two\ncomponents. On page 95 in particular, it says that an\ninmate retains those rights that are not inconsistent with\nincarceration or with the penological interests of the\ncorrections system. And so we believe that this Court\ncould resolve it under either of the inconsistent-with-\ninmate status problem, which is to say that there is no\nright. Or it could go into the Turner v. Safley balancing\nand determine that, in fact, Michigan's rules do have the\nrequisite relationship to legitimate penological\nobjectives.\nQUESTION: But as to the first, if you're right\non the first point, which is what is disturbing about the\nfirst point, a prisoner would have no right whatsoever to\nany kind of visit or communication or association with\noutside people, even if there were virtually no\npenological reason for doing that? And that's -- why do\nyou have to go that far?\nMR. LAMKEN: Justice Breyer, I think part --when\nyou say communication, I wouldn't go that far. We are\nsaying that --\nQUESTION: You say that because that's what's\nthat the cases seem to say. Communication, association.\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, in fact, what incarceration\ncuts off and what the punishment of incarceration is is\nthe physical separation of the inmate from the rest of\nsociety. The inmate, for example, it's not inconsistent,\nfor example, for a corrections official to have authority\nto give an inmate a furlough to go outside to work for\nexample. But it is inconsistent, for an inmate to say you\nmust give me a furlough to go outside because your failure\nto do so interferes with my in-person associational\nrights. The very essence --\nQUESTION: You're thinking of cases where that's\njustified what the prison is doing. And if you win on\nyour first point, you better think of cases where the\nprison is unjustified, but it still wins.\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, I think the answer is, the\nvery essence of the punishment of incarceration is\nseparation from society and the vesting of exceptions\nthereto in corrections officials. That is the punishment\nand that is the difference between, for example, a broader\nright to communicate, which wouldn't necessarily be cut\noff. A broader right --\nQUESTION: You would say that even if -- even if\nthe prison -- even if the prison administration is\nunjustified in refusing to allow the prisoner a furlough\nout into society, even if a thoroughly trustworthy\nprisoner, you'd still say he has no right to that?\nMR. LAMKEN: Absolutely. That is the nature of\nincarceration as punishment, Justice Scalia.\nTurning to the Turner balance argument --\nQUESTION: So you say there can be solitary\nconfinement for life, if that's what the State wants?\nMR. LAMKEN: Justice Kennedy, solitary\nconfinement should be distinguished from merely cutting\noff visitors from outside. And the answer to your\nquestion is, yes, under certain circumstances, solitary\nconfinement for life would be permissible, but one would,\nas the Court has pointed out in various cases, have to --\nQUESTION: Well, then under all circumstances\nunder your view?\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, the barrier for solitary\nconfinement for life would be whether or not that's cruel\nand unusual punishment. But the reality of prison life is\nthat prisoners don't get to choose who their cellmates\nare. They don't get to choose who they bunk with. They\ndon't get to choose who they dine with. They don't get\nto choose the institution in which they're incarcerated.\nEven though each of those personal choices may be\nprotected outside.\nQUESTION: Well, presumably, the prison allows\nprisoners to send mail?\nMR. LAMKEN: Yes, that's correct.\nQUESTION: Okay. How about phone calls?\nMR. LAMKEN: In this case the prison does allow\nphone calls for outside, which are other means by which\ngeneral First Amendment community rights --\nQUESTION:\nread and write and who has -- whose family has no\ntelephone, what are they supposed to do without a contact\nvisit?\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, the Court --\nQUESTION: Or a noncontact visit?\nMR. LAMKEN: The Court actually addressed that\nin Pell, which is to say that that's not a problem unless\nthe State precludes the prisoner from getting aid in\nwriting letters. And Pell actually addressed the specific\nclaim that the prisoners were unable to write. And\nthere's no evidence in this case that the State precludes\nprisoners from getting aid in writing or reading letters\nso that they may communicate with the outside world. But\nthe --\nQUESTION: Are you saying that there is a right\nto communicate to that extent, or you've been candid and\nupfront and said there's no right to visitation.\nMR. LAMKEN: That's exactly the line we draw,\nJustice.\nQUESTION: Do you extend that as well to\ntelephone calls and writing letters?\nMR. LAMKEN: No. There may be -- there may or\nis a distinct First Amendment and societal interest in\nallowing general communications between inmates and the\noutside world.\ndistinguish between the two rights at issue. One is a\nsubstantive due process in-person associational right, and\nthe other is a more general First Amendment right to\ncommunicate or like a more general First Amendment right\nto free exercise of religion. The former is what\nincarceration cuts off. The latter is something that\nincarceration may limit but generally only to --\nQUESTION: But you would agree that the inmate\ncould be -- have a visit from his lawyer?\nMR. LAMKEN: Yes, Your Honor. The inmate would\nhave a visit from the lawyer and potentially clergy as an\nexception as well. And that's because of the distinct and\nhybrid nature of the right. It's not merely an\nassociational right, but the right to a fair trial may be\nat issue, the right to petition for redress of grievances,\nthe right to free exercise of religion may also be at\nissue in the case of clergy. That's why almost all of\nthese limits, except clergy and lawyers.\nTurning to the Turner balance, the Court below\ninvalidated the -- these rules as applied to noncontact\nvisits based on the principle that noncontact visits do\nnot raise the penological concerns that contact visits do.\nThat was incorrect for three reasons. First, many prisons\nincluding Federal Bureau of Prisons' facilities, lack\nnoncontact facilities.\nis not the type of de minimis or ready alternative this\nCourt contemplated in Turner.\nSecond, the portable noncontact booths used by\nthe State of Michigan separate the visitor from the --\nQUESTION: Are there any high-security prisons\nthat don't have noncontact facilities? I know there's\nsome --\nMR. LAMKEN: No.\nQUESTION: -- low security.\nMR. LAMKEN: No. No. In fact, the Federal\nBureau of Prisons' facilities, if they are high security\nor pretrial detention centers, they will have noncontact\nfacilities. If they are lower security --\nQUESTION: Well, shouldn't we decide the case on\nthe assumption that we're dealing with facilities that can\nhave noncontact visits?\nMR. LAMKEN: The facilities in these cases --\nmay I answer the question, Chief Justice? I see I'm out\nof time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Yes, you can.\nMR. LAMKEN: Okay. The facilities at issue in\nthese cases are portable booths, which separate the inmate\nfrom its visitor but not the visitor from all the inmates\nwho are having contact visits so they do not address the\nproblems of the child visitors having contact with\ninmates.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you Mr. Lamken.\nMs. LaBelle, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DEBORAH LaBELLE\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMS. LABELLE: Mr. Chief Justice, and if it\nplease the Court. The Court -- I would like to clarify\nquickly the administrative proceedings before we got to\ntrial in this Court, because the Court asked an inquiry.\nWe did have a 3-day trial and a preliminary injunction\nhearing and at that time the Corrections Department\nrepresented that the rules were only as to contact visits\nand the Court, recognizing that there were some smuggling\nand contraband issues, thereafter denied a preliminary\ninjunction and followed with the summary judgment, summary\ndisposition based solely on the understanding that it was\nlimiting -- these rules only limited contact visits. And\nthat's how it went to the Sixth Circuit.\nQUESTION: So there's nothing in the district --\nin the district court's opinion or order that clarifies\nthat?\nMS. LABELLE: No. The district court ruled only\nwith regard to thinking it was contact and the Sixth\nCircuit accepted it that way, when it became clear, when\nit was sent down, that the visits were being applied to\nban all visits for certain categories of people, we asked\nfor a rehearing in the Sixth Circuit, they used a\nclarifying opinion and then said that, no, the\njustification is given for limiting contact visits,\nsmuggling and contraband did not suffice for limiting all\nvisits for these categories of visitors.\nQUESTION: Did the case go to the Sixth Circuit\ntwice?\nMS. LABELLE: Yes, Your Honor.\nIt went to the Sixth Circuit after a whole --\nfirst on the initial preliminary injunction, then it went\nback down, it was tried on the issue of noncontact visits\nand the permanent ban. The permanent ban, Mr. Chief\nJustice, was not tried in the first go-around, because\nthey indicated that they had not yet implemented it in any\nform, so it was not yet right.\nQUESTION: Is that particular procedural history\nsignificant in what we decide on the issues before us?\nMS. LABELLE: I think that it is not\nsignificant, only to clarify one point, the issue of\nwhether the siblings are before this Court. It was after\nthe district court's decision that the Department chose to\npass -- that a rule was passed voluntarily allowing the\nDepartment to allow siblings in, which they have, but they\nhave put a position throughout the case and up through the\nSixth Circuit that they had the right, at any time, to\nwithdraw that voluntary choice to allow siblings. So I\nthink the siblings issue is still very much before this\nCourt.\nQUESTION: But their position is they have the\nright to say no to all children?\nMS. LABELLE: That's correct, Your Honor,\nincluding siblings, children, that it is all a matter of\ndiscretion.\nQUESTION: So their position is not different\nwith respect to a child, a grandchild, a sibling. They\nsay whatever we want to do, it's up to us to do in our\njudgment and you have no right at all, whatever you get is\na privilege.\nMS. LABELLE: That's correct, Your Honor.\nAnd I think that that is why the case has gotten\nso far. It is because that the insistence that families\nand prisoners do not retain the rights of intimate\nassociation past the prison door.\nQUESTION: Is it unconstitutional then, and this\nis why I'm reluctant to get this Court into a whole new\nline of constitutional law -- is it unconstitutional to\nsend a prisoner from the East Coast to a prison far\nremoved from his family and friends?\nMS. LABELLE:\nQUESTION: Why not?\nMS. LABELLE: Because that is a collateral\nconsequence of something that happens to prisoners. They\nget moved. They get transferred. This Court addressed\nthat in Olim. That's not what happened.\nQUESTION: Suppose they do it for the purpose of\ndenying the prisoner the contact?\nMS. LABELLE: I think that if they are targeting\nthe intimate associational rights at issue, if that is the\npurpose that we are going to target the intimate\nassociational rights, then a fundamental right has arisen\nand then it's a Turner question.\nQUESTION: You're not targeting the rights.\nTheir object is not to cut off those rights. Their object\nis to reduce the number of children in the room, to reduce\nthe number of visitors, just as in the other case, their\nobject is to use prison facilities that are more -- that\nare cheaper, that are -- that are more readily available,\nso they send the inmates somewhere else.\nBut if you have a constitutional right to the --\nto the visitations you're talking about, it doesn't seem\nright to me that you should be able to be removed from the\npeople who could possibly visit you.\nMS. LABELLE: I think that, Your Honor, what's\ngoing on here is that the decision to slice deeply into\nthe family and to make that decision as to who gets to\nvisit and who doesn't goes directly to, and that's exactly\nwhat they did, they said, here are minors and we're going\nto select out certain intimate associations, we're going\nto slice --\nQUESTION: We're going to have to pass on one by\none nieces, nephews, grandchildren, illegitimate children,\nchildren of -- one by one, all of these are constitutional\nquestions, on the theory, I suppose, that what is truly\nstupid must be unconstitutional.\nMS. LABELLE: I think you don't have to for two\nreasons, Your Honor. One I think if this Court affirms\nthat the intimate associational rights that are at issue\nhere do pass through the doors for the families, that you\nwill have Departments of Corrections exercising their\ndiscretion and their expertise under Turner, which they're\nallowed to do, something that is clearly not evident here.\nThey didn't -- there is no expertise in their\ndecision.\nQUESTION: What -- what is the basis of the --\nis this some kind of a facial challenge to the whole\nscheme of regulating noncontact visits?\nMS. LABELLE: No, Your Honor. I think that --\nQUESTION: What is it? Is it an as-applied\nchallenge, of some kind?\nMS. LABELLE: Thank you, Your Honor.\nWith regard to the categorical restrictions,\nthey are challenged as both facially and as-applied under\nTurner, because I think Turner is a very fact-intensive\nquestion.\nQUESTION: Well, what -- what happened to Mrs.\nBazzetta who wrote this -- who brought this action? Did\nshe ask for all these things and was denied them?\nMS. LABELLE: The -- Your Honor, the -- it was a\nclass action. And she represented --\nQUESTION: I know it was a class action.\nMS. LABELLE: -- one of the -- what happened is\nthat she -- her sister wanted to bring in her newborn\nchild to visit Ms. Bazzetta and that would have been the\nnieces and nephews which were precluded. There were other\nclass representatives --\nQUESTION: But her sister wanted to. I mean\nshouldn't her sister have brought the action, then?\nMS. LABELLE: The -- Ms. Bazzetta was denied the\nvisit with her niece and nephew. Her sister was also a\nclass representative.\nQUESTION: Ms. Bazzetta is the inmate?\nMS. LABELLE: Is the inmate. There were --the\nclass representatives were both the prisoners on the\ninside and the family members on the outside who joined\ntogether to bring this action.\nQUESTION: And what else did Ms. Bazzetta\nchallenge that had happened to her, besides the visit from\nher sister?\nMS. LABELLE: Ms. Bazzetta challenged only the\ndenial of her ability to see her nieces and nephew. Ms.\nBunton challenged the ability to see her children. Ms.\nBarker challenged --\nQUESTION: Well, how -- how can one of them\nrepresent an entire class then if each of them is\nchallenging something different?\nMS. LABELLE: We had class representatives, Your\nHonor, that were certified as adequate to represent each\nof the interests in which we presented to the Court.\nQUESTION: Is the claim a First Amendment claim or what?\nWhat -- what is -- what provisions of the Constitution\nspecifically are you looking to?\nMS. LABELLE: With regard to the categorical\nrestrictions on the minor siblings, children, nieces and\nnephews, it is both a First and Fourteenth Amendment claim\nof intimate association, and family association. And what\nwe have said here is that the Department can make its\ndecisions to limit people. They can do it either\nneutrally by volume, they can say we're going to say\nneutrally that you can only have so many minors, just as\nthey do adults. You can only have so many minors come to\nvisit at any time and we are not going to slice into who\n-- who is your most intimate family member. Or we can do\nit with regard to the further-out reaches, which is they\ncan say cousins, I suppose, or even further, but they\ncan't go into --\nQUESTION: What, where -- where --\nMS. LABELLE: I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Where do you get this out of the\nConstitution?\nMS. LABELLE: I think that I get it from the\nCourt's decisions in Moore, in Roberts and that this Court\nhas already said that --\nQUESTION: Well, Roberts was a case involving\nwhether you can get into the Jaycees or not, not whether\nyou could get out of prison.\nMS. LABELLE: I think that you're correct,Your\nHonor, in that the Roberts edicta, which everyone has\nrelied upon in this case, is what I'm referring to. But\nMoore directly says that you have to protect certain\nintimate family relationships and by anyone's\nunderstanding of what it means to be family --\nQUESTION: Well, Moore was a zoning case. I\nmean, it had nothing to do with prisons.\nMS. LABELLE:\nYour Honor, but it did identify that there are intimate\nassociational rights involved in families choosing --\nQUESTION: But -- but when in the prison\ncontext, we've had specific cases and have tried to\narticulate some governing principles outlined largely in\nTurner v. Safley about what the prison can do and not do.\nShould we just look to that case and analyzing this rather\nthan the -- some zoning cases and other things?\nMS. LABELLE: I think that -- I think that\nTurner is the governing case in here and in fact, I think\nif -- further that if these rules, if this is not affirmed\nit would be -- do great damage to the Turner case, because\nwhat Turner says is when you have these fundamental\nrights, that then you look to extreme deference to the\nCorrections Department.\nQUESTION: But Turner assumes the question that\nwe've been immediately discussing, that there is a\nfundamental right. Before you get to the Turner\nquestions, you have to establish that there is a -- a\nright to -- to -- to visitation in prison. If you talk\nabout intimate -- the right to intimate family\nassociation, I suppose there is no more stronger right to\nintimate family association than the right of -- of -- of\na man and wife to cohabit, and that's -- that's eliminated\nin prison, unless you think that conjugal visits are\nconstitutionally required.\nDo think that they're constitutionally required?\nMS. LABELLE: No, I don't think --\nQUESTION: It's a pretty intimate family\nassociation that you're cutting off there, isn't it?\nMS. LABELLE: I think that although some States\ncertainly allow it, it's not constitutionally required,\nbecause there is two prongs of Turner. One is whether it\n-- it is inconsistent with incarceration and certainly you\ncan argue that people going outside the prison, the\nconjugal visits puts certain burdens and may be\ninconsistent with the general incarceration.\nQUESTION: You can arrange for it.\nMS. LABELLE: If every --\nQUESTION: You can arrange for it.\nMS. LABELLE: You can arrange for it. And I\nthink that you would not win under a Turner test with that\nlimit on that associational right. But here where they\nhave impinged on the associational and intimate\nassociational right in such a way but if --\nQUESTION: Well, that's where we have --Mr.\nLamken clarified that -- that there is a right of\nexpression, and that's why he said you couldn't cut off\nletters. But he maintains that there is not this right of\nintimate association, that the right doesn't exist at all.\nSo you never get into Turner v. Safley balancing. And I\nthink your first job is to establish that -- that just as\na prisoner retains a right of expression, which can be\ncurtailed drastically given incarceration, just as there\nis that interest and expression, so there is a retained\ninterest in intimate association, which can be shrunk, but\nnot totally eliminated.\nMS. LABELLE: Yes, I think that's correct,\nJustice Ginsburg.\nThe -- this -- this Court has on the outside\nrecognized that we have intimate association rights, we\nhave companionship rights. And although they may -- there\nmay be attributes of that right, that are necessarily\ndiminished by -- by having one member of your family in\nprison, the many attributes of what it means to be a\nfamily is not gone. The ability to see your -- your\nwife's face, the ability to see your child and assure that\nyou're --\nQUESTION: Well, all that is true, but I thought\n-- I thought that this case -- it's much more complicated\nthan I thought. I thought it was fairly simple, at least\nin my mind. I assume with you that Turner is the law and\nthere's some kind of constitutional right here. But I\nthought we had basically four regulations, one says no\nchildren can visit unless they're your own children. The\nsecond one says no prisoners can visit unless they're in\nyour family. The third one says that you lose those\nrights if you're on drugs, you lose them for two years if\nyou have two drug problems. And there was one other,\nwhich -- if the children come in, they have to be\naccompanied by an adult, okay? And I thought that's what\nthe regs say and, in addition, there's another reg which\nsays, warden, if you feel you need to make an exception\nfor a particular visit, you can do it. Okay?\nNow, that's what the regs were, the district\ncourt said those are unconstitutional. The court of\nappeals said that's right and I would like to know,\nassuming with you, that Turner is the law, what's\nunconstitutional about them? It strikes me as the most\nreasonable thing to say that you can't have children in a\nprison environment unless they're your own children.\nWhat's wrong with that?\nMS. LABELLE: And I think, Justice Breyer,\nwhat's wrong with that is that it's not the business of\nthe Department of Corrections to start making decisions\nonce you decide that family members and children can come\nin, that to make decisions as to which family members are\nclose -- which -- for those people who are 18, 17, 16, who\nhave no children but wanted to see their only family\nmember, which was their brother or sister, the questions\n--\nQUESTION: They've now dealt with that, I take\nit. And you're saying that -- that we should decide what\nis a totally hypothetical thing, whether a regulation in\n-- are they seeking damages? I take it they're seeking --\nMS. LABELLE: No.\nQUESTION: -- an injunction. The law is now\nthat they will let the family members in, if you have a\nbrother who's 2 years old, they can bring the brother. So\n-- so I would think that's pretty hypothetical, but any\nway, I'll consider that. What about the rest of it?\nMS. LABELLE: I think that the question is\nwhether it's reasonable to slice off certain family\nmembers and there's a penological --\nQUESTION: They say, sure, it's reasonable?\nMS. LABELLE: -- interest in doing it.\nQUESTION: Sure it's reasonable. The reasonable\nthing is we want as few children as possible. But we're\nnot prepared to say, if they're your own children, you can\nnever see them. That tome sounds like a reasonable thing.\nWhy isn't it?\nMS. LABELLE: Because it is total discretion on\nwhat constitutes the family and who comes in and it\ninterferes with the fundamental right at issue here which\nis --\nQUESTION: Can't they -- can't they regulate\ncategorically rather than just tuning it to each\nparticular family to say that your own children are in a\ndifferent class than siblings or nieces or nephews and say\none can -- I mean, the whole thing is line-drawn. You're\ngoing to draw lines or slice somewhere as you put it.\nMS. LABELLE: I think that's true that you can\ndraw lines, and you can draw lines that are content-\nneutral with regard to the family, because that's what the\nconcern was here, volume. So you can say, you can only\nhave two minors, or you can only -- on your list, or you\ncan only have five minors visit or we're going to limit\nthe number or they can say, we are only going to protect\nthe recognized intimate associations which include your\nchildren, your grandchildren, your siblings and your\nnieces and nephews.\nQUESTION: Well, of course.\nQUESTION: You say nieces and nephews are the\nsame as a child, that I guess, that's a matter of\njudgment. And I take it I can imagine a case where a\nperson and who is a prisoner would have the same\nrelationship with let's say a foster step-child or\nsomething that he's raised that I might have or you might\nhave with a natural child. But that's why I thought there\nis a reg here that permits the warden to make exceptions\nin unusual cases.\nNow, why isn't that good enough? So that if the\nwarden turns a person down, where that is the\nrelationship, then that person could complain about it and\nbring a lawsuit rather than striking down the whole reg.\nMS.re LABELLE: The -- the record in this case\nis that the warden had neither discretion or at least the\nwardens that testified felt they had neither discretion to\nallow minor siblings in and -- or do they have any\ndiscretion whatsoever with regard to the permanent ban.\nQUESTION: Of course, Ms. LaBelle, once you leap\nover the -- the prior constitutional question, as Justice\nBreyer has and go immediately to Turner v. Safley, we are\nin the line-drawing business. And it becomes a\nconstitutional question, whether it is unreasonable to\nexclude an nephew or a niece or somebody who has this, is\nas close to the prisoner as a child might be.\nWhy do we want to get in this line-drawing? Why\n-- what is the problem here? Is there any real risk that\nprisons are going to arbitrarily and unreasonably limit\nvisitation? Would -- would any prison -- or any person\ntrying to manage a prison without -- without a revolt\narbitrarily cut off visitation? It seems to me a problem\nin search of a solution.\nMS. LABELLE:\narbitrarily here, they denied all minor siblings --\nQUESTION: Solution in search of a problem. I'm\nsorry.\nMS. LABELLE: They denied -- excuse me, Your\nHonor. They denied all minor siblings coming in. They\nrestricted who can bring the child in to such an extent\nthat there were -- that children were no longer allowed to\ncome in to visit their parents. They denied all\nbiological children.\nQUESTION: What do you mean they couldn't? The\nchildren couldn't visit -- I'm now confused about the\nfacts. I have a reg in front of me, by the way, which\nsays the warden may, quote, allow a single visit between a\nperson and a prisoner and a person not on the approved\nvisitor's list as long as it's in the best interests of\nthe prisoner and there's no threat to order and security.\nNow, why is it that that reg doesn't give the warden the\npower to deal with unusual cases?\nMS. LABELLE: The testimony of the warden was if\nyou were not on the -- the visiting list, Your Honor, you\ncould come in during the time that you were waiting to get\ncleared. But if by policy you were prohibited from coming\nin, if you were a minor sibling --\nQUESTION: I don't understand.\nMS. LABELLE:\nthat if by policy you were prohibited, then there could be\nno exception to policy. There could be --\nQUESTION: He said there's no exception, if, in\nfact, a prisoner has raised a 6-year old child just as\nit's his own child, but, in fact, there's no formal\nadoption paper. So there's testimony that he would never\nlet that child in?\nMS. LABELLE: There's testimony that -- that\nthere was no ability for wardens to make exceptions with\nregard to policy decisions. If, in fact, the person had\nnot yet been able to clear and be put on the visiting\nlist, but they were allowed, those exceptions could be\nmade, but, for example, the -- the prisoner whose younger\nbrother was begging to come in after their mother had died\nand this was his only relative, the warden testified she\ncould not make an exception to that.\nQUESTION: I'm not concerned -- although I\nbelieve you also said that there were -- their own\nchildren weren't allowed in. What's the example of that?\nMS. LABELLE: The example of that was actually\nthat there was -- some testimony with regard to Justice\nGinsburg's example with regard to the -- the father of the\nchild who was unwed could not -- and who had custody of\nthe child but was not the legal guardian could not bring\nthe child in to visit.\nThere are many --\nQUESTION: No -- so, in other words, you have to\nbe the legal guardian of the child if it's not your child,\nin order to have a visit?\nMS. LABELLE: If you were not -- no. Even if it\nis your child, your biological child, you must be the\nlegal guardian, if you are not married. So that if you're\nnot married, you cannot bring -- the parent can't bring\nthe child in to visit the other parent, unless you go\nthrough the full legal guardianship proceedings. And --\nQUESTION: The relationship that counts is the\nrelationship to the prisoner, not to the child?\nMS. LABELLE: Correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And the unwed parent would not be\nrelated to the prisoner, but you have on that list, let's\nassume we're past the basic question and there is some\nconstitutional right, you have on the list a person whose\nparental rights have been terminated, and you would allow\nthat person a right that doesn't exist outside the prison,\nin other words, once a parental relationship has been\nterminated, there is no visitation right, according in the\nlarger society, but you would say that it's arbitrary in\nthe prison setting to deny that?\nMS. LABELLE: I think -- yes, Your Honor. I\nthink because it's not a right to visit, you do have a\nright on the outside to that intimate association. If --\nand here, I mean you're not precluded from intimate\nassociation with your biological child and the parent, the\nlegal parent, can make a decision can make a decision as\nto whether --\nQUESTION: Well, then it's no right of yours, if\n-- if you -- if the legal parent wants to allow someone\nwith no parental rights, but you've -- as far as the law\nis concerned, as far as any right is concerned, a person\nwho has -- whose parental rights have been terminated is a\nstranger to the child. And it's one thing to talk about\nwhat would be reasonable for a prison to do. But I don't\nknow how you get any right with respect to someone who has\nno right outside the prison?\nMS. LABELLE: I think the protection for\nintimate association on the outside is not limited to\nlegal relationships. In here are legal parents on the\noutside who are members of this class, and who were class\nrepresentatives saying, listen, the adoption here was an\nopen adoption.\nWe all agreed that this child, in the best\ninterests of this child, that it should see it -- his or\nher natural parent. And I'm making a decision that it's\nin the best interests of this child to come in and visit.\nAnd it's the prison saying -- and I have to say the prison\ndidn't say there's some reason for us to do this. They\nsaid we never thought about it. We really --\nQUESTION: So this case -- this case, in other\nwords, it sounds to me from having listened to it and\nlooked at it a little bit, it's a kind of litigation\nproblem, I mean, there's a long litigation history here of\ncontention. And perhaps extreme positions.\nBut given that, is it up to us to say, could we\nsay, look, on their face, these regs are okay, under\nTurner? If they're not -- if they're being applied in a\nway that makes really very little sense, let the\nindividual who has this unusual situation of the, you\nknow, adopted child or something like that, let him ask\nfor the visit, let him ask for an exception to be made, if\nnecessary, and then if that doesn't happen, and I would\nimagine normally, if calm prevails, it would happen, but\nif it didn't happen, then he could bring his case. Or if\nthere is such a person in this case, you could proceed\nwith that person.\nMS. LABELLE: Your Honor, assuming the right\nthat exists and we go to Turner --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. LABELLE: -- I think there has to be some\nreasonable justification for infringing on the right. In\nthe case of, for example, the biological children, the\nguardianship -- which is not just one, Your Honor, but 20\npercent of the women in prison have their kids in foster\ncare or people who cannot bring them. We're not talking\nabout one or two. We're talking about hundreds of people\nhere.\nTo the extent that they have any reason, but\nwhat they said is we just didn't think about it. They\ndidn't exercise their expertise.\nQUESTION: Ms. LaBelle, are you asking them to\nexercise their expertise on a subcategory of children\nbasis? Or are you saying as -- is your real point\nsomething you mentioned a moment ago, that once they make\na decision to allow child visitation, they've got to\nrestrict it? If they restrict it at all on what you call\n-- I think you called a content-neutral basis. And I\nbelieve you meant by that they can put a number on it,\nonly X number of children in Y period of time or something\nlike that, but they cannot -- I thought you were saying --\ndetermine subcategories of children who will be privileged\nand others that will not be.\nThat would be one answer to Justice Breyer and\none answer I guess to the problem that we've all got about\nhow are we going to manage this litigation if -- if we've\ngot to do it on a case-by-case basis. Is -- is your basic\nposition the so-called content-neutral position? All you\ncan regulate is number once you allow any in?\nMS. LABELLE: Yes, because that was the concern\narticulated. If, in fact -- I suppose there could be one\nexception. If in fact, there was some evidence of a -- of\na wild minor sibling smuggling ring and there was some\nbasis to target certain individuals, they could do it.\nBut what they said --\nQUESTION: Well, then you would say the burden\nwould be on the -- on the prison to say despite the number\nregulation, this one can't get in as opposed to the burden\non the prisoner saying despite your regulation, an\nexception ought to be made for me? You're switching the\nburden?\nMS. LABELLE: Correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: All right. Now, so --\nQUESTION: What is your authority for -- in\ncases from this Court, say, for the content neutral\nprinciple?\nMS. LABELLE: I think that the -- the authority\nis -- is Turner itself, because what they said --\nQUESTION: Does it say something about being\ncontent-neutral?\nMS. LABELLE: No, but it did say what you have\nto do is compare the rationale for the regulation that\ninfringes, you have to see if there's a reasonable\npenological purpose, are there alternatives and look at\nthe balancing.\nQUESTION: Well, do you think that's fair? You\nthink that's fair? I have children that want to visit me.\nThey are my children in -- in a stable wedlock situation,\nthey can't visit, because we've adopted an absolute number\nof children and and some of my coprisoners whose nieces\nand nephews want to visit, they have been visiting, so I\ncan't see my kids? Does that seem fair to you?\nMS. LABELLE: The -- the rules themselves, the\ntime, place and manner restriction.\nQUESTION: Well, you want an absolute number.\nKids are kids. So since some of my coprisoners are seeing\nnieces and nephews, I can't see my children. There are\njust too many.\nMS. LABELLE: I think that that wouldn't occur,\nYour Honor.\nQUESTION: It wouldn't occur?\nMS. LABELLE: Because, first if, in fact, you\nlimited the number of children down to such a minuscule\namount of minors that had no relationship with their\nconcerns with --\nQUESTION: Well, it would be anything under nine\njust on --\nQUESTION:\ntroubles.\nMS. LABELLE: But they allow that amount, Your\nHonor. What they said was we need to reduce volume by 10\nto 15 percent. And we had absolutely no problem with the\ntime, place and manner restrictions it did so. What they\ndid by this sort of overbreadth and basically because they\nfelt there were no rights at issue here, they reduced it\nover 50 percent.\nThere's -- I think that you have to look to see\nif there's a reasonable relationship here.\nQUESTION: Let me ask you --\nMS. LABELLE: -- and there's not.\nQUESTION: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to cut you\noff. Finish your --\nMS. LABELLE: No, Your Honor. Go ahead.\nQUESTION: How do you square your argument on\ncontent-neutral with respect to child visitation? With\nother visitation that might be an issue, for example, one\nof the things that's an issue here is the possible\nvisitation of other prisoners. Would you say that the\nanswer to that is that once the prison allows any adult\nvisitation, the only limitation it can place as a general\nmatter is numbers, and, therefore, the prison would have\nto object on a specific basis with the burden to establish\non a specific basis that the visitation of any prior\nprisoner would be deleterious?\nMS. LABELLE: I think that the -- what they do\nis, for adults, there's a 10 limit there.\nQUESTION: No, no, just as a threshold question,\nare you going to apply your -- your content neutral-\ntheory across the board to adults, as well as children?\nMS. LABELLE: Yes, absent there being a\nrationale or a specific security concern, which is --\nQUESTION: And it would be the burden of the\nprison to show that in a given case?\nMS. LABELLE: I think that if you're doing a\ncategorical restriction, it is their burden. If they're\ndoing --\nQUESTION: I thought you were saying the only\ncategorical restriction you can make is visitors,\nnonvisitors. When you say you can have visitors, the only\nfurther restriction is one of numbers given at least this\nprison's rationale? Is that correct?\nMS. LABELLE: No, I think that you can have\nindividual requirements as many States do with regard to a\nrational basis to say someone who has been out of this\nprison for 6 months, we're not going to allow you to come\nin, because it's -- there's a rational basis.\nQUESTION: Okay. If you're going to accept that\nkind of categorization as legitimate, what's your basis\nfor saying that in the case of child visitation, it's got\nto be content-neutral?\nMS. LABELLE: I think because --\nQUESTION: Or are you merely quantifying?\nMS. LABELLE: I think that because there was\nabsolutely no basis, the only concerns -- I think because\nit was a different -- a deference to the different\nconcerns articulated, the concern with regard to minors\nwas simply volume. There was no articulation that any\nparticular group of minors raised any specific concern.\nQUESTION: So you're -- so you're saying, look\nwe will take their rationale at their word, and if we take\nit, this is the only limitation that they could put on?\nMS. LABELLE: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Okay. And the limitation by the way\nin --\nQUESTION: But if you -- but if you spread to\nother prisoners, then you're going beyond the\nconstitutional right that you've identified as intimate\nassociation. I understand that for family. But just a\nfriend who is an ex-prisoner. How does that come with\nintimate association?\nMS. LABELLE: May I answer the question, Your\nHonor?\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:\nquestion briefly.\nMS. LABELLE: I think that the general right\nthere was both a general associational right that you have\nto companionships with loved ones as well as an equal\nprotection argument.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms.\nLaBelle.\nMS. LABELLE: Thank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Mr. Casey, you have 4\nminutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS L. CASEY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. CASEY: I would just like to clear up a\ncouple of points initially. This case is not about visits\nfrom lawyers or clergy. It's not about custody level.\nPersons can be or prisoners can be in minimum custody\nlevel and still have these visitor restrictions. So when\nJustice Kennedy referred to solitary confinement, Justice\nBreyer, excuse me, we're not talking about that. We're\njust talking about visitation.\nAnd Justice Ginsburg, I stand by my earlier\nstatements about the nature of the arguments in the\ninitial district court proceeding as it proceeded in the\nfirst court of appeals. The issue of a distinction\nbetween noncontact and contact visits simply didn't come\nup in that -- -- in the -- in those district court\nproceedings.\nQUESTION: And do I understand your position\nthat you don't get to any Turner against Safley question,\nbecause there's simply no right to beginning with, no\nright that can be shown?\nMR. CASEY: That's our initial position, yes.\nThe limitation to contact -- or to noncontact\nvisits is not a panacea. Children still present problems\nof the -- they have unique risks and burdens. When a\nguard and a visitationer is watching a child, they're\ndistracted from watching some other visitation. The\nMichigan prison system, most facilities with multicustody\nlevels have one large room for visitation. They have\ntables and chairs for the contact, along one wall, there\nwill be vending machines and along another wall, there\nwill be one or two of these temporary booths. And\nnoncontact prisoners are brought through the contact room\nto that booth. Visitors for the noncontact prisoner are\nbrought through the contact room. There's ample\nopportunity for exchange of contraband and visibility of\nother activity that's going on in this one room.\nWith respect to the argument about content-\nneutral regulations regarding children, prison officials\nare entitled to make categorical decisions. The decision\nhere is that it's better to permit the quality close\nvisits based on a parent-child relationship, partly\nbecause of limitations on time as Justice Scalia alluded\nto, there were overcrowding problems before the\nregulations were put into effect. All of the wardens\ntestified after the regulations were put into effect, the\nconditions were noticeably better.\nIn closing, I would just like to emphasize, that\nthe -- the judgment of the corrections officials here was\na valid exercise of their informed discretion regarding\nthe conditions of confinements. The courts should have\ndeferred to that, this Court has recognized deferral to,\ndeference to prison officials as an important factor.\nAnd in summary the court of appeals should be\nreversed.\nQUESTION: If you have a minute, I have one\nfactual question?\nMR. CASEY: I would be happy to.\nQUESTION: From the brief from the respondents,\nI just want this clarified, there are a certain number of\nprisoners who have families and they have children, but\nthey aren't legally married. Now from the briefs, I had\nthe impression that visits are allowed by those children,\neven though they're not legally married, unless parental\nrights have been terminated.\nargument, I had the impression that you could not have a\nvisit from such a child, period, unless you went through\nsome formal adoption procedure. Which is it?\nMR. CASEY: The -- a child of a prisoner is\nentitled to visit if they're brought by a member of the\nimmediate family or a legal guardian.\nQUESTION: Whether they're married or not\nmarried?\nMR. CASEY: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Casey.\n"
