        "content": "(11:06 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in No. 01-705, Jo Anne Barnhart v. Peabody Coal\nCompany and a related case.\nWe'll wait just a minute.\nMs. McDowell.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA B. McDOWELL\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER BARNHART\nMS. McDOWELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Coal Act states that the Commissioner of\nSocial Security shall, before October 1st, 1993, assign\neach beneficiary to a signatory coal operator or related\nperson that remains in business. That provision\nunderstood, in light of this Court's precedents,\nestablishes the deadline that is mandatory but not\njurisdictional. It does not deprive the commissioner of\nthe power or the obligation to complete the assignments\nafter that date, if necessary.\nThat understanding comports with the text and\nstructure of the Coal Act, as well as with -- with one of\nits central purposes, that to the maximum extent possible,\neach coal retiree's benefits would be paid for by a coal\noperator that actually employed that miner or a related\nperson.\nQUESTION: But that's not true. In fact, if\nlater research has showed that somebody should have been\nassigned somewhere else, you -- you don't shift the\nbeneficiaries. It -- it isn't the case that -- that this\nis designed to assure a perfect system in which somebody\nwho is responsible, no matter that a mistake was made in\nthe past, in the future that person will be reassigned the\nway he should be.\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, the statute does provide\nfor administrative review of assignment so that a coal\noperator who was assigned a miner in error could challenge\nthat before the commissioner, and if the commissioner\nfound that the assignment was erroneous, the miner could\nbe assigned to a -- a more appropriate coal operator.\nIn addition, the regulations promulgated by the\ncommissioner for the administrative review process allowed\nthe commissioner herself to reopen an assignment if she\nfound that it had been erroneous within a 1-year period.\nQUESTION: What happens to someone who wasn't\nassigned before October 1st? They're -- they're not just\nleft out in the cold, are they?\nMS. McDOWELL: No. Congress did provide a\nfallback position for all of those who weren't assigned by\nOctober 1st or -- or at any time because they had no\nformer employer or related person who remained in\nbusiness, and that is, that they will be treated as part\nof the unassigned beneficiary pool. The benefits for\nthose miners are paid from an appropriation from the AML\nFund, a fund originally created to ameliorate the problems\nof abandoned mines, and if that fund proves insufficient,\nthe funds will come from a -- a premium imposed on all of\nthe coal operators to whom beneficiaries who have been\nassigned.\nQUESTION: Ms. McDowell, there -- there is a\nsection, 9704(f)(2)(B), that deals with annual adjustment\nof unassigned premiums. And it says that if there's an\nassigned miner and the operator goes out of business in\nany given year, then that assigned miner becomes part of\nthe pool. And it doesn't matter really whether the\ninitial assignment was before the October 1 deadline or\nnot. They just go into the pool in time. And that seems\nto work somewhat against your interpretation.\nMS. McDOWELL: I think the situation addressed\nin that provision is quite different, even assuming that\nit unequivocally establishes that the commissioner\ncouldn't reassign somebody after a company went into\nbankruptcy. But assignments at the outset of the process,\nthe sorts of assignments that we're concerned with here,\nare quite different from an assignment after bankruptcy\nthat could occur 20, 30, or 40 years down the road, and\nCongress may well have been interested only in achieving a\ncorrect initial assignment at the outset and not with\ncontinuing to readjust the assignments --\nQUESTION: Well, it does show at least that\nmuch, that Congress didn't want to continue perpetually to\nadjust these things for the --\nMS. McDOWELL: Yes, that's correct. But the\nfact that the -- that Congress directed that the\napplicable percentage for calculating the assigned\nbeneficiary premium shall be adjusted in certain\ncircumstances doesn't suggest to us that Congress would\nnot have permitted it to be adjust in other -- adjusted in\nother circumstances as well that Congress may not have\nexplicitly contemplated at the time that the Coal Act was\nenacted. One of those was the fact that --\nQUESTION: Is it possible that that deadline was\nsome kind of political compromise, so to speak, at the\ntime it was passed and the operators thought, well, that's\nit? You know, after that deadline, it's fixed.\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, there's -- there's no\nindication in the text or legislative history that that\nwas contemplated. And indeed, since Congress was\nlegislating in light of this Court's opinions in Pierce\nCounty and Montalvo-Murillo, the provision could not\nreadily be understood as providing coal operators with\nthat sort of assurance.\nIn addition --\nQUESTION: Well, you -- you say Congress is\nlegislating in light of our decision in Pierce County.\nYou're -- you're just applying the general presumption\nthat Congress does that? Certainly there's -- is there\nany indication here that Congress was legislating in light\nof Pierce County?\nMS. McDOWELL: Congress didn't explicitly say\nso, no, but as, we have cited a number of statutes in our\nbriefs that made clear that when Congress wants to\nterminate an agency's authority to make decisions at a\nparticular point, Congress knows how to say so explicitly\nand it has done so in those situations. It has not done\nso here.\nQUESTION: Well, this is -- this is quite\ndifferent than Pierce County, though, at least certainly\non its facts. There you had a provision that the --\nyou're supposed to ferret out some sort of\nmisappropriations and saying that the inspector general,\nwhoever it was, was supposed to do it in 4 months. That's\nsimply a message to the agency to get going. And we -- I\nthink we said quite properly that didn't mean that you\ncouldn't ferret out this sort of thing after the 4 months.\nBut this thing has -- has somewhat different\nramifications, I think.\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, I think it's clear that\nCongress imposed deadlines, not only this deadline, but\nother deadlines in the statute, because it wanted to get\nthe new funding mechanism established by the Coal Act into\nplace. Congress wanted the assignments to be made\npromptly so that the Combined Fund could then send bills\nfor premiums to assigned operators.\nBut it wasn't essential to that scheme that\nevery last assignment was made by October 1st, and there's\nno indication that Congress adopted the deadline in order\nto provide any sort of certainty to coal operators. To\nparaphrase the Court's decision in James Daniel Good, it\nwould seem somewhat curious that a deadline that was\nintended to expedite the collection of premiums by the\nCombined Fund could be construed to prevent the Combined\nFund in some circumstances from collecting premiums at\nall. And that's the effect of --\nQUESTION: Is there any limiting principle to\nyour interpretation? I mean, can this go on forever and\never?\nMS. McDOWELL: Oh, the statute doesn't itself\nimpose a limit on the commissioner's authority. However,\nas a practical matter, the commissioner has not made\ninitial assignments for more than 5 years now and has no\nintent to recommence them. Obviously, Congress can cut\noff the authority to do this at -- at any particular time\nby denying an appropriation for the process or by doing it\nexplicitly.\nQUESTION: Would you tell us what percentage of\nthe assignments were made after the deadline, and how long\nafter the deadline was the most recent assignment?\nMS. McDOWELL: Yes. The -- to answer your last\nquestion first, the last one was made in 1997.\nCongress made a total of approximately --\nrather, the commissioner made a total of approximately\n40,000 assignments before the deadline, in addition to\nanother 15,000, approximately, assignments that the coal\noperators had agreed to.\nAfter the deadline, the commissioner made 10,000\nmore assignments. A quarter of those were made in October\n1993 or a handful in February 1994. The rest were made\nprimarily in 1995 and 1996 and a few more, about 55, in\n1997. And the process has been completed.\nQUESTION: When there is a reassignment or\ntaking somebody out of the unassigned pool and attributing\nthat person to an operator, does the operator who has now\ngotten the assignment have to pay interest for the period\nfrom October '93 on, or is it just that you pay now the\nbill that we would have sent you if we had charged you in\n'93?\nMS. McDOWELL: The latter. There's no interest\ncharged. So to the extent --\nQUESTION: So that the --\nMS. McDOWELL: -- the operator benefits by\nhaving the use of the money during the period before the\nobligation is imposed.\nQUESTION: What about the argument that the\nSocial Security Administration stood before Congress and\nsaid, we can make this date? Then the operators who might\nbe saddled with additional responsibility could breathe\neasily and say, well, we don't have to set up any reserve\nfor the assignment of more operators to us.\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, in fact, Your Honor, the\ncommissioner didn't say we will make the deadline. The\ncommissioner did express optimism in September of 1993\nthat the deadline could be complied with.\nQUESTION: I thought there were quotations in\nthe record that had an official from the Social Security\nAdministration telling Congress we are going to do it. It\nwas more than, it's a hope. I -- I don't have that at my\nfingertips now.\nMS. McDOWELL: I think it could have been only\nan expression of hope in -- in September 1993, and then\nthe operators would have received, in many cases, and --\nand these respondents certainly did -- assignments of\nadditional beneficiaries during October 1993, so that\nshould have put them on notice to make inquiry as to\nprecisely when the assignment had been made.\nI think a particularly more telling and -- and\nearlier statement from a -- an acting commissioner came in\nFebruary 1993 when the acting commissioner was testifying\nbefore a House appropriations subcommittee. He said at\nthat point that it did not appear that the assignments\ncould be completed by the deadline.\nOne Member of Congress asked, well, what is the\n-- the crucial date, then? When is it that beneficiaries\nwill lose benefits if the assignments aren't made? And\nthe acting commissioner went on to explain that, well,\nbecause there was a -- a $70 million transfer coming into\nthe Combined Fund on October 1st, 1993 from the United\nMine Workers 1950 pension fund, there would be money in\nthe Combined Fund for some time to pay benefits, and that\nthe assignments could be done on a rolling basis to bring\nmoney into the fund. So it was clearly understood at that\npoint that there was no jurisdictional cutoff of the time\nto make assignments contemplated by the statute.\nQUESTION: Ms. McDowell, what do you do with the\nprovision of 9704(a)(3)(D) which makes an assigned\noperator's unassigned beneficiaries' premium equal to the\noperator's applicable percentage, which is defined as its\npercentage of total assigned beneficiaries, quote,\n\"determined on the basis of assignments as of October 1,\n1993\"?\nMS. McDOWELL: The statute then goes on to\nprovide for adjustments in years after 1993 for two\ncircumstances: when a change has been made as a result of\nthe administrative review process, and when a change has\nbeen made as a result of coal operators going out of\nbusiness.\nQUESTION: Right, but -- but --\nMS. McDOWELL: And the fact that Congress --\nQUESTION: -- but does not make a third\nexception; that is, a change is made as a result of the --\nthe finding of additional assigned beneficiaries under the\n-- under the commissioner's ability to -- to find it after\nOctober 1.\nMS. McDOWELL: That's correct, Your Honor, but\nthe fact that Congress said that these adjustments shall\nbe made doesn't suggest that Congress did not intend to\npermit other appropriate adjustments to be made as well.\nQUESTION: No, but what does -- what does\nsuggest that is the language, determined on the basis of\nassignments as of October 1, 1993. And then there's no\nprovision for -- elsewhere that would enable you to -- to\nmake the other adjustment.\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, Congress was obviously\ncontemplating, at the point that it enacted the statute,\nthat the deadline would be made, satisfied. So it's --\nit's therefore somewhat understandable that Congress\ndidn't discuss all the permutations of what would happen\nif -- if the deadline was, in fact, not satisfied.\nAnd an additional point is even if one assumed\nthat the unassigned beneficiary premium, the applicable\npercentage used to calculate it had to remain fixed as of\nOctober 1st, 1993, that doesn't really address the\ncommissioner's assignment authority after that date, and\nit is not essential to the statute --\nQUESTION: Well, no, it isn't essential but it\nmakes --\nQUESTION: It has to because then you'd be\npaying more than your share. You'd be paying based on the\nassumption that you only had X number of -- of permanent\nbeneficiaries, but then your -- you'd be paying that\npremium, but then you have additional beneficiaries that\nyou must take care of on their own account because they're\nassigned to you. So you -- so you are hurt if you can't\n-- if you can't change the formula.\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, I'm not sure that it would\nsignificantly change the -- the percentage of the whole\nthat the operator would be required to pay for.\nBut in any event, in practice the Combined Fund\nhas gone back and taken subsequent assignments, just like\nsubsequent reassignments, into account in calculating the\napplicable percentage, and the statutory scheme has worked\nquite satisfactorily in that respect.\nQUESTION: Would you clarify one thing for me?\nI don't know whether the -- the fallback position to\nfinance the unassigned -- the benefits for the unassigned\nminers -- they -- there are two -- some money comes out of\nthe first pension fund. Later it comes out of a\nGovernment fund. And then there's the third possibility\nthat that money may run out and the miners will be\nassessed for the payment -- for the unassigned -- the\ncompanies will be assessed for the payments for the\nunassigned miners.\nNow, what is the Government's position with\nrespect to a company that, say, had nobody assigned prior\nto the October date, but after the October date, say, 500\nminers were assigned? Now, as I read the statute, that\nwould mean the -- that company would have no\nresponsibility to contribute to the payments for the\nunassigned miners. Am I right about that? Or would you\nadjust it based on post-October assignments?\nMS. McDOWELL: I'm not aware of any company in\nthat situation, but I think it would be adjusted for post-\nOctober assignments as well.\nQUESTION: Despite the language of the statute\nthat Justice Scalia referred to.\nMS. McDOWELL: Yes, Your Honor. We think it's\nflexible enough to allow those additional adjustments to\nbe taken into account.\nQUESTION: When do you do the adjusting in the\n-- I gather that's what you're doing. When do you\nactually make the adjustments?\nMS. McDOWELL: That's a task that's left to the\nCombined Fund to do. It's not an adjustment that the\ncommissioner herself made.\nQUESTION: But is -- is the percentage\nrecalculated as of the beginning of -- of each kind of\nfiscal year following the -- the initial October 1 date?\nOr -- or in the middle of a company's -- in the middle of\na year running from October 1, are they suddenly socked\nwith a -- or at least liable to be socked with an\nassignment for which they had no reason to plan on October\n1?\nMS. McDOWELL: You know, I think the\ncommissioner typically made one round of assignments a\nyear during the time --\nQUESTION: Annually.\nMS. McDOWELL: -- when she was making additional\nassignments.\nQUESTION: Annually.\nMS. McDOWELL: Sometimes two rounds, I believe.\nQUESTION: And is that made in advance of\nOctober 1 each year to commence on October 1 or be\neffective as of October 1 each year?\nMS. McDOWELL: Yes.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nQUESTION: I still don't see your basis for\ndoing it. You say it's flexible enough, but you're\nconfronted with language that says it will be determined\non the basis of assignments as of October 1, 1993. I\nmean, there it is. It says it in cold, hard language.\nThere is no -- no exception elsewhere to do what you say\nthere's flexibility to do. Where do you get the\nflexibility from?\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, Congress didn't foreclose\nadditional adjustments to be assigned beneficiary premium\nin addition to those specified in the statute.\nQUESTION: What do you mean it didn't foreclose?\nYes, it did. It said, determined on the basis of\nassignments as of October 1, 19 -- what -- what more does\nit have to say?\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, then if you will turn to\nthe next subsection of the statute, it provides for\nadjustments for plan years after 1993.\nQUESTION: For other -- exactly. That -- that\nmakes it even clearer that except for those expressed\nexceptions, everything else has to be done as of October\n1.\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, in any event, Your Honor,\nthat particular provision is a separate section of the\nstatute from one addressing the commissioner's assignment\nauthority. It doesn't provide the sort of clear and\nunambiguous indication that Congress intended to prevent\nthe commissioner after the statutory deadline from\ncompleting the task that Congress thought was important.\nQUESTION: No, but if -- if you don't read the\ntwo provisions together, if you don't read the shall\nclause and -- and the calculation clause together, you --\nyou get a system which is simply incoherent. You've got a\nsystem in which assignments are being made, but in fact\nthe -- the Combined Fund is being operated as -- as if\nthey were not being made. And, you know, it seems to me\nthat you -- you've got to go the whole hog. You -- you've\nsimply got to say that the -- the October 1 deadline has\ngot to be read together with the shall clause, and if the\nshall clause can be varied, then the October 1 deadline\ncan be varied, too, because otherwise you just get an\nincoherent system. Do you agree?\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, that is certainly how it\nhas been applied.\nQUESTION: That's what you're doing.\nMS. McDOWELL: It has been applied flexibly and\nadjustments in the applicable percentage have been made\nretroactively.\nThank you. I'll reserve.\nQUESTION: I have one question. I -- I take\nit's possible if a company had received assignment of --\nof all of its employees, that it could argue that it was\npaying too much if there wasn't the adjustment. Have any\ncompanies made that argument?\nMS. McDOWELL: Not that I'm aware of, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. McDowell.\nMr. Buscemi, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER BUSCEMI\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS HOLLAND, ET AL.\nMR. BUSCEMI: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe respondents in this case are seeking a\nwindfall because the Social Security Administration didn't\ncomplete its work on time. They should not get it.\nIt is conceded in this case that the\nbeneficiaries at issue were supposed to be assigned to\nBellaire and Peabody.\nIt's conceded that these respondents are not\nbeing asked to pay a penny more than Congress wanted them\nto pay.\nIt's conceded that Congress wanted as many\nbeneficiaries as possible to be assigned to particular\noperators. Section 9706(a) itself directs SSA to assign\neach beneficiary. Now --\nQUESTION: Counsel, would you explain to us the\nreal world consequences at the end of the day for the\nrespective positions of the parties? Apparently the\nminers will be covered one way or another.\nMR. BUSCEMI: That is correct, Your Honor. And\nrespondents make a great deal of that as if the only\npurpose of the statute was to ensure that the\nbeneficiaries would continue to receive their health\ncoverage. That was surely a major percentage.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. BUSCEMI: But the financing method of the\nbenefits was also a key component of the statute.\nQUESTION: Well, that's -- the next part of\nJustice O'Connor's question is -- and I had this in mind\nalso -- is the fund will always have adequate funds to pay\nfor the unassigned miners, will they not? The plans.\nMR. BUSCEMI: Well, the Combined Fund will --\nQUESTION: The -- the plans in that sense aren't\nhurt because they're -- they're not going to run out of\nmoney.\nMR. BUSCEMI: The Combined Fund will receive\nfunds in accordance with the provisions of the statute.\nThe answer to Justice O'Connor's question is threefold.\nIt is complicated.\nFor the first 3 plan years, beginning February\n1, 1993 and ending October 1 -- I'm sorry -- September 30,\n1995, if these beneficiaries are not assigned, as they\nshould be, to Bellaire and Peabody, all of the other\nassigned operators will receive a greater assessment, and\nthey will -- because there will be an increased number of\nunassigned beneficiaries during those first 3 plan years.\nQUESTION: A backwards looking assessment --\nMR. BUSCEMI: Correct.\nQUESTION: -- for those early years.\nQUESTION: But they're not complaining, as I\nunderstand it, or am I wrong about that?\nMR. BUSCEMI: Well, they -- they surely are\ncomplaining. The Apogee case, for example, in the\nEleventh Circuit was a case that arose precisely because\nof that sort of supplemental, after-the-fact assessment\ndesigned to take into account the fact that there was a\ngreater number of unassigned beneficiaries in the plan.\nAnd that, in particular, arose as a result of this Court's\ndecision in the Eastern Enterprises case.\nQUESTION: But they're not in this case.\nMR. BUSCEMI: They're -- they're not intervenors\nin this case, no, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Why? I'm just -- as I understand it,\nwhich may show I'm wrong, the -- the -- all this is about\nis, since the -- this receptacle, the -- the -- what are\nwe calling it -- the fund -- is --\nMR. BUSCEMI: UMWA Combined Benefit Fund?\nQUESTION: Yes. That's financed by the coal\ncompanies, too. So -- so that -- aren't -- isn't the\nmoney that we're just talking about coming from them and\n-- and -- the unassigned people go into a fund. The\nunassigned people go into a -- what's the word? It's\nescaped me.\nMR. BUSCEMI: Your Honor, both the assigned\nbeneficiaries and the unassigned beneficiaries are\nbeneficiaries of the Combined Benefit Fund. The Combined\nBenefit Fund receives premiums for each beneficiary from\nthe assigned operator, if the beneficiary is assigned. If\nthe beneficiary is not assigned, as I was starting to say\nin response to Justice O'Connor's question, there is a\ncomplicated system. For the first 3 --\nQUESTION: And you've given us step one. Right?\nMR. BUSCEMI: Step one is the first 3 plan\nyears.\nQUESTION: All right.\nMR. BUSCEMI: During those 3 plan years, the\nunassigned beneficiaries are paid for out of the transfers\nfrom the UMWA 1950 pension plan. Those were transfers\nthat could not have been made but for the statute because\npension benefits and the health benefits are different.\nAnd Congress intervened and said there will be $210\nmillion moving into the Combined Fund from the pension\nplan. That money is used for unassigned beneficiaries'\npremiums. It's used for death benefit premiums, and for\nthe first year and the first year only, it's used to\nreduced the assigned operators' assigned beneficiary\npremiums.\nSo every time the number of unassigned\nbeneficiaries goes up, a greater share of that $210\nmillion must be used to pay for the unassigned\nbeneficiaries. Less is left for death benefits and to\ndefray the first year assigned beneficiary premiums, and\naccordingly, a supplemental assessment is made on all\nassigned operators when the number of unassigned\nbeneficiaries goes up.\nThat's part one.\nPart two. Beginning on October 1, 1995,\nCongress says that there shall be annual transfers from\nthe interest earned by the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation\nFund established under the Surface Mining Control and\nReclamation Act.\nNow, obviously, you can't transfer interest that\nyou don't have. The interest earned by the AML Fund has\nbeen declining. Interest rates have been going down, and\naccordingly, the interest rates that are earned by the\nfund goes down. The fund at one time earned $80 million a\nyear in interest. It's now projected to earn only 30 in\nfiscal 2003. So there's a limit to how much can be\ntransferred from the AML Fund.\nThe third component. If the AML Fund transfer\nis not sufficient to pay for the beneficiaries, the\nunassigned beneficiaries, then there must be an unassigned\nbeneficiary premium assessed against all assigned\noperators, thereby shifting the cost of these\nbeneficiaries from these respondents to all assigned\noperators.\nQUESTION: Which hasn't happened yet in fact.\nMR. BUSCEMI: It has not happened yet.\nQUESTION: And how much are we talking about?\nMR. BUSCEMI: Well, right now we're talking --\nif everyone nationwide affected by this case, if the rule\nwere to change, and you were looking purely prospectively,\nyou have about 4,000 people. But if you go back to the\nbeginning --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. BUSCEMI: -- you have about 10,000 people.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. BUSCEMI: And as Mr. Tennielle's\ndeclaration, which is in the joint appendix, shows, there\nis approximately $105 million that was already at stake as\nof the time of his declaration in 1999, and that number\nhas been growing ever since.\nQUESTION: What exactly is the interest of the\ntrustees that you represent?\nMR. BUSCEMI: Your Honor, the trustees want to\nsee this statute operate the way it's supposed to operate.\nThe trustees --\nQUESTION: But that's a fairly -- what is their\nfinancial or pecuniary interest?\nMR. BUSCEMI: The trustee -- it's -- it's not a\nfinancial interest. The trustees believe that the policy\nof the statute was to have the greatest possible amount\npaid for from the private sector by the employers who\nemployed the beneficiaries, retired miners. And the\ntrustees have been, in each of these cases, arguing that\nthe system ought to work the way Congress intended.\nNow, on the applicable percentage, I do want to\nsay one thing in response to Justice Scalia's several\nquestions on this, and that is, the \"as of\" language in\nthe statute is very important. Every time there is a\nreassignment as a result of an administrative appeal, it's\nmade as of October 1, 1993. Every time there's an initial\nassignment made after September 30, 1993, it's made as of\nOctober 1, 1993. They all go back to the beginning\nbecause these beneficiaries all need health care --\nQUESTION: You can't read that language that\nway. It -- it says applicable percentage is defined as\nthe percentage of total assigned beneficiaries determined\non the basis of assignments as of October 1, 1993. You're\n-- you're telling me that means assignments made later,\nbut that you say on their face, we're making these\nretroactive to October 1, 1993?\nMR. BUSCEMI: It must be, Your Honor. It must\nbe because if there is a reassignment --\nQUESTION: It must be because otherwise your\ntheory doesn't work.\nMR. BUSCEMI: No. Otherwise the statute --\nQUESTION: And -- and the other side's theory of\nthe case is -- is correct.\nMR. BUSCEMI: No, Your Honor, because when\nthere's a reassignment after an administrative appeal, for\nexample, the reassignment occurs in 1995 or 1996. If an\nadministrative appeal is successful and there's a\nreassignment, that reassignment is as of October 1, 1993,\neven though the reassignment isn't made until later.\nThat's absolutely plain --\nQUESTION: So there's a -- there's a retroactive\nassessment?\nMR. BUSCEMI: Absolutely, Your Honor. All of\nthese assignments, whether they're reassignments after\nadministrative appeals, whether they're initial\nassignments during this period when the commissioner was\nfinishing the assignment process, they all go back to the\nbeginning. In fact, they go back to February 1, 1993\nbecause that's the beginning of the first plan year.\nI might say there are many provisions in this\nstatute that say do something by a date certain. The\ntrustees had to be appointed by a date certain. The $70\nmillion transfers from the '50 pension plan had to be by a\ndate certain. The merger of the '50 benefit plan, the '74\nbenefit plan into the Combined Fund had to be by a date\ncertain. Yet no one would argue that if any of those\ndates was missed, then there was no authority at all.\nAnd --\nQUESTION: Wouldn't you have to give back money\nif -- if your side does not prevail? Then these payments\nhave been made -- the assignments that were made,\npayments have been made as of October 1, '93. And\nwouldn't the fund have to give those payments back?\nMR. BUSCEMI: That's precisely what Mr.\nTennielle's declaration points out, Your Honor. As of the\ntime of his declaration, there had been approximately $105\nmillion worth of payments by various assigned operators\nwho had received assignments, initial assignments of\nbeneficiaries that were made after September 30, 1993.\nThose amounts would have to be refunded or credited.\nIndeed, the respondents in this case sought just such\nrefunds or credits. If you look at Judge Kinneary's\nopinion, for example, in the Bellaire case in the\nappendix, he grants a credit to Bellaire in the amount of\nthe payments that they made on behalf of the beneficiaries\nassigned to them.\nQUESTION: Well, of course. They were assigned\nincorrect -- I mean, what's so extraordinary about that?\nIt just means you've been collecting money from the wrong\npeople.\nMR. BUSCEMI: I was just responding to --\nQUESTION: I -- I would hope you give it back.\nI mean --\nMR. BUSCEMI: And we did.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Buscemi.\nMr. Roberts, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS PEABODY COAL COMPANY, ET AL.\nMR. ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe petitioners' position is that when Congress\nsaid shall before October 1st, 1993, it meant may before\nor after October 1st, 1993. That is so, according to the\npetitioners because, as they read the statute, Congress\ncould not really have intended to limit the authority of\nthe commissioner to make assignments under the act.\nBut there is nothing implausible or even unusual\nabout reading the statute to mean what it says. The\nconsequence of not assigning a particular miner by the\nstatutory deadline is that the miner is unassigned under\nthe statute. The statute tells us what to do with\nunassigned miners. There is an elaborate backup\nprovision, as the Solicitor General calls it, to deal with\nunassigned beneficiaries.\nFirst and foremost, they receive the same\nbenefits as assigned miners.\nQUESTION: Mr. Roberts, all I -- all that, I\nguess, is conceded in the argument, but the -- the -- when\nall is said and done, there seems to be an -- an inequity\nas among the operators. And I can understand your -- I do\nunderstand, I accept your argument that at least to get\nthe plan going initially, that the objective of Congress\nwould have been, as it were, a good system rather than a\nperfect system.\nWhat I don't see is why Congress would want --\nwould have wanted to make it impossible to improve on that\nsystem later by eliminating the -- the inequity of an\nerroneous failure to assign. And it's -- it's that issue\nthat makes it difficult for me to read the -- the shall\nlanguage as being, as -- as they say, jurisdictional or\nproviding a cutoff. Can you address what the reason\nCongress would have had for wanting to preserve that\ninequity?\nMR. ROBERTS: Certainly. First of all, from\nCongress's point of view, the overriding purpose is to\ncontinue benefits. That's taken care of.\nSecond, the coal miners get the same benefits\nwhether they're assigned or unassigned.\nNow, but the argument is this undermines the pay\nfor your own principle. But the pay for your own\nprinciple itself is -- embodies rough justice. A company\nthat employs a miner for 2 years pays for all his\nbenefits. Another company may have employed him for 25\nyears. That's the compromise that was agreed to and\nthat's fine. But it doesn't mean that this pay for your\nown principle is some unqualified desideratum that you can\nassume Congress intended to pursue at all costs in\nperpetuity. We know that's not the case. They had a\ndeadline and they imposed it.\nQUESTION: But, Mr. Roberts, didn't you omit one\nof the other statutory purposes, which was, insofar as\npossible, to assign responsibility for paying the benefits\nto the company that had the best, the closest connection\nwith that particular miner?\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes, and we know that was, for\nexample, not a purpose they wanted to pursue ueber alles.\nIf a company goes bankrupt, those miners --\nQUESTION: But it was one of the major purposes,\nwas it not?\nMR. ROBERTS: It was one of the purposes, yes,\nand it was one that Congress said, spend a year trying to\nmake these assignments. But then we've got to launch this\nfund and --\nWhat is really going on here is that the\ncommissioner wants to do a different sort of job than\nCongress delegated to her. This is the sort of project --\nand I think this is a critical distinction from the\ndeadlines in Pierce County and those sorts of cases. The\nagency could have done a reasonably good job on this\nproject in 4 months, a better job in a year, maybe a\nnearly perfect job in 5 years. Congress said, we want the\n1-year version. Why do we want the 1-year version and not\nthe nearly perfect version? Because the miners are going\nto get the same benefits either way. Coal companies or\nfunds established by coal companies are going to pay for\nthem either way.\nQUESTION: But they will pay in different\namounts. Different coal companies will be paying for some\nof the miners under your proposal rather than the\nGovernment's proposal.\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes, and the question is-\nQUESTION: And the specific hypothetical that\ntroubles me -- let me put it right out on the table.\nSupposing a company had no assignments made to its prior\nminers until after October 1st. If I understand the\nsystem correctly, at the end of the line, if they have to\nfinance the payments for the unassigned miners out of a --\na pool contributed to by the operators, that company will\nnot have to contribute to that pool.\nMR. ROBERTS: No. That's right. If it had no\nassignments.\nNow, Congress --\nQUESTION: And -- and the company which had a\nfull assignment is going to be paying more than its pro\nrata share.\nMR. ROBERTS: And Congress knew --\nQUESTION: And even though that there was -- you\nsay there's rough justice. This is making it even -- even\nmore rough, and if the companies are not paying the\nproportion of the -- of the benefits that the statutory\nscheme requires. They're paying more.\nMR. ROBERTS: And Congress knew there was some\nunfairness in requiring the companies to pay for\nunassigned beneficiaries, and it cushioned that unfairness\nby saying we're going to draw from this AML Fund that coal\noperators established earlier. That will -- it has to\ndate ensured that there is no unassigned beneficiaries --\nQUESTION: But I take it that fund itself is\nmaintained based on the -- your share of fully assigned\nminers. More, the more you're assigned, the more you have\nto pay to that fund. Or correct me if I'm wrong.\nMR. ROBERTS: No. That -- it's a preexisting\nfund that was established based, I believe, on per-ton\nroyalties.\nThe point is everybody is contributing in\ndifferent amounts to establish --\nQUESTION: No, but Mr. -- let me just interrupt\nyou as to your answer to Justice Kennedy. It's true for\nthe first and second stages that it doesn't matter, but if\nyou have to go to the third stage where the unassigned\nminers are paid by the companies, then what he says is\nabsolutely right.\nMR. ROBERTS: If you have to get to the third\nstage where there's an unassigned beneficiaries premium\nassessed, yes. It's done pro rata. And Peabody Coal, for\nexample, will have a very sizeable bill if that reaches it\nbecause they have over 4,000 assigned miners. This case\nis about 330 miners who were assigned after October 1st.\nBut the point is not whether you could write a\nfunding mechanism that is more equitable or fair. It's a\nquestion of whether that's the one that Congress wrote.\nCongress --\nQUESTION: What is the harm? That is to say, as\nyou agree -- I think we both agree there are many statutes\nwith deadlines in them. There are regulatory statutes\nset, health regulations by such and such a date set,\nconsumer, trucking regulations. And the courts regularly\nset that those dates, even though they use words like\nshall, are not fixed because obviously Congress wanted the\nregulations written, even if late.\nWell, here they're saying this is roughly the\nsame thing. Obviously, Congress would have wanted this\nassigned in the principle of pay for your own way, and\nnobody is hurt by doing that late. Nobody is really hurt.\nNow, I want you to reply to that. What's the\ndown side of trying to interpret this like we'd interpret\nother regulatory statutes?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well -- well, it's not like the\nother regulatory statutes, first of all, because it's an\nextraordinary grant of the authority to impose retroactive\nliability. The grant exists nowhere other than in the\nsame sentence that says shall. I think that's quite\ndifferent than saying, EPA, in 2 years issue clean air\nregulations. That's -- that's a different case. And\nPierce County is quite different. I think the Government\nprobably has inherent authority to recover misspent funds.\nThe harm is the same harm that comes from\ndisregarding any kind of deadline. As I said, this is the\nsort of project you can spend 20 years on and always come\nup with a more perfect assignment. Congress knew that.\nThey knew that a significant amount of work was involved.\nThey had to go and set up an interim funding system for\nFebruary to October to give the commissioner time. The\ncommissioner came back and said, we've done it. We've\ncompleted the project.\nQUESTION: Is there any way that you or your\nclients or anyone have been hurt by the delay?\nMR. ROBERTS: Oh, of course.\nQUESTION: That is -- how? How were you hurt\nspecifically by the delay compared with if they had done\nit all perfectly within 5 minutes? Imagine they got the\nsame assignments on time. Now imagine they got them late,\nand how are you hurt by that?\nMR. ROBERTS: Oh, sure. Well, it's the same\nconcern the Court noted last term in the Sigmon Coal case.\nThe coal industry is characterized by a significant amount\nof transactions, mergers, acquisitions. You could be\nlooking at acquiring a coal company, and of course, given\nthe nature of the industry, the first question you ask is\nwhat is your liability, and they're going to say, well,\nit's this much. And then you -- then the -- the merger or\nthe acquisition takes place, and then you get another\nnotice, here are, you know, 40 new miners. And now, all\nof a sudden, it's this much. That was a significant\nconcern in Sigmon Coal, and it is significant in this\ninstance as well.\nQUESTION: But, Mr. Roberts, on the other hand,\nyou are, in fact your companies are paying less than they\nwould have paid had they been billed properly on time\nbecause you have had the use of the money in the interim,\nand Ms. McDowell said you're not being charged any\ninterest because you're paying in 19 -- or any adjustment\nfor inflation because you get to pay in 19-whatever, '97\ndollars a bill that was due from October 1993 and you\ndon't get charged any interest on that.\nMR. ROBERTS: I don't think interest is a\nsignificant factor just the way the interest rates have\nbeen over this time period. It certainly doesn't do much\nto cushion the unfairness and inequity of getting a bill\nretroactive as much as 5 years.\nQUESTION: But my -- my point is simply had you\ngotten that bill, that -- timely, it would have been more\ncostly than getting the bill later because you have had\nthe use of the money in the interim.\nMR. ROBERTS: The -- the interest is apparently\nnot -- not charged.\nQUESTION: Unless you're -- unless you're a\ncompany that had bought a company which, which had that\nswitch pulled, in which case you're -- you're out of\npocket a good deal. Despite the fact that you're -- that\nit's less money than -- than would have been charged\noriginally, it's coming out of your pocket when you bought\na coal company that you did not believe had that\nliability.\nMR. ROBERTS: And the -- the key factor that\nsuch transactions play in this particular industry may\nwell explain why you don't see any companies on this side\nof the case. I think it's always wise to be skeptical of\nfairness arguments that are raised by proxy. There are no\ncompanies complaining about, oh, we're going to end up\npotentially paying a higher pro rata assessment than\notherwise because -- a number of reasons.\nAgain, Congress cushioned the unfairness; they\nrecognized it by making the AML Fund available.\nSecond of all, this is a statute that is\nsuffused with concepts of rough justice. It is not\nnecessarily a more perfect result to pursue 5 years\ninstead of 1 year to pay for your own principle. That\ndoes not necessarily lead to a more perfect result. It\nmay mean that more companies who employed miners for 2\nyears are paying over all of those benefits than companies\n-- when companies who employed the same miner for 20 years\ndon't have to pay for any.\nBut the critical --\nQUESTION: But there is -- I mean, Congress did\nprovide that if you think you were assigned people who\nbelonged to someone else, you can complain and then\nthere's an adjustment long after the 1993 --\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes. We think that helps us, of\ncourse, because it's an express provision for an\nassignment after October 1st. There are no other such\nprovisions and because --\nQUESTION: But isn't -- isn't it true that with\nregard to the as -- with regard to as of language that\nJustice Scalia is emphasizing, isn't it true that those\npost-October changes are made as of the October date?\nMR. ROBERTS: The reassignment provisions, yes.\nNow, I'm not aware of a situation where it's reassigned to\nsomeone who never had any assignments --\nQUESTION: No, but at least the cancellation of\n-- of an assignment would be made as of the earlier date\neven though it took later -- took place later.\nMR. ROBERTS: That's right.\nBut the other point is that although there's a\nprovision for --\nQUESTION: So -- so you -- you admit that that\nlanguage doesn't really mean what it says.\nMR. ROBERTS: Oh, no. It means as of October\n1st. What I'm saying, in the case of a reassignment, they\nsay you can go back and -- and reassign it. The\napplicable percentage is based on the assignments a\nparticular company had as of October 1st.\nQUESTION: If you can do it with a reassignment,\nwhy can't you do it with an initial assignment?\nMR. ROBERTS: Because there's --\nQUESTION: Without doing violence to the\nlanguage?\nMR. ROBERTS: Because there's a specific\nexception that allows reassignments. There's no exception\nfor reassignments. And, I would point out, there is no\nprovision that allows changes in the case of an unassigned\nminer, and that is what has been going on here primarily.\nThe commissioner has been revisiting the unassigned pool,\nand that's why this is quite different from a lot of the\nother deadline cases. This is -- we think the\ncommissioner did get the job done on time. She just wants\nto do a different job.\nQUESTION: But Congress didn't think so, at\nleast the Congress that made an appropriation so that the\n-- the administration could get the job done. There was a\nsupplemental appropriation, wasn't there?\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes.\nQUESTION: And part of it was supposed to be\nspent to enable the administration to finish the job.\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes, part of it. And the one\nthing Congress did not do, with being told, you know,\nwe're coming up with the deadline, they didn't change the\ndeadline. They kept that in place.\nLook at what the Solicitor --\nQUESTION: I thought that supplemental\nappropriation was made after October 1st, 1993.\nMR. ROBERTS: No, before. In June I believe.\nIt was asked for in February, made in June or early July.\nQUESTION: It's a little hard for me to accept\nyour argument that the equitable structure of the statute\nis enhanced because the commissioner didn't get his work\ndone on time.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, I think the commissioner did\nget the work done on time. It's just she just wants to do\na more perfect job. And what I'm saying is it's\nreasonable for Congress to determine we don't need the\nmore perfect job. We need a good-enough job. And this\njob is good enough to get the fund launched.\nThe one thing that's clear is that the way the\npetitioners read the statute, if that had been proposed\nwhen the Coal Act was -- was enacted, it never would have\ngotten off the ground. The idea of giving the\ncommissioner significant discretion on an open-ended\ntimetable was certainly not in the cards. This is the\nlegislative equivalent of trench warfare, parties fighting\nover every inch. They had the black lung model which did\ngive the Secretary of Labor significant discretion in\nallocating responsibility for that consequence of -- of\nthe -- of coal mining, and they wanted nothing to do with\nit. That's why --\nQUESTION: How -- how do we know this, Mr.\nRoberts? I -- I take it there's no helpful statement in\nthe legislative history saying, you know, by the way, this\nis, you know, the linchpin of the deal, that with respect\nto unassigned miners, there will be no monkeying around\nafter October 1st, '93?\nMR. ROBERTS: I think we know it primarily --\nno. There's no statement like that. I think we know it\nfrom the structure of the statute which is carefully\nreticulated. There is no delegation of discretion to the\ncommissioner. The compromises in the statute are spelled\nout.\nAnd when you talk about revisiting fairness,\nkeep in mind you're looking at one particular provision\nand you say, well, that looks unfair. It may be because\nanother provision that's not at issue balances that out.\nThis is, as the Court noted in Sigmon, an\ninstance of legislative horse trading and log rolling, and\nthey're setting up a system and everybody has to pitch in\nsome. The older pension funds pitched in some. The\noperators pitched in. Congress came forward with the AML\nFund, and it moved forward. And it had to be in place by\nOctober 1st or the wheels would have fallen off. This is\nnot a deadline of the sort you've got 120 days to issue a\ndecision.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Roberts.\nMr. Sutton, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY S. SUTTON\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS BELLAIRE CORPORATION, ET AL.\nMR. SUTTON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. May\nit please the Court:\nI'd like to start with a legal point, and I want\nto start by looking at 9706(a), which I'm sure you have\nhandy. I'm going to -- 9706(a). I'm going to be reading\nfrom the red brief, Bellaire's brief, at A19. And this is\nthe assignment provision we've been discussing. And there\nare two things that are important about the language of\n9706(a).\nThe first is, of course, that it says, shall\nbefore October 1st, 1993, and I think you understand our\narguments there.\nBut the second point --\nQUESTION: Which one are you reading from, Mr.\nSutton?\nMR. SUTTON: The Bellaire --\nQUESTION: I know, but where on the page?\nMR. SUTTON: A19, 9706(a), section (a), 9706(a).\nQUESTION: Oh, thank you.\nMR. SUTTON: And the -- the first point you\nnotice is the shall before October 1st, 1993 language.\nAnd of course, you -- we've made our point there.\nBut the second point is that it's the same shall\nterm that modifies other clearly mandatory jurisdictional\nrequirements under the act. The commissioner would agree\nthat she had no option of assigning these miners to\nnonsignatories or to assigning them to people that were\nout of business or to not following the statutory\nprescribed order of priority. It's one term, shall. As\nthe Court made it clear in another deadline case, Mohasco,\nwe're going to assume the same word has the same meaning\nthroughout and --\nQUESTION: No, but -- I mean, that -- that's an\nassumption we can't make. I mean, I think there is a\nclear understanding that when someone is given an\neither/or choice, shall may be -- mean one thing. When\none is given a timing or a deadline choice, it may mean\nsomething else. The statute is addressing different\nissues and the same verb may well have different meanings\nin -- in the different contexts.\nMR. SUTTON: Well, Your Honor, I -- I'm not\naware of a case from this Court that has said one word in\none sentence can have different meanings in the statute.\nQUESTION: It doesn't have different meanings.\nIt has the same meaning. But in fact, it doesn't tell you\nwhat happens if you don't do it. All right. So they\ndidn't do it.\nNow what? If you don't do what it says, then\nwhat? And there the statute is silent.\nMR. SUTTON: And the point --\nQUESTION: And furthermore, the argument is that\nthe shall merely enhances and makes more meaningful the\nother shalls. I mean, that's --\nMR. SUTTON: Well, there's just one shall. And\nthe petitioners would agree that there's a clear\nconsequence if they had not assigned to a signatory\noperator. Why isn't there the same mandatory --\nQUESTION: Because it's a -- look. It's not a\nlinguistic point. The point is, what happens if you don't\ndo it, what you shall do? And there, the consequence in\nthe case -- you said you couldn't go back. You're\nabsolutely right. And now our question is what's the\nconsequence here?\nMR. SUTTON: Well, the consequence here -- and\nthat's what makes this an easy case -- is the fact that\nunlike Pierce County, the statute did provide a\nconsequence. It did provide a fail-safe safety net for\nall miners.\nQUESTION: Well, it provided -- it had a default\nprovision. In effect, it says, if there hasn't been an\nassignment to an operator, this is where the person goes\nfor purposes of this tripartite calculation.\nBut the fact that there may be a default\nprovision in the case of -- of inaction, I don't think\nnecessarily is -- is equivalent to saying that there is a\nprovision for all time about what shall happen. It's just\nthat their immediate object was there had to be a grouping\nof these miners as of October 1 or there would have been\nno way to calculate the -- the sources of the -- the\nvarious assessments to pay for it. But that -- all that\ndoes is say, okay, you've got a default in place --\ndefault position -- provision in place so that you know\nwhat to do as of October 1. But it doesn't answer the --\nthe question here.\nMR. SUTTON: The proof, Your Honor, that this\nwas not that mysterious in terms of language is the fact\nthat the commissioner had no problem doing what -- just\nwhat we say the statute required. As of October 1st,\n1993, she did just what Congress said she should do, which\nis to divide the world of miners into two parts, assigned\nor unassigned.\nAfter October 1st, 1993 -- and keep in mind this\nwas a statutory beginning, not a statutory --\nQUESTION: Well, she could have done that if she\nhad done absolutely nothing at all. If -- if she had done\nzero on -- on October 1st, the -- the default provision\nwould have -- would have come into play and there would\nhave been a result of October 1st. And -- and I assume\nyou would not take the position there that a -- a total\ndefault by the Government of any action at all would --\nwould be required to go unremedied for all time.\nMR. SUTTON: Well, no. Of course, the statute\nwouldn't have worked in that setting.\nQUESTION: No.\nMR. SUTTON: There's no doubt, you would have\nrequired a congressional fix. But the point --\nQUESTION: But there would have been a result as\nof October 1st.\nMR. SUTTON: But the point I'm making is there\nwere only 5,000 out of these 80,000 miners that they ran\nout of time on. As of October 1st, what did they do with\nthese miners? They put them in the unassigned pool. The\nstatute has very specific requirements for transferring --\nQUESTION: Yes, but the unassigned pool wasn't\ncreated just for that purpose. It was also created to\ntake care of people who couldn't be hooked up with any\nparticular company.\nMR. SUTTON: But to use Justice Souter's words,\nall default provisions cover everything. It would be an\nodd safety net that said, some in and some out.\nQUESTION: But you would agree that the default\nposition was not just to take care of the timing problem.\nMR. SUTTON: No, of course, not. But -- but\nthis gets to --\nQUESTION: The universe -- the universe of\nassigned and unassigned was, I don't think, intended by\nCongress to include people that the commissioner didn't\nget around to.\nMR. SUTTON: Well, there's one thing that\nCongress clearly appreciated, and let's make sure we're --\nI -- I make this clear. Of the 10,000 people that have\nbeen reassigned, i.e., original assignments after the\ndate, 7,500 are folks that the commissioner originally\ndid, quote, \"designate\" in the unassigned pool. They\nreviewed the records. They looked at them. They said, we\ncan't find anyone to whom they belong. They're going to\nthe unassigned pool.\nNow, the proof that Congress contemplated that\npossibility is exactly the administrative review\nprovisions we've been talking about. What were they\nabout? Fact error. And so they were aware of --\nQUESTION: Can you give me that number again?\nWhat is the percentage of the unassigned we're talking\nabout that were initially determined properly to be\nunassigned for other criteria?\nMR. SUTTON: 20,000 were initially decided. If\nyou look at the Herrin affidavit at JA179 to 184, it\nspecifically says that 20,000 were initially designated\nunassigned. And this proves Mr. Roberts' point that\nwhat's going on here is not a missed deadline case. They\nmet the deadline. What's going on is they decided to\nreinvent the task.\nQUESTION: So we're talking about 20,000, and --\nand what's the total universe that we're talking about\nhere of unassigned?\nMR. SUTTON: Oh, well, they started with 80,000\naltogether. I'm making the point that 20,000 were\ninitially designated unassigned. Out of that 20,000,\n7,500 later they decided we can do a better job with that.\nAnd our point -- our point is -- I mean, there's a\ncost-benefit analysis here. Congress could have said,\nCommissioner of Social Security, you can keep doing this\ninto perpetuity until you get the job just right. They\ndidn't say that.\nQUESTION: All right. So their -- their\nreassignments cost your clients money. I understand that.\nWhat I don't quite understand is Mr. Roberts' point which\nhe mentioned. If they're right in the case -- I mean, if\n-- if you're right in the case, then other companies\nshould have had to pay more, isn't that right, to balance\nwhat you paid by way of less?\nMR. SUTTON: But, Your Honor, I mean --\nQUESTION: And why weren't they are on the other\nside of the case? I'm genuinely puzzled about that.\nMR. SUTTON: Well, that's an important question.\nBut ultimately, it's robbing Peter to pay Peter. All of\nthese funds, at the end of the day, came from coal\ncompanies.\nQUESTION: Yes, that's my understanding. So I\nwould appreciate why they aren't -- I mean, Mr. Roberts\nbrought that up.\nMR. SUTTON: Because of the cushion.\nQUESTION: And I'm just curious why they're not\nhere.\nMR. SUTTON: The cushion, Your Honor. The\ncushion. A critical part of the compromise that led to\nthe enactment of the act was a cushion of funds to provide\nfor the benefits of unassigned beneficiaries. That\ncushion has been sufficient. So there's no -- there's --\nthere's not been a concern yet for this pro rata --\nQUESTION: Yes, but it isn't assumed it will\nalways be sufficient, is it? It's been sufficient up to\nnow. But isn't it assumed that in time that they will\nhave to resort to a -- a company financed pool of money to\npay for the unassigned miners?\nMR. SUTTON: Your Honor, the Government all the\ntime relies on much less reliable proxies than this one.\nKeep in mind that 93 to 94 percent of these miners'\nrecords were reviewed. The risk that somehow this pro\nrata unassigned beneficiary premium is going to awkwardly\nhurt one company I think is fanciful. I can't imagine how\nthat could happen given the numbers --\nQUESTION: Well, do you not agree -- I'm not\nsure you're responding to my question. Do you not agree\nthat there is a significant possibility, even a\nlikelihood, that you'll reach the third stage of financing\nfor the unassigned pool?\nMR. SUTTON: I don't know, and the reason I\ndon't know is that you -- these AML transfers have done\nthe job. Since 1995 they have done the job, and this is a\ndeclining population.\nQUESTION: Where would that money go?\nQUESTION: Assume there is a significant risk.\nQUESTION: But they haven't eliminated the\nunassigned pool.\nMR. SUTTON: No, they haven't. Of course, not.\nQUESTION: And the question is who -- who should\npay for those?\nMR. SUTTON: And the rough justice calculation\nthat the Congress made is we're going to do it on a pro\nrata basis. If I could just step back for one second, I\nthink this, I hope, puts the 1992 decision in context.\nThrough -- from 1946 forward, they paid for\nthese benefits in two ways. One was pay for your own.\nThe employer paid for his or her employee. And the second\none was pay as a group. They've been doing that through\n-- since 1946. That's what the AML tax does. That's on\nall coal companies.\nQUESTION: Suppose the Secretary had gotten\naround to only half instead of what it was.\nMR. SUTTON: Right.\nQUESTION: You're saying she couldn't -- she --\nshe should not have tried to make it perfect. It was good\nenough for Government work. But suppose it was only --\nshe -- she was much slower and she only did, say, one-\nthird. Then what?\nMR. SUTTON: There's -- there's -- I'm sorry.\nThere's clearly some point at which the wheels\nof the statute would fall off, but I think from the\nCourt's perspective of construing what the statute means,\nit's appropriate to assume the commissioner is going to\nact in good faith. She did act in good faith. She did\nget --\nQUESTION: When you say it would fall off, do\nyou mean that in that event, if she had been slower than\nshe was, then she would have been permitted to make\nassignments after the deadline?\nMR. SUTTON: No, Your Honor, I don't mean to be\nsaying that. The point I'm making is that --\nQUESTION: Well, what would have happened?\nLet's say she did only one-third of the job and you had\nthis large pool of unassigned people.\nMR. SUTTON: Well, the bigger problem would have\nbeen the assigned miners and they wouldn't have had enough\nmoney to pay for them. When I say the wheels fall off the\nstatute, if they didn't get this job done by October 1st,\nthey've got a very serious problem on their hands because\nthe statutory beginning that starts on that date is they\nbegan sending out these premium requirements. The first\nones went out on October 22nd, 1993. And if they hadn't\ndone a sufficient number, you wouldn't have enough money\nto pay for their benefits. You'd be back --\nQUESTION: I thought the first 3 years they got\nthe money from the pension fund.\nMR. SUTTON: Those were used primarily for\nunassigned. They were used some to help with assigned,\nbut most were used to pay for unassigned benefits. So\nthat's the point I'm making there.\nI'd like to make a point about Pierce County\nthat I think is helpful in thinking about deadline cases\nin general. Here's why we're not saying that when a\nstatute says you must complete this FOIA request in 20\ndays, our -- our case would control it. In Pierce County,\nas in that situation, these governmental agencies have\npreexisting general grants of authority to do these acts;\ni.e., go get misspent Federal funds. There are general\nstatutes. There was one in Pierce County. If you look at\npage 257 of Pierce County, the plaintiff conceded there\nwas otherwise jurisdiction to get this money.\nHere -- and so what Pierce County means is we're\nnot going to say there's a repeal by implication of that\ngeneral grant of authority merely because we now have\nanother statute that says do it quickly, get it done.\nThat's not this case.\n9706(a) is the only provision either petitioner\nhas pointed to that gives you this grant of authority. So\nthe grant comes with a limit.\nQUESTION: May I just interrupt with -- with one\nmore question, if I may? In response to the as of\nargument that Justice Scalia identified, Mr. Buscemi gave\na -- a list of a whole bunch of things that are as of\nOctober 1st. What would be your response to his -- his\nlist of as of things that really happened later than that\nOctober date?\nMR. SUTTON: There are express exceptions to the\nOctober 1st deadline, and under this Court's decision in\nSigmon, you follow the Russello rule. They knew about the\npossibility --\nQUESTION: It was an express exception like on\nthe appointment date of the trustees and so forth?\nMR. SUTTON: Oh, I'm sorry. The other shalls.\nI'm sorry. The other shall -- I'm sorry. Thank you.\nThe other shalls throughout this statute --\nyou've got two different issues there. One of them is\nthat they apply -- there's no contingency plan if you\nmiss. Here we've got a contingency plan. That's one\ninference.\nThe second is they all regulate private\nentities. This goes back to the point I just made about\nPierce County. If a private entity is told do something\nby this date, they don't do it, a court clearly has\nauthority to say, we said do it by this date, do it. They\nhad -- they had -- you don't have a authority problem with\na private entity. They can do what they want.\nWith the Government, however, and particularly\nwhen it comes to these extraordinary retroactive\nassignments of liability, the commissioner is not born\nwith that authority. It's not inappropriate to ask the\nGovernment to turn square corners in that kind of a\nsetting as opposed to a setting where they're merely\nexercising a general power to get misspent Federal funds,\nfulfill a FOIA request. There --\nQUESTION: Mr. Sutton, I -- I thought that or\nmaybe I just hoped that Justice Stevens was -- was asking\nabout why it is that the -- the crucial language\ndetermined on the basis of assignments as of October 1,\n1993 is in fact not so crucial, that -- that as Mr.\nBuscemi said, there are other instances in which something\nwas not determined before October 1, 1993, but\nnonetheless, it is deemed to have been determined before\nOctober 1, 1993.\nMR. SUTTON: By the statute. It says that if\nthey -- if a company goes out of a -- goes into\nbankruptcy, we're going to alter the applicable percentage\nas of October 1st, 1993 because they went into bankruptcy.\nIf there's a reassignment, it goes back to October 1st.\nQUESTION: Well, does the statute say it goes\nback to October 1st? Does the statute say the\nreassignment shall be deemed to have been made as of\nOctober 1?\nMR. SUTTON: Let's go back to it right here.\nYou've got -- in the provision you're talking about,\n9704(f), the applicable percentage, it has the general\nrule.\nQUESTION: Where is that? What page?\nMR. SUTTON: A13 of the appendix.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. SUTTON: The general rule is stated in\n9704(f) and then you have the adjustments to the general\nrule.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. SUTTON: And then it says, look at number 2:\nby making the following changes to the assignments as of\nOctober 1st, 1993. They -- they stuck with it. I mean,\nthey understood what was going on, and that's -- that's\nwhat's so inappropriate here.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. SUTTON: I mean, Justice Ginsburg, you made\nthe point that there's no interest running on this, but\nkeep in mind we don't get interest when they make mistakes\non our assignments. That's a wash. Right? I mean, if\nthey mistakenly assign someone to us, we don't get\ninterest there. But -- thank you, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Sutton.\nMs. McDowell, you have 1 minute remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA B. McDOWELL\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER BARNHART\nMS. McDOWELL: Justice Breyer asked why there\nweren't coal companies on our side of the courtroom. It's\nbecause we, that is, the Federal Government, has been\npaying through the AML Fund for the benefits for the last\nfew years. It appears that in the next few years that\ninterest is going to run out, and at that point, there\nwill be coal operators who will be bearing a larger burden\nthrough the unassigned beneficiaries' premium.\nQUESTION: What would the interest be used for\nif it weren't being used to make up the --\nMS. McDOWELL: It would be used for correcting\nthe severe health and safety problems caused by abandoned\nmines from the period before 1977.\nThe suggestion was made that coal operators were\nbeing denied certainty in making transactions. If that\nhad actually been a concern, there is a remedy provided by\nthe Administrative Procedure Act, section 7061, an action\nfor administrative action unreasonably delayed. A coal\noperator conceivably could have brought an action under\nthat statute.\nQUESTION: But they said that -- they answered\nthat by saying, how did we know there was going to be? We\ndidn't know there was going to be anything reassigned to\nus.\nMS. McDOWELL: They received initial assignments\nat -- for the first time in October 1993. That was at a\ntime when no reassignments were being made through the\nadministrative review process. It therefore should have\noccurred to them that these were post-October 1st, 1993\nassignments.\nIn terms of there having been a political\ncompromise that the October 1st, 1993 date would have\njurisdictional effect, in light of Pierce County and\nMontalvo-Murillo, no such compromise could be assumed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms.\nMcDowell.\n"
