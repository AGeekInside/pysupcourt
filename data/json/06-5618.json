        "content": "[11:19 a.m.]\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States.\nMr. Dwyer.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL DWYER\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. DWYER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe district court's 15-month sentence\ncombined with 3 years of supervised release conditioned\non drug treatments and the acquisition of a GED was a\nreasonable sentence. In the uniform and constant\ntradition of Federal criminal sentencing, the district\njudge in this case treated Mario Claiborne as an\nindividual. She considered the guidelines and after\ndoing so turned to the judgment that 3553(a) demands in\nevery case. She issued a sentence to avoid unwarranted\ndisparity, to impose just punishment, and to ensure that\ndeterrence did not throw away Mario Claiborne's chances\nto resume his responsibilities to himself, to his\nfamily, and to his community.\nThe court of appeals, in contrast to the\ndistrict court's careful attention to the 3553(a)\nfactors, focused solely on the guidelines. The court of\nappeals applied its extraordinary circumstances rule.\nThat rule re-tethers sentencing to the guideline.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What would be your test\nof reasonableness for appellate review?\nMR. DWYER: I think a sentence would be\nreasonable if a reasonable judge on the facts and\ncircumstances of that case would find that the sentence\nimposed was sufficient but not greater than necessary to\nsatisfy 3553(a) standards.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that gives\nvery little weight to the goal, which I think is a\ncongressional goal, of nationwide consistency in\neliminating the disparities in the sentencing system\nwhich cause great disrespect to the justice system.\nMR. DWYER: I think that the statute speaks\nof unwarranted disparity and does not speak in terms of\nuniformity. And there is necessarily a tension between\nthe individualized sentencing that 3553(a) requires and\nconcerns about nationwide uniformity.\nBut I think that what distinguishes\nsentencing under the advisory guidelines system from the\nPresentencing Reform Act system are several. One is now\nwe explicitly have purposes of sentencing and factors\nthe judge must consider. 3553 didn't exist before that\ntime.\nSecondly, in every case, as a practical\nmatter, the guidelines are going to exert a\ngravitational weight because they are there. They must\nbe considered as part of the statute.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can I substitute\n\"substantial\" for \"gravitational\" without offending your\nposition or affecting your position?\nMR. DWYER: I don't -- my position would be\nthat 3553(a)(4) is the correct place for consideration\nof the guidelines. It's just one of seven factors. As\na practical matter, I think it's going to get --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Kind of a weak law of\ngravity like the Moon. It's only at one-seventh.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DWYER: As a legal matter weak. As a\npractical matter, I think unfortunately it's going to be\nvery strong. And I think one of the real dangers of an\nadvisory guideline --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I guess the question\nis how strong should we say or can we say, or can\nCongress say it is?\nMR. DWYER: I think that the strength should\nbe no more than one of the 3553(a) factors, because I\nthink the danger, particularly after 20 years of\nguideline sentencing, is that courts will routinely and\nmechanistically apply the guidelines instead of\nexercising their discretion, which now runs to the full\nlimit of 3553(a).\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Then it seems to me that\nto accomplish the goal that you want to accomplish in\nthis case, you almost remove the appellate courts from\nthe process.\nMR. DWYER: I think the appellate courts\nare -- I think Booker considered a very deferential\nstandard of review. The cases that the Booker Court\ncited to illustrate the standard of review of\nreasonableness were all highly deferential decisions\nregarding revocations following supervised release,\naffirming sentences that were many times what the\nchapter 7 policy guidelines would require. The court of\nappeals necessarily must be deferential or I think it\npushes the system back into a mandatory --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose the court of\nappeals had done exactly what it did in this case, but\nit said, we're not giving any special weight whatsoever\nto the guidelines, we're basing this just on our own\nevaluation of the sentencing factors that are set out in\nthe Sentencing Reform Act. Would there be a problem\nthere?\nMR. DWYER: I think there would,\nJustice Alito, because I don't think that the role of\nthe appellate court is to substitute its judgment for\nthe application and weight applied to the 3553(a)\nfactors for the district court.\nJUSTICE ALITO: That's a principle that you\nderive from what? From the Sixth Amendment? From the\nSentencing Reform Act? From where?\nMR. DWYER: Well, I think it derives in part\nfrom the Sentencing Reform Act, which contemplated\nindividualized sentencing.\nJUSTICE ALITO: The Sentencing Reform Act\nrequired, as enacted by Congress, required trial judges\nto apply the guidelines, to follow the guidelines. And\nyou're saying that the Sentencing Reform Act now\nprecludes appellate review of -- it gives the trial\njudges unlimited discretion or extremely broad\ndiscretion?\nMR. DWYER: Certainly extremely broad\ndiscretion.\nJUSTICE ALITO: How do you get that out of\nthe statute that was enacted to narrow their discretion?\nMR. DWYER: Even under a mandatory\nguidelines system that this Court considered in Koon, it\nrecognized that the Sentencing Reform Act also had an\nimportant goal of individualized sentencing. And the\nCourt in Koon recognized that district courts in their\ninstitutional position have a special competence to\ndetermine what's ordinary in a case, what's unusual in a\ncase. The court of appeals lacks that special\ncompetence. It sees only a tiny fraction of the number\nof guideline cases. It doesn't have --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So one of the guides\nfor reasonableness review is what's ordinary in a\nparticular type of case?\nMR. DWYER: I think that what guides the\ncourt of appeals on reasonableness review is to look to\nthe particular case and determine if the reasons on the\nrecord in that case, the district court's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's impossible to\ndo in the abstract. If you're just looking at a\nparticular case, you have no idea whether 5 years is\nreasonable or not. There has to be a background to it\nso that you know that in this type of case, people\nusually get a sentence of 3 years or they usually get a\nsentence of 10 years. And it seems to me that what's\nordinary is going to be a judge -- a driving fact in\ndetermining what's reasonable.\nMR. DWYER: I think the court of appeals'\njob is to ensure that the district judge provides\nreasoned elaboration of its judgment on the facts of\nthat case that establish that the district court had\ncomplied with 3553(a), and on the facts of that case,\nselected a sentence which is sufficient but not greater\nthan necessary.\nI don't believe that it is the court of\nappeals' job, as was remarked earlier, to become a\nsentencing commission and begin to reexamine and reweigh\ndistrict courts' decisions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if you're\nlooking at not just the number, but the reasons. In\nother words, the question I asked earlier, you've got\nnine district judges, they all say we do not depart\ndownward for military service, and you've got one\ndistrict judge that says we do. It seems to me that if\nthe court of appeals can't review that to bring about\nsome uniformity in the factors that are appropriate to\nconsider, then it's essentially a lawless system.\nMR. DWYER: I think it is not lawless in the\nsense that courts of appeals need to determine whether\nin a particular case, the differences it finds are\nwarranted on the facts and circumstances of that case,\nwhether the district judge has consulted the guidelines,\nhas looked at the history and characteristics of that\ndefendant, has looked at the nature and circumstances of\nthe crime. And if those reasons satisfy the court that\na reasonable judge looking at those facts --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: On my particular\ncase, what's the right answer for the court of appeals?\nThey've got two cases before them. One, the judge\ndeparts three years because of military service. The\nprosecutor appeals. The other, the judge refuses to\ndepart because of military service and the defendant\nappeals.\nShould those -- what should happen with\nthose two cases?\nMR. DWYER: I think the same process of\nreview applies to each. And it may result -- and that\nprocess of review is on the record in that case, would a\nreasonable judge have arrived at that sentence?\nAnd that review may result in both cases\nbeing reversed, one, or the other, or neither being\nreversed.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Where does that come from\nas a matter of law? That is, suppose -- now you can say\nI -- if you want, say my hypothesis is wrong, but if I\nstart with an assumption that Congress did want the\ncourt of appeals to try to create greater uniformity in\nsentencing, and it wanted cooperation between the courts\nof appeals and the sentencing commission, indeed the\nsentencing commission itself is an effort to copy a\nsystem that exists in Britain where courts of appeals\ncreate a degree of uniformity.\nSuppose I start with that assumption and say\nthat's what the guidelines were about and the reason\nthat number 4 is in 3553, it's not just one factor among\nmany. After all, it was attached to a bill that was the\nguideline bill.\nAnd indeed, the part we excised was a floor\namendment that came along later to make it even tougher.\nSo if I start with the assumption that's what Congress\nwanted, not what I wanted, Congress wanted it, now is\nthere something in the Constitution that forbids it?\nThat's where I start -- I am starting\npersonally with that question in mind, always, if this\nis what Congress wanted, we should try to do it unless\nthere's something in the Constitution that forbids it.\nAnd is there something in the Constitution that would\nforbid the court of appeals to do what on page 91 they\ndid here, leaving the word extraordinary out of it?\nNow, just going through the different\nelements of this case and coming to the conclusion that\nwhat the district judge did was unreasonable?\nMR. DWYER: I think there is a\nconstitutional problem with that. And it is that if --\nit reinstitutes the mandatory guidelines system. And I\nthink if there is to be an effectively advisory system,\nsentencing cannot center on the guidelines. The\ndistrict judge needs to be free to accept or reject that\nadvice and 3553(a), instead of the guidelines, becomes\nthe focal point for sentencing.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's not mandatory. It\nsays the district, the court of appeals judge says, now,\nlet's think here. We have 8 -- 7 people on the\nsentencing commission that have really looked into that.\nAnd they think that in an ordinary course with this\nsmall amount of drugs, the person ought to get so many\nmonths. That reflects a lot of thought. Seems\nreasonable to us. And here the district judge is giving\nhim half that or 40 percent of that without a good\nreason that we can find.\nThe judge said he did it because it was just\none little episode and we think there were many\nepisodes. And that's basically their reason.\nNow, now -- what -- the Sixth Amendment\nforbids that?\nMR. DWYER: Of course, the court of appeals\ndid not adhere to your hypothetical in this case. In --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah --\nMR. DWYER: The Eighth Circuit in this case\nsimply said it is not a guidelines sentence, it is an\nextraordinary variance and we are reversing. The\ndistrict court has to consider the sentencing guidelines\nand generally that must be part of the reason --\nelaboration of judgment, so they will necessarily be\nconsidered on appeal.\nBut the notion somehow that simply because a\nsentence is in the guidelines, all disparity problems\nhave been resolved, is clearly not true. As the amici\nbriefs, and our brief have pointed out, even under a\nmandatory guidelines system, racial disparity increased,\nregional disparity increased. It's disparity that\nindividualized sentencing, the judicial discretion\nnecessary to do that kind of individualized sentencing,\ncan counteract. And that is genuine uniformity.\nAs -- as you pointed out in the Koon\ndecision, or the Koon pointed out borrowing your\nlanguage from Rivera, the district court's special\ncompetence to determine what is ordinary and unusual is\nexactly the kind of information the sentencing\ncommission needs to determine whether a guideline works\nor doesn't work.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Aren't you really saying\nthat the most weight that the guidelines can be given,\nor guidelines can be -- is that -- I apologize for my\nvoice -- the most weight the guidelines can be given is,\nis the weight of necessary advertence? The guidelines,\nin effect, are at odds with the rest of 3553(a). The\nrest of them say individualized sentencing. The\nguidelines, in effect, says, no, sentencing by the\nguidelines.\nTherefore, in order to -- to break this, in\neffect, logical incommensurateness, on your view, I\nthink the most that you can concede is that before a\ndistrict judge sentences finally, he must show that he\nhas considered the value of uniformity as something\ndifferent from individualized sentencing, but that's as\nmuch as he can be required to do.\nIs that a fair statement of your position?\nMR. DWYER: Yeah. And I think 3553(a), in\nfact -- I expect Mr. Dreeben to say this -- talks about\nuniformity, twice, in the sense that both 3553(a)(4),\nwhich requires consideration of the guidelines, and\n3553(a)(6) talks about unwarranted --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. I -- I stand\ncorrected here. I'm sorry.\nMR. DWYER: But I agree with you that it is\na consideration -- and I'm not talking about a check\nlist. I'm not saying that we just use a list and that's\nenough. There has to -- I think sentencing under an\nadvisory system requires reason and judgment. We tried\nto stress in our brief that judgment is somehow\ndifferent. It may involve fact-finding but is not the\ndeterminant, the automatic jury kind of finding that the\nguidelines require.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, as one of the themes\nthat you advance, you indicate that if your approach is\nfollowed that the guidelines will then be adjusted over\ntime.\nI assume they would be adjusted to be more\nprecise, but then we are right back where we started\nbecause you want to give the guidelines very little\neffect. It seems to me, in a way, you're arguing\nagainst yourself.\nIf your view is accepted and the result is\nconsiderable disparity, I suppose all that Congress can\ndo is have mandatory minimums.\nMR. DWYER: I don't believe that, that the\nresults are going to be considerable disparity.\nCertainly no more disparity than existed under the\nmandatory guidelines which wasn't being addressed\nparticularly.\nI think indeed there may be more\nnon-guideline sentences, but less true disparity,\nbecause it really is kind of idle to talk about\ndisparity unless you are measuring it against something.\nAnd 3553(a) provides those purposes, and true disparity\nis measured --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think it is idle to\ntalk about disparity before the Sentencing Reform Act\nwas adopted? You remember those days.\nMR. DWYER: I do remember those days. And I\nthink there are two significant points about that. One,\njudges sentenced in the pre-Sentencing Reform Act,\nknowing that their sentence wasn't the real time served.\nSo that a judge may say 20 year sentence knowing the\ndefendant was immediately eligible for parole and was\ngoing to get out soon.\nThe real number was parole eligibility\nsentencing. So that looking at just the actual sentence\nimposed did not tell you very much about disparity. And\nnone -- in the study that the sentencing commission in\nits amicus cited -- that study explicitly said that none\nof the studies looking at pre-Sentencing Reform Act\ninterjudge disparity considered actual sentences served\nas opposed to actual sentences imposed.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, yeah. But there --\nyou know, we can go back into that, but there was a\nwhole history that people testified, tremendously, no\nopposition, virtually none, that you needed a judge\nwheel. Why do you need a judge wheel in New York if, in\nfact, the sentence didn't depend on the personality of\nthe judge? And why did you get different sentences\nacross the country which I don't -- I've never heard a\npossibility of explaining that the judges didn't\nunderstand what the parole commission was like. That's\na different issue.\nSo what -- what I'm concerned about is if we\nfollowed your position literally, what we're saying is\nthat the Constitution of the United States prevents any\neffort to create uniform sentences throughout the\ncountry for people who different judges -- God doesn't\ntell us what the right sentence is. We don't know.\nThere are reasonable sentences within a vast, vast range\nof possible sentences.\nAnd you're saying we have to go back to\nthat. And that wasn't -- I'm looking, in other words,\nfor you to tell me something that says we don't have to\nbe back to that, but we don't have to make it that rigid\neither. And that's what I'm looking for, to be honest\nwith you, and I haven't -- I'm not certain I get it.\nMR. DWYER: I don't believe that sentencing\nunder an effectively advisory system under the standards\nof appellate review that I've described, which I think\nis the standard Booker described, is in a sense an empty\nexercise on appeal, and leading simply --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Could you describe it\nagain? Because I'm not clear what your answer was to\nwhat the appellate court stance is. I take it the\nappellate court would owe deference to the district\ncourt's determination?\nMR. DWYER: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And no particular\ndeference to the guidelines?\nMR. DWYER: That would -- yes, I would agree\nwith that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So what is it other\nthan -- is this arbitrary and capricious?\nMR. DWYER: I think that the court of\nappeals will first look to ensure that there was\nreasoned elaboration of a judgment complying with\n3553(a), that the district court considered all of the\nfactors and arrived at a judgment that this sentence was\nsufficient but not greater than necessary.\nSecondly, I think that the court of appeals\nunder that deferential standard of review that Booker\ndescribed would look to see if this is a sentence that a\nreasonable judge would find sufficient but not greater\nthan necessary on those facts.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the -- one problem is\nthat two judges, both reasonable, might approach the\nfacts in this very case differently. That is, one as in\nthis case might think as she expressed it, to sentence\nhim to more than 15 months would throw away his life.\nAnother might say it's -- it's unreal to assume that he\njust sold 23 grams of crack when he admitted that he had\nbeen out on that same street every night for two and a\nhalf weeks. So the quantity is much larger. And he was\nin that sense a repeater, so I'm going to sentence him\nto at least the bottom of the guidelines, nothing less.\nThose could be reasonable determinations,\ntwo different reactions that judges would have to the\nsame set of facts.\nMR. DWYER: Yes. That is correct. And I\nthink that is what will result under an effectively\nadvisory system. But here we're talking --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In any case, you -- you,\nyou are not driven to the alternative that\nJustice Breyer suggests, that there is no way to achieve\nabsolute uniformity. It's very easy. It was what the\ndissenters in the Booker remedial phase urged, which is\nuse facts found by the jury and you can have the\nsentences as rigid as you like.\nIt is really only, only when you want to let\nthe facts be found by the judge that you come into the\ndifficulty that, that we're arguing about. But it's\ncertainly not decreed by logic or by heaven that there\nis no way to achieve determinate sentencing. There\ncertainly is.\nMR. DWYER: I agree, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do you agree? Because I\nthink that system would, in fact, give total sentencing\npower to the prosecutor, who would determine the\nsentence by the kind and degree of evidence that he\nintroduced and what he charged. So I agree that that\nmight produce some kind of judicial uniformity, but only\nbecause the prosecutor would have total power to decide\nwhat the sentence will be.\nMR. DWYER: Well, I -- I also appreciate the\ndialogue. And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't -- you don't have\nto engage in our dispute here.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: We're pointing out there\nare problems to every solution. And that's why I'm\nstill looking for the --\nMR. DWYER: And -- and one of the serious\nproblems in the solution that Booker chose is that while\njudicial discretion, which I think 3553(a) requires and\nmandates, and an advisory system requires, that, too,\ndoesn't deal with the necessary exercise of\nprosecutorial discretion which has an enormous thumb on\nthe scale, and which the district court, in the day to\nday work of the criminal system in the courts, in the\ndistrict courts, has a far greater appreciation for,\nthan a court of appeals would.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dwyer, before we get\nto the prosecutor, you were candid in saying a district\ncourt -- different district judges could act reasonably,\none of them giving whatever it was, 33 months, and the\nother giving 15 months, both of those would be\nreasonable and could be affirmed on appeal.\nBut one of, one of the arguments that was\nmade by defense counsel here was just there was -- there\nis an irrational disparity between the penalty for crack\nand the penalty for powdered cocaine.\nYour predecessor thought that was so wrong,\nhe thought it was unconstitutional. I think at the very\nleast you ought to take into account that if this man\nwere distributing or possessed for distribution powdered\ncocaine instead of crack, the sentence range, the\nguideline sentence range would have been six months to a\nyear. Now we know that Congress wanted to retain that\ndisparity. Is a district judge free to say under\nadvisory guidelines, I am going to ignore the\ndifference, I'm going to treat this defendant as though\nhe possessed powdered cocaine?\nMR. DWYER: I think that the judge in the\nobligation of imposing an individual sentence must\nconsider the advice of the guidelines but must also be\nfree to shape and tailor that advice as the\ncircumstances of that case require.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, specifically, can\nyou take into account, can he say I'm going to treat him\nas though he possessed powdered cocaine? Can he do\nthat? Yes or no?\nMR. DWYER: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though we know that\nCongress didn't want that to happen?\nMR. DWYER: Yes, because I think if the\njudge can elaborate reasons to justify that judgment in\nthat case --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's got nothing\nto do with that case. That's got something to do with a\njudgment apart from the particulars of the case about\nwhether crack should be treated the same as powdered\ncrack cocaine. It's got nothing to do with the\nindividual case.\nMR. DWYER: Well, I beg to differ, Chief\nJustice Roberts, because the differences were predicated\non assumptions about the type of individuals who would\nengage in that. And the court in her experience could\nlook at it and say you aren't the typical crack\ndefendant, you are more like the people who come before\nme who are involved in powdered cocaine, or you don't\npossess the violence, the weaponry and the other things\nthat justified Congress's decision to create disparate\nsentences for these two kinds of cocaine.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think you ran away\nfrom Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical just a little bit.\nLet's assume that Congress wants to keep this\ndistinction and let's assume that there's no\nconstitutional problem with the distinction. There\nmight be, but let's assume.\nCan the judge simply say, I ignore that\ncongressional -- congressional judgment is wrong. I'm\nnot going to do that.\nMR. DWYER: I don't think that the district\njudge's role is to make categorical pronouncements.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the judge permitted --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: To what extent is the\nCongress's purpose later than the Congress that enacted\nthe statute we're construing? The statute we're\nconstruing was enacted by one Congress and these\nexpressions came later.\nMR. DWYER: Well, I would resolve the\nproblem by saying that the district judge must consider\nthe guidelines. The district judge doesn't sit in\nreview of the policy. It has to apply it to a specific\nperson. In a particular case, as in Mario Claiborne's,\nthat policy produced a sentence that would have been too\ngreat.\nAnd the application had some numbers to it,\nso she said it was more serious because it was a crack\ncocaine case, you're going to get more than somebody who\nwas involved with powder would get, but you don't need\nto get as much as the guidelines call for, for the\nreasons that she expressed on the record at the\nsentencing.\nIf I could reserve the balance of my time,\nunless there are other questions?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nDwyer. Mr. Dreeben.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis Court in Booker concluded that the\nremedial severing of the statute's provision for\nmandatory application of the guidelines and a provision\ngoverning the standards of review on appeal rendered the\nstatute constitutional. It further implied a standard\nof review of reasonableness of guideline sentences on\nappeal, and it did not elaborate what that\nreasonableness requirement means.\nThe Government submits that the best\ninterpretation of a reasonableness form of review would\nbe one that conforms as closely as it can to Congress's\noriginal intent of minimizing and eliminating\nunwarranted sentencing disparities between similarly\nsituated defendants.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: As closely as it can, and\nthe \"as it can\" depends upon violation of the Sixth\nAmendment by entitling defendants to sentences\ndetermined by facts found by a judge instead of a jury.\nSuppose in this case the court of appeals\ninstead of disallowing the lower sentence, approved it?\nAnd then in the next case that comes up involving what\nwas the small amount of equivalent, 5.26 grams of\ncocaine powder rather than crack, okay? Suppose in the\nnext case it would have been 30 grams of powder. And\nthe district court judge once again departs just the way\nthe departure was here, and the court of appeals says\nno, that departure is unreasonable.\nYou now have circuit law which says 30\ngrams, you get the guidelines sentence; 5.26 grams,\nyou're entitled to a lesser sentence. Okay?\nWhy isn't -- why haven't we fallen back into\nthe same problem that produced Booker/Fanfan? You have\nfact findings being made by the judge. It's a judge who\ndecides whether it's 30 grams or 5.26 grams. What\ndifference does it make whether that factual difference\nproduces an entitlement to a sentence on the basis of\nthe guidelines or on the basis of an opinion by or a\nseries of opinion by a court of appeals? Isn't the\nSixth Amendment equally violated?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, as I think we\ntalked about in the last argument, in theory it could be\nif this Court concludes that judicial determinations on\nappeal are equivalent to guidelines promulgated by a\ncommission or statute, and if what the court of appeals\ndoes is essentially function as a sentencing commission,\nliterally prescribing particular levels of punishment\nfor recurring sets of facts.\nThe Government's submission here is not that\nthe court of appeals has to do that in order to apply a\nproportionality principle. A proportionality principle\nwill look to all of the facts of the case and will try\nto get a handle on, is this a reasonable sentence in\nresponse to all of the facts and circumstances that the\njudge articulated within --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But if you have two cases\nthat are in other respects similar, and the court of\nappeals has held 5.26 is too little to apply the\nguidelines, it's okay to depart downward the way this\njudge did, it seems to me that the next case that comes\nup, the defendant has an entitlement to that lower\nsentence.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, he doesn't, Justice\nScalia, because the second defendant may not encounter a\njudge who concludes that that quantity warrants the same\nlevel of leniency or any leniency at all. That judge\nwill retain the judge's classic discretion to look at\nthe totality of the facts and conclude whether a\nsentence that would be below the range is a reasonable\nsentence. And unlike a situation that some of us might\nprefer in which the court of appeals would ensure that\nlike cases are treated with reasonable consistency, the\nsystem of reasonableness review on top of advisory\nguidelines will not produce perfect levels of\nconsistency.\nAnd what the defendant is entitled to under\nthe Sixth Amendment rulings of this Court is knowing\nthat if the law says if I commit this crime and these\nare the facts that support it, my level of sentence is\nthis and no higher, that any higher sentence that's\nproduced by a fact finding gives him a jury trial\nentitlement. That's what the Sixth Amendment entitles\nyou.\nBut no defendant who commits a crack offense\ncan say that even after a series of court of appeals\nrulings that mark out various points of reasonableness.\nThat defendant will not know whether the judge that he\nor she appears in front of will give the same kind of\nweight to those facts as some other judge did who was\naffirmed or reversed. Nor will that judge be able to\nsay what is the constellation of policy and factual\nreasons that this particular judge will find in\nannouncing the judge's sentence.\nSo I don't think that a proportionality\nprinciple runs afoul of the Sixth Amendment. And I\ndon't think that it runs afoul of anything in 3553(a) or\nany other part of the statute. What the Court is left\nwith is the task of interpreting reasonableness, and I\nsubmit it should ask the same question that it asked in\nBooker itself: Which alternative, the Petitioner's\nalternative in this case or the Government's, conforms\nmore closely to Congress's original claim in the\nSentencing Reform Act?\nThe Petitioner's version of appellate review\nas I understand it is very light review, if at all, of\nthe substance of what the district judge does. It may\nreach a truly extreme case such as if a judge said a\nsecond degree murderer, I think probation is the\nappropriate sentence. Perhaps the Petitioner would\nconcede that that would be arbitrary and irrational; but\nbeyond such an extreme case that it is so unlikely to\narise that Petitioner can feel free to give it away,\nPetitioner gives the Court nothing, and gives the courts\nof appeals nothing to apply standards to determine\nwhether a particular sentence is reasonable. And that\nis what the court of appeals have been reaching for when\neight of them have adopted this proportionality\nprinciple.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question:\nIt seems to me that in sentencing there are two\ndifferent broad categories of decision that the judge\nhas to make, one involving the severity of the crime,\nand the other the characteristics of the particular\noffender.\nAnd might it not be the case that you give a\ngreater presumption of following the guidelines when\nyou're talking about the severity of the offense, and a\ngreater deference to the trial judge when you're\nevaluating the factors of the individual that might\naffect the sentence? There might be a difference in the\n--\nMR. DREEBEN: I think at a high level of\ngenerality, that is true. Because what the sentencing\ncommission is good at is taking paradigmatic\ncircumstances and assigning them a numerical weight that\nwill transfer into a sentence. And what the strength of\nthe district judge is is looking at the defendant in\nfront of that particular judge and seeing how that\nperson's characteristics may map onto the policies of\nsentencing.\nBut I don't agree that that distinction\nwould support a two-track form of appellate review that\nwould give the district judge greater deference to take\npersonal characteristics into account and to impose\nwidely varying sentences. That is exactly the situation\nthat we had in the pre Sentencing Reform Act era when\nany district judge could choose whatever policies of\nsentencing appeal to that judge, find the facts, and\nimpose a widely disparate sentence. And as the Court\nwell knows, there was no appellate review of that\nexercise of discretion unless it could be shown that the\njudge didn't exercise discretion at all.\nNow it is not an exercise of discretion if a\njudge simply says for this crime, I always give the same\nsentence. That would not take into account the full\nrange of facts and factors that are present in the\nsentencing court and as a result, that wouldn't be an\nexercise of discretion.\nBut in the pre Sentencing Reform Act era,\nthe judge had pretty much plenary reign to decide what\nfacts mattered. If we continue with that same sort of\ndeference on appeal in the Booker remedial opinion, then\nit's hard for me to see how appellate review can serve\nany valid purpose of channeling and ensuring some\nconsistency and uniformity in the way district judges\nimpose sentencing.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What do you think about\ntaking some of the Rivera ideas -- I'm slightly\nhypothesizing this -- and following up with what\nJustice Stevens said. You'd say look, one thing a\ndistrict judge can't say, he can't say that I believe\nthe guideline is right for a typical case. And I think\nthis is a typical case. And I won't follow the\nguideline. You couldn't think those three things?\nMR. DREEBEN: I agree.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So one big power a judge\nhas that they didn't have before, after Booker, is to\nsay the guideline itself is unreasonable. So we're --\nlet's just say -- and there if they say that, the\ndistrict judge could decide whether or not, the court of\nappeals could decide is the guideline reasonable or not\nreasonable. But leave those cases aside. I imagine\nthey'll be few and far between.\nNow we take one they assume is reasonable.\nAnd now unlike the past, the judge has to do three\nthings. One, to give the kind of thing that -- the\nreason he's not following the guideline, which he admits\nis reasonable for a typical case. So what's the kind of\nthing that leads you to think yours is not typical? And\nhe says it. And then he has the evidence as to the\nrelated facts. And then he has the degree of departure.\nAs to the first thing, the court of appeals\ncould review it and decide whether it is or is not the\nkind of thing. As to the second and third, they also\ncould review it but only after giving considerable\nweight to what the district judge thinks about the case\nin front of him.\nNow maybe that's -- I mean, you might not\nhave a reaction to that. I'd have to sort of think\nabout it.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Breyer, if the\nsystem that you're describing is a replica of the system\nthat existed under Koon versus United States --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Not quite --\nMR. DREEBEN: -- then it runs into the same\nproblem that led to the constitutional problem in\nBooker. Where I think I would amend Your Honor's\nproposal is that if the judge concludes that this is a\ntypical case but the guideline really doesn't prescribe\nwhat I think is a reasonable sentence and here are the\nreasons why, in the pre-Sentencing -- in the pre-Booker\nsystem, that could have been problematic legally.\nToday, it is not forbidden. But what it should be\nsubject to is a reasonableness review check on appeal\nthat take a look at what are the reasons that the\ndistrict judge articulated for that sentence.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why, why do we assume that\nthe district judge cannot depart from the guideline\nrecommendation unless he thinks the guideline\nrecommendation is unreasonable? He doesn't -- does he\nhave to find it's unreasonable? There can certainly be\ntwo reasonable sentences; and he's under no obligation\nto select the guidelines sentence, is he?\nMR. DREEBEN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So he doesn't have to\ndetermine that it's unreasonable. I don't think we\nshould approach the discussion as though that's, that's\nthe situation.\nMR. DREEBEN: I do think, though, that the\nCourt should be concerned about each district judge\nformulating his or her own set of personal sentencing\nguidelines and then applying them in the court to the\ncases that appear on that judge's docket without any\ncheck on appellate review to ensure that, although the\nsentence might be in some possible world reasonable,\nit's out of whack with what the Sentencing Commission\nhas prescribed and what other district judges are doing.\nIf there is no check on appeal, then I do think that the\nclock has been turned back to the 1983 era before the\nSentencing Reform Act; and that does not seem to me a\nreasonable interpretation of what the Booker remedial\nopinion thought it was accomplishing. What the Booker\nremedial opinion said that it was accomplishing was\nproviding an important mechanism that Congress itself\nhad intended, namely appellate review, in order to iron\nout sentencing differences.\nAnd our submission is that inherently means\nsome form of substantive proportionality review.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's the other thing I'm\nnot certain about, the proportionality, and the reason\nI'm not certain of it is I'm not certain what it means.\nThat is, it sounds nice, as if you're saying something,\nbut proportional to what? I mean, I can think of two\nproblems. One problem, of course, is that the chart in\nthe guidelines is written on a logarithmic scale and\nthat means that if you move from one level, from 9 to\n10, it's 3 months or 2 months; if you move from 29 to\n30, it's 2 years.\nNow, whether you're at 29-30 or whether\nyou're at 9 and 10 might depend upon things that just\nhave nothing to do with your reason for departure. You\nmight have added on something for having a gun and your\nreason for being lenient might have to do with the\nperson's having a gun. So you're going to say it make a\ndifference whether you were high up or whether you were\nlow down, when your reason for departing has nothing to\ndo with whether you're high up or whether you were low\ndown? You see? It doesn't actually work, I don't\nthink, proportionality review, because it's so hard to\nsay what's proportional.\nMR. DREEBEN: I think what is proportional\nis a matter of common sense, and the eight circuits that\nhave been using this rule have not had a great deal of\ndifficulty in noting that you look at the extent to\nwhich the sentence varies from the guidelines range, you\nlook at the absolute amount of time that's involved, and\nhave a sense of is this a significant deviation away\nfrom what the guidelines would actually describe.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why use the word\n\"proportional,\" because the other thing is what the\nChief Justice brought out, is that why is it that if a\nperson has a bad reason, I mean, why should a bad reason\njustify a little departure rather than a lot? And if he\nhas a good reason, well, why doesn't it justify a lot\njust as much as it might justify a little?\nMR. DREEBEN: If the sentencing court\narticulates a bad reason, namely a reason that's\nirrational or one that does not respond to facts of the\ncase, then that really shouldn't justify the sentence at\nall and what the court of appeals should do is vacate\nit, send it back for resentencing, and allow the\ndistrict court to articulate the reasons why the\nsentence that the court now chooses to impose is an\nappropriate sentence under 3553(a).\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dreeben, if we could\nfocus on the facts of this case and what the district\ncourt appeared to do, she made a kind of proportionality\njudgment, too. She said this is a young man. It's his\nfirst offense. He has a good family relationship, a\ngood work record. I am making a determination that will\nput him away for a significant amount of time. But I'm\ntrying to figure the point at which he will lose touch\nwith his family, with his work, he will be thrown away.\nThat was the judgment that she made. She\ntried to make a sentence that would be significant, 15\nmonths, but that would not be so long that it would put\nhim out of touch with his children and his wife and his\nwork.\nNow, in -- by some measures that would be\nentirely reasonable. But on your measure, it isn't\nreasonable.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's right. And I think,\nJustice Ginsburg, you've done a better job of\narticulating a justification for the sentence than the\njudge's own articulation, which did not focus on family\nseparation and employment to the degree that you have\nnow articulated it. What the judge did was focus on the\nquantity of drugs and the fact that the defendant didn't\nhave any criminal history and that he qualified for the\nsafety valve.\nShe also said, without specifying any other\ncases, that other cases that have come before my court\nhave had -- you know -- perhaps larger quantity of drugs\nand very different sentences. When a court of appeals\nis asked to review that line of reasoning and try to\ndecide whether the outside the guidelines sentence is\nreasonable, it makes sense for the court to ask, do we\nknow anything, for example, about what this judge is\nsaying about other cases with other drug quantities?\nThere's no specifics in the record that enable the Court\nof Appeals to measure the accuracy or the validity of\nthat observation. It's also relevant for the court of\nappeals to say the guidelines range itself has taken\ninto account all of the factors that this judge has\npreviously noted and what has happened in the sentence\nis that the judge has varied widely from the sentence\nfor reasons that the commission already took into\naccount. Now, that doesn't prohibit the judge from\nrelying on those facts, but it does mean that the\nfarther the sentence goes from the guidelines range the\nmore likely there is to be unwarranted disparity.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you did leave out\nwhat -- she didn't elaborate on it, but she said, I\nwould be throwing him away. And I take it what she was\nsaying by that is it would be -- he would be\nincarcerated beyond the point where he could reintegrate\ninto the community.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, this brings me to my\nlast point about this particular sentencing, which is\nthat in this very case Judge Jackson looked at the\ndefendant. She said, candidly I don't know really very\nmuch about you other than what I've learned about in the\npresentence report and I can't tell whether you're\nunlucky or you're stupid, and then effectively gave him\na sentence that reflected, you know, a tremendous\nindulgence of a presumption that maybe this kid needs a\nwakeup call and nothing more. What she ignored is his\nown proffer in the safety valve that he had been on a\nstreet corner for 2-1/2 months selling crack cocaine,\nthat he was arrested and placed into the State system,\nput into a pretrial diversion program through a drug\ncourt, in essence being said, here's your chance, you\nknow, straighten up, we are going to be lenient on you,\nwe're going to give you an opportunity to reintegrate\nwith your family, and what did the defendant do but get\ncaught within 6 months with 5 grams of crack.\nAnd on that record -- and this is what the\ncourt of appeals said -- there's a disconnect between\nthe judge's conclusion that, with little information\nmore than what she had in the PSR, the kid deserved\nleniency versus the fact that he had already had that\nchance and he had not --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but didn't the court\nof appeals draw the inference that he had been\ndistributing drugs during that 6-month period and that\nwas not supported by the record? Am I wrong on that?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Stevens, we're\nnot relying on the inference of the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would it have been error\nfor the court of appeals to find a fact like that that\nwas not supported by the record and didn't it do it in\nthis case.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, supported by the record\nis something of a judgment call. You'd have to assume\nthat Mr. Claiborne was found by the police, 6 months\nafter he had previously been arrested for crack\noffenses, holding a 5-gram bag of crack and that was the\nvery first time after his arrest that he had been in\npossession of drugs, that just he got extremely\nunlikely, the police caught him.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And the court of appeals\nis willing to draw a factual conclusion that he had in\nfact distributed during that 6-month period?\nMR. DREEBEN: That's right. And I would say\nthat a reasonable fact-finder could draw that\nconclusion.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But should the court of\nappeals act as a fact-finder in that posture of the\ncase?\nMR. DREEBEN: Not in my view. And I think\non this record that's not a fact that we're relying on.\nIt's not a fact that the Government --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is it not possibly a fact\nthat would justify the conclusion that they committed\nerror?\nMR. DREEBEN: This aspect of the court of\nappeals opinion in my view is not essential to the\njudgment that it reached, which is correct.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It may not have been\nessential, but it may have contributed to their\njudgment.\nMR. DREEBEN: It may have, but what they did\nnot mention is an equally validate reason for concluding\nthat this is a defendant who is in effect a recidivist\neven though he had no criminal history. He had been\npreviously arrested for crack distribution crimes. He\nhad admitted that this was not -- the occasion of his\narrest wasn't the first opportunity that he had to deal\ncrack. He'd been doing it for 2-1/2 months. And the\njudge essentially turned all of those facts off. She\ndid not really factor that into her sentence at all.\nAnd the court of appeals, although it may\nhave fastened on the wrong time frame in concluding that\nthis defendant was in effect a recidivist and not the\nsort of blameless ingenue that the trial judge had\ntreated him as, the record does indeed support the court\nof appeals' central conclusion, which is this defendant,\ndespite his criminal history, really looks more like a\nrecidivist. And when you're talking about a defendant\nwhose mandatory minimum sentence would have been 5\nyears, but who gets out of that sentence because he\nsatisfies the safety valve which allows defendant who is\na first-time offender and meets certain other\nrequirements to get a sentence under the mandatory\nminimum, that defendant's culpability had already been\nsubstantially reduced under the guidelines because of\nthe safety valve and because of his criminal history.\nAnd the judge basically said: I'm going to take a\nchance with him and give him a much lower sentence than\nwhat the guidelines described.\nOur view is the judge can look at the facts\nshe looked at, but she went down to a level that is\nproductive of unwarranted disparity.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask just one other\nquestion? I do not understand you to argue that the\ncourt of appeals can apply a presumption of\nunreasonableness just because there's a departure.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's correct. We're not\narguing for a presumption of unreasonableness on appeal.\nWe're arguing for a presumption of reasonableness for a\nguidelines sentence. For an out of guidelines sentence\nthere is no presumption that it is unreasonable, but the\ncourt of appeals under a proportionality analysis would\nlook and require increasingly strong reasons with the\nincreasing degree of variance from --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's the part, they said\nthat. An extraordinary reduction must be supported by\nextraordinary circumstances. What worries me about that\nit sounds like a slogan. I would think an extraordinary\nreduction must be supported by whatever reasons that\njustify the extraordinary reduction, period.\nAnd it also sounds like you're going to\nstart getting a mechanical set of charts and things,\nwhich is going to be a true nightmare, and if we really\nwere to repeat that it would take on a tremendous force\nof generative law which would worry me quite a lot\nbecause I just think it's too complex to reduce to a\nformula. What you want is a reason that supports the\nsentence.\nIt is --\nMR. DREEBEN: I think you want a better\nreason for a sentence that is farther away from some\nmean.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Better than what? Better\nthan justifies it?\nMR. DWYER: Perhaps the best way to do this\nis to give a example. Suppose that the shoe were on the\nother foot. Suppose that Judge Jackson had looked at\nthis defendant and said, you know, this defendant did\nnot learn from his experience. He was given leniency in\nthe State court. He didn't take advantage of that\nopportunity. His statutory maximum is 20 years and I'm\ngoing to give him, maybe not the statutory maximum, I'm\ngoing to give him an 18-year sentence, or suppose she\nsaid a 15-year sentence or a 10-year sentence.\nI submit that in that circumstances the\nPetitioner would be here saying, well, the guidelines\nrecommended a sentence of between 37 and 46 months and\nthis is a dramatic increase from that and the reason is\nnot something that's particularly unusual, it's a very\nusual reason, and as a result, the magnitude of this\ndeviation is unreasonable.\nAnd I have no problem with a Petitioner\nmaking that argument if that's what happens to his or\nher client. My problem is that without that kind of\nanchoring effect of the guidelines in a proportionality\nreview, a court of appeals has almost nothing to work\nwith.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But what happens when that\ncase -- it goes back down to the district court. The\ndistrict court says well, okay, not 10 years. Nine\nyears. Okay? It goes back up. I mean, you know, when\ndo we end this game? Or does the court of appeals take\nover the sentencing function and specify -- you know,\nfive years?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, I don't think\nthat the courts of appeals are, at least absent very\nunusual circumstances, to act as sentencers to specify a\nsentence. There have been a couple of instances where\ncourts of appeals have said this is really the bottom\nsentence that we can see that would be reasonable on\nthis particular constellation of facts. I think that\nreflect as sense of potential impatience with a\nping-pong game that would occur if the court of appeals\nsays your sentence is unreasonable, Mr. District Judge,\nand the district judge imposes a sentence that's one day\nlower.\nAnother solution to that problem would be\nreassignment to a different judge who would start with a\nclean slate and could read the court of appeals' opinion\nand apply the section 3553 factors.\nWe are not suggesting that the court of\nappeals should assume the sentencing role here. All\nwe're suggesting is that the court of appeals needs to\nhave some intelligible legal principles that allow it to\nidentify and select unreasonable sentences versus\nreasonable sentences; and when you have wide statutory\nranges as you do in the Federal system, if you don't\nhave the guidelines describing at least a benchmark,\nit's not more, then I don't think courts of appeals have\na good, coherent, consistent way of fulfilling their\ntasks. And if the courts of appeals can do that, can\nlook more with greater scrutiny at a sentence the\nfarther that it goes outside the guidelines range,\nwithout violating the statute and without violating the\nConstitution, then it seems to me the only thing for the\nCourt to ask at that point is which approach, that\napproach of proportionality, or and approach that\nbasically says appellate review is procedural only,\nabsent the most glaringly aberrant sentences, conforms\nto Congress's intent of producing a greater degree of\nuniformity and consistency.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it wouldn't be, just\nbe procedural only. You -- you could say procedural\nplus, you know, certainly review of the facts on, on\nwhich the district court was -- was proceeding. So you,\nif you could find that the determination that this was\njust a good kid who made a mistake is, is an\nunreasonable finding, you could reverse for that reason.\nMR. DREEBEN: That -- that is true. But I\nsubmit that -- I would like to hear what Petitioner has\nto say. If Petitioner's client had been given 10 years\nin this case, I have no doubt that Petitioner would be\narguing that's an unreasonable sentence. But I don't\nsee how you reach that judgment assuming that the court\nhas articulated a rationale that's consistent with\nsection 3553 and a rational interpretation of the facts,\nunless you have the guidelines as an anchor for the\nanalysis.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nDreeben.\nMr. Dwyer, you have two minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL DWYER,\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. DWYER: I believe that Justice Breyer\nput his finger on one of the central problems with the\nGovernment's proposed rule. And that is what does it\nmean? The Government talks about substantial variances\nin Petitioner's case. The court of appeals spoke of it\nas extraordinary variances. And the Government doesn't\nsuggest to us that substantial means the same thing or\nmeans something different from extraordinary. And we've\nalready demonstrated in our brief why relying on\npercentages as the court of appeals also did, is\npointless, because, one, if -- the arithmetic gets very\ncomplicated at the low end and the percentages just\ndon't make any sense from a proper application of a rule\nof law.\nThe Government's proposal, apart from having\nno basis in the statute and no basis in Booker, is just\nnot susceptible of any kind of application because\nnobody really knows what it means.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about Mr.\nDreeben's parting challenge? What are you going to do\nif your client gets 10 years? You're going to argue\nthat's an extraordinary departure from the guidelines,\nright?\nMR. DWYER: I'm certainly going to argue\nthat under the facts and the record before the Court,\nthat was not a sentence that was sufficient but not\ngreater than necessary. And I think the absence of a\nprior record, the young man's work history, all of those\nfactors, the low amount of crack cocaine involved, his\nage, all of the things which as Justice Ginsburg pointed\nout that judge relied on in her sentencing decision,\ncould not possibly support a 10-year sentence.\nAnd you know, it is easy to do this in a, in\na hypothetical sort of way. But the district judge --\nand this was a very experienced district judge --\nlooking at the person in the eye, made a call based on\njudgment. And that call was not treated with any\nrespect in the court of appeals. It was sloganeered\naway as an extraordinary variance. And -- because the\ncourt of appeals focused only on the guidelines.\nThe -- this Court in crafting the appellate\nstandard can't just look to determine what Congress\nmight have intended because of the constitutional\nproblem that lurks behind it. And that constitutional\nproblem is a resumption of mandatory guidelines.\nThank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\n"
