        "content": "(10:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in No. 02-954, the Office of Independent Counsel v.\nAllan J. Favish.\nMs. Millett.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA MILLETT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn the course of their investigative work,\nFederal law enforcement officials, of necessity, routinely\ncome into possession of substantial amounts of highly\nsensitive and highly personal information. Sometimes that\ninformation includes graphic death scene and autopsy\nphotographs. Those photographs are taken for the limited\nand restricted use of law enforcement and public safety\nofficials. They are not freely available to the general\npublic as a matter of law, custom, or practice.\nThe question presented in this case is whether\ndeath scene photographs should be broadly disclosed to the\ngeneral public under the Freedom of Information Act. They\nshould not. The Freedom of Information Act's purpose is\nnot maximum disclosure, but responsible disclosure, and\nthe publication of death scene photographs goes beyond the\nbounds of responsible disclosure, because in the terms of\nexemption 7(C), production could reasonably be expected to\nconstitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy\nof surviving family members.\nIn ordering the release of four photographs in\nthis case, the court of appeals recognized that that\nsubstantial intrusion on privacy would occur, but it then\ncommitted three errors in assessing the countervailing\npublic interest in disclosure.\nQUESTION: Must there be identifiable family\nmembers to suffer this invasion of privacy? Would it just\nbe automatic instead? The - a scene like this, you would\nassume that there was someone?\nMS. MILLETT: No, the - the practice of the\nFederal Government is that we need to identify the\nexistence of a survivor. There was a case in the D.C. -\nexcuse me - District Court, named Outlaw, that I believe\nwas cited in respondent's brief, where the Department of\nDefense had asserted survivor privacy without having first\nidentified a survivor, and that was held to be\nimpermissible, and as a matter of practice, because this\nis sort of specialized application of privacy interest,\nthe Government identifies a survivor before invoking it.\nBut that is often not a difficult job because the types of\nrecords that bring the photos to us, law enforcement\nrecords, military records when it's a military service\nmember who's been autopsied, will often contain, or allow\nthe identification, of family members.\nQUESTION: And if you're so unfortunate as not to\nhave survivors, or to have survivors who don't like you,\nthe most embarrassing and gory photographs of your body\ncan be released?\nMS. MILLETT: Well, Justice Scalia, that has been\nthe practice after the Outlaw decision of the Federal\nGovernment. It - it's not inconceivable to me that\nbecause you're talking about an objective test, at least\nunder 7(C) - some of these photographs are held - upheld\nunder - or withheld under exemption 6, which doesn't have\nthe same objective test language. It's not inconceivable\nthat the Government could justify withholding, in a\nsituation like after the collapse of the World Trade\nCenter towers, and their substantial amounts of - sorry,\nbut, for the graphic nature - but partial remains that\ncan't be matched with particular individuals.\nBut we know that for some significant percentage\nof those people, there are a significant percentage of\nsurvivors on a match for match. In that case, I think we\nwould argue should not be required and that withholding\ncould be done because we -\nQUESTION: But only on the assumption that there\nare survivors?\nMS. MILLETT: On the assumption that there - a\nreasonable - obviously, a reasonable assumption -\nQUESTION: I don't know why that's necessary. I\ndon't know why you - you can't say, and I think some\ncourts have held, have they not, that - that there is a\nprivacy interest in the - in the person who's died?\nMS. MILLETT: For the most part, courts have said\nthat privacy dies with the individual, but again, the\nproblem in this case is the Ninth Circuit didn't think we\nwere withholding too little. It rule - it ruled that we\nwere withholding too much that - and that, in fact, when\nthere are known survivors, these - these disturbing\nphotographs still have to be released.\nthey committed three errors.\nQUESTION: Before we get to that though, on the\nquestion that was asked, if there are no survivors, given\nthat the main rule of FOIA is disclosed, unless you fall\nunder an exemption, and exemptions are to be narrowly\nconstrued, I don't think the - the Government could\nsuppose, could hypothesize an interest that may or may not\nhave existed in the decedent when there are no survivors.\nMS. MILLETT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, that has\nbeen the Government's practice, is to identify a survivor,\nbut again, I think our position is, because the nature of\nour world has changed and we now have to deal with\nsituations involving mass deaths, that we aren't going to\ninsist when you have a large collection of remains and we\nknow that for some percentage of those there - there are\nsurvivors, that withholding would still be permissible.\nQUESTION: But why is that any less of a leap\nthan saying the deceased - the deceased's privacy is being\ninvaded? Why is it less of a leap to say that the privacy\n- the privacy of the survivors is being invaded? It\ndoesn't seem to me that it's - it's their privacy that's\nbeing invaded. It's - it's their - their sensitivity,\nvarious other things, but - but it seems to me strange to\nspeak of their having a privacy interest. Surely they\nhave an interest in not having their - their - their\nrelative displayed this way, but I - I wouldn't normally\ncall that a privacy interest.\nMS. MILLETT: Well, Justice Scalia, the common\nlaw - a number of common law courts did, and they did -\nand we cite - one of the very first common law courts ever\nto recognize the right to privacy, in 1895, the Schuler v.\nCurtis case, which is cited in our reply brief, found\nexactly a privacy interest in the survivors, and it said\nit is not the privacy interest of the deceased, because\nunder the common law tradition, privacy dies with the\nindividual.\nBut what's being protected here is the\nsurvivors. It sort of takes three forms, first of all,\ntheir - their memory of the deceased, their ability to\nprovide a dignified disposition of the body, and the\nability to have seclusion in their grief and repose and\nclosure. And those concepts packaged together have been\nrecognized as a privacy right, both at tort law by a\nnumber of courts, and more broadly, by custom and practice\nin this country. These types of photographs are not\nfreely available virtually anywhere. A large number of\nstates, as we've cited in our brief, prevent their\ndisclosure or have restrictions on their disclosure.\nQUESTION: Well, I guess we're, in this case,\nasked to apply FOIA's exemption 7(C) to interpret it\nanyway.\nMS. MILLETT: Yes.\nQUESTION: Right?\nMS. MILLETT: Yes.\nQUESTION: So that's what we're focused on.\nMS. MILLETT: Yes.\nQUESTION: And what do you propose as the test?\nMS. MILLETT: The test - the test is, as this\nCourt has - to decide whether a - a invasion of privacy is\nclearly unwarranted, you have to weigh and balance the\nintrusion on privacy against the extent to which the\ninformation disclosed would, in this Court's Reporters\nCommittees decision, contribute significantly to public\nunderstanding of the operations or activities of the\nFederal Government. And in this case, on one side of the\nbalance is a substantial intrusion on privacy, requiring -\nexposing this sort of information out where family\nmembers will see it, encounter it, where they will know\nthat their - that their loved one has not been buried in\nany sense.\nQUESTION: Is that the test that the CADC used in\nthe Accuracy in Media case involving these same photos?\nMS. MILLETT: They used a - the same balancing.\nThey recognized the -\nQUESTION: So whatever you're proposing, you\nthink the CADC correctly employed in that case?\nMS. MILLETT: The - there - with - with one\nqualification, which I don't think is a distinction -\ndon't think it's a distinction that makes a difference.\nCertainly on the privacy interest side, they agreed with\nus that there's a survivor privacy interest and that that\nhas to be balanced under this Court's Reporters Committee\nstandard.\nNow, the D.C. Circuit has said with - when the\npublic interest that's asserted is substantial allegation,\nor is unsubstantiated allegations of governmental\nmisconduct, that's not enough. They require compelling\nevidence of governmental misconduct to overcome the\npresumption of regularity. We've articulated the test is\nclear as evidence. I don't think in practice there's any\ndifference. We've employed the clear evidence standard\nbecause that's the standard this Court has adopted for\novercoming a presumption of regularity.\nQUESTION: I'm - I'm - I'm glad you backed off\nfrom compelling evidence. It seems to me if there were\ncompelling evidence of Government's misdoing, you wouldn't\nneed the photographs. If it was already compelling, the\nphotographs would - would not prove anything additional\nand you would - you would reject it for that reason,\nright?\nMS. MILLETT: That may - that may well be. The\ncompelling - the way the compelling evidence standard\nworks, as we understand it, and the way the clear evidence\nstandard works that we propose is not that that means you\nget the photographs. It just means that you have\nsomething of weight on your side of the balance. We think\nthe unsubstantiated allegations of governmental misconduct\nare worth virtually none, if no weight -\nQUESTION: But are the - does the term compelling\ninterest refer to the allegations that the person seeking\nthe photographs makes, or the evidence he has supporting\nhis position?\nMS. MILLETT: It has to be the - the evidence of\ngovernmental misconduct. Empty allegations -\nQUESTION: Independently of what the - the\nphotographs themselves would show?\nMS. MILLETT: That - I mean, that presumably will\nnot be the evidence, right, you can't just come say that -\nthat would be sort of boot-strapping to say that the\nevidence is the - I have to see that so that I will have\nmy evidence of your governmental misconduct, which\nessentially -\nQUESTION: Okay, tell me again what - what the\ntest is as you - you understand it.\nMS. MILLETT: The - the test - you mean with\nrespect to unsubstantiated allegations of governmental\nmisconduct?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. MILLETT: That is that the FOIA requester\nmust come forward with clear evidence of governmental\nmisconduct on their own, independent evidence on their\nown, to have a cognizable public interest to weigh against\nthe intrusion on privacy that has occurred in this case.\nAnd that is the standard that this - the clear evidence\nstandard comes from this Court's decisions, which say that\nis the quantum of evidence needed to overcome the\npresumption of regularity and legitimacy that attaches in\nthis case to law enforcement investigations.\nQUESTION: Does the Government - does the\nGovernment - as I understand FOIA, the Government has the\nburden of proof, the Government presents an exemption and\nit is the Government's burden to show that the exemption\napplies, not the requester, because going in, am I right\nto say, the requester can ask for this information for any\nreason or no reason?\nMS. MILLETT: That - that's - with respect -\nuntil an exemption is triggered, there's no need to have\nany reason for your FOIA. You can have a good reason, a\nbad reason, or no reason to ask for information, but -\nQUESTION: So what is the Government's burden\nthat it has, at least the initial burden is on the\nGovernment to show what?\nMS. MILLETT: The - the initial burden on the\nGovernment is once an exemption - we have to show that an\nexemption is triggered. We have to, in this situation,\nidentify a cognizable privacy interest which -\nQUESTION: Now, after you point to which number,\n7, you point to 7(C) and that - that - the burden must be\nmore than just, say -\nMS. MILLETT: No, that - that's right, in fact,\nwe get the written steps. We have to identify a\ncognizable privacy interest and then, before we make a\ndecision to withhold, we ourselves must make the - must\nbalance. It's our job to do this balancing before we\ninvoke an exemption, so we ourselves will then try to\nidentify if we can from the requester's papers or on our\nown what public interest would be served by the disclosure\nof these documents.\nNow, it's not the particular interest of the\nrequester, but it's the relationship between this document\nand serving the public interest that was identified in\nReporters Committee of revealing the operations or\nactivities of the Government. So in this case, we looked,\nwe found a substantial privacy interest here, and then we\nlooked at photographs of a deceased body at a death scene\nand in our judgement, these reveal nothing about the\noperations or activities of the Office of Independent\nCounsel and - and -\nQUESTION: Ms. Millett, you - you - you say that\nyou have to show clear evidence of - have clear evidence\nof government misconduct. What do you mean by misconduct?\nWhat - what has been brought forward here, at least, are\nsome disparities in - in various governmental reports,\nwhich suggest that at least there was negligence or\nsloppiness in some of the reports. Is that enough to\nestablish what you mean by governmental misconduct? Or\ndoes it have to be some willful cover-up?\nMS. MILLETT: Justice Scalia, first of all, I\ndon't think there's any evidence of negligence or\nsloppiness here, but if we adopt that -\nQUESTION: All right, well, we - we'll get to\nthat, I assume, right? Okay.\nMS. MILLETT: If we adopt that characterization,\nthe fact that someone cannot - can identify something more\nthat they should have been done, or the fact that - that\nthey disagree with the ultimate result, is not\ngovernmental misconduct. The type of thing that might\nrise - that - that might count, is something that was - if\nyou had evidence that, you know, governmental\ninvestigators had suborned perjury, and you had evidence\nin the form of -\nQUESTION: Willful? Has to be willful?\nMS. MILLETT: I'm sorry?\nQUESTION: Has to be willful? It cannot be just\na sloppy job? Why - why isn't that of interest to the\npublic?\nMS. MILLETT: I don't - I - I don't think - well,\nif - if they've got evidence of a sloppy job, then FOIA\nhas already worked. They can - the purpose of FOIA is not\n- it's not a 60(b) motion to reopen an investigation or to\nmake us investigate more. It's to see - learn what the\nGovernment did and then critique it as much as you like.\nQUESTION: Okay. Why - why then do you take the\n- I'm sorry - why - why do you take the position that to\nsatisfy the - the - the condition of revealing the\noperation of the Government, it's necessarily got to\nreveal something to the discredit of the Government? What\nif someone came along and said, I think this was a superb\ninvestigation, and the Government is far too modest about\nwhat it has done, and I - I want the country to know?\nWould - would that support a claim?\nMS. MILLETT: Well, Justice Souter, let me be\nvery clear. We're talking here about the allegations of\nmisconduct because that is the public interest that is\nasserted. One might be able to -\nQUESTION: Right, but if misconduct - my - the\nreason I'm raising the question is, if misconduct does not\nhave to be shown, I suppose that would have a bearing on\nthe degree of misconduct in a case like this that would -\nthat would suffice.\nMS. MILLETT: Well, a public interest has to be\nidentified at some point, and the problem with this case\nis, or the problem -\nQUESTION: No, but what about my question for a\nminute?\nMS. MILLETT: Right.\nQUESTION: Why is - why is it an illegitimate\npublic interest for somebody to come along and say, I want\nto make the Government look good. They are hiding their\nlight under a bushel. I - I want the people to know how -\nhow fine they've done. Why is that not a - a possible\nlegitimate objective under the statute?\nMS. MILLETT: Well, I think that - that - that is\nsort of nothing more than - than a desire to show what the\nGovernment did in this investigation, transparency in\ngovernment interest, which is the point of FOIA. But once\nyou've come to an - applying an exemption, you're going to\nneed something more on your side than just serving the\ngeneral interests that FOIA itself advances, because\notherwise, the exemption doesn't work as an exemption.\nYou have to want - want something more than transparency\nin government.\nNow, it may not be that you have to show\nmisconduct. You might be able to do it because there's\nsome other sort of acute public interest that's going to\noutweigh it, but I think in the end, the public interest\nin making the Government look good or telling the\nGovernment - tell the public more about what the\nGovernment did is never going to be enough to outweigh the\nprivacy interests of individuals. You can do that with\nthe substantial amounts of disclosures that have already\nbeen made.\nI would like to reserve the balance of my time\nfor rebuttal.\nQUESTION: Very well, Ms. Millett.\nWe'll hear from you, Mr. Hamilton.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES HAMILTON\nFOR RESPONDENTS ANTHONY AND MOODY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. HAMILTON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThere are five basic reasons why the privacy\ninterest at issue in this case should be protected.\nFirst, the Foster family seeks to protect their own,\nwholly legitimate privacy interests.\ninterests here of the family are to be free from seeing\nthese photographs on television and in grocery store\ntabloids, to be free from the knowledge that these\nphotographs are displayed in virtual perpetuity on\nghoulish Web sites that show death and carnage, to be free\nfrom the harassment by the media that inevitably will\nfollow if these photographs are released.\nSecond, while FOIA privacy protection is\nbroader, there is significant common law authority that a\nsurvivor's right of privacy is violated by showing\nphotographs of deceased loved ones. The Restatement of\nTorts recognizes this, so does Reid v. Pierce County, a\n1998 decision by the Supreme Court of Washington, en banc,\nwhich allowed a cause of action for displaying the autopsy\nphotographs of former Governor, Washington Governor, Dixie\nLee Ray, at cocktail parties.\nThird, every FOIA case that has examined the\nissue has found that in appropriate circumstances,\nsurvivors have a proper - a privacy interest. The Ninth\nCircuit and the D.C. Circuit did so in the cases involving\nthese photographs. There is a 1987 opinion in the D.C.\nCircuit of Badhwar v. Air Force that does so regarding\nautopsy reports, and Justice Ginsburg joined in that\nopinion.\nQUESTION: Mr. Hamilton, assume we agree with you\non all of that. We haven't heard anything about the other\n- the other half of the inquiry, and that is what the\npublic interest is in - that might overcome that - that -\nthat privacy interest. I'm sure the other side is going\nto - is going to talk about that, the - the alleged\ndiscrepancies in the reports and whatnot. Can - can you\nshed some light on that?\nMR. HAMILTON: Well, Justice Scalia, we think\nthat there is no public interest on the other side. We\nthink as - as counsel for the Solicitor General has said,\nthat there's a strong evidence test for showing that there\nis government - government misconduct where that is the\nallegation of the public interest, which is the situation\nhere. A - a number of courts have said that the test\nshould be compelling evidence. The D.C. Circuit has done\nthat in several cases. The Fourth Circuit has done it.\nOther circuits have come to other standards in - in terms\nof what the public interest should be, but it must be\nsomething that is strong, that is not insubstantial.\nSecondly, in determining what the public\ninterest is, the Court must be aware that there have been\nfive investigations, five investigations of Mr. Foster's\ndeath, and all of them have found that he died by suicide.\nThese investigations have released over 3,000 documents\nover -\nQUESTION: Yes, but it seems to me that the -\narguably, the interest in disclosure might not challenge\nthe ultimate conclusion, but rather they might contend -\nwant to show that one of the team of investigators was\ntotally incompetent, and it was necessary to have three or\nfour other investigations to reach the correct result. I\ndon't think the ultimate conclusion necessarily answers\nthe - the claim that there may be some public interest in\nhow the investigation was conducted.\nMR. HAMILTON: Well, Justice Stevens, the - 7(C)\nrequires a balancing, and when you have this balance, you\nhave to weigh whatever the public interest is against the\nprivacy interest. And here, where there have been five\ninvestigations, where the reports are voluminous, where\nthe documents released and the photographs already\nreleased are voluminous, it is very difficult to see what\nthe public interest is in getting these photographs, which\nwould grossly invade the privacy of the family. The other\npoint on the public -\nQUESTION: Well, let - let's take a particular\nitem of evidence, I mean, like the - the autopsy report\nthat Mr. Favish claims was - was - was altered, that the\nword neck was white - whitened out and head was written in\ninstead to - to cover the fact that the bullet exited the\nneck rather than the head.\nand other conspiracy theorists would say is, the fact that\nfive investigations came up with the same conclusion just\nshows the extent of this - this conspiracy, you know.\nThey're not going to be satisfied by the mere fact that -\nthat you had five separate groups. They're going to say,\noh, all the worse, all the worse, this - this conspiracy\nis so widespread. Well, how do you respond to that?\nMR. HAMILTON: Well, I think the first response I\nwould make is that it is a difficult argument to make that\nJudge Starr conspired with members of the Clinton\nadministration to protect that administration.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HAMILTON: Judge Starr - Judge Starr's report\nwas quite thorough, it was over 110 pages. He answered\nthis question about the - the - the medical report. The\nmedical report was somewhat inconsistent, but certainly,\nwhen you look at the autopsy reports, when you look at the\n- the - the photographs themselves, it is clear that the -\nthere - there was a - an exit wound in the back of the\nhead. There was no -\nQUESTION: He might have been protecting Newt\nGingrich. Did you ever think of that?\nMR. HAMILTON: I - I beg your pardon?\nQUESTION: Mr. Starr might have been protecting\nNewt Gingrich.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: May - may I ask -\nMR. HAMILTON: Justice -\nQUESTION: - the - I wanted to ask this question\nof the Government, didn't have the opportunity. The\nGovernment says there were three errors made by the Ninth\nCircuit. I assume the district court, under the\nGovernment's test, does have substantial discretion even\nif we - if we adopt the test the Government wants us to\nadopt. And my question is whether or not, rather than\nsimply reverse and remand - and reverse, we have to remand\nfor the district court to do this under the proper test?\nMR. HAMILTON: Well, I would hope - I would hope,\ngiven the full record here, that this Court would not\nremand, that this Court would decide this issue. It has\nbeen, Justice Kennedy, 10 years since -\nQUESTION: I - I understand, but as a - as a\nlegal matter, if the Ninth Circuit didn't apply the proper\ntest and if the district judge has to exercise discretion\nin the first entrance - instance - whether or not we have\nto remand even if we adopt the Government's argument?\nMR. HAMILTON: I - I believe that on the record\nbefore the Court, the Court can decide that there is no\nvalid public interest here, and that the interest of - the\nprivacy interest of the Foster family greatly outweighs -\nQUESTION: So you want us to do that weighing?\nMR. HAMILTON: I - I certainly do. I want this\ncase to end at this Court, Justice Kennedy. It has been\n10 years and it is time to give this family some peace.\nQUESTION: That was the initial position of the\ndistrict court, wasn't it? In the - in the first round,\ndidn't the district court uphold the exemption?\nMR. HAMILTON: The - yes, Justice Ginsburg.\nQUESTION: So the district judge - what - I don't\nrecall what standard the district court applied in the\nfirst instance, but it was the Ninth Circuit that - that\nsaid, district court, you have to look at these and\ndisclose the ones that aren't, whatever that series of\nadjectives is.\nQUESTION: Yes. That - that's my concern. Is\nthere evidence that the district court used the standard\nthat the Government now argues for in the first - when he\n- when the - Judge Keller first looked at this case, did\nhe adopt basically what the Government is asking us to\nadopt?\nMR. HAMILTON: Not - not exactly. No, he did not\nadopt a - a clear evidence test, but the district court in\nthe first instance, in his first decision, did weigh the\npublic interest against the privacy interest and found\nthat as to all of the photographs, the privacy interest\nprevailed.\nI would like to - I would like to return to the\n- the family's privacy interest and make one more point,\nwhich is that law and tradition treat the moment\nsurrounding death as special, private family matters. A\nfamily generally has the right to decide how to conduct\nits leave-taking and how to dispose of the body of a loved\none with dignity. At a funeral, a family may choose\nwhether a coffin is open or is shut, and they have that\nchoice even if the deceased person was a public official.\nHere, the Foster family decided that the coffin be shut,\nand to effectively open it now by disclosing the\nphotographs would be an unconscionable invasion of the\nfamily's privacy interest.\nIn the Reporters Committee brief, the contention\nwas made that the invasion of sorts here would be minimal\nand would impose no meaningful additional harm. That\nassertion is just simply wrong, and those claims ignore\nthe potent and the moving declarations submitted in this\ncase by Ms. Anthony and Ms. Moody. These declarations\nexpress what any family in the circumstance would feel,\nand they show why law and tradition treat death as a\nprivate, family matter.\nMr. Foster's sister, Ms. Anthony, in her\ndeclaration, recounted her nightmares and heart-pounding\ninsomnia each time she has seen the leaked photograph of -\nQUESTION: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Hamilton.\nMr. Favish, am I pronouncing your name\ncorrectly?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLAN J. FAVISH\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT FAVISH\nMR. FAVISH: Yes, Chief Justice, thank you.\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nI can think of no clearer definition of the\nphrase, personal privacy, as Congress used it in exemption\n7(C) than what this Court said about that phrase in the\nReporters Committee case when it cited the work of former\nSolicitor General Charles Fried and other noted scholars\non what the definition of privacy is: the right to control\ninformation about yourself. That's what I base this case\non. I want you to stick with what you said on that point\nin 1989.\nQUESTION: The issue wasn't before the Court.\nThere were no family members. It was an individual, so it\nwas natural for the Court to address it.\nMR. FAVISH: Justice Ginsburg, the definition of\nprivacy as intended by Congress in exemption 7(C) was\nbefore the Court in Reporters Committee, and this Court -\nQUESTION: But the - the Court didn't have a case\nthat involved, say, for example, what was presented in the\nChallenger case. It didn't come here, but it did go to\nthe district court and the D.C. Circuit.\nMR. FAVISH: I agree -\nQUESTION: Are - are you saying that Reporters\nCommittee showed that that decision was wrong?\nMR. FAVISH: No. I - I agree with you that\nReporters Committee did not involve death-related\ndocuments, if that's what you're saying. I agree on that\npoint. But Reporters Committee gave only one definition\nof privacy as intended by Congress, and that definition\nshould apply to all circumstances in which FOIA requests\nmay come up.\nQUESTION: There's a tradition going back\nthousands of years in human life. You can go back to\nAntigone, Euripides, every major religion, respect for the\ndead, respect for survivors, and that runs through every\nreligion, through Greek myth, tragedy, and why isn't that\nimportant enough to human life to believe that Congress\nalso intended to encompass that?\nMR. FAVISH: I believe it is an important\ninterest, but Congress left no indication that it intended\nfor that interest to be protected by the privacy language\nin exemption 7(C).\nQUESTION: Well, if the history is totally\nsilent, why wouldn't we assume that Congress intended to\nrecognize something so deep in human nature?\nMR. FAVISH: Well, the - the legislative history\nisn't totally silent.\nQUESTION: No, I mean if they said, no, no, we do\nnot intend to respect this sacred tradition, fine. But I\nbet they didn't say that, and for good reason.\nMR. FAVISH: They did not say that, but they did\ntalk about personally identifying details and government\nagencies where person -\nQUESTION: Are you reading from the legislative\nhistory?\nMR. FAVISH: From the legislative history, which\nis at page -\nQUESTION: Why don't you use the text of the\nstatute?\nMR. FAVISH: Yes.\nQUESTION: I would - I would think that your\nresponse to - to Justice Breyer would be that the - that\nthe word privacy is not a - the normal way of - of\nexpressing those concerns for respect for the dead.\nMR. FAVISH: I agree, I agree, and that's why I\ncited what this Court did in Reporters Committee, and\nthose concerns are valid and those concerns should be made\nto Congress in an attempt to get them to add another\nexemption to the FOIA, if that's what the Government and\nthe Foster respondents want. We know that -\nQUESTION: You've heard - you've heard Mr.\nHamilton mention aspects of how the revelation of\ndocuments, pictures of the dead, can injure a survivor.\nWhy isn't the word privacy broad enough at least to cover\nthat?\nMR. FAVISH: That's not the way this Court\ndefined it in Reporters Committee. That's not the way\nI've seen it defined anywhere else except a few\naberrational cases, which by the way -\nQUESTION: Well, one - one of the - one of the\ndefinitions that I think we instinctively assume is the\nvery simple one that Justice Brandeis used, the right to\nbe let alone. That is at the - at the heart of a lot of\nprivacy thinking in our law, and the right to be let\nalone, I suppose, would encompass at least two things\nrelevant in this case. One is the right not to be\nassaulted by these photographs, which will be very\nupsetting. That is - that's certainly not being left\nalone when - when you have to go through that.\nAnd the second consequence, I would suppose, of\npublication is simply even in the narrowest definition of\nprivacy, even apart from the Brandesian sense. If these\nthings are going to be published, the family is going to\nbe subject to intrusive inquiries again.\nto ask them for comments on it. They're going to go to\ntheir house again and take a picture of the front of the\nhouse. Why aren't these interests, which at this time in\nour history I think do tend to fall with - within the\nconcept of privacy, easily encompassed by the - the sense\nof privacy in the exemption?\nMR. FAVISH: The right to be let alone was not\nthe sole expression of the definition of privacy in that\narticle. In fact, in Reporters Committee -\nQUESTION: Well, nothing it - I - I'm not\nsuggesting - your - I mean, your argument is based upon\nthe fact that there has to be one narrow definition of\nprivacy encompassed by this word, and no other. You've\ngone back to a case in which we were talking about the\ninterests of the living, and you say it can't be anything\nmore than that. Why do you make the assumption that\nprivacy is such a circumscribed concept in the exemption?\nMR. FAVISH: Well, the word privacy, if it's\ngoing to be meaning the right to be let alone in its\nbroadest sense, I suppose anything that could be\nconsidered a tort then would be considered a violation of\nsomebody's privacy right.\nQUESTION: Mr. Favish, do - do we have any case\nlaw that suggests that the exemptions to the Freedom of\nInformation Act are to be narrowly construed?\nMR. FAVISH: Well, sure, this Court's decision in\nRose, Department of Air Force, there are many cases -\nQUESTION: Isn't that your - isn't that your\nresponse to why you should not think that privacy means\nthe right to be let alone?\nMR. FAVISH: Exactly.\nQUESTION: Or anything beyond its narrowest\nmeaning?\nMR. FAVISH: I - I -\nQUESTION: I assume that that's your argument?\nMR. FAVISH: Yes, absolutely. That's established\nthat these are to be narrowly construed, and that was a\npart of the legislative intent of Congress to have the\nexemptions clearly delineated, specific, so that there\nwould be clear standards. In fact, that was the - the\nreason for the Freedom of Information Act being enacted in\n1966, because the prior enactment was allowing the\nGovernment to take ambiguous language and cover every\ndocument with it.\nSo if you are going to come up with another\ndefinition of privacy, it has to fit within that\nlegislative intent.\nQUESTION: Are you saying that this Court,\nbecause of the definition in Reporters Committee, has\nalready recognized that it's got to be the individual that\nis in the photograph and families are out of it? That it\n- that - that's - so you would - you would say the D.C.\nCircuit was wrong, the district court in the Challenger\ncase, which involved the voices of the people?\nMR. FAVISH: Okay. Two - two parts to your\nquestion. First, as to your first part, based on what\nthis Court did in Reporters Committee, I'd say privacy in\nthis context is the right to control information about\nyourself. If the survivors have no information in that\nphotograph or document, they have no privacy interest\nhere. With regard to the Challenger case, the D.C.\nCircuit in Challenger did not reach this issue. The sole\nissue they decided was whether or not the threshold had\nbeen met in this exemption (C) case, which was whether the\nfile was a personnel, medical, or similar file.\nQUESTION: Yeah, but it went back to the district\ncourt.\nMR. FAVISH: The district court made the decision\nthat there was a privacy interest, but it wasn't the D.C.\nCircuit that made that decision, and the D.C. -\nQUESTION: But in - in any event, you would say\nthat district court decision was off-limits because this\nwas a case of survivor grief, no information about the\nsurvivors?\nMR. FAVISH: Yes, I would.\nto two cases, one of which has already been cited to you\nin the brief by the Silha Center, one of the amicus, and\nthat's Cordell v. Detective Publications. It's a Sixth\nCircuit opinion from 1969. And also, a case that hasn't\nbeen cited to you yet is a Federal district court case\ncalled Young v. That Was The Week That Was, and that's at\n312 F. Supp. 1337. The beauty of these two Federal cases,\nthey're both from 1969, which is just three years after\nCongress first enacted FOIA, just a few years before they\nput the privacy phrase in exemption 7(C). They talk about\nthe common law definition of privacy and -\nQUESTION: Well, if - if they were decided in\n1969, why are they not in your brief?\nMR. FAVISH: Well, I didn't - I filled up my 50\npages and I didn't address this specific issue, other than\nciting Reporters Committee.\nQUESTION: Well, on - on - on Reporters\nCommittee, maybe you'll disagree, but what I think is - is\n- is the key language is in roman IV, where the Court\nsays, to begin with, both the common law and the literal\nunderstandings of privacy encompass the individual's\ncontrol of information concerning his or her person. It\ndoesn't say consists of or is defined, it says encompass.\nThe Court couldn't have been more careful to use a word to\nsay that this is - that it includes.\nexclusively confined to.\nMR. FAVISH: I - I -\nQUESTION: I - I just think that's a very unfair\nreading of that sentence. Now, if you have something\nelse.\nMR. FAVISH: No, well, then I look at - well,\nfirst of all, I generally agree with what you just said.\nQUESTION: I - you - you agree that that is -\nthat's the key sentence that we're talking about.\nMR. FAVISH: Yes, and - but I don't - I disagree\nthat it's unfair, because then I look at what was cited by\nthe Court, and all these scholarly articles talk about the\nright to control information about yourself. And I see\nnothing else in the word privacy from the common law,\nother than a minority of aberrational cases, and certainly\nnothing in the legislative history that would come up with\nthis relational tort, this survivor privacy -\nQUESTION: Well, but that's what we were involved\nwith. It - it's not our style to say, now we have before\nus the question of whether there is this - privacy\nincludes control of the individual's information about\nhimself. Now, of course, there are many other\ndefinitions, but we - we don't write opinions that way.\nMR. FAVISH: Right. I agree, but if you look at\nthe scholarly articles that you cited, none of them\nendorse this survivor privacy theory. They talk about\nprivacy as the right to control information about yourself\nexclusively.\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. Favish, now, the court below\ndidn't really rest on that ground, did it? I mean, you -\nyou didn't - the court below didn't think that privacy\nwas limited to this - to the deceased?\nMR. FAVISH: Neither the district court nor the\nNinth Circuit -\nQUESTION: No.\nMR. FAVISH: - accepted that.\nQUESTION: And so I assume you may want to\naddress the other arguments in the case.\nMR. FAVISH: Certainly. If you do -\nQUESTION: Do you defend the approach taken\notherwise by the courts below?\nMR. FAVISH: No, I don't. And if you do get to a\nsecond step where you are going to be balancing whatever\nprivacy interest you might find here against the public's\ninterest, then you have an overwhelming - an overwhelming\ncase that's been established showing that there was\ngovernment misconduct here, at least negligence. And I\ntalk about the government conduct on two separate levels.\nOne, there was government conduct in investigating Mr.\nFoster's death, finding out what happened to him. Second,\nthere was government conduct in reporting about that death\nand the investigation to the public. The primary\nreporting agencies here were the Fiske and Starr OICs.\nNow, with regard to the first area of government\nconduct, the investigation as to finding out what\nhappened, it's just educated guesses that the public can\nmake about whether there was any negligence here. But\nwith regard to the second area of whether or not the\nreporting conduct by the Government was at least\nnegligent, we know to a 100 percent certainty that there\nwas at least negligence, because we know that - let me\ntalk about what Justice Scalia talked about, the autopsy\nreport.\nTo be more correct, Your Honor, it was a - a\nreport by the only doctor to view Mr. Foster's body at the\npark. It was not the autopsy report. It was a two-page\ndocument. Page 2 talked about the death-shot being mouth\nto neck. Mr. Hamilton stated that Mr. Starr dealt with\nthat in his report. That's not true. Mr. Starr ignored\npage 2 of the Haut report. That's one of the problems\nhere. We talk about these different investigations.\nWell, nobody investigated that language on the Haut\nreport. Nobody investigated the FBI -\nQUESTION: Explain how the - the four documents\nthat we're concerned with don't talk about - none of them\nshow head and neck, so I don't - we - we hear only about\nthose four documents, right? Because the district court\nand the Ninth Circuit said, right, not all ten but only\nthose four? And none of those four have anything to do\nwith head and neck.\nMR. FAVISH: I - I - I'm - I'm not sure I follow\nyour question. I - I understand that all 10 photos are at\nplay here because -\nQUESTION: Well, that - that's what I'd like\nclarified, because I thought that we are reviewing a\ndecision that the Government has asked us to review, which\nsaid, Government, disclose four photographs.\nMR. FAVISH: My understanding is that the\npetition that was granted by the Government had, as its\nquestion presented, was the Office of Independent Counsel\ncorrect in withholding all of these photographs? And\nunder the -\nQUESTION: But the court below said yes with\nrespect to six of them. So how do we get to review that?\nMR. FAVISH: Yeah, the -\nQUESTION: Didn't you cross-petition on the six?\nI thought you cross-petitioned.\nMR. FAVISH: Yes, I did, and that's being held\nover.\nQUESTION: That's the answer.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. FAVISH: So I believe all 10 photos are at\nplay here in what decision you come up with, because the -\nall the issues presented by all three petitioners are\nsubsumed under the question presented in the petition that\nyou granted.\nQUESTION: I'm worried about - suppose you won. I\ntake it the police investigate hundreds of thousands or\nmillions or crimes every year, and in those investigations\nthey may investigate people whom they later conclude are\ninnocent, perhaps again hundreds of thousands of millions\nof them. And, of course, there might, in respect to those\npeople, be lots of newspapers or others who would like to\nhave the police records about people found to be innocent.\nNow, what would protect these thousands or\nhundreds of thousands of innocent people from having the\npolice investigation of them displayed on the front page\nof their local paper if you were to win this case?\nMR. FAVISH: Well, if I was one of those people\nthat you're talking about and -\nQUESTION: Yes, well -\nMR. FAVISH: - and there's information about me\nin the document, I have a privacy interest in the\ndocument, is what my position is.\nQUESTION: Well, if you - but suppose you won\nthis, if you won it, then you and everybody else, let's\nsay millions of people, you don't mind perhaps, or not\nenough, you don't mind enough, but a lot of people would\nmind having a police report about them on the front page\nof the local paper.\nMR. FAVISH: Well, then, in that case -\nQUESTION: Now, what is it that - if you win, I\ndon't see that those people would have any protection\nwhatsoever.\nMR. FAVISH: The protection would be in the\nbalancing that's done to see -\nQUESTION: The balancing would be that the police\nhad found them innocent, and it's not that hard if you win\nthis, where there have been five investigations, for\nsomebody to say, oh, there was a police cover-up, they\nweren't really innocent.\nMR. FAVISH: I -\nQUESTION: And if there are two investigations,\nthey'll still say it, and there'll always be something\nthat isn't perfect about the investigation, so they'll\nhave a peg to hang their hat on.\nMR. FAVISH: Under the balancing, all the factors\nmust be taken into account. We have an almost unique\nsituation here of a deputy White House counsel, public\nofficial, very close to the President of the United\nStates, who was under investigation at the time, there\nwere documents related to that investigation in Mr.\nFoster's office, that is why Kenneth Starr and Robert\nFiske investigated this. We're talking about the highest\nlevels of government where there's a mysterious death by\ngunshot. This is not one of the cases that you pose a\nhypothetical about. This is something unique and -\nQUESTION: But I don't see how you can confine it\nto uniqueness. Why doesn't everyone in every hometown in\nAmerica have a - a very significant interest in whether\ntheir police department is adequately investigating and\nevaluating reports of homicide. Of course they have an -\nan interest in that.\nMR. FAVISH: I -\nQUESTION: Every - everyone in - in - in any\nFederal district has an interest in whether the United\nStates Attorney and the FBI and so on are investigating\nserious crimes, and I - I don't see how you can confine\nthis to what you call the unique case.\nMR. FAVISH: I - I'm not saying it would be\nconfined. I'm saying that this is what sets those other -\nthis case apart from the others. But in principle,\nunless it falls within one of the exemptions, then that\ninformation would have to be made public -\nQUESTION: So -\nMR. FAVISH: - under the FOIA as it currently\nexists.\nQUESTION: But here's the - I think one of the -\nthe - one of the things that's bothering Justice Breyer,\nand it's bothering me, if we accept as broad a principle\nas you argue for, is this: that one of the things that -\nthat most police investigators learn very early on is that\nwhen they investigate a crime and they investigate a\nsuspect, the suspect's old friends and enemies come\nforward, and the latter frequently even up some old\nscores.\nThe amount of misinformation that is\nintentionally communicated to law enforcement officers is\nenormous. They have to evaluate that, and it seems to me\nthat that kind of misinformation is - is - is going to\ncome very close to the front page in most cases if - if a\nprinciple as broad as yours is accepted.\nMR. FAVISH: Well, first of all, I believe in the\nFOIA, in exemption 7, there is an exemption for ongoing\ninvestigations, so much of what you're talking about -\nQUESTION: Well, yeah, but the - the problem for\nthe person being investigated who is ultimately exonerated\nis going to be the same the day after the investigation is\n- is over. So that - that doesn't answer the problem.\nMR. FAVISH: Yeah.\nthe privacy exemption in 7(C). Now, I don't know in your\nhypothetical whether there would be other exemptions to\nprevent disclosure in those situations. I'm not\ncommenting on that. Now, with regard - yes.\nQUESTION: Neither - neither do I, in fact.\nQUESTION: Mr. Favish, here's - here's my - I\nmean, one - once you get past the first - the first issue,\nwhether the privacy exemption at all covers this, if you\nassume it does cover it, you have relatives here who are\ngoing to be very much - very much harmed by - by this, as\nis shown by the mere fact that they've conducted this\nlengthy litigation. It's lasted how long, and I'm sure\nit's been expensive.\nNow, what is the interest on the other side? If\n- if you - if you had a plausible case that - that these\ninvestigations reached the wrong conclusion, I'd say,\nyeah, that's a pretty significant governmental interest.\nBut I don't see that here. I - you - you - you've just\ndemonstrated some foot faults in - in each of the\ninvestigations. Oh, this - this investigation made this\nmistake, this other investigation made the other mistake.\nWho cares? I mean, you really think that that is a matter\nof - of significant moment for - for the country, that\nthere was an isolated mistake in - in one and another of\nthe investigations? Who cares?\nMR. FAVISH: Justice Scalia, I would not\ncharacterize them as foot faults. I think these are major\nomissions of significant evidence that pointed away from\nthe Government's official conclusion, and what it\nestablishes is that the government reports are not\ntrustworthy. I agree that in the end those reports may be\ncorrect and it was suicide in the park.\nAgain, like I said earlier, I can just make\neducated guesses about that. I'm not saying that it was\ndefinitely something other than that, but I am saying that\nwhen you have a high-level government official involved in\nthis kind of investigation, and then you have so many\ninvestigations by the Government, apparently to get it\nright, that it took so many, you have a public interest\nhere, unlike almost any other case I could imagine.\nQUESTION: Well, why should the high level of the\nvictim make that much difference?\nMR. FAVISH: As opposed to just an innocuous\nneighbor down the street, perhaps.\nQUESTION: Well, say a - a public interest in\nsomething that happens in Albuquerque, New Mexico, maybe\nthe assistant to the mayor is shot.\nMR. FAVISH: Because we're dealing with somebody\nwho was working close to the President of the United\nStates and we're talking about the Freedom of Information\nAct, whose primary purpose is to allow the people to be a\ncheck on government, not only to -\nQUESTION: Well, but - but why - why wouldn't\nthat be just as true of this incident, hypothetical\nincident in Albuquerque as the Vince Foster slaying?\nMR. FAVISH: Well, it very well might be with\nregard to city or state government and states have their\nown open records acts, and as we heard before, some of\nthem prohibit death photos, but they do that by\nlegislation. We know that the State of Florida did that\nin response to amicus Teresa Earnhardt's plea. That's\nwhat should be done here if they want the Federal\nGovernment to follow the lead of the state legislatures\nhere.\nIt's not for the courts, with all due respect,\nto rewrite the FOIA exemption, so I - I'm not disagreeing\nthat that's a valid concern, but the way -\nQUESTION: Well, you're - you're - you're getting\naway from the hypothetical. The hypothetical, if you - if\nyou insist on taking this line, could be refined so that\nwe assume New Mexico has exactly the same statute and has\ninterpreted exactly the same way. Then you have to answer\nthe hypothetical.\nMR. FAVISH: Oh, absolutely then. If - if the\nbalancing is done and you're talking about a law like FOIA\nwhere the primary purpose is to allow the people to ensure\nthat their government is honest, because that's the heart\nof our democracy and we're talking about the integrity of\nour law enforcement agencies, I can think of no higher\npublic interest than what's being asserted here. And\nagain, all of this is going to have to be -\nQUESTION: So - so - so then it doesn't just turn\non the fact that it's Vince Foster and that - and the\nChief Justice's point is - is that this was going to apply\nto every police department, every - every local government\nin the country that has an act like this?\nMR. FAVISH: Well, in principle, yes. How the\nbalancing would come out in each individual case would\ndepend on the ad hoc balancing, but the principles would -\nwould be the same if the law is the same, I agree.\nQUESTION: When a person goes to work for the\nGovernment, on top of everything else, he even loses a\nprivate right to bury the body. I mean, I'm speaking\nmetaphorically, but, I mean, there are a lot of\ndisadvantages in government, and you're saying one of the\nthings would be that after death there is no protection,\neven to see that that body is buried and the photographs\ndisappear for the - for the -\nMR. FAVISH: Well -\nQUESTION: It would just go on forever.\nMR. FAVISH: Well, we're not talking about\ninterfering with the - the burial process.\nQUESTION: No, I know. I'm speaking\nmetaphorically. I have Antigone in my mind.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FAVISH: Again, as I read the FOIA exemption\n7(C), the privacy exemption, Congress has not legislated\nthat the Government is allowed to withhold death\nphotographs under this privacy exemption. If we think\nthat's a good public policy to enact, we should get\nCongress to hold hearings on it and we'll find out all the\nyeas and the nays and that's how good legislation comes.\nAnd that's what should be done here and -\nQUESTION: What does privacy cover without that?\nAre you suggesting that there be a catalog A to Z of - and\nthe - and the word privacy within the meaning of 7(c)\ncovers, and that's -\nMR. FAVISH: Oh, in terms of what Congress might\ndo or what this Court might do?\nQUESTION: No, in terms of - the Court has no\nleeway unless Congress has such a catalog and this is one\nof the enumerated items -\nMR. FAVISH: Well, we know that Congress used the\nphrase, personal privacy, in the statute, and now the\ndebate is over what did they mean by that. And\napparently, people are scribing words, Alice-in-\nWonderland-like definitions to words, and if we go down\nthat route -\nQUESTION: But it's not very Alice in Wonderland-\nlike to take the Brandeis definition that started this\nall.\nMR. FAVISH: What I like about the Brandeis\narticle is -\nQUESTION: I think it's Alice in Wonderland-\nlike.\nMR. FAVISH: What I like about the Brandeis\narticle is the section of that article that was cited by\nthis Court in Reporters Committee. The Brandeis article\nwas one of the six scholarly articles. Now, keep in mind,\nthe Brandeis article, 1890, was maybe the earliest trying\nto come up with a definition of privacy, so the language\nisn't as precise as what, for instance, former Solicitor\nGeneral Fried came up with in his seminal 1966 article,\nalso cited by this Court.\nSo I would say that the best definition that\nprovides the clearest workable standard is the right to\ncontrol information about yourself, and again, on the\nsecond point here, I - I won't go down the litany of\nthings that are in the brief talking about how there was\nmisconduct, at least negligence with regard to reporting\nthis case, but once I've established that, which I have, I\nthink that the Government can no longer be trusted to\nfilter the raw evidence to the people in this case, and I\ndon't see how in a democracy that depends on the integrity\nof its law enforcement agencies in a case where you've had\n- well, by the way, there haven't been five\ninvestigations. For instance, the Senate Whitewater\nCommittee stated out the outset of its two-day hearings\nthey're not looking into whether Mr. Foster committed\nsuicide or not. That's in the record. Look at ER 603 and\nthose pages.\nSo we're also looking at a situation with regard\nto the Fiske and Starr offices using FBI agents as part of\ntheir investigation, where the FBI did the initial\ninvestigation with the Park Police. That's all in the\nrecord. There's a conflict of interest there when you\nhave FBI agents participating in an examination of what\nthey already did.\nSo to call this five separate investigations is\nhighly misleading, and I think that the only investigation\nthat will matter in this case is the one that the people\ncan do directly by seeing the raw evidence for itself,\nbecause for whatever reason, and I don't impugn the\nmotives of Judge Starr or anybody else, I have no personal\nknowledge that he actually wrote the report. He had\nlawyers in his office. I don't know what the mechanics\nwas. I want to make that very, very clear.\nI just want it to be known that we know\nobjectively, and it's undisputed, there were major pieces\nof evidence omitted from the Fiske and Starr reports that\npoint to something other than the official conclusion, not\njust little details, because those things, I agree, can be\nexplained sometimes. We're talking about major, major\nissues, and those are spelled out in the brief in detail\nfor you.\nQUESTION: Mr. Favish, are there any other\nFederal statutes that use the term privacy?\nMR. FAVISH: There is the Privacy Act enacted in\n1974, and there is a definition which talks about\npersonally identifying details, and I don't have that at\nhand right now, but it's consistent -\nQUESTION: You don't think that covers relatives\nwho are deceased?\nMR. FAVISH: I don't think it enacts a definition\nthat gives somebody a privacy interest in a document -\nQUESTION: I don't either.\nMR. FAVISH: - which has no information about\nthem, and I think that's indicative also. And my one last\npoint has to do with what the Ninth Circuit did here in\naddition to the reasons I've already explained. They\nbasically said that it isn't the release of the photos\nthat will cause the harm, it's what's going to be done\nlater, media intrusion and so forth, which I think\nviolates what Justice Scalia said in his concurrence in\nthe Ray case about the derivative uses.\nNow, Ray was an exemption 6 case, but it focused\non the word that's common to both exemptions, constitute,\nwould the release or production constitute the invasion of\nprivacy? What the Ninth Circuit came up with really\nviolates what Justice Scalia said in his concurrence in\nRay, with which I - I agree wholeheartedly.\nQUESTION: Do you think the Ninth Circuit is\nbound to agree with Justice Scalia's concurrence?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FAVISH: I - I -\nQUESTION: You just think they would be well\nadvised to do so.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FAVISH: I think they would be well advised\nto have at least noted what Justice Scalia said and\ncompare it to what they were doing, and if they had done\nthat, they would see that what they did was wrong on that\nscore. And that's really all I have. I thank you.\nQUESTION: Thank - thank you, Mr. Favish.\nMs. Millett, you have four minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. MILLETT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nJustice Breyer, you hit the nail on the head when you said\nthat if this type of investigation isn't enough, what's\ngoing to happen in the routine case? This is the gold\nstandard for law enforcement investigations, and if in\nthis case, the fact that someone can think of something\nmore that should have been said, something more should\nhave been done, something more should have been revealed,\nthen in the run-of-the-mill routine law enforcement case,\nthere will be little protection left for privacy.\nAnd the problem won't be just that this\ninformation will end up on the front page of the New York\nTimes, but under the 1996 amendments to the FOIA, if - if\nthe Government anticipates three or more requests for\ninformation, we're obliged to post the information on our\nWeb sites for photographs taken after 1996 - November\n1996. You won't need to go to findadeath.com. You can go\nto DepartmentofDefense.gov to find pictures of - the 50\npictures that are routinely taken during autopsies of\nmilitary office - officials killed overseas.\nJustice Kennedy, you had asked about the remand,\nwhether a remand was necessary. It is not in this case.\nOn pages 56A through 59A of the petition appendix, the\ndistrict court, before being redirected by the court of\nappeals, we think erroneously, ruled that the - the\npictures should be withheld applying a less demanding\nstandard than the one that we approached, that it just\nbalanced the allegations of misconduct against the privacy\ninterest, and concluded that the privacy interest still\noutweighed, assuming that - that just allegations count\nfor something on the public interest side.\nSo if this Court agrees with the Government's\nposition or requires anything more than allegations of\nmisconduct, there'll be no need to remand. It's also not\na discretionary decision, it's a de novo review. The\nbalancing is undertaken in the first instance, but it's\nreviewed de novo by the court of appeals and de novo by\nthis Court.\nJustice Scalia, you talked about this doesn't\nsound like privacy. Well, privacy is a language that has\nbeen used by not all, but a number of common law courts\nthat are cited in our opening and reply brief. And this\nCourt's interpretation of the concept of privacy under the\nFreedom of Information Act has gone far beyond what tort\nlaw would protect. There - I don't know that there's any\ncourt case that would suggest that rap sheets should be\npublic records, like rap sheets would be protected under\nprivacy conceptions in common law, so it would be\nextraordinary in this case to decide that the language\nCongress employed, personal privacy, is intended to be\ninterpreted more narrowly than it has, at least at some -\nat some courts at common law.\nJustice Scalia, you also asked about narrowly\nconstruing the exemptions. It's - I agree that there are\ncases that say that, but in John Doe Agency v. a John Doe\nCorporation, this Court made clear that these exemptions\nstill have to be interpreted in a way that allows their\nexempt - the purposes of the exemptions to be served. And\nin a - and they should not be construed in the non-\nfunctional manner. If law enforcement is to become the\ninstrument - in the eyes of the public, the law\nenforcement, the Federal Government, will be the\ninstrument of these types of disclosures and causing this\ntype of pain to families that is likely to have a chilling\neffect on people's willingness to provide information to\nlaw enforcement.\nYou asked about other statutes, and we discussed\nthe Privacy Act statute. The Privacy Act statute doesn't\napply to survivors, but that's because the language is\nspecifically different. The Privacy Act talks about -\ndefines the - the records that are covered in terms of\ninformation about an individual and information that - to\nthat pertains to the individual.\nand it has to be information contained in a system of\nrecords that - where information can be retrieved by an\nindividual identifier. It's a very narrow and specialized\ndefinition. It's exactly the type of definition that\nCongress would have used if it wanted a more narrow\napproach. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms. Millett.\n"
