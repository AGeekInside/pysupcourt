        "content": "(10:09 a.m.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The Court will hear argument\nin Number 01-1437, Branch against Smith, and the cross-\nappeal of Smith against Branch.\nMr. McDuff, you may proceed.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT B. McDUFF\nON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS/CROSS-APPELLEES BRANCH, ET AL.\nMR. McDUFF: Justice Stevens, may it please the\nCourt:\nFor 40 years, ever since the decision in\nBaker versus Carr, State court judges, like Federal\njudges, have played a role in addressing constitutional\nproblems stemming from malapportionment. This was\nreflected in Scott versus Germano in 1965, and again in\nGrowe versus Emison in 1993 when the Court said not only\nthat State judges play a role, but they are preferred to\nFederal judges as agents of reapportionment.\nIn this congressional redistricting case from\nMississippi, the Chancery Court of Hinds County, acting\nwith the blessing of the Mississippi Supreme Court,\nstepped into the breach and adopted a plan when the\nlegislature defaulted. That plan has been enjoined by the\nFederal district court, and the United States Department\nof Justice has said not once, but twice that it was\npostponing the statutory time period for preclearance\nunder section 5 of the Voting Rights Act so that even now,\nnearly 1 year after the plan was adopted and submitted, no\npreclearance decision has been made. A Federal court\norder is in place telling State courts they may not hear\ncongressional redistricting cases.\nQUESTION: Now, did -- did Mississippi appeal\nfrom the injunction?\nMR. McDUFF: They did not, Your Honor, but we\ndid. And we were allowed to intervene in this case to\ndefend the State court judgment, which my clients had a\nright to seek, and which they did secure redistricting the\nState of Mississippi.\nQUESTION: But -- but the issue is whether the\nState was still pursuing the -- the redistricting that was\nthe subject of the application to the Attorney General,\nand whether it was doing so or not depended upon whether\nthe State was appealing from the Federal injunction.\nIf the State accepted the Federal injunction, it no longer\nwas pursuing the -- the reapportionment.\nMR. McDUFF: I don't -- I don't know -- I\nrespectfully disagree, Justice Scalia. This is a State\ncourt order, and the Attorney General of Mississippi has\nno right to refuse it or not, and he certainly has no\nright to undo it.\nQUESTION: Well, and he also has no right to\nignore a Federal injunction --\nMR. McDUFF: That's correct.\nQUESTION: -- unless he -- unless he appeals it.\nHe has every right to appeal it. He represents the State,\nand he chose not to appeal it.\nMR. McDUFF: That's correct, but -- but unlike\nthe situation -- but we -- I guess my first answer is, we\ndid appeal it, and so the injunction is --\nQUESTION: But you're not the State.\nMR. McDUFF: -- is subject to being overruled.\nQUESTION: The problem with that is that you're\nnot the State.\nMR. McDUFF: That's correct. But unlike a\nsituation where, for example, an injunction is issued\nagainst a criminal law, or regulatory provision that the\nAttorney General, or the State defendants have some\ndiscretionary authority to enforce, and where it makes\nsense that if they do not want to appeal, no one else\nshould be allowed to appeal if they're not -- if they\ndon't care enough about enforcement, this is an order that\nthe Attorney General, and the State defendants are\nrequired to obey, assuming Federal obstacles are\neliminated.\nNow, if the Attorney General doesn't appeal for\nwhatever reason, it makes sense to allow the people who\nsecured the judgment in State court to intervene and\ndefend that. Otherwise --\nQUESTION: Why does it make sense under a\nstatute in which the action of the State is by -- by\ndefinition crucial?\nMR. McDUFF: Because the action of the -- the\naction of the State here is the action of the State\ncourts, and they have issued an injunction. The Attorney\nGeneral cannot undo that.\nQUESTION: But if we're talking about section 5,\nthe language of section 5 is whenever a State shall enact\nor seek to administer any voting qualification, et cetera.\nAnd because the State is not currently seeking to\nadminister anything, enact, I take it means legislation.\nSeek to administer could be the executive, but the\nexecutive, since it's not appealing the injunction, isn't\ncurrently seeking to administer anything.\nMR. McDUFF: I think -- I think the executive is\nseeking to administer it just as much as he was back when\nthe plan was first submitted. If the Federal obstacles\nare removed -- the constitutional injunction, and the\npreclearance obstacle -- the State defendants are going to\nabide by the order of the chancery court, and submit this\nplan --\nQUESTION: But we would -- we would not require\nthe -- the State or the -- the Federal courts to do a\nvain -- or the Attorney -- the Federal Attorney General to\nperform a vain act. What use would it be for him to\napprove the reapportionment when the State Attorney\nGeneral is still subject to a Federal court injunction\nwhich he has not appealed and therefore cannot ignore?\nWhat possible good would it be for the Attorney General\nto -- to approve the -- the apportionment?\nMR. McDUFF: To remove the section 5 obstacle as\nquickly as possible, consistent with the 60-day deadline\nin the statute, so that once the constitutional obstacle\nis removed, the plan can be in force.\nQUESTION: But the constitutional obstacle won't\nbe removed as long as the Attorney General doesn't --\ndoesn't appeal the Federal court injunction.\nMR. McDUFF: Well, that -- that is assuming\nthat -- that my clients don't have standing, and I think\nwe clearly do as parties who secured the State court\njudgment. Otherwise, you would be in a situation where\nthe Attorney General could unilaterally nullify the State\ncourt injunction simply by not defending it. That's one\nreason my clients were allowed in this case, was to defend\nthe State court injunction they secured.\nQUESTION: Mr. McDuff, can I ask you what is the\nstatus of the State court litigation? Is there an appeal\npending there?\nMR. McDUFF: There is an appeal pending filed by\nthe State court intervenors challenging the chancery\ncourt's plan.\nQUESTION: And how do you explain the failure of\nthe Mississippi Supreme Court to rule on that appeal?\nMR. McDUFF: That -- the briefs have been filed.\nNo oral argument is scheduled. I think -- I -- I don't\nknow, but I think the Mississippi Supreme Court is waiting\nto hear from this Court what it should do because it is\nlooking at a Federal court order telling it it has no\nbusiness in congressional redistricting. And the --\nthe --\nQUESTION: Well, excuse me. Is our decision\ngoing to affect that Federal court order?\nMR. McDUFF: I'm sorry?\nQUESTION: Is our decision going to affect that\nFederal court order?\nMR. McDUFF: Well, we -- we are certainly asking\nthis Court to -- to vacate the Federal court order.\nAnd --\nQUESTION: It's a -- that's the problem I have\ntrying to figure this out. Suppose -- suppose we looked\nat the preclearance, and suppose I thought that it hasn't\nbeen precleared and it should have been. And the reason\nit hasn't been precleared is the reason that's been\ndiscussed, that -- that they haven't tried to administer\nit yet and when -- and they -- and the Department has\n60 days from the time that the State tries to administer\nit. I mean, I thought that's what the statute says,\ndoesn't it, that they have --\nMR. McDUFF: It says 60 days after it's\nsubmitted, it's --\nQUESTION: Yes, enacts or seeks to administer.\nMR. McDUFF: That is correct.\nQUESTION: They have to enact, and this doesn't\nsound like an enactment. It sounds like something -- seek\nto administer, and they haven't sought to administer it.\nAll right.\nThen the Department would have to decide whether\nto preclear it. Well, they may well preclear it. Or what\nhappens next? That's where I'm a little confused.\nI mean, it -- the -- the real constitutional\nissue here -- or one of them anyway -- is assuming there\nis the preclearance, then has the Mississippi court acted\nunconstitutionally in assuming authority to issue a plan,\nwhereas previously, the Mississippi court had said you\nlack -- we lack that authority. And all of a sudden, we\nhave an order here which seems to overrule in earlier\ncases, and it doesn't even have an opinion.\nIn other words, can you help clarify what we\nshould say in this case on the assumption that we ended up\nthinking it should be precleared?\nMR. McDUFF: I think -- I think there are two\nthings we want you to say. First is that the Federal\ncourt's constitutional basis for the injunction is wrong,\nand that Mississippi courts, like courts -- like courts\nthroughout the country, do have a right to adjudicate\ncongressional redistricting cases, at least where the\nlegislature defaults.\nAnd then, second, we are asking you to rule that\nas a result of the passage of the 60-day period, the plan\nhas been precleared.\nIf you agree with us on the first issue,\ndisagree on the second, then the -- then the matter will\nbe remanded to the district court and the preclearance\nprocess --\nQUESTION: But Mr. McDuff, the --\nMR. McDUFF: -- will go forward in the Justice\nDepartment.\nQUESTION: Mr. McDuff, on your first point,\nwhich you would like us to decide first, I thought the\ndistrict court expressly made that a contingent ruling.\nDidn't it say if we're wrong on that this plan hasn't been\nprecleared, if we're wrong, then we have this alternate\nconstitutional point. They phrased it that way as if to\nsay, we would like the court to understand that our\nprinciple ruling is that this plan hasn't been precleared.\nMR. McDUFF: That's correct.\nQUESTION: But if we're reversed on that, then\nwe have something else we want the court to know about.\nSo, it seems to me that it was a highly conditional\nruling, the kind of ruling, let's say, that a -- that a\ntrial court would make under rule 50, when it\nconditionally rules on a new trial motion.\nMR. McDUFF: I don't know if it was a\nconditional ruling, Justice Ginsburg. It was an\nalternative ruling, and we are appealing both grounds.\nAnd I think it makes perfect sense to deal with them both\nin one appeal rather than --\nQUESTION: Why? It makes perfect sense to reach\nthe constitutional issue when there's no need to do so?\nI mean, if -- if we agree -- if -- if we disagree with you\non the second point, there's no need for us to -- to rule\non -- on the first point. Is there?\nMR. McDUFF: Well --\nQUESTION: By the same token --\nQUESTION: Whether -- whether or not the -- the\nFederal district court used it as a makeweight, there's\njust no need for us to reach it.\nQUESTION: Well, there are two questions I had.\nFirst of all, was it proper for the district\ncourt to decide a constitutional issue which was totally\nunnecessary to support its judgment?\nMR. McDUFF: The -- I -- I think it was, and\nI do think it is necessary to reach that issue because\notherwise, we're going to go -- if -- however you rule\non the section 5 issue, the case goes back down.\nHopefully the plan is either declared precleared by this\nCourt or later precleared by the Attorney General. The --\nthe district court is simply going to reinstate that\nconstitutional ruling. This case will come back up here\non appeal, and we'll be into the 2004 election cycle.\nQUESTION: All right.\nbut look, there's a case, Wise v. Lipscomb --\nMR. McDUFF: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: -- which you've seen, and in that\ncase, this Court says, in those circumstances -- which are\nthese -- until clearance has been obtained, a court should\nnot address the constitutionality of the new measure. So,\nwe said specifically, don't address it.\nNow, what -- what are we supposed to do about\nthat?\nMR. McDUFF: That -- that's correct, Your Honor,\nbut the cases from which that statement emanates, and the\nonly cases in which this Court has been called upon to\napply that principle are Connor versus Waller, and\nUnited States versus Board of Supervisors of Warren\nCounty, which we discuss at the beginning of our reply\nbrief. But those are cases that are very different\nfrom this one. In those cases, the Federal district\ncourts substituted constitutional analysis for the\npreclearance process and -- and ordered the use of un\nprecleared plans.\nHere the Federal district court enjoined the use\nof a -- an allegedly un-precleared plan and gave an\nalternative ruling the same way courts do -- the -- in the\nsame fashion that courts do all the time. And in these\ncircumstances, I think it makes sense to go ahead and deal\nwith both issues on the appeal so we don't have this case\nbouncing up and down the appellate ladder while, number\none, the Mississippi Supreme Court is trying to figure out\nwhat to do, and number two, we've got a March 1, 2004\ndeadline approaching.\nQUESTION: Is there any chance the\nlegislature -- which is its job, I take it -- will, in\nfact, enact a plan during that period of time?\nMR. McDUFF: I -- there's certainly no\nindication that the legislature will, Your Honor. And --\nand that's why it is important for -- as -- as the Court\nsaid in Growe v. Emison, for State courts to be able to\nstep into the breach, and deal with the problem without\nthe sort of obstacles that the Federal court has imposed\nhere, first on the constitutional grounds, and then\nsecond, on the section 2 grounds because we contend the\nplan has been precleared.\nAnd let me respond to one other thing --\nQUESTION: So I -- I take it --\nMR. McDUFF: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: -- the State court would have to make\nthe same constitutional determination, or the State court\nisn't free from making constitutional determinations.\nMR. McDUFF: That -- that's right. The --\nQUESTION: In fact, just the opposite. It\nhas to.\nMR. McDUFF: That's right. But if this Court\nresolves the issue on the -- in -- in reviewing the\nFederal district court's injunction, then the State court\nwill not be in the position of having to do that.\nAnd the -- the -- I want to go back to the\nquestion of seeks to administer because I think it is\nvery clear that the Mississippi court -- the Mississippi\ncourts adopted a plan to be used in elections as long\nas the section 5 obstacle is used -- is removed, and any\nother Federal constitutional obstacles are removed.\nAnd as -- as the opinion says -- Justice\nO'Connor said in the opinion for the Court in Lopez versus\nMonterey County -- the second Lopez decision -- seeks to\nadminister is simply -- it -- it's not necessarily a term\nof discretion. You can either seek to administer or not,\nbut is a -- it is a -- the seek is a temporal phrase\nshowing that the -- the plan should be submitted prior to\nits administration.\nAnd here, the Attorney General doesn't have any\ndiscretionary authority, and I think it would be contrary\nto section 5 if he were able to undo the chancery court's\norder simply by the fact that he didn't appeal this case\nwhen he knew we were appealing.\nThe -- in fact, there's -- we've referred\nfrequently to the North Carolina preclearance of the plan\nadopted there by a State court regarding legislative\ndistricts. And if you look in the appendix to the NAACP\namicus brief, there is the letter of submission sent by\nthe trial judge in North Carolina to the Justice\nDepartment where he submitted the plan. The Attorney\nGeneral didn't submit it. In fact, the Attorney General\nhad opposed imposition of the State court plan during the\nState court proceedings.\nThat plan was precleared, and it certainly seems\nto me that if the Justice Department can preclear a plan\nsubmitted by a State court judge, it cannot come here in\nthis case, and say that a State court judge -- a State\ncourt plan from a Mississippi judge is -- has been\nwithdrawn, or has been suspended simply by the simple act\nof -- simply by the simple fact that the Attorney General\ndid not take an appeal in this case. That was taken by\nus.\nQUESTION: But that was -- that was never an\nissue in -- in the North Carolina case, was it?\nMR. McDUFF: I'm sorry?\nQUESTION: That was never an issue in the North\nCarolina case.\nMR. McDUFF: Oh, no, there was not an issue, but\nI'm just pointing out that -- I mean -- I mean --\nQUESTION: Maybe -- maybe Justice shouldn't have\ntaken the -- the request.\nMR. McDUFF: The -- the -- oh, I think Justice\nshould -- Justice definitely should consider a submission\nfrom a State court judge. Section -- section 5 says --\nQUESTION: Sure. But you were making the\nargument a moment ago that if, in fact, they took the\nrequest from the State court judge in North Carolina, they\ncan hardly object here.\nMR. McDUFF: That's correct.\nQUESTION: And that's a different kind of\nargument. And -- and since that was not an issue, I --\nI don't know that they are precluded, or would be\nprecluded from changing their mind now.\nMR. McDUFF: Oh, all I'm -- all I'm saying,\nJustice Souter, is I don't think they can come in here and\nsay that the fact that the Attorney General did not appeal\nhere --\nQUESTION: No, that's -- that's not what they're\nsaying.\nMR. McDUFF: -- means that the submission was\nwithdrawn or suspended.\nQUESTION: They -- what they did not -- what\nthey did not object to is the fact that it was not the\nAttorney General who had to submit the request here.\nThat's all. I mean, in -- in the North Carolina case,\nthey were not violating any provision of the statute which\nrequired, before it could be precleared, that the State be\nabout to administer it. The statute doesn't say that the\nperson, or the -- the entity of the State that is seeking\nto administer it must be the one who applies for\nclearance. That's not what the statute says. So, all\nthat was at issue in North Carolina is whether the -- the\nadministering person has to be the one to seek clearance.\nAnd at most, the case stands for no answer to\nthat question. It certainly doesn't answer the question\nof whether, when the State has no intention of\nadministering it, which is the situation here, and was not\nthe situation in North Carolina, the -- the Attorney\nGeneral, nonetheless, has to reply.\nMR. McDUFF: Justice Scalia, I respectfully\ndisagree with the premise that the State in Mississippi\nhas no intention of administering this plan. Once the\nconstitutional obstacle is removed, if it is, and once\npreclearance is declared, if it is, the State defendants\nare going to administer their plan -- that plan. They are\nunder a State court order to do so. And it seems to me to\nsay that the Mississippi situation is somehow different\nfrom the North Carolina situation is to -- is to exalt the\nform over the substance.\nCertainly in Mississippi the State court judge\ncould have submitted that plan. The State court judge,\nI guess, could have intervened in the case, in the Federal\ncase, and appealed if the Attorney General didn't. But\nthat would be quite unusual, instead --\nQUESTION: Could he have administered the plan?\nThat's --\nMR. McDUFF: I'm sorry?\nQUESTION: That's the crucial question. Yes, he\ncould do all that, but could he have administered the\nplan? If not, his intention to go forward is no\nindication that the State is -- is seeking to administer\nthe plan.\nMR. McDUFF: But -- but, Justice Scalia, the --\nthe failure of the Attorney General to take an appeal is\nno indication that he will not administer the plan once\nthe Federal obstacles are removed. I think we have to\nassume that he will obey the State court order.\nQUESTION: But does it remove the Federal\nobstacle if -- instead of passing on the hypothetical of\nwhether the Federal ground, which is a alternative ground,\net cetera is good or bad -- if we just repeated the\nlanguage from Wise versus Lipscomb, said it's premature to\ndecide this constitutional issue, our cases say not to,\nbut there's an alternative ground here? That would make\nit clear to everybody, wouldn't it, that the ground on\nwhich the Federal injunction rests is the preclearance\nground? And then, would the State say, okay, if it's the\npreclearance ground, we're going to administer it. And\nthen, the 60 days would begin to run, and then you're out\nfrom under this strange stalemate.\nMR. McDUFF: The -- the 60 days, in our view,\nJustice Breyer, has already run.\nQUESTION: I know that, but if I don't agree\nwith you about that, then would it satisfy what you're\nreally after which is to get out of the stalemate? You\nsee, we would just simply point out that this is an\nalternative ground and -- and it has no real -- we're not\nreaching it because it's -- there's this other ground.\nIn other words, I'm repeating what I've said.\nMR. McDUFF: Then I -- I think -- I think --\nQUESTION: I'm trying to get you out of the\nstalemate. I'm trying --\nMR. McDUFF: I -- I think that gets us exactly\nnowhere because the Department has said it is not going to\nresume the preclearance process as long as the\nconstitutional injunction is in place. So unless it's\nvacated, the preclearance process --\nQUESTION: Are there two injunctions? I thought\nthere was just one injunction and --\nMR. McDUFF: I'm sorry. There's one injunction.\nTwo grounds.\nQUESTION: -- two grounds. So if we suggest\nthat one of the grounds was premature, then doesn't that\ndo the trick?\nMR. McDUFF: Well, I think it does -- it does\nget the process ticking again. But the problem is at that\npoint, once it is declared precleared, the Federal\ndistrict court will impose its constitutional injunction,\nwe'll be back up here. The Mississippi Supreme Court will\nstill be facing that injunction.\nQUESTION: Meanwhile, the legislature will act.\nMR. McDUFF: Well, that's -- that's wishful\nthinking. And it --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. McDUFF: If it were true, we wouldn't be\nhere I think.\nQUESTION: Is there any clue, by the way, why in\nall this time --\nMR. McDUFF: I'm sorry?\nQUESTION: Is there any clue why, in all this\ntime, the legislature has not acted?\nMR. McDUFF: No. I think it was the difficulty\nof pairing two incumbents, and they couldn't agree. They\ncouldn't agree on how to do it because we lost a seat in\nMississippi.\nLet me make one --\nQUESTION: They -- they won't have that problem\nnow, will they?\nMR. McDUFF: No, they won't have that problem\nnow.\nQUESTION: So --\nMR. McDUFF: But I still think there's --\nthere's been no indication thus far that any action is\ngoing to be taken in that respect.\nI reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.\nQUESTION: Mr. Feldman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE\nMR. FELDMAN: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nIt's our position that the State court\nredistricting plan was not precleared on either of the two\noccasions that appellants --\nQUESTION: Mr. Feldman, let's assume that we\nagree with everything you say in your brief, and we agree\nit's not been precleared. Isn't the -- will the\ninjunction that's now in place prevent further\npreclearance?\nbefore was there's this injunction standing --\nMR. FELDMAN: It's --\nQUESTION: -- and that's still an obstacle,\nisn't it?\nMR. FELDMAN: If it's clear that this injunction\nis -- rests only on section 5 grounds, and not\nconstitutional grounds, that certainly would --\nQUESTION: The only way to make that clear would\nbe to vacate the --\nMR. FELDMAN: Well --\nQUESTION: -- the other ground. Is that right?\nMR. FELDMAN: The -- what the injunction\nactually says is something like the injunction will last\nuntil, and unless there is a constitutional plan that's\nprecleared. And insofar as it uses the word\nconstitutional, and we know the views of the district\ncourt about that, I think that as long as that -- that\nword, constitutional, is there, that -- that that remains\nan obstacle to administering the plan.\nQUESTION: So unless that injunction is vacated,\nwe're at a stalemate.\nMR. FELDMAN: At least that part -- at least the\ninjunction has to be modified to remove the word\nconstitutional.\nQUESTION:\nI mean, what the district court said about that is -- is\ndictum.\nQUESTION: No, it's part of the injunction\nitself.\nQUESTION: It isn't --\nMR. FELDMAN: It --\nQUESTION: It says until a constitutional plan\nis -- is precleared, but what is a constitutional plan was\nnot before the court. Now you may well know how the\ndistrict court is going -- going to rule on it, but you\ndon't know that the district court will be affirmed in\nthat ruling, or -- I don't -- I don't see how the -- the\nconstitutional ruling is embodied in the injunction.\nMR. FELDMAN: If the Court made clear, I think,\nthat -- that the -- that this injunction couldn't rest on\nthe ground that Article I, section 4 of the Constitution\nwas violated by the -- by the State court plan, then I\nthink it would be ripe for a preclearance.\nQUESTION: Wouldn't -- wouldn't it also be\nripe -- wouldn't the time run simply if -- if the State\nmoved to vacate the injunction?\nMR. FELDMAN: Yes. If a State moved to vacate\nthe Federal court injunction?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. FELDMAN: In the --\nQUESTION: Because at that point wouldn't it\nhave signified that it was, indeed, attempting to\nadminister the plan?\nMR. FELDMAN: There -- well, there's really two\ngrounds on which we think the injunction is -- is\nrelevant. There's a narrower ground, which I think it --\nprimarily the -- the argument so far has been concerned\nwith, which is that the State was no longer seeking to\nenforce the plan because it didn't appeal it. And that --\nQUESTION: If it now seeks to vacate --\nMR. FELDMAN: -- if the State took action,\nthey're still not appealing it, but I suppose, after this\nCourt's order, if they went back to the district court,\nand said, in light of this Court's order, we're trying to\nseek to enforce it again, and if they had the ability to\ndo that, then that -- then that would be eliminated.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. FELDMAN: There is a broader ground,\nhowever, because the -- insofar as the injunction is a\ninjunction that's based -- rests on constitutional\ngrounds, it's the Department's position that -- that the\npreclearance -- the section 5 uses the terms seek to --\nseek to administer. It says it may be enforced once the\nAttorney General acts, and it talks about voting changes\nthat are in force and effect.\npoint to a contemplation by the statute of a change going\nto the Attorney General when it's ready to be -- ready --\nready to go into effect, when there's no present legal\nobstacle. As long as there's a present legal obstacle\nother than a section 5 injunction to its current\nadministration, then the Attorney General -- it's too\nearly -- it's too early to go to the Attorney General.\nQUESTION: Okay. Then that goes back, I guess,\nto the earlier suggestion. If -- if this Court indicated\nthat, in fact, the alternative ground was prematurely\nraised, wouldn't that respond to the -- to the second --\nMR. FELDMAN: I think -- as I said, I think it's\nclear that if the -- if the Court made clear that this --\nthis injunction rests on section 5 and doesn't rest on the\nproposition that it violates Article I, section 4 for\nthe -- for the plan to go into effect, then it would be\nripe for a preclearance at that point.\nQUESTION: Of course, we have a doctrine that we\ndon't decide constitutional issues unless we have to. Do\nyou think that doctrine should have applied to the\ndistrict court in this case because the section 5 ground,\nas I read the opinion, was -- was self -- was sufficient\nto sustain the objections?\nMR. FELDMAN: I think -- I do think the section\n5 ground was sufficient to sustain it.\nQUESTION: And therefore it was really wrong for\nthe district court to reach out and unnecessarily decide a\nconstitutional question.\nMR. FELDMAN: I -- you certainly -- the -- the\nonly reason I would hesitate for that, before I'd quite go\nthat far, is district court was faced -- if you put\nyourself in the situation that the court was, with very\ntight deadlines -- and there are -- even -- although\ncourts should avoid deciding constitutional questions when\npossible, there may be some extreme circumstances where --\nQUESTION: But those deadlines -- you've\ndemonstrated in your brief that the -- the clearance\nhadn't occurred. I mean, if -- if we agree with your\nposition on the preclearance, the deadlines were not a\nreal obstacle.\nMR. FELDMAN: I -- I agree. And actually I --\nI do think the district court certainly could have said\nand -- and perhaps should have said, this is a\nconstitutional issue. Especially, it's a novel\nconstitutional issue that raises novel questions that\nhaven't been addressed before, and the section 5 ground\nwas sufficient to sustain the injunction.\nQUESTION: But the district court -- didn't --\nisn't that what the district court said when it said this\nis our alternative holding in the event that on appeal, it\nis determined that we erred in our February 19 ruling?\nIt seems to me that that's a contingent ruling. If we're\nright about that it hasn't been precleared, then this\ndoesn't come into play.\nMR. FELDMAN: I -- I guess only insofar as when\nyou read the actual order of the court, it says a --\nthis -- this shall go into -- the State may not enforce\nthe State court plan until the State -- there's a\nconstitutional plan that's precleared. And if you read\nthat word --\nQUESTION: But one -- one could agree with the\ncourt, what it was intending to do and give effect to what\nit was intending to do, and if we should hold, if we\nshould agree with the court, that there's no precleared\nplan, then it would be appropriate to vacate the decision\nto the extent that it rests on the constitutional ground.\nMR. FELDMAN: I -- I think that may -- that may\nwell be right. I -- I don't disagree with that.\nI'd like to go to, actually the first -- the\nfirst alleged preclearance which is supposed to have\noccurred 60 days after the plan was initially submitted to\nthe district court, and that preclearance did not occur --\nwas initially submitted to the Attorney General. Excuse\nme. That preclearance did not occur because on\nFebruary 14th, before the 60-day period had expired, the\nAttorney General sent the State a letter saying, I need\nmore information before I can preclear this plan. That\nprocedure, under which the Attorney General did that, was\nspecifically held valid by this Court in Georgia against\nthe United States, and the Court in Georgia specifically\nheld that that stopped the 60-day clock from running.\nLater, in Morris against Gressette, the Court\nheld that the Attorney General's substantive\ndeterminations under section 5 are not subject to -- are\nnot subject to judicial review at all. And therefore, the\nAttorney General's determination that more information is\nneeded, that the information before him was not sufficient\nto permit preclearance -- to permit him to make the\ndeterminations he had to make -- also is not subject to\njudicial review.\nAnd therefore, because that whole process was --\nwas approved by the Court in Georgia against the United\nStates, because more information was sought, that that\nterminated the 60-day clock then, and it did not -- the\nplan was not precleared some days later when -- when the\n60-day period would have expired.\nI think for the reasons I said earlier, it also\nwas not precleared at the later period both because the\nState didn't -- on the narrower ground that the State did\nnot appeal the injunction, and on the broader ground that\nthe injunction was there. And the section 5 process is\ndesigned so that something that's ready to go -- the\nAttorney General should reach his decision on an act\nthat's ready to take effect.\nFinally, I'd like to just briefly go to the\nstatutory question of the interaction of sections 2c\nand 2a(c). With respect to that question, it's our\nposition that the district court, as a remedy here,\ncorrectly ordered the districting of Mississippi's\ncongressional delegation, and did not order that they be\nelected at-large. And that was required by Federal law,\nspecifically by 2 U.S.C., section 2c, which provides that\nthere shall be established by law single-member districts\nin each State, and that Representatives shall be elected\nonly from districts so established. That command, it\nseems to us, is unequivocal, and required the district\ncourt, when it was faced with the problem of what to do\nabout Mississippi, to create single-member districts.\nIt would -- did not have the power --\nQUESTION: But you could -- you could view it,\nI guess, if you had to look at it at all -- and I'm not\nsure we do -- you could say that 2a(c) applies before a\nplan has been redistricted in the manner provided by State\nlaw, and that 2c applies afterwards. I mean, you could\nharmonize them.\nThey've been in -- in existence, these two\nprovisions, for a very long time, and we normally don't\nsee repealed by implication, or hold that there is such a\nthing --\nMR. FELDMAN: I --\nQUESTION: -- that you can harmonize them.\nMR. FELDMAN: I think generally, but I do not\nthink in general these can be harmonized, or at least\nwithin the scope of where it's possible for 2c to -- to\noperate. For -- one reason is that the language,\nRepresentatives shall be elected only from districts so\nestablished, is unequivocal, and, in fact, it shows that\nthe earlier portion of 2c that says, there shall be\nestablished by law congressional districts in each State,\nhas to mean established either by a court, or by a\nlegislature, or by anyone who acts.\nQUESTION: What if it meant just by a court?\nIt would really put a lot of pressure on the legislatures\nto -- to do what they're supposed to, and to enact these\ndistricts by law. It would take a lot of -- a lot of\nthese cases that -- that place the burden upon the\ndistrict judge to reapportion a whole State would go away.\nHe'd say, if the legislature doesn't ask, all of you guys\nare going to run at large. Boy, that would -- you know --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: That would not happen. The\nlegislature would, indeed, do the job it's supposed to.\nQUESTION: Isn't that --\nQUESTION: It -- it would make a lot of sense to\ninterpret it that way.\nQUESTION: Isn't that Mississippi's own default\nrule? Doesn't Mississippi have that same statute?\nMR. FELDMAN: They do have the same statute,\nwhich we would view as pre-empted by section 2c. But that\nwas the -- the scheme that was in effect in -- from 1941\nto 1967.\nThe reason why 2c was enacted, and the way to\ngive 2c some effect is that Congress at that time was\nfaced with a situation where there were at least six\ncourts that had threatened to order at-large election of\nentire congressional delegations in the aftermath of Baker\nagainst Carr. And Congress responded to that. The\nconcern specifically was that courts would order\nat-large elections, and the response was the enactment of\nsection 2c.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Feldman.\nMr. Wallace.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL B. WALLACE\nON BEHALF OF APPELLEES/CROSS-APPELLANTS SMITH, ET AL.\nMR. WALLACE:\nthe Court:\nIt seems that the Court is focusing on the\nquestion of preclearance here, and the real problem with\nthe question of preclearance is that the Justice\nDepartment has stopped the preclearance process because of\nthe injunction.\nNow, we believe that the Justice Department\nacted properly in so doing. They have a regulation that\nsays, we will not consider premature submissions, and this\nCourt said in Georgia that any reasonable regulation will\nbe enforced.\nTheir position is that whenever the State has\nbeen told it cannot administer a change, then it cannot be\nseeking to administer a change within the meaning of\nsection 5, and therefore, this was premature. So they\nstopped.\nNow, the question is what can be done about\nthat, and I think, in all probability, the only thing that\ncan be done about that is for the Attorney General of\nMississippi to go down the street to the district court\nand ask them to preclear the change under section 5\nbecause there does not seem to be any other mechanism\nwhereby anybody can force the Justice Department to get\nmoving on a section 5 preclearance.\nQUESTION:\nthat with the injunction outstanding, the Justice\nDepartment would have the same reason for refusing to\npreclear that it's already given?\nMR. WALLACE: I think not, Your Honor, and I\nthink that's because of the very strange system of divided\njurisdiction that Congress consciously created back in\n1965 when it said, we will let the District of Columbia\ndeal with statutory questions. We will let the court back\nhome deal with constitutional questions. That's been in\nthe act from day one, and it's given this Court trouble\nfrom day one.\nQUESTION: How long does it take if you take\nthe -- if you said derail the preclearance procedure\nbefore the Attorney General, switch to the D.C. District\nCourt track? How long do those proceedings -- section 5\nproceedings -- in the district court ordinarily take?\nMR. WALLACE: I've never been in one, Your\nHonor. I don't know that I could tell you, but I would\nthink it would take close to a year anyway. Now --\nQUESTION: Well, then why can't we just do what\nwe'd -- I'd suggested anyway -- I think others did too --\nthat -- that you -- you -- we'd simply say, look, here's\nan injunction. It rests on two grounds. Ground one, this\nplan hasn't been precleared, the Mississippi plan, the\ncourt plan. Ground two, it's unconstitutional. You'd say\nground two is, A, premature, doesn't really support the\nissue, it's an injunction -- because it's premature, et\ncetera. And now you'd have a decision that, I guess, from\na legal point of view insofar as we were right about that,\nwould just rest on the ground that it hasn't been\nprecleared.\nAnd since that's the only reason for issuing the\ninjunction, then the Department, if the State of\nMississippi wants to put the plan in effect, would\npreclear it. If the State doesn't want to put it in\neffect, well, that's their business. But -- but if they\nare going to put it in effect, then the Department would\nhave to get busy.\nMR. WALLACE: As a practical matter, Justice\nBreyer, that might get the process moving, because I think\nI've understood the United States to indicate that they\nwould get moving if that's what the Court did. But under\nthe usual rules of this Court's jurisdiction, it sits to\nreview judgments and not opinions. And the judgment is\nthat -- that the -- that the district court plan shall\nstay into effect -- shall stay in effect until\npreclearance of a constitutional plan takes effect.\nThat's true --\nQUESTION: Yes, but in affirming that, we\ncertainly can say why we're affirming it. And -- and if\nwe say, yes, the injunction is valid for one reason, and\none reason only, we do not reach the other -- the other\nreason, and there is no basis for reaching the other\nreason. Certainly we can say that.\nMR. WALLACE: And if -- and if the Court does\nsay that, and if the Justice Department does get moving as\na result of that opinion, then that will move the process\nalong.\nQUESTION: So we're in an unusual -- I mean,\nthis is unusual because I guess we would be reviewing a\nreason for the judgment. It's unusual because there's a\nlegislature that doesn't want to reapportion. And the\nthird aspect in which it's unusual is that the Supreme\nCourt of Mississippi, according to some of the parties,\nhas overturned previous cases of that court which said the\nchancery court lacks the power to enter the plan, and it\ndid it without writing an opinion. It's normal that a\ncourt writes an opinion.\nNow, is there any likelihood or chance that the\nMississippi Supreme Court, before this issue comes back to\nus, if it does, would explain what the reason is for\ndeparting from what seems to be a long precedent?\nMR. WALLACE: I suspect the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt can take a hint as well as the Justice Department,\nJustice Breyer.\nand ordinarily, the Court would not edit opinions on valid\njudgments. But if the Court does that, then certainly the\nJustice Department may move. I think the Supreme Court of\nMississippi may move.\nWe moved for a stay at the Supreme Court of\nMississippi. That stay was denied. The briefing is\nfinished. There has been no stay order. I presume they\nwill set the case for oral argument in due course. But if\nthey get an opinion from this Court that says, we'd\ncertainly like to know what you have to say, I think I can\nsay with confidence that they will set the case with --\nfor -- for argument in due course.\nSo as -- as Justice Breyer says, it is a strange\ncase. We think it is a case in which the judgment is\nabsolutely correct, and the -- and what the Justice\nDepartment has done is absolutely correct under its\nregulations.\nQUESTION: But would you say it's absolutely\ncorrect if the constitutional reasoning were wrong, and if\nthey say we won't approve a -- a Mississippi plan that is\nin violation of our constitutional holding?\nMR. WALLACE: The -- as -- as Justice Ginsburg\nhas observed, I think that is an alternative ground in the\nopinion. I do not think that it affects -- infects the\njudgment, but it makes a problem, as Mr. McDuff has noted,\nbecause even if there is section 5 preclearance down the\nroad, this district court would enjoin it again.\nQUESTION: Is it your view that the section 5\nground of decision is sufficient to -- to uphold the --\nthe injunction below?\nMR. WALLACE: We believe that it is sufficient\nto uphold the judgment below because there is no error in\nthe judgment, and there is no error --\nQUESTION: But if -- if that's true, did not the\ndistrict court violate our rule against deciding\nconstitutional issues unnecessarily?\nMR. WALLACE: I think they did not, although\nit's a close call. In Ashwander --\nQUESTION: Why is it a close call if -- if the\njudgment is clearly correct on the section 5 ground?\nMR. WALLACE: The -- the district court --\nQUESTION: It seems to me it's only a close call\nif you think there's doubt about the section 5 ground.\nMR. WALLACE: And that's why the district court\nset the alternative judgments. I think they thought they\nwere making it easier for this Court. Ashwander doesn't\nsay never decide a constitutional question.\nQUESTION: It doesn't -- says you don't do it if\nit's not necessary, and it clearly was not necessary if\nthey're right on the section 5 ground, which everybody\nseems to agree they were.\nMR. WALLACE: We certainly agree that they were,\nand if they're -- and if --\nQUESTION: The other side doesn't agree they\nwere. Would -- would you bet your life that they're --\nthat they're right about that?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WALLACE: I would be -- let me turn to that,\nif I may, Justice Scalia, because we believe that they\nare -- that the Justice Department and the district court\nwere correct on the section 5 ground. And that goes back\nto the February 14th letter for more information. As the\nAssistant Solicitor General has said, that's a standard\napplication of Georgia versus United States. When you\nhave -- when you need more information to decide a\nsection 5 issue, then the Justice Department is entitled\nto stop the clock and ask for more information, and the\nclock won't move again until they get more information.\nThis is a -- a straightforward application of a regulation\nthat this Court has already approved.\nThe district court so found, believed that the\nrequest for more information was absolutely valid, and\ntherefore said, there has been no approval, there is no\nplan in place, and for that reason, we must put in a plan\nof our own.\nQUESTION: Mr. Wallace, there is something\nunusual about that request for information. It seems to\nhave been triggered by the district court. I'm looking at\npage 100a of the appendix to the jurisdictional statement\nwhere the district court is commenting on this opinion,\nthis opaque opinion, of the Mississippi Supreme Court that\nsays the chancery court has authority, and then says --\nthis is the end of the first paragraph on the page -- that\nat the very least, the Attorney General of the United\nStates will consider the implications very carefully and\nmight perhaps request more information. I'm not aware of\nthe -- of district courts telling the Attorney General how\nthe preclearance process should run. Is this standard\noperating procedure?\nMR. WALLACE: By no means is it standard,\nJustice Ginsburg. But what the district court was doing\nin this case was deciding whether or not there would be\nenough time for the preclearance to be completed before\nthe qualifying date. The intervenors were suggesting we\ndid not need a Federal trial, we should wait for the\nJustice Department to finish its work.\nThe Justice Department already had before it a\ncomplicated submission from the -- from the Attorney\nGeneral of Mississippi, which begins on page 228 -- 221a\nof the appendix to the jurisdictional statement, and that\npresented not only the -- not only the congressional\nredistricting plan itself, but also the decision of the\nSupreme Court of Mississippi to overrule 70 years of\nprecedent and allow trial courts to do redistricting. So\nthose two issues were already before the Justice\nDepartment when the district court wrote.\nBut all the district court wrote -- said is, we\nthink we better get busy and try this case because this\nlooks like a real hard submission to us, and we're not\nsure that they're going to be able to decide this case\nbefore our qualifying date. So it's unusual, but it's\ncertainly well within the -- the scope of what the\ndistrict court was being asked to do. And I think they\nproperly pointed out problems.\nAnd -- and with the help of the district\ncourt -- the help, indeed, of the submission that Attorney\nGeneral Moore had already made, I think the Justice\nDepartment properly saw that there were questions that\nneeded to be asked. They asked those questions, and that\nstopped the 60 days from running.\nQUESTION: We also have to reach your issue,\ndon't we? Even if we agree with you on that, we still\nhave to reach the cross-appeal issue, don't we?\nMR. WALLACE: I -- I think you do.\nQUESTION: Or do we?\nMR. WALLACE: I think you do because in --\nbecause once it is conceded that the -- the district court\nhad to impose a remedy in 2002, then the question arises\nof what that remedy should be. And it was our position in\nthe district court, and it is our position here that the\ndistrict court should have enforced the law of the State\nof Mississippi, as Justice Stevens has observed, says that\nyou must have at-large elections, and an act of Congress\ndating back to 1941 that says you must have at-large\nelections in these circumstances. That's section 2a(c)(5)\nof Title II. We ask for that to be enforced, and that's\nan issue that I think must be reached in this case\nregardless.\nI think the United States has the only argument\nfor not enforcing the 1941 act. They claim that it is\nabsolutely incontrovertibly inconsistent on its face. For\nthe reasons that Justice O'Connor has stated, we think it\nis not inconsistent on its face.\nWe also point back --\nQUESTION: No court has ever done it before --\nMR. WALLACE: No court --\nQUESTION: -- in all of the years that courts\nhave been operating under this act.\nMR. WALLACE: This Court did it under almost\nidentical statutes 70 years ago in Smiley and Carroll and\nKoenig.\nQUESTION: 2c didn't exist then.\nMR. WALLACE: There was a 1911 act that said\nbasically the same thing. The 1911 act says you shall\nelect Representatives by districts, but at the same time\nit says, but if districts have not be redistricted, then\nany new Representatives will be elected at large. And\nthat's --\nQUESTION: To get your -- to get your result,\nyou have to read, there shall be established by State law\na number of districts, et cetera. And -- and, in fact,\nit's pretty hard to read it that way, for me it seems,\nbecause this thing, there shall be established by law a\nnumber of districts, i.e., not at-large, was enacted by\nCongress in response to courts that had threatened --\ncourts, not legislatures -- that had threatened at-large\nelections. And so they were quite unhappy about that in\nCongress, and they passed this law saying there shall be\nestablished by law a number districts. It seems to me\ntheir object was certainly court districting, wasn't it,\nas well as legislative districting?\nMR. WALLACE: As difficult as it is to read the\nmind of Congress, Justice Breyer, I think that while they\nwere clearly unhappy, they were unable to agree in any\ndetail on what ought to be done.\nthere was -- there were people who stood up in both houses\nof Congress and suggested that this law would not be\nenforced in States -- in court proceedings, that it was\nbeing -- that it was addressing itself to legislatures.\nQUESTION: It was repeating the 1911 law that\nyou just mentioned?\nMR. WALLACE: There it --\nQUESTION: Why -- why did they -- why did\nthey pass it if it didn't do anything but -- but say what\nthe -- what the 1911 law already said?\nMR. WALLACE: I think it's -- I think it is\ndifficult to know why they passed it, there being no\nreports --\nQUESTION: Well, you've got to give me some\nplausible reason. I mean --\nQUESTION: Legislative history helps, by the\nway.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: I gather the legislative history\nyou've just told us is, as usual, on both sides of this\nthing. Is that right?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WALLACE: We believe it is, Your Honor.\nAs -- as was noted in the Hanson decision in the D.C.\nCircuit, I think there was gamesmanship on both sides in\nboth houses. Gamesmanship is a word that comes from the\nHanson case.\nQUESTION: But, Mr. Wallace, one thing isn't, I\nthink, debatable and that is since 2c is on the books, no\ncourt has ever resorted to whatever -- was 2a, whatever.\nSince 2c is there, that's the one that the courts have\nused, is that not so?\nMR. WALLACE: It is -- I don't know that they\nhave enforced 2c. I think most of them have believed that\nthey were acting under this Court's oversight which tells\ncourts always to read -- always to do single-member\ndistricts when they can. But it's certainly true,\nJustice Ginsburg, no court since 1967 has ordered at-large\nelections in -- in redistricting cases.\nBut we believe what -- if you look at the rules\nof construction, and at what Congress actually did,\nwithout trying to speculate on what they were trying to\ndo, they enacted language that had been before this Court\nin 1911 and was -- and was construed in 1932 to allow\nat-large elections.\nQUESTION: I assume --\nQUESTION: Except --\nQUESTION: Go on.\nQUESTION: No.\nExcept for one fact, and that is now we have a\ndistricting statute which -- which is the later one in\ntime. The -- the districting command and the at-large\ncommand are no longer of -- of even weight. The\ndistricting command is later in time and therefore, to the\nextent that there's any conflict, that's got to get some\nprecedence.\nMR. WALLACE: That would -- and that is a\ndifference in 1911 because those two parts of the act were\nenacted at the same time.\nQUESTION: Yes, yes.\nMR. WALLACE: But if they could be construed\nconsistently in 1911, then I think they can be construed\nconsistently in 2002. And if they can be construed\nconsistently, it doesn't matter which one was enacted\nfirst.\nQUESTION: Except that there would be no\npossible reason for reenacting it if they're -- if they're\ngoing to be construed consistently, just as they were when\nthey were both enacted simultaneously.\nMR. WALLACE: The -- the difficulty of figuring\nout what Congress thought it was doing on this single\npiece of legislation tacked onto a private immigration\nbill is very difficult, Justice Scalia. I recognize it.\nBut as we noted in our brief, which did discuss the\nlegislative history, they had thought about this for\n2 years and specifically considered repealing the 1941\nact, and they didn't do it. They came back and did\nsomething else. And we think under standard rules of --\nof construction, that means the 1941 act --\nQUESTION: Mr. Wallace, do you agree with the --\nwith Mr. Feldman that in any event the Mississippi statute\nis out of the picture because that's pre-empted no matter\nwhich way we go on this issue?\nMR. WALLACE: I think it would be hard to argue\nthat Congress impliedly repealed a 1941 act and didn't\nintend to pre-empt a State law that said the same thing.\nI've tried to come up with that argument, Justice Stevens,\nbut I don't think I can make it.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WALLACE: So --\nQUESTION: What do you -- what do you answer to\nthe -- the fear that one has to have that redistricting by\nhaving all the elections at large is precisely what those\nwho were interested in diluting minority vote would like?\nMR. WALLACE: Well, first of all, Your Honor,\nthe -- the answer that I have is that an act of Congress\nis not subject to the Voting Rights Act, and would be\nenforced on its face.\nBut the other answer I have is this. We have a\nlong history over the last 20 and 30 years in Mississippi\nof coming up with remedies which will protect the rights\nof minority voters. The most common remedy since Gingles\nis to do single-member districts, but it's not the only\nremedy. And there are remedies where you can elect people\nat large and because of the way the election is held, all\npeople running together, not requiring majority votes, not\nhaving -- not having anti-single-shot requirements, those\nhave worked in Mississippi. Minorities have been elected\nin white jurisdictions in multi-member races by using\nthose sorts of procedures.\nCongress didn't tell us what sort of procedure\nto use in an at-large election, and in Young v. Fordice,\nthis Court made clear that whatever procedures you use\nwould have to be precleared. I don't think the\nlegislature will act for all of the reasons we've seen,\nbut the district court would certainly use those remedies.\nThey've used them before. Minorities will be protected.\nQUESTION: Mr. Wallace, can I go back to the\nconstitutional issue that the district court decided in\nthis case? Your -- your adversaries say that you do not\ndefend the reasoning employed by the district court, even\nthough you defend their judgment. Do you think that's a\nfair comment on your position?\nMR. WALLACE: I think I defend the reasoning of\nthe district court as far as it went. I draw a\ndistinction between this case and Growe that they -- they\nsimply said that in Growe, the Supreme Court did not\nconsider this issue, which is true, and therefore we look\nat the chancery court. It's not the legislature. It\ncan't act.\nThere is a distinction -- another distinction\nbetween Growe and this case, which -- which the district\ncourt did not dwell on and we dwell on in our briefs. In\nGrowe, there was a Federal claim before the district\ncourt -- before the State court. And under the Supremacy\nClause, ordinarily a State court must litigate Federal\nclaims, and this Court recognized their authority to do\nso in Growe.\nHere, for whatever reason, the plaintiffs in\nthe -- in the chancery court who are intervenors in this\nCourt did not assert a Federal claim. They made it quite\nplain, we are proceeding only under State law. We do not\nwant to proceed under Federal law, and that under\nU.S. v. Term Limits simply doesn't exist. There is no\nFederal -- there is no State law claim for congressional\nredistricting. So that's the difference between Growe and\nthis case, and this is -- that's the grounds on which we\ndefend it.\nQUESTION: You mean there is no State law\nrequiring redistricting at all?\nMR. WALLACE: There is -- there is no State\nlaw -- first of all, there is no State law requiring\nredistricting. There are statutes that talk about how the\nlegislature proceeds, but there is no substantive law that\nsays redistricting shall take place.\nQUESTION: So as a matter of State law, the\nMississippi legislature is under no duty to -- to\nredistrict?\nMR. WALLACE: It is under no duty to redistrict,\nand could be under no duty to redistrict because the\nredistricting requirement comes only from the United\nStates Constitution. The authority to redistrict comes\nfrom the Elections Clause, and the State of Mississippi\ncannot impose on their legislators any requirement having\nto do with congressional redistricting. A decision was\nmade by the Framers over 200 years ago that legislators\nare the people to regulate congressional elections, and if\nthey fail to do it in their job of representing the\npeople, then Congress will do it in its job of\nrepresenting the people.\nQUESTION: Why can't a State just say we require\nour legislature under State law to conform to the Federal\nrequirements by having a plan by January 15th by going to\nthe chancery court if you don't have a plan, et cetera?\nMR. WALLACE:\nit -- it -- the -- perhaps the legislature could do that.\nQUESTION: And if the State of Mississippi says,\nwell, that in effect is what they did, don't we have to\ntake their word for it?\nMR. WALLACE: No, I don't think you do, Your\nHonor. First of all, perhaps they could delegate\nauthority. If the legislature said this problem is too\nhard for us, we want to delegate it to State courts, then\nthat -- that issue would be tested like any other\ndelegation.\nQUESTION: In a State court, and here we have an\nunexplained judgment without an opinion of the Mississippi\nSupreme Court which seems to say that's what it is. It\ndoesn't say, but that's the holding of it.\nMR. WALLACE: But it -- but when you are dealing\nwith Federal constitutional guarantees and provisions, you\ndo not always take the State courts as -- as gospel even\non State law. The district court here said there is no\ndelegation, and as Your Honor knows, there was no\nexplanation of why the writ of prohibition was denied.\nIt really doesn't set much of a precedent for anything,\nbut the district court, which is familiar with Mississippi\nlaw, says there is no delegation in this case. We have\nlooked at Mississippi law, and nothing has been delegated.\nSo the question of whether a legislature could\ndelegate power to the courts is not here. What we have\nbefore us is a case where the legislature has not\ndelegated power to the courts. It has simply done nothing\nand when it does nothing, the States in that circumstance\nare powerless to act if we go back to the acts of\nCongress, and we think we enforce the at-large statute\nfrom 1941 as the district court should have done.\nIf there are no questions, I thank the Court.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Wallace.\nMr. McDuff, you have 5 minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT B. McDUFF\nON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS/CROSS-APPELLEES BRANCH, ET AL.\nMR. McDUFF: Thank you, Your Honor.\nJustice Breyer, the State of Mississippi does\nwant to put the plan into effect. That was the order of\nthe Mississippi Supreme Court, however brief it was,\nsaying the chancery court's plan will remain in effect\nuntil -- unless superseded by a timely plan of the State\nlegislature. The Attorney General submitted the plan for\npreclearance under order by the chancery court. He has\ndone -- he has not withdrawn the preclearance submission.\nQUESTION: The statutory language is not -- is\nnot whether it's in effect or not. It's whether he's\nseeking to administer it. That's the problem.\nMR. McDUFF:\nthe absence of the appeal here, particularly where we are\ntaking the appeal, that suggests he's not seeking to\nadminister it, Justice Scalia.\nAnd let me mention one other thing along those\nlines. The language is enact or seek to administer. Now,\nthe lesson of Growe v. Emison, at least we think, is that\na State court stands in the shoes of the legislature when\nthe legislature defaults on redistricting, and certainly\nif the legislature had enacted this plan, and the -- it\nhad been enjoined by the Federal court for whatever\nreasons, and the Attorney General had not taken an appeal,\nbut legislative leaders had or intervenors had, I don't\nthink we would say that the preclearance submission was\nthereby withdrawn. It seems to me the State court is in\nno different position, and we shouldn't say that the\nAttorney General's failure to appeal here would withdraw\nthe submission where it wouldn't in the legislative\ncontext.\nThe -- and -- and the plan has been precleared\nin our view, if not the -- by the first 60 days, certainly\nby the time of the second 60 days, where the Justice\nDepartment said, we're not going to continue to review\nthis plan because of the constitutional injunction.\nWell, there's no language in section 5 that\nstops the 60-day period from running on that ground.\nThat -- it is a statute that admits of no exceptions.\nThere is no regulation that allow -- by which the Justice\nDepartment says, we will not continue to -- to consider\na -- a plan that has been enjoined on constitutional\ngrounds. And in fact, the Solicitor General has not even\nsaid in his brief that that is the regular practice of the\nDepartment.\nHere there are compelling reasons why it is\nimportant for the 60-day period to be removed even if\nthere's a constitutional injunction. Often these cases\nare decided under severe time constraints. If a\nconstitutional injunction is imposed, State officials may\ntry to remove it as quickly as possible and restore the\nplan in time for the election. If the section 5 obstacle\nis delayed in the meantime, the -- it -- it, in effect,\nprolongs itself by feeding off the constitutional\ninjunction, and even if the constitutional injunction is\nvacated, the State still has to deal with this\nnow-postponed section 5 obstacle that will not be removed\nin some situations in time for the election.\nLet me say one other thing about the\nconstitutional ruling, the fact that it was an alternative\nground. We think there is doubt about the section 5\nground, as we've suggested here, and particularly given\nthe importance of resolving these cases so that elections\ncan go forward without continued Federal court\ninterference, I think it is crucial for this Court to rule\non the constitutional ground, as well as the preclearance\nground here.\nThe rule of Connor, and the rule of the Warren\nCounty case are not jurisdictional rules. They're\nsupervisory rules imposed by this Court to ensure the\norderly processing of the section 5 issue when it's --\nwhen it's in a case in which other issues are involved.\nHere the orderly processing of this litigation,\nand the creation of the situation where Mississippi can\nconduct its elections in 2004 without continued confusion\nof the type that we had at the last election, that\ninterest favors resolving the constitutional issue now, at\nthe same time the section 5 issue is resolved.\nAnd so for all of these reasons and the reasons\nset forth in our brief, we respectfully urge that the\nCourt vacate the injunction of the district court on all\ngrounds.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. McDuff.\n"
