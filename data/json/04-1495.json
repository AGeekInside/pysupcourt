        "content": "(11:18 a.m.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We'll hear argument now in\n04-1495, Hartman against Moore.\nMr. Kneedler, whenever you're ready, you may\nproceed.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. KNEEDLER: Justice Stevens, and may it\nplease the Court:\nRespondent alleges in this Bivens action that\npetitioners, who were postal inspectors, caused him to\nbe prosecuted in retaliation for activity protected by\nthe First Amendment. In order to make out such a\nclaim, however, respondent must establish that there\nwas no probable cause for the prosecution. That is so\nfor three mutually reinforcing reasons.\nFirst, that requirement accords with the\ndeference this Court has consistently held in Armstrong\nand other cases must be given to the prosecutorial\nfunction because that function is core to the executive\nbranch's operations and because prosecutorial decision-\nmaking is ill-suited to judicial second guessing.\nSecond, that rule accords a -- an important\nobjective screen and check against claims of\nretaliatory prosecution in order to guard against the\nchilling effect that would otherwise routinely arise\nfrom inquiry into the subjective motivations of those\ninvolved in the prosecutorial decisionmaking process.\nAnd third, that rule is deeply rooted in\nhistory. A claim of First Amendment retaliatory\nprosecution is but one species of a claim of malicious\nprosecution, and it has long been required that an\nessential element of a claim of malicious prosecution\nis that the plaintiff show an absence of probable cause\nfor the prosecution.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm -- I'm not sure why --\nwhy we should make the classification that you did,\nthat -- that retaliatory is simply a species of -- of\nmalicious. I mean, I -- I can see the similarities,\nbut we've also got an entirely separate First Amendment\nvalue here which just is not part of the -- the\nanalytical mix when you're talking about malicious\nprosecution. So I'm not sure why we should -- we -- we\nshould classify it as you argue.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- for several\nreasons. First of all, the -- the First Amendment --\nthe alleged First Amendment retaliation describes the\nmalice, a form of the malice that would arise in --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it's -- it's a peculiar,\nif you will, a peculiar malice with its own set of\nconstitutional values, and I don't know of anything\ncomparable in -- in malicious prosecution generically.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, to be sure, what renders\nit malice or wrongful is the First Amendment, but --\nbut the derivation of -- of the reason for why it's\nwrongful does not, I think, detract from the essential\nrelevance of the tort of malicious prosecution.\nAnd if -- if I may add to that, the -- the\nreason why the -- the tort of malicious prosecution is\nhighly relevant here is not simply because on the\nmalice side of it, but also because it has long been\nrecognized, beginning with Blackstone before the First\nAmendment and the Constitution were even adopted, that\nthere are critical interests on the other side, not\nsimply the defendant's interest in avoiding badly\nmotivated prosecutions, but the important\ncountervailing public interest of ensuring that\nwrongdoers are brought to justice and that those who\nhave information about it will come forward.\nAnd -- and that was recognized by Blackstone\nearly on and has been recognized consistent --\nconsistently by this Court in -- in many, many\ndecisions, including recent cases of this Court\ninvolving immunity issues, which is what we have here,\nspecifically recognizing that the tort of malicious\nprosecution is very instructive in deciding how rules\nshould be applied when a Bivens action or a 1983 action\nis brought in the specific context of prosecution.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But, of course, here --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose there is probable\ncause for a prosecution, but the prosecutors are\nextremely busy and they -- they have to select their\ncases and they select one in which they bring the\nprosecution against the defendant on account of his\nspeech. Is that a violation of the prosecutorial duty?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, in -- in terms -- in\nterms of the responsibilities of the prosecutor, there\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- that -- that should not --\nthat should not be a -- a selection criterion in\nitself, but it --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm -- I'm asking is it a\nviolation of the prosecutor's professional obligations\nand his professional duties?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- I would think\nordinarily yes, but with this caveat. Unlike race\nwhich is never relevant to the prosecutorial decision-\nmaking process, there can often be a prosecution -- and\nthis case is one of them -- in which you might have\nclaims of public corruption. And -- and in fact, there\nwas a guilty plea here on the part of a member of the\nPostal Service board of directors for receiving\npayments to -- for his activity on behalf of\nrespondent's corporation and others. This -- this --\ninvolving contracts for $250 million. This was a very,\nvery important procurement by the Post Office\nDepartment and it is understandable that in connection\nwith that prosecution, the prosecutors and the Postal\nService investigators would look into issues of\nrespondent's, or people in his behalf, approaching the\nGovernment.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Just going back to the\nhypothetical, if -- if you acknowledge -- and I think\nyou must -- that there's a violation of the\nprosecutorial duty in -- in the instance I suppose,\nthen why shouldn't the law recognize it and -- and give\nforce to that sanction and give force to that rule?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, there -- there are\ncertain restrictions -- certainly restrictions on what\nthe prosecutor may do, but several points about that.\nFirst of all, this is not a Bivens action\nagainst the prosecutor. The prosecutor is absolutely\nimmune from suit. The prosecutor's decision-making\nprocess is -- is, in fact, as is the grand jury's, a --\na critical protection against malicious prosecution --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. Well, then\nwe'll just change the hypothetical to make it the\ninvestigators. The investigators select their case\nbased on this speech that they consider unwelcome.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, the -- the question is\nwhether in that circumstance the -- the Bivens\nplaintiff, the criminal defendant, has a First\nAmendment right to be excused from prosecution or,\nafter the prosecution is unsuccessful, to bring a civil\naction, whether he has a right not to have been\nprosecuted in those circumstances notwithstanding the\nexistence of probable cause and the independent\njudgment by the prosecutor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, does he have a right\nnot to be singled out because of his speech?\nMR. KNEEDLER: He does -- he does not have a\n-- he does not have a First Amendment claim in those\ncircumstances where there is probable cause for the\nviolation. The --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I asked does he have a\nright not to be singled out because of his speech.\nMR. KNEEDLER: He does not have a First\nAmendment right not to be singled out in those\ncircumstances.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In other words, you -- you\nwould advise law enforcement officials that they can\nsingle out persons for prosecution based on distasteful\nspeech.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I would not. I -- I'm not --\nI'm not endorsing the motivation. What I'm -- what I'm\nsaying is what is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What I want you to do is to\nagree. I -- I think you have to concede there is this\nprinciple in the law, and I think your answer has to be\neven though there's that principle, there's a lot of\nproblems with enforcing it because there are going to\nbe too many suits, it's hard to -- it's difficult for\nthe Government to defend, and -- and so forth and so\non.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right. I -- I'm not disputing\nthat it -- that -- that a -- a prosecution should not\nbe brought or should not be heard --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And you're not disputing\neither, as I understand it. As the case comes to us,\nwe assume the prosecution would not have been brought\nbut for the retaliatory motive.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I -- it is -- we certainly\ndisagree with that with our proposition.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But don't you assume that\nfor the purposes of your argument?\nMR. KNEEDLER: For -- for purposes of our\nprobable -- probable cause claim, yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, that's the only\nargument.\nMR. KNEEDLER: That -- that is true, but\nthat, of course, was also true at common law for -- for\nmalicious prosecution.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the -- one of the\ndifferences -- am I not correct, that at common law the\nprosecutor did not have absolute immunity?\nMR. KNEEDLER: At common law -- at common\nlaw, yes. As this Court has recognized in\nreformulating the common law principles of -- of\nimmunity, the -- the public prosecutor now has absolute\nimmunity under -- under these --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Now does, but not at common\nlaw.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- under these Court's --\nunder this Court's decisions.\nBut at common law, the prosecutor did have\nthe protection of malicious prosecution, and as\nJustice Scalia observed in his concurring opinion in\nthe Kalina decision, the elements of the tort of\nprosecution essentially had a built-in qualified\nimmunity, and the probable cause requirement was\nessentially that. It afforded protection for the\nprosecutor. The -- the private citizen who -- who --\nthe complaining witness -- he could not be the subject\nof a suit for damages if -- if the charges were\ndismissed, not simply upon a showing -- it required\nmore than simply a showing of malice. It required a\nshowing of an absence of probable cause for reasons\nthat are essentially identical to the qualified\nimmunity and absolute immunity -- the -- the reasons\nfor qualified and absolute immunity.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, they're not totally\nidentical because you didn't have the First Amendment\ninterest involved in those cases, whereas you do have a\nFirst Amendment interest at stake here.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But -- but on -- on the -- on\nthe governmental interest side of the balance, the\ninterests are exactly the same in both -- in both\ncircumstances. And that is not to chill -- not -- not\nto create circumstances where people would hold back\nfrom coming forward with information of violations of\nthe law because of fear that they would be sued and\nretaliated against afterward. And that hasn't changed\nnow that we have public prosecutors. It's still\ncritical.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler, may -- would\nyou clarify just one point about this probable cause?\nThere was a grand jury that indicted this man, and then\nthere was a trial judge who said, I'm throwing this out\nat the close of the Government's case. There is not\nenough evidence here to convict this man.\nAre you saying that as long as the grand jury\nindicts, there can be no Bivens claim because in order\nto indict, the grand jury would have had to find\nprobable cause?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, at -- at common law\non the tort of malicious prosecution, the indictment\ncreated a presumption because an indictment does have\nto depend upon probable cause, and under the -- under\nthis Court's decision in Gerstein v. Pugh and other\ndecisions, that can't be reexamined by the court in the\nprosecution.\nBut at common law, the -- the indictment\ncreated a presumption that was subject to rebuttal by\nthe -- by the civil plaintiff. There was some\ndisagreement about what would be necessary, whether you\nwould have to show fraud on the grand jury or whether\nyou could just retry --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, tell me about now,\nnot at the common law.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. We do not -- we do not\nthink that the existence of the grand -- it has not\nbeen our position that the existence of the indictment\nis dispositive and cannot be challenged, but we do\nthink it --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the grand jury did\nfind probable cause. So what would the plaintiff have\nto show to overcome -- to -- to negate that finding of\nprobable cause?\nMR. KNEEDLER: We -- we think in a -- in a --\nit would have to show by at least a preponderance of\nthe evidence, maybe a clear showing, that there was not\nprobable cause. And I think that also ties in to the\n-- to the standard for qualified immunity, which is\ncould a reasonable person in those circumstances have\nbelieved that there was probable cause. I think, if\nthe grand jury returns an indictment, that that should\nbe pretty persuasive evidence but not compelling\nevidence -- I mean, not dispositive evidence that there\nwas probable cause.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: The case that comes\nclosest, as far as I can see, is probably United States\nv. Armstrong, and in that case, this Court said in the\nordinary case, so long as the prosecutor has probable\ncause to believe the offense was committed, the\ndecision to prosecute or go before a grand jury rests\nentirely in his discretion. But, of course, the\ndiscretion is subject to constitutional constraints,\nthe equal protection component of the Due Process\nClause. The decision whether to prosecute may not be\nbased on an unjustifiable standard such as race,\nreligion, or other arbitrary classification. And the\nstandard the Court articulated there was the defendant\nmust present clear evidence --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, clear evidence, and the\nCourt stressed that it was a --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- to the contrary. Now,\nthat's different from your proposition of probable\ncause.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- I think several\nthings may explain that.\nIn Armstrong, that was a claim of selective\nprosecution that was brought --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Based on race.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Based on race. That was one\nof the distinctions I was going to point to. And\nsecondly --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: So why should that be\ndifferent than the First Amendment violation?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, as -- as this Court's\ndecision in -- in Johnson, for example, shows, there --\ndistinctions based on race are subject to strict\nscrutiny no matter what the context, in that case even\nin the prison context, whereas First Amendment claims\noften take account of the context in which they are\nraised. For example, this Court in the American-Arab\nAnti-Discrimination case held that there would -- could\nbe no claim at all of selective prosecution in the\nimmigration context because of the important\ncountervailing interest in enforcing the law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you're willing to\nacknowledge -- and -- and the Government concedes that\nyou can have a different standard when the -- the basis\nfor the selective prosecution happens to violate the\nConstitution from the standard you apply where the\nbasis for the selective prosecution doesn't violate the\nConstitution, such as I'm prosecuting him because he\nwas mean to my brother-in-law. Okay?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are you going to apply a\ndifferent standard there than you would apply where --\nwhere the reason is some First Amendment reason?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, no. The -- the other\ndistinction -- and -- and I'm not sure if this goes to\nyour point or not. The other distinction is that in\nArmstrong the claim was made in the criminal\nprosecution itself. Here, the claim is the civil\naction after the criminal prosecution is over with, and\nit's in that -- in that context especially that the\nanalogy to malicious prosecution is very strong and why\nthe element of -- that the person has to -- that the --\nthere has to have been a favorable termination for the\n-- for the plaintiff and there has to be a probable cause.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But that doesn't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But would you answer my\nquestion?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I'm -- I'm not sure that I --\nmaybe -- I guess I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's going be a different\ncriterion -- you -- you say it's going to be different\nfor the First Amendment and the -- and -- and the Equal\nProtection Clause, at least where race is involved.\nWhat if there's no constitutional violation at all, but\nI just selectively prosecute him just because I don't\nlike this guy or because he was mean to a relative of\nmine?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, I don't -- I don't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is there going to be a\ndifferent standard --\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. There -- there wouldn't\nbe any -- any constitutional claim and any -- any\ncommon law --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly, and would you apply\na different standard because there isn't a\nconstitutional claim?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. There wouldn't be any\nclaim at all. I mean, there wouldn't be any basis for\na claim.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- a malicious prosecution\nclaim. You'd have a malicious prosecution claim.\nMR. KNEEDLER: There -- there -- and in the\n-- in the Federal sphere, if there was a malicious -- a\ncommon law malicious prosecution claim, that would have\nto be brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act against\nthe United States.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. Kneedler, I\nunderstand your argument to be they should be treated\njust like a malicious prosecution claim, which is no\ndistinction between a constitutional basis and a common\n-- and just that he hated his brother-in-law. I think\nyou're saying they're the same. That's what I\nunderstand Justice Scalia to be asking you.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's what I'm asking.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, yes. I -- I am -- I am\nsaying that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Which places no weight at\nall on the fact the Constitution is involved.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Oh -- oh, it does because the\n-- because the -- the first -- the existence of the\nFirst Amendment claim is what gives you the Bivens\ncause of action in the first place. So otherwise,\nthere wouldn't be any Federal cause of action at all\nwithout -- without the First Amendment claim.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's how you'd get at\nleast as much protection as if it was an ordinary\nmalicious prosecution claim, but you don't get any more\nunder your view.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, because -- and -- and\nagain, this -- this is -- this is because of the -- of\nthe background of the common law tort of malicious\nprosecution, which strikes exactly the balance that I\n-- that I'm talking about.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But you really want three\nthings. You say we want the protection, number one, of\nthere -- if you're -- if there's probable cause, that's\nthe end of it. Number two, if you're trying to show\nthere wasn't probable cause, you have to bear clear and\nconvincing evidence, and number three, we also have\nqualified immunity. And I guess, number four, you have\nto prove the whole thing by clear and convincing\nevidence.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It sounds a little bit like\nthe person who has the overcoat, turns up the heat, you\nknow, five or -- what about one?\nMR. KNEEDLER: The -- the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about this one? And I\nwant to know -- you simply say you need clear and\nconvincing evidence that that was the motive and it\nwouldn't have been brought otherwise. And the\nexistence of probable cause is a strong factor, maybe\neven a presumption, that suggests to the contrary.\nNow, have States and other places tried\nthings like that without the world collapsing?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. My understanding from --\nfrom reading the treatises on -- on malicious\nprosecution, for example, that there has been no\nwatering down of the probable cause requirement because\nit is understood to be a critical check against --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So as far as you know, every\nState and every jurisdiction where -- and investigators\nif they don't have absolutely immunity, whatever -- in\nall those jurisdictions, nobody has ever said that even\na constitutional violation, if there's probable cause,\nthat's the end of it.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I'm -- I'm focusing on\nthe tort of malicious prosecution which is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, I'm not focusing.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- which --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I want to know --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- if --\nMR. KNEEDLER: I'm not -- I'm not aware --\nI'm not aware that any jurisdiction has done that.\nBut in response to your proposal, the -- the\n-- what -- what's wrong with that is that it would\nallow extensive inquiry, discovery, other inquiry into\nthe subjective motivations of persons involved in the\ndecision-making process with no mechanism analogous to\nimmunity or the -- or the probable cause criterion to\nweed out --\nJUSTICE BREYER: We have no experience. We\ndon't know. Okay. As your -- as far as you can tell.\nThe other question I have, which you might\nwant to be brief about, is in looking through this\nrecord, as far as I could see from the briefs, they\nwent ahead and prosecuted this man with only two pieces\nof evidence. The first evidence was that he tore some\npages out of his notebook. But he introduced lots of\nnotebooks to show he always tore pages out when he gave\nthem to his secretary. And the second was that he told\nsome witnesses be very careful and answer the question.\nNow, you know, he said a few other things, but they\nall seemed like the kind of things that people would\nalways say to witnesses.\nNow, if that's the only evidence, except for\nthe fact he owns the company, how is there probable\ncause here?\nMR. KNEEDLER: There -- there was much, much\nmore evidence.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I didn't see any in\nthe brief.\nMR. KNEEDLER: There --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I saw a lot about other\npeople in the brief, but not about him.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, for one thing, it's\nabsolutely conceded that there was a conspiracy. Three\npeople pleaded guilty, including --\nJUSTICE BREYER: There are all kinds of\nthings about other people.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, but -- but --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I didn't --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- the -- it isn't all about\nother people. The -- the -- that crime included -- and\nit's accepted in this case that the Postal Service\nboard of -- board member accepted 30 percent of the\nfees paid by respondent's company to the consulting\nfirm. Respondent's company. He was the chief\nexecutive officer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I would like you to limit\nyourself to what I didn't concede. I concede it's his\ncompany. I concede that he tore some pages out of his\nnotebook, and I concede that he told -- which he did a\nlot of times. And I concede that he told witnesses\nanswer the question, et cetera. Now, is there anything\nelse connecting him, not his company?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. In -- in the summer of\n1984, before there was even a consulting agreement,\nthere was a series of conversations between Voss, the\npostal board -- board member, and respondent, including\none for which there are notes in which Voss said I am\nworking for you.\nThere -- there was an -- there is an\nabundance of evidence involving Reedy who is -- no. I\n-- I know, but just in -- just in terms of -- just in\nterms of the sequence.\nThere is evidence that Voss and Moore were\ngood friends. Voss said that he had a close\nrelationship with respondent, and when the contract was\nfirst being negotiated, Reedy acknowledged that Voss\nand Moore were good friends. They had a close\nrelationship. They were not distant.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Kneedler, I know you're\nresponding to Justice Breyer's question, but I think\nfor purposes of our decision, we're not supposed to\ndecide whether there was probable cause or not, but\nwe're to give you the opportunity to prove there was if\n-- if you win on your --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, although I -- I certainly\ndo not want to leave the misimpression that -- and\nthere is -- there is much more.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But that's a disputed\nissue, and we don't have to decide the probable cause\nissue. Is that not correct?\nMR. KNEEDLER: That -- that -- you do not\nhave -- you do not have to decide it, but I would\ncertainly urge the Court not to proceed on the\nassumption or make any comments that there is because\nthere were -- there were --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But because the other side\nis arguing that even if there is probable cause, the\nburden shifts when they prove the retaliatory motive,\nand you have to prove that you would never -- you made\n-- you would have brought the prosecution even if there\nhad been no retaliatory motive. That's what we're\narguing --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right, and that is their\nposition. And that position accords -- yes, that is\ntheir position. And that accords no particular --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And the question I would\nask is why should this be different from a wrongful\ndischarge case in which there's ample cause to\ndischarge and the issue boils down to whether or not he\nwould have been discharged anyway. Why isn't it the\nsame -- same situation?\nMR. KNEEDLER: What is very different is that\nthis is the prosecutorial function. As this Court\nrecognized in Armstrong, that is a core executive\nbranch function and it is one that the courts are ill-\nsuited to second-guess because a whole variety of\ndeterminations can enter into whether to prosecute\nsomebody, whether they -- whether the particular\nconduct -- how culpable the person is, whether the\nconduct fits into the overall prosecutorial priorities,\nwhether there will be cooperating witnesses, what --\nwhat the office's resources are. There are a whole\nbunch of -- of judgments that courts are ill-suited to\nsecond-guess, and it would be very chilling if the\nprosecutor had to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Wouldn't -- wouldn't all\nthose considerations justify a rule that makes the\nburden of proving the retaliatory motive very high,\nsay, maybe it has to be by clear and convincing\nevidence or something like that? But once you have it\nacknowledged -- I don't know if they're really\nacknowledged here, but there's strong evidence of\nretaliatory motive -- why shouldn't the burden shift\njust on that, on the basis of that proof?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well -- oh, not -- we do not\nthink there is strong evidence of retaliatory motive.\nAnd I -- I can -- can address that, but --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And if you had a --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- but --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- if you had a heavy\nburden of proof at that stage of the proceeding,\nwouldn't that protect the interests that mainly concern\nyou?\nMR. KNEEDLER: We -- we think the more direct\n-- I don't think so for -- partly for the reason that I\n-- that I gave to Justice Breyer is that -- that that\nwould not protect against discovery and -- and the sort\nof chilling inquiry that this Court has recognized in\nits immunity cases, and especially in the prosecutorial\nfunction where the prosecutor would be required to\ndisclose. Even though the prosecutor is absolutely\nimmune, the prosecutor's decision-making process and\nhis communication with law enforcement agents would --\nwould be exposed for judicial scrutiny, public scrutiny\nin a way that could chill the prosecutorial function.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Kneedler, the defendant\nhere is not the prosecutor. Right?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Just someone who provided\ninformation to the prosecutor that -- that was\nerroneous and allegedly maliciously motivated.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I don't think erroneous. It\nwas allegedly maliciously motivated.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Allegedly maliciously\nmotivated, at least.\nI don't understand how you would apply the\ntest, would -- you know, would you have prosecuted\nanyway, when -- you know, but for the malicious motive,\nwhen the person you're -- you're suing is not the\nprosecutor. It wasn't up to this person whether there\nwould be a prosecution.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think that's a -- I think\nthat's a very important point, and before a -- a court\nenters into that, in the end, unknowable question,\nmaybe a court can -- can, in the end, determine\nprobabilities, but before a court undertakes that,\nwhich requires looking not simply at the motivation of\nthe -- of the law enforcement officers, but the\nprosecutor and -- and who knows whether the grand jury\nwould have returned an indictment, and yet a court\ncertainly couldn't be expected to inquire into that.\nNow, so we -- we think that that's another reason why\nthe probable cause requirement is a critical gateway\nbefore a court is -- is going to enter into that\ndetermination.\nAnd all -- and it's important to remember\nit's not just proving the question of causation, but\nthese are people who are several steps removed from the\n-- from the prosecutorial decision. And the -- and the\npersonal liability would be visited on the law\nenforcement agents who were doing their job and\ncooperating with the U.S. Attorney's Office.\nThis case was -- this case got attention at\nthe highest levels of the U.S. Attorney's Office. The\nU.S. Attorney personally met with the -- the respondent\n-- lawyers for respondent.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler, the D.C.\nCircuit, looking at this case, looking at the record\nclosely, typed it one in which the evidence of\nretaliation was strong and probable cause weak. This\nis on 28a of the appendix to the petition for cert.\nThat was the appraisal of the D.C. Circuit panel. And\nI think you've been arguing that that is not the case,\nbut at least for our purposes at this posture, don't we\n-- shouldn't we accept that that is the picture here,\nweak evidence of probable cause, strong indications of\nretaliation?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I -- I don't -- I don't think\nthere's any reason to accept that because there's no\nfactual determinations to that effect.\nThere -- there are really just two snippets\nof evidence that are primarily relied upon by the court\nof appeals for the view that there was a retaliatory\nmotive here. And they were -- they were really\nobservations that the -- that the inspectors made to --\nto show -- the first one was why the corporation should\nbe indicted, not just -- not just Moore, but why the\ncorporation should be indicted. And it was just an\nobservation that the corporation, through its agents,\nwas involved in a lot of activities and should be held\naccountable. It was not -- it was not evidence of a --\nof a retaliatory motive, and there were subpoenas for\n-- for documents about political contributions. But\nlet's remember that this was a case involving bribery\nof a public official, and it was -- it was\nunderstandable that the AUSA and the -- and the\ninspectors would -- would look to see whether there was\nmoney directed elsewhere.\nIf I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of\nmy time.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. McCartan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICK F. McCARTAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. McCARTAN: Justice Stevens, if it please\nthe Court:\nIf I may, Your Honors, I would like to start\nwith the very pointed inquiry that Justice Kennedy made\nat the opening of the argument here.\nThe petitioners here do not challenge,\nbecause they cannot challenge, as was evident from the\nconcession made here this morning, that a criminal\nprosecution cannot be based upon the exercise of a\nconstitutional right. What they want is an exception\nto that rule, an exception that would mean, despite the\noverwhelming evidence of retaliation of record in this\ncase, there would be no violation of the First\nAmendment here and that would treat any prosecution\nbased solely upon race, religion, or protected speech\nthe same as a tort for malicious prosecution. And to\naccomplish this end, what they are trying to do is to\nforce probable cause as a standard into a framework\nwhere it doesn't belong, where it won't work, and\nwhich, if done here, is going to be contrary to several\nexisting decisions of this Court.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. McCartan, how does --\nhow does your standard work? The same question I asked\nMr. Kneedler. The -- the test you would propose is\nwhether but for the retaliatory motive, the prosecution\nwould have been brought anyway?\nMR. McCARTAN: That would be the test, Your\nHonor, for recovery when the matter goes to trial.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. McCARTAN: The test that I would propose\nis the very test that this Court set forth in Harlow\nagainst Fitzgerald because we're here really on a very\nlimited issue of qualified immunity. We have to\ndetermine whether the defense of qualified immunity is\navailable to the petitioners here. The standard, the\nproper standard for making that determination was set\nforth by this Court in Harlow and it's whether the\nconduct alleged --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. McCartan, I don't\nmean to interrupt you, but I thought the primary issue\nwas not the qualified immunity issue, but whether we\nhave a cause of action in the first place.\nMR. McCARTAN: Well, Your Honor, whether --\nno, I think that the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And on that, they say you\ndon't have a cause of action unless you're able to\nprove an absence of probable cause.\nMR. McCARTAN: I think what they are saying\nis the defense of qualified immunity should be\navailable if there should be probable cause for the\naction that was taken here. I think the case before\nthe Court is on the very limited issue of whether the\ndefense of qualified immunity is available to the\npetitioners.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. I think they would say\nabsolute immunity, not qualified. I -- I think they're\nsaying if there's probable cause, the game is over. No\n-- no qualified --\nMR. McCARTAN: That's exactly what they're\nsaying, and what I'm saying is that is the wrong\nstandard to be applying.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but there are two\nquestions in the cert petition and it's the second one\nthat's the qualified immunity issue, and the first one\nis whether there's a cause of action.\nMR. McCARTAN: All right. Well, Your Honor,\nlet -- let me -- let me back up for just a moment then\nwith respect to that.\nLet me say that probable cause is not the\nproper standard which should be applied here. The\nproper standard is the standard that is set forth by\nthis Court in Harlow and as refined later in Anderson\nagainst Creighton and a number of other decisions.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the difficulty I think\nwe're all having with it is that the qualified immunity\nissue and the standard to which you are -- are\nadverting responds to a question that doesn't arise\nunless we first assume that there is -- that there is a\nconstitutional violation.\nMR. McCARTAN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And our questions are, what\nis the standard for determining the constitutional\nviolation? Once we get that squared away, then we'll\nget to Harlow.\nMR. McCARTAN: The standard that is to be set\nforth to determine whether there is a constitutional\nviolation is that that this Court applied in Mt.\nHealthy City School District against Doyle and in\nCrawford-El against Britton, and that is if there is\nillegally or unconstitutionally motivated conduct, it\nwill not be excused simply because there may be some\nobjectively valid basis for taking such action. That\nis the conceptual framework that was established in\nthose cases and which should be applied by way of\nanalysis.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If it is applied here, I --\nI thought we just granted question one. There were two\nin the cert petition. I -- my notes say we just\ngranted question one. And that means what they have is\nthe screen. We're going to screen out absolutely any\nsuch claim as yours if there is probable cause.\nNow, the reason they advance for doing that\nis that in the -- a reason is in the absence of a\nscreen like that, here's what's going to happen. Every\nsingle case -- not every one, but millions of cases or\nthousands, anyway -- involving companies -- well,\ncompanies are going to Congress all the time. They\nhave ads all the time. They run into agency hostility\nall the time. The Hell's Angels? That's a pretty\nunpopular defendant. They say things all the time that\ninvestigators disagree with. And what will happen is\nin a vast number of cases the defendant will decide to\nbring a Bivens action, particularly if he gets off, and\nthen we'll have discovery and we'll look into every\nstatement that the -- the investigator made to the\nprosecutor, and before you know it, we have a nightmare\nof tort cases. And they say that's unfortunate to cut\noff a claim like yours, but after all, the prosecutors\ntotally cut them off because they have absolute\nimmunity.\nNow, we're saying at least let's restrict\nthem, where investigators are involved, to cases where\nit turned out there was no probable cause, otherwise\nthe criminal process itself will be seriously injured.\nNow, I take it that's the argument. I'd like\nto hear your reply.\nMR. McCARTAN: That is exactly the argument,\nYour Honor, and what it comes down to is whether the\nburdens of litigation in a situation of this kind will\njustify judicial alteration of the protection of the\nFirst Amendment. And I think that's been very clear\nfrom the outset in the first question Justice Kennedy\nasked.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, but are you going to --\nI mean, is there any light you could shed? And that's\nwhy I asked in my question initially. I thought maybe\nthere were some jurisdictions somewhere that -- that\nsurvive without the rule they want, but maybe I'm\nwrong. And -- and how do I judge this? I would be\nconcerned. I don't -- the -- after all, these other\ncases you mentioned are civil tort cases and -- and\nthey don't involve the criminal process. And when we\nget into criminal prosecutions, we have rules on\nselective prosecution that are designed to screen out\nall but the very worst.\nMR. McCARTAN: But see --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that's what he's arguing\nfor here.\nMR. McCARTAN: That's what he's arguing, and\nthose are not screening mechanisms, Your Honor.\nProbable cause was evident and was present in United\nStates against Armstrong and Wayte against the United\nStates. It was not deemed by this Court to be a bar to\nthe selective prosecution claims that were advanced in\nthat -- in those cases.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Leaving -- is there anything\nyou can say before I give up on this? And maybe the\nanswer is no. Is there anything you can say that would\nrelieve my concern, which is completely practical at\nthe moment, that if I decide in your favor, there\nsuddenly are going to be large numbers of criminal\ncases where defendants will say the reason I was\nprosecuted was because of something I said? I was\nadvocating motorcycles. I was advocating beating\npeople up. I was advocating a congressional change of\nsomething. Many, many such cases. They'll all get at\nleast discovery, and the prosecutor's door will become\nopen to the world. Now, that's what's concerning. Can\nyou say anything to relieve that concern?\nMR. McCARTAN: Yes. I think, first of all,\nempirically, Your Honor, there's no evidence to the\neffect that Bivens has had that result after 35 years\nin full force and effect.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But if this Court opens\nthat door, don't you think we might see a different\nproblem?\nMR. McCARTAN: I don't think so, Justice\nO'Connor. I think if you examine part IV of the\nCourt's opinion in Crawford-El, there is a very careful\npattern that is set forth as to how cases of this kind\nshould proceed and what protections are available to\nprotect Government officials against overly burdensome\nlitigation.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Which opinion was that? I\nmissed that.\nMR. McCARTAN: Pardon, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Which opinion are you\ntalking about? I missed it -- missed it.\nMR. McCARTAN: The opinion in Crawford-El\nagainst Britton.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Okay.\nMR. McCARTAN: There, the Court held that if\nthere are factually specific allegations that would\nindicate a violation of the Constitution, that at that\npoint the court may consider whether some additional\ndiscovery should be permitted even if there should be\nan independently valid basis.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This wasn't addressing --\nthis wasn't -- didn't involve prosecution, though. It\ndidn't involve unlawful prosecution.\nMR. McCARTAN: It did not, Your Honor, but it\nprovides the same --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It -- it was a suit against\na prison.\nMR. McCARTAN: It provides the same framework\nfor the proper analysis of a claim of this kind.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, but -- but we treat\nprosecutions quite differently. We do not give, for\nexample, absolute immunity to the wardens of prisons as\nwe give absolute immunity to prosecutors.\nMR. McCARTAN: That's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This is a specially\ndangerous area in which to allow litigation.\nMR. McCARTAN: It is far less dangerous, Your\nHonor, than when this is asserted by way of defense in\nthe middle of an ongoing criminal prosecution. It can\nbe far more disruptive to allege a violation of\nconstitutional rights as a defense to a criminal\nprosecution, while that prosecution is in progress, and\nan effort is made to examine prosecutorial decision-\nmaking than in an after-the-fact, after-acquittal civil\naction for damages, such as we have here. You have\nalready permitted that kind of examination in criminal\ncases where probable cause is present.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. McCartan, I -- I still\ndon't entirely understand what you would want the\nGovernment to prove under your system in order to -- in\norder to -- to win this case. They would have to prove\nwhat? That -- that --\nMR. McCARTAN: They would have to prove that\nsomething other than hostility to protected speech was\nthe reason for the prosecution being advanced.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And it would not be enough\nto show that the prosecution would have gone forward\nanyway.\nMR. McCARTAN: No. That's -- that's what I\nmean. Absent -- if there is an objectively valid basis\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. McCARTAN: -- the Government claims there\nis an objectively valid basis for the action they\naction they would take.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. McCARTAN: Then if the plaintiff has made\na showing that there was an improper motivation, the\nburden shifts to the Government to show that the\nprosecution would have proceeded absent the illicit\nintent.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You see now in -- in the\nemployment cases where -- where somebody is dismissed\nfor a -- a racially discriminatory reason and -- and\nyou have to prove that the same action would have been\ntaken anyway, you ask the person who fired them with\nthe discriminatory motive whether that person would\nhave taken that action anyway. Whereas here, the\nperson who brought the prosecution is not in this case.\nIt's somebody who gave information to the prosecutor.\nI don't know how that person could -- could possibly\nestablish that the prosecution would have been brought\nanyway. It wasn't up to him.\nMR. McCARTAN: Well, as --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It had nothing to do with --\nMR. McCARTAN: -- as -- as you pointed out\nearlier, probable cause is not the standard that\ngoverns the investigator's conduct. These\ninvestigators procured a prosecution based upon a\nviolation of the petitioner's -- or excuse me -- the\nrespondent's constitutional rights.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, they did, but wouldn't\nyou have to prove under your standard not that they\nwould have procured or tried to procure it anyway, but\nthat in fact the prosecutor would have prosecuted\nanyway? In other words, that's the distinction between\nthe -- the normal case and -- and the case that we're\ndealing with here --\nMR. McCARTAN: No, I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- with a prosecutor who has\nabsolute immunity.\nMR. McCARTAN: Well, the prosecutor has\nabsolute immunity. There's a qualified immunity here\nwith respect to the investigators, and that means that\nthe facts and circumstances of the case are going to\nhave to determine whether there's liability.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. All right --\nMR. McCARTAN: The burden would shift once\nthe illegal motivation is shown. It would shift to the\nGovernment to establish that the prosecution would have\nproceeded absent the illicit event.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But would it -- would it\nhave been a complete defense? Suppose the prosecutor,\nwho is immune, gets on the witness stand and says,\nwell, I know all about this -- the First Amendment\nstuff, but I was going to bring this prosecution anyway\nbecause it seemed to me there was a serious crime here.\nThat's all he says. Wouldn't that be the end of the\ncase?\nMR. McCARTAN: It shouldn't be the end of the\ncase. It would be an issue of causation at that\npoint, Your Honor, if there were evidence.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But -- but the question is\nthe motivation for his decision to bring the case.\nMR. McCARTAN: The motivation for his\ndecision --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And he says I -- I would\nhave brought it anyway.\nMR. McCARTAN: But in this case, the\nprosecutor's decision to bring these charges to the\ngrand jury I don't think has any probative force\nwhatsoever.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think the defendant\ncan subpoena the prosecutor?\nMR. McCARTAN: Of course.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why? I thought the\nprosecutor had absolute immunity.\nMR. McCARTAN: The prosecutor is not a\ndefendant, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You say he -- he can't be\nbrought into court to defend his own -- his own\njudgment, but he can be brought into court when -- when\nan investigator is sued in -- in order to take his\ntestimony as to what would have happened?\nMR. McCARTAN: His testimony was taken in\nthis case and can be taken in this case because at that\npoint in these proceedings -- and you have to look at\nthe evidence of record to this point in this proceeding\n-- there is very clear evidence of retaliation as a\nmotive for this prosecution.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, he may have done it\nvoluntarily here, but I find it hard to believe that he\ncould be subpoenaed, when -- when he has absolute\nimmunity from suit against himself, to testify in a\nsuit against somebody else. It seems to me a very\nstrange kind of a --\nMR. McCARTAN: Your Honor, the fact that he\nhas absolute immunity does not immunize him from giving\ntestimony in the case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So he's a witness. Suppose\nhis testimony --\nMR. McCARTAN: He's a -- he's a witness.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose that the person is\nconvicted.\nMR. McCARTAN: Suppose the person is\nconvicted.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Can you bring your\nBivens claim anyway?\nMR. McCARTAN: Well, Heck against Humphrey I\nthink would stand in the way of that, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Really? So that's a -- but\nit's not a civil case.\nMR. McCARTAN: Well, it's not a simple case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So you say that if he's\nconvicted, after all, he may have been convicted but it\nmay be because of the retaliatory motive.\nMR. McCARTAN: Well, if he is convicted and a\ncivil action for damages is then brought --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. McCARTAN: -- then I think you are in the\nframework of Heck against Humphrey --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So you -- so you\nsay --\nMR. McCARTAN: -- where the court --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- if he's convicted, that's\nthe end of it --\nMR. McCARTAN: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- whether there was a\nretaliatory motive or not.\nMR. McCARTAN: No. I think it's very\ndifficult in that case.\nIn Heck against Humphrey, which this Court\nviewed as a collateral attack on an outstanding\nconviction, the Court held that there had to be a\nfavorable termination of the criminal proceeding in\norder to maintain the civil action for damages under\nsection 1983.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, that's 1983.\nMR. McCARTAN: The Court went on to say,\nhowever, that if the civil damage action would not\nnecessarily impugn the conviction, that the case could\nproceed even though there had not been a favorable\ntermination, reversal, or expungement --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So what he does\nis he --\nMR. McCARTAN: -- of the conviction.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- he brings his action and\nhe says here I am 20 years in prison and I agree I'm\nguilty, but they never would have prosecuted me without\nthe fact that they hate the Hell's Angels and they, in\nfact, criticize everything that we say.\nMR. McCARTAN: I don't think that action\nwouldn't be permitted to proceed.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because?\nMR. McCARTAN: It would be viewed as a\ncollateral attack on an outstanding conviction.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. He's saying I was\n-- I was guilty, but the -- all right. Anyway --\nMR. McCARTAN: I -- I don't think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I won't force you into that.\nMR. McCARTAN: -- with all due respect, Your\nHonor, that's a real-world example.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'll take basically\nvirtually never if he's convicted. They concede that\nyou could bring this kind of action if there's no\nprobable cause. So we're talking about that range\nwhere there was probable cause but acquittal. That's\nwhat we're talking about here.\nMR. McCARTAN: That's right. And why\nprobable cause is not the appropriate standard is\nbecause it does not distinguish between what might be\nan unconstitutional prosecution -- that is, one based\nsolely upon race, religion, or protected speech -- and\none that is not. When you look to these earlier cases,\nYour Honor, I agree they arose in employment contexts.\nThey arose in the context of a prison.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, you're -- you're in the\ncases, but I'm -- I'm trying to pursue this. You've\ngiven me another idea --\nMR. McCARTAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- which is I would like to\nsay one word about this. I'm sorry to interrupt your\ntrain of thought here, but look.\nI'm looking for other screens. Is there --\nis there -- the particular point that they're worried\nabout is you say we want to establish the retaliatory\nmotive. That's what's worrying them because they see,\nin that establishment of the retaliatory motive,\ndiscovery, and discovery means you not only talk to the\ninvestigators, but you're also talking to, as a\nwitness, the prosecutors to find out who said what to\nwhom in order to see if you could establish that they\ndidn't like the speech of the defendant. Now, can you\ngive me any screen, not your case, but any kind of a\nscreen that will help --\nMR. McCARTAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- weed out the sheep from\nthe lambs --\nMR. McCARTAN: And I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- the goats from the sheep\nor whatever --\nMR. McCARTAN: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- in that area?\nMR. McCARTAN: -- I submit the screen is that\nset forth by this Court in Harlow, which is an\nobjective standard and which is whether the conduct\ninvolved violated a clearly established statutory or\nconstitutional right of which a reasonably prudent law\nenforcement officer or Government official should be\naware.\nThat's why I tried to say earlier this\nstandard that should govern this case is not probable\ncause, but the standard set forth by this Court in\nHarlow --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So the -- the screen, in\neffect, is --\nMR. McCARTAN: And is a screening.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- the qualified immunity\nscreen.\nMR. McCARTAN: That's right.\nAnd there was no screening mechanism in\nUnited States against Armstrong. The Court made it\nvery clear that what you were applying there were\nordinary equal protection standards.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Have there been cases where\nin the context of the prosecution, there's been a\nmotion to dismiss the prosecution because it was\nbrought in retaliation for the exercise of the First\nAmendment right?\nMR. McCARTAN: This Court has not decided\nwhat the proper remedy would be there, Your Honor. And\nthe cases --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Have there been cases in\nthe other courts?\nMR. McCARTAN: I'm not aware of any cases\nwhere that has succeeded except at the circuit court\nlevel --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but it did in the\nArmstrong --\nMR. McCARTAN: -- where the conviction has\nbeen invalidated for that reason.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But in the race context, it\nis a dismissal of the prosecution itself. Isn't it?\nMR. McCARTAN: Yes, Your Honor. It might be\nthe same here.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- with Harlow here.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: My -- my question was\ndirected to the First Amendment.\nMR. McCARTAN: For the First Amendment. No,\nI'm not aware of -- certainly no decisions of this\nCourt, and I think the only cases arise --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well -- well, surely the\nprosecution --\nMR. McCARTAN: -- in the circuit courts of\nappeals, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Surely the prosecution would\ngo ahead if there were probable cause. No? No? I\nmean, suppose it was brought up during the prosecution.\nMR. McCARTAN: Well, the question --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You mean to say if there was\n-- if there was perfect probable cause for the\nprosecution, that you can stop the prosecution in its\ntracks by -- by an allegation of the First Amendment\nviolation?\nMR. McCARTAN: You can move for dismissal of\nthe charges.\nBut look, as far back as 1886, this Court --\nthis Court found a violation of the Equal Protection\nClause in a racially motivated prosecution in a\nsituation where there was clearly probable cause and,\nindeed, overwhelming evidence of guilt for violation of\na facially neutral statute. In United States against\nArmstrong, the existence of probable cause did not\nstand as a bar to the selective prosecution claims.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But that -- that's true. I\nnow think we're making some progress. I don't think it\nis quite a qualified immunity. I think it's possible\nand don't -- I'm putting words in your mouth and deny\nthem if I am. One, he's convicted, no case. Two, no\nprobable cause, everybody agrees there's a case.\nThree, now there is probable cause, but he's acquitted.\nOkay?\nMR. McCARTAN: That's this case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: In that circumstance,\nsuppose you say we cannot even allow discovery. You\ndon't even get to discovery on your retaliatory motive\nunless you show clearly, question mark, or unless you\nshow likely, question mark, that the investigator not\nonly retaliated, but he retaliated under conditions\nwhere any reasonable person would have known that what\nhe was doing was contrary to the Constitution.\nMR. McCARTAN: Exactly, Your Honor. That --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if you don't show that\nas a -- as a threshold, you don't even get discovery.\nMR. McCARTAN: We don't -- that is exactly\nthe Harlow standard. That is exactly the standard that\nwas applied in Crawford-El against Britton as the first\nstep in the stage of developments in that case.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if you turn the Harlow\nstandard around -- I mean, you're -- you're making the\n-- the negation of the Harlow standard the screening\ndevice --\nMR. McCARTAN: Exactly.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- in Justice Breyer's\nexample.\nMR. McCARTAN: Exactly.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. McCARTAN: That's the threshold\ndetermination in a Bivens action of this kind.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. McCartan, what was the\n1887 case or 1880 --\nMR. McCARTAN: Yick Wo against Hopkins.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yick Wo.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said\nArmstrong.\nMR. McCARTAN: No, no. Armstrong --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yick Wo.\nMR. McCARTAN: -- much more recently, but\nYick Wo against Hopkins.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought it was --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let -- let me ask you this.\nSuppose the law enforcement official -- the postal\ninspectors bring the prosecution to the prosecutor\nbecause of their disagreement with his First Amendment\nviews. The prosecutor said, I don't care about the\nFirst Amendment views. I'm glad you brought this to\nme. I'm going to prosecute because there's probable\ncause here and this is a bad actor. What results?\nMR. McCARTAN: The result is that's a\nquestion of causation, Your Honor, if there is\nevidence.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's why --\nMR. McCARTAN: Yes. If there is evidence\nhere with respect to retaliation, then the question of\nwhether the independent act of the prosecutor somehow\nimmunizes that conduct is a question of fact for the\ntrier of fact in the case. If the action --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the prosecutor\nsaid, you shouldn't have brought this to me because you\n-- you're -- you're motivated by the First Amendment.\nBut now that it's here, I have my own independent\ninterest in going ahead.\nMR. McCARTAN: That's the evidence the\nGovernment can bring forward when the burden of proof\nshifts upon a showing of an illegal or unconstitutional\nmotive for bringing the prosecution to begin with.\nThat's the kind of evidence the Government would\npresent to show that the prosecution would have taken\neffect in any --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And if the burden does shift\nthat way --\nMR. McCARTAN: Exactly.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- wouldn't it be consistent\nwith the screening mechanism that Justice Breyer\nsuggested and -- and that you accepted? Wouldn't --\nwouldn't the -- the -- when the burden shifts, wouldn't\nthe obligation be on -- on the point of substance, as\nopposed to the point of -- of screening, not to show\nthat the -- that the prosecutor would have brought the\nprosecution anyway, but to show that the investigator\nwould have acted to procure that prosecution anyway?\nSo you would have parallel standards.\nMR. McCARTAN: Exactly.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. McCARTAN: Because the prosecutor has\nimmunity, cannot be a defendant in the case.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. But just -- I\njust want to nail this --\nMR. McCARTAN: No, absolutely.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- to make sure I understand\nit. So you're -- you're modifying your position of a\nminute ago in which you said the standard would be\nwould the prosecution have been brought anyway, and\nyou're now saying, which I think would be consistent\nwith your answer to Justice Breyer, the -- the question\nis would the investigators have tried to procure the\nprosecution anyway. And do I understand you correctly,\nand -- and have you changed your position?\nMR. McCARTAN: Well, I think that is a\nsignificant distinction, Your Honor, but I think we\nhave to establish that they procured the prosecution\nand that it did proceed by reasons of the illegal\nmotivation and not for some independently objective\nstandard.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right, because the\nprosecutor could have gotten a lot of other information\nfrom other people.\nMR. McCARTAN: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you're not going to\nthrow out the prosecution just because this one piece\nof information was bad.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So it's a dual --\nMR. McCARTAN: Consider too what the facts of\nrecord are here. This prosecutor was a complicit\nconduit in this action. He admitted in the presence of\na grand jury witness that he couldn't care less about\nthe guilt or innocence of these people. He just wanted\na conviction so he could obtain a lucrative position in\nprivate practice. I understand he is still a\nprosecutor at this time. But that decision of the\nprosecutor, based upon facts of that kind, has no\nprobative value whatsoever in terms of the independent\naction that might have broken the chain of causation in\na case of this kind.\nNor does the indictment of the grand jury\nhave any probative value because exculpatory evidence\nwas withheld from the grand jury. And I think in\ndetermining the value of the grand jury's action, you\nhave to really determine not only what was presented to\nthe grand jury, but also what was withheld from\nexamination.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I go back to one\nquestion Justice O'Connor asked you earlier? To what\nextent are there -- is there precedent out there in\nother courts that have decided this very issue? Are\nthere -- is there precedent for what you're asking us\nto do?\nMR. McCARTAN: There -- there is precedent in\nthe courts of appeals, Your Honor. The cases, I think,\nare cited in our brief where prosecutions have been\ninvalidated based upon violations of constitutional\nrights.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But a violation of First\nAmendment rights or --\nMR. McCARTAN: First Amendment rights. I\nthink that is the case. Not cited in our brief. But\nthere are cases to that effect.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And -- and were those cases\nin which the prosecution itself was brought to a halt,\nor were they post-prosecution damage actions?\nMR. McCARTAN: Post-prosecution. Not post-\nprosecution damage actions but appeals, direct appeals,\nto invalidate the conviction --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The conviction.\nMR. McCARTAN: -- based upon the violation --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But is there any precedent\nfor a damage action of this kind?\nMR. McCARTAN: Well, Bivens is.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but not quite.\nBivens isn't exactly like that. This is Fourth\nAmendment.\nSo is there -- is there precedent for a\ndamage action brought on the theory that the\nprosecution was brought for -- to retaliate for First\nAmendment speech?\nMR. McCARTAN: I'm not aware, Your Honor, of\nany precedents --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not either.\nMR. McCARTAN: -- in the three circuits where\nprobable cause is not a bar to an action of that kind.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, that -- that means one\nof two things: either what you're arguing for is not\ngoing to bring a flood of litigation, or everyone has\nassumed that probable cause is a -- is a requirement.\nMR. McCARTAN: Well, I think it would be the\nformer rather than the latter, Your Honor, since\nprobable cause does not distinguish between what may be\nan unconstitutional act on the part of the Government\nand one that might be motivated by a legitimate\ngrievance.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but -- but I'm not\nsure that that proposition has been established in the\ncases.\nMR. McCARTAN: No, Your Honor, and that's why\nI think this case is before this Court at this time.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Neither -- neither does\nabsolute immunity for the prosecutor distinguish\nbetween whether the prosecutor was acting just\nillegally or just acting unconstitutionally. I mean,\nyes.\nMR. McCARTAN: If I may --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You apply the same rule\nthere.\nMR. McCARTAN: I'm sorry, Your Honor. Is\nthat -- was that an observation or a question?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, well, your -- your\npoint that -- that there -- there has to be a\ndifference between whether there's a constitutional\nviolation or not in this context seems to me not well\ntaken because we don't make that distinction in the\ncontext of giving absolute immunity to the prosecutor.\nWe don't say he doesn't have absolute immunity when --\nwhen he's been guilty of a constitutional violation.\nMR. McCARTAN: But as Justice Souter brought\n-- questioned whether the prosecution was procured for\nunconstitutional reasons, the immunity of the\nprosecutor has nothing to do with the reasons for which\nthe prosecution is brought. It only protects him from\ncivil damage liability. The investigators themselves\nhave no such immunity. It is qualified.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. But the point\nremains that if in the prosecutorial context that the\nimmunity exists whether or not there's a constitutional\nviolation, then that teaches us that the same rule\nshould apply to this case. That was Justice Scalia's\n--\nMR. McCARTAN: No. I think that is the\ndifference, Your Honor, between absolute and qualified\nimmunity. The Court has given absolute immunity only\nto those functions that are so intimately associated\nwith the judicial process, that they have to give\nimmunity to those people, otherwise there would be an\nunjust interference with --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question?\nMaybe I should ask Mr. Kneedler. But am I correct in\nassuming that even if you should lose on the issue that\nwe're faced with today, the case would, nevertheless,\ngo forward because you would still seek to prove an\nabsence of probable cause?\nMR. McCARTAN: Well, certainly that would be\na question for the jury, Your Honor, absence of\nprobable cause.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but the case wouldn't\nbe over if you lose here.\nMR. McCARTAN: Well, it depends on what\nground we would lose here. If the Court went on to\ndecide the sufficiency of the allegations in a Bivens-\ntype case, which I don't think it should and which the\nCourt declined the invitation to do so in Harlow, then\nwe would not lose. If you did --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I wouldn't worry a lot about\nthat, Mr. --\nMR. McCARTAN: All right.\nMay I say one word about the tort of\nmalicious prosecution, which I say is not a proper\nanalog for the analysis of cases of this kind?\nThe interests that are protected by the First\nAmendment are far different from those that are\nremedied by the tort of malicious prosecution, and the\ninjury to which is of far greater magnitude than what\nthe common law sought to address by the tort of\nmalicious prosecution. The tort of a malicious\nprosecution tells us nothing about the interests\nprotected by the First Amendment. It remedies\ndifferent interests. It is not a proper analog and,\ntherefore, shouldn't be involved in definition of what\nthe First Amendment rights may be.\nIf you look at those cases where the Court\nhas referenced the common law in determining how\nconstitutional rights should be remedied, they have\nbeen situations where the interests protected at common\nlaw are identical to those that are protected by the\nparticular constitutional provision that is involved.\nA good example is Wilson against Arkansas, Fourth\nAmendment situation, the question of whether the knock-\nand-announce principle of common law should be\nincorporated into the reasonableness determination of\nthe Fourth Amendment. The interest protected by the\ncommon law in that situation against unreasonable\nsearches and seizures was identical to the interest\nprotected by the Fourth Amendment. For that reason,\nthe Court said that should be taken into consideration\nin determining the reasonableness of the action under\nthe Fourth Amendment.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'd like to ask you one\nother question. Suppose you win on this on the grounds\nwe've been discussing. What happens in the middle of\nthe trial when a defendant wants to say the same thing?\nCan he avoid conviction by showing the same thing?\nMR. McCARTAN: I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What happens when the same\nclaim is made in the middle of a trial that I --\nwhether I'm guilty or innocent? I haven't been\nconvicted yet, and I want to show that this prosecution\nwouldn't have been brought in the absence of the\nretaliatory motive. Can he make that claim in the\nmiddle of trial or not?\nMR. McCARTAN: Well, if he were foolish\nenough to make such a claim --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, no, he believes it.\nMR. McCARTAN: I can't believe that a\ndefendant in a criminal prosecution who is acquitted in\na subsequent civil suit --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. He's not acquitted.\nMR. McCARTAN: Oh, I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nYou say he's not acquitted.\nJUSTICE BREYER: He's in the middle of trial\nand he wants to say --\nMR. McCARTAN: Well, I don't think he'd be in\nthe middle of trial under Heck against Humphrey.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It's the criminal trial.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's a criminal trial.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The original criminal trial.\nJUSTICE BREYER: He's in a criminal trial,\nand what he wants --\nMR. McCARTAN: This is not a civil action for\ndamages.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No.\nMR. McCARTAN: This is a criminal case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: They read our opinion which\nholds in your favor. Then the next thing is in -- in\nthe criminal cases the defense lawyers say, hey, I -- I\nthink my client wouldn't be here today were it not that\nthe FBI had a retaliatory motive.\nMR. McCARTAN: That would not suffice.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because?\nMR. McCARTAN: And that was the whole purpose\nof Harlow, mere --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. They're going\nto show exactly the elements that we write in our\nopinion.\nMR. McCARTAN: If the -- if the defendant in\nthat case had established evidence tending to show the\nessential elements of the claim, it would present a\nquestion for the court, but I think the court would use\nthe admission against interest as a basis for paying no\nattention to such --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you very much, Mr.\nMcCartan.\nMr. Kneedler, you have 3 minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. KNEEDLER: Thank you, Justice Stevens.\nI'd like to respond to Justice Breyer's\nsuggestion that this could all be solved by an\napplication of the Harlow qualified immunity standard.\nWith all respect, I don't think that that would really\nwork at all because if -- if the point is that it would\nbe unconstitutional to bring a prosecution only because\nof protected First Amendment activity, that could be\ntaken as a given and still be enormous inquiry into\nwhat actually happened between the investigator and the\nprosecutor, what the real motivation was, what the\nprosecution's policies were. That is the concern we\nhave for the post hoc inquiry into the process.\nAnd not only that, it isn't just the\ndiscovery. It's what -- what consequences this will\nhave on law enforcement generally if police officers\noperate under the assumption that if the prosecution\nfails, they will be subject to civil liability, which\nis exactly what Blackstone said, as this Court quoted\nin Dinsman v. Wilkes.\nThe reason for the rule is that it would be a\nvery great discouragement to public justice if\nprosecutors, who have a tolerable ground of suspicion,\nwere liable to be sued at law whenever their\nindictments miscarried.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But we're not talking\nabout prosecutors there --\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, but -- but that included\ncomplaining witnesses. That -- that was what\nprosecutor meant at common -- at common law. And\nthere's no reason to grope for some sort of screen\nbecause the common law furnishes it. The tort of\nmalicious prosecution is what this Court relied upon in\nHeck v. Humphrey for the favorable termination rule,\nthat you could not bring a 1983 suit unless the\nconviction had been set aside and the proceeding was\nterminated in favor of the plaintiff.\nThat same tort, that tort of malicious\nprosecution, contains the probable cause requirement to\nguard against an objective screen, to guard against the\nvery thing that Blackstone was worried about and that\nthis Court noticed in -- in the Dinsman case. And that\nis, that it is important not to have law enforcement\nofficers be chilled from the important function of\nfurnishing information to prosecutors.\nAnd this Court's decision in Armstrong\nimposed an important objective test that you have to\nshow that there's somebody similarly situated before\nyou even inquire into prosecutorial motives. You have\nto show an objective factor that someone else was\nsimilarly situated. Respondent's position would offer\nno such -- no such protection.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How about the judge\ngranting a motion to quit at the close of the\nGovernment's evidence? Why isn't that objective?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Because at -- at common law --\nand I think this was an important insight. At common\nlaw, it was not even evidence of the absence of\nprobable cause because a judgment of acquittal turns on\nthe determination that a factfinder -- a reasonable\nfact finder could not find beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat the defendant had actually committed the crime.\nProbable cause is a very different standard, which is\nwhether it would lead a reasonable, cautious, prudent\nperson to believe that a crime had been committed.\nThat is the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I wasn't --\nMR. KNEEDLER: An acquittal does not --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Your opponent says -- says\nthere is no probable cause requirement. You are now on\nthere's no objective test. It's all subjective. I\nsuggest that there could be an objective test. This is\nnot going to the probable cause question. Objective\ntest? Was this case thrown out at the close of the\nGovernment's evidence?\nMR. KNEEDLER: But -- but my -- my point was\nat common law, that the wisdom of the courts was that\n-- that that wasn't even evidence of a -- that should\n-- that -- that shouldn't allow the suit to go forward\nbecause it was a sufficient guard -- protection for the\nprosecutors.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.\n"
