        "content": "[10:03 a.m.]\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Lopez versus Gonzales and\nToledo-Flores versus United States.\nMr. Long.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG, JR.\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER LOPEZ\nMR. LONG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nA drug-trafficking crime is defined in 18 U.S.\nCode Section 924(c) as any felony punishable under the\nControlled Substances Act or two other Federal statutes.\n\"Punishable\" is a key term. If that word is omitted, the\nremaining phrase, \"any felony under the Controlled\nSubstances Act,\" clearly refers to felony violations of\nthe Controlled Substances Act. The parties agree that\n\"punishable\" means \"subject to criminal sanctions.\" So, a\n\"drug-trafficking crime,\" under 924(c), is conduct that is\nsubject to being punished under the Controlled Substances\nAct.\nState felonies are not, themselves, punishable\nunder the Controlled Substances Act. It is not a Federal\ncrime to violate State law. The defendant's conduct may\nbe punishable under both Federal and State law, but a\nState felony is not a felony punishable under the\nControlled Substances Act.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, do you agree that if\nthere were a State conviction for an offense that would\nhave been punishable under the Federal law, their both\nbeing felonies, that enhancement can apply, in that\ninstance, and that that does meet the definition?\nMR. LONG: Yes, Justice Kennedy. Our position\nis, if the conduct would violate a felony provision of the\nControlled Substances Act or one of the other two Federal\nstatutes, it then is a drug-trafficking crime under 18\nU.S. Code Section 924(c), and, therefore, it is an\naggravated felony.\nBut there are three additional textual\nindications, in addition to simply the \"felony punishable\"\nlanguage, that misdemeanor offenses under the Controlled\nSubstances Act are not drug-trafficking crimes under\nSection 924(c). The first one is, there are other\nprovisions of Section 924 -- (e), (g), and (k) -- where\nCongress actually used very similar language. It referred\nto conduct punishable under the Controlled Substances Act\nor the two other statutes, or offenses under the\nControlled Substances Act or the two other Federal\nstatutes. But then, it added an express reference to\nState offenses, so --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where --\nMR. LONG: -- the implication is that when\nCongress meant to include State offenses, it said so.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where are those sections?\nMR. LONG: The -- you can find them; they're in\nthe appendix to Lopez's blue brief, Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. LONG: -- and the provisions on (e), (g),\nand (k) -- 924 begins on page 3A of the appendix, and (e)\nbegins on 5A, and you can pick up -- (g) is on 6A, (k) is\non 7A.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What are the sections -- (b)?\nMR. LONG: They're subsections (e), (g), and\n(k).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that doesn't carry\ntoo much weight, though, because the provision that -- I'm\nlooking at (g)(3), \"violates any State law relating to any\ncontrolled substance,\" can be broader than what's\npunishable under the Federal Controlled Substances --\nMR. LONG: It --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- Act.\nMR. LONG: It is a bit broader, Mr. Chief\nJustice, but if you look at all of these provisions, the\nimplication is clearly that Congress was referring to\nState law when it meant to include State law. I mean, the\n-- if you looked at (e), for example, there it's a\nparallel construction; it's not broader. I think perhaps\nthe government would say, \"Well, we're talking about\noffenses.\" That's a little different from a felony, but\n\"offenses\" is actually a broader term.\nI'll mention an additional statute, which was\nnot in the appendix -- 18 U.S. Code Section 3559(c)(2)(H).\nThis provision -- it's a similar provision; it defines a\n\"serious drug offense\" as an offense that is punishable\nunder the specific sections of the Controlled Substances\nAct, or an offense under State law that, had the offense\nbeen prosecuted in a court of the United States, would\nhave been punishable under the CSA.\nAn additional textual indication is, it's agreed\n-- and this Court has already said, in Gonzales against\nthe United States, that a drug-trafficking crime under\n924(c), under the criminal statute, must be a Federal\ncrime. 924(c)(1)(A) refers to a crime that may be\nprosecuted in a court of the United States, and that\nclearly refers to a Federal crime. The definition of\ndrug-trafficking crime, by its term, says it is for\npurposes of 924(c), so there is no reason why Congress\nwould have wanted to include State felonies in a\ndefinition that applies to a Federal criminal provision\nthat all concede applies only to Federal predicate\noffenses. And --\nJUSTICE ALITO: In --\nMR. LONG: -- the Government's interpretation\nwould significantly broaden Section 924(c) to include\nFederal misdemeanors.\nJUSTICE ALITO: In 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43)(B),\nwhat, in your view, does the first phrase, \"illicit\ntrafficking in a controlled substance,\" add to the\nreference to a drug-trafficking crime --\nMR. LONG: Justice --\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- as defined by 924(c)?\nMR. LONG: Justice Alito, in our view, \"illicit\ntrafficking\" means any offense that has a trafficking\nelement -- that is, distribution, possession with intent\nto distribute, manufacture --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But are there any trafficking\noffenses that would not fall within 924(c) if you define a\n\"trafficking offense\" that way?\nMR. LONG: Yes. They're -- most offenses under\nthe Controlled Substances Act are trafficking offenses.\nThere are a few that are simple possession. There is a\ndate-rape drug that I will not try to pronounce, but it's\nlisted in 21 U.S.C. Section --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, no, there --\nMR. LONG: -- 844.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- are possessory -- there are\n\"mere possession\" offenses that are outlawed by 924(c),\nbut is it not the case that any -- if you interpret\n\"trafficking\" to mean trafficking in the way the word\nwould be used in ordinary speech -- that any State\ntrafficking offense you can think of would have a\ncorresponding felony violation under the Controlled\nSubstances Act, so that if you read the statute that way,\nthe initial phrase is superfluous?\nMR. LONG: I believe the Government has a\nfootnote in their brief where they suggest there are some\nState trafficking offenses that actually do not have a\nparallel in Federal law. Soliciting, I think, may be one\nof them. So, I think there are, in fact, some. And our\nposition, of course, is that by adding illicit trafficking\n-- any trafficking offense, State or Federal, whether or\nnot it is punishable under the Controlled Substances Act,\nis an aggravated felony.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Let me ask the same question a\ndifferent way. If -- since 924(c) includes some \"mere\npossession\" offenses, and illicit trafficking in a\ncontrolled substance includes all violations of 924(c),\ndoesn't that show that the way Congress used \"illicit\ntrafficking in a controlled substance\" is not in the sense\nin which the term is used in ordinary speech, but's much\nbroader, so that it can include \"mere possession\"\noffenses?\nMR. LONG: The -- Justice Alito, there is an\nargument -- it's developed in the brief of the American\nBar Association -- that, because illicit trafficking is\nthe general category, that all the aggravated felonies in\nthis category should have a trafficking component; and,\ntherefore, the felonies punishable under the Controlled\nSubstances Act that are \"simple possession\" offenses\nshould not, in fact, be included. That is not an argument\nthat we have pressed in our brief. We read the phrase to\nsay \"illicit trafficking, including any felony punishable\nunder the Controlled Substances Act.\" So, I would agree\nwith you, to the extent that if it is a felony punishable\nunder the Controlled Substances Act, Congress has said, by\ndefinition, that it is included in the category of illicit\ntrafficking.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But that's ambiguous. That's\nperfectly ambiguous. Because, the case of your client, it\nis a felony, and it is punishable under the Controlled\nSubstances Act.\nMR. LONG: Well, Justice Breyer, it is a\nmisdemeanor under --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, that's --\nMR. LONG: -- the Controlled --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- right. But it is a felony\nunder South Dakota law. And what the statute says -- and\nthat's the Government's argument -- they say \"any felony\npunishable under the Controlled Substances Act.\" They\ndon't mean, necessarily, any felony punishable as a felony\nunder the Controlled Substances Act.\nMR. LONG: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It might mean anything that is\na --\nMR. LONG: But --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- felony, and --\nMR. LONG: But --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- it is also punishable; in\nwhich case, you lose. But, in the first case, you win.\nMR. LONG: But, you know --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, what am I supposed to look\nto, to decide which is --\nMR. LONG: Well, you could look to the case of\nJerome against United States, which is -- which was a\nunanimous decision of this Court -- in which the Court\nheld that the -- just the phrase \"any felony\" --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Uh-huh.\nMR. LONG: -- in the Federal bankruptcy statute\nshould be interpreted to mean any Federal felony, so --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, but you don't mean that,\nbecause you're prepared to concede -- at least I thought\nyou were, until your last argument -- you're prepared to\nconcede that if a person engages in a crime that is\npunishable as a felony under South Dakota law, and it is\nalso punishable as a felony under Federal law, under 801,\net seq, well, that counts.\nMR. LONG: Well, but, I mean, the Government --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do you --\nMR. LONG: -- accuses us --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do you concede that --\nMR. LONG: The --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- or not?\nMR. LONG: The Government accuses us of making\nthat concession --\nJustice Breyer: No, no.\nMR. LONG: -- but we --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You --\nMR. LONG: -- really don't.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- you say your answer is, you\ndon't make the concession?\nMR. LONG: We really don't. I mean, we concede\nthat if the -- I mean, 8- -- 924(c), the criminal statute,\nsays nothing about State law. It says nothing about any\nconviction under Federal or State law. It's simply a\nquestion of whether the conduct is punishable, capable of\nbeing punished, under the Controlled Substances Act --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I thought that --\nMR. LONG: -- the Federal statute.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- was the concession you made\nin response to my --\nMR. LONG: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- question.\nMR. LONG: -- yes. I -- but I just want to be\ncareful about the language in which we make --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you --\nMR. LONG: -- this concession --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- make the concession, as I\nunderstand it, because it's a Federal felony, not because\nit's a State felony --\nMR. LONG: Right.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- isn't that right? Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it --\nMR. LONG: Precisely.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it -- if this is an\nambiguous statute, do you -- what mileage do you get from\nBarrett? There is certainly an argument that what was --\nCongress was trying to do was to codify that practice of\nsaying, \"If there is analogous felony -- if there is\nanalogous crime under State law, that should be included.\"\nAnd that made good sense.\nMR. LONG: Yes. If it's ambiguous, and you look\nto the legislative history, I think we get considerable\nmileage from Barrett. The Congress was pretty clear that\nwhat it was doing was codifying Barrett. The Barrett\napproach, which was then followed by the BIA for more than\na decade, was that they would count State drug crimes, but\nonly if they were felonies under the Federal statutes,\nunder the Controlled Substances Act. So, I think we get\nconsiderable mileage out of that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You've --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- about the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- answered Justice Breyer by\nciting the Jerome case. After Jerome, we decided United\nStates vs. Gonzales, having to do with the consecutive or\nconcurrent sentencing terms. And it -- are those two\ncases in some tension? Gonzales didn't mention Jerome.\nAnd I noticed that none of the briefs mentioned it either.\nIs there some tension in the cases? And, if so, is this a\ncase where, when we write an opinion, whatever the\noutcome, we should talk about that? And, if that's so,\nwhat should we say?\nMR. LONG: I don't see any tension. Gonzales\nwas just about consecutive versus concurrent sentences\nunder State versus Federal law. I mean, the Court has\napplied that principle --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But it does --\nMR. LONG: For example, in Taylor --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- it does seem to limit the\nbroad statement in Jerome, without mentioning Jerome.\nMR. LONG: Well, but -- I mean, with respect,\nJustice Kennedy, I don't see how it limits it. And there\nhave been other cases -- Taylor is an example -- where the\nCourt adopted a single definition of \"burglary\" for\npurposes of 924(e). That applies the Jerome principle. I\nmean, it's a principle that has been applied in a number\nof this Court's cases.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But has it ever been\napplied in a -- to a statute that specifically says that\nthe term \"aggravated felony\" applies to an offense\ndescribed in this paragraph, whether in violation of\nFederal or State law?\nMR. LONG: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That would seem to me to\nbe a very express legislative repudiation of the Jerome --\nMR. LONG: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- principle.\nMR. LONG: -- when we get to that language, Mr.\nChief Justice -- and I do think it helps the analysis to\nfirst decide, What is the definition of a \"drug-\ntrafficking crime\" under 924(c), the criminal statute?\nOnce you've decided that -- now, when you move back to the\nINA, there is this language. The term \"aggravated felony\"\napplies to an offense described in 101(a)(43), whether in\nviolation of Federal or State law, or the law of a foreign\ncountry. Now, we think that's pretty straightforward. It\nhas to be an offense described. So, the simple example is\nmoney laundering. It -- the offense described in 18 U.S.\nCode Section 1956, \"money laundering,\" is an aggravated\nfelony. So, a violation of State law or of foreign law\ncan be an aggravated felony, but only if it is the offense\ndescribed in 1956. If States or a foreign government has\na broader definition of \"money laundering,\" that can't\ncount, because it's not the offense described. And when\nyou turn to a drug-trafficking crime, the way that offense\nis described in 101(A)(43) is -- Congress picked up, in\nits entirety and without any modification, the definition\nof \"drug-trafficking crime\" in 924(c), a felony punishable\nunder the Controlled Substances Act.\nSo, if you agree that, in the criminal statute,\nthat means a felony violation of the Controlled Substances\nAct, the offense described is the felonies in the\nControlled Substances Act, not the felonies in the\nmisdemeanors. And State -- if State law wants to call a\n-- something that's a misdemeanor under Federal law a\nfelony, they can do that, but they can't expand the\noffense described. The offense described, the way\nCongress did that, is --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But are you saying it would\nalso include State trafficking offense, because it's\ndescribed in the word \"trafficking\"?\nMR. LONG: Yes. I'm focusing on the definition\nof \"drug-trafficking crime.\" It -- also, there's the\nillicit trafficking piece of this. And, I should add, any\nState offense that is illicit trafficking is going to be\nan aggravated felony. We recognize that.\nIf there are no further questions, I'd like to\nreserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Long.\nMr. Crooks, we'll hear now from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY CROOKS\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER TOLEDO-FLORES\nMR. CROOKS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI would first like to address the Government's\ncontention that Mr. Toledo-Flores's appeal is moot. His\nappeal of his sentence is not moot, primarily because he\nis still subject to the sentence that is the subject of\nthat appeal. Even though Mr. Toledo-Flores was released\nfrom prison on April 21st of this year, and deported to\nMexico, he's still subject to the supervised-release\nportion of his sentence, because supervised release is not\nautomatically extinguished by deportation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But there's no\nsupervised release of people outside the United States.\nMR. CROOKS: There's no supervision of people\noutside the United States, Mr. Chief Justice, but he is\nstill subject to the jurisdiction of the District Court,\nand still subject to the conditions of supervised release\nthat are not dependent upon supervision.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, like what?\nMR. CROOKS: Well, for example, he shall not\nexcessively use alcohol, he shall not associate with\npersons who --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's going to happen\nto him if he does that?\nMR. CROOKS: If the District Court learns about\nit he could be violated -- he could be extradited back\nfrom Mexico, and he could face up to a year more in\nprison.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Has anything like that\never happened before with people subject to supervised\nrelease who are then deported? It would be the first\ntime, if the District Court did that, right?\nMR. CROOKS: There have been instances in the\ncase law where people on supervised release have been\nextradited back from foreign countries based on violations\nof their supervised release. But the point is, under the\nstatutory scheme, Mr. Toledo-Flores is still subject to\nthe District Court's jurisdiction. The District Court\nretains jurisdiction to modify his supervised release, to\nchange the conditions, or to cut the supervised release.\nIf the District Court learns of a violation and a\nviolation warrant is filed within the supervised-release\nperiod then the supervised-release period is effectively\ntolled and the District Court --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And that --\nMR. CROOKS: -- retains --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that period has how many\nmonths to run?\nMR. CROOKS: Until April 20th of next year, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you -- you said you rely\nprimarily on that argument -- do you have another\nargument?\nMR. CROOKS: Yes, we do, Your Honor. After\nApril 20th, of course, in accordance with this Court's\ndecisions in Spencer v. Kemna and Lane v. Williams, the\nCourt needs to look for a collateral consequence of the\nthen-expired sentence. And, in this case, we point to the\npossibility that a retrospective reduction in the term of\nimprisonment -- which, of course, will not give excess\nprison time back to Mr. Toledo-Flores -- but even to\nreduce the number of the sentence, on paper, could be a\nfavorable factor for him to get a waiver of\ninadmissibility, should he ever want to get a nonimmigrant\nvisa in the future to come visit his U.S.-citizen\nchildren.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We have a case involving\nstanding which says that -- you know, the doctrine of\nstanding is more than a -- an exercise in the -- in the\nconceivable. And this seems to me an exercise in the\nconceivable. Nobody thinks your client is really, you\nknow, abstaining from tequila down in Mexico because he's\non supervised release in the United States, or is going --\nis going to apply -- having been deported from the country\nfor criminal offenses, is going to apply to come back in\nthe -- these are ingenious exercises in the conceivable.\nThis is just not the real world.\nMR. CROOKS: Well, my answer to that, Justice\nScalia, is that this Court has never said that an appeal\nof a sentence may become moot before that sentence is\nexpired. And in cases like Lane v. Williams and Spencer\nv. Kemna, the sentences were completely expired, and,\ntherefore, the Court had to look for collateral\nconsequences of the now-expired sentence. Here, in\nconsequence -- in contrast, Mr. Toledo-Flores is still\nunder the sentence, which is a direct consequence --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That depends on whether you\nconsider the sentence to be effectively expired once he\nleaves the country, if the sentence is one of supervised\nrelease, which is impossible once he leaves the country.\nSupervision being impossible, supervised release is not a\nrealistic consequence of the prior conviction.\nMR. CROOKS: But that argument could be made\nwith respect to a person who is in the United States, who\nis subject to a term of probation where the only condition\nis that he not further violate the law. In that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, no, because --\nMR. CROOKS: -- instance --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- in that -- in that\ninstance, action can be taken against him if he does\nfurther violate the law under the terms of probation. The\npoint is that the jurisdiction of the probation office or\nthe District Court doesn't extend to Mexico.\nMR. CROOKS: Well, that's true. But if we're\ntalking about future violations of the law, it is very\noften the case that persons who are deported to Mexico do\ncome back, and do have their supervised release --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well --\nMR. CROOKS: -- revoked.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- you don't want to say\nthat your case is not moot because your client is going to\nviolate the law again in the future.\nMR. CROOKS: No, not at all, Your Honor, but I'm\nsaying that, in the respect that you just talked about for\nthe U.S. citizen, it's not any different, that the court\nretains jurisdiction to violate the supervised release,\nand to revoke it, and then to send him back to prison.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but it is different, in the\nrespect that he would first have to violate the law by\nentering the United States.\nMR. CROOKS: That is true. But in most cases,\nthat is the only violation of supervised release for which\nthey are later revoked. And, in that respect, it would be\nno different from a person who violates his probation by\ndriving while intoxicated or committing some other legal\nviolation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do you work in --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: On --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- this area?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: On collateral consequences,\ndo you have -- what is your best authority to say that in\n-- it would keep this case from being moot?\nMR. CROOKS: We cited, in our reply brief at\npage 4, Your Honor, the Hamdi case, United States v.\nHamdi, from the Second Circuit, where the Second Circuit\nfound that the possibility of reducing the term of\nimprisonment, even retrospectively, could have an impact\non the ability to get a waiver of inadmissibility in --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Because --\nMR. CROOKS: -- the future.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Because the length of the\nsentence counts heavily in the attorney general's\nassessment, is that --\nMR. CROOKS: That's correct, Your Honor. In\nHamdi, they pointed out that the length of the sentence\ngoes to two of the three factors that are evaluated by\nImmigration officials -- under a decision called Matter of\nHeronka -- that are used in evaluating whether a person\nshould be granted a waiver of inadmissibility in the\ndiscretion of the attorney general --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think there's a\nrealistic possibility that this person is going to be\nreadmitted? A realistic possibility?\nMR. CROOKS: I do not know, Your Honor. He's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh.\nMR. CROOKS: -- got U.S. citizen --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think there's a\nrealistic possibility he's going to try to get readmitted,\nso that he can be subjected to really enforced supervised\nrelease?\nMR. CROOKS: Well, I think that there is a\npossibility that he -- he could qualify for a nonimmigrant\nvisa at some point --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Has he applied for such a visa?\nHas he expressed any intention to apply?\nMR. CROOKS: He has not, Your Honor, but he does\nhave U.S.-citizen --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well --\nMR. CROOKS: -- children --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- then it's an exercise in the\nconceivable, it seems to me.\nMR. CROOKS: But this Court has never held that\na -- it would be unfair to hold that an appeal of a\nsentence can be moot while that sentence is still in\neffect, and when it can still have consequences for Mr.\nToledo-Flores. And that's what distinguishes this case\nfrom all the other cases decided by this Court, is that\nthe sentence itself is the concrete and continuing injury\nthat defeats --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I --\nMR. CROOKS: -- mootness in this case.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- ask this question? It's --\npresuming -- supposing we say it's not moot, and you\nprevail. Could he be resentenced without being present in\ncourt?\nMR. CROOKS: Yes, he could, Your Honor. We do\nresentencing in absentia all the time in the Southern\nDistrict of Texas --\nJUSTICE BREYER: In the Southern --\nMR. CROOKS: -- in circumstances that are\nsimilar.\nJUSTICE BREYER: In the -- have you ever heard\nof, or had, a client -- or heard of a person from Mexico\nwho had been deported because he has been involved in\ndrugs, and the Government wants to bring him back because\nhe may be a witness -- maybe something develops, some\nother members of the gang are there, they'd like his\ninformation?\nMR. CROOKS: That does happen occasionally.\nPeople are paroled, then, to testify in court proceedings\nor to cooperate with Federal --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, if --\nMR. CROOKS: -- or State --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- they pick up some friends of\nhis who are engaged in drugs, the Government might decide\nto try to get him back.\nMR. CROOKS: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is there any indication that\nthat's in the works, or is this just another conceivable\nthing?\nMR. CROOKS: There is no indication in the\nrecord --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. CROOKS: -- that that is in the work. I do\nwant to point out that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, it's conceivable, I\nguess, that people will break their parole. Often it\ndoesn't happen; sometimes it does. Sometimes they want to\nget him back; sometimes they don't.\nMR. CROOKS: That's all very true, Justice\nBreyer.\nI wanted to point out that, in Campo Serrano,\nwhich we've cited in our brief, this Court held that a\ndeported alien's probation term was a continuing criminal\nsentence that saved the case from mootness. And the Court\npointed to the fact that he -- that the deported alien in\nCampo Serrano could, just like Mr. Toledo-Flores, have his\nconditional release revoked, and he could be reimprisoned,\nupon a finding that he had violated his conditions. And\nwe believe that Campo Serrano points very strongly in the\ndirection that this case is not moot.\nOn the merits, I would just like to point out\nthat the interpretation that is advanced by the\npetitioners here promotes the very sort of uniformity that\nthis Court has found desirable in cases like Jerome v.\nUnited States and its progeny, including Taylor v. United\nStates, in that the same conduct of conviction will have\nthe same immigration and same Federal sentencing\nconsequences, irrespective of the labels or maximum prison\nterms affixed by the particular States that set out that\nconduct. And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMR. CROOKS: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Kneedler.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS\nMR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn order for a State drug offense to be an\naggravated felony under Section 1101(a)(43)(B) of the INA,\ntwo -- there are two requirements. The underlying conduct\nmust be punishable under the Controlled Substances Act or\none of the other specified Federal statutes, and it must\nbe a felony.\nBecause Petitioner's underlying conduct here was\npunishable under the Controlled Substances Act, and was a\nfelony under State law, they are -- they were properly\nfound to have committed aggravated felonies. That\nconclusion follows, not just from Section 924(c), but,\nmore importantly, by the fact that what is relevant here\nis, What is the meaning of 1101(a)(43), which is the\noperative provision, which just happens to incorporate the\ndefinition of \"drug-trafficking crime\" from 924(c)? And\nthere are three features of 1101(a)(43) with --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why don't you say \"it just\nhappens\"? I mean --\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. No. But -- no, but -- yes.\nNo, it's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- it's there in the statute.\nMR. KNEEDLER: It's -- I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's why you're here.\nMR. KNEEDLER: It expressly incorporates it,\nyes. Yes. But the -- but the operative provision is\nsection 1101(a)(43) of the INA, and there are three\nfeatures of that that we think reinforce this conclusion.\nThe first is that the consequences of aggravated felony\nstatus under the INA turn on whether one is convicted, not\nwhether they have committed the crime, and that's true\nboth with respect to the enhancement of sentences under\n1326 and the -- and the immigration consequences. And we\nthink it makes particular sense when you're talking about\na conviction to look about how the -- to look at how the\ncrime is treated under the jurisdiction of conviction.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought the Government has\ntaken the position -- and as far as I know, all the Courts\nof Appeals have bought the Government's argument -- that\nthere -- you do not need a conviction --\nMR. KNEEDLER: You do --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that so --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- not need a conviction under\nSection 924 if you're bringing a prosecution under Section\n924(c).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. You don't --\nMR. KNEEDLER: You do not -- you do not need a\nconviction. But, in order -- the immigration consequences\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- have been --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- but 924(c) is incorporated\nin 1101(a)(43). It's --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- incorporated. So, you want\nus to interpret 924(c) one way for criminal convictions --\na criminal sentence -- that is, you don't need a\nconviction in order to get the enhancement -- but another\nway for --\nMR. KNEEDLER: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- for the INA?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Our point is not that 924(c)\nrequires a conviction when it's in the Immigration Act,\nit's that the immigration consequences of that\nincorporation turn on whether someone was convicted of an\naggravated felony.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why is --\nMR. KNEEDLER: So --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, the ground of deportation\nthat refers to \"aggravated felony\" refers to someone who\nhas been convicted of an aggravated felony. The\nineligibility for cancellation of removal turns on whether\nsomeone has been convicted of an aggravated felony, and\nthe enhanced penalties under Section 1326 for someone\nwhose illegal reentry, following aggravated felony, is for\na conviction for an aggravated felony. So, my point is\nthat, under the INA, the consequences turn on conviction,\nand it makes sense to look at the jurisdiction of\nconviction -- here, State law -- to see whether it -- to\nlook at the -- to determine the status of the crime. And\nsince State law determines it to be a felony, that's the\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- proper place to look.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- if there is room for more\nthan one construction of this statute, it seems to me\nunseemly, in the immigration context, to say that two\npeople who have committed the identical acts, one of them\nis barred from ever coming back, doesn't have any of the\ndispensations, and the other does, because of the\nhappenstance of the State in which they were convicted.\nThat kind of disuniformity in an area where the\nConstitution expressly charges Congress with authority to\nmake uniform laws, it's -- doesn't that uniform-law\nspecification in the Constitution tug in the direction of\nthe interpretation that Mr. Long was --\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, we --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- presenting to us?\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- we think it does, for several\nreasons. First, with respect to the constitutional\nrequirement, the uniformity provision applies to uniform\nrules of naturalization; that is, citizenship. This --\nwe're not talking about citizenship here, we're talking --\nwe're talking about the eligibility of aliens to remain in\nthe country. Beyond that, even where the Uniformity\nClause applies -- and there's, for example, a parallel\nUniformity Clause for bankruptcy -- that's never been\ninterpreted to mean that consequences of certain conduct\nunder State law can have no impact on bankruptcy law, and\nthat there can't be a variation. The State-law homestead\nexemption under the -- under the bankruptcy laws is a good\nexample of that.\nBut, going beyond that, with respect to the\nissue of uniformity generally, Congress has established\nuniform standards in Section 1101, either in terms of\nidentifying the conduct in certain instances; in other\ninstances, by identifying the minimum sentence that was\nactually imposed. In this case, we think, with respect to\ndrug-trafficking crimes, it -- it's imposed a uniform\nstandard, in terms of the length of the sentence; it has\nto be a felony. That's -- that is uniformity.\nBut the -- to answer your point more directly,\nit is a principle throughout 1101(a)(43) that one looks to\nState law, not to -- not to a -- some supposed uniform\nstandard of Federal law. And, for example, if you --\nseveral subparagraphs -- and if you'll -- 1101(a)(43) is\nset out at page 12(a) of the appendix to our brief --\nthree subparagraphs -- (j), (q), and (t) -- refer to the\nsentence that may be imposed for a violation. Well, when\nyou're talking about a State conviction, that's clearly\nreferring to the sentence that may be imposed under State\nlaw for a conviction. Four other subparagraphs -- (f),\n(g), (r), and (s) -- turn on the sentence that was\nactually imposed. That means that -- in the case of a\nState crime, as we have here, that State law has to\nauthorize the sentence, and that the State Court, applying\nState sentencing principles, has actually imposed a crime\nof -- for -- of at least 1 year. So, it is -- it is\ninfused in Section 1101(a)(43) that, in fact, you do look\nto the consequences of an offense under State law.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm prepared to accept perfect\nambiguity here, linguistically. And I thought of an\nempirical question, that you may know the answer to, that\nmight shed some light.\nNow, going along the way -- maybe I'm making a\nmistake to point it out, if I am -- but I go to the key\nthing here, which is the words in 924(c), What is a\n\"drug-trafficking crime\"? A \"drug-trafficking crime\" is a\ncrime -- \"any felony punishable under the Controlled\nSubstances Act.\" That could mean an act, physically, that\nis a felony under some law, and is also punishable under\nthe Controlled Substances Act as a misdemeanor. Okay?\nFelony under -- it could pick that up. And it also could\nmean any conduct which is punishable as a felony under the\nControlled Substances Act. And I could look at those\nwords a thousand times and not have a clue which it means.\nSo, I thought of an empirical test. This\nstatute, 924(c), happens to be a statute that, if you\nengage in a drug-trafficking crime, as defined, and you\nhave a gun with you, you get mandatory 5 years. That's\nthe point of it. And the Government does all the\nprosecuting. So, in how many cases where a person\ncommitted a misdemeanor offense, simple possession, and\nhad a gun, did the Government insist that they get the 5-\nyears minimum? Now, if you're prepared to tell me \"a lot\nof 'em,\" I'm prepared to tell you, the Government has\nconsistently interpreted the statute the way you are now.\nBut if you're prepared to tell me \"zero,\" I would say I\nwould be suspicious of an interpretation that comes along\nnow for the first time. And my mind is open on it. I'm\nquite interested in the answer.\nMR. KNEEDLER: To my knowledge, we have not\nbrought crime -- prosecutions under 924(c)(1), based on\nthe circumstances you posit, but that's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But if --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- but I don't think that that\ngoes very far with respect to answering this question.\nFor one thing, as this Court pointed out in the Gonzales\ndecision, the requirement that there be a Federal crime,\nand, therefore, a Federal felony under 924(c)(2), comes\nfrom the language in 924(c)(1) that says that the crime\nmust be subject to prosecution in a court of the United\nStates. And this Court, in Gonzales, said it's that\nlanguage that renders the -- renders it a requirement that\nit be a Federal crime. The definition of --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. We both agree. All --\neverybody agrees here. It doesn't have to be a Federal\ncrime.\nMR. KNEEDLER: It doesn't have to be --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- under 1101 --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Correct, it doesn't have --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- to be. It could be conduct\nthat violates the State law, but -- and punish it under\nthe State law -- but the conduct involved would have to\nconstitute what is a felony under the Controlled\nSubstances --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Would have to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- Act.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- in our view, it would have to\nconstitute --\nJUSTICE BREYER: A felony or a misdemeanor.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- it would have to be punishable\nunder the Controlled Substances --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- Act.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But the important point here is\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, I say it's\nsuspicious.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But the question is not what\n924(c)(2) means, standing alone or in the abstract; it's\nwhat it means, as incorporated into 1101(a)(43). And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And, of --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- there --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- course, that's --\nwhen you get to that, it must give you pause that your\nanalysis is of a term, \"drug-trafficking crime\" or\n\"illicit trafficking,\" and your theory leads to the\nconclusion that simple possession equates with drug\ntrafficking.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, the Petitioner has\nconceded, as I understand it -- I heard Mr. Long, I think,\nconcede -- that possession offenses can constitute\naggravated felonies under this provision, that there is\nthe recidivist possession, there is the possession of the\ndate-rape drug, there is possession of 5 grams or more of\ncocaine. All of those are specified as being -- of being\nfelonies under the -- under 940 -- or 844. But, beyond\nthat, it's important to take into account that a lot of\nState statutes dealing with drugs do not -- are not\npatterned directly after the Federal statute, and there's\nno reason why Congress would have insisted that they do so\nin order for this statute to operate sensibly. And one\nnotable example, for instance, is, when it comes to\npossession of a substantial amount of drugs, that that\ncertainly would create a strong implication that the\ndefendant was engaged in trafficking activities, or\nintended to.\nThe Federal statute deals with that by making it\na felony to possess with intent to distribute the drug. A\nnumber of States don't do that. They, instead, have\ngraduated possession offenses, based on the quantity of\ndrugs that the defendant is possessing; that above a\ncertain quantity of drugs, it would be a felony. They're\ngetting at the same problem, but they've come at it in a\ndifferent way.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then, in those cases, you can\nsay the conduct would constitute a felony under the\nFederal statute; but here, if I recall correctly, the\namount involved would not have qualified for possession\nwith intent to distribute, under Federal law.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, it would always be up to\nthe jury to decide that. Now, in Mr. Lopez's case, he was\n-- he was initially charged with a series of offenses that\nwent beyond the aiding and abetting of possession that he\nultimately pleaded guilty to, but, as he testified in his\n-- in his immigration hearing, his aiding and abetting of\npossession was assisting someone in purchasing drugs,\nwhich was, itself, a trafficking element. And so, this\nshows that the way the State crimes are defined or applied\nare often getting at what Federal law --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. We have a case in which\nwe're assuming, for our purposes, we just have possession.\nI mean, I understand the facts of this case. And I wanted\nto ask -- I have two questions, Mr. Kneedler. One of them\n-- the second one, I'd ask that -- you were going to\nmention three different points, one about conviction; you\nhad two other points you didn't get to. I want to learn\nwhat those were. But, before that, it seems to me that,\nwhen you put the whole statute -- all the -- all the\ndifferent statutory provisions together, you really boil\ndown and focus on 924(c)(2) and the words \"for purpose of\nthis subsection, the term 'drug-trafficking crime' means\nany felony punishable under the Controlled Substances\nAct.\" And if the word \"Federal\" had been inserted before\nthe word \"felony\" in the statute, would that not make the\nstatute perfectly clear?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It probably would, but I think\nit's interesting that the version of 924(c) that was in\neffect prior to 1988 said exactly that. It said \"felony\nviolation of Federal law.\"\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It was a question of --\nMR. KNEEDLER: It was -- it was explicit.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- whether the change was\nintended to be --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, but --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- substantive --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- Congress --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- or merely --\nMR. KNEEDLER: But --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- stylistic.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- Congress did change it, in the\n1988 Act, but it did it -- and this is significant -- it\ndid it in connection with two changes in the immigration\nlaw. One is the enactment of the definition of\n\"aggravated felony,\" which, as I have explained, the\ndefinition of \"aggravated felony\" looks to State law, in a\nnumber of respects, in terms of the severity of the\noffense or the punishment actually imposed. That was one\nchange.\nThe other change that was made in the 1988 Act\nwas to amend Section 1326 with respect to illegal\nreentries, and it did that by enhancing the penalty for\nconviction of any felony other than an aggravated felony,\nand an aggravated felony. And certainly the conviction of\nany felony includes State law offenses in this --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Just again, Mr. Kneedler --\nfocusing again on that specific language, you're saying,\nin effect, that that phrase means any State or Federal\nfelony punishable under the Federal statutes.\nMR. KNEEDLER: It says -- yes, it says \"any\nfelony.\" And that is our -- doing it -- and what --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And is it ever true that a\nState felony is punishable under a Federal statute?\nMR. KNEEDLER: The conduct is --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, I know, but --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- punishable. The conduct is\npunishable, not --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- but do you know of any\ninstance where we've said a State felony is punishable\nunder a Federal statute?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think not -- I think not used\nin that sense, but I think it's important -- it's\nimportant to look at the language, as a whole. It does\nnot say \"punishable as a felony under\" --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you do agree --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- \"under the Controlled\" --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- that the key to the case is\nhow we read that one sentence.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, no, I agree that the -- I --\nin my view, the key to the case is in 1101(a)(43),\nbecause, if you look at the structure of 1101(a)(43) --\nand this gets to the question you -- you said -- you\nmentioned that I had three reasons. One is that under the\n-- under the INA, the conviction consequences turn on the\nconviction of an aggravated felony, and it only makes\nsense to look at the jurisdiction of conviction to\ndetermine the nature of the crime, whether it's a felony.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but you don't -- you\ndon't look to the jurisdiction of conviction. Are you\ntelling me you require a conviction? You -- I thought you\ntold me you don't require a conviction.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. Under 924(c), you don't.\nBut under the -- under the -- if you're bringing a Federal\nprosecution under 924(c), the term \"aggravated felony\" has\nno role in that determination. It is a -- it is a\nseparate Federal crime. We're talking about, here, the\nconsequences of -- the consequences of being an aggravated\nfelon under 1101(a)(43) are, Where does the definition of\n\"aggravated felony\" apply? It only applies under the INA\nif someone has been convicted of an aggravated felony.\nYou're only -- you're only subject to deportation for\naggravated felony if you've been convicted, you're\nineligible for cancellation or removal, you're subject to\nsentence enhancement. All those things follow on\nconviction. And we think it only makes sense to look to\nthe jurisdiction of conviction. That is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right, Mr. Kneedler,\nassuming that -- as I understand it, the answer you just\ngave, your second point, as well as the point that you and\nJustice Stevens were debating, turns, in your view, on a\ndefinition, or a reading, of the statute that would work\nthis way: that if, under State law, the act were a felony,\nbut, under Federal law, the action was merely a\nmisdemeanor, it would still, for purposes of this\ndefinition, be an aggravated felony.\nMR. KNEEDLER: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That -- isn't that very\nstrange, that Congress would have wanted a reading of the\nstatute that would turn its definition of a \"misdemeanor\ncrime\" into an aggravated felony for purposes of the\nimmigration law?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I don't think so at all. And for\none -- for one thing -- as I've mentioned, the structure\nof the act, as a whole, of 1101(a)(43) -- and there are\nnumerous subsections -- look to how the crime -- what the\nauthorized punishment was, or look to how the person was\nactually sentenced under State law, not under Federal law.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but I'm --\nMR. KNEEDLER: And I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- saying, if --\nMR. KNEEDLER: No -- I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, go ahead.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I also haven't mentioned the\nexplicit provision, that one of the other Justices\nmentioned earlier -- I think, the Chief Justice -- that\nthe penultimate sentence of 1101(a)(43) says that\nsomething -- a -- an offense constitutes an aggravated\nfelony, whether in violation of Federal or State laws.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well --\nMR. KNEEDLER: So --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- I know it says that, but\nthat doesn't necessarily take you any further than saying\nthat if the words of the statute refer to something that\ncould be a State law felony, under the -- under the\npenultimate sentence, it will count. It does not\nnecessarily answer the question that we have, and that is\nwhether a particular reference in the statute is a\nreference to a Federal felony or a State felony. So, it\nhas a -- the penultimate sentence has work to do. And, in\nfact, we can see the work being done in the -- in the very\ndefinition of \"drug trafficking\" -- but it doesn't\nnecessarily lead to the conclusion that you draw from it.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, we think -- we think it is\nquite a -- we think it's a strong confirmation of the\npattern in 1101(a)(43), that the statute looks to what\nhappened in State Court, and the State punishment that was\nauthorized there, and the express mention of that -- or --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Even when --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- requirement.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- the consequence, in effect,\nis to turn for -- turn the gravity of the Federal\nmisdemeanor into the gravity of --\nMR. KNEEDLER: But the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- a felony that --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- the Federal Controlled --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- just happens to be a State\nfelony.\nMR. KNEEDLER: The Federal Controlled Substances\nAct does not occupy the field of drug control in the\ncountry, any more than any other Federal crime occupies\nthat field. And --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, I realize that. But, if\nwe're asking, \"What is important in the mind of Congress,\nfor purposes of the immigration law?\" one would suppose\nthat the most obvious touchstone of importance is the way\nFederal law deals with it -- i.e., in the case of a crime,\nwhether Federal law calls it a felony or Federal law calls\nit a misdemeanor. You know, in your reading, when Federal\nlaw calls it a misdemeanor, if State law calls it a\nfelony, it becomes a Federal felony for the immigration\nlaw. And that's what seems to me odd.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right. And this is not the only\nplace where that consequence can arise. There are --\nthere are cases involving \"What's a crime of violence?\"\nwhich is -- which, under subparagraph (g), is another\naggravated felony. The crime of violence is defined in 18\nU.S.C. Section 16, subsection (b) of that -- this Court\nconsidered that statute in Leocal -- requires that the\noffense be a felony which creates a serious risk of\nphysical harm. The courts have looked to the State law of\nconviction to determine whether something is a felony --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Kneedler, could --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- under that provision.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I just ask one --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Sure.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It's one thing to turn to State\nlaw to get an answer where there is no other answer. The\nproblem here is that State law and Federal law are at odds\nin determining the gravity of the offense. The Federal\nlaw, on my hypothesis, would say, \"It is minor; it's just\na misdemeanor.\" The State says, \"No, it is a felony.\" It\nseems to me very odd, given the tension between the State\nand Federal classifications, to say that, for Federal\npurposes, the State classification is going to trump the\nFederal classification; and that's a different situation\nfrom the one you posit.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, and -- if I could just\nmention one other -- on other example, under the theft-\noffense category in subsection -- I think it's (f) --\nwhere a theft offense is deemed to be an aggravated felony\nif a sentence of at least 1 year was imposed. There are\nmisdemeanor offenses there that -- as a matter of Federal\nlaw, it can be a misdemeanor for certain types of theft\noffenses; and yet, they are covered as aggravated\nfelonies. And, again, that would --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Kneedler, could I ask you\nabout your assertion that you \"look to the State of\nconviction\"? What do you mean by that? For purposes of\n1101. Does that mean, if you're convicted, in State\ncourt, of a misdemeanor -- and even though that action\nwould be a Federal felony, it's not an aggravated felony?\nMR. KNEEDLER: That is our position, yes.\nBecause the requirement -- the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, it's sort of a double\ninconsistency. Not only do you treat State -- State\nactions that are -- that are minimal -- I'm sorry, where\nthe State treats it more seriously than the Federal\nGovernment, not only do you follow the State, but, where\nthe State treats it less leniently than the Federal\nGovernment, you also follow the State.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that right?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. And we -- yes. We think\nthat's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, you look to the State of\nconviction. What --\nMR. KNEEDLER: that's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's for purposes of the\nimmigration law.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Of the immigration law. And,\nagain, we think that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. Now, do you do the same\nfor purposes of the felony enhancement provision?\nMR. KNEEDLER: 924(c)? No, you don't, because --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- the aggravated-felony question\nhas no -- has no -- the \"aggravated felony\" term has no\noperative significance under 924 --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that seems to me --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- itself.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- very strange. You would\nlook to the -- you would look to the State law for\npurposes of the immigration section; but, for purposes of\n924(c), what would you look to? Either one. Either one.\nWhichever --\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, 924 --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- whichever -- for 924 --\nwhichever one would make it a felony.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, under --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You lose.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- under 924(c)(1), this Court --\nthis Court, in the Gonzales case, said that it -- that it\nhas to be a Federal crime, but not because of the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- definition in --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- 924(c)(2) --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If it's a felony under either\none, for purposes of 924(c), you lose, right?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I don't think I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If the act is either a State\nfelony or a Federal felony, you lose. I mean, the\ndefendant gets the enhanced sentence, right, under 924(c)?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Under 924(c), the cases that have\nbeen brought have all been situations where it is a\nFederal offense. But, because -- not because of the\nlanguage in 924(c)(2) --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- but because of the -- of the\nlanguage --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Listen.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- in 924(c)(1).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Listen. My question is a\nsimple one. If it's -- it seems to me, if it's -- what\nyou're saying is, if it is either a felony under Federal\nlaw or a felony under State law, you get the enhanced\nsentence under 924(c), isn't that right?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I -- my understanding of the way\n924(c)(1) has operated is that if it is a misdemeanor\nunder Federal law, but maybe it would be a Federal felony,\nit would not be -- it would not give rise to the\nenhancement, because it is not a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that's --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- it --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- what the whole argument is\nabout, whether it has to be a felony under Federal law.\nYou're telling me, if it's a misdemeanor under Federal\nlaw, that you don't get --\nMR. KNEEDLER: But not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- the enhanced sentence?\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- but not under -- not under\n924(c)(2) --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But why not?\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- the definitional --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You've thoroughly confused me\nnow.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But 924(c)(1) says that if you\nhave a gun, and you have a drug-trafficking crime, book, 5\nyears.\nOkay, now we go to two, what's a \"drug-\ntrafficking crime\"? It means any felony punishable under\nthe -- under the Controlled Substances Act. Now, in your\ndefinition, we first look to see whether simple possession\nis punishable under the -- in Controlled Substances Act.\nIt sure is. It sure is. It's punishable as a\nmisdemeanor. So, it meets that. Under your definition,\nis it a felony? Yup, it's a felony in South Dakota.\nOkay. So, now we've got a prosecution, in Federal Court\nin South Dakota. And, on your reading of the statute,\nthat guy should get a bump-up of 5 years.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, that is not our reading of\nthe statute. The --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because?\nMR. KNEEDLER: The only thing that is\nincorporated into 1101(a)(43) is the definition in (c)(2)\n-- not (c)(1), the definition of --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- of \"drug-trafficking crime\" in\n(c)(2), which says --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- \"felony punishable under the\nControlled\" --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- \"Substances Act.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right.\nMR. KNEEDLER: That is what gets plugged into --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's correct.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- 1101(a)- --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- -(43).\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Along with all of the other\nprovisions in 1101(a)(43), you look to State law, in the\ncase of a State offense -- the State of conviction, the\njurisdiction --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- of conviction -- to determine\nthe nature of the crime.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But you still have to know\nwhether that word, \"felony,\" in (2) means \"any felony\npunishable as a felony under the Controlled\" --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right. And --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- \"Substances Act.\"\nMR. KNEEDLER: And --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And there --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- a number --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah. You have to know the\nanswer to that.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- a number of Courts of Appeals\nthat have looked at this in the sentencing context over\nthe years have concluded that it -- that the absence of\nthat language is very significant, and the presence of the\nlanguage that says \"any felony\" is also significant.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Never mind sentencing, let's\nget back to the immigration. If I understand what you're\nnow saying, if you're convicted in State Court of action\nthat is a Federal felony, but it's just a State\nmisdemeanor -- right? -- you look to the State of\nconviction, and it would be a misdemeanor, and the\nimmigration provisions would not -- would not take effect.\nIs --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that right?\nMR. KNEEDLER: And that -- and that -- that's\nnot true --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's extraordinary.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, but it's -- that's not --\nonly true under this provision of 1101(a)(4). The other\n-- the other provisions -- (f) and (g) and (j) and (q) and\n(t) that I mentioned, that looked to the sentence that may\nbe imposed under State law, or that was actually imposed\n-- would, likewise, render someone in that situation who\nwas convicted of only a misdemeanor in State Court -- even\nthough it might be a felony under Federal law, they would\nnot be -- they would not be convicted of an aggravated\nfelony, because --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- of the way Congress chose to\nwrite 1101(a)(43).\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- that a reasonable -- let's\nsay the statute's ambiguous, and you've convinced us\nthere's no constitutional requirement of uniformity. But\nis it reasonable to assume that Congress would want the\ndifferent consequences to depend on the State of\nconviction?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think it is. I mean, they're\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is there anything in the\nlegislative history suggesting that?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think -- as I say, I think it's\non face of the statute.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Barrett suggests otherwise.\nIf what Congress was trying to do was to codify that\npractice of looking for an analogous crime under State\nlaw, that's -- that seems to me the -- at least what\nCongress was trying do.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, that -- the legislative\nhistory of the amendment in 1990 does not discuss the\naspect of Barrett that went to the comparison to decide\nwhat -- in what circumstances there would be an analogous\nFederal crime. It was clear that it wanted to ratify the\nresult that State crimes are covered.\nBut we think that that was evident from the 1988\namendments to -- that both enacted the definition of\n\"aggravated felony,\" revised the definition of \"drug-\ntrafficking crime\" to delete the requirement that it be a\nFederal felony -- that was deleted in 1988 -- and enhanced\nsentences --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- under 1326, clearly on the --\non -- by reference to whether someone was convicted of a\nState felony, without any -- without any general Federal\nminimum.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I --\nMR. KNEEDLER: What Congress --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I just switch gears for a\nmoment, because your time is almost up, and we -- you\nhaven't addressed the mootness problem in Toledo-Flores.\nMR. KNEEDLER: In Toledo-Flores.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is the Second Circuit wrong\nin U.S. v. Hamdi? Because it seems to me that U.S. v.\nHamdi is on all fours with respect to mootness.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. We think it is wrong, be --\nunder this Court's decision in Spencer versus Kemna and\nother cases, that, if the possible consequence turns on a\ndiscretionary judgment that may be made by someone else,\nthat is too speculative to constitute a real live case or\ncontroversy. And that's what I understand Toledo-Flores\nto be arguing, is that if he applied for discretionary\nrelief in the future, that it might -- it might matter,\nbecause his sentence might be reduced slightly.\nI should point out that in the District Court\nToledo-Flores conceded that if he didn't get an eight-\nlevel sentence enhancement, he would get a four-level\nsentence enhancement, because this is at least a felony,\nwithin the meaning of the adjacent provision of the\nguidelines. That would result in a guideline range of 24\nto 30 months. He would then have gotten 24 months, under\nthat guideline range, the very same thing that he got\nhere. And, under the guidelines at the time, a term of\nsupervised release was mandatory. And a 1-year term of\nsupervised release was mandatory in those circumstances.\nHe would have gotten exactly the same term of supervised\nrelease if he had been -- if he had gotten only the four-\nlevel enhancement, rather than the eight-level\nenhancement.\nI also think that it is somewhat farfetched to\nthink that, given the fact that Toledo-Flores had more\nthan 12 illegal entries into the United States, and\nvarious State offenses, that the determination of whether\nthe attorney general would actually grant discretionary\nrelief would turn on a marginal difference in the sentence\non that particular offense.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.\nMr. Long, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG, JR.\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER LOPEZ\nMR. LONG: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nIn answer to Justice Breyer's question, Mr.\nKneedler said that a Federal misdemeanor is a drug-\ntrafficking crime under Section 924(c) if a State punishes\nit as a felony. He said, \"Well, the Federal Government\nnever prosecutes Federal misdemeanors under Section\n924(c).\" He said, \"The reason is because of\n924(c)(1)(A),\" and the language there is, it has to be an\noffense for which the person may be prosecuted in a court\nof the United States. But that language -- a person may\nbe prosecuted in a court of the United States for a\nmisdemeanor. So, the Government is making an argument\nthat, to my knowledge, has never been accepted by any\ncourt, has not ever been advanced by the Government in a\ncriminal context, and that would significantly expand\nSection 924(c) and numerous other criminal statutes that\nwe cite in our brief that used the same definition of\n\"drug-trafficking crime.\"\nThe -- Mr. Kneedler also said that the\naggravated felony provisions in Section 101(a)(43) refer\nto State law, but I read them just the opposite. There\nare two kinds. There are 21 of them. Many of them say,\n\"an offense described in 18 U.S. Code Section X.\" I mean,\nthat's really what -- we're dealing with one of those\nhere. So, it clearly goes to Federal law to define the\noffense. Now, if State law or foreign law also punishes\nthat offense, then it's an aggravated felony, but,\nclearly, Federal law is defining the offense.\nThere are other categories, such as murder and\ntheft, that are defined, in general terms; but the\nGovernment's position, as I understand it, is, again, you\nuse a generic uniform definition. You don't pick any\ndefinition that the States may have. The Court just\ngranted --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought -- I\nthought you conceded that a State offense could constitute\nillicit trafficking --\nMR. LONG: Well, yes --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- in a Controlled\nSubstance --\nMR. LONG: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. But, again,\nto be clear -- and I think this is consistent with the\nGovernment's position in other cases -- ultimately, there\nwill be some uniform Federal definition of what\nconstitutes illicit trafficking. It would be -- some\ncommercial element would probably be the definition the\nCourt hasn't decided. States can define it more broadly.\nBut the actual definition -- just as the definition of\n\"burglary\" or \"theft\" --\nJUSTICE ALITO: You think there's a uniform\nFederal definition of a theft offense?\nMR. LONG: Well, it's -- I mean, as -- this --\nin the Taylor case, in burglary, the Court has a\nmethodology for this. You pick a sort of generic\ndefinition. It may not -- it may not come from a Federal\nstatute; it could --\nJUSTICE ALITO: There's -- they'll -- there's no\nvariation in State offenses that would fall within that, a\ntheft offense?\nMR. LONG: Well, it's -- again, this is -- the\nprovision we're dealing with is -- looks to Federal law,\nthe Controlled Substances Act and two other statutes. My\nunderstanding of the Government's position -- and it's\nconsistent with this Court's cases, in Taylor -- is that,\neven when it's a generic offense, you would -- you would\nstill have a uniform definition. And that is certainly\nconsistent with the principle of uniformity that applies\nboth in criminal law and in immigration law. I mean, if\nthere's any ambiguity, at the end of the day, ambiguities\nare supposed to be resolved in favor of uniformity,\nuniform Federal law -- uniform Federal criminal law, and\nuniform immigration law. Effectively, what the Government\nis arguing that -- is that States can banish noncitizens,\nand can do so by enacting drug laws, deciding to make a\nsimple possession offense a felony. That's a decision\nthat a State would make, almost certainly, for reasons\nthat have little or nothing to do with immigration, and\nit's highly unlikely that Congress would have left that\ndetermination to States.\nOn uniformity, aggravated felonies is a\ncondition for citizenship. If you're convicted of an\naggravated felony, you may not become a U.S. citizen. You\nare foreclosed from establishing good moral character.\nSo, in fact, citizenship is at stake here, and the\nUniformity Clause is in play.\nIf there are no further questions, thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Long.\n"
