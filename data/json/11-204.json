        "content": "(10:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nthis morning in Case 11-204, Christopher v. SmithKline\nBeecham.\nMr. Goldstein.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, may it\nplease the Court:\nIn the Fair Labor Standards Act, Congress\ndirected the Secretary of Labor to quote/unquote \"define\nand delimit\" the statute's outside salesman exemption.\nBy regulation, the Secretary provided that an outside\nsalesman is one who makes sales rather than promoting\nsales by others. In further guidance, the Secretary\nelaborated that nonexempt promotion includes either,\none, a conversation where there can be no commitment or,\ntwo, one where there will be no exchange with the\nemployer.\nNow, everyone agrees that a pharmaceutical\ndetailer engages in promotion. They tout drugs to\ndoctors. Everyone agrees that there can't be a\ncommitment to issue a prescription. Everyone agrees\nthat a prescription is not an exchange with a\npharmaceutical company. But nonetheless, the Respondent\nargues that pharmaceutical detailers sell drugs directly\nto doctors as a matter of law. They say that follows\nfrom the fact that the Secretary's regulation\nincorporates the definition of \"sale\" in the FLSA, which\nis in the blue brief in the appendix at page 1.\nThat definition, which is section 203(k),\nprovides -- it's the second provision on the page --\n\"'sale' or 'sell' includes any sale, exchange, contract\nto sell, consignment for sale, shipment for sale, or\nother disposition.\" And what you will not find in that\nlanguage is anything that contradicts the two points the\nSecretary has made, which is that there has to be a\ncommitment or that, at the very least, there has to be\nan exchange with the employer.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, is that consistent\nwith the Government's argument? They argue, quote, \"an\nemployee does not make a 'sale' for purposes of the\n'outside salesman' exemption unless he actually\ntransfers title to the property at issue.\" The statute\nrefers to a consignment for sale. When that occurs,\ndoes -- does the consignor actually transfer title to\nthe property at issue?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It is an arrangement for\ntransfer of title, and that's why it's critical that it\nsays a consignment for sale, the sale being the transfer\nof title. But in all events, this case is not a fight\nabout transferring title or some lesser form of\nexchange, because there's no exchange between the doctor\nand the --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I understand that, but I\nwould appreciate an answer --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- to my question.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is the Government's position\nconsistent with the reference to consignment for sale?\nWhen a consignment for sale occurs, is there a transfer\nof title?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: There is an agreement for a\ntransfer of title, and I believe there --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is there a -- a transfer of\ntitle?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I apologize. There is not a\ntransfer of title, but there is an agreement for a\ntransfer of title. They -- just to be clear, the\nGovernment says the definition of \"sale\" includes a\ntransfer of title. And so, all I'm pointing out, if I\ncould just go back to the definition -- I apologize for\nnot answering --\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, no, I understand. I\nunderstand your position to be different from theirs.\nBut I --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Oh, no --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Perhaps I should ask them\nabout -- about their position.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure. Well, I apologize if\nI've created some --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. I -- I don't\nagree that there's an agreement for transfer of title.\nWhere there's a consignment, you give the property to\nsomebody, and he says I will sell it to somebody if\nsomebody will buy it.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There is no agreement to\ntransfer title.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: There is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's purely a future\ncontingency. If someone will buy it, I will sell\nthem -- sell it to that person on your account.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. I believe -- I will\nallow you -- I apologize saying \"I will allow you.\"\nThe --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It would be -- you can do, I\nknow, whatever you want.\nThe Government can explain it --\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, not really, but\nanyway, go ahead.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. All right. It is --\nthe statute refers to a consignment for sale. I believe\nthey're defining a sale in that phrase. But in all\nevents, the debate over whether it includes or is\nlimited to a transfer of title is not at issue in this\ncase, because what the -- because all the statute\nrequires is that there, at the very least, be some\nexchange of some part. There's going to be an -- a\nbinding agreement, a commitment, and that commitment\nwill involve an exchange with the employer. What\nhappens in pharmaceutical detailing is that there can't\nbe any commitment to issue a prescription at all --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Because -- because the\nlimitation on sale is they can't sell -- by Federal law,\nthey can't sell. And you -- you are debating about\nexchange, sale. What strikes one about this case is\nthat these are workers -- they work autonomously. They\ndon't clock in and out. They work outside the\nworkplace. After they're trained, they have minimal\nsupervision.\nIs there any other category of exempt\nworkers that have that kind of autonomy and yet come\nunder the wage and hours law?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I'm sorry. So, your premise\nis that they are exempt to begin with? There -- I can\ntell you that there are a large number of employees who\ndo work outside the workplace and are substantially more\nautonomous than are pharmaceutical detailers, who have\nto operate from very strict scripts. There are -- it's\nliterally --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: For example, what are\nthe -- that's what I wanted to know. What are the\ncategories of people that seem to be autonomous, not the\ntype that clocks in and out?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure. Well, you can have\nemergency service workers that are working outside.\nThere are lots of people -- so, for example, you may\nwell --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- I don't\nunderstand what that is.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I apologize.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's an emergency service\nworker?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: A police officer or a\nfireman, an ambulance driver. They are constantly\noutside the office. You can also have lots of different\nkinds of promotion --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. They're not on\nduty all the time. Aren't -- don't they have hours of\nduty? My goodness. Some of them make enormous overtime\nwages because they've put in hours beyond their regular\nhours of duty --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, that -- my --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: These people have no hours\nof duty.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That is not quite right,\nJustice Scalia. They are expected -- the joint appendix\nexplains -- to be in the doctors' offices between 8:30\nand 5:00 p.m. They work additional time. The fact\nthat --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, doesn't that\njust -- I mean, that's when the doctors are there.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That's -- but that is when\nthey are supposed to be in the doctors' offices. That's\ndictated by the company.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about -- what about\nthe extras? I mean, we're told that part of this job is\nto have a good relationship with the doctors. It\nincludes dinners. It may be conventions.\nEntertainment, maybe golf. If -- if you're right, would\nthe time on the golf course get time and a half?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, a couple things about\nthat, Justice Ginsburg.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: There actually are very\nstrict restrictions. That kind of activity is under the\nPhRMA Code, which is trying to interpret Federal law, is\nactually very heavily restricted. But whatever it is\nthat the employee is doing to further the employment\nrelationship is going to be hours on duty. It is really\nimportant I think that while it is true that a\npharmaceutical detailer has many of the characteristics\nof an outside salesman, the one they don't have is\nselling.\nAnd that is the line that Congress drew.\nIt --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You were -- you were\ngiving examples, and we just stopped at --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- emergency service\nworker. But you said there are many examples --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- of people who are\nhighly autonomous and still come under the hours\nregulation.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure. Another example would\nbe insurance adjusters. There are people who are\noutside cleaning people that are not -- that don't have\nany --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And these are all -- these\nare all within the Fair Labor Standards Act?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. Yes, Justice Kennedy,\nthey absolutely are.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there any occupations\nor pursuits that are not covered by the Fair Labor\nStandards Act because -- on the rationale that they are\nout, that they are unsupervised, and so forth. In other\nwords, if you were arguing the case of the Respondent,\nwould you -- would you have any close analogies to areas\nthat are not -- that are exempt; in other words, they\nwouldn't be salesmen, but there'd be some other\nclassifications to fit them in?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I would, but they would all\nbe one of two things. They would either fall within the\nadministrative exemption, which is, Justice Ginsburg,\nwhat is -- Congress was talking about when it talked about\npeople who have a lot of autonomy, and which is not true\nof detailers -- or some other exemption. So, to give an\nexample, certain outside buyers are exempt under the\nFair Labor Standards Act. A good -- that's a good\nexample, because if you're an outside buyer of poultry,\nthen you are exempt, but if you are an outside buyer of\nmeat, you aren't.\nIt is one of a lot of different places --\nthere are 50-some exemptions from the Fair Labor\nStandards Act. And Congress drew incredibly fine lines.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Congress can draw -- draw\neven silly lines.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If Congress draws it, it's\na line. But the line you're suggesting here -- both\nyour brief and the Government's, as I recall, say, my\ngoodness, if we find for the Respondent here, there'll\nbe so much uncertainty in the future. I'm not sure\nthere isn't a lot of uncertainty if we -- if we find in\nyour direction.\nNow, let me give you an example. One of my\nlaw clerks -- my law clerks supplement my sparse life\nexperience.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: One of my law clerks is\nfamiliar with the -- the framing business. Okay? Now,\nsalesmen of frames do not sell the frames at the time\nthat they visit the -- the framing company or the\nframing store. They get a commitment that in the\nfuture, that person will order from the framing company.\nNow, is that a sale?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That is a sale, but the\ndifference here is that there's neither a commitment --\nremember, the commitment is illegal as a matter of law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but there is a\ncommitment. There is a commitment to -- what they're\ntrying to get is a commitment to consider this drug if\nit's appropriate for prescription to patients in the\nfuture. That's a commitment.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Scalia, if that is\nthe commitment, then all of promotion I think is going\nto be a sale, because every promoter who walks up to you\non the street saying will you try my product, will you\ngo into the store, is trying to get you to say I'll go\nin. And that is much more of a direct commitment than\nyou saying I'll consider it in an appropriate\ncircumstance.\nThe commitment by a doctor is precatory at\nmost. They do not make any commitment in any instance\nthat can be binding in any way that they will prescribe\na drug for anyone.\nAnd remember, there is the second -- the\nsecond distinction. So, that's one. But the second is\nthat -- remember, there is a purchase in your\nhypothetical of framing, a purchase from the framing\nstore. But the second part of the Secretary's guidance\nis that when the doctor decides to issue a prescription,\nthey're not exchanging anything with the drug company.\nThere -- nothing is acquired from the drug company.\nThat is a very significant difference.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's a peculiar line of\ncommerce. And -- and you're saying that what\nconstitutes a sale -- a salesman cannot take account of\nthe fact that this is a weird line of commerce, where\nyou're selling to people who cannot make a commitment.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, there are two things.\nThe first is the commitment, and they are not selling\nanything to the doctor. Remember, just to frame this\nindustry, the pharmaceutical company sells its products;\nit sells them to pharmaceutical wholesalers, which sell\nthem to pharmacies -- pardon me -- which sell them to\ncustomers, which have a relationship with a doctor, who\nmay or may not have met with a detailer.\nThere is a sale here in this industry, but\nit is to a pharmaceutical detailer, and that is a very\nsignificant difference. The critical point as well for\npurposes of --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: May I ask you --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Goldstein, doesn't --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you to follow\nup on other -- other categories of employee? You gave\nme cleaning workers, emergency service workers. Are any\nof those categories people who get paid commissions?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Those are not, but the\nexample that I gave to Justice Kennedy would be, which\nis that there are outside buyers who do receive\ncommissions. And remember, of course, that there are\noutside salesmen who do not receive commissions but are\nnonetheless exempt. Congress didn't write an exemption\nabout commissions; it wrote them about whether it's an\noutside person who engages in sales.\nAnd the other point I was trying to make is\nthat -- and Justice Scalia echoed it to some extent --\nand that is that the FLSA draws very fine lines. If you\nwork for a movie theater you are exempt, but not a\nplayhouse. If you work for a small newspaper but not a\nsmall magazine, you're exempt. If you care for the\nelderly but not the young, you're exempt.\nAnd what Congress said is that there has to\nbe -- you are an outside salesman and that -- it is true\nthat this is a peculiar industry, but the peculiarity of\nit is that you don't make sales.\nIf I could reserve the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Stewart.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIt's common ground in this case that in\norder to be an outside salesman, an employee must make\nsales. And in theory there are two different ways in\nwhich Respondent could have attempted to establish that\nthe PSRs in this case fit that criteria.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you answer\nJustice Alito's question? Your brief to the Second\nCircuit and the Ninth Circuit suggested that a sale is\na -- is a transaction, a transfer of some sort, or at\nleast a promise to purchase. But your brief here calls\nit a much more rigid test, that there has to be a\ntransfer of title. And he pointed to the language of\n3(x) -- 3(k), that says \"consignment for sale,\" which\ndoesn't have a transfer of the title. So, what is the\nGovernment's position?\nMR. STEWART: Well, the DOL regulations have\nsince 19 -- I believe it's since 1949, have said that\n\"make a sale\" within the meaning of 203(k), the term\n\"making a sale\" within the meaning of 3(k) includes a\ntransfer of title. And in theory, the verb \"includes\"\ncould leave open the possibility that other things could\nbe included as well. We've never encountered a\nsituation in which DOL has found a sale of goods without\na transfer of title. But in direct answer to your\nquestion, Justice Alito, about --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, excuse me.\nConsignment salesmen are -- are not exempt?\nMR. STEWART: It would be -- with specific\nrespect to consignments for sale, it would have been\nmore precise to say that there has to be a transfer of\npossession in contemplation of a transfer of title.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And what about salesmen\nwho -- whose objective is to obtain a rental? The lower\ncourts have said that they qualify. Does the Government\ndisagree with that?\nMR. STEWART: DOL believes that they\nqualify, but not as sales of goods. And if the -- the\nCourt could look at the appendix to the blue brief on\npage 4. This is the pertinent regulation that refers to\nmaking sales or obtaining orders.\nAnd it says: \"Section 541.500 requires that\nthe employee be engaged in making sales within the\nmeaning of section 3(k) of the Act or obtaining orders\nor contracts for services or for the use of facilities.\"\nAnd DOL's view is that a rental agreement would be a\ncontract for services or for the use of facilities.\nAnd the way --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. How can they\nput in number (2)? I -- I thought that 3(k) is 3(k).\nCan -- can they supplement 3(k)?\nMR. STEWART: They have supplemented 3(k),\nand they did that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's the authority to do\nthat?\nMR. STEWART: The -- this is discussed in\nthe Stein Report, which was issued in 1940, and what had\nhappened was that the question had arisen -- and the\nStein report lays this out in a fair amount of detail.\nThe question had arisen whether individuals who\nnegotiate for contracts to buy time on the radio or sell\ntime -- sell advertising space in newspapers or sell --\nnegotiate contracts for carriage of freight by rail or\ntruck -- the question arose whether they were outside\nsalesmen within the meaning of the statute.\nAnd the Stein Report explained that the Wage\nand Hour Division had taken the position that they were\nnot because it interpreted \"sales\" -- it appears to have\ninterpreted \"sales\" to refer only to sales of goods, and\npeople who were engaged in those sorts of businesses\nwere not selling goods. But the Stein Report said:\nHowever, these people are commonly regarded as salesmen;\nthe contracts they negotiate are treated as sales.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's wonderful.\nThen if you can go beyond 3(k), I guess really the\nquestion before us is whether it's arbitrary or\ncapricious for the agency not to extend their -- their\npower to supplement 3(k) to this situation, which these\npeople look like salesmen to me.\nAnd so, if they can do number (2) there, I\ndon't know why -- why the agency couldn't say, oh, and\nby the way, detailers are also included.\nMR. STEWART: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the issue would be\nwhether it's unreasonable for them not to say that.\nMR. STEWART: The agency has taken the\nposition that, even though it has construed 3(k) to\nrefer only to sales of goods, that sales of services or\ncontracts for the use of facilities can be covered.\nHowever, there's a big difference between the\ninteraction between a detailer and a physician and the\ninteraction between the -- the person who sells time on\nthe radio. The person --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Sure there is; sure there\nis. But once you -- once you concede that it doesn't\nhave to be within 3(k) and that it's within the power of\nthe agency to grant the exemption anyway, then we really\nhave a different -- a different argument before us here.\nMR. STEWART: Well, the -- the theory on\nwhich the Stein Report proceeded was that, even though\nsales of time on the radio were not sales of goods, they\nwere still customarily regarded as sales, and they had\nthe essential attributes of sales; namely, an exchange\nof something valuable that the seller possessed in\nreturn for consideration from the buyer. And you don't\nhave any of that when the detailer deals with the --\nwith the --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Stewart, there's this\nother regulation which is I guess in the coverage\nsection, 779.241, which says that if an employee\nperforms any work that in a practical sense is an\nessential part of consummating the sale of the goods,\nhe'll be considered to be selling the goods.\nSo, I guess this question is a two-part\nquestion. Do you agree that that regulation does cover\nthe -- these detailers? And the second part is, if you\ndo, you know, how does it work that we should understand\n\"sale\" one way for purposes of coverage and another way\nfor purposes of exemption?\nMR. STEWART: Well, the first thing I would\nsay is that we wouldn't agree that this would cover\ndetailers. That is, if the relevant sales are, as we\nbelieve, GSK's sales to -- the transfer of drugs to\nwholesalers and pharmacies in return for consideration,\nthe detailers don't play an essential role in the\nconsummation of those sales. They don't participate in\nthose sales. It's true that their mission is to engage\nin activities which set in motion a chain of events that\nwill make those sales more likely to occur, but we\nwouldn't regard them as --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But that seems a little bit\nblind to the way the industry actually works. The way\nthis industry actually works is the real work is done by\nthe detailer getting the doctor to say, yes, I'm going\nto start prescribing this where it's medically\nappropriate. The actual sales from the company to the\npharmacy just follows from however successful the\ndetailer is.\nMR. STEWART: But I think much the same\nthing could have been said about all the promotional\nworkers that DOL has done with -- has dealt with in the\npast. That is, the premise, the justification for a\ncompany to hire a promotional worker, is that the\npromotional activities will increase the overall sales\nof the company, will either directly or indirectly set\nin motion a chain of events that leads people to buy the\nproduct. But DOL has historically regarded those\nactivities as distinct from selling the product.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, do those employees\nwork on commissions?\nMR. STEWART: Some employees may work on\ncommission. Some --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Promotional workers do work\non commissions?\nMR. STEWART: It's -- I don't think there is\nnecessarily a uniform rule one way or the other. The\nStein Report did say in 1940 that, although it was\ncharacteristic for outside salesmen to receive\ncommissions, that was not the test, that that was a\nquirk of compensation. The other thing I would say --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did we have detailers in\n1940? Gee, that's a long time ago. Did we have\ndetailers in 1940? That's almost a century ago.\nMR. STEWART: There were detailers in that\nera, and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's my point, actually.\nThat's where I'm sort of bothered, just exactly what\nJustice Scalia said, that if you look through what I've\nseen so far by the materials, they're pretty evenly\nbalanced, and there are tens of thousands of people who\nwork in this industry, and there's a history of 75 years\nof nobody said anything.\nSo you would think -- and it isn't the only\nproblem that has just been recognized in other\nindustries, too. If the agency is going to reverse, not\nreverse, but suddenly do something it hasn't done for\n75 years, the right way to do it is to have notice and\ncomment, hearings, allow people to present their point\nof view, and then make some rules or determine what\nshould happen. Perhaps they'd say for the future let's\ndo this, but not let's give people a windfall for the\npast. Perhaps they'd say some and not others. Okay?\nThat's my instinctive reaction, not\nnecessarily legal, but informed by administrative law.\nBut why shouldn't I try to get there?\nMR. STEWART: I guess I'd say two things,\none general and one specific to detailers. The general\nthing is that DOL has consistently drawn a distinction\nbetween promotional work --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I've read those.\nMR. STEWART: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I've read those, and I find\nthem beautifully ambiguous.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'll go back and read them\nagain, and if they're absolutely clear, you win, fine,\nthat's the end of it.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And it's gone on for\n70 years, and you're -- and instead of doing a\nregulation, amended regulation, as Justice Breyer\nindicates, you're filing amicus briefs quietly in\ndifferent -- different courts. It seems to me that's\nnot nearly as fair or straightforward or as candid as --\nas an agency ought to be.\nMR. STEWART: Well, with respect to where\nthe industry expectation arose, we have only one data\npoint or at least only one data point that has been\nidentified in the briefs. That is the National\nFederation of Independent Small Business Legal Center\nhas filed an amicus brief on Respondent's side, and then\nthey -- they identify one DOL opinion letter, of which\nwe were previously unaware, that dates from 1945. And\nin the opinion letter, the employer of the detailer\nasked for an opinion to the effect that its detailers\nwere covered by the administrative exemption. That\nemployer didn't request a ruling that these were outside\nsalesmen. And DOL --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're right about that,\nand so, they're at fault, too. But on the other hand,\ntheir employees might have been satisfied, and this is\ndone to protect the employees.\nSo, I'm asking, not saying, but what is the\nprocess here? How do you know -- at what level was this\nagency decision made to suddenly go ahead with this?\nWho made it? What was the input? How do you know\nthey're on your side? You do know; you're right. But I\nmean, what's the process internally?\nMR. STEWART: Internally, the -- the\nSolicitor's Office at the Department of Labor would\nconsult with the Wage and Hour Division. The\nSolicitor's name went on the briefs both that were filed\nin the Ninth Circuit and the brief -- I mean, the Ninth\nCircuit and also the Novartis brief in the Second\nCircuit. And the Solicitor's name is on the\nGovernment's brief in this Court. The Solicitor is the\nthird-highest-ranking individual within the Department\nof Labor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you -- I'm sorry\nto interrupt your answer, but does your office review\nthe amicus filings in the courts of appeals by the\nagencies?\nMR. STEWART: There was SG authorization for\nthe amicus brief to be filed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that the normal\nprocedure?\nMR. STEWART: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But this is part of a\nregular program that the agency has now instituted, to\nrun around the country and file amicus briefs; is that\nit?\nMR. STEWART: To clarify -- well, to clarify\nthe agency's view of what the proper understanding of\nthe law is. And in terms of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, right, to get --\ninstead of doing rulemaking, instead of doing\nadjudication, we're going to file amicus briefs, and the\ncourt will accept our view in that amicus brief and,\nhey, presto, we have -- we have made law.\nMR. STEWART: Well, maybe yes, maybe no --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's extraordinary.\nMR. STEWART: Well, in comparison to the\nalternative step of filing enforcement actions, it's\nboth --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, the alternative step\n..-- well, did the Secretary of Labor herself or himself,\ndepending on when it was, consider this matter?\nMR. STEWART: I don't know whether the\nSecretary --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, we don't. All right.\nSo --\nMR. STEWART: But --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, the alternative is not\nenforcement actions, necessarily. The alternative is\nfor the agency to focus on the question and decide what\nit actually wants to do.\nMR. STEWART: And the agency has regarded\nthe application of its promotion sales regulations to\nthe facts of this case as clear. That is, if you asked\nGSK's highest level management why does it make sense to\nemploy detailers, they wouldn't say because they get\nthese commitments from physicians which are of value to\nthe company. The commitments or the quasi-commitments\nfrom physicians in and of themselves are of no value.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There are 90,000 of these\npeople, and you have not -- the agency has not brought\nany action for these -- lo, these many years. Ninety\nthousand of them. And all of a sudden, you say -- you\ncome in and say, oh, you have been in violation of the\nlaw in the past, and you're going to have to pay a lot\nof money for all these people that you didn't give\novertime to in the past.\nI just think that's extraordinary.\nMR. STEWART: Well, to the extent that there\nwas an industry expectation that was based on anything\nDOL had said, it was based on, as far as we know, based\non the 1945 opinion letter, which said not --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but you -- you\ndidn't even know about that.\nMR. STEWART: Right.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And yet, you expect\nthe industry to know all about it; and yet, it escaped\nyour attention.\nMR. STEWART: Again, our argument is not\nthat they should have known from the -- about the\nopinion letter. Our argument is that the proper\napplication of the promotion sales regulation to the\nfacts of this case is pretty clear, and that if GSK's\ntop-level management was asked to defend the use of\ndetailers, they would say these people are important\nbecause if they persuade physicians to write more\nprescriptions and those are filled with GSK products,\nthen pharmacies will reorder the drug and our\nwholesalers will reorder it from us.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, can I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, you have been guilty of\nmalfeasance for 70 years, right? These 90,000 people\nout there who have been in violation of the law and the\nagency has done not a blessed thing?\nMR. STEWART: To return to the 1945 opinion\nletter, the opinion letter was based on the premise that\nthe employees exercised discretion and independent\njudgment in the performance of their duties. That's\nwhat the -- what DOL said in concluding --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I thought that\nthis whole system was set up on giving industries the\nopportunity to ask the government for an opinion letter,\ncorrect?\nMR. STEWART: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I saw in the briefing\nhundreds of opinion letters by hundreds of different\nindustries. Outside of this 1945 letter, did anybody\nelse, any other pharmaceutical company, ever set out for\nthe government or seek an opinion letter that you're\naware of?\nMR. STEWART: I'm aware of only one\ninstance. I think this is not a matter of public\nrecord, but there was one request in, I believe,\nDecember of 2007 for an opinion to the effect that the\ndetailers were covered by the outside salesman\nexemption. DOL never responded one way or the other.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't suggest -- you're\nnot arguing for a rule that if -- if an individual does\nnot seek an opinion letter, he's guilty? Is that --\nMR. STEWART: No, I'm not arguing for that\nrule. The --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Malcolm -- Mr.\nStewart, is it -- is it true that that option is no\nlonger available, that the Department of Labor no longer\ngives opinion letters?\nMR. STEWART: It does -- it has phased out\nthe opinion letter program and gives other forms of\nadministrative guidance. That is, DOL's rationale was\nthat the opinion letter program had not been cost\neffective because often the bottom line -- may I --\noften the bottom-line answer to the question would turn\non factual nuances of a particular employer and wouldn't\nprovide much guidance to others. And so, it's tried to\nprovide forms of guidance that are -- speak to the\nindustry or a class of employees as a whole.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nStewart.\nMr. Clement.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nPetitioners are two pharmaceutical sales\nrepresentatives. They were hired for a sales job. They\nwere given sales training. They attend sales\nconferences. They are assigned a sales territory, and\nthey are evaluated and compensated as sales people.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And they don't make\nsales.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's --\nMR. CLEMENT: With respect --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your long list sort\nof stopped one step short. They don't make sales.\nMR. CLEMENT: With respect,\nMr. Chief Justice, we disagree. We think they do make\nsales in the way that is relevant in this industry, and\nwe do think they make sales in some sense, which is the\npractical construction that the agency has always put on\nthe sales requirement in the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you give me what\nyour regulation is going to be?\nMR. CLEMENT: What's that?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And would it exempt\neverybody from coverage? Meaning, you seem to be saying\nif in some sense they make sales, it seems that every\npromotional person will be a salesman, that all\nindustries have to do is put one or two forms of sales\nactivities involved in the work of their worker, and\nthey're exempt. Give me your definition? As long as\nit's in some sense, that covers everybody's exempt?\nMR. CLEMENT: Yes, but, Justice Sotomayor,\nif I could, there's two important qualifications that\navoid the slippery slope concerns you're talking about.\nOne is it's, I think, common ground among everybody that\nyou -- to qualify for any exemption or certainly all of\nthese relevant exemptions here, it has to be your\nprimary duty. So, you can't just slip in a little sales\nactivity for something and get that person qualified.\nThe other thing, and I think this is very --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, it seems like the\nsale here is not the primary duty. The sale here is to\nschmooze the doctor and give him information. That's\nwhat you said in one of your briefs -- your company said\nin one of its briefs in -- in a products liability\nlitigation.\nMR. CLEMENT: With respect, Your Honor, the\ncommitment is very important in this industry. It is\nthe objective of the sales call. It's to get a\ncommitment to prescribe when medically necessary.\nNow, it is true that there is prologue to\nthat, and there is efforts to promote before you get\nthat particular sale. But the regulations address that\nparticularly, and they say, as long as you --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Primary duty is one of\nthe limiting, and what was the second limiting\nprinciple?\nMR. CLEMENT: The second limiting principle\nis actually what I'm talking about now, which is if you\nlook at 503, which are the regulations that draw the\ndistinction between promotion and between being outside\nsales, they do not say that promotion is nonexempt\nactivity. What they say is it depends who does the\npromotion. And as long as the outside salesperson does\nthe promotion in conjunction with his or her own sales\nor solicitations, then that is exempt activity. And\nwhat they're trying to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it also says -- it\nalso says promotional work incidental to sales made by\nsomeone else.\nMR. CLEMENT: Is not covered.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- is nonexempt.\nMR. CLEMENT: You're right, but --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And these sales -- I\nmean, eventually there is a sale to a hospital, to a\npharmacy, and that sale is not made by the detailer.\nMR. CLEMENT: But, Justice Ginsburg, I think\nit's important to recognize that the reason that 503\ndraws a distinction between promotional activity in\nconjunction with the salesperson's own sales or\npromotional activity with respect to somebody else's\nsales is they're concerned about the consideration where\nsomebody else is going to follow up with the same\ncustomer to close the deal.\nAnd if you look at the regulatory\ncommentary, that's what they're concerned -- they don't\nwant to sort of have double counting, where somebody\npromotes with a sales target and then somebody else\nfollows up to close the sale. And --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that might be one\nthing that they are concerned about, but it may not be\nthe only thing. I mean, if you look at these\nregulations, it seems as though what they're trying to\ndo is draw a distinction between people who actually\nconsummate transactions, transactional people, and\npeople who are pitchmen. And -- and what the Department\nof Labor here is saying is detailers are people who make\npitches; they're not people who consummate the\ntransactions.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Kagan, I really\nthink if you look at the regulations as a whole and the\ncommentary in the Stein Report and the Weiss Report,\nthey're not worried about sorting out the pitchmen\nbecause they understand that that classic outside\nsalesperson is a pitchman who then tries to get a\ncommitment to buy or some other commitment from the\nsales target.\nSo, what they're trying to do is really\ndistinguishing not between pitchmen and sales people,\nbut between what they refer to as missionary men or\npeople who pave the way for somebody else to make the\nsale. And I really think that's the focus of the 503\nregulation.\nAnd so, the Government's argument really\nboils down to the notion that there's nobody in this\nindustry that makes enough of a commitment with the\ndoctor for anybody to be involved in anything but\npromotion with the doctor. And that seems --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But why isn't that possible?\nI mean, your brief seemed to suggest that in every\nindustry there needs to be some group of people who\nwould be classified as outside salesmen. And that's not\nnecessarily the case. There may be some industries, and\nhere it's a result of regulation, or it may be because\nof other business practices, where there just isn't\nanybody who's an outside salesman.\nMR. CLEMENT: Justice Kagan, it's\ntheoretically possible, but it would be odd, especially\nin an industry that employs 90,000 people, in order to\nget a commitment to prescribe from the doctor. And I\nthink if you look across --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What is -- what is this\ncommitment? Is the commitment in writing?\nMR. CLEMENT: The commitment is generally\nnot in writing, Justice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would it be lawful to make\nit -- put it in writing?\nMR. CLEMENT: I don't know that anything\nwould turn on whether it was in writing or not because\nwhat --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would it be lawful to put\nit in writing?\nMR. CLEMENT: I -- I think the answer is\nyes. It's important for the commitment not to be\nbinding because of the nature of the doctor's role.\nNobody wants to go into a doctor's office, let alone\nthese sales people, and say, look, whoever is the next\nperson who walks in the door, prescribe them the\nproduct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That sounds to me it's not\na commitment, unless the doctor says: Well, I'll look\nat this, this is interesting; I'll go home and read your\nmaterial, I'll think about it.\nIs that -- is that a --\nMR. CLEMENT: That's not the kind of\ncommitment they're looking for, Justice Kennedy.\nThey're looking for a commitment that -- sometimes it's\nthe next patient that presents the condition for which\nthe medicine is medically appropriate, that they will\nprescribe. And if you think just practically --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's got to be non-\nbinding.\nMR. CLEMENT: It has to be non-binding. I\nagree. But I don't think that the Government --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's why -- and\nthat's why it's not in writing.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, but you can have a\nnon-binding commitment in writing. You can have a\nbinding commitment that's oral, as long as it's -- you\nknow, I don't want to get into the statute of frauds\nhere. But it seems to me that the binding nature is not\ndispositive either. You can have a situation -- look,\nif I agree as -- that I'm going to buy something, I can\noften return it. Sometimes there is a cooling-off\nperiod, things like that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let me ask you this,\nand I'm not well versed in all -- in all of the\nspecifics, but my understanding is that the Federal\nGovernment has expressed new concerns, has new\nregulations, new rules about these outside sales.\nDoes that mean that the nature of the work\nhas changed in the last 5 or 10 years, so that the\n70 years we are talking about is not relevant? Would\nyou comment on that?\nMR. CLEMENT: I'd love to, Justice Kennedy.\nI think, to the contrary, I think that -- I mean, the\nGovernment actually ironically says that the 2004\nrulemaking, which was the last time there was any\nrulemaking, didn't change anything substantively. We\nthink that's wrong. We actually think there was an\nimportant substantive change to the 503(c) regulations\nand others which addressed the following problem, which\nis not that the basic role of the outside salesperson\nhas changed, but the technology has changed in such a\nway that it would be silly to draw a distinction between\nwhether the salesperson actually takes the order and\nwrites it down or gets a form in triplicate, or rather\ngets a commitment to buy from the sales target who then\nactually enters the order on a computer on their own.\nAnd that I think is the specific situation\nthat the agency was confronted with. And in 2004 they\nsaid: We don't want things to turn on who enters the\norder, whether it's the customer on their own computer\nor the outside salesperson.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Clement, I thought\nthat in 2004 there were two proposals, really, and one\nwas the proposal that was changed, and the other was the\nproposal to get rid of this promotional stuff and to\nallow people who promoted products to qualify as outside\nsalesmen, and the agency specifically rejected that\nsuggestion.\nMR. CLEMENT: Absolutely, Justice Kagan, but\nthere has always been an effort to try to get all\npromotional people treated as being exempt. But that's\ndifferent from what's being asked for here, which is the\nlast person who makes a visit to the person who places\nthe relevant order in the industry and gets the\ncommitment from that person. That, in contrast to\ngeneral promotion, often directed at the world at large,\nhas always been the hallmark of a sale in the\nDepartment's own flexible approach. And I think that's\nreally important because if --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that seems to be\ninconsistent with this -- this opinion letter. The\nrequest is put in by the pharmaceutical company, and\nthey want an exemption under administrative employee.\nIn the Department of Labor's response allowing that\nexemption, it says that these detailers, and they use\nthe word \"detailers,\" medical detailers, are engaged in\na form of promotional or missionary work.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I -- I\nwant to say two things about that. One is to say,\nobviously, that may depend a little bit on how the\nparticular role was described. If you're reading from\nthe 1945 opinion letter, I mean, that may be somewhat\ndifferent. But I do think that what's important here is\nthat promotional activity itself is not problematic.\nPromotional activity is exempt as long as it's in\nconjunction with the person's own sales or\nsolicitations, is the word of the regulation. So, I\ndon't think that's dispositive.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This goes -- the letter\ngoes on to say that these detailers are engaged in a\nform of promotion not having for its object the making\nof specific transactions.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, and again, Justice\nGinsburg, we would take issue with that and say, no,\nthere is an interest in getting a specific commitment.\nIt is commitment to prescribe. It may be somewhat -- it\nis non-binding, and it may be somewhat forward-looking,\nbut I don't think that distinguishes this industry from\nmany industries. It's not --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But as far as your\n70 years, it's suspect for two reasons. One is we're\ntold that in the early years, at least, before there\nwere regulations restricting the sale of prescription\ndrugs, that these detailers did two things. They did\nhave their informational function, but they also did\ndirect sales to pharmaceutical companies, to hospitals.\nSo, for at least 20 years of those 70 years, these\npeople were engaged in what the department would call\nsales. So, that's suspect.\nAnd then when we have the commitment, the\nopinion letter that says we have a category for these\npeople; they are engaged in instruction, in information;\nthey are not engaged in sales; but because they're so\nindependent, we rank them as administrative -- in the\nparticular case we rank them as administrative people.\nSo -- so, it's not so that there was a\nsudden about-face as you suggest. We have a\ncategorization as -- as administrative employees, but\nnot sales employees, and we have a history of these\ndetailers at one time actually selling.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, let me\nsay -- I mean, certainly as the regulatory environment\nhas changed, the nature of how the sales are transacted\nin this industry have changed, but I think the focus is\nvery much on the doctors appropriately because they're\nthe ones that place the order. But I also want to be\nresponsive to the administrative exemption.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You wouldn't -- you\nwouldn't mind being exempt as administrative, would you?\nMR. CLEMENT: I wouldn't, Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. CLEMENT: -- but I do want to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But they've changed their\n-- their view.\nMR. CLEMENT: They've changed their view on\nthat, too. And I certainly don't want this Court to\nthink that the industry somehow has the administrative\nexemption as an ace up their sleeve or in their back\npocket. And it's really the same exact issue, because,\nonce again, the agency has changed their view. And once\nagain, their view is not based on anything that has to\ndo with label --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did you claim -- did you\nclaim exemption as administrative employee?\nMR. CLEMENT: We did, Your Honor, in the\ndistrict court. It's not before this Court because we\ngot summary judgment in our favor on the outside sales\nexemption.\nBut I really would think it would be a -- a\nmistake for this Court to say --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, that would -- then\nthat would be still open if you lose on the outside\nsales?\nMR. CLEMENT: It would, Justice Ginsburg.\nBut you're just deferring the same inquiry, because the\nGovernment's position once again is after 70 years of\nhaving the industry proceed on the assumption that these\nindividuals were exempt, they now have changed their\nmind. And, again, their view has everything to do with\nFDA regulation --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Clement --\nMR. CLEMENT: -- and nothing to do --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I'm sorry.\nMR. CLEMENT: -- and nothing to do with\nlabor policy, because what they say is that now because\nof the government's own off-label prosecutions, these\noutside salespeople have to stick to a script and -- in\norder to avoid off-label liability. And because they\nhave to stick to the script, they are told they don't\nexercise sufficient discretion to come within the\nadministrative exemption.\nAnd the problem here is the Labor\nDepartment, instead of looking at this and making a\nrational judgment about labor policy and whether these\nindividuals who make $93,000 on -- for the median should\nrationally be the kind of workers that are protected by\nthe Fair Labor Standards Act, instead they're looking at\nthings that have everything to do with FDA regulation\nand nothing to do with labor policy.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: You've suggested --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Are they paid commissions?\nIf they're -- if the salesman or the promotion agent, as\nthe case may be, is successful in his territory in\ngetting doctors to prescribe the drug, does he receive\nextra pay?\nMR. CLEMENT: He receives incentive\ncompensation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What does that mean? Does\nhe -- I mean, an outside salesman -- in one document, it\nsays is a person who often obtains a commission on his\nsales.\nMR. CLEMENT: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And now what I'm trying to\nfigure out -- I might not have the right words to ask\nthe question -- are these people, people who in some\nsense or other receive commissions on their sales?\nMR. CLEMENT: And the answer is -- for the\nPetitioners on this record, the answer is yes. They're\nnot the commissions that are a one-to-one\ncorrespondence, but what they do is they receive\nsubstantial incentive compensation, about 25 percent of\nthe total, and it's based on the sales of the product in\ntheir sales territory. So, if the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How's that different\nfrom a bonus that an employee gets? How is it any\ndifferent than what most companies do in -- in giving a\nbonus at the end of the year?\nMR. CLEMENT: Certainly, based on the facts\nin this record, it -- at the time of this case, it's\nmuch more tied to the performance of the product in the\nsales territory. And I don't think that's -- you know,\nit's not based on the company's overall performance --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Clement, you give me\none definition of \"outside salesmen,\" the one that you\nprefer for us to apply here. The Department of Labor\ngives another, and the one they're giving according to\nthem is a bright-line rule. It's easy to apply. You\nhave to do some sort of transfer of title. That's as --\ntheir rule.\nTell me what the -- your argument is that --\nwhy your rule has to win. Meaning, aren't we supposed\nto give deference to the expertise of the agency,\nespecially when Congress lets them define --\nMR. CLEMENT: Justice Sotomayor --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- the scope of the --\nMR. CLEMENT: -- two responses to that. One\nis you can't defer to the Labor Department's preferred\nconstruction, because it's flatly inconsistent with the\nstatute. This idea that you have to have a transfer of\ntitle cannot be squared with 3(k); it cannot be squared,\nat least as I understand it, with some of the -- the own\nadvice they've given, which is all you need is a\ncommitment to buy. That's what they've told people\nsince 1949.\nThere's an example in that Weiss Report from\n1949 involving a jobber where you have a situation where\nsomebody's treated as an outside salesperson even though\nthey never have title over the product. So, they get\nthe commitment to buy from the sales target, and then a\njobber who works for a different employer is the one\nthat transfers title. That's at page 11 of the NFIB\nbrief, if you want to look at it. So --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Clement, I guess I'm not\nsure I understand what you just said.\nIf -- forget the transfer of title business,\nbut if it's just -- we're requiring a transaction here.\nAnd we're drawing a line between people who do\ntransactions and people who just advertise or make\npitches or whatever you want to do it. That's perfectly\nconsistent with the statute, isn't it? I mean, you can\nargue about is it the only possible reading; you can\neven argue about whether it's the best possible reading.\nBut it's surely a -- a possible reading.\nMR. CLEMENT: It is a possible reading,\nJustice Kagan. But it's not the one that the Labor\nDepartment has advanced in their amicus brief. So, you\ncan't defer to that. I mean, you can decide that it's\nthe best reading of the statute if you want, but --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I suppose that that's\na question for them. I read their amicus briefs to sort\nof suggest two things. Sometimes they just talk about\ntransactions, and sometimes they talk about transfer of\ntitle.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, and with respect,\nJustice Kagan, that's one of the many problems with\ndeferring to amicus briefs. Because when an agency\ngives guidance in an interpretative rule or something,\nthere's one place, and they provide \"the\" answer. Now,\nI don't know if the Government wants you to defer to the\n-- defer to the argument on page 12 or the argument on\npage 20 or the argument on page 24.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I think that they\nwould say that it doesn't make any difference, because\nthey've never really seen a person who makes\ntransactions without transferring title. So, I think\nthat --\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, with respect, they\nhave --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- they would think the --\nthe difference is --\nMR. CLEMENT: No, with respect, they have\nseen that person.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Consignment, for one, which\nis legitimate business.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, consignment is in the\nstatute, but this jobber example is right out of the\nWeiss Report in 1949, and the outside salesperson in\nthat case never had title. The title comes from the\njobber who works for somebody else. So, the salesperson\nin that instance never had title, not even in the chain\nof distribution. Yet, they say that is a clear case\nwhere the person is an outside salesperson and exempt.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did -- did the\npharmaceutical companies request -- ever in this period,\nrequest a ruling, a rulemaking on the status of these\nPSRs?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I understand from the\nGovernment that there was a request in 2007 and that the\nLabor --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That was an opinion\nletter, they said. I thought they said that was an\nopinion letter.\nMR. CLEMENT: It was a request for an\nopinion letter. I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. I asked if there\nwas a request from the pharmaceutical companies for a\nrulemaking on the proper classification in this case.\nMR. CLEMENT: No, there wasn't, Justice\nGinsburg, but I think that actually cuts in our favor,\nbecause in 2004, a lot of companies were coming in with\nthings where they thought it was unclear, where they\nthought there was some doubt, and asking for\nclarification. This was so well understood that the\noutside sales exemption, or perhaps the administrative\nexemption, covered the outside sales force of this\nindustry --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What's the case that I\ncite if this opinion is written the way you -- you\npropose, and the -- this Court says, well, this has been\n70 years, or maybe in 10 years if you take the new\nregulations as setting a new regime, and the Department\nhas never made an objection. And, therefore, it follows\nthat the Department's interpretation is implausible or\nimproper, and then I cite some case from our Court.\nWhat -- how do I write this?\nMR. CLEMENT: I would -- I would ask you not\nto be bound by having to cite a case. I would ask you\nto just use the following reasoning, though, which I\nthink is 100 percent -- and there's plenty of cases you\ncould cite as perhaps Cf. cites.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'd like one.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. CLEMENT: Sure. Well, here's -- let's\nstart -- let's start with Fox and just the basic notion\nthat in administrative law, if you're going to change\nyour position, you have to acknowledge that you're\nmaking a change. I think at a minimum here, if they're\ngoing to impose this kind of massive retroactive\nliability on this industry --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Clement, this isn't\na change. You've referred to it as a change in a lot of\nways -- in a lot of times, but what we have here is an\nagency that, for some number of years, thought that this\nwas not the most urgent problem on their plate. Indeed,\none would think this is a pretty peculiar Department of\nLabor if they thought that this was the most urgent\nproblem on their plate. So, they didn't enforce it.\nBut now the question has come up. And so,\nthey say we'll look to our regulations. This falls on\none side of the regulation. Now, you've been given a\ngift for all these years is one way of looking at it,\nbecause -- because you were not their most urgent\nproblem; and so, they didn't enforce their own\nregulations against you.\nMR. CLEMENT: Justice Kagan, here's the\nthing. We can quibble about whether or not there is a\nchange in their position or whether they just didn't\nhave a position before, but I think the important thing\nis they've imposed, by taking this position in an amicus\nbrief and asking for deference to it, massive liability\non this industry. The PhRMA brief estimates it's\nbillions of dollars.\nNow, I --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why must you -- why must\nyou look to an amicus brief? Why not just look to the\nregulation that defines -- the regulations that define\n\"sale\" and that define \"promotion\"? The 541.503 says\npromotion work incidental to a sale made by somebody\nelse is not exempt.\nWhy do we get into the amicus brief when we\nhave in these 541 regulations a definition of sales on\nthe one hand, promotion on the other, and then this\nstatement that promotion work incidental to sale made by\nsomebody else is not exempt?\nWhy doesn't -- why isn't that the answer to\nthis case?\nMR. CLEMENT: Here's the answer as to why\nthat's not the answer, and then let me circle back and\nsay why, if you're going to err on one side or the\nother, you shouldn't err on the side of imposing massive\nretroactive liability. The reason that that's not a\nsimple matter of deferring to that is because that same\nregulation earlier says that promotional work is exempt\nif it's in conjunction with the individual's own sales\nor solicitations.\nNow, I happen to think it's pretty clear\nthat these -- by getting this commitment, which is the\nfunctional equivalent of a commitment to buy, which is\nwhat the regulations and the regulatory interpretations\nhave always said is a sale in some sense, I think these\nare sales. Certainly --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Does the -- does the\npharmaceutical company have a sales force? I mean, who\nsells to the wholesalers, the pharmacies, and the\nhospitals?\nMR. CLEMENT: It's not this kind of outside\nsales force. It's a much less sales-oriented\ntransaction. The PhRMA amicus brief, for example, gives\nthe example of a company that has 2,000 outside sales\nreps and 10 people that handle the movement of transfer\nof product to the wholesalers and the distributors.\nIf you look at district court's opinion at\nthe page 42a of the petition appendix, the district\ncourt addresses this issue and I think gets it exactly\nright, which is the reason there isn't a sales effort\nfocused on the wholesalers and distributors is because\ntheir job is to have on stock the kind of medicines that\nphysicians are prescribing.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there are -- there\nare people who sell to them. There may be only a few,\nbut --\nMR. CLEMENT: There's a handful of people,\nJustice Ginsburg, but that's -- I mean, there's nothing\nanomalous about that. Most industries have some sales\nforce that operates on the wholesale --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there -- are they\nexempt, too?\nMR. CLEMENT: What's that?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the actual sellers\nfrom the -- the people on the staff of a pharmaceutical\ncompany who sell to the wholesalers, pharmacies, and\nhospitals, are they exempt?\nMR. CLEMENT: I don't believe so, Your\nHonor, at least not under the outside sales exemption,\nin part because they're not outside, in part because\nthey're not really engaged in a sales effort. It does\nthem no good -- if they can convince some wholesaler or\ndistributor that the GSK product is far superior to a\ncompetitor's product and it doesn't make any difference\nat all because as a result of that -- I mean, they need\nto have product that actual doctors are writing\nprescriptions for. That's what drives sales in this\nindustry.\nThere's nothing anomalous about that. If\nyou think about any industry, sales activity is always\ndirected at the people who place orders. In this\nindustry, because of the learned intermediary doctrine,\nthe person who places the order is the doctor, not the\nultimate end user.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there -- let's\nsay the doctor hears the spiel and the doctor says,\nokay, yours is the first thing I'll think of, you know,\nwhen I have a patient with this and this. I mean, is\nthat a sale?\nMR. CLEMENT: We think it is, Your Honor,\nbut if you have any doubt about that, certainly at the\npoint that the doctor then, when he sees the next\npatient, writes the prescription, at that point I think\nthere's a sale, because, again, what the regulations and\nregulatory history looks for is a -- is a commitment to\nbuy. That's the relevant commitment to buy. That's the\norder in this industry --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, what if the\ndoctor, as I suspect a lot of doctors do, they listen to\nthis guy, and they say, okay, I'll think of -- you know,\nwhen it comes up, I'll think of your product; and the\nnext guy comes in from the other company, and he says,\nokay, when it comes up I'll think of your product -- are\nthose two sales or no sale?\nMR. CLEMENT: I think they're probably two\nsales, Your Honor. But, you know, it's the same\nthing -- imagine somebody who's, you know, just sitting\nin their house, and they get an encyclopedia\nsalesperson. And they say, you know, I'll -- maybe I'll\nbuy that. That looks good, I'll buy it. And they say,\nbut you know, maybe the State law has a law that says\nyou've got to wait 24 hours before you put the order in,\nin the computer.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's a firmer\ncommitment when they say I'll buy it. The physician is\njust saying I'll think of your product when it -- when\nthe need comes up.\nMR. CLEMENT: But -- well, if -- I mean,\nwhat I was suggesting is maybe you're talking about a\nState that has a 24-hour waiting rule or something like\nthat. So, it's a commitment that, sure, I'm going to\nenter the order in 24 hours. Well, maybe another\nencyclopedia salesmen comes in, in 12 hours, and he\ngives another commitment. One of the two people he's\ngoing to put the order in, and one of the two people\nwill certainly have finally had a sale. I think,\nagain --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But don't you think that the\nway this works -- I mean, the way we should all hope it\nworks is that the detailer comes in, the detailer\nprovides information, the doctor says that's very\ninteresting, I want to think about it, I'm going to\nthink about it. Then the doctor reads some medical\njournals; then maybe the doctor goes to a convention and\ntalks to other doctors about the product.\nI mean, that's what you would hope that a\ndoctor would do before a doctor decided I'm going to\nstart prescribing this medicine. And the detail work is\na part of that, but so are many other things before the\ndoctor actually decides to do something.\nMR. CLEMENT: Sure, Justice Kagan. But you\ndon't want to look at this like it's an isolated,\none-time, you know, sort of interaction. I mean, one of\nthe things that -- that happens in this industry, like\nother sales industry, is there are multiple trips. The\ndetailer goes there maybe the first time and lays the\nground work. Then maybe the doctor reads some other\ninformation. Then maybe on the final visit, after all\nthat information is there, finally the detailer gets the\ncommitment to prescribe to appropriate patients.\nI think one way to think about the absurdity\nof making the difference turn on the prescription is to\ncompare this salesperson to another salesperson of\nmedical devices who goes in, but these are medical\nsupplies that the doctor uses in the doctor's office.\nNow, they're both hired for their sales experience.\nThey both get sales training. They both have a sales\nterritory. They're sitting in the same doctor's waiting\nroom, waiting for the same doctor; they have samples in\ntheir bags, and they both get a commitment from the\ndoctor.\nNow, what sense does it make as a matter of\nthe FLSA and its labor policies to say one of those\npeople is exempt and the other one is not exempt,\nbecause for perfectly sensible reasons, we say that one\nof those products is a prescription where the doctor\nwrites the order and then with that order, the end user,\nthe ultimate end user, can make the purchase at the\npharmacy, whereas the other one --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Clement, I wanted to\nask you about section 501 of the regulations, which --\nwhich is on page 4 of the appendix in the blue brief,\nand was mentioned in the -- in the Government's\npresentation. It says -- requires that the employee be\nengaged in (i) making sales within the meaning of 3(k);\nor (ii) obtaining orders or contracts for services or\nfor the use of facilities.\nWhat authorization is there for the agency\nto invent number (ii)?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, you\nheard the Government's explanation; and, as you suggest,\nif the Government's explanation is right, then this\nshouldn't be a matter of just trying to limit things to\n3 -- to the 3(k) definition. I think, even though -- at\nthe 3(k) definition, though, if you look at that\ndefinition, it has every hallmark of being broad and\nfunctional and flexible.\nI would want to make one very important\npoint, though, about the ultimate question here, because\nultimately the decision whether to go one way or another\non this issue has remarkable significance for\nretroactive imposition of liability.\nWe all know that retroactive rulemaking is\ndisfavored. Well, think about the consequences here.\nYou have massive liability, between 4 and 6 years of\neffective time and a half, because of the way that the\nstatute works. It has time and a half plus liquidated\ndamages. You are talking about people who are very well\npaid, close to six figures. So, unlike the classic\nworker who you might think is covered by the FLSA, who\nis a relatively low hourly worker, the amounts of\ndamages here are quite significant.\nOf course, the effort to try to reconstruct\nthese people's hours, given that they were told they\nwere exempt and they were outside the office, trying to\nreconstruct how many overtime hours they actually worked\nis going to be a crapshoot at best. So, if you think\nabout all of that, and then you think about, as\nJustice Breyer indicated, the other option, which is\nto --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Let's pursue this for a\nsecond.\nMR. CLEMENT: Sure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because I'd like to go back\nto Justice Kennedy's question, and this is only me\nspeaking. I don't know how anybody else feels. If this\nhad come up in 1941, you wouldn't have had a chance. I\nwould have said look at the statute; it says the\nSecretary defines it. You'd say, well, can you define\nit in a brief? Yes, you have to be careful of briefs,\nbut, yes. And that's the end of the case. It's not a\nquestion for judges; it's a question for administrators.\nAll right. But now it's difficult for me\nbecause of the passage of 75 years. And we can blame it\nin part on the industry or in part on the Secretary.\nThere is blame to go around. So, the question is, what\ndo I do as a judge?\nAnd partly my instinct is get somebody to\ndecide this other than a lawyer in the Department of\nLabor, because this is a hard question. And that's\nwhere we come to Justice Kennedy's question, which is he\nsays all right, fine, let's write that, and -- and what\ncase do we cite?\nAnd I don't agree with you, overturn Auer.\nI think amicus briefs are often helpful, but use them\nwith care. And then I have the statute here, which\ntalks about the Secretary doing the definition of\n\"outside salesman,\" and I have lots of rules and\nregulations and reports, which are fairly ambiguous in\nmy opinion. So, you tell me what to say.\nMR. CLEMENT: I -- may I answer?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Certainly.\nMR. CLEMENT: I would start by citing -- I\nknow it's not always in fashion to cite lower court\nopinions, but I'd start by citing Judge Posner's opinion\nin Yi, because the Seventh Circuit -- they're a very\ndistinguished panel, Judge Posner, Judge Wood, and one\nother judge. The three of them considered this\nquestion -- Judge Sykes. I'm sorry; it slipped my mind.\nA very distinguished judge.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. CLEMENT: The -- it's -- the point being\nthat he said along these lines that the 70 years of\nhistory makes a significant difference. And here's the\nthing. Just like you expect an agency to confront a\nchange in position, you'd at least expect an agency to\nconfront the retroactive consequences and in that sense\naddress them and make sense of it.\nAnd I would just simply say this, which is\nif you had a rulemaking, you could bring in all of the\naffected parties, including the current sales\nrepresentatives, who are not the ones bringing these\nlawsuits, whose jobs are going to be changed, and you\ncould make a comprehensive view, as opposed to just\ngetting one side of an ongoing litigation and then\nmaking a decision about an amicus brief.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Thank you. I'll look at\nit.\nCHIEF JUSTICE BREYER: Mr. Goldstein, 3\nminutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you,\nMr. Chief Justice.\nThree quick points. First, if you read the\ntranscript, you will see that my friend says that the\nnature of this job has changed. And that is an\nessential part of understanding this case. And there is\nan entire amicus brief in addition to our submission on\nbehalf of pharmaceutical representatives, which explains\nhow very much the requirements of pharmaceutical\ndetailers and the restrictions on them have changed\ndramatically over the last couple of decades in\nparticular. And that's why the continued references to\n70 years are wrong.\nThe other important point about the FLSA in\nparticular is that there is a statute on this issue, and\nit says that an employer can request guidance from the\nagency; and if it doesn't do that, it is not -- it has\nno defense. Its job is to ask for guidance. And there\nare 50 different exemptions from the FLSA that cover\nhundreds of different categories of employees. And if\nthe rule you are going to announce -- because Mr.\nClement's view is you shouldn't be bound by any\nprecedent. If the rule you are going to now announce is\nthat there has to be rulemaking with respect to all of\nthose, it's going to be an administrative nightmare.\nTwo quick further points. The Department of\nLabor's position is that there has to be an actual\ncommitment, not a precatory commitment. And Mr. Clement\nsays, well, that's contrary to the definition of \"sale\"\nin 3(k). Please read the definition again, and if you\nfind something in there, something that is not a\ncommitment -- it can be an exchange; it can be a\ncommitment that is even a consignment; it can be a\ntraditional sale. Every one of those things is\ncommitment. It is impossible to find in the definition\nof \"commitment\" a rule that says -- excuse me, in the\ndefinition of \"sale\" --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Where do they say that\nthat's -- that that's their test? Where does the\nDepartment of Labor say that's their test, that it has\nto be a commitment? I thought what they said in their\nbrief was there has to be a transfer of title.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: There are two different\nparts to it. One is that they -- as explained by Mr.\nStewart, their view of transfer of title, but the Weiss\nReport says repeatedly that there has to be a commitment\nto buy. That is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, which is it? I mean,\nyou say, yes, yes, it's both.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: You have to agree --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Pick one.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: You have to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is it the transfer of title\nor a commitment?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It is the agreement to\ntransfer title. There are two parts to it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ah. Okay.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: But there has to be the\nagreement, a firm agreement. It's repeated in the 2004\npreamble to the regulations as well.\nNow, the last critical point I want to make\nis that Mr. Clement says there are commissions on sales\nin the sales territory. And what he is not talking\nabout is any commitment by a physician. When you go\nlook at the transcript and he talks about sales in the\nsales territory, he is talking about the sales by the\npharmacy. That's where the sale occurs in this\nindustry. It's to the wholesaler and to the pharmacy\nand to the customer.\nHe is not talking about a sale in the sense\nof getting a commitment to have --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the district court\nhere made a finding -- this is at 42a of the appendix\nfor the Petitioners: \"Sales volume is directly and\nexclusively driven by the number of prescriptions\nwritten by physicians, and plaintiffs' job was to\nencourage such prescriptions.\"\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That -- Mr. Justice Kennedy,\nI don't believe that you can fairly describe that as a\nfinding of fact. That is the judge -- his view of the\nsummary judgment record. It is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's a finding of logic,\nfor Pete's sake. These are prescriptions. You can only\nget a prescription from a doctor. Obviously, the number\nof prescriptions, drugs sold, depends upon the number of\nprescriptions given by doctors.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Two -- two things about\nthat. First is that a detailer doesn't get a commitment\nto a prescription. And then in addition, it's clear\nthat there are numerous influences on what a doctor\ndoes. There's all the advertising --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's a different point.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It is an important point.\nIt is a different point, but it is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not the point you were\nmaking.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Scalia, the point\nthat I will make at bottom is that you have to have a\nfirm commitment. That's what the Department says. And\nthere is nothing in the definition in 3(k) that\ncontradicts that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel,\ncounsel.\n"
