        "content": "(11:19 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Holmes v. South Carolina.\nMr. Blume.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. BLUME\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BLUME: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please\nthe Court:\nIn this case, the South Carolina Supreme\nCourt took the second of two recent steps that\ndramatically curtail a defendant's ability to create a\nreasonable doubt as to his innocence by presenting\nevidence that another individual committed the crime.\nThe first step came in 2001 when, in State v.\nGay, the court held that the admissibility of third\nparty guilt evidence was dependent on the strength of\nthe prosecution's case.\nThe second step, which occurred in Mr.\nHolmes' case, holds that third party guilt evidence is\ninadmissible whenever the prosecution has presented\nstrong forensic evidence of the defendant's guilt.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now, there's some dispute as\nto whether that -- that is really what -- what it held.\nAnd there's a big difference. If -- if you just say\nwhenever you -- whenever the prosecution has a strong\ncase, you can't introduce other guilt, or whether all\nthat the court is saying is that one of the elements\nthat you consider in determining whether to admit this\n-- this third party is not just -- it's the comparative\nweakness of the third party case. You don't blind\nyourself to -- to the strength of the prosecution's\ncase.\nWill you say it was bad even if it was the\nlatter that the court was -- was referring to? Are you\nsaying you cannot consider the strength of the\nprosecution's case at all in determining whether to\nallow in third party guilt evidence?\nMR. BLUME: Yes, Justice Scalia, I am. It's\nnot necessary for a ruling in our favor in this case.\nIt's not contingent here because at a minimum, the\nSouth Carolina Supreme Court rule here in describing\nit, they said in State v. Gay we held that in cases\nwhere there is strong evidence of guilt, including\nstrong forensic evidence, evidence that a third party\ncommitted the crime is not admissible. That is a\ncategorical rule of exclusion no matter how you cut it.\nBut even if you deemed that there is some\ndiscretion left in the system, it is still\nunconstitutional because what the South Carolina system\nrequires is a reasoning backwards, that the\nadmissibility of evidence of the defendant's innocence\nis conditioned on the judge's assessment of the\nlikelihood of the defendant's guilt.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I suppose that\nin a purely discretionary system -- I -- I can't quite\nthink of the hypothetical -- the strength of the\nprosecution's case may bear on the assessment of\nrelevance and materiality as to the evidence the\ndefense wants to introduce. If -- if the evidence of\nidentification is -- is quite clear -- is quite clear\n-- and then there's some witness of marginal\ncredibility that says he was in another city, I think\nthat may affect the trial court's balance.\nI -- I take the thrust of your point, that\nthe strength of the case makes it more important to\nintroduce the third party evidence, not -- not less. I\n-- I take that point. But just as -- as an absolute\nrule, I'm not sure that the strength of the case is\nalways irrelevant. That's what I'm saying.\nMR. BLUME: I think that it is possible that\nunder some circumstances not the strength of the\nState's case but the evidence as a whole may shed some\nlight on whether the third party guilt evidence is\nrelevant. For example, if the uncontested evidence is\nthe crime occurred on Tuesday, January 3rd, and the\nthird party guilt evidence shows that the third party\nwas in Acapulco on January 3rd and had no possibility\nto be there, that's not a strength issue. That is\nrelevance.\nBut when the touchstone for admissibility is\nwhether the defense evidence overcomes the\nprosecution's case -- and in the South Carolina rule\nfor -- just to be clear, it's not even considered that\nyou consider the evidence of guilt. The defense\nevidence of third party guilt has to overcome the\nprosecution's forensic evidence.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose that everything in\nthis case were the same. Everything is identical\nexcept what the court of appeals or the State supreme\ncourt holds is that we think under rule 403, which\nhappens to be the rule in our State, the probative\nvalue doesn't warrant admissibility in light of the\nrisk of prejudice. But everything else is the same.\nMR. BLUME: If the South Carolina --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, in your opinion is that\nconstitutional?\nMR. BLUME: Just to make sure I understand\nit, if the South Carolina Supreme Court in this case on\nthese facts had said this was a 403.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. BLUME: No. I think that would be\nunconstitutional --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because?\nMR. BLUME: -- under this Court's decision in\nOlden v. Kentucky that this Court has recognized that\nevidentiary rulings, based on the strength of the\nevidence in this case, can be arbitrary and capricious\nand deprive a defendant of --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what they'll say --\nMR. BLUME: -- his right to defense.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- if they want to build it\nout, is they'll say, look, there -- there is DNA\nevidence here. It's absolutely conclusive, and all\nthat the light -- the -- the only doubt of the -- the\ndefense has cast on it is they found that there was\nsome opportunity that the police could have tampered\nwith it. That's true of 60 percent or so of all chain\nof custody cases, and that is not sufficient to\novercome what it shows. And therefore, it's not worth\nthe jury's time and it'll prove very confusing to the\njury.\nNow, why would that ruling under 403 be\nunconstitutional?\nMR. BLUME: Well, that ruling in this case\nwould be unconstitutional because it would be a\nmischaracterization of what Mr. Holmes' evidence was.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Good. Now, that's what I\nwant you to get to.\nMR. BLUME: Challenging the DNA evidence.\nThat is not the -- the state of the evidence in this\ncase, but --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the key points that\nsuggest that what I just said is not a fair\ncharacterization or a correct characterization are?\nMR. BLUME: That the evidence in this case --\nthat even the FBI agent who testified for the\ngovernment admitted the DNA could have been placed\nthrough the incompetent handling of the evidence by\nOfficer Mobley, that without gloves and with all the\nevidence in his possession, he inventoried the items,\nincluding Mr. Holmes' clothing and the victim's\nclothing, stuck his hands in the bag, determined what\nwas in there without washing them or gloves, stuck his\nhand in another bag, determined what was in there. And\neven they admitted that due to the very small amount of\nDNA that was recovered, that Officer Mobley's actions\ncould have been the source of the DNA on the clothing.\nIn addition to that, there were a number of\nother suspicious activities, including Officer Mobley\nlocked everyone else out before he inventoried,\nprocessed the scene. And then there were problems with\ncontamination there.\nAnd then at the bottom -- at the end of the\nday, the defense presented a DNA expert, the only non-\nforensic scientist, but the most qualified scientist in\nthe case from the New York University Medical School,\nand he said, look, this DNA doesn't mean anything.\nThere are things that science cannot explain. There\nare dye globs here which should not be present.\nThere's also a spike that does not belong to Mr. Holmes\nor --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, where --\nwhere in the record is the testimony of the FBI agents\nthat you were referring to?\nMR. BLUME: It's -- it's in the joint\nappendix. The -- the agent which admitted this was\nAgent Baechtel. I think it's actually in the joint\nappendix, page 249, but I'm not positive of that, and\ncounsel will look for it.\nBut there was also their defense expert who\nsaid that the bottom-line results were unreliable. So\nat the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about -- what about\nthe DNA -- the exclusion of the alleged perpetrator, of\nWhite? There -- there was no trace of White's DNA.\nAnd that was a FBI officer who testified to that.\nMR. BLUME: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. I don't\nfind that surprising at all, given the facts of this\ncase. It's, you know, seek and ye shall find, or don't\nseek and ye shall not find. In this case, they took\nnone of Jimmy White's clothing to test to see if there\nwas any incriminating DNA on that. They didn't take\nhis shoes, even though they had the shoe print.\nThis was not a case in which the DNA pointed\nto a single perpetrator. There were no vaginal swabs\nor rectal swabs which contained any information of any\nvalue whatsoever.\nAnd by the time they finally got around to\ndoing the DNA testing in 1996, numerous items of\nclothing, including several items belonging to the\nvictim, had disappeared and no one could explain where\nthey had went. So the fact that they didn't find Jimmy\nWhite's DNA on Bobby Holmes' clothing I think is of no\nsignificance whatsoever.\nThe main -- one of the main thrusts of the\ndefense case here was because of the incompetence or\nthe malfeasance of the police officers in this case,\nthat the evidence against Holmes was unreliable.\nMR. BLUME: Mr. Blume, I -- I know you're\nmore concerned about -- about what result you get in\nthis case and -- and whether your client gets another\ntrial or not. I am more concerned about -- about the\nrule of law that we're going to apply in the case which\nwill affect a whole lot of other trials, and I -- I\nfrankly think we're playing with fire. I -- I worry\nabout criminal trials turning into circuses in which --\nin -- in which the police are put on trial, which is\npart of what is happening here and what has happened in\n-- in a famous recent American case. I worry that --\nthat that will be the -- the result if -- if we take\nyour suggestion, which is to prescind from any\nconsideration of the strength of the prosecution's case\nand simply look at the -- at the alleged third party\nguilt evidence on its own without -- without any\nconsideration of its relative -- its relative strength.\nJust -- you want us to do it just absolutely.\nMR. BLUME: Well, I would say, Justice\nScalia, that that's the way the 49 other States do it.\nSouth Carolina is the only State which has a rule\nwhich requires a defendant to overcome the\nprosecution's case. And in South Carolina, not only do\nyou have to overcome the prosecution's case, the only\nthing that counts is the prosecution's evidence. They\ncompletely dismiss --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where -- where do you\nthink it says you have to overcome the prosecution's\ncase?\nMR. BLUME: In the Holmes opinion.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a -- it's a\nfactor that's considered in weighing the admissibility\nand relevance of the third party guilt. They don't --\nyou don't have to prove and rebut and overcome, as\nyou've said a couple of times, the prosecution's case.\nMR. BLUME: The -- the holding in Mr. Holmes'\ncase is Holmes simply cannot overcome the forensic\nevidence against him.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. But with respect, I --\nisn't the -- the term that they use -- and I was going\nto ask essentially the same question. The term that\nthe court uses is raise a reasonable inference of his\ninnocence. And I will -- I will grant you this. When\nI read that, it said -- I thought to myself it sounds\nas though they are saying he must present evidence or\nmake a showing, a preliminary showing, that it is more\nprobable than not that he is innocent despite the\nState's evidence. But they never spell that out, and\nis it spelled out anywhere?\nMR. BLUME: Well, there has not been a -- a\ndecision since then. But I think if you read the\nsentence before that in the opinion where it says --\nthey describe the Gregory rule, which was the old rule,\nwith which we have no quarrel. The rules are similar\nto that in other jurisdictions. It says, further, we\nheld in State v. Gay that in cases where there is\nstrong evidence of guilt, especially forensic evidence,\nevidence of third party guilt simply is not admissible.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you say you\ndon't object to the -- the Gregory standard, and the\nGregory standard is the one Justice Souter just quoted,\nraise a reasonable inference as to his own innocence.\nNow, how can you tell whether it raises a reasonable\ninference in a vacuum without regard to the evidence on\nthe other side? If the evidence on the other side is\n-- I understand you dispute it in this case, but let's\nsay unobjectionable DNA evidence that your client was\nthe person there, and his third party guilt evidence is\nit wasn't me. How can you tell whether that creates a\nreasonable inference or not without looking at what's\non the other side?\nMR. BLUME: Well, I -- I think because, one,\nif you do that, you could supplant -- you -- you have\nmade the judge the jury, and the defendant, in order to\npresent evidence of his innocence, have to -- has to\nwin a trial before the trial -- before the judge.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, not at all. What\nyou're saying is that the evidence has to be -- the\nadmissibility of evidence has to be assessed in light\nof the circumstances. If your claim of innocence is,\nas it may be in this case, that the DNA evidence\ndoesn't show what you think it shows, fine, that\nevidence comes in. If the evidence you're trying to\nget in is somebody in the jailhouse said he heard that\nsomebody else did it, and the -- and you don't\nchallenge the DNA evidence that places your client\nthere, then maybe that doesn't create a reasonable\ninference, while it might in a different case,\ndepending on the nature of the prosecution's evidence.\nMR. BLUME: I -- first of all, there is no\nother State that does it that way. No State considers\nthat. They look at the third party guilt evidence on\nits own terms and consider does it raise a reasonable\ninference. And even in your hypothetical, the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm -- I'm just not\nsure that's the case. We're asking about 403. In\norder to completely exclude and prescind, in Justice\nScalia's word, that the -- the nature of the\nprosecution's case just doesn't seem to me right.\nMR. BLUME: 403 --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Now -- now, if you want to\nsay there's a more wooden rule and a -- and a more iron\nrule here that was prejudicial, I think that's\nsomething else.\nMR. BLUME: There -- there is, and I think\nthe South Carolina rule is a categorical rule based on\nthe description. I think it also requires a defendant\nto overcome, and it does so in an unfair way. Footnote\n8 in the opinion makes clear that in establishing\nwhether the third party guilt evidence overcomes the\nState's evidence, you look only at the State's\nevidence, and the defendant's counter forensic evidence\nis deemed irrelevant. So you have to overcome it with\na stacked deck.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But is it your argument that\nthe State's evidence can't be considered at all, or\nthat it can't be given more than a certain amount of\nweight? And if it's the latter, where do you draw the\nline?\nMR. BLUME: I think that you cannot -- that\nas a general matter, a State cannot require a defendant\nto persuade a judge of his likely innocence before he\ncan present evidence to the jury that he's innocent.\nThat is -- that is putting the judge in the role of the\njury, and that's what the South --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Yes, but the State doesn't go\nthat far. If it doesn't require the defendant to\npersuade the judge of the defendant's likely innocence,\nthen there's no constitutional violation. If the -- if\nthe rule of State law simply requires a consideration\nof the strength of the prosecution evidence in relation\nto the defense evidence, that's -- that's all right?\nMR. BLUME: I think it depends what\nconsideration means. Consideration, for example, in\nterms of is the third party guilt evidence relevant in\nsome way, that is not constitutionally objectionable.\nBut when you have a weighing procedure like South\nCarolina does and the admissibility of the evidence of\ninnocence depends on a judge's assessment of the\ncredibility of the defendant's case and the\nprosecution's case, that is what juries do.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But where is the line?\nThat's what I'm trying to get at. If it's -- if the\nrule is that the defendant has to raise a reasonable\ninference of innocence and you take into account the\nstrength of a prosecution's case in making that\ndetermination, you don't just accept the defense\nevidence and -- and see whether -- how -- how strong an\ninference of innocence it would raise if it's believed.\nI mean, where is the line?\nMR. BLUME: I think that would be -- because\nthat is implicitly weighed. Your hypothetical to me is\nimplicitly weighed, and I think that's --\nJUSTICE ALITO: And that would be\nunconstitutional as well.\nMR. BLUME: I think that's unconstitutional.\nAll these cases where you indicate, well, you\nknow, what if it's conclusively -- that the evidence is\nconclusive and the defendant didn't contest the DNA,\nshould it be let in --\nJUSTICE ALITO: That makes it sound like it\ncan't be considered at all.\nMR. BLUME: That -- well, only for relevance\nand possibly for some 403's because that's looking at\nthe 403 part. But in that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What if the -- what if the\ncourt says, we will weigh it to the extent of\ndetermining whether, in light of the State's case, the\nproffered evidence, if accepted, would pass the laugh\ntest? That's weighing. Is -- is that -- is that\nlegitimate?\nMR. BLUME: I think that that is problematic.\nAnd -- but the -- the point I think is no other State\ndoes it. Now, they would -- if it didn't pass the\nlaugh test, it wouldn't pass the laugh test on its own\nterms. If you read the cases of exclusion, it's where\nthe defendant wanted to present evidence that some dude\nnamed Duke that nobody can find had a motive to kill\nthe person. And the courts say, well, no, you can't do\nthat. Or the -- someone is on trial and they want to\nprove that the -- for killing a man's wife, and they\nwant to show, well, the husband had $1 million in life\ninsurance policy. And courts said, no, you can't do\nthat. If all you've got is motive, if all you've got\nis propensity, if all you've got is opportunity, that's\nnot in this -- they're -- in all the other 49 States,\nthey're looking at it on their own terms. Nothing this\nCourt will do in Mr. Holmes' case will disturb the law\nin the other 49 jurisdictions.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that does go -- somehow\nthat goes beyond mere relevance. You can't say that\nthe -- I don't think you can say that the existence of\nthe million dollars in life insurance is irrelevant.\nIt's just that it doesn't prove much unless it can be\ncombined with certain other kinds of evidence. And\nwhen you say you've got a standard that looks into\nthat, then you have crossed the line from mere\nrelevance to probative force, haven't you?\nMR. BLUME: Yes, but you're not considering\nhow strong the government's case is and conditioning\nadmissibility --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. I -- I grant you that.\nBut to say that the only test is relevance seems to be\ntoo strong.\nMR. BLUME: I'm sorry. I -- I didn't mean to\nsuggest that. I was sort of just describing how other\nStates do it and the relevance. Then they also -- many\nof them have -- they articulate it different ways, but\nit's basically relevance with a 403 type of exclusion,\nthat if the evidence doesn't meet the third party guilt\nevidence on its own terms, doesn't meet a certain\nquantum, back -- doesn't get over the laugh test, then\nit's not admissible. Other States do it and they say,\nwell, it's got to create a reasonable inference of\ninnocence. That's fine. Or it must create a\nreasonable likelihood about the defendant's guilt.\nThat's fine too.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You think -- you think\nthere's no difference where really very questionable\nevidence about some third party's guilt is -- is\nproduced in a case where -- where the State's case\nbarely makes it over the -- over the line to get to the\njury and you think it's -- it's the same call where\nthat barely questionable third party evidence is -- is\nput in in opposition to a State's case that is -- is\nwatertight -- I mean, you know, forensic evidence, all\nsorts of proof. You -- you think the two have to be\ntreated the same.\nMR. BLUME: Yes, well, I do for the following\nreason. The -- that case may make it an easy call, but\nit's still the jury's call, just for the same reason\nthat a judge couldn't, in a very strong case like that,\nsay, I'm not allowing the defendant's alibi witnesses\nto testify.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's the --\nthat's the problem. That's why this is a special\ncategory of evidence. It's not any evidence. It's\nthird party guilt evidence because that's evidence that\nany defendant could try to introduce in any case. In\nany case, the defendant can say somebody else did it\nand compile whatever kind of evidence he can get,\nwhether it's jailhouse informants or -- or whatever,\nwhere the person who did it was often somebody who's\njust recently died and -- and is not there to present\nan alibi of his own. In every case the defendant can\ncome up with this evidence, and so you have a special\nrule that's designed to deal with that.\nAnd all, it seems to me, that the State court\ndecision is saying, when you look at the prosecution's\ncase, is if -- if the prosecution's case makes that an\n-- unreasonable under the Gregory test that you agree\nwith, the reasonable inference, if it's unreasonable to\nsuggest that somebody else did it, doesn't mean that\nyou're guilty. You may have all sorts of other claims\nthat you can make, but you just don't get to present\nthat type of evidence because of the susceptibility of\nprejudice and the susceptibility of fraud and all that\nkind of stuff.\nMR. BLUME: Well, Chief Justice Roberts, I\nsubmit that that is, one, not correct factually. I\nmean, I think if anything, it's more like --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You mean on -- in\nyour case.\nMR. BLUME: Well, it's not -- it's certainly\nnot true on the facts of this case. But even as a\ngeneral proposition, I think defendants are more likely\nto get alibi witnesses to lie for them than other\npeople. But we still allow the jury, the ultimate lie\ndetector, to make that decision.\nAnd if you read the hundreds of criminal\nappeals that come out each year, this is not a big\nproblem. It doesn't come up a lot, and the law in the\n49 other jurisdictions seems to handle it. South\nCarolina is the State --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does the other side agree\nwith that? I -- I'd be surprised if that were the law\nin the other 49 jurisdictions, that the judges just\nblind themselves to the -- to the prosecution's case\nwhen they make these calls.\nMR. BLUME: I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's your authority for --\nfor the -- for opposition that every other jurisdiction\ndoes it that way?\nMR. BLUME: I think if you go through the\ncases, even in the amicus brief, filed by the State of\nKansas, they were able to come up with two decisions:\none, an unreported decision from the D.C. Circuit; and\nthe other, an intermediate decision by the California\nCourt of Appeal, which took into account the strength\nof the State's case. If you read all the other cases\nfrom all the other States or you read the articulation\nof the rules, it doesn't do that. So a judgment in Mr.\nHolmes' favor will leave the law of those States\nintact.\nBut even if --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I guess my -- my\npoint -- maybe it's some of my colleagues' point -- is\nthat really the strength of the government's case is\nsubsumed within the general calculus of whether or not\nthis would cause a delay of -- of time, whether it\nwould get into extraneous issues, et cetera.\nMR. BLUME: Well, it's -- it's not --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's a way of phrasing it.\nMR. BLUME: That's not the way the decisions,\nif you read them and read the evidence, that they work.\nBut it's -- I mean, it -- it does -- if the judge\nweighs and conditions the admissibility of evidence of\ninnocence on the ability to overcome -- and that's the\nSouth Carolina rule, overcome the prosecution's case\nand overcome it with a stacked deck where any of the\ndefendant's counter-evidence is irrelevant, it's\nimpossible. A defendant could never overcome it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We're not arguing about\nthat. I -- I don't think anybody has asked you that\nquestion. The question is whether you can consider it\nat all, and -- and you say no.\nMR. BLUME: Well, you don't have to -- you\ncan't consider it the way South Carolina is. But I\nthink it would have the -- the place -- the strength of\nthe government's case has some bearing. Or the\ngovernment's case may have some bearing -- not the\nstrength of it -- on whether the third party guilt\nevidence is relevant to some, you know, issue in the\ntrial. But it also would have some significance on the\nback end if a judge excluded it in determining whether\nany error was harmless or not. And that's traditionally\nthe place on appeal where you consider the strength of\nthe government's case.\nThere's no other category of evidence in our\nsystem where we take into account the overall strength\nof the case to admit it. If that were true, then why\ndon't we allow judges to direct verdicts? Why don't we\nallow judges to exclude defendant's testimony? Look,\nthe government's evidence is strong. The DNA evidence\nhere is overwhelming. Anything this defendant says,\nwhen he gets up there, is going to be a lie. I'm not\nallowing it. We don't do that.\nJuries in our system make credibility\ndeterminations and that's what the rule, which requires\nyou to -- where you have to weigh the defendant's\nevidence against the government's evidence, usurps the\nfunction of the jury.\nFinally, in this case the -- there is a\ncontention that the error was harmless, and I wanted to\nbriefly respond to that. Now -- and then if the Court\nhas no further questions, I will save the remainder of\n-- of my time for rebuttal.\nBut there are three principal reasons the\nerror in this case was harmless. First -- and part of\nthis I've already discussed with Justice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not -- not harmless you\nmean.\nMR. BLUME: I'm sorry. Was not harmless.\nAnd the first one I've discussed with Justice\nBreyer in response to your questions previously, that I\nthink any fair review of the record here is that the\nforensic evidence was a jump ball. Now -- and while we\ndo not contest that the evidence was sufficient to\nconvict, it certainly was not overwhelming and a\nreasonable juror could have entertained a reasonable\ndoubt as to Mr. Holmes' guilt based solely on the\nevidence at trial.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But there wasn't much\nevidence against him other than the forensic evidence.\nIsn't that right? There's just some people who saw\nhim nearby.\nMR. BLUME: There wasn't even -- yes, there\nwas some evidence that he was within a mile --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Right.\nMR. BLUME: -- or so at the time. There was\nmuch stronger evidence that Mr. White was in the area\nwhere the crime occurred, near where the crime\noccurred.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So the jury must have found\nthat forensic evidence to be very convincing.\nMR. BLUME: Well, they found him guilty based\non it, yes.\nBut, of course, that can't be the touchstone\nof whether the error was prejudicial. The State has\nthe burden of demonstrating beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat the exclusion of the third party guilt evidence\ncould not have contributed to the verdict. In this\ncase, the forensic evidence was, I submit, a jump ball.\nThe defense had --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you say in --\nyou cited us to footnote 8 in the court's opinion, and\nit says that your claims do not eliminate the fact that\n99.99 percent of the population, other than your client\nand the victim, were excluded as contributors to the\nDNA evidence that was found. Do you -- is -- is the\ncourt wrong in saying that?\nMR. BLUME: The court is right, to the extent\nthat it is citing one expert's opinion. It is wrong in\nthat it ignores that even that agent admitted that the\nDNA could have been produced through the contamination\nof Officer Mobley, through his -- through the bags. So\nthat could explain the results.\nAnd it also ignores the fact -- the footnote\ndoes -- that a defense expert, Dr. Peter D'Eustachio\nsaid that that's not a fair and accurate\nrepresentation. In my opinion, in my expert opinion,\nthere -- you cannot do any DNA calculations on this.\nThese charts are completely unreliable. So that's all\nit is, and it's -- it has, I think, no significance\nhere in light of the evidence as a whole. It's a\nfactually inaccurate statement of the record as a\nwhole.\nBut in addition to the evidence, the most --\na very significant factor in determining whether this\nerror was harmless or not is having succeeded in\nconvincing the trial judge to exclude the evidence, the\nprosecutor in his closing argument said, look, they've\nindicated that this evidence was planted. They've\nindicated this evidence was contaminated. If Bobby\nHolmes didn't do it, who is -- where is the raping,\nmurdering thing that did? So he took complete and\nunfair advantage of the absence of evidence in the\ntrial court's ruling in securing the conviction here.\nAnd this Court has said on a number of other occasions,\nin Satterwhite and Clemons, that a prosecutor's\nargument is an important factor in determining whether\nan error was harmless.\nAnd finally --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's a question on which\nwe didn't grant cert.\nMR. BLUME: You did not. I mean, we do\nbelieve it was an independent constitutional error, but\neven apart from that, it's still a factor in gauging\nharmlessness. This Court has said that on a number of\noccasions, that what is in the argument is a factor in\nharmless error.\nAnd then finally, excluding -- not allowing\nthe evidence deprived Mr. Holmes of presenting an\nalternative counter-theory. You can see a jury saying,\nwell, you know, we've heard all this. This is a bunch\nof contesting evidence, but almost asking the questions\nthe prosecutor did, which certainly they would have\nasked after it was, well, you're right. We didn't hear\nany evidence of that. Bobby Holmes had a powerful\ncounter-story. He should have been allowed to tell it.\nThe South Carolina rule is unconstitutional.\nThe judgment should be reversed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Blume.\nMr. Zelenka.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD J. ZELENKA\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. ZELENKA: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Constitution guarantees criminal\ndefendants under the Due Process Clause, Compulsory\nProcess, and Confrontation Clauses a meaningful\nopportunity to present a defense. A defendant's right\nto present relevant evidence is not unlimited, however,\nbut is rather subject to reasonable restrictions.\nState courts as rulemakers have broad\nlatitude to establish rules excluding evidence so long\nas they are not arbitrary or disproportionate.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Zelenka, do you -- do\nyou agree with the characterization that your brother\nhas given, largely by way of quotation from the opinion\nin this case, that the rule of admissibility that --\nthat the -- that the court followed in -- or that the\nsupreme court approved in this case would have required\nthe defendant to show to a degree of probability, in\nlight of all the evidence, including the forensic\nevidence, that he was innocent as a condition of -- of\nadmitting the evidence?\nMR. ZELENKA: No, I do not. I think it was\nmerely an application of the original opinion that\nrelied upon the straight -- State v. Gregory, that in\nfact it must raise a reasonable inference as to the\ndefendant's innocence.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But, well, what do you -- I\nmean, your -- your brother's strongest point is this\nstatement, and I'm quoting from page 365 of the joint\nappendix where the -- where the opinion is set out, at\n-- at the top of the page, the second sentence. He\nsimply cannot overcome the forensic evidence against\nhim to raise a reasonable inference of his own\ninnocence. What could that mean other than a\nprobability that he is innocent in light of all the\nevidence, including the forensic evidence?\nMR. ZELENKA: I think that -- that language\nwas basically a review determination as to what exactly\nhappened. I don't think that the court --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but what does it mean?\nI mean, I've given you a suggestion as to what it\nseems to mean on a straightforward reading, and -- and\nI take it you disagree with that. But can you explain\nhow it could mean something else?\nMR. ZELENKA: No, I don't disagree with the\nfact that, in fact, that is what the supreme court said\nin its analysis, looking at the particular evidence in\nthis case, that he was unable to overcome that. But I\nthink State v. Gregory didn't require that to be the\nultimate threshold that it had to meet, rather that it\nraise a reasonable inference as to his innocence.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it's -- it's true.\nWhen they -- on the -- on the previous page, the bottom\nof 364, they -- they cite -- they first quote Gregory\nand then they cite Gay and they characterize, I guess,\nthe two together as -- well, they say, in Gay, we held\nthat where there is strong evidence of an appellant's\nguilt, especially where there is strong forensic\nevidence, the proffered evidence about a third party's\nguilt does not raise a reasonable inference as to the\nappellant's own innocence. It doesn't use the word\novercome which it uses on the other page.\nMR. ZELENKA: No, it doesn't.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But even without the word\novercome, what -- what can reasonable inference of\ninnocence mean, considered in light of the other\nevidence in the case, if it doesn't mean something like\na probability of -- of innocence?\nMR. ZELENKA: It's raising a possibility. I\ndon't know what level of possibility it is other than a\nreasonable inference level, which is a level which --\nwhich means that it's subject to some belief.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But quite apart from that,\nit seems to me that the statement is questionable as an\nempirical matter. Why is it that forensic evidence\nsomehow should be used to exclude third party guilt\nevidence as -- as a universal proposition? Maybe in\nsome cases yes, maybe in some -- but this is a\nuniversal proposition.\nMR. ZELENKA: It reads certainly like a\nuniversal proposition, but I think it is merely an\napplication of what happened in State v. Gregory and\nState v. Gay when they were presented at that time in\nthose situations with what they determined to be strong\nevidence of forensic guilt --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if I were the trial\ncourt, in a subsequent case in South Carolina, I would\n-- I would have to read this instruction of the South\nCarolina Supreme Court as saying I simply could not\nadmit this evidence when there's forensic evidence.\nAnd that's a very strange proposition.\nMR. ZELENKA: I would agree that would be a\nstrange proposition because it suggests that they would\nignore the merits of -- of the proffered evidence\nitself. And I don't think that's what happened in this\ncase, and I don't think that's what the South Carolina\nSupreme Court --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Your point is that we're\nquibbling with the language. Certainly the language\ncan't be right. I mean, Gregory is quoting America --\nAm.Jur. It's totally right. And I don't -- in my\nopinion. I don't see how there's a problem. It's\nsimply a way to prevent the defendant from confusing\nthe jury with evidence that's not -- doesn't have high\nprobative value. That's -- so we --\nMR. ZELENKA: I think that's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: They don't agree with that\nnecessarily, but I'm taking that as a premise.\nMR. ZELENKA: I think that's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, he describes this, the\nwriter of the opinion, and if I hadn't been guilty of\nthis sin myself, I couldn't criticize others, but he\nuses language that's absolute. He says, where there is\nstrong evidence of an appellant's guilt, especially\nwhere there's strong forensic evidence, the proffered\nevidence about a third party's alleged guilt does not\nraise a reasonable inference as to the appellant's own\ninnocence. I took that to mean doesn't tend to show\nthat the appellant is innocent. And you do have to\nhave when faced with guilt. It's not relevant if it\ndoesn't tend to show he's innocent. So that wasn't the\nproblem.\nThe problem is that this sentence is wrong.\nYou could have incredibly strong evidence that this\nperson is guilty and it could be incredibly strong\nevidence that the other person did it.\nMR. ZELENKA: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so it should come right\nin. So what should have been there is the word\nautomatically, but the word doesn't automatically show,\nbut the word isn't there. It doesn't say automatic.\nMR. ZELENKA: It doesn't --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And he goes on to write as\nif it isn't that automatic. And he then favors you\nbecause he says the standards set out in Gregory and\nGay, as if they aren't different.\nMR. ZELENKA: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But the language says they\nare different. So what do we do?\nMR. ZELENKA: And I think we also have to\nremember that the -- the South Carolina Supreme Court\nwas viewing this simply as a matter of State common\nlaw. They weren't looking at it as a matter of Federal\nconstitutional law.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so what do we do? We\nget the -- we read the opinion literally, and moreover,\nthat's why I asked it. If you look into the evidence,\nit looks -- you know, maybe it's closer than you might\nthink. And if we start looking at the evidence of\nevery case in the United States, it's going to be a\nproblem for everybody. But -- but -- so what do we do?\nThat's my question.\nMR. ZELENKA: I -- I think we can look at a\nmuch narrower approach that also evolves out of this\nparticular judgment as determined by the trial court.\nThere was essentially a -- a lack of persuasive\nassurances of trustworthiness in the statements that\nwere, in fact, given. They lacked corroboration, the\nparticular statements that were alleged to have been\ngiven by Jimmy McCaw White, in ways similar to\nsituations where evidence should not be deemed\nrelevantly admissible because of that lack of\nreliability and trustworthiness.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not what the court\nsaid, though. The court didn't -- did -- whatever the\ncourt said, it clearly did not say just looking at the\nthird party guilt evidence by itself, it's not -- it's\nnot trustworthy. Whatever else it said, it didn't say\nthat.\nMR. ZELENKA: No, it didn't say that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. Yes. Now, you say\nthat's true. Now, it may well have been true, but that\n-- we're -- we're --\nMR. ZELENKA: The trial judge said that. The\ntrial judge said it lacked the type of corroboration.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the trial judge also\nkept it out, didn't he, because he believed there was\n-- there was no penal interest exception to the hearsay\nrule?\nMR. ZELENKA: He was -- he -- he did that\nalso, but ultimately he blended both concepts together\nand said both as a matter of substantive law and as a\nmatter of evidentiary law in the -- the final\nconclusion at the end of the State's case, when he made\nthe ultimate determination --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but then you get to\nthe --\nMR. ZELENKA: -- that it would be\ninadmissible.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm sorry. Then you get to\nthe -- the South Carolina Supreme Court, and they don't\nkeep it out on -- on grounds of -- of threshold\nreliability.\nMR. ZELENKA: They didn't specifically\naddress that. They went to their ultimate\ndetermination viewing the evidence.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And as I recall, the trial\ncourt did say that this was pretty persuasive evidence\nbut for the fact that you had to exclude some of it\nbecause that there was no exception to the hearsay\nrule. Didn't he say that?\nMR. ZELENKA: It -- they said that the\nevidence existed, that the statements --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He said more than that. I\nthink he said it was --\nMR. ZELENKA: -- there was some evidence --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well --\nMR. ZELENKA: -- that allowed for --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Your friend will tell us\nwhat he said.\nMR. ZELENKA: -- that allowed for a jury to\nmake the determination. That information was there.\nBut also, it's -- the judge found that there wasn't\nother evidence other than the statement that clearly\npointed to the defendant -- excuse me -- that clearly\npointed -- pointed to Jimmy McCaw White --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this\nquestion?\nMR. ZELENKA: -- as being guilty of the\ncrime.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Supposing -- I've written a\nfair number of opinions involving criminal cases where\nI've had to say that we take all the inferences\nfavorable to the prosecution, and based on that rule,\nwe find there's sufficient evidence to justify the\njury's verdict. How we would have decided it is not\nbefore us. We accept the jury's verdict.\nWhat if the -- on the merits of the\nunderlying crimes, the South Carolina Supreme Court had\nwritten that kind of an opinion rather than there's\noverwhelming evidence of guilt? Do you think they\nwould have held the third party evidence admissible or\ninadmissible?\nMR. ZELENKA: I think they would have still\nheld the third party evidence inadmissible because of\nthe lack of corroboration. It lacked that requirement\nof reliability to get over --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it's odd that they\ndidn't say that. Their -- the reasons they gave were\nthat the evidence of guilt was overwhelming.\nMR. ZELENKA: And they gave that immediately\nafter they had issued their prior opinion in -- in\nState v. Gay where they looked at a case where, again,\nthey found overwhelming forensic evidence of guilt as\ndefeating the probative value of the defendant's\npresentation. And trial counsel --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Zelenka, do you agree\nthat all 49 other States do not look at the -- at the\nweight of the prosecution's case when making this\ndecision?\nMR. ZELENKA: No, I -- I do not agree with\nthat. And -- and we've cited in our brief Kansas v.\nAdams. We -- we do not analyze those cases to make a\ndetermination as to what the trial judges and the other\nState courts did not look at. We think it's implicit,\nin fact, in most situations, that you have to consider\nto some extent the State's evidence to determine the\nreliability of the nature of the third party guilt\nevidence which comes in. You have to have --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Could you use --\nMR. ZELENKA: -- some understanding of that\nevidence.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Could -- could you use the\nsame rule with respect to alibi evidence? The trial\njudge would say this evidence for the prosecution is so\nstrong, I'm not going to let any alibi evidence in. Is\nthere -- is there anything special about third party\nguilt? Couldn't -- couldn't you use -- use it for\nother defenses?\nMR. ZELENKA: I think there is something\nspecial about third party guilt. Alibi is merely the\ndefendant saying I didn't do it and I wasn't there when\nthe crime was done. I think in third party guilt\nevidence you're diverting the case off in another\ndirection that requires some special attention by the\ncourts, and I think most States recognize it requires\nspecial attention by the court because it's hitting on\na collateral issue requiring the State to prove or, to\nsome extent, disprove that another individual did it,\nan individual that might not be subject to notice\nrequirements, an individual that might not even be\nalive. We look at -- you can look at the -- this\nCourt's decision in Donnelly v. the United States, a\n1911 decision, that recognized there's something\ndifferent about third party guilt potential evidence\nbecause of the inherent unreliability which may exist\nin the manner and the way it was presented.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Can -- can a trial judge\nexclude defense evidence based on credibility\ndeterminations?\nMR. ZELENKA: No. I don't -- I don't think\nthey can.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that -- but isn't that\nwhat happened here?\nMR. ZELENKA: No. I think -- I think this\ncourt excluded it on the basis of reliability\ndeterminations, whether in fact there was sufficient\ncorroboration for what the individual was saying in the\nstatement. The trial judge found that the information\nthat was purported to be said by Jimmy McCaw White was\nsomething that was generally known within the community\nas a whole.\nJUSTICE ALITO: How could -- how could court\nconclude that the State's evidence was strong without\nmaking -- without finding, in effect, that the State's\nforensic witnesses were credible?\nMR. ZELENKA: I think they could evaluate the\nevidence in the manner that it -- that it was presented\nto them to get an indicia as to whether there is any\nreasonable reliability to the third party guilt\nevidence.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Just take, for example, the\n-- the palm print. The chief Mobley said he found it\nin -- in the apartment, and that would be very strong\nevidence, if in fact that was the case. But his\ncredibility was contested. So how can you conclude\nthat the palm print is strong evidence for the\nprosecution without implicitly making a determination,\na credibility determination?\nMR. ZELENKA: Well, I think that type of\nevaluation, we believe, necessarily needs to be done to\nmake a determination to the -- to the probative value\nor the prejudicial value to the presentation of the\nthird party guilt evidence of -- of the defendant, that\nall those matters need to be looked at as to whether,\nin fact, it should come in.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But then the court is making\n--\nMR. ZELENKA: If there was just the palm\nprint --\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- the court is excluding\ndefense evidence based on a finding that a prosecution\nwitness is credible.\nMR. ZELENKA: No. I don't think that's the\ntest, and I don't think that's what they were doing in\nthis case. They were making that -- viewing that\ninformation to determine whether the presentation was\nreliable that was being presented, whether there was\nsome substance actually to what was being given, and\nwhether leaving that information out would have\ndeprived him of a meaningful right to present relevant\nevidence in his defense.\nJUSTICE ALITO: On the other side, if\nWestbrook was credible, isn't that strong evidence for\nthe defense?\nMR. ZELENKA: The -- the -- it's -- it's\nevidence for the defense, but it's evidence for the\ndefense that lacked the sense of reliability. And it\nlacked --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But if he's credible that\nWhite confessed to him --\nMR. ZELENKA: He -- he --\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- then wouldn't that be\nstrong evidence for the defense?\nMR. ZELENKA: It's some evidence for the\ndefense, but the problem is it lacked corroboration.\nIt wasn't given in a timely manner. If you contrast\nthat to the situation which occurred in Chambers v.\nMississippi, there was an entire information that the\nChambers situation had independent of the third party\nstatement which supported and showed that that\ninformation did have persuasive assurances of\nreliability. That was lacking in this particular case.\nI see my time is about up, but I would --\nJUSTICE THOMAS: Counsel, before you change\nsubjects, isn't it more accurate that the trial court\nactually found that the evidence met the Gregory\nstandard?\nMR. ZELENKA: No. He specifically found, I\nbelieve, from my reading --\nJUSTICE THOMAS: Well, he says --\nMR. ZELENKA: -- that it didn't meet the\nGregory standard.\nJUSTICE THOMAS: Well, he says at first\nblush, the above arguably rises to the Gregory\nstandard. However, the engine that drives the train in\nthis Gregory analysis is the confession by Jimmy McCaw\nWhite. And then he goes on to say that that, of\ncourse, can't be introduced because it's hearsay. So\nit -- it seems as though he says that if it is to be\nbelieved what Jimmy White says, it meets the Gregory\nstandard.\nSo I don't quite understand where Gay, which\nis subsequent to -- to this case -- where Gay comes in\nbecause it didn't seem to be the standard that the\ntrial court applied.\nMR. ZELENKA: Actually Gay was -- two things.\nGay was not the standard when the trial judge made the\npretrial hearing. Gay was -- was the standard at the\ntime the case was tried, and the trial judge was\naddressing that standard and he found that Gay was not\nsatisfied because he didn't believe that there was\nevidence which clearly pointed to the defendant --\nexcuse me -- to the third party as being guilty of the\nparticular crime. He made that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excluding the confession.\nExcluding the confession.\nMR. ZELENKA: Other than that information in\nthe confession, which he had also found previously\nlacked appropriate corroboration at the trial --\npretrial hearing as evidenced within his written order.\nI would also like to preserve the ability to\nargue harmless error, as we've done in our case to some\nextent. The South Carolina Supreme Court's opinion was\na harmless error analysis, but more importantly, in\naddition, that -- that we do not believe and continue\nto assert that the matter wasn't properly preserved\nbefore this Court based upon the manner and only the\nmanner that it was raised before the South Carolina\nSupreme Court in the direct appeal briefs.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nZelenka.\nMr. Johnson.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF STEFFEN N. JOHNSON\nON BEHALF OF KANSAS, ET AL.,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMR. JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nIn my time today, I'd like to focus on two\nbasic issues.\nThe first is that this case does not approach\nthe outer limit of due process set by this Court in\nChambers. As the trial court found in three specific\ninstances, there is no evidence to corroborate these\nconfessions. And the confession evidence itself in\nChambers was far stronger than the confession evidence\nin this case.\nSecond, I'd like to respond to Justice\nBreyer's question about the nature of the Supreme Court\nof Carolina's opinion and to remind the Court that it's\nreviewing the judgment primarily, not the opinion. And\nit seems to me that Petitioner's argument is\nessentially criticizing the opinion for the absence of\na word, the absence of the word automatically, and that\nthe opinion would look very different if it said where\nthere's strong evidence of guilt, the defendant's third\nparty guilt evidence doesn't automatically raise a\nreasonable inference of innocence.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. And I -- I take it\nwhat you will do, in the course of your second point,\nis tell us the answer to this question, that if we do\nnot accept the overcome by reasonable inference\nformulation that is here, what would be an acceptable\nformulation because I think that's what you -- you say\nyou're getting to. But that would be very helpful to\nus.\nMR. JOHNSON: We -- we believe that the raise\na reasonable inference of innocence standard, as the\ncounsel for South Carolina said, does not necessarily\nrequire that it be the only inference --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, one of the problems is\nI don't know what it requires. On -- on the -- on the\nsecond page of the opinion that I quoted, it is used\nwith the word overcome, which certainly suggests that\nit is supposed to raise a probability of innocence in\nlight of all the evidence. Sometimes it is used\nwithout overcome, as it was earlier in the opinion. I\ndon't know what they mean by inference. Do they mean\nevidence from which one might reasonably conclude, from\nwhich one -- there is a reasonable possibility of\nconcluding? I just don't know what the terms mean. So\nI hope you'll give us a suggested formulation with --\nwith terms that -- that are defined that -- that you\nand the States that you represent would -- would think\nwas an acceptable and constitutional standard.\nMR. JOHNSON: And I think your formulation is\nactually a fair one. Does it raise some --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I included several.\nWhich -- which one --\nMR. JOHNSON: The second one, does it raise\nsome reasonable possibility of innocence. In other\nwords, if you believe this evidence --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. JOHNSON: -- does it raise a reasonable\npossibility of innocence, not -- not that it's the most\nlikely or the only possibility from that evidence.\nAnd I think if you look at the South Carolina\nSupreme Court's opinion carefully, in light of the --\nthe supreme court's decisions in Gregory and Gay, you\nsee that in fact what the court was doing was simply\nsaying this case is like Gay. There's strong evidence.\nWe're going to look at the evidence on both sides.\nAnd there's a -- there is certainly language in the\nopinion that makes it sound like an automatic or\ncategorical rule, but in fact, they did go on to look\nat the defendant's evidence.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Has anybody else looked at\nthe evidence on both sides?\nMR. JOHNSON: The trial court certainly\nlooked at the defendant's evidence.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Other States I mean. Other\nStates.\nMR. JOHNSON: Yes, Your Honor. I think that\nit would be fair to say that -- that any of the nine\nStates collected in our appendix whose standard is does\nthe evidence raise a reasonable inference of innocence\nlook at those sorts of questions.\nIn addition, we collected, I believe, four\ncases in our brief, in addition to the California Court\nof Appeal and the D.C. Circuit's opinion in Cabrera.\nThere's the Kansas v. Adams case which very clearly\nlooks at the State evidence. In that case, the issue\nwas the defendant was on trial for shaking his baby to\ndeath, and the medical evidence of the prosecution\nshowed that the death took place within a certain time\nperiod. The defendant wanted to introduce evidence\nthat his wife --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we -- can we just back\nup to Cabrera? The D.C. Circuit did not publish that\nand --\nMR. JOHNSON: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and unless the rule has\nchanged, it didn't have -- it didn't have any\nprecedential effect -- those opinions that they did not\nput in the Federal Reports.\nMR. JOHNSON: I think its reasoning stands on\nits own, Your Honor. But in addition to that case, you\nhave these other three published cases, and we stand by\nthe description of them in our argument.\nKansas v. Adams was a case where the court\nsaid the issue -- the State's evidence shows this baby\ndied within a certain time period, and although the\nwife had a history of violence against the child, the\ncourt said it's not getting in because it's -- there's\nno evidence that she had access to the child during the\nrelevant time period. That's a very clear example.\nThere are other examples.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose there had been\nevidence that the time of death testimony had been\ncontrived, planted, fabricated. Then what? Or suppose\nthat was the allegation of the defense.\nMR. JOHNSON: I -- I think it would be within\nthe -- the trial court's discretion to exclude it. I\ncertainly don't think it would necessarily violate the\ndue process --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But if he did, he would be\nmaking a credibility determination, wouldn't he? He\nwould be deciding an issue that normally would be\nsubmitted to the jury.\nMR. JOHNSON: It's not our position, Your\nHonor, that -- that the trial court can make\ncredibility determinations, but --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the example that\nJustice Kennedy gave you was such a determination.\nMR. JOHNSON: I -- I think, though -- I -- I\nsuppose that would depend on the nature of the specific\nevidence at issue. If you look at the evidence --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why wasn't it in the baby-\nshaking case?\nMR. JOHNSON: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why was there no credibility\ndetermination made in the baby-shaking case you just\ndescribed? Didn't -- didn't you have to conclude that\nthe evidence concerning the time of death was -- was\ncredible, was accurate?\nMR. JOHNSON: I -- I think, Your Honor, that\nthe trial judge found that -- that there simply wasn't\na dispute about that, that -- that the -- that there\nwasn't enough. And so it was fine to look at the\nState's case. And I would urge the Court --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But there is a dispute here\nas to the forensic evidence. The suggestion is it's\nplanted.\nMR. JOHNSON: That's correct, Your Honor, and\n-- and we would -- we would simply urge the Court not\nto adopt a categorical rule that it's inappropriate to\nlook at the State's case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What do I do in this case?\nI'm totally with you if I read American Jurisprudence\nand others as saying the following. Judge, there's a\nparticular kind of evidence that really has a tendency\nto mislead the jury, that's that somebody else did it\nbecause they start trying the other person in their\nminds. So if you have a strong case that this guy did\nit, don't let them even introduce that evidence unless\nyou have some reason to think it's really going to show\nthis guy didn't do it. That's what it's saying, isn't\nit?\nMR. JOHNSON: Yes, and -- and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, that gets us\nthrough Gregory. And the difficulty here is that the\ncourt went on to say something that couldn't possibly\nbe true, which is if you have a strong case against\nthis guy, never admit this other thing. That couldn't\nbe right.\nMR. JOHNSON: And that's why --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so now what do I do with\nthat particularly? Because the other side has said, by\nthe way, this is that case.\nMR. JOHNSON: And that's why I would\nemphasize the trial court's findings in this case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The trial court's findings\n-- I read them the way Justice Thomas did.\nMR. JOHNSON: It's very clear. This is at\npages 136 and 137 of the joint appendix, page 140 of\nthe joint appendix, and again at pages 252 and 253 of\nthe joint appendix. The trial court said there is\nnothing to corroborate these confessions.\nNow, contrast Chambers --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: On that, could a\nprosecutor have gotten this case -- gotten an\nindictment against White on the basis that he had four\nwitnesses who put him in the proximity of the crime,\nfour who said that they heard him confess? On the\nbasis of that evidence, could White have been indicted\nfor this?\nMR. JOHNSON: Possibly --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And -- and also throw in\none more thing, the victim's description of the\nassailant. So if -- if White could have been indicted\nfor this crime and -- and yet the jury is not allowed\nto hear that evidence, that sounds passing strange to\nme.\nMR. JOHNSON: Possibly that evidence would be\nsufficient to support an indictment, Your Honor, but I\ndon't believe it would be sufficient to support a\nconviction.\nAnd I also think that it's -- it's -- we're\ntalking about the outer limits of due process here. If\nyou look at the evidence in Chambers, the corroboration\nevidence there was extensive. There was a witness who\nsaid I saw the third party shoot the victim.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Surely, you're not arguing\nthe third party evidence can only come in if it's proof\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. You're not arguing that\nstandard, are you?\nMR. JOHNSON: No. No.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you did say it wouldn't\nbe enough to convict.\nMR. JOHNSON: Right, Your Honor, and -- and\nthat -- that might present a different case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't --\nMR. JOHNSON: But -- but that evidence --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You said it was enough to\nindict and that very same evidence is put before the\njury, but it wouldn't be enough to convict?\nMR. JOHNSON: I'm saying, Your Honor, that\nthe evidence here clearly isn't strong enough to meet\nthe standard for due process, quite apart from whether\nit's enough to support an indictment or a conviction.\nAnd if you compare it with the evidence in Chambers,\nthat's very clear where there was eyewitness testimony\nof the shooting itself. There was eyewitness testimony\nthat the third party was at the scene of the crime with\nthe gun in his hand. There was -- there was testimony\nfrom the gun dealer that he sold the person the type of\ncrime at issue -- the type of gun at issue both before\nand after the offense. The confession itself, in\ncontrast to the evidence here, was a sworn statement.\nThere was not even any dispute as to whether the -- the\nconfession was made. The only dispute was whether the\nevidence of the confession was true.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Johnson, your -- your\ncitation of the -- of the portion of the -- of the\ntrial court opinion, which says that there was no\ncorroboration of the -- of the confession, that was not\nstated in -- to say, and therefore, the confessions\nwere weak evidence. That point was made in order to\nsay, therefore, the confession cannot be admitted\nbecause the -- the rule was it's hearsay, but hearsay\nthat's corroborated can be admitted. So I think you're\nmisdescribing the --\nMR. JOHNSON: No, I -- if I may answer.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Please.\nMR. JOHNSON: I understand that, Your Honor.\nIt was part of the hearsay analysis, but it's a\nnarrower ground that's -- that's fully supportable by\nthe record for affirmance because it distinguishes the\nevidence in Chambers.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nJohnson.\nMr. Blume, you have 2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. BLUME\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BLUME: May it please the Court:\nThe trial judge in this case found, if you\nwant to go -- he found there was sufficient evidence\nfrom which the jury could find that Jimmy White was in\nthe area at the time. The trial judge -- that's on\njoint appendix page 134.\nOn 135, he also found there was sufficient\nevidence from which a jury could believe that Jimmy\nWhite confessed to being the perpetrator, and there was\nsufficient evidence from which a jury could conclude\nthat Jimmy White had in the past committed acts against\nwomen.\nAnd then he made the mistake of fact and a\nmistake of law. He treated White as unavailable and\ntherefore he excluded the statement made. That was\nwrong. White was available. Under South Carolina law,\nhe should have been able to have been called. He could\nhave been impeached, and the prior -- these statements\nwould come in as substantive evidence.\nIt was also wrong, even as the statement gets\npenal interest. The only corroboration is was the\nstatement made, not is it true. That's the -- and in\nthat case, he found the statements were made. And\nthat's why the State supreme court did not embrace or\nrely upon what the trial court did because it was\nclearly wrong.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does your -- your\ncase hinge upon your challenge to the DNA evidence? In\nother words, if you don't have the suggestion that the\nDNA evidence was manipulated, would you agree that in\nthat case the third party guilt evidence could be kept\nout?\nMR. BLUME: No. I -- I think it might be\nharmless at that point. Any error excluding might be\nharmless. But the third party guilt evidence\ninferentially and directly says, you know, this DNA\nisn't all it's cracked up to be.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why would it be\n-- I mean, if it meets the standard for harmless, it\nsuggests that it didn't make a difference, would not\nhave been likely to make a difference with the jury,\nand therefore it could have been excluded in the first\ninstance.\nMR. BLUME: No. I just think it might be\nthat it was then -- the error might not have been\nprejudicial in context of the record as a whole.\nBut a jury could still, looking at the third party\nguilt evidence say, well, you know, this DNA isn't all\nit's cracked up to be. There's nothing sacrosanct\nabout DNA or forensic evidence.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, isn't that\nexactly what the rule is designed to prevent? In other\nwords, you have no challenge to the DNA evidence, and\nyet you bring up some third party guilt evidence. And\nyour suggestion just now is, well, the jury might think\nmaybe there's not that much to the DNA evidence.\nMR. BLUME: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, it\ngets them off on a detour, distracts their attention\nfrom the evidence that is before them.\nMR. BLUME: And the jury might be absolutely\nright about that, and it's their determination to make.\nIt might be that they don't challenge the DNA evidence\nbecause the trial judge didn't give them funds to do\nit. In this case they did it because a Washington,\nD.C. law firm essentially was able to provide funds for\nthem to really look at and challenge the inadequacies\nin this evidence.\nIt's that -- the problem is that even if you\ndon't read the opinion like we do -- and we think it's\nthe only fair reading -- there's no question that the\nSouth Carolina rule requires you to overcome it and it\nstacks the deck.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
