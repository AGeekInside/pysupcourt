BRINKMANN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. BRINKMANN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThe ruling of the Illinois Appellate Court\nin this case radically expanded the Court's\noperational-function tax. The State tax at issue\nviolates the principles of constitutional limitations on\nstate taxing authority for at least two reasons.\nFirst, the factors relied on by the appellate court here\nfor functional -- for operational function would mean\nthat ownership and investment would meet that standard.\nBut that's what this Court rejected in Allied-Signal.\nA State does not have the authority to reach\nout to tax all investments owned by a company that does\nbusiness in the State. The operational function demands\nmore. It applies --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You are saying to me, Ms.\nBrinkmann -- we talk about an asset, an investment.\nThis was one company. This -- it's strange to talk\nabout unitary basis or investment. This is a division\nof one company. And we are talking about a sale of\nassets. Not the sale of stock of a subsidiary.\nSo what more is there than this is one\ncompany, it sells some of its assets?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Well, Your Honor, the fact\nthat it's a division does not mean that it meets either\nthe operational-function test or the unitary-business\ntest. A long line of cases from this Court tell us\nthat. It --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we have any cases --\ndo we have any decisions that go against the state\ntaxing authority that involve divisions as opposed to\nsubsidiaries?\nMS. BRINKMANN: No, but the Exxon case\ninvolved divisions, and it went in favor of the state\ntaxing authority. But the Court applied a\nstraightforward, unitary business analysis to that.\nAnd, Your Honor, this dates back to the Adams Express\ncase of 1897.\nThe Court in that case said it's not\nownership. It's about the use, the unitariness of use,\nnot of ownership. Mobile followed on that. Mobile\ntalked about the fact that it's not the corporate form\nthat mattered. It pointed out that that could have\nlittle to do with the underlying determination of\napportionment, which depends upon whether it's a\ndiscrete business enterprise.\nAnd then following on the heels of that\nanalysis in Mobil, the Court applied it to the Exxon\ncase that involved divisions. That was a vertically\nintegrated corporation. It's very different from the\nfacts of this case, and it reached a different result.\nMoreover, the Woolworth case involved\nsubsidiaries. Three out of the four of them were 100\npercent wholly owned.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Can I go back to sort of a\nfundamental question I'm not quite sure I know the\nanswer to. Supposing we don't have corporations here,\nbut an individual resident of New York owned this whole\nbusiness and a big bunch of it was activities in\nIllinois, and he sold the business. Would Illinois have\nthe authority to impose any tax on that transaction?\nMS. BRINKMANN: If it was a capital gain,\nYour Honor, on the sale of investment, the Court's\nlongstanding cases teach that it is the domicile that\ntaxes that commercial gain.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm assuming it's not the\ndomicile. The owner lives in New York. The business is\nall over the country, but does millions of dollars of\nbusiness in Illinois. And they sell the whole business.\nWould the owner be subject to any tax of any kind in\nIllinois on that transaction? Could he constitutionally\nbe subjected to any tax?\nBRINKMANN: If there was -- the domiciliary\nState generally is the State which has the authority to\ntax an income on a capital gain --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Assume it's not the\ndomiciliary State.\nMS. BRINKMANN: But what the Court explained\nin Mobil, for example, if it is under the unitary\nbusiness principle, then the State in which --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Could we get an answer\nwithout reference to cases? Do you think Illinois would\nhave the authority to impose a tax on that transaction?\nMS. BRINKMANN: If the -- there was\nsufficient nexus to the company doing business --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Millions of dollars of\nbusiness in Illinois, that's my assumption.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes, they would be able to\ntax the ongoing business activity in that State.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Could they tax the sale of\nthe business?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I have the same --\nMS. BRINKMANN: The sale of the business\nwould be to the domicile of the seller. They would be\nable to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You're saying only the\ndomicile could impose a tax?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes, unless, as the Court\nrecognized in Mobil, there is this unitary business\nexception, because the State's ability to tax begins at\nthe starting point at the territorial limitations of the\nState. And the Court has --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But if they owned a truck\ninstead of a business, they could tax that transaction,\nI suppose?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You can't have a unitary\nbusiness -- a person who is a unitary business. I mean,\na person can't be unitary with Exxon. I mean, when you\nspeak of a unitary business you're talking about a\ncorporation which, you know, is unitary with another\ncorporation.\nMS. BRINKMANN: That's the area --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Once you put it into a\npersonal taxation scheme, it seems to me the whole\nunitary business notion has no application at all.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Well, I agree with you, Your\nHonor. But it does come back to the taxing, the right\nof the domicile State to tax on a sale --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What is -- what does the\ndomicile State -- we have Ohio. But you say as a matter\nof constitutional law, not State tax policy, as a matter\nof constitutional law, the only State that has authority\nto tax the capital gain is Ohio?\nMS. BRINKMANN: That's right, Your Honor,\nunless --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Does Ohio -- would Ohio\ngive credit for the tax that its sister State thinks is\ndue? What is, in fact, Ohio's tax law in this respect?\nDoes Ohio give credit to taxes paid by other States --\nto other States?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Ohio would allocate the\nentire gain as a capital gain on an intangible that was\nsold in the State of Ohio. That would be allocated in\nits entirety to Illinois.\nNow, what the Court has recognized is that\ndefault principle sometimes gives way when that gain has\nhad enough connection to business activity in another\njurisdiction. That's where these issues arise, because\nthere are States taxing multi- state activities. And\nthat's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can I have an answer to a\nvery simple question? If Illinois claimed the tax,\nwould Ohio give credit for the tax paid in Illinois?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Not if Ohio had the\nconstitutional right to allocate that tax to Ohio, as it\ndoes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we know what -- what\nOhio does in these situations?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes. It allocates it to the\nState of Ohio. The only exception for that would be in\na situation, not the facts here, but if that capital\ngain either served an operational function to the\nbusiness activities that were conducted in another\nState, then that State would have a right to apportion\nit and tax its portion of that or if the operational\nfunction applied. And that is because the activity now\nhas transformed from just a capital gain that's\nconnected to the domiciliary State of the seller to a\nbusiness income because it is part of this unitary\nbusiness. That's why the other State has a right to\napportion.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What has Ohio done --\nMS. BRINKMANN: That's not the situation\nhere.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What has Ohio done up to\nthis point with respect to this transaction?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Under Ohio's laws this would\nbe allocated to that State.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To Ohio?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes, because it's a capital\ngain on a sale of an investment.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Brinkmann, you\nbegin your brief by saying this, a paper company, that\nhappens to own a data processing company. Why couldn't\nyou equally say this is a data processing company that\nhappens to own a paper company?\nMS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor. This has\nbeen a paper company since 1846.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, and\nLexis/Nexis has been a data processing company since\nwhenever.\nMS. BRINKMANN: But under the Court's\nunitary --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not the\noldest -- whichever is oldest isn't the one that gets to\nbe regarded as the dominant partner, is it?\nMS. BRINKMANN: No. But when you do the\nanalysis, you're looking at the taxpayer, which is Mead\nCorporation. And it clearly has a --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is General Electric\na light bulb company or, since it owns NBC, a media\ncompany.\nMS. BRINKMANN: I would have to know many\nmore facts in order to answer that questions, Your\nHonor. But I -- and I don't mean to be evasive --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why isn't the answer\nboth? Why isn't the answer both, just as here it is\nboth a paper or office supply company and a Lexis/Nexis,\nelectronic data company?\nMS. BRINKMANN: It's an analytical construct\nthat we're doing here. We're looking at the taxpayer\nwho is being taxed, the Mead Corporation. So you look\nat its business that's being conducted in Illinois.\nThey have a unitary paper company that's vertically\nintegrated that's doing business activities in Illinois.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's because\nthey sell paper in Illinois?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Lexis sells\ndata services in Illinois, too.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes. But when you're\nlooking -- and for both purposes, Your Honor, for State\ntax on the operating income of both of those businesses,\nIllinois does have a right to apportion those taxes.\nAnd those taxes were paid without objection by both of\nthose businesses.\nWe're talking about a tax on a different\nevent, on a capital gain on a sale of the business in\nOhio.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why doesn't --\nI mean, you just said, as I understand it, Illinois has\nthe right to tax Lexis under business activities in\nIllinois. Illinois would argue the reason it has a\ncapital gain is partly because they were doing business\nin Illinois and so we should be entitled to part of that\ncapital gain. Almost -- I mean, it seems to me it would\nbe pretty easy if they get to tax 2 percent of Lexis's\nbusiness, well then maybe they should get 2 percent of\nthe capital gain when it's sold or tax 2 percent.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, that is a\nbelated argument that the State of Illinois has raised\nin this Court. It did not present an argument to the\nIllinois appellate court based on Lexis/Nexis's\nconnection to Illinois. It raises a host of\njurisdictional, procedural and substantive bars.\nUnder the rules of Illinois, as we point out\nin our reply brief, that argument is waived. This comes\nto the Court from a State court, not a Federal court of\nappeals. Because of that waiver, it's an independent\nand adequate state ground.\nMoreover, that argument wasn't raised in the\nbrief in opposition, either.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They're raising it in --\nin support of the judgment. So if it's novel, but it\nsupports the judgment, then at least shouldn't the\nIllinois courts have a chance to look at it and say, oh,\nthat's what we really meant, we just got -- explained it\nthe wrong way?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Well, that would certainly\nbe a matter for the Illinois court rather than for this\nCourt, Your Honor. But in addition, I think any\ndisposition on the merits of that issue would be a\nruling by this Court that would be trumping that\nindependent and adequate State ground waiver.\nMoreover, this argument wasn't raised in the\nbrief in opposition, either. And the Court's precedent,\nof course, and practice would not be to address that.\nParticularly in this case, it denied notice to the amici\nwho would be affected by this argument.\nBut turning to the substance of it --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I think this is part of\nthe substance. I thought that as part of one of your\nanswers you said that Ohio is free to allocate part of\nthis capital gains tax to Illinois? Did I hear you say\nthat, because I don't understand that?\nMS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor, I'm sorry.\nI apologize if I misspoke. Ohio would allocate, I mean,\ntake the entire gain for itself as the domicile State of\nthe seller --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I see.\nMS. BRINKMANN: -- of the investment. In\nother factual scenarios, if it turns out that that asset\nactually was not an investment and in fact had enough\nconnection to the business activities in Illinois\nbecause it was really the supplier of the raw materials,\nor the two examples that this Court has given as\noperational functions is the interest on the bank\naccount, which is the working capital, or the -- the\nfutures hedging against the raw material of corn.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, isn't it kind\nof like futures hedging? I mean, you've got a paper\ncompany and then you've got something that is sort of\nthe paperless aspect, and they can look at it and say,\nwell, we're kind of hedging our paper business by\ninvesting heavily in something that's supposedly going\nto take away the need for paper.\nMS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor. Under the\noperational function test, it has to be a much closer\nnexus to the operating, the operations of the paper\ncompany; and short of that operational function -- or if\nit were part of the unitary business, the domiciliary\nState would allocate. And if I could turn --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you saying this is a\npassive investment?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: How can you call it a\npassive investment, not only when there was -- I think\nundisputedly -- as -- as much interest and activity in\nNexis's business planning by the Mead people? But to my\nmind even more importantly, when in fact Mead, I think a\ncouple of times, merged with -- with Nexis -- with Lexis\n-- when that provided a tax advantage, by -- by giving\nthem loss carryforwards that reduced their taxes. Why\nisn't it fair to -- to say under the operational\nfunction test that if -- if the company is -- if Nexis\nis -- is mergeable with Mead when it produces a tax\nadvantage and is certainly in a very operational sense\nfunctional then, because it's saving them a lot of\nmoney -- and that's, that has nothing to do with passive\ninvestment. If it's usable in a merger scenario there,\nit ought when the -- when the tide turns be -- be\nregarded as close enough in operational function to be\ntaxable when the gain comes in.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, that's contrary\nto the Court's long-standing recognition that something\nthat enriches the taxpayer is not necessarily part of\nthe unitary business's operational function.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's -- that's right.\nBut weren't the enrichment cases in which income was\nbeing generated by an investment? The investor, of\ncourse, was the -- was the taxpayer company, and it\nsimply reaped the benefits of a profitable investment.\nThat's something very different from merging\ncorporations, then unmerging them, and then merging them\nagain to provide not merely enrichment, but great tax\nsavings; and if they are operationally close enough to\nproduce great tax savings, why shouldn't they be treated\nas operationally close enough when in fact they -- they\nproduce a capital gain?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Because that isn't the\noperational connection that justifies a State --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The gain alone certainly is\nnot. If they had absolutely done nothing but make their\ninvestment and wait to see whether the ship came in, I\nwould understand your argument. But between the\ninvestment and the return of the ship, they were merging\nthese corporations back and forth for -- for their --\nfor Mead's tax advantage. And that seems to me to take\nit out -- take the facts of this case out of the sort of\nthe paradigm of the -- the operational or the\nnonoperational function cases.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, I think not, if\nwe look at Allied-Signal, we look at Woolworth, and we\nlook at ASARCO. Allied-Signal was a sales and\ninvestment -- and getting back to the point about the\nargument really was waived about the connection with\nLexis/Nexis in Illinois, those were the same facts in\nAllied-Signal. The investment there was --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It was a sale of stock in\nthat case, wasn't it?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It was the sale of a\nsubsidiary. And here we have a sale of assets of one\ncompany, and that's why it's so hard for me to see this,\nas, why are we talking about unitary or not? There is\nonly one company; it's Mead.\nMS. BRINKMANN: In Allied-Signal, the\ninvestment there was also doing business within the\nState. In the Exxon case, there were divisions to which\nthis Court applied the entire unitary business\nprinciple, because what the Court has said repeatedly in\nMobil, in Exxon, in all these cases, it's not the\ncorporate form; it is whether there is a discrete\nbusiness enterprise; and ASARCO speaks to this.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You told me that there\nwas no case that the tax -- taxing authority lost that\ninvolved divisions of a single company and sale of\nassets, rather than the sale of stock.\nMS. BRINKMANN: That's correct. We have\nfour or five cases here. One of them does involve\ndivisions, Exxon, but in that case it was a vertically\nintegrated corporation, and the State prevailed in that\ncase, but it did not change the analysis that applied.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, we're talking about\nwhat Due Process permits States to do, and you're asking\nus to declare a restriction that, as far as I know, has\nnever been declared in any case.\nMS. BRINKMANN: It has, Your Honor. It goes\nback to principles that ownership do -- does not\ndetermine; simply because there is a business operating\nin the State, the State does not have the right to tax\nevery investment that's owned by that. That dates back\nto 1897.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's not just that it's\nan investment, it's not just that it's holding on to the\nshares in another company. It's both of these are\nongoing businesses, Lexis/Nexis and Mead, and they are\nboth generating income, and all along Illinois has been\ntaxing the income of both of them, right?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes, the operating income\nwithin the State's apportioned. But if you look to the\nbusiness activity of the taxpayer Mead, operating in\nIllinois, it is that nexus on which Illinois is claiming\nthat they have a right to tax here. And if we look at\nthe Woolworth case, for example, I think that is also\ninstructive. Those were four subsidiaries. Three of\nthem were 100 percent wholly owned, and the Court\nexpressly said we recognize they are wholly owned\nsubsidiaries. These could be integrated divisions, and\nthey said, that is not significant, if they are\nindependent, different business enterprises.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Weren't those foreign\ncorporations?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So running them as -- as\na single company would have been a little harder.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Well, no, in fact there were\nalso some foreign subsidiaries, I believe, involved in\nthe ASARCO case, for example, Your Honor, and the same\nanalysis applied -- you know, whether it was vertically\nintegrated and whether or not it met -- the unitary\nbusiness test goes back to three core principles, and\nthis Court has said at least four if not five times that\nthe unitary business principle is the linchpin of\napportionment. That is whether or not there is\nfunctional integration.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Don't we start -- I don't\nmean to cut off your argument, but don't we start with\nthe assumption that this is not a unitary business?\nWasn't that the finding of the trial court which was not\ndisturbed on appeal?\nMS. BRINKMANN: That's right, Your Honor.\nThat's right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You can say it if you want,\nbut I wanted to make sure --\nMS. BRINKMANN: There is no virtual\nintegration; there is no sharing of centralized\nmanagement; there's no economies of scale. We think\nthis is unassailable in the stipular record --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Am I thinking about that\npart correctly? I -- I found this difficult. I go back\nto the railroad; that seems the easiest case. You have\na railroad in 50 States, and Illinois finds it very hard\nto evaluate its -- evaluate its value, its railroad\nproperty in Illinois, because the value of that depends\non service everywhere. So the court says that's the\nunitary principle; and really what you're supposed to\nlook at is whether when you look at the supposedly\nseparate part of the business, does that separate part\nof the business contribute to the whole thing? So that\nif you were in fact trying to say what is Illinois doing\nwithout considering that separate part, it would be\ntough to do.\nI mean, that's the underlying theme.\nMS. BRINKMANN: We would --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if that's so, there is\nno second test. I mean, I grant you there is language,\nbut really what people have done is they've said, we are\nhere in a special situation because we have an interest\nin another company, and that's a special part of our\nbusiness, and has nothing to do with the rest of the\nbusiness. And then the argument is no, it does have\nsomething to do with the rest of the business. And if\nit does, like it provides you with working capital, it's\njust like the railroad track in California vis-a-vis\nIllinois.\nMS. BRINKMANN: It's contributing to the\nbusiness.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if it doesn't, it\ndoesn't. So now, if that's right, then it's the form of\nanalysis rather than the result that's wrong in the\ncourt below. Because they start talking about two\nseparate tests and then people argue whether the second\nshould swallow up the first, and at that point I get\ntotally lost. It's fairly long, but I'd appreciate your\nevaluating what I've just said.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Well, Your Honor, there --\non this record, there's no question that the Lexis/Nexis\ncannot meet the unitary business test.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, there is, Ms.\nBrinkmann. The Illinois appellate court never got to\nthat question. Illinois argued all along this is a\nunitary business. The only one who said it wasn't was\nthis trial court, and the Illinois intermediate\nappellate court says, well, we don't have to deal with\nthat because if you use the other label, operational\nfunction, that comes out all right, too.\nBut this argument was certainly the number\none argument that Illinois was making. It lost only in\nthe trial court on -- on it. And the appellate court\nsaid we don't have to get to it. So I think your answer\nto Justice Souter really wasn't accurate because it\nisn't --\nMS. BRINKMANN: Well, our position is on the\nrecord here, Your Honor, the stipulated record, that\nit's unassailable. But we do --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: All we know is that a\ntrial judge said that was so.\nMS. BRINKMANN: And then that's our\nposition, obviously, on the record, Your Honor; but we\nagreed this was properly raised in the appellate court,\nas opposed to the other argument which was not. And\nthis also was mentioned in the brief in opposition, as\nopposed to their other argument, which was not.\nSo we do think the Court could reach this\nargument, and we maintain that on this record the\nlinchpin of apportionment giving the right of a State --\nand this is a right to extend beyond its territory.\nThe Court has already let it go beyond its\nterritory to get to something outside the State if it's\npart of the unitary business -- the railroad case, the\nexpress case.\nAnd in that situation there are three\nfactors, none of which can be met on this record. There\nwas no shared, centralized management, none. There was\nno integrated functions, none. And there were no\neconomies of scale. Lexis/Nexis did not even get a\ndiscount on any paper they bought from Mead. They were,\nyou know, minor customers of each other.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Maybe when we're talking\nabout Due Process and Commerce Clause limitations on\nwhat States can tax, we ought to ask ourselves if those\nthree -- is that it? If we're trying to measure, is\nthere a sufficient relationship between Lexis/Nexis,\nMead, and the State of Illinois to make it fair for them\nto tax?\nAnd you say, oh, yes. Each year when\nthey're making income, when they are a going concern,\nIllinois can get a piece of it. But when the assets are\nsold, assets that would have generated income for\nIllinois year after year, but when those assets are\nsold, Illinois can get nothing to represent -- to\nsubstitute for that stream of income that it would have\ngotten.\nMS. BRINKMANN: No. It will continue to get\nincome tax on an apportioned basis before and after.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But Lexis/Nexis is gone.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Well, Lexis/Nexis continues\nto operate. It's now owned by Reed Elsevier. So it\nwould continue to pay an apportioned income tax.\nIt's a different event here, Your Honor. It\nis the sale of an investment that occurred in Ohio. And\nas the domicile State, Ohio has provided benefits to the\ncorporate headquarters, to management --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose it had been\nDelaware, and there was nothing there in Delaware except\nit was a Delaware corporation.\nMS. BRINKMANN: That's not the commercial\ndomicile, Your Honor. There is a distinction in all of\nthese cases between the State of incorporation and the\ncommercial domicile. The commercial domicile --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Brinkmann, one\nthing that concerns me is how this will complicate the\nprocess. I think, with respect to ordinary income, the\nStates work this out, and they figure we get 5 percent\nbecause we have 5 percent of the presence or business,\nwhatever.\nNow, they're going to have that, and they're\ngoing to have an overlay on that. They're going to say,\nwell, it's 5 percent; but, you know, we sold this asset\nthat doesn't have any connection to Illinois; and that's\npart of the income we've got. So you don't get quite 5\npercent of all.\nAnd another -- Illinois is going to come\nback and say, well, yes, but you sold this other one;\nand, as to that one, you've got sufficient connection\nwith Illinois. It seems to me it's going to be\nimpossible to sort this out.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, this has been\ngoing on since at least 1992 in the Allied-Signal case.\nThe lower courts, the State courts, except for the court\nin this case, have been able to apply that easily.\nIn order to take the expansive view of\nIllinois here, you would be undermining Allied-Signal,\nwhich had the same facts as in this case, not to mention\nASARCO, Woolworth.\nAnd I would just say, before I could reserve\nthe remainder of my time, Allied-Signal was the case in\nwhich this Court was faced with new arguments raised by\nthe States, at argument. You went back and had\nresupplemental briefing and reargument, and questioned\nin your questions to those parties whether or not ASARCO\nand Woolworth should be revisited and overruled.\nSo the Allied-Signal case took into account\nall of these concerns and came back with a ringing\naffirmation of the linchpin of an apportionability for\nstate taxation being the unitary-business test with the\noperational-function aspect.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't like to intrude on\nthe white light, but if I could just ask one question.\nIf the unitary-tax argument has been\npreserved and is met and if there's a finding that they\nare unitary, does Illinois have the right to tax the\nsale, or to -- to a portion of it?\nMS. BRINKMANN: We think that the finding is\nthat it is not unitary.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. Assume -- assume\nit is unitary. Can Illinois then, in your view, have a\npart of -- tax part of the gain on the sale?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes, if it were unitary, but\nwe think there's no way this record could meet the\nstandards compared to Woolworth, ASARCO. In all those\ncases, they were much closer. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.\nBrinkmann.\nMr. Barov.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN F. BAROV\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. BAROV: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIllinois is not attempting to tax income\nearned outside its borders. To the contrary, the income\nit seeks to tax here is income earned by Mead on its\nelectronic publishing business, Lexis, which conducted\nsubstantial business in Illinois.\nMead paid taxes on the income that the\nelectronic publishing business earned. Yet, it now\ncontends that the Constitution bars it from taxing any\nof the gains it realized on the sale of Lexis, even\nthough Illinois undeniably contributed --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if you did not\nproceed on the unitary business there, let's take that\noff the table. It seems to me that Lexis's presence in\nIllinois is quite irrelevant.\nMR. BAROV: No, Your Honor. It's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that, under\nyour theory, you could tax the sale, even if Lexis were\nnot in Illinois at all, just because Mead is.\nMR. BAROV: If this - if they were unitary,\nyes, then Lexis's presence in Illinois would be\nirrelevant to this case, if they met the\nunitary-business doctrine.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's not the question. I\nthought that the -- I agree with the same question\nJustice Kennedy had. Suppose that I'm a Massachusetts\ncompany that sells tables, and I sell some tables in\nIllinois. And one day I take some of the money, and I\nbuy an iron mine in New Mexico. And then I sell the\niron mine. And Illinois, not Massachusetts, wants to\nimpose a tax. And suppose there is no connection\nwhatsoever between the iron mine and anything else but\nfor four, which are the four listed on page 13a:\nOne, that I have contributed capital support\nto the iron mine.\nTwo, I approve the major capital\nexpenditures of the iron mine, sitting in my office in\nMassachusetts.\nThree, sometimes -- and this is a tougher\none -- I call the iron mine a division of my table\ncompany.\nAnd, four, I sometimes retain tax benefits\nand control over the extra cash of the iron mine, but\nI'm not using it in my day-to-day work.\nNow, are those four things alone sufficient\nfor Illinois to tax the sale of my iron mine? That, it\nseems to me, is the way they presented it. Maybe it is\na unitary business really, but I guess we have to send\nit back for that.\nMR. BAROV: Under -- under those bare facts,\nprobably there would be not a sufficient connection.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then why isn't\nthat the end of this case? That's what they said it\nwas. That's what they said, perhaps wrongly, that this\nisn't a unitary business. And, therefore, we are left\nwith those four facts, and why not send it back and say\nyou haven't reached the unitary-business question; go\nreach it?\nMR. BAROV: Because, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And if I can just add on\nto that same question: If you're going to have the\nunitary-tax theory, that's -- that's very helpful. But\nif we take the unitary-tax theory off the table, it\nseems to me that you are confusing the law by having\nsome midway test. I don't know what your theory is,\nthat -- in relation to this part of Justice Breyer's\nquestion.\nMR. BAROV: There's a two-part answer to\nthat question -- those questions, Your Honor.\nFirst, there's a second avenue of State\ntaxation that's been well recognized by this Court for\nat least 80 years, which is that if a business conducts\nbusiness in a State, a State has a tax -- has the right\nto tax a share of that business. And that's all\nIllinois did here. When it apportioned the income in\nthis case, it apportioned the income only based on\nLexis's in-State Illinois presence. So under that\navenue alone, the tax is constitutional.\nThe second --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But Mead didn't receive --\npardon me -- Lexis didn't receive the money for the\nsale, Mead did.\nMR. BAROV: Right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Unless, again, if Mead's\npresence or nonpresence is simply irrelevant to what\nhappened here, absent a unitary theory.\nMR. BAROV: No, Your Honor. Mead received\nthe tax -- the gain for the sale because Lexis was a\ndivision of Mead, and the only tax-paying -- the only --\nthere is no -- there was no legal entity known as\n\"Lexis\" at the time that Lexis was sold. It was assets\n-- it was assets owned by the Mead Corporation.\nNow, Mead received the benefit -- the gain\non the sale because Mead was the only tax-paying entity\nin this case. So Mead was conducting a business in\nIllinois called \"Lexis,\" and, therefore, Illinois could\ntax at least --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think that if there\nhad been a separate corporation and that Lexis was a\nsubsidiary corporation and the subsidiary was -- it was\nsold, that, again, absent a finding of unitary, Illinois\nthen could have had a tax?\nMR. BAROV: Yes. Illinois could have taxed\nbased on the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. So, then, the\nasset stock doesn't make any difference?\nMR. BAROV: But the -- but the point, Your\nHonor, is that Lexis had a presence in Illinois. It was\nconducting business in Illinois. That, alone, gave\nIllinois the power to tax a share of the income --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That gets back to Justice\nStevens's initial hypothetical. If you live in New York\nand you have an investment in a company that does a lot\nof business in Illinois and you in New York, a resident\nindividual, sell that stock, under your theory Illinois\ncould tax it.\nMR. BAROV: No. Illinois can't tax that\nState because there is no relationship -- there has to\nbe some relationship, you know, between Illinois and the\ntax-paying activity and the taxpayer.\nIn Justice Breyer's hypothetical there was\nnone. But there is a -- but let me, if I can, address\nthat prong of the analysis, also.\nHere there was a much closer connection\nbetween Lexis and Mead than simply that of a passive\ninvestment. It wasn't just that Mead helped Lexis buy,\nmake, handle acquisitions. They were involved in the\nactual acquisitions themselves, in purchasing and\ncontracting to make those acquisitions.\nMead was involved in many of the -- in\ncontrolling lots of their capital investment, its -- and\nits -- it was also involved in manipulating excess -- in\ntheir excess cash. And there is a whole -- there was a\nhost of facts that supported a closer relationship\nbetween Mead and Lexis than simply that, that passive\ninvestment.\nSo whether -- even if you are looking at it\nfrom the operational-function point of view, there was\n-- there was a -- a sufficient connection between Lexis\nand Mead beyond that of Justice Breyer's hypothetical.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If you traded places with\nOhio, how would you have treated this transaction under\nyour tax laws?\nMR. BAROV: Under our tax laws --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Say that Mead was domiciled\nin Illinois but Lexis/Nexis operated in Ohio, would you\nhave just taken -- would you have allocated or would you\nhave claimed that -- the right to tax the entire capital\ngain?\nMR. BAROV: This would have probably, I\nthink, Your Honor -- I believe this would have been\napportioned as business income under Illinois law.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know what -- or\ndid you know what Ohio did in the --\nMR. BAROV: I don't know what Ohio did.\nThey -- Mead has never cited anything in the record to\nsupport the contention that it has been -- that it was\nallocated all to Ohio. My understanding of Ohio law at\nthe time was they -- they have the same business-income\ntest, basically, that Illinois does.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what would you say\n-- I mean, we talk about apportioning income and\nallocating income, allocating to the commercial\nheadquarters.\nWhat in an enterprise like this would you\nsay is allocated to the commercial headquarters as\nopposed to being apportioned among all the States?\nMR. BAROV: Different States have different\nrules, Your Honor, and these are State-law rules, not\nconstitutional rules, about allocation and\napportionment. Some States will allocate an intangible\ncapital gain like this to their own domicile State.\nOther States will apportion it based on the\nshare of income that is done in the State.\nAgain, I don't know what Ohio did. But the\npoint is that's a rule -- that's a State-law rule of\nchoice, not a rule of -- a constitutional rule. I think\nthis Court has been pretty clear in the Mobil Oil case\nthat these -- those -- that doesn't have a\nconstitutional significance.\nThat when a State, a domicile State, and a\nState where a source -- which is the source of income,\nwhen those conflict, in fact, this Court has signaled\nthat apportionment is the default rule. And that the\nsource State actually would have -- the source State\nwould win that confrontation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Barov, I just want to\ngo back to an earlier answer to see how far you would go\nwith the position that you took.\nAssume that, exclusive of Nexis, Mead is the\nsame kind of unitary corporation as under -- under\neverybody's understanding now. Assume, also, as you\nsuggested in a hypo, that Lexis was doing business in\nIllinois. So that at least a -- a portion of its own\nactivity could be taxed in Illinois. And assume, third,\nthat the relationship between Mead and Lexis is simply\none of passive investment. Mead simply bought a lot of\nstock, maybe 100 percent of the stock at the right time;\nand, otherwise, it kept hands off. And at this point\nMead now -- now sells.\nOn -- on your theory, would -- would the\nState of Illinois be able to tax a portion of the\ncapital gain?\nMR. BAROV: Yes, they would, Your Honor.\nBut they would be limited in how much of that capital\ngain they could apportion. They would apportion it\nlimited to the amount of income that arose in Illinois.\nAnd that's what the auditor did in this case.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but that would be, in\neffect, the portion of the Nexis business, total\nbusiness that took place in Illinois, total sales, total\npayroll, however you do it.\nMR. BAROV: Right, and then that would be\nput -- that would be put into --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But the only point I\nwanted to be clear on to understand your position is\nthat purely passive investment would be enough to\ntrigger your theory?\nMR. BAROV: Yes, it would be.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. BAROV: It is, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, why isn't\nyour friend correct that you have waived any argument\nbased on the presence of Lexis in Illinois?\nMR. BAROV: Your Honor, two reasons:\nFirst, under the -- they have cited\nbasically two basis grounds for waiver, one under\nIllinois law and under this Court's rules. But they\nmisstate Illinois law in the -- on the waiver regard.\nThe cases and rules they cite to stand for a\nsimple proposition that a point not raised in a brief\nbefore a particular court can't be raised on oral\nargument. But what the Illinois Supreme Court has been\nclear on \"otherwise\" is that an argument, even if it's\nnot raised in the appellate court, as long as it's\nraised in the trial court in support of a judgment, may\nbe raised in a reviewing court on further review.\nI can provide a couple of cites, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And -- and I'm not\nfollowing your argument, because I thought that the\nargument that this was a unitary enterprise was made in\nthe Illinois appellate court, and the appellate court\nrecognizes that it was made, and said we are not going\nto reach it because we have this operational-function\ntest?\nMR. BAROV: Yes, Your Honor. That's --\nthat's correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that's --\nthey are very different from your current argument,\nwhich you emphasize that whether they are unitary or\nnot, Lexis/Nexis was in Illinois.\nMR. BAROV: That's correct, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Now, as to\nthat argument, at least I am very reluctant to overturn\na State court on an argument that they didn't have an\nopportunity to consider. And whether it's technically\nwaived because you raised it in the trial court or not,\nit certainly was not an argument you made to the\nIllinois appellate courts.\nMR. BAROV: That's correct, Your Honor. And\n-- but I think, as this Court set forth in Caterpillar\nv. Lewis, it is a predicate to the intelligent\nresolution of this case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it wasn't in\nAllied-Signal. In Allied-Signal the asset that was sold\nwas in New Jersey, and that was totally irrelevant to\nhow we treated the issue in that case.\nMR. BAROV: Certainly, Your Honor. But New\nJersey was taking a very different position in that\ncase. They were making a much broader argument than we\nare making here. They were trying to overturn the\nentire unitary doctrine.\nAnd so they may have -- they may have chosen\nnot to make that argument. It may very well have been\nin that case that ASARCO's apportionment factors in that\ncase were so minimal that it wasn't worth their making\nthat argument.\nBut, for whatever reason, they weren't\ninterested in taxing based on the source alone.\nBut here, as the facts show, Illinois did\ntax. We taxed Lexis, or the gain on Lexis, pursuant to\nLexis' in-state apportionment factors.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question\njust -- it shows my ignorance, but if the\nunitary-business approach to taxation was not applied in\nthis case, how did you compute the amount of the tax?\nMR. BAROV: It was computed -- what the\ndepartment did in this case is it -- it took the entire\ngain that put -- that went into Mead's apportionable tax\nbase. But, then, in order to find the Illinois-Lexis\nshare of the gain, he looked at the -- he looked at\nLexis's Illinois sales and Illinois's -- Lexis's\nIllinois payroll and pulled that amount out, which was\nabout four percent of the gain, and put that into Mead's\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So you use a different\nformula from the normal three-factor formula to compute\nthe tax?\nMR. BAROV: Right. You use a different\nformula. You use a two-factor formula, but it was just\nrelated to Mead's sales, not to --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But it seems to me that\nthose factors are wholly irrelevant to the fact of sale.\nIt's just whimsical. It has nothing to do with the\nsale.\nThe reason we use apportionment in other\ncases is, just as in Justice Breyer's railroad example,\nthere is no other way to tell, and so forth.\nBut here the presence of Lexis in Illinois\nis wholly accidental with reference to what went on in\nthe sale.\nMR. BAROV: No, Your Honor, it wasn't. I\nmean Lexis did considerable business in Illinois, and\nthe auditor was isolating Illinois's business in\nattempting to accurately value the amount of gain that\nshould be attributable to Mead based on Lexis's Illinois\npresence.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's why\nit's even more dramatic to me that you didn't raise the\nargument based on the Lexis connection to Illinois.\nThat's the basis on which your auditor is claiming these\ntaxes; and, yet, you don't even raise it before the\nIllinois appellate court as a ground for being able to\nreach the Lexis/Nexis income.\nMR. BAROV: -- the trial court -- actually\nthe appellate court ruled on whether the State law tests\nhad been met at the time. And when it went up on appeal\nwe -- we prevailed in the appellate court based on\noperational -- I'm sorry, in the trial court, based on\nthe court's finding the operational function had been\nmet. That's how the appellant framed the issue, and the\ncase sort of turned on really Illinois State law's\ninterpretation of Allied-Signal. But, you know, at this\npoint the -- the facts and the law are clear and a\ndecision --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In the Illinois courts,\nthey did argue that as a matter of Federal\nconstitutional law the tax is impermissible, didn't\nthey?\nMR. BAROV: Correct, yes. Yes, they did.\nAt this point, Your Honor, I mean, to render a decision\nthat doesn't take into account the facts of the case,\nthe economic reality, accordingly would be artificial.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We couldn't do\nanything more if we said you haven't waived it, we\ncouldn't do anything more than send it back. You're\ntelling us Lexis has this presence in Illinois, but we\nhave nothing in the record about that.\nMR. BAROV: Yes, it is in the record. The\nauditor's -- I mean, the stipulation itself shows that\nLexis was in Illinois. And the Illinois appellate court\nmade a finding that the presence of Lexis -- Mead to tax\nNexis with Illinois was undisputed. So the Illinois\nappellate court recognized that Lexis had a taxing --\nadequate taxing connection with Illinois.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where is that?\nMR. BAROV: That is -- I don't have the page\ncite handy, Your Honor, but the appellate court did make\na finding that it was undisputed that the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I just -- usually\nappellate courts don't make findings. That's why I'm\ncurious --\nMR. BAROV: I'm sorry. Made a statement.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there any sort of\nstipulation between the parties to say what each, what\nLexis/Nexis was doing in Illinois, what Mead was doing\nin Illinois?\nMR. BAROV: There was, there was a long\nstipulation, yes, Your Honor, and plus there was\nexhibits attached to the stipulation, which are\nreflected in our briefs, that discuss in detail what\nMead and Lexis were both doing, at least their\nrelationship to each other.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Let me ask you about the\ntheory that both the trial court and the intermediate\nappellate court went on, this operational function test,\nwhich has been brought up in a few of our cases, but I\ndon't know any that was decided. Did we ever have any\ncase that turned on the operational function test to\nhold for the State taxing authority?\nMR. BAROV: No, Your Honor. But in\nAllied-Signal there was -- examples were given of\ncertain --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. But one of the\nproblems with applying it as you urge here is that that\nwould just override -- why would anyone go to the\ntrouble of making a case under the so-called unitary\nbusiness test, because the operational function test\nwould be much easier to meet? So --\nMR. BAROV: I guess on that point I would\ndisagree with you a bit, Your Honor. I think there are\nvery -- they're different types that look at different\nrelationships. So one doesn't -- while the same facts\ncan support them in instances, you can have situations\nwhere a business is unitary but not operational or --\nI'm sorry, an asset is operational, but isn't\nnecessarily --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What? What? What could it\nbe? That is -- as I read this, I thought, well, there\nis no separate test. It's just there's a certain\nsituation that comes up fairly commonly where someone\nclaims that an asset of a company was really quite\nseparate, and therefore when they get income from it or\nthey sell it it has nothing to do with my business. And\nthe answer is: It did have something to do with your\nbusiness, you used the working capital and so forth, in\nwhich case it's part of the business. So how -- how is\nit -- how is it different from that?\nMR. BAROV: I agree, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, if you agree with\nthat, do you really agree, because if you agree with\nthat there's no such separate test, this court was wrong\nto consider it separately, the lower court, and they\nshould have reached the question they didn't reach,\nwhich was is this whole thing one single business, which\nis normally called the unitary business test?\nMR. BAROV: Your Honor, on that point I\ndisagree.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Good. All right.\nMR. BAROV: I think there is -- I mean,\nthey're both ways of reaching the overall unitary\nprinciple, whether you can show the intangible flow of\nassets -- of value between a company -- I can give you\nan example, say, of a company that would be unitary but\nwhere the operational function analysis wouldn't apply\nis the Container Corp. Type fact pattern, where you have\na domestic -- a domestic parent providing value out to\nthe foreign subsidiaries, but there is nothing sort of\nflowing back to the domestic parent. They're not really\nusing those subsidiaries in the domestic business. But\nnevertheless, there is enough value being thrown out\nthat it passed the unitary threshold.\nThe unitary -- the unitary -- I'm sorry.\nThe operational function analysis or test or principle,\nwhatever you want to call it, arises in the examples\ngiven in Allied-Signal. As you said, you've got\nsomething which isn't really part of the rest of your\nbusiness, but you're using it in that business to\nsupport it way beyond just a passive investment.\nAnd this -- in this case, that's how Mead\nwas using Lexis. They were using it to support their,\nthe value of their multiple, their multi-state business,\nby manipulating -- by making capital contributions,\nmanipulating corporate structures, and bringing back\nthat tax and net loss carryforwards, which increased the\nvalue, which increased their business activities.\nSo this case actually is that -- is that --\nfalls within that paradigm also. It's not unlike any --\nlike either of those hypotheticals in Allied-Signal, not\nunlike the use of working -- investment of working\ncapital.\nSo, yes, both -- the test, while there are\nfacts that overlap them, they can show that there are\ndifferent relationships.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So say you -- but you\nwould be asking us, if you were going to go on that\noperational function, to take two examples that were\ngiven in Allied-Signal that are quite different from\nwhat's involved here, and to make that a doctrine when\nyou recognize that we have never used that theory to\nhold for a State taxing authority in the context of a\nmulti-state enterprise?\nMR. BAROV: Your Honor, I don't think you\nhave to create a separate doctrine again. I think these\nare both considered different ways of showing the\nintangible flow of value, the significant links between\na business that give rise to constitutional\napportionment. And whether they're considered separate\nanalyses -- they have been described by some academics\nas corollaries of each other. It's certainly, given\nthis Court's signals in Allied-Signal, I think it's\ncertainly appropriate where the facts arise to make the\nconstitutional finding based on the operational function\nthat an asset serves in a business.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question.\nDoes the record tell us whether other States have sought\nto tax the capital gain on this transaction?\nMR. BAROV: No, it does not, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: As far as we know,\nIllinois is out on its own here?\nMR. BAROV: I don't know, Your -- I don't\nknow the answer to that, Your Honor. I hope not.\nIn any event, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You'd not wager, however,\nright?\nMR. BAROV: In any case, Your Honor, as you\nsaid, as I've said, there are two possible ways that --\ntwo different constitutional paths or theories that we\ncan go down in this case to meet the -- that allows\nIllinois to apportion.\nIndependent of the operational links, Mead\ncan tax the gain on Lexis simply because Lexis conducted\nbusiness in Illinois. A state may tax a nonresident's\ninvestment income based on its investment in a separate\nbusiness, and that's exactly what Illinois -- that's\nanother way to uphold the Illinois appellate court's\ndecision.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If Illinois -- if Ohio\nis, in fact, taxing the whole gain at its full rate on\nthe theory that this entire income should be allocated\nto Ohio, then you do have an element of double taxation,\nright?\nMR. BAROV: That's possible, Your Honor, but\nit's -- first, there is no -- there's no evidence that\nOhio in fact did that. But I think the Mobil Oil case\nshould have disposed of that, that contention, because\nthis Court rejected a similar argument that the mere\npossibility of taxation by a domiciliary State\nforeclosed taxation by a State where the business was\npresent.\nAnd under Mobil Oil, when a resident State's\nclaim and a source State's claim conflict, this Court\nindicated that the resident State's claim must yield to\nthat of the source State. So there should be no issue\nof multiple taxation in this case.\nJust -- Chief Justice Roberts, just to go\nback to your question, it's page 11A of the pet. app.\nwhere the appellate court said: \"Mead does not dispute\nthat Lexis/Nexis had the requisite connection or nexus\nwith Illinois.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought -- I've\nbeen looking, too. I thought 18A does say that they had\n$46 million of sales attributable to Lexis/Nexis.\nMR. BAROV: Right. Certainly. There was\nhundreds of millions of dollars of sales in Illinois.\nSo that's really not an issue in this case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, only 46 million.\nMR. BAROV: I'm sorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It said 46, not\nhundreds of millions.\nMR. BAROV: I'm sorry. In 1994, yes, that's\ncorrect.\nThe -- and again there's -- both Mead and\nLexis -- as both Mead and Lexis had adequate\nconstitutional connection here, there is no basis not to\nsustain --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're taxing Mead, not\nNexis/Lexis?\nMR. BAROV: Correct. That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So what relevance is it\nthat Nexis/Lexis has business in Illinois?\nMR. BAROV: It's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean that's fine if\nthat's who you're taxing.\nMR. BAROV: Well, it's relevant if, only if,\nthis Court finds that there was no operational\nrelationship between Lexis and Mead. Then Lexis's\npresence in Illinois becomes relevant because in that\ncase, whether you look at this as a separate business\nconducted by Mead or whether it was even a passive\ninvestment of Mead's, Illinois can still tax it in the\nmanner that it did by -- by isolating the values of\nLexis's -- that Lexis earned in Illinois.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that is different --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I might say that I don't\nfollow that. It seems to me what you can establish from\nthe fact that it did a lot of business in Illinois is\nthat can you tax it and -- but I don't see how.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was no \"it\" to tax,\nright?\nMR. BAROV: That 's correct. There was no\n\"it\" to tax and under this court's well-established case\nlaw, International Harvester, J.C. Penney, a State can\ntax a nonresident on an investment in that State as well\nas the tax is properly prorated to the amount of income\nthat rose within that State.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: At the time of this sale\nof Lexis/Nexis assets, there was only one taxpayer; it\nwas Mead.\nMR. BAROV: That's correct, Your Honor.\nThere was one taxpayer and it was Mead. That was the\nonly party that could have been taxed. That's correct.\nSo here, in this case, Mead is taking an\nall-or-nothing approach to taxation but this could --\nthis disregards the connections between Mead's\nelectronic publishing business in Illinois. And the\nCourt should decline to rule in their favor. In fact --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have any case like\nthat where your ability to tax a surviving corporation\nhas to do with, not whether the surviving corporation\nitself has sufficient contacts with the State, but\nwhether some other corporation that has disappeared now\nbut that merged into it had sufficient -- it seems to me\nyou have to establish connection with the taxpayer. Not\n-- not with somebody from whom the taxpayer made some\nmoney.\nMR. BAROV: You have to establish a\nconnection with the taxpayer's activities in the taxing\nState. That's the constitutional touchstone. So if\nMead -- whether Mead was running a business in Illinois\nor investing in Illinois or had a unitary business that\noperated in Illinois, those -- that's the -- that\nprovides a sufficient link.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's fine.\nMR. BAROV: So that provides the taxing --\nthe ability --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that isn't established\nby the mere fact that Lexis/Nexis did business there.\nUltimately you have to come down to connecting it to\nMead, either by your unitary business doctrine or by\nthis functional doctrine that you're relying on.\nMR. BAROV: No, Your Honor. Under\nInternational Harvester, I think that the Court made it\nvery clear that even a passive investment can be taxed\nby a State. If Mead -- Mead can be taxed -- even if\nLEXIS was a passive investor and Mead was only investing\nin Illinois, Illinois could still tax Mead on the value\nof its investment that arose in Illinois. And so Mead\nrealized the gain. Mead is the taxpayer. Mead can be\ntaxed as long as the tax is properly prorated to the\nIllinois presence, which it was in this case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the proration, it\nseems to me -- that should have nothing to do with the\nextent of Lexis in Illinois --\nMR. BAROV: Exactly.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- nor does it have to do\nwith the extent of Mead in Illinois.\nMR. BAROV: Well, no, Your Honor. It's --\nunder this -- then under this Court's precedent, that\nyou're looking for the source State, the activity of the\nbusiness was conducted in the source State. Now, in\nthis case it happened that the amounts are fairly close\nto each other. So if there is any question about it,\nthere's no -- you know, there is no constitutional\nproblem that arises out of that. But clearly this -- I\nmean it's settled precedent that a State can tax based\non income -- the income that arose in that State and\nthat's what happened here.\nIndeed, to accept Mead's contention which\nalso would create a constitutional loophole that for\nincome in ae State's marketplace helped create but which\na State cannot recover, the Illinois court's decision\npermitting Illinois to tax a fraction of the gain should\nbe affirmed.\nAnd if the Court has no other questions --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can you tax me on stock --\non stock that I own on companies that do business in\nIllinois?\nMR. BAROV: In the abstract, yes, you could,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you know any State that\ntries to do it.\nMR. BAROV: No, Your Honor, but again, Your\nHonor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's extraordinary. I\ndon't know of any tax that a State could possibly\nimpose, that no State has imposed.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BAROV: Your Honor, this is -- but Your\nHonor, International Harvester is the perfectly precise\nfact pattern where this Court upheld a tax on a -- on\ninvestors, on the shareholder's investment in a State in\nwhich they were not present, so -- but in this case Mead\nhad an independent tax presence also in Illinois. So\nthat issue just doesn't arise in this case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMs. Brinkmann, you have three minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BETH S. BRINKMANN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. BRINKMANN: I have four very quick\npoints, Your Honor. Two go into this new, very\nbreathtaking argument that the State is making based on\nLexis/Nexis's presence to the State. Concerning\nIllinois law, if you look Repondents' brief in\nopposition, on page 12 at note 4, they cite the same\nIllinois law we do, trying to argue that we had waived\narguments in the brief in op, so we are on pretty solid\nground there. I think it's their cert page, they were\nagreeing with us on what the Illinois law meant.\nOn the substance of it, I think Justice\nScalia and Justice Kennedy brought out the weaknesses.\nTheir position would lead to taxes on all stock sales.\nAny State where an investment was doing business could\nthen reach out and apportion the gain on that. And as\nfar as International Harvester and J.C. Penney, those\nwere tax on the investment, not the investor. And the\ndissent -- that was the dispute -- the majority. It was\nthe incident of the tax fell on the invest -- the\ninvestment that was doing business in the State.\nThe State concedes, Your Honor, on Justice\nGinsburg's, the distinction between -- the sale of\nassets and the sale of stocks that you were concerned\nabout. On page 43, they concede and I think it's very\nwell recognized through Mobil and Exxon and Woolworth\nthat \"apportionment has nothing to do with the form a\nbusiness organization takes.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Brinkmann, your\nfinal point.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Finally I would point out,\non the question you asked -- I think it was Justice\nGinsburg -- what Illinois would do in this.\nInterestingly --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ohio.\nMS. BRINKMANN: -- the record in this case\nat -- it's not in the joint appendix, but it's at C-851.\nIt's Exhibit 1, to the stipulation of facts. It\nindicates that interest and dividends allocable are\nallocable to Illinois if the commercial domicile is in\nIllinois.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Illinois or Ohio, were you\ntalking about?\nMS. BRINKMANN: This is the Illinois return,\nand the question was what Illinois would do? And they\nsay commercial domicile, we get your interest and\ndividends.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Brinkmann, on\nthe waiver point -- I'm looking at page 18a -- it not\nonly says that Lexis/Nexis contributed $46 million from\nits presence in Illinois; it begins the sentence by\nsaying \"as the Department notes, $46 million of Mead's\nincome came from Lexis/Nexis activities in Illinois.\"\nSo that doesn't sound like a waiver of that point to me.\nMS. BRINKMANN: At one point, after they got\nthrough the unitary business and operational functional\nanalysis, there was an argument about whether it was\ngrossly disproportionate, and that's where some of that\ninformation came. It was never in the context of this\nlegal --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Initially, it's\nabout the context in which -- what I regard as an\nimportant fact -- was raised, whether it was raised in\nthe context of an argument on unitary business or\nwhether or not they went too far, but the stubborn fact\nis still there.\nMS. BRINKMANN: There are facts, Your Honor,\nbut the Illinois law is very clear; it's rule 341(h)(7)\nand (i) which applies to applee. If you don't raise a\npoint in the appellate court, it is waived. That's an\nindependent and adequate State ground. And it's a very\nbreathtaking argument, as Justice Scalia pointed out,\nthat also wasn't brought forth in the brief in\nopposition. Thank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you.
