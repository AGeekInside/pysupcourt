        "content": "(11:15 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in Number 01-1368, the Nevada Department of Human\nResources versus William Hibbs.\nMr. Taggart.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL G. TAGGART\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. TAGGART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThere are three reasons Congress did not validly\nabrogate State immunity when it adopted the Family Medical\nLeave Act's family leave provision. First, the FMLA is\neveryday economic legislation, a national labor standard,\nnot antidiscrimination legislation, second, Congress was\nnot responding to a discernible pattern of\nunconstitutional behavior, and third, even if such a\npattern were discernible, the 12-week family leave mandate\nenforced by abrogating State immunity is not a\nproportional and congruent response.\nThe Family Medical Leave Act is no different\nthan the minimum wage and other national labor standards.\nIt is, in its operation and effect, it is simply Commerce\nClause legislation.\nQUESTION: Well, but now in the statute, the\nfindings, or the beginning, they refer to the Equal -- the\nEqual Protection Clause. They say it's consistent with\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,\ndon't they?\nMR. TAGGART: Yes, they do, but they do not --\nCongress did not invoke Section 5 of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, as it did in the ADA and the ADEA statutes. It\ntold us exactly why, in the House and Senate reports, it\nwas mentioning the Fourteenth Amendment in the text of the\nstatute.\nQUESTION: Well, as applied to private\nemployers, I suppose Congress had to rely on Commerce\nClause powers, but as applied to States, there is specific\nreference in the statute, of course, to section 5 -- to\nequal protection.\nMR. TAGGART: Yes, there is specific reference\nto equal protection --\nQUESTION: Yes, right.\nMR. TAGGART: -- but Congress told us why they\nmentioned equal protection in the House and the Senate\nreport, where Congress stated that if --\nQUESTION: Why do you need the House and Senate\nreport? I mean, the very text of the statute doesn't say,\nin order to assure equal protection of the laws in the\nStates. That's not what it says. It says that what we're\ndoing, what we're requiring, the leave that we're\nrequiring, we are requiring in a manner that, consistent\nwith the Equal Protection Clause, minimizes the\nprotection, the potential for employment discrimination.\nI read that as saying what we're doing here is\nbeing done with an eye to being sure that it's in\nconformance with the Equal Protection Clause. That's\nquite different from saying that we're doing it in order\nto enforce the Equal Protection Clause, which is being\nviolated by the States.\nMR. TAGGART: We agree with that position,\nJustice Scalia.\nQUESTION: But Mr. Taggart, we --\nQUESTION: But the statement in the text goes to\nthe manner, goes to the manner, not to the purpose at all.\nQUESTION: The first rule of statutory\nconstruction is to read on, and if you read on with me --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: -- you will find it said, to promote\nthe role of equal employment opportunity for women and men\npursuant to such clause, to promote the goal of equal\nopportunity for women and men.\nThroughout your opening brief, you never\nreferred to that statute. You told us there was only the\n(4), the one that Justice Scalia referred to, and it\nwasn't until your reply brief that you even acknowledged\nthat Congress has said, we're doing this to promote the\ngoal of equal opportunity for men and women. Why didn't\nyou mention (5) in your opening brief?\nMR. TAGGART: Well, why we didn't mention (5),\nI -- I apologize if we did not -- if we did not mention\nit, but the -- the Senate report and the House report\ndescribe exactly why Congress was talking about equal\nprotection.\nQUESTION: Well, one would look to the statute\nbefore one looks to the House or the Senate report.\nMR. TAGGART: Yes, that is correct, but the\noperation of the statute clearly shows that it is just\neveryday Commerce Clause legislation. Congress was deeply\nconcerned that the Family Medical Leave Act itself would\nbe challenged on equal protection grounds, and that's why\nit said it was promoting the goal of equal employment\nopportunity. Everything else about the statute, the way\nit operates, the economic benefit that it provides, the\nfact that it doesn't prohibit discrimination at all, show\nthat this is nothing different from the minimum wage, and\nthat -- that is what -- that is what this -- this was\nadopted in the tradition of.\nQUESTION: Mr. Taggart, I -- I thought the\nreason you didn't refer to the reference to equal\nopportunity for men and women is that that is not a\nreference to the Equal Protection Clause.\nQUESTION: Pursuant to such clause --\nQUESTION: People -- people -- people --\nindividuals could fail to provide equal -- equal\nopportunity for men and women without violating the Equal\nProtection Clause.\nMR. TAGGART: That's true, but the --\nQUESTION: The -- the statute says, pursuant to\nthe Equal Protection Clause.\nMR. TAGGART: Well, it does say that, but in our\nview, it is more important to look at the operation and\nthe text of the amendment, and how -- how the -- or of the\nact, and how the act works.\nQUESTION: Why?\nthen just a few lines above, in the text, where it talks\nabout findings, it says that, due to the nature of the\nroles of men and women, primary responsibility for family\ncare-taking often falls on women, and then it says\nemployment standards that apply to just one gender have\nserious potential for encouraging employers to\ndiscriminate against people of that gender. So what I\ntake that to mean is that, without this, State employers\nas well as others tend to say to the woman, You go take\ncare of your sick mother, and because employers know that,\nthey won't hire women. That's what it says in (5) and\n(6), and I would have thought that sounded like equal\nprotection of the laws, as if this statute is designed to\nhelp remove one of the major reasons why employers\ndiscriminate against women. That's what (5) and (6) says,\nand then the -- 10 lines down it says, pursuant to the\nFourteenth Amendment.\nMR. TAGGART: Well, Justice Breyer, the\nstatement here, in our view, indicates why Congress\nadopted a gender-neutral statute. If it adopted a gender-\nspecific statute, the statute itself would have been\nsubject to challenge under the Equal Protection Clause.\nOur -- our concern here is that any everyday\neconomic legislation that may have a disparate benefit to\none suspect classification or another will all of a sudden\nbe -- have the power to abrogate Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity, and then State immunity will be subject to\nabrogation at -- at any expense where Congress deems that\nCommerce Clause legislation is appropriate. Congress\nshould not be allowed to do indirectly what it's\nprohibited from doing directly.\nQUESTION: Mr. Taggart, would you comment on\nthis argument, which I think is really an elaboration on\nthe findings in the purpose statement that Justice Breyer\nwas referring to.\nI think you can distill those statements down to\nsomething like this. We know for a fact historically\nthat, whenever burdens of family responsibility are\nallocated, they are allocated to the woman, not to the\nman. If we do not have an employment standard that\nexpressly says you have got to treat them exactly alike,\nthe women will always get the short end, and that will be\nreflected in hiring decisions, among others.\nSecondly, in order to make this determination a\npractical one, we can't simply leave it that whatever you\ndo for men you should do for women, or vice versa. We've\ngot to put some kind of a threshold there that will mean\nsomething, and so we've come up with a particular period,\na particular number of weeks. That's the only way to make\nthis work.\neffect, on these two sections. That doesn't sound to me\nlike simply an end run, a phony Commerce Clause argument.\nWould you comment on that argument?\nMR. TAGGART: Well, even if that were true, even\nif that effect occurred from the statute, the failure, the\nutter failure of the statute to satisfy this Court's City\nof Boerne test shows that it is purely economic\nlegislation. There were absolutely no findings by\nCongress regarding State conduct, or whether State conduct\nwas unconstitutional, and it's difficult to discern from\nthe record before this Court or --\nQUESTION: Well, given the fact that we have\naccepted in prior cases the pervasiveness of the\nphenomenon that seems to be quite clearly reflected in the\nfindings and purpose, is that necessary here to say, well,\nyeah, it -- we've already said, the Supreme Court has\nalready accepted its pervasiveness, but we've got to go a\nstep further and say, well, yeah, that pervasiveness even\ngoes to States. Isn't there a point at which the point\nhas been made?\nMR. TAGGART: Well, first of all, if that were\ntrue, then any law that Congress passes that has any\narguable fact on discrimination based on gender would be\nsufficient for satisfying an abrogation of State immunity.\nIn 1993 --\nQUESTION: Well, we can't -- what about the\nFitzpatrick v. Bitzer decision, where the Court\nunanimously found Title VII was a valid abrogation of the\nEleventh Amendment immunity, and there was no inquiry into\nthe history of gender discrimination, it was just\naccepted? Do you think that that case would stand up\nunder your analysis?\nMR. TAGGART: Yes, it would. There -- or we\nwould take the position that it would. There is --\nQUESTION: Because this is rather similar.\nMR. TAGGART: Well, there is no requirement, and\nwe are not urging the Court to adopt a requirement that\nCongress make findings. Congress simply helps the Court\nwhen it makes findings about what it is -- whether there\nis unconstitutional State behavior that would justify a\n12-week family leave benefit that's abrogated by State\nsovereign immunity. But Title VII is closely hewed to\nthis Court's section 1 jurisprudence, and there's every\nreason to believe that Title VII would stand up to the\nCity of Boerne test. So the difference with this statute\nis that there is absolutely --\nQUESTION: Mr. Taggart, I thought that part of\nyour argument was, if the discrimination doesn't exist\nanymore in the State, even if it did at one time, then the\nprovision would have to sunset, and as far as Title VII is\nconcerned, many States, the vast majority of States have\ntheir own Title VII laws, so at this point in time I\nguess, under your reasoning, Fitzpatrick and Bitzer would\nhave to go.\nMR. TAGGART: Well, we are not arguing that\nposition and, in fact, in our view Title VII is so closely\nhewed to this Court's section (1) jurisprudence that it --\nit -- there's every reason to believe that it would\nsatisfy this Court's test.\nIn -- in -- in this case, though, the question\nis, in 1993 was there a pattern and practice of State\nbehavior that would justify a 12-week mandatory family\nleave benefit for all State employees that's -- that's\nenforced through abrogating State immunity, and the\nstandard --\nQUESTION: What was the -- in the title of Title\nVII what was the pattern and practice that justified that\nresult, because when the original Title VII was passed\nthis Court had never declared any law that differentiated\non the basis of gender unconstitutional, and when it was\nextended to public employees -- was it in '72? -- this\nCourt had just begun to address the issue.\nMR. TAGGART: Yes, that --\nQUESTION: And yet the Court said Congress could\ndo that in '72 with no special record of any kind. The\nrecord, to the extent it existed, was made for race, not\nsex.\nMR. TAGGART: Well, we're not challenging Title\nVII in this case. We're challenging that in 1993, when\nthe --\nQUESTION: But she's asking you to distinguish\nTitle VII from this. We know you're not challenging it.\nMR. TAGGART: Well, in our view --\nQUESTION: What about the fact that Title VII\ngoes to discrimination on the basis of sex in general, and\nthere was no doubt that States have engaged in that and\nwere engaging in it at the time. You could have said it\nwas -- it was general knowledge. But the statute we're\nconstruing here doesn't go to sex discrimination in\ngeneral, it goes to a very particular type of sex\ndiscrimination, and that is in the granting of leave, and\non that, at least I can't say as a matter of general\nknowledge that the States were in violation of provisions\nof leave. I've no idea what the state -- what the state\nwas. Certainly you -- you need evidence to show that they\nwere violating that particular aspect of -- of -- of equal\nprotection.\nMR. TAGGART: Well, in order to show a pattern\nand practice in 1993 it's this Court's section (1)\njurisprudence on violations of the Equal Protection Clause\nthat governs, and Washington v. Davis, incorporated into\nthe gender cases through State Administrators v. Feeney,\nis a test which requires purposeful and invidious\ndiscrimination. There's no showing that there was a\npattern and practice of State managers in 1993 of using a\ngender stereotype when they granted leave.\nQUESTION: Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, because if\nyou accept, I take it, you accept the proposition that\nCongress has sufficiently shown, as far as anyone need do,\nthat State employers discriminated in their hiring against\nwomen, the gener -- you accept that, is that right?\nThat's your -- your -- your -- your, for -- because if\nthat's not so, I guess goodbye to Title VII, a whole bunch\nof things, but is -- do you accept that?\nMR. TAGGART: Well, Title VII, and the circuits\nhave said this already, is that Title VII is so closely\nhewed to this Court's section (1) --\nQUESTION: No, I'm not asking you to distinguish\nTitle VII. I'm asking you if, for purposes of this case,\nyou accept the proposition that it is adequately shown\nthat State employers, like a lot of other employers, did\ndiscriminate against women in hiring people, in general.\nMR. TAGGART: If --\nQUESTION: I'd like a yes answer or a no answer,\nif I could.\nMR. TAGGART: Well, a qualified yes if you're\ntalking about 1972, when --\nQUESTION: Okay, so at the time of this statute?\nMR. TAGGART: Not at the time of this statute.\nQUESTION: Oh, okay. You do not accept the\nproposition that it is adequately shown that State\nemployers discriminated against women when they passed\nthis law?\nMR. TAGGART: No, and even if there was a --\nQUESTION: Okay. No, then, I don't see the\ndistinction with Title VII. It's goodbye if I accept that\nargument, I think. It's just that it was earlier?\nMR. TAGGART: No, it's that title -- it's\nunclear whether Title VII even prohibits things that this\nCourt's section (1) jurisprudence wouldn't also prohibit.\nTitle VII basically codifies what this Court\nsaid in Washington v. Davis. It allows a give-and-take in\nthe courtroom of the evidence to -- to flesh out the\ntotality of facts that surround an employment activity,\nand at the end of the day in the Title VII lawsuit an\ninference can be made of whether purposeful discrimination\nactually occurred. It allows a defense not based upon\nheightened scrutiny or strict scrutiny. It allows just a\nsimple defense by the employer.\nUnlike the Family Medical Leave Act, which just\ntakes away any defense at all for States to defend the\npolicies that they have, that it doesn't even elevate\nState policies to a heightened scrutiny standard, but in\n1993 State policies were gender neutral, and under this\nCourt's section (1) jurisprudence those policies should be\nsubject to a rational basis review. But instead, the FMLA\njust makes all of those policies unlawful. Any policy\nthat doesn't have 12 weeks of leave is simply unlawful.\nIt doesn't give the State the ability to come in and prove\nthat that policy was -- was applied --\nQUESTION: Suppose you have two statutes, one is\na congressional statute that says, all States must have\nemployment and pay policies that do not differentiate on\nthe basis of gender, and the second is the FMLA. It seems\nto me that the FMLA is much more limited. It's just 12\nweeks, the damages are capped, it's simple to operate --\nMR. TAGGART: But --\nQUESTION: I would think that that is much more\nproportional and congruent than the other statute that I\ndescribed.\nMR. TAGGART: Well, the -- this statute, in\nour -- our position is is not proportionally concurrent,\nbecause first, there's no pattern of State behavior that\nwould justify a 12-week leave benefit. But to completely\nmake unlawful any act, any State policy that's less than\n12 weeks would require a substantial showing that States\nwere engaged in discrimination in the employment, in\nemployment practices.\nQUESTION: Why? Why? Because if you imagined,\nand you won't concede this, but I think, take it as a\nhypothetical, then, if you imagined that State employers\nhad been shown to discriminate against women in hiring,\nwouldn't Congress have quite a lot of leeway in choosing\nthe remedy for that discrimination, and wouldn't this\nstatute be part of the remedy?\nMR. TAGGART: Absolutely. If your\nhypothetical --\nQUESTION: So in other words, if it's\nabsolutely, then the answer as far as you see it in this\ncase is whether there has been an adequate showing that at\nthe time of this statute State employers discriminated\nagainst women in hiring, and if the answer to that\nquestion in your view is, there was an adequate showing,\nthis is an appropriate remedy, but if the answer in your\nview is, it wasn't an adequate showing, then, of course,\nyou would win. That's how you're basically seeing the\ncase.\nMR. TAGGART: Well, I don't want to agree with\nyou 100 percent, but -- but the --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: I would think your-- your brief --\nyour brief agreed with him zero percent.\nMR. TAGGART: Well --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Your -- your --\nMR. TAGGART: We didn't --\nQUESTION: Under your brief, the answer is quite\nclearly no, you don't think it's proportionate even if\nthere had been a violation shown. Isn't that what your\nbrief said?\nMR. TAGGART: Well, the hypothetical was, if\nthere was enough of a showing, and I think that's the\nquestion. We argue there was no showing, which would\njustify no remedy, but even if there was a showing, the\nremedy has to be proportional, and this 12-week leave\nbenefit just goes far out of proportion of any discernible\npattern of conduct by States which would justify it.\nQUESTION: Mr. Taggart, there have been scores\nof Title VII cases where there's a nice, neutral standard,\nand then there's a decision maker, and the decision maker\nis exercising discretion under these general standards.\nAnd time after the time, the decision maker is duplicating\nhimself, whether race, sex, and the people who don't look\nlike the decision maker say, gee, we suspect\ndiscrimination.\nThere have been countless Title VII suits that\nhave prevailed on that, that the standards are nice and\nneutral, but the discretion whether to hire is made by\nsomeone who is coming up with results that exclude these\npeople.\nNow, do you think that State employers, that the\npeople who do hiring and promotions for States are so\nnonbiased, so unprejudiced that that doesn't affect the\ndecision makers on the State level, as opposed to the\nmunicipal level, and in private employment?\nMR. TAGGART: Our position is that the\npresumption has to be that States act in a constitutional\nmanner, and I'm not going to stand here before the Court\nand say that States are perfect, but there's certainly no\npattern which would justify a 12-week mandatory family\nleave benefit enforced through the abrogation of State\nimmunity. This -- the FMLA is simply not based upon\nany -- any pattern of State conduct.\nThe Congress knew in 1993 that 30 States had\nlaws just like the Family Medical Leave Act. Congress\nwasn't thinking about whether States were violating law\nand whether States needed to be corrected. Congress was\ntrying to supplement what States were already doing with\nthe leave benefit.\nQUESTION:\nby the States. Several States had human rights laws long\nbefore there was any Federal law. At least as to those\nStates Title VII should not have been valid legislation,\nshould it?\nMR. TAGGART: Well --\nQUESTION: Because there was no sign that they\nwere not at least as good as the Federal Government.\nMR. TAGGART: Well, Title VII is, in our view, a\n-- a -- clearly, a law that's clearly antidiscriminatory.\nIt doesn't -- it isn't -- wasn't adopted for Commerce\nClause purposes, and in our view in this -- the Family\nMedical Leave Act is just a round peg being forced into a\nsquare hole. It's not -- wasn't adopted with the\noperation -- with the idea of acting like\nantidiscrimination legislation. It, in fact, would\ncompletely allow for discrimination. It would -- and that\nwouldn't be prohibited by the law at all.\nQUESTION: Okay, if they had passed this statute\nwithout the 12 weeks in it, and the statute had simply\nsaid, on family leave decisions, the decisions have got to\nbe the same, the standard for making them has got to be\nthe same, whether the employer, employee is a man or a\nwoman, would that be constitutional?\nMR. TAGGART: Well, that --\nQUESTION:\nMR. TAGGART: Well, certainly that would sound\nmore like an antidiscrimination law that would require\nleave, if it's granted --\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. TAGGART: -- to be granted on a gender\nneutral basis --\nQUESTION: Now, the difference between that case\nand this -- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt you.\nMR. TAGGART: I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: I was trying to get in another\nquestion before Justice Scalia did.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: The difference between the case I\njust put to you and the case that we've got here is 12\nweeks, and I suggested that one reason for the 12 weeks is\na decision on the part of Congress that if we don't put\nsome period of time, some threshold period of time, our\nnondiscrimination standard isn't going to be worth\nanything.\nFor example, just outside this case, the States\ncould say, okay, we're going to give a 1-week maternity\nleave, men or women. Obviously, that isn't going to\naccomplish anything. So Congress says, we've got to have\nsome kind of a threshold in order to make this requirement\nof neutrality really work.\nway to get to the point which I think we both agree would\nbe a perfectly lawful exercise of power under section (5)?\nMR. TAGGART: Well, first on the latter part, a\nprohibition or a requirement for gender-neutral leave\nwould -- for -- if leave is allowed, it must be allowed on\na gender-neutral basis, I would still argue that that\nwould be, that would require some predicate of a pattern\nof unconstitutional behavior, but --\nQUESTION: Okay. We'll take that as a given.\nYou don't concede that.\nMR. TAGGART: Okay, but on the 12 weeks point,\nthis Court would have to assume, without any indication\nfrom Congress, that that's why it used 12 weeks, because\nthat is not why it used 12 weeks. 12 weeks --\nQUESTION: How many States are covered by the\nact?\nMR. TAGGART: Well, at the time the act was\nadopted --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. TAGGART: -- 30 States had family leave\nlaws.\nQUESTION: How many are covered by the act? To\nhow many States does the act --\nMR. TAGGART: Every State is covered by the act.\nQUESTION: 50 of them.\nemployers are covered by the act?\nMR. TAGGART: Every private employer.\nQUESTION: Yeah, like how many do you think that\nis, hundreds of thousands?\nMR. TAGGART: Yes. Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And the 6 weeks was adopted with the\n50 States in mind, is the argument that's being\npropounded. It's clear that the 6 weeks was designed for\nthe 50 States, never mind the hundreds of thousands of\nprivate employers. Does that seem plausible?\nMR. TAGGART: No, and it -- first it's --\nQUESTION: Doesn't it seem plausible, however,\nthat the period of time was designed in view of the\npervasive history of discrimination in and out of\nGovernment, and that it is just as applicable when it is\napplied to the Government, just as reasonable or\nunreasonable, however you come out, as it is when it's\napplied to private industry? Isn't that a fair argument?\nMR. TAGGART: No, because it's not so simple as\nto draw the conclusions about the society in general\ndirectly to States and impute States with unconstitutional\nbehavior without presuming first that States act in a\nconstitutional way.\nQUESTION: No, I recognize that you're not\nconceding the -- the -- the point that a predicate for\napplying it to the States, even a -- a -- a non-6-weeks\nantidiscrimination has been shown, but if we assume that\npoint is past, then is the argument, is the\nappropriateness of the means somehow categorically\ndifferent for States from the appropriate --\nappropriateness of the means with respect to private\nemployment?\nMR. TAGGART: Well, it's our view that the two\nquestions can't be split, that -- that the State conduct\nis so critical that -- that it -- the answer cannot be\nderived from saying that if -- if there's this conduct in\ngeneral, then 12 weeks fits both State and non-State\nactors. The -- the 12-week benefit was not designed at\nall by Congress to target unconstitutional conduct. It\nwas designed to give children 12 weeks of child\ndevelopment time with their parents when they're born.\nQUESTION: Insofar as the statute applied to\nprivate employers, could it possibly have been directed at\nunconstitutional conduct?\nMR. TAGGART: It may be possible, but -- but\nany --\nQUESTION: I presume --\nQUESTION: But the real question is whether it's\ndirected at discriminatory.\nQUESTION:\nQUESTION: If it's private discrimination, it's\nnot constitutional; if it's State discrimination, it is a\nconstitutional question. Isn't the question whether it's\ndirected at discriminatory conduct? Isn't that the basic\nquestion?\nMR. TAGGART: Well --\nQUESTION: Or do you concede it is directed at\ndiscriminatory conduct.\nMR. TAGGART: No, we do not concede that it's\ndirected at discriminatory conduct.\nQUESTION: But if it were directed at\ndiscrimination, discriminatory conduct, that would embrace\nboth the States and the private employers, wouldn't it?\nMR. TAGGART: Well, that -- we do not concede\nthat point, because Congress did not have any predicate on\nwhich to base the direction of this onto the States, and\nI'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal,\nplease.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Taggart.\nMs. Pillard.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CORNELIA T. L. PILLARD\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. PILLARD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe Family Medical Leave Act is an appropriate\nresponse to enduring problems of State sex discrimination\nbias against women in hiring and promotion because\nemployers assume that women are more likely than men to\nleave their jobs to go take care of their family members,\nand bias against men in the dispensing of family leave.\nCongress gathered ample recent evidence of these\nmutually reinforcing problems, and Congress also built on\na known foundation of State laws and decisions fostering\ndifferent roles for men and women in work and family.\nThose different roles and beliefs about them persist.\nOffering a threshold amount of leave to men and\nwomen alike is responsive to the problems. The act has\nsuccessfully encouraged more men to take the leave, and in\nnarrowing the gap between men's and women's leave rates,\nthe act erodes the very basis of employers' bias against\nwomen. If you will, it makes men and women equally\nunattractive.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. PILLARD: The act also responds to\ndiscrimination against men in the dispensing of leave. A\nbare prohibition against discrimination doesn't do that\nand, in fact, the bare prohibition against discrimination\nin the dispensing of leave had been in place. That's\nTitle VII, and that, for the generation during which Title\nVII applied to the States, that had not succeeded in\neradicating sex-based dispensing of leave, and in the real\nworld --\nQUESTION: Sex-based dispensing of leave by the\nStates?\nMS. PILLARD: By the States.\nQUESTION: Well, what statistics are there that\nsupport that statement?\nMS. PILLARD: Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to\nhighlight four aspects of the evidence of sex-based\ndiscrimination in leave specifically about the States.\nFirst, Congress learned of the pattern of State\ngranting leave through the Bureau of Labor Statistics'\nfigures. In 1987, 50 percent of women in State and local\ngovernment, as compared to 30 percent of men in State and\nlocal government, were offered parenting leave. Yale also\ndid a 50-State survey to which --\nQUESTION: Excuse me, what --\nQUESTION: You know, I presume to get parenting\nleave you have to be a parent, and it doesn't seem to me\nthat that -- that is a terribly instructive statistic\nunless it -- it's shown that equal numbers were parents,\nor equal numbers applied.\nMS. PILLARD: The statute --\nQUESTION: Could you tell me what, before we go\non with the discussion, what you mean by, were offered\nparenting leave?\nMS. PILLARD: Parenting leave was available to\nthem in their State --\nQUESTION: Was available, whether they took it\nor not?\nMS. PILLARD: Whether they took it or not. This\nis not rates of people taking. This is rates of people\nwho had it available.\nQUESTION: Who had the opportunity to take it?\nMS. PILLARD: Should they choose, yes, and the\nBureau of Labor Statistics is very clear on that.\nQUESTION: How -- how could that be? The\nStates' laws were written in such a way that --\nMS. PILLARD: The States' laws and the States'\npolicies, and this is confirmed by other pieces of\nevidence. Yale did a 50-State survey to which 36 States\nresponded, and 19 of those States themselves said they\noffered parenting leave to women and not to men under\ntheir policies.\nQUESTION: Well, that's 19, 19 out of 50 States.\nQUESTION: Excuse me, when you say parenting --\nQUESTION: Let her respond to my question.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. PILLARD: That's 19 out of the 36 responded\nthat themselves admitted that they -- they had these\npolicies. The president of the labor union that\nrepresents State employees said, the vast majority of our\ncontracts really cover maternity leave. They're not --\nQUESTION: Exactly, and that explains the\ndiscrepancy. I'm trying to figure out -- what you're\nsaying is that some States provided for maternity leave,\nbut did not provide any leave for the father, but that's\nquite a different thing.\nI mean, does one have to think that parenting\nleave, which is the ability to go home and take care of a\nchild, is the same as allowing a woman who's just gone\nthrough childbirth some leave to recuperate from the\nchildbirth? I don't think that proves anything at all.\nIt just proves that some States had a policy of maternity\nleave, and presumably if, you know, if one of their male\nemployees gave birth they'd give him maternity leave, too.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. PILLARD: Justice Scalia, let me clarify,\neach of these studies and all the figures that I'm citing\nare not talking about pregnancy disability leave. We're\ntalking about maternity leave over and above pregnancy\ndisability leave, so we're talking about whether it's\nunconstitutional for a State to assume that women and not\nmen can appropriately go home and take --\nQUESTION:\nmedical leave act here. We're not talking about\nparenting, are we?\nMS. PILLARD: We're talking about both. Part of\nthe medical leave provision allows parents to take care of\ntheir seriously ill children as well as their spouses or\nparents, and Congress saw these as part and parcel of the\nsame phenomenon.\nQUESTION: Did any State have parenting leave\nlaws which say, we just want you to have time to take care\nof your family, which applied only to men -- only to women\nand not to men?\nMS. PILLARD: Yes, all --\nQUESTION: I know plenty of States had maternity\nleave. I consider that a different category entirely.\nWere there any States that had parenting leave, time to\ntake care of your family, that applied only to women and\nnot to men?\nMS. PILLARD: Justice Scalia, each of these\nStates, when they called it maternity leave, the important\ndistinction is that it encompassed but was not restricted\nto a period of pregnancy disability.\nWe're talking about, for example, in our lodging\nappendix at page 31, the Rhode Island agreement that\napplied from 1992 to 1995. In provision 13.7, maternity\nleave is available for up to a year, without regard to\npregnancy disability. Another example at page 47, 48 of\nour lodging, maternity leaves not to exceed 6 months, but\nmay be extended, and paternity leaves are available for 3\nmonths, so someone -- a woman can take a maternity leave\nup to a year without a showing of maternity disability,\nand a man can take 3 months. And on page 40 of the\nlodging, again the Pennsylvania agreement says that women\ncan take a period of 6 months, and it may be extended for\n6 months, no provision for a man who is so inclined and\nwho wishes to do so, to go take care of his infant child,\nand I think these stereotypes are very alive and well\ntoday, and the act was --\nQUESTION: Kind of the successor of the man\ngoing down with his babe in arms to ask for an excuse from\njury duty and they said, would tell him no, you don't get\nany excuse, but you give excuses to women. Yes, because\nwomen take care of children. I take care of children.\nThat's the same thing.\nMS. PILLARD: It's precisely these assumptions\nthat have caused State employers and other employers to\ndiscriminate against women in hiring, promotion, and\nretention, and against men in the dispensing of leave, and\nthese are really two sides of the same coin. And the act\nis working. In the 5 years that were studied from 1995 to\n2000, there was a jump from approximately 14 percent to 21\npercent of the percentage of male --\nQUESTION: Would the act be any less valid if we\nwere to conclude it weren't working?\nMS. PILLARD: No, but I think the point is that\nthere's an ongoing problem, and that Congress was correct\nin discerning that this was really at the core of the\nproblem.\nQUESTION: And why couldn't Congress have solved\nthat problem adequately by simply prescribing that no\nState shall discriminate in -- in the -- in the giving of\n-- of family leave?\nMS. PILLARD: Justice Scalia, Congress\nalready --\nQUESTION: No maternity leave, kind of no State\ncan have maternity leave as a separate category, and all\nfamily care leave must be offered equally to men and\nwomen. Why -- why wouldn't that have been a proportionate\nresponse to -- to the defect that they had found? Why --\nwhy did the Federal Government, in order to solve the\nproblem, have to impose upon the States 12 weeks, just\npulled out of the air, 12 weeks, this is the solution to\nthis constitutional problem?\nMS. PILLARD: Justice Scalia, that prohibition\nwas already in place from 1972, and the problem also is\nthat a bare prohibition against discrimination cannot\nrespond to discrimination against men in the dispensing of\nleave, because in the real world a facially neutral policy\nwithout a threshold leave entitlement really equates to a\ndiscretionary practice of dispensing leave tainted by\nstereotypes about who should need it.\nQUESTION: I don't understand what you said.\nMS. PILLARD: Even if employers do not\naffirmatively provide for any leave, they equally have a\nno-leave policy for men and women that is formally equal.\nIn the real world, some workers ask for leave and some do\nget family leave, but by leaving it up to supervisor\ndiscretion we open the door --\nQUESTION: But there's --\nMS. PILLARD: -- to discrimination.\nQUESTION: But where -- is it supervisor\ndiscretion? You -- the supervisor cannot discriminate on\nthe basis of sex. I think what you're saying is that\nwithout this 12-week period, many men just wouldn't take\nthe leave. That's probably right, but then many men\nwouldn't necessarily take the 12-week leave either, if\nit's available.\nMS. PILLARD: Many men would be deterred, if\nthey didn't have an affirmative right to take the leave,\nby the assumption that their employers would not grant\nthem leave if they requested it, by the assumption that\nthey would be retaliated against in the employment process\nif they took it, because it is still much more\nunacceptable for men to take family leave than for women.\nQUESTION: Let me ask this question about the\noperation of this law in light of our recent cases on the\nEleventh Amendment. Is it your understanding that because\nof the exercise of the Commerce Clause power, that the\nStates are bound by this law --\nMS. PILLARD: That's right.\nQUESTION: -- to grant the leave?\nMS. PILLARD: That's right, Justice Kennedy.\nQUESTION: So all we're talking -- and -- and do\nyou think that State attorney generals like -- probably\nMr. Taggart would be the better one to ask that\nquestion -- would tell their Governors and their officials\nyou are bound, by law, to grant the family -- to follow\nthe Family Medical Leave Act?\nMS. PILLARD: So the question is, why damages?\nOnce Congress has found a problem, a serious problem of\nunconstitutional discrimination, that we assert exists\nhere, the standard remedy to enforce rights in the\nemployment context is make whole monetary relief, the\ncenterpiece of which is lost wages. Title VII uses\ndamages, the Equal Pay Act uses damages, and here, in the\nFamily Medical Leave Act, these are limited damages.\nCongress took great care to ensure that they wouldn't\noverburden the States --\nQUESTION: I understand that, but it seems to me\nif there's a big problem you can have an Ex Parte Young\nsuit or, if the Government just is -- the United States is\nconcerned about this, the Government of the United States\ncan intervene, and why isn't that wholly adequate --\nMS. PILLARD: Congress determined --\nQUESTION: -- to enforce this law?\nMS. PILLARD: Congress considered very carefully\nthat damages were needed, and limited the damages.\nThey're just enough to spur enforcement and not burden\nemployers, including the States. You need money damages\nto make sure cases get the attention of higher-ups in\nState government as well as in private industry.\nStates at the highest levels may be fully\nresponsive, but the application of stereotypes is\ntypically at the lower level of the supervisor with\nhiring, promotion, and assignment discretion, the line\nsupervisor in the State university, in the State hospital,\nin the State troopers, in the State human services\nagencies, like where Mr. Hibbs worked, and without the\nclear commitment by Congress that a threshold of family\nleave is going to be made available not on an ad hoc\nbasis, not according to supervisor decisions about who\nreally needs the leave, but because Federal law requires\nit as a remedy for past discrimination. Only then will\nthat message really reach the line supervisors who are\nmaking these decisions.\nSo I would emphasize that the act is working,\nthe damages are limited, and the problems at which it aims\nare clearly unconstitutional, and petitioners are just\nwrong that there was no evidence in the legislative\nrecord. Congress clearly identified the problems, the\nproblems of the States as on a par with problems of other\nsectors.\nCongress was well aware of the body of recent\njudicial decisions, finding State sex discrimination in\nemployment. We've included some illustrative examples in\nour brief at footnote 23. The United States has included\nsome examples of the most recent cases in their brief at\nnote 15 and, as I was discussing before, Congress learned\nof the patterns of States granting leave to women but not\nto men, and Congress saw the family medical issue as part\nand parcel of the parenting leave issue. These were all\nresponsibilities, family care responsibilities\ntraditionally performed by wives. And so Congress aimed\nin subsections (a), (b), and (c) at a common problem of\nemployers' assumptions of women taking leave burdening\ntheir employment prospects, and employers' assumptions\nthat men did not need the leave, hindering their ability\nto take it, which in turn exacerbates the discrimination\nproblem against -- against women.\nSo denial of employment opportunity to women and\nof family leave to men are two sides of the same coin.\nCongress clearly identified the problems, had facts\nshowing that they continued. Nearly every State, until a\ngeneration ago, overtly placed discriminatory restrictions\non womens' workforce participation. That history --\nQUESTION: A generation ago. How many years is\na generation?\nMS. PILLARD: Well, when Congress was acting in\n1993, it was only 20 years since Title VII had been\nextended to the States, and less than that since this\nCourt had adopted heightened scrutiny of sex-based\nclassifications based on the recognition that public\nagencies have a -- have a tendency to rely on overbroad\nsex-based generalizations, overbroad sex-based\nclassifications, so it was -- it was only since the 1970's\nthat we started to recognize that discrimination that we\nhad previously seen as benign, as often intended to help\nwomen, was really hindering their advancement, and to --\nand to seek to try to dismantle that system.\nQUESTION: And the changes in the unemployment\nand Workers' Compensation laws, those persisted. Wasn't\nthe Wengler decision in 1980?\nMS. PILLARD: That's right. We have\ndecisions --\nQUESTION: And States all have that kind of one-\nway law, where the woman did not -- if the woman wage\nearner died, then her husband got nothing because she was\nnot considered really an equal worker.\nMS. PILLARD: Really her wages were\nsupplemental.\nQUESTION: And that went on till 1980.\nMS. PILLARD: That's exactly right, and we have\nthe beginning of a process of dismantling this\ndiscrimination.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Pillard.\nMr. Dinh.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF VIET D. DINH\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT UNITED STATES\nMR. DINH: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThe Family and Medical Leave Act is just one\npart of a broader statutory scheme to eliminate sex-based\nemployment discrimination in the hiring, retention,\npromotion, and granting of leave benefits for both men and\nwomen, and that's the key point to emphasize here.\nCongress was acting not simply to remedy discrimination in\nleave-granting policies, but more fundamentally Congress\nsought to remedy and prevent sex-based employment\ndiscrimination based on impermissible presumptions about\nthe role of women in the home and the role of men in the\noffice.\nQUESTION: I --\nQUESTION: In our cases, is there any difference\nbetween Congress' prohibiting something under its section\n5 power and creating a substantive entitlement under that\npower?\nMR. DINH: I have not seen a distinction in the\ncases, in the section 5 cases of this Court. They are few\nand far between, as you can --\nQUESTION: Uh-huh, right.\nMR. DINH: -- as you can appreciate, but the\ndistinction is not readily made. One can characterize the\nentitlement here as simply a prohibition on discrimination\nfor men and women who take leave. It is simply an --\nQUESTION: No, it isn't, it's 12 weeks.\nQUESTION: -- entitlement to come back to a job.\nQUESTION: Well, it's a 12-week period.\nQUESTION: It says you get 12 weeks, and if --\nif we approve this, we are establishing the proposition\nthat in order to eliminate, to enforce any of the\nprovisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, but in particular\nequal protection, the Government may establish whatever\nsubstantive requirements might further equal protection,\nand I just don't know where the Government plucks 12 weeks\nfrom and says that it -- we have to stop discrimination,\nand therefore everybody's entitled to 12 weeks of leave,\nand it's an extraordinary leap.\nMR. DINH: Your Honor, I disagree that there is\nno limiting principle here, and the limiting principle is\nprecisely provided by this Court's jurisprudence in\ncongruence and proportionality. That's precisely the\nlimiting principle as to what is the constitutional\nviolation that Congress seeks to redress, and whether or\nnot the remedy is congruent and proportional.\nThe constitutional violation here that Congress\nseeks to redress or to prevent is employment-based\ndiscrimination based upon presumptions about leave-taking\nhabits of men and women.\nQUESTION: And was that the big fight in the\nstatute? Is that what was really going on when this 12-\nweek -- I mean, I -- I was around at the time, and I\nremember the big -- the big discussion was whether there\nought to be a Federal law that requires all employers, not\nStates in particular, but all employers to give all\nworkers 12 weeks of family leave if they wanted it. That\nwas what all the discussion was.\ndiscussion at the time of sex discrimination, and you\npresent it to us as though this was the motivating factor\nof the legislation. I find that hard to believe.\nMR. DINH: Your Honor, I was not there at the\ntime, and I --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DINH: But I will take your word for it, but\nmore importantly, I think we should take Congress' word on\nits face. Congress says at 29 U.S.C. 2601(b)(5) that the\npurpose of the, one of the purpose of the statute is,\nquote, to promote the goal of equal employment opportunity\nfor women and men pursuant to the Equal Protection Clause,\nand the further evidence --\nQUESTION: Justice Scalia is right, is he not,\nthat it -- the bill that he's talking about was the '87\nbill, and that didn't say anything about the Equal\nProtection Clause, and that's the startling difference\nbetween the bill that actually passed in 1993.\nMR. DINH: That's precisely right, Justice\nO'Connor -- I mean, Justice Ginsburg. Justice Scalia was\ntalking about S. 249, the 1987 bill. The first time that\nthe section (5), the promotion goal that entered into the\nstatute was in the next iteration, H.R. 925 in the House,\nin 1987, and concurrent with the insertion of the\npromotion of equal opportunity, Congress also included the\nprovision for family leave for care of parent illnesses,\nas opposed to simple -- simply children illnesses. And so\nthere is some concurrency with respect to Congress'\nreliance on, for the first time, section (5) authority and\nthe grant of family leave, and that's consistent with the\nlegislative record that was before Congress.\nCongress was facing a situation where it was\nfinding more two-worker families entering in the workforce\nand increased demand for family care in the workforce, and\nit said that, based upon the evidence, as Justice Souter\nhad summarized, that when push came to shove, women would\nbe expected to take leave to take care of the family, and\nCongress was finding that push was, indeed, coming to\nshove, and was adopting a remedy that was directly\nproportional and congruent to the period of constitutional\nviolation. It adopted a gender-neutral entitlement to\nleave so as to eliminate the underlying presumption that\nthis Court has said is impermissible.\nQUESTION: Would 24 weeks have been\nproportional?\nMR. DINH: Your Honor, I'd -- that would be a\nmore difficult case. I do not think that --\nQUESTION: 6 weeks? Would 6 weeks be\nproportional?\nMR. DINH:\nthink that this Court's jurisprudence on proportionality\nhas fine -- is so finely tuned, and this Court's lack\nof --\nQUESTION: Of course, that jurisprudence came\nafter the statute was enacted anyway.\nMR. DINH: And I do not think that this Court's\nevaluation of congressional enactments under section (5),\nthe unique remedial powers of Congress under section (5),\nwould turn on whether it's 10 weeks or 12 weeks or 13\nweeks. Of course, if it is more an increase, then it\nwould be less proportional, if it is less, then it would\nbe more proportional.\nQUESTION: I agree that it shouldn't turn on the\nlength. That's the point I was getting to. I can't\nimagine that it would turn on the length.\nQUESTION: Perhaps Justice Scalia should ask\nthis question, but I was just wondering --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: -- if you have to get to the --\nQUESTION: Pass it to me. I'll --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: You have to get to the 1993 version\nof the statute to introduce the equal protection notion,\nand it's interesting to me that precisely the same remedy\nwas provided after the equal protection became an\ningredient of the problem as was provided before the equal\nprotection rationale was introduced.\nMR. DINH: You mean, that same remedy, you mean\nnumber of weeks?\nQUESTION: The same 12-week period. Wasn't that\ntrue?\nMR. DINH: Not exactly, Your Honor. H -- the\nfirst time that the family leave was introduced and the\nfirst time the section (5) authority was invoked was in\nH.R. 925, and there were differing leave times for\ndifferent provisions.\nI believe there was one that for section (d),\nfor the personal disability, it was 24 weeks. Some was at\n6 weeks. It turns out that when Congress passed this\nstatute, a prior version of which was 1990, 1991, and this\nversion in 1993, it pretty much reached the equilibrium of\n12 weeks. This is the normal give-and-take of the\nlegislative process, and nowhere in this Court's\njurisprudence --\nQUESTION: And this was the statute that was\nrepeatedly vetoed, as I remember it, the bill, by\nPresident Bush, and the basis for the veto had nothing to\ndo with discrimination, that it really was based on the\nlength of the provision.\nMR. DINH:\nI have reviewed the veto statements. They concern the\nimposition that these types of policies would have on\nsmall businesses and the economy of the United States,\nrather than on the discrimination provisions at issue.\nBut it's clear that Congress, in passing the statute, was\nrelying on the discrimination, discriminatory effects that\nthese types of leave policies would have on women. And I\nthink the crux of this case, if I may, turns exactly,\nJustice O'Connor, on your comparison with the evidence\nthat was before Congress when it enacted Title VII, when\nit extended that, when it included that into the gender.\nAs you may recall, this Court in, I believe in\nPrice Waterhouse v. Hopkins, recounted the legislative\nhistory of how gender entered into Title VII, and it was\nentered there as the legislative equivalent of the poison\npill in order to attempt to kill Title VII, and so not\nmuch evidence was put into the record regarding gender\ndiscrimination, and yet, as you noted in 1976, in\nFitzpatrick v. Bitzer, this Court assumed that that was\nadequate in order to invoke section (5) authority, or\njustify section (5) authority.\nQUESTION: Do -- do you want us to say that\nbefore the Family Medical Leave Act was enacted there was\na discernible pattern of intentional and purposeful\ndiscrimination by the States in violation of the Equal\nProtection Clause with reference to the granting of leave?\nMR. DINH: There was evidence, with respect to\nthe granting of leave, of such discrimination in the\nrecord before Congress, yes, Your Honor, but in addition\nto that, there was a discernible pattern of employment\ndiscrimination that this Court had taken judicial notice\nof and Congress had before it and, in particular, Congress\nhas evidence of employment discrimination based on leave-\ntaking presumptions that this Court has found to be\nillegal.\nQUESTION: I guess you're thinking under this\nCourt's cases, which we accept as a given, Congress would\nhave more leeway to create a remedy for the general\ndiscrimination than it might have if the discrimination,\nthat if the leave discrimination were at issue?\nMR. DINH: It goes into both the --\nQUESTION: You think there's enough for both,\nbut the remedial power is greater, is that right?\nMR. DINH: There's no question that under the --\nunder Kimel the Court has said that difficult, intractable\nproblems often require more powerful remedies, and that\nwould certainly be the, how the Court would evaluate --\nQUESTION: It's hard for me to see there's a\ndiscernible pattern of intentional and purposeful\ndiscrimination when in the legislative history of this act\nthe States were cited as being in the forefront of\nenlightened policies. That's what the record shows, and\nyou're up here arguing just the opposite.\nMR. DINH: Your Honor, some States were in the\nvanguard, some States were laggards in the granting of\nleave policies.\nQUESTION: But the latter was not mentioned.\nMR. DINH: Yes, there -- yes, it was, Your\nHonor. I would refer Your Honor to the United States\nbrief at pages 36 to 40, and also the brief for the\npetitioner at pages 29 through 30, which recounts some of\nthis -- some of this evidence.\nThe key here -- but nevertheless, the statement\nin the record that you noted was about States' leave\npolicies, whether or not they had leave policies at all.\nWe know 30 States had -- had leave policy. The position\nof the United States rests upon not whether States had\nleave policy, but the character of such leave policies.\nQUESTION: Mr. Dinh, would it violate this\nstatute for a State to provide the 12-week family leave to\nmen and women both, but also to continue a policy of 6-\nweek maternity leave? Would that violate the statute?\nMR. DINH: In addition to a 12-week, Your Honor?\nQUESTION: In addition to the 12 weeks.\nMR. DINH:\nweeks, if I can characterize the 6\nweeks not as maternity leave, but as pregnancy disability\nleave --\nQUESTION: Call it pregnancy disability leave.\nMR. DINH: Well, this is actually a matter of\nquite -- quite good -- quite --\nQUESTION: What's in a name?\nMR. DINH: No, no, it is a matter of substance,\nnot form alone, because pregnancy disability, medically\nand in insurance terms --\nQUESTION: No necessity to prove disability,\njust, if you have a child, you're entitled to 6 weeks off.\nMR. DINH: If you are --\nQUESTION: You don't have to prove that you\ncan't walk, or anything else, just, if you have a child,\nyou have 6 weeks off.\nMR. DINH: If --\nQUESTION: Would that violate this act?\nMR. DINH: If the grant of the additional 6\nweeks is on a sex-based basis --\nQUESTION: Well, it is. It's maternity. I\nmean --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DINH: If that is the case, then that\nwould -- that may very well violate Title VII. It would\nnot violate this particular statute.\nQUESTION: Would it violate the Equal Protection\nClause?\nMR. DINH: Yes, it may very well violate the\nEqual Protection Clause if it is above and beyond the\npregnancy disability leave that this Court has recognized\ncan be accommodated, unconstitutionally though --\nQUESTION: That would solve the problem, unless\nyour answer is categorically yes, it would violate it,\nbecause then the discrepancy, the 30 percent versus 80\npercent that we're talking about would continue.\nMR. DINH: Well, the -- the key here, Justice\nScalia, is that after the period that is recognized as\npregnancy disability, and therefore constitutional under\nGeduldig, beyond that, parental leave, infant care leave\nis simply parental leave, and there's no difference\nwhether the mother or the father takes care of the child.\nIndeed, the law would not countenance such a\ndifference, because that would be relying on the very\npresumptions that the law condemns. And so the key here\nis that if there is an additional grant of leave to either\nsex beyond the period of pregnancy disability, that would\nconstitute a violation of Title VII. It would not\nconstitute a violation of the FMLA.\nThe reason for that is very simple. The FMLA\nwas enacted as part of the overall antidiscrimination\nscheme. It supplements and does not supplant Title VII.\nIt paints a little bit more broad -- more broadly than\nTitle VII in the sense that it grants affirmative leave\nrights, but in one further, in one important respect it\npaints very much more narrowly, as your -- as your\nquestion to my colleague, Mr. Taggart, had indicated,\nJustice Kennedy. That is because it is very narrowly\ntailored to the particular problem that Congress was\nfacing, which is the problem of employment discrimination\nbased on leave-taking propensities. And so in that sense\nit is perfectly congruent to the constitutional problem\nthat Congress was addressing.\nCongress could not very well have addressed the\nproblem of gender-based differentials and the presumptions\nin law and in practice that arise from those differentials\nby granting additional leave rights only to women, or\ngranting leave rights only to men that would perpetuate\nthe discrimination and the presumptions, rather than\neliminate it root and branch.\nThe key to the money damages is the same key as\nit is in our general antidiscrimination statutes. That\nshould not be a surprising -- Title VII has the same type\nof damage remedies, and the reason for that is that\ndiscrimination, whether it be for race or for gender, is\npervasive and pernicious and historically recognized by\nthis Court, and so Congress has made a judgment that it\nneeds as many hands on deck as possible in order to\nenforce the effort to eradicate discrimination, and money\ndamages is part of the normal remedy in order to ensure\nthat plaintiffs are made whole and State actors are\ndeterred from acting unconstitutionally or, in this case,\nin violation of the section (5) legislation that is at the\n-- the -- at issue here.\nThe fact that -- if I may return to the point\nthat the fact that it should not be surprising that this\nCourt assumed in Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer that the -- that\nCongress had authority under section (5) to include gender\ndiscrimination in Title VII, because in the same year was\nthe year that the Court for the first time extended\nheightened scrutiny in Craig v. Boren, so --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Dinh.\nMR. DINH: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Mr. Taggart, you have 4 minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL G. TAGGART\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. TAGGART: First, it's important to\ndistinguish that paternity leave and leave for childbirth\nand when a child is adopted is not the question that was\npresented to this Court today.\nThe question presented to this Court is family\nleave, and there's certainly no record of family leave\ndifferentials, as has been argued with respect to\nparenting leave, and second, it is not possible under any\njurisprudence of this Court to simply presume that State\nmanagers discriminate based upon some stereotype. Title\nVII doesn't do that, the Equal Protection Clause, this\nCourt's section (1) jurisprudence that interprets the\nEqual Protection Clause doesn't do that, the heightened\nscrutiny test does not do that, it does not allow someone\nto simply presume that State managers are using some --\nsome outdated stereotype in making their decisions.\nThe third point I want to make is, it's our\nposition that one who reads the text and the history of\nthe Family and Medical Leave Act would hardly recognize\nthe statute that has been described here today. This was\nsimply every-day economic legislation, and upholding the\nFMLA would simply tear section (5) from any remedial\nmoorings by allowing a general legislative power of\nCongress to grant economic benefits so long as there is\nsome incidental benefit to some suspect class.\nQUESTION: You mean holding, upholding money\ndamages under the FMLA, because I take it you concede, or\ndon't you, that Nevada is bound to follow this law?\nMR. TAGGART:\nsince 1993 Nevada has had a -- a State policy of giving\nour workers Federal family medical leave. We also have\nour own State medical leave laws, so States have joined,\nand have actually led the Federal Government in providing\nfamily leave for their employees, and to simply say, and\nignore that -- that pattern and say instead that States\nare engaged in a pattern of discrimination, or were\nengaged in 1993 in a pattern of discrimination, in our\nview does not stand up to any of this Court's section (1)\njurisprudence.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\n"
