        "content": "(11:14 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in No. 02-626, the South Florida Water Management\nDistrict v. the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians.\nMr. Bishop.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY S. BISHOP\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BISHOP: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nCongress in the Clean Water Act provided that a\nsection 402 permit is required for an addition of\npollutants from a point source to navigable waters.\nNow, the South Florida Water Management District\nconcedes that the S-9 pump, through which it conveys\nnavigable waters from a canal to a water conservation\narea, is a confined, discrete, discernible conveyance, and\nwe agree that the water in the C-11 canal contains\npollution which enters that water from a wide variety of\npoint and non-point sources.\nWhat we do say is that our pumps do not add\npollutants to navigable waters. There is no addition of\npollutants to navigable waters when navigable waters are\nsimply moved around, which occurs all the time every day\nall around the country as public water management agencies\nallocate and transfer the navigable waters to serve\nbeneficial public purposes.\nQUESTION: The obvious question on your thing is\nyou have one of these rivers that's so filthy that you can\nset fire to it, and next to it is the most pristine,\nbeautiful trout lake ever. And so what we build is a\nlittle pipe and the pipe takes these filthy, absolutely\ndisgusting water and pours it into this beautiful,\npristine trout pond. All right?\nNow, you're saying that that doesn't fall within\nthe statute, and --\nMR. BISHOP: No. It does fall within the\nstatute.\nQUESTION:\nMR. BISHOP: It -- it would not require a\nsection 402 permit. There are all sorts of layers of\nprotection from that occurring. That would never --\nQUESTION: Well, as far as this statute is\nconcerned, EPA, it wouldn't. And -- and, of course, the\nobvious thing is that --\nMR. BISHOP: No. That -- that's not true\neither, Justice Breyer.\nQUESTION: I mean, EPA through the permit.\nThrough the permit.\nMR. BISHOP: Through the 402, but this -- this\nis a complex statute with many, many layers of protections\nfor the Nation's waters.\nQUESTION: And it would protect --\nMR. BISHOP: To begin with, there is always a\nlayer of State protection. The statute requires that\nwater quality standards be established for portions of the\nnavigable waters. Those water quality standards are\nimplemented through total maximum daily load requirements\nthat the States are -- are required under the statute to\n-- to design. The States implement the TMDL's and the\nwater quality standards through non-point source pollution\nprograms that include land use restrictions, that include\nadvice to and requirements on landowners as to best\nmanagement practices.\nQUESTION: I -- I suppose it's beyond the\npurview of this case. Do we know whether or not the\ntransfer of waters in this case would violate those other\nregulations?\nMR. BISHOP: No, it does not. The -- the --\nthere are exceedances. Understand that the S-9 pump,\nwhile not permitted under 402, is permitted by the State\nunder The Everglades Forever Act. But there are water\nquality standards for the canal and for the water\nconservation area. The -- there is compliance with both\nof those. There are exceedances, phosphorus exceedances,\nfrom time to time, but those are built into the permit.\nThe -- the cleaning up of the Everglades, which\nis something that everyone is committed to and the\ndistrict is deeply committed to, is not an overnight\nprocess. And so there are plans through the Comprehensive\nEverglades Restoration statute and also under The\nEverglades Forever Act to address these exceedances in the\nlong term, but --\nQUESTION: Mr. Bishop, the Eleventh Circuit said\nthat moving water within a single, distinct body of water\ncould never result in the addition of pollutants to that\nbody of water. Now, I assume you agree with that\nstatement?\nMR. BISHOP:\nthe United States go further here in arguing that the\nstatute -- what the statute prohibits is the addition of\npollutants to navigable waters. Navigable waters are\ndefined in the statute as the waters of the United States.\nIt's our position and the position of the United States,\nif I read their brief correctly, that an addition of\npollutants from a point source occurs when the pollutant\nis introduced to the navigable waters for the first time.\nAnd that is what the --\nQUESTION: So in -- in Justice Breyer's example,\nif the pristine trout pond is waters of the United States,\nthen there would not be an addition of the pollutant to\nwaters of the United States when the filthy river was\npumped into the pond.\nMR. BISHOP: No. That would violate State water\nquality standards which are --\nQUESTION: No. I -- maybe it would violate the\nstandards, but I'm -- I'm just talking about the provision\nrequired here.\nMR. BISHOP: It would not require a section 402\npermit, Justice Souter.\nQUESTION: And -- and it would not do so because\nit would not be the addition of a pollutant to waters of\nthe United States.\nMR. BISHOP: That is right.\nQUESTION: Assuming the river is navigable, the\nfilthy river. Right?\nMR. BISHOP: Assuming that it's a navigable\nwater under the Clean Water Act --\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. BISHOP: -- and that -- which is a broader\nconcept than waters that one can run --\nQUESTION: Well, what I'm driving at here is --\nis the following. You have ambiguous language. I think\nit's a very difficult question. If I accept your side of\nit, it seems to me I live -- leave the EPA without any\npower to deal with what I just called the filthy river\nproblem, or at least not the -- I'm not trying to be\ntricky in my words. I -- I understand they have other\nauthority and so forth. But there is a filthy river\nproblem if I take your side of it.\nAnd if I take their -- if I take your side of\nit, that is some kind of a problem. You can explain to me\nin 1 second why it's no problem whatsoever. I'd like to\nhear that. I want to say the opposite thing.\nYour problem that you raise, if I take their\nside, is suddenly everybody in the California water\nproject, which is huge, central valley irrigation, has to\nrun off and get permits, and that too is a big problem.\nSo it sounds to me that that second problem\ncould be dealt with by EPA through rules that would, in\neffect, not make them come in because they'd automatically\nget permits in certain circumstances. But if I take your\nside of it, the opposite filthy river problem, there's\nnothing to be done.\nMR. BISHOP: Your premise --\nQUESTION: So that's what I say moves me at the\nsecond for hypothetical purposes towards their side, but\nI'm asking you to move me back.\nMR. BISHOP: Your premise is incorrect, Justice\nBreyer. Of course, moving filthy water to a pristine\nwater is a problem. I've already explained that it's\naddressed and addressed comprehensively and rigorously at\nthe State level, as Congress contemplated in the statute\nthrough the water quality standards and TMDL's.\nBut beyond that, it is simply wrong to say that\nthe Federal Government lacks power in these cases.\nFirst of all, it has broad power under section\n10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act to protect navigability,\nand that -- that provision also includes power for the\nCorps to engage in a broad public interest review whenever\nthe course of a waterway is changed.\nSecond, there are other provisions that deal\nwith emergency type situations. If public health or\nwelfare, for example, is implicated, then section 504 of\nthe statute gives EPA broad powers to go into court and\nget a restraining order not just for the discharge of\npollutants, but much more broadly than that.\nQUESTION: Mr. Bishop, can we see -- take this\nconcrete case? I mean, this is a case about phosphorus\nbeing dumped into a relatively unpolluted body of water.\nWhat is the State of Florida or anybody doing to reduce\nthe level of phosphorus that comes from this pump and gets\ndumped into the pure water?\nMR. BISHOP: Well, this has -- this has been the\nfocus of not only our attention but of the Corps and EPA's\nattention for a long time through the -- the Comprehensive\nEverglades Restoration Project. If I can -- and there are\na lot of things that are happening to -- to reduce the\nphosphorus level, some of which are sort of purely State\nwater quality standard implementation projects, such as\nprohibiting the sale of certain types of fertilizers,\nrestricting the use of fertilizers that contain\nphosphorus. But the long-term CERP plans here have\nessentially two components.\nThe first one is that much of the water in the\nC-11 basin, in the canal, actually comes from the\nconservation area through seepage. There's an enormous\namount of --\nQUESTION: Yes.\n-- I know some seeps through, but what is the principal\nsource of the water in the C-11 basin?\nMR. BISHOP: Well, my understanding is that it\nis seepage. I mean, obviously there are --\nQUESTION: You think that's the principal\nsource? It seeps in. You're just pumping it back into\nthe Everglades?\nMR. BISHOP: That is my -- that is my\nunderstanding. There is an enormous amount of seepage,\nand the seepage involved --\nQUESTION: But where does the water that the\npeople in the western part of Broward County use to water\ntheir lawns and bathe and so -- where does that water come\nfrom?\nMR. BISHOP: From -- from the aquifer. I mean,\nobviously, in -- in --\nQUESTION: There's an aquifer to the east of the\n-- of the levees?\nMR. BISHOP: There is an aquifer that -- an\nunconfined aquifer that is really indistinguishable from\nthe surface water that underlies the levee. But it's --\nit is not divided by the levee. It underlies the water,\nthe surface water, on both sides --\nQUESTION: Are you telling me there's an aquifer\nto the east of the levee?\nMR. BISHOP: To the east of the levees and to\nthe -- it's --\nQUESTION: Which is a separate source of water\nthan the source that feeds the large -- the WCA-3 --\nMR. BISHOP: No, no. This is an aquifer that\nunderlies both sides of the levee, the WCA and the basin.\nBut if I can get back to -- I mean, your -- your\nquestion. Obviously, the seepage is an enormous source.\nWhat I am told is that seepage alone will be enough to\nflood out towns like --\nQUESTION: But the seepage can't --\nMR. BISHOP: There is other --\nQUESTION: But the seepage can't contain any of\nthe pollution --\nMR. BISHOP: No.\nQUESTION: -- because the water on the west side\nof the levee is -- is clean.\nMR. BISHOP: Well, it's not clean. I mean, it\ndoes contain pollutants under the definition of the Clean\nWater Act because that's a broad definition.\nQUESTION: Well, it's certainly cleaner than the\nwater on the east side or you wouldn't have a lawsuit.\nMR. BISHOP: There is a substantial amount of\nwater in the C-11 canal that comes from a -- a wide array\nof sources within the basin.\nQUESTION: But the water -- the seepage clearly\nis not what causes the problem.\nMR. BISHOP: And that is -- just to go back to\nJustice Ginsburg's question, one way that we are\naddressing the phosphorus here is with the Corps. The\nCorps has built a new set of pumps right next to the S-9\nthat is intended to intercept that cleaner seepage water,\nand it will pump that seepage water right back into the\nWCA before it is mixed with the more polluted waters from\nthe C-11 basin. So that is one part of the effort. It is\nto get the seepage water back into the water conservation\narea before it mixes with more polluted water.\nQUESTION: Which -- which means --\nMR. BISHOP: Those pumps are --\nQUESTION: Which means that the water to the\neast will be even more polluted and when you pump that\nback in, you'll be pumping more polluted water back in.\nMR. BISHOP: And the solution to that problem is\nthat with the Corps and the task force and the EPA, a\nnumber of huge storage basins are being built. These\nrequire, obviously, buying a lot of land, putting together\nthe land necessary for these STA's. But the -- the\npurpose of the plans under CERP is to stop as much water\nas possible getting from the C-11 to the water\nconservation area.\npossible in these basins will allow the phosphorus and\nother pollutants to settle out, and so water that is --\nand will also reduce the total amount of water that needs\nto be sent back into the conservation area.\nThe combination of these new pumps getting the\n-- the cleaner water back into the -- into the\nconservation area and the storage basins, which will\nreduce the amount of flow and allow the pollutants to --\nto seep down, is -- is the essential way in which under\nCERP the problem of the phosphorus will be addressed.\nNo one disputes -- and the district least of all\ndisputes -- that cleaning up the Everglades and reducing\nthe amount of phosphorus that gets into the water\nconservation area which, in turn, feeds the Everglades is\na very important consideration.\nBut you also have to understand that our\npurposes -- we are not -- we are not just dumping this\nwater in -- in the water conservation area. This water\ncould be sent to the ocean. In fact, on the eastern\nportion of the canal, the water is sent to the ocean. But\nthe -- there are other functions, important functions,\nthat are served by the water conservation area,\nmaintaining water in there. One is the ability to --\nQUESTION: This is all very important, but on\nthe legal question that we have, do you take the position\nthat it's a single body of water --\nMR. BISHOP: We take --\nQUESTION: -- and therefore no permit is\nrequired?\nMR. BISHOP: We take the position, first of all,\nthat all of the navigable waters of the United States are\nunitary for purposes of determining whether they are --\nQUESTION: That's an extreme position, and you\nprobably have a fall-back position.\nMR. BISHOP: And the alternative --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: You -- you go --\nMR. BISHOP: We do argue --\nQUESTION: What -- what's the fall-back?\nMR. BISHOP: The fall-back is precisely the one\nthat you have described, Justice O'Connor, which is that\nthese were -- these were unitary waters. They are divided\nsolely by manmade structures that are changeable and are\nchanging.\nQUESTION: Well, they have been altered by\nmanmade structures so that they perhaps are no longer a\nsingle body. Is that what the Eleventh Circuit concluded\nin effect?\nMR. BISHOP: Yes, I think the --\nQUESTION: That the manmade structures have\nseparated them and they're no longer unitary.\nMR. BISHOP: It -- it did, but in doing that, it\nignored a number of important considerations. One is the\nunitary aquifer that I have talked about. The second is\nthe constant circulation --\nQUESTION: Does the record describe that\naquifer? Does the record describe that aquifer?\nMR. BISHOP: The -- yes. I -- I believe it's\nJ.A. 177.\nQUESTION: While you're looking for that, I -- I\nfind it hard to understand how you can interpret -- I can\nunderstand how you can interpret the phrase, navigable\nwaters, to mean all navigable waters. I can't understand\nhow you can interpret the phrase, navigable waters, to\nmean only those navigable waters that are within a single\naquifer or within a single drainage district. How -- how\ncan you possibly derive that interpretation from the text?\nMR. BISHOP: No, I agree, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: Which is -- which is why you took the\nextreme position, that is really textually not very\nextreme at all.\nMR. BISHOP: No. I agree with that, Justice\nScalia, obviously. But I -- but I do think that if there\nwere a level of discomfort with that argument, which I\nthink is -- you know, it's fully justified by the statute.\nAnd I'd like to come back to that, Justice O'Connor, and\nexplain the other textual basis for -- for that argument.\nNevertheless --\nQUESTION: Mr. Bishop, as I --\nMR. BISHOP: -- the concept of an addition --\nQUESTION: -- as I understand, that was the\nGovernment's brief and it was spelled out very clearly. I\ndidn't understand your brief to be taking the position\nthat all we have to worry about is the term, navigable\nwater, then that's the end of it.\nMR. BISHOP: Well, we think that there is more\nto it than just the term, navigable water. We think that\n-- that we do -- we have argued throughout this case,\nincluding in the lower courts, that the navigable waters\nare a unitary concept for purposes of section 402.\nQUESTION: Mr. Bishop, isn't the problem with\nthe unitary concept idea that given the purposes of the\nClean Water Act, it makes great sense if there is a way of\ndistinguishing between bodies of water to distinguish them\nin terms of their -- their pollution? And the -- in -- in\neffect, the -- the function of the kind of unitary\ndefinition is a function that -- that works against the\nprotection of clean water as against to dirty water that\ncan be added to it. And -- and shouldn't the -- shouldn't\nthe purposes of the act be taken into consideration in\ndefining what is a body or a unified body of water?\nMR. BISHOP: The act does distinguish. Congress\ndistinguished, when it wanted to, between the waters of\nthe United States and specific portions of the navigable\nwater. And there's an example of that at the bottom of 7a\nin the addendum.\nQUESTION: Are -- are you talking about a -- a\ndistinction based on the -- the quality of the water as\npolluted or clean or relatively polluted/relatively clean?\nMR. BISHOP: The statute specifies that water\nquality standards which identify what the goal is for the\nlevel of pollutants in the water and the TMDL's, the total\nmaximum daily loads, that are used to achieve those water\nquality standards are set for specific portions or parts\nof the navigable water. That is, the State -- a State\nrole is to identify, implement, and to enforce those water\nquality standards which do apply to separate bodies of\nwater. The regulations talk about bodies of water.\nQUESTION: So you're saying -- you're saying\nthat the problem that I'm raising is a problem that is\ndealt with solely by water quality standards and cannot be\ndealt with by -- by point source emission regulation.\nMR. BISHOP: Well, I mean, that's -- that's -- I\nmean, because of the complexities of the act, that's not\nquite right.\nclearly distinguished between the navigable waters and\nthose portions as to which water quality standards were to\nbe set. In implementing water quality standards, a State\nmay take account of the -- of effluence reaching the water\nthrough point sources. And in fact, there is a separate\nprovision of the statute --\nQUESTION: All right, but assuming a State may\ndo that, why does it follow that in defining bodies of\nwater for point source purposes, we may not do that?\nMR. BISHOP: Well, just let me run through, if I\nmay. I mean, first of all, there --\nQUESTION: No, but answer my question before you\nrun through because I -- I tend to lose the answers in the\n-- in the run-throughs.\nYou're -- you're saying, look, when we're\ntalking about water quality standards, there are\ndistinctions made within a given body of water or within\nnavigable water. And I think you're saying that for a\npoint source emission issues, we don't make that kind of\ndistinction. My question was, if the distinction can be\nmade and in fact is made, with respect to water quality\nstandards, why should it follow that the same distinction\ncannot be made for purposes of definition in point source\nproblems?\nMR. BISHOP:\nthis is a cooperative federalism statute where the Federal\nGovernment and the State government has their role --\nQUESTION: As I understood you --\nMR. BISHOP: -- and in the plain language --\nQUESTION: -- you didn't say it cannot be made.\nYou said it has not been made --\nMR. BISHOP: Well, it hasn't --\nQUESTION: -- in the statute.\nMR. BISHOP: It has been made in the statute.\nQUESTION: It has not been made and you're\nsaying it would be illegitimate to make it as a matter of\ninterpretation. And my question is, why would it be\nillegitimate as a matter of interpretation?\nMR. BISHOP: Well, that's my run-through. The\nplain language of the statute is navigable waters defined\nas the waters of the United States. That is backed up by\nthe use of the broad term discharge in section 401(a)\nwhere Congress meant to reach much more and which isn't\nlimited by this language of an addition to the navigable\nwaters.\nIt is backed up by 304(f)(2)(F) where Congress\ndescribed as non-point source pollution pollution\nresulting from the changes in the flow and circulation of\nnavigable waters or ground waters caused by flow diversion\ndevices like the pump.\nAnd it's backed up by the fact that neither\nCongress nor EPA has ever at any time since 1972 suggested\nthat these sorts of movements of water should be governed\nby section 402.\nIf I may reserve the balance of my time.\nQUESTION: Then what did -- what did the tribe\nmean when it said that there are, I think -- major\ncomponents of the Everglades construction project are\nalready under NPDES programs?\nMR. BISHOP: Those are the STA's. The\nregulation 122.2, the definitional regulation, defines\ntreatment areas as not being navigable waters. So when\nyou move water from a treatment area to a navigable water,\nthat requires 402 permitting.\nIf I may reserve the balance of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Bishop.\nMr. Minear, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nQUESTION: Mr. Minear, before you start, if I\nmay just -- could you tell me if you think the record\nexplains where the water in the eastern -- east of the\nC-11 basin originates?\nMR. MINEAR: I'm not sure the record is clear on\nthis, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Because the part that Mr. Bishop\nbrought my attention to does not answer the question.\nMR. MINEAR: I'm -- I cannot give you assurance.\nQUESTION: You don't -- you don't know the\nanswer.\nMR. MINEAR: I do not know the answer to that,\nYour Honor.\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nThe United States submits that the Clean Water\nAct does not require the South Florida Water Management\nDistrict to obtain a section 402 permit for the operation\nof water control facilities like the S-9 pump which simply\nmove water from one location to another. We believe that\nposition is correct on the basis of both the text of the\nstatute, the overarching purposes of the statute and its\nstructure, and also EPA's actual practices.\nI'd like to turn first to the text of the\nstatute. Section 402 states that a NPDES permit is\nrequired when there is an addition of a pollutant to\nnavigable waters from a point source, and section 5027\ngoes on to state that a -- the waters -- the navigable\nwaters are the waters of the United States.\nUnder that definition and those statutory\nprovisions, when an industrial out-fall introduces\npollutants for the first time into the waters of the\nUnited States, an NPDES permit is required. However, when\na water control facility like the S-9 pump simply moves\nwater from one place to another, together with any\npollutants that might be contained therein, that\nregulatory regime is not called into play.\nQUESTION: But if in fact an industrialist adds\nquite -- something quite filthy out of a pipe into a clean\nbody of water, there is no addition if, at the same time,\nin some other body of water, he's taking out an equivalent\namount.\nMR. MINEAR: I think that the -- the text\nprecludes that understanding because it states any\naddition of any pollutant. And we think the use -- these\ndefinitions are written quite carefully, and we think that\nthose -- the term any --\nQUESTION: So a single body of water is --\nMR. MINEAR: -- indicates you can't rule it out.\nQUESTION: A single body of water, which seems\nto have been a concept that the EPA has used for years and\nyears -- that's irrelevant.\nMR. MINEAR: That is -- that's not the case that\nEPA has used a single body of water.\nQUESTION: They haven't. They've never said --\nMR. MINEAR: No. I think that in fact the --\nthe approach that EPA has taken in this is -- can be seen\nfrom a number of sources. First of all, EPA has never\nattempted to regulate water control facilities like the\nS-9 pump in the 30 years that the NPDES program has been\nin place. And what's more, in cases, the closely\nanalogous cases, of dams where water is simply being\npassed through a dam, EPA has taken the position that an\nNPDES permit is not required.\nPart of the reason for this is there are other\nregulatory programs that deal with these problems.\nJustice Breyer mentioned the problem of taking a polluted\nriver and combining it with a pristine river. That\nactually implicates a number of different programs. First\nof all, in the case of the polluted river, that river is\nsubject to 402 requirements, and so there will be steps\ntaken to prevent the discharge of pollutants into the\npolluted river.\nThe States also are required, or at least\nstrongly urged by the Government and with strong carrot\nand stick type incentives, to adopt non-point source\npollution programs to reduce any non-point pollution that\nmight be going into that polluted river.\nIf there's an attempt to connect that river to\nanother river, it does implicate, as Mr. Bishop indicated,\nthe section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act which deals\nwith regulations that result in the change in the flow\nof --\nQUESTION: What about -- C-11 doesn't come\nwithin that because it's not polluted enough?\nMR. MINEAR: C-11, when it was first constructed\nat that -- at the time that the C-11 canal was built back\nin the 1950's, most likely -- well, it was in fact\nconstructed by the Corps of Engineers. So it was subject\nto the public interest review provisions that the Rivers\nand Harbors Act envisions. When the -- the Corps\ninvestigates private connections of this type, it conducts\nwhat's called a public interest review, and this is\ndescribed in your case, United States v. Alaska at 503\nU.S. 569.\nQUESTION: What about the other half of what I\nsaid, that I'm thinking if you were to be wrong on that,\nif I thought you were wrong on what you've said --\nassumption -- then it's not so bad for you because EPA can\nhandle what I call the California central river valley\nproject by the Costle -- you know what I'm thinking of.\nLeventhal's opinion in Costle. Does that ring a bell?\nNRDC v. Costle. Does that ring a bell to you?\nMR. MINEAR: I'm afraid I'm not familiar with\nthat. That's --\nQUESTION:\nlists -- he lists a set of things that EPA could do under\nthe permit requirement that would, in fact, alleviate the\nadministrative burden and would make sure that all these\npipes and things in California don't really have an\nadministrative problem or other problem by having to go to\nEPA to get the permit.\nMR. MINEAR: EPA has substantial discretion to\nminimize the types of regulatory burdens that might be\nimposed here. Nevertheless, they're likely to be\nsubstantial. And what they amount to in this case is\nreally a belt and suspenders approach, and you know, the\nadditional haberdashery is fine except for the cost that\nit does entail. In this case it could be very substantial\nfor projects throughout the Nation.\nQUESTION: Don't you think there would be\nanother lawsuit quite promptly if -- if EPA simply said\nyou automatically get a permit for this type of operation?\nMR. MINEAR: I think that's correct. And in\naddition, I think we have to consider what would a permit\naccomplish in this case that the CERP project that the\nCorps of Engineers has -- is implementing is not already\ndoing. That project is designed to deal with these\nproblems.\nThe permitting program is really designed to\ndeal with the specific problem of introducing pollutants\ninto waterways for the first time. It's really not\ncapable of dealing with this problem of water transfers\nthat move from one place to another. Rather, there are\nother programs that deal with this. If it's a Federal\nprogram, it would be subject to NEPA, for instance, and\nthere would be an environmental analysis before any action\nwas taken.\nIn the case of the Rivers and Harbors Act that I\ndescribed before, that would also implicate section 401 of\nthe Clean Water Act, which requires a water quality\ncertification, a determination from the State that in fact\nwaters would be -- would not violate water quality\nstandards.\nI'd like to make the point also that our\nposition is not an extreme one in saying that the -- the\ntext requires that we only look at the pollution when it\nfirst enters the water. Rather, it's a -- it's a approach\nthat recognizes that cleaning up polluted water requires a\nnumber of different control strategies. The NPDES\npermitting program is only one.\nQUESTION: Well, what do we make of information\nsuch as that provided by the State of Pennsylvania,\ntalking about the application of the permit system to\ninterbasin transfers in that State and saying how\nbeneficial it has been?\nMR. MINEAR: Well, the State of -- the\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania can, of course, adopt that\ntype of program on its own under its State law to deal\nwith those types of programs. Any State can.\nQUESTION: It tells us that it's been getting\npermits under this Federal scheme and that it's been\nhelpful.\nMR. MINEAR: That might very well be, and it is\nallowed to supplement the Federal scheme with its own\nState additions. But other States, such as California,\nhave found --\nQUESTION: I don't understand that. You\nconceded that in Pennsylvania EPA permits are obtained?\nMR. MINEAR: No. These -- the -- EPA has\ndelegated authority to implement the permitting program to\na number of States, including Pennsylvania. So\nPennsylvania is issuing the 402 permits in lieu of the\nFederal Government. My point is --\nQUESTION: It's done the same thing in Florida.\nEPA has delegated to the State agency, hasn't it?\nMR. MINEAR: That's true. In fact, it has in\nmost States. So in fact, in most States the States are\nissuing these permits with substantial guidance from the\nFederal Government. The Federal Government is setting the\nfloor for what the permit requirements are, but the States\nare free to supplement their permitting programs with\nadditional State requirements and many do so. Many States\nlike California actually operate with additional programs\napart from the Clean Water Act. I think that Judge\nKennedy when he was -- or Justice Kennedy -- excuse me --\nwhen he was a judge on the Ninth Circuit, wrote an opinion\nconcerning the New Malones project where he talked about\nthe imposition of water quality standards at -- at the\nState level on Federal projects and indicated that the\nStates, in fact, do have that authority as well.\nMy -- my point here is that there are a number\nof different mechanisms here in which these problems can\nbe addressed, and the important point is to choose the\nright one. In this context, the NPDES permitting program\nis not the correct mechanism for dealing with the problems\nthat the Florida Everglades faces. Instead, that problem\nis being addressed comprehensively through Federal and\nState programs.\nQUESTION: Is that the view that EPA takes?\nMR. MINEAR: Yes, that is the view. The brief\nof the United States here is it reflects a consensus of a\nnumber of agencies, not only EPA but the Department of the\nInterior, the Corps of Engineers, and the Department of\nArmy.\nAnd I'd like to mention there's been some\nsuggestion that this Court should draw inferences from the\nnames that are on the cover of the brief, and those\ninferences should not be drawn. The names on the brief\nhave no relationship to whether or not -- the absence of\nthe names of an agency does not indicate the brief does --\ndoes not represent the views of a particular agency. That\ncan be seen in a number of briefs, including the Swank\nbrief from two terms ago in which Administrator Browner\nwas a party in that case, a party to the proceeding, and\nyet there are no EPA counsel names on the brief.\nQUESTION: But I notice that there's a brief\nfiled by former administrators and general counsel which\nsays that the position of the EPA back in '75 was that of\nyour opponent.\nMR. MINEAR: They're relying on a 1975 general\ncounsel opinion that addressed the question of irrigation\nreturn flows. Congress repudiated the position that was\ntaken there 2 years later in the 1977 amendments. It\nmentions this point only tangentially. It's not even\namong the 17 questions presented that are listed in that\nopinion.\nAnd I think what's more telling is the practice\nof EPA since that time. EPA has not required permits from\nwater control facilities to do no more than move water.\nQUESTION: Can I make one thing clear? You do\nnot endorse the position of the petitioner that it has to\nbe the point source itself that -- that causes the\npollution.\nMR. MINEAR: That is correct. We do not endorse\nthat addition.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Minear.\nMr. Lehtinen, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DEXTER W. LEHTINEN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. LEHTINEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Miccosukee Tribe and Friends of the\nEverglades contend that a pollutant is added to navigable\nwaters whenever it's put into navigable waters where it\nwould not otherwise be, whenever it's put somewhere where\nit's not already there or would not naturally flow.\nThe receiving navigable water body is the point\nof focus under the Clean Water Act because the act\nspecifically provides for designating different water\nbodies with specific designated uses and with associated\nwater quality standards that will protect those uses. And\nthe associated permitting system of the act 402 rests on\nthe assumption that the proprietary of the -\nproprietariness of the proposed addition of a pollutant\nwill be measured against the receiving navigable water\nbody's designated use and against the receiving navigable\nwater body's water quality standards.\nQUESTION: What -- what says that? I mean, the\n-- the text we're dealing with here talks about adding\npollutants to the navigable waters of the United States if\nyou read the two definitions together. And as I see\nwhat's happened here, no pollutants have been added to the\nnavigable waters of the United States. The total amount\nof pollutants is the same.\nMR. LEHTINEN: Yes. Justice Scalia, it says any\naddition of any pollutant to -- to navigable waters. The\nreason navigable waters need not have and would be\nconfusing to have any adjective is because the location of\nthe point source inherently dictates the receiving\nnavigable water.\nQUESTION: You -- it could -- it could say to a\nparticular navigable water. It could have said that very\neasily. It doesn't -- it doesn't say that. It says to\nnavigable waters.\nMR. LEHTINEN: It could, Your Honor, but since\nthe permitting system is from a point source, it would not\nmake sense to say to any other navigable water that the\npoint source is not discharging to. The point source\nitself makes the location of the navigable waters\nspecified by the fact that the point source can only\ndischarge --\nQUESTION: No, it doesn't. It doesn't -- it\ndoesn't do what you say the provision does, that -- that\nis, to make it unlawful without a permit to add to a\nparticular navigable water a pollutant that is not already\nthere but that is elsewhere in the navigable waters. As\nit's written, all it says is you shall not add pollutants\nto the navigable waters of the United States. That's how\nthose definitions work out. And that has not happened\nhere.\nMR. LEHTINEN: Yes, Justice Scalia, but if that\nwere the meaning of that text and the lack of an\nadjective, any navigable waters were to mean that once in\nnavigable waters, that pollutant could be spread to any\nnavigable water with any different designated use or any\ndifferent water quality --\nQUESTION: As far as this provision is\nconcerned.\nMR. LEHTINEN: That's correct, Your Honor. And\nthis provision has been recognized as being the main\nmethod by which the Clean Water Act cleans up water.\nThe -- the problem of the polluted river or\ndirty river is one problem with the interpretation that\nthere's a singular navigable waters.\nspecific example is the Dubois case, in which the\nPemigewassett River was, in fact, so bad that the First\nCircuit said it peeled paint off of the adjoining\nbuildings on the bank. That river, under this\ninterpretation, would have been put into Loon Pond\nstrictly for the purpose of resupplying Loon Pond. It\ndidn't always go through snow-making equipment. The First\nCircuit made it clear that sometimes it is directly from\nthe east branch to Loon Pond.\nFurthermore, it would make it impossible to\nactually administer the permitting system because a permit\nwriter is told to evaluate the propriety of the proposed\naddition of a pollutant based on the designated use and\nthe water quality standards of the receiving navigable\nwater. It wouldn't be effective if thereafter that permit\nwere deemed, as a matter of law, to have authorized the\naddition of that pollutant throughout the entire United\nStates to any navigable water no matter what its\ndesignated use and no matter what its water quality\nstandard.\nQUESTION: Is it just the First Circuit case or\nis there any history in the EPA over the years, I guess 30\nyears, where they did make clear that the navigable waters\nof the United States -- the discharge is not just like one\nbig water where the Sacramento River and Hudson are part\nof the same big water?\nMR. LEHTINEN: Yes, the United States, Justice\nBreyer, on many occasions -- starting in 1975 EPA general\ncounsel issued the opinion that surface water runoff and\nreturn flows from irrigation, even when in navigable\nwaters, that is to say an agricultural canal, when then\ndischarged to other navigable waters, would require a\npermit. Congress did not repudiate that because what --\nCongress, if it had repudiated it, would have said that\nwas not an addition. In fact, Congress --\nQUESTION: Return flow from -- from irrigation\nseems to me quite different. I mean, that is taking\nsomething out of the navigable waters, adding something to\nit, and then returning it to the navigable waters. It's\n-- it's the fertilizer and -- and other pollutants that\nare picked up in the irrigation process that -- that is\nthe problem.\nMR. LEHTINEN: But the question --\nQUESTION: That's quite different from just\ntransferring from one navigable water to another.\nMR. LEHTINEN: Well, those elements of it are,\nJustice Scalia, but what the EPA opinion --\nQUESTION: But why are they different? They go\nalong and the water is pure and it sort of picks up some\ndrainage from Tallahassee or someplace, and now it's not\nquite the same, and by the time they get it next to the\nbig lake there, it's filled with stuff, just like the --\njust like the stuff that drains off the land.\nMR. LEHTINEN: Well, it is not different when it\ngets into the canal. The C-11 canal, which is a drainage\ncanal that receives surface water runoff, like an -- a\nagricultural canal that receives irrigation return flow,\nis itself a jurisdictional navigable waters under this\nCourt's decisions in Riverside Bayview simply because it's\nconnected to, in this case, the Atlantic. In other words,\nit's not navigable in fact itself.\nQUESTION: Well, apart from the -- what --\n1972 --\nMR. LEHTINEN: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- general counsel opinion, which --\nwhich applied to -- to return from -- from cultivated\nland, do you -- do you deny that -- that the EPA has never\nsought to require permitting of this kind of a facility\nfor 30 years? Is -- is that inaccurate?\nMR. LEHTINEN: Yes. Well, it is inaccurate in\nthe sense that in 1993 EPA told the South Florida Water\nManagement District, to its chagrin, that it would have to\nhave NPDES permits for all of these Everglades\nconstruction project features that were motivated by the\nUnited States v. South Florida Water --\nQUESTION: So that States have been violating\nthe Federal law for 30 years and nobody knew about it?\nMR. LEHTINEN: I'm sorry, Your Honor?\nQUESTION: The States have been violating the\nFederal law for 30 years.\nMR. LEHTINEN: Well, in most cases --\nQUESTION: That's kind of an extraordinary\ninterpretation.\nMR. LEHTINEN: In most cases, Your Honor, the\nsimple movement of water does not end up, even under\nMiccosukee -- this case, requiring a permit. Most of them\nare -- are not covered. They return to the same water\nbody. The dam cases make it clear that that's a return to\nthe same water body. If they're --\nQUESTION: You don't -- you think the dam cases\nare correctly decided and you don't need to distinguish\nthem?\nMR. LEHTINEN: We distinguish them, Your Honor,\nbecause the dam cases dealt with the condition -- the D.C.\nCircuit made it clear in the Gorsuch case in '82 that dam-\ninduced changes in condition such as super-saturation and\nso forth, and that that was not a pollutant. They didn't\nsay dams weren't point sources. They said that was not a\npollutant.\nQUESTION:\ndifference to you. I thought neither side thought that\nthe answer to this case depended upon whether it was the\nsame water body or not. If -- do you think that if it --\nif -- if it is established that -- that this is the same\nwater body, these pumps would be okay without permitting.\nMR. LEHTINEN: No, Your Honor, because --\nQUESTION: I thought so. Neither side takes\nthat position.\nMR. LEHTINEN: Neither side takes the position,\nbut it is true that the phrase, water body, because it's\nused in so much of the EPA regulations, is a shorthand for\nsaying that the pollutant is added to a navigable water\nthat wouldn't otherwise receive it. The fact is that as\nthe First Circuit said, the argument about whether Loon\nPond, well up here -- uphill from the Pemigewassett River,\neast branch, was hydrologically connected or not was\nirrelevant because Loon Pond would never receive water\nfrom the Pemigewassett River, even though that Loon Pond\neventually flowed through the watershed to the river.\nQUESTION: The dam --\nQUESTION: May I ask you a question about --\nQUESTION: -- our problem, aren't they, that --\nthat the -- for you. That is that it seems to me that\nunder your definition, it's going to be the same body of\nwater.\npollutant that wouldn't have been there otherwise, I bet\nthat with most dams that isn't so, I mean, because there's\na lot of mud stirred up in that lake behind the, say,\nBoulder, Hoover Dam and so forth. A big problem.\nAnd if we think of California and the central\nvalley water project, my goodness, you're not going to say\nthat's all one body of water. You have the Sacramento,\nSan Joaquin, Los Angeles. You know, it goes all over the\nplace.\nAnd so that's their big problem. They are\nsaying if you -- if you don't take a strong reading of the\ndam cases, one that hurts you, we're suddenly going to\nfind ourselves with -- with water valley projects all over\nthe United States and 15 million permits required, and it\njust won't work.\nAll right. So what's your response to that?\nMR. LEHTINEN: Well, Your Honor, first with\nrespect to the same body of water, if you were referring\nto the Everglades, this is a -- C-11 is a canal that has\ngas stations, urban shopping malls, industrial parks\naround it. And the canal itself was dug out. It's not as\nthough 99.99 percent of the Everglades were removed. So\nthat canal has been dug deeper. The Everglades' ecosystem\nremoved. It's distinctly different.\nQUESTION:\nbody of water requirement there. But what about the other\npart of what they say?\nMR. LEHTINEN: Well, with respect to these\nlarger water projects, Your Honor, first of all, if\nthey're withdrawing water, they're not going to come under\nour condition, withdrawing and then being used for a\nconsumptive use and so forth. That's already dealt with a\ndifferent way. If they're returning the water through\nirrigation return flow, that's already exempt.\nOtherwise, if they're -- the State does\ndesignate the use and does designate the water quality\nstandards. So these large movements through canals and\nwater projects -- the State controls the designation of\nthose uses.\nAnd even if they were found to be a movement\nfrom one navigable water to another, they're likely to\nqualify for a general permit. As Colorado said on page 3\nof its brief, none of their movements of water, through\nany structures in Colorado, interbasin transfers, result\nin a water quality standard violation. Accordingly,\nColorado solves any problem it has with one general\npermit.\nAs well, most of these big movements of water\nmove water that doesn't distinctly, as in this case, move\nwater that's four times higher in a certain content than\nthe receiving water body's water quality standard. The\nState law for the Everglades and only the Everglades\nprotection area, not the C-11 canal, is now 10 parts per\nbillion. That actual number was changed and became\neffective January 1 of 2004, but it had a separate\ndesignation and water quality standard throughout all of\nthe time of this case.\nQUESTION: May I ask you two questions that I --\nI think you may have answered, but I'm just not sure? Do\nyou -- in your view is water conservation area 3 and the\nC-11 basin the same body of water, or are they different\nbodies? That's my first question.\nMy second question is in your view does the\nrecord tell us where the water from the C-11 basin\nprimarily comes from?\nMR. LEHTINEN: Yes, Justice Stevens. With\nrespect to the first, they're distinctly different bodies\nof water. The C-11 canal is a canal that has been dug\nartificially deep, surrounded by gas stations, shopping\nmalls.\nQUESTION: I understand that.\nMR. LEHTINEN: And it does not have the ecology\nof the Everglades. Nobody stands at a gas station and\nsays to their child, there, John, is the Everglades. It\n-- it has -- and it doesn't have Everglades water because\nEverglades water would naturally flow west to east, and\nthey have blocked that flow from the Everglades into the\nsloughs and into the Atlantic Ocean.\nQUESTION: Then what about the second question?\nMR. LEHTINEN: With respect to the second, the\nrecord shows the trial court found that substantial\nsurface water runoff goes into the C-11, and --\nQUESTION: That's right, but why does the --\nwhat is the source of the runoff?\nMR. LEHTINEN: Well, the source of the runoff is\nsometimes rainfall.\nQUESTION: I understand.\nMR. LEHTINEN: And it is sometimes from the\naquifer --\nQUESTION: But surely it didn't get all their\nwater from -- from rain.\nMR. LEHTINEN: And it is sometimes from the\naquifer below the C-11 because the C-11 basin, as opposed\nto the canal -- the C-11 basin is a -- has been drained\nand substantial fill put in for the gas --\nQUESTION: But that -- that thing in the -- the\nwater in the aquifer in turn comes largely from the\nEverglades, does it not?\nMR. LEHTINEN: Your Honor --\nQUESTION:\nthe Everglades and then seeps through to the other side of\nthe levee. I thought it was -- I thought it was\nacknowledged on both sides that there's -- that there's\ntransfer of water from the west to the east below the\nlevee.\nMR. LEHTINEN: Yes, Your Honor, from west to\neast, but not east to west, and when the water transfers\nthrough the --\nQUESTION: Well, but that doesn't -- that\ndoesn't go to the point of whether it's the same body of\nwater or not. I mean, whether it flows east to west or\nwest to east, the point is it's -- it's the same water.\nMR. LEHTINEN: Well, Your Honor, the fact that\nwaters will flow from the -- in that case, there would be\nperhaps three bodies of water in the United States: east\nof the Appalachian Divide, west of it, and -- and then\nseparated by the Continental Divide in the west. The fact\nthat one water will flow eventually into the other doesn't\nmake them the same water body. That is to say, Loon Pond,\nwhich was a substantially different ecology and water\nquality standard and different classification by the\nState, flowing eventually into the polluted Pemigewassett\nRiver much further downstream, did not make them the same\nwater body.\nQUESTION:\ncount then in this question.\nMR. LEHTINEN: That's correct. In this case\nsubsurface flow -- that water is substantially changed in\nthe aquifer. By the time it's underneath the C-11, it\ndoesn't have the biological or ecosystem characteristics\nof the water that is in the Everglades protection area.\nIt's been substantially changed by the -- by the aquifer.\nQUESTION: But you say this doesn't matter\nanyway. You wouldn't care if it was the same water body.\nThat isn't -- that isn't what you're arguing.\nMR. LEHTINEN: We do argue that it is the same\nwater body and you pump it substantially upstream. You\nwould also need a permit.\nQUESTION: Right, right.\nMR. LEHTINEN: The downstream Pemigewassett\nRiver --\nQUESTION: If -- if -- do you know any place we\ncould look for a definition of what is the same water\nbody? Is -- is there some -- some -- can I -- you know,\nI'm not sure.\nMR. LEHTINEN: Well, there is a -- there is a --\nQUESTION: We could try Genesis --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: -- or then the second --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. LEHTINEN: There is -- there is EPA\nguidance, but the fact that 303 of the act itself mandates\nthat States designate different water bodies and the\nphrase, water bodies, used in the EPA specification of\nwhat water quality standards is means that, as a matter of\nfact, it's done all of the time. And in the State of\nFlorida, the State legislature has designated the\nEverglades protection area quite distinct from the canal,\na different water quality standard and a -- and a\ndifferent use for that water. And as a hydrological\nmatter, they are -- they are able to -- to deal with that.\nThey've given them different water body numbers in the\nState of Florida. The C-11 canal is a different water\nbody number from the Everglades -- various parts of the\nEverglades protection area and -- and so forth.\nThe --\nQUESTION: Could you explain what's at stake\nhere practically? We're told that there are other means\nto deal with this phosphorus problem. If the permit you\nenvision were required, what would that permit demand?\nMR. LEHTINEN: This permit would most likely\nrequire simply that the plan that the district already has\n-- has on the books and which they mentioned in their\nbrief would be implemented within a reasonable period of\ntime and under a reasonable compliance schedule.\nThe Everglades restoration project was first\nmotivated, as -- as is admitted in all briefs, by\nlitigation against the district for discharging phosphorus\nthat caused an imbalance of natural populations of flora\nand fauna, and furthermore, all of the congressional acts\nthat deal with the Everglades restoration projects --\nthat's -- and they're referred to in our brief called\nWRDA, Water Resources Development Act '96 and Water\nResources Development Act 2000 -- both refer to the\npending litigation and make the statement that they don't\nintend to interfere with pending litigation. And WRDA\n2000 specifically says that nothing in these Everglades\nrestoration -- this section shall be deemed to eliminate\nany permitting requirements under law.\nQUESTION: What is -- what is then the -- the\nreason for this litigation? I mean, you -- you say you're\njust trying to get them to do what they have already said\nthey are doing.\nMR. LEHTINEN: Yes.\nQUESTION: You don't believe that they're doing\nit.\nMR. LEHTINEN: Well, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: And you don't believe they're going\nto do it, you know, in the foreseeable future.\nMR. LEHTINEN:\nCongress did, that the Clean Water Act -- that the\nprograms in place were not always implemented and that the\nClean Water Act was necessary as a backstop to stop the\nbacksliding. The Federal Government's litigation in 1988\nrequired the State to do no more than the State in press\nreleases was saying that it was doing and intended to do,\nbut the litigation, reinforced by Congress that\nspecifically said we don't intend to interfere with any of\nthat litigation, indicates why Federal enforcement is a --\nis a useful and necessary tool to ensure that States under\ndifferent pressures don't backslide.\nOur brief appendix indicates that 2 years ago\nthey indicated they would meet water quality standards in\nthe S-9 by 2005, and then with the pendency of this\nlitigation, they have eliminated any commitment to reach\nit by 2005, hoping that this litigation will first relieve\nthem of the oversight of the NPDES on S-9 and then they\nwill use this litigation to eliminate the NPDES's that\nwere required from 1993 forward on the other projects.\nThe only thing that keeps those -- those other discharge\nstructures under the restoration project from not being\nextended or otherwise modified by the State are the EPA-\nplaced NPDES permits that already exist on all of those\nEverglades restoration projects. We simply want the same\npermitting backstop on the S-9 structure.\nWith respect to the question of singular waters,\nthe singular waters approach of the United States\neliminates the different designated uses and the ability\nto actually determine the effects of a permit. The\nMinnesota amici brief is very useful in this sense because\nit points out that St. Paul now, like the Commonwealth of\nPennsylvania and others, does get an NPDES to remove water\nfrom the Mississippi to its lake and water reservoir.\nHowever, if the Solicitor General's position were correct,\nSt. Paul would no longer need that NPDES permit, and St.\nCloud, substantially up-river on the Mississippi, would --\nwould be under a -- a review for does its discharges to\nthe Mississippi, which have been found to meet the NPDES\nrequirements, not changing the designated use or violating\nthe Mississippi's water quality standard -- it -- its\ndischarges should be deemed to be somehow removable\nartificially downstream in the Mississippi so that\nanyplace anyone at any time might construct the pipe and\nmove them into a more pristine water body, you, St. Cloud\nnow have to anticipate that and will be put under that --\nthat mandate.\nSo the inability of a permit writer to construct\na 402 permit because he doesn't know that the evaluation\nis now to the receiving navigable water, but instead I\nhave to evaluate where anyone with a pipe might move it,\nhundreds and hundreds of miles, without an NPDES permit,\nthat permit writer essentially has to permit only for the\nhighest designated use and the highest water quality\nstandard anywhere in the United States, notwithstanding\nthat where the discharge -- point source is discharging to\nis a particular designated use. That would make the act\neither impossible to administer or place burdens on the\ngovernments that the petitioner says should not be placed\non the governments. Instead of placing it on the\ngovernment that for some purpose, some economic purpose,\nis able to -- to determine the costs and to -- and to\nclean the water or at least subject itself to review, when\nit takes it from a navigable water into a pristine\nnavigable water, you place the burden instead on anyone\nelse who might discharge so -- and -- and whose -- whose\ndischarge, might, if removed anywhere downstream by anyone\nfor any reason, might end up causing a violation of a\nwater quality standard.\nQUESTION: Look -- look, when -- when the States\nrequire permitting, as -- as they're allowed to do, they\ncan presumably limit the permitting to just the -- the\nkind of difficult situations you're talking about, when it\nis into a pristine body of water from a more polluted body\nof water. But if we agree with you on the meaning of the\nact, permitting will be mandatory not just when -- when\nthere are differences between the pollution levels of the\ntwo bodies of water, but whenever there is a transfer from\none body of water to another. Even when the two bodies of\nwater are equally polluted, you would need a permit\nbecause you are adding -- you are adding pollutants.\nMR. LEHTINEN: Well, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: Now, it may well be you're adding\npollutants to a body of water that already contains it,\nbut you will need a -- a permit in every case whenever any\nState tries to do flood control projects or any project\nthat requires the transfer of water from one body to\nanother.\nMR. LEHTINEN: Well, in the so-called worst\ncase, Justice Scalia, they'd be qualifying because they\ndon't have a -- they're not impairing either water body --\nqualifying for one general permit issued in the State.\nBut under other circumstances --\nQUESTION: Excuse me. Can you do that? Can --\nI mean, can EPA issue a general permit, say anybody\nthat --\nMR. LEHTINEN: Yes, Your Honor. General permits\nare authorized and they are often written to say under the\nfollowing conditions, you qualify for the general permit,\nand -- and --\nQUESTION: You don't have to get it. You just\n-- just --\nMR. LEHTINEN: That's correct, Your Honor. You\ndon't have to get it.\nQUESTION: You just go ahead.\nMR. LEHTINEN: The general permit might or might\nnot say to do certain monitoring to make sure that you\nstay within the conditions of the general permit. Those\ngeneral permits are very common, and even individual\npermits are usually system-wide permits. You have 80\nstructures --\nQUESTION: You say a general permit. You mean\nthat applies to a number of different people?\nMR. LEHTINEN: Yes, Your Honor. A general\npermit can be statewide. The permit looks almost like a\nrule, but the permit says -- and in the case of the Corps,\nthey do nationwide permits, but 404 is not at issue here.\nThe general permit statewide could say that under the\nfollowing circumstances, when you are an unimpaired water\nbody discharging to an unimpaired water body or\ndischarging at levels that have pollutants but don't\nimpair the receiving water body, you automatically qualify\nfor this permit. Do some monitoring. Let us know every\nyear. That general permit is -- is frequently used and --\nand is very close to rulemaking.\nBut it's also possible, under those\ncircumstances -- and this is not our case. Our case\ndischarges at almost four times the water quality\nstandard, 10 parts per billion, for the receiving water\nbody. It clearly impairs the receiving water body. But\nif the standard for a water body were 20 of a substance,\nits actual receiving level was 10 and you discharged at 5,\nnot to get too complex, but you're discharging at a lower\nlevel than the receiving water body and the water bodies\nare not impaired, it's possible mathematically, but not\nour case here -- these hypotheticals should be left to\nanother time. It's possible that the 1 gallon in the\nreceiving water body that had 10, with 1 gallon added to\nit that had 5, the 2 gallons now have 15, or in fact,\n7-and-a-half per receiving unit. That may be determined\nby rule or other appropriate analysis in the western\ncases, if they ever come up, to not be an addition. But\nthat's not our case here.\nThe Court, in an abundance of caution, could\npoint out that our case here is an artificial canal that\nreceives substantial surface water runoff, itself probably\na conveyance under the Clean Water Act definition of\nchannels or discrete conveyances, that it discharges at\nlevels up to four times the receiving water body's water\nquality standard, that it is itself an impaired water\nbody.\nto western States or elsewhere is -- are not being\naddressed by the Court.\nNow -- now, the -- the amici from the Tongue and\nYellowstone River Irrigation District point out actually\nthat in the west, they believe that ranchers and farmers\nwill suffer from the Federal Government's unitary water\ntheory because they will now be subject to water that is\nnot of sufficient quality for their irrigation district\nand so forth.\nIt's not simply a west -- and the State of\nWashington also joined in our brief. We, of course -- we\ndon't count States, but more States support the tribe in\ntheir briefs saying this is essential than do support the\n-- the district and the United States.\nThe -- it's particularly important to recognize\nthe C-11 was itself dug, is not a residual part of the\nEverglades, and that it's -- the C-11 basin is not simply\na -- a water body divided from the WCA or the Everglades\nprotection area by a levee. Looking at pages 6a and 7a of\nour brief, which are the appendix to our brief, are from\nthe district's own web site, which it cited in its brief,\nand it shows the urban construction right to the boundary.\nSo it's not that the C-11 basin is water just divided.\nIt's an artificial canal. It's no -- no more part of the\nEverglades protection area than Fenway Park in Boston is\npart of the Charles River because it's built on the\nlandfill where the Charles River once was. They're quite\ndistinct.\nWith respect to federalism issues, the Clean\nWater Act itself is a federalism instrument because it\nprovides for the States to do the designation of uses. It\nprovides for the States to -- to create the water quality\nstandards, and it does protect the ability of the States\nto allocate quantities of water, but this is not a\nquantity allocation.\nThe record shows clearly that the S-9 pump is\nturned on when you get to 1 foot of -- turned off when --\nwhen the C-11 basin is at 1 foot and turned on when it's\nat 4 foot. It is strictly a drainage mechanism to take\nsurface water runoff and other water out of the C-11.\nThey're disposing of water. They don't want the water.\nThey're dumping the water wherever they can put it.\nAnd actually the water is not our concern. It\nis the pollutants. Whenever they say merely conveying\nwater, we would say conveyance is defined as a point\nsource and they convey pollutants. If they didn't convey\nthis massive amount of pollutants, we would not be before\nYour Honors.\nThe district, by pumping pollutants contained in\nthe water against the natural flow of that water into the\nspecially designated Everglades protection area, added\nthat water to the Everglades protection area within the\nplain meaning of -- of the Clean Water Act and within the\ncommon usage of -- of language. The district put those\npollutants in the Everglades and nobody but the district\nput those pollutants in the Everglades.\nAn effort to reconstruct the term, addition to\nnavigable waters, to allow them to dispose of those\npollutants anywhere in the United States with a navigable\nwater of any designated use or of any water quality\nstandard would decimate the Clean Water Act's protection\nnot only of the Everglades, but of the case law that --\nthat Your Honors have had cited in the brief.\nNow, the circuit court cases are not\nparticularly precedent for your Court, but it does point\nout that Loon Pond would have had water that peeled paint\noff of the adjoining buildings put into it and not just\nthrough snow-making devices. The -- the court clearly\nindicated that sometimes the Pemigewassett water was put\ndirectly to Loon Pond to -- to increase the amount of\nwater in Loon Pond.\nNow, the -- the United States would try to save\nits singular water theory in some cases by saying, well,\nwater might be removed. They said on the Dubois case, the\nFirst Circuit Loon Pond, that it was removed for snow-\nmaking, but I point out that the court said in several\nplaces that it also went directly, never through snow-\nmaking devices.\nThey would say that when you put it through\ntunnels or so forth, perhaps it loses its navigable water\ncharacter. The State of New York, of course, is strongly\nin favor of the tribe because the 18-mile Shandaken Tunnel\nto them needs --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nLehtinen.\nMr. Bishop, you have only 10 seconds left, so\nwe'll consider the case submitted.\n(Whereupon, at 12:14 p.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n"
