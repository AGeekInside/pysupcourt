        "content": "(10:14 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument first this morning in Case 07-1529, Montejo v.\nLouisiana.\nMr. Verrilli.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe question in this case is whether\nPetitioner Montejo should be denied the Sixth Amendment\nprotections of Michigan v. Jackson because he silently\nacquiesced in the appointment of counsel at his initial\nhearing, rather than affirmatively accepting the\nappointment. The Louisiana Supreme Court believed that\nan affirmative acceptance was required to trigger\nJackson and therefore upheld the admission of a\nconfession elicited during police-initiated\ninterrogation after Montejo's Sixth Amendment right had\nattached and after a lawyer had been appointed to\nrepresent him.\nIf Jackson applies, that confession should\nnot have been admitted, and Jackson should apply because\nnothing in this Court's precedents or, frankly, in\ncommon sense supports a rule that affords less Sixth\nAmendment protection to defendants who are automatically\nappointed counsel at initial hearings than to defendants\nwho are appointed counsel after a request for\ncounsel has --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that the\nrationale of Jackson was that the confession is simply\ndeemed to be coerced if the defendant has expressed --\nhas expressed -- his desire to have counsel present or\neven to be represented by counsel. It isn't clear that,\nwhich is already a stretch, to assume that simply\nbecause I said, you know, I would like to have counsel,\nif the police continue to say, well, come on, won't you\ntalk to us -- it's already a stretch to say it's\nautomatically coerced.\nBut now you're saying, even if the defendant\nhas never expressed even a desire to be represented by\ncounsel but has simply had counsel appointed, in fact\neven if he doesn't know about the appointment of\ncounsel, the -- his confession is automatically deemed\nto be coerced. That seems to me quite, even more\nextravagant than Jackson.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, I don't -- without\ntaking up at the moment the question whether Jackson was\nextravagant, it does seem to me, Your Honor, that your\nquestion does get to the heart of the matter. In a\nsituation like Jackson, the defendant requested counsel\nand that was deemed to be an election of the right to\nrely on counsel, not merely at the initial hearing but\nfor all purposes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right. Right. What has he\nelected here?\nMR. VERRILLI: And the question here, it\nseems to me, Your Honor, is what does one do when a\ndefendant is automatically appointed counsel? There are\ntwo options: One is to treat that defendant as having\nelected the right to rely on counsel, and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why? Why would one do\nthat?\nMR. VERRILLI: And the other option is to\ndeem that the defendant has decided to go it alone.\nThose are the two possibilities here, and it seems to me\nthat --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry to\ninterrupt, but isn't there a third, which is that you\njust don't assume anything and you wait to see if he\nmakes -- says, \"I want to talk to my lawyer,\" or he\ncould well say, \"You've told me,\" as was the case here,\n\"I have a right to a lawyer, I don't have to say\nanything, I want to talk some more, I don't -- okay,\nthere's a lawyer, fine, I want to talk without my\nlawyer, I want to waive my right to counsel.\" Which he\ncan do.\nMR. VERRILLI: I think the problem, Mr.\nChief Justice, is that in the -- it is an either/or\nchoice because, if you -- if the defendant is deemed to\nhave elected to rely on counsel on the basis of the\nappointment, then the police may not initiate\ninterrogation. It's only if the defendant --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. If you\nprevail and you say silence constitutes saying \"I want\nto talk to my lawyer,\" that's right. I'm saying that's\na false, a false alternative.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, I don't think so. I\nthink if the police initiate interrogation after a\nlawyer has been automatically appointed, then that\ninterrogation either has to be deemed to be in violation\nof the rule of Jackson or not, and that seems to me to\ndepend on how you characterize what happens in the\ncourse of an automatic appointment. If you --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Verrilli, the\ndefendant himself could say, \"Police, I'd like to talk\nto you.\" That would be okay. But this is police\ninitiation.\nMR. VERRILLI: That's absolutely the\ncritical point, Justice Ginsburg. This is a limited\nrule, and the free choice of the defendant to initiate a\nconversation with the authorities is always present.\nThe question is, what do we do in an automatic\nappointment situation? And this is a significant\nquestion because -- and I would refer the Court to the\nappendix, to the amicus brief of the National Legal Aid\nand Defender Association, which I think is a helpful\nreference here. It goes through each State, and what it\nshows is that approximately half the States have\nprocedures in which, as a matter of course, the\ndefendant is asked at the hearing whether he or she\nwants counsel, and if the defendant says yes, then we're\nin a Jackson situation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I just want to make sure I\nunderstood your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question.\nAssume a lawyer is appointed. The defendant says, \"Yes,\nI want my lawyer.\" He's in the jail cell. The\npoliceman walks by, he says, \"I have a lawyer, but I\nwant to talk to you now.\" Can the police talk to him?\nMR. VERRILLI: Yes, if he initiates.\nInitiation is the key. Initiation --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. Well, then it\nseems to me that the Miranda protections give you all --\nor, the Miranda rules give you all the protection you\nneed.\nMR. VERRILLI: I don't think so, Justice\nKennedy. A couple things. First of all, it seems to me\nthat to reach that conclusion that the Court really\nwould have to overrule what is a key holding in Jackson,\nand I don't think that that would be appropriate to do\nin this case for a whole host of reasons.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm wondering if\nthere is some further rule, could the prosecutor talk to\nthe defendant if the defendant was in the cell and the\nprosecutor walked by, saying, \"I know you have an\nattorney, but I would like to talk to you\"? Could the\nprosecutor do that consistently with the Sixth\nAmendment?\nMR. VERRILLI: Yes. It depends on\ninitiation. It depends on who initiates.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Really? The lawyer --\nMR. VERRILLI: If the defendant --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The lawyer can talk to a\nclient for another lawyer?\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, if the -- if the\ndefendant initiates, then the defendant is -- then the\nbar of Jackson doesn't apply. That's the rule, but the\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, again, if that's --\nif that's the principle that you're operating on and\nthat you'd concede, then I think the Miranda warnings\nwould suffice to give all the protection you need.\nMR. VERRILLI: I don't -- apart from the\nquestion of whether you can reach that result without\noverruling the core holding of Jackson here, it does\nseem to me, with all due respect, we don't agree with\nthat because, on the one hand, we do think that free\nchoice is preserved in the existing regime and, on the\nother, hand we don't think Miranda can give you all the\nprotection you need.\nAnd I think a good illustration of that is\nthis Court's decision in the Moran case. Now, recall in\nMoran, that was an interrogation that occurred before\nthe defendant's Sixth Amendment rights had attached, and\nthe -- and the police -- and the defendant had a lawyer\nin that case. His sister had hired a lawyer for him.\nThe lawyer was trying to reach him. The police kept him\naway, kept the lawyer away from the defendant. The\nCourt held that, in the Fifth Amendment context, because\nthe Sixth Amendment right had not attached, that the\nMiranda warnings sufficed to guarantee the reliability\nof the confession.\nBut the Court was very quick to point out,\nand then reiterated this again in Patterson, that in the\nSixth Amendment context that would be a violation\nbecause it's an interference with the relationship\nbetween the defendant and his lawyer, and the ability of\nthe defendant to rely on the lawyer. And that's the\nkey.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is that, whether or not\nthe defendant initiates the contact. I mean, in civil\nmatters, it's contrary to the ethics of the bar to\ninterrogate the party on the other side when you know he\nhas a lawyer, and that would be the case even if he\ninitiated it. You wouldn't think of negotiating with\nhim without consulting the other lawyer, saying, \"Can I\ntalk to your client?\" So that doesn't stretch over to\nthis, to this situation.\nWe're not applying bar ethical rules. We're\napplying, supposedly, a rule that determines when a\nconfession is coerced. All right? That's what we're\ndoing here.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, what the -- we're\napplying -- the question here is whether defendants in\nthis category, the category that Mr. Montejo is in,\nautomatic appointment, are entitled to the same Sixth\nAmendment protection as defendants who are in the\ncategory of -- who are brought to trial in States where\nthey -- you have this colloquy as part of the initial\nhearing where the defendant is asked.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why couldn't we solve your\npractical problem that we don't know in many States\nwhether the defendant accepted appointment or not, by\nsimply saying it is not enough to simply accept\nappointment of counsel; you must have requested counsel.\nTo merely say, \"Oh, that's great, you appointed me\ncounsel\" --\nMR. VERRILLI: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You must have requested it.\nAnd that would be in accord with the holding of Michigan\nv. Jackson and would solve all of your -- all of your\npractical problems.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, two things, Your Honor.\nFirst, it seems to me that what the dispute here is is\nwhether there is a principled basis for treating these\ntwo categories of defendants differently, the defendants\nwho are brought to hearings in States where the\nprocedures require that they be asked and defendants who\nare brought to hearing in States where they are\nautomatically appointed counsel without a showing of\nindigency -- upon a showing of indigency. And I don't\n-- I think with respect to the question of practical\nproblems going forward, sure, if all States -- if the\nStates in that second category were to conform their\npractices such that the defendants were asked and had\nthe opportunity to say yes, indeed, I want counsel, then\nI suppose the problem would be solved. But you really\nget to the same place by holding, as we submit the Court\nreally should hold, that when -- when you have an\nautomatic appointment, unless there is some reason to\nthink the defendant is rejecting it, that Jackson kicks\nin and that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What happens under Michigan\nv. Jackson if I have never requested counsel? I've\nnever asked the court to appoint counsel, but I've gone\nout and hired counsel of my own, right?\nMR. VERRILLI: Sure. I think it's quite\nclear that the rule of Michigan against Jackson applies,\nand that's because --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is it clear from Michigan\nv. Jackson itself, or --\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, from cases applying it,\nbecause in that situation the person is deemed to assert\nthe right to counsel by hiring a lawyer, just as by\nasking, and the question here is when you have an\nautomatic appointment why should you treat that category\nof defendants any differently for purposes of applying\nthe Jackson rule?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Verrilli, do I\nunderstand correctly that the scenario here was the\ndefendant, uncounseled, was taken before a judicial\nofficer who read him rather standard information, one\npiece of information was, I'm appointing a lawyer for\nyou? Was there any opportunity for the defendant to say\nanything at that hearing?\nMR. VERRILLI: And that's the whole problem\nhere, Justice Ginsburg. All we have is a one-page\nminute order which reflects that counsel was appointed.\nIt doesn't reflect anything about a colloquy because in\nthe normal course there's not -- there's no occasion for\nthe colloquy. You come in, you get your lawyer, a\ndecision about bail is made, and you move on, and the\nnext person comes in and that happens.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: He didn't get -- he\ndidn't in fact get a lawyer. I thought he was told that\nthe public defender --\nMR. VERRILLI: The Office of Indigent\nCounsel is appointed to represents you.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Right, and the actual\nlawyer didn't show up until later.\nMR. VERRILLI: Right. The way the process\nworks is -- it's not in the record, but the way the\nprocess works in this judicial district is there is a\nlegal assistant there who takes the names of people who\nneed lawyers and then immediately -- and the public\ndefender service in this district is a contract service.\nThey're private attorneys who contract out to do it.\nAnd then the legal assistant immediately calls, tells\nthe lawyers, well, here is who you are representing.\nNow, in a case like this one, which is a\ncapital case, there was of course a great sense of\nurgency. There are only two lawyers in this district\nwho are qualified to represent capital defendants. They\ngot called immediately. Recall what happened here was\nthat this hearing took place in the morning and Mr.\nMontejo gets taken back to the jail and very soon after\nhe arrives he gets checked back out by these officers\nagain and taken out in the squad car where he is kept\nfor six hours, and in the meantime essentially while\nhe's going out the back door, while he's being taken out\nthe back door with the police, his lawyer is coming in\nthe front door and raising holy heck about the fact that\nhis client's not --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the rule\nyou're asking for would apply across the board. How\nwould it apply in a case where the defendant is given\nMiranda warnings, says, thank you, I don't want to talk\nto my lawyer, I want to talk to you. He's talking to\nthe police. All of a sudden they bring a note in and\nsay: They've appointed a lawyer. The police says: I\njust got a note; you've been appointed a lawyer. Do you\nwant to keep talking?\nYou would say that's a violation, right?\nAnd then he says yes and continues to talk.\nMR. VERRILLI: If the police initiated the\ninterrogation, yes, because I think it gets to the heart\nof the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's a violation,\neven though he knows that if he wanted a lawyer he could\nrequest one, he knows one's been appointed for him, and\nhe's been warned that if he doesn't want to talk without\na lawyer he doesn't have to, and he's in the middle of a\nconversation that he initiated, and the police says, do\nyou want to keep talking? That's a violation?\nMR. VERRILLI: I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.\nIf the defendant initiated the conversation --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Early on, before the\nlawyer was appointed, he's given Miranda warnings and he\nsays: I want to talk. He's talking. They say: Now,\nwe just got the word; a lawyer has been appointed; do\nyou want to keep talking? He says yes. That's a\nviolation?\nMR. VERRILLI: If the police initiated the\ninterrogation, it's a violation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm trying to\n-- which stage are you talking about, before the lawyer\nwas appointed or after? I'm telling you before he was\nappointed, the police did not initiate the conversation.\nThey told him he didn't have to talk. He says: I want\nto talk. Now, you're saying it counts as initiating the\ninterrogation if they say: You've got a lawyer; do you\nwant to keep talking?\nMR. VERRILLI: No, I think that in that\nsituation the defendant has initiated and then you've\ngot the kind of free choice that the law respects, and\nthat's where the line is drawn here. But that is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is he -- where\nis the initiation? Is it when he says, yes, I want to\nkeep talking, after being told -- asked do you want to\nkeep talking? Or is it way back at the beginning?\nMR. VERRILLI: It's at the outset.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: At the outset.\nMR. VERRILLI: At the outset, it seems to\nme. He has initiated. He exercises free choice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't that what\nhappened here? He had been given his Miranda warnings,\nright?\nMR. VERRILLI: No, it isn't what happened\nhere at all. In fact, it seems to me the opposite, the\nopposite thing happened here. For one thing, as a\nfactual matter he was told by the police on September\n10th that he didn't have a lawyer, despite the fact that\none had been appointed for him in the morning. That was\nhis testimony.\nNow, I recognize that there is a factual\nissue here that is not resolved, but the Louisiana\nSupreme Court did not discredit that testimony. It\nacknowledged it. What it said was -- and I think this\npoints up, Justice Kennedy, what the problem is with\nrelying solely on Miranda -- that even in that\nsituation, even if it's true that the police officers\ntold him on September 10th that he did not have a\nlawyer, that that wouldn't rise to the level of a\nproblem that would cause a Fifth Amendment issue under\nMiranda because of the facts of Moran. And it seems to\nme that's exactly the problem there, that that means in\nfact, if we apply Moran that way, that the police could\ndeliberately tell him incorrectly that he didn't have a\nlawyer when he did.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But wouldn't that be a\nMiranda problem?\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, I don't -- well, Moran\nsays no.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Miranda.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, Moran says that a\nMiranda waiver is valid despite that kind of deception.\nThat's the problem here, it seems to me. It does get to\nthe difference. In the Fifth Amendment context, the\nright to have a lawyer there is a prophylactic\nprotection against a coerced self-incrimination in the\nsetting of custodial interrogation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You think, given Moran,\nthat there was no Miranda violation here?\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, I think it would be\nhard, given Moran, to say that there was. And that\npoints up the problem. The essence of this right is the\nright to rely on the assistance of counsel at critical\nstages and interrogation is a critical stage.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Verrilli, is it part\nof your assumption that at the time the police were\ndoing the interrogating that they knew he had been\nappointed a lawyer?\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, I think that's a bit\ncomplicated, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's why I'm interested\nin your comment.\nMR. VERRILLI: But here's my best way to\nwork through the facts. Detective Hall, the only\nofficer who testified, testified that he was not aware.\nThe State court credited that and we don't take issue\nwith it. The problem is that this is a police precinct\nthat has, I don't know, maybe 10, 12 officers in it.\nThey have a capital murder suspect in there. He was\ntaken by the police to the hearing. The police were\npresent at the hearing that morning. He was taken back\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you presume -- do you\nargue that we should presume that the entire police\nforce is aware of what happened in court?\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, I think -- I think\nunder Jackson, Justice Stevens, they are charged with\nthe knowledge. And I think it's important that they\nhave to be charged with the knowledge, because otherwise\nthere is all kinds of room for manipulation and\ndeception. And I do think that's a big part of the\nproblem here, that -- and I also think it's important to\npoint out as a factual matter the one detective who did\ntestify, Detective Hall, testified very carefully. He\ntestified that he asked the defendant when he went to\nsee him whether he had been contacted by counsel or\nwhether his family had gotten him a lawyer, and of\ncourse neither of those things was true. He was\nindigent, his family hadn't gotten him a lawyer, and he\nhadn't yet been contacted by counsel. He didn't ask\nhim: Did you have a lawyer appointed for you?\nJUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Verrilli, do you think\nthat Michigan v. Jackson is immune from being reexamined\nat this point?\nMR. VERRILLI: I think it ought not be\nreexamined here, Justice Alito, for several reasons.\nOne, the Respondent has not asked for it. Two, there's\na special justification that has to be shown to overrule\nit, as Dickerson says, in the Miranda context, and this\nis quite parallel.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if we were no longer\nto adhere to that rule on issues of constitutional\ncriminal procedure?\nMR. VERRILLI: I think it's quite important\nthat the Court do so, and there was a strong consensus\nin Dickerson that the Court do so. I think there's a\nreal problem. This is not something that should be done\nlightly based on four pages of discussion in one amicus\nbrief. There's a very sharp dividing line in the law\nbetween the Fifth Amendment and the Sixth Amendment\nhere, and it applies in numerous areas.\nIt's true, for example, with respect to\nlineups. You can have an uncounseled lineup before the\nSixth Amendment right attaches, you can't after. You\ncan have an uncounseled psychiatric examination before\nit attaches, you can't after. You can engage in\nsurreptitious interrogation of a suspect before the\nFifth Amendment -- before the Sixth Amendment right\nattaches; you can't after. Certain kinds of\narraignments have to be done in the presence of counsel.\nSo it seems to me you would be destabilizing\na whole significant area of law without very much\nconsideration here were you to say that in this context\nwe're going to just say that the Fifth Amendment and the\nSixth Amendment operate in an equivalent manner.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We wouldn't be saying that.\nWe would just be saying that it is unrealistic to think\nthat a confession is coerced simply because the police\ninitiated the conversation so long as he said: Okay,\nI'll speak without my counsel present. That's all we --\nI don't see how it would infect any of these other\nareas. It would just say that's -- that's one bridge\ntoo far. This is prophylaxis on prophylaxis.\nMR. VERRILLI: You would be overruling\nJackson in that regard.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's true, but not much\nelse.\nMR. VERRILLI: And in a case in which it\nseems to me manifestly not appropriate to do so, given\nthe lack of consideration given to this by the\nRespondent --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's a different\nquestion.\nMR. VERRILLI: And -- well, this is serious\nbusiness. You are going to overrule a precedent that's\nbeen in place for more than 20 years, that provides a\nvery clear bright-line rule for the police to -- to\nmanage their affairs with not the slightest showing that\nthis rule is presenting any practical problems in its\nadministration out there in the field. Nobody has even\nargued that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, Mr. Verrilli, you\nhave spoken of -- of overruling a bright line, but I\nthink there is something else that would be involved in\nthe overruling. And I -- I haven't pulled Jackson back\nout since I came on the bench, so this is where you've\ngot to help me out.\nThere is a -- there is a difference between\nthe way you are phrasing the Sixth Amendment right and\nthe way, for example, Justice Scalia has phrased it in\nhis question. Justice Scalia has phrased it in terms of\ndetermining what is a coerced confession. You have\nphrased it in your argument in terms of saying a right\nto rely upon counsel, which is a much broader concept.\nDoes Jackson support the notion that he\nsimply has a right to rely upon counsel? I think that\nis your principal argument here because that would be\nthe argument that supports your claim that there\nshouldn't be a distinction between a case in which the\nState simply appoints counsel without being asked and a\ncase in which he actually asks for counsel. That would\nbe a nice way of rationalizing that distinction.\nIsn't it the case that you understand\nJackson to be a broader rule than a merely no-coercion\nrule? And, number two, if that is so, then overruling\nJackson would, as I take it, in your view be more than\nsimply substituting a -- a one bright-line coercion rule\nfor a different bright-line coercion rule. So what are\nyour responses to those two questions?\nMR. VERRILLI: That is absolutely correct,\nJustice Souter. The text of the Sixth Amendment\nprovides that the -- the accused shall have the right to\nthe assistance of counsel. The essence of the right is\nthe right to rely on the lawyer at critical stages of\nthe proceeding.\nAnd what Jackson says is that that right\ndeserves a very significant measure of protection, and\nwe are going to assume that once a defendant asserts it,\nthe defendant wants the -- wants the assistance of\ncounsel through every critical stage of the proceeding.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You have to assume that his\nvoluntary relinquishment of it is somehow coerced. I\nmean there -- there is no way around that. The man has\nsaid: I know I have counsel, but that's okay; I'll talk\nanyway. And you say: So long as the police have\ninitiated that conversation, we will deem it to be\ncoerced. You can't get around the coercion aspect of --\nof this matter. But that question is whether that is at\nall realistic.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, I think -- I think the\nfacts of this case make it quite clear that it's a very\nserious risk. Here you have a situation in which a\ndefendant who, after all, even before his right attached\nhas been subjected to very, very aggressive tactics that\nthe Louisiana Supreme Court recognized presented even a\nclose case even -- even under the Fifth Amendment.\nThen he -- he finally has a 72-hour hearing.\nHe gets a lawyer appointed. As soon as he gets back,\nthey take him out in a squad car for six or seven hours,\nat the end of which he produces a -- an apology-letter\nconfession written on a pad with a pen given to him by\nthe police officers and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Again, you are\narguing the facts of a particular case, and we are\nlooking at a rule that is going to apply across the\nboard. In a particular case, as you say, the Louisiana\nSupreme Court said this almost violated his Fifth\nAmendment right. There are protections against the\nactual coercion, which it seems to me you're arguing.\nAs I understood Justice Scalia's question, he says:\nDon't you have to assume that there is coercion even in\nthe mildest case, not the most extreme one, but the\nmildest one?\nMR. VERRILLI: No, you have -- what you have\nis a right to rely on the assistance of your lawyer, and\nyou have -- and -- and it's critical. A good example of\nwhy it's critical --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A right that you can\nrelinquish, a right that you can waive, and all that's\nbeing suggested is that it is not totally determinative\nwhether the police say: Do you want to keep talking, or\nif the defendant says: I want to keep talking.\nMR. VERRILLI: But Jackson drew a clear\nline. It did so because -- and the Court has said -- it\nwas a -- a prophylactic rule, but it's a prophylactic\nrule that represents -- reflects the centrality of -- of\nthe --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right, and whether\nor --\nMR. VERRILLI: -- criminal process.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- whether or not\nyour -- your dialogue with my colleagues about\noverruling Jackson -- putting that to one side, what you\nare arguing is an extension of Jackson from the context\nin which it arose to this context.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, I think two -- two\npoints on that, Mr. Chief Justice: First, I think it\nwould actually break new ground for this Court to hold\nthat the defendant who has a lawyer isn't entitled to\nthe protection of Jackson. This Court has never held\nthat. And every time it has addressed the issue, it\nsaid the opposite. Admittedly in dictum, but in\nPatterson and Moran it said the opposite. So that is\nwhat is really breaking new ground, it seems to me.\nAnd second, the only way to treat these two\ncategories of people differently is to come up with a\nprincipled distinction for why the right should apply\ndifferently to one than the other, and I submit that\nnone has been offered.\nI would like to reserve the balance of my\ntime. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Landry.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHRYN W. LANDRY\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. LANDRY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe generous prophylactic rule of Michigan\nv. Jackson which imputed a defendant's request for\ncounsel in one forum, i.e., his arraignment, to another\nforum of post-attachment custodial interrogation should\nnot be expanded in this case to a defendant who has done\nnothing whatsoever to make such a request.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did he have an\nopportunity to do it at the so-called 72-hour hearing?\nWas there any -- did the judicial officer ever ask him\nanything about whether he wanted counsel, whether he\naccepted counsel? Was there any colloquy between them\nat all?\nMS. LANDRY: Not that I'm aware of, Justice\nGinsburg.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And is that standard\noperating procedure at these 72-hour hearings: That the\n-- the defendant, who is there uncounseled is -- is just\nstanding there, and the judicial officer says: I'm\nappointing counsel for you, and he goes on to the next\nthing he's telling him?\nMS. LANDRY: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that how it operates?\nMS. LANDRY: Yes, Your Honor, that is how it\noperates.\nBut I think one of the fallacies of\nPetitioner's argument is that it leads to the conclusion\nthat this defendant had to make that choice at that\nmoment at that hearing, and that is not what we have\nasserted either in the Louisiana Supreme Court or at\nthis Court.\nOur position is he needs to make a request.\nWhether the request is made in the court proceeding,\nwhich Jackson said he can make it in the court\nproceeding and it applies thereafter to critical stages,\nwhich would include custodial interrogation, but in this\ncase after they approached him again, there's no request\nat the hearing --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did anybody ever tell him\nhe needed to request? I mean, he had just been told by\na judicial officer: I'm appointing counsel for you.\nHe's not counseled at that point. How does he know\nthat, in order to protect his right to counsel, he has\nto make some kind of an affirmative assertion? He's\njust been told he's got one.\nMS. LANDRY: Because subsequently, when the\npolice approached him, again there being no request\nprior to this that prohibited them from approaching him,\nthey provided him with his Miranda rights, which\nPatterson says is sufficient in the context of a\ncustodial interrogation that takes place\npost-attachment.\nThey provided him with his rights, which\nincluded the right to counsel, and he then waived those\nrights. In fact, this particular defendant on seven\noccasions, three of which -- four of which were\npre-attachment and three of which were post-attachment,\nwas given his rights, including the right to counsel,\nand each of those seven times waived in writing those\nrights.\nOur position is what he needed to do for\nJackson is make some sort of request or some sort of\npositive assertion that he was asserting his request for\ncounsel.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I would have no problem\nat all with the argument you are making if someone had\ntold him that he needed to do that. But he didn't have\na judge to tell him that; he didn't have a lawyer to\ntell him that; and the police certainly didn't tell him\nthat.\nMS. LANDRY: No, but when the police did\napproach him after that 72-hour hearing, they advised\nhim again of his rights, including his right to counsel,\nand asked him if he wished to waive those rights.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Excuse me. They advised\nhim, you say, of his right to counsel. If they gave him\nthe standard Miranda warning, what they said was: You\nhave the right to have a counsel appointed. They didn't\nsay: You have a lawyer who has been appointed. And, in\nfact, his testimony at least is that they told him the\nopposite. But if all they did was give him the Miranda\nwarning, they certainly were not informing him of his\nSixth Amendment right or his Sixth Amendment status.\nMS. LANDRY: I would respectfully disagree,\nYour Honor, because in Patterson the Court said that the\nMiranda rights were sufficient to apprise a defendant of\nhis post-attachment Sixth Amendment rights. Did they\ntell him you have a lawyer appointed? No. In fact,\nDetective Hall testified that he was not aware of the\n72-hour hearing or the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's very puzzling.\nThis is an experienced police officer. The 72-hour\nhearing is required in every case where defendant is in\nState custody. So how could an experienced police\nofficer not know? Somebody, by the way, who knew this\nman had been kept until -- even more than 72 hours. And\nhe testifies -- it's true that Detective Hall testified:\nI didn't know that he appointed -- had been appointed a\nlawyer. The very same day that he got to the 72-hour\nhearing a day late, how could he not have known?\nMS. LANDRY: I can't answer that question.\nI can only answer the question that all of the officers\ntestified that they were not aware that counsel had been\nappointed for the defendant that morning.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, they know\n-- it's a death case -- that counsel is going to be\nappoint -- or it's a murder case -- that counsel is\ngoing to be appointed. Everybody knows that except this\ndefendant. He doesn't know; of course he doesn't know.\nMS. LANDRY: I understand. They testified\nthat they weren't aware that counsel had not been\nappointed that morning.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Just to clarify in my mind.\nCase one, the defendant has no lawyer. He is -- they\ngive him Miranda warning. He says: I don't want a\nlawyer. Okay. Now, do you want to speak against\nyourself? Yes, he says, I do. Sorry, strike -- he\nsays: No, I don't; I don't want to say anything, but I\ndon't want a lawyer.\nSix hours later the policemen say to him:\nAre you really sure that you don't want to speak? He\nsays: Well, maybe I will, and he makes a full\nabsolutely voluntary decision. That's okay under the\nConstitution, right?\nMS. LANDRY: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, it's the same\ncase, except this time he says: I have a lawyer; I\nhired him yesterday. Now the policeman cannot say, are\nyou sure? Is that correct?\nMS. LANDRY: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's the law. So, the\nlaw is -- and the reason for that second is because once\nyou have a lawyer, police communicate through the\nlawyer. Isn't that the reason, basically? I just\nalways thought that was the reason. Once a person has a\nlawyer, another lawyer communicates through the lawyer.\nThey don't go and talk to the client. I thought that\nwas the kind of rationale for it. Maybe I'm wrong.\nMS. LANDRY: No, I don't think that you're\nwrong. I think that is part of the rationale. What\nJackson is trying to do was to deter --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, if the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. I think it's --\nI think it's wrong. I think it's common ground that so\nlong as he says, even though I have a lawyer, I'll talk\nto you, that's okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not talking about that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that's not okay in\ncivil cases, but it's perfectly okay here.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I was trying to give a\nhypothetical and my hypothetical is a different one than\nyou were just told. In my hypothetical the person has a\nlawyer, and I thought where he has a lawyer the police\nare not allowed to go and ask him questions about\nwhether he wants to waive. Of course, he can volunteer\nit. Am I right about that?\nMS. LANDRY: Yes, but I also thought that\nyour hypothetical included the fact that he told the\npolice that he had a lawyer, I retained one yesterday,\nwhich I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's correct, that's\ncorrect.\nMS. LANDRY: -- which I think goes further.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Correct.\nMS. LANDRY: To me that connotes under\nJackson --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Correct, that's the\nconundrum of the case. Now I understand it. The\nconundrum of this case is he didn't tell the police, I\nhave a lawyer. He had one.\nNow, if he had hired one and not told the\npolice, it would be the same result as we just said,\nwouldn't it? If he had one but didn't tell the police,\nthe police could not initiate questioning; am I right or\nwrong? All I'm driving at is shouldn't the result here\nbe the same?\nMS. LANDRY: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The same whether you hired\nthe lawyer or the same whether the lawyer was appointed?\nAt least that's what's in my head. And if you can show\nme that you want the same result in both cases, that\nwould go a long way towards convincing me.\nMS. LANDRY: I would disagree with your last\nhypothetical because if a defendant goes out and hires a\nlawyer but never says anything to the police, he makes\nno request, no statement to them regarding the lawyer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: He tells some of the\npolice. Some of the police know. It just happens that\nthese particular ones don't.\nMS. LANDRY: I think if he voices to the\npolice some type of positive affirmation -- I have a\nlawyer, I got a lawyer yesterday -- to me that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just interrupt.\nIsn't it perfectly realistic to presume that the police\nknew at the 72-hour hearing he was appointed a lawyer?\nMS. LANDRY: Well, I don't know that you can\npresume that. I mean, you would be overriding the\ntestimony of the officers.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it happens in 99\npercent of the cases, I think, in a capital case. And\nsurely, the police should be presumed to know what the\nnormal procedure is.\nMS. LANDRY: And in this case, even if you\npresumed that they knew that he had a lawyer, I still\ndon't think it overrides the key issue in Jackson as I\nsee it, which is his request for counsel, some type of\naffirmation or statement or action to the police that he\nwants to deal through his counsel.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that doesn't go to the\nissue in this case. The issue in this case, as I\nunderstand it, is not that he lost because he failed to\nmake a request. He lost because he failed to make it\naffirmatively clear that he accepted the appointment of\nthe lawyer who had, in fact, been appointed for him as\nhe had been told. That's not a request.\nAs I understand it, under the -- under the\nState court ruling, if he had stood at the 72-hour\nhearing and the court had said, we're appointing the X\noffice to defend you, and he had said, great, that would\nhave changed the result in this case; isn't that\ncorrect?\nMS. LANDRY: Yes, I think so.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So the issue is not\nrequest. The issue is acceptance. That's what it\nseems -- just to get my point, that's what seems to me\nto be the acute point of several of the questions you\nhave been asked. Why -- we're not talking about\nrequests. Why should it make a constitutional\ndifference whether the man stands in a Tennessee\ncourtroom and simply stands silent when they said,\nyou've got a lawyer --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Louisiana.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- as distinct from a case\nwhere they say you have got a lawyer, and he says,\nthat's fine?\nMS. LANDRY: Well, I would disagree with the\ncharacterization. As I see the case, the question is\nJackson turned on the fact that that defendant had asked\nfor, had requested the help of a lawyer. Patterson said\nso. Patterson said Jackson turned on --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but in this very\ncase, if there had been a court reporter present --\npresent, and if the record showed that this defendant\nsaid, thank you, I would like to be represented, then he\nwould have been protected, right?\nMS. LANDRY: I think he would have under\nJackson.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Louisiana does not -- does\nnot provide a transcript of all these hearings, does it?\nMS. LANDRY: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So what would -- what\nshould we presume to be the general practice that\nhappened, that most of them say, no, I don't want one or\nmost of them will say, thank you?\nMS. LANDRY: Well, probably in most cases\nnothing is said. But, again -- and that goes back to my\nearlier point, the police then approached -- I mean, the\ndefendant could have said something at the hearing, but\npresuming nothing was said --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: He had no -- no way of\nknowing that being silent would produce a different\nresult than saying, yes, I'm happy with the lawyer.\nDoes the uncounseled defendant have any way to know\nthat? Does the routine require the judge to tell him,\nyou have got a lawyer, but he's not going to be\navailable unless you say you want him?\nMS. LANDRY: No, because I think\nsubsequently if he doesn't say anything when the police\napproach him, they tell him he has the right to counsel,\nand at that point he can exercise that right and say, I\nwant a lawyer, I don't want to talk to you without a\nlawyer.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Landry, I don't really\nunderstand what you're arguing here. I thought you were\nsaying there has to be a request in your response to\nJustice Souter, but then you accept as sufficient his\nmerely saying thank you. That's not a request.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did the Louisiana Supreme\nCourt say there has to be a request? I thought they\nsaid there had to be some action, affirmative act of\nacceptance.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's what I thought, too.\nBut you were saying there had to be a request. You\nabandon that? There doesn't have to be a request?\nMS. LANDRY: No, I think there does have to\nbe a request --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: \"Thank you\" is not a\nrequest.\nMS. LANDRY: I'm sorry, I didn't finish\nmy --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You're not merely defending\nthe State court here. You're asking for a -- in effect,\na different rule from that which the State court\napplied.\nMS. LANDRY: No, we believe that the State\ncourt was correct when it held that some type of\npositive affirmation -- and that to me is the whole\nquestion --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then are you equating\npositive affirmation with request for a lawyer?\nMS. LANDRY: Yes. I think there has to be\nsome action --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then on your -- then on\nyour theory, this individual's Sixth Amendment right\nwould not have attached if he had stood in the courtroom\nand said, thank you very much, that's great.\nMS. LANDRY: Well, whether the Sixth\nAmendment right attached I think is a different issue\nfrom whether the Jackson rule applies to then bar any\npolice-initiated conversation with him, and the issue I\nthink in this case is whether or not his silence -- the\nPetitioner has argued that the mere appointment of\ncounsel with nothing further by this defendant\nconstituted the request necessary under Jackson to\ninvoke the rule.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: One of my concerns is that\nJackson is a formality, but you're arguing for a\nformality on top of a formality. I don't know what\nfunctional purpose is served by your position that he\nhas to request the lawyer at the arraignment, especially\nwhen he's not versed in the law, he's in this stressful\nsituation, and you require a formalistic request on the\npart of the defendant? It just makes no sense to me.\nMS. LANDRY: But Your Honor, I'm not\nrequiring a formalized request on the part of the\ndefendant at the hearing.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, you're requiring some\nkind of ritualistic phrase to indicate that he -- that\nhe accepts the appointment.\nMS. LANDRY: No.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That he requests the\nappointment.\nMS. LANDRY: No, sir. I believe that he can\nremain silent, but later, just as in this case, the\npolice approach him; under Patterson they give him his\nrights, which include right to counsel. At that point\nhe can request and invoke, and then Jackson becomes\napplicable because he has made a request.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I understood you to\nconcede that if he had made that request at the 72-hour\nhearing, the outcome of this case would be different.\nMS. LANDRY: Yes, because Jackson says he\ncan make the request --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The key time is did he\nmake the request at the hearing, not at the time he was\nconfronted by the officers.\nMS. LANDRY: I was just saying he can make\nit either time. The fallacy of their argument is that\nhe has to make it --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it's sufficient\nprotection for him if you presume, as is true in most\nStates, that he did make the request, then you would\nlose. You would argue against such a presumption, I\nknow, but if we did indulge that presumption, the case\nwould be over.\nMS. LANDRY: Clearly I would argue against\nany such presumption; that's the whole reason -- the key\nto Jackson was --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, I didn't\nunderstand you to be doing that. I thought your\nposition was once there's a request, there's a request,\nand that's enough.\nMS. LANDRY: Yes, I do.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you're also arguing, it\nseems to me, that a request -- well, you're -- I think\nyou're arguing two different things. On the one hand,\nyou're arguing that a request is necessary, and yet on\nthe other hand, I understood you to concede in answer to\na question from me that if he had stood in the courtroom\nin Tennessee, having been told that counsel was\nappointed for him and had said, yes, thank you, I accept\nthat lawyer, that that would have been sufficient to\nsatisfy Jackson, and that would have made the difference\nin this case.\nThose are two different positions.\nMS. LANDRY: Well, but I think the question\nboils down to whether or not the latter hypothetical,\n\"yes, I want one,\" whether that is enough to constitute\nthe request under Jackson.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, so far as I\nunderstand it, and you correct me if I'm wrong, but as I\nunderstand it, what the State Supreme Court said was not\nthat he had to make a request, \"I want a lawyer,\" but\nsimply that he had to indicate in some way that he\naccepted the appointment of the lawyer which he had been\ntold had been appointed for him; and that is a different\nsituation from Jackson.\nSo if -- if you are saying, yes, if he had\nsaid \"thank you, I accept the lawyer,\" that would have\nbeen enough, then that in effect is -- is maintaining\nthe position that the State court took; but if you're\nsaying something more, that he had to say then or later\non, \"I want a lawyer,\" then I think you're going beyond\nthe case that we have in front of us. Am I wrong?\nMS. LANDRY: No, you're not wrong.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So I -- I suppose\nwhat the dialogue simply establishes is that like in any\nsituation there's going to be factual issues about\nwhat's a request or not. I mean, he could say, the\ncourt says I'm appointing Johnson, and he says,\n\"Johnson? Is that the best you can do?\" And the\nquestion is, is that accepting Johnson or not? He says\nis that the best you can do? Maybe it is, maybe it's\nnot. I mean, but the point is whether or not you\nestablish a rule that requires some request, and in the\nodd case there will be a debate about what's a request\nor not, but the issue is the general rule.\nMS. LANDRY: Yes, Your Honor, that's\ncorrect.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't -- I don't --\nI agree with Justice Souter. I -- acceptance is\nsomething different from a request. As I read the --\nthe State court's opinion, it was setting up a sort of\noffer and acceptance scenario. The State was offering\nhim counsel, said, \"I appoint counsel,\" but it was\nineffective until he says yes, \"I accept counsel,\"\nwhereupon, you know, he's lawyered up, but he isn't\nlawyered up until he says \"I accept,\" and that's\nsomething quite different from -- from requesting\ncounsel.\nMS. LANDRY: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now, are you -- are you\nstanding on the -- on the State court's analysis or not?\nMS. LANDRY: Yes, Your Honor, and I think\nthe State court analysis comes from -- well, it came\nfrom the Fifth Circuit case of Montoya which was very\nsimilar factually, and the Fifth Circuit relied on the\nCourt's opinion in Patterson, and I believe cited a\nfootnote from Patterson that refers to, you know,\naffirmative acceptance of the appointment of counsel.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But this is still an\nartificial framework, because we know that in this case\nhe has to have a lawyer under Gideon unless he waives it\nafter being fully advised. You couldn't rely just on --\non the failure to make a request not to proceed with a\ntrial lawyer. Of course he's going to have a lawyer\nunless after he very, very careful colloquy from the\ndistrict judge or the trial judge, declines.\nSo it seems to me that this -- this whole\nframework here is quite artificial. Now, I do think\nthere's a Miranda problem here, if we accept his -- the\ndefendant's testimony that the police told him, \"oh no,\nyou don't have a lawyer.\" I know there's a factual\nissue on that. And I -- I think the counsel for the\nPetitioner may not be quite correct in Moran v Burbine.\nI didn't have time to talk with him about that. There\nthere was no misleading; they just didn't tell him that\nhe had a lawyer. Here, assuming his version of the\nfacts is correct, they told him, \"oh, no, you don't have\na lawyer,\" they affirmatively misled him, and it seems\nto me that's a Miranda problem, if it's true, and that\nMiranda is completely sufficient to protect his rights.\nMS. LANDRY: But also, if I can address that\nfactual issue, because I think it is important in the\ncontext here, because the question presented to this\nCourt, the assignment of error at the Louisiana Supreme\nCourt was only premised on the fact that counsel was\nappointed.\nThere was never any argument -- they bring\nup the factual issues about, well, the defendant\ntestified at trial that he told them he had a lawyer,\nand the officers testified he didn't, to make it appear\nthere's a factual issue there; but if you look back at\nthe proceedings in this case, the motion to suppress,\nwhich is at the Joint Appendix page 6, never alleged any\nof those issues. It only alleged that his statements\nwere not free and voluntary.\nThen the suppression hearing comes. Now,\nmost of the effort at the suppression hearing was toward\nthe videotape which is not at issue here, but the\nargument by the defendant's counsel on this issue was\nmerely what exactly it is here, that the mere\nappointment of counsel was sufficient to trigger\nJackson, and therefore everything after that should not\nhave been admitted.\nThere was never any testimony at the\nsuppression hearing by the defendant or anyone else that\nhe had been -- that he told the officers, \"I've been\nappointed counsel,\" \"I think I've been appointed\ncounsel,\" \"I think I might have a lawyer.\"\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's just that everything\nafter -- as far as I understand, the only piece of\nevidence we're talking about is his condolence letter to\nthe widow which amounted to a confession of guilt.\nMS. LANDRY: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There is no other.\nBecause all of the Mirandized free 72-hour hearing, all\nthat is not in contest; all of that came in.\nMS. LANDRY: That's correct, it's just\nthe --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can I ask -- I'm getting a\ndifferent idea from what you're arguing. I want to try\nit on you and see what your response is. It's simply\nthis, that there's something backwards about this case,\nand what's backwards is this, that when they're talking\nabout a prophylactic rule in Jackson, what they're\nthinking of is the following: Everyone agrees that when\na person really has a counsel, at that point, unlike the\nMiranda point, the police cannot talk to him further,\nthough he can initiate.\nNow, everyone agreeing, what do we do with a\ncase where a person doesn't have a lawyer, but he\nrequests one? Now, in such a circumstance, we're going\nto treat it as if he had one. That's the prophylactic\npart. But here's a case where he really has one. So it\ndoesn't fall outside Jackson. It falls within the basic\nassumption of Jackson, that the difference between\nhaving a lawyer and not having a lawyer is, if you have\na lawyer, the police can initiate nothing. You can't\ntalk to him.\nNow, if that's right, your case -- I mean,\nI'm afraid, their side, for your point of view, is a\nfortiori for Jackson, not the borderline of Jackson.\nNow, explain to me why I've got it wrong.\nMS. LANDRY: Because, in our case and in the\ncase where there's just counsel appointed, again I go\nback to the issue, there's no request; there's no\npositive action by the defendant constituting a request\nin indicating that he's requesting a lawyer, which was\nthe basis of the ruling in Jackson. It was -- and\nPatterson later said, Jackson turned on the fact that\nthat defendant had asked for a lawyer.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, isn't the prophylactic\naspect of Jackson not what Justice Breyer just said, but\nthe rule that a person who has a lawyer is thereafter\nincapable of waiving the assistance of the lawyer if the\nperson wishes to speak with the police and the police\nhappen to initiate the conversation? You could have a\ndefendant who's the most experienced criminal defense\nattorney in the world, who knows everything there is to\nknow about trial tactics, who has a lawyer and decides\nit's in my best interest now to speak to the police.\nThey happen to initiate it. But Jackson has a\nprophylactic rule that says even in that situation, it\ncan't be done. That's the prophylactic aspect of\nJackson, isn't it?\nMS. LANDRY: Well, I would disagree --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Accept that, for argument's\nsake. Accept that, and then same -- same question.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, why don't\nyou answer Justice Alito's question?\nMS. LANDRY: I was going to say that I\ndisagree to the -- to the extent that I think part of\nthe basis of Jackson was wanting to deter police from\nbadgering a defendant into waiving a right that he had\nalready asserted. That was the crux, it seemed to me,\nof Jackson, that this defendant had asserted his right\nto counsel at the arraignment. They then approached him\nlater. And the Court found that that was a form of\npolice badgering to then approach him after he had made\nthe request for counsel. And I believe that that's one\nof the differentiations in this case, where we talk\nabout whether there's a request for counsel.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Interesting. I think this\nis very interesting to me because I'm learning a lot.\nSuppose -- Let's assume Justice Alito is absolutely\nright and that when you have a counsel, that's what\nyou've done and that's the reason why you don't talk to\nthe police, or at least they can't initiate. Fine.\nTake that as the rationale, and now apply it to this\ncase. Since he has a lawyer, whether he said yes, no,\nmaybe, \"I accept\" or not, it would have nothing to do\nwith it. The same rationale would apply or would it?\nMS. LANDRY: No, I don't think it would.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because?\nMS. LANDRY: Because, again, the appointment\nof counsel, as in this case, was an action taken by the\nState. There was no action by this defendant asserting\nor requesting counsel. This was a State action: We're\nappointing counsel for you. It's a pro forma thing that\ngoes on, and then subsequently they go through the\npaperwork to determine whether he's qualified --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I see.\nMS. LANDRY: -- to receive indigent counsel.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you: If the\ncase had gone to trial without any intermediate\nproceeding -- they just show up for the day of trial --\nand there's no record of whether he accepted the lawyer\nearlier, would the State judge start out with the\npresumption that Faretta would apply and he's going on\nhis own, or would they start out with the assumption\nthat he is going to have a lawyer?\nMS. LANDRY: No, Your Honor, because,\nobviously, just as Patterson discussed, the waiver issue\nis much different when you're talking about a defendant\nproceeding through a legal proceeding representing\nhimself than it is in the context here.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So you're drawing a\ndistinction between this -- the kind of proceeding\nthat's involved? He doesn't really need help on\ndeciding whether to confess, but he does need help if\nthey go to trial?\nMS. LANDRY: Well, it's not that he doesn't\nneed help, but he's advised of his right to counsel and\ncan voluntarily choose, exercise his own free will,\nwhether he wants counsel or not.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: There's an irony in this\ncase that Justice Kennedy put a finger on earlier: If\nthere were a civil case, whether you could go talk to a\nlawyer -- a client, rather, who was represented by a\nlawyer, the answer would be quite clear: You could not,\nas a matter of professional ethics.\nMS. LANDRY: Right, and I think that that's\ntrue of the --\nJUSTICE STEVEN: And the Constitution gives\nless protection than the -- than the professional ethics\ndoes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, the usual legal\nrule is that silence implies consent, right? Read the\nprosecution of Thomas More. That's the legal rule. So\nwhy shouldn't we assume consent just from the fact that\nhe stood silent?\nMS. LANDRY: Because, again, in Jackson, the\nassertion or the request for counsel is what implies to\nthe police that this defendant does not want to deal\nwith the police on his own, that he wishes to only\ncommunicate through counsel. And the Sixth Amendment\nright that attached and his right to counsel is just\nthat: It's a right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Landry, you're trying\nto explain your position, let's assume, to an\nintelligent layperson, and the first example is, in many\nStates at the equivalent of the 72-hour hearing, the\ndefendant is told: The court is prepared to appoint a\nlawyer for you. Would you like us to appoint a lawyer?\nAnd the defendant will say yes. So he will have made\nthe request for a lawyer. And then there are States\nlike Louisiana where this is a rapid-fire proceeding,\nand the defendant isn't asked any questions, he isn't\nasked to agree or disagree, and he doesn't have any\nlawyer there to assist him.\nSo you are essentially asking the Court to\nmake a distinction between defendants in the same\nposition, both uncounseled, both not knowledgeable in\nthe law, but the one who has the good fortune to be in a\nState where the judge tells the defendant, \"You have a\nright to have a lawyer. Would you like me to appoint\none?\" And then this procedure. Shouldn't defendant's\nrights turn on that distinction in the State law?\nMS. LANDRY: Yes, because the police then\napproach him under Patterson, give him his rights, which\nincludes the right to counsel. He has every right to\nthen exercise his free will, if he didn't do so at the\nhearing, and invoke his right to counsel.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMS. LANDRY: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Verrilli, you\nhave four minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. VERRILLI: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nA couple points of clarification, if I\nmight: Counsel for Respondent has made the suggestion\nthat the only facts that are before you are the facts\nthat were in the suppression hearing, rather than the\nfacts that were subsequently adduced at trial when Mr.\nMontejo testified that he told them he didn't want to go\nwith them and he thought he had a lawyer and was told he\ndidn't. That's not correct as a matter of Louisiana\nlaw. The citation there is State v. Green, 655 Southern\n2d 272, where it's quite clear as a matter of Louisiana\nlaw that the supreme court evaluates the entire record.\nIt's not clear as a matter of federal law. That was one\nof the holdings of Arizona against Fulminante. Now, we\ncited that case for harmless error purposes, not this\npurpose, but --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Verrilli --\nMR. VERRILLI: -- but quite clear --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- you just struck two\nchords: One, harmless error; the other, that this\ndefendant testified at his trial. We have held that a\ndefendant's statements, although he wasn't given his\nJackson right, can come in by way of impeachment if he\ntestifies. So in this defendant's case, even if we\naccept everything you say, the -- that condolence letter\ncould have been used for impeachment purposes.\nMR. VERRILLI: Yes. We don't contest that,\nJustice Ginsburg. Of course, it wasn't used for\nimpeachment purposes; it was used in fact as substantive\nevidence, and there was no limiting instruction to let\nthe jury know that it could only be considered for that\nlimited purpose. And I don't think that suffices even\nremotely to overcome the harmless error problem here.\nThe second point of clarification, it does\nseem to me clear, both from pages 14 and 15 of\nRespondent's brief and Respondent's argument here today\nand in particular the citation to the Montoya case in\nthe Fifth Circuit, they are not advocating a request\nrule; they are advocating a request or assertion rule.\nIn fact, the very passage in Montoya to which\nRespondent's counsel adverts -- it says there doesn't\nhave to be a request so long as there is an assertion.\nAnd that's the principle they're advocating.\nIt just doesn't make any sense as a sensible dividing\nline between categories of defendants who are protected\nby Jackson and those who aren't for the reasons that we\nhave discussed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Verrilli, I don't\nunderstand your response to Justice Ginsburg. I mean,\nit seems to me, if this thing was going to come in\nanyway, how could you possibly say it was harmful and\nnot harmless error?\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, it would come --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What difference does it\nmake whether it's introduced in the case in chief or\nwhether it's introduced to refute the defendant's\nassertion that he didn't do it?\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, if it's introduced in\nthe case in chief, it's substantive evidence on which\nthe prosecution relied or can rely to establish the\ncase. It's very much like Fulminante in that regard.\nThere were two confessions, one admissible, the other\ninadmissible. And it was the self-reinforcing character\nof the two that made it not a harmless error for\nFulminante. We really have the same thing.\nBut, if I could, I would like to get back,\nJustice Kennedy, to the Moran case. I do think, with\nall due respect, there was an element of deception in\nMoran that was sanctioned as consistent with Miranda.\nTwo things happened there: The police informed Moran's\nlawyer that they -- incorrectly, falsely -- that they\nweren't going to interrogate him, but they also failed\nto inform Moran that he had a lawyer, and the lawyer was\nstanding out there. And that's fully as much of a\ndeception as telling somebody he doesn't have a lawyer\nwhen he does, or withholding information that made a big\ndifference for Sixth Amendment purposes, which is why\nthe Court in Moran drew that line very sharply and said,\nfor Fifth Amendment purposes, the Sixth Amendment right\nhasn't attached, there isn't an interference with the\nattorney-client relationship, but the very same thing\nwould be forbidden under the Sixth Amendment.\nAnd Patterson says exactly the same thing.\nIn Patterson, again -- just to conclude, Justice Breyer\n-- drew the line exactly where Your Honor's hypothetical\ndrew it. What Patterson says is that, if a defendant\ndoes not have a lawyer, we operate one way; when a\ndefendant has a lawyer, a different set of rules kick\nin. And then, it says, indeed the different rules kick\nin even if a defendant requests a lawyer, making clear\nthat the point of extending to request was to put\ndefendants who have asked for lawyers but don't have\nthem yet in the same position as defendants who have\nlawyers, not to give them a superior Sixth Amendment\nprotection.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nVerrilli.\n"
