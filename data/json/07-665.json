        "content": "(10:13 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Case 07-665, Pleasant Grove City\nv. Summum.\nMr. Sekulow.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY A. SEKULOW\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. SEKULOW: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Tenth Circuit erred when it held that\nthe First Amendment Free Speech Clause forces Pleasant\nGrove City to accept and erect on its property a private\nparty's donated, unattended, permanent monument.\nThe decision suffers from two constitutional\ndefects: First, the court's conclusion that a donated\nTen Commandments monument constitutes private speech\nrather than Government speech is wrong. Here each of\nthe monuments on display in Pioneer Park have been\nselected by the Government, are owned by the Government,\ncontrolled by the Government, and are displayed on\nGovernment property. When the Government is speaking,\nit is free from the traditional free speech constraints\nof the First Amendment.\nSecond, the court compounded its error by\nfurther concluding that Pioneer Park is a traditional\npublic forum for the erection of permanent, unattended\nmonuments by private parties.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Sekulow, you're\nreally just picking your poison, aren't you? I mean,\nthe more you say that the monument is Government speech\nto get out of the first, free speech -- the Free Speech\nClause, the more it seems to me you're walking into a\ntrap under the Establishment Clause. If it's Government\nspeech, it may not present a free speech problem, but\nwhat is the Government doing speaking -- supporting the\nTen Commandments?\nMR. SEKULOW: Well, the Ten Commandments\nhere was displayed in Pioneer Park, as the mayor said,\nMayor Cook, in 1971, to show the pioneer heritage of the\ncommunity. This was a community of pioneers on a quest\nfor religious liberty. That's why this town was\nestablished. There is no Establishment Clause claim,\nMr. Chief Justice, here. It would be inconsistent with\nthe relief that the Respondents are really seeking.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well --\nMR. SEKULOW: And I think that -- yes,\nJustice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I don't want to\ninterrupt your answer to the Chief Justice because I\nthink it's critical, critical to your argument. As a\nprocedural matter, I thought that the Establishment\nClause issue was raised in the initial complaint. Are\nyou taking the position it's now waived or something?\nMR. SEKULOW: Well, there was no Federal\nEstablishment Clause complaint at all. There was a\nState --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It was under the State?\nMR. SEKULOW: It was under the State of\nUtah's Establishment Clause. It was raised in the\ncomplaint. It was not the basis upon which the\ninjunction was sought, and the Tenth Circuit noted that\nit was waived.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If you prevail, the action\nshould be dismissed, as far as you're concerned?\nMR. SEKULOW: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All right.\nMR. SEKULOW: Just let me --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Then getting back to the\nChief Justice's point, it does seem to me that if you\nsay it's Government speech that in later cases,\nincluding the case of the existing monument, you're\ngoing to say it's Government speech and you have an\nEstablishment Clause problem. I don't know if -- I'm\nnot saying it would necessarily be resolved one way or\nthe other, but it certainly raises --\nMR. SEKULOW: Well, I think from an --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- an Establishment Clause\nproblem.\nMR. SEKULOW: If there was an Establishment\nClause claim, Justice Kennedy, which is not here, Van\nOrden forecloses it. This monument is very similar to\nwhat was at play in Van Orden. And here the city stated\nthe reason that they accepted and erected this monument,\naccepted the donation from the Fraternal Order of\nEagles, was to show something and to represent their\npioneer heritage, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose it depends on\nwhat the Government speech consists of, what it is the\nGovernment is saying about the Ten Commandments. If the\nGovernment is saying the Ten Commandments are the word\nof God that's one thing, and if the Government is saying\nthe Ten Commandments are an important part of our\nnational heritage, that's something else.\nMR. SEKULOW: That's -- and precisely,\nJustice Scalia, that's exactly what Mayor Cook in fact,\nat the unveiling ceremony, stated that this will serve\nto remind citizens of their pioneer heritage and the\nfounding of --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you have to --\nMR. SEKULOW: -- their community --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Did the NEA -- Finley v.\nNEA, the Court didn't treat that as Government speech.\nMR. SEKULOW: Right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Or am I -- is that the --\nMR. SEKULOW: No. You're correct. Those\nwere speech selection cases. It think it clearly --\nthat the actions here of the Government, of the City\nCouncil, falls neatly within Forbes, Finley, and the\nplurality in American Library Association. The\nGovernment --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Before we get -- before\nwe get away from the Government, the Establishment\nClause, you said, well, Van Orden answered that, but did\nit? Because you don't have here a 40-year history of\nthis monument being there, and nobody seems to be\ntroubled by it.\nMR. SEKULOW: There is a 36-year history\nhere. This monument has been on display since 1971. So\nthis monument has been there a long time, and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think 38 is the cut-off\npoint.\nMR. SEKULOW: Is that the cut-off?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SEKULOW: Perhaps I miscounted. It may\nbe 38.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Sekulow --\nMR. SEKULOW: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- when you come\nupon this, if somebody comes upon this monument in the\npark, how are they supposed to tell whether it's\nGovernment speech or private speech?\nMR. SEKULOW: Well, of course the face of\nit, Mr. Chief Justice, states on the face of the\nmonument that it's presented to Pleasant Grove City in\nUtah County by the Fraternal Order of Eagles. As far as\na Government speech as far as ownership and control goes\nunder a Johanns analysis, different from Finley and\nForbes and that context, here the Government exercised\ncontrol. After all, they allowed it, accepted it, and\nallowed it to be erected on their property. Under Utah\nlaw, all right, title, and interest to that property\ntransferred.\nBut I would say with regard to the\nendorsement, if you will, or the Establishment Clause\nissue, really the context here, as this Court has\nconsistently stated within the Establishment Clause\ncases matter -- this Court has a depiction of Moses\nholding the Ten Commandment in the frieze of the\ncourtroom with the words written in Hebrew. That's not\nan endorsement of the religion or of the commandments.\nIt's representative of the history.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In the context of all\nother lawgivers. This is a stand-alone Ten Commandments\nand you don't see, I don't think, anywhere \"I am the\nLord thy God.\" That's not shown.\nMR. SEKULOW: No, the words on the Court's\nfrieze are \"steal,\" \"murder,\" \"adultery\" in Hebrew.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. SEKULOW: Very different in that\ncontext. But as far as the actual language of what's\ngoing on within the park itself, Justice Ginsburg, this\nis not a monument standing alone. There are 15 other\ndisplays in this Pioneer Park. It's called --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is this a challenge to the\nTen Commandments monument?\nMR. SEKULOW: It's not. This is not an\nEstablishment Clause case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought this case did not\ninvolve an Establishment Clause challenge. Why are we\n--\nMR. SEKULOW: There is no Establishment\nClause. It's not a basis upon which the injunction was\nsought, and the Tenth Circuit specifically held it was\nwaived.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Sekulow, can I just\nask: At what point in the litigation did you first\nraise the Government speech argument?\nMR. SEKULOW: At the Tenth Circuit. The\nTenth Circuit, the existing law in the Tenth Circuit in\nthe Summum line of cases mandated a private speech\ndetermination, even if the speech was controlled or\nknown by the Government, if it originated with a third\nparty. As soon as we were before -- and under Tenth\nCircuit rules that's binding, of course, on the district\ncourt and on the panel.\nBut even in the panel brief, we raise the\nissue of Government speech and the Court addressed it\nboth as to -- and, Justice Kennedy, going back to your\npoint -- both as to Government speech and to the speech\nselection cases of Forbes, Finley, and American Library\nAssociation. And I think that those cases as well point\nto what's at issue here. Governments in the business of\ngoverning and determining the parks and the landscape of\nthe parks make these kind of decisions.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't the tough -- isn't\nthe tough issue here not so much whether there is\nGovernment speech. I will assume and I do indeed assume\nthat there is. Isn't the tough issue here the claim\nthat there is -- is in fact a mixture, that it is both\nGovernment and private. And the argument for its\ncontinuing to be private speech I take it is simply the\nEagles identification with the presentation and their\nespousal of what the monument says. How -- how do you\nthink we ought to deal with the mixture issue.\nMR. SEKULOW: Well, I think the fact that it\noriginated, that the monument originated by the Eagles\nas a third party, doesn't in any way take away from the\nfact that in this particular case, and in most cases\ninvolving donated monuments, which, as the United States\nwould point to, most of the monuments in parks are\ndonated by or originated with third parties --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: They probably are, but most\nof them -- and you correct me if I'm wrong here. But I\ndon't suppose that most of them -- most of them contain\nas part of -- in a prominent place in the monument\nitself contain the statement that, you know, this is the\ngift of or the position of or what-not of X, Y or Z,\nwhereas this monument does.\nMR. SEKULOW: Most of them, Justice Souter,\ndo actually have statements. In fact, a perfect example\nwould be at Gettysburg National Military Park a number\nof those monuments, most of them, are donated by or\noriginated by third parties. They'll often say \"Donated\nby,\" for instance, \"the Father Corby --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We may have more cases\ncoming.\nMR. SEKULOW: I hope not.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But tell me, what is the\ncriterion that we should use to decide what the\nsignificance of the private identification is?\nMR. SEKULOW: I think the key should be, as\nthis Court alluded to in Johanns, the issue of control,\nwho controls the message ultimately here. And the fact\nis the Statue of Liberty originated by the\nFranco-American Union -- was originated by a third\nparty. The United States by resolution accepted it. At\nthat point title transfer.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If that -- if we accept\nthat there is Government speech, I think Justice\nSouter's question is isn't this really the Government\nendorsement of the Eagles' message? I mean, the Eagles\nare all over this monument, their symbol of the eagle,\nand the Eagles want it to be known that this is their\nmonument. Indeed, I think in Van Orden wasn't the -- in\nthe district court there, wasn't the statement, well,\nthis -- Texas did this in recognition of the good work\nthat the Eagles do in preventing -- - help try to\nprevent juvenile delinquency.\nMR. SEKULOW: Right. And I think that\nactually points to why that once it's controlled and\nowned by the Government the fact that it originated in\nthe third party, Justice Ginsburg, changes the equation\nfor ownership and control to the Government.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if it does, it\nchanges it, as I understand your answer, by eliminating\nthe private aspect of the speech. So that your real\nanswer to me is it's not a mixture.\nMR. SEKULOW: It's not.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And there ceases to be a\nmixture the moment the Government accepts it.\nMR. SEKULOW: Once -- right, title, and\ninterest vest under Utah law in the Pleasant Grove City\nupon acceptance and at that point it is owned and\ncontrolled by the city. And the fact that it was\noriginally created -- and Justice Ginsburg, you're\ncorrect, the district court and also the court of\nappeals in Van Orden stated that it was originated as a\nmoral guidance for youth. That was the reason that the\nFraternal Order of Eagles developed. The State of Texas\nsaid: We're going to honor the Eagles. That was their\nreason, as well as showing the role of the Ten\nCommandments and the rule of law. And then the Third --\nexcuse me, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Can I ask you question\nthat's kind of in the background of the case?\nMR. SEKULOW: Sure.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Assume you didn't have the\npolicy that you do have, but it was perfectly clear that\nthe city decided not to put up this monument because it\ndisagreed with the message of the monument. Whether you\ncall it Government speech or private speech, would that\nbe permissible?\nMR. SEKULOW: It wouldn't be a First\nAmendment free speech claim. It might raise an\nestablishment clause, an equal protection kind of clause\nanalysis case, but not under the basis upon which\nRespondents have sought here. I think that's important\nto point out. The basis upon which they sought access,\nin you will, is a species of an equal access claim. But\nof course our position is the Government hasn't\nestablished anything by accepting the monument.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But, Justice Stevens's\nquestion is important, maybe not for your case but for\nother cases. We are deciding this for other cases to\narise, and why isn't he correct that if you don't like\nthe message then that raises a content-based claim?\nMR. SEKULOW: Because if the Government is\nspeaking, if it's the Government's message, they're of\ncourse allowed to engage in content-based statements.\nThe Statute of Liberty was a statement of liberty\nenlightening the world. I could give a list of\nmonuments that do that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I understand that.\nMR. SEKULOW: That's what they did.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But it doesn't seem to me\nthat you have to make the Government speech argument for\nyou to make the argument that you just made.\nMR. SEKULOW: No, not necessarily, because\neven under the speech selection cases -- I mean, that's\ncorrect -- Governments make determinations of what they\nare going to put in their parks to communicate a\nmessage. That's very different from a situation I think\nwhere the Tenth Circuit panel was incorrect and\nRespondents are incorrect: They confuse the issue of\nthe Government actually creating a forum or a venue for\nspeech -- and a perfect example of that would be here,\nwith ownership and control vesting in the city. Very\ndifferent in that situation than the typical equal\naccess case, where the Government merely opens up its\nfacilities for a variety of viewpoints, Justice Stevens,\nand then cannot engage in content-based or\nviewpoint-based --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So the city, in effect, if\nthe city says, we are going to have a designated\nten-acre field in which anybody can put up a monument,\nbut you can't because we don't like your message,\nthere's a First Amendment problem. But if the city\nhides the ball in effect and says in effect, we'll --\nwe'll let monuments be placed on -- we will accept\nmonuments from people who want to place them on our\nproperty if the monuments have some kind of an arguable\nhistorical connection or a connection with people with\nlong association with the community, as long as they\nhave that sort of criterion in mind then they can select\nany way they want to?\nMR. SEKULOW: Justice Souter, there is a\nfundamental difference between opening up a forum,\ntaking acres of a park and saying everybody gets to go\nin, and another situation where the Government is\nclearly controlling it not for a subversive reason. And\nI think the evidence in these cases, in these series of\ncases, pointing to Justice Kennedy's concern about what\ndoes it mean for future cases, here it is\nuncontroverted: The basis upon which the preliminary\ninjunction ultimately was issued by the Tenth Circuit\ndisregarded or at least cast doubt on the declaration of\nthe park administrator, who had been involved in city\ngovernment since 1972, who stated -- and it can be found\non pages 102 through 104 of the joint appendix -- that\nit's been the practice of Pleasant Grove City for three\ndecades to accept displays only in their particular case\nrelated to the history of the community, its pioneer\nhistory. -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It goes to the same thing,\ndoesn't it? I mean, whether it's the Government stating\nthe message or whether it's the Government creating a\nlimited public forum for the presentation of only those\nmessages that it thinks are important, it comes to the\nsame thing, doesn't it?\nMR. SEKULOW: Well, it depends on -- if it's\na limited public forum, certainly limited public forums\ncan be based on subject matter and speaker identity.\nThis Court said that, said that consistently, Cornelius\nand Perry. So in that context, and now that limited\npublic forum appears to be more of a non-public forum\ntype of analysis, certainly. Even in the designated\npublic forum, it could be limited in that regard.\nI think that points to the confusion of what\ntook place here. The Court in our view conflated those\ntwo issues, the issue of forum and Government speech.\nAnd while they're both separate basis upon which we\nbelieve the Tenth Circuit opinion could be reversed and\nvacate the issuance of the injunction, the reality is\nthat in this particular case once title passed and\ncontrol vested in Pleasant Grove City they were the\nowner and effectively controlled. And, Mr. Chief\nJustice, that does not mean that they violate the\nEstablishment Clause simply because they own and control\na monument.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you a question\nto make sure I understand your position. It would have\nbeen permissible for the city to say, our park it filled\nwith monuments and we are only going to let those in who\nconvey messages that we agree with?\nMR. SEKULOW: If the policy is --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If that's a policy.\nMR. SEKULOW: If the policy is that we're\nonly going -- that the Government's controlling those\nmessages, it's not individual private expression, of\ncourse. If it's individual private -- if the\nGovernment, on the other hand, were to say --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But really, in this case\nsort of the debate as to whether the policy\njustifications for the monument are a sham are not are\nreally irrelevant?\nMR. SEKULOW: From a legal standpoint on\nGovernment speech, it's irrelevant. On the factual --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Even if it's a Government\nforum for private speech, I think it's the same thing.\nYou're defining -- you define the forum to include only\nthose -- the forum is putting up monuments. You just\nput up those monuments that agree with the message.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And the same question\nJustice Stevens had, just to tack onto his question\nhere, your answer was: Oh, well, the Government owns\nit. Suppose the Government says: We will accept\nownership only if we agree with the message. That just\nputs his question. I think the ownership argument is --\nis not an answer to the Justice's question.\nMR. SEKULOW: It's not ownership, Justice\nKennedy, in and of itself. Ownership is an indicator, a\nfactor for control, but it is control of the message.\nWhen the Government implanted that monument donated by\nthe Fraternal Order of Eagles, they were sending a\nmessage. It was not a message of \"I am the lord thy\nGod\" --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Nothing could be a more\nobvious control of the message than the criterion that\nsays we will decide in -- in determining to accept it or\nnot, we will decide on the basis of whether we agree\nwith the message. That is control with a vengeance.\nMR. SEKULOW: The difference is -- the\ndifference between each of those cases and the case here\nis the Fraternal Order of Eagles surrendered control of\ntheir message and their speech. In the typical equal\naccess case, Justice Stevens, they do not.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, they -- they do in\nthe example Justice Kennedy just raised and the example\nthat I just raised. The Eagles come along say: Here's\nthe monument; take it; it's all yours.\nMR. SEKULOW: Which happened here.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And the -- the Government\nsays: Okay, we'll take the Eagles monument. We will\nnot on identical terms take the Summum monument because\nwe disagree with the message. At the point they make\nthe decision they don't own anything. What they are\ndoing is controlling, in your words, and they are\ncontrolling on the basis of agreement with the message.\nWhy isn't that a First Amendment violation?\nMR. SEKULOW: It's not a First Amendment\nviolation because the Government takes ownership and\ncontrol at the time it's displayed, and there is no\ndispute at the time it's displayed that the Government\nis conveying a message.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But we've got -- we've got\nto shut our eyes to the period prior to the moment title\npasses.\nMR. SEKULOW: Absolutely not, because\ndiscovery in this case proves the fact that this has\nbeen a policy in existence for three decades. And the\nfact of the matter is under that analysis --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Does that mean if we engage\nin viewpoint discrimination for three decades, we are\nhome free?\nMR. SEKULOW: If the Government is the\nspeaker, they are certainly entitled to do that. If\nthey are not, that would be a very different scenario.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It wouldn't be a speaker on\nyour view until it takes control of the monument.\nMR. SEKULOW: But the Government -- the\nspeech selection itself is an independent basis under\nForbes, Finley, and American Library Association to\nbring these kind of --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But those are cases in\nwhich, to begin with, the Government is engaging in -- a\nprocess of, in effect, sponsoring speech. And here we\n-- we have not, I think, reached the point in which the\npublic park is to be analogized either with a\npublication or a magazine or -- or grants to -- to the\narts.\nMR. SEKULOW: I think, when it comes to the\nissue of selecting monuments for its park, it's very\nsimilar to a museum curator or the arts.\nMr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve the\nremainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Sekulow.\nMr. Joseffer.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL JOSEFFER\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. JOSEFFER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nOf course the Government can select the\ncontent and viewpoint of monuments on the National Mall\nand in other public parks across the country. The\nVietnam Veterans Memorial did not open us up to a Viet\nCong memorial. When the Martin Luther King Memorial is\ncompleted on the mall, it will not have to be offset by\na monument to the man who shot Dr. King.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Can't there be a situation\nwhere the Government does create a monument that is a --\na limited public forum? Let's take the example that you\njust gave, the Vietnam War Memorial. I presume the\nGovernment could not refuse to have the names of certain\ndeceased soldiers on that monument because it disagreed\nwith certain ideas that they had espoused at one point\nor another.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, if -- when it is\nGovernment speech -- for example, we can have a -- a\nWashington Monument and a Jefferson Memorial without an\nAdams one. I mean, we do get to decide who we want to\nmemorialize on the mall because it's Government speech.\nBut there are also -- there are two legal\ntheories here. The first is that this is Government\nspeech. The second is that this -- even if it was\nprivate speech, this would be one of those unusual\ncontexts like public broadcasting, museums, libraries,\nwhere normal forum principles do not apply because the\nGovernment is acting as a curator and value judgments\nare, therefore, both inevitable and appropriate.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What's the answer to\nJustice Alito's question?\nMR. JOSEFFER: I mean, if we wanted --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, supposing the\nGovernment in the Vietnam Memorial decided not to put up\nthe names of any homosexual soldiers. Would that be\npermissible?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Yes. When the -- when the\nGovernment is speaking, it can choose who to memorialize\nand who not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That seems to be the\nproblem here. And what I have in this is the -- the\nproblem I have is that we seem to be applying these\nsubcategories in a very absolute way. Why can't we call\nthis what it is -- it's a mixture of private speech with\nGovernment decisionmaking -- and ask the question, as we\ndo in election cases, is the restriction proportionate\nto a legitimate objective? I know how you're going to\nanswer that question. You're going to say: Of course,\nit is.\nBut what's interesting me is, are we bound\nin these cases to apply what I think of as an artificial\nkind of conceptual framework or are we free to ask what\nseems to me to be at the heart of the matter? The\nanswer to Justice Stevens's hypothetically is: Of\ncourse the Government can't do that because it's\ndisproportionate.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I didn't get the answer.\nDid you --\nMR. JOSEFFER: Yes, the Government can\nchoose to memorialize who it wants on the mall. When\nthe Government is -- now, to be clear, that's under the\nFree Speech Clause.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what is the answer to\nthe -- what is the answer to Justice Stevens's\nhypothetical? What is the answer to the homosexual\nhypothetical? What is the answer?\nMR. JOSEFFER: The only question --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because that tests the\ntheory.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, as a matter of the Free\nSpeech Clause, there are no limits on the Government's\nability to speak freely. Under the Equal Protection\nClause, the Establishment Clause, perhaps the Due\nProcess Clause, there might be thought to be independent\nchecks on the Government's speech. But the Free Speech\nClause, whatever else it does, does not prevent the\nGovernment from speaking freely.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me the\nGovernment could disfavor homosexuality just as it could\ndisfavor abortion, just as it can disfavor a number of\nother things that in -- in many States people are free\nto do. The Government can disfavor all of it, can't it?\nMR. JOSEFFER: The Government would be\npowerless to do anything if it cannot first formulate\nand then express its own viewpoints.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why is that the answer to\nthe -- the question? Why isn't the answer to the\nquestion that monuments generally are not -- the\nerection of monuments generally are not a forum? There\nis a fundamental difference between the speaker's corner\nin the park where anybody can speak and a permanent\nmonument that takes up space, presumably limited public\nspace.\nAnd if you have the unusual situation where\nyou are have a monument that is really analogous to a\nforum, then the forum analysis would be applicable. But\nto apply it to something like the Washington Monument or\nthe Jefferson Memorial is ridiculous.\nMR. JOSEFFER: When the -- when the\nGovernment -- and this is a point I started on earlier.\nWhen the Government is acting as a curator as in the\nmuseum context, normal forum principles do not apply.\nIn Forbes, for example, this Court held that\nwhen the Government acts as a public broadcaster it\nnormally can engage in viewpoint discrimination outside\nof an exception for candidate debates. And the -- and\nthe same point applies here to monuments, I think, for a\ncombination of three reasons.\nFirst, the Government has an overwhelming\ninterest as a property owner in not being saddled with\nstructures it does not want; second, the limits on the\navailability of public space you refer to; and, third,\nthe Government's sovereign interest in using monuments\non its own property to tell its own story, as the\nFederal Government has done here on the Mall.\nIt's similar to, for example, a sculpture\ngarden or -- and -- a sculpture garden where the\nGovernment can choose what sculptures to put in the\nsculpture garden without necessarily having some\noverriding theme or overriding reason.\nIf I could give two examples of that, in\nMeridian Hill Park here in Northwest D.C., between 15th\nand 16th streets, the Government chose to accept and\nplace a variety of privately donated structures that\nhave no evident connection to one another. They cover\npeople as diverse as Joan of Arc, President Buchanan --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But suppose they only\naccept Democrats who are sculptors, and they reject all\nthe Republicans?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Right. As a matter of policy\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, what in the First\nAmendment -- are you saying the First Amendment would\nnot stop that?\nMR. JOSEFFER: The Free Speech Clause on its\nown force does not prevent the Government from speaking\nfreely. But as a matter of rational basis review under\nthe Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, It is hard to see\nhow the Government would have a legitimate governmental\ninterest in pure partisan activity.\nBut the Free Speech Clause, what it does is\nthat it -- it limits the extent to which the Government\ncan regulate other people's speech.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, under the Equal\nProtection Clause would -- if you wrote an Equal\nProtection Clause opinion, you would end up saying it's\ncontent-based. That's the First Amendment.\nMR. JOSEFFER: If it's Government speech,\nthough --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I don't think that\ncan you avoid the hard part by saying, oh, other\namendments of the Constitution might apply. The heart\nof the question is whether the Government may\ndiscriminate based on content, and that's a First\nAmendment question.\nMR. JOSEFFER: But when the Government is\nspeaking or when the Government is acting as a curator\nas with a museum or a sculpture garden or a library or\nhere, the Government is absolutely entitled to make both\ncontent and viewpoint-based distinctions. Otherwise,\nyou get the absurd result --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not only absolutely\nentitled, it has to do so. It -- it has no choice, does\nit?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Right. If we -- if we\ncouldn't formulate and express viewpoints, I would be\nhere today in support of neither party. And the\nGovernment, frankly, would be prevented from doing much\nof anything.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You can't run a museum if\nyou have to accept everything, right?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Yes. Now, yes -- I mean --\nyes, if it's just the simple point that we can do\ncontent and viewpoint discrimination in this context.\nAnd Forbes recognized that when the Government -- even\nif it's private speech, Forbes recognizes that as a\ncurator we can do this. An example, though, of the\nquestion --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the law always\nrequire us to adopt an all-or-nothing position? Aren't\nthere some extreme cases indicated by the hypothetical\nwhere the First Amendment does enter in? Do we have to\ndecide this case that it's all or nothing?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Of course, the Court could\nput limits on its holding if it so desired.\nBut if I could address the, sort of the\nhybrid speech which seems to worry some people. The\nVietnam Veterans Memorial is a great example. People\nare permitted there to put private objects next to the\nwall. That's clearly authorized speech. It's\nauthorized public speech. But at the end of the day,\nthe Government comes around, takes it away, puts the\nnonperishable objects in a Government warehouse, and\nthen decides which of them to display in the\nSmithsonian's American History Museum.\nSo what starts off as public speech -- or as\nprivate speech, clearly becomes Government speech when\nthe Government assumes control over it. It's the same\nas the Government putting a painting --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It would be -- the\ntrouble --\nMR. JOSEFFER: -- in a Government museum.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I see your point, but the\ntrouble with that as an argument here is the private\npart of the speech is just as much chiseled in stone as\nthe public part. So it's not going to go away at the\nend of the day, and there isn't any way that the\nGovernment in effect can engage in the gesture of saying\nall private speech is treated the same way, whatever way\nthat might be. So we've got a -- we've got a -- we've\ngot a more difficult problem here.\nMR. JOSEFFER: But if the Government -- take\na museum. The Government could choose or not choose to\nput, say, a Gilbert Stuart painting that has a favorable\nportrayal of a former president on display. The\nGovernment didn't paint it. It has Gilbert Stuart's\nname all over it. But when the Government chooses to\nput that in a -- in a display, it's the Government that\nis speaking, and the Government, therefore, has an\nabsolute right to decide its own speech. That should\nbecome --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What you are, in effect,\nsaying -- and this may be -- I don't mean I think this\nis necessarily the wrong answer -- but you're, in\neffect, saying, yes, you can find instances of\nGovernment speech in which there is clearly a -- a\nprivate identification consistent with it, but the only\nappropriate analysis is the analysis for government\nspeech. You can't have it both ways, you've got to pick\none or the other; and it is -- it is the Government\naspect which controls the First Amendment purposes.\nThat, I take it, is your answer?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Yes. And when we are talking\nabout physical objects that constitute the speech,\nthat's oftentimes the case in museums, sculpture\ngardens, parks across the country. So, frankly, there\nis -- there is nothing even unusual about it. And the\nreason is that all the free speech clause does --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: There is nothing unusual\nabout it, but we haven't had this kind of a challenge\nbefore. So, I -- I guess it still rests on you to say\nwhy should we submerge the private part to the\nGovernment part. There may be a very good reason, but I\nwant to know what your reason is.\nMR. JOSEFFER: It's simply that once the\nGovernment is speaking, it is the one -- it turns on\ncontrol, right? So once the Government takes control of\nsomething, says this is our speech, then it's the\nGovernment speaking. And here, I mean, it does --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, maybe they can't do\nit in museums, either. I mean, yes, we've been doing\nthis for a couple of hundred years, but maybe we've been\nwrong all along and maybe the Government can't run\nmuseums. It's possible, right? It's a brave new world.\nMR. JOSEFFER: And frankly, public parks are\nno less absurd, because we've been doing it in public\nparks for probably at least as long as well. And in\nfact, there are thousands of privately donated monuments\nand sculptures in public parks across the country, and I\nsuspect a great many of them don't have some formal\ndisclaimer on them saying \"I am the United States and I\napprove this message.\" That's not the way that\nGovernment speech has ever been thought to work.\nThe question, though, with Government speech\nturning on control, this is the easy case because we\nhave a physical object that Government has both legal\nand physical custody over. It chooses to display it,\nand then it can do whatever it wants with it. It can\nmove it, modify it, destroy it, drop it to the bottom of\nthe ocean, sell it on eBay. So you'll never get a\nbetter example of control, which this Court held in\nJohanns is the touchstone for Government speech that's\nnot subject to the free speech clause.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Harris.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA HARRIS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. HARRIS: Mr. Chief Justice, may it\nplease the Court:\nThe city here gave the Eagles access to its\npublic park for s display about the Ten Commandments and\nit denied Summum access for a display about the tenets\nof its faith. That's a violation of the core free\nspeech principle that the Government may not favor one\nmessage over another in a public forum. The Eagles\ndisplay here is not Government speech. The city had\nnothing to do with the Ten Commandments Monument.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You say in a public forum.\nI mean, that sort of begs the question. I mean, that --\nthat encapulates your -- your -- encapsulates your\nanswer. Has the -- has the city allowed anybody to put\nup a monument there willy-nilly?\nI mean, a public forum, as you know, we can\nhave praise in the park, we can have protest. Anybody\ncan do it, so long as you get a license and you're not\ninterfering with some other group. That's a public\nforum. Has this city said anybody can put up a monument\nin this park?\nMS. HARRIS: Justice Scalia, there is a very\nserious factual question in this case about whether the\ncity ever had a bona fide selection policy for this\npark. But putting that to one side for a moment, a\npublic park is a public forum. A monument in a park may\nbe a mode of communication for that forum --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's a public forum for\nsome things. Is it a public forum for everything? It\nmay be a public forum for processions, for parades. But\nit is a public -- is it a public forum for anybody\nconstructing a monument?\nMS. HARRIS: If you look at the question\nthat way, Justice Scalia, it might be said that a public\npark is not a forum for sound trucks, it's not a forum\nfor sleep-ins, it's not a forum for news racks.\nWhat that means is that there is no\nunfettered right to engage in those forms of\ncommunication. But if the Government allows it all --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Those are time, place, and\nmanner regulations, with which we are all familiar. But\nmy concern is that this -- this case is an example of\nthe tyrannies -- of the tyranny of labels. Because it's\na public forum, as Justice Scalia indicated, for\nparades, for protests, which are limited temporally,\nit -- it -- it just seems wooden and rigid to say to all\nof a sudden say, well, it's a public forum for something\nthat will last 30 years for which there is only limited\nspace. It just doesn't make common sense.\nMS. HARRIS: And that is exactly why,\nJustice Kennedy, the city, any city, is permitted to\nmake a decision that it will close its public parks to\nall unattended displays. The Court said that in\nPinette. It said that earlier in Vincent. But Because\nthere --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How far do you push\nthat? I mean, what about the hypotheticals on the other\nside? I mean, you have a Statue of Liberty; do we have\nto have a statue of despotism? Or do we have to put any\npresident who wants to be on Mount Rushmore? How do you\nanswer those?\nMS. HARRIS: Of course not, is how I answer\nthat, Mr. Chief Justice.\nAny city has available to it two very\nstraightforward options for dealing with this question\nif by some happenstance they do have a monument on\npublic land that is not now a Government monument. The\nfirst thing they can do is adopt any existing monuments\nas Government speech converts them.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: How do they do that? What\nis the -- you mentioned that frequently in your brief,\nand I'm not sure what formality you have in mind when\nyou say adopt.\nMS. HARRIS: Governments can do it different\nways, Justice Souter. The way the national Government\ndoes it under the Antiquities Act of 1906 is they\nformally designate pre-existing structures as a monument\nof the United States or a memorial of the United States.\nAnd that, by the way, Mr. Chief Justice, is\nthe response to the Statue of Liberty problem. In 1924\nit was so designated.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, it's frozen into\ntime. Everything up until now is okay, but anything\ngoing forward is not?\nMS. HARRIS: I'm not sure I understand.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought you\nsaid the Government can accept what's there and say\nthat's our speech. But you're challenging the ability\nto do that going forward.\nMS. HARRIS: No. No, Your Honor. If the\nGovernment accepts what's there -- what is there now and\nsays that's ours, then they can say we are not taking --\nwe have closed this forum to private speech, these parks\nare available only to Governmental displays.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The other side says that\nsome of these monuments, especially in the Civil War\nbattlegrounds, do indeed show who the donors are.\nMS. HARRIS: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- Mr. Sekulow says\nthat some of these monuments, notably those in the Civil\nWar battlefields, do show who the donors are.\nNow is that Government speech or private\nspeech?\nMS. HARRIS: It depends if they were\nprivately formulated and handed off to the Government as\na completed object, they are only Government speech if\nthe Government has since then converted them --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So they have to go?\nMS. HARRIS: -- by adopting them. They\ndon't have to go.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now that the Government\nconverted them, it passes a law saying, what, we -- we\nadopt this?\nMS. HARRIS: That has happened.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't it enough that the\nGovernment accepts ownership of it and places it on the\nGovernment's property? Isn't that a manifestation of\nthe Government's adoption of it?\nMS. HARRIS: Let me answer both of your\nquestions, Justice Scalia. The way it does that even if\nthey -- even if a monument makes clear that it was\nprivately formulated, a Government can still adopt it as\nits own speech. It can put --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So this case -- your claim\nwould disappear if this town in Utah had passed an\nordinance saying we adopt the Ten Commandments Monument?\nMS. HARRIS: It would, Justice Souter. We\nwould no longer have an equal access right going\nforward --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that's -- I mean, if\nthat's all that's involved here, we're engaging in kind\nof a -- almost a silly exercise in formality.\nMS. HARRIS: Absolutely not, Justice Souter.\nAnd the reason we know it's not a formality is because\nthe city here refuses to do it. If it were just a\nformality, they would check the box. They won't do\nit --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If we tell them you have\ngot to take the monument down if they don't do it, don't\nyou think they are going to pass that pretty quick?\nMS. HARRIS: I don't think they are, Justice\nSouter. And I think it would be partly a concern about\nestablishment clause exposure, which we already heard\nabout today.\nI think that there are substantive reasons\nwhy they might not want to adopt one version of the Ten\nCommandments as the city's own speech. As it happens,\nthe version of the Ten Commandments on the Eagles\nmonument isn't even the Mormon version of the Ten\nCommandments. That might raise sensitivities in this\ntown. And whenever the Government adopts one version of\nthe exodus account, that is not legally sensitive but\npolitically sensitive as well.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It depends on what you mean\nby adopting one version. If it's adopting the version\nby saying these Ten Commandments are the word of God,\nthat's one thing. If it's adopting it by just saying\nthis is a version of the Ten Commandments that has had a\nvery significant place in the history of the American\npeople.\nMS. HARRIS: I think that those are --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I wouldn't care what\nversion it was if that's all they're doing.\nMS. HARRIS: Those are very different --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Nor would the Mormons in\nUtah, I think.\nMS. HARRIS: Well, those are very different\nfor establishment clause purposes, Justice Scalia. But\nthe only way the Government can be adopting anything in\nthis context is by saying through the act of selection\nwe have adopted it. And the problem with that is that\nthe Government is not allowed to select which private\nspeech it wishes to present to the public in a public\npark.\nIt can do that. It can do that in museums.\nIt can do it in libraries. It can do it --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Let me give you this\nexample. Just by chance yesterday I was taking a walk\nin a little neighborhood park , and I saw that there was\na monument -- a small monument, donated, and it says\nright on there donated by a private neighborhood\nassociation to commemorate a number of people who were\nkilled in the 9-11 attack on the Pentagon. And now if I\nsearched the town records or the county record and I\ndon't find any resolution saying they adopted this\nmonument as their monument, does that mean that if I\nwould like to put up a monument in the park to\ncommemorate loved ones who died, or people who I\nrespect, I have a First Amendment right to do that?\nMS. HARRIS: No, Your Honor, and really for\nthree separate reasons. First of the all, it may be\nthat the Government -- even privately donated monuments\noften involve a great deal of Government involvement at\nthe front end, when they are created. Government often\nworks in partnership with private donors to create the\ncontent of that monument.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well what if the situation\nis a neighborhood association prepared this; they said\nwe'd like to display it in the park; and the county or\nthe town says fine, go ahead and do it?\nMS. HARRIS: Even under those more usual\ncircumstances there would be two things the city could\ndo to keep you out of their park. As I said, they could\nadopt the monument that is there. The other thing any\ncity can do is adopt some kind of a content-neutral ban,\nor a content-neutral limit, on the number of private\ndisplays it wants to have in its park.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Harris, we -- we need a\nclear rule here. We -- we can't expect the courts or\nthe cities for that matter to investigate in every case\nwhat the degree of the Government's involvement in\nthe -- and what is the degree, 50 percent, 45 percent,\n36 years? I mean, we are going to make up a percentage?\nThat's -- that's not the way threshold constitutional\nquestions ought to be resolved or resolvable. We need a\nclear rule that the cities can rely on.\nMS. HARRIS: I agree that we need a clear\nrule, and if clarity is important here the easiest way\nfor the Government to make clear that it has adopted a\nprivately formulated message as its own is to adopt it\nclearly and publicly. It can put up a plaque; it can\ndesignate it a city monument.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is there an historical\nbasis for that, or you just made it up? You think it\nwould be a good idea? I mean, if that had been the\npractice over the past 200 years for all of these\nmonuments that -- that, you know, are strewed across the\nlandscape, then I'd say yes, that's probably what the\ndifference is.\nBut I'm not aware that there is any such --\nsuch requirement and any such practice on the part of\nGovernment. You're -- you're creating a new world.\nMS. HARRIS: I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It may be a very nice world\nbut it happens not to be the world under which our\nConstitution has subjected this country.\nMS. HARRIS: If this is uncommon, that is\nbecause usually the Government does reserve monuments\nfor governmental speech, monuments that it helps to\ncreate or monuments that it is happy to endorse after\nthe fact. If this case is unusual, it's because\nPleasant Grove has done an unusual thing here by\nallowing a private party to erect a permanent monument\nin its park, even though it is not willing to endorse\nthe content of that monument.\nAnd I do want to say that although clear\nrules are necessary, whatever the particular details of\nhow a monument came to be on public land, there are\nthese two clear safe harbors for any city facing that\nproblem. Adopt it now or enact a content-neutral limit\non the number of monuments in the park; and we think the\ncity could do that on a going-forward basis. It could\nsay we have room -- for aesthetic reasons, for space\nconstraint reasons, We would like --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So that's all right, the\nfirst 95 monuments, whoever -- whoever put them up,\nokay? It's a monument to chocolate chip cookies or\nwhatever else, is that it? First 95?\nMS. HARRIS: Sure. A city could say we\nthink --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This is a practical\nsolution to the problem?\nMS. HARRIS: Absolutely, because any city\nconfronting this problem now can look at its park and\nsay we have four monuments --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You're saying the last\ngeneration had much more freedom than the present one?\nMS. HARRIS: I'm saying that as long as it\ndoes it on a content-neutral basis, because it is\ngenuinely concerned about aesthetics, space constraints,\nclutter in its parks, a city can enact a ban or a limit\non the number of displays; and if that has the effect of\ngrandfathering in existing displays --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we go back to -- your\nbasic premise is this is a public forum, in any and all\ninstances; and we do have, certainly in the speech area,\ndemonstration area, from time immemorial public parks\nhave been places where people can speak their minds.\nBut I don't know of any tradition that says people can\ncome to the park with monuments and put them up if they\nwill, so long as they meet the equivalent of time, place\nand manner.\nSo you're making an assumption that from\ntime immemorial, monuments, just like speeches, can be\npresented by anyone who wants to.\nMS. HARRIS: No, Justice Ginsburg.\nMonuments are different from speeches and because\nmonuments are different, the Court has held that unlike\noratory, a city can decide to close its parks entirely\nto all private unattended displays. It could not say,\n\"We've heard enough speeches; no more speeches.\" It can\nsay no private --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If that -- it that is so,\nwhat is the point of using the public forum analysis at\nall?\nMS. HARRIS: Because here the city has not\ndone that. The city has not closed -- it has not made\nthe decision that it will bar all private unattended\ndisplays.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That -- that may mean that\nyou have the foundation for a -- a speech discrimination\nargument --\nMS. HARRIS: That --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- but that would not be\nthe answer if we were dealing with a -- a traditional\npublic forum in -- in the sense that the Court's cases\nhave used the term.\nMS. HARRIS: Oh, I think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So it seems to me that your\nuse of public forum is just by kind of remote analogy\nhere, and I -- I'm not sure that it's helping you or\nwould help us if we used it as criterion for decision.\nMS. HARRIS: Oh, I think it may be helpful,\nJustice Souter, because once we know that we are talking\nabout a public forum, we know that access cannot be\nlimited on a content basis.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, your -- you can\nstick with it as long as you want; that's what the --\nthe Tenth Circuit did, but suppose that we were to say\nthat we were unconvinced by the comparison between\nspeeches and parades on the one hand and monuments on\nthe other, so we did not apply the public forum analogy.\nWould that be the end of your case?\nMS. HARRIS: Oh, no, Justice Kennedy. Even\noutside a public forum, in any context -- even in a\nmuseum or library -- in any context in which the\nGovernment is regulating private speech, it may not act\nin a way that is designed to suppress one particularly\ndisfavored message or view; and we think that's what\nhappened here. As I said earlier --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it does\nall the time. The -- you don't get equal time -- the\ncigarette companies don't get equal time because the\nGovernment says the Surgeon General has determined it is\nbad for your health. It always suppresses alternative\nviewpoints.\nMS. HARRIS: When the Government is speaking\nfor itself, then the Government does have a right to\nprefer certain viewpoints over others, but here the city\nhas consistently refused to adopt the content of this\nmonument as its own, and it is still disclaiming\nendorsement of that monument. The city here -- the\njustification for that Government speech exception is\nthat sometimes, as the United States has said, the\nGovernment is entitled to speak in its own voice to\npromote its own messages, its own policies. But it says\nit's not doing that here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You will say just the\nopposite when you come back here to challenge the Ten\nCommandments monument on -- on Establishment Clause\ngrounds. You will say something like this: Anybody who\ncomes into this park and seeing this monument owned by\nthe Government, on Government land, will think that the\nGovernment is endorsing this message.\nThat's what you will say now.\nMS. HARRIS: Um --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now why would it be true\nthere, but it's not true here? Would anybody think that\non public land owned by the Government the Government\ndisagrees with this message?\nMS. HARRIS: Justice Scalia, for one thing,\nif this case were being litigated under the\nEstablishment Clause, it wouldn't be critical whether\nthe monument were actually Government speech, because\nthe Establishment Clause can be implicated by the\nGovernment's interaction with private speech as well.\nThat said, I do not think it's the case that anybody who\ncame across this monument would know that the Government\nis speaking.\nThe monument says it is presented by the\nEagles. It has the Eagles emblem. The mayor himself\ntestified in his deposition that he thought the monument\nwas owned by the city, because it's the Eagles and not\nthe -- I'm sorry; was owned by the Eagles, because it is\nthe Eagles and not the city that maintains that\nmonument.\nI think there is a very real question about\nwhat people would think here and if those perceptions\nare important the easy way to clarify it is for the city\nto step up and adopt the monument as Government speech,\nwhich it won't do here.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't merely allowing the\nmonument to be built on public property sufficient\nacceptance? If somebody came up to you and said I'd\nlike to put up a monument in your front yard, and you\nsaid sure go ahead, do that, aren't you accepting\nthat -- whatever the monument says, in a sense?\nMS. HARRIS: Your Honor, my front yard is\ndifferent from a public park, and that matters because\nwhen all the Government has done is said sure, go ahead,\nput your monument in our park, that's all the Government\never does when it administers access to a public forum.\nIf it's doing it on a content basis, that's a problem.\nThe Government --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but it doesn't -- it\ndoesn't have to do that, say, for time place and manner\nrestrictions for access to a public forum if it really\nis a public forum. There is something more involved\nhere.\nThis is closer to the case of the individual\nwho says sure, put the McCain sign on -- on my lawn. No\none is going to doubt that the person whose house is\nthere is in favor of McCain; and -- and it seems to me\nwe are in the same situation with the monument in the\ncity.\nMS. HARRIS: Again, I think because it's a\npublic park and because public forums are always used\nfor the expression of -- of ideas that the Government\ndoes not necessarily agree with --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Sure, but when you get the\nmonument --\nMS. HARRIS: -- the perceptions will not be\nclear.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We do not -- there is no\npervasive understanding or non-pervasive one, I would\nhave thought, in the United States that anyone who wants\nto display a message in granite in a public park can put\nit there. No one assumes that. Everyone assumes that,\nif the granite monument is there, the city or whatever\nhas said, yes, we approve it, put it there.\nMS. HARRIS: The city in this case --\neverybody may assume that, and they would be right. The\ncity in this case did say, yes, we approve that monument\nand not that one. So you can put yours up, and you\ncan't. That doesn't solve the First Amendment problem.\nThat is the First Amendment problem that the Government\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It may create the First\nAmendment problem, but it seems to me, going back to\nJustice Alito's question, that the City's decision is a\nclear adoption of the monument.\nMS. HARRIS: If all we have, I think,\nJustice Souter, is that the city has permitted one\nprivate speaker to erect a monument, there is no\nconstitutional or judicially manageable line between\nthat and just the ordinary thing the Government always\ndoes when it grants preferred access to a public forum,\nwhich is to say you're in, you're out. If that's enough\nfor adoption, then there are no more First Amendment\nviolations through lack of equal access.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but even on your own\ncriterion, if the city passes a resolution saying we\nadopt this, you're still -- you're going to be faced\nwith precisely the content discrimination problem that\nyou're arguing about here.\nMS. HARRIS: But because it's adopted it as\nits own message, then we think the Government is\nspeaking. And when the Government is speaking, as the\nUnited States, said it is entitled to make content and\nviewpoint distinctions, but in order to do that, it has\nto step up and speak itself. That's the justification\nfor the Government speech doctrine.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You're basically just\narguing for a clear statement rule. I mean, Justice\nAlito's question, my analogies are suggestive of the\nfact that there is an affirmative Government act of some\nindication of approval when it says, yes, you can put\nthe monument here. And what you're arguing for is,\nwell, we want a clearer statement, we want it to say,\nyes, we really adopt it, it's ours from the heart. And\nthat seems to be the difference between your position\nand the -- and the position that acceptance of the\nmonument is enough.\nMS. HARRIS: I would formulate it only\nslightly differently, which is not so much a clear\nstatement but that those are really two different\nthings, approving it for access and adopting the message\nas the Government's own. And that the differences --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you can --\nMS. HARRIS: -- that would --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You can make that\ndistinction. There's no -- I understand the distinction\nyou're making, but because I don't see that that's a\ndistinction that a reasonable member of the public would\nunderstand to be implied by the -- or at least to be --\nto be raised by the placement of the monument, I don't\nknow why it's a distinction that should be significant\nfor First Amendment purposes.\nMS. HARRIS: If what matters is the public\nperception, then, yes, we do think that to clarify an\nunclear situation like this, where have you a monument\nthat says it's presented by the Eagles, it has the\nEagles emblem, the Eagles are continuing to maintain it\nin the park, and that's a fact we should assume a\nreasonable observer would know, then, yes, be clear.\nThe Government -- there's one way to clarify that, and\nthat's for the Government to adopt it.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And when Government adopts\nit, can it at that time specify what it understands the\nstatement to be?\nMS. HARRIS: I think it can, Justice Alito.\nIt can adopt -- now the Government is speaking, now this\nis the Government's own message, and it can tailor its\nadoption to make clear what message it's adopting.\nAnd in answer to some of Justice Scalia's\nquestions, I think the Government here could put up a\nplaque in front of the Eagles' monument that says\n\"Monument of the City of Pleasant Grove and dedicated to\nthe role that the Ten Commandments play in secular law.\"\nIt can do that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose the resolution of\nadoption by the City Council just says, \"The City\nCouncil agrees that this monument of the Eagle\nAssociation expresses an idea worthy of the public's\nattention.\"\nMS. HARRIS: I think the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that enough?\nMS. HARRIS: No. I think that the ordinance\n-- or the ordinance has to do one more thing, which is\nto -- which is to say, \"This is a monument of the City\nof Pleasant Grove, we adopt the content of the\nmonument,\" not just \"we approve it.\" \"We are giving it\npreferential access, and here is why.\"\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You want a signing\nstatement as well as a signature?\n(Laughter.)\nMS. HARRIS: Like that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it depend on --\ngiven the focus on public perception, does it depend on\nthe content of the speech? In other words, if you came\nacross a monument and it said, \"The Eagles are a lot\nbetter than every other organization, you should give\nmoney to the Eagles,\" someone is going to walk by that\nand say, \"Well, that's probably not the City, that's\nprobably the Eagles.\" But the Eagles, you know, for all\nthe good they do, did not come up with the Ten\nCommandments, and somebody is going to look at that and\nsay, \"That's probably the City.\" They are not going to\nlook at that and immediately say, \"That's what the\nEagles believe.\"\nMS. HARRIS: Well, I think it's actually\ntrickier than that, more complicated than that, Your\nHonor. Again, given this monument, I think there will\nbe questions about whether this is the speech of the\nEagles. And I actually think that, given all the legal\nsensitivities around a Ten Commandments monument, your\naverage citizen, when they see a religious monument in a\npark, may well think that may be private speech because\nthe Government usually can't endorse or at least\nsometimes can't endorse religious speech. So I actually\nthink these questions are very complicated.\nAnd, again, if you want to be clear about\nwho's speaking, there's an easy way to do that, which is\nfor the Government straightforwardly and clearly to\nadopt this speech as its own.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if it's just a statue\nof George Washington? What kind of a resolution does\nthe city council adopt? \"We endorse everything George\nWashington ever said\"?\nMS. HARRIS: No. No. Again, and in my\nanswer to Justice Alito, they can adopt any resolution\nthey want so long as they adopt that statue as a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if --\nMS. HARRIS: -- city memorial.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's right, and I think\nthey would adopt a resolution that says, \"We think\nGeorge Washington is worthy of respect and emulation on\nthe part of our citizens.\"\nMS. HARRIS: And so long as that is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If it could say that, why\ncouldn't it say the same thing about the Ten\nCommandments? \"We think the Ten Commandments are worthy\nof respect and\" -- and I wouldn't say \"emulation\"; I\nwould say \"respect and reverence by our citizens.\"\nMS. HARRIS: So long as --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would that be enough?\nMS. HARRIS: So long as it is preceded by a\nstatement that the city actually adopts the memorial as\nits own, that this is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what that\nmeans.\nMS. HARRIS: -- a Pleasant Grove memorial or\na Pleasant Grove monument.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It has acquired the\nmemorial. The City has acquired property in this\nmemorial and has agreed for this memorial to be placed\nin the city park. Period. \"We believe that the Ten\nCommandments which are embodied in this memorial are\nworthy of respect by the citizens of Pleasant Grove\" --\nis that enough?\nMS. HARRIS: It may be that if the\nGovernment goes on long enough, it will have connoted\nwhat is very important here, which is that it is\nprepared to adopt the content of that monument as its\nown.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what that\nmeans. You keep saying it, and I don't know what it\nmeans.\nMS. HARRIS: It means --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I would have thought\nadopting what I said shows that it is adopting the\ncontent of the monument insofar as the monument says the\nTen Commandments should be respected by the citizens of\nPleasant Grove. Is that enough?\nMS. HARRIS: If the City says --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or it has to say, \"We\nbelieve in the Ten Commandments\"?\nMS. HARRIS: No. No. I understand your\nquestion, Justice Scalia. If the City says what you\njust said, \"We are adopting this monument insofar\" and\nhowever it wants to finish that sentence, that is fine.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't think that's\nfairly implied by the mere fact that it is there in\nPleasant Grove's park and that Pleasant Grove City\nCouncil has allowed it to be constructed there? Don't\nyou think that's implicit?\nMS. HARRIS: No, I don't, Your Honor. I\nthink that all that implies is that Pleasant Grove has\ndecided this speech is worthy of display in this public\npark based on its content. And that is the decision the\nCity can't make. If it were just a formality, if it\nwere simple, and it's all the same, who cares?, then I\nthink that Pleasant Grove would be here saying something\ndifferent, which is, \"We adopt. We adopt. We'll check\nthat box.\" There are substantive reasons why it doesn't\n-- it may be a fine line --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe the City doesn't know\n--\nMS. HARRIS: -- but the City doesn't want to\ncross it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- know what you mean by\n\"We adopt,\" just as I don't know what you mean by \"We\nadopt.\"\nMS. HARRIS: Well, whether or not the City\nknows what we mean, what we know from the City's brief\nis that what it's saying is -- and this is on page 33 of\nits brief -- the Government speech here is only in the\nact of selection. Selection. It's not about the\ncontent of that monument. That's not enough to make a\nGovernment speech, and the City is not permitted to\nspeak through selection, and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What do we do -- is this\nmonument suspiciously similar to the one in Texas? And\nso if the history is the same, you would know that there\nwas -- a big element of this was Cecile B. DeMille\ntrying to promote his movie, The Ten Commandments. So\nhe gave money to the Eagles, and the Eagles put Ten\nCommandments all over because it would be good for the\nmorality of people, and also it would help promote the\nmovie. All right? Is that true -- is that the actual\ndescription here?\nMS. HARRIS: This is part of the same Eagles\nproject --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMS. HARRIS: -- that was --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So -- so if that's the\nhistory of it, what does that mean? I mean, where do we\ngo with that? Then this is in fact partly an attempt to\npromote morality, partly an attempt to be civic, partly\nan attempt to promote a movie. So, what do we do with\nthat?\nMS. HARRIS: It's all a private message, and\nit may be a private message that has many different\nelements, but nothing about that suggests Government\nspeech. And even if all the Government is doing in its\npublic part is promoting one version of the Cecile\nDeMille movie, it can't do that on a content basis.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why not? Why not? Why --\nsuppose that there -- there are certain messages that\nprivate people had like \"eat vitamins\" --\nMS. HARRIS: Uh-huh.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and so they say -- you\nknow, whatever those are; and then somebody comes along\nwith a totally different content, \"ride the roller\ncoaster,\" and they say this part of the park is designed\nto get healthy children, not put children at risk. So\ntherefore we like messages to eat vitamins, and we don't\nwant messages, \"ride the roller coaster.\" This is all\nprivate. It's the -- you know -- now what?\nMS. HARRIS: The problem is that it's a\npublic park, and content --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So in other words, they --\nthe --\nMS. HARRIS: Eating vitamins and roller\ncoasters are not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They can't do either.\nMS. HARRIS: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there any case that says\n-- can they have playgrounds in the park?\nMS. HARRIS: They can have playgrounds, yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay, so we have right in\nthe playground, we have \"eat vitamins,\" \"eat your --\nclean up all your -- all the food in your plate,\" \"don't\nthrow food at your brother,\" okay?\nSo -- I mean --\nMS. HARRIS: Those are private messages.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, all private.\nMS. HARRIS: Uh-huh. Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because there are various\ngroups that feel that's important; the city says yes, it\nis; and we don't want things like pull the dog's tail,\nor --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- whatever. So -- so\nwhat's wrong with that? Where does the First Amendment\nforbid that? You promote -- they want in this corner,\npromoting in the playground good things that they like\nand not bad ones. Where does it permit it? What's the\ncase that says that the Government couldn't do that?\nMS. HARRIS: It's all the cases that say the\nGovernment can't do it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Give one and I'll read it.\nGive me three; I'll read them.\nMS. HARRIS: I'll give you Pinette. The\nGovernment can't make content based decisions in a\npublic forum. And there is not a limit --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But the children's\nplayground isn't the public forum.\nMS. HARRIS: Oh, but the Government -- a\npublic park is a public forum. If the Government wants\nto set aside part of that park -- change the physical\ncharacteristics, change the principal use and bear the\nattendant cost, it can definitely do that. That is in\nfact the answer to the sculpture garden; that's what\nhappened there. The Government waived part of what it\nbeen a public forum; it put up fences; it changed the\nprincipal use; it limited the public access. It is no\nlonger a park. It is now a museum.\nI'm sorry. I misunderstood. The Government\ncan --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I see where you're going.\nThank you.\nMS. HARRIS: Okay.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you taking this line\nbecause you say if the city council votes for it, then\nthe voters can know those people voted to put up the Ten\nCommandments; we don't like that; so we are going to\nvote them out? Is that -- what underlies this notion\nthat it isn't good enough for them to approve the\nplacement of the monument, but it has to be some kind of\nformal declaration?\nMS. HARRIS: What underlies it is that the\nGovernment speech -- the Government speech doctrine is\nan exception to normal First Amendment, and very\nimportant First Amendment constraints. And what\nunderlies the distinction is that that exception is\njustified only when the Government is speaking for\nitself. The Government needs to be able to promote its\nown messages, its own ideas. But if it's not doing\nthat, if it's disclaiming the content of the monument,\nsaying those are not our own ideas, those are not our\nown messages, then there is just no justification for\nallowing it to prefer one form of private speech over\nanother. The justification for allowing that exception\nis missing.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it's not disclaiming it\nhere. The Government isn't disclaiming it. And the\ndifference it seems to me between you and your friends\non the other side is you want this clear statement. You\nwant a statement -- for example if you took Justice\nScalia's statement, that would satisfy you, and it would\nalso be the poison pill in the Establishment Clause.\nIsn't that what's -- I mean, that's okay with me. I\ndon't see that as an illegitimate object. I was a Van\nOrden dissenter -- I mean, but isn't that what is\ndriving this?\nMS. HARRIS: Well, I do think that the --\nthe city is a bit on the horns of a dilemma because it\nwants to have it both ways. It wants to be able to say\nthis speech is governmental for purposes of blocking\nequal access rights; but not so governmental at that\nit's a big Establishment Clause problem. So yes, I\nthink there is a dilemma here for the city.\nThank you, Your Honors.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Sekulow, you have two minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAY A. SEKULOW\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. SEKULOW: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nWith regard to the hypothetical about the\nSenator McCain or President-elect Obama signs, there is\nanother factor that's important here; and that is those\nsigns are created by those -- usually by the campaigns.\nSo the fact that it's created by a third party doesn't\nin any way diminish the speech aspect of an individual\nwho has put that sign in their home. Also with regard\nto the adopt the monument, governments don't adopt\nmonuments; they adopt resolutions that accept monuments.\nThat's the way it worked here; that's the way it works\nin most municipalities. That's this -- the trigger of\nallowing the monument to be displayed. Here there are\ntwo. The city -- it was approached and made a formal\nacceptance, and it was noted later in their minutes as\nwell, so in two different places.\nWith regard to the adoption of the speech\nproblem, Justice Alito, under the hypothetical or -- not\nhypothetical, the factual situation that you talk about,\nunder the Tenth Circuit's theory, the case, in\nRespondent's theory of the case, al-Qaeda sympathizers\ncould come in and say we want to erect a monument\npraising the value of the terrorists, and unless there's\na compelling governmental interest, there would be no\nbasis on which to deny it. That's why the whole public\nforum analysis on this, in our view is absolutely\nincorrect.\nAnd finally on the adopt a speech, there are\nmonuments and memorials that incorporate a variety of\nmessage, including Holocaust memorials, and they will\noften have in place Nazi-era propaganda, the signs from\nthe Nazis that were designed to draw hatred towards\nJews; and they will incorporate those into the monuments\nand the displays. They are not adopting the message of\nthe Nazis; they are showing the history of what took\nplace during an era. That's very, very different.\nThe Statute of Liberty, which was donated to\nthe United States, was from the Franco-American Union, a\nprivate organization. The United States -- and it's\nfound in the appendix to our reply brief -- specifically\naccepted the monument, authorized the president to\naccept and they erected the pedestal. All privately\nfunded in that regard, and it was originated by a third\nparty. The Government was speaking when they erected\nthat monument; the fact that the Antiquities Act came\ninto play, which just means you cannot harm those\nmonuments, it's no different than Pioneer Park, which is\na national historic treasure.\nAnd last point, Mr. Chief Justice, if I man,\nis the reliance on Pinette is misplaced because as this\nCourt said, Pinette is an Establishment Clause case, and\nthe reliance here by the Respondent has been on the Free\nSpeech Clause. We think the Tenth Circuit is wrong,\nboth under the Government speech analysis and under the\nforum approach, and for that reason should be vacated.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
