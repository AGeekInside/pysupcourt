        "content": "(10:00 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Case 09-1156, Matrixx Initiatives\nv. James Siracusano.\nMr. Hacker.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN HACKER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. HACKER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nAll drug companies receive, on an almost\ndaily basis, anecdotal hearsay reports about alleged\nadverse health events following the use of their\nproducts. Those incident reports do not themselves\nestablish any reliable facts about the drug's\nperformance or its safety, especially where, as here,\nthere are only a handful of reports out of millions of\nproducts sold over a 4-year period, and -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hacker, do we know\nthat from this record? I mean, we know that the\nplaintiffs were able to identify -- there's some dispute\nwhether it's 12 or 23, but do you represent that there\nwere no other complaints made? So that, let's say,\nthere has been discovery; now we're just at the pleading\nstage. The company would have said: That's it; we\ndidn't have any more.\nMR. HACKER: All I can speak for is what's\nalleged in the complaint, and the complaint, no matter\nhow read, doesn't allege any more than 23 adverse event\nreports.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But they might have been\nable through discovery to find that there were many\nmore.\nMR. HACKER: That's true, but there's no\nallegation that what they -- what they know about or\nwhat they could find would have been a statistically\nsignificant difference between the rate of reported\nevents and the background of -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But why shouldn't that\ndetermination be deferred until there's discovery, and\nthen we can know how many reports there really were?\nMR. HACKER: Because it's incumbent on a\nplaintiff to come to court with a case, to plead the\nfacts necessary to establish all of the elements of a\nclaim, and a securities fraud claim, of course, requires\nboth materiality and scienter. And neither of those is\nestablished unless the company has knowledge of facts\nestablishing a reliable basis for inferring that the\ndrug itself is the cause of the reported event.\nAbsent information like that, there is\nneither materiality nor scienter under the securities\nlaws, because neither the company nor an investor -\nuntil there's reliable evidence of a causal link between\nthe two products, neither a company -- excuse me, a link\nbetween the product and the event -- neither the company\nnor an investor would have any reason to think that an\nadverse event report is -- actually indicates a problem\nwith the product -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Can there be -\nMR. HACKER: -- as opposed to a coincidence.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Can there be some situations\nin which statistically significant evidence would not be\nnecessary?\nFor example, suppose some very distinguished\nphysicians concluded, based on clinical trials, that\nthere was a connection between a drug and a very serious\nside effect. Could that establish materiality?\nMR. HACKER: Well, I think a distinguished\nphysician would not conclude that there's a connection\nunless the clinical trials reveal a statistically\nsignificant difference between what they've seen and\nwhat they would expect to see were there no association.\nSo there's that point, Your Honor.\nBut the second point I would make is we\nacknowledge there are a very narrow, limited number of\ncircumstances under which a claim can be pled absent\nstatistically significant evidence, but that's -- that's\nbecause doctors and researchers will conclude that there\nmay be causation under narrow circumstances. For\nexample, I think the most common set of criteria are the\nBradford-Hill criteria. But nothing like that is pled\nhere, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Hacker, the complaint\ndid not rely exclusively upon these adverse incidents\nbut also referred to a -- a study, a report by\nresearchers at the American Rhinologic Society -\nMR. HACKER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- which -- which asserted\nthat there was a connection.\nMR. HACKER: But that -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So the -- is the question\nbefore us simply whether in isolation the adverse\nincidents would be enough, or is not the question\nwhether those adverse incidents placed next to this\nstudy would be enough?\nMR. HACKER: Well, two points, Your Honor.\nFirst, the plaintiffs have, throughout this litigation,\nframed their case as one based on the failure to\ndisclose adverse event reports. It's the number of\nadverse event reports that they say is the problem, and\nthey're not saying that there was a study out there and\nthat we failed to disclose the study. They say -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why didn't they say that?\nMR. HACKER: -- it's the fact of the adverse\nevent reports. Well, I think if you look at the -- now,\nto be clear, the study is not attached to the complaint,\nso there wasn't a basis in the complaint for saying the\ncompany was aware of a reliable study, and here are the\ndetails of the study, and they failed to disclose it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I thought the -\nyou're saying the complaint did not refer to the study?\nMR. HACKER: It did refer to it. That's\ntrue. And if you look at the study, there's really\nnothing there. It's based on -- primarily on a case\nstudy of one -- and, again, this isn't in the complaint;\nit's in the -- it is attached to the red brief, Your\nHonor.\nThere's one case study of one man who is 55\nyear old -- 55 years old, which is the population most\nlikely to experience anosmia. You're more likely to get\nit when you're -- he's suffering from signs of lupus,\nwhich causes anosmia, and he's taking Flonase, which\nalso causes anosmia. And so the idea that you can infer\nfrom that one incident out of millions over years of\nproduct sales that -- that Zicam causes anosmia and that\nthere's a problem out there.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're talking about\n-- you're talking about who's right or wrong about the\nconnection between Matrixx and anosmia. But that's not\nthe question. I'm an investor in Matrixx; I worry\nwhether my stock price is going to go down. You can\nhave some psychic come out and say Zicam is going to\ncause a disease, with no support whatsoever, but if it\ncauses the stock to go down 20 percent, it seems to me\nthat's material.\nMR. HACKER: But if -- that's precisely the\npoint, Your Honor. If a psychic came out or a lunatic\non the street corner is barking, you know, through a\nmegaphone that there's a problem with the product,\nthat's not the kind of information a -- a reasonable\ninvestor would rely on.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But wait a minute.\nThese -- these weren't psychics. These were three\nclinical doctors in this area, one of them you knew\npoised to go to a society meeting to make this\nallegation.\nDoesn't it make a difference who the reports\nare coming from and what the substance of those reports\nmay do to your product?\nMR. HACKER: It may make a difference, Your\nHonor, and I didn't mean to suggest that, you know,\nthese are psychics. The point simply is, following up\non the Chief Justice's question, that it does matter\nwhat the basis of the allegation, and is the evidence,\nthe facts available to the company, reliable? Does it\ncreate a reliable inference that a reasonable investor\nwould be concerned about?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose -- suppose\nyou stipulate, in response to the Chief Justice's\nquestion, that it's irrational, that it's probably\nbaseless, but that the market will react adversely. Is\nthere a duty then to address the claim?\nMR. HACKER: Under the case law, it's not\nclear that that's true. In this case, looking at this\ncase specifically, Your Honor, when the market reacted,\nwhat the market was reacting to was a Good Morning\nAmerica report. It's very important to be clear about\nwhat that report said.\nOn Good Morning America, a leading morning\nnews program, the allegation was made by Dr. Jafek that\nZicam causes anosmia. That's a very different\nallegation that what the company was -- than what it was\nthe company was aware of, which was simply the adverse\nevent reports.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But had there -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But if there's a baseless\nreport -- and we stipulate that, although it's baseless,\nit's going to affect the market -- could that be the\nbasis for an allegation, assuming the requisite\nscienter, that there's liability?\nMR. HACKER: Two answers, I would say, Your\nHonor. First of all, we have to be very careful about\ncreating a rule through our interpretation of\nmateriality that would require companies in advance to\ndisclose the fact that a baseless, false allegation\nabout the company is going to come out because it\nrequires the company to ring the bell -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But it's not the\nallegation. It's the fact that the market may be\naffected.\nMR. HACKER: Well, I understand, but the\nproblem is if the-- what the rule would say is, because\nthe company is aware the market may be affected, the\ncompany in advance has to say: A false report about us\nis about to come out. It requires the company to first\nring the bell and then un-ring it in the same statement,\nand that's not a good rule for companies.\nShareholders wouldn't want that rule, to\nrequire companies to denigrate their product and then do\ntheir best to explain why the allegation is untrue.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hacker -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hacker, you just\nsaid, if I understood you correctly, that when the -\nwhen the news came out on Good Morning America, accurate\nor not, there was an obligation to do something about\nit, but among the -- the charges, it's not simply that\nthere was these reports, but it's the way the company\nresponded to them: two press releases that said\nallegations of any linkage of the drug to anosmia are\ncompletely unfounded. That statement was made even\nafter the -- what was it, Dr. Jafek?\nMR. HACKER: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- had this presentation,\nand he was going to put Zicam's name on it, and the\ncompany said you don't have any permission to do that.\nSo the company prevented Good Morning America from\nhappening earlier, and it made these affirmative\nstatements that there's no linkage.\nMR. HACKER: Well, what they said was -- and\nthis was true -- that it was completely unfounded and\nmisleading. The very scientific panel that plaintiffs\nthemselves rely on, which convened and issued its report\n2 weeks later, confirmed that. There was no -- it's\nabsolutely unfounded at the time to -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that the\nscientific report that came out later said we can't say\none way or the other, as opposed to the company saying\nthat any suggestion of linkage is completely unfounded.\nMR. HACKER: And that's correct, there\nisn't, when -- when the scientific panel said you can't\nmake that claim, it's unfounded, there's no basis in the\navailable science.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They didn't say\n\"unfounded.\" They said the evidence is not -- we can't\nsay yes and we can't say no. That's different from\ncompletely unfounded.\nMR. HACKER: Well, I'm -- with respect, Your\nHonor, I'm not entirely sure it is. When you're talking\nabout science, you make a claim that's either supported\nin the science or it's without support. And the point\nthe scientific panel was making is there was no support\nin the available science, and what Jafek was relying on\nwas unreliable. As I just described, the one -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Hacker, you're\nsaying that the question of whether there is support is\nreducible to the question of whether there are\nstatistically significant findings. Now, as I\nunderstand it, the FDA takes action all the time as to\ndrugs -- they force the withdrawal of a drug from the\nmarket, they force relabeling of a drug -- on the basis\nof findings that are not statistically significant.\nNow, clearly in those cases the market has a right to\nknow the very things that are going to make the FDA take\naction against a product and that are going to severely\naffect the product's value to the company. Not\nstatistical significance there.\nMR. HACKER: That's true, but the problem\nwith that sort of standard -- well, first of all, to\nemphasize -- to look at the facts of this case, the FDA\ndidn't take any action until 5 years later, but -- and\nwhich shows that the -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, it could, and\neventually it did.\nMR. HACKER: But that's what -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And you are suggesting a\ntest for what -- what counts as material, which is\nstatistically significant, a test that the FDA itself\ndoesn't use when it thinks about what it should -- what\nit should regulate.\nMR. HACKER: The problem is ex ante. You\nhave to -- you can't look at this through hindsight.\nYou have to look at this ex ante. When a company has a\nhandful of reports -- it's absolutely true, nobody would\ndispute, that some day in the distant future, with the\naccumulation of more data, the FDA may take action based\non its own prophylactic public health regulatory\ndiscretion. But at the time, ex ante, no company, when\nit gets an adverse event report, can possibly know\nwhether that's enough information for the FDA to act.\nSo the prospect that the FDA may some day act on the\nbasis of additionally accumulated information would\nrequire disclosure of all reports all the time, and\nthat, we submit, cannot be the standard.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Hacker, suppose Good\nMorning America made the same claim, categorically\nsaying that this drug caused this condition, but did so\nsimply on the basis of these adverse incidents, and they\ndidn't have Dr. Janner's, or whatever his name is,\nreports, but nonetheless Good Morning America comes out,\nand on the basis of those incidents, saying Zicam causes\nwhatever the condition is. Would that have to be\nreported?\nMR. HACKER: Well -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And if not, why not?\nMR. HACKER: I think what you would have to\nbe hypothesizing is evidence that the company, say a\nweek in advance, knew that Good Morning America was\ngoing to come out and say that, because once Good\nMorning America says it, it's said it and the effect is\nwhat it is.\nBut even in the hypothetical -- you're -\nyou'd have to sort of unpack what you said. If Good\nMorning America came out and said just what Matrixx knew\nat the time -- there are a handful of adverse event\nreports, there's -- it's over millions of product uses\nover a 4-year period, and no indication that that's at\nall in any way different from the incident rate in the\ngeneral population, especially among cold users, who, of\ncourse, are most likely to experience anosmia -- you\nknow, we don't know what would have happened. But then\nyou add the element that Good Morning America then\ndeclares that Zicam causes anosmia -- again, the\nhypothetical would have to be in advance Matrixx is\naware -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right. That's -\nMR. HACKER: -- that the false claim is\ngoing to be made.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Fine.\nMR. HACKER: Right, and I would say, first\nof all, we have to be very careful, as I said before,\nabout a rule that requires a company to disclose false\nfacts. I would say, second, that a reasonable investor\ndoesn't want false information; a reasonable investor\nwants accurate information. And a reasonable investor\nwould actually -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: These are unreasonable\ninvestors who are relying on some talking head on Good\nMorning America who says that this is true -\nMR. HACKER: And that -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- even though it isn't\ntrue.\nMR. HACKER: And that's a third point I\nwould make, Your Honor, is it's a different case, a\nfundamentally different case -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No -\nMR. HACKER: -- if you're talking about a\nmedia splash.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You haven't answered yes or\nno. There's no basis for its being said on Good Morning\nAmerica, but unreasonable investors by the thousands\nrely upon it.\nMR. HACKER: And I think the answer is no,\nand I think that the reason it's no -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No -\nMR. HACKER: -- a qualified no, is because -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Don't -\nMR. HACKER: -- the law doesn't respond to\nirrational, unpredictable, or unreasonable investors.\nIt responds to a reasonable investor who wants\naccurate -- a reasonable investor is going to hold the\nstock -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A reasonable\ninvestor is going to worry about the fact that thousands\nof unreasonable investors are going to dump their\nMatrixx stock.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HACKER: I -- I absolutely -- I\nunderstand that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- but, I mean,\nthere's nothing unreasonable about that. If it looks -\nif you're looking at Good Morning America, you say, my\ngosh, everybody else is going to sell this; I'm going to\nsell, too. And if it turns out you knew about it, you\nshould have told me about it before.\nMR. HACKER: And the point I would make is,\nfirst of all, a company ex ante can't know when that's\ngoing to happen. So all the hypotheticals are\nsuggesting some way of knowing the company -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It may not know, but\nit certainly can know.\nMR. HACKER: And if -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you -- if you\nknow this is a very false report, but we know that, I\ndon't know, the surgeon general, somebody, is going to\ncome out and announce it and that will cause an\neffect -\nMR. HACKER: And that's why it's a\nmeaningfully different case. If the plaintiffs have -\nplead in their complaint that there's a memo inside the\ncompany, for example, so this false fact is going to\ncome out, and we know it's going to cause a stock drop,\nthat would be a case involving the materiality of a\nmedia splash, a big media event.\nIt can't be that there's a false claim out\nthere somewhere and the company becomes aware of the\nfalse claim and then, purely hypothetically, it's\npossible that somebody will make the false claim. It\nbecomes also possible that the media will pick up and\nnot be persuaded to ignore the false claim.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Hacker -\nMR. HACKER: That's the kind of case we're\ntalking about here.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: In most cases we don't know\nwhether the claim is false or not. So let me give you a\nhypothetical: There's a pharmaceutical company and it\ncomes out with its first and only product. It's 100\npercent of the sales, and it's a new contact lens\nsolution. And it sells this product to many, many, many\nhundreds of thousands of people. And most of them use\nthis product with no adverse effect whatsoever, but\nthere are 10 cases where somebody uses this product and\nthey go blind. Three of those 10 cases -- the person\nhad to borrow a contact lens from a friend, only used it\nin the one eye; they go blind only in that one eye.\nThis is not statistically significant.\nThere is no way that anybody would tell that you these\n10 cases are statistically significant. Would you stop\nusing that product, and would a reasonable investor want\nto know about those 10 cases?\nMR. HACKER: I -- I would want to know more\nabout the number of uses and all that, but, no, there\nwouldn't be a basis. A reasonable investor would want\nto know all the facts and details that would establish a\nreason to draw a -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: There are a lot of contact\nlens solutions in the world. So if I heard that, 10\npeople went blind, 3 used it in one eye, 3 went blind in\nthat eye, I'd stop using the product; and if I were\nholding stock in that company, I'd sell the stock.\nMR. HACKER: The problem is -- I mean, there\nhas to be some reliable basis. You may be describing\nfacts that would satisfy the Bradford-Hill criteria, for\nexample, where you can draw a -- a reliable inference\nthat the product is the cause. That's the key here.\nThere has to be -\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So -\nMR. HACKER: -- a reliable basis for\ninferring causation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: This is the same kind of\nquestion, but suppose I don't really know how drug\ncompanies operate. I suspect, but I don't know, that\nwhere you have a serious drug, people are hurt all the\ntime and they blame the drug. So probably drug\ncompanies operate in an environment where they get all\nkinds of complaints and some are valid, some are not;\nwho knows? People are frightened.\nMR. HACKER: Very much so.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, I don't know\nthat. But you say at the beginning your client says:\nLook, we get complaints all the time; you know, just put\nup with it if you buy our stock. Now, I don't know to\nwhat extent that's true. I don't know how that fits in.\nI don't know whether their complaint is unusual or not\nunusual or general.\nWho is supposed to decide that? The judge\nat the complaint stage? Or the judge after you get some\nevidence on it? Or the jury? And the same is true of\nscienter, after all, because the scienter, you see -\nand you have to plead that with particularity. Okay.\nWhat's my -- what's your answer? What's the -- what's\n-- I mean, Justice Kagan has an interesting view of\nthis, and could be, that she's putting forward and\nothers might have a different view. Who is to decide\nthis?\nMR. HACKER: Well, ultimately it's a\nquestion -- it would go all the way to the jury if the\nplaintiffs were able to plead facts in the complaint\nthat entitled them to relief.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, we don't know. You\nsee, what they're saying is we have one respectable\ndoctor, studier, at -- you know, in Colorado. He, by\nthe way, has an abstract which isn't in the complaint,\nwhich says that they do allege that it's zinc that's the\nproblem, a free zinc ion. And they say we also have 25\npeople who were hurt and some burning sensations in\npeople where it didn't rise to that level.\nYou know, I don't know. I don't know if\nthat's within the range of expectation of drug companies\nas part of the normal course of business which investors\nshould know about, and I suspect a district judge\ndoesn't know, either. So how does it work where we in\nfact just don't know whether this does or not arise\nabove the background noise of a drug company?\nMR. HACKER: We think the answer is\nstatistical significance, just like the Second Circuit\nsaid in Carter-Wallace -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no, it can't be. I\nmean, all right -- I'm sorry. I don't mean to take a\nposition yet. But -\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: But, look -- I mean, Albert\nEinstein had the theory of relativity without any\nempirical evidence, okay? So we could get the greatest\ndoctor in the world, and he has dozens of theories, and\nthe theories are very sound, and all that fits in here\nis an allegation he now has learned that it's the free\nzinc ion that counts.\nMR. HACKER: But -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that could be\ndevastating to a drug even though there isn't one person\nyet who has been hurt. So I don't see how we can say -\nMR. HACKER: But -- but -\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- this statistical\nsignificance always works or always doesn't work.\nMR. HACKER: But, Your Honor, out of\nmillions of uses, if there was that problem, you would\n-- it wouldn't be hard to plead a case that says there's\na statistically significant problem -\nJUSTICE BREYER: They did. They said -\nthey said the free zinc ion was -- that word on this was\ntold to your client by a person who knows a lot about\nit, is apparently reputable, and was told to a person\nwho also knows a lot about it. Huh. I think they're\nsaying you ought to have been very nervous at that\npoint. That isn't just a usual background noise, okay?\nSo I'm back to my question, which is -- you can answer\nthe other one too if you like. But, I mean -- but my\nquestion is: Who is supposed to decide, how?\nMR. HACKER: Well, I think a plaintiff -- I\nmean, I may just be repeating myself, but a plaintiff\nhas to plead the facts that would entitle them to relief\nat the end of the day. So, I'm not saying a judge\nalways -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know, and we're back at\nmy question -\nMR. HACKER: And -\nJUSTICE BREYER: The question is: The facts\nthat are pleaded is -- I think it's assumed that this is\nabove the normal background noise -- they certainly\nargue that at length -- that there was this free zinc\nion conversation, that there are 25 people who were\nhurt, and there is a lot of burning sensation going on,\neven though it doesn't rise to the level of people being\nhurt, and that's supported by some of the zinc sulfate\nstudies in the fish -\nMR. HACKER: I think you need -\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- okay? Now, they're\nsaying that's above the background noise, and you say,\nno, it isn't. Now, who decides and how do we decide?\nDon't we have to go to a trial?\nMR. HACKER: The answer is no, Your Honor,\nbecause there's no basis on those pleaded facts for\ninferring that there's actually a problem with the zinc\nion -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know. I know, but\nover -\nMR. HACKER: Look -- look at the allegations\nthat -\nJUSTICE BREYER: We're not saying -- you're\nsaying if you are a scientist -- now we're back to\nJustice Scalia's questions and the others.\nMR. HACKER: But it matters what a scientist\nwould think because it's only then that anybody ex ante,\nagain, remember -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, then what -\nMR. HACKER: -- has a basis for inferring\nthat there's a causal link which will create the\nproblem. And the zinc -- to be very clear, let's -- to\nbe very clear about the zinc studies, the claim made on\nthe telephone wasn't even a claim of causation. It\nsaid, are you aware of the zinc sulfate studies, which,\nof course, is a fundamentally different compound\nthan zinc gluconate.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, because the sulfate -\nyou see in the abstract, which they didn't put in the\ncomplaint, that the problem that they saw arising out of\nthe zinc sulfate studies was the free zinc ion.\nMR. HACKER: No, the zinc sulfate studies\nwere polio related -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I -\nMR. HACKER: -- totally irrelevant. What\nthey cited for the free zinc ions were studies of\ncatfish and turtles.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right -\nMR. HACKER: And nobody thinks, nobody\nthinks, that you can infer anything from a study of\ncatfish and turtles about their smell sensation and\nhuman beings -\nJUSTICE BREYER: The trouble is, you know,\nthe truth is I don't know -\nMR. HACKER: But their -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so I'm back to my\nquestion.\nMR. HACKER: Well, in terms of scienter,\nunder the securities law there has to be a plausible\nbasis, and -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I -- you got\ncert granted on a limited question, and the limited\nquestion was whether, in a complaint that alleges only\nadverse reports, can you prove materiality and scienter\nwithout proving statistical importance. That's the\nquestion presented.\nJustice Kagan started with the point that\nthe FDA doesn't require that. It requires just\nreasonable evidence of a connection, not statistical.\nMany of the amici here have done a wonderful job of\nexplaining why statistical importance can't be a measure\nbecause it depends on the nature of the study at issue.\nSo given all of that -- and even in your\nbrief, in a footnote, you answered the question by\nsaying no, we can't establish that rule as an absolute,\nbecause there are additional factors that could prove\nmateriality and scienter. So you've already answered\nthe question presented.\nAre we down to what Justice Scalia asked\nyou, which is: We've got a \"no\" to the question: Are\nthe facts in this case enough? I don't know why we\nwould have granted cert on that, but you presented a\ndifferent question presented. Given the question\npresented, is the answer no? And if not, why not?\nMR. HACKER: Let me -- let me start with the\npremise of the question presented. It's presented on\nthe facts as the case had been litigated today, trying\nto rely on adverse event reports, which is\nunderstandable. The plaintiffs don't want to have to\nprove all of the other -- you wouldn't think they'd want\nto prove all of the other facts.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I just interrupt a\nsecond?\nMR. HACKER: Sure.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: This wasn't an FDA\napproved drug.\nMR. HACKER: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So there weren't any\nadverse reports in the legal sense of that word.\nMR. HACKER: In the FDA sense, that's true.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In the FDA sense. So\nwe're using a misnomer here to start with.\nMR. HACKER: Well -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Continue.\nMR. HACKER: I would just say that adverse\nevent reports are not limited to what qualifies for the\nFDA, certainly not by the way the case is -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, if I may\ninterject -\nMR. HACKER: -- litigated.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- the FDA acts in the\npublic interest, doesn't it?\nMR. HACKER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And it doesn't make money\nby withdrawing a drug from the market.\nMR. HACKER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: As opposed to somebody who\nsues, who makes money on the lawsuit.\nMR. HACKER: That's true. But there's a\nbroader point about the FDA, which I think is underlying\nyour question and Justice Kagan's question, which is I\ndon't even think it's true that the FDA really requires\nreasonable evidence. They have broad discretion and\nshould have broad discretion. Nobody is contesting\nthat. But the question is, again, ex ante, before you\nknow what the FDA might do, before there's sufficient\nevidence to justify the FDA to act. Remember, the FDA\ndidn't act for 5 years. The FDA didn't act on the basis\nof what Matrixx was aware of at the time, and so that\ncan't be the standard, the idea that the FDA may some\nday act.\nStatistical significance -- the question of\nstatistical significance is presented in this case to\nthe extent the courts below were arguing about and the\nplaintiffs were arguing about whether or not the small\nnumber of raw adverse event reports tell you anything\nmeaningful. The real standard -- the -- the case got\ndeveloped in the briefing here when the plaintiffs came\nback and said, well, there's more to it and there can be\nmore to it, and that, of course, is true, but the\nstandard has to be reliability.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, but you -- you have\nsaid raw adverse event reports. Am I not right that all\nof these reports came from medical doctors, and in\nresponse to the very first one, the company\nrepresentative said, yes, we've been getting reports\nsince 1999?\nMR. HACKER: Well, there's a reference, but\n-- I mean, there's a -- 1999 was the first call from\nDr. Hirsch, who reported one patient. There's a\ndiscussion with Dr. Linschoten about one other patient.\nAnd there were some reports -- nobody is disputing that\nthere were some reports out there.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But my question is, does\nit make a difference if these reports come from medical\nexperts in this particular field?\nMR. HACKER: No, because a doctor doesn't\nhave unique expertise in diagnosing causation. A\ndoctor -- if you have a sore knee, a doctor is qualified\nto tell you -- to diagnose the fact that your sore knee\nis the product of bone cancer. A doctor is not\nqualified to tell you why you got bone cancer, and\nthat's the problem that we have here.\nI'd like to reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Hacker.\nMr. Frederick.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nIn TSC and Basic, this Court reaffirmed the\nlongstanding rule that materiality is judged based on\nthe total mix of information available to investors.\nMatrixx initially sought a major change to this Court's\ncontextual approach to materiality by offering a\nbright-line standard of statistical significance.\nIn its reply brief, Matrixx offer -- offers\na rule that would apply only in the hypothetical\nscenario where investors rely solely on numbers of\nadverse event reports in pleading securities fraud.\nThis Court should reject both arguments in\nthis case. The broad theory has numerous legal and\npolicy flaws. First, the longstanding totality of the\ncircumstances test best comports with the varied reasons\nwhy investors make investment decisions.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose the\nallegations of materiality are based solely on adverse\nevent reports. Suppose that it's alleged that 10\nmillion people during -- during -- during 1 year have\ntaken a particular drug and 5 people, shortly after\ntaking the drug, have developed certain -- have had an\nadverse -- have had -- experienced an adverse event. Is\nthat sufficient to go to a jury?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, probably not\nsufficient to go a jury absent a drop in the stock\nprice, absent evidence that there was a scientifically\nplausible link, absent evidence that the product was\nhighly important to the company's long-term financial\nprospects. All of these things go into the contextual\nmix that investors would regard as important in making\nan investment decision, and they all happen to be\npresent here. We -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If it was the only product\nthey sold, that might be enough -- 5 adverse reports out\nof 10 million? If -- if that's the only product they\nmake, you say, totality of the circumstances, that may\nbe enough?\nMR. FREDERICK: Under the Basic test, Your\nHonor, that very well might if the probability and the\nmagnitude of the harm -- if those five incidents were\ndeaths from a product that was easily substitutable,\nthat might be a relevant decision and information that\ninvestors might want to take into account.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In response to\nJustice Alito, I heard you say something about a\nscientifically plausible link.\nMR. FREDERICK: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That seems to me to\nbe a rather significant concession. In other words,\nyou're saying it's not simply the fact that some psychic\nwould say something, that that is not sufficient, even\nif that has an impact on the market price, that there\nhas to be some scientifically plausible link to the\nreport.\nMR. FREDERICK: I think this goes back to\nJustice Kennedy's question as well, Mr. Chief Justice,\nbecause there could very well be materiality. The\ninformation might be important for investors, but it\ncould very well be that the people making the\ndisclosures don't have the requisite scienter because\nthere is an absence of any plausible relationship.\nThe stock price might drop on news that\nwould not be regarded as news that the most highly\nscientifically rational people would take into account.\nBut that -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I thought this might\ncome up. At some point, do we look at scienter and then\ngo back from that to whether or not it's material, i.e.,\nthe argument would be the company knew that this would\naffect the price, and that's why they didn't disclose\nit, and therefore that shows it's material? Or do we do\nthis with two isolated boxes -- one, materiality; two,\nscienter -- and we don't mix the analyses?\nMR. FREDERICK: They're both analytically\ndistinct and related, Justice Kennedy, and I don't have\na simple answer for you because many of the reported\ncases raise issues of both materiality and scienter.\nWhat the Court has said in Basic is that the test is the\ntotal mix of information and whether that -- under that\ntotal mix, the investor would find that information\nimportant. In Tellabs, the Court said that whether or\nnot the inferences of scienter could be deemed -- were\nas plausible as other inferences based on the mental\nstate of the people making the information.\nSo the Court has announced separate tests.\nIn a case like this, there is a natural overlap, and in\nfact the other side has litigated this case on the basis\nthat no one would have thought within the company, based\non the adverse event reports, that there was a basis for\nthinking there was information.\nWe plead the other way by saying that when\nyou have three medical specialists in three distinct\nperiods where the last wants to bring findings to the\nleading ear, nose, and throat medical society suggesting\nthat, based on studies that go back as far back as the\n1930s, there is a scientifically plausible link based on\nthe zinc ions, that's something that the company should\nhave taken seriously and disclosed to investors.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Frederick, suppose\nyou were the CEO of a pharmaceutical company with a new\ndrug, you've just put it out on the market, and you get\na report back, this drug has caused a death, right?\nThis is your first adverse effect report. Do you have\nto disclose it?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, I guess the first\nthing I would say is, if the drug has not been FDA\napproved, that would be material information that\ninvestors might want to know. If the drug had been FDA\napproved and that report was then submitted to the FDA,\nI think that there's a closer call depending on the, you\nknow, effect of the report that might be on the stock\nprice, because that's the only company product and the\nother factors that we've mentioned in our brief.\nI think the question of one event is\nobviously much more difficult than where there are\nmultiple events submitted by doctors with a\nscientifically plausible basis on a product that's 70\npercent of the company's revenues.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Now, we're told that there\nare hundreds of thousands of these, where for a -- for a\ntypical drug there may be thousands of these adverse\nevent reports in -- in a year, and you're -- basically,\nyou're saying all of those have to be disclosed?\nMR. FREDERICK: Justice Alito, they already\nare all disclosed.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well they -- already. So\nthen why does the company have to make additional\ndisclosure?\nMR. FREDERICK: The -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Analysts who follow the\nstock price can easily look at the FDA Web site and see\nthe adverse event reports that have been reported -\nMR. FREDERICK: Right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- and draw whatever\nconclusions seem to be warranted based on that.\nMR. FREDERICK: That's why I think this case\npresents the issue in a rather artificial way, because\nthe reports here were not the classic FDA-regulated\nadverse event reports. This was a homeopathic drug that\nwas put on the market without FDA approval, and there\nwere no requirements of reports until 2006, which was\nafter the period at issue here.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How would you write -\nlook, I'm asking how do you write this, because what -\nwhere I think where the other side has a point is if -\nwith these -- this is a big class of these kinds of\nthings, you know, vitamins, all kinds of things like\nthat, and if we say that they have to disclose too much,\nwhat will happen is people won't pay attention to it,\nyou know.\nAnd if -- if you have, you know, 4,000 pages\nof small print saying everything that was ever reported,\nwhat really happens in -- in such instances is the\npublic pays no attention, and they think -- and it will\nhide the things that are actually important.\nSo how would you write some words -\nassuming that you're right, that their test is wrong -\nbut how would you write some words that will put a\ndisclosure obligation such that it's not going to be\noverkill and it is going to get incidents that rise\nabove the background noise, and those are the incidents\nthat are -- that would be significant for a reasonable\ninvestor?\nMR. FREDERICK: I would start with the\nlanguage in Basic, which says the total mix of\ninformation is what has, long standing, been the test\nfor materiality under this Court's cases. I would say\nthat where there is credible medical professional\ndescribing the harms based on credible scientific\ntheories to back up the link, a very serious health\neffect risk for product with many substitutes, and the\neffect is on a predominant product line, then the\ncompany ought to disclose that information. I would\nnot -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay, I'll go back and read\nwhat you have just said, and -- I will, because it will\nbe in the transcript, and -- and the -- this case -- I\n-- you are very good, your clients and the lawyers -\nMR. FREDERICK: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- at writing complaints.\nAll right? So they've alleged in this complaint\neverything they can show, and I -- I suspect -- and\nduring the class period. And what it doesn't say is\nthat very helpful chart that you put in the brief, in\nthe pocket. It doesn't say they ever showed that to the\ncompany. All it says is there was a phone call and this\nindividual from -- from Colorado said something, which\nit doesn't specify, about zinc and the -- and the number\nof deaths.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, in 1999, though,\nJustice Breyer, Dr. Hirsch -- and this is outlined at\nparagraph 25 of the complaint -- also said that\nintranasal application of zinc could be problematic, and\nhe specifically asked about how much zinc is put in\nZicam precisely because of his awareness of prior\nstudies going all the way back to the polio period in\nwhich zinc had created a problem of persistent anosmia.\nBut our submission here is that -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How was your -- that\nlong litany of factors that you mentioned a few minutes\nago about how a company will go about determining\nwhether an adverse event report is material or not or\nshould be disclosed or not -- are you saying that\ncompanies don't have to respond to irrational securities\nholders? Are you accepting your adversary's proposition\nthat on some level -- you said credible evidence -- that\nthey don't have to respond to things they judge are not\ncredible?\nMR. FREDERICK: It really depends, Justice\nSotomayor, and I don't mean to be evasive, but if there\nis a product, say, that has some link to satanic\ninfluences, and there is some reason to think that a\nlarge body of followers in an irrational way might\nregard there to be satanic influences on the basis of a\nparticular product, a cautious, reasonably prudent\ninvestor might want to know that on the basis of that\ninformation that most of us would regard as irrational,\nmight affect the stock price.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what protection\nis there at the summary judgment stage in response to\nallegations? Because it doesn't have to be\nscientifically valid; it can be completely irrational.\nAll you have to do is allege that, you know, if you had\ntold this, the price would have gone down. If you had\ntold -- if you had disclosed this, the price would have\ngone down. And the response from the company is, well,\nbut this is just ridiculous; this is some guy in his\ngarage who writes this out on -- on a -- you know, a\npiece of paper in -- in handwriting. And the response\nis going to be, well, let's let the jury sort it out.\nMR. FREDERICK: There are two answers, Mr.\nChief Justice. One is, in Basic itself, the Court\ntalked about the actions of a reasonable investor, and\nthis Court and many courts have always looked at a\nreasonable person standard in making all sorts of these\nfine judgments about the importance of particular\ninformation. But the second answer is -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you just told\nme that it would be enough if somebody says that there's\na satanic, you know, impact on this, because a\nreasonable investor would say there are enough crazy\npeople out there that this is going to affect the price.\nMR. FREDERICK: What I said was if the\nproduct was one that might be, you know, attractive in\nsome way to people who had that particular following. I\nthink you have to link up the product with the nature of\nthe complaint and the effect of the importance of the\ninformation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it matters\nwhether -- I don't know what kind of product has\nparticular satanic susceptibility -\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FREDERICK: Well -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- but I mean, are\nyou saying it matters if it's something that -- that\nSatan's not going to be interested in? I don't\nunderstand.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FREDERICK: You're -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't mean to be\nfacetious, but your way of distinguishing the satanic\nproduct is that it depends on whether people who follow\nsatanic cults are going to be interested or not. I\nmean -\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, Your Honor, there are\npeople who follow those things, and they spend money and\nthey buy stocks, but my second point is that scienter -\nscienter is the other way around this problem, because\neven though information -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know that -- if\nscienter is -- it seems to me ridiculous to -- to hold\ncompanies to -- to irrational standards. And we did -\nand we did say in -- in Basic that it's viewed -\nwhether it would be viewed by the reasonable investor.\nAnd -- and you are saying, well, the reasonable investor\ntakes account of the irrationality. I don't think\nthat's what we meant in -- in Basic.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, Justice Scalia, you\ncan certainly write as a prophylactic here that that\nisn't part of this test. We certainly have here all of\nthe indicia of credible medical professionals on a\ncredible scientific theory on a product that was\nimportant to the company's finances and a very serious\nside effect for a drug that had ready substitutes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So that --\nI'm just trying to get your response to that. You just\ntalked again about credible scientists and all that, and\nyou're putting those other things to one side.\nSo even if you have your satanic problem,\nthat is not enough. And you can sit there and allege it\nwould cause a drop of 30 percent in the stock price, and\nyou should have let this know -- your answer is no, they\ndon't have to let -- they don't have to disclose this\nbecause there is no scientific credible basis for the\nlink that's alleged?\nMR. FREDERICK: Now, I'm saying two things.\nOne is that there's a difference between scienter and\nmateriality. There is importance of information and an\nintent to deceive, and the questions are analytically\ndistinct. In your hypothetical, Mr. Chief Justice, I\nthink you merged them, and I'd like to keep them\nseparate because as we -- as this case comes to the\nCourt, the issue is what is the standard for materiality\nand whether or not statistical significance is the only\nway to -\nJUSTICE ALITO: On materiality -\nMR. FREDERICK: -- materiality.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- can I give you -- because\nI'm having a little difficulty understanding the\nboundaries of the argument that you're making.\nLet me give two hypotheticals, and they both\ninvolve companies that have one product, and this is\ntheir one product. The first one was what I mentioned\nbefore, and I wasn't -- I wasn't clear about your\nanswer. All that's alleged is that a very large number\nof people took the drug and that three people, after\ntaking the drug, within a week developed a certain\nsyndrome. That's the first one. Is that enough for\nmateriality?\nThe second one is that a company receives a\ntelephone call: Hello, I'm a general practitioner from\nwherever, and I treated a patient, and the patient took\nyour medication and shortly after that developed this\nsyndrome, and I think there might be a connection. Is\nthat enough for materiality?\nMR. FREDERICK: On the second one, I would\nsay probably not. And I would say, on the first one,\nthere's not enough information about the side effect and\nwhat the drug is intended to solve.\nI mean, the probability/magnitude test as\narticulated by this Court goes to the probability of the\neffect versus the magnitude that would be perceived by\ninvestors, and those are important factors they go into.\nSo your hypothetical is very difficult to answer as you\nhave framed it.\nJUSTICE ALITO: All right. This drug, let's\nsay it's a drug to relieve the common cold, and the\neffect is loss of the sense of smell. Five million\npeople take it. Three people, after taking it, lose\ntheir sense of smell. Is that enough for materiality by\nitself?\nMR. FREDERICK: It -- by itself, that could\nbe enough, and the reason we know that could be enough,\nJustice Alito, is that when, you know, some score\nadditional were released and this information was\ndisclosed, the stock price went down by 23.8 percent.\nSo reasonable -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, your time\nis running out, and there's one thing that you emphasize\nin your brief -- I haven't heard you say one word about\nit here -- and that is you're saying it's -- this is not\na case of a company that remains silent. The company,\nin response to this, issued press releases in which it\nsaid any suggestion of a linkage is completely\nunfounded. Now, that's something different from there\nare X number of reports. To what extent are you relying\non the affirmative statements that the company made?\nMR. FREDERICK: We're relying on those to\nestablish scienter, both at the beginning of the class\nperiod when they forced Dr. Jafek, through their legal\nthreats, to take Zicam off his poster presentation, and\nthen later when they said that the reports of anosmia\nwere completely unfounded and \"misleading,\" was the word\nthat they used. \"And misleading.\" And they repeated\nthat after the Good Morning America program came on,\nonly to say 3 weeks later, after empaneling a scientific\nexpert panel, that the information was insufficient to\nmake that determination. Our submission is that that is\nenough.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Frederick, I'm -- I'm\nnot clear on why you can draw a distinction between\nmateriality and scienter for purposes of the issue\nbefore us here.\nIf, indeed, satanic effect is enough for\nmateriality, you say, well, it may not be enough for\nscienter. Why? I mean, if the company knows that\nsatanic effect is material, then the company has -\nknowingly withholds it because it thinks satanic effect\nis irrational, why doesn't that company have scienter,\nif it's material?\nThe scienter is withholding something that\nis material, that is known to be material, and once you\nsay that -- you know, that Satan is material, if the\ncompany thinks Satan is involved here, it has to put it\nin its report, no?\nMR. FREDERICK: And it would depend on what\nkind of stock effect occurred.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So there's no difference\nbetween the materiality issue and the scienter issue.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You can't push this problem\noff onto the scienter side of the equation.\nMR. FREDERICK: It depends -- it depends on\nthis Court's application of its known precedent, which\nmy colleague here has not even referenced in his opening\nargument, Basic, which says you look at the total mix of\nthe information. And all of these things go into play.\nIf the -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. I get that. Can I\njust ask you one question in response to -- just picking\nup on the last -- what about the need for a, quote,\n\"strong inference of scienter,\" end quote, and does this\ncomplaint show more than a borderline situation where it\ndoesn't strongly infer that the person intended to\nmislead the defendant? What about that argument?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, we believe, and they\nhaven't argued that this complaint is not sufficient\nunder the PSLRA, which set the heightened pleading\nstandard for scienter that this Court articulated and\nconstrued in the Tellabs decision, so we believe that\nscienter is adequately pleaded here based on -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, page 49 of their\nbrief -- they have two pages on it -- it does not give\nrise to a strong inference of scienter.\nMR. FREDERICK: What I'm saying is that\nthere's already a heightened pleading standard, Justice\nBreyer. I was not -- I misunderstood your question to\nsay, is there some other heightened pleading standard\nother than the one -\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, I mean -- I just\nwant to know why -- if their inference on materiality is\nenough to survive the background noise reply, is it\nenough to show a strong inference that they did do this\nintending to mislead, a strong inference of scienter?\nMR. FREDERICK: The key aspects here are\ntheir treatment of Jafek when Jafek was going to go\npublic with his scientifically linked claim of anosmia\nfrom the Zicam, and then subsequently when they issued\npress releases saying it would be completely unfounded\nand misleading to assert any causal link. That is\nsufficient to establish a strong inference of scienter.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nFrederick.\nMr. Shah.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. SHAH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nFor 35 years, this Court's precedents have\ninstructed that information is material for securities\nfraud purposes if a reasonable investor would have\nviewed it as having meaningfully altered the total mix\nof information. Under the terms of their question\npresented, Petitioners propose to depart from that\ncontextual inquiry in favor of a categorical rule that\ndeems information about an adverse drug effect\nimmaterial absent statistical significance.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Shah, what do you\nthink -\nMR. SHAH: To the extent -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What do you think about\nSatan?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SHAH: Let me try to unpack the satanic\nconnection hypotheticals a little bit.\nNow, to be sure, if someone just called a\ncompany and said, hey, I think you guys are affiliated\nwith satanic practices, surely a company would not have\nto go and disclose that to all the investors. But this\nis going to depend on what the actual reality is and\nwhat the company's statements have been.\nNow, if the company has made a statement\nthat, look, consumer confidence in our products is at an\nall-time high and we expect sales to double in the next\nquarter, and yet they are aware that there -- a consumer\nboycott is being planned by, let's say, 10 percent of\ntheir consumer base premised on the irrational notion\nthat their company is tied to Satan, then certainly, to\ncorrect their affirmative representation that consumer\nconfidence is at an all-time high and that they expect\ntheir sales to double, a reasonable investor would want\nto know that -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They haven't said that.\nThey haven't said our sales are going to double.\nThey're just rocking along at normal sales.\nMR. SHAH: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And they find out that\n10 percent of nutty-nuttys out there are not going to\nbuy their stuff because of Satan. Okay?\nMR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about that?\nMR. SHAH: In that hypothetical, it depends\non what affirmative statements the companies have made.\nUnder the securities law -- and this is an important\npoint that I don't think has come through yet. Under\nthe securities laws, there is no baseline duty to\ndisclose for a manufacturer or a company. A company\ncreates a duty to disclose once they have spoken. So\nit's going to depend on what the company has said.\nNow, in your scenario, if a company has made\nstatements projecting their company's success into the\nnext quarter, for example, and they have a concrete\nbasis to know that, as your hypothetical submits,\n10 percent of their computer -- consumer base is going\nto leave the company's products, that is almost\ncertainly going to be material to an investor, and so,\nyes, they would have to disclose that we have reason to\nbelieve, however ridiculous it is and untrue it is, that\n10 percent of our consumer base has decided to boycott\nour product. That's certainly reasonable.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You would have -\nyou just said they would have a duty to disclose.\nMR. SHAH: Yes, sir.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought you\nearlier just said there's no affirmative duty to\ndisclose; it only is based on what they say.\nMR. SHAH: It's based on what they said.\nSo, for example, if the company had simply remained\nsilent -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMR. SHAH: -- and not said anything about\nits future sales, its prospects, then under the\nsecurities laws there is no duty to disclose. Basic and\nother cases have long made clear that there has to be\nsomething to trigger a duty to disclose. That is, under\nRule 10b-5 it's only statements that are rendered\nmisleading by the omission of a material fact that can\ntrigger liability. If there is no projection about the\ncompany's future success, then it wouldn't have to\ndisclose in that situation.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if the company makes\nthe kind of relatively common statements that were made\nhere, poised for growth in the upcoming season, very\nstrong momentum going into the season, extremely well\npositioned for a successful season?\nMR. SHAH: Sure, Your Honor -\nJUSTICE ALITO: That's -- that triggers the\nduty to disclose the satanic rumors?\nMR. SHAH: In certain cases where there are\nvery generalized statements -- for example, we think our\nproduct will do well -- that may close -- come close to\nthe line of puffery that is a non-actionable statement\nthat no reasonable investor would rely on. Petitioners\nhave never pressed that argument before this Court.\nThere is no dispute about whether the statements that\nMatrixx made in this case are actionable, even though I\nagree with you that some of them probably come close to\nthat puffery line.\nHere, though, we don't just have those\nstatements about the company being well positioned for\nfuture growth. There are additional statements, and\nthese were made to stock analysts that they expected a\n50 percent increase in annual revenues, and, of course,\nthere are the much more affirmative statements that the\ndrug's safety had been well established and that the\nrumor -- the reports of anosmia were completely\nunfounded and misleading. Those statements certainly\ncrossed the line. And as I said before, there hasn't\nbeen an argument in this case as to whether those less\nspecific and arguably puffery-type statements -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So the Government's\nposition is that reports of adverse effects that have no\nscientific basis, so long as they would affect\nirrationally consumers, have to be disclosed, assuming\nthe company has said we're doing well, right?\nMR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, yes, I think it\nwould depend, again, on the statements the company\nmakes. If -- if -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I mean, if Satan\ncomes in, surely lousy science comes in as well, no?\nMR. SHAH: Okay. So -- so, for example,\nif a company had been faced with a potential adverse\neffect and it had assembled a blue-ribbon panel of\nscientists, conclusively determined that there is no\ncausal connection between this purported adverse effect\nand their drug, the question is, would they have to\ndisclose in that circumstance?\nI think if the company had simply made\nstatements relating to the drug safety -- we think our\ndrug is safe; there's no reason to believe that it\ncauses any adverse effects -- then the answer is no,\nbecause the reported adverse effect would not call into\nquestion the accuracy of the company's statements\nrelating to the safety of the drug.\nIf, however, the company had made specific\nstatements relating to consumer demand for its products\nand it knew -- notwithstanding the fact that there was\nno causal connection, it knew or had good reason to\nbelieve that a significant portion of its consumer base\nwould avoid the product, then, yes, a reasonable\ninvestor would want to know that information, and under\nBasic the company would have a duty to disclose that,\neven though unfounded, these reports may lead a\nsignificant percentage of our consumer base to leave the\nproduct.\nI think that falls squarely within the\ndefinition of materiality, which is would a reasonable\ninvestor want to have known that information?\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Shah, what deference do\nyou think that the SEC's understanding of materiality is\nentitled to and why?\nMR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, this Court in\nboth TSC and Basic accorded what it called due deference\nto the SEC's views on the application of the materiality\nstandard. I think it's certainly true -- and -- and\nthose, by the way, were both -- the -- the Court was\ndeferring to the views of the SEC as expressed in amicus\nbriefs to the Court just like in this case.\nI think the SEC is due a significant\ndeference based upon, one, its longstanding historical\npractice in applying the materiality standard, which is\npart of its own rule, Rule 10b-5, and its special\nexpertise in knowing what a reasonable investor would\nwant to know based upon its experience in this area.\nSo, I do think that, to the extent there is any\nambiguity remaining in this case, the Court should defer\nto the SEC's views.\nAnd back to Justice Breyer's questions about\nwhat should the Court write simply beyond reiterating\nthe Basic standard, I think what the Court did in Basic\nwas it not only articulated the general standard, but it\nlaid out some factors. And in laying out those factors,\nthat's where the Court deferred to the SEC's brief. And\nit laid out factors that a reasonable investor might\nfind relevant. In that case, it was the merger context.\nAnd here, on page 28 of our brief, we lay\nout several factors that we think bear on the\nmateriality question in this particular context; that\nis, involving adverse drug information.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there any way\nthat consideration of those factors would support a -- a\nsummary judgment in favor of the pharmaceutical\nmanufacturer, other than the fact of having an extremely\npoor lawyer drafting a complaint? Anytime you have a\nvariety of factors like that -\nMR. SHAH: Sure.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- I think it's very\ndifficult for the judge to say anything other than\nthat's for the jury.\nMR. SHAH: If you mean at the motion to\ndismiss stage, Mr. Chief Justice -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. SHAH: I think there would be some\ncases. And, in fact, we know there are dozens of\n12(b)(6) motions granted in securities fraud cases, and\nlet me lay out a few scenarios for you.\nOne would be in the -- in the scenario where\nthe company has not made any actionable statements. It\nhas either -- statements to predicate a duty to\ndisclose. It either has been made -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, I'm talking\nabout -- I'm talking about materiality. In other\nwords -\nMR. SHAH: Sure.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- based solely on\n-- in other words, you're saying if they say anything\nrelated, it's going to be enough -\nMR. SHAH: Sure.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- whether it's a\nscientific basis or not.\nMR. SHAH: Sure. Two responses to that.\nOne, the PSLRA does have a safe harbor for companies\nonce they make forward-looking statements, that if they\nadd in meaningful cautionary language -- and this is in\nthe PSLRA itself, section 5(c)(1)(A) -- that if they add\nin meaningful cautionary statements, then they cannot be\nsubject to liability. And I think there are a couple\nother scenarios that would -- would trigger, for\nexample, if the product at issue is such a small\npercentage of the company's income or expected growth\nthat no reasonable investor would care if it tanked,\nthen that might be a circumstance where a motion to\ndismiss would be appropriate.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Hacker, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN HACKER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. HACKER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI'd like to return to Justice Kennedy's\nquestion about the role of scienter here, which I think\nabsolutely is critical, as this Court emphasized\nrecently in the Merck v. Reynolds case.\nMr. Frederick correctly, I think, conceded\nthat there has to be a scientifically plausible basis.\nAnd what you're talking about here is a company's\nknowledge of a scientifically plausible basis. And he\nhas to make that concession in this case because of\nwhat's alleged to be the material omission.\nThe material omission is not knowledge of\ndubious scientific -- medical claims. It's not that we\ngot one phone call from a doctor. The real material\nomission is that the adverse event reports told Matrixx\nthat Zicam causes anosmia. That's ultimately the fact\nthat -- that Matrixx supposedly did not disclose. And\nso there has to be a basis for believing that -- there\nhas to be allegation in the complaint that's sufficient\nto establish that Matrixx actually knew that Zicam\ncauses anosmia and yet willfully refused to tell\ninvestors that fact.\nAnd there's nothing in the complaint like\nthat. There's not -- you're not talking about a case\nwhere there was a failure to disclose the doctor's\ncompletely dubious untested claim. It's not a case -\nit's not the Satan case where you're talking about a\nmedia splash, a known fact that there's going to be a\nmajor media splash, and the company knows for a fact\nthat that splash is going to have the adverse effect on\nthe stock. There's not even a claim here -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: As I was hearing the\nSolicitor General's argument, he wasn't actually even\ntalking about causation. He was talking about a\nstatement you made about the company poised to double\nits growth. And I think he was saying that on the basis\nof what you had heard up until that time, you had to\nhave known that that statement was misleading, as was\nthe statement that this drug -- that there was\nabsolutely no proof or connection of causation, which\nwas your scientific panel said you couldn't make that\nextreme statement.\nMR. HACKER: Well, two points, Your Honor.\nFirst, if the claim was about, you know, the consumer\nsales, you would need an allegation in the case that\nconsumer product sales were actually affected. There's\nno allegation like that, and the truth is they weren't.\nAnd so you're not talking about falsifying any prior\nclaim. There's not even an allegation that that\nhappened, Your Honor.\nAnd, second, with respect to the -- the\nstatement, as I was discussing with Justice Ginsburg in\nthe beginning part of the argument, the statement was -\nwhat the scientific panel was addressing primarily was\nJafek's claim that Zicam causes anosmia, and the company\nsaid accurately that that is completely unfounded and\nmisleading because there's no scientific support for it.\nYou can't go out and claim that Zicam causes anosmia\nunless you have a scientific basis for that. And the\nscientific panel was saying that isn't true.\nSo the question is whether you can draw an\ninference of scienter from the fact that -- from what's\nalleged here, and there's simply no basis for an\nallegation, supportable allegation, that the company\nknew it causes anosmia and nevertheless refused to tell\ninvestors that. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nCounsel.\n"
