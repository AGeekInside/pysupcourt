        "content": "(11:12 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in No. 00-1614, the National Railroad Passenger\nCorporation v. Abner Morgan.\nMr. Englert.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY T. ENGLERT, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ENGLERT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\n25 years ago in United Air Lines v. Evans, this\nCourt observed that an employer was entitled to treat a\npast act as lawful after respondent failed to file a\ntimely charge of discrimination. In the Court's words --\nand I quote -- a discriminatory act, which has not made\nthe basis for a timely charge, is the legal equivalent of\na discriminatory act which occurred before the statute was\npassed. The Court further referred to the alleged\ndiscriminatory act outside the limitations period as\nmerely an unfortunate event in history which has no\npresent legal consequences.\nIn the present case, Abner Morgan challenges as\ndiscriminatory various acts that he did not make the basis\nfor an EEOC charge within 300 days. Our contention is\nthat Amtrak was entitled to treat those past acts as\nlawful after the passage of 300 days. Those acts are\nmerely unfortunate events in history with no present legal\nconsequences.\nThe Ninth Circuit saw things quite differently.\nAccording to the Ninth Circuit, all plaintiffs, completely\nwithout regard to their own diligence, may base suit on\nevents they didn't make the basis of a timely charge, as\nlong as those events are sufficiently related to later\nevents that can also be characterized as discrimination.\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. Englert, there are, I\nassume even in your view, a few exceptions to this rule.\nWhen is it that you would look back?\nMR. ENGLERT: For certain diligent plaintiffs --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. ENGLERT: -- who bring suit within 300 days\nafter their cause of action first accrues, we would look\nback. That obviously isn't this case.\nQUESTION: And there's no other circumstance,\nyou think, where you would end up looking back beyond --\nwhere the -- the full thrust of -- of what was going on\ndidn't become evident until the statute had passed as some\nearly -- on some earlier events?\nMR. ENGLERT: We would allow plaintiffs, in\nexactly the situation you described, Justice O'Connor, to\nlook back, the situation in which it was not fully evident\nuntil within the 300-day period what was going on. That\nis the exception we're willing to concede.\nQUESTION: I don't understand how's that's an\nexception. I thought we were talking about the period\nbefore the 300 days. Is there any instance in which you\nwould allow a person to get recovery for something that\nhappened to him prior to 300 days before he filed?\nMR. ENGLERT: Yes, Justice Breyer. If the --\nQUESTION: What is that?\nMR. ENGLERT: -- if the events outside the 300-\nday window were not sufficiently severe or pervasive to\nrise to the level of being actionable, then we would\nconcede that the cause of action doesn't accrue until\nthey've become sufficiently severe or pervasive.\nQUESTION: What about the circumstance where\nthey're very much related to what did occur within the 300\ndays, but the person isn't certain? I mean, later on the\njudge says, yes, it was independently actionable, but I\ncould understand how a person at the time might think it\nwasn't. What about that one?\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, there may be close cases,\nJustice Breyer, and --\nQUESTION: No, no. But I want to know. This --\nthat is the case. A judge would say a reasonable person\nwould not have realized, though he would have been wrong,\nthat those outside-the-period events rose to the level of\ngiving him a cause of action. How would you decide that\ncase?\nMR. ENGLERT: We -- we would give away that\ncase.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. ENGLERT: If a reasonable person would not\nhave known --\nQUESTION: Fine.\nQUESTION: Would not have known his injury. So\n-- so you're saying the test under the act is not injury,\nbut knowledge of injury.\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, Justice Scalia, that gets\ninto the debate, of course, this Court has had --\nQUESTION: I know it does. You're -- you're\ngiving it away. You're saying that under the act,\nknowledge of injury is --\nMR. ENGLERT: No. I -- I'm not trying to give\nthat away. I'm trying not to take a position on that. I\nunderstood Justice Breyer's question to pertain to the\nsituation in which the judge says a reasonable person\nwould not have known, not this particular plaintiff\nwouldn't have known, but a reasonable person would not\nhave known.\nQUESTION: Oh, in practice, that's always an\nexception to the knowledge of injury rule. With due\ndiligence, he didn't know. I mean, but -- but that --\nyou're willing to accept that.\nMR. ENGLERT: That's why I'm not trying to give\naway anything on injury versus injury discovery.\nQUESTION: With due diligence -- with due\ndiligence -- the person had due diligence but didn't know.\nSo, it's a -- it's a knowledge -- it's a knowledge of\ninjury test.\nQUESTION: Not a subjective knowledge of injury\nbut knowledge of injury that -- that would have occurred\nto a reasonable person.\nMR. ENGLERT: Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice, and --\nQUESTION: All right. If you're willing to give\nthat one away, what about a person who, though he might\nhave understood -- a reasonable person might have\nunderstood that this would have been actionable, he's in\nthe middle of negotiations with his company there --\nthere, and it would have been foolish to go to the EEOC.\nMR. ENGLERT: That plaintiff loses.\nQUESTION: I mean, because after all, we're\ntrying to settle this thing right within the company.\nMR. ENGLERT: That plaintiff loses, Justice\nBreyer. That's quite clear.\nQUESTION: He loses.\nMR. ENGLERT: That's quite clear under cases\nlike Robinson Meyers.\nQUESTION: And -- and why should he lose where\nthe other one doesn't?\nMR. ENGLERT: Because this Court has said so.\nCases like Robinson Meyers and Johnson v. --\nQUESTION: Are you talking about EEOC cases?\nMR. ENGLERT: Those -- those are title VII cases\nin which -- Robinson Meyers was a case in which the\nplaintiff exhausted union grievances and then filed the\nEEOC charge, and the Court said, no, you should have filed\nyour EEOC charge within the statutory period.\nQUESTION: Mr. Englert, I'm not aware that there\nis a case -- perhaps I'm wrong about this -- quite like\nthis where there are a succession of similar acts, a\nnumber of disciplines, a number of refusal to give\ntraining opportunities, and the employee goes to the EEO\n-- the in-house person, tries to settle it, tries not to\nmake a Federal case out of it. And -- but the rule that\nyou would have us adopt would say if you're in doubt, sue\ninstead of saying, if you're in doubt -- each one of these\ndiscrete instances that he was trying to work out, we\nwould have to have -- your rule would mean that this\nperson has to file 10 charges with the EEOC instead of\none.\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, it's not when in doubt, sue,\nJustice Ginsburg. It is when in doubt, go to the EEOC,\nand it's an important distinction because the purpose of\nfiling with the EEOC is to start a conciliatory process.\nQUESTION: But he's always -- he also has the\nin-house. He's got a conciliatory process going without\ninvolving the Federal Government. He's just dealing with\nhis employer. His employer has an EEO counselor. That he\ndid. He didn't come to a Federal agency. So, let's take\nit that we're talking about the EEOC and not suing in\ncourt.\nThe EEOC -- one of its objections is you would\nbe breeding tremendous fragmentation here because on every\nincident in a pattern, he'd have to file another EEOC\ncharge. That much you are saying.\nMR. ENGLERT: That much I am saying, and that is\nvery consistent with the purposes of the title VII charge-\nfiling requirement, which is to cause plaintiffs to go\npromptly to the EEOC, as this Court itself has said in a\nnumber of its cases, and to get that process started\nquickly.\nNow, there -- there could be rare cases, Justice\nGinsburg, in which equitable tolling would apply on the\nfacts that you've suggested. This isn't one of them, and\nI don't think there are many such cases. But if one is in\nthe middle of some kind of negotiation and is being misled\ninto thinking that it's all going to work out and\ntherefore don't got to the EEOC, that person might have an\nequitable tolling argument, although as this Court has\nsaid, the virtue of equitable tolling is that it is so\nrarely invoked --\nQUESTION: Well, I guess any statute of\nlimitations of any sort means you -- you have to sue 10\ntimes instead of one time, doesn't it?\nMR. ENGLERT: Yes.\nQUESTION: I mean, it's the nature of a statute\nof limitations that when you're hurt, you have to sue.\nYou can't wait till you're hurt the 10th time and then\nsay, well, you know, let's put it in one big package.\nI'll wait 10 years until I'm hurt -- hurt more often.\nMR. ENGLERT: Yes, Justice Scalia, and --\nQUESTION: Mr. Englert, I don't think that this\nis in any case. I think you have recognized that in the\nso-called hostile atmosphere case, the first epithet, even\nthe second, it's -- it's uncertain when how much is enough\nand when it's insufficient. So, I think you recognize\nthat at least in that category of case, there would have\nto be a succession of similar incidents.\nMR. ENGLERT: Yes. That's part of the\ndefinition of the very violation of title VII in hostile\nenvironment cases.\nQUESTION: In other words, you're -- you're\nsaying that there is no pervasive hostility, no pervasive\nhostile environment until the acts are repeated, or is it\nthere is a pervasive hostile environment, but it's just\nnot discovered until the acts are repeated? Which --\nwhich of the two is it?\nMR. ENGLERT: The case I'm willing to concede,\nlooking back beyond 300 days, is the case in which there\nis no hostile environment until within the 300-day period.\nThe fact that the hostile environment isn't discovered I\nhave not conceded. That -- that case I have not conceded.\nQUESTION: Wait. Now, you say there is no\nhostile -- what are you conceding? That that -- that that\nevidence can be brought in, or that you can get damages\nfor those events?\nMR. ENGLERT: I'm conceding that you can get\nback pay or damages for those events as the Seventh\nCircuit said in Galloway and as the First Circuit said in\nSabree.\nQUESTION: Well, why if -- if you assert that\nthere hasn't been any offense when those events occurred?\nYou say there's not yet a hostile environment. Why should\nyou be able to get any damages for a period during which\nthere as not a hostile environment?\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, the hypothetical example,\nJustice Scalia, that I think makes the point is suppose\nthere is an epithet at the office Christmas party one\nyear. Then there's an epithet at the office Christmas\nparty the next year. Then there's an epithet at the\noffice Christmas party the third year, and the person has\nto seek psychological counseling after each of those.\nIt's not going to rise to the level, in all likelihood, of\na hostile environment after one epithet, but with\nrepetition, it can rise to the level of a hostile\nenvironment.\nQUESTION: Well, sure, but it doesn't make the\nfirst one a hostile environment.\nMR. ENGLERT: No, but the statute of\nlimitations, under standard accrual principles, didn't\nbegin to run until it became a hostile environment, and\nwe're suggesting --\nQUESTION: But if that's the case, you don't\nhave to concede anything because the hostile environment\ndoesn't occur, as you're analyzing it, until -- within the\n300-day period.\nI thought what you meant was that you would\nconcede the -- the case -- you would concede the\napplication of continuing violation when the hostile\nenvironment was not apparent enough to bring a lawsuit\nuntil you get within the 300-day period -- yes, the -- the\nlimitation period.\nMR. ENGLERT: Yes.\nQUESTION: Okay. But you're saying that -- I --\nI thought, in answer to Justice Scalia, you were saying\nthere is no hostile environment prior to the third\nincident, which is within the period.\nMR. ENGLERT: No, I --\nQUESTION: Maybe that isn't what you meant.\nMR. ENGLERT: I think --\nQUESTION: That's how I understood him.\nMR. ENGLERT: Justice Souter -- and I don't know\nthat I want to spend much more of my argument on\nconcessions, but --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ENGLERT: -- I think the -- the point is\nthat the entire series of actions that constitute the\nhostile environment are all part of the hostile\nenvironment, but it may not --\nQUESTION: Okay. Then the hostile environment\ngoes back beyond the 300-day period. You're saying a\nhostile environment began with the first epithet, but you\ndidn't have a -- a sufficiently obvious indication of it\nuntil you got to epithet three.\nMR. ENGLERT: In 20/20 hindsight, this is how\nhostile environment cases work. An epithet that was not a\nhostile environment on day 1 may actually become part of a\nhostile environment on day 300.\nQUESTION: Good. Then change your answer to my\nearlier question because I asked you whether there was a\nhostile environment at the first incident -- incident, and\nyou said no, it -- there was not yet until the last\nincident. You're talking about a different situation\nwhere there's been a hostile environment all along, but it\ndoesn't become apparent until the third incident, but\nthere really was one the first time the epithet was used.\nThat's a different situation, and we got to know which one\nof the two you -- you want us to allow.\nQUESTION: And that was my -- and that was my\nquestion. And I want to know which one you think this\ncase is, and I also want to know can there be both kinds\nof cases and we have to see which applies -- which\ndescription applies in each instance.\nMR. ENGLERT: Okay. In -- in this case, Mr.\nMorgan was complaining to members of Congress starting in\n1991. There is absolutely no doubt that he thought that\nhe was being discriminated against from long before the\nstatute of limitations ran.\nQUESTION: Is this a hostile environment claim,\ndo you think?\nMR. ENGLERT: Not primarily, but there is a\nhostile environment claim in this case as the Ninth\nCircuit saw it.\nQUESTION: It is in the case. Is it a pattern\nand practice case?\nMR. ENGLERT: No, Your Honor. Pattern or\npractice is a term in section 707 of the act, which\napplies exclusively to governmental actions, and the Court\nhas used that phrase in certain class actions as well --\nin private class actions, but this is not a class action\neither.\nQUESTION: But it could be a hostile environment\nclaim included here.\nMR. ENGLERT: The Ninth Circuit believed there\nwas, yes.\nBut in any event, Mr. Morgan was -- was well\naware long before he filed his EEOC charge that he had a\n-- a claim of discrimination. I --\nQUESTION: May I ask you about a hypothetical\nthat's perhaps a little simpler to discuss? Supposing the\ncompany had a policy that was unwritten or secret or\nsomething like that, we will not allow any woman into a\ncertain job category, no woman, no black into a certain\njob category. It's -- it's found out 3 years after the\npolicy was formally described and so forth. And then a\nperson who repeatedly tried to get into that job category\nover the entire 3-year period but was refused each time\nbecause of the existence of a continuing policy, does that\nperson have any right to recover for anything happening\nprior to the 300 days?\nMR. ENGLERT: I think not, Justice Stevens, but\nthat raises two issues that are not in this case. One is\nfraudulent concealment, and the second is the issue of\ninjury versus injury discovery for statutes of\nlimitation --\nQUESTION: I'm assuming there's no discovery,\nbut I'm assuming --\nMR. ENGLERT: No.\nQUESTION: -- if you can ever describe anything\nas a continuing violation, I have described a continuing\ndiscriminatory policy. And if it's clear as a bell that\nit's all one policy and it had a several -- manifested\nitself in several different incidents, is it -- may a\nplaintiff recover for something that happened prior to the\n300-day filing? That's my -- sort of the basic question\nin this case it seems to me.\nMR. ENGLERT: My short answer is no.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. ENGLERT: My longer answer is no unless this\nCourt resolves an issue that is not presented by this case\nwhich is injury versus injury discovery in favor of an\ninjury discovery rule.\nQUESTION: You're saying injury would not be\nenough.\nMR. ENGLERT: That issue is not in this case,\nbut that is my -- I'm saying injury would be enough.\nQUESTION: Well, arguably it would be in this\ncase to the extent the hostile environment claim is a\ncontinuing violation. I don't know whether it is, but\narguably that's -- the hostile environment claim\nconceivably could be a continuing policy also.\nMR. ENGLERT: It could be, but the reason I'm\nmaking a concession with regard to hostile environment\nclaims is not injury versus injury discovery. The reason\nI'm making a concession is because under standard\nprinciples of accrual, the plaintiff may not sue until he\nor she actually has a cause of action. And because a\nhostile environment claim can only develop over time, it\nmay be that not until the third, fourth, fifth epithet,\nincident is -- is there anything for the plaintiff to sue\non.\nQUESTION: Well, my assumption is a case --\nthere was a violation all along, but the -- the charge was\nnot filed within 300 days of the commencement of a\ncontinuing violation. The question I have in the back of\nmy mind is, could there be recovery for the portion of the\ncontinuing violation that was more than 300 days old?\nMR. ENGLERT: There -- no. There can always be\nrecovery for the portion of the continuing violation\nwithin the 300 days.\nQUESTION: Mr. Englert, you have been deflected\nfrom what I think is the strongest point on the other side\nthat said, that's all well and good, but Congress\nunderstood you could go back way beyond the 300 days\nbecause they put a 2-year cap on back pay.\nMR. ENGLERT: Yes.\nQUESTION: So, that shows how, whatever you\nmight say, just looking at the words of the statute,\nCongress understood that you have to shorten the period\nand the period they picked was 2 years, much longer than\n180 days or 300.\nMR. ENGLERT: And let me try very quickly to say\nwhy that argument is not a good argument. Congress did\nworry that there was no time limit on title VII actions\nand it put the 2 years in there. But that's because of\nthe continuing effects doctrine, which this Court\nrepudiated in 1977, and that's because this Court hadn't\nclearly said the title VII statute of limitations is\nsection 706(e) until 1982 in Zipes. Many of the lower\ncourts were actually borrowing State statutes of\nlimitations on the theory that title VII had no statute of\nlimitations of its own. This Court laid that to rest in\nZipes, and now all of the Federal courts of appeals,\nincluding the Ninth Circuit, agree that 706(e) is a\nstatute of limitations.\nIf I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of my\ntime.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Englert.\nMr. Schlick, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF AUSTIN C. SCHLICK\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. SCHLICK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis Court's decision in Zipes established and\nthe Court reaffirmed in Lorance that section 706(e)\noperates as a statute of limitations. The limitations\nperiod begins to run with the occurrence of the alleged\nunlawful employment practice.\nIn this case, respondent could sue on alleged\nviolations that occurred not more than 300 days before he\nfiled his charge with EEOC, but he could not sue on\nalleged violations that occurred earlier and outside the\nlimitations period.\nOur construction of section 706(e) gives effect\nto the balance underlying that provision. On the one\nhand, it ensures that plaintiffs are able to sue and\nrecover for ongoing violations. At the same time, it\nensures that employers will not be liable for violations\nthat -- that occurred long ago.\nQUESTION: When you say ongoing violations and\ntaking my hypothetical, could they recover for damages\nprior to the 300 days?\nMR. SCHLICK: In your hypothetical, Justice\nStevens, recovery would only be available if equitable\ntolling came into play. As -- absent equitable tolling\nbased on -- based on the conceal -- equitable estoppel\nbased on the concealment that you mentioned in your\nhypothetical, recovery would be limited to 300 days.\nQUESTION: In my hypothetical it would be\nlimited to 300 days.\nMR. SCHLICK: Yes, Justice Stevens. The fact\nthat it was continuing would not -- would not affect the\napplication of a 300-day period.\nQUESTION: In a nutshell, where do you think the\nNinth Circuit went wrong, which I take it you believe is\nthe case here?\nMR. SCHLICK: Yes, Justice O'Connor. There were\ntwo categories of claims at issue in this case. The first\nis what Ninth Circuit referred to as serial violations,\nthat is, independently actionable alleged violations of\ntitle VII. And as to -- as to those claims, the Ninth\nCircuit went wrong in holding that violations that\noccurred -- that accrued more than 300 days before the --\nthe charge was filed were actionable.\nThe second claim was a hostile work environment\nclaim. Now, the allegation of the complaint and the\nclaims at trial were that the hostile work environment\nbecame actionable right from the outset of Mr. Morgan's\nemployment with -- with Amtrak. It was actionable\nthroughout the period. Mr. Morgan, however, didn't bring\na charge on that -- on that claim until years later.\nAccordingly, he could only recover for 300 days of the\nalleged maintenance of the hostile work environment.\nNow, our construction --\nQUESTION: On your theory then, the -- the only\nthing that the continuing violation concept gives, in\neffect, is a right to use evidence of something that\nhappened prior to the period. It does not, in effect,\ngive any right to damages for the -- whatever the damage\nis for the hostility prior to the 300-day period. So, you\nturned it into an evidentiary rule, it seems to me.\nMR. SCHLICK: No. Although evidence says that\nevents outside the limitations period are admissible as\nbackground evidence, our view of the continuing violation\ndoctrine is that it allows a plaintiff to sue\nnotwithstanding that there may have been notice of -- of\nsimilar violations outside the limitations period. And\nthat's the application of the continuing violation\ndoctrine --\nQUESTION: Oh. So, you're saying if there has\nbeen no -- let's -- let's assume a case in which there is\nno independent notice of the hostile environment within\nthe 300-day period. They would still be able to sue on a\ncontinuing violation theory. Whereas, if it were a purely\nevidentiary rule, they would not be able to sue within\nthat period.\nMR. SCHLICK: Suit -- suit could be brought\nwithin 300 days for the entirety provided that it accrued\nwithin the 300 days. And the -- the relevance of the\ncontinuing violation rule is that notice outside the\nlimitations period -- in this case going back to the\nserial claims, in this case notice of related violations\noutside the limitations period do not prevent Mr. Morgan\nfor suing on violations that occurred within the\nlimitations period.\nQUESTION: Let's -- let's assume you have a\nhostile work environment that goes on for 900 days. He\ndoesn't bring an action until the last 300 days or until\nday 601. What -- what you're saying, I believe -- and\ncorrect me if I'm wrong -- is that the mere fact that the\nhostile work environment really commenced 600 days ago\ndoes -- or 900 days ago does not bar you from getting\ndamages for the last 300 days.\nMR. SCHLICK: That's right, Justice Scalia.\nWhen you say commenced, I understand you to mean accrued.\nIt became actionable.\nQUESTION: It became -- it became a hostile work\nenvironment --\nMR. SCHLICK: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- 900 days ago.\nMR. SCHLICK: That's correct, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: But it continued to be a -- a hostile\nwork for all 900 days. You can sue for the last 300\ndays --\nMR. SCHLICK: That's correct, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: -- even though it's --\nQUESTION: And you also think he can -- don't\nyou think he can get damages for the whole 900 days if a\nreasonable person wouldn't have realized that those first\n600 days were actionable?\nMR. SCHLICK: That, Justice Breyer, is the\nquestion of accrual under Harris. The -- the standard for\nthe claim in that case would be whether the work\nenvironment -- the -- was severe and pervasive both\nobjectively and subjectively.\nQUESTION: All right. Now, if you -- if you --\nwhat about just modifying it a little to try to give\nmeaning to the 2 years of back pay that you could get and\nall the other things and realities of the work place, and\nsay, as long as it was reasonable for him not to go to the\nEEOC, he can recover for the whole 900 days?\nAnd there are a lot of reasons it's reasonable\nnot to go to the EEOC. Maybe because you didn't quite\nunderstand what was going on. Maybe you thought it would\ncure itself. Maybe you thought those were just comments\nthat some guy made. He should be better educated. Maybe\nyou thought the employer will work it out. Maybe you\nthought your supervisor wasn't the rat he turned out to\nbe. All right, or whatever. You see what I'm saying? As\nlong as a judge would say it was reasonable, what about\nthat?\nMR. SCHLICK: The -- the reasonableness that\nwould allow -- that would extend the limitations period is\n-- is reasonableness that would qualify under the\nequitable tolling or equitable estoppel doctrines. And\nindeed, the limitations period is sometimes extended even\nbeyond 2 years, thereby giving effect to the 2-year\nrestriction on back pay under the equitable tolling\ndoctrine.\nQUESTION: Well, there -- there are a lot of\nreasons for not going to court too, but we've never said\nthose toll the statute of limitations.\nMR. SCHLICK: That's correct, and if it's a\nreason which does not --\nQUESTION: Do you think the Seventh Circuit has\nadopted the right test in that regard?\nMR. SCHLICK: The result of the Seventh\nCircuit's test is generally consistent with our rule, but\nthe -- the Seventh Circuit's test is in our view less\ndefinite than our own. They seem to ask whether the\nplaintiff sued at an appropriate time. Our question is,\ndid the plaintiff bring suit within -- or file a charge,\nrather, within 300 days or 180 days, if applicable, of the\naccrual of the violation, of the occurrence of the alleged\nunlawful employment practice. And that is the rule\nestablished in the NLRA, which is the model for title VII.\nQUESTION: But the agency here -- I mean, that's\n-- the position that you are taking, on behalf of the\nUnited States, differs from the EEOC's position which, I\nunderstand it, is the position that the Ninth Circuit\nfollowed.\nMR. SCHLICK: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. The\nrespondent and amici rely on regulations issued by the\nEEOC under section 717 of the act, which is the Federal\nemployer provision. Those regulations are by their terms\ninapplicable to claims under 706, and indeed, Congress\nleft it to the EEOC to establish a -- a framework for --\nfor filing charges that the EEOC requires consultation\nwithin 45 days with the agency's EEO office. So, it's a\ndifferent structure, and in that context --\nQUESTION: Well, what is the EEOC's position on\n-- on this case?\nMR. SCHLICK: In section 706 cases, respondent\ncorrectly points out that the EEOC has filed briefs and\ntaken a position which is consistent with the Ninth\nCircuit's test. Our view is that while that would be\nevaluated under Skidmore, it is not persuasive for the\nviews that we've given in our brief.\nQUESTION: And your answer to the question about\nthe 2 years is that there are cases. There wouldn't be\nvery many, though, that would fit where would be a 2-year\n-- possibility of a 2-year back pay.\nMR. SCHLICK: I can give you two cases from the\nSouthern District of New York last year, Sye v. The\nRockefeller University, 137 F.Supp.2d 276; Bardniak v.\nCushman and Wakefield, 2001 WL 1505501, both last year.\nIn both of those cases, the charge was filed 3 years after\nthe last occurrence that's alleged and applying equitable\ntolling principles, the courts indicated that the -- that\nthe complaint could go forward because of the equitable\ntolling.\nQUESTION: And you agree with those equitable --\nwhatever those equitable tolling reasons were? You think\nthose courts handled the case correctly?\nMR. SCHLICK: Yes. I think so. In both cases,\nmisinformation was provided by the agency, either the\nState agency or the EEOC itself. In one case there was a\nquestion of mental -- mental incapacity of the plaintiff,\nand tolling was additionally extended on that basis.\nQUESTION: I'm not sure I understand why hostile\nenvironment cases are unique. Why is that the only kind\nof continuing violation? I mean, if I'm not giving --\ngiven a promotion that I was entitled to because of my\nrace, I continue not to have that promotion month after\nmonth after month. Why isn't that as much of a continuing\nviolation as is a hostile work environment?\nMR. SCHLICK: In our view hostile environment\ncases are not unique and are not properly exceptions in\nwhich -- in which a continuing violation doctrine apply.\nRather it's a question of accrual, and hostile environment\ncases are distinguishable in that they may take a long\ntime to accrue. But that simply means that when they do\naccrue, the charge should be brought within 300 days. The\nexample of -- of a discharge would be --\nQUESTION: But I thought you said the opposite.\nIf -- if it accrues now, I can still sue 900 -- 900 days\nlater for the hostile work environment of the last 300\ndays. I thought that's what you said.\nMR. SCHLICK: If I may answer, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. SCHLICK: In that case there is an\noccurrence within the 300 days and it's that occurrence\nthat is the basis for the charge and the complaint within\nthe 300 days.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Schlick.\nMs. Price, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA Y. PRICE\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. PRICE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nOngoing violations of the law must be treated\ndifferently from discrete acts. A continuing unlawful\npractice which involves a present violation of the act\nmeans that the claim is not stale. Limiting liability to\n180 days solely would essentially nullify section 706(g).\nIt would allow the defendant in this case Amtrak -- would\nessentially negate the language of title VII which speaks\nin terms of practices. It speaks specifically to an\nunlawful employment practice.\nQUESTION: Well, I mean, the claim is not stale,\nof course, as to the continuing acts. The question is can\nyou go back for the acts as -- as to which the statute\narguably has run.\nMS. PRICE: This is true.\nQUESTION: And -- and so the -- the question is\nnot whether or not you can sue continuing acts. If it's\nindeed a continuing act, you can sue for the acts that are\nwithin the -- the period. The question is can you go\nback.\nMS. PRICE: Yes, Your Honor. And it is true\nthat we believe that you can go back. With respect to\nback pay, Congress has specifically provided under 706(g)\nthat you can go back 2 years for back pay liability.\nWith -- and there is a difference between a\nliability for damages and liability for essentially\nliability's sake. Under the statute, under title VII,\nCongress did not put a limit in as to how far you could go\nback. It said you must file the charge within 300 days\nfor purposes of initiating the conciliatory involvement of\nthe EEOC. But filing the charge while, you said in Zipes,\nit's like a statute of limitations, it does not dictate\nhow far you go back in terms of establishing the\nemployer's liability.\nYou said in Havens that where you have a\ncontinuing practice of discrimination, that it is\nappropriate to allow the plaintiff to recover for the\nentire practice and --\nQUESTION: But Havens was a different statute,\nwas it not?\nMS. PRICE: It is a -- it is -- yes, sir. It\nwas a different statute but it has the same language and\nit has the same purpose. It was a statute intended to\noutlaw discrimination, and it is supposed to be\ninterpreted with the same understanding, one, that it's a\nstatute that's going to be utilized by lay persons, and\ntwo, that it has a broad remedial intent.\nQUESTION: Well, have we ever set aside this\ntype of statute and said we give all possible breaks to\nplaintiffs on it? I don't believe we have.\nMS. PRICE: No. I don't believe you have. And\nI think what you said in Zipes, Mr. Chief Justice, was\nthat it was necessary to strike a balance to allow for the\nprompt filing for -- to give notice to allow the EEOC to\ngive notice to the employer and to be sure to effectuate\nthe remedial intent of the statute. So, there was a\nbalance struck.\nIf you date the trigger period for the statute\nof limitations from the date that the person either knew\nor reasonably should have known, you disrupt that balance\nbecause then you're moving the trigger from the last\noccurrence of the practice to an uncertain time when the\nplaintiff either reasonably should have known or\nunreasonably should have known.\nQUESTION: Ms. Price, the Ninth Circuit, whose\njudgment we're reviewing here, as nearly as I can tell\nseems to take a different view of what can be included for\ndamages as actionable than that taken by other circuits\nthat have looked at the same statute and the same problem.\nMS. PRICE: It is -- yes, ma'am.\nQUESTION: Would you agree with that?\nMS. PRICE: Yes, ma'am. I would agree that it\nhas taken a -- that there is a split in the circuits. I\nbelieve --\nQUESTION: Yes, a very lopsided split really.\nMS. PRICE: Well, I think the Ninth Circuit's\nposition is actually in the majority view.\nQUESTION: It's a big circuit. Right?\nMS. PRICE: Yes.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. PRICE: Yes, but none of the circuits\ndisagree about what constitutes a continuing violation.\nWhere the disagreement is is in -- similar in this case.\nThere's a disagreement between us and Amtrak as to when\nthe trigger for the practice -- for the charge-filing\nrequirement occurs. There's a disagreement as -- with --\nbetween us and the Government as to what is covered in\nthat 300-day period.\nQUESTION: Well, if there are separate events\nthat have occurred and if each one standing alone would be\nactionable and if no charge is filed or suit brought until\nafter the time limit established for some of the\nviolations, what do we do?\nMS. PRICE: Well, you look, as the circuits have\nuniformly looked, as to whether or not it is a practice or\na continuing violation. You -- it's -- you -- if you look\nat the case as a series of discrete acts, then yes, we\nlose. But it's not a case where there's a series of\ndiscrete acts, and in fact, the majority of the issues\nthat Mr. Morgan was addressing were not actionable in and\nof themselves. The initiation of disciplinary action --\nQUESTION: Do you think the acts that occurred\nbefore the applicable statutory period had expired were\nactionable?\nMS. PRICE: I -- no, I don't. I think that\nthere were some that, if they had occurred in isolation,\ncould have been actionable. When we presented the case,\nwe did not pursue this case as one for a violation, for\nexample, of the -- his termination and then ultimate\nsuspension in 1991. We did --\nQUESTION: But if you -- if you say that an\nevent, if it occurred in isolation, would be actionable,\nyou are saying then that it was actionable by itself\nwithout combining it with anything else.\nMS. PRICE: Yes, sir, I am saying that. It is\ntrue that if that is -- the difference between a discrete\nact and a continuing practice of discrimination.\nQUESTION: Well, what do you mean by a\ncontinuing -- let -- let's -- let's take the failure to\ngive a person a promotion because of her sex or his race\nor whatever. Let's assume that that occurs and then --\nand then the claim is made 2 years later. During that\nwhole 2 years, the person hasn't gotten the promotion.\nAnd is it your position that -- that when it is finally\nfiled 2 years later, you can get back pay or damages for\nthe whole 2 years, even though, you know, you had the\nclaim 2 years ago.\nMS. PRICE: Well, a promotion, as I understand\nthe law, is a distinct area, and there are some\ncircumstances where the courts have held that a promotion\nwould result in extending the time for one to recover\ndamages. There are other situations where we want to\ndistinguish between a promotion that simply involves the\ncontinuing effects.\nWe're not talking about, as -- as the Court is\nwell aware, a promotion in this case or a situation where\nit's simply Mr. Morgan is suffering the continuing effects\nof a prior decision. We're talking about a continuing\nseries of acts that continued up until the charge-filing\nperiod that were motivated by retaliation and\ndiscrimination. We're talking about a hostile environment\nclaim, and the Court should be clear there was a question\nas to whether or not this case involved a hostile\nenvironment. We brought that to the trial court's\nattention, and on October 22nd, 1998, she issued a\nspecific order ruling --\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I don't -- I'm not sure\nwhat your answer is to my hypothetical, and -- and I asked\nthe hypothetical because frankly I don't see how a hostile\nenvironment claim is any different from a failure to\npromote claim. That failure to promote continues. The --\nthe loss of salary continues right over the 2 years, just\nas a hostile environment claim continues over 2 years.\nMS. PRICE: This Court has defined a hostile\nenvironment as the -- the actionable part of it is the\nenvironment itself. It's not the discrete acts. In the\nJustice's hypothetical, I believe that you're focusing on\nthe discrete act of a failure to promote that individual,\nwhich is -- has a definite beginning, end. It's right\nthere. It happens.\nIn a hostile environment, it's not so simple.\nHostile environment -- you can have an act that might not\nbe actionable, but when you -- when you look at it over a\nperiod of time, a series of acts, that it's cumulative and\nthe harm is indivisible. In a promotion case, the harm is\nrelated solely to the failure to promote. In a hostile\nenvironment case, you can't separate the harm that's\ncaused on day 899 from the harm that's caused on day 200.\nQUESTION: What you're saying, if I understand\nit correct, is the promotion is a discrete violation with\ncontinuing effects, whereas a hostile environment is a\ncontinuing violation.\nMS. PRICE: Yes. Yes, Justice Stevens.\nQUESTION: Which is two quite different things.\nMS. PRICE: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: Suppose you have a continuing --\nQUESTION: Is this case --\nQUESTION: Suppose you have a continuing\nviolation, a hostile environment, made up of many minor\nacts.\nMS. PRICE: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: And it goes on for many, many years.\nAnd the -- the injured individual finally goes to the\nEEOC after a very long time. In your opinion, can he\nrecover damages then back for the entire 10 years or 15\nyears, or is there some cutoff point behind which you\nwon't get the damages?\nMS. PRICE: The ability to recover damages in\nthat circumstances depends on a number of factors. First\nwould be the plaintiff's ability to establish that it is\nin fact a continuing violation that --\nQUESTION: Well, he does. Let's assume he does.\nMS. PRICE: Then his ability would be affected\nby this Court's decisions in both Faragher and Burlington\nIndustries where this Court said that if there's no\ntangible employment action and the employer can show that\nit has taken appropriate steps to prevent or remedy\ndiscrimination, and the plaintiff --\nQUESTION: No, they didn't.\nMS. PRICE: Okay.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. PRICE: Well, if they can't show that the\nvictim unreasonably failed to take advantage of whatever\nremedies or opportunities were -- were not available or\nshould have been available, then yes, the plaintiff\nwould --\nQUESTION: I just wonder. You see, if at some\npoint we might say, well, he should have gone to the EEOC.\nIt was unreasonable of him not to. I wouldn't say he had\nto do it immediately, but after many years? And -- and do\nwe want to give him damages all the way back?\nMS. PRICE: The damages question again is a\nseparate question from liability. The damages are going\nto be limited by 706(g) which provides a 2-year cap on\nback pay and by the caps that Congress has enacted for\ncompensatory damages. For instance, if -- if his employer\nwas, you know, within that $50,000 range, he's only going\nto get $50,000.\nQUESTION: But would you --\nQUESTION: Why is it that if there's a\ncontinuing violation, say, for 900 days and you file on\nthe 900th day, that you can go back for the first 600\ndays? Why?\nMS. PRICE: Because the statute must have the\nability to reach practices. Where you have a longstanding\npattern or practice of retaliation or discrimination, this\nstatute in particular is designed to get at that.\nQUESTION: It does reach it. The only question\nis, you know, how many damages you get, whether you -- you\nhave to be prompt and bring your action soon enough to put\nan end to it. I mean, it's not a question of whether you\ncan reach the pattern or practice. You certainly can.\nMS. PRICE: Well, but if you limit the period\nfor which you can reach it to only 300 days, you're\nessentially immunizing the employer who has engaged in a\nlongstanding --\nQUESTION: No, you're not. You're -- you're\ntelling the person who's been harmed, you know, if you're\nharmed, take action right away --\nMS. PRICE: Well --\nQUESTION: -- which is the whole purpose of\nstatutes of limitations.\nMS. PRICE: You're telling the person not simply\nto take action, Justice Scalia, but to take action that it\nmay in fact result in greater retaliation or a loss of\nemployment. You're not telling them simply to go to the\nemployer --\nQUESTION: Well, but that's -- but that's always\ntrue.\nQUESTION: Retaliation is a separate claim.\nQUESTION: I -- I thought your answer might be\nthat it's difficult to know that there's a pervasive\nenvironment until you look at a whole context of acts.\nI'm not sure that would be a conclusive -- but at least\nthat's a reason. But when you say, well, it's necessary\nin order to enforce the act, that -- that just begs the\nquestion.\nMS. PRICE: Well, I think that there are cases\nwhere it's difficult to know. There are also cases where\npeople --\nQUESTION: All right. That's one reason.\nSuppose -- suppose that we play with the\nhypothetical and we establish that it wasn't difficult to\nknow. Is there any other reason for allowing us -- for\nrequiring the courts to go back?\nMS. PRICE: It's not that -- well, it's because\nit's fundamentally a continuing violation of the statute,\nand the statute itself allows for you to deal with\npractices.\nNumber two, you have the 706(g) statute which\nallows the court to -- or allows a -- entitles a victim of\ndiscrimination to recover damages for a 2-year period, for\nback pay.\nQUESTION: And you say that for compensatory\ndamages you rely on the lid in dollar amount.\nMS. PRICE: Yes.\nQUESTION: For back pay time. But I take it\nyour argument would be no different if there were no\nceiling on the amount you could get for compensatory or\npunitive damages.\nMS. PRICE: That is correct, and the reason why\nis because Congress looked at this problem. They looked\nat this problem in 1972. They looked at the problem again\nin 1991. Congress did not set an anterior limit on\nliability under title VII, and where Congress has not\nacted to do that, it is not appropriate for the Court to\nset that limit.\nQUESTION: Ms. Price, I don't understand the\nrationale for treating continuing violations differently\nin so far as how far you can go back to get damages. I\ncan understand why you should treat them differently for\npurposes of determining whether you can bring suit at all.\nThat is, if it's a continuing violation, the mere fact\nthat you didn't bring suit within 300 days after the\nviolation started doesn't matter. You can -- you can\nbring suit at any point during the continuing violation.\nBut it's a separate question whether, once you do bring\nsuit, you can get damages all the way back to the\nbeginning of it or rather damages just back 300 days. I\nsee no -- no reason conceptually why you should have --\nyou should be able to go all the way back.\nTake a failure to promote, which we discussed\nbefore, which you say is a one-shot violation, not a\ncontinuing violation. Okay?\nMS. PRICE: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: You -- you can't bring suit for that\nif you don't sue within 300 days.\nSuppose it's not a failure to promote. It is\nsimply a failure to pay the salary that this person in --\nin the job the person has is entitled to, and that's a\ncontinuing violation.\nMS. PRICE: Yes.\nQUESTION: It continues on and on. And you're\nsaying that even though that's been continuing on and on\nfor 2 years and the -- the employee doesn't take any\naction, he can go all the way back for the whole 2 years\ninstead of just back for the last 30 days -- last 300\ndays. I -- I don't see conceptually why that ought to be\nthe case.\nMS. PRICE: 706(g) determines how far one can go\nfor back damages. If the concern is one with respect to\nliability, the difference -- conceptually there may not be\na difference. But in fact in the -- in Bazemore, this\nCourt addressed that particular scenario, and in that\nparticular scenario, the Court said every time the person\nreceives a -- a check that's less, then that constitutes a\nviolation. I mean, it's conceivable under your -- under\nthe Court's hypothetical that the employee could file a\ncharge for each one of those paychecks, and I think that\nthat sort of turns Congress' --\nQUESTION: You're saying it's not a continuing\nviolation.\nMS. PRICE: Right. I mean, and that -- that\nupsets I believe what Congress really intended to do.\nThat would essentially eliminate the caps entirely.\nAnd we have that potential problem in this case.\nIf you look at this case as a series of discrete acts, you\nrequire Mr. Morgan to file a charge every time he's\ncharged with a rule L violation or every time they\nthreaten to charge him or every time they suggest that he\nshouldn't have been -- that he was 2 minutes late for\nwork. Those kinds of things in and of themselves should\nnot become the basis for title VII charges.\nYou have to allow for the circumstance where the\nemployee is in fact being subjected to a -- a persistent\nand a continuing pattern of discrimination that becomes\nactionable within the 300-day or the 180-day charge-filing\nperiod.\nQUESTION: Well, should we look to what a\nreasonable person should be expected to recognize as a\ncause of action?\nMS. PRICE: No. I think no, Justice O'Connor.\nQUESTION: There shouldn't be any objective test\nelement in it?\nMS. PRICE: I think that it's appropriate to\nlook at this continuing violation circumstance in the same\nway in which the Court has looked at the hostile\nenvironment claim. And in the hostile environment claim,\nthe Court has imposed both an objective test and a\nsubjective test to determine whether or not there is a\nhostile environment. That's in the definition of the\ncause of action.\nIn this case, the definition of the cause of\naction is already found within title VII. Title VII\ndefines what practices violate the act.\nWith respect to the timing, title VII doesn't\nsay -- there's nowhere in title VII where it says that you\n-- the charge-filing is triggered where the person knows\nor should have known. There is no notice requirement in\ntitle VII. Title VII ties the requirement that you file a\ncharge from the last date -- the last occurrence of the\nunlawful practice. That's what the statute says, and I\nthink that's what the Court has to impose on employers.\nThat is the certainty that employers are entitled to.\nIt's in the language.\nQUESTION: But it's not certain because if it is\na truly continuing violation -- every promotion, every --\nevery training I ask for is going to be denied -- it will\nnever end. It's going on. At some point there's going to\nbe a suit. So, the last act is just the last act that\nhappens before the employee decided to bring the suit.\nThe very nature of the continuing thing, it's going to go\non. Hopefully the -- the charge will stop it. But it's\n-- the last act is the one that the complainant would\npick. Right?\nMS. PRICE: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: I think your basic position is these\nfiling periods are like a statute of limitations in some\nrespects but not in other respects.\nMS. PRICE: This is true, and I believe that's\nwhy there is that language in Zipes. It is true that\nthere have been times when it's been referred to as -- as\na statute of limitations, but in Zipes where the Court\nlooked at it and when you look at the actual purpose of it\nin Occidental Life Insurance Company v. EEOC, again the\nCourt looked at the purpose of the charge-filing\nrequirement is not to determine liability. It's to start\nthe administrative process. That's really all it does.\nThere's other statutes of limitations or things\nthat are like a statute of limitations. You have the 90-\nday period in which one has to bring a lawsuit after you\nreceive the right to sue. That again is another\nlimitations period.\nQUESTION: Or the 45 days that you have if\nyou're a Government employee to start consulting in your\nown house.\nMS. PRICE: Exactly. This is not your\ntraditional statute of limitations that defines the period\nof time for which liability may be imposed.\nQUESTION: One of -- one of the peculiarities is\nthe difference between 180-day and 300 which makes very\ngood sense as far as administrative exhaustion is\nconcerned.\nMS. PRICE: Yes.\nQUESTION: But as -- why should the person who's\nin a deferral state get 300 days while the person who's\nnot get only 180 days if we're talking about a statute of\nlimitations as measuring the ripeness or staleness of a\nclaim?\nMS. PRICE: Yes, that is true. Congress\nunderstood that this statute could be utilized with change\ndepending on where one lived, depending on what sector of\nthe employment arena one is found in. So, it's not\nappropriate to rely upon this particular statute as\ndetermining the period of liability. You must look to\n706(g) and you must look to the caps where Congress\nspecifically tried to address the concerns of employers.\nViewing this case solely as a -- as a series of\ndiscrete acts ignores the fundamental problem that Mr.\nMorgan faced at Amtrak. Mr. Morgan thought that the --\nthe practices the he was being subjected to were only\nbeing perpetuated by a few managers. What he discovered,\nwhen he complained -- and you must acknowledge that he did\ncomplain. This is not a situation where the person sat on\nhis rights, as Amtrak would portray him. Mr. Morgan did\ncomplain, and then he discovered that Amtrak absolutely\nrefused to address those practices that were going on in\nthe Oakland yard.\nQUESTION: But if -- he complained in October\n1991 to the EEOC, didn't he? And if he discovered then\nwhat was going on, shouldn't the statute at least have\nstarted running then?\nMS. PRICE: Well, there's no indication that he\ndiscovered -- he knew that there were racist practices\ngoing on at the yard. He complained to Congresswoman\nBarbara Boxer and he complained to the EEOC with the\nanticipation that there would be some action taken. In\nfact, in 1992 Inspector Wiederholt did come out at the\ninsistence of Congresswoman Boxer and looked at that\nsituation. But that was a process that took over 10\nmonths.\nSubsequently when he did complain again in 1993,\nAmtrak took 9 months to investigate. To require him to --\nto go to EEOC within a 6-month or a 10-month window\nessentially negates his ability --\nQUESTION: But he did go to EEOC.\nMS. PRICE: He went to EEOC, yes, when they\nindicated that they intended to fire him, and that would\nresult in the absolute termination of his relationship\nwith Amtrak.\nQUESTION: There's some confusion in the -- you\nare referring not to the EEOC charge that didn't come to\ntill the end of the line, but the EEO charges that he\nfiled in-house.\nMS. PRICE: Yes.\nQUESTION: And that's what you're saying he did\nearlier.\nMS. PRICE: Yes. Yes, throughout that process.\nYes, Mr. Chief Justice, he went to Amtrak's EEO. He filed\neight separate charges with them, and they only\nresponded --\nQUESTION: When -- when was the first time he\nfiled a complaint with the EEOC?\nMS. PRICE: It was in February of 1995.\nQUESTION: You know, 300 days is -- it's almost\na year. The same thing happens in -- in statutes of -- of\nlimitations, some of which are 2 years, some of which are\nas short as 1 year. The -- the person who's thinking of\nbringing a lawsuit is put to the choice of either\nnegotiating with the person and trying to work it out, but\nat some point, if he knows there's a 1-year statute of\nlimitations, he's just going to have to say, I'm sorry,\nI'm going to go ahead.\nAnd I don't know how this 300-day period is any\ndifferent from that. It's fine to say you should be able\nto, you know, waltz around and talk to the employer and\ntalk to, you know, Barbara Boxer or whatever else, but at\nsome point the -- the curtain comes down and you know\nthat's 300 days. That's the standard operation of a\nstatute of limitations.\nMS. PRICE: In this case, Mr. -- Justice Scalia,\nthe -- as I pointed out, the -- the statute of limitations\noperates somewhat differently. It's like a statute of\nlimitations.\nMore to the point, however, in this case, as in\nthe cases that are addressed by title VII, you're talking\nabout an employment relationship, an ongoing relationship\nwhere the evidence that is -- we've presented in our\namicus briefs is that the person wants to maintain their\nemployment, and there is a very real fear that if you go\noutside the scope of your employment to an outside agency,\nthat's going to tear apart the employment relationship.\nThat -- that is essentially crossing the river, and you\ncan't go back from that. And so, it's very important to\nallow people an opportunity, and that's the -- the focus\nof the statute was to allow the EEOC not to come in and\nfile a lawsuit, but to come in and conciliate, to try to\nresolve the problem without the necessity of a lawsuit.\nSo, you don't want to adopt a strict\ninterpretation or a hard and fast rule that says you've\ngot to file a lawsuit or you've got to start this process\nwithin 10 months. That is not -- that doesn't give the\nemployer nor the employee an opportunity to try to resolve\nmatters internally.\nQUESTION: For some it's 300 days, for some it's\n180. How many States are so-called deferral States where\npeople would get the benefit of the 300 days rather than\nthe 180?\nMS. PRICE: I regret, Justice Ginsburg, I'm not\n-- I don't know how many.\nQUESTION: Because that would be a very odd\nstatute of limitations to say, depending on your -- the\nState that you're in, you get 180 days or 300 days.\nMS. PRICE: This is true. And again, it's\ninterpreted. It has to be interpreted because it applies\nin other areas of the law, and it does define -- it really\ndefines the point at which you have to try to get an\noutside agency to come in. It doesn't define the point at\nwhich you have to sue, and it doesn't define the point\nthat limits your damages. That is what is critical.\nCongress has defined the -- the point of damages.\nCongress has not defined the point of liability.\nQUESTION: But Mr. Englert said that the\nlimitation, the 2-year limitation -- that's because\nCongress was reacting to a time when there was no\nlimitation and there were fears that you'd have to go all\nthe way back to 1965. So, they set 2 years. If they had\nunderstood properly what was going to be the effect of 180\ndays, which wasn't determined till much later, then they\nwould have realized that there was -- they fixed something\nthat -- where there was nothing broken.\nMS. PRICE: Congress had an opportunity. The\nproblem with Mr. Englert's view of it is that Congress had\nanother opportunity after this Court's decision in Zipes\nin 1991, and Congress did not change either 706(g) and it\ndidn't change 706(e).\nIt did address the very concern that employers\nwere raising, that we're going to be subjected to\nunlimited damages where you -- if you allow compensatory\ndamages, and Congress put in the caps. Congress addressed\nthis problem in a different way by putting in temporal --\nexcuse me -- nontemporal limits, by putting in a monetary\nlimit. Congress could have put in a temporal limit, and\nit did not.\nIt could have taken out 706(g), and it did not.\nSo, to suggest that that section is -- is a superfluous\nsection that only addresses some long past effect of title\nVII or a doctrine that is no longer a part of title VII is\ninaccurate.\nQUESTION: Well, 706(g) would still apply to a\ncontinuing violation, wouldn't it? I mean, if there's a\ncontinuing violation, you think it wouldn't apply to that\nat all. Maybe not. You don't think 706(g) has any\napplication under -- under the petitioner's theory.\nMS. PRICE: Not under the petitioner's theory,\nno. I think that they're reading 706(g) out of the\nstatute, which this Court should not do. Ultimately in\nhostile environment cases, the sexual harassment victim --\nif you impose this requirement, the sexual harassment\nvictim, in particular, runs the risk of being -- of filing\neither too early or filing too late.\nAgain, in Love v. Pullman, this Court recognized\nthat this process is one that is initiated and utilized by\nlay persons unassisted by trained lawyers. You should not\nimpose a requirement upon a lay person to determine, oh,\nnow -- when this continuing violation doctrine is going to\nstart and when my damages are going to start accruing.\nAnd therefore, now I must file with the EEOC. They are --\nthe last act which is what Congress contemplated is what\nhas to be the trigger for the statute.\nQUESTION: But you recognize that you can't turn\nevery discrete act into a continuing violation. I mean,\nit must be used. You have conceded that the one-time\nthing -- you're not getting this promotion, you're\ndischarged.\nHow does one tell -- and here -- here there were\nseveral similar acts -- whether it's a discrete violation\non the one hand or whether it's a continuing violation?\nMS. PRICE: I think that the courts have not --\nhave been able to determine where there's a discrete act,\nand there's nothing happens. And this is really where\nthis Court has set the outer limit. The -- it requires a\npresent violation. It is sometimes difficult to determine\nwhat's a discrete act and what is a part of a pattern.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Price.\nMr. Englert, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROY T. ENGLERT, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ENGLERT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nJustice O'Connor, in one of her questions for\nMs. Price, referred to the very lopsided split in the\ncircuits, and I agree that there's a very lopsided split\ncontrary to the Ninth Circuit's view. Only one of those\nmany circuit cases that I'm aware of -- at least the\nrecent circuit cases -- actually discusses the 706(g)\nissue that's taken up much of the argument time today, and\nthat is the First Circuit's opinion in Sabree, which\nactually comes out squarely where we come out in this\ncase, that in general damages are cut off at 300 days.\nThere is an exception, the details of which it's probably\nbetter not to spend any more time on. But we agree with\nthe Sabree result.\nUnder no circumstances does our view render\nsection 706(g) superfluous. I do think it's something of\nan anachronism enacted to deal with problems that went\naway, but under no circumstances is it superfluous. In\ncases of equitable tolling, in government suits against\nmunicipalities under section 707 where there is no statute\nof limitations, in the kinds of hostile environment cases\nwe were discussing earlier, the 2-year back pay cap can\nhave effect.\nLet me mention very briefly, although not much\ntime was spent on it earlier, the Havens case was decided\nunder a different statute. In the Lorance case, the\nSolicitor General urged the Court to follow Havens. The\nCourt said no. The Court didn't address Havens in its\nopinion. It said -- but it said -- did say in its opinion\nthe more relevant precedents are the NLRA precedents,\nwhich squarely support the position we're taking here\ntoday.\nBecause --\nQUESTION: What's the difference between your\nposition and the Government's?\nMR. ENGLERT: Very little, if any, Your Honor.\nI think they might concede less than I was conceding\nearlier, but other than that, I think there's very little\ndifference.\nAnd the Government, quite importantly, in its\nbrief says what the continuing violation doctrine is, and\nwhat the continuing violation doctrine is in all other\nareas of law besides title VII is essentially what some of\nJustice Scalia's questions were suggesting, which is\nyou're not out of court entirely just because you didn't\nbring suit within 300 days of the first incident or 4\nyears in the case of the Clayton Act. You do get to bring\nsuit, but you only get damages reaching back to the\nlimitations period.\nLet me mention very quickly. Amtrak did win\nthis case at trial. So, I don't want the Court to have\nthe impression that it's conceded that there was racial\ndiscrimination going on, but I'll leave it at that.\nAnd finally, just a detail. 43 States and the\nDistrict of Columbia more or less are deferral States.\nThat's the figure the Government has given me, and I'm --\nI'm certain it's more than 40 States are deferral States.\nQUESTION: Could you explain the logic in\nstatute of limitations terms between giving some people\n300 and others 180?\nMR. ENGLERT: The only logic is that that's what\nCongress said. If it's a single incident case and you\nfile on the 181st day, you're out of court if you're not\nin a deferral State.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nEnglert.\n"
