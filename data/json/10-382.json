        "content": "(10:06 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument today in case 10-382, United States v.\nJicarilla Apache Nation.\nMr. Shah.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SHAH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nRelying on common law trust principles\napplicable to private fiduciaries, the Federal Circuit\nimposed on the United States a duty to disclose\nattorney-client privileged communications to an Indian\ntribe. That abrogation of the privilege should be\nreversed for at least three reasons.\nFirst, reflecting the sovereign nature of\nthe United States function, the Indian trust context\nlacks the factors essential to recognition of a private\ntrust fiduciary exception. Unlike in a private trust,\ngovernment attorneys and other Federal officials owe an\nexclusive duty of loyalty to the United States, not to\nthe beneficiary. The government pays the cost of trust\nadministration out of appropriated funds, not out of the\ntrust corpus. The government, not the trust, owns the\nresulting record, and the release of such governmental\nrecord, including to a tribe or individual Indian, is\ngoverned by specific statutes and regulations as well as\nthe Freedom of Information Act, not the common law.\nSecond, the decision below conflicts with\nthis Court's precedents that distinguish the United\nStates from a private trustee and that reject\nenforcement of duties governing the administration of\nIndian property that are not set forth by specific\nstatute or regulation.\nThe fiduciary exception to the\nattorney-client privilege is premised on a private\ntrustee's general common law duty to disclose trust\ninformation, but no statute or regulation imposes such a\nduty on the United States.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, all of the\nstatutes relating to these funds use the word \"trust.\"\nNot one statute defines trust and says in any way this\nis not a fiduciary relationship. To the contrary, in\nfact, most of the statutes require what would be\nconsistent with fiduciary obligations, and at least one\nof them that you rely on says \"but not limited to.\"\nSo the issue before us doesn't involve a\ncompeting sovereign interest by the U.S. You've\nconceded that in your cert petition. The circuit below\nsaid this is not a case where there is an independent\nsovereign issue governing the U.S. activities. Just\nexplain to me what's the rationale that would permit a\ntrustee of a trust fund to withhold from the beneficiary\nthe kinds of documents that relate to the management of\nthe fund? If the funds exist for the benefit of the\nIndian tribe, why aren't they entitled to management\ndocuments?\nMR. SHAH: Okay -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's the part that\ndoesn't make -- that you're not explaining.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Shah, you might want\nto make your third point. You said you had three points\npreliminarily, so why don't you make your third point\nand then respond to the question.\nMR. SHAH: Sure, Your Honor. The third\npoint is that the Federal Circuit's decision poses\nserious practical problems for the government because\nthe general common law duty to disclose which undergirds\nthe fiduciary exception extends to all trust information\nwithout regard to the existence of litigation; excepting\nit implies a broad and burdensome disclosure obligation.\nFor example, there are over 300,000 individual account\nholders, individual Indian account holders on top of the\ntribal, tribal account holders. If this Court were to\naccept the fiduciary exception and thereby ratify the\nunderlying rationale, presumably then any one of those\nor all of those 300-plus thousand individual account\nholders could simply call up the Interior Department and\nrequest all related trust records outside of the\nexisting statutory and regulatory regime.\nNow, Justice Sotomayor, let me turn back to\nyour set of questions, and let me start with the first\npoint that you made, which is the statutes here use the\nterm trust; why doesn't that connote some sort of broad\nfiduciary relationship? This Court has made clear in\nits precedents, and it dates back to the Mitchell 1, the\nfirst decision in Mitchell case, where Congress's use of\nthe term \"trust,\" the Court said, does not imply the\nfull gamut of common law fiduciary obligations.\nThe dissent made precisely -- the dissent in\nMitchell made precisely the argument that you're\nsketching out here, which is when Congress uses a term\nlike trust, we would naturally assume that it implies\nfiduciary obligations. The majority in Mitchell\nrejected that notion, and in fact in Mitchell 2 in the\nNavajo Nation decisions, the Court has continued to\nreject that proposition. But more -- more than as a\nmatter of precedent I think that makes -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But in both -- in all of\nthose cases, counsel, it was a limitation related to\ncompeting interests, meaning it was recognizing that\nthere are potentially moments in which an attorney is\nacting both in the interest of the government and in the\ninterest of the tribe.\nMR. SHAH: Justice Sotomayor, with respect,\nthere is no competing interest that I'm aware of that\nwere mentioned in -- in the Mitchell decisions, Mitchell\n1, Mitchell 2, or even the Navajo Nation decision.\nThose were simply -- in Mitchell 1 it was the Indian\nGeneral Allotment Act, which said that the United States\n\"shall hold in trust\" land for the benefit of the\nIndians. The argument made by the tribe in that case\nand by the dissenters in the Court was when the Court\nsaid you shall hold the land in trust, that implies\ncertain management and other responsibilities for\nresources related to that land. This Court said no,\nwhen Congress uses the term \"trust\" in the Indian\ncontext, that there must be specific statutory\nregulatory duties that the Court sets out. Let me\nexplain -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that was a\njurisdictional question, not a question with respect\nto -- to the -- to the obligation. You're not seriously\nsuggesting that if you're a trustee of an Indian fund\nthat you can breach your fiduciary duty by simply not\nexercising care in your investment strategies. So some\nform of -- of duty exists.\nMR. SHAH: Sure, and let me -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- from the common law,\nand the common law has to define that.\nMR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, I agree\neverything up to the point when you said we go to the\ncommon law. Of course there would be in this context\nsome enforceable duties with respect to investment of\nthe funds held in trust, and that's because the relevant\nstatutes, section 161a and 162a, set forth specific\ninvestment duties that the government must comply with.\nNow, as to your other point, that Mitchell 1 and the\nNavajo Nation -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so why would, if it\nimposes those duties, protect you from disclosing items\nthat might -- attorney confidences that go to that very\nact, the very act of investing in the way, even under\nyour definition, that the trust requires you to?\nMR. SHAH: A couple responses, Your Honor.\nThe -- the two statutes that you're talking about, 161a\nand 162a, set forth specific investment duties. They\ndon't say anything about disclosure. The 1994 Act does\nset forth some disclosure obligations, but they are\nextremely discrete. There are essentially two\ndisclosure obligations that all of these statutes\ntogether impose. The -- the United States must provide\nan account statement, a quarterly account statement; and\nthe United States must provide the -- the Indian tribes\nand individual Indians an annual audit. That is the\nextent of disclosure obligations that Congress has set\nforth and that the Interior Department by regulation has\nimplemented.\nNow, to the -- to the extent that your\nquestion suggests that the tribes may need more in order\nto enforce those enforcement duties, I think the -- the\naccount statements and the annual audit goes a long way\ntowards suggesting that if there is a problem, then the\ntribe may want to try to enforce those duties.\nThe other point I would make is, although\nthe legally enforceable duties under this Court's\ndecisions in Mitchell and Navajo Nation are those set\nforth by statute and regulation, that doesn't mean the\nInterior Department doesn't have discretion to provide\nmore information. And in fact, in practice, the\nInterior Department does provide a much broader swath of\ninformation to the Indian tribes regarding these\naccounts than the two discrete pieces of information\nthat the statutes set forth.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you agree that the -- do\nyou agree that the fiduciary exception is well\nestablished as a general matter?\nMR. SHAH: Your Honor, the United States\ndoes not contest the existence of a fiduciary exception\nin certain private trust contexts where the criteria for\nthat exception are satisfied. So the answer is no, we\ndon't, we don't dispute the existence in certain\ncontexts under certain circumstances of a fiduciary\nexception.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So if this cause arose in a\ndifferent context with a different trustee, the position\nof the United States would be that under Rule 501 of the\nFederal Rules of Evidence there is a fiduciary exception\nto the attorney-client privilege?\nMR. SHAH: Yes, Your Honor. It would depend\non the circumstances. For example, if it were a private\ntrust and the factors that -- in which the courts, the\nold English cases, for example, have recognized where\nthe fiduciary exception applies, that is the information\nis sought solely for the benefit of the beneficiary, the\nexpenses for that legal advice are paid out of the trust\ncorpus, and as a result of that, the resulting legal\nadvice and the resulting records belong to the trust\ncorpus. All of those things give right, as the old\nEnglish cases say, give right to a common law right of\naccess for the beneficiary to access those.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Shah, you don't have\nto take a position on that, because you don't represent\na private trustee. And the government can accept\narguendo that there would be such a relationship, but I\ndon't think you have to defend it.\nMR. SHAH: Absolutely, the Court need not\ndecide that question in order to reach the question.\nThe Court can assume it arguendo and then go forward. I\nthink the critical point here is, though, that all of\nthe factors that underlie that -- that exception in the\nprivate trustee concept are absent here. Here the\ngovernment is acting out of its own interest. It is\npaying for the legal advice out of congressional\nappropriations. The government owns the records at\nissue by virtue of the Federal Records Act, by virtue of\nInterior Department regulations, which are cited in the\nback of our brief make very clear that the government\nowns these records, and because they are governmental\nrecords their disclosure is not governed by the common\nlaw. There is a highly -\nJUSTICE ALITO: The thrust of what -- my\nunderstanding of the thrust of what Justice Sotomayor\nwas asking is something like the following: It's easy\nto understand how there can be competing government\ninterests when you're talking about some, the management\nof lands, things of that nature. But when you're just\ntalking about managing funds, what competing interests\ncan there be in practical terms? If you assume arguendo\nthat this exception applies to a private trustee, why\nshould it not apply to the government in practical\nterms?\nMR. SHAH: Sure. Let me provide two\nresponses, Justice Alito. First, I think as a formal\nposition I don't think our position turns, as a formal\nmatter, on the existence of a specific competing duty.\nI think such a rule would overlook the ways in which the\nU.S. inherently, United States inherently differs from a\nprivate trustee. And I think that's especially true in\nthe light of the complex multifaceted ways in which the\ngovernment interacts with Indians and Indian tribes.\nThose sovereign obligations extend to law -- providing\nlaw enforcement, educational duties, health services.\nOne subset of those duties are the type of trust\nresponsibilities at issue in this case.\nNow, to be more concrete, I think, even\nputting aside that larger framework which may create\ntensions between the United States and with -- and the\nIndian tribes in certain circumstances, I think even in\nthe trust fund, purely in the trust fund context that\nwe're talking about, there could be at least tensions\nthat arise.\nFor example, the D.C. Circuit in the Cobell\ncase when it talked about the accounting obligation that\nit imposed on the government, it made clear that it's\nnot the same accounting obligation that would apply at\ncommon law. And the reason the D.C. Circuit gave was\nbecause the United States would be taking that -\nperforming that obligation at the expense of taxpayers.\nThere are budgetary constraints that the United States\nmust take into consideration as a sovereign. Maybe\nthat's not a specific competing obligation in the formal\nsense, but I think it's -- it's a factor that\ndistinguishes the United States from a private\nfiduciary.\nAlso, there are -- for example in our brief\nwe discuss one of, just as an example, one of the\ndocuments at issue in this case, which involves a\njudgment by a tribal court seeking to attach funds from\nan individual Indian money account. The United States\nacts as a trustee with respect to that individual -\nIndian account. It may be the case that the United\nStates consistent with its fiduciary obligations in that\nsense could simply pay out the judgment, but I think\nthere would be room for the United States to take a\ncloser look at the judgment, to make sure that it\ncomplies with, for example, the Indian Civil Rights Act\nor basic due process -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose we have the Union\nTrust Company, a private company that has 5,000 trust\naccounts. One day the president of the company says to\nthe lawyer: Mr. Smith's account is in a special\nsituation. Will you please look into what we should do\nfor him as trustee? There's no implication for any\nother account. There's no threat of litigation. I just\nwant to know what we're supposed to do. Now, I take it\nthe document that is subsequently written would be open\nfor Mr. Smith to get; is that right?\nMR. SHAH: Yes, Your Honor. We do not -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, okay. Now, why should\nthe government be treated differently were the situation\nidentical to what I just proposed?\nMR. SHAH: I think the response is, Your\nHonor, is that the situation will never be identical to\nthe hypothetical you posed because the government\ninherently differs, and let me set out -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But this argument,\nfrankly, would be -- we wouldn't have any need for 501,\nbecause if as an evidentiary rule the government is\nalways different, then there is no situation in which\nfiduciary duties in common law would ever exist.\nMR. SHAH: To be clear, Justice Sotomayor,\nthe government is not arguing that no common law\nexception to the attorney-client privilege can apply to\nthe government or that Federal Rule 501, Federal Rule of\nEvidence 501 is otherwise inapplicable. We're making a\nmuch more limited argument that this particular common\nlaw fiduciary exception is not applicable to the\ngovernment, and that is because the premise of that\nfiduciary exception does not apply.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there -- is there any\ngreater value to a fiduciary duty than to manage the\naccount for the benefit of the beneficiary? That's the\nvery essence of what a trust means, and so I'm having a\nhard time understanding not a competing interest\nsituation where you're addressing a different statutory\nrequirement, but merely -- and that's what this case was\npresented as, merely the management of the trust. So\nwhat you're, it seems to me, you're arguing is there is\nno duty. You're saying it's all defined by statute\nonly, but you're rendering -- there's no need to use the\nword \"trust\" because it wouldn't be a trust.\nMR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, I don't think\nthat those two things are inconsistent. The fact that\nwe don't look to the common law to fill in all of the\nduties doesn't mean that the government doesn't have\nduties in this context. It has very specific duties, to\ninvest the funds properly, to invest the funds as set\nforth in the statutes. What this Court has said could\nnot be done is to look at the general common law to\ncreate obligations on the government.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I would like to get an\nanswer to my question.\nMR. SHAH: Sure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: My question, to go back to\nit, was imagine that the government has a thousand trust\naccounts for a thousand tribes.\nMR. SHAH: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And imagine that several of\nthem consist of nothing more than $500,000 in cash.\nMR. SHAH: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And one day the Secretary\nof the Interior says to a lawyer: I fear there is kind\nof a difficult fiduciary problem arising into account\nnumber 302, which is owned by such and such tribe.\nThere is no threat of litigation. As far as I can tell,\nthe answer to this will have no implication for anything\nelse in the government. Will you please look at it and\ngive me a memo what to do?\nNow, why should that memo not be given to\nthe lawyer for the tribe if in the identical case of the\nUnion Trust Company you would give the lawyer -- the\nmemo to the beneficiary?\nMR. SHAH: A couple of reasons, Your Honor.\nFirst, as this Court recognized, starting back in 1912\nin the Heckman case, and reiterated in the Candelaria\nand Minnesota cases after that, is that the United\nStates is not acting simply out of the beneficiary's\ninterests.\nSo in the hypothetical, the original\nhypothetical that you posed in the corporation or the\nbank that was acting as a trustee, there the trustee is\nsimply acting out of its fiduciary obligation solely to\nbenefit the beneficiary. That is not how the\ngovernments work. As this Court made clear, the\ngovernment is acting not out of the beneficiary's\ninterests, it is acting out of its own sovereign\ninterest in managing the statutes and regulations that\ngovern the administration of Indian property. That's a\nfundamental difference.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're saying, one, we're\nnot really a trustee totally?\nMR. SHAH: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, if we\ntreated -- the courts treated you as a trustee really\nand totally -\nMR. SHAH: Sure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- in this very limited\nsituation I described, what harm would befall the\ngovernment?\nMR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, we would still\nwin, and here's why. The factors that -- even assuming\na common law trustee, the fiduciary exception doesn't\napply automatically at all common law trustees. There's\nseveral things that underlie that fiduciary exception.\nOne, the -- the -- the advice sought is\ntypically paid for out of the trust corpus, and as a\nresult of that fact, the trust itself owns the records.\nThose are the principal two factors that the cases\nrecognizing a fiduciary exception rely upon to create a\ncommon law right of access of the beneficiary to such\nrecords.\nNone of those factors are present here. The\ngovernment pays for these -- for -- for the cost of\nadministration, including legal advice, out of\ncongressionally appropriated funds. The records\nresulting from that advice belonged to the government.\nThe government owns those records, both as a matter of\nstatute and regulation. And the disclosure of those\nrecords is subject to a highly reticulated regime.\nThere are statutes, there is regulations, there is the\nFreedom of Information Act. All of that would be\nbypassed if this Court were to accept the fiduciary\nexception in this context.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Shah -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Other than the time and\nexpense of going through voluminous records, which is\nobvious, is there any other harm to the government in\nbeing required to show that there's a competing interest\nthat makes disclosure unnecessary or improper?\nMR. SHAH: Yes, Your Honor. As I said to\nJustice Alito, it may not always be that the government\ncan point to a specific competing interest in the sense\nthat Justice Sotomayor is talking about, a competing\nstatutory interest. But there are inherently these\ntensions, budgetary concerns, other ways in which the\nUnited States interacts with Indian affairs.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is one -- is one of them\nshielding government actors? I mean, from what you said\nso far, on the one hand you recognize that it is what we\ncall a guardian, the guardian-ward relationship between\nthe United States and the tribe. But what you seem to\nbe suggesting is that the government has a dual focus,\nand one is its guardianship relation to the tribe, but\nthe other is these are government actors and the\ngovernment is also interested in shielding its actors.\nIs that -- is that it or is it a more\nnebulous interest?\nMR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, I think it\ncould be more nebulous -- but -- but there -- I think\nthere is a real chilling concern. And I think this\ndovetails into Justice Kennedy's question, that the\nInterior Department, in order to properly administer, to\ncarry out the statutory and regulatory duties, it often\nneeds to seek the legal advice of -- of the lawyers in\nthe Interior office or in the Department of Justice. In\norder to avoid the chilling the full and frank seeking\nof rendering of legal advice, the same purposes -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, this is just the\ngeneral purpose behind the exception to 301, right,\nthe -- the exception for providing attorney's advice.\nThe ordinary private litigant doesn't have to show, when\nhe refuses to turn over attorney advice, that there's\nsome conflict which would make it harmful for him to\nturn that over, does he?\nMR. SHAH: Not as a general matter, Your\nHonor. If -- if -- if we were in the private trustee\ncontext and a court were to decide that the fiduciary\nexception applied -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not in the trustee context.\nI'm just talking about the normal operation.\nMR. SHAH: Oh, absolutely, Your Honor. The\njustifications are general in nature and there isn't an\nobligation to -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and so, once you\nestablish that this isn't the normal trust complex, we\napply the normal Rule 301 law, and -- and that does not\nrequire the person who declines to turn over the\ninformation to show why it would really hurt him to turn\nit over, right?\nMR. SHAH: I think that's exactly correct,\nJustice Scalia.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How many -- how many of\nthese mismanagement suits are there? Do you have any\nestimate?\nMR. SHAH: Yes. Currently there are about\n90 such pending suits, counting all of the district\ncourts as well as the Court of Federal Claims. And -\nand -- and of course, this issue could arise in any of\nthose cases.\nLet me get back to one of Justice\nSotomayor's questions, the -- the initial question about\nthe fact that the Congress has used the term \"trust.\" I\nthink as a matter of precedent, both the Mitchell\ndecisions and the Navajo Nation decisions, I think those\nare binding, controlling precedent, and the Court should\nnot deviate from those precedents that say a statute or\nregulation must define the duty. But beyond the binding\nnature of those precedents, I think they make sense from\nfirst principles as well, and let me try to explain why.\nThe -- the -- the term \"trust\" has been used\nby both Congress and the courts in a variety of ways,\noften in a variety of imprecise ways, when it comes to\nthe relationship between the United States and Indians\nand Indian tribes. Courts and Congress have used the\nterm when it comes to providing law enforcement, when it\ncomes to providing educational services, health\nservices, none of which are really the type of private\ncommon law trust that we know.\nAnd even in scenarios where there is a\ndiscrete property interest that might bring us closer to\nthe common law context, this Court has used -- this\nCourt and Congress has recognized that \"trust\" can mean\na lot of different things. It can mean the type of bare\ntrust that was at issue in Mitchell 1, the Indian\nGeneral Allotment Act, when the trust was really simply\nto avoid alienation of the land. It may mean specific\ninvestment duties, as we have here.\nBut the point is that there is no \"one size\nfits all\" trust terminology, and so that's why it makes\nsense for this Court to require Congress to set forth\nthe specific duties and statutes, and the Interior\nDepartment to set forth specific duties and regulations\nbefore it implies such a sweeping obligation on the\nUnited States.\nI think it also flows from a more general\nprinciple of a reluctance to hold the United States to\ncommon law duties when there's an existing statutory and\nregulatory regime. I think for all of those reasons,\nnot only as a matter of precedent, but as -- as a matter\nof principle, I think the -- the -- the fiduciary\nexception would -- would not apply here.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I hadn't thought about\nyour argument until this -- until you made it this\nmorning, that if there -- if -- if the tribe is correct\nthat it owns these documents and gets -- can get them\nanytime, but the -- the -- the trial court here divided\nthe documents into five categories.\nMR. SHAH: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: As to some of those\ncategories it -- it denied -- it denied production.\nMR. SHAH: Yes, Your Honor, but those -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I take it did that in\nthe context of recognizing the attorney-client\nprivilege, including work product, which were the\naccountant's records.\nMR. SHAH: Right. As I understand it,\nyou're right, Justice Kennedy, that most of the\ndocuments that the -- the trial court said the\ngovernment didn't have to produce were, as you stated,\nattorney work product privileges -- privileged\ndocuments, and those the trial -- the trial court said\nthat no fiduciary exception would apply to the attorney\nwork product privilege. And it was on that basis that\nit allowed the government to withhold the documents.\nIf there are no further questions, I would\nlike to reserve the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Shah.\nMR. SHAH: Thank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Gordon.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN D. GORDON\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. GORDON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Jicarilla Apache Nation has sued the\ngovernment for mismanaging millions of dollars of its\ntrust monies. No trustee in this situation, including\nthe government, is entitled to withhold the legal advice\nthat it has received about managing the beneficiary's\nmoney. The beneficiary is entitled to see that legal\nadvice, so that it can determine whether the trustee\nfollowed the advice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's -- you don't\ndoubt that in this context sovereign commands would\ntrump trustee obligations, do you? In other words, if\nCongress -\nMR. GORDON: I -- I -- I do not -- I do not,\nMr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.\nMR. GORDON: The -- the notion of -- the\nissue here is an issue of evidence, and it is controlled\nby Federal Rule 501, which specifies that Federal courts\nthat resolve claims of privilege based on common law\nprinciples. Under the common law, a trustee cannot\nassert the attorney-client privilege to withhold from a\nfiduciary legal advice about management of the trust.\nThat, I submit, is the end of the analysis.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what do you make of\nthe fact that the Uniform Trust Code reserves decision\non the question whether there is a fiduciary exception\nto the attorney-client privilege? That seems to suggest\nthat as a general matter, this is not as\nwell-established as you seem to argue.\nMR. GORDON: Your Honor, there are very -\nthere are a handful of States that have not recognized\nthe fiduciary exception, but there is no Federal circuit\nthat has refused to recognize it. Indeed, all of the\nFederal circuits that have considered it have adopted\nit, and it is recognized in both, as we stated in our\nbrief, the Restatement of Trusts and the Restatement of\nthe law Governing Lawyers.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Gordon -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Has it ever been applied,\nto your knowledge, where -- where it was not the case\nthat the trust paid for the attorney's advice out of the\ntrust funds and where the trust did -- where -- where\nthe trust owned the papers that consisted of the\nattorney's advice? Is there any case where those two\nconditions or either one of them did not exist where\nthe -- the trust was required to turn over the\nattorney's advice?\nMR. GORDON: Justice Scalia, I -- I cannot\ncite a specific case -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but, see, that's the\nargument of the government, that the exception, the\ntrust exception to the extent that it exists, was based\nprincipally upon the fact that these papers belonged to\nthe trust and that the attorney's advice had been paid\nfor by the trust, so of course the trustee is entitled\nto get it.\nMR. GORDON: But that's not correct, if -\nif I may, Mr. Justice. If you look at the seminal\nAmerican decision, the Riggs Bank decision that's cited\nin both briefs, they talk about the rationales and they\nsaid that the first rationale is that the trustee acts\nas a proxy for the beneficiary in obtaining the advice.\nThe second rationale is that the trustee has\na general duty to disclose relevant information to the\nbeneficiary. The Court mentioned that one factor that\nit would look at was who had paid for the legal advice,\nbut it did not suggest that that was determinative, and\nindeed subsequent case law has made clear that it is\nnot, and the Restatement says explicitly that who paid\nis not the controlling factor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you don't have a single\ncase?\nMR. GORDON: Not that I can cite right now.\nBut it would be -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought Riggs -- you\nsaid Riggs was a case where the trust fund paid the\nlawyer, and the Court distinguished cases where that\nwasn't so, where the trustee was paying the lawyer for\nthe trustee's own protection, and the Court went out of\nits way to say we are dealing with a case where the\nlawyer is paid out of trust funds. In Riggs, the -\ncase, right?\nMR. GORDON: Yes, Your Honor. But the issue\n-- this is, I submit, letting the tail wag the dog.\nWhat we are talking about is money that belongs to the\nbeneficiary. We're talking about money. We're not\ntalking about a bare trust. We're talking about a\nfull-fledged trust under Mitchell 2. Indeed, this Court\nin Mitchell 2 said that trusts involving the management\nof Indian money were full-fledged trusts. And in that\nsituation for the government to say that, while any\nprivate fiduciary would be obliged to show to the\nbeneficiary the legal advice it's received when there's\nan issue about whether it's fulfilled its fiduciary\nduties, it's different because we've spent our\nhard-earned money on these lawyers and we own the\nrecords in issue. I mean, that doesn't make sense.\nAnd basically as a matter of discovery,\nwhich is where we are right now, the posture of the\ncase, whenever you seek discovery, in virtually all of\nthose circumstances the documents in issue are going to\nbelong to the opposing party.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, the\nattorney-client privilege is policy-based and I'm\nconcerned about the policy implications of your\nposition. Our system has concluded that it works best\nif people have candid advice from their lawyers, and my\nconcern here is if you're a lawyer -- you are a lawyer\n-- and -- and you're asked for your advice by a\ntrustee -\nMR. GORDON: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and if you know\nthat that is going to be shared with the beneficiary,\nyou're going to give bland, mushy, hedging advice rather\nthan direct and candid advice to the trustee, because\nit's going to be shared more widely beyond the trustee.\nAnd that's -- that hurts not only the trustee, but also\nthe beneficiaries, whose trustee does not have candid\nlegal advice.\nMR. GORDON: My response to that would be\ntwofold, Your Honor. The first is that that same\nargument can be made for any private fiduciary, yet the\ncourts have felt that the more important relationship is\nthe relationship between the trustee and the\nbeneficiary, that that trumps the need for or the\ndesirability for private discussions between the -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So how does -- I\nappreciate the point, but how does a trustee get candid\nlegal advice? In every case, isn't the -- the lawyer -\nconcerning his dealings with the beneficiary, with the\ntrust: I don't know if I have to do this or I have to\ndo this.\nMR. GORDON: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it seems to me\nif the -- if the information is always going to be\nshared with the beneficiary, the trustee is always going\nto get hedged advice.\nMR. GORDON: Well, if it's never shared,\nYour Honor, then it leaves it at the option of the\ntrustee to selectively waive the privilege when it's to\nits advantage in a breach of trust suit.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. Why can't the trustee\nsay: I'm going to hire my own lawyer? I'm not going to\npay this lawyer out of trust funds, so it will be my\nlawyer, and his advice is only to me and serving my\ninterests? Why wouldn't -- why wouldn't that suffice?\nMR. GORDON: I think the issue, Your Honor,\nis whether that, in fact, is what the trustee is\nseeking. If the trustee is seeking advice about\npersonal liability, then I certainly agree that the\ntrustee could do that. If the trustee instead is\nseeking advice, regardless of who pays for it, but is\nseeking legal advice about how the trustee should manage\nmoney belonging to the beneficiary -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's always\na question of liability. If he messes up and doesn't\nmanage it the way he's supposed to, he will be liable.\nSo the distinction you draw doesn't seem to me to be a\nworkable one.\nMR. GORDON: Well, Your Honor, I -- I submit\nthat the whole issue is if there is a suit for breach of\ntrust, which is the precondition for all of this,\nwhether in that circumstance the trustee is obliged to\nproduce the legal advice that it has received so the\nbeneficiary can be -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The trustee cannot hire his\nown lawyer, you're saying. So long as he's a trustee,\nhe cannot hire his own lawyer to get advice on how to\nmanage the trust in a way that will avoid his liability.\nHe just can't do it, right? Trustees can't -\nMR. GORDON: Yes, Your Honor, that's the\nposition. And that puts the government in no different\nposition than private beneficiaries or ERISA\nbeneficiaries or any other sorts of beneficiaries.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What's your best case that\nyou have on that in the private trustee context? I had\nthought your answer was going to be that in that case,\nthe fact that the payment is made by the trustee out of\nthe trustee's own funds and not out of the trust funds\nmight be dispositive and might give him the privilege.\nBut you -- you seem to say, in answer to the questions\nfrom the Court, that, other than this distinction you\nmake between what the personal liability is and how he\nought to manage the trust, which I think is a murky\ndistinction, that the documents have to be disclosed.\nWhat's your best case for that?\nMR. GORDON: Justice Kennedy, let me respond\nto that. And I agree that who is paying for it -- if\nthe trustee is paying for it out of his own or her own\npocket, that is a factor that certainly should be looked\nat and would be entitled to -- to some weight in terms\nof what the purpose of the advice was for; but\nultimately the issue is whether the trustee is seeking\nto protect personal interests, protect against a claim\nof liability, for example, or whether is -- the trustee\nis looking for advice about how to manage the\nbeneficiary's money.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So I'm the trustee,\nand I say I would like legal advice as to whether I\nshould renegotiate this lease with the government.\nMR. GORDON: Yes, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, I want that\nadvice so I manage the trust correctly, and I'm\nconcerned if I don't manage the trust correctly I'm\ngoing to be sued. Now is the document from the lawyer\nresponding to that inquiry privileged or not?\nMR. GORDON: I think, Your Honor, that if it\nfocuses on how to manage it properly, then -- and it's\nprospective, then I think that the -- it -- it is not\nprivileged. If, instead, you posit, you know, this is\nwhat I did and I'm concerned I may have screwed up, do\nyou think I'm liable, then I think a different answer\nmay obtain.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if he says this\nis what I did and I might be liable, it's privileged.\nIf he says this is what I'm going to do -\nMR. GORDON: Please tell me what to do, yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Which means you can't get\npreventative advice, which is one of the most important\nkinds of advice an attorney can give.\nMR. GORDON: Well, Your Honor, I agree\npreventative advice is the most -- is among the most\nimportant one can give. But why should the government\nbe in a different position with regard to this than the\nprivate beneficiary?\nJUSTICE BREYER: I have a question on that\nparticular point, and there may be an obvious answer to\nthis which I just couldn't find. But if the lawyer is\nin the government and he writes a memo, then -- and if\nit's available to a litigant who litigates against the\ngovernment, as it would be here, then why isn't it\navailable to the entire world via the Freedom of\nInformation Act?\nMR. GORDON: Your Honor, the Court said in\nthe Sears decision, which is the cited in our brief -- I\nbelieve it's in footnote 16 -- that citizens' access\nrights under FOIA are not necessarily coextensive\nwith -\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's certainly true,\nthey're not. But I just wonder, what is it in FOIA that\nwould make this not available to the world?\nMR. GORDON: That, Your Honor, and also the\nfundamental -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that just -- that\njust says it may or may not be coextensive. Reading the\nstatute, it says you have to make all inter- agency or\nall memos available of a certain type, which I think\nthis would fall into. Then exception 5 protects, among\nother things, attorney-client memos that are privileged\nbecause they're inter-agency or intra-agency memos that\nwould not be available by law to a party other than an\nagency in litigation.\nMR. GORDON: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, they are available if\nyou win. And so, if you win that exception doesn't seem\nto apply. And if it doesn't seem to apply, that's what\nwas -- then the whole world can get this memo. And what\nI'm wondering is there must -- either there is a very\nobvious answer to that, which there could be, or there\nisn't. If there is an obvious answer, that's the end of\nit.\nMR. GORDON: I would say -\nJUSTICE BREYER: If there isn't an obvious\nanswer, I'll have to go away and worry about it.\nMR. GORDON: I would say, Your Honor, that\nthis Court's decision in Julian, where it said that\ndifferent classes of persons may have different rights\nunder FOIA -- the right we are talking about here is the\nright of the beneficiaries. We're not talking about the\ncitizen's right to see how Indian trust monies have been\nmanaged.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know you don't want that,\nand what I'm looking is how you prevent that.\nMR. GORDON: But I believe that under the\nprecedent in Julian, that it would be that what we're\ntalking about here is access to Indians whose money is\nbeing managed.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If we assume for the sake of\nargument that a private trustee may, using the private\ntrustee's own fund, hire an attorney to obtain\nprospective advice about liability, does that doom your\nargument here for the reason that the government claims\nit has no ability to set up a system like this, to have\nsome attorneys in the solicitor's office provide advice\nregarding the management of the funds and other\nattorneys in the solicitor's office provide advice\nregarding -- regarding the possibility of prospective\nliability in light of all of these suits that you\nmentioned?\nMR. GORDON: Well, Your Honor, again I come\nback that the trustee is entitled where the issue is\nliability, rather than how to manage the money. The -\nthat gets into an area that would not be subject to the\nfiduciary exceptions. So if that is the focus of the\nadvice, a private beneficiary wouldn't have to give up\nthat advice and we don't contend that the government\nshould, either. But where, as here, all of the\ndocuments are general documents that deal generally with\nhow to manage Indian trust funds -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Again, as the Chief Justice\npointed out, that seems to me an artificial distinction.\nWhat I ask from -- for from the attorney is advice as to\nhow I can manage the trust so as to avoid liability. I\nmean, the -- the two are connected. You can't separate\nout advice as to how to manage, how to manage the trust\nfrom advice as to how to avoid liability. In the -- in\nthe context of asking, of a trustee's asking advice, the\ntwo are the same.\nMR. GORDON: Well, Your Honor, at -- at some\nlogical level there is a link there that can never be\nsevered, but I submit, respectfully, that the\ngovernment, when it's getting advice about managing\ntrust funds, is not really focused on its liability.\nThe government's liability, after all, is much more\ncircumscribed than private fiduciaries, in any number of\nways.\nIt is seeking legal advice about what is the\nproper way to invest, can we do this, can we pool funds,\ncan we do -- you know, can we make a certain type of\ninvestment or is it prohibited to us. And advice of\nthat nature is advice to which the beneficiary is\nentitled.\nA private beneficiary -- the beneficiaries\nof private trusts are entitled, and Indians, whose money\nis being managed because the government has taken on\nitself by statute and said, we are going to take control\nof your monies and we're going to manage them, have no\nlesser right to get access to this highly relevant\ninformation when they litigate for breach of trust.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You make a distinction,\nI -- I take it, between attorney-client privilege and\nwork product. Initially, you were seeking both on the\ntheory that the tribe is in fact the client, but\napparently you are not pressing that point any more\nabout work product?\nMR. GORDON: In fact, Your Honor, there is\nsome case law that says the fiduciary exception can be\napplied to -- to work product. We did not press that\npoint in the Court of Federal Claims. We -- focused our\nrequest for documents on attorney-client, not on work\nproduct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So under your theory\nif there's a claim of privilege on -- on -- on the\ngovernment's behalf, presumably the district court would\nconduct an in-camera review to determine whether it was\nretrospective for liability or prospective for\nresponsibility?\nMR. GORDON: Yes, Your Honor, which is\nexactly what happened here. The Court of Federal Claims\nreviewed all of the documents in camera and made a\ndocument-by-document determination, which is, of course,\nthe standard approach when you're talking about\nattorney-client privilege. It's done on a document by\ndocument basis.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did it do -- did it do on\nthat basis, retrospective versus prospective?\nMR. GORDON: It didn't come up, Your Honor,\nbecause there weren't any retrospective wants.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There were no\nprospective, is that -- did you -\nMR. GORDON: They're all prospective, Your\nHonor. They're all prospective. The -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they -- they\ncould be retrospective, too, right? The government\nexposes itself to liability, obviously, in these areas\nas well. That's the basis for your suit, right?\nMR. GORDON: Yes, Your Honor.\nThe -- I want to pick up, I believe it was\non a comment that you made, Justice Sotomayor, when you\nsaid that under the government's theory there would be\nno need for Rule 501. And indeed, they say that it's\nnot enough. 501 on its face says apply common law\nprinciples. And the government's argument is that's not\nenough unless there's some other statute that requires\ncommon law principles to be applied to.\nNow, this is a neat trick. You just read\n501 out of the Rules of Evidence when it comes to the\ngovernment, notwithstanding that 501 itself says it's to\nbe used to determine privilege claims by the government,\nand that's reinforced in Federal Rule of Evidence 1101,\nwhich specifically says that the Rules of Evidence are\nto apply in the Court of Federal Claims.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose the\ngovernment as a whole has an obligation to act in the\nbest interests of the citizenry, right? Why doesn't the\nsame theory apply to any citizen?\nLook, government, you're supposed to -\nyou're acting in a fiduciary statute -- status with\nrespect to me. You're supposed to be acting in my best\ninterests. If you're getting advice from the, you know,\nDepartment of Justice about what to do, I'm entitled to\nget that.\nMR. GORDON: Your Honor, it -- I think that\nthat could pick up on the same distinction that the\nCourt has already drawn in Mitchell 1 and Mitchell 2,\nbetween bare trust and a full-fledged trust. The\ngovernment may have a general duty to act in the\ninterests of all citizens. Indeed, I think we would all\nagree with that. But that does not mean that the\ngovernment is engaging in the conduct of a full-fledged\ntrust with respect to citizens. It's not.\nIts relationship to citizens day in and day\nout is akin to, in fact maybe even a level below, the\nbare trust relationship that was at issue in Mitchell 1.\nSo, we're not proposing a -- a sweeping new\nrule here. It's the government that's proposing to\ntransform this Court's jurisprudence about Indians,\nbecause the notion that the only enforceable obligations\nit has are those set forth in statute or regulation,\nwere the Court to adopt that, it would be overruling its\ndecision in White Mountain Apache.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are there any\nother -- are there any other areas in which the\ngovernment's relationship to particular groups of\ncitizens is that of fiduciary to beneficiary?\nMR. GORDON: Yes, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What are some of\nthose?\nMR. GORDON: Well, the -- the principal one\nwe could find, which is cited in our brief, is with\nrespect to government retirees who make voluntary\ncontributions to their fund, and the government's\nargument here could be applied to them.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And your argument\ncould be applied to them?\nMR. GORDON: Yes, Your Honor, and I'm happy\nfor it to be. I believe it should be.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if I'm a\ngovernment retiree, I have the ability to get the legal\nadvice that whoever it is that runs that trust gets?\nMR. GORDON: Yes. I might add, Your Honor,\nfortunately it's not the Bureau of Indian Affairs that\nruns that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Does that happen a lot? I\nmean, I -- I -- I'm not -- does that happen a lot? I\nmean, are there a lot of instances where the lawyers who\nwork for all -- the retirement funds are huge. There\nmust be cases coming up all the time. And all the\nadvice of the lawyers is just available -\nMR. GORDON: Your Honor, no, frankly it\nhasn't come up that much with -- in terms of Federal\nretirees. There's the Cavanaugh v. Wainstein case that\nwe cite in our brief which is about the only published\ndecision I've been able to find.\nThe fact of the matter, I -- I was being\nhumorous a moment ago, but the fact of the matter is\nthat the government retirement funds have been, it\nappears, run quite well and there have been relatively\nfew claims brought against them. There's a reason that\nthere are a bunch of pending cases regarding Indian -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know that. I'm just\nworried about the -- the attorney-client privilege is\nsomewhat sacred, and suddenly making everything\navailable to the whole public has got me worried. And I\nlooked at that Sears case. I didn't see anything there\nthat eases my concern. And then you referred to a\ndifferent case, the name of which I forgot, and I could\nnot find.\nMR. GORDON: That's the Julian case, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that in the -\nMR. GORDON: I'm sorry, it's not cited in\nour brief.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How am I going to find it?\nI couldn't get how you spell it.\nMR. GORDON: I will -- it -- 486 U.S. 1,\n1988, Your Honor.\nThe -- there is another inconsistency in the\ngovernment's position here that I would like to\nhighlight for the Court, if I may. That is this: The\ngovernment relies on the common law in the first place\nto say it has a privilege. There's no statute that\ngives the government attorney-client privilege. So it\nrelies on common law saying: We have an attorney-client\nprivilege.\nNow, that's fine under Federal Rule 501.\nBut the government says, while it can rely on common\nlaw, Jicarilla cannot rely on that same common law to\nestablish the limits on the privilege it's claiming.\nThis Court described that sort of argument as \"heads I\nwin, tails you lose,\" and said that it can't be right.\nAnd I submit that it can't be right here. The -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The government is\nmaintaining throughout that it wears two hats. On the\none hand it is a guardian or a trustee, and on the other\nhand it is the sovereign. So it's the latter, the\ngovernment's claim that it is the sovereign, that makes\nthe difference, it's not the -\nMR. GORDON: I agree, Your Honor, that\nthat's their claim. But the government hasn't shown how\nthe fact that it is the sovereign, which we certainly\nconcede, makes any meaningful difference for purposes of\nthe issue presented here. The cases it cites establish\nthat the government, because it is sovereign, in some\ninstances has broader authority than a private trustee\nwould to help out the beneficiary. And I believe that\nthat is -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But it also has broader\nauthority, and that's just their point, I take it, for\nmany other areas. The sovereign can't easily divest\nitself of its responsibilities. A trustee can so\nconform and shape its business that it doesn't have\nconflicts. A government just can't do that.\nMR. GORDON: Well, Your Honor, I agree, but\nthe issue of conflicting, competing interests, first of\nall it arises in the private trust context and it arises\nfrequently. Anytime you've got a life beneficiary and a\nremainderman, you've got a potential conflict between\nthe beneficiaries; and this issue of conflict has led to\nthe development of the duty of impartiality for private\ntrustees; and it's discussed at length in section 79 of\nthe Restatement.\nSo the notion of competing interests is not\nunique to the government. The government may have some\ndifferent competing interests than a private trustee\nmight have. That's certainly conceivable. And if it\ndoes, the existence of a specific competing interest may\naffect whether the action that the government takes is\nor is not a breach of trust.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We're not talking here\nabout competing interests. I mean, the example you give\nof -- of the life beneficiary and the remainderman,\nthose are interests of the beneficiaries that conflict.\nMR. GORDON: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We're talking here about an\ninterest of the trustee that conflicts with what he is\nsupposed to do, with respect to the person who is the\nbeneficiary of the trust. That -- that's a totally\ndifferent situation.\nMR. GORDON: Well, Your Honor, I submit that\nit's not totally -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And ordinarily if there is\nthat kind of a conflict where the trustee has a personal\nconflict, he has to step down as trustee. You can't\ncontinue to be trustee when you -- your own financial\ninterests, for example, are against the financial\ninterests of the beneficiary; right?\nMR. GORDON: Well, Your Honor, you're\npositing that the trustee has a personal interest that's\nadverse to the beneficiary.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's what the government\nasserts: I have other duties as government besides my\nduties to the -- to these Indians.\nMR. GORDON: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And sometimes those duties\nconflict with my duties to the Indians.\nMR. GORDON: Those are competing\nresponsibilities. I agree that the government may have\nthat, and that may affect whether the decision that they\nultimately make is or is not an appropriate decision.\nBut it does not affect their duty to disclose as a\nmatter of evidence the legal advice that they use to\nmake that judgment. The beneficiary, when the\nbeneficiary's money is at stake, is entitled to see what\nadvice the government acted on in dealing with its\nmoney.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is this true regardless of\nthe fact that the government may have a very powerful\ninterest in seeking neutral, independent advice from an\nattorney, and that were you to prevail that advice would\nbecome watered down?\nMR. GORDON: Yes, Your Honor. I don't -- I\nsubmit that the ultimate balancing of interests here is\nthe same as it is for a private fiduciary. There is no\n-- the Court -- we urge the Court to affirm that under\nRule 501 Indian tribes are entitled to the same evidence\nas other trust beneficiaries about how their money was\nmanaged. That is our request of this Court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The trustee I guess\nis -- is broadly conceived of as the government?\nMR. GORDON: Yes, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, isn't the\nlawyer working for the trustee then a trustee too, an\nemployee of the trustee?\nMR. GORDON: I think that may in a\ntheoretical sense be true, Your Honor. But practically\nspeaking, there's a difference between the BIA officials\nwho are acting as the trustee and the attorneys who are\nadvising the trustee. Our claim is against the trustee.\nIt's not against the attorneys. We are not seeking to\nimpose any professional responsibilities on the\ngovernment attorneys.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nGordon.\nMR. GORDON: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Shah, you have 4\nminutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SHAH: Your Honor, if I can just make\nthree -- three points on rebuttal.\nThe first is with respect to Federal Rule of\nEvidence 501. The government is not implementing any\ntrick here. This is not a \"heads you win, tails you\nlose\" type situation. Our argument is simple. We look\nto -- we invoke a valid attorney-client privilege. The\nother side invokes a common law exception to that\nprivilege. Our argument is not that no common law\nexception is applicable to the government. It's simply\nthat the basis for this common law exception is not\napplicable, so the exception should not be applicable.\nIt's a very straightforward argument.\nThe second point I would like to make is in\nresponse to the contention that we have a full-fledged\ntrust here as opposed to a bare trust in Mitchell. I'm\nnot quite sure what \"a full-fledged trust\" means in the\nIndian trust context. Certainly there's specific\ninvestment-related duties that the statute sets forth\nwith respect to trust funds, but this Court has made\nclear in -- in Mitchell and reiterated in the Navajo\nNation decision that it's not enough for the statute to\nsimply set forth the statutory duties, but it must\ndefine, and this is a quote, \"define the contours of\nthose duties.\"\nThe statutes at issue, section 161a, 162a,\ndo nothing of the sort. They don't even set out a\ngeneral disclosure obligation, let alone the contours of\nany such disclosure obligation. But even if we were to\ndisregard this Court's precedents in Mitchell and in\nNavajo Nation, and we were to resort to the common law\nto flesh out the nature of the responsibilities, again\nthere's nothing from the discrete investment obligations\nthat are set forth in those statutes that would lead to\na general disclosure obligation, let alone an intrusive\nobligation to disclose the government's attorney-client\ncommunications.\nAnd there's good reasons to think that\nCongress did not apply such an obligation when it has\nset forth a fairly reticulated statutory and regulatory\nregime governing disclosures, and with respect to other\nstatutes. For example, the 1982 Indian Claims\nLimitation Act specifically addressed privileged versus\nnonprivileged information.\nThe last point I would make goes to the\ngeneral duty to disclose. Whether that's contingent\nsimply on payment, ownership or other factors. While it\nmay not be the case that the payment is the sole factor,\nit's certainly an important factor, and I think as my\nfriend responded in response to Justice Kennedy, if in\nfact the private trustee is paying for the legal advice\non their own, that's going to be a significant\nconsideration as to whether the beneficiary can get it.\nAnd as Justice Scalia pointed out, the lines\nare not always going to be clear between trust\nadministration advice and liability advice. In fact,\nthey're often going to run into one another.\nBeyond payment, I think the even more\nimportant factor here is the ownership of the records.\nWhile payment is indicative of ownership, when we're\ntalking about the government context, payment is not the\nonly reason why we say that the government owns the\nrecords that result from legal advice or any other trust\nadministration facet. That's set forth by statute and\nregulation, the Federal Records Act, and the Interior\nDepartment regulations that are set forth in the\nappendix of the brief. The reason why I think -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If I -- if I pay -\nif I pay a lawyer to prepare a document for me, is\nthat -- I do own that document or does the lawyer?\nMR. SHAH: I think as a general -- I think\nas a general matter, one would think that the client\nwould -- it would belong to the client, at least in the\nsense that the client would have full access to that\ndocument.\nAnd I think that's a fundamental distinction\nhere, that we're not -- because the -- these are\ngovernmental records, they're subject to the statutory\nand regulatory regime that governs disclosure of\ngovernment documents, either specific disclosure\nobligations set forth by Congress, Interior Department\nregulation or the more general Freedom of Information\nAct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But aren't you\nconfusing, just following up on the Chief Justice's,\nownership with access? FOIA itself doesn't make these\nrecords less -- the government doesn't own them less\nmerely because FOIA requires them to share it with other\npeople. So the ownership interest is not the defining\nlegal obligation.\nMR. SHAH: You're absolutely correct. The\nfact that they're accessible by FOIA does not -- does\nnot change the government's ownership of those records,\nbut the fact that Congress is able to set forth a scheme\nlike FOIA is turned on the fact that these are\ngovernment records that are owned by the government.\nBecause they're government records, it's\nCongress and it's the Interior Department that decides\nwhen to disclose them and under what circumstances to\ndisclose them. The tribe's rule here would eviscerate\nthat very reticulated statutory and regulatory regime.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Shah,\nand Mr. Gordon.\n"
