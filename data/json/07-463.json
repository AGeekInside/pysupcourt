KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Ninth Circuit's affirmance of a\nnationwide injunction in this case is contrary to\nbedrock principles of Article III standing, of the\navailability and scope of judicial review under the\nAdministrative Procedure Act, and the granting of\nequitable relief. As this case was decided by the\ndistrict court and as it comes to this Court, it\ninvolves a stand-alone challenge to two regulations that\ngovern the procedures to be followed by the Forest\nService in deciding whether to approve individual\nsite-specific activities in national forests.\nThe two regulations provide that\nsite-specific actions that are excluded from either an\nenvironmental impact requirement or even an EA under\nNEPA are also not subject to special noticing and\ncomment and administrative appeal provisions applicable\nto the Forest Service. The Ninth Circuit sustained the\ndistrict court's nationwide injunction as to those\nprocedural regulations standing alone, not as part of a\nchallenge to a specific site-specific activity.\nThe court did so, moreover, on the basis of\nan affidavit from one member of one of the organizations\nwho could not begin to establish standing under this\nCourt's decisions by showing an imminent injury by\nvirtue of harm to a site-specific activity; and the\nCourt affirmed the nationwide injunction applicable to\nall forests with respect to all projects listed in ten\ncategories identified by the district court, including\nnational forests and projects that don't even -- that\nare not even included within that one declarant's\ngeneralized interests in certain natural forests.\nFor the multiple combination -- combination\nof multiple reasons, we think the Ninth Circuit's\ndecision cannot stand.\nFirst, as with respect to standing, the one\ndeclaration on which both the district court and the\ncourt of appeals rely is the declaration of Mr. Bensman,\nwhich is reproduced in the petition appendix. And on\npage 70A and 71A are the only allegations of -- that go\nto injury at all with respect to the particular\nregulations at issue here from paragraph 15 on to -- the\nbottom of 71A on, those are allegations concerning other\nregulations that are no longer at issue.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Standing itself, I mean,\nit's a little unusual. Suppose -- I mean, Congress here\nhas passed a statute and the statute specifically aims\nat a class of litigants. And it says to the class of\nlitigants, if you are a member of it, we are telling you\nwhat we want the agency to do and that is to promulgate\na certain appeal procedure.\nNow, if you are a member of the class that\nfrequently litigates and you frequently take advantage\nof that procedure, why aren't you heard as a litigant,\nat least enough for Article III? And we know as far as\nprudential standing is concerned, Congress wanted to\ngive you standing, so I think would it take care of\nthat.\nAre you saying no matter -- that just normal\nlitigants in the courts who reappear time and time again\nin certain kinds of cases, don't have standing to\nchallenge a procedural rule, if Congress under Article\nIII and Congress specifically tells them they can?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Congress has not specifically\nsaid that they may challenge --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Let's imagine that Congress\ndid, Congress did say: By the way, lawyers who have\nhandled 17 tort cases in the last year where the value\nhas been more than $500,000 and who will sign an\naffidavit saying they intend to continue in that branch\nmay appeal from the court's promulgation of the\nfollowing general rule, dah, dah, dah. And that\nConstitution prohibits Congress from doing that?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, first of all, I don't\nthink it could be lawyers. It has to be a party.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right. Those who -- fine,\nforget that, yeah.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think there would be\nsubstantial doubt that Congress could do that, because\nlet me explain why, and this goes to a point that\nJustice Scalia was making in the prior argument.\nProcedural wrong is not Article III injury.\nThe injury in this case comes from the application of\nthe regulation in a specific site-specific --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You mean Article III and at\nWestminster -- at Westminster, when Westminster,\nwhatever they had, they must have had some procedural\nrules, and sometimes they had general procedural\nrules -- I don't know what the history is; I could look\nit up. But I would be amazed if the lawyers at that\ntime or the clients who had certain cases were not\npermitted to challenge those rules as contrary to some\nother rules.\nDo we know the answer to that?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, if -- if Congress --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In a particular case, I\nsuppose.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. Generally.\nBecause you have a special procedure, here's what you\ncan generally challenge our rules.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, if I could make, again,\nseveral points. Congress has not passed such a statute.\nAnd there may be room in particular situations for\nCongress to pass a special statute that would identify\nparticular interests that could then be taken into\naccount in terms of whether Article III standing would\nbe established.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay, then your answer is,\nif Congress says you can do it, have a general\nchallenge to people who generally appear, your answer is\nif Congress says they could do it, Article III doesn't\nstop them?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, I -- what I said, that\nwould be a different question.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Ah. What's the answer to\nthat different question?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, it might depend on a\nparticular -- it might depend on a particular case. In\nthe Whitman case the court says that the statutes\nproviding for direct review of regulations eliminate\nprudential limitations on ripeness in that case, but\nthey wouldn't eliminate the bedrock principle of\nstanding. It would be necessary to show a threatened\ninjury. Now, it --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Kneedler, don't we have\nto assess the need for -- for showing a specific\nthreatened injury on a -- on a somewhat elastic standard\nin a case like this? Because the claim is made on the\nother side that if we do not allow, if we do not find\nstanding to challenge the regulation per se, there are\ngoing to be a number of specific instances which in\npractical terms can never be challenged when that\nregulation is applied.\nThere were one or two instances, as I\nrecall, of cases in which on your theory there could be\nno challenge because the announcement of the action was\nmade on the very date that the action was taken. So\nthat if we do not find sufficient elasticity and\nstanding to allow a challenge to the regulation on\nbehalf of people of the sort that Justice Breyer\ndescribed, there will, in fact, be a preclusion of any\nchallenge to a lot of specific actions.\nWhat's your answer to that?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Several answers if I may. In\nthe declaration on which standing was based in this\ncase, that claim is not made. And that is the only\ndeclaration that was made -- that was submitted before\nthe district court entered its judgment. There was an\nargument made like that after, after the fact.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Assume for the sake of\nargument that it is made in this case.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Okay. Then --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What should you respond?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It is conceivable in a\nparticular case that a person who -- who claims to be\ninjured by that could sue to prevent that injury, but it\nwould not be a challenge to the regulation as\nregulation. It would be because specific, threatened,\nsite-specific activities in which there would not be\nnotice given in advance or there wouldn't be -- wouldn't\nbe time, threatened to injure them. It would again be a\nchallenge to the application --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But your response to that\nis going to be, I presume, that in fact, absent a\nspecific activity before the court, the -- the challenge\nis not ripe. So that if you are going to stick to your\nposition elsewhere in this case, they are going to fail\nin that enterprise.\nMR. KNEEDLER: And -- and -- and that may --\nthat may well be right, but that would be a separate\nquestion.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand -- I\ndon't understand your response. If -- if someone has an\ninterest in -- in stopping a particular action that\nwould be governed by -- by -- by this general\nregulation, surely that person could -- and is -- is --\nis threatened proximately by that action, that person\ncould certainly bring an action seeking to stop the\naction on the ground that this regulation is invalid.\nMR. KNEEDLER: That was my -- that was my --\nand that was my point.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that would govern that\nparticular action, but it would also be -- be precedent\nfor invalidating the regulation in other cases. I --\npresumably other courts would -- would similarly say\nthat the regulation is invalid.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right. And that was the\npoint I was trying to make. And if I -- if I could\nexplain -- if I could explain the same point --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask -- may I ask\nthis one follow-up question, because I want to be sure I\nunderstand your position. Supposing the plaintiff in\nhis declaration cites three or four cases in which the\naction was taken so promptly they didn't have notice in\norder to object. And then he says but so -- they -- all\nthis was too fast for me. Now I want to -- want to do\njust what the plaintiffs are trying to do in this case.\nWould he have standing then?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I -- I -- if there was -- if\nthere was a category of cases in which that was likely\nto happen. Most of the -- most of the -- he may well\nhave standing in that situation to challenge maybe an\nupcoming -- it's an unusual APA suit because -- because\nonly final agency action can be challenged, but\nconceivably a threatened final agency action --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You would agree that with\nthat scenario he would have standing if his only injury\nin this is exactly the same as the plaintiff in this\ncase?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. The injury would come\nfrom the threatened on-the-ground activity, not the\nactual --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: He doesn't know that in\nadvance. That is the premise of Justice Stevens's\nquestion, and it is the premise of mine. There -- the\npoint is being made by them that this happened so fast\nthat the threat has been realized before they could\nrespond to it.\nMR. KNEEDLER: If -- if I -- if I could make\na broader point here because there -- there may be\ncertain categories, certain instances in which that\nmight happen, but it is -- it is the exception, not the\nrule. And -- and the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I will -- I will assume for\nsake of argument it is the exception, not the rule.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let's assume we have got\nthe exceptional case. Would there be standing?\nMR. KNEEDLER: In -- in the exceptional case\nthere probably would be standing.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So that if in\nJustice Stevens's hypo one could show that there had\nbeen three or four or five instances of action so fast\nit was impossible to challenge it, there would with that\nas a predicate be standing to challenge the regulation\nas these people are trying to challenge it?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Not -- no, and that -- and\nthat was the point I was --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- not -- not in the way they\nare trying to challenge it, because they are trying to\nchallenge it across the board.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Tell us how they could\nchallenge it, then? Tell us the right way?\nMR. KNEEDLER: What they would have to do is\nbring a -- a -- on a -- a particular national forest\nwhere a particular person visited and visited a\nparticular area and there has been a pattern of\nparticular activities that occurred without his knowing,\nhe -- he -- in that situation he might well have\nstanding to challenge a similar --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if it's the forest\nnext door that he is worried about and they have not\ntried a -- a -- a kind of quickie lumbering action in\nthe forest next door before, he would not be able to\nchallenge it.\nMR. KNEEDLER: That's correct. The -- the\n-- standing has to focus on the particular site-specific\nplace where the individual has visited and if there is a\nrepeated pattern of a similar type of activity that he\ndoesn't know about and maybe --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler, why -- why\n-- why is that so? I am reading this ARA statute, and\nit seems to give people a right to notice, an\nopportunity to comment, and to undertake an\nadministrative appeal.\nWhy isn't this statute that says, interested\npublic, you have those rights, you have essentially a\nright to a seat at the table, why isn't this statute\nlike FOIA, like the statute that the Court considered in\nthe Atkins case, in the FEC case involving information\nabout APAC?\nThese were people who said: We are\nconcerned about saving our forests. That's why Congress\nsaid that before these actions occur, there should be\nnotice to the interested public, comment, and we are\nbeing cut out from that seat at the table. It doesn't\ndo us any good after the project has been authorized.\nWe want to be there when the decision is made to take\naction.\nMR. KNEEDLER: If I could respond in several\nways. First of all, the due process clause imposes\nlimitations on agency action, but that doesn't mean that\n-- that somebody can go into court and challenge agency\nprocedures as violative of the due process clause until\nthere is a specific proceeding going on and -- and\ncompleted in which there has been a violation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But this statute says\nsays before there is a specific action you have a right\nto notice, comment, and administrative procedures.\nMR. KNEEDLER: There is no indication at all\nin the passage of that statute that Congress meant to\nconfer a judicially enforceable right to obtain those\nwithout complying with the usual APA provisions for\njudicial review.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Maybe he has no --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose the statute says\nanybody in the country can sue to stop a violation of\nthe due -- due process clause. Would that statute be\nvalid?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. You -- you would have to\n-- you would have to show a particular injury and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The Article III\nrequirements cannot be eliminated by Congress?\nMR. KNEEDLER: That is -- that is correct.\nAnd -- and there is no indication at all that in this\nstatute, which was just intended to modify the Forest\nService's intent to change its internal decision-making\nprocesses -- and Congress wanted to restrict what --\nwhat the Forest Service was going to do -- that it\nthereby meant to change the fundamental nature of the\nagency's own internal regulations which would not --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is that different\nfrom FOIA? I mean there anybody can request anything.\nYou don't have to show anything beyond -- well, you only\nhave to show curiosity. You say: The statute gives me\na right to ask for this information.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well -- and the -- the Forest\nService has -- has procedures for notifying people of --\nof proposed projects that were in fact invoked in this\ncase, and we point this out in our brief. There are\nreally two separate types of procedures.\nOne is the so-called Schedule Of Proposed\nActions, which includes all the actions in which there\nwould be a decision memo issued by the Forest Service,\nwhich includes at least all of the projects that\nrespondents are claiming should be -- should be covered.\nThat is published quarterly. It -- it is available on\nthe web. It is also available in person. One of\nRespondents' declarants here on behalf of the Sierra\nClub says that by using that so-called SOPA, that\nschedule, he reviews every project in all 11 national\nforests in California. There is also, in addition to\nthe SOPA -- and will submit comments when necessary.\nIn addition to the SOPA, the Forest Service\nhas what are called scoping regulations which -- in\nwhich every on-the-ground project is looked at to see\nwhether it needs -- there needs to be NEPA compliance\nthrough an EA or an EIS, but also what is the nature of\npublic participation that is required.\nIn that scoping process the Forest Service,\nthe -- the local personnel at the Forest Service, will\nlook to see who is interested in the particular project.\nThe way this works on the ground is an organization like\nthe Sierra Club through its declarant in the -- in the\njoint appendix will have somebody monitoring this SOPA,\nthe Schedule of Proposed Events, and will say: I see\nthat you have a -- a certain project listed. I am\ninterest in that. Please notify me when you are about\nto take action to thin this -- this area or restore this\nburned area. Please notify me.\nWhen that happens, the Forest Service then\nsends out a letter, a so-called scoping letter, asking\nfor comments. So this is not a situation in which the\n-- the organizations of the declarants in this case have\nbeen excluded. To the contrary, these are all people\nwho pay very, very close attention to what the Forest\nService is doing.\nThe one declarant on which the court of\nappeals relied for standing on page 71a of the -- of the\npetition appendix, he specifically refers -- the only\nspecific projects he refers to are timber projects, and\nthe injunction here goes much broader than timber\nprojects -- but he said that for example, in the\nAllegheny National Forest they put out scoping comments\nfor a series of 20 timber sales. He knew about those\ntimber sales and he was able to comment on them. And\nthe -- the declarants on whom the standing was based to\nchallenge the Burnt Ridge Project, which is no longer in\nthis case, in that case the Forest Service -- and this\nis in the administrative record -- sent out 1,300\nletters to people who had expressed an interest in that\nproject before it was undertaken. Mr. Marderosian, who\nalso monitors forest projects --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could any one of those\nhave brought suit?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Anyone -- anyone who claimed\nto have used that area could have brought suit. Some of\nthe -- some of those -- some of the people -- people\nsubmit comments.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I mean -- but the\nletter alone, I don't know what the criteria were for\nthe addresses.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Those were people who had\nexpressed an interest in the -- in the project.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, okay. Okay.\nMR. KNEEDLER: And Mr. Marderosian submitted\na 23-page comment to the Forest Service with respect to\nthe Burnt Ridge Project, and that is the other\ndeclarant. These are people whose profession or\navocation -- serious avocation is following the Forest\nService. So this is not an instance in which -- in\nwhich notice is not generally furnished.\nI would like to make the same point I was\nmaking about standing in connection with the -- with the\nAdministrative Procedure Act as well. Section 702 of\nthe -- of the APA says that a person who is aggrieved by\nagency action is -- may seek judicial review thereof.\nThe -- the agency action that is subject to judicial\nreview has to be the agency action that causes the\ninjury. The procedural regulation does not cause the\ninjury. It is the on-the-ground activity, the\nsite-specific decision -- the action, the agency action\napproving the site-specific action that causes the\ninjury. That is what the person is entitled to judicial\nreview on.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then you are saying that\nthis statute is just unenforceable, because the statute\nis supposed to operate before the project?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It's -- it's -- it's by no\nmeans unenforceable. In the Burnt Ridge Project that\nwas at issue in this -- in this case, the plaintiffs\nchallenged the Burnt Ridge Project when it was completed\non a number of grounds, that it was not properly\ncategorically excluded from NEPA, that it didn't comply\nwith the forest plan, but also that it had been approved\nwithout complying with the -- with the ARA appeals\nprocedures.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that was before\nthe project was undertaken?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. An injunction, a\npreliminary injunction was obtained, and tellingly, and\nI think this is also instructive for ripeness purposes,\nthere was a PI issued but not because of a violation of\nthe -- of the ARA; the district court concluded there\nwas a likelihood of success on some of these other\nobjections, substantive objections to the project, not\nprocedural objections --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Ah, but --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- and enjoined it and then\nthe Forest Service went through the project and the --\nand the plaintiffs dropped their challenge.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I am pursuing this, but\nI'm actually having a hard time with this. Suppose --\nsuppose Congress passes a statute; the statute says\nevery citizen of the United States has a right to\nreceive notice of a certain set of Forest Service\nactions. Everybody. We want everybody who wants it to\nhave notice.\nNow, if somebody really wants that notice\nand they don't get it, can they sue?\nMR. KNEEDLER: At some point that would\nbegin to look like FOIA, yes. But --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Sorry.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But --\nJUSTICE BREYER: In any case, I'm trying to\nmake it look like FOIA.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's just what I am\ntrying to do, and you say yes, they probably could, at\nleast if you are just supposed to get a piece of paper\nthat says \"Notice.\" Now suppose Congress says, if you\ncan show you are the kind of person who regularly asks\nand needs such notices, and if a regulation is\npromulgated interpreting this statute, you can challenge\nthat reg prior to enforcement. Now does that violate\nArticle III?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I believe it -- I believe it\nprobably does, unless you can show that there is an\nimminent --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose they did this.\nSuppose they said each agency has the legal power to\npromulgate regs interpreting FOIA as to when you get the\nthing, and when you don't, and moreover people who are\nregular FOIA requesters can challenge those regs prior\nto enforcement; what about that one?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Conceivably. But I -- what\n-- what I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I am looking for a\nprinciple that is going to help me.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Congress has not done that\nhere and this is why I wanted to shift to the APA,\nbecause this is subject to review under the general\nstandards of the APA. Even if we can assume that there\nwould be Article III standing to challenge a\nthreatened -- a threatened, another one in a series of\nsimilar projects like off-road vehicle use or something\nwhich might occur before someone would be able to -- to\n-- to challenge it, that doesn't apply to timber\nprojects and other things that take much longer to plan.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Kneedler, I don't even\nagree with you that a -- that a citizen-wide notice\nprovision confers standing, because it's close to the\nAPA.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, I didn't say --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Close -- close to the FOIA.\nIn FOIA, an individual citizen demands a certain\ndocument which the law entitles that person to. This is\na concrete deprivation --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of something concrete.\nAnd --\nMR. KNEEDLER: I didn't -- I didn't -- I\ndidn't mean to concede that there would be standing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I thought you were\ndoing it. And I certainly don't --\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, because you are right.\nAnd here the agency's procedures allow somebody to\nrequest to be put on the mailing list about a particular\nproject. And that's the way you make it -- make it\nknown and in fact that happened here. And also the one\ndeclarant -- it's perhaps instructive, the only other\nkind of notice other than this sort of situation where a\nperson says I want to be notified when a particular\nproject is going -- is going to take place, the only\nother form of notice is publication in a local newspaper\nof record that each national forest has which shows that\nthis is -- that this notice provision is localized with\nrespect to people who are going to be aware of what's\ngoing on in the forest and who are following it. But\nthe declarant Mr. Bensman, when -- for another purpose\nis noticing or is pointing out this publication\nrequirement in a local newspaper, says that his\norganization doesn't want to subscribe to local\nnewspapers, that would be too much of a burden for them\nto have to follow what is going on in newspapers.\nThat's the -- that's the only kind of\nadditional notice the statute ever provides for. The\nother kind of notice is the notice you get if you\npreviously expressed an interest in the project, in\nwhich you basically demanded something along the FOIA\nlines that Justice Scalia was referring to.\nBut again, back to -- back to the -- you\ncall it ripeness, you call it the proper subject of\njudicial review as this Court said in National Wildlife\nFederation, based on section 702 of the APA, ordinarily\na regulation may be challenged only when it has been\nreduced to manageable proportions by a concrete\napplication of the regulation to the individual's\nparticular circumstances. It's the application to the\nperson's circumstances that gets challenged. In this\ncontext, it would be the application of the regulation\nthat says there is no right of appeal in connection with\nthe approval of a site-specific activity. If you think\nthe project was approved in violation of the ARA because\nyou weren't given a right -- after you got your notice\nyou weren't given a right to appeal, then you could\nchallenge that in court on the ground that it was\napproved without following the agency's procedures.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your friend on the\nother side says that that doesn't make too much sense\nbecause the issue in every case is going to be the same,\na purely legal issue, and so waiting for the application\ndoesn't make any sense.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I don't think it is a\npurely legal issue. The Respondents concede that not\nall projects are subject to this statute, and the\ndistrict court --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The question is where do\nyou draw the line?\nMR. KNEEDLER: And that -- that's why it\ncan't be purely a legal question. As soon as you -- and\nthe district court acknowledged that environmentally\ninsignificant projects are not covered by the act, and\nso that requires them an as-applied determination as to\nwhether a particular type of project or even the\nparticular project is one that is -- that is covered by\nthe act. And not only that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that you said\nthe government's position is that the line is to be\ndrawn for cases that don't require either an EIS or an\nEA. Those -- in those cases you don't have to do this\nnotice, comment, appeal thing. And I thought the other\nside is saying, no, that's the wrong place to draw the\nline. It would be the same thing in every case, from\nthe government's point of view, no environmental impact\nstatement, no environmental assessment required, no\nnotice and comment. And they are saying you put the\nline in the wrong place.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But -- but that doesn't\nanswer where the line ought to be. And even if the\ngovernment is wrong as to a particular project, that\nmeans the line has to be somewhere else. It may be that\ncertain kinds of timber projects should be subject to\nappeal but that doesn't mean that some other road\nmaintenance project should be subject to appeal.\nIf I may reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nKneedler.\nMr. Kenna.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MATT KENNA,\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. KENNA: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court.\nThis facial challenge to the Appeals Reform\nAct regulations could have been brought outside the\ncontext of the Burnt Ridge Project, as long as we had\nshown that it had been applied to a project and\ncontinued to be applied to the plaintiffs on an ongoing\nbasis.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if there -- what if\nthere was not a regulation on this subject, but the\nagency, by its constant practice, applies a certain\nprocedure in all of these cases, would you have it --\nthe power in the abstract to challenge the agency's\nconsistent application of a certain procedure?\nYou could certainly do it in a particular\ncase, if the agency did something that was unlawful, you\ncould certainly challenge it? But let's assume you\ndon't have a particular case, you just object to the\nfact that in all of its cases the agency is doing this\nthing that is wrong.\nWill you have standing to challenge that?\nMR. KENNA: The question of rightness in\nstanding need to be treated a little differently for\nthat. As far as the rightness question I think it would\nbe a much more difficult case than here, but I would\nthink could you do that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You would have standing?\nMR. KENNA: You would have to show, as Your\nHonor is indicating --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Your complaint is I don't\nlike the way the agency behaves?\nMR. KENNA: Not on that pure basis. No.\nYou would have to show that -- or we would have to show\nsome concrete harm from where it's been applied.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you make a\ndifference with respect to the regulation? Why does the\nmere fact that this agency lawlessness happens to be\nreflected in a regulation, why does that suddenly alter\nthe standing calculation? You either have been harmed\nor you haven't been harmed.\nMR. KENNA: Justice Scalia, I don't think it\nchanges the standing calculation. I think it does\nchange the rightness and final agency action especially\nquestion somewhat, makes it much more clear. But we\ndon't rely on procedural injury here. Even though I\nthink there is potentially room for it along the lines\nof Freedom of Information Act.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The Ninth Circuit\nrelied on it at least as an alternative ground, correct?\nMR. KENNA: Well, I think what the Ninth\nCircuit did was similar to what the court did recently\nin the Winkelman v. Parma School District case where\nmost of the discussion was about the procedural harms\nthat the parents of the autistic school children were\nsuffering. There was only one brief sentence tying it\nto the concrete harm, but it did tie it to the concrete\nharm. And I think that's what the Ninth Circuit did\nhere. And certainly the district court very much went\ninto tying the procedural harm to the on the ground\nharm, and that's what it based its decision on.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, to read\njust one sentence to you from the National Wildlife\nFederation case, because I think it's the biggest hurdle\nyou face. It's on page 15 of the government's brief.\nIt says: \"A regulation is not ordinarily consider the\ntype of agency action ripe for judicial review under the\nAPA until the scope of the controversy has been reduced\nto more manageable proportions and it's factual\ncomponents flushed out by some concrete action applying\nthe regulation to the claimant's situation.\"\nIt seems like a high hurdle for you to\nsurmount.\nMR. KENNA: Mr. Chief Justice, I think that\nneeds to be read in combination with the footnote 2 to\nthat decision, which says of course if you have a\nregulation applying a particular measure across the\nboard --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's the Abbott\nLabs exception, isn't it? I don't think anybody\nsuggests that that is applicable here.\nMR. KENNA: No, I don't think that's the --\nI think the Abbott labs exception is an exception to\nwhere the plaintiff cannot show that the regulation has\nbeen applied to its situation yet.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's when his\nprimary conduct is nonetheless going to be affected?\nMR. KENNA: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You know, the drug\ncompanies have to do something. Well, they don't -- you\nknow, they have to do it before they can -- they don't\nhave to wait until they are sent to jail to say that\ntheir conduct has been affected.\nMR. KENNA: Yes. But I think where as here\nthe regulation has been applied to the plaintiffs on an\nongoing basis, it's conceded that it was applied\nthousands of times nationwide.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you have not\npointed to a particular fact under any of these\naffidavits when it was applied to any of the plaintiffs.\nIn what the National Wildlife Federation case said,\n\"Some concrete action applying the regulation to the\nclaimant's situation. \"\nMR. KENNA: We have the Burnt Ridge Project\nitself. And then once we have shown standing, it\nbecomes a matter of mootness.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You haven't shown\nany standing with respect to the Burnt Ridge Project on\nan ongoing basis because that has been settled. It's\noutweighed -- it's out the door.\nMR. KENNA: Right. I think the court's\ninitial standing analysis is at the time the complaint\nis filed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's in for a\npenny, in for a pound. If you show standing with\nrespect to discreet action D, you can challenge A, B,\nand C?\nMR. KENNA: No, Your Honor, I would\nrespectfully say that the focus is on the beginning.\nAnd then as the -- as this Court said last term in Davis\nv. FEC, then it becomes a matter of mootness, and\nbetween that case and the Laidlaw case, that is a lower\nhurdle. So once we had the standing -- and the\nMarderosian declaration is worth looking at, because it\ntalks about harm from the Burnt Ridge Project itself,\nwhich the government concedes, as well as from\napplication of the regulations to be denied notice,\ncomment and appeal throughout the Sequoia National\nForest.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I think you never completed\nyour answer in commenting on the National Wildlife\nFederation statement with reference to footnote 2. What\nis it that footnote 2 tells us in light of which we must\nread what the Chief Justice quoted?\nMR. KENNA: Well, the footnote 2 says, of\ncourse, if you have a particular regulation applied to a\nparticular -- to a category of circumstances across the\nboard, of course you may challenge it. And I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that all it says? No, I\nthink it speaks of categories across the board that\naffect -- that immediately, concretely affect the\nperson complaining of the regulation, which is the case\nin these areas where you have a regulation requiring\ndrug companies to have certain -- on pain of criminal\npenalty to print certain things on labels. That\nimmediately affects them.\nI think that is what footnote 2 is about,\nnot about -- not about any regulation that is across the\nboard. That wouldn't make any sense.\nWhere is footnote 2. Let's read it.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KENNA: There is many cases where it was\nnot an effect on primary conduct yet a facial challenge\nwas permitted. In fact, this Court has never rejected\nbefore a facial challenge to a regulation that is\npublished in the Code of Federal Regulations where it\nhas been applied on an ongoing basis.\nSo, in Sullivan v. Zebley, it was child\ndisability benefits, it was a benefit referring\nregulation, which said we see no reason to force as\napplied challenges instead of a facial challenge.\nYou have Thomas v. Union Carbide, which was\nnot a regulation telling Union Carbide how it had to\nmanufacture its pesticides, but rather how it would\naffect arbitration -- it's arbitration when it got into\ndisputes, which is like National Park's case, which was\nheld unright not because of that fact, but because it\nhad not yet been applied.\nWhen you look at all of these cases that\nrejects facial challenge where either the regulation has\nbeen applied and has not -- and then the court gets to\nthe question of whether it affects primary conduct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The problem they are asking\nyou on this -- it was at least a problem for me -- I\nthink it's tough on rightness is because the government\nis saying here: Look, you want to challenge it outside\nthe context of a particular action that you don't like.\nWell, there's never going to be an action, never going\nto be such an action that we are going to take that you\nwon't find out about, that you will not be able to\nchallenge in that context if you are really hurt. There\nisn't one. You can't name one that's ever been or\nimagine one that ever will be, okay?\nNow, is that so?\nMR. KENNA: No, Justice Breyer, that's not\nso. The joint appendix at page 101 discusses an\ninstance where Mr. Bensman did not get notice at all.\nThe issue with --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You see where they are\ngoing next. And if you -- suppose that the thing you\njust told me, too, has problems or suppose it's pretty\nhard to find one, then the -- why this has never been\ndecided and why it's difficult. Because I would start\nwith Abbott Labs and say there are three considerations.\nHow easy is it now to solve the legal problem? Here?\nPerfectly easy. Nothing's going to change.\nFactor two, how likely is it that they will\nwork with this legal rule and change it around here?\nZero.\nBut three, what kind of harm is it going to\ncause to the plaintiff if you were to deny him relief\nnow? And they are saying here that's also zero or next\nto zero. So what do you do if the factor that cuts one\nway is zero and the factor that cuts the other way is\nzero, or near zero?\nNow, I have to admit I have never seen a\ncase on that. I don't know if there has been one\nbefore, and I don't know exactly what to do. And if you\ncan go read the appendix, maybe I can escape the zero.\nMR. KENNA: Well, I think even apart from\nthe appendix, even apart from the assertion that there\nare -- the fact that there are certain actions that will\nreceive no notice, I think the fact of the matter is we\ndid what the court has instructed us to do, and that is\nwe brought a facial challenge in a concrete example with\nthe Burnt Ridge timber sale project. Now, it's passed.\nNow it becomes a question of mootness, and I think the\nmootness question is easier to solve because the Court\nhas said that it's a lesser hurdle than standing, and we\nhave shown through the Bensman declaration that it's\ncontinuing to be applied to the plaintiffs on an ongoing\nbasis, that they suffer harm by not being able to get\nthese procedures which caused them on-the-ground harm\nbecause the forest is not protected as well as it would\nbe with it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I now have\nfootnote 2, and it refers, as you say, to a particular\nmeasure that applies across the board to all individual\nclassifications. It goes on to say, which is final,\n\"and has become ripe for review in the manner we\ndiscussed in the text.\" Then we say, or Justice Scalia\nsays, \"it can of course be challenged under the APA by a\nperson adversely affected. And although that may have\nthe effect when they get a general decision invalidating\na program, it says that a quite different from\npermitting a generic challenge to all aspects of the\nprogram as though that itself constituted a final agency\naction.\"\nSo you still have to become ripe for review\nin the manner discussed, which was the sentence that I\nread to you earlier, and the challenge can only be\nbrought by a person adversely affected. I don't see how\nfootnote 2 undermines the sentence I have read to you at\nall.\nMR. KENNA: Well, in that footnote, it's\nsaying it's quite different from permitting a generic\nchallenge to all aspects of the land-withdrawal review\nprogram. And I think that was the problem in Ohio\nForestry, where you had this broad program left with\nfacts to sort through and apply, but the opinion in Ohio\nForestry said, of course, though, if the plan had cut\nout someone's right to object to trees being cut, that\nwould be the kind of action that would be challengeable.\nAnd so I think what that later part is talking about, in\nNational Wildlife is saying, this isn't the kind of\naction we allow challenges to. It's not final agency\naction. It's not --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it says -- it\nsays, if it's become ripe for review in the manner\ndiscussed in text. In other words, if it has been\napplied to a particular individual adversely affected\nthen, quote, \"a person adversely affected may bring a\nchallenge. \" And I don't -- that seems to me to be a\nrestatement of the sentence I read you earlier.\nMR. KENNA: But that gets us to the standing\nquestion. And here the Marderosian declaration showed\nhe was affected both with regard to the Burnt Ridge\nProject and other projects on the Sequoia National\nForest. We have the Bensman declaration that talks\nabout how he was harmed in his local forest from not\nbeing able to comment on timber sales, and we have the\nsubsequent declarations.\nAnd I would also point out in the Lujan v.\nDefenders case, both in the note 8 and Justice Kennedy's\nconcurrence, there's a discussion about how, in\nRobertson v. Methow Valley, for instance, a standing\ndeclaration didn't even need to be raised because it was\nobvious that, in that case, that the plaintiffs were\namongst the injured because they were a local group in\ntheir local forest.\nYou know, here we have an assertion\nuncontroverted by the government that these are being\napplied on every forest on an ongoing basis -- it's\nstipulated to that. To contend that the Sierra Club is\nnot injured, especially in light of the declarations\nthat we've submitted --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That would be like\nin footnote 2, the general program. Yes, they are\nsaying these types of activities we don't do the notice\nand comment and appeal. That's the general program.\nBut you have to wait until it's applied to a particular\nindividual who is adversely affected.\nMR. KENNA: Well, all I can say, Your Honor,\nis I thought we did that by bringing it in the context\nof the Burnt Ridge sale and then it's a matter of --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If you had had a ruling\non where you draw the line in the Burnt Ridge case, then\nthat would have been precedent for all these other\ncases, but it was settled, right, so you didn't get a\ndetermination?\nMR. KENNA: Yes, Your Honor, we never\nbrought an as-applied challenge to these regulations in\nthe context of the Burnt Ridge sale.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you are seeking a\ndifferent line. And, by the way, I don't know what the\nline is that you are seeking. But the government says\nif you don't need an EA, then you don't have to give\nnotice, comment, et cetera. What would be your standard\nfor when you need notice and comment?\nMR. KENNA: Well, it's right in the language\nof the Appeals Reform Act. There are two parts that are\nimportant. One is, it says, \"a proposed decision\nimplementing a forest plan shall be made subject to\nnotice and comment.\" And then section C states that\n\"any decision approving such an action shall be subject\nto appeal.\" So you have two elements: That there is a\ndecision approving something and it implements a forest\nplan.\nNow, that's the way it worked under the\nForest Service before the Appeals Reform Act was passed\nand what Congress meant to keep in place substantively\nwith a different procedure through the ARA. So a\nChristmas tree permit, for instance, an original\nChristmas tree permit is exempt, not because it's\ninsignificant. We've never conceded, and that's what\nthe whole merits were about, that it's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You need a permit to have a\nChristmas tree? Where is this?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KENNA: I'm sorry, Your Honor. So if\nyou want to go and cut your own Christmas tree --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I know what you're talking\nabout.\nMR. KENNA: You know, I get one every year.\nI just go down to the local Kreger's hardware store; I\npay my $7 to the clerk. There's no exercise of\ndiscretion, and you can you go and cut your own tree.\nNow, that is exempt, not because it's environmentally\ninsignificant, which, you know, it probably is in most\ncases, but because there is no decision approving it.\nAnd that's the way it has always worked, and that's\nwhere we think the line needs to be drawn, although, of\ncourse, the merits were not raised by the government\nhere.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You cut down a tree\nin the national forest without approval?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KENNA: I did get the permit, Your\nHonor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KENNA: I think the other kinds of cases\nthat are useful to look at are, for instance, Blum v.\nYaretsky for standing, and that was the nursing home\ncase where nursing home residents that had been denied\n-- they had been sent to lesser nursing home facilities,\nthey were on assistance -- challenged the way in which\nthat was being handled. And the Court said, you know,\nthe historical basis for these plaintiffs is that they\nhave been denied their -- they have been in these\nsituations and it's perfectly likely that they are going\nto be in again. Another case would be the Northeastern\nFlorida Chapter of Contractors v. Jacksonville case,\nwhich I am afraid we did not put in our brief, but that\nwas where victims of reverse discrimination had been\nregular bidders on construction contracts, and they were\nheld to have standing because it was obvious they were\ngoing to suffer these harms again and there was not even\na discussion of the declarations. Here, we --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's not unusual. I\nmean, standing looks not just to harm that has already\nbeen suffered but to harm that is imminent. And if\nthese people are regular bidders and they say, you know,\nI'm likely to bid on this next project, that's fine.\nBut these people are -- you don't know any specific\nproject. They are just people interested in forests\nthroughout the United States.\nMR. KENDALL: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's quite different from\nsaying, \"I am about to suffer harm, imminent harm, to\nme.\" I don't see anything -- you know, anything except\nin the case that was settled that has that kind of a\nconnection.\nMR. KENNA: Well, Justice Scalia, I would\nsuggest that the way those two cases I discussed the\nplaintiffs were treated is similar to here, where you\nhave members who -- it's uncontroverted that they are\nconstantly using the national forests and commenting on\nforest appeals. And we have a reference to 20 specific\ntimber sales. They weren't mentioned by name, but it's\nalways been this Court's jurisprudence to elevate form\n-- I mean, elevate substance over form -- so it's not a\ncreative pleading exercise that can either get you in or\nout of standing; it's a commonsense inquiry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Tell me the two cases again\nthat you are relying on for this.\nMR. KENNA: Blum v. Yaretsky, and that we\ncite in our brief; and then Northeastern Florida Chamber\nof Contractors v. Jacksonville. That's a 1993 case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And what's that? What's\nthe cite for it?\nMR. KENNA: 508 U.S. 656 1993.\nNow, getting back to the ripeness issue in\nparticular, as we go through the list of cases, it seems\nthat the facial challenges have always been permitted in\nsituations similar to this. The key question is, has it\nbeen applied? So National Parks Conservation\nAssociation hasn't been applied. No prediction that it\nmight be applied, therefore not ripe. Thomas v. Union\nCarbide, I think, is particularly instructive because\nthere the case preceding that was held unripe because\nthere had not yet been an arbitration under the federal\ninsecticide law. But by the time the case came to the\nCourt, there had been an arbitration that had passed,\nand on that basis the Court said yes, this is a ripe\ncontroversy because here it's been applied, and there\nwas no finding of mootness even though that arbitration\nwas done, and that's the same situation that we have\nhere.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can I go back to standing\nfor a minute.\nMR. KENNA: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You may have looked this up\nand may have found something here.\nSuppose an organization that has a purely\nideological interest, so it can't get into Federal\ncourt, nonetheless can go before an agency; but they are\nnot going to get into Federal court. Now, suppose that\nagency then has a reg that they think is lawful and\nmakes their life more difficult. I guess that the fact\nthat they suffer a procedural injury would not get them\ninto court. They are already somebody who doesn't; they\ndon't. So I can imagine cases saying that.\nContrast that with the case with a person\nwho has a very concrete specific injury, a terrible\nallergy to chemical X, and they often litigate that\nthere is too much chemical X, and now they are before an\nagency and they frequently complain about chemical X,\nbut they don't have a particular case, but they will\noften be there. Now, the agency promulgates a\nprocedural regulation that hurts those people who\nnormally have a concrete injury. All right? There I\nwonder if that purely procedural injury cannot serve as\na basis for standing.\nNow, do the cases ask -- so I am contrasting\nthe two kinds of questions, and I wonder what you found\nin the cases as to the second kind, as opposed to the\nfirst kind; and you are free to answer this as one word\n\"nothing; go look it up yourself, which is a fair\ncomment.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KENNA: Well, Justice Breyer, you know,\nof course our case is not that typical because we think\nwe have on the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You think you are like the\nsecond?\nMR. KENNA: Right. I think there is room\nunder the -- so the FEC v. Atkins cases is the\ninformational injury case. Then there is the Havens\ncase which stated that groups that sought to fight\nredlining in loaning for -- discriminatorily loaning in\nneighborhoods had organizational standing, not\nrepresentational as we claim here through our members,\nbut actual representation in and of themselves. And I\nthink when you combine those cases together, I think\nthere is some room for that finding that there is that\ninjury.\nBut I would -- I would point out here that\nthe -- we don't claim it, and even though the court of\nappeals, again, talks quite a bit about it, it\nultimately tied it back. And even if it didn't do a job\nthat this Court found to be sufficient, I think the\nfocus really has to be on the district court, as that is\nwhat originally looked at the declarations and did a\nvery good job of discussing the on-the-ground injuries\nsuffered combined with procedural injuries.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask you about\nNortheastern Florida? I have dug that out. I don't\nthink it -- it supports what you say. In its complaint\nwhat was going on here is that there was a -- a minority\nbusiness preference adopted by the City of Jacksonville,\nand some contractors who were not minorities sued saying\nthat this was in -- in violation of the Constitution.\nAnd what happened -- what the Court said\nabout standing was in its complaint petitioner alleged\nthat many of its members regularly bid on and perform\nconstruction works. Now, if it had stopped there it\nmight fit your case, but then it went on to say, \"and\nthat they would have bid on designated set-aside\ncontracts but for the restrictions imposed.\"\nAs I read the case there were designated\ncontracts, of which they said we would have bid on them\nbut we didn't because of this -- what the case involved\nwas the assertion by the city that you don't have\nstanding unless you can show you would have been awarded\nthe contract. And we said, no, no, you don't have to be\nawarded it, but if indeed you were -- you would have\nbeen a bidder in that contract but for this law, that's\nenough for standing.\nSo that's not this case.\nMR. KENNA: But I think the record supports\nthe same kind of assertion. So, for instance, if you\nlook at Tim Bensman's declaration at page 71a of the\npetition appendix, it says how on those timber sales he\nwould have commented and appealed them if he was given\nthe opportunity, and he would like to go back there if\nhe could preserve the quality of those areas that he\nvisited.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And where is\n\"there\"? He would like to go back where?\nMR. KENNA: He would like to go back to the\nareas in -- where those 20 timber sales are, some of\nwhich he had been to before and would like to return to.\nAnd I -- and the supplemental declarations, when this\ncame up again and the government pressed, because they\nasked for more specifics, those specifics were provided.\nAnd so, for instance, at the joint appendix\nat page 90 you have Eric Wiberg using the Weiser River\ndrainage and talking about he wasn't going to get notice\nof that. Only because he happened to be personally\nfamiliar with the area was he able to communicate his\nviews to the Forest Service, and it actually ended up\nchanging what the Forest Service did because he just\nhappened to find out and he happened to know it. So\nthat's a specific --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This isn't one of\nthose after-submitted declarations, is it?\nMR. KENNA: That -- that latest one I\nreferred to is. Yes, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, don't we\ngenerally not look at after-submitted declarations in\ndetermining standing?\nMR. KENNA: Your Honor, I don't think that\nis correct. I think the Court can look at any documents\nin the record which show standing at the time of the\nsuit.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if you -- if\nyesterday you submitted a declaration, we would look at\nthat?\nMR. KENNA: Well, the cases that the\ngovernment provided for rejecting declarations were\noffers submitted to this Court or certainly an appellate\ncourt and I agree that is more problematic, or it would\nhave been more problematic if the district court had\nexcluded the documents and said it's not going to look\nat them. We would be looking at an abuse of discretion\nstandard as was at issue in Lujan v National Wildlife\nFederation. But certainly when a, an appellate court\ntakes up a record from a district court it is entitled\nto look at all the evidence submitted and especially\nwhen it's a case like standing -- or an issue like\nstanding where it's a constitutional question that is\nimportant and you may look at all the circumstances --\nthere is no reason to reject a later filed declaration.\nBut again, we don't rely on those alone. We\nthink it's the totality of everything that supports --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The later filed,\nwhere along the district court proceedings were they\nfiled?\nMR. KENNA: They were submitted -- after the\njudgment setting aside the regulations, there was\nlitigation over the government's stay motion pending\nappeal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if you lose that\nagain, you figure, well, I've got some more -- I can get\nsome more declarations. The reason we don't look at\nafter-submitted declarations is because there has to be\nunder the normal rule, an end to litigation at a\nparticular time. It seems to me this would be an\nendless process. You know, every time the district\ncourt identifies a particular flaw, you would say okay,\nhere's a declaration, and then they say, well, here's\nanother basis, well, here's another declaration. I'm\nnot sure that that's what our cases sanction.\nMR. KENNA: Well, the -- the district court\ndidn't find a flaw. It found that we had standing. It\nwas -- the government reiterated its standing argument\nin the context of the stay. This essentially opened the\ndoor by arguing again, \"hey, you have no standing,\" in\naddition to \"we should get a stay because of the\nequities.\" And so it seems perfectly appropriate in\nthat circumstance to submit additional declarations. We\ndidn't just file them out of the blue because we\nthought --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You filed them after\njudgment, right?\nMR. KENNA: We did. But they -- I think\nalso the issue is there's been the many decisions of the\nCourt which say, you know, standing after the fact isn't\ngoing to do you any good. And what I think it's\nimportant to keep clear here is that the declarations\nwere later filed, but they referred to events going on\nbefore the judgment came down.\nSo, we have declarations at the time of the\ncomplaint, very specific; the government concedes they\nare very specific; they talked about both the Burnt\nRidge sale and the regulation. We have the Bensman\ndeclaration at the time of the merits consideration,\nwhich showed the case was not moot, that he was still\nbeing subjected to these regulations and being denied\nnotice and comment. And then we have additional\ndeclarations after the fact of the government -- I'm\nsorry of the district court's decision, which buttressed\nall of the above.\nAnd it seems appropriate under that\ncircumstance in light of the statements by the Court\nthat I discussed in the Defenders case and elsewhere,\nthat standing is a practical inquiry, that standing\nshould be found in such circumstances.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you want to say a word\nabout the Ninth Circuit making a law for the entire\nnation, on a controversial question that normally the\ncourt would just rule for its own area?\nMR. KENNA: Well, I think there is a\ndifference, Your Honor, between setting aside a\nregulation under the Administrative Procedure Act and\nwhat would normally be some sort of nationwide\ninjunction such as where you had, say, challenged a\nlocal timber -- local forest service district for not\nanalyzing NEPA correctly, and the Court not only set\naside that action but said, and \"oh, by the way anywhere\nelse in the country that's doing it like this, you are\nenjoined, too.\"\nI think it's a very different question where\nyou have a regulation that's being challenged under the\nAPA. And it's always been the Court's assumption that\nsetting aside a regulation, which the APA commands a\ndistrict court to do, also using its discretion, means\nthat it is set aside without geographic limitation. And\nso I think, you know, the Ninth Circuit may have said a\nbit much to saying it was compelled by the text of the\nAPA but I do believe the district court properly weighed\nthe Mendoza interests.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. KENNA: Thank you, Your Honors.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Kneedler, you\nhave three minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER,\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. KNEEDLER: Several points, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nFirst, the Burnt Ridge Project illustrates\nthe way that we think an issue like this should be\nresolved and shows why the sentence from National\nWildlife Federation that you quoted, Mr. Chief Justice,\ndisposes of the case, and that is that a regulation --\nparticularly a procedural regulation whose only\nrelevance is in an agency proceeding for approving a\nsite-specific activity -- that can only be challenged in\nconnection with that site-specific activity. That's\nwhat the sentence in National Wildlife Federation was\ndriving at; that is what Section 702 says; when you can\nchallenge the agency action that aggrieves you and that\nis consistent with what the Court said in National\nWildlife Federation, that a -- a court should intervene\nonly when and to the extent that someone is harmed.\nThis regulation can only harm someone in connection\nwith --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That is not what it says.\nIt says this is our ordinary practice it doesn't say\nit's the limit on our practice.\nMR. KNEEDLER: He was talking about\ninjunction. I was talking about --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I thought you were talking\nabout --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- ripeness under the APA but\nit ties in -- it ties into the injunctive relief if I\njust could address that for a moment.\nInjunctive relief is -- is discretionary and\nSection 702 of the APA says nothing in the statute limit\na court's ability to deny relief on appropriate\nequitable grounds. And this is best illustrated by the\n-- suppose a regulation was challenged by the defendant\nin a criminal conviction and the plaintiff says the\nregulation is invalid on its face. The APA says set it\naside, but surely the district court dismissing that\nindictment would not be setting aside the regulation on\na nationwide basis. The effect of a declaratory\njudgment even one rendered in the course of dismissing\nan indictment, if you call that a declaration, is -- is\ngoverned by the law of judgments, not by -- not by a\ncourt reaching out and extending its ruling to people\nand forests and projects that are not before -- not\nbefore the Court.\nAnd the Burnt Ridge Project shows the way in\nwhich this could be challenged. A particular project\nwhere there was not an appeal, if someone wants to\nobject to the project on that ground or any other\nground, he -- he can challenge that project, and there\nmay be other grounds on which that project might be\ninvalid which is an additional reason not to anticipate\na legal defect but to -- but to wait until it's applied.\nThe final thing I wanted to say is about the\nclaim of procedural injury and that this might be like\nFOIA or something like this. I think it's instructive\nthat the -- that the ARA is not written in terms of\nconferring rights on individuals. It's a direction to\nthe Forest Service to prepare a -- to establish an\nappeal mechanism, in other words, do what the agency\nnormally does to establish procedures for administering\nthings. There is certainly nothing in the text that\nsuggests that it was intended to confer the\nextraordinary sort of right of immediate access to the\ncourt for purely procedural grounds. It was just meant\nto fine-tune the agency's own internal administrative\nprocedures, which Section 706 of the APA makes clear can\nonly be challenged in a challenge to the final agency\naction in which the procedures are applied.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you Mr.\n"
