        "content": "(11:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Whorton versus Bockting.\nGeneral Chanos.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE J. CHANOS\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. CHANOS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nCrawford v. Washington should not apply\nretroactively to cases on collateral review because it\nfails to meet the exacting standards for retroactivity\nestablished by this Court in Teague versus Lane. In\naddition, respondent is not entitled to relief under\nAEDPA. Teague held that new rules of criminal generally\nshould not apply to cases on collateral review unless\nthey fall within one of two narrow exceptions. The\nsecond exception, at issue here, is for those new\nwatershed rules of criminal procedure without which the\nlikelihood of an accurate conviction is seriously\ndiminished, rules that alter our understanding of the\nbedrock procedural elements essential to a fair\nproceeding. Crawford is not a watershed rule of\ncriminal procedure.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Could you give an\nexample, General Chanos, of one that is other than\nGideon? Is there any other one, or --\nMR. CHANOS: The only example that this\nCourt has pointed to in its 25 years of retroactivity\njurisprudence is Gideon versus Wainwright.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And none other occurs to\nyou?\nMR. CHANOS: None other occurs to me at this\ntime. None of the cases that this Court has ruled are\nnot retroactive would I find to be retroactive or\nwatershed, and I certainly don't find Crawford to be\nwatershed. Crawford is not watershed because it is not\na rule without which the likelihood of an accurate\nconviction is seriously diminished and it is not a rule\nwhich altered our understanding of the bedrock\nprocedural elements essential to a fair proceeding.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I take it from your\npresentation you think we do have to go through the\nTeague analysis. We can't just rely on 2254(d)(1)?\nMR. CHANOS: No, Chief Justice Roberts. I\nbelieve that you could go straight to 2254(d)(1) and bar\nrelief under 2254(d)(1).\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well then, what do\nyou do about 2254(e)(1), or I guess (e)(2), which seems\nto suggest at different rule if a case is made\nretroactive?\nMR. CHANOS: Well, 2254(e)(2) provides a\ncause and prejudice opportunity in the event that the\nstate court denies relief on a procedural basis rather\nthan a substantive basis and the petitioner can show\ncause and prejudice under 2254(e)(2)(A). The Federal\ncourt could then look at the petitioner's claim because\nno merits determination had been made by the state court\nand, finding the cause and prejudice elements under\n2254(e)(2), the Federal court would not be precluded\nfrom making a merits determination since the -- and\nconceivably applying a rule that had been made\nretroactive active under Teague -- because the state\ncourt had not made a substantive merits determination.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, my point was\nthat looking at (d)(1), it says is the decision contrary\nto established law. And I would have thought that if\nit's a new decision it's clearly not contrary to\nestablished law.\nMR. CHANOS: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But on the other\nhand, you look at (e)(2) and it says here's what you do\nif you're applying a new decision that's that been made\nretroactive. So I would have thought that meant you\ncan't say simply because it's a new decision it won't\napply.\nMR. CHANOS: Our reading of 2254(d)(1) is\nthat Congress intended to have the federal courts give\nthe state courts deference to the extent that the state\ncourts made a substantive determination. If the state\ncourts made no substantive determination, there's no\nrequirement for deference by the Federal courts, which\nunder 2254(e)(2)(A)(i) the Federal court conceivably\nfind that there was cause and prejudice under\n2254(2)(a)(i) under the standards enumerated in those\nsubparagraphs (a) and (b) and could then make a merits\ndetermination.\nThere would be nothing that would preclude\nthe Federal court from making a merits determination so\nlong as the state court had not already made a merits\ndetermination.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, suppose the state\nhas, which is going straight to AEDPA. Does that mean\nthat Teague is out entirely, even the first category,\nthat is a decision, a substantive decision that would\nmean that what defendant did was not a crime?\nMR. CHANOS: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. It\nwould mean under -- under a plain meaning reading of\n2254(d)(1), if the state court made a determination on\nthe merits, it would bar subsequent Federal review\nwhether it was a substantive, a substantive claim or a\nprocedural claim. However, in Atkins v. Kentucky there\nwould be nothing that would prevent the petitioner from\ngoing back to the state court and arguing cause and\nprejudice, and then if the state court were to make a\nprocedural determination on the second petition that\nwas -- that were to deny the petitioner his claim, he\ncould take that to the Federal court. The Federal court\ncould then look at that because it was only a procedural\ndetermination by the state court on the second habeas\nclaim and the Federal court at that point could look\nback at the substantive rule as established law because\non the second claim they have the right, if he's only\ndenied a procedure -- on a procedural basis, there's\nnothing that would preclude the Federal court on his\nsecond claim from looking back at what would then be\nestablished law.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What is the source of the\nrule in Teague? Could Congress overturn the rule in\nTeague if it wanted to and say that nothing is\nretroactive or that everything is retroactive?\nMR. CHANOS: My understanding is that the\nrule in Teague is -- the source is not the U.S.\nConstitution. It's a judicially created rule that began\nwith Linkletter and developed into Teague and its\nprogeny. And yes, I believe Congress could pass\n2254(d)(1) and alter the habeas procedures, as they have\nin enacting 2254(d)(1).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Habeas is an equitable --\nMR. CHANOS: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Habeas is equitable relief\nand the Court has a lot of discretion in identifying the\nboundaries of equitable relief, doesn't it?\nMR. CHANOS: Yes, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I assume that's how we got\nto Teague.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask this question\nas to the basic issue of whether you should be relying\non Teague or the statute. If you're relying just on the\nstatute, how would it apply to a case which was correct\nunder established law at the time that the state court\nmade its ruling, but before the case reached the\nappellate court, in which there was a change in our\ninterpretation? What if this case -- if Crawford had\nbeen decided while the case was on appeal?\nMR. CHANOS: While under the Court's\nretroactivity jurisprudence Griffith would control,\nunder 2254 it would not. 22(d)(1) would control.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So it really makes a\ndifference whether we rely on Teague or whether we rely\non the statute if we disagree with you?\nMR. CHANOS: It make difference. It makes a\ndifference.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I assume there would\nbe a Rule 60(b) motion or the equivalent of it in state\ncourt.\nMR. CHANOS: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If indeed our law had\nchanged; don't you think?\nMR. CHANOS: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it's inconceivable\nthat the problem wouldn't be solved in some fashion by\nthe state court that rendered the decision.\nMR. CHANOS: I believe that the petitioner\nwould be able to make a subsequent habeas petition at\nthe state court level and if they were somehow denied\nrelief on a procedural basis, there would be nothing\nthat would preclude the Federal court from granting them\nrelief thereafter.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's a odd position to\ntake, to proliferate proceedings that way. I mean, I\nthought your argument, AEDPA argument, was: Too bad,\nthe Federal court is out of it, but the state court is\nmost likely, recognizing that this Court has said what\nthis man did wasn't a crime, to grant him relief. But\nif you're making this two-step and saying, but somehow\nwe can change the substantive proceeding into a\nprocedural proceeding, that seems to me odd, to\nproliferate proceedings that way.\nMR. CHANOS: Justice Ginsburg, what we're\nsaying is that Congress in enacting 2254(d)(1) was\nstating that the Federal courts should give deference to\nthe state court decision so long as it is a merits\ndecision and so long as it complies with existing\nclearly established law and is not unreasonable.\nAnd if that occurs, then Congress under\n2254(d)(1) was saying give state courts deference under\nthose circumstances.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying not just\n\"clearly\"; \"then clearly established law.\"\nMR. CHANOS: That's exactly.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That is, at the time of the\nstate court decision. *END STENO\nMR. CHANOS: Exactly, absolutely, at the\ntime of the state court decision. In fact, if you look\nat the language of 2254(d)(1) it says \"resulted in a\ndecision that was contrary to or an unreasonable\napplication of clearly established Federal law. It\ndoesn't say \"is contrary to clearly established law.\"\nIt says \"was contrary to.\"\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The word was is somewhat\nambiguous. It could either mean at the time of the\ntrial court's decision or at the time of the final\njudgment on appeal.\nMR. CHANOS: Well, in either case, it is\nreferring to the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I know you win under\neither view, but --\nMR. CHANOS: Yes, exactly.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- it could mean either of\nthose two things.\nMR. CHANOS: Our, our position would be that\nit would be up to when the decision became final.\nWhatever the law was up to the time that the decision,\nthe state court decision became final, that is what was\nclearly established law.\nI'll continue with our Teague analysis\nbecause we believe that the claim is barred under either\nanalysis. The --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Crawford did use the term\nbedrock?\nMR. CHANOS: Yes. Yes. And what\nCrawford -- what we believe Crawford was saying -- well,\nCrawford said that the Sixth Amendment right to\nconfrontation is bedrock. It didn't say that that\ndecision altered our understanding of the bedrock\nprocedural elements essential to a fair trial. That is\nthe standard. Not whether or not the Sixth Amendment is\nbedrock.\nIn fact, if you look at the case of Gideon\nversus Wainwright and Betts versus Brady, in Betts\nversus Brady this Court had held the Sixth Amendment\nright to counsel was not applicable to the states\nthrough the 14th Amendment. Gideon overruled Betts\nversus Brady and said that the Sixth Amendment right to\ncounsel was applicable to the states under the 14th\nAmendment.\nThat alters our understanding of the bedrock\nprocedural elements that are essential to a fair trial.\nIn one case, we're saying rights of counsel is not one\nof those bedrock procedural elements. Is not,\ntherefore, applicable to the states under the 14th\namendment, Betts versus Brady. In the next case we're\nsaying right to counsel is it implicit in the\nConstitution. It is an essential to the fairness of a\nproceeding, and it is therefore applicable to the states\nunder the 14th Amendment.\nThat truly alters our understanding of the\nbedrock procedural elements that are essential to a fair\ntrial.\nIn contrast, when you look at Crawford\nvis-a-vis Ohio versus Roberts, the -- there's a real\ndistinction there. In both cases, we know that the\nright to confrontation is essential and Federal and one\nof those bedrock elements that are essential to a fair\nproceeding. Therefore Crawford doesn't alter our\nunderstanding of what elements are or are not essential\nto -- bedrock elements essential to a fair proceeding.\nInstead it modifies the contours --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You make the same analysis\nif you say the right is not necessarily the right of\nconfrontation but the narrower right of\ncross-examination.\nMR. CHANOS: Would I make the same analysis?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Because that is central to\nCrawford.\nMR. CHANOS: Yes. Yes. Crawford doesn't\ntell us that the rights to confrontation or the right of\ncross-examination is a new right as Gideon tells us.\nInstead Crawford tells us --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, there is a new\nemphasis on cross-examination.\nMR. CHANOS: It alters, it modifies the\nmanner in which we implement that right. Under Ohio\nversus Roberts there was plenty of cross-examination\nthat was occurring. The standard under Ohio versus\nRoberts was unavailability and inadequate indicia of\nreliability. There was a reliability screen in place,\nand it was clear under Ohio versus Roberts that the\nright to confrontation was an essential bedrock right,\nessential to a fair trial.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly. But you know, how\nyou play the game depends upon at what level of\ngenerality you describe the right. And I agree with you\nif you describe the right as the right to\ncross-examination, that -- that was -- reinstituted by\nCrawford, which said that the confrontation right is a\nright to confrontation -- to cross-examination, which\ndidn't exist before. I mean, you could dispense with\nthat right of cross-examination if there were indicia of\nreliability.\nMR. CHANOS: Well, there were --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure that you can\nso -- in such a facile fashion decide what is a bedrock\nprinciple. Frankly, I don't know any formula that\nwould -- that would describe it. I really think it is\na -- you know it when you see it.\nMR. CHANOS: Well, Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is like obscenity.\n(laughter.)\nMR. CHANOS: I understand. The other point\nthat --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That gets, if you follow\nJustice Scalia's argument, that gets you to, I think to\nthe argument you have made. And that is all right, we\nhave got to look at it pragmatically. I mean, what are\nthe consequences of following a reliability model rather\nthan a cross-examination model? And your argument is\nconsequences that are not necessarily more favorable to\ndefendants, in fact -- or more productive of ultimately\nreliable determinations, in fact. And that I take it is\nyour basic point.\nSo I think you've answered what for all of\nus is a problem. And that is we don't have a clear\nanalytical definition of bedrock; but if we look to\nconsequences, you have got an argument. Your friends\ndon't think it is a good one, but that's your point.\nMR. CHANOS: The other point is that there's\na second component to watershed which is it must be a\nrule without which the accuracy of a proceeding is\nseriously diminished. There was cross-examination under\nOhio versus Roberts. There -- in Crawford, the language\nof Crawford isn't a sweeping indictment of -- of\nRoberts.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, there wasn't\ncross-examination by defense counsel.\nMR. CHANOS: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In this case there wasn't\ncross-examination by defense counsel. Or am I\nincorrect?\nMR. CHANOS: There was cross-examination of\nthe mother, there was cross-examination of the police\ndetective -- there was cross-examination of --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, oh. No, I mean of the\nwitness.\nMR. CHANOS: Not of Autumn -- not of Autumn\nBockting. But the important point that I want to make\nbefore I reserve the balance of my time is that the\nquestion isn't simply, is Crawford accuracy-enhancing?\nThe question is is it a rule without which the accuracy\nof a proceeding is seriously diminished. In other words\nmust all --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- accuracy-enhancing then?\nMR. CHANOS: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It's a question about how\nmuch more accuracy-enhancing, if at all?\nMR. CHANOS: That, and it is really an\nanalysis of Roberts. Is, is that judicial determination\nof reliability under adequate indicia of reliability, so\nfundamentally flawed that all of the decisions that\nwere, that were arrived at pursuant to its authority\nmust be undone, and new trials must occur with respect\nto those decisions because it is so fundamentally\nflawed. And our point is that it is not. It does not\nrise to that level of inadequacy and Crawford is\ntherefore not a rule without which the accuracy of a\nproceeding is seriously diminished.\nMr. Chief Justice, may I reserve the balance\nof my time?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you General\nChanos.\nMr. Gornstein, we will hear now from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN, ON BEHALF OF\nTHE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING\nPETITIONER\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court.\nCrawford does not satisfy either of the two\nrequirements for a retroactive watershed rule. The\napplication of Roberts rather than Crawford did not so\nseriously diminish the likelihood of accurate\nconvictions as to require the wholesale reopening of\nconvictions that were final before Crawford was decided,\nwith all the societial costs that entails.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Since you barely\ncite AEDPA, I think you assume we need to reach the\nTeague question before the AEDPA question.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, we do not\nhave an interest in the AEDPA question because it does\nnot apply to Federal convictions, the 2254(d)(1), and\nthere is no Federal conviction analog to 2254(d)(1), so\nwe are not telling you that you should or should not\nreach it. We just don't have an interest in that\nquestion.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It is law that is\napplied in Federal court, though. I assume you have an\ninterest in that.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Well, we have a general\ninterest in the way law is applied in Federal court but\nwe do not ordinarily opine on issues just on that basis\nand we haven't in the past opined on AEDPA issues unless\nthey have some Federal analog carryover effect. And we\ndid not here.\nNow with respect to the reliability prong of\nthe Teague analysis, there are three reasons that the\nRoberts rule did not so seriously diminish the\nlikelihood of accurate convictions as to call for\nretroactive application of Crawford.\nThe first is that Roberts had a built-in\nreliability screen. Hearsay could not be admitted under\nRoberts unless a determination was made that there were\nparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\nThe second reason that Roberts did not\nseriously diminish the likelihood of accurate\nconvictions is that there were other procedural\ncomponents that operated in tandem with Roberts to\npromote accuracy. They included the right to\ncross-examine the witness through whom an hearsay\nstatement was introduced, the right to introduce your\nown evidence to challenge the reliability of the hearsay\nstatement. Defense counsel could point out to the jury\nall the weaknesses in the hearsay statement and the\ndefendant could count on the common sense of the jury to\nweigh the reliability of the hearsay statement in light\nof all the evidence in the case.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Can't you make that argument\nabout any, about cross-examination in general? It is\ndebatable whether -- how good cross-examination is in\ndetermining the truthfulness of a witness's testimony.\nNow, our Constitution decides the issue one way, but any\ninfringement of cross-examination could be susceptible\nto the same argument that you are making.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Yes. And I don't think that\nthis is a self-sufficient argument for that reason. It\nis just one component of the argument about why there\nwas reliability. The fact that there was a Roberts\nscreen on reliability is an additional factor that\ndistinguishes my example from what you said.\nAnd the fact is that there was a right to\ncross-examine live witnesses here. So there was a right\nto cross-examine the police officer through whom this\nhearsay statement was made. It is not a case where\nthere was an across-the-board denial of any\ncross-examination.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well I guess you're asking\nus to say Crawford, get one, take one, it is really not\nthat important. If that's so, I suppose we shouldn't\nhave overruled Roberts.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: No, I think Crawford that is\nan important decision. But if you made retroactive\nevery one of your important decisions, you would be\nreversing the rule of Teague. What Teague says that is\nthere is not -- that the purposes of habeas corpus are\nlargely exhausted once somebody has received a trial in\naccordance with then existing law.\nBecause of the importance of finality to the\nsystem -- and there are only going to be two very --\nthere's only a very narrow window for watershed rules,\nof rules that, the accuracy of proceedings beforehand\nare so seriously diminished that there is an\nunacceptably large risk that systematically, innocent\npeople were being convicted, and that this is a rule\nthat approaches Gideon in its fundamental and sweeping\nimportance. Those are the only circumstances in which\nthe Court is going to go back on finality.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How many times have we\ndealt with a quote, \"new rule,\" with the argument made\nthat it was watershed and therefore should be\nretroactive? This is not the first time.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: No, I think that there have\nbeen -- I don't know the exact number, but maybe 11 or\n12, about half of which are ones, are proposed new rules\nand half of which are ones where the rule was already\nestablished previously and the question was whether it\nwas going to be made retroactive. And I cited in the\nbrief there are three or four death penalty cases where\nthe Court had already established before each one of\nthem there was a right not to be -- the death penalty to\nbe arbitrarily imposed. And in each case there was a\nnew rule that built on that basic rule in an important\nway; but in each case, the Court said it was not the\nkind of rule that was going to be applied retroactively.\nAnd so, too, here.\nThe third reason I wanted to give about why\nthere was not a serious diminishment in accuracy that is\nin at least one respect, the Roberts rule actually\npromotes more accuracy than the Crawford rule, and\nthat's with respect to non-testimonial hearsay. In the\ncase of non-testimonial hearsay, under Roberts, that\ncould come in only if determination had been made there\nwere particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\nWhereas under the Crawford rule, that kind of\nnon-testimonial hearsay comes in without any reliability\ncheck under the Constitution at all.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's not this case.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Well there was actually in\nthis case the mother's testimony about what the daughter\nsaid to her.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm talking about the\ndaughter's testimony.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Yes. The daughter's\ntestimony about what she said to the mother illustrates\nthe difference, because that came in through the mother.\nIt only came in because there was a particularized\nguarantees of trustworthiness to that statement; whereas\nunder Crawford in future trials, statements to the\nmother -- which are not testimonial -- they will come in\nthrough the mother without any screen for reliability\nunder the Constitution at all. So in that respect, the\ndefendant here got more by virtue of the Roberts rule\nthan by -- than he would have had by virtue of the\nCrawford rule.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that the case in Federal\ncourts, too?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Well, it is a matter of\ninterpreting -- what protection is left is only going to\nbe by virtue of the residual hearsay rule. So there\nwill have to be some determination made about whether\nthere are sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it is conceivable\nthat Federal courts would interpret the hearsay rule to\nrequire precisely that anyway.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: But Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In which case you shouldn't\nbe making this argument because it applies only to state\ncourts.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: No. I think it applies\nequally to Federal courts because it is free to the\nFederal court system to devise a rule that would allow a\nlooser standard of entry than the Roberts standards, and\nif it did, that would be constitutional. So there is an\ninterest in that kind of argument in the Federal system.\nI wanted to move on to the bedrock aspect of\nthe inquiry, which is a separate second inquiry that had\nthreshold that has to be crossed if you are going to\nfind something to be watershed, and the only rule that\nthe Court has found to be bedrock is Gideon. And this\nrule, Carawford does not approach Gideon in its\nfundamental and sweeping importance, and there are a\ncouple of reasons for that.\nFirst, the right to counsel pervasively\naffected all aspects of the criminal trial whereas this\nfocuses on one limited -- the admissibility of one\nlimited category of evidence, testimonial hearsay, and\nadopts a somewhat new rule for that than had existed\nbefore.\nThe second thing is that under, the right to\ncounsel is deemed so essential to a fair trial that\ndepriving someone of that right can never be discounted\nas harmless error, whereas Crawford errors can be\nharmless. There are a significant number of cases where\nthey are found to be harmless. So you cannot say that a\nviolation of the Crawford rule always and necessarily\nresults in an unfair trial, whereas you can say that\nabout the right to counsel.\nFinally, the Gideon rule established for the\nfirst time a right to free counsel in all felony\ncriminal trials. Before Crawford was established, there\nwas a right to cross-examine. It simply was a different\nright. You had a right to cross-examine the live\nwitnesses and you had a right to screen out\nuncross-examined statements unless they met the\nreliability standard of Roberts. And the change that\nwas made was one in which the Roberts rule was thrown\nout, and you can no longer get in uncross-examined\nstatements with a determination of reliability.\nBut that is a modification or an incremental\nchange in an existing right that previously existed to\ncross-examine, and instead -- unlike the Gideon rule,\nwhich established the right to counsel for the first\ntime.\nIf the Court has nothing further.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Gornstein.\nMs. Forsman?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANCES A. FORSMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. FORSMAN: Thank you very much, Mr. Chief\nJustice. Members of the Court:\nThis man was sentenced to life in prison\nbased upon accusations that have never been tested by\nthe only constitutionally reliable test that is now\nacceptable in this Court. There is no question that the\nstatements that were admitted through the police officer\nwere testimonial. There is no question that if\nMr. Bockting were tried today, that those statements\nwould not have come in.\nThe government has argued that the\nreliability screen, so-called, that came from Roberts\nwas sufficient, and it was only an incremental change\nwhen the Crawford decision was decided. The fact of the\nmatter is that this Court found that the reliability\nscreen that the government has discussed was\nfundamentally flawed.\nAnd in this case, comparing the right to\ncounsel to the right to cross-examination is easy. It\nis easy because it would not have mattered how many\nlawyers Mr. Bockting had. It would not have mattered if\nhe had the finest lawyers in the country. It would not\nhave mattered if he was Duke Power Company and had every\nlawyer at the highest hourly rate representing him. If\nhe was unable to cross-examine his accuser, just as in\nCrawford -- in Crawford, there was even an audiotape of\nwhat the wife said. There was an audiotape. There was\na police officer who listened to what she said. And\nthis Court found that wasn't good enough.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we didn't say in\nCrawford, I don't think we said in Crawford -- I ought\nto know, I suppose.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that the new rule\nproduced greater accuracy. We said that it was the view\nof the framers of the Constitution that\ncross-examination, confrontation in that sense, was\nnecessary for greater accuracy.\nNow in our evaluation of what constitutes a\nlandmark decision, are we bound to the framers' view of\nthings? I mean, you know, maybe -- I'm not sure that if\nyou apply a proper interpretation of indicia of\nreliability under Roberts, I'm really not sure whether\nit wouldn't be more accurate than confrontation, but\nthat wouldn't matter to me, because confrontation is\nwhat the Constitution required and what the framers\nthought were necessary.\nAm I bound, for purposes of the rule we're\narguing about here, to what the framers think?\nMS. FORSMAN: No, Your Honor, you are not\nbound to what the framers think. However, I think that\nyou went far beyond simply saying that this was like\nquartering soldiers in discussing the confrontation\nclause and the right to confrontation. The opinion goes\ninto at length why the Roberts rule was so fundamentally\nflawed. You talked about the kinds of decisions that\nwere produced, although this Court said that this Court\nhad pretty much tacked to the same direction as the\nframers' view.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think that discussion of\nthe, you know, the contrary decisions that had been\nproduced under Roberts was just for the purpose of\njustifying the overruling of a case that -- you know --\nthat was not that old. It hadn't worked out as well as\nwe maybe expected it would. But I don't think it was\nfor the purpose of showing that it always produces\nunreliable results.\nMS. FORSMAN: And I don't think that our\nburden would to be show that it always produces\nunreliable results. I think that this Court has clearly\ntaken the position that the only constitutional\nreliability is the right to cross-examination. However,\nthroughout your retroactivity jurisprudence, you have\nbeen able to distinguish easily between issues such as\nthe exclusionary rule, the right to a cross-section of\nthe community on a jury, and the right to\ncross-examination. I would point out to you, the\ndecisions that made Bruton, for instance, retroactive,\nbecause the right to cross-examination went so directly\nto the integrity of the fact-finding process.\nI think that one of the major difficulties\nin the argument being taken by the State --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's in an instruction,\nlike Toomey versus Ohio. The judge is corrupt. It is\njust structural. You can't say that about Crawford, or\ncan you?\nMS. FORSMAN: I don't mean to say, Your\nHonor, that it is structural. I think the issue of\nwhether something is structural error or harmless error\nhas to do with whether or not it is measurable, not\nwhether it's bedrock, not whether it's watershed, not\nwhether it leads to better accuracy.\nWe know that, because in Teague, although\nGideon was the only case explicitly referenced, there\nwas also three other examples mentioned in Teague.\nThere was a trial tainted by mob violence. There was a\ntrial flawed because of the intentional introduction of\nperjured testimony. And there was a trial flawed by the\nintroduction of testimony with regard to a coerced\nconfession.\nWe know that two out of those three examples\nare actually subject to harmless error analysis. So\nthis Court has never tied the issue of the elements of\nTeague or even the elements of the pre-Teague\njurisprudence to the issue of whether something is\nstructural or harmless. It is the issue, as it was in\nthe more recent decision of Gonzalez-Lopez, of the right\nto choice of counsel decision. They are what the Court\nlooked to to determine the issue was, is it harmless, is\nit quantifiable. And in this case, courts are\naccustomed, appellate courts are accustomed to looking\nat the introduction of this kind of evidence and\ndetermining whether or not it is harmless.\nThe State has not taken a position before\nthis Court that the Ninth Circuit was erroneous in\ndetermining that this evidence was prejudicial, and\ntherefore affected the outcome.\nSo the issue of accuracy as defined by the\nState and by the government, the problem with that\nargument and the easiest way to see the problem in that\nargument is if you look to Gideon. Certainly we\nwouldn't argue that the insertion of counsel into a case\nmay not result in what the State is defining as a more\naccurate result. The insertion of counsel into a case\nmay well cause the exclusion of evidence. In fact, in\nmany instances that is exactly what counsel does.\nSo their definition of accuracy if applied\nto the Gideon case would mean that Gideon would flunk\nthat definition, and wouldn't be the case that has been\nso repeatedly referenced by this Court as an example of\nthe kind of case that should be made retroactive.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Forsman, what about\nthe cases we're had so far on this second Teague\ncategory? As far as I know -- well, we haven't found\nanything to be retroactive on collateral review so far,\nso this would be the first time.\nMS. FORSMAN: It would be, Your Honor, and\nit is appropriate that this be the first time. As I\npreviously referenced, those cases fell -- there are 12\nof them, by the way. There were 12 decisions post\nTeague applying the Teague analysis in which this Court\ndid not find retroactivity. The Solicitor General is\ncorrect. Some of those were cases in which on\ncollateral review, the petitioner was seeking to\nactually create a new rule and apply it retroactively.\nBut if we look to cases such as the\nretroactivity application of Batson, for instance, what\nthis Court has found is that the Batson rule, the\ncross-section of the community on a jury, that the\npurpose of that rule was not created for the purpose of\nprotecting against unjust convictions or ensuring the\nintegrity of the fact-finding process. That was not the\npurpose of the Batson rule, this Court found that it\nwasn't the purpose of the Batson rule, and that\ntherefore, it would not fall under the Teague exception.\nThat is not so when you talk about the\npurpose of the cross-examination rule.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the decision\nthat said Ring v. Arizona was not retroactive on\ncollateral?\nMS. FORSMAN: Again, in Schriro versus\nSummerlin, the issue there was an issue with regard to\nultimate accuracy of a jury versus a judge. Again, this\nCourt found that the evidence was -- the evidence was\nequivocal with regard to whether or not a judge findings\nor jury findings were more accurate.\nNow you might say, well, that sounds a\nlittle bit like Roberts. The problem with that is that\nit isn't like Roberts, because under Roberts, the\ncross-examination right, which is something that we held\nso dear and connected so directly to the right to\ncounsel, having counsel without the right to\ncross-examination, isn't much of a right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The problem with your\ncase -- maybe it's our problem because it was our\nrule -- is that we're asked to adopt an across-the-board\ncalculus as to the rule. In some cases, as I think you\nwill have to concede, under the Roberts jurisprudence,\nthe fact finding was more accurate.\nIn your case, what you are telling us is\nthat the fact finding is far less accurate. But I think\nyou are stuck unless you can give us some reason that we\ndepart with it. With a rule-made jurisprudence, we have\nto look at the rule in the whole universe of cases, not\njust your case. It seems to me that was the problem you\nhad in arguing in this area, and maybe you can suggest\nsome way out. I don't see it.\nMS. FORSMAN: I can, Your Honor. The reason\nthat I can is that the judge does not have the ability\nto see the cross-examination statement either. So if we\nstart with the premise, when making this reliability\ndetermination, we would have to throw out all of the\nstatements in Crawford and all of the previous cases\nwhich hold so dear the right to cross-examination and\nsay, but a judge can make a reliability determination\nwithout ever hearing the statements cross-examined, can\nmake them in that vacuum without ever testing the\nreliability of the statements with the -- with\ncross-examination.\nAnd I don't know how you would be able to\nsquare that with the strong statements that are made in\nCrawford. And the strong statements that are made in\nthe cases, for instance, in the case finding that Bruton\nshould be retroactive, because it goes to the integrity\nof the fact- finding process. Unlike all of the other\ncases that you've talked about since Teague, the\nintegrity of the fact-finding process is what is at\nissue here. Do you have confidence in a result which is\nbased upon an accuser's statements being admitted\nwithout ever having been cross-examined?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But Ohio versus\nRoberts was not overruled because of a judgment that it\nwas not doing a good enough job in assessing reliability\nof these statements. It was overruled because of a\njudgment that the Founders wanted there to be\ncross-examination.\nMS. FORSMAN: That's -- Your Honor, that is\nthe base of the decision. It harkens back to what the\nFounders believed. However, the rule in Roberts was\ndescribed variously from \"amorphous to unpredictable,\nproof manipulable,\" to saying that the basis for the\nright to confrontation and cross-examination comes from\na basic mistrust of, even to the levels of a judge in\nterms of accepting the testimony without the advantage\nof an actual adversary proceeding.\nThis case, of course, illustrates the dire\nneed for cross-examination because the accuser in this\ncase testified inconsistently at the preliminary hearing\nin this case and then was excused before\ncross-examination was allowed. The accuser in this\ncase, who was sent to a counselor by the district\nattorney, when she went to the counselor refused to\nknowledge that the incident happened, according to the\ntestimony of the counselor.\nAnd because the court -- and the record is\nvery scant on what happened here -- the court, the trial\ncourt for instance, under Roberts made only a couple of\nfindings and he said the testimony was consistent -- he\ndidn't look at the fact that it had been inconsistent on\nat least two other occasions -- and said it was\nchronological, at least according to what the police\nofficer said.\nAnd so there were only a couple of findings\nby the trial court at all with respect to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You had the\nopportunity to challenge those findings under the\nRoberts regime in state court?\nMS. FORSMAN: We did. We did, and that --\nand that issue was not reached by the Ninth Circuit\nbecause after we had argued the case in the Ninth\nCircuit the Crawford decision was decided; and it was at\nthat point that the Ninth Circuit picked up on the\nCrawford, and they didn't decide the issue of whether or\nnot Roberts would have meant that this testimony was\nunreliable anyway.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You can still argue -- what\nhearsay exception did it come in under?\nMS. FORSMAN: It came in under a Nevada\nstatute which was patterned after Roberts. It came in\nunder a Nevada statute --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Adequate indicia of\nreliability.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Adequate indicia of\nreliability?\nMS. FORSMAN: Yes, adequate -- basically,\nindicia of reliability. It didn't go into -- it didn't\ngo into too much more detail than that. It just simply\nrequired that, a witness under ten, the court must find\nthat the, that the statement is reliable and the\nstatements are reliable, and then --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that universal in\nNevada? I mean, is they are no more hearsay rule in\nNevada, that you just evaluate hearsay straight out in\nevery case?\nMS. FORSMAN: No. No. That was a statute\nthat was adopted specifically for child witnesses.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This is for children\nunder ten, isn't it?\nMS. FORSMAN: Children under ten.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: As you just said.\nMS. FORSMAN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And here we had someone\nwho was six years old and was hardly articulate, it\nseems from the little we have of this record. So the\nNevada statute I think was very specific to children and\nwas not --\nMS. FORSMAN: It was. Yes, yes. No, it\nwas. It was adopted for witnesses under ten. This\nchild actually was quite articulate in the preliminary\nhearing and was able -- was able to talk about the fact\nthat she remembered talking to the police officer, that\nshe remembered -- but then, but then in terms of trying\nto recall the incident, she was unable to recall the\nincident, and she was unable to recall it in any of the\nsame detail that the police officer testified to.\nSo it wasn't -- you know, it wasn't a\ncircumstance in which you had a child who simply\ncouldn't speak or a child who couldn't describe what had\noccurred.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So if you lose this case,\nyou can go back to the Ninth Circuit and say, well, even\nunder Roberts it shouldn't have come in?\nMS. FORSMAN: I believe that's correct, Your\nHonor, because the Ninth Circuit did not reach that\nissue.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Would you comment,\nMs. Forsman, on your opponent's argument based on\n2254(d)?\nMS. FORSMAN: Yes. I think the easiest way\nto explain our position on that is that what has been\narticulated here is that a retroactive -- a rule made\nretroactive by this court would be applicable to\nMr. Bockting if he had not raised this issue or had been\nsomehow procedurally defaulted along the way. In other\nwords, in order to be able to get the advantage that was\ndiscussed by both the state and the government of the\nother sections of the statute which clearly recognize,\nas to the extent that it's relevant the sponsor of the\nlegislation did, that you still have the power to make\nrules retroactive, but the only way that Mr. Bockting\nwould be able to get advantage of that rule would be if\nthe state court had never ruled on the merits of his\nclaim or had made some sort of procedural ruling that\nmeant that he was defaulted on the claim. So instead of\nMr. Bockting, who has raised this question of being able\nto cross-examine his accuser from day one in the trial,\nhe cannot have that rule applied retroactively to him.\nIf instead he now, he goes back later and the court\nsays, no, this is a successor petition, you can't, you\ncan't get it, you can't come into our courtroom, the\ndoor is slammed on you, according to the state now\nthere's no ruling on the merits of his claim, and that's\nwhy that section of the statute would permit the\nretroactive rule to apply.\n2254(d)(1), while it has the language\nclearly established, and the court asked some questions\nabout that, I think it must be remembered that when that\nstatute is being addressed, it's being addressed in\nstate court -- or in Federal court, on Federal habeas.\nAnd so at the time that the petitioner is in Federal\ncourt, then the rule has been clearly established.\nThe 2254(d) --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not -- the\nstate has to result -- the state -- it's adjudicated on\nthe merits in state court and results in a decision that\nwas contrary to clearly established Federal law.\nMS. FORSMAN: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it seems to me\nthat the question is what was the law, what was the\nclearly established law at the time of the state\ndecision.\nMS. FORSMAN: 2254(d)(1), I think the only\nway that you can read that section compatibly with the\nfour other sections which are quoted in our appendix 2\nof our brief, the only way that you can do that is to\nrecognize, although this Court will recall that it has\ndescribed AEDPA as not quite a silk purse of legislative\ndrafting, but the only way to make those sections\ncompatible is to say, listen, what was going on when\n2254(d)(1) was written was we were talking not about the\ntiming of the new rule, what we were talking about is\nwho is it decided by, because before AEDPA was adopted\nit wasn't apparent that it must be a decision by you, by\nthis Court, that established by the rule. So that's the\nfirst part.\nAnd the second part is that it's not dicta.\nIt is an actual holding of this Court that is to be\nlooked to to determine whether or not the state court\nwas wrong. And so the only way to read that is to say,\nlisten, there has to be some meaning to retroactivity,\nand what does retroactivity mean? Retroactivity means\nlike a nunc pro tunc order, that when you've determined\nthat a new rule is retroactively applicable -- and\ncertainly between AEDPA and the Teague exceptions, which\nyou did say in Horn versus Banks, by the way, should be\nanalyzed differently -- although it has not been tossed\nup to you directly as it has in this case, the meaning\nof the 2254(d)(1), you have repeatedly advised that\nTeague is still alive and well and that when you look to\nthe application of whether a rule should be applied\nretroactively you look to the Teague exceptions, so we\nalso look --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is there any language in\n2254(d) that could incorporate the Teague exceptions?\nMS. FORSMAN: There is not language in\n2254(d)(1). The language -- the reason that we know\nthat Congress was cognizant of Teague is that there is\nlanguage throughout AEDPA, particularly in the sections\nthat we've quoted to you, that are lifted directly from\nTeague.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What would we say if we were\nto say that 2254(d)(1) accommodates the Teague\nexceptions, that Congress meant to put them in but just\nforgot to do it? How would we account for the language?\nMS. FORSMAN: I think that what you would\nsay is that\nCongress would not have deprived you of the power to\nmake a rule retroactively applicable and would have not\nthen created the ludicrous situation which the state\nsuggests would occur here, which is instead of the\nmotivation in Congress in having someone like\nMr. Bockting raise the issue from the very beginning in\none unitary proceeding, as opposed to going back, which\nis what they've suggested he must do in order to get the\nadvantage of a retroactive rule, is that Congress was\ncognizant of that and in order to make all of the\nstatute -- all of the provisions of the statute have\nmeaning and not render certain provisions, including the\nsections that we quoted, superfluous, that you must\ninterpret that to mean that the -- that the -- that\n2254(d)(1) is not a timing statute. It's what law do we\nlook to. That must be what they meant. Otherwise, the\nrest of it just doesn't make any sense.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that making the tail\nwag the dog, because there's language in the provisions\non successive petitions that refers to Teague, that you\nwould read the Teague exceptions into 2254(d)(1) when\nthere's nothing in the language there that can be\ninterpreted to refer to them?\nMS. FORSMAN: No. I don't believe that's\nthe tail wagging the dog, because I don't think that\nthat was the intent of 2254(d)(1). I think the\nintent -- again, I think the intent of 2254(d)(1) was in\norder to define what kinds of decisions the state court\ndecisions should be measured against. There must be\nsome kind of meaning to retroactivity, and retroactivity\nmeans that you are making this decision now and you're\nmaking it retroactive to the time. It is not going to\nbe many things, as we know not only from your decisions,\nbut as we know from the very small core of decisions\nthat Teague left open. And it is those decisions where\nwe must worry whether or not an innocent man has been\nconvicted. It is those rules that protect against\nthose -- an unjust, an unwarranted, a wrongful\nconviction. It is only those rules that go to\nreliability, that go to the integrity of the\nfact-finding process, that you are going to let through\nthat veil.\nSo if it is only that small core of rules\nthat you reserved in Teague, only that small core of\nrules, and we know it won't be many at this point, then\nif you read that compatibly with AEDPA, it is not and,\nas we know, it is not going to open the floodgates.\nThere is a very defined period of time in which people\ncan bring actions for relief. Under your Dodd decision\ndecision, there is only one year, not from the time that\nyou make -- if you were to make, for instance, this\ndecision retroactive, not from today, but it is one year\nfrom Crawford that petitioners have the opportunity to\nbe able to come into court within that statute of\nlimitations with regard to the date on which a new rule\nis adopted.\nIt is from that date forward. So there is a\ndefined population. In appendix 1 of our brief, you\nwill see all of the decisions that we could find that\nhave actually applied Crawford and there were 49 of\nthem. And what you'll find is that of the decisions --\nand the state and the government have not disputed\nthis -- of the 49 decisions which we were able to find\nat the time of the writing of that brief, only five\nactually resulted in relief. There's no question it\nwould result in relief here because there is no\ncontention before you that the Ninth Circuit's\ndetermination of harmfulness -- there is no\ndetermination before you; they haven't challenged that\nto you.\nSo it would result in relief for\nMr. Bockting. But because it's harmless error or it's\nnot testimonial or there was a previous opportunity to\ncross-examine, of the 49 decisions only 5 were found to\nhave to result in relief.\nAnd that is as it should be. The state\nargues that watersheddedness, if that's a word, is that\nwatersheddedness must mean that it affects many, many\ndecisions. Now, that can't mean what Teague means.\nTeague can't mean that my burden is to show you that\nmany decisions will be overturned. That's the exact\nopposite of what Teague was decided for.\nWatersheddedness has to do with the\nalteration of our understanding. It is difficult for me\nto understand how the change of course as described by\nthen Chief Justice Rehnquist, that the change of course\nthat Crawford represented in the way that we look at the\nright to confrontation cannot be, cannot be seen as\nprecisely the alteration in the understanding of this\nbedrock principle again directly from the language of\nCrawford.\nWe ask you, Your Honors, to make the rule of\nCrawford retroactive and to affirm the determination of\nthe Ninth Circuit.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Forsman, can I ask you\na personal question? Were you a moot court finalist?\n(Laughter.)\nMS. FORSMAN: I was not.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I attend a moot court at\nNotre Dame in about your year and it was an awfully good\nmoot court.\nMS. FORSMAN: Thank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.\nForsman.\nGeneral Chanos, you have two minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE J. CHANOS\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. CHANOS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI only have a few points.\nFirst of all, counsel's argument with regard\nto the interpretation of 2254(d)(1) clearly established\nlanguage is inconsistent with the statement made --\nstatements made by this Court in Lockyer and in Williams\nv. Taylor. In Lockyer, the Court stated Section\n2254(d)(1)'s clearly established phase referred to the\nholdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this Court's\ndecisions as of the time of the relevant state court\ndecision, citing Williams v. Taylor. In other words,\nclearly established federal law under 2254(d)(1) is the\ngoverning legal principle or principles set forth by the\nSupreme Court at the time the state court renders its\ndecision.\nWith regard to counsel's point about\nthis case in particular, Bockting, I agree that there\nare broader issues beyond this particular fact\nsituation. However, I want the Court to feel\ncomfortable that when this Court sent this case back\ndown to the Nevada Supreme Court and told the Nevada\nSupreme Court to follow Ohio -- Idaho versus Wright, the\nfactors in Idaho versus Wright to determine\ntrustworthiness, talk about spontaneity and consistent\nreputation -- repetition, mental state of declarant, use\nof terminology unexpected of a child of similar age, and\nlack of motive to fabricate. Particularized guarantees\nof trustworthiness must be so trustworthy that\nadversarial testing would add little to its reliability.\nFollowing that admonishment from this Court,\nthe Nevada Supreme Court found those statements to be\nreliable and to satisfy the standards of Ohio -- Idaho\nversus Wright.\nFinally, I would just point out that\nalthough Caldwell is indeed an important rule, and may,\nin fact, be a fundamental rule, so was Batson in Teague,\nas was Caldwell in Sawyer, as was Ring in Summerlin, as\nwas Duncan in DiStefano as was Mills in Banks. Yet this\nCourt failed to apply retroactive status to any of those\nimportant fundamental rules saying none of them rose to\nthe level of Gideon versus Wainwright. The same should\nbe true with your decision here with respect to\nCrawford.\nFinally, as Justice Harlan stated in the\ncase of McKay, talking about where this Court's\nretroactivity jurisprudence has come from, no one,\nnot --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can finish your\nsentence.\nMR. CHANOS: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Particularly if it\nis Justice Harlan you're quoting.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. CHANOS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nNo one, not criminal defendants, not the judicial\nsystem, not society as a whole is benefitted by a\njudgment providing that a man shall tentatively go to\njail today, but tomorrow and every day thereafter his\ncontinued incarceration shall be subject to fresh\nlitigation on issues already resolved.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\n"
