        "content": "(10:49 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in No. 04-6964, Jay Shawn Johnson v. California.\nMr. Bedrick.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. BEDRICK\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BEDRICK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI would like to address three points.\nOne, the correct prima facie standard under\nBatson is whether there's sufficient evidence to permit a\njudge to draw a reasonable inference of discrimination.\nTwo, the challenger's own reasons must be\ndisclosed in order for the Batson process to work and to\nprevent discrimination.\nThree, it is improper for a third party to\nspeculate at the prima facie stage as to a challenger's\npossible reason because what needs to be evaluated is the\nchallenger's own reason and own credibility and own\ndemeanor, and not someone else's guess as a reason.\nThe correct prima facie test is a permissive\ninference test where there is sufficient evidence to allow\na judge to draw a reasonable inference of discrimination.\nThat's equivalent to the test where a judge decides\nwhether there's sufficient evidence to pass a case to the\njury, although I'd like to add one small proviso to that,\nwhich is in case of doubt, the benefit should go in the\ndirection of obtaining the reason because the goals of\nBatson cannot properly be enforced unless the reason for\nthe challenge -- the challenge is stated.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's not very --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: That's a very low\nstandard in the first place, and why should it be watered\ndown more?\nMR. BEDRICK: I'm -- I'm not suggesting it be\nwatered down, Your Honor. I'm just suggesting in case of\na tie, in case the judge finds the question is in\nequipoise, then there should -- the benefit should go to\nthe -- obtaining the reason and therefore obtaining a -- a\nruling on the merits.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the test for going to the\njury the same as the test for whether or not discovery can\nproceed?\nMR. BEDRICK: No, Your Honor. The test for\ngoing to the jury is actually higher.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm -- I'm surprised you\nset the bar that high. If we're going to --\nMR. BEDRICK: I guess I had the benefit of the\nargument before the Court last year and the benefit of\nfurther reflection, and I think that allowing the case to\ngo to the jury is a good standard except for my proviso\nthat if it was close and the -- was in equipoise, then the\nbenefit ought to go to obtaining the reason because it is\na discovery-type request.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I was just admiring your\n-- your proposal in that at least it relied on something\nthat the lower courts are used to applying. I mean,\nyes, is there enough to go to the jury? My goodness,\nit's a standard test. But you've suddenly destroyed it\nall by saying it isn't quite that because, you know, if\nit's -- if it's really close, the tie goes to the\nplaintiff, which is an unusual way for the tie to go. The\ntie usually goes to the other side.\nMR. BEDRICK: The tie goes here to -- the\nstandard would be fine with -- with or without the benefit\nof a tie. I would be happy with the standard either way.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, what's the standard\nunder title VII when we talk about that, when we talk\nabout enough evidence to shift the burden of proof? Is\nthat something less?\nMR. BEDRICK: The standard under title VII is\nsomething less, Your Honor, because under title VII, under\nMcDonnell Douglas, the plaintiff has to prove four\nfactors, that the plaintiff was a member of a protected\ngroup, protected minority group; that the plaintiff was\nqualified for a job and applied; that the plaintiff was\nrejected; and that the position stayed open. Those\nfour --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, in -- in Batson, I\nguess the opinion for the Court suggested that it was\nbasing it on the title VII cases, the McDonnell Douglas\nformula. Is that right or not? Or have we gone beyond\nthat?\nMR. BEDRICK: It's a parallel -- it's based on\nMcDonnell Douglas in the sense that -- that there's a\nparallel step of prima facie case, shifting the burden of\nproduction. The defendant or respondent comes up with an\nanswer, and then eventually the trier of fact decides\nwhether or not the -- the plaintiff or the moving party\nhas been persuasive.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what happens if he\ndoesn't come up with an answer in -- in this case?\nWhat --\nMR. BEDRICK: We have --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- what happens if the\nprosecutor just says, gee, I -- you know -- or the -- the\nprosecutor has died? You know, it comes up later in -- in\na habeas action. The prosecutor is dead.\nMR. BEDRICK: That's about four questions, Your\nHonor. If I can take them one at a time.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. It -- it's one hypothesis.\nThere is no answer filed by the State as to what the real\nreason was. What happens?\nMR. BEDRICK: The trial -- if the State refuses,\nwillfully refuses to present an answer, the trial court\ncould and most likely will, draw an inference from that\nintentional refusal and hold that inference against the\nState.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you going to say that if\n-- if there's no answer, then the challenge is presumed to\nbe correct?\nMR. BEDRICK: No, I'm not saying that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. So the trial judge\ncan -- can overrule the challenge.\nMR. BEDRICK: Yes. The -- if -- if there is\na --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that's quite\ndifferent from the standard that requires it go to the\njury. You send a case to a jury if there's evidence from\nwhich the jury could find for the plaintiff.\nMR. BEDRICK: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's -- it -- it seems\nto me that's a -- that's much more rigorous than the\nstandard that you've proposed in -- in your brief, and\nthat -- and that other courts use in the Batson case. The\nBatson inquiry, as -- as I understand it, is -- is simply\nthat, an inquiry. There's a basis to ask the prosecutor\nthe reason. That's all.\nMR. BEDRICK: Very much so, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and that's quite\ndifferent than sending a case to the jury.\nMR. BEDRICK: The -- the standard for -- I\nbelieve the standard we're asking -- that's -- that's why\nI said the standard of sending the case to the jury but\nwith the benefit of a doubt going to the -- obtaining the\nreason.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I -- may I go back to your\nanswer to the -- the question whether in the absence of an\nanswer, there is a presumption of a Batson violation, and\nyou said, no, there isn't a presumption --\nMR. BEDRICK: That is correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- where the court has still\nultimately got to decide it? What sorts of things could\nthe court consider when it ultimately decides?\nMR. BEDRICK: At step one, whether or not\nthere's a --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: At step three. We've -- we've\ngotten to step three.\nMR. BEDRICK: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Step one, whatever the standard\nis, it has been met. Step two, silence. We get to step\nthree. What does the court consider at step three?\nMR. BEDRICK: The court considers the\nplaintiff's showing of a prima -- the -- the objector's\nshowing a prima facie case. The court considers the\nanswer given by the challenger.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Which is zero. Which is\nsilence. There is no answer.\nMR. BEDRICK: If -- if -- I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nI misunderstood. I didn't realize it was a silence issue.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. BEDRICK: If there's a prima facie case and\nif the prosecutor or the challenger willfully refuses to\nanswer, the trial judge is entitled to draw an inference\nfrom that refusal to answer and I believe most likely\nwould draw the inference that there's something wrong here\nand therefore would find a prima facie case.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. But what I'm\ngetting at is let's assume he doesn't draw that inference.\nUltimately at step three, he says, no. I am going to\nreject the challenge. I do not think that the burden of\npersuasion has been met. What -- what considerations\nmight lead him to do that, assuming that step one has been\nsatisfied?\nMR. BEDRICK: I do not know, Your Honor, because\nwe have never seen a situation in which a --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Let me --\nMR. BEDRICK: -- prosecutor has refused to\nanswer.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let me suggest this. Wouldn't\n-- wouldn't he almost necessarily have to consider at step\nthree those reasons that the prosecutor has not given, but\nwhich he thinks might be good reasons for the challenge\nwhich do not raise Batson discrimination?\nMR. BEDRICK: We have argued in our brief that\nit's not correct for the trial judge to speculate as to\nthe prosecutor's possible reasons.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right. That's what I'm --\nthat's what I'm getting at. And -- and what I'm troubled\nby is I -- I take your -- I understand your point, that\nit's not appropriate for him to speculate and supply an\nanswer at stage two. But if stage one -- at stage one,\nthe objector has satisfied the test and at stage three,\nthe -- the court may, nonetheless, reject the challenge, I\ndon't know what he would be rejecting the challenge for\nunless it is on the basis of this kind of, as you put it,\nspeculation about what the reasons might be. So help me\nout there.\nMR. BEDRICK: I -- I agree, Your Honor. I don't\nknow what the basis would be either if a prima facie\ncase --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then why don't you have to say\nat that stage, if there is silence on the part of the\ngovernment, he's got to find the violation?\nMR. BEDRICK: I -- I -- the only words that\nwould differ would be got to. I would say he'd be most\nlikely to if there --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if he doesn't have to, he's\ngot to have some reason for doing it. This is not a\nmatter of whim. And if he's got to have a reason and his\nreasons may not legitimately be those speculations on what\nmight be a legitimate basis for the challenge, but which\nwere never raised by the State, and you can't think of any\nother reasons -- and I admit I can't right now -- then it\nseems to me that he would pretty -- it would -- it would\nfollow that -- that he would be required to -- to uphold\nthe challenge.\nMR. BEDRICK: I believe that it -- it would\nrequire -- that he would ultimately uphold the challenge\nbut on the basis of drawing an inference from the refusal\nto answer, and those two -- adding two and two together,\nadding the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, but -- but the refusal to\nanswer -- I just -- you know, it happened so long ago,\nYour Honor. I had a lot of other -- I -- you know. But\nit comes up later, and he says I just don't remember why I\nchallenged this --\nMR. BEDRICK: In the case of don't remember,\nYour Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Don't remember.\nMR. BEDRICK: -- Batson has been the law for 18\nor 19 years. In California, we've had Wheeler for 25\nyears. Any competent prosecutor who was challenging\nminority jurors and was faced with a Batson motion would\nmake notes of some kind and keep a record of some kind.\nIf he did not do that, he would not be acting competently\nand the trial court would be entitled to draw an inference\nfrom that claim, refusing to remember.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Bedrick, in your brief\nyou were very, it seemed, uncomfortable about addressing\nthis question. You said it's just like you go through the\nsame litany as title VII, that is, the plaintiff meets a\nburden which is in title VII very easy to meet --\nMR. BEDRICK: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- stage one. Then the\ndefendant has to come up with a nondiscriminatory reason,\nand then you find out if that was pretext.\nYou kept saying in your brief what you said a\nmoment ago that you have never seen a case. You said it\nnever happens. It never happens that the prosecutor\nstands silent. So this is a hypothetical, academic\nquestion. But I think you're being pressed to say, well,\nsuppose it does happen, and I take it that your answer is\nin that case the person who's raising the Batson challenge\nwins. But you're -- you're not willing to say certainly.\nI mean, you seem to say -- well, why are you uncertain?\nMR. BEDRICK: The -- the title VII test and the\nBatson test are parallel, but not identical. And in\nthe --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But suppose you had in a\ntitle VII case the employer says, I'm not going to give\nyou a nondiscriminatory reason. You -- you've gone\nthrough the McDonnell Douglas. The plaintiff has shown\nthose four things. The employer says, I'm not going to\ngive you any reason. Then what happens?\nMR. BEDRICK: The trial -- the trial court would\nfind for the plaintiff because under the title VII\nformula, which this Court has established in the McDonnell\nDouglas/Furnco line of cases, the finding of a prima facie\ncase entitles the plaintiff to a presumption.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's because --\nMR. BEDRICK: And it's bursting the bubble --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wow.\nMR. BEDRICK: -- slightly --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I don't think we've ever\nsaid that. I thought we've -- we've said to the contrary,\nthat the ultimate question is always, did the plaintiff\nshow by a preponderance that -- that the reason was\ndiscrimination. That's what I thought our -- our cases\nsay, not -- not automatically to punish the employer for\nnot giving a reason, he loses, which is what you want to\ndo here.\nMR. BEDRICK: The employer will always give a\nreason and the challenger will always give a reason\nbecause --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What happens in a title VII\ncase if, in fact, we meet just what Justice Ginsburg said?\nCan you have a jury trial? Imagine a situation, jury.\nOkay?\nMR. BEDRICK: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The plaintiff gets up and\nestablishes the four points. Defense. The defense rests.\nNow, does the judge send it to the jury, or does the judge\ndirect a verdict for the plaintiff?\nMR. BEDRICK: I believe in the title VII context\nthe judge would direct the verdict for the plaintiff.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Unusual. I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and it seems to me the\n-- your -- there's some difficulty in -- in trying to\nequate Batson challenges and -- and title VII, and that's\nbecause your beginning point is that you base -- you --\nyou require too much of the prima facie case. It -- it\nseems to me all that's required under Batson is reason to\ninquire.\nMR. BEDRICK: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's -- that's a special\nuse of the term prima facie.\nNow, if -- if we want to be consistent with the\nuse of the word -- of the term, prima facie, from Batson\nto title VII, then it seems to me this inquiry is\nnecessary. But -- and you're the one that puts it in\nmotion by setting this rather high threshold that is the\nsame as to go to a jury. I disagree with that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: May I suggest you might have\nput the high threshold because it's a threshold that\njudges are familiar with and can use, whereas reason to\ninquire would be a fine test for when a judge is permitted\nto demand a response but it cannot possibly be a test for\nwhen a judge is required to demand a -- what does -- what\ndoes reason to inquire mean? Is that a -- is that a\nstandard that -- that can be applied in law?\nMR. BEDRICK: I accept the suggestion from the\nCourt that the standard could also be reason to inquire.\nWe would be -- we would be happy with that standard.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What does it mean?\nMR. BEDRICK: And the Batson procedure would\nwork.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What does it mean?\nMR. BEDRICK: It means when there is the purpose\nof --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Any suspicion whatever.\nMR. BEDRICK: Pardon me, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Any suspicion -- he strikes one\nblack from the jury.\nMR. BEDRICK: No, not any suspicion whatsoever.\nIt's a higher standard --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It has to be reason to inquire.\nMR. BEDRICK: It has to be reason to inquire.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's --\nMR. BEDRICK: It would vary depending on the\ncircumstances. The --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and is that like\npermitting discovery to go forward?\nMR. BEDRICK: That's essentially what step one\nof Batson is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and is that standard\nless than going to a jury?\nMR. BEDRICK: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. So that -- that's\n-- I recognize that it's been difficult for us to find an\nanalog. It may be that Batson is sui generis. It may not\nbe. If we're going to talk about what judges are familiar\nwith, then it's prima facie case and it's title VII.\nMR. BEDRICK: But title VII doesn't quite work\nbecause the -- the prima -- the definition for prima facie\ncase in title VII is different, and it's easier. If we\nwere to put in the -- they're -- they're parallel tests.\nThey're not identical. If we were to import the title VII\nprima facie case in a Batson, it will be satisfied every\ntime there was a challenge to a minority juror because\nunder any -- every such situation, there would be a\nminority juror who was qualified because he passed for\ncause who was rejected and the seat would be open. That\nwould be -- that's a -- that's even a lower standard than\nwe are --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then are you saying, look,\njudge -- imagine you had a jury on this question. If the\ndefendant has made out enough of a case that you would\nsend it to the jury, then go to step two and ask the\nquestions as to why.\nMR. BEDRICK: Yes, Your Honor, that's my\nposition.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's it. Fine.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Could -- could I take that a\nstep further? Would this -- would this be a -- a fair\nsummary of -- of your position on all the steps?\nStep one, there must be enough that would\njustify sending the question to the jury if it were a jury\nquestion.\nMR. BEDRICK: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Number two, if there is silence\nat stage two or in Justice Scalia's example, the\nprosecutor just can't remember, and we then go to stage\nthree, your position is as follows.\nAt stage three, number one, there is enough --\nthere is enough evidence on the record from which the\njudge can find a Batson violation.\nNumber two, there is a state of the evidence\nfrom which he is not required to find a Batson violation.\nSometimes, maybe most times, the prosecutor's silence will\nbe a reason to find a Batson violation, in addition to\nthose that were stated at stage one.\nAnd finally, theoretically -- theoretically even\nwith the prosecutor's silence, the evidence at stage one,\nsufficient as it might be to get to the jury, will not be\npersuasive. And there may be outlying cases in which,\neven with prosecutorial silence, the court will say I\ndon't see the Batson violation shown here.\nIs that a fair statement of your position?\nMR. BEDRICK: Yes, Your Honor, it is.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. BEDRICK: An example -- the only example\nthat I can think -- the only practical example that I can\nthink of, however, where a trial court is likely not to\ndraw a strong negative inference from the prosecutor's\nfailure to answer is in the situation suggested where it\nreviews it -- reviewed it on appeal and the prosecutor\ndied. Under those circumstances, the -- maybe there --\nthere may be notes in the file, but if there aren't notes\nin the file, the prosecutor's failure to answer is beyond\nhis control.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I take it in your view\nthe California standard is more strict than the title VII\nstandard for prima facie case.\nMR. BEDRICK: Yes, Your Honor, in my view it is.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, the California court at\nleast appears to say it's the same.\nMR. BEDRICK: The -- I believe the California\ncourt has misread title VII practice in several ways. I\nbelieve it has -- it misread what is produced at the -- it\nhas misread what the plaintiff's burden is to produce a\nprima facie case. And under title VII, the plaintiff's\nburden is merely, as I stated, to show that a member of a\nprotected group qualified, applied, rejected, position\nopen.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And do we say that that\nequates to a standard of more likely than not or do we not\nsay that?\nMR. BEDRICK: The -- those facts under title VII\nmust be proved more likely than not. And from that, under\nthe title VII McDonnell Douglas formula --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is -- is step one of title VII\nmore likely than not?\nMR. BEDRICK: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I don't see how that's\nmuch different from what California is doing.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I thought step one was evidence\nfrom which it could be found more likely than not.\nMR. BEDRICK: Yes --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: He doesn't have to prove more\nlikely than not at stage one, as I understand your\nposition. He has to put in enough evidence from which a\nfact finder could find more likely than not if he accepts\nall the evidence as true and so on.\nMR. BEDRICK: That's correct, Your Honor, under\n-- under Batson. The tests are not identical. Here --\nI'm sort of stumbling over my tongue a bit in trying to\npoint out that the tests are parallel but they are not\nidentical.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask you a question about\nthe other part of your case, which is that the judge\ncannot consider in -- in step one anything except the --\nexcept the -- the racial strikes and -- and nothing else\nand cannot even speculate as to what causes might have\nproduced the strikes? That seems to me rather extreme.\nMR. BEDRICK: It is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How can you possibly decide\nwhether it -- a reasonable juror could find this? Let's\nassume that all three of the -- of the minority, three\nblacks are stricken by the prosecution. The judge, the\ndistrict judge, knows that everyone of them is -- is a --\na defendant's lawyer, every single one. He has to blot\nthat out of his mind?\nMR. BEDRICK: Your Honor, that's a -- in that\nexample, which I respectfully submit would be rather\nextreme and unusual, the trial judge should still not\nspeculate.\nThe reason why the trial judge should not\nspeculate is shown by the facts of this case. With regard\nto juror Sara Edwards, the trial judge speculated on two\npossibly reasons. One possibly reason was that she had a\nrelative who had been arrested for a serious crime 35\nyears ago, and the second reason that he speculated was\nthat she had -- was -- did not know whether she could be\nfair in the case of a death of a child. As to the second\nreason, that would show -- if any bias, that would show\npro-prosecution bias.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But once -- once you have the\nlenient test that you've established, why isn't it enough\nto say even with that -- even with that speculation, a\nreasonable juror could find? Once you have that lenient\ntest, I don't know why you have to exclude the\nspeculation.\nI mean, there -- what if all three of the blacks\n-- it's a case in which the -- the visual evidence is\nsignificant and all three of the blacks are blind and --\nand you tell me the judge has to say, oh, no, it -- it\ncan't be that -- that reason that they were stricken.\nThat doesn't make any sense.\nMR. BEDRICK: In presenting a test -- in\npresenting a test or significant formula, every once in a\nwhile there will be a case where this test is slightly\nover-inclusive. And Your Honor has given an example of\nthat. But if that's the case, the trial judge will say,\nyou know, I bet I know what the answer is. Mr.\nProsecutor, what's the answer? The prosecutor gives the\nanswer. The trial judge says, yes, I find that credible.\nMotion denied.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And yes, but one of the\nthings, it seems to me, you're all overlooking is that if\nit's as obvious as they're all blind, those would be\nchallenges for cause.\nMR. BEDRICK: Very much so, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We're talking about challenges\nwhere there are no -- no obvious basis for it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, in practice, Mr.\nBedrick, is it always worked out like this kind of a\nminuet? First we have step one and step two. Isn't a lot\nof it just at a bench conference?\nMR. BEDRICK: Yes. The minuet may -- may --\nwill be most likely at a bench conference. In this case\nthe two motions were discussed. One was discussed during\na jury recess. The other was discussed the next morning\nbefore the jury was assembled. So it may be a minuet, but\nit's a -- I'm not sure who the -- there's a 1-minute\nwaltz. So it is more like a 1-minute waltz than a full\nminuet.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why do we need the same -- the\nsame rules for State and Federal courts? You have here\nthe California Supreme Court. Why do they have to use the\nsame -- the same minuet that the Federal courts do?\nMR. BEDRICK: Because under Batson and then\nunder Purkett v. Elem and under Hernandez v. New York,\nthis Court has declared that Batson is a rule of Federal\nconstitutional law, that the purpose of Batson is to\nprotect the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights of the\njurors to equal protection and not being \"perempted\" for\nracial reasons. In --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but -- but State courts\nhave different rules of evidence. They have different\nrules of procedure, and we allow Federal cases to be\ndetermined under those State rules of evidence and State\nrules of procedure so long as they provide due process.\nMR. BEDRICK: The California --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why can't -- why can't the\nBatson question similarly be decided but decided under\nState rules of procedure?\nMR. BEDRICK: The California Supreme Court made\nno claim to be deciding this case under State rules of\nprocedure. It asserted repeatedly that in this case that\nit was deciding this question under its understanding of\nFederal law, under its understanding of the Batson line of\ncases, and that it was interpreting Federal law and\nnothing more.\nMy opponent argues that there should be a State\nlaw question, but that's a different position than taken\nby the State supreme court.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you would have no objection\nto our limiting our opinion, saying, you know, reversing\nand remanding and saying this is not Federal law. It's\nnot what we would do in Federal court. Of course, the\nCalifornia Supreme Court is free to have some different\nsystem.\nMR. BEDRICK: I would respectfully disagree,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, you don't want us to do\nthat, do you?\nMR. BEDRICK: No, Your Honor. I respectfully\ndisagree. This is -- I believe this is a question of\nFederal constitutional law that needs to be applied\neverywhere. This is a rule followed in 12 -- all 12\nFederal district -- circuits and in 48 of the 50 States.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't it sometimes even when\nyou're not involved with a constitutional question, if you\nhave a Federal claim in a State court -- Byrd against Blue\nRidge is one example -- the Federal procedure -- that the\nState procedure needs to be modified so it's in sync with\nthe Federal?\nMR. BEDRICK: I agree, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That was a question of what\nkind of questions go to juries.\nMR. BEDRICK: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The State said ordinarily we\ndon't give this kind of question to the jury, but we're\ndealing with a Federal claim, and the Federal procedure\ntrumps.\nMR. BEDRICK: Yes. Yes, Your Honor.\nIf the Court has no more questions, may I\nreserve the rest of my time for rebuttal?\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Mr.\nBedrick.\nMr. Schalit.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH K. SCHALIT\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. SCHALIT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nPetitioner's position would require this Court\nto abandon Batson's requirement for a shifting burden of\nproduction or to announce a new rule of constitutional\nevidence that burdens of production shift based on\nimprobable inferences.\nThe standard recognized by the State is\nconsistent with Batson. Batson provided for a shifting\nburden of production and it directed the courts to look to\nthis Court's title VII cases to see how that process\noperates.\nIn title VII --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, do -- do you agree that\nthe California standard is more rigorous than the standard\napplied by the Federal courts and by most State courts?\nMR. SCHALIT: No, Your Honor. California's\nstandard is consistent with Batson. Now, there are very,\nvery few courts that have actually considered the precise\nquestion presented here. California does not stand alone\nin its analysis of this --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think the California\nrule is the same as the Federal rule?\nMR. SCHALIT: I think the Federal rule has been\nstated in many different ways. The Federal rule has been\nstated by lower courts in many different ways. It is\ncertainly the same as or consistent with the Federal rule\nas announced by Batson, which is the only question that\nmatters because in Batson --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what about Hanson, and\nis it Purkett v. Elem?\nMR. SCHALIT: Yes, Your Honor. In -- in Purkett\nand in -- I don't know whether it was Hernandez -- I may\nhave misheard you -- the Court reiterated the three-step\nprocess. All of those cases, however, rely on the\nexistence of a step one with a shifting burden of\nproduction before reasons must be given and they must be\ngiven when step one is met. The objecting party must make\na prima facie case. That does not happen until he has\nshown that it is more likely than not that there is\ndiscrimination.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's in -- in the title\nVII context, certainly you don't have to show more likely\nthan not to get past the initial threshold. All you have\nto do is to make four showings that -- that Federal courts\nhave recognized are rather easily made. So the real show\ndoesn't come until the pretext stage. But it's not that\nyou have to show anything by a preponderance of the\nevidence, that -- you don't have to show discrimination by\na preponderance of the evidence under title VII. You just\nhave to show four things from which someone may but not\nmust infer discrimination.\nMR. SCHALIT: Your Honor, in the title VII\ncircumstance, you are correct. The ultimate, ultimate\nfinding is, of course, made after the employer responds if\nthe employer chooses to respond in light of all of the\nevidence. The employer may not respond, for example, if\nthe employer does not believe those four elements have\nbeen established or the jury would find them to be\nestablished.\nHowever, if those four elements are established\nin the minds of the jury by a preponderance of the\nevidence, according to this Court in St. Mary's Honor\nCenter and in -- in Burdine or Burdine, the obligation is\non the fact finder at that point to find for the employee\nif there's no response at step two because a presumption\nis established.\nAnd Furnco expressly states that there is a\npresumption because the prima facie case if established\nmakes it more likely than not that there was\ndiscrimination. The prima facie case in the run of the --\nrun of the cases we know the reason that those four facts\nare true is that there was discrimination in the face of\nsilence.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought all it did was\nshift the burden of production to the defendant. It\ndoesn't -- the showing at stage one doesn't involve the\nburden of persuasion.\nMR. SCHALIT: Yes, Your Honor. It -- it shifts\nthe burden of production, but the reason it does so is\nthat, in the language of Wigmore, the employee, or in a\ntitle VII case, the objecting party, has gone further.\nThe -- that party has not simply removed the obligation to\npresent evidence from which one can infer a fact. But he\nhas gone further and presented sufficient evidence to\nentitle that party to prevail in the face of his\nopponent's silence.\nAnd Justice Powell, writing the opinion in\nBatson, clearly referred to the Court's title VII cases,\nincluding the opinion that he wrote for the Court in\nBurdine, which in the footnote expressly stated that the\nMcDonnell Douglas presumption does not adopt the prima\nfacie case in the sense of merely allowing the jury to\nmake a finding. It stated that -- adopted the prima facie\ncase with a shifting burden of production, and that is one\nwith a presumption that entitles the party to prevail.\nThe same is true --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you -- you can say that\nits words say that, but what it does doesn't say that. I\nmean, to establish a prima facie case, all you have to\nshow is that -- that you were qualified for the job,\nyou're a member of a minority, and you weren't hired, and\nsomebody who's not a member of a minority was hired. Do\nyou think that's enough to show that it's more likely than\nnot that race was the basis and that's -- you know, that's\nhow those cases pan out? That's enough for a prima facie\ncase. Is that enough to say it's more likely than not\nthat race was the reason?\nMR. SCHALIT: It is enough to say that when\nunexplained, when there's no response from the employer,\nyes. The jury is instructed that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Really?\nMR. SCHALIT: That --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you really believe that? I\nmean, in -- in a large -- you know, large -- large\noperation, you -- you're a minority. You apply for a job.\nYou're qualified for it. You aren't hired, but somebody\nwho's not a minority is hired. That alone, without any\nother information, is enough to enable somebody to find\nthat it is more likely than not that -- that race was the\nreason? My goodness. I -- I don't think that's an\naccurate description.\nMR. SCHALIT: Well, that is -- Your Honor,\nsorry. That was my reading of -- of St. Mary's when --\nand Burdine when a --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Hicks does say that. I think\nyou're right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It does say it. I'm just\nsaying --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right.\nBut suppose that -- but Wigmore says that the\nwords, prima facie case, can be used either to describe\nthe Hicks situation, which is the plaintiff produces the\nfour elements. The defendant sits silent, and the judge\nsays, directed verdict for plaintiff. That's what Hicks\nseems to say. And Wigmore says the words, prima facie\ncase, can mean that. But then he says the words, prima\nfacie case, can also mean a different thing, and the\ndifferent thing is what the judge says then is, jury, you\nmay find for the plaintiff, not you have to. And so I\nguess our question is which of the two meanings shall we\ntake here.\nAnd my question to be -- to you is, why not the\nsecond? After all, the whole point of Batson is in\nsuspicious circumstances to explore matters further, and\nonce you get to the point where you're willing to tell a\njury, jury, you may, you have suspicious circumstances.\nMR. SCHALIT: Well, Your Honor, in the title VII\ncase, I believe that what happens is that the case does go\nto the jury. It is not a directed verdict. It is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, if it's not a directed\nverdict, then a fortiori, then every analogy works against\nyou.\nMR. SCHALIT: No, Your Honor. To be -- let me\n-- let me be perhaps slightly more precise. It is not a\ndirected verdict. It is a requirement for the court to\ninstruct the jury to make a finding if -- if in fact it\nfinds all the four elements to be true. That is still a\njury question.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. Assuming the four --\nMR. SCHALIT: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- elements, directed verdict.\nIf you're right --\nMR. SCHALIT: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- about that, which is what\nHicks says --\nMR. SCHALIT: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- we have a choice, a fork in\nthe road. Take it. All right.\nMR. SCHALIT: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Which fork? And I put the\nreason why. Your opponents will argue, it seems\nplausibly, take the second fork because we have the\nsuspicious circumstance.\nMR. SCHALIT: Because that would upset the\nbalance that -- that Batson has drawn. Suspicious\ncircumstance was the same type of problem confronted in\nRosales-Lopez and Ristaino. The Court adopted a\npossibility of a racial bias test for the purpose of\ninquiring of jurors on voir dire as to whether there's\ndiscrimination for use in a Federal system as a rule of\ncriminal process and supervision over the Federal courts.\nIt refused to apply that test, which is akin to the test\nadopted by the Ninth Circuit and advocated by petitioner,\nin Ristaino because it recognized that we should not adopt\na divisive assumption that everything turns on race.\nIt would be a very simple matter to inquire of\njurors on voir dire about their racial biases on a mere\npossibility. The same argument about let us simply\ninquire and find out could be applied. After all,\nthese --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: On step one, I take it\nit's not enough to simply say, look, the person challenged\nis a member of a minority group. What more must be shown?\nMR. SCHALIT: No, Your Honor. I would agree\nthat that is simply not enough. And Batson demonstrates\nthat that is not enough because in Batson there were four\nblacks challenged, all four blacks in a case involving a\nblack defendant. You must show under the totality of the\ncircumstances at Batson -- as Batson says, that there's\ndiscrimination, and that includes circumstances that may\nrefute the case because, as Batson says, the statements of\nthe prosecutor and questions --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But I'm talking about\nstep one.\nMR. SCHALIT: Yes, and this is step one, Your\nHonor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: This is all step one?\nMR. SCHALIT: This is all step one. Batson, at\npage 97, states that a prosecutor's questions and\nstatements on voir dire in exercising the challenges may\nsupport or refute an -- an inference of discrimination.\nThe party who is making the claim is in the best position,\nany party who wants to be in, in terms of making a claim\nto a fact finder. He has the fact finder before him.\nThat fact finder has witnessed the same thing as the\nparty. They are all professionals and skilled in this\narea. And if that single juror was struck because of\nrace, the party can say that it was the same race as the\ndefendant if that may be a fact. It may be that that --\nthere's no apparent explanation because, let's say, it was\na -- another prosecutor who has struck --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why -- why is the defense\nattorney in a better position to explain the -- the\nmotives of the prosecutor than the prosecutor?\nMR. SCHALIT: Not --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't understand that.\nMR. SCHALIT: Not to explain the motives, Your\nHonor, but to confront the totality of the circumstances\nthat are present in that courtroom that Batson requires\nthat party to confront.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The question is what motivated\nthe prosecutor. Correct?\nMR. SCHALIT: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's hard for me to see how\nthe -- the defense counsel is in a better position than\nthe prosecutor to show that.\nMR. SCHALIT: He's in a better -- he is in the\nposition to meet his obligation under Batson to explain\nwhy, given --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The question is not what\nmotivated the prosecutor unless and until the step one\nshowing can be made.\nMR. SCHALIT: Yes, Your Honor, and thank you.\nThat is a more precise response.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But, of course, you can afford\nto be very rigorous at step two because your threshold at\nstep one is high. The threshold is -- if the threshold at\nstep one is -- is easier to cross, then we could be more\nrigorous at -- at step two.\nMR. SCHALIT: Step two does not have any\npersuasiveness component to it. There is no rigorousness\nto it in my mind. It is merely a statement of a race-\nneutral reason or reasons. It is not the time to\npersuade, and we know that from Purkett.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And here there was no reason\ngiven.\nMR. SCHALIT: Here, because there was no prima\nfacie case, Your Honor, yes, there was no reason given.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So why shouldn't this operate\nas so many things do in -- in an unfolding proceeding? If\nsomeone stands silent -- and we're not involved with a\nFifth Amendment privilege -- there's an inference -- an\nadverse inference.\nWorse, take a -- a discovery and one plaintiff\nasks for discovery from -- from the -- the defendant, and\nthe defendant says, sorry, I'm not going to give you what\nyou want. What is the consequence of that if the\ndefendant, being presented with a opportunity or a\nrequirement to give a reason or to produce something,\nsays, I won't?\nMR. SCHALIT: There may be an adverse inference\nthat would be drawn from that. There might be issue\npreclusion. There might be a termination sanction.\nThere's a range, as I understand civil procedure, of -- of\noptions that are available.\nIn this context, of course, petitioner asserts\nthat there could be an adverse inference drawn from\nsilence. However, if the standard is, as he proposes,\nthat there is simply a mere inference from which\ndiscrimination can be detected, the silence of the\nstriking party may have no informative content.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But one of the -- if we're\ngoing to continue with that analogy to someone who says I\nwon't make discovery, is not just an inference but that\nyou take what the opposing party says to be true on that\nissue.\nMR. SCHALIT: Yes, Your Honor. There -- there\ncould be issue preclusion. I assume that's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This is not -- not issue\npreclusion. I mean, this is -- that is -- the defendant\nwho stands silent is going to lose.\nMR. SCHALIT: Yes, but in -- in this\ncircumstance, the -- the striking party's silence is one\n-- when the test is set at the inference level not at the\nmore likely than not level, the -- the test is one -- I'm\nsorry -- not the test, but the -- the silence is one of\nstrategic judgment. Let me balance the risk of having the\nadverse inference drawn against me against the risk of\ndisclosing my trial strategy or my voir dire strategy.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I must confess I'm a little\npuzzled about the discussion of the trial strategy because\nis it not correct that whenever the judge thinks step one\nhas been met, the prosecutor always answers the question?\nMR. SCHALIT: Does always answer the\nquestion because it is understood that, having shown at\nstep one it is more likely than not that there's\ndiscrimination, silence at step two will result in an\nadverse finding. And --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well -- well, whatever it is,\nhe -- generally they are not silent when the judge says I\nthink step one has been met.\nI want to be sure understand California's\nposition on one point. Is it your view in -- in\nCalifornia that the judge must decide himself that it is\nmore likely than not that -- that discrimination is\npresent before you proceed to step two?\nMR. SCHALIT: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Now, that is not the test in\nan ordinary tort case in California, is it?\nMR. SCHALIT: In a case of -- of --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In an ordinary tort case --\nMR. SCHALIT: No.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- if the judge, at the end of\nthe plaintiff's case, says I'm not sure what the answer\nis, but there is enough evidence here to submit to the\njury, so I'm going to overrule the motion for judgment --\njudgment at the end of the case. Now, that's a different\ntest than you say is appropriate under Batson, is it not?\nMR. SCHALIT: Yes, Your Honor, because in that\ncircumstance in deciding --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So you -- so you have two --\nin California you have two definitions of a prima facie\ncase, one for Batson and one for all normal tort\nlitigation.\nMR. SCHALIT: In California, we like every other\njurisdiction, as far as I know, probably has two\ndefinitions, just as this Court does.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And is it not true that the\ndefinition that your opponent asks for is the same\ndefinition that would apply in tort litigation in\nCalifornia and in most States of the country?\nMR. SCHALIT: Yes. That is my understanding.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So you're asking for a special\nrule for California's application of Batson.\nMR. SCHALIT: No, Your Honor, because in that\ncircumstance --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: It sounds like you are in\nthat it's a tougher standard than normal. Here you had a\nsituation, did you not, where there were three black\nprospective jurors and the prosecutor struck all three?\nMR. SCHALIT: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And could that present enough\nevidence that the fact finder, if it were referred to the\nfact finder, could find a Batson violation?\nMR. SCHALIT: Yes, Your Honor. A fact finder\ncould make a -- a conclusion from that, but the --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: So why is that not enough to\nsatisfy the standard to require the prosecutor to give an\nanswer?\nMR. SCHALIT: Because, for example, the\nappellate perspective as to whether a fact finder could\nmake that conclusion, could any rational finder of facts\ndraw that conclusion.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is it because the judge could\nimagine reasons that the prosecutor might have had?\nMR. SCHALIT: It is not a question of -- of\nimagining reasons, Your Honor. It is a question of the\njudge bringing his or her observation to what has occurred\nin the courtroom, and to return to the example --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Would your answer here be\nexactly the same if there had been 12 African American\nprospective jurors and all 12 were struck? Does that make\na difference?\nMR. SCHALIT: Yes, it might in that the -- the\ninference would be probably -- it would be much stronger\nthe greater number you have. But, for example, those 12\ncould theoretically all still be defense attorneys.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but your test is -- is\nthat the judge under California law is required to find\nthat there's a strong likelihood or a reasonable\nlikelihood, but he must do that without hearing the\nprosecutor's reasons. That's your position. Right?\nMR. SCHALIT: Yes, Your Honor. Step one,\nbecause you do not hear reasons until, under JEB, you've\ngone past step one and get the reasons at step two. Under\nBatson, you do, however, consider information that may\nrefute the inference. Batson tells the judge to do that\nand to consider the totality of the circumstance.\nAnd Justice Stevens's observation about the\ndifference between the two tests is true, but in the -- in\nthe circumstance in which the question is whether it goes\nto the jury to avoid, for example, non-suit, that is\nbecause there is a fact finder for the case to go to\nseparate from the judge, and that fact finder does not\nhave to make an intermediate determination. Here the\ncourt has --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but it would be the same\nrule if it was a bench trial. The judge could say to him\n-- say, I think you may have enough but I'm not 100\npercent sure yet. I'd like to hear the defense -- hear\nthe rest of the case. He doesn't -- it does not really --\nthe -- the definition of a prima facie case does not\ndepend on whether it's a jury trial or a bench trial.\nMR. SCHALIT: But it does also turn, Your Honor,\nin part on the nature of the interest at issue, and the\nparticular process that the Court set up in Batson to\ncreate an order -- order -- system of proof and to allow\nthe proper balance to be struck between the importance of\nperemptory challenges and their use in selecting a fair\nand unbiased jury and the interest in assuring that there\nhas not been a constitutional violation, much for the same\nreason that in Ristaino we do not inquire on mere\npossibility. There are countervailing interests. In\nRistaino there has to be much more than a mere\npossibility.\nIn Batson, the Court sought to move away from\nthe difficult-to-establish standard of Swain to something\nthat would be more flexible yet still maintain the State's\ninterest in having a peremptory challenge system.\nYour Honors, California does not stand alone in\nits interpretation of this test. As I mentioned earlier,\nthere are very few States that have considered this issue.\nConnecticut, Maryland have done what this Court said it --\nthey should do, what all courts should do and look at the\ntitle VII cases. California has done that.\nIt has not announced a standard that is\ninconsistent with Batson. It has announced a standard\nthat follows from this Court's direction in Batson. It\nhas required a shifting burden of production which does\nnot occur until there has been either a presumption or a\nstrong mass of evidence, to use Wigmore's term.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think that the -- the\nsteps in this case have to be determined by what we do in\ntitle VII, that whatever we do here should be -- should\nbe, must be the same as what we do in title VII?\nMR. SCHALIT: I think it provides a close\nanalogy. It is not -- it is not a perfect fit, no, Your\nHonor. But it does -- but the Court very carefully\ndirected parties and courts to look to title VII for\nunderstanding of the operation of the proof rules.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but perhaps only for --\nfor the operation of, you know, what the various steps\nare. You have to go step one first, step two next, and so\nforth.\nMR. SCHALIT: Well, Your Honor, I believe the\nphrasing was that it's explained the operation of prima\nfacie burden of proof rules, and that's the footnote on\npage 94, sort of the operation of the burden of proof\nrules that is at issue here. And the burden of proof and\nburden of production rules --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A lot of people don't read\nfootnotes.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SCHALIT: Well, Your Honor, California's\nSupreme Court did. Connecticut did.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SCHALIT: And given the -- given the -- an\noccasion to do so, I think that's the appropriate path to\ntake.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could I -- I just confirm my\nunderstanding of how the jury selection process in\nCalifornia works? All the for-cause challenges are -- are\nmade and ruled upon. Then there are 12 jurors in the box,\nand then you make the peremptory challenge juror by juror.\nIs that correct?\nMR. SCHALIT: Yes, Your Honor. There may be\nmore jurors that have been subject to voir dire if a six\npack is used, but challenges are only made to those in the\nbox when the box is full, there's a full complement of jurors.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: After the for-cause challenges\nhave been --\nMR. SCHALIT: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: been exhausted.\nMR. SCHALIT: Yes, Your Honor. And, of course,\nin California like elsewhere, peremptories are used\nsometimes to remedy a failure to properly grant a\nchallenge for cause.\nYour Honors, California's system maintains a\nproper balance between protection interests and the\nState's and parties' interests in using a venerable tool\nfor selecting a fair and unbiased juror.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May -- may I just --\nMR. SCHALIT: Oh, please.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- ask you to clarify one\nthing? I -- I take it from what you've said, although I\ndidn't understand it from your brief, that California\ndoesn't have any different standard, that they are\nfollowing the same standard that would be applicable in\nFederal court on a Batson challenge. Or did I\nmisunderstand you?\nMR. SCHALIT: California is following the\nstandard that we believe Batson has identified. Now,\nthere are certainly Federal courts, such as the Ninth\nCircuit, that disagree with that. And so all Federal\ncourts do not do what California believes Batson allows to\nbe done. The Ninth Circuit has concluded that\nCalifornia's standard is contrary to and an unreasonable\napplication of Batson. That's Wade v. Terhune, 202 F.3rd.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So you're not arguing that\nStates have flexibility to apply Batson according to\ndifferent procedural rules. You're arguing that the Ninth\nCircuit is wrong about what the Federal standard is.\nMR. SCHALIT: We're arguing, first, the Ninth\nCircuit is wrong and that California's rule is consistent\nwith Batson.\nNow, as to whether other rules may apply, Batson\nhas a footnote stating that it was not going to attempt to\ninstruct courts on how to apply its process. That might\nleave room for other States to come up with alternate\nsystems of proof.\nWhat is important here is that California's\nsystem is consistent, and as respondent, we are not\nseeking to require all States to do something. Rather, as\nthe respondent, it is sufficient that California's process\nis acceptable just as California's process was acceptable\nin Smith v. Robbins for handling cases in which there are\nno nonfrivolous appeals on issues. A variety of standards\nperhaps could be tolerated.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Schalit, can you give me\nsome reason why I should care a whole lot about this?\nWhat's the big deal? I mean, so what if we adopt a very\nminimal standard. So what. It just means you have a\nbench conference and the -- and the judge asks, you know\n-- you know, you struck three -- three blacks. It, you\nknow, looks suspicious to me. I'm not sure it's more\nlikely than not. I'm not sure it's even enough to go to a\njury, but it looks suspicious to me. Why just -- how come\nyou -- you struck all three blacks that were in the\nvenire? What is such a big deal about adopting a very --\na very low standard?\nMR. SCHALIT: Because it intrudes on other\ninterests that our State --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What?\nMR. SCHALIT: It intrudes on --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Like -- like what?\nMR. SCHALIT: I believe it intrudes on the\nparties' interest and work product and opinion work\nproduct and attorney-client privilege and perhaps even the\ndefendant's Sixth -- Sixth Amendment right because it may\nrequire divulgence of those types of confidences.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: So the State has an\ninterest in exercising peremptories.\nMR. SCHALIT: Absolutely, Your Honor, yes.\nUsing peremptory challenges to select a fair and unbiased\njury is very important to the State. Having confidence\nthat the juries are fair and unbiased is important because\nit allows parties to accept the results of verdicts as\nbeing a product of a fair and just system.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I agree. Of course, the\nState has a -- has an interest in -- in exercising\nperemptories. But -- but why is it important that whether\nthe State is doing it in a biased fashion be decided up\nfront at step one instead of having the parties come to\nthe judge and say, you know, why did you do it?\nMR. SCHALIT: Because --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's what I can't understand,\nwhy that is so important to the State.\nMR. SCHALIT: Because the -- the challenges\nessentially cease being peremptory and become quasi-\nchallenges for cause. The State has an interest in\nmaintaining the system as a peremptory challenge system\nand in maintaining Sixth Amendment privileges and work\nproduct. And it has --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it still could be -- I\nmean, you're not taking away the peremptory. You're\nsaying the -- the prosecutor can give a reason and the\njudge says, okay, that passes. It wouldn't pass for a\nchallenge for cause, but as a peremptory, it's okay.\nMR. SCHALIT: Well, the challenge does cease\nbeing peremptory because the Equal Protection Clause has\noverturned the State statute that provides that challenges\n-- peremptory challenges are challenges for which no\nreason need be given.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But Batson overruled that. I\nmean, those days are gone. Tell California to stop\nworrying about that.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You cannot make peremptory\nchallenges for any reason anymore. You can't do it for\nany reason.\nMR. SCHALIT: Absolutely not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So they're gone. Now, once you\nacknowledge they're gone, what's the big deal about --\nabout having the parties come up to the judge and just\nexplain to the judge, we didn't do it for a racial reason?\nMR. SCHALIT: Because Batson could have chosen\nto adopt a Connecticut-style strict objection system. It\ndid not do that. The Court has made a judgment about the\nnature of peremptories as peremptories as still being\nimportant. Preserving that interest in using those and\nnot disclosing trial strategy is important. Having --\navoiding the risk that a party may respond with\nunarticulable reasons that erroneously won't be believed\nis important. We do not want to chill the exercise of\nchallenges for those reasons that are not based on\ndiscriminatory reasons but are unarticulable.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, in avoiding that\nchill, you're in effect saying the prosecutor is entitled\nto one or two free discriminatory challenges.\nMR. SCHALIT: Well, certainly there -- there is\na somewhat different consequence in -- in the standard as\narticulated by petitioner in that the striking party does\nget perhaps a freebie. And California doesn't accept\nthat. We've recognized that in State supreme court cases\nthere are no substantial free challenges.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The dog is entitled to one\nbite.\nMR. SCHALIT: I'm sorry, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I say, the dog is entitled to\none bite.\nMR. SCHALIT: Oh.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SCHALIT: Hopefully not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's a New Hampshire rule.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SCHALIT: Thank you, Your Honors. Unless\nthere are any further questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nSchalit.\nMr. Bedrick, you have 4 minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. BEDRICK\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BEDRICK: Here the prosecutor perempted all\nthree black jurors and left a black defendant to be tried\nby an all-white jury in a racially tinged case. These\nfacts indisputably present an inference of discrimination.\nThe -- my opponent suggests that silence may be\na strategic decision. But we have yet to locate any --\nany case where any prosecutor anywhere in a situation\nremotely like this has chosen silence as the proper\nstrategy. The purpose of Batson is -- is to elicit\nreasons from the prosecutor and then for the trial court\nto evaluate those reasons and determine whether or not,\nlooking at the -- all the circumstances and the\nprosecutor's credibility and the type of case, whether or\nnot their challenge is race-based. Reasons are crucial.\nIn the appendix to our opening brief, we\nexamined 84 cases in the last couple years where\ndiscrimination was found in violation of Batson. In\nvirtually all of these cases, the decision turned on the\nevaluation of the articulated reason. In some of those,\nthe articulated reason was unsupported by the record.\nFrom that, there was an inference and a finding of\ndiscrimination. In others of those, the articulated\nreason applied to many white jurors who were not\nchallenged. All those facts existed here.\nThe goals of Batson, which are admirable and\nimportant, which should apply in all 50 States, not just\nin 48, require -- need the reasons to be elicited because\nBatson won't work unless reasons are known and examined\nand ruled on on the merits and a record is made.\nWe'd ask this Court to bring California into the\nmainstream and ask that reasons be called for in\nCalifornia under the same standard that they're called for\neverywhere else.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nSchalit.\n"
