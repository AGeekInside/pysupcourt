        "content": "(11:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Case 10-9995, Wood v. Milyard.\nMs. Lord.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN A. LORD\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. LORD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Tenth Circuit, after finding that\nMr. Wood's petition presented two substantial\nconstitutional claims, denied him habeas relief solely\non the ground that his petition was untimely. It did\nthis even though the State had done three things that\nshould have precluded this result: First, the State\ndeliberately relinquished a known statute of limitations\ndefense.\nSecond, in doing so, the State acted\nstrategically, not inadvertently.\nAnd, third, in doing so, the State induced\nthe district court to expend substantial resources in\ndeciding claims of exhaustion and -- and deciding claims\non the merits.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, we asked for\ntwo questions presented. The first was: Do court of\nappeals have the power sua sponte to raise issues? And\nin your reply brief, you appear to say, yes, they do in\nsome circumstances. So, are you conceding that that\npower exists or that there is no power whatsoever?\nMS. LORD: I'm proposing a clear line that\nwould divide situations in which the court of appeals\nwould have power and those in which it absolutely has no\npower.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that a question of\npower or a question of exercise of discretion?\nMS. LORD: I would say it's a question of\npower, and this is why: I --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That seems sort of\nstrange. Both rely on a factual situation. Either you\ncan do something or you can't. That's power. If you\ncan do it sometimes, that's still power, and then the\nquestion is, did you do it when you couldn't do it?\nMS. LORD: Well, what I'm proposing is that\nthere are situations when it is never a proper exercise\nof the appellate court's jurisdiction to consider sua\nsponte a statute of limitations defense even in the\nhabeas context. And now --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that's what we\nsaid in Day, isn't it?\nMS. LORD: Correct, that in Day the Court\nsaid that courts -- \"courts\" -- it wasn't directed at\nappellate courts, but no court would be free to\ndisregard a deliberate waiver of a statute of\nlimitations defense.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, all this fight is\nabout is whether there was a deliberate waiver or not?\nMS. LORD: Well, that's --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: As opposed to power?\nMS. LORD: That's our primary -- our primary\nargument is that there was a deliberate waiver in this\ncase, and, given what this Court said in Day, the case\ncould be resolved on that narrow ground.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it is -- it is what\nthe -- swords are crossed over here because you say this\nis a deliberate waiver, and the government says, no,\nit's -- it's a forfeiture, and forfeiture -- if it's\nforfeiture, then the court of appeals has discretion to\ntake it up. If it's a waiver, then Day makes clear --\nso, it's a question of which box this case fits into:\nIs it forfeiture or is it waiver? And your position is\nit's waiver.\nMS. LORD: That's correct, and my position\nalso is that there is an overlap between those boxes and\nthat when the statute of limitations defense is\nforfeited in the sense of not being preserved in a\ntimely manner because of a deliberate choice, I mean --\nand in this instance --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are there a lot of cases\nraising the -- you know, the ambiguity that exists in\nthis case? I mean, if you tell me that's all this case\nis about, I think we ought to dismiss this -- dismiss it\nas improvidently granted.\nMS. LORD: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We don't sit here to decide\nwhether when the government says, you know, we do not\nconcede it but we're not arguing it, or whatever the\nlanguage was -- we don't sit to decide factual questions\nlike that, that come up in a particular case.\nI thought we took this case to decide the\nmore significant issue, on which there is a division in\nthe lower courts, as to whether there is, as you say,\npower of the court to disregard the fact that a statute\nof limitations defense has not been raised. We all\nagree it wasn't raised. Now, whether it was forfeited\nor not is another question. If that's all you want us\nto decide, I don't want to decide that.\nMS. LORD: Well, I clearly want a decision\nthat would favor my client. This --\n(Laughter.)\nMS. LORD: This Court granted cert on two\nissues, and certainly this case presents the first\nissue, which is whether a court of appeals, once the\nState has had an opportunity to raise the statute of\nlimitations defense and chooses not to, whether the\ncourt --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Only the opportunity or\nwhen it acknowledges -- in Day, we faulted the district\ncourt for not telling the State, essentially, which we may --\nnot telling the State that it had a potential statute of\nlimitations defense.\nIs it your position that if the State had\njust been silent about the statute of limitations\ndefense and not raised it, that the court of appeals\nwouldn't have power? Or is it your position that\nbecause they knew they had the defense and didn't raise\nit that the court of appeals didn't have power to sua\nsponte raise it.\nMS. LORD: Well, both -- the district court\nordered the State to announce --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're not answering my\nquestion.\nMS. LORD: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does the court of\nappeals have the power to sua sponte raise it if the\nState -- neither the court or the State addressed the\nissue?\nMS. LORD: Probably yes. Probably yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So, it\ndoesn't have the power if the issue has been raised? Is\nthat your position?\nMS. LORD: That's correct. If the stage of\nthe proceedings is after it was in Day, because in Day\nwhen the issue arose under the Rules of Civil Procedure\nand under traditional treatment of statute of\nlimitations defense, there was still time for the State\nto announce we -- there was still time for the State to\nchange or to raise the statute of limitations defense.\nHere --\nJUSTICE ALITO: It sounds to me that what\nyou're -- what you're arguing is that the court of\nappeals abused its discretion in viewing this as a plain\nforfeiture, which you've just said would permit the\ncourt of appeals to raise the issue sua sponte, instead\nof a deliberate waiver. Is that what it comes down to?\nMS. LORD: Or a purposeful forfeiture. I\nmean, there are forfeitures by --\nJUSTICE ALITO: They put it in the wrong --\nthey -- they abused their discretion by putting it in\nthe wrong box. They didn't put it in the forfeiture\nbox; they put it in the deliberate waiver box.\nMS. LORD: Well, the way the court of\nappeals handled it will create problems if it's approved\nby this Court because --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, this is what -- this\nis what troubles me about your argument that the court\nof appeals abused its discretion. Is it correct that\nyou did not raise the issue of the court of appeals'\nlack of authority to raise this sua sponte until\nrehearing?\nMS. LORD: What happened, Your Honor, is\nthat we were appointed at the certificate of\nappealability stage, and we were ordered to brief\ntimeliness. Perhaps I took the order too literally. I\nbriefed timeliness, but I also set out exactly what\nhappened, which is in the briefs and which sets forth\nthe State's position.\nThe court itself raised Day and raised its\nlimited authority under Day to consider a statute of\nlimitations defense. They found, rather than a\ndeliberate waiver, which I believe the record supports,\nthat the State's comments were cryptic, and I will\nstress --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But you're -- but you're arguing\nthat the court of appeals abused its discretion by\nfailing to rule in your favor on an argument that you\ndidn't make?\nMS. LORD: No. I -- the court was aware of\nDay, and the court analyzed what it was doing under Day,\nand it determined whether there was a deliberate waiver.\nOnce the court found there was a deliberate waiver, I\ndefinitely challenged that finding. I -- there's a very\nstrong argument not included within the -- the -- the\nquestions presented, that this is a totally timely\npetition. And it's only a -- it's a very difficult\nargument, which is one of the reasons why it shows how\nmuch the State's actions in the district court were\nstrategic.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you had two\nopportunities at least to make the argument based on the\noriginal postconviction motion, the 1995 postconviction\nmotion. You -- you did not raise that. You were silent\ntwice.\nMS. LORD: Silent on the impact of the 19 --\nwe were not silent on the impact of the 1995 motion.\nWe've always said, and in fact the State has never\ndisputed, that that was a properly filed motion, and the\nonly issue was whether it was tolled -- whether it\ntolled the statute of limitations period until 2004.\nAnd the State realized that that issue -- if they were\nto prevail on the timeliness issue, it was a very, very\ndifficult issue.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, then, I'm confused\nbecause I thought that there was -- it was conceded that\nthe question was asked, did you file another\npostconviction motion? Answer: No.\nMS. LORD: I understand your question now.\nWhen Mr. Wood was pro se, he filled out pro se motions,\nand in those pro se motions, he did say that there --\nand I'm talking about the 2004 motion -- he said there\nwas no prior postconviction motion.\nAnd I believe he was confused because if you\nlook at the forms, both the Federal forms and the State\nforms that show what a -- a defendant should check, it\nmakes it sound like a motion has to have been ruled on.\nAnd Mr. Wood was pro se and simply confused. And no one\nelse was confused once the State entered their\nappearance. They knew that the 1995 motion was still\npending. All they had to do was sit at a computer and\nbring up the minute orders from the State, and they\ncould learn that.\nSo, the courts in making their rulings\nalways from the time -- and, you know, one of the\nreasons why what happened was so strategic and so clear\nis that the district court had initially dismissed\nMr. Wood's petition as untimely. And --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Lord, could I ask you\nabout the first question presented?\nMS. LORD: Yes.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: As I understand the opposing\nargument, it goes sort of like this: It says, in Day,\nwe said it's fine to do this in the district court.\nEven if the party hasn't raised it, the court can raise\nit on this exact issue. In Granberry, we said with\nrespect to a different issue that the appellate court\ncould raise it. And, in Day, we said that those two\nissues were really the same.\nSo, that seems sort of like a logical\nargument that just gets you to a place where you lose on\nthe first question, unless perhaps there's a difference\nbetween a court raising a question sua sponte and a\ncourt allowing a party to raise it later than the party\nought to have raised it. Are you relying on that\ndistinction, or are you questioning the logic of the\nbasic argument that Granberry and Day decided this?\nMS. LORD: Both. And with respect to the\nfirst argument about there being a difference between a\nparty presenting an issue and a court sua sponte raising\nthe issue, there is a difference. And the courts -- the\ncircuit courts do not always make that distinction and\ndo not always focus on that. For example, in Granberry,\nit actually was a case where the party presented -- the\nState presented on appeal the exhaustion issue, and the\ncourt agreed to hear it even though the State hadn't\nraised it below.\nHere, you know, at least five times in our\njoint appendix, you'll see the court saying that they\ncan't act as an advocate for Petitioner. And in,\nfact, when the Petitioner, Mr. Wood, tried to raise an\n-- the exhaustion issue again, the Tenth Circuit in its\ncertificate of appealability said he is bound by his\ndecision to dismiss these unexhausted claims,\nnotwithstanding his pro se status. And in the same\nbreath, the court of appeals resurrected the at least\nconcededly forfeited statute of limitations defense on\nbehalf of the State.\nBut I'd also like to --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm a little confused.\nYou seem to be arguing that because the court of appeals\nraised it before the party did, that that's worse than a\nparty raising it first. Is that your position? That\nthat -- that the court of appeals has more power after a\nparty who has forfeited below or waived below now tries\nto come up on appeal and assert a defense that they\ndidn't assert below? Now the court of appeals has more\npower?\nMS. LORD: It raises different concerns. My\nconcern is not the relative power. It's that when a\ncourt is raising something sua sponte, it defeats the\nparty presentation principle. That's one concern.\nWhen the court is -- when the party raises\nit after having forfeited, everyone concedes here that\nthey wouldn't be allowed to. So, in essence, what\nhappens is the court is acting as a super-advocate\nfor --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But those arguments were\nrejected in Granberry and Day.\nMS. LORD: Well, that --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why should they win now?\nMS. LORD: Well, and that was -- I was going\nto -- I had a second part of my answer to Justice Kagan,\nwhich is there's something really different going on in\nGranberry and in Day, and you can't add the two and come\nup with a neat package such as what's suggested by the\nState.\nAnd, in Granberry, of course, as the Court\nall knows, the Court was dealing with exhaustion, and it\nwas dealing with exhaustion, which goes to the heart of\nhabeas and comity and all those concerns, at a time when\ndismissing a case to exhaust claims -- all that would do\nis delay Federal relief. It wouldn't eliminate Federal\nrelief.\nAnd this Court in Rhines v. Weber recognizes\nthat when AEDPA -- AEDPA was passed, it transformed the\nlandscape, and it really made some changes. And whether\nthe -- the notion in Granberry that exhaustion can be\nraised for the first time on appeal transfers to the\nstatute of limitations -- I think there's real doubt\nabout that, and I think that goes to an important\nquestion and the question that the Court granted cert\non.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But didn't Day say that\nthose two issues were functionally identical for this\npurpose?\nMS. LORD: Not for this purpose. And by\n\"this purpose\" I mean the court of appeals' authority to\nraise sua sponte the defense. In Day, this Court --\nthere were two prongs to Day. In the context of Day,\nwhich was, you know, where the State had filed a Rule 5\nresponse and patently erroneously calculated the -- the\nlimitations period, and the court noticed it, and\nthere's no law that required, as this Court held, the\ncourt to muzzle itself and not mention you've\nmiscalculated these days.\nWe're in a totally different situation. And\nthe Rules of Civil Procedure allowed what happened in\nDay. They don't allow what happened in our case.\nAnd --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What Rule of Civil Procedure\napplies here? You're talking about appellate procedure\nhere. Is there a rule of appellate procedure that\ngoverns this?\nMS. LORD: I'm referring to Civil Rule of\nProcedure 8(b) and 12.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, they refer to what\nhappens in the district court, and Day dealt with that.\nNow you're in the court of appeals. What rule is there\nthat addresses the situation in the court of appeals?\nMS. LORD: Well, there's the traditional\nrule that if you don't raise it, you lose it, when we're\ntalking about a statute of limitations defense. And\nit's really key here because when AEDPA engrafted this\n1-year statute of limitations into the habeas\nproceedings, it knew how 1-year statute of limitations\nwere treated. And, yes, in Day, quite correctly the\nCourt held that in that context you're going to treat\nthose defenses the same, especially with respect to Rule\n4, which would allow a court to dismiss a petition just\non its face.\nJUSTICE ALITO: You made an argument in your\nbrief that I found a little difficult to follow, but --\nso, maybe you can explain it. You seemed to suggest\nthat the State's position on timeliness in the district\ncourt somehow induced your client to dismiss the claims\nthat were arguably not exhausted. And I found it\ndifficult to understand why the -- why your client's\nstrategy as to whether he wanted to dismiss those claims\nor not would be affected by the State's position on\ntimeliness.\nMS. LORD: Well, if the State had challenged\ntimeliness at the stage that AEDPA contemplates it\nwould, it would have created a real complicated issue on\nabandonment, and I think the briefs suggest just how\ncomplicated that is under Colorado law. And if that had\nhappened, the court very well could have, district\ncourt, could have appointed counsel for Mr. Wood, I\nmean, if there had been an evidentiary hearing, if, as\nthe Tenth Circuit found, the issue was so complex that\ncounsel was necessary.\nSo, once you had counsel, in the State's\nreply or in its answer, they indicated that several of\nMr. Wood's claims were not exhausted. And some of those\nclaims were in that 1995 motion that was pending. With\ncounsel, there could have been a request for a stay and\nabey. There could have been so much that was done.\nMr. -- but because the State chose to simplify the\nproceedings -- that's what they did, and it was not\ninadvertent; and it wasn't a mistake. They chose to make it\nsimple and to focus on exhaustion. So, they got four\nclaims dismissed on exhaustion grounds, and then they\ndealt with the other two claims on the merits.\nThey also had a procedural default issue\nwhich was totally unconstitutional. They were relying\non a procedural default that didn't exist at the time\nyou had to raise it.\nBut that simplified the proceedings, made it\nmore a question of law. Mr. --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, what's wrong with\nthat? Why should we be penalizing the State for trying\nto simplify an action and make it move more\nexpeditiously?\nMS. LORD: Absolutely we should not. But we\nalso should hold them to that strategic choice, which is\nwhat Day says you do. And we have to hold them to that\nchoice because there were consequences, and there were\nchanges of positions. And they got the benefit of going\nforward and just looking at exhaustion. They eliminated\nthe risk of an evidentiary hearing. They eliminated the\nrisk of a lawyer. They induced Mr. -- and I -- they\ninduced Mr. Wood to dismiss four claims because -- oh,\nsorry. Because -- I'm sorry. I didn't see you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. Keep going\nwith your --\nMS. LORD: No -- because he was assured that\nhe could go forward on two substantial constitutional\nclaims without worrying about time bar, because the\nState said that. They said twice we are not\nchallenging, we will not challenge, timeliness.\nJUSTICE ALITO: That's what I don't\nunderstand. I -- why -- you have two situations. One\nsituation, the State's raising timeliness. So, he says,\nokay, they're raising timeliness; I'm not going to\ndismiss my -- the claims that they say are not\nexhausted. The other situation, they -- they don't say\nanything about timeliness. And he said now I'm going to\ndismiss the claims that are -- that they say are\nunexhausted.\nI don't understand the connection.\nMS. LORD: Well, the connection is the State\nguaranteed that they would not challenge timeliness, and\nthat allowed Mr. Wood to go forward on two\nconstitutional claims without ever having to worry that\nthey would be subject to time bar.\nAnd when the court --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Yes, I understand why that's\na benefit to him, but what is the connection between\nthat and the dismissal of the unexhausted claims?\nMS. LORD: Oh. Because if they had -- if\nthey had challenged timeliness, they would have raised\nthis very complicated issue, because the only way they\ncan win on timeliness is to win on this newfangled\nnotion of abandonment under Colorado law, which under\nColorado law requires a hearing and requires factual\ndevelopment.\nAnd once they pursued in the district court\nthat claim of abandonment, it was very likely that a\nlawyer would be appointed. That lawyer could see that\nthere were claims still pending in the 1995 motion and\ncould possibly have sought a stay and abey, could have\ngone and tried to exhaust those claims, serious\nconstitutional claims that were in the 1995 motion.\nAnd -- and maybe a better way of putting it\nis if they had raised timeliness in the district court,\nabandonment would have been front and center. And even\nthough the court of appeals ultimately resolved this\nissue without an evidentiary hearing, that was an abuse\nof discretion itself, too. It was totally contrary to\nColorado law, analyzing that issue.\nIt is no small thing that the position that\nthey took in the district court allowed Mr. Wood to go\nforward on two claims, two constitutional claims that\nare substantial that the court has granted a certificate\nof appealability on.\nThis is -- this case is so unlike Day in the\nsense -- if an appellate court can raise sua sponte the\nstatute of limitations in a case like this, it can raise\nit in any case. It invites the State to take a position\nin the district court which would be totally contrary to\nAEDPA's desire for streamlined proceedings. It would --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Lord, an amicus brief\nfiled on behalf of 15 States contends that the Civil --\nthe Rules of Civil Procedure are not what should be\nconsulted here, because they govern only to the extent\nthat they're not inconsistent with habeas rules, and\nasserts that the -- the habeas rules should rather apply\nand that they -- that they cut against your case.\nDo you have a response to that? Was it --\nwas it in your reply brief or --\nMS. LORD: It may be. I believe in some of\nthe briefs what I've said is there is no inconsistency\nbetween Rule 5's requirement that the defense be set\nforth and the traditional recognition that statute of\nlimitations is lost if not raised. And I cited the\nCourt to Jones v. Bock, which stresses that, for mere\npolicy reasons, we shouldn't deviate from the rules that\nwould otherwise apply. And I think --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't the screening function\nthat the -- that a district court performs in the habeas\ncase inconsistent with the traditional rule about\nraising affirmative defenses?\nMS. LORD: Well, that's the district court,\nand that's one of the key differences between the\ndistrict court and the appellate court. The appellate\ncourt can issue a certificate of appealability. The\ndistrict court has that prescreening function, which is\njust like the prescreening function in the PLRA, where\nthis Court looked at a circuit's attempt to create rules\nthat would address policy concerns and deviated and put\nan enhanced pleading requirement on prisoners and said,\nI believe unanimously, that that shouldn't be done.\nThere's a real virtue in having a\npredictable rule. There's a real virtue in letting the\nStates or -- letting the States know in the context of\nthis Court's Federal timing rules that they have to\nraise it, the statute of limitations defense, when\nthey're ordered to and when Rule 5 requires them to.\nYou should not adopt the State's position\nwhen it will just invite the sort of sandbagging that\nthis Court has taken care to avoid. You don't want\nstraddling by the State on something as important to\njudicial efficiency as asserting the statute of\nlimitations in a timely manner.\nI'll reserve the rest of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Domenico.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL D. DOMENICO\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. DOMENICO: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn contrast to the new and fairly\ncomplicated set of doctrines my friend asked the Court\nto adopt today, this Court can resolve this case by\napplying two straightforward longstanding rules.\nFirst, in Granberry v. Greer, the Court\nrecognized that courts are not bound by a State's\nfailure to properly argue and preserve a procedural bar\nto a habeas claim.\nAnd, second, to the extent there is an\nexception to that rule for deliberate waivers, the Court\nshould apply the common rule that a waiver must be\nunequivocal.\nBy applying --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Where --\nMR. DOMENICO: Please.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Where? What's the case\nthat supports you the most on that?\nMR. DOMENICO: On the -- on the second\nquestion? Well, that's a common rule. From\nstatutory rights such as in Olano --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, just give me a citation.\nMR. DOMENICO: College Savings Bank is one,\nprobably the clearest case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Has to -- has to be what?\nWhat's the word? \"Unequivocal\"?\nMR. DOMENICO: Unequivocal is a common --\nfor waiver of everything --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because I'll look at the statute.\nNow, I did look at Black's Law Dictionary, and Black's\nLaw Dictionary, looking up forfeiture and waiver, it\nseems like you lose.\nMy analysis would be this: Forfeiture is\nthe \"loss of a right\" -- that's what's at issue --\n\"because of a crime.\" That doesn't apply. \"Because of\na breach of obligation.\" That doesn't apply. \"Neglect\nof duty.\" Now, that does because you didn't file the\nanswer. Okay? So, that's forfeited.\nNow you look over to waiver and, as you say,\nit says \"voluntary relinquishment of a legal right.\"\nOkay, what's the legal right? The legal right is to get\nthe case dismissed.\nSo, I'm the judge. I say, State, do you\nwant to get the case dismissed? I just gave your\nanswer. Okay. I say you voluntarily relinquish your\nlegal right. Your legal right was to get the case\ndismissed, and you relinquished it. You didn't assert\nit.\nThat said, that would be the difference.\nAnd she's saying that. She's saying that makes a lot of\nsense. When you read Day, they're worried about the\nState doing something inadvertently, making a mistake.\nSo, what the judge says is: State, you know you have a\npretty good claim here on statute of limitations,\nbut you didn't assert it. So, I'm going to give you the\nright to assert it. Go ahead, assert it even though\nit's late. You overcome the forfeiture.\nNow you say: I assert it, Your Honor.\nOkay, you haven't waived it. Now you say: I don't\nreally care.\nMR. DOMENICO: Justice Breyer, what the\nState was doing here was not strategically trying to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no. I assume they\ndidn't do anything mean -- strategic; it wasn't a trick.\nIt was just what is it that they did? And what they did\nis they were given the opportunity to overcome the\nforfeiture, to assert the statute of limitations claim,\nand they didn't do it. They didn't want to do it. I\ndon't know why they didn't want to do it, because there\nwas a lot of trouble raising other issues, dah, dah,\ndah. But that's their business. The fact is they\ndidn't do it.\nMR. DOMENICO: Justice Breyer, the -- the\nCourt has been clear that a State's failure -- normally,\nthat's true. The normal rule under the Rules of Civil\nProcedure is a forfeiture of that sort, failure to raise\nan argument, is deemed essentially to be a waiver under\nthose definitions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But this wasn't failure\nto raise an argument; this was representing to the court\nwe will not challenge timeliness. That was the\nrepresentation made to the court. That was not\nnegligent oversight in not raising the question. It was\nan affirmative representation to the court that,\nalthough we might have done it, we will not challenge\ntimeliness.\nMR. DOMENICO: Justice Ginsburg, there --\nthere was an element of mistake, of negligence, as you\nsay, but -- but it also was --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Didn't the State adhere to\nthat?\nMR. DOMENICO: That's right, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It kept its word, didn't\nit?\nMR. DOMENICO: What the State was trying to\ndo, I think, is slightly different than would make sense\nin any other context. Because of the special procedures\nwe're under in a habeas -- a pre-answer response, what\nwe were telling the court was we will not assert this\nargument unless there's further inquiry from the court.\nNow, normally in court there would be --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Wait, wait, wait. When you\nsay \"further,\" I want to be very precise about the\ndistinction. You have to put it in your answer. You\ndidn't. Okay. So, that's a forfeiture. So, now the\njudge says you didn't put it in your answer, but I'll\nraise it. So, now you have the right to have the case\ndismissed for statute of limitations. Do you want to\nexercise that right? The answer to that question was\nyou didn't.\nMR. DOMENICO: That is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You said you didn't care.\nMR. DOMENICO: That's -- I don't think\nthat's quite an accurate characterization of what the\nState --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Well, but, one,\ndo the characterization, but please don't forget my\nfirst question, because so far I'm just stuck on Black's\nLaw Dictionary. And I would like you to have better\nauthorities for your -- you know, the supporting --\nMR. DOMENICO: Well, the Black's Law\nDictionary, of course, applies a usual rule. This Court\nhas made clear in Granberry and Day that the usual rule\nthat a forfeiture of a legal right means that it's not\nto be brought up again, that it doesn't apply to bind\nthe court's hands. Granberry and Day make that quite\nclear. What happened in Granberry would have been a\nforfeiture --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Domenico, you're\nsaying something considerably more. You're saying that\nwhen a State gets up -- after inquiry by the district\ncourt, when a State gets up and says we do not want to\npress this argument; now we're not saying the\nargument is wrong, because after all we're a repeat\nplayer and we're going to hear that argument again, and\nwe are not saying that argument is wrong, but in this\ncase we do not want to press that argument. That's --\nthat's unequivocal to me.\nMR. DOMENICO: It's unequivocal that we were\nnot going to press it again, though I think the\nimplication -- there would have been no reason to have\nraised it initially. There would have been no reason to\ninclude this caveat about refusing to concede, if that\nwas all we were trying to say. There are easy ways for\na State to take the issue off the table.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I -- can I ask you,\ndo you mean to tell me that, using your own words in\nyour brief, that a waiver is the intentional abandonment\nof a known right? I think you're equating intentional\nabandonment of a known right to be I have to admit I\ncould win and I'm giving up that argument.\nMR. DOMENICO: Well, in this case --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that what you're\nsaying -- deliberate?\nMR. DOMENICO: Well, you have to know what\nit is you're giving up.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you knew you had a\ndefense under the statute of limitations.\nMR. DOMENICO: Sure.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You thought, because you\nconceded, that you weren't conceding that it was\nuntimely. So, you were conceding you thought it was\nuntimely, and despite admitting that you knew you had a\ndefense, that you knew it could win, you were choosing\nnot to assert it. So, tell me why that's not either an\nintentional waiver, a deliberate waiver, or an\nabandonment of a known right?\nMR. DOMENICO: The -- what we were\nabandoning, to the extent we were abandoning anything,\nit was our ability to force the court to address the\nissue. In any other context, I agree that maybe --\nthere may be a distinction with no difference, but in\nthis case because there is discrete --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You were protecting the\ncourt's right to do whatever it wanted.\nMR. DOMENICO: There was a screening --\nthere is a screening function. We were raising the\nissue precisely to put it on the court's table for\nconsideration. In a habeas --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, why isn't it an\nabuse of discretion for an appellate court, when there\nhas been an intentional abandonment of a known right, to\nsua sponte raise that defense?\nMR. DOMENICO: Well, we did not take off the\ntable the court's right to consider the issue.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You say you didn't abandon\nthe right. Isn't that your position? You did not\nabandon it? You just --\nMR. DOMENICO: We did not abandon --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You just gave up the -- the\nopportunity to raise it yourself.\nMR. DOMENICO: I think it's confusion\nbetween what we are calling a right or the issue or the\ndefense. We, that's right, gave up our right in the\ndistrict court, unless asked, to argue the issue.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, let me give you this\nexample of -- of a regular civil case: There -- there\nare two defendants and the same claim against two\ndefendants. One defendant files an answer and raises a\nstatute of limitations defense; the other one doesn't.\nThe judge asks the second defendant, are you going to\namend your complaint? And the defendant says no. Now,\nis that a waiver or is that a forfeiture?\nMR. DOMENICO: Well, I think in your typical\ncase, it doesn't matter because forfeitures generally\nare deemed to be waivers, I think, in your typical case.\nThat's not true under Granberry and Day. The court has\nmade clear that a forfeiture is different than a\ndeliberate waiver.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, under the terminology\nthat we're using, wouldn't that be a forfeiture?\nMR. DOMENICO: I think it's better\nunderstood as a forfeiture. Simply you're not going to\nargue the issue, but the issue doesn't necessarily need\nto be taken off the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's why your\ncolleague on the other side -- why she made this point\nthe way she made it. I think there's no disagreement,\nat least as far as I hear Justice Scalia. Look, he did\nabandon his right, the State, to push the matter.\nThat's abandonment. He didn't abandon the right to get\nthe case dismissed if the judge pursues it.\nSo, your colleague says -- or as she says, a\ncourt of appeals does have the power on its own to\novercome a forfeiture. That's Day. But they don't have\nthe power on its own to overcome the waiver. And that's\nwhat they're doing. They don't have the power, in other\nwords, to decide it themselves. They only have the\npower to overcome a forfeiture.\nMR. DOMENICO: Well, if the Court looks at\nthe -- where this deliberate waiver exception to the\nGranberry and Day rule comes from, it comes from Day,\nand the concern there is with a court overriding a\nState's decision to waive, to take the issue off the\ntable. There are examples of States doing that. And\nwhen they do it, they are clear about it, and you can\ntell when it would be overridden.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the consequence of\nthat was the district court then had to deal with the\ncase on the merits, had to take up the two exhausted\nclaims and rule on them, after having told the district\ncourt you don't need -- we're not raising the statute of\nlimitations, we will not challenge timeliness. So, you\nput the district court to the necessity of deciding the\ncase on the merits. It does. It takes up the two\nunexhausted claims and deals with them on the merits.\nIn -- in Day, absolutely nothing transpired\nbetween the State saying the claim was timely and the\nmagistrate's detection of the computation error. The\ndistrict court wasn't put to what was unnecessary work.\nIf the -- it was the consequence of saying we won't\nchallenge it that forced the district judge to deal with\nthem on the merits.\nIn Day, the counsel didn't bring up the\nquestion because counsel thought that it was timely. He\nhad miscalculated and made a mathematical error. And\nthe judge then said, you know, I see that the number of\ndays that's required by statute, they have run. And as\nDay pointed out, at that point, the trial judge could\nhave said: Now, you know, you miscalculated; wouldn't\nyou like to amend your complaint and put it in a\ndefense?\nSo, the two cases, the two situations are --\nare so different. The district judge wasn't -- nobody\nwas made to do anything extra. But in -- here, because\nthe attorney said we won't challenge it, the judge had\nto deal with the case on the merits.\nMR. DOMENICO: That's right, Justice\nGinsburg. We failed in our -- in our duty and our\nobligation to protect the district court from having to\nengage in what, had we properly argued this, would have\nbeen unnecessary effort.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Those are sunk costs,\naren't they, Mr. Domenico?\nMR. DOMENICO: They are, Justice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's water over the dam,\nand the issue is whether the court of appeals will then\nhave to repeat the district court's excursus into the\nmerits.\nMR. DOMENICO: That's exact --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right?\nMR. DOMENICO: That's exactly right. The --\nwe have already spent that time. The question now is\nif -- if Mr. Wood prevails now, the court of appeals\nwill have to proceed to resolving the case on the\nmerits. Instead, in this case, they applied the very\ncommon principle that a court of appeals will affirm for\nany basis supported by the record in order precisely to\navoid -- that happens fairly often. They avoid having\nto address a constitutional problem. They save having\nto engage in those efforts again.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's a matter of\ndiscretion with the court of appeals?\nMR. DOMENICO: Absolutely. We recognize\nthat this is in that middle ground where the court of\nappeals was certainly under no obligation to do this.\nHad the court of appeals refused to do it, we wouldn't\nbe here demanding that they be forced to consider this\nissue.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the court of appeals\ncould have gotten mad at the fact that the district\ncourt was compelled to go through the merits, right?\nMR. DOMENICO: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And for that reason could\nhave denied it. But it didn't get mad, I guess. I\ndon't know why.\nMR. DOMENICO: Well, it didn't get mad\npartly, I think, perhaps because Mr. Wood never argued\nthat the issue was forfeited or waived at all until\nafter -- after the court of appeals had already resolved\nthe question.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, why do you say that\nthe position that the State took in the district court\nprevented the district court from considering the\ntimeliness issue? If it wasn't a deliberate waiver,\nthen the district court under Day wasn't prohibited from\n-- from deciding the case untimely.\nMR. DOMENICO: Absolutely. I do not think\nthat the district court was prohibited from considering\nit. The only reason for us to have raised this sort of\nskeletal outline of the argument was precisely so the\ncourt of appeals would have the opportunity to consider\nit.\nRemember, this was raised initially in the\npre-answer response stage where the -- which is\nspecifically part of the district court's preliminary\nconsideration of the issue. So, it was certainly ex\nante quite possible that the response of the district\ncourt would not be to simply ignore the issue as it did\nbut to either ask for additional briefing, as happens\nwith some regularity, to issue a show-cause order as it\nhad already done, or perhaps to dismiss the case again\nas it had already done so.\nSo, the issue was not off the table. The\ndistrict court very much could have addressed the\nquestion.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Domenico, do I\nunderstand your argument correctly to think that if you\nhad not said, or if the lawyer for the State had not\nsaid we're not conceding, if all that the lawyer for the\nState had said is we're not challenging this, Your\nHonor, would that count as a deliberate waiver under\nDay?\nMR. DOMENICO: I think that's a harder case.\nThe lead-up to that, I think, undermines the -- at\nleast, the unequivocal nature of -- of that statement\nbecause there would have been no reason to have laid out\nthe potential argument if what we were really trying to\ndo was waive the -- waive the entire issue as Day uses\nthat language. If that's what we were trying to do,\nthere would have been no reason to do that either.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The new --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But this is --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. The new case\nlaw is what I said. When you say I won't raise this\ndefense, I waive it, everything you said except saying I\ndon't admit it, today, before a circuit court abuses its\ndiscretion, you also have to say I am waiving the right\nof the court of appeals to raise this sua sponte.\nThat's -- that's -- you want that to be what you need to\ndo for us to find a waiver.\nMR. DOMENICO: I don't think you need to say\nthat. I don't think there necessarily need to be any\nmagic words at all, but it needs to be unequivocal and\nclear, not ambiguous language that we're going to spend\nan hour here today trying to debate what it was that we\nmeant. That's the only rule we're asking for today.\nAnd the contrary rule really provides some\nperverse incentives to States. I mean, here the State\nwas trying to be candid with the court. It discovered\nthis 1995 motion on its own. Mr. Wood had never\nmentioned it in his filings. He had already briefed the\ntimeliness issue twice in the district court without\nmentioning it, let alone raising it in any of his\npetitions.\nThe State found this and tried to be candid,\nthat we weren't entirely clear about how the argument\nplayed out. The alternative is that States will be\nforced into something more than scorched earth, throw\neverything at the court, see what sticks, and that's not\nin anybody's interest, let alone the Federal courts' or\nhabeas petitioners'.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There is something about\nthe principle of party presentation. The party raises\nthe issue. The court of appeals is the court of review,\nnot first view. Here -- in Day, the -- the lawyer did\nnot know that he had a statute of limitations defense,\nthat -- did not know because he had miscalculated the\ntime. Here the State knew very well that it did have a\nstatute of limitations argument, but it says we're not\nchallenging it.\nAnd then the ordinary thing is that a court\nof appeals reviews decisions of the district court;\ndoesn't decide questions in the first instance. But\nhere you are saying the attorney can tell district judge\ndon't decide this; go on to the merits. Then the court\nof appeals, which is supposed to be reviewing what the\ndistrict court does, instead deals with that question in\nthe first instance. That seems like an odd inversion of\nthe role of the -- of the district court and court of\nappeals.\nMR. DOMENICO: Justice Ginsburg, again, I\ndon't think it's quite accurate to say that we told the\ndistrict court not to address the issue. We told the\ndistrict court there was an issue that we were going to\nrefrain from presenting our full argument on it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You didn't say we're\ngoing to refrain from it. You said, District Judge,\nYour Honor, we will not challenge timeliness.\nMR. DOMENICO: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Didn't have any\nqualifications.\nMR. DOMENICO: Well, I -- I do think we\nqualified it. The only reason to include the language\nabout not conceding was to qualify that. The only\nreason to lay out the argument was to make sure that the\ncourt was able to consider it in its screening\nprocedures and --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But isn't the concession\nlanguage really going to a different point? The\nconcession language is going to the point of why it is\nthat you're not raising it, that you're not challenging\nit.\nMR. DOMENICO: I don't think it is.\nIf I may, Mr. Chief Justice, finish.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Please.\nMR. DOMENICO: I don't think that there is\nany reason for us to have been concerned about how -- if\nwe had simply stated we are not challenging it, there\nwould have been no concern about this affecting any\nother case whatsoever. The only case in which to be\nconcerned that what we said would be misconstrued as a\nwaiver was this case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nWe will hear from Ms. Sherry first.\nMS. LORD: Oh, I'm sorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Sherry.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MELISSA ARBUS SHERRY\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThis Court's decisions in Granberry and Day\nanswer the first question presented. I think Petitioner\nno longer contests that, and the Court can simply\ndecide the first question presented on that basis and\nreaffirm what it said in Granberry.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Sherry, there is one\ndifference. If you put Granberry and Day together, it\ngets you most of the way there. The one difference is\nthat here there was a sua sponte decision by the court;\nwhereas, in even the combination of Granberry and Day,\nit was a party that raised it, although the party raised\nit late.\nSo, why should that difference not matter?\nIf you think that party presentation has some\nconsequence in this area, you might think that that\ndifference does matter, that once you get to the court\nof appeals and even then the party doesn't raise it,\nsort of enough is enough.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: A couple of responses to\nthat. Number one, I think it's significant that Day\nitself was a case in which the court raised it. It\nraised it on its own.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But at the trial court\nlevel.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: At the trial level.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Of course, the habeas court\nhas a significant screening function.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: No, that's certainly\ntrue. I think the procedural default cases are another\ngood example. This Court in Day cited a number of them,\na number of them of which were cases in which the court\nof appeals was raising the issue sua sponte.\nOn page 12 of our brief, we cite a number of\nprocedural default cases. A lot of them come up in the\nsua sponte context. And the courts of appeals have not\nmade a distinction between the two.\nI think they certainly implicate different\nconcerns. For example, to the extent this Court has\nbeen worried about sandbagging or strategic behavior, I\nthink that's largely absent in circumstances where the\ncourt is raising it on its own motions as opposed to the\nparty belatedly raising the issue on appeal.\nSo, I do think if you look at Granberry, you\nlook at Day, you look at Caspari, you look at Schiro,\nand you look at the procedural default cases, I think\nthat really does resolve the first question presented.\nAnd, again, I don't think Petitioner really argues\notherwise at this point.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I may have forgotten\nthe procedural complications of this case, but here, did\nthe State have any opportunity before the court of\nappeals to raise the timeliness issue prior to the time\nwhen the court of appeals issued its certificate of\nappealability? And if the court of appeals had not\nissued a certificate of appealability on the issue of\ntimeliness, would the issue have come up at all?\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: The State did have an\nopportunity in the court of appeals because, after the\napplication for a certificate of appealability was\nfiled, the court did order the State to file a response,\nand the State didn't argue timeliness in that response.\nBut when the court of appeals did ask for briefing on\nthis issue in the certificate of appealability process,\nthe State, of course, did have an opportunity to respond\nthere, and it did argue that the petition was untimely,\nand it strongly argued that.\nAnd so, I guess, turning to the second\nquestion presented, of deliberate waiver, I don't think\nthere has been a deliberate waiver in the way that Day\nspoke about that term here for two primary reasons.\nNumber one, when Day spoke of deliberate waiver, it\nspoke of overriding a State's deliberate waiver, and I\nthink if you look, when the court of appeals decided the\ntimeliness question, there's no way to look at that as\nthe State -- as a court, rather, actually overriding the\nState's deliberate waiver. At that point, the State had\nargued that the petition was untimely.\nPetitioner never argued that the court\nshouldn't decide the issue, never argued that that --\nthat the State had waived that issue below. And I think\nat that time, it's really difficult to characterize that\nas overriding the State's deliberate waiver.\nThe other point I would make is in the\ndistrict court --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the difference is\nthat in Day counsel didn't know that he had a statute of\nlimitations defense. So -- but the court suggested it.\nIn this case, the defendant -- I mean, the -- the\nattorney knew, the State's attorney knew, they had a\nstatute of limitations defense and nonetheless told the\ncourt we won't challenge timeliness.\nIt seems a big difference between the\nfactual background of Day, where the lawyer didn't know\nthere was a statute of limitations defense, and this\none, where the lawyer knew very well there was and\ndecided to tell the district court not to -- not to deal\nwith that issue.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: I -- I think that\ncertainly is true, but I think it's important, in\ndeciding whether or not this should be treated as a\ndeliberate waiver, to look at what the consequences of\ntreating it as such would be. The consequences of\ntreating it as a deliberate waiver under the language of\nDay is that the court's hands would be bound; the court\nwould be unable to decide the timeliness question. And\nit's not just the court of appeals; it's the district\ncourt as well. So, if this were a clear deliberate\nwaiver in district court when the State filed its\npre-answer response, the district court would have been\nwithout any authority to consider --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, why is that -- why is\nthat a bad result? The -- I -- imagine the facts are\nthese: The State forgets to waive the issue, to raise\nthe issue in the defense. All right? Forgets.\nJudge: State you haven't raised a statute\nof limitations.\nState -- one possible answer -- thank you,\nYour Honor. We overlooked our forfeiture. We want to\nraise it.\nThat's one.\nNumber two: They say we don't care.\nNumber three: We don't want to. Okay?\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, in two and three, you\ncan say this: You could say the reason that we depart\nfrom the normal rule that you have to actually assert it\nin your defense is we're trying to protect the State\nbecause of habeas. So, we protect the State at least by\ngiving them a chance to make the argument when they\nforget or some other reason. Now we gave them the\nchance. Now they say: Huh? Who cares?\nAll right? If that's their attitude, why is\nit the habeas court's business to protect the State from\nthemselves?\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: Because it's not just\nabout the State. Because it's -- because of the\ninstitutional interests that are at stake. And that's\nwhy Granberry and Schiro and Caspari and Day allowed\nthere to be consideration of these issues despite\nforfeiture. It's because of the institutional\ninterest --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Despite forfeiture?\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: Despite forfeiture.\nRight.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And --\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: And -- and that's the\nvery question here, whether it should be treated like\nforfeiture or whether it would be treated like waiver.\nAnd the reason why I think it would be a bad result to\ntreat it as waiver here and why it would be bad to have\nbound the district court's hands in this case, if you\nlook at what happened here, the district court on its\nown motion initially dismissed this as untimely. It\ncame back and it went to the State and said, you know, I\nneed more information. And the State provided that\nadditional information.\nIt would be a somewhat odd system for --\nwhen the district court now had this information in\nfront of it, now knew about the 1995 motion, for it not\nto have been able to do anything further with respect to\ntimeliness on -- on that point. The fact that the State\nfor whatever reason decided to press other issues\nshouldn't bind the district court's hands except in the\nrarest of circumstances.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Except we have a system\nwhere the court doesn't raise issue on its own. The\nordinary rule is the party presents it, and when the\nparty says to the court we will not challenge\ntimeliness, it seems to me that's quite a different\nthing from just having an answer that doesn't raise the\ndefense. It's affirmatively representing to the court\nthat we -- we are not making this an issue.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: And -- and to be clear, I\nthink that's certainly a factor that the courts can and\ndo consider in deciding whether to exercise their\ndiscretion to consider a timeliness issue. The question\nhere is whether or not the court should lose any\ndiscretion to consider that issue.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But Day did say that\nif -- if a party knowingly waives a limitations defense,\nthen no court can bring it up. The party has made the\nchoice.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: That's -- that's what\nthis Court said in Day, and I guess the question is --\nis how strictly that should be construed. And our\nposition would be that it should be strictly construed\nbecause of the consequences of that waiver. And, again,\nI think it's significant that the Court in Day did talk\nabout overriding a State's deliberate waiver.\nIn the dissent, Justice Scalia, you\nmentioned the example of a court amending a party's\npleading over that party's objections. And I think that\nreally is a narrow circumstance in which the waiver rule\nshould operate.\nIt's not that the State's behavior is\nirrelevant to the question before the court as to\nwhether the court should exercise its discretion; it's\nactually quite relevant, and it's something that courts\nof appeals can and do look at. The question is whether\nor not the courts lack any authority to consider a\nlimitations defense or other procedural defense --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, you're saying\nthat if the court of -- court says, you know, you have a\ngood state -- limitations defense, you would clearly win\non that, but I'm going to ignore it, even though you\ndidn't raise it?\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would it be an abuse\nof discretion for the court not to accept a valid,\nevident statute of limitations defense on the ground\nthat the State didn't raise it?\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: I think under Day -- the\nquestion is whether it's a deliberate waiver, and I\nthink, under Day, the Court said quite plainly that it\nwould be an abuse of discretion in those circumstances.\nAnd I think there are a limited number of circumstances\nwhere -- where that makes sense, and I think the Court\nhas seen examples of that recently this term, for\nexample.\nThe Court denied cert in a case, Buck v.\nThaler, earlier this term, where -- a predecessor case\nthat is an example of the State expressly waiving a\nprocedural default defense because it wanted the court\nto reach the merits. In that case, the State said quite\nplainly -- in the predecessor case, I should say, the\nState said quite plainly because the use of race in the\npunishment phase seriously undermined the fairness and\nintegrity of the judicial process, the director\nexpressly waives any procedural bar with respect to that\nclaim.\nNow, that is the quintessential deliberate\nwaiver. And it took it off table, unlike what happened\nin this case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Lord, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN A. LORD\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. LORD: The problems with the rulings\nurged by the amicus and by the State are severalfold.\nOne, it's not contemplated at all by AEDPA that the\n1-year Federal timing statute of limitations would be\nsubject to such a wide latitude in the court of appeals\nto resurrect defenses.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If a State knows that it has\na potential statute of limitations defense and says\nnothing, is that a forfeiture or a waiver?\nMS. LORD: It would be a violation of\nRule 5, which requires them to assert a time bar if they\nare required to file a response. In our case, it also\nwould have been a violation of the court's order.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So, simply saying nothing\ncan be a waiver, in your view.\nMS. LORD: Probably not. But if you are --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If the answer to that is\nnot, then what is the difference between saying nothing,\nknowing that you have a defense, and saying we're not\nchallenging but we're not conceding?\nWhat is the difference?\nMS. LORD: Well, by not conceding, that\ndoesn't undercut the deliberateness of the waiver. It\nactually establishes it. It establishes that they know\nthat there's a defense, and they're not agreeing that\nthe petition is timely, but they're deliberately\nchoosing not to assert the statute of limitations.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, let me just ask it one\nmore way, and then I'll --\nMS. LORD: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Back in the office, they're\nconsidering -- in the State's office, they're\nconsidering what they're going to do. And they say,\nwell, what we're going to do is we're not going to\nchallenge it, but we're not going to concede it. And,\ntherefore, they say nothing.\nMS. LORD: In the face of Rule 5's\nrequirement, it could very well be a waiver. And I'd\ncite the court to Hill v. New York, which also addresses\none of the State's lawyers' points, which was a\nwaiver -- for the State to waive a statute of\nlimitations defense, its waiver has to be unequivocal\nand clear. I don't know if they're suggesting that\nthere also has to be an advisement by the court. I\ndon't think they're going that far.\nBut the fact is, you look at the nature of\nthe waiver or the right being waived. And this Court\nrecognized in Hill v. New York and other cases that if\nthe right being waived is, for example, the right to be\ntried in a timely fashion under IAD, it can be waived\njust by a lawyer accepting a date.\nAnd the statute of limitations issue here is\na typical strategic decision. And when AEDPA brought\nthis in, it didn't bring it in as it brought in comity.\nIt is something to move the case along from the Federal\npoint of view. And for this Court to adopt what --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish your\nsentence, please.\nMS. LORD: -- the State is suggesting will\njust take away all the efficiencies that -- that that 1\nyear brought to bear.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
