CLEMENT, ESQ. 19\nAs amicus curiae, supporting\nPetitioner.\nMS. JENNIFER DALVEN, ESQ. 30\nOn behalf of the Respondents.\n(11:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear\nargument next in Ayotte versus Planned Parenthood of\nNorthern New England. General Ayotte.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KELLY A. AYOTTE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. AYOTTE: Mr. Chief Justice and may\nit please the Court:\nThe Court of Appeals struck down New\nHampshire's parental notification act on its face\nbased upon a potential application of the act that even\nrespondents concede may only arise in the smallest\nfraction of cases. In doing so, the act was rendered\nineffective in the overwhelming number of\napplications where it is unquestionably\nconstitutional, and State officials were denied the\nopportunity to imply -- apply and enforce New\nHampshire's act within constitutional limits.\nNew Hampshire's act can be applied in a\nmanner to protect a minor's health if the rare case\narises where a medical emergency occurs that requires\nan immediate abortion. In that rare case, if it does\narise, where an abortion has to be performed\nimmediately and the child does not want to notify a\nparent, there is a judicial bypass mechanism\navailable which requires New Hampshire courts to act\npromptly and without delay and in the best interests\nof the minor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I interrupt you at\nthis point? Because there is one thing that I'm not\nsure that I understand about your position, and one\nway of reading your brief takes you a step beyond\nwhat you have just said. So I would like to get\nclear on this.\nAnd I understood your argument to be that\ngiven the safeguards such as judicial override, there\nsimply was no -- there was no need to read the health\nexception in, that in fact it was taken care of --\nany of the issues that might be raised in arguing for\nthe need for health exception in fact were addressed\nby the statute.\nThe point at which I'm not clear on your\nposition is -- occurs in what you've said on page 11\nof your yellow brief, if you could get that out. Do\nyou have the carry over paragraph on 11? You go\nthrough the kind of a worst case analysis. And you\nsay, well, you know, assuming that all of the\nsafeguards somehow do not work, finally, in the\nunlikely event that a parent refuses to waive the\n48-hour waiting period and so on, a doctor who\nperforms an emergency abortion under such\ncircumstances would not be subject to either criminal\nprosecution or civil liability because his or her\nconduct would not only be constitutionally protected\nbut would be independently justifiable, and then you\ncite the competing harms. What do you mean when you\nsay it would be constitutionally protected?\nI read that as suggesting that there was\nindeed a constitutional requirement for some kind of\na health exception, but that may not be what you\nmeant. What do you mean by constitutionally\nprotected? What are you getting at?\nMS. AYOTTE: Justice Souter, in that\ninstance, we did not say that it was an independent\nconstitutional requirement that there be a health\nexception, but certainly reading this Court's cases,\nwe should apply our act in a manner to protect if\nthat rare case arises where an emergency abortion\nwould come forward. And, if a physician were\nprosecuted under those circumstances, we believe not\nonly would he have a statutory ability to say this\nprosecution is inappropriate given our law, but also\ngiven those rare circumstances, we do not think that\nhe, under the Constitution, may be prosecuted.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And if he said, \"I may\nnot be prosecuted under the Constitution because,\"\nwhat follows \"because,\" in your view?\nMS. AYOTTE: I may not because New\nHampshire's act may not be applied in a manner to\nensure that if a minor in that rare circumstance\nneeds an immediate abortion, that she receives that\nimmediate medical care in those circumstances.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Doesn't that mean because\nthere is a required health exception? I mean, isn't\nthat what you're saying?\nMS. AYOTTE: Justice Souter, not that\nthere is an express requirement of a health exception\nbut that the law cannot be implied in a manner to\ninfringe on the minor's health if that rare emergency\ncase arises.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Your first answer to\nJustice Souter was that the physician would say you\ncan't be prosecuted under our law. Do you mean this\nact that we're looking at here? Or do you mean the\nlaw generally including constitutional protections\nthat this Court has proclaimed?\nMS. AYOTTE: Justice Kennedy, in that\nlimited circumstance, we do not believe that the\nphysician would be prosecuted under our parental\nnotification act, given that there is a mechanism --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Because of the text of\nthe act or because of some policy that the attorney\ngeneral would follow in order just to decline to\nprosecute? We want to know what this act says in the\ninstance posed by Justice Souter.\nMS. AYOTTE: Justice Kennedy, with\nrespect to the act itself, assuming it were a life --\nexcuse me, a health emergency short of a\nlife-threatening emergency, where a minor did not\nwant to notify her parents and assuming those\nsituations came forward and someone was unable to\nreach a judge, the act itself provides a mechanism in\nit that anticipates providing a judge where\nnecessary, and so that would be the ability of a\nminor in those circumstances to seek a judge.\nBut if for some reason all of those\nsituations came together and the minor could not seek\na judicial bypass in those instances, there is an\nexisting provision of New Hampshire law, our\ncompeting harms defense, that we believe protects the\nphysician in those circumstances.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Let's just imagine a real\ncircumstance. A 15 year-old walks in 2:00 in the\nmorning on Saturday into the emergency room and the\ndoctor looks at her, she's pregnant, she has this\nvery high blood pressure, whatever. And the doctor\nthinks to himself, he thinks, well, immediate\nabortion, no question, immediately deliver the child.\nIf I don't, I don't think she's going to die but\nshe'll never have children.\nAnd he's thinking that. What's supposed\nto happen? He calls up Pam Pevagoglio or Pam\nLivingston and there is no answer. It's 2:00 in the\nmorning and there is one of those things, leave a\nmessage, okay? Should I call your parents? No.\nThey don't know I'm pregnant. Now, what's supposed\nto happen?\nMS. AYOTTE: Justice Breyer, the\nphysician in those instances could perform the\nimmediate abortion.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't say that in\nthe statute. It suggests the contrary. So what is\nthe particular provision of New Hampshire law that\ntells that -- I mean, the doctor -- all these things\nare, you know, questions of probability. And he\ndoesn't want to risk being prosecuted and he doesn't\nwant to risk losing his license. And so what\nparticular provision -- he happens to have his lawyer\nwith him.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: What does the lawyer say?\nOkay? What's the provision that saves him? There is\nno health exemption in this statute.\nMS. AYOTTE: Your Honor, his lawyer\nwould advise him, in those circumstances, that the\ncompeting harms defense would protect his actions\nbecause he needs to act urgently necessary -- in an\nurgently necessary circumstance.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Would it protect him\nfrom a civil damages action as well as prosecution in\na criminal case?\nMS. AYOTTE: Justice O'Connor, by the\nplain language of the competing harms defense, it\nalso precludes civil liability. I would also say that\nthat lawyer would also advise him, if given the\nopportunity, the attorney general is prepared also to\nissue an opinion describing the applicability of the\ncompeting harms defense in this very rare\ncircumstance, should it arise.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How do we know? I mean,\nwhat you're saying is fine, but how do we know that\nthat's actually the law? I mean, there are a lot of\npeople who absolutely in very good faith would say\nthat it isn't competing harm. They would say that\nthe competing right that the life of the fetus is more\nimportant than the possibility of the mother having\nchildren in the future herself.\nSee, there are people in good faith on\nboth sides of this argument. And so how do we know\nthat the New Hampshire statute is going to do -- not\nthe statute, but your competing harms defense is\ngoing to do for this particular woman what a health\nexception would do?\nMS. AYOTTE: Justice Breyer, because\nthe harm that is being weighed here is the harm of\nurgently providing care to this minor who needs it,\nas opposed to the harm that the act is trying to get\nat, which is notification of parents. It's not\nwhether or not the minor can have an abortion. The\nminor can always go forward and have an abortion\nunder these circumstances.\nSo people aren't weighing the right of the\nfetus, in this instance, to the right of the mother's\nhealth. So the weighing is quite easy. And if given\nthe opportunity, my office would be prepared to issue\nan opinion as to the applicability of this defense.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But, your opinion --\nthat's the real problem here for the doctor who is on\nthe line. And you said the lawyer would say, oh,\nyou've got this defense of -- what do you call it harm --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Competing harm.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Competing harms, a defense --\nI think that a lawyer who cares about his client\nwould say, defense is not what we want. What we want\nis there is no claim, not that you have to put up a defense\nand maybe the attorney general will give us a\nletter saying that we come under that defense.\nWouldn't a careful lawyer say, what you need to be\nprotected is that there is no claim for doing what\nyou're doing?\nMS. AYOTTE: Justice Ginsburg, in the\nSimopoulos case considered by this Court, one of\nthe issues that was raised was a medical -- the\nphysician was prosecuted for performing an abortion\noutside the parameters of the Virginia act. And the\nphysician failed to raise a medical necessity defense.\nThis Court held that that was sufficient prosecution,\nthat that was okay. And this would work the same way.\nOnce the physician raises a competing harms defense --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: General, may I just point\nthis -- suppose the lawyer or the doctor are aware of\nthe legislative history and say, well, generally that's\ntrue. But when you have a legislative history that\nsuggests that the legislature considered this very\ndefense and rejected it in the statute, would then that\nthen give them some concern?\nMS. AYOTTE: Justice Stevens, the\nlegislative history -- there certainly was some\nindication that the legislature did not want a\ngeneral health exception. There is no indication in\nthe legislative history that the legislature intended\nto preclude this narrow category of cases which\nconstitute emergency cases short of that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But if they discussed\nthe issue on the floor of the legislature, why\nwouldn't they have drafted the precise protection\nthey thought appropriate?\nMS. AYOTTE: Your Honor, when they\ndiscussed the history on the floor of the House and\nSenate, they felt that it protected for emergencies\nand there was no discussion of this narrow category\nof cases short of death.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you have another\npoint here, don't you, about how general this statute\nis. We don't normally interpret statutes this way,\nthat they are totally invalid if any application of\nthem would be unconstitutional. That's not what we do\nwith statutes normally, is it?\nMS. AYOTTE: Justice Scalia, no. In\nfact, the analysis, if you look at this one potential\napplication, this -- the standard applied by the\nCourt of Appeals in this case goes well beyond even a\nsubstantial overbreadth test that is applied by this\nCourt in the first amendment context.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In the first amendment.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Am I right in\nreading your briefs that you don't object to a\npre-enforcement challenge to the bypass procedure\nitself brought by physicians, for example?\nMS. AYOTTE: Mr. Chief Justice, no, we\ndo not object in that sense. We think that is a very\ngood mechanism to bring forth a case given that this\nCourt has granted third-party standing to physicians\nto resolve these types of claims. And teh benefit --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I gather that\nthe debate on the evidence and the circumstances that\nmight arise in that case would be quite similar to\nthe debate in the present context. In other words,\nthere would be the same discussion between the\ndifferent physicians about what emergencies arise and\nin what circumstances and whether that creates a\nproblem and whether you can get to the courts in time\nand so on. It would be the same underlying sort of\nevidence that we have here, right?\nMS. AYOTTE: Mr. Chief Justice, it\nwould, but it would be much more narrowly focused in\nterms of bringing it as an as-applied challenge, this\nwas brought --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How would it be\nas-applied? Look at your reply brief at page 3. And\nyou've made it very clear, and I think that it is helpful\nthat you did, that there could be this pre-enforcement\naction by doctors who would not have to wait until faced\nwith an actual medical emergency to bring the suit.\nYou've talking about this small category of\ncases, but I take it from what you have read -- what the\nlines I've just read, that you envision a doctor who says,\nsooner or later, I'm going to have such a case. Right\nnow, I don't know and I can't know until it's too late to\ncome to any court, so I'm going to bring this\npre-enforcement which you characterized as-applied. But I\ndon't see how its as-applied, if if the physician just\nsays, as you put it, I don't have to wait until faced with\nan actual medical emergency to bring this suit. So what\nis the relief, what is the lawsuit that you envision would\nbe proper?\nMS. AYOTTE: Justice Ginsburg, the\nlawsuit would be a pre-enforcement as-applied\nchallenge and the physician would bring the claim and\nwould say, as applied to me, I perform abortions, I\nalso perform abortions on minors. I need to perform\nan abortion in these emergency settings. The court\ncan issue an order, presuming it's not satisfied with\nthe protections that are set forth in New Hampshire\nlaw that I've described.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Could you do that as a\nclass action?\nMS. AYOTTE: Depending on the\ncircumstance, he may be able to.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the\ncircumstance? All you said here is there coule be a\npre-enforcement challenge by doctors who would not have to\nwait until faced with an actual medical emergency.\nMS. AYOTTE: Justice -- I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why isn't that this\ncase? I don't understand.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, exactly.\nMS. AYOTTE: Justice Stevens, this is\nnot this case because this case was brought as a\nfacial challenge. Our entire act was struck down\nbased upon that one potential --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You mean he has to bring the\nas-applied challenge when he has the patient in\nhis office? He has to wait until he has the patient\nin the office, is that what you mean?\nMS. AYOTTE: No, he doesn't. He can\nbring it before the patient is in his office and then\nthe court could issue relief which would be much more\nconsistent with the principles of certainly separation of\npowers and allowing the overwhelming number of our\napplications of our statutes that are valid to go\nforward.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We're talking about a\nlawsuit which asks for declaration, not that the\nentire statute is invalid. But that, when faced with\nan emergency of the sort that this discussion has\naddressed, the physician can go ahead and perform the\nabortion?\nMS. AYOTTE: That's correct, Justice\nScalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Quite a different lawsuit\nfrom this one.\nMS. AYOTTE: That's quite a different\nlawsuit and a lawsuit that would be certainly, from\nthe State's perspective, would allow the overwhelming\nnumber of applications of this statute where there is\nno dispute that it works well, to go forward.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But in Justice Scalia's\ncase, would not the reason for that relief have to be\na finding that the statute is unconstitutional? You\ncan't just grant the relief because you think it's a\ngood idea.\nMS. AYOTTE: Justice Stevens, it would\nbe only in the context of that one particular\napplication as applied to that physician, which would\nhave stare decisis --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It would be a\nfinding that the bypass procedure is inadequate which\ndoesn't necessarily implicate the general\nnotification provisions.\nMS. AYOTTE: Mr. Chief Justice, that\nwould be the case. And certainly if that one\napplication, in that one potential rare case was\nfound not to be valid, then the remainder of the\napplications can go forward. And that is how most\ncases work with respect to as-applied relief.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then I think what you're\nsaying essentially is that the First Circuit was concerned\nwith this category, wanted to give pre-enforcement relief\nto the physician, so what they did was write except that\nthey should have said this statute is not\nenforceable where there is a risk to the woman's health\nand it cannot be applied in any such cases. Where there\nis a risk to the health, then the statute is okay.\nMS. AYOTTE: Justice Ginsburg, the\nFirst Circuit went well beyond because it focused on\na general health exception, they've now focusing it on an\nemergency exception. But certainly the relief should\nhave been as-applied. If I may reserve the rest of\nmy time for rebuttal?\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Did you ask that the\nrelief ordered below be more restrictive? Was that\nchallenged after the judgment was entered?\nMS. AYOTTE: Justice --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Did the Court below\nhave a chance to consider tailoring it more narrowly,\nas you suggest today?\nMS. AYOTTE: Justice O'Connor, we did\nraise the application of the severance clause below,\nalthough the court, both at the district court level and\nthe First Circuit appeared to look at the -- the lack\nof a general health exception as a per se\nconstitutional problem that rendered the statute as a\nwhole invalid.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: I just am not clear to\nwhat extent you really raised the possibility with\nthe court below of carrying its judgment more\nnarrowly as you're suggesting today should be done.\nMS. AYOTTE: Your Honor, we certainly\nraised the severance issue in the district court.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You've used this word\nseverance now twice. Severance is I excised a clause\nfrom the statute, but you're not asking for that. It's\nnot severance. There is no provision to be severed\nhere. It's putting a caret mark and adding something to\nit. Not taking out any provision, but putting in an\nadditional provision.\nMS. AYOTTE: Your Honor, you're\ncorrect. What our position is is that they did not\nmeet the standard that they should have been able to\nmeet for a facial challenge, which would grant\nas-applied relief which would only be invalid in that\none potential application. If I may reserve the rest\nof my time, with all due respect.\nJUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\nGeneral Clement, we'll hear now from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONER\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice and\nmay it please the Court:\nRespondents elected to bring a facial\nchallenge to New Hampshire's statute and succeeded in\ntheir goal in enjoining the statute in all its\napplications. Despite the facial nature of their\nchallenge, however, they do not contend that the\nstatute is invalid in all or even a large fraction of\nits applications.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that was true in\nCasey.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, I don't think it\nwas, with respect, Justice Souter. This Court found\nas to the spousal notification critically, that there\nwas a large fraction of the applications of the\nstatute that would give rise to the constitutional\nproblem.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, we may argue about\nwhat the fraction may be and we may argue about what\nsubstantiality means. But one thing I don't think we\ncan argue about is that Casey was applying the\nSalerno standard.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, two things,\nJustice Souter. I think, first of all, this case has\ncome up postured as being about a choice between\nSalerno and the large fraction test. And I think in\nsome points, based on the way respondents have\napproached the case, that's become largely beside the\npoint.\nAt footnote 13 of their brief, they could\nnot be more clear, that they are not here contending\nthat the statute is invalid in a large fraction of\ntheir applications. They instead are embracing a per\nse rule that if the statute does not have a health\nexception or an emergency exception clear on its face,\nit is void in its entirety.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Once again, that may be,\nbut after Casey, I don't think one can plausibly\nargue that the Salerno standard is the correct\nstandard. Whatever their position may be, whatever\nfractions of substantiality may mean.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I understand\nthat's your position, Justice Souter, given that you\njoined Justice O'Connor's separate separate writing in\nthe Fargo case. I think, however, that I read the\nopinion in Casey and I see the large fraction\nanalysis only in the spousal notification context.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But why would we have a\nseparate rule on facial challenges merely for spousal\nnotification?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I can think of\ntwo reasons, Justice Souter. First of all,\nbecause this Court applied the no set of\ncircumstances test in Akron II to a parental\nnotification statute, this Court in Casey may not\nhave wanted to overrule Akron II to that extent.\nSecond of all, I think this Court, in that\nvery passage about the large fraction test,\nspecifically distinguished spousal notification\nprovisions from parental notification provisions.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose I were to\nconclude that under Casey, this fraction test applies\nto this case. Suppose I were to say that Salerno\nshould not be applicable in this case. How should I\nrule in this case?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: You should clearly rule\nin the State's favor. And the respondents have\nreally given you no choice because they aren't even\narguing that a large fraction of the applications of\nthe statute are invalid.\nWhat you have before you is really a case\nwhere it's literally a one in a thousand possibility\nthat there is going to be an emergency where the statute\nwill operate. And the real question for you is\nfaced with that kind of case. Do you invalidate 1,000\napplications of this statute noting that 999 of\nthem are constitutional?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could the plaintiffs have\nfiled a narrower action attacking the adequacy of the\nbypass procedure?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Absolutely. And they\nalso could have -- what I think I would envision\nthem filling is an even narrower provision that\nseeks a pre-enforcement declaration, kind of like\nSteffel against Thompson would be the model, that say\nthat this statute can apply in an emergency situation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, that's exactly --\nI'm leaving aside your fraction test, your 100\npercent test, because I don't think they capture all\nthe considerations that are relevant. Focus on what\nyou just said. What you've done is you've tried to\ncreate an injunction that will separate out the sheep\nfrom the goats, all right? The goats are only\n1 percent and the sheep -- But what does it say? I\ndon't think you can say enjoin the bypass procedure,\nbecause if you enjoin the bypass procedure, there goes\ndown the drain your whole parental notification because\nyou can't have parental notification without a bypass\nprocedure.\nI don't think you can say enjoin\nemergencies because to do that, you're going to have\nto get into the greatest difficult issue there is in\nthis area, which is what does that health exception\nmean. And we've said throughout that that health\nexception has to be defined first by a legislature.\nSo if you tell me how to write that\ninjunction, then I'll be able to decide whether it's\npossible for a court just to say, okay, we only\nenjoin the goats as opposed to saying, legislature,\nthis is basically up to you, the whole area.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: And Justice Breyer, I\nwould say the court has some discretion in how it\nformulates that order. It would basically say that\nthis statute is not constitutional as applied to\nthose emergency situations.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, but that's --\nAnd if I could just say, it's no\ndifferent than Steffel against Thompson. There is a\ncase where there is a challenge against a broad\ncriminal trespass statute. The theory in Steffel\nwas not that the whole criminal trespass statute was\nunconstitutional. It was it's unconstitutional if you\napply it to leafletting. And Justice Brennan for a\nunanimous Court said, yes, that's exactly the kind of\nchallenge you can bring. And you can get declaratory\njudgment that says you can't do that, you can't apply\nthe statute as to leafletting. But you don't strike\ndown the entirety of the criminal trespassing statute.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The word leafletting is\nnot as fuzzy around the edges as health exception,\ngiven the fact that lots of people think health\nexception is a way of getting abortion on demand.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you agree with Justice\nBreyer that the legislature can draw this with more\nprecision than a court could?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, I don't Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, that seems to be\na solution, that the legislature can make it precise,\nalthough a court could not.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think the court could\nissue any order a legislature could issue. And I\nthink the fact that the court would have some\ndiscretion is an answer to the argument that, oh,\nwell, if you leave this to the courts, you're cutting\nthe legislature out of this. I think that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why wouldn't it be an\nabuse of discretion in this case? Because there\nseems to be an ample record here that the\nlegislature, or a majority of the legislature made a\nconscious choice that they would rather have no\nstatute than a statute with a health exception in it.\nThey deliberately said the only statute we want is\none without a health exception.\nTherefore, even if you touch all the bases\nthat Justice Breyer has laid out, don't you end up\nwith a position that if we were to craft such a\nlimitation, we would be flying quite precisely in the\nface of the expressed legislative intent.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think that's\nright, Justice Souter and I think it's because you\nhave to be careful. I think it's easy to use loose\nlanguage about a health exception. And I think if\nyou looked at the First Circuit opinion, they seem to\nsuggest there needs to be a health exception. And I\nthink in the context of a parental notification\nstatute, a health exception as opposed to a narrow\nexception for emergencies is a non --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Whatever you call it,\ncall it a health exception, call it an XYZ exception.\nThey knew what they were getting at, they knew what\nthey were worried about and they said, we will have a\nstatute without it or we will have no statute.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, Justice Souter,\nI think they were --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought there was a separate\nseverability. Didn't it have a severability provision?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: They did and it's extreme\nseverability.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And so it said just the\nopposite. It said just the opposite, that if the\nhealth exception is no good, the rest of the statute\nwould survive. Isn't that basically --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think that's right Justice\nSouter -- Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I don't know how you\nwould sever a health exception that is not there.\nThey're saying if something is in here, you can sever\nit and we'll be satisfied with what's left. In\neffect, if we were to enjoin certain applications, we\nwould be injecting an exception that they've\nrejected. And whatever that may be, it does not seem\nto be severance.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Two answers, Justice\nSouter. First of all, I think that if you look at what\nthe New Hampshire legislators were concerned about,\nthey were concerned about a broad health exception\nthat would undermine the statute, not an emergency\nexception.\nAs to the severability point, I think in\nsome respects, severability is the wrong way of\nlooking at it. In the context of as-applied\nchallenges, this Court has not rigorously said that\nyou look at the applications and see whether they're\nseverable. The idea is that a statute is not\nconstitutional in certain applications.\nBut the New Hampshire legislature I think\nwas -- even had the belt and suspenders to worry about\nthat if you had a different view of that, it's the view\nthat actually Justice Thomas embraced in his Booker\nopinion, that actually you do look at severance when you\ndo applications. The New Hampshire legislature\ncouldn't have been clearer, because they said not\nonly do you sever the provisions, but sever the\napplications. We want to save as much of this statue\nas we can.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The end of the statute\ndoesn't say that. The end of that provision says\nsever a provision.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: You're right, Justice\nGinsburg, but I don't think you look only at the end\nof the statute. It clearly says, if any provision of\nthis subdivision or the application thereof to any\nperson or circumstance is held invalid, such\ninvalidity shall not affect the provision or\napplications of this subdivision which can be given\neffect without invalide - sorry -- provisions or\napplications.\nIt seems like they had this case in mind,\nthat there were circumstances in which perhaps some\ncourt would say it was unconstitutional to apply it\nand that's not a basis to strike down the whole\nstatute.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: General Clement, there\nis usually great caution on the part of the Court\nfrom tampering with the statute. So excision is one\nthing. You just drop a provision. That's not possible\nhere. The Court has been extremely reluctant about caret\nmarks, which is what -- there is no problem with what the\nlegislature did. It just didn't do enough. So the court\nwould have to add a provision. Not subtract. There is\nnothing to subtract. There's an addition and courts have\nbeen reluctant to do that. They feel much more\ncomfortable cutting something out than putting\nsomething in.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, Justice\nGinsburg, I don't think that accurately describes the\nway the courts have approached as-applied cases.\nThey often hold statutes unconstitutional as applied.\nThink of Wisconsin against Yoder. This Court said that\na general compulsory education statute didn't apply\nto the Amish. It's just unconstitutional as applied.\nThey didn't think, boy, you know, the Wisconsin\nlegislature didn't expressly put in an exception --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Nobody asked them to do\nanything other than that.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think that's\ntrue, Justice Ginsburg, but it just shows that that's\nthe way that this Court approaches as-applied cases.\nIt's not a matter of reading something in. its saying\nthe statute doesn't apply. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nGeneral. Ms. Dalven, we'll hear now from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JENNIFER DALVEN\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS\nMS. DALVEN: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe unfortunate reality is that some\npregnant teens experience medical emergencies for\nwhich the appropriate care is an immediate abortion.\nAs the nation's leading medical authorities have\nexplained, delaying appropriate care for even a very\nshort period can be catastrophic and puts the teen at\nrisk for liver damage, kidney damage, stroke and\ninfertility.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose I am concerned\nthat the record doesn't explain to me one way or the\nother whether or not your and the medical\nprofession's definition of immediate allows time to\nmake one telephone call to a judge.\nMS. DALVEN: Your Honor, several\nresponses. First, the undisputed evidence here is\nthat women in some emergencies, every minute is\ncritical. Every minute puts them at risk of losing\ntheir future fertility and of major organ damage.\nThat is confirmed by the nation's leading medical\nauthorities which say that there is - that even very\nshort delays --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, there can be\nnurses or attendants that can get the judge on the\nline.\nMS. DALVEN: Yes, Your Honor. Two\nresponses. First, the procedures that we submitted\nin our supplemental brief that were approved by the\nNew Hampshire Supreme Court made quite clear that\nthere is no procedure for getting the judge on the\nphone. And in addition, any delay --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I've looked at\nthose procedures and it seems to me that those are\ninterpreted as what should happen in the ordinary\ncase. They certainly don't preclude making a phone\ncall and there can be phone calls for warrants in\ncriminal cases in New Hampshire. That's specifically\nprovided.\nMS. DALVEN: Yes, Your Honor, but I\nbelieve that as Justice Breyer pointed out, if this\nemergency happens on a Saturday, there is no\nprovision whatsoever for the minor. In addition --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The problem was, it\nseems to me, that the bypass procedure can go a long\nway toward saving this statute, but this was not\nlitigated in the trial courts. We don't know what\nNew Hampshire's position is going to be. We don't\nknow what the facts are.\nMS. DALVEN: Your Honor, I think what is\nquite clear from all the briefs is that once a minor\narrives in the emergency room, it is too late for her\nto go to court. There is, as we said, every minute\nis critical and any delay from the time that the\ndoctor faces a pregnant teen, determines that she\nmust have an immediate abortion, any delay from that\npoint forward puts the minor's health at risk.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, Surely not the delay\nfor a quick phone call. Let's assume New Hampshire sets\nup a special office open 24 hours a day and this is\nthe abortion judge, and he can be reached any time\nanywhere. It takes 30 seconds to place a phone call.\nMS. DALVEN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This is really an emergency\nsituation? I guess if that's the case, the doctor better\nnot put on his gloves.\nMS. DALVEN: No, Your Honor, I think then that\nthe question would be what would be the purpose in\nsuch a statute if all you had to do was literally\ncall a number and the judge would say, okay. If the\njudge had no time -- the nurse had no time to\nrelay the facts, the judge had no time to ask any\nquestions, the judge had no time to consider the\nevidence or look at the law, there is a real question\nabout what potential purpose there could be of\nrequiring even that small delay before a minor gets\nthe immediate treatment she needs.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The purpose is to save\nthe statute which has thousands of applications that\nare valid.\nMS. DALVEN: But Your Honor, I don't think\nthat putting a teen's health at risk, respectfully,\nis -- I don't think saving a statute is worth putting\na teen's health at risk.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if your\nobjection goes to the adequacy of the bypass\nprocedure, what is wrong with a pre-enforcement\nchallenge by physicians, presumably with standing,\nchallenging the bypass procedure? Why should you be\nable to challenge the act as a whole if your\nobjection is so narrowly focused?\nMS. DALVEN: Two points, Chief Justice\nRoberts. First is that our objection isn't to the\nbypass process. We believe that there would be --\nregardless of how good the procedures the New\nHampshire Supreme Court set up, there would still be\ninherent delay between the time a doctor diagnoses\na patient and the time they get to court and get\nthe order. So it's not a problem with the judicial\nbypass.\nThe second question --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's a problem\nthat arises only in the emergency situations.\nMS. DALVEN: That's correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So bring in a\npre-enforcement challenge concerning compliance with\nthe act in emergency situations. Why does that even\nimplicate the vast majority of the cases that don't\ncreate emergency situations?\nMS. DALVEN: As Justice Ginsburg pointed\nout, we believe that is this case. There is nothing\nbetween this case -- different between this\ncase --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This case doesn't\ninvolve an emergency situation. This is a facial\nchallenge. There is no case at issue at all.\nMS. DALVEN: Your Honor, the State\nconceded a pre-enforcement challenge brought by a\ndoctor before any particular patient was at risk\nwould be proper.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but what resulted\nhere, it was the invalidation of the entire statute and\nall of its applications? Is that how it now stands?\nMS. DALVEN: That believe is how --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Okay, so the question\nyou're being asked is, how can that be narrowed in some\nfashion to focus on the problem? The statute may\nwell have a majority of valid applications. So how\ncan we narrow the application? And what of our\ndoctrines allow a narrower application? So you need\nto focus on that. Obviously, it's a matter of\nconcern.\nMS. DALVEN: Sure. I think this\nCourt in Casey addressed that consideration. And\nCasey was essentially this case, a pre-enforcement\nchallenge brought to the adequacy of the medical\nemergency exception. And this Court held that if the\nlaw prohibited an immediate abortion for some of the\nvery same conditions we outline here, it would have\nbeen unconstitutional.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's because the\nCourt explained the inadequacies it identified were\npresent in the large fraction of cases. We don't know\nif that's true here.\nMS. DALVEN: Respectfully, Your Honor, not\nwith respect to the medical emergency exception. I\nthink that was true with respect to the spousal\nnotice provision, but not at all with respect to the\nmedical emergency exception.\nIn this case, it was -- we're talking about\nthe same conditions that were in Casey and here as well.\nAnd actually here there were additional considerations\nbecause in Casey, there was a medical emergency\ndefinition that extended to some health threatening\ncircumstances and here there is none.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So why wouldn't it be\nentirely adequate to protect what you're concerned\nabout to say this New Hampshire statute is\nunconstitutional to the extent that it fails to\nprovide an exception for situations where there is\nimminent danger to health, and then all those\nimmediate dangers to health situations would be left\nunregulated. The statute doesn't reach them.\nBut nonemergency cases would continue to\nbe governed by the statute. Why couldn't -- in other\nwords, why wasn't that the appropriate judgment for\nthe First Circuit to have entered in this case, to\nsay statutes fine for nonemergency cases, but for\nemergency cases, there is effectively no law?\nMS. DALVEN: Your Honor, that would solve\nthe constitutional problem in this case, but I\nbelieve it is not the best course for three reasons.\nFirst, as this Court has already discussed, the States\naround the country have adopted at least 10 different\nmedical emergency definitions. And this Court has no\nway to know which if any of those formulations --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you wouldn't\nhave -- it would be that the emergency is not\nregulated. The private doctors can act in a medical\nemergency. They are not controlled by any\nlegislation.\nMS. DALVEN: Yes, Your Honor. But many of\nthe States -- a few States have chosen to have\nspecial exceptions that just say medical emergency.\nMost of them define --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But we're dealing with\nNew Hampshire. We have a specific case that\nchallenged New Hampshire's law. So can you focus on\nthis one?\nMS. DALVEN: Yes, Your Honor. I think we\nstill don't know which definition New Hampshire\nwould use.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, suppose it were from\nyour point of view.\nI don't know from the other side's point of view, I\nguess it would satisfy you to say that this statute can\nnot be enforced in any circumstance in which a\nphysician certifies in good faith that he believes an\nimmediate abortion is necessary for the health of the\nmother. All you're looking to is the state of mind\nof the physician.\nNow, the problem that I think we would see\nwith that is you would then be writing into the law\nthe broadest possible definition of what that health\nexception means. So I'm not sure the New\nHampshire legislator would have wanted to do it and\nI'm not sure the other side would like to do it. But\nlooking at it from your point of view, do you have\nany objection to it?\nMS. DALVEN: No, that's correct, Your Honor.\nThat would solve the constitutional problem here, but\nYour Honor is right, I think there is a significant\nconcern about whether that's what New Hampshire would\nhave done --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that\nwould be litigated in a pre-enforcement, as-applied\nchallenge. I mean, you don't assume -- the fact that\nthis narrower focused proceeding is going to be --\ncould be brought doesn't mean -- doesn't answer the\nquestion of how it's going to come out.\nBut presumably the litigation would be\nvery similar to what we've seen in this case, in\nwhich a doctor is saying, well, you do need an\nimmediate medical exception. Others are saying the\njudicial bypass adequately addresses the concerns.\nBut it would be focused on the provision that is\ncausing you concern rather than the statute as a\nwhole.\nMS. DALVEN: Your Honor, I believe that\nthat really is this case. There is nothing in the\ncomplaint that says this is a facial challenge, and\nwe only want a declaration that the statute is\nunconstitutional and enjoin it in its entirety, and\nif we can't have that, we want nothing else. We expect\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's what happened\nand you're here defending that judgment.\nMS. DALVEN: Yes, Your Honor, and we believe\nit was the proper course, but there is nothing in the\ncomplaint that says that we only want a total\ninvalidation.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Then is there any\nobjection by you to remanding this thing to let it be\nmore narrowly focused?\nMS. DALVEN: I believe it is not the\nbetter course for three reasons. One is we can't\ntell what exception the New Hampshire legislature\nwould have chosen. In addition, I think there is\nreal cause for concern about rewriting this law for\nNew Hampshire. If this Court says that that's the\nproper course, I believe that the federal judiciary\nwill be faced with rewriting abortion law after\nabortion law after abortion law.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your complaint\nasked for a preliminary and permanent injunction\nagainst the act.\nMS. DALVEN: Yes, that's right, Your\nHonor. Also two points, though. We asked for any\nother relief that is just and proper and we had other\nclaims that could not be solved by a more narrow --\nby more narrow relief, we claimed that the act's\njudicial bypass doesn't -- isn't sufficient under\nthis Court's case -- this Court's decision in Bellotti\nII, it doesn't provide for confidentiality and then\nthere is no way to remedy that without facial\ninvalidation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't want you to agree\nto this unless you've focused on it and think it\nreally is your position. I take it, as I'm\nlistening, that you would not object to an injunction\nthat says that this statute cannot be applied in any\ncircumstance where a doctor, in good faith, himself\nor herself, believes that there is a health\nemergency, period.\nNow, I take it as soon as we get more\nnarrow than that, you might object on the ground\nthat that will leave ambiguous cases where there\nreally is a health emergency, but the doctor doesn't\nknow what to do and would have to go to court, by\nwhich time it will be too late.\nMS. DALVEN: That's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Have I stated it\ncorrectly? You've focused on it, thought about it,\nstated it?\nMS. DALVEN: I appreciate that and yes,\nYour Honor, I have.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Thank you.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about in good faith\nand with substantial support in sound medicine.\nMS. DALVEN: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, why should the\ndoctor who is very negligent and doesn't know what\nhe's doing, why should he be protected?\nMS. DALVEN: Your Honor, I believe your\nquestion focuses on exactly why this Court should\nfacially invalidate. It requires this Court to\ndecide additional constitutional questions --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's just one more\ncondition, good faith is not enough. You can have a\ngood faith quack.\nMS. DALVEN: Your Honor, we believe that\nwould be unconstitutional, and because it would\nsubject a doctor to going to jail for providing care\nthat he honestly believed was necessary to save a\npatient's organs, to save a patient's future\nfertility, to save a patient's vision. We believe\nparticularly in an area as controversial as abortion,\nthat that is inappropriate. But again, after --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sure that's the case\nwith regard to other medical procedures, if you're\ngrossly negligent, it's a criminal offense, I'm sure,\nin most States.\nMS. DALVEN: I believe it's generally a\nmedical malpractice and not a ciminal liability. But\nin any event, this is a question for the Court. And\nin National Treasury Employees Union, this Court said\nthat we're writing more narrow relief requires the\nCourt to answer additional constitutional questions\nnot directly presented by the case, the appropriate\ncourse is to facially invalidate and let the\nlegislature decide how to write the exception. We\nbelieve that's the appropriate course here as well.\nIn addition, going back to the legislative\nabdication point, we believe that facially\ninvalidating -- rewriting the law here would\neliminate any incentive for legislatures to pass\nconstitutional laws in the first instance.\nThis was a clear requirement. This Court\nhas said for 30 years you cannot endanger women's\nhealth, you must have an exception for health\nthreatening emergencies. New Hampshire did not\ninclude such an exception. And if this Court\nrewrites it, it will in essence give a green\nlight to legislatures around the country to pass\nbroad restrictions and leave it women and their\ndoctors to go to the courts and be the full\ndefenders of the right --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If the model of this\ncase, is doctors come to court, doesn't have to have\nan actual patient class action and the court says the\nstatute cannot be applied to a medical necessity,\nperiod. No fancy frills of adding another things which\ncourts generally don't do. But then there would be no\nregulation of medical emergencies. Why isn't that what\n-- doesn't that fit the pattern of the case you've\nbrought and couldn't the First Circuit have done that\nand then you would have no complaint about the rest of\nthe statute?\nMS. DALVEN: The First Circuit could have\ndone that. We did have additional claims like\nconfidentiality.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, I know that.\nMS. DALVEN: But the First Circuit could\nhave done it. We believe the First Circuit was\ncorrect in not doing that for the two reasons I\ndiscussed and an additional reason as well.\nAs Justice Souter pointed out, we don't\nknow at all that the legislature would have passed\nthis law with a broader exception. Indeed, 153 New\nHampshire legislators have told this Court that there\nis significant doubt about whether they would. And I\nknow that might be surprising to some people, but I\nwould like to explain why, in the world of abortion\npolitics, it's not at all surprising.\nSome folks with good faith believe that any\nexception beyond one for a life-saving emergency\nrenders a ban -- a abortion restriction meaningless.\nAnd they refuse on principle to vote for any broader\nexception, any ban, any restriction that has a\nbroader exception.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Then they shouldn't have\nvoted for the severability provision which clearly\nsays if, in one of its applications, it's invalid,\nthe rest can be given effect without the invalid\nprovisions. I mean, the severability provision\nreally just flatly contradicts your assertion that\nthe New Hampshire legislature wouldn't want this to\nhappen.\nMS. DALVEN: Your Honor, a few things.\nFirst, we don't believe that the severability clause\ndirects the court to sever applications. Second,\nneither this Court nor New Hampshire courts treat\nseverability clauses as mandates. The question is\nstill whether, if there is significant doubt about\nwhether the legislature would have wanted it, they do\nnot sever, and as particularly whereas here, this\nCourt would have to make decisions for the legislature\nabout what that exception should look like.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this\nhistorical information? Since the decision of the\ndistrict court and the decision of the court of\nappeals, has the legislature considered enacting a\ndifferent statute that would solve the problems?\nMS. DALVEN: They have not, Your Honor.\nThere has been no bill put forward, to my knowledge.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to be that it\nwouldn't have been all that hard to do. I don't know.\nMS. DALVEN: That's right, Your Honor.\nThey could have enacted a law with a medical\nemergency exception and we could have all gone home.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, maybe they\nassumed that the medical health exception of the sort\nyou're arguing for is not constitutionally required\nand that's what would be litigated in a narrow\nfocused challenge on the adequacy or inadequacy of a\nbypass procedure. Maybe they assumed it would follow\nthe Salerno precedent, and they didn't have to worry\nabout severing in light of particular\nunconstitutional applications.\nMS. DALVEN: Perhaps that is true, Your\nHonor, but I still believe that that is this case,\nthat there really is no different -- I mean, in\nCasey, the plaintiffs brought a facial challenge\nbefore the law took effect to the adequate --\nchallenging the adequacy of a medical emergency\nexception.\nAnd this Court indicated that if the law\nprohibited an immediate abortion for women with the\nconditions Dr. Goldner described in his declaration\nhere, it would have been unconstitutional and some\nrelief would have been appropriate, even though that\nwas a facial challenge and even though the alleged\ninadequacies of the medical emergency would harm\nrelatively few women. So I don't think that there is\nany bar to this Court if they --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think the\nstatute, putting aside the medical emergency issue\nunder our precedence, is the parental notification\naspect of the statute constitutional?\nMS. DALVEN: No, Your Honor. We had\nadditional claims --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Other than the\nconfidentiality?\nMS. DALVEN: We believe we had three\nclaims, the health exception, the medical emergency\nexception for health threatening emergencies. The\ndeath exception we believe is also inadequate and the\nconfidentiality. In addition, the procedures that the\ncourt issued -- the New Hampshire Supreme Court\napproved raise an additional problem as well. So\nthere are claims in addition to the health threatening\nemergency.\nIf there are no further questions from the\nCourt. Thank You.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n(Whereupon, at 11:53 a.m., the\nabove-entitled case was submitted.)\n"

        "content": "(11:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear\nargument next in Ayotte versus Planned Parenthood of\nNorthern New England. General Ayotte.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KELLY A. AYOTTE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. AYOTTE: Mr. Chief Justice and may\nit please the Court:\nThe Court of Appeals struck down New\nHampshire's parental notification act on its face\nbased upon a potential application of the act that even\nrespondents concede may only arise in the smallest\nfraction of cases. In doing so, the act was rendered\nineffective in the overwhelming number of\napplications where it is unquestionably\nconstitutional, and State officials were denied the\nopportunity to imply -- apply and enforce New\nHampshire's act within constitutional limits.\nNew Hampshire's act can be applied in a\nmanner to protect a minor's health if the rare case\narises where a medical emergency occurs that requires\nan immediate abortion. In that rare case, if it does\narise, where an abortion has to be performed\nimmediately and the child does not want to notify a\nparent, there is a judicial bypass mechanism\navailable which requires New Hampshire courts to act\npromptly and without delay and in the best interests\nof the minor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I interrupt you at\nthis point? Because there is one thing that I'm not\nsure that I understand about your position, and one\nway of reading your brief takes you a step beyond\nwhat you have just said. So I would like to get\nclear on this.\nAnd I understood your argument to be that\ngiven the safeguards such as judicial override, there\nsimply was no -- there was no need to read the health\nexception in, that in fact it was taken care of --\nany of the issues that might be raised in arguing for\nthe need for health exception in fact were addressed\nby the statute.\nThe point at which I'm not clear on your\nposition is -- occurs in what you've said on page 11\nof your yellow brief, if you could get that out. Do\nyou have the carry over paragraph on 11? You go\nthrough the kind of a worst case analysis. And you\nsay, well, you know, assuming that all of the\nsafeguards somehow do not work, finally, in the\nunlikely event that a parent refuses to waive the\n48-hour waiting period and so on, a doctor who\nperforms an emergency abortion under such\ncircumstances would not be subject to either criminal\nprosecution or civil liability because his or her\nconduct would not only be constitutionally protected\nbut would be independently justifiable, and then you\ncite the competing harms. What do you mean when you\nsay it would be constitutionally protected?\nI read that as suggesting that there was\nindeed a constitutional requirement for some kind of\na health exception, but that may not be what you\nmeant. What do you mean by constitutionally\nprotected? What are you getting at?\nMS. AYOTTE: Justice Souter, in that\ninstance, we did not say that it was an independent\nconstitutional requirement that there be a health\nexception, but certainly reading this Court's cases,\nwe should apply our act in a manner to protect if\nthat rare case arises where an emergency abortion\nwould come forward. And, if a physician were\nprosecuted under those circumstances, we believe not\nonly would he have a statutory ability to say this\nprosecution is inappropriate given our law, but also\ngiven those rare circumstances, we do not think that\nhe, under the Constitution, may be prosecuted.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And if he said, \"I may\nnot be prosecuted under the Constitution because,\"\nwhat follows \"because,\" in your view?\nMS. AYOTTE: I may not because New\nHampshire's act may not be applied in a manner to\nensure that if a minor in that rare circumstance\nneeds an immediate abortion, that she receives that\nimmediate medical care in those circumstances.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Doesn't that mean because\nthere is a required health exception? I mean, isn't\nthat what you're saying?\nMS. AYOTTE: Justice Souter, not that\nthere is an express requirement of a health exception\nbut that the law cannot be implied in a manner to\ninfringe on the minor's health if that rare emergency\ncase arises.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Your first answer to\nJustice Souter was that the physician would say you\ncan't be prosecuted under our law. Do you mean this\nact that we're looking at here? Or do you mean the\nlaw generally including constitutional protections\nthat this Court has proclaimed?\nMS. AYOTTE: Justice Kennedy, in that\nlimited circumstance, we do not believe that the\nphysician would be prosecuted under our parental\nnotification act, given that there is a mechanism --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Because of the text of\nthe act or because of some policy that the attorney\ngeneral would follow in order just to decline to\nprosecute? We want to know what this act says in the\ninstance posed by Justice Souter.\nMS. AYOTTE: Justice Kennedy, with\nrespect to the act itself, assuming it were a life --\nexcuse me, a health emergency short of a\nlife-threatening emergency, where a minor did not\nwant to notify her parents and assuming those\nsituations came forward and someone was unable to\nreach a judge, the act itself provides a mechanism in\nit that anticipates providing a judge where\nnecessary, and so that would be the ability of a\nminor in those circumstances to seek a judge.\nBut if for some reason all of those\nsituations came together and the minor could not seek\na judicial bypass in those instances, there is an\nexisting provision of New Hampshire law, our\ncompeting harms defense, that we believe protects the\nphysician in those circumstances.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Let's just imagine a real\ncircumstance. A 15 year-old walks in 2:00 in the\nmorning on Saturday into the emergency room and the\ndoctor looks at her, she's pregnant, she has this\nvery high blood pressure, whatever. And the doctor\nthinks to himself, he thinks, well, immediate\nabortion, no question, immediately deliver the child.\nIf I don't, I don't think she's going to die but\nshe'll never have children.\nAnd he's thinking that. What's supposed\nto happen? He calls up Pam Pevagoglio or Pam\nLivingston and there is no answer. It's 2:00 in the\nmorning and there is one of those things, leave a\nmessage, okay? Should I call your parents? No.\nThey don't know I'm pregnant. Now, what's supposed\nto happen?\nMS. AYOTTE: Justice Breyer, the\nphysician in those instances could perform the\nimmediate abortion.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't say that in\nthe statute. It suggests the contrary. So what is\nthe particular provision of New Hampshire law that\ntells that -- I mean, the doctor -- all these things\nare, you know, questions of probability. And he\ndoesn't want to risk being prosecuted and he doesn't\nwant to risk losing his license. And so what\nparticular provision -- he happens to have his lawyer\nwith him.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: What does the lawyer say?\nOkay? What's the provision that saves him? There is\nno health exemption in this statute.\nMS. AYOTTE: Your Honor, his lawyer\nwould advise him, in those circumstances, that the\ncompeting harms defense would protect his actions\nbecause he needs to act urgently necessary -- in an\nurgently necessary circumstance.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Would it protect him\nfrom a civil damages action as well as prosecution in\na criminal case?\nMS. AYOTTE: Justice O'Connor, by the\nplain language of the competing harms defense, it\nalso precludes civil liability. I would also say that\nthat lawyer would also advise him, if given the\nopportunity, the attorney general is prepared also to\nissue an opinion describing the applicability of the\ncompeting harms defense in this very rare\ncircumstance, should it arise.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How do we know? I mean,\nwhat you're saying is fine, but how do we know that\nthat's actually the law? I mean, there are a lot of\npeople who absolutely in very good faith would say\nthat it isn't competing harm. They would say that\nthe competing right that the life of the fetus is more\nimportant than the possibility of the mother having\nchildren in the future herself.\nSee, there are people in good faith on\nboth sides of this argument. And so how do we know\nthat the New Hampshire statute is going to do -- not\nthe statute, but your competing harms defense is\ngoing to do for this particular woman what a health\nexception would do?\nMS. AYOTTE: Justice Breyer, because\nthe harm that is being weighed here is the harm of\nurgently providing care to this minor who needs it,\nas opposed to the harm that the act is trying to get\nat, which is notification of parents. It's not\nwhether or not the minor can have an abortion. The\nminor can always go forward and have an abortion\nunder these circumstances.\nSo people aren't weighing the right of the\nfetus, in this instance, to the right of the mother's\nhealth. So the weighing is quite easy. And if given\nthe opportunity, my office would be prepared to issue\nan opinion as to the applicability of this defense.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But, your opinion --\nthat's the real problem here for the doctor who is on\nthe line. And you said the lawyer would say, oh,\nyou've got this defense of -- what do you call it harm --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Competing harm.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Competing harms, a defense --\nI think that a lawyer who cares about his client\nwould say, defense is not what we want. What we want\nis there is no claim, not that you have to put up a defense\nand maybe the attorney general will give us a\nletter saying that we come under that defense.\nWouldn't a careful lawyer say, what you need to be\nprotected is that there is no claim for doing what\nyou're doing?\nMS. AYOTTE: Justice Ginsburg, in the\nSimopoulos case considered by this Court, one of\nthe issues that was raised was a medical -- the\nphysician was prosecuted for performing an abortion\noutside the parameters of the Virginia act. And the\nphysician failed to raise a medical necessity defense.\nThis Court held that that was sufficient prosecution,\nthat that was okay. And this would work the same way.\nOnce the physician raises a competing harms defense --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: General, may I just point\nthis -- suppose the lawyer or the doctor are aware of\nthe legislative history and say, well, generally that's\ntrue. But when you have a legislative history that\nsuggests that the legislature considered this very\ndefense and rejected it in the statute, would then that\nthen give them some concern?\nMS. AYOTTE: Justice Stevens, the\nlegislative history -- there certainly was some\nindication that the legislature did not want a\ngeneral health exception. There is no indication in\nthe legislative history that the legislature intended\nto preclude this narrow category of cases which\nconstitute emergency cases short of that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But if they discussed\nthe issue on the floor of the legislature, why\nwouldn't they have drafted the precise protection\nthey thought appropriate?\nMS. AYOTTE: Your Honor, when they\ndiscussed the history on the floor of the House and\nSenate, they felt that it protected for emergencies\nand there was no discussion of this narrow category\nof cases short of death.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you have another\npoint here, don't you, about how general this statute\nis. We don't normally interpret statutes this way,\nthat they are totally invalid if any application of\nthem would be unconstitutional. That's not what we do\nwith statutes normally, is it?\nMS. AYOTTE: Justice Scalia, no. In\nfact, the analysis, if you look at this one potential\napplication, this -- the standard applied by the\nCourt of Appeals in this case goes well beyond even a\nsubstantial overbreadth test that is applied by this\nCourt in the first amendment context.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In the first amendment.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Am I right in\nreading your briefs that you don't object to a\npre-enforcement challenge to the bypass procedure\nitself brought by physicians, for example?\nMS. AYOTTE: Mr. Chief Justice, no, we\ndo not object in that sense. We think that is a very\ngood mechanism to bring forth a case given that this\nCourt has granted third-party standing to physicians\nto resolve these types of claims. And teh benefit --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I gather that\nthe debate on the evidence and the circumstances that\nmight arise in that case would be quite similar to\nthe debate in the present context. In other words,\nthere would be the same discussion between the\ndifferent physicians about what emergencies arise and\nin what circumstances and whether that creates a\nproblem and whether you can get to the courts in time\nand so on. It would be the same underlying sort of\nevidence that we have here, right?\nMS. AYOTTE: Mr. Chief Justice, it\nwould, but it would be much more narrowly focused in\nterms of bringing it as an as-applied challenge, this\nwas brought --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How would it be\nas-applied? Look at your reply brief at page 3. And\nyou've made it very clear, and I think that it is helpful\nthat you did, that there could be this pre-enforcement\naction by doctors who would not have to wait until faced\nwith an actual medical emergency to bring the suit.\nYou've talking about this small category of\ncases, but I take it from what you have read -- what the\nlines I've just read, that you envision a doctor who says,\nsooner or later, I'm going to have such a case. Right\nnow, I don't know and I can't know until it's too late to\ncome to any court, so I'm going to bring this\npre-enforcement which you characterized as-applied. But I\ndon't see how its as-applied, if if the physician just\nsays, as you put it, I don't have to wait until faced with\nan actual medical emergency to bring this suit. So what\nis the relief, what is the lawsuit that you envision would\nbe proper?\nMS. AYOTTE: Justice Ginsburg, the\nlawsuit would be a pre-enforcement as-applied\nchallenge and the physician would bring the claim and\nwould say, as applied to me, I perform abortions, I\nalso perform abortions on minors. I need to perform\nan abortion in these emergency settings. The court\ncan issue an order, presuming it's not satisfied with\nthe protections that are set forth in New Hampshire\nlaw that I've described.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Could you do that as a\nclass action?\nMS. AYOTTE: Depending on the\ncircumstance, he may be able to.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the\ncircumstance? All you said here is there coule be a\npre-enforcement challenge by doctors who would not have to\nwait until faced with an actual medical emergency.\nMS. AYOTTE: Justice -- I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why isn't that this\ncase? I don't understand.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, exactly.\nMS. AYOTTE: Justice Stevens, this is\nnot this case because this case was brought as a\nfacial challenge. Our entire act was struck down\nbased upon that one potential --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You mean he has to bring the\nas-applied challenge when he has the patient in\nhis office? He has to wait until he has the patient\nin the office, is that what you mean?\nMS. AYOTTE: No, he doesn't. He can\nbring it before the patient is in his office and then\nthe court could issue relief which would be much more\nconsistent with the principles of certainly separation of\npowers and allowing the overwhelming number of our\napplications of our statutes that are valid to go\nforward.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We're talking about a\nlawsuit which asks for declaration, not that the\nentire statute is invalid. But that, when faced with\nan emergency of the sort that this discussion has\naddressed, the physician can go ahead and perform the\nabortion?\nMS. AYOTTE: That's correct, Justice\nScalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Quite a different lawsuit\nfrom this one.\nMS. AYOTTE: That's quite a different\nlawsuit and a lawsuit that would be certainly, from\nthe State's perspective, would allow the overwhelming\nnumber of applications of this statute where there is\nno dispute that it works well, to go forward.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But in Justice Scalia's\ncase, would not the reason for that relief have to be\na finding that the statute is unconstitutional? You\ncan't just grant the relief because you think it's a\ngood idea.\nMS. AYOTTE: Justice Stevens, it would\nbe only in the context of that one particular\napplication as applied to that physician, which would\nhave stare decisis --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It would be a\nfinding that the bypass procedure is inadequate which\ndoesn't necessarily implicate the general\nnotification provisions.\nMS. AYOTTE: Mr. Chief Justice, that\nwould be the case. And certainly if that one\napplication, in that one potential rare case was\nfound not to be valid, then the remainder of the\napplications can go forward. And that is how most\ncases work with respect to as-applied relief.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then I think what you're\nsaying essentially is that the First Circuit was concerned\nwith this category, wanted to give pre-enforcement relief\nto the physician, so what they did was write except that\nthey should have said this statute is not\nenforceable where there is a risk to the woman's health\nand it cannot be applied in any such cases. Where there\nis a risk to the health, then the statute is okay.\nMS. AYOTTE: Justice Ginsburg, the\nFirst Circuit went well beyond because it focused on\na general health exception, they've now focusing it on an\nemergency exception. But certainly the relief should\nhave been as-applied. If I may reserve the rest of\nmy time for rebuttal?\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Did you ask that the\nrelief ordered below be more restrictive? Was that\nchallenged after the judgment was entered?\nMS. AYOTTE: Justice --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Did the Court below\nhave a chance to consider tailoring it more narrowly,\nas you suggest today?\nMS. AYOTTE: Justice O'Connor, we did\nraise the application of the severance clause below,\nalthough the court, both at the district court level and\nthe First Circuit appeared to look at the -- the lack\nof a general health exception as a per se\nconstitutional problem that rendered the statute as a\nwhole invalid.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: I just am not clear to\nwhat extent you really raised the possibility with\nthe court below of carrying its judgment more\nnarrowly as you're suggesting today should be done.\nMS. AYOTTE: Your Honor, we certainly\nraised the severance issue in the district court.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You've used this word\nseverance now twice. Severance is I excised a clause\nfrom the statute, but you're not asking for that. It's\nnot severance. There is no provision to be severed\nhere. It's putting a caret mark and adding something to\nit. Not taking out any provision, but putting in an\nadditional provision.\nMS. AYOTTE: Your Honor, you're\ncorrect. What our position is is that they did not\nmeet the standard that they should have been able to\nmeet for a facial challenge, which would grant\nas-applied relief which would only be invalid in that\none potential application. If I may reserve the rest\nof my time, with all due respect.\nJUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\nGeneral Clement, we'll hear now from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONER\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice and\nmay it please the Court:\nRespondents elected to bring a facial\nchallenge to New Hampshire's statute and succeeded in\ntheir goal in enjoining the statute in all its\napplications. Despite the facial nature of their\nchallenge, however, they do not contend that the\nstatute is invalid in all or even a large fraction of\nits applications.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that was true in\nCasey.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, I don't think it\nwas, with respect, Justice Souter. This Court found\nas to the spousal notification critically, that there\nwas a large fraction of the applications of the\nstatute that would give rise to the constitutional\nproblem.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, we may argue about\nwhat the fraction may be and we may argue about what\nsubstantiality means. But one thing I don't think we\ncan argue about is that Casey was applying the\nSalerno standard.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, two things,\nJustice Souter. I think, first of all, this case has\ncome up postured as being about a choice between\nSalerno and the large fraction test. And I think in\nsome points, based on the way respondents have\napproached the case, that's become largely beside the\npoint.\nAt footnote 13 of their brief, they could\nnot be more clear, that they are not here contending\nthat the statute is invalid in a large fraction of\ntheir applications. They instead are embracing a per\nse rule that if the statute does not have a health\nexception or an emergency exception clear on its face,\nit is void in its entirety.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Once again, that may be,\nbut after Casey, I don't think one can plausibly\nargue that the Salerno standard is the correct\nstandard. Whatever their position may be, whatever\nfractions of substantiality may mean.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I understand\nthat's your position, Justice Souter, given that you\njoined Justice O'Connor's separate separate writing in\nthe Fargo case. I think, however, that I read the\nopinion in Casey and I see the large fraction\nanalysis only in the spousal notification context.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But why would we have a\nseparate rule on facial challenges merely for spousal\nnotification?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I can think of\ntwo reasons, Justice Souter. First of all,\nbecause this Court applied the no set of\ncircumstances test in Akron II to a parental\nnotification statute, this Court in Casey may not\nhave wanted to overrule Akron II to that extent.\nSecond of all, I think this Court, in that\nvery passage about the large fraction test,\nspecifically distinguished spousal notification\nprovisions from parental notification provisions.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose I were to\nconclude that under Casey, this fraction test applies\nto this case. Suppose I were to say that Salerno\nshould not be applicable in this case. How should I\nrule in this case?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: You should clearly rule\nin the State's favor. And the respondents have\nreally given you no choice because they aren't even\narguing that a large fraction of the applications of\nthe statute are invalid.\nWhat you have before you is really a case\nwhere it's literally a one in a thousand possibility\nthat there is going to be an emergency where the statute\nwill operate. And the real question for you is\nfaced with that kind of case. Do you invalidate 1,000\napplications of this statute noting that 999 of\nthem are constitutional?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could the plaintiffs have\nfiled a narrower action attacking the adequacy of the\nbypass procedure?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Absolutely. And they\nalso could have -- what I think I would envision\nthem filling is an even narrower provision that\nseeks a pre-enforcement declaration, kind of like\nSteffel against Thompson would be the model, that say\nthat this statute can apply in an emergency situation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, that's exactly --\nI'm leaving aside your fraction test, your 100\npercent test, because I don't think they capture all\nthe considerations that are relevant. Focus on what\nyou just said. What you've done is you've tried to\ncreate an injunction that will separate out the sheep\nfrom the goats, all right? The goats are only\n1 percent and the sheep -- But what does it say? I\ndon't think you can say enjoin the bypass procedure,\nbecause if you enjoin the bypass procedure, there goes\ndown the drain your whole parental notification because\nyou can't have parental notification without a bypass\nprocedure.\nI don't think you can say enjoin\nemergencies because to do that, you're going to have\nto get into the greatest difficult issue there is in\nthis area, which is what does that health exception\nmean. And we've said throughout that that health\nexception has to be defined first by a legislature.\nSo if you tell me how to write that\ninjunction, then I'll be able to decide whether it's\npossible for a court just to say, okay, we only\nenjoin the goats as opposed to saying, legislature,\nthis is basically up to you, the whole area.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: And Justice Breyer, I\nwould say the court has some discretion in how it\nformulates that order. It would basically say that\nthis statute is not constitutional as applied to\nthose emergency situations.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, but that's --\nAnd if I could just say, it's no\ndifferent than Steffel against Thompson. There is a\ncase where there is a challenge against a broad\ncriminal trespass statute. The theory in Steffel\nwas not that the whole criminal trespass statute was\nunconstitutional. It was it's unconstitutional if you\napply it to leafletting. And Justice Brennan for a\nunanimous Court said, yes, that's exactly the kind of\nchallenge you can bring. And you can get declaratory\njudgment that says you can't do that, you can't apply\nthe statute as to leafletting. But you don't strike\ndown the entirety of the criminal trespassing statute.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The word leafletting is\nnot as fuzzy around the edges as health exception,\ngiven the fact that lots of people think health\nexception is a way of getting abortion on demand.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you agree with Justice\nBreyer that the legislature can draw this with more\nprecision than a court could?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, I don't Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, that seems to be\na solution, that the legislature can make it precise,\nalthough a court could not.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think the court could\nissue any order a legislature could issue. And I\nthink the fact that the court would have some\ndiscretion is an answer to the argument that, oh,\nwell, if you leave this to the courts, you're cutting\nthe legislature out of this. I think that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why wouldn't it be an\nabuse of discretion in this case? Because there\nseems to be an ample record here that the\nlegislature, or a majority of the legislature made a\nconscious choice that they would rather have no\nstatute than a statute with a health exception in it.\nThey deliberately said the only statute we want is\none without a health exception.\nTherefore, even if you touch all the bases\nthat Justice Breyer has laid out, don't you end up\nwith a position that if we were to craft such a\nlimitation, we would be flying quite precisely in the\nface of the expressed legislative intent.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think that's\nright, Justice Souter and I think it's because you\nhave to be careful. I think it's easy to use loose\nlanguage about a health exception. And I think if\nyou looked at the First Circuit opinion, they seem to\nsuggest there needs to be a health exception. And I\nthink in the context of a parental notification\nstatute, a health exception as opposed to a narrow\nexception for emergencies is a non --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Whatever you call it,\ncall it a health exception, call it an XYZ exception.\nThey knew what they were getting at, they knew what\nthey were worried about and they said, we will have a\nstatute without it or we will have no statute.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, Justice Souter,\nI think they were --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought there was a separate\nseverability. Didn't it have a severability provision?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: They did and it's extreme\nseverability.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And so it said just the\nopposite. It said just the opposite, that if the\nhealth exception is no good, the rest of the statute\nwould survive. Isn't that basically --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think that's right Justice\nSouter -- Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I don't know how you\nwould sever a health exception that is not there.\nThey're saying if something is in here, you can sever\nit and we'll be satisfied with what's left. In\neffect, if we were to enjoin certain applications, we\nwould be injecting an exception that they've\nrejected. And whatever that may be, it does not seem\nto be severance.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Two answers, Justice\nSouter. First of all, I think that if you look at what\nthe New Hampshire legislators were concerned about,\nthey were concerned about a broad health exception\nthat would undermine the statute, not an emergency\nexception.\nAs to the severability point, I think in\nsome respects, severability is the wrong way of\nlooking at it. In the context of as-applied\nchallenges, this Court has not rigorously said that\nyou look at the applications and see whether they're\nseverable. The idea is that a statute is not\nconstitutional in certain applications.\nBut the New Hampshire legislature I think\nwas -- even had the belt and suspenders to worry about\nthat if you had a different view of that, it's the view\nthat actually Justice Thomas embraced in his Booker\nopinion, that actually you do look at severance when you\ndo applications. The New Hampshire legislature\ncouldn't have been clearer, because they said not\nonly do you sever the provisions, but sever the\napplications. We want to save as much of this statue\nas we can.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The end of the statute\ndoesn't say that. The end of that provision says\nsever a provision.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: You're right, Justice\nGinsburg, but I don't think you look only at the end\nof the statute. It clearly says, if any provision of\nthis subdivision or the application thereof to any\nperson or circumstance is held invalid, such\ninvalidity shall not affect the provision or\napplications of this subdivision which can be given\neffect without invalide - sorry -- provisions or\napplications.\nIt seems like they had this case in mind,\nthat there were circumstances in which perhaps some\ncourt would say it was unconstitutional to apply it\nand that's not a basis to strike down the whole\nstatute.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: General Clement, there\nis usually great caution on the part of the Court\nfrom tampering with the statute. So excision is one\nthing. You just drop a provision. That's not possible\nhere. The Court has been extremely reluctant about caret\nmarks, which is what -- there is no problem with what the\nlegislature did. It just didn't do enough. So the court\nwould have to add a provision. Not subtract. There is\nnothing to subtract. There's an addition and courts have\nbeen reluctant to do that. They feel much more\ncomfortable cutting something out than putting\nsomething in.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, Justice\nGinsburg, I don't think that accurately describes the\nway the courts have approached as-applied cases.\nThey often hold statutes unconstitutional as applied.\nThink of Wisconsin against Yoder. This Court said that\na general compulsory education statute didn't apply\nto the Amish. It's just unconstitutional as applied.\nThey didn't think, boy, you know, the Wisconsin\nlegislature didn't expressly put in an exception --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Nobody asked them to do\nanything other than that.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think that's\ntrue, Justice Ginsburg, but it just shows that that's\nthe way that this Court approaches as-applied cases.\nIt's not a matter of reading something in. its saying\nthe statute doesn't apply. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nGeneral. Ms. Dalven, we'll hear now from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JENNIFER DALVEN\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS\nMS. DALVEN: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe unfortunate reality is that some\npregnant teens experience medical emergencies for\nwhich the appropriate care is an immediate abortion.\nAs the nation's leading medical authorities have\nexplained, delaying appropriate care for even a very\nshort period can be catastrophic and puts the teen at\nrisk for liver damage, kidney damage, stroke and\ninfertility.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose I am concerned\nthat the record doesn't explain to me one way or the\nother whether or not your and the medical\nprofession's definition of immediate allows time to\nmake one telephone call to a judge.\nMS. DALVEN: Your Honor, several\nresponses. First, the undisputed evidence here is\nthat women in some emergencies, every minute is\ncritical. Every minute puts them at risk of losing\ntheir future fertility and of major organ damage.\nThat is confirmed by the nation's leading medical\nauthorities which say that there is - that even very\nshort delays --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, there can be\nnurses or attendants that can get the judge on the\nline.\nMS. DALVEN: Yes, Your Honor. Two\nresponses. First, the procedures that we submitted\nin our supplemental brief that were approved by the\nNew Hampshire Supreme Court made quite clear that\nthere is no procedure for getting the judge on the\nphone. And in addition, any delay --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I've looked at\nthose procedures and it seems to me that those are\ninterpreted as what should happen in the ordinary\ncase. They certainly don't preclude making a phone\ncall and there can be phone calls for warrants in\ncriminal cases in New Hampshire. That's specifically\nprovided.\nMS. DALVEN: Yes, Your Honor, but I\nbelieve that as Justice Breyer pointed out, if this\nemergency happens on a Saturday, there is no\nprovision whatsoever for the minor. In addition --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The problem was, it\nseems to me, that the bypass procedure can go a long\nway toward saving this statute, but this was not\nlitigated in the trial courts. We don't know what\nNew Hampshire's position is going to be. We don't\nknow what the facts are.\nMS. DALVEN: Your Honor, I think what is\nquite clear from all the briefs is that once a minor\narrives in the emergency room, it is too late for her\nto go to court. There is, as we said, every minute\nis critical and any delay from the time that the\ndoctor faces a pregnant teen, determines that she\nmust have an immediate abortion, any delay from that\npoint forward puts the minor's health at risk.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, Surely not the delay\nfor a quick phone call. Let's assume New Hampshire sets\nup a special office open 24 hours a day and this is\nthe abortion judge, and he can be reached any time\nanywhere. It takes 30 seconds to place a phone call.\nMS. DALVEN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This is really an emergency\nsituation? I guess if that's the case, the doctor better\nnot put on his gloves.\nMS. DALVEN: No, Your Honor, I think then that\nthe question would be what would be the purpose in\nsuch a statute if all you had to do was literally\ncall a number and the judge would say, okay. If the\njudge had no time -- the nurse had no time to\nrelay the facts, the judge had no time to ask any\nquestions, the judge had no time to consider the\nevidence or look at the law, there is a real question\nabout what potential purpose there could be of\nrequiring even that small delay before a minor gets\nthe immediate treatment she needs.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The purpose is to save\nthe statute which has thousands of applications that\nare valid.\nMS. DALVEN: But Your Honor, I don't think\nthat putting a teen's health at risk, respectfully,\nis -- I don't think saving a statute is worth putting\na teen's health at risk.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if your\nobjection goes to the adequacy of the bypass\nprocedure, what is wrong with a pre-enforcement\nchallenge by physicians, presumably with standing,\nchallenging the bypass procedure? Why should you be\nable to challenge the act as a whole if your\nobjection is so narrowly focused?\nMS. DALVEN: Two points, Chief Justice\nRoberts. First is that our objection isn't to the\nbypass process. We believe that there would be --\nregardless of how good the procedures the New\nHampshire Supreme Court set up, there would still be\ninherent delay between the time a doctor diagnoses\na patient and the time they get to court and get\nthe order. So it's not a problem with the judicial\nbypass.\nThe second question --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's a problem\nthat arises only in the emergency situations.\nMS. DALVEN: That's correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So bring in a\npre-enforcement challenge concerning compliance with\nthe act in emergency situations. Why does that even\nimplicate the vast majority of the cases that don't\ncreate emergency situations?\nMS. DALVEN: As Justice Ginsburg pointed\nout, we believe that is this case. There is nothing\nbetween this case -- different between this\ncase --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This case doesn't\ninvolve an emergency situation. This is a facial\nchallenge. There is no case at issue at all.\nMS. DALVEN: Your Honor, the State\nconceded a pre-enforcement challenge brought by a\ndoctor before any particular patient was at risk\nwould be proper.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but what resulted\nhere, it was the invalidation of the entire statute and\nall of its applications? Is that how it now stands?\nMS. DALVEN: That believe is how --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Okay, so the question\nyou're being asked is, how can that be narrowed in some\nfashion to focus on the problem? The statute may\nwell have a majority of valid applications. So how\ncan we narrow the application? And what of our\ndoctrines allow a narrower application? So you need\nto focus on that. Obviously, it's a matter of\nconcern.\nMS. DALVEN: Sure. I think this\nCourt in Casey addressed that consideration. And\nCasey was essentially this case, a pre-enforcement\nchallenge brought to the adequacy of the medical\nemergency exception. And this Court held that if the\nlaw prohibited an immediate abortion for some of the\nvery same conditions we outline here, it would have\nbeen unconstitutional.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's because the\nCourt explained the inadequacies it identified were\npresent in the large fraction of cases. We don't know\nif that's true here.\nMS. DALVEN: Respectfully, Your Honor, not\nwith respect to the medical emergency exception. I\nthink that was true with respect to the spousal\nnotice provision, but not at all with respect to the\nmedical emergency exception.\nIn this case, it was -- we're talking about\nthe same conditions that were in Casey and here as well.\nAnd actually here there were additional considerations\nbecause in Casey, there was a medical emergency\ndefinition that extended to some health threatening\ncircumstances and here there is none.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So why wouldn't it be\nentirely adequate to protect what you're concerned\nabout to say this New Hampshire statute is\nunconstitutional to the extent that it fails to\nprovide an exception for situations where there is\nimminent danger to health, and then all those\nimmediate dangers to health situations would be left\nunregulated. The statute doesn't reach them.\nBut nonemergency cases would continue to\nbe governed by the statute. Why couldn't -- in other\nwords, why wasn't that the appropriate judgment for\nthe First Circuit to have entered in this case, to\nsay statutes fine for nonemergency cases, but for\nemergency cases, there is effectively no law?\nMS. DALVEN: Your Honor, that would solve\nthe constitutional problem in this case, but I\nbelieve it is not the best course for three reasons.\nFirst, as this Court has already discussed, the States\naround the country have adopted at least 10 different\nmedical emergency definitions. And this Court has no\nway to know which if any of those formulations --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you wouldn't\nhave -- it would be that the emergency is not\nregulated. The private doctors can act in a medical\nemergency. They are not controlled by any\nlegislation.\nMS. DALVEN: Yes, Your Honor. But many of\nthe States -- a few States have chosen to have\nspecial exceptions that just say medical emergency.\nMost of them define --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But we're dealing with\nNew Hampshire. We have a specific case that\nchallenged New Hampshire's law. So can you focus on\nthis one?\nMS. DALVEN: Yes, Your Honor. I think we\nstill don't know which definition New Hampshire\nwould use.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, suppose it were from\nyour point of view.\nI don't know from the other side's point of view, I\nguess it would satisfy you to say that this statute can\nnot be enforced in any circumstance in which a\nphysician certifies in good faith that he believes an\nimmediate abortion is necessary for the health of the\nmother. All you're looking to is the state of mind\nof the physician.\nNow, the problem that I think we would see\nwith that is you would then be writing into the law\nthe broadest possible definition of what that health\nexception means. So I'm not sure the New\nHampshire legislator would have wanted to do it and\nI'm not sure the other side would like to do it. But\nlooking at it from your point of view, do you have\nany objection to it?\nMS. DALVEN: No, that's correct, Your Honor.\nThat would solve the constitutional problem here, but\nYour Honor is right, I think there is a significant\nconcern about whether that's what New Hampshire would\nhave done --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that\nwould be litigated in a pre-enforcement, as-applied\nchallenge. I mean, you don't assume -- the fact that\nthis narrower focused proceeding is going to be --\ncould be brought doesn't mean -- doesn't answer the\nquestion of how it's going to come out.\nBut presumably the litigation would be\nvery similar to what we've seen in this case, in\nwhich a doctor is saying, well, you do need an\nimmediate medical exception. Others are saying the\njudicial bypass adequately addresses the concerns.\nBut it would be focused on the provision that is\ncausing you concern rather than the statute as a\nwhole.\nMS. DALVEN: Your Honor, I believe that\nthat really is this case. There is nothing in the\ncomplaint that says this is a facial challenge, and\nwe only want a declaration that the statute is\nunconstitutional and enjoin it in its entirety, and\nif we can't have that, we want nothing else. We expect\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's what happened\nand you're here defending that judgment.\nMS. DALVEN: Yes, Your Honor, and we believe\nit was the proper course, but there is nothing in the\ncomplaint that says that we only want a total\ninvalidation.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Then is there any\nobjection by you to remanding this thing to let it be\nmore narrowly focused?\nMS. DALVEN: I believe it is not the\nbetter course for three reasons. One is we can't\ntell what exception the New Hampshire legislature\nwould have chosen. In addition, I think there is\nreal cause for concern about rewriting this law for\nNew Hampshire. If this Court says that that's the\nproper course, I believe that the federal judiciary\nwill be faced with rewriting abortion law after\nabortion law after abortion law.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your complaint\nasked for a preliminary and permanent injunction\nagainst the act.\nMS. DALVEN: Yes, that's right, Your\nHonor. Also two points, though. We asked for any\nother relief that is just and proper and we had other\nclaims that could not be solved by a more narrow --\nby more narrow relief, we claimed that the act's\njudicial bypass doesn't -- isn't sufficient under\nthis Court's case -- this Court's decision in Bellotti\nII, it doesn't provide for confidentiality and then\nthere is no way to remedy that without facial\ninvalidation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't want you to agree\nto this unless you've focused on it and think it\nreally is your position. I take it, as I'm\nlistening, that you would not object to an injunction\nthat says that this statute cannot be applied in any\ncircumstance where a doctor, in good faith, himself\nor herself, believes that there is a health\nemergency, period.\nNow, I take it as soon as we get more\nnarrow than that, you might object on the ground\nthat that will leave ambiguous cases where there\nreally is a health emergency, but the doctor doesn't\nknow what to do and would have to go to court, by\nwhich time it will be too late.\nMS. DALVEN: That's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Have I stated it\ncorrectly? You've focused on it, thought about it,\nstated it?\nMS. DALVEN: I appreciate that and yes,\nYour Honor, I have.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Thank you.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about in good faith\nand with substantial support in sound medicine.\nMS. DALVEN: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, why should the\ndoctor who is very negligent and doesn't know what\nhe's doing, why should he be protected?\nMS. DALVEN: Your Honor, I believe your\nquestion focuses on exactly why this Court should\nfacially invalidate. It requires this Court to\ndecide additional constitutional questions --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's just one more\ncondition, good faith is not enough. You can have a\ngood faith quack.\nMS. DALVEN: Your Honor, we believe that\nwould be unconstitutional, and because it would\nsubject a doctor to going to jail for providing care\nthat he honestly believed was necessary to save a\npatient's organs, to save a patient's future\nfertility, to save a patient's vision. We believe\nparticularly in an area as controversial as abortion,\nthat that is inappropriate. But again, after --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sure that's the case\nwith regard to other medical procedures, if you're\ngrossly negligent, it's a criminal offense, I'm sure,\nin most States.\nMS. DALVEN: I believe it's generally a\nmedical malpractice and not a ciminal liability. But\nin any event, this is a question for the Court. And\nin National Treasury Employees Union, this Court said\nthat we're writing more narrow relief requires the\nCourt to answer additional constitutional questions\nnot directly presented by the case, the appropriate\ncourse is to facially invalidate and let the\nlegislature decide how to write the exception. We\nbelieve that's the appropriate course here as well.\nIn addition, going back to the legislative\nabdication point, we believe that facially\ninvalidating -- rewriting the law here would\neliminate any incentive for legislatures to pass\nconstitutional laws in the first instance.\nThis was a clear requirement. This Court\nhas said for 30 years you cannot endanger women's\nhealth, you must have an exception for health\nthreatening emergencies. New Hampshire did not\ninclude such an exception. And if this Court\nrewrites it, it will in essence give a green\nlight to legislatures around the country to pass\nbroad restrictions and leave it women and their\ndoctors to go to the courts and be the full\ndefenders of the right --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If the model of this\ncase, is doctors come to court, doesn't have to have\nan actual patient class action and the court says the\nstatute cannot be applied to a medical necessity,\nperiod. No fancy frills of adding another things which\ncourts generally don't do. But then there would be no\nregulation of medical emergencies. Why isn't that what\n-- doesn't that fit the pattern of the case you've\nbrought and couldn't the First Circuit have done that\nand then you would have no complaint about the rest of\nthe statute?\nMS. DALVEN: The First Circuit could have\ndone that. We did have additional claims like\nconfidentiality.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, I know that.\nMS. DALVEN: But the First Circuit could\nhave done it. We believe the First Circuit was\ncorrect in not doing that for the two reasons I\ndiscussed and an additional reason as well.\nAs Justice Souter pointed out, we don't\nknow at all that the legislature would have passed\nthis law with a broader exception. Indeed, 153 New\nHampshire legislators have told this Court that there\nis significant doubt about whether they would. And I\nknow that might be surprising to some people, but I\nwould like to explain why, in the world of abortion\npolitics, it's not at all surprising.\nSome folks with good faith believe that any\nexception beyond one for a life-saving emergency\nrenders a ban -- a abortion restriction meaningless.\nAnd they refuse on principle to vote for any broader\nexception, any ban, any restriction that has a\nbroader exception.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Then they shouldn't have\nvoted for the severability provision which clearly\nsays if, in one of its applications, it's invalid,\nthe rest can be given effect without the invalid\nprovisions. I mean, the severability provision\nreally just flatly contradicts your assertion that\nthe New Hampshire legislature wouldn't want this to\nhappen.\nMS. DALVEN: Your Honor, a few things.\nFirst, we don't believe that the severability clause\ndirects the court to sever applications. Second,\nneither this Court nor New Hampshire courts treat\nseverability clauses as mandates. The question is\nstill whether, if there is significant doubt about\nwhether the legislature would have wanted it, they do\nnot sever, and as particularly whereas here, this\nCourt would have to make decisions for the legislature\nabout what that exception should look like.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this\nhistorical information? Since the decision of the\ndistrict court and the decision of the court of\nappeals, has the legislature considered enacting a\ndifferent statute that would solve the problems?\nMS. DALVEN: They have not, Your Honor.\nThere has been no bill put forward, to my knowledge.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to be that it\nwouldn't have been all that hard to do. I don't know.\nMS. DALVEN: That's right, Your Honor.\nThey could have enacted a law with a medical\nemergency exception and we could have all gone home.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, maybe they\nassumed that the medical health exception of the sort\nyou're arguing for is not constitutionally required\nand that's what would be litigated in a narrow\nfocused challenge on the adequacy or inadequacy of a\nbypass procedure. Maybe they assumed it would follow\nthe Salerno precedent, and they didn't have to worry\nabout severing in light of particular\nunconstitutional applications.\nMS. DALVEN: Perhaps that is true, Your\nHonor, but I still believe that that is this case,\nthat there really is no different -- I mean, in\nCasey, the plaintiffs brought a facial challenge\nbefore the law took effect to the adequate --\nchallenging the adequacy of a medical emergency\nexception.\nAnd this Court indicated that if the law\nprohibited an immediate abortion for women with the\nconditions Dr. Goldner described in his declaration\nhere, it would have been unconstitutional and some\nrelief would have been appropriate, even though that\nwas a facial challenge and even though the alleged\ninadequacies of the medical emergency would harm\nrelatively few women. So I don't think that there is\nany bar to this Court if they --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think the\nstatute, putting aside the medical emergency issue\nunder our precedence, is the parental notification\naspect of the statute constitutional?\nMS. DALVEN: No, Your Honor. We had\nadditional claims --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Other than the\nconfidentiality?\nMS. DALVEN: We believe we had three\nclaims, the health exception, the medical emergency\nexception for health threatening emergencies. The\ndeath exception we believe is also inadequate and the\nconfidentiality. In addition, the procedures that the\ncourt issued -- the New Hampshire Supreme Court\napproved raise an additional problem as well. So\nthere are claims in addition to the health threatening\nemergency.\nIf there are no further questions from the\nCourt. Thank You.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n"
