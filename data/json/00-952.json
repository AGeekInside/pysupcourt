        "content": "(10:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Number 00-952, the Wisconsin\nDepartment of Health and Human Services v. Irene Blumer.\nMs. Flanagan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN M. FLANAGAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. FLANAGAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn 1988, Congress enacted the spousal\nimpoverishment protections of the Federal Medicaid Act, 42\nU.S. Code section 1396r-5, to accomplish two competing\npurposes. First, Congress sought to protect spouses\nliving at home from impoverishment when the other spouse\nis institutionalized and requires long-term nursing home\ncare. Secondly, Congress sought to ensure that married\ncouples seeking medicaid bear a fair share of the cost of\nsuch care.\nThis case concerns whether States have the\ndiscretion to achieve those competing goals by taking into\naccount at the time medicaid eligibility is determined\navailable income which the nursing home spouse is\npermitted to use after eligibility to support the at-home\nspouse.\nWhen the nursing home spouse applies for\nmedicaid, section 1396r-5 permits the community spouse to\nretain certain income and resources to meet his own\nmonthly maintenance needs. The statute permits an\nincrease in the standard resource allowance, however, if\nthe at-home spouse can show at a fair hearing that the\nallowance will be inadequate to provide him with income at\nthe State-protected level once the nursing home spouse\nqualifies for medicaid.\nWhen making this determination, Wisconsin, like\nmore than 30 other States, first considers whether income\navailable to the at-home spouse from the nursing home\nspouse will be sufficient to ensure the protected level of\nincome once medicaid eligibility occurs. This method of\ndetermining whether to increase or to substitute the\nstandard resource allowance is called the income-first\nrule.\nQUESTION: And what do the other States do?\nMS. FLANAGAN: The remaining States use a\nmethodology called resource first, in which they look\nfirst to the additional resources above the standard\nresource allowance. These cases only arise where the\ncouple has resources above the standard allowance.\nIn this case --\nQUESTION: It would be very helpful to me if,\nright at this point, you pointed the statutory -- pointed\nout the statutory provision that authorizes the State to\ntransfer income at this stage.\nMS. FLANAGAN: The statutory provision, I think,\nspecifically is found in 42 U.S. Code 1396a(a)(17), which\ndeals with State standards for eligibility and the\nSecretary's authority to set standards for determining\navailability.\nQUESTION: Do you have a handy reference in the\nbrief somewhere to the, where we can see that?\nMS. FLANAGAN: It's in the Attorney -- the\nSolicitor General's appendix at -- the first thing in\ntheir appendix is the codified statute, 30 -- 1396r-5, the\none we are discussing primarily, and -- no, I'm sorry,\n1396a is in -- the first thing in the Solicitor General's\nappendix.\nQUESTION: Page 1a?\nMS. FLANAGAN: Yes, and (a)(17) --\nQUESTION: That's 8a.\nQUESTION: 8a?\nQUESTION: It looks like 7 --\nMS. FLANAGAN: Yes, Your Honor, it is. I'm\nsorry. It is correct.\nQUESTION: Then where in number (17) is the\nlanguage that you're answering Justice Stevens with?\nMS. FLANAGAN: Okay, a(a)(17) provides that the\nSecretary shall include reasonable standards, and then you\nskip the one parenthetical, for determining eligibility\nfor and the extent of medical assistance under the State\nplan, and then under (b), provide for taking into account\nonly such income and resources as are -- as determined in\naccordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary\navailable to the applicant or recipient, et cetera.\nQUESTION: Well, and let me ask you a question\non this point, if I may. There is a section, 5(b)(1), r-\n5(b)(1) of section 1396 that says that pre-eligibility,\nnone of the income of the community spouse shall be deemed\navailable to the institutionalized spouse, right?\nMS. FLANAGAN: That's right.\nQUESTION: And you're talking now about post\neligibility?\nMS. FLANAGAN: We're talking about a\ndetermination made at the point of eligibility, but which\nconcerns income available post eligibility.\nQUESTION: Well, it says pre-eligibility none of\nthe income of the community spouse shall be deemed\navailable to the institutionalized spouse.\nMS. FLANAGAN: That's right. That's right.\nQUESTION: And that provision wouldn't make\nsense if income of the community spouse itself included\nincome of the institutionalized spouse.\nMS. FLANAGAN: Well, I think, Your Honor, the --\nQUESTION: Would it? It wouldn't make any\nsense?\nMS. FLANAGAN: I think you have to take into\naccount that you're talking about income being calculated\nat different points in the temporal spectrum for different\npurposes.\nQUESTION: Well, you're -- you seem to be\narguing that the phrase, community spouse's income in\n(c) -- in (e)(2)(c) includes income from the\ninstitutionalized spouse --\nMS. FLANAGAN: I think --\nQUESTION: -- and yet it can't under that\nsection I read, I think. I don't understand how you get\nthere.\nMS. FLANAGAN: No, that particular section\n(b)(1) refers only to prohibiting income of the community\nspouse from being deemed available to the nursing home --\nQUESTION: Right, but Justice O'Connor's point\nis undoubtedly correct that income of the community spouse\nthere means income of the community spouse alone, not any\nattributed income from the institutionalized spouse,\nright? Isn't that right? It has to mean only the income\nof the community spouse.\nMS. FLANAGAN: I think you have to look at --\nQUESTION: In that section\nMS. FLANAGAN: -- what's available at that\npoint.\nQUESTION: I understand. Do you have any other\nsection in the act in which the phrase, income of the\ncommunity spouse, means not just the income of the\ncommunity spouse alone, but also income that has been\nattributed from the institutionalized spouse?\nMS. FLANAGAN: Under the definition of community\nspouse, income maintenance allowance, I believe -- which\nis under subsection (d)2(B) --\nQUESTION: (d)2 what?\nMS. FLANAGAN: (d)2(B), refers --\nQUESTION: Can you tell us where in the SG's\nappendix that is?\nQUESTION: It's on 59a of your cert petition.\nQUESTION: 18a?\nQUESTION: 59a.\nMS. FLANAGAN: At any rate, that particular\nsection refers to monthly income otherwise available to\nthe community spouse, and the -- our position is that this\nevidences a recognition of the fact, as medicaid has long\nrecognized, that spouses are required to support one\nanother, and that this is a background rule.\nQUESTION: Ms. Flanagan, it might help if -- I\nthink one of the main features of this legislation was\nthat income from the community spouse was never to be\nattributed to the institutionalized spouse, but vice\nversa, there is no such prohibition.\nMS. FLANAGAN: That's right, and that's --\nQUESTION: None of this makes sense unless you\nappreciate that that was an absolute prohibition. Now,\ntell us where that is in this statute, that says, income\nfrom the community spouse is not to be attributed to the\ninstitutionalized spouse.\nMS. FLANAGAN: It's in subsection (b)(1), 1396r-\n5(b)(1), and that was referred to --\nQUESTION: That was the section I read to you --\nMS. FLANAGAN: Right.\nQUESTION: -- in my question.\nMS. FLANAGAN: Yes.\nQUESTION: Could I have an answer to my\nquestion? The section you just referred me to is still\nnot another section other than the one at issue here in\nwhich the simple phrase, income of the community spouse,\nis used in a sense that means the community spouse's own\nincome plus any income attributed to the community spouse\nfrom the institutionalized spouse.\nYou say that that's the way it's used in the\nprovision at issue here. My question is, where else in\nthe entire statute is it used in that fashion?\nMS. FLANAGAN: I don't believe it's used\nanywhere else. That's why the difficulty in this case\narose, is to try to figure out what that means.\nQUESTION: Well, no, I think that rather solves\nthe difficulty, frankly.\nMS. FLANAGAN: I --\nQUESTION: I would normally think that income of\nthe community spouse means income of the community spouse,\nand you say it means no, the community spouse's income\nplus attributed income. I don't know anywhere else in the\nstatute that it's used in that fashion, just in this one\nsection where you say we should interpret it that way.\nThere are other sections where it clearly means only the\ncommunity spouse's income.\nMS. FLANAGAN: With respect, Your Honor, the\nmedicaid statute has long considered available income as\npart of the income of the person to which it's referring,\nand we --\nQUESTION: I mean, where it does that, that's\nall I'm asking for. If it's long done that, just give me\nanother section where income of the community spouse means\nwhat you say it means here. The phrase is used a lot, I'm\nsure.\nMS. FLANAGAN: That particular phrase is not\nused frequently in this statute. That's part of the\nproblem. It's only used --\nQUESTION: And isn't it true that the situation\nyou're talking about we're deeming in the other direction,\nwhere they deem the community spouse income to be\nattributable to the institutionalized spouse, not vice\nversa?\nMS. FLANAGAN: Well, Your Honor, Justice\nStevens, the background rule which I referred to which\nthis Court clearly articulated in Gray Panthers case is\nthat spouses are expected to support one another. That's\na two-way street.\nQUESTION: That was for purposes of determining\nhow much of the community spouse's income should be deemed\nto belong to the institutionalized spouse.\nMS. FLANAGAN: That's right. I'm just saying\nthat spousal support obligations are a two-way street, and\nthe Court clearly recognized that.\nQUESTION: In this case, we have the unusual\ncircumstance where Congress sought to provide additional\nprotection to the community spouse to reverse the prior\ndeeming rule which permitted States to take income from\nthe community spouse and require it to be used for the\ncost of care.\nIn this case, in the spousal impoverishment\nprovisions and this provision specifically, Congress is\ntrying to protect the community spouse by making available\nto the at-home spouse income that is specifically\ncontemplated to be made available as soon as eligibility\noccurs.\nQUESTION: But it is clear, is it not, that the\nresource-first rule gives greater protection to the\ncommunity spouse than the income-first rule?\nMS. FLANAGAN: The result is that it permits\nthe -- in general it frequently permits the at-home spouse\nto retain a greater share of the couple's joint resources\nthan would be the case under the State-defined standard\nresource allowance, and in that sense, yes, that's\ndefinitely correct.\nQUESTION: Ms. Flanagan, am I right in thinking\nthat the, neither the act we're talking about nor the SSI\nactually define community spouse's income?\nMS. FLANAGAN: No, it doesn't. That's the exact\nproblem in this case. There is no definition, and our\nposition is that community spouse's income means income\npossessed by the community spouse, income that the spouse\nhas a right to, and income that is available to the spouse\nat the particular point when it's being considered.\nQUESTION: Was the income-first rule in\nWisconsin adopted by the legislature, or by a State\nagency?\nMS. FLANAGAN: It was initially adopted as a\nmatter of policy by the State agency immediately after\npassage of the statute. Then in 1993 the legislature\namended the statute to have an express income-first\nrequirement.\nQUESTION: So then your State court, I take it,\nunder prevailing Wisconsin rules, could not ignore the\nlegislature's determination unless it found that the\nFederal statute was unambiguous.\nMS. FLANAGAN: That -- well, that is what they\ndid, yes, Your Honor. They interpreted the Federal\nstatute as being unambiguous. They concluded that the\nState law conflicted with the plain terms of the Federal\nstatute and therefore could not be enforced.\nQUESTION: Ms. Flanagan, as I understand it,\nthere's a provision -- and these have been referred to\nthis morning, but there's a provision that forbids\nattribution from the community spouse to the\ninstitutionalized spouse, period, no qualifications on\nthat.\nMS. FLANAGAN: During institutionalization.\nQUESTION: That's right, yes.\nThere's also a provision which recognizes the\npossibility of transferring income from the\ninstitutionalized spouse to the community spouse after\neligibility has been determined, but does not require any\nsuch transfer. It simply in effect says how you do it, is\nthat basically correct?\nMS. FLANAGAN: It doesn't explicitly require the\ntransfer. There are, however, powerful incentives in the\nstatute to basically require them to do it.\nQUESTION: But it doesn't, that latter provision\ndoesn't make any reference to the period before\neligibility, and I guess my question is, why don't we\ninfer some kind of a negative inference -- when the\nprovision refers totally to the post eligibility period,\nwhy don't we find some negative implication that it was\nnot expected in the pre-eligibility period?\nMS. FLANAGAN: Well, the fact is that the\ncalculation that the hearing officers ask to be made here\nconcerns the post eligibility period. The question is, is\nthe at-home spouse going to have sufficient income in the\npost eligibility period, or does the resource allowance\nneed to be jacked up in order to provide that additional\nincome, so in that context, the hearing officer is looking\nat the same period of time when the standard resource\nallowance goes into effect, the same period of time when\nthe transfer provisions go into effect --\nQUESTION: So basically the answer is, the fair\nhearing has got to take place before eligibility is\ndetermined, and that's in effect the answer to my\nquestion.\nMS. FLANAGAN: That's right. If the calculation\nis looking ahead, if there are no --\nQUESTION: Ms. -- I have one further question.\nMS. FLANAGAN: Okay.\nQUESTION: And if you can't give me an answer\nright away, maybe you can when you come back. It's sort\nof the flip side of the question I asked earlier. Do --\ncan you give us at least some other portions of the\nstatute where income of the institutionalized spouse is\nclearly used to mean the institutionalized spouse's own\nincome plus -- plus income attributed to the\ninstitutionalized spouse from the community spouse?\nMS. FLANAGAN: Well, that really doesn't arise\nbecause of subsection (b)(1), which expressly precludes\nthat.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nMS. FLANAGAN: Thank you, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Flanagan. We'll hear\nfrom you, Mr. Lamken.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nQUESTION: Mr. Lamken, you've heard the\nquestions, and it is difficult, looking at the text of the\nstatute, to figure out what supports the petitioner's\nview, although, as I understand it, that is also the view\nof the Federal Government here. That income-first rule is\nokay.\nMR. LAMKEN: Yes, Your Honor. It's our --\nQUESTION: Now, are there proposed regulations\nof HHS that would allow either resource-first or income-\nfirst rules?\nMR. LAMKEN: Yes, Your Honor. There's currently\na pending rulemaking before HHS, and the Secretary in the\nnotice of proposed rulemaking has determined that States\nshould be permitted to decide whether to use the income-\nfirst methodology or the resource-first --\nQUESTION: How far along is that process? When\nis that going to be adopted?\nMR. LAMKEN: The comment period closed on\nNovember 6. There's been a little bit of a delay because\nthere's concern that many comments might have been\nquarantined in the Brentwood facility. However, we are\nhoping the Secretary can proceed and complete that process\nwith all due speed.\nQUESTION: Can I ask what authority the\nSecretary has to say that the statute is ambiguous, so it\ncan mean either one? We don't even let Federal agencies\ndo that under Chevron. I mean, we didn't say in Chevron\nthat a Federal agency can either say that a bubble means\nthis, or say that a bubble means the other, willy nilly.\nWe said, since it can mean one or the other, we'll go\nalong with whichever one the Federal agency says it means,\nbut here we have a Federal agency that says, we have\nambiguous language, so hey, do whatever you like. I mean,\nit may be ambiguous, but surely it was intended to mean\none thing or the other. How can the Secretary come off\njust telling the States, it's ambiguous, you know, do it\neither way, we don't care?\nMR. LAMKEN: Justice Scalia, I think the answer\ncomes in two parts. The first is, one doesn't have to\nthink that the statute means two different things at once\nin order to accept the Secretary's view. Community\nspouse's income can have a meaning, but there may be\ndifferent methodologies, all of which are reasonable, for\ndetermining and calculating what is the community spouse's\nincome.\nIn addition, this Court has -- and the States\nhave liberties in order to decide to choose among those\nreasonable methodologies, because under section 17 on page\n8a of our, of the appendix to our brief they are to\nestablish reasonable methodologies consistent with the\nSecretary's regulations.\nIn addition --\nQUESTION: You could say that about every\nambiguity, I mean, that there are two different\nmethodologies. You could have said the same thing with\nChevron. Now, could the Secretary in Chevron have --\nthere are two different methodologies of deciding\nwhat's -- what is it, point of emission, or -- point\nsource, yes, point source of emission.\nMR. LAMKEN: In fact, Justice Scalia, this Court\nhas upheld precisely that type of regulation issued by the\nSecretary. In a case called Batterton v. Francis, and\nagain in a case called Lukar v. Reed, in which you wrote\nthe opinion for the Court, when the statute did not\nclearly preclude one methodology or another, the\nSecretary, because the Secretary has quasi-legislative\nauthority to set standards in this area, may adopt\nstandards that permit variations from State to State.\nIn Batterton v. Francis, it was under AFDC, and\nthe question is, what was unemployment? Did it include\nstriking workers, or did it not, and the Secretary said,\nStates, you may determine that based on your own State\nlaw. In Lukar v. Reed, the question was whether or not a\ntort judgment would be considered income or resources.\nThe Secretary threw guidance to all the States that they\nhad the option of choosing it as income or resources\nbecause both are reasonable.\nThis Court in Lukar v. Reed again held that\ndecision, so in this particular area, where States have\nthe principal responsibility of establishing standards,\nthe Secretary may establish the boundaries, the reasonable\nboundaries within which those standards may be\nestablished, but unless the, and so long as the standards\nestablished by the State are not contradicted by the\nstatute, are not contradicted by the Secretary's\nregulations, and are reasonable --\nQUESTION: But Mr. Lamken, isn't this a little\ndifferent, because in this statute, if I understand it\ncorrectly, there is express statutory authorization for\nthe resource-first method, whereas the income-first method\nis drawn by inference from what you consider ambiguities?\nMR. LAMKEN: No, Your Honor. I believe that\nneither methodology is particularly compelled or expressly\nauthorized by the statute. The statute simply does not\nspeak to the issue of whether when a spouse, a community\nspouse is going to have a shortfall in income you make\nthat up first by paying additional money to the person in\nthe nursing home so that she may support the spouse at\nhome, which is the income-first methodology, or whether\nfirst you raise the resource allowance so that she may --\nso that the person at home has additional income from\nresources.\nI think I should probably go back and answer\nJustice O'Connor's and Justice Scalia's question about the\nmeaning of community spouse's income in section (b)(1),\nbecause there has been a suggestion about necessarily\nincludes only the income paid directly to the community\nspouse. It is in our view a subtle legal tradition that\nthe community spouse's income, or one spouse's income may\ninclude income from another spouse that is deemed to be\nincome of the community spouse in contemplation of law,\nand so in (b)(1) community spouse's income could include\nincome from the institutionalized spouse that the\ninstitutionalized spouse can make available. That's\nconsistent with the presumption of spousal support, and\nit's consistent with, for example, existing regulations\nsuch as those in --\nQUESTION: Would you go over that a little more\nslowly for me?\nMR. LAMKEN: I'm -- I apologize.\nQUESTION: How do you read (b)(1) --\nMR. LAMKEN: (b)(1) says --\nQUESTION: -- to cover reverse deeming as well\nas deeming?\nMR. LAMKEN: Right. All it says is that income\nof the community spouse shall be -- shall not be deemed\navailable to the institutionalized spouse.\nQUESTION: Correct.\nMR. LAMKEN: The inference to be drawn from that\nis that there is no prohibition in deeming income of the\ninstitutionalized spouse --\nQUESTION: But even if there's no prohibition,\nwhere is your authorization for doing this? That's what I\ndon't find in the statute.\nMR. LAMKEN: Your Honor, it was -- it's a --\nQUESTION: If you start from a background rule\nwith the name on the check as a background rule for the\nwhole SSI program, how can you change that rule without\nauthorization?\nMR. LAMKEN: That's the mistake, Justice --\nQUESTION: Pardon me?\nMR. LAMKEN: That's the mistake, Justice\nStevens. You don't start with the presumption of the\nname-on-the-check rule. You start from the presumption\nthat the income of one spouse may be deemed the income of\nanother spouse because the general rule is that spouses\nmay be expected to support --\nQUESTION: Where in the statute does it say\nthat?\nMR. LAMKEN: The statute doesn't but Congress\nsaid it when it enacted the Medicaid Act in the first\ninstance, and that was the established rule under the\nSecretary's policies at the time that this statute was\nenacted. If you look at the Secretary's regulations that\nexisted when Congress enacted this, it said the income --\nQUESTION: That was deeming, not reverse\ndeeming.\nMR. LAMKEN: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: That was deeming, not reverse\ndeeming.\nMR. LAMKEN: No, Your Honor. In fact, deeming\ndid occur -- reverse deeming did occur, or could occur\nunder the prior policies, particularly in section 209(b)\nStates. Now, in most situations -- well, first for post\neligibility determinations, States did set aside a certain\namount of money of the institutionalized spouse's income\nfor the support of the community spouse, and they treated\nthat money as unavailable to the spouse in the nursing\nhome so that it could be available to the spouse at home.\nThat is this situation which you have called reverse\ndeeming.\nSecond, even at the eligibility stage,\nparticularly in section 209(b) States, it would be\npermissible to deem the income of the institutionalized\nspouse to be income of the community spouse.\nNow, it might not often come up, but it would\ncome up when, for example, both were applicants, in which\ncase that would be permissible, so the settled background\nprinciple that existed at the time Congress acted is that\nspouses support each other mutually, and Congress\neliminated one of those presumptions on a going forward\nbasis in (b)(1) and said, no, the community spouse's\nincome shall not be deemed available to institutionalized\nspouses, but left in place the background principle that\nan institutionalized spouse, if they have the funds, can\nsupport the spouse --\nQUESTION: You can leave that background\nprinciple in place, and we can all concede that it's in\nplace, without thereby coming to the belief that when you\nsay income of the community spouse, you mean, income of\nthe community spouse plus whatever is deemed attributable\nto the community spouse.\nI mean, I don't contest the principle, but\ndon't -- that's just not a reasonable way to use language.\nI agree it can be deemed, but you should say -- it would\nhave been very easy to say, income of the community spouse\nincluding any attributed income.\nMR. LAMKEN: Your Honor, it would be the\nSecretary's -- or the regulations that existed at this\ntime, when they discussed what we count as your income, as\nyour applicant for SSI, for example, it said, we count as\nyour income your income plus income from other people, so\nthat it treated it as the individual's income, and that is\nconsistent with the background principle that each\nspouse's income is income to the other spouse, and when\nStates may establish reasonable standards --\nQUESTION: I'm sorry, what did it mean, income\nfrom other people?\nMR. LAMKEN: The --\nQUESTION: Money given you by your children on a\nregular basis, and things of that sort?\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, actually attributed income,\nJustice Scalia, actual income that's passed over you don't\nneed a deeming rule, because that's actually --\nQUESTION: Right. Right. Right, you don't mean\nthat.\nMR. LAMKEN: But for responsible individuals\nthere were categories, such as spouses, such as parents,\nsuch as -- there is another category I can't remember the\nname of, but where somebody had the responsibility for\nsupporting you, their income was deemed to be your income\nfor determining your eligibility.\nQUESTION: But I take it the only thing that\nyou've got express in the record anywhere to indicate that\nreally is what Congress had in mind is the statement in\nthe legislative history that is quoted in the briefs that\nrefers to other income attributed, is that right? That's\nthe only thing in black and white.\nMR. LAMKEN: That is the only thing in black and\nwhite, other than the fact that the settled background\nprinciples the Secretary operated under before the\nenactment would treat the income of one spouse as\navailable to the other. It was not merely deeming from\nthe to community spouse to the institutionalized spouse,\nbut deeming in the other direction occurred.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Lamken.\nMr. Hagopian, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MITCHELL HAGOPIAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nQUESTION: Counsel, would you mind telling us\nwhy it matters which rule is followed by a State, resource\nfirst or income first, not just in an individual case, but\noverall? Who saves what in terms of money if you do one\nthing or the other?\nMR. HAGOPIAN: Yes, Justice O'Connor. Under the\nresource-first rule the applicant, the community spouse of\nthe applicant, of the institutionalized spouse, is the\nperson who gets the money, and they get the money in the\nform of an expanded community spouse resource allowance\nthat then generates income that brings the monthly -- the\ncommunity spouse's actual income up to or as close to the\nmonthly need amount that's set by the State.\nUnder income first, the income is fictionally\nimputed from the institutionalized spouse to the community\nspouse, but it doesn't actually go to the community\nspouse. That would not ever happen until after\neligibility had actually been determined.\nSo in the aggregate, the resource-first rule\nallows community spouses who would not adequately be\nprotected by the formula community spouse resource\nallowance, because that does not generate income up to the\nmonthly need amount and because they have no other income,\nor not enough income to bring them up to that level, it\nallows them to actually have resources that will generate\nthat income and protect them even after the\ninstitutionalized spouse passes away.\nQUESTION: Doesn't it also make possible the\npayments, the actual payments start earlier? I mean, the\nreason this was of such concern is that the\ninstitutionalized spouse would not be eligible monthly for\nchecks, so that the immediate effect was she could pay\ndown more rapidly what was her excess resources before she\nqualified. Isn't that the primary effect? It's that the\npayments under medicaid start earlier?\nMR. HAGOPIAN: Yes. If I understand your\nquestion correctly, Justice Ginsburg, the income-first\nrule requires that those assets be spent down. Is that\nthe answer to your question?\nQUESTION: Yes, so that -- Justice O'Connor\nasked you what the effect of --\nMR. HAGOPIAN: Yes.\nQUESTION: And I think the immediate effect of,\nshe starts to collect medicaid sooner and doesn't use the\nspousal resources.\nMR. HAGOPIAN: Oh, now I understand your\nquestion. No, that's not true. Under income first, the\ninstitutionalized spouse does not become eligible. Only\nunder resource first does the institutionalized spouse\nbecome eligible, and then that allows the payments post\neligibility to actually occur to the community spouse.\nQUESTION: Maybe I am not making myself clear.\nI thought the principle of that is to the couple, of using\nyour resource rather than the income first -- resource\nfirst, is that the institutionalized spouse, it pays down\nquicker, and is therefore eligible for medicaid money\nsooner. That's what your position achieves, is that not\nso?\nMR. HAGOPIAN: Yes, that's correct.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nQUESTION: But doesn't that assume your case and\nnot the more typical case, the more typical case, given\nstatistical projections, is that the husband will be the\ninstitutionalized person, and so in the typical case it\nwill not work to the advantage of the couple?\nMR. HAGOPIAN: Well, I would agree with you,\nJustice Kennedy, that the typical case is statistically\nthat is the husband that goes into the nursing home first,\nand we don't have that case here today, but I believe I\ndisagree with you as to the effect that this has. First\nof all the sex of the spouses doesn't necessarily matter,\nas is indicated by this case. It's possible for a male\nspouse to be the community spouse and have exactly what\nhappened here happen.\nQUESTION: Mr. -- I'm sorry. Are you finished\nwith that? I didn't want to cut off your answer.\nMR. HAGOPIAN: I don't think I answered your\nquestion, Justice Kennedy.\nBut the institutionalized spouse, if it is\nthe -- are you asking me whether, if the institutionalized\nspouse has a higher income, that what happened here won't\nhappen? Is that the question, or --\nQUESTION: Yes. I assume in many cases the\nhusband is the first to be hospitalized, and he is the one\nwith the greater income.\nMR. HAGOPIAN: That's correct, so in many cases\nthe income first rule will have a worse effect when the\nhusband is the one that goes in first. Because his income\nwill be higher, there will be more income that will be\nattributed to the community spouse in this pre-eligibility\ndetermination, and that will prevent her from having\nincome of her own that would raise her to the minimum\nmonthly needs allowance. If resource-first was used in\nthat case, she would be able to retain assets that would\ngenerate actual income to her that would meet the monthly\nneed allowance.\nQUESTION: Mr. Hagopian --\nQUESTION: Well, if States cannot follow this\nincome-first rule, maybe they would just respond by\nreducing the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance\nand adjust it that way.\nMR. HAGOPIAN: Yes.\nQUESTION: Or adjust downward the resources\nprotectable for the community spouse.\nMR. HAGOPIAN: Yes. Yes, Justice O'Connor, that\ncould happen. That is where the flexibility in the\nspousal impoverishment provisions exists for the States.\nQUESTION: How many States are using income\nfirst?\nMR. HAGOPIAN: We don't exactly know.\nAccording, I believe, to the petition, the State estimated\nthat it's in the neighborhood of 30 to 35 States.\nQUESTION: Of course, I suppose a really hard-\nnosed State could do both, right, could use the income-\nfirst rule plus adjust downward the other -- I mean, the\ntwo don't go with each other.\nMR. HAGOPIAN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: You either adjust downward or use the\nincome first.\nI have this question. You maintain that the\nstatute is not ambiguous, if they --\nMR. HAGOPIAN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- do it this way. What is your\nburden if it is ambiguous? If it is ambiguous, do you\nlose, do you acknowledge that you lose?\nMR. HAGOPIAN: Oh, absolutely not, Justice\nScalia.\nQUESTION: Do you think the ambiguity has to be\nresolved, or can the Secretary just leave the ambiguity\nfloating out there?\nMR. HAGOPIAN: Well, that's essentially what\nthey've decided to do in the proposed rule --\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. HAGOPIAN: -- is to leave it floating. I\ndon't think that's the proper method to do it.\nQUESTION: By proper, you mean lawful?\nMR. HAGOPIAN: Lawful, that's correct.\nQUESTION: They are not permitted to do that?\nMR. HAGOPIAN: That's right. I agree, actually,\nwith the way you framed it in your questions to the\npetitioner, and that is that it just is illogical to\nassume that Congress, when they enacted this particular\nprotection, which we believe is a fail-safe protection for\nthose few couples who would not adequately be protected by\nthe formula resource allowance, that to have these two\nwildly divergent interpretations spring from the exact\nsame language seems totally unreasonable.\nQUESTION: Well, what did it do with a case like\nBatterton v. Francis, then?\nMR. HAGOPIAN: Well, Your Honor, I believe that\nin a case like Batterton v. Francis, we have a different\nset of rules here. First of all, I believe that was an\nAFDC case.\nQUESTION: Well, but you know, it's still the\ngeneral same ball park.\nMR. HAGOPIAN: Well, we believe that the\nenactment in the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of the\nno-more-restrictive rule under SSI resolved that whole\nissue for us, and that is that with 1396a(r), which is\nfound at the appendix to our brief -- it's the only page\nin the appendix -- that the question is actually resolved\nby the application of the SSI methodologies.\nQUESTION: Well, you say the question is\nresolved. Do you mean by that that the Secretary does not\nhave any discretion to decide that a State is free to\nfollow either (a) or (b)?\nMR. HAGOPIAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And how does that follow?\nMR. HAGOPIAN: Well, there's a couple of --\nfirst of all, the authority that the Secretary has relied\non to issue its proposed rule and apparently from which\nits authority to develop the rule at all is\n1396a(a)(17)(B).\nNow, it is our position initially that that --\nthat 1396a(a)(17) was actually superseded by operation of\n1396r-5(a)(1).\nQUESTION: This is very difficult to take in\naurally.\nMR. HAGOPIAN: I believe that.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: But go ahead anyway.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HAGOPIAN: It's almost as difficult to say\nit.\nBut the spousal impoverishment provisions, one\nof the main things that they did was supersede the\nauthority that the State and the United States have relied\nupon to issue the rule and to engage in this so-called\nreverse deeming, so -- and at the same time that they\nsuperseded that rule, they also enacted 1396a(r).\nNow, this rule -- what this rule did, and this\nrule was actually -- I want to back up. Another provision\nof the spousal impoverishment enactment was 1396r-5(1)(C),\nand this provision retained the SSI methodologies, or any\nexisting methodologies that were not specifically\noverridden by the spousal impoverishment enactments.\nNow, the one thing that was left untouched by\nthese spousal impoverishment provisions was the way that\nincome was determined for eligibility purposes. Now, that\nbrings us to 1396a(r), and that provision is the provision\nof the Medicaid Act mandates that the SSI methodologies\napply to income and resource determinations for all the\neligibility groups that were relevant in these cases, and\nthat statute does allow States and HCFA, or CMS or the\nSecretary to issue rules that deviate from those SSI\nmethodologies, but those rules, if they're going to do a\nrule that deviates from that methodology, the rule has to\nhave the effect of making more people eligible for\nmedicaid, not fewer people, and this rule, the income-\nfirst rule, fails that test.\nWhat it does is -- because under the SSI\nprogram, if the SSI methodologies were strictly applied,\nthe income of the two spouses is separated and is never\ncommingled, and so because under SSI this would not\nhappen, a rule which allows it to happen in medicaid is\nconsidered to be no more restrictive and not -- I'm sorry,\nmore restrictive than the SSI methodologies, and is not\npermitted by that statute.\nQUESTION: May I ask you a question? I know a\ncase is easier if you don't look at the legislative\nhistory, and so it's probably easier for my colleague than\nfor me.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: But would you explain to me how you\ninterpret the parenthetical phrase that's quoted on page\n18 of the Government's brief, and the -- it says taking\ninto account any other income attributable to the\ncommunity spouse. I find that kind of a puzzling\nparenthetical. How do you read that?\nMR. HAGOPIAN: Well, I've two responses to that,\nJustice Stevens. First, within the spousal impoverishment\nenactment, the term, attribute, or attributable is used in\ntwo different fashions. When it's used in -- to describe\nresources, it has the effect of commingling the resources\nand pooling them. When it's used in conjunction with the\nterm, income, it has the effect of separating the income\nbetween the two spouses.\nSo it's my initial position that income\nattributable to the other -- other income attributable to\nthe community spouse merely confirms the way it was done\nSSI statutes, and that is consistent with the way it is\ndone, where income is talked about at all, in the spousal\nimpoverishment provisions, and I think there is actually a\nreason for that to be in there, and that is that it would\nbe possible in some cases for a community spouse to\nattempt to get an expanded resource allowance by coming\ninto the hearing and saying, I have income, and it's in my\nname right now.\nTypical would be, maybe it's from employment,\nand at this date when I'm trying to establish eligibility,\nor my institutionalized spouse is trying to establish\neligibility, I have that income, but I don't believe you\nshould count that income to me because it's going to end\nnext month when my job ends.\nSo I think that is what they were talking about,\ntrying to foreclose that type of argument at a hearing,\nand so I believe that the real effect of that\nparenthetical phrase is to confirm the separate treatment\nof the income. The reason it isn't in the statute and\nit's in the legislative history is because the SSI mandate\nunder 1396(a)(R) accomplished that purpose precisely.\nEvery other part of that legislative history essentially\nbecomes 1396r-5(e)(2)(C). That phrase is missing.\nQUESTION: In that particular provision, to\nretain an adequate amount of resources, all that any other\nincome attributable to the community spouse need mean is\nincome attributable to him from sources other than\ninterest on his resources. I mean, that phrase could\ninclude his actual wages, couldn't it?\nMR. HAGOPIAN: The institutionalized spouse's\nwages, or the --\nQUESTION: The community spouse's wages.\nMR. HAGOPIAN: Oh, yes, absolutely. It would --\nI think it does.\nQUESTION: I mean --\nMR. HAGOPIAN: Yes, I believe that it does --\nQUESTION: -- resource allowance is the\nresources that provide income, which means, you know,\nstocks or whatever, and all that phrase there may mean is\nsomething, any other income attributable to him from\nsomething other than his stocks.\nMR. HAGOPIAN: Right.\nQUESTION: Such as his wages, right?\nMR. HAGOPIAN: Exactly.\nQUESTION: You -- your argument in the event\nthat we find ambiguity I guess boils down simply to the\nfact that for a variety of reasons it would frustrate the\ncongressional policy behind the act itself if we held\nagainst you, and yet in a way, haven't you provided an\nanswer to that, a counter to that argument in your answer\nto the question a few moments ago?\nYou said, and I think have to say, that if the\nStates lose on the particular issue before us here, the\nStates as a practical matter can get to the same kind of\nrough dollar and sense results simply by adjusting the\namount of resources, that is the baseline amount for the\ncommunity spouse to retain and the amount of income which\nis thought to be necessary for the community spouse to\nlive decently, so it almost seems as though it doesn't\nvery much matter, necessarily, to the enactment of\nwhatever policy Congress had, whether the flexibility\ncomes in income versus resource first, or whether it comes\nin setting the allowances for income and assets. What's\nyour answer to that?\nMR. HAGOPIAN: Well, I think that the answer to\nthat is that the resource-first allowance, resource-first\nrule was placed in a provision that is what we call the\nfail safe provision. This was a provision that was\nsupposed to be applicable to all the States and allow\nthose few couples -- and I want to stress that this is not\ngoing to affect a lot of people.\nA few couples would not be adequately protected\nby those formula allowances, and so -- because the policy\nof the statute was to defeat spousal impoverishment. That\nwas certainly one of the primary purposes behind it, and\nthe vast majority of cases the formula resource allowance\nwas going to adequately serve that interest, but in --\nQUESTION: So you're saying this is kind of an\nexceptional case kind of mechanism, regardless of how you\nset income and resources.\nMR. HAGOPIAN: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: And as an exceptional case mechanism,\nit's only going to work if it works the way you say, on a\nresource-first basis?\nMR. HAGOPIAN: That's right, and to stress the\nexceptional case component of it, you have to remember how\nyou get one of these hearings. This is not an easy\nmatter. This is not something that s accomplished by the\nlocal agency for every single applicant who walks through\nthe door. You have to have - know that you re in excess -\nhave resources in excess of this formula resource\nallowance. You have to go to your local welfare office.\nYou have to apply for benefits knowing that your\napplication is going to be denied. You get denied, and\nthen you have to request a hearing, go to the hearing,\nprove up the need with all sorts of mathematical\ncalculations for this.\nThis is not something that people -- the faint\nof heart are going to be doing on purpose, so it is an\nexceptional procedure.\nQUESTION: Have you read the notice of the\nproposed rulemaking?\nMR. HAGOPIAN: Yes, I have, Justice Ginsburg.\nQUESTION: And I suppose your argument is to the\neffect that that's just not a permissible interpretation\nof the statute?\nMR. HAGOPIAN: Yes, that's certainly one of our\narguments against it. We also believe, though, that the\nstatutory authority that the Secretary is using for\npromulgating it, which is 1396a(a)(17)(B) has been\nsuperseded in spousal impoverishment, so the rule itself\nis probably promulgated pursuant to invalid authority.\nQUESTION: Do we owe any deference to the agency\nhere in its interpretation?\nMR. HAGOPIAN: Well, because our position is\nthat the position they are taking is totally unreasonable,\nno, you don't owe any deference to the agency.\nQUESTION: Does the income-first rule mean that\nat the end of the day less Federal money is spent on\nmedicaid care?\nMR. HAGOPIAN: Not necessarily. In the\nimmediate -- the effect of denying an application based on\nincome first would at that moment prevent someone from\nbeing eligible for medicaid, but -- and so therefore would\nsave Federal dollars, no question about that, but you have\nto remember that the resources that the couple is required\nto spend in order to become eligible, there's no\nrequirement that those resources be spent on the nursing\nhome, and so it's possible that those resources could be\nspent for some other purpose, and then the person could\nimmediately become eligible for medicaid, you know, within\na short time after the initial application was denied.\nAnd the important thing about that point is\nthat, if that happens, if those resources are gone, and\nthe income that's generated from them is gone, then when\nyou get to the post eligibility determination, the less of\nthe institutionalized spouse's income is going to be able\nto be used to defray the cost to the medicaid program,\nbecause more of it is going to have to be used to increase\nthe allowance to the institu -- or, the community spouse,\nso in the short run it may be -- save the Federal\nGovernment. In the long run, it does not.\nQUESTION: Would you comment on one of the\nquestions I asked Mr. Lamken, whether the background rule\nis the name-on-the-check rule, or as he puts it, the\nbetter view is the background rule is one of deeming, and\nso that we should start from the premise that it's okay to\ntreat one spouse's income as part of the other spouse.\nMR. HAGOPIAN: Well, I beg to differ with Mr.\nLamken's presentation of the background rule. I don't\nbelieve that there is any precedent for the reverse\ndeeming that he's talking about in any of the background\nrules. The deeming that was permitted was strictly from\nthe nonapplicant spouse to the applicant spouse, and it\nwas for the purpose of denying that person eligibility.\nThe one rule he talked about where there was\nsome reverse deeming was, was also -- was a post\neligibility rule. Under the old rules pre-MCCA, the\nnursing home spouse could allocate a small amount of money\nto the community spouse, usually just enough to bring that\ncommunity spouse above the local welfare threshold so that\nthey wouldn't have to support that person on welfare, but\nthat was a post eligibility deeming, it was not an\neligibility, and in the SSI program, which is what -- we\nbelieve where the methodologies occur that dictate how\nincome is to be determined, there is no deeming from the\napplicant spouse back to the nonapplicant spouse.\nQUESTION: Well, even under this program, as I\nunderstand it, in the post eligibility determination\nincome can be transferred from the institutionalized\nspouse to the community spouse.\nMR. HAGOPIAN: Yes.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nQUESTION: I might ask one question. Examples\nhelp a lot for me in these cases. I couldn't understand\nthem without them, and the amicus briefs were filled with\nthem, which was helpful, but the example I'm carrying\naround in my head is that we have, say, a woman in an\ninstitution who has about $200,000 or $300,000 in assets,\nand maybe a small pension of $8,000 or $10,000, and her\nhusband's at home, and he has a pension coming in, maybe\nof $10,000 to $12,000, and so he's lacking about $6,000 or\n$7,000 or $8,000 or $9,000 or $10,000 to bring himself up\nto the $24,000 level.\nNow, if you're right, what we'll do is, we'll\ntake the $300,000 the wife has, and we give it to the\nhusband. It generates about, I don't know, $10,000,\n$12,000, and eventually that $300,000 goes to the\nchildren, and if you're right, she doesn't have to spend\nit down, and if you're wrong, by the way, if that money\ngoes to the husband, later on, when her pension comes in,\nand there's about 8 or $10,000 coming in, that money goes\nright to the institution to pay for the health care. She\ndoesn't get to keep it. So that's one way.\nNow, the other way is that she keeps -- she\nspends down the $300,000. She has to spend down the\n$300,000, maybe that money goes to the institution, maybe\nit goes to fix the roof, but then when the income comes\nin, it goes right to the husband.\nSo I don't know, you know, I mean, it's sort of\nwhat -- the Government seems to think that it's better off\nfinancially by making her spend the money down, but I\nguess that depends on whether the alternative is to pay\nthe $300,000 to the doctors or pay it to get the roof\nfixed, so when I end up thinking that, I haven't a clue.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: And so therefore I'd say, well, if I\nwere writing this statute, I guess I'd leave it up to the\nSecretary, and if the Secretary wants to leave it up to\nthe States, that's his business, so I look at the\nlanguage, and the language there seems not to solve the\nproblem, and -- okay, what's the response?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HAGOPIAN: That was a question?\nQUESTION: I was putting the thing because --\nMR. HAGOPIAN: Yes, I --\nQUESTION: -- I want you to see that at the\nmoment I think, well, I can't figure it out, but I'm\nworking with those examples, and since I can't, I say,\nleave it up to the Secretary, leave it up to a State,\nleave it up to somebody else, as long as the statute\nallows that.\nI wanted to expose that to you, because I want\nyou to have a chance to say no, you're wrong, your example\nis wrong, your reasoning's wrong, everything's wrong, so\ngo ahead.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HAGOPIAN: I concur with everything you just\nsaid, Justice Breyer.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HAGOPIAN: I think your first example was\nthe wrong one, the one that oddly enough is bad for me,\nand that's because I think you're assuming that the\nresources that are going to be protected for the care of\nthe spouse will be transferred on death to the children.\nThat's possible, but if the community spouse outlives the\nnursing home spouse, that resource pool, because for\nwhatever reason there isn't an independent stream of\nincome available to that community spouse, it's going to\nbe that resource fund that creates the income stream for\nthat community spouse.\nIf it's protected, and not have to be spent down\nto medicaid eligibility, that community spouse is much\nmore likely to retain it, not spend it on things that he\ndoesn't need in order to preserve that income stream so\nthat he can take care of himself, hopefully, not in a\nnursing home but perhaps in some sort of noninstitutional\nsetting that he would prefer over that.\nSo that's my response to your question.\nQUESTION: You make a big point of that. What\nhappens if you lose and the institutionalized spouse dies,\nand that is a problem. I don't know why the Government\ndoesn't, as a matter of policy, make a pretty strong case,\nbut the -- I guess the response will be, well, you know,\neverybody knows this.\nEverybody, no matter how well-educated or badly\neducated, or -- they all know, when they get that pension\nchoice, that if you either take it all for yourself, or\nyou say, when I die I want my spouse to get some, and\nso -- they've all made that conscious choice, and if they\nmake it to protect the spouse, that's up to them, and they\nprobably will. I mean, that will be the response,\nthink, to that argument.\nMR. HAGOPIAN: It would be. The problem, when\nyou -- my understanding -- I'm not a pension expert by any\nmeans, but when you exercise an option that protects the\nsurviving spouse, you so deflate the value of the pension\nthat it's economically a poor decision to make.\nQUESTION: I would have thought that your\nresponse would be the statutory language requires the\nresult you're urging, but you don't make that argument,\napparently.\nMR. HAGOPIAN: No, no, we do make that\nargument --\nQUESTION: Oh, you do --\nMR. HAGOPIAN: -- Justice O'Connor.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. HAGOPIAN: Yes. The statutory language\ndefinitely does require --\nQUESTION: I just didn't hear that in response\nto the question.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HAGOPIAN: Well, it was in the opening that\nI didn't get a chance to make, so --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: In your response to Justice Breyer,\nisn't it so, or am I -- counsel, am I --\nMR. HAGOPIAN: Pardon me.\nQUESTION: -- wrong in thinking that under ERISA\nthere is a requirement to provide for the surviving\nspouse, it isn't the option of the insured individual?\nMR. HAGOPIAN: Well, I'm no expert on ERISA, but\nI believe that there is a notice requirement and a sign-\noff requirement in ERISA. If the community spouse does\nsign off for her rights, then it doesn't necessarily\nhappen. It's not a mandated -- it can't be overcome by\nactivity by the surviving spouse.\nQUESTION: But it's not the insured's election\nin the first place. Of course, if the surviving -- if the\nspouse wants to cooperate and says, I don't want\nanything --\nMR. HAGOPIAN: Right.\nQUESTION: But it isn't the wageearner's\nchoice --\nMR. HAGOPIAN: No.\nQUESTION: -- to say, I don't want, usually her,\nto be any part of it.\nMR. HAGOPIAN: That's right, but I think those\ndecisions are made at a time when long-term care is not\nnecessarily in the immediate offing, and maybe -- usually\nat age 65 or thereabouts, long before nursing home stays\nmay be inevitable, and so the couple is making an informed\nchoice about how best to maximize their income stream.\nI mean, nobody is ready for nursing home stays,\nand to plan for that, you know, based at the time that you\nmake your pension election would be counter to, I think,\nhuman nature.\nQUESTION: Mr. Hagopian, I want to come back to\nthe snippet from legislative history that is referred to\non page 18 of the Government's brief. I guess if you\nbelieve that legislative history, then it would have to be\ndone the way the Government says it need only may be done.\nI mean, if you believe the Government's interpretation of\nthat legislative history, it certainly doesn't say the\nSecretary has the option. It either says what you think\nit means, or it requires the Secretary to use the income-\nfirst method, no?\nMR. HAGOPIAN: I think I frankly agree with you,\nJustice Scalia.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Hagopian.\nMs. Flanagan, you have 3 minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN M. FLANAGAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. FLANAGAN: Thank you, Your Honor. I would\nlike to talk about the impact of what the resource-first\nrule is. I think there have been questions on that.\nThe impact of the resource-first rule is to\ndevote limited medical assistance funds to couples who\nhave resources substantially above the Federal maximum set\nlevels and that, in turn, necessarily means, since we have\nlimited pots of income, that that deprives States of money\nneeded to serve --\nQUESTION: Why is that? I mean, he just said on\nthat that -- and it certainly was in the briefs, that if\nyou say they have to spend down the $300,000, they're not\ngoing to give it to the doctors in the institution.\nThey'll fix the roof, they'll pay off the mortgage,\nthey'll figure out one of 50 other things, so the State\nwill actually end up with less money, because they won't\nget that $300,000 as a set-off and, moreover, they lose\nthe income coming in later as a set-off.\nMS. FLANAGAN: Well, neither of us have any\nstatistics on that. I'm sure that people do pay off their\nlong-term financial obligations, but they also have to\npay for the nursing home, and that bill doesn't go away\nevery month, so if they're not eligible, they're going to\nhave to be providing for that in some way, so while the\nstatute doesn't force them to devote their resources to\nthat, there are powerful practical reasons why people are\ngoing to do that.\nAnother part of the impact that I'm concerned\nabout is touched on by Mr. Hagopian, who says that States\ncan just lower their resource standards and lower their\nincome maintenance standards. Well, what that says is,\nStates, you should serve fewer people. You should serve\nfewer elderly so that you can have the money to serve\npeople who happen to have resources in excess, and in many\ncases substantially in excess of the standard resource\nlimits.\nThe Cleary case, which is cited in the briefs,\nis a good example of that kind of potential situation.\nThat was a situation in which the nursing home spouse had\nsomething in the neighborhood of a $1/4 million of excess\nresources, but because of the income of the -- set-up of\nthe spouses it would have taken that -- those resources to\nmake up that income, even though that particular spouse,\nas I recall, also would have had money.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms.\n"
