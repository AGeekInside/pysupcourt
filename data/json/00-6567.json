        "content": "(10:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in No. 00-6567, Larry Dean Dusenbery v. the United\nStates.\nMr. Zieve -- Ms. Zieve. Pardon me.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLISON M. ZIEVE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. ZIEVE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThe issue in this case is whether the procedures\nused to serve notice of forfeiture of petitioner's\nproperty satisfied due process.\nThe Federal Government forfeited Mr. Dusenbery's\n$22,000 in 1988 after mailing a notice to him at the\nFederal prison where he was incarcerated. It is not\ndisputed that he did not get the notice.\nThe -- the Government argues that its 1988\nprocedures satisfied due process whether or not the notice\nwas received. However, in light of the circumstances\npresented here, including the Government's control over\nthe prisoner's location and knowledge of the prisoner's\nlocation at all times and its control over prison\nprocedures, due process requires the Government to use\nprocedures that offer assurances of delivery to the inmate\naddressee and not just to prison personnel. Such\nprocedures --\nQUESTION: Well, you take the position that it's\nnot sufficient that there be staff at the prison who\ndeliver mail to the inmates?\nMS. ZIEVE: That, in and of itself, is not\nsufficient. The -- the procedures need --\nQUESTION: A procedure whereby a prison employee\ndelivers certified mail to prisoners is inadequate in\nyour --\nMS. ZIEVE: That -- that, in and of itself, is\ninadequate as -- although --\nQUESTION: Is in adequate?\nMS. ZIEVE: Is inadequate, although those\nprocedures --\nQUESTION: How can that be under any of our case\nlaw, that that would be in adequate per se?\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, the -- under this Court's case\nlaw, what's required when the notice is served is\ndetermined by a consideration of a balance of factors in\nlight of the circumstances. And that --\nQUESTION: Well, we've never required actual\nnotice in any case, have we?\nMS. ZIEVE: No, although there is some\nsuggestion of that in -- in a couple cases, for instance,\nPhillips Petroleum. But in -- in the cases discussed in\nthe briefs, there is not a requirement of actual notice,\nbut at the same time, the Court assumes that the mailed\nnotice or the form of notice will be received, and the\nCourt hasn't considered a case where it was uncontested\nthat individual -- an individual was entitled to notice\nand yet the notice wasn't received.\nQUESTION: Well, but that's going to happen\nsometimes with any sort of notice except the requirement\nof actual receipt by the individual, and we've never felt\nthat destroyed the validity of the notice.\nMS. ZIEVE: That's true, Your Honor, but in the\ncircumstances presented here, consideration of the balance\nof factors leads to a requirement the procedures that\nwould satisfy those factors would also lead to actual\nnotice. For instance, today the Government uses\nprocedures under which, after the mail is received by the\nprison, there's not just some vague distribution process\nat the prison, but the mail is signed for. In the mail\nroom, there's a log book kept, and when it leaves the mail\nroom a log book is kept that is ultimately signed for by\nthe inmate. And this chain of receipts helps to ensure\nthat there's extra care and attention paid with the\ndelivery of the notice.\nQUESTION: Would you be satisfied with that if\nthat had been the case here?\nMS. ZIEVE: Yes. If those procedures had been\nfollowed.\nQUESTION: Even -- even though there was -- I\nwas going to say even though there was no receipt\nsignature, but I guess under the procedures now, the --\nthe prisoner would have signed a log. Is that right?\nMS. ZIEVE: Yes, he would have signed a log.\nAnd if he had a challenge and he has a signature, he's\ngoing to lose, and if there is no signature -- excuse me.\nQUESTION: The procedure that was in place for\ncertain kinds of mail that was labeled special mail -- if\nthat had been -- if that had applied to notices in this\ncategory -- special mail, as I understand it, could be\nopened only in the presence of the prisoner?\nMS. ZIEVE: That's correct.\nQUESTION: And if that had applied, that old\nrule had applied to this category of mail, you would not\nobject to that, would you?\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, the special mail opened only\nin front of the prisoner happens after it's delivered to\nthe prisoner. I think it's helpful that the FBI and the\nDEA, in recent years -- the Government writes in its\nbrief, in recent years, have considered forfeiture notices\nand labeled those as special mail, but the procedure still\nneeds to be adequate to get to that point where you're\nstanding in front of the prisoner opening the mail.\nQUESTION: Ms. Zieve, I'm -- I'm not sure what\n-- what is the general principle of which you assert the\nrule that you urge upon us in this case is -- is just an\nexemplar. Is the general principle that when the\nGovernment is in charge of the delivery system, there must\nbe actual notice evidenced by a signature of whoever it's\ndelivered to?\nMS. ZIEVE: Your Honor, that's one important\nfactor, but the case here is even easier because there are\n-- there are numerous --\nQUESTION: You're not urging that when the --\nthat the distinctive factor is that the Government is in\ncharge of the delivery system because that would have been\nthe case in the old post office when -- when the post\noffice was actually part of the Federal Government. So,\nthat's not the principle. Right?\nMS. ZIEVE: That's not the only factor. Here we\nhave not --\nQUESTION: What -- what is the principle? When\nthe Government is in charge of the residence? Right? So,\nwe would need a similar rule for all members of the armed\nforces.\nMS. ZIEVE: There are several key factors here,\nand I don't think you can separate out one circumstance\nfrom the rest. The inmate --\nQUESTION: Well, you said the first one isn't\nit. Right? I don't understand. If neither one alone is\nenough, I don't know why all in combination turn out to be\nenough.\nMS. ZIEVE: Because that's the circumstances.\nThere's a body of circumstances presented here. The\ninmate's location is not just easily ascertainable by the\nGovernment, but determined by the Government. The\nprocedures used for --\nQUESTION: Well, that would apply -- that would\napply to all members of the armed forces.\nMS. ZIEVE: The procedures used for delivery are\nalso determined by the Government, and --\nQUESTION: That would also apply to the armed\nforces.\nMS. ZIEVE: And the Government is in an adverse\nposition, which I think requires additional cross checks\nin the system to ensure that care is taken because the\nGovernment doesn't have incentive to identify and rectify\ninefficiencies on its own.\nQUESTION: You really think that that's\nrealistic here? You would not urge us to apply this rule\nin a civil action where your client was being served a\npaper by -- by someone who is not the Government.\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, if the -- if the serving party\nwere not the Government, then the person doing the service\nwould not be the person who was also in control of the\ndelivery procedures.\nQUESTION: I understand that.\nMS. ZIEVE: So --\nQUESTION: So, you have not urged the rule in\nthat case, only when the Government is -- is the opposing\nparty.\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, I'm not trying to be evasive,\nbut it's hard to answer without knowing all the\ncircumstances there. For instance, what would be the --\nQUESTION: All the other circumstances are just\nlike this one except that the complaint was not on behalf\nof the Government. It was behalf on a private individual.\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, then the private individual\nwouldn't have control over the procedures. It might be\nthat mailing wasn't -- wasn't adequate in that\ncircumstance. It might have to do with the value of the\nproperty.\nQUESTION: You can answer this yes or no. Do\nyou assert that your rule would apply in that situation or\nnot? All of the circumstances are the same. The only\ndifference is the complaint was not filed by the\nGovernment, but by a private party.\nQUESTION: Say it was for an ordinary debt, that\nthe prisoner owed money and the creditor brought suit.\nMS. ZIEVE: It might not apply in that\ncircumstance, but whether or not it does, this is an\neasier case.\nQUESTION: Let -- let me ask you. I -- I take\nit you begin from the premise that mailed notice is\nadequate for a civil suit, or do you? I'm going to ask\nthe Government the same thing. I -- are we supposed to\nwrite an opinion that -- that says that mailed notice is\nadequate in any civil suit?\nMS. ZIEVE: No. The -- in fact, under rule 4(d)\nmailed notice is not adequate under civil suit -- for any\ncivil suit. But I don't think --\nQUESTION: From a constitutional -- I know what\n4(e) says, but from a constitutional standpoint, is mailed\nnotice adequate in any civil suit?\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, I think it's probably not\nadequate in any civil suit.\nQUESTION: All right. What is -- what is it\nabout this that makes mailed notice adequate whereas\napparently there's another class of cases in which\npersonal service is required?\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, this case --\nQUESTION: You -- you begin I -- I think with\nthe assumption that mailed notice would be adequate, and\nthe question is, are these mailing procedures adequate in\nthis case?\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, no, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: But I'm -- I don't want to have you\ntake a position you don't take. But it -- it does seem to\nme that that is the baseline assumption from where you\nbegin the argument. Am I correct about that?\nMS. ZIEVE: Not exactly, Your Honor. This case\nis not really a mailed notice case because the procedures\nthat are inadequate are the procedures that happened after\nthe mailing. The mailing is the first step in the\ndelivery chain, and the question here is the adequacy of\nthe procedures after that.\nQUESTION: But I'm asking why is mail adequate\nat all? You seem to assume that, and that's fine. We can\ndecide the case on that basis. But you make the\nassumption that if the mail were received, the mailed\nnotice would be adequate.\nMS. ZIEVE: If the mail is received by the\ninmate?\nQUESTION: Yes. And I want to know why that is.\nI'm going to ask the Government. If we have to write this\ncase, it would seem to me that at least an argument could\nbe made that personal service is required --\nMS. ZIEVE: Well --\nQUESTION: -- in any civil case. And then we\nask if this is a forfeiture or there's some old hangover\nfrom the in rem idea that is still somehow affecting us\neven though we don't talk about in rem anymore and so\nforth.\nBut I want to know what your -- your beginning\nprinciple is for the due process, elementary, minimum\nstandards of service.\nMS. ZIEVE: The mailed notice is any form of\ndelivery -- any form of notice is adequate as to that\nindividual if it's received. The mailed notice is\nadequate when it's received, and in this case, the\nGovernment's procedures used certified mail so that you\nknow that the mail was received. If the Government had\nmailed the certified mail to the proper prison and it had\nnot been received, the certified mail slip never came\nback, then I don't think the mailed service would have\nbeen adequate.\nQUESTION: Have any of our cases ever required\ncertified mail?\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, the first case where the Court\nconsiders whether mailed notices is constitutional in Hess\nv. Pawloski, the mail at issue was certified mail.\nSubsequent to that, the Court hasn't made a distinction\nbetween the form of mail.\nThe Court also hasn't considered the case where\nmail was sent but not received. And the Court's cases in\nMennonite Board and Tulsa Professional Collection\nServices, in the cases discussed in the briefs, the\nquestion was whether an individual was entitled to notice\nin addition to publication or posting, not whether -- the\nCourt had no occasion to consider what would happen if the\nnotice was mailed but never got there.\nQUESTION: It seems to me one of the\ndifficulties I find with your position, Ms. Zieve, is that\nthis inquiry can come up, you know, months and maybe years\nafter the actual notice took place or didn't take place.\nAnd it's one thing to say we have a -- you followed a\nsystem and that system affords due process, but to have\nevery case turn on perhaps an argument between the person\nwho's seeking to set aside the service -- I never received\nit -- and someone else saying, yes, you did receive it, I\nthink is rather unsatisfactory.\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, that's why the procedures\nshould require proof of verification which the\nGovernment's procedures do today. If Mr. Dusenbery was\nserved with a forfeiture notice today, he would be\nrequired to sign for it and there would be no question\nlater about whether or not he received it.\nQUESTION: Was he not --\nQUESTION: Your --\nQUESTION: The question I'd have is we all seem\nto agree now that the question -- the Government has to\nprovide reasonable procedures. Reasonable means\nreasonably calculated to give actual notice.\nMS. ZIEVE: Under the circumstances.\nQUESTION: Well, don't say -- there's no such\nthing. There's no such thing. Under the circumstances\ndoesn't add anything I don't think. You say is it\nreasonably calculated to give actual notice. I haven't\nfigured out your qualification, how that would work.\nBut why wasn't this precisely? Precisely what's\nwrong with these procedures in your opinion?\nMS. ZIEVE: The --\nQUESTION: Why are they not calculated to give\nactual notice reasonably?\nMS. ZIEVE: The 1988 procedures did not provide\nassurances of delivery because what happened after the\nmail reached the mail room is -- was vague and\nundocumented. And as the Government acknowledged --\nQUESTION: I always thought the procedure -- I\nthought the -- what -- what -- tell me precisely. I think\nthe procedure is, A, mailed to a prison. B, it comes to a\nprison, and a person who works for the prison signs for\nit. Then the procedure required what? C. What was it\nrequired? And then what should it have required?\nMS. ZIEVE: The procedure was that the mail room\nemployee picked up the mail and signed the certified mail\nreceipt at the post office, brought it back to the prison,\nwhere he entered it in a log book. A prison employee\ntestified that in 1988 the procedure then would have been\nthat a -- a housing unit staff would have signed when he\ntook the mail -- the certified mail out of the mail room.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. ZIEVE: He also testified that he didn't\nknow what the procedure was after that.\nQUESTION: All right. I guess after that -- a\nreasonable person would think the procedure after that is\nyou give it to the person it's addressed to. Now, is -- I\nmean that would be normal in life. Is there any testimony\nthat that wasn't the procedure? No.\nMS. ZIEVE: No. There was no testimony about\nthat.\nQUESTION: Okay. Now, we've described the\nprocedure, and now you tell me what, in your opinion, is\nwrong with that procedure.\nMS. ZIEVE: The procedure doesn't require\nverification of delivery and that --\nQUESTION: Okay. So, in your opinion, it is\nunreasonable not to have an additional step that the\nprisoner signs for it.\nMS. ZIEVE: Yes, and the reason is this.\nBecause the documentation -- the improved documentation\nimproves delivery. The -- the Department of Justice Board\nof Prisons memorandum that the Solicitor General lodged\nwith the Court both in 1999 and 2001 -- it ties improved\ndocumentation to improved delivery.\nQUESTION: Then -- then whenever there's a\nrequirement or -- a requirement -- procedure for service\nby mail, it should be certified mail so the person signs\nfor it in every case.\nMS. ZIEVE: In --\nQUESTION: Ms. Zieve, you couldn't say every\ncase because in Mullane regular mail was adequate in that\nunder the circumstances, which was heavily emphasized by\nJustice Jackson, those words, under the circumstances.\nMS. ZIEVE: In Mullane and in some cases where\nthere's a class of interested parties where everyone has\nthis same interest, it might not be necessary for all\ninterested parties to receive the notice. As the Court\nrecognized in Mullane, because there were many\nbeneficiaries of a 113 different trusts and they all had a\nidentical interests --\nQUESTION: All right. Then I'll -- then I'll\namend my question. In a case where there is only a single\ndefendant and service is permitted by mail, it must be by\ncertified mail.\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, that would likely be\nreasonable since the burden of doing so is so small and\nthe increased -- the decreased risk of it not reaching the\naddressee would be --\nQUESTION: You don't mean that it might\nreasonable. You mean it isn't reasonable not to do it.\nThat's your argument.\nMS. ZIEVE: Right.\nQUESTION: It isn't reasonable not to do it.\nAnd I guess a person who thought it was reasonable not to\ndo it would say, well, we can't think of everything, and\nyou know, it's in the prison, and prisons normally do\nwork. I mean, they're not great, but they have a -- a\nfairly disciplined order. And so, it's good enough. And\nyour response to that is what?\nMS. ZIEVE: It wasn't good enough in -- in these\ncircumstances. The Government has shown us --\nQUESTION: Well, they might -- they might say\nmore than that. They might say we have no reason to\nbelieve that the prison delivery system is any worse than\nthe post office's delivery system.\nAnd I -- I guess it's your -- I guess it's your\ncontention that even if the reason your client never\nreceived the notice was -- had nothing to do with the\nfault of the -- of the prison. It was the Postal Service\nthat lost the -- the notice on the way. That would still\n-- that would still invalidate the service. Right?\nMS. ZIEVE: It would still mean the forfeiture\nwas done without adequate notice.\nQUESTION: So that -- so -- which would not be\nthe case, I suppose, unless you're going to adopt the\ncertified mail rule, which would not be the case for an\nordinary citizen who is not incarcerated. If notice is\nsent to an ordinary citizen and the post office looses it,\nunless you adopt the certified mail rule, that would be\nadequate notice. But in the case of an incarcerated\nperson, if the post office looses it, it is not adequate\nnotice. Right?\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, I don't know that it would be\nadequate notice to serve someone by mail out of prison if\nit's not received.\nQUESTION: Well, what is -- what is the\nstatutory requirement in your view for forfeiture as -- as\nfar as notice is concerned?\nMS. ZIEVE: The statutory requirement?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. ZIEVE: Is publication and notice to the\ninterested party.\nQUESTION: By mail? What is the general\nstatutory requirement on these forfeiture notices?\nMS. ZIEVE: I believe the statute says by mail,\nalthough the Government always does it by certified mail.\nAnd it does that --\nQUESTION: Is it in the materials we have in the\nbriefs? Is there some copy of that provision somewhere\nthat you're aware of in the briefs? Don't take a lot of\ntime if you don't know. I just thought perhaps you knew.\nIs in your brief at all?\nMS. ZIEVE: It's on page 3 of the Government's\nbrief.\nQUESTION: Page 3.\nMS. ZIEVE: It just says, shall be sent to each\nparty who appears to have an interest.\nQUESTION: See, that's why I don't know how to\ndo it because, I mean, suppose there's a ship, for\nexample. Take the other extreme case. People forfeit\nships. People have tort actions against ships, and you\ncould have ships that are owned by thousands of people,\nfor example. And where you bring the action against the\nthing, it's fairly normal that you don't actually have to\nget the signature of every person who has some interest in\nthat ship, for example. Now, I think, am I not right, or\ndo you have to get the signature?\nIf -- if, for example, you're bringing an action\nagainst a thing and the thing is owned by millions,\nthousands, or hundreds, does the -- do you have to\nnormally, under the rules -- forget the Constitution for\nthe moment -- you have to get the signature on a -- on\nthat notice, a return receipt requested of each person who\nhas an interest in that thing?\nMS. ZIEVE: Under the statute?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. ZIEVE: Now, you've asked a sort of\ncomplicated question because the statute for an in rem\njudicial forfeiture requires publication, but the\nGovernment, based on this Court's case law, gives notice\nby certified mail.\nQUESTION: But I take it your argument would be\nthat even if all the signatures are not required in the in\nrem case, there is -- there is a fairness in the procedure\nthat would not require actual notice and signatures to\nevery ship owner because the owner of the ship at least\nhas some right to control the ship. So, you say, look, if\n-- if they don't pay attention to what's happening to\ntheir ship, we -- we can tag them with that.\nBut the difference between that case and this,\nas I understand it, is there is a period between delivery\nof the letter and what should be the point of receipt by\nthe prisoner when the prisoner is not in control of the\nprocess. The post office has finished its part. So, if\nwe assume regularity on the post office is normally\nenough, that isn't enough here because there's a hiatus\nbetween where the post office stops and the point at which\nwe hope the prisoner gets the delivery.\nAnd I take it you would be satisfied in this\ncase, even without a rule requiring actual signature, if\nthe Government were required to show, with a greater\ndetail than you say it has here, that there was a regular\nprocedure, at the time involved here, that makes it just\nas probable that the letter would have gotten from the\nfront door of the prison to the prisoner, as it is\nprobable that the letter mailed in the box gets to the\nfront door of the prison. You'd be satisfied with that\nkind of a rule, wouldn't you?\nMS. ZIEVE: Yes. I'm not -- it's not -- it's\nnot important to petitioner how the procedures --\nQUESTION: How he wins the case as long as he\nwins. I realize that.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. ZIEVE: No.\nQUESTION: I mean, you would -- you would be\nsatisfied if -- if we had the -- I take it, the same kind\nof demand for proof of regularity for the period between\nthe front door of the prison and the prisoner's cell that\nwe do from the mailbox to the front door of the prison.\nThat would be a reasonable system. And -- and you'd be\nsatisfied with it, I would take it, as a general rule.\nMS. ZIEVE: Probably.\nQUESTION: It would be nice to have a signature\nrequirement, but basically we -- we would have the same\nkind of rule then that we have with -- with respect to\nmail delivery in general.\nMS. ZIEVE: Yes, but the reason that I emphasize\nthe signature is because, as the Bureau of Prisons has\nsince recognized, the -- the signature does help to\nimprove delivery. It helps to make sure that this letter\nis treated with some extra attention and care. It ensures\nthat it's not going to get misdelivered to Larry Smith two\ncells over.\nQUESTION: What do we do with prisoners who\nwon't sign?\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, actually the Board of Prisons\nprocedures deal with that, and I think effectively, which\nis on the log book, if the prisoner refuses to sign, then\nthe person delivering the mail signs for it stating that\nthe prisoner won't sign, which I think is comparable to a\nprocess server giving a contemporaneous statement that\nservice has been completed.\nQUESTION: You know, it seems to me we need to\nfocus on some kind of a test, and I thought I understood\nyou to argue for a test that says in these prison cases,\nthere has to be actual receipt by the prisoner. And I --\nI know the Third Circuit and probably the Fourth have a\ndifferent sort of test, which is that the Government just\nhas to show that internal prison delivery procedures are\nadequate. Is that an acceptable general statement of the\ntest?\nMS. ZIEVE: They have to be adequate. My view\nis that under this Court's -- the analysis that this Court\nhas used in its cases, in its due process cases, that\napplying that general statement leads to the same result\nthat I'm arguing for here, although if the Court --\nQUESTION: You say it isn't adequate unless\nthere's actual receipt.\nMS. ZIEVE: Yes, because those procedures are --\nit's entirely practicable to do that. There's -- it is\nnot difficult to --\nQUESTION: Well, in the event we don't agree\nwith you, what's your fall-back position?\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, even under the Third Circuit's\nformulation, the Court, looking at the 1988 procedures in\nthe record, such as they are -- those procedures were\ninadequate. It's uncontested that he didn't get the\nnotice, and the procedures as described, are inadequate,\nalthough for the same reasons as I think lead to actual\nnotice, even if you don't want to go that far.\nQUESTION: Why is it that a procedure is\ninadequate if the procedure is that if we get certified\nmail, we -- we deliver it to the prisoner? What's\ninadequate about that as a procedural standard?\nMS. ZIEVE: Again, it doesn't provide the\nassurances of delivery that both are feasible because, if\nyou're going to deliver it, it doesn't take that much to\njust get the signature, and because I think it's important\nto have cross checks to make sure that the Government --\nQUESTION: Do we look back at Mullane or at\nMathews v. Eldridge for our guidance here in establishing\na standard?\nMS. ZIEVE: I think either one, Your Honor.\nMullane states -- sort of states the test in one sentence,\nbut I think summarizes the three-part framework that\nMathews articulates later. Either way you can reach the\nsame result. The value of the property at stake, the risk\nof erroneous deprivation, the valuable -- the value of\nadditional procedures, and the burden on the Government,\nthe factors to consider, all lead to same -- to the result\nhere that the prison should have done more and could have\nand should have ensured actual notice to inmates in its\ncharge.\nQUESTION: -- apply this rule to any -- anything\nother than prisons or are you talking about the\ncircumstances of someone incarcerated by the Government?\nIs there any other setting in which you would require not\nmerely that certified mail be sent and signed for by\nsomeone, but in-hand delivery?\nMS. ZIEVE: There may be other cases, though\nthere also may not be. This is the easy case. If there's\nany circumstances where actual notice is required, it's\ngot to be these where the Government is both the sender\nand sort of the recipient for later delivery to the person\nwho it knows where it is --\nQUESTION: Why is it the easy case? It is the\ncase, I take it from your argument, because you haven't\nsuggested that there might be another setting other than\nwhere the Government has someone in confinement.\nMS. ZIEVE: No, I haven't.\nQUESTION: Is it any part of your argument that\nwe should be suspicious of prison officials because they\nmay use a refusal to follow their procedures for\nvindictive reasons or anything like that?\nMS. ZIEVE: That may occur, Your Honor, but our\nargument does not rely on any malfeasance on the\nGovernment's part.\nQUESTION: That's not your argument.\nQUESTION: Well, if that's not part of your\nargument, I don't see why your situation is any different\nfrom the military situation where, unless -- unless the\nserviceman or woman is AWOL, the Government knows right\nwhere that person is and the Government is responsible for\n-- for where that person is. I don't know why you\nwouldn't have the same rule.\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, to be honest, I hadn't\nconsidered the military situation, and maybe there's more\nparallels. However, there's still the -- the inmate is\nstill special in that he has no control over his property.\nThere are no proxies looking out for him, for his\ninterests. And the mail, even when it's sent to the\nmilitary, my assumption is that if you get certified mail,\nthe soldier is going to sign for it. The officer will\nsign for it and not someone for later delivery to him\nwithout any proof or documentation about what happened in\nthe interim.\nIf the Court has no further questions, I'd like\nto reserve the balance of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Ms. Zieve.\nMr. Minear, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. MINEAR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis Court has repeatedly held that the notice\nrequirements of the Due Process Clause are satisfied by a\nmethod of notice that's reasonably calculated to provide\ninterested parties with notice of the proceedings.\nThe Government's method of providing notice in\nthis case, this forfeiture case, satisfies that test. The\nmethod was by the use of certified mail. And petitioner\ndoes not dispute that mails generally are satisfactory for\npurposes of notice. Rather they draw the distinction that\nonly in the case of prisoners is that method unwarranted\nor unconstitutional.\nPetitioner is asserting a constitutional\nviolation. It therefore has the burden of proof of\nestablishing the procedures the Government used are\nunconstitutional.\nAnd I'd like to clarify a point with regard to\nwhether notice was received here or not. The Government\nhas not submitted that notice was not received. We simply\nare unable to prove that it was not received.\nQUESTION: So, why not just put the burden on\nthe person who was supposed to get it to prove he didn't\nget it?\nMR. MINEAR: Well, that is in fact what the\ncourt did. It didn't -- there wasn't a test it required,\nbut the inquiry was made, and the court concluded that\nwhatever the protestations of the defendant might be, or\nthe prisoner in this case, nevertheless the method that\nwas used here was reasonably calculated to reach him. And\nthat is all that Mullane requires.\nQUESTION: No, no. Look, what I take it that\nshe's arguing for is there's a step missing here and it\nshould apply not just to prisoners, apply to anybody who's\ngoing to have their property forfeited, and that is, you\ngive them notice by certified mail so they have to sign\nit. That's the point. So, it would apply to everybody,\narmed forces, everybody. And what's wrong with that? It\nisn't that hard to do. It protects pretty thoroughly\nagainst losing your property without even knowing about\nit. So, do it.\nMR. MINEAR: The problem --\nQUESTION: That's -- that's basically, as I\nunderstand it, the argument.\nMR. MINEAR: The problem with that position is\nit's contrary to 50 years of this Court's precedence,\nwhich has consistently recognized that mailing alone --\nnot certified mail -- but ordinary mail, is sufficient to\nprovide parties with notice.\nQUESTION: Where did the Court hold that?\nQUESTION: Have we ever said that with reference\nto a simple contract or tort action?\nMR. MINEAR: No. All of the cases in which this\nissue has arisen in this Court's jurisprudence have\ninvolved special procedures. Nevertheless --\nQUESTION: Well, that's why I'm asking because\nin Mullane and subsequent cases, we have tended to say\nthat the in rem/in personam distinction is -- is not too\nclear a line.\nAre you arguing for the proposition that, again,\nin a standard contract or tort case, notice by mail would\nbe sufficient?\nMR. MINEAR: We are certainly willing to defend\nthe proposition that the Federal Rules of Procedure, which\nprovide --\nQUESTION: No. I'm talking about -- I'm talking\nabout due process requirements now.\nMR. MINEAR: Yes. And -- and with regard to the\nFederal Rules, they do recognize that service can be\neffected through mail -- through the notice of waiver\nprovisions that are set forth there, and we would defend\nthe constitutionality of those provisions which allow the\nparty to, in fact, accept service by notice.\nQUESTION: If this Court writes a due process\nopinion, can we say that mail, routine mail, is always\nsufficient, or are there some cases in which you must have\npersonal service?\nMR. MINEAR: Well, the Court can certainly do\nthat. We might caution that it's not necessary to do that\nin this case.\nQUESTION: Well, I want to know what the\nprinciple is that you're -- that controls our case, the\nbeginning principle here.\nMR. MINEAR: The Court has drawn these\nprinciples largely from common experience and knowledge\nabout the instrumentalities that are used for purposes of\nservice. And if we looked at the Mullane case, the Court\ncited that the mails had, through common experience, been\ndetermined to be a reasonable means for providing service\nin that type of proceeding.\nNow, whether the Court would want to take the\nstep of saying that the mails are always adequate in any\nproceeding is a step that's not necessary for the Court to\ntake. And so, I'm hesitant to suggest to the Court that\nit ought to do so. It certainly does not need to do so in\nthis case because this case involves procedures that are\nvery similar to Tulsa, to Mennonite, to Schroeder, to --\nQUESTION: All right. So, then you are relying\non the fact that this is a forfeiture case and we're --\nthere's this voice of the past of in rem versus in\npersonam hanging over this -- this argument of yours.\nMR. MINEAR: Well, actually no, Your Honor.\nIt's not the in rem nature of the proceedings, but rather\nit's a -- it's an intersection of two factors.\nOne, this type of proceeding is similar to the\nproceedings this Court has dealt with previously that are\nnot necessarily in rem. For instance, probate claims are\nnot necessarily -- would not necessarily be treated as in\nrem I think under -- under traditional law. But it's --\nit's the intersection of the fact that these proceedings\nare similar to proceedings elsewhere that the Court has\nalready ruled on and the fact that this Court can draw on\nits long experience the mails are, in fact, as a practical\nmatter, a reasonable means for providing service or\nproviding notice.\nQUESTION: I'm just very puzzled by your\nreliance on Mullane when Justice Jackson took such care to\nsay this procedure, common trust fund, so many\nbeneficiaries, some unknown, some addresses lost -- if we\nuse regular mail, the chances are it will get to many, if\nnot most, people in the group, and that's good enough for\nthat kind of case. Here we're talking about some $12,000\nthat once belonged to an individual, not 113 trusts\ncombined together in a common fund with hundreds, even\nthousands of beneficiaries.\nQUESTION: Your Honor, Mullane has been extended\nbeyond the facts of its individual case. And this case\nis, in fact, quite similar to the Court's most recent\ndecisions, such as Tulsa Professional Services. In that\ncase, I believe there was some $12,000 in medical fees\nthat were in dispute. The -- the creditor in that case\ncouldn't count on other claimants, as in Mullane, to\nperhaps make the arguments that that creditor might --\nQUESTION: Well, but that was with the probate\nproceeding. And as Justice Ginsburg's questions point out\nand what I've been trying to -- to explore with you, this\nis a case where a person has an ownership interest. It's\nnot that much different from an ordinary contract or tort\naction.\nMR. MINEAR: Yes, Your Honor. And we think that\nthis case is similar to Tulsa and ought to be treated as\nsuch. I'm simply reluctant to urge this Court to go\nbeyond the facts of this case and to deal with the\nquestion of a civil complaint and whether ordinary --\nQUESTION: I suppose -- I suppose in probate a\nclaimant, a debtor claimant, is in much the same standing\nas a person who sues in contract on that claim before the\nperson dies.\nMR. MINEAR: Well, yes. But probate is very\nsimilar to the situation here, that the notice that is\nbeing provided is simply to ascertain whether there are\nany claims outstanding to the property at issue. And if a\nperson does make a claim, then that initiates a judicial\nprocedure in which further process would be necessary.\nBut this case is --\nQUESTION: Here there's no doubt about the\nperson who has the interest. It was not like sending out\na notice: any interested people come forward. The\nGovernment knows who the person in the world is who has a\nclaim to this $12,000.\nMR. MINEAR: But, Your Honor, the same could be\nsaid, for instance, in Mennonite with regard to the\nmortgagee, that the person who is -- that -- that was a\nsituation in which there was an interest in -- in\nforeclosing on a property and selling it at a tax sale.\nNow, the Government in that situation certainly could have\nidentified the mortgagor and simply provided notice by\npublication. This Court said that notice by mail was\nsufficient. It was the minimum that was necessary and it\napplied in that --\nQUESTION: -- better than publication generally.\nMR. MINEAR: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- publication is the least\neffective, and the Mullane case that you rely on so\nheavily makes that point.\nMR. MINEAR: Yes, and that's the reason why the\nGovernment in these situations provides notice by\npublication, also by notice to the person's last address,\nand also notice to his current address if it can be\nascertained. In this case, the Government, through\nreasonable diligence, was able to locate the individual\nand send notice to his place of incarceration.\nThe only thing that distinguishes this case, in\nfact, is that the mails are being directed to a prison,\nand the only real question here is whether the prison\nsystem is reliable. And what we established at trial was,\nin fact, it was. There were procedures in place to ensure\nthat the mails were delivered to prisoners.\nQUESTION: Fine. Then you would win even under\ntheir rule because then the prisoner would be unable to\nprove that he didn't get the notice.\nSo, assume that that's the rule. The prisoner\nhas to prove he didn't get the notice. Anyone who doesn't\n-- who actually gets notice loses. Assume that. What I'd\nlike to know is, assuming that, what is the argument\nagainst saying where it's a forfeiture case and where the\nforfeiting -- the person who's going to get the property\nknows the address of the individual who would forfeit the\nproperty, that person has to use certified mail? What she\nsaid was the Government does that anyway in forfeiture\ncases.\nMR. MINEAR: The argument against that, Your\nHonor, is that the Due Process Clause simply specifies the\nconstitutional minimum. The Government can make a\ndecision to provide more process than is necessary.\nQUESTION: Fine. And my question is, what is --\nif you're in the Government, aside from -- well, it's a\nlittle easier. Is there any policy reason for not doing\nit?\nMR. MINEAR: The reason -- there -- there are\nseveral reasons for not recognizing this as a -- a general\nconstitutional standard. One is the fact that it would\nhave to be applied to other analogous situations at least\nby a parity of reason-\nQUESTION: All right. And the reason that\nthat's wrong is because? I mean, the harm that it will do\nit other analogous situations. Give me an example of some\nserious problem that would be caused by such a rule.\nMR. MINEAR: The rule would, first of all,\nrequire, for instance, as the Chief Justice has pointed\nout, similar service on the armed services. It also would\napply to other situations that might not be documented in\nthe record. For instance, it's my understanding that the\nPostal Service delivers mail to dormitories and\nresidential halls in bulk for distribution to the people\nthat live in those halls. So --\nQUESTION: So, I want an example, since you're\nwriting the address anyway -- I want an example of the\nproblem that would be caused by saying you not only have\nto write the address, you also have to send it certified,\nwhether it's to dormitories, armed forces, prisoners, or\nanyone else in the world. What's the actual practical\nproblem that would cause the Government?\nMR. MINEAR: Well, I cannot say that the\nGovernment cannot overcome that difficulty, because it\ndoes in fact use certified mail.\nBut the problem is should the Court erect that\nas a constitutional standard, and the difficulties with\nerecting that as a constitutional standard, as I pointed\nout before, is it will be very difficult to cabin that to\na wide variety of other situations --\nQUESTION: With certified mail, you have to get\na signature from the recipient, whereas with ordinary\nmail, you can put it in the slot in your mailbox. In\nother words, it's often difficult to obtain the certified\nmail signature in a way that it wouldn't be to get the\nordinary mail slot.\nMR. MINEAR: That's correct. And, for\nexample --\nQUESTION: But shouldn't it be difficult if\nyou're going to take $20,000 away from them?\nMR. MINEAR: Your Honor, but again, this case is\non -- on par with other cases that involved similar\namounts of money.\nAnd with regard to the signature -- obtaining\nthe signature, my suggestion is it might be that the\nlitigation will shift from the assertions that we think in\nmany cases are -- are untrue, that the person did not\nreceive the notice, that, well, a guard signed for me and\nnever actually -- I did not refuse to receive it and a\nguard simply signed and said that I refused.\nWhat we're trying to do from a policy\nperspective, from the Bureau of Prisons' perspective, is\nto eliminate the sort of wasteful litigation that takes\nplace over assertions.\nQUESTION: Mr. Minear, the Third Circuit has\napparently adopted a test that requires the Government to\nshow a little more than that it dropped a notice in the\nmail, and that, in fact, the Government must show that\nprocedures at the receiving facility, the prison, were\nreasonably calculated to deliver notice to the intended\nrecipient.\nMR. MINEAR: Yes.\nQUESTION: Is that a -- a standard that the\nGovernment would find satisfactory?\nMR. MINEAR: We disagree with that, Your Honor,\nfor the reasons set forth in Judge Alito's dissenting\nopinion on -- on that ground; namely, that it imposes\nburdens that are not necessary. The burden is on the\nperson who's raising the constitutional challenge to show\nthe deficiency in the procedures, and no deficiency in the\nprocedures has been shown.\nQUESTION: But your -- your argument, it seems\nto me, is premised on the fact that forfeiture is like an\nin rem proceeding and it's just different. Assume with me\n-- I'm not sure that this is -- assume that there's a\nconstitutional due process requirement for personal\nservice unless there's some showing of unavailability in\nthe routine case for contract and tort. Why should this\nbe any different?\nMR. MINEAR: The reason -- the reason why --\nQUESTION: That may be an heroic assumption.\nI'm not sure that's true. I think -- let me go back.\nDo you know of any State which in an ordinary\ncivil action allows service by mail as a routine matter?\nMR. MINEAR: I don't know of --\nQUESTION: Absent unavailability or the fact\nthat the person is avoiding the process server or\nsomething like that?\nMR. MINEAR: I don't know of any State that\nallows ordinary mail. I believe that a number of States\nhave adopted certified mail with return receipt requested.\nI believe that California follows that pattern. And in\nfact, the Federal rules that provide this optional method\nwere based on that -- on that approach.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nBut then -- then going back to the other\nquestion, it seems to me your case is premised on the\nassumption that this is a forfeiture in rem type,\ndifferent action than -- than a routine contract or tort\naction.\nMR. MINEAR: Well, we certainly do think it\nfalls on the side of the -- of the line that this other --\nthe other cases of this Court demarcs, namely probate\nproceedings, tax sales, condemnation proceedings, notice\nof forcible entry and detainer proceedings, which are\nbasically ejectment proceedings. All of those types of\nproceedings have involved situations where this Court\nindicated that notice by ordinary mail would be\nsufficient.\nNow, we go beyond that. We do provide certified\nmail as -- as a matter of policy. And it serves an\nimportant policy --\nQUESTION: May I ask you? This is prompted by\nJustice Scalia's question. Does the Government have any\nspecial procedures for people in the military?\nMR. MINEAR: I'm not aware of any special\nprocedures that -- that we provide in those situations.\nFor instance, if there was forfeiture --\nQUESTION: And I should think there's a lot of\nmail that might -- addressed to a serviceman that might be\nsigned for by the mail orderly or something. He may never\nget the mail. I'm just wondering if the -- there's\nnothing in the record about that, is there?\nMR. MINEAR: No. There's nothing in the record\nand it's not clear to me at all that if there was a\nforfeiture that was directed to a serviceman, it would be\ntreated any differently.\nQUESTION: What about the -- the immunity while\nthe person -- there's an immunity that governs people in\nthe military during the time. Is it -- what is that\nstatute?\nQUESTION: The Soldier's and Sailor's Civil\nRelief Act.\nMR. MINEAR: Yes, and I'm not sure how that\nwould apply in this situation. It might very well toll\nthe type of requirement --\nQUESTION: It would toll the statute of\nlimitations because the person could assert immunity for\nthe period that they're in service.\nMR. MINEAR: Yes. I'm simply not certain how\nthat would apply. But I do know that for general civil\nprocedures -- for civil forfeitures, the regulations of\nthe FBI do provide mechanisms such as mitigation and\nremission that can ameliorate some of the hardships, where\na party can actually show that there was nonreceipt.\nQUESTION: But can I ask you a question that\npuzzles me about this? The -- even before the current\nregulations, there was this special mail category and\nseveral things fell into it, including letters that the\nprisoner would get from the attorney. Those have to be\nopened in the presence of the prisoner?\nMR. MINEAR: That's correct.\nQUESTION: And then there was this category\ncalled law enforcement. And why wasn't a notice of this\ncharacter categorized as law enforcement and therefore put\nwithin the special mail category?\nMR. MINEAR: I think for a short while the DEA\nand the FBI did follow the practice of denominating\ncertain mails as special mail. I'm not sure if the\nspecial mail category existed in 1988. I don't think the\nrecord is clear on that.\nI would point out, however, that under the\nBureau of Prisons operations memorandum, there is more\nprotection to providing it by certified mail rather than\nby special mail, primarily because of the long period of\nretention of the log books for certified mail. And so,\nthe practice for -- the current practice of BOP --\nQUESTION: That applies to the Federal system,\nbut the rule we're working with today would apply to State\nforfeitures as well, the State prisons and the like. So,\nyour rules don't necessarily tell us what would happen in\na -- to a State prisoner.\nMR. MINEAR: No, they do not, although I think\nthat the -- the Court can -- can safely assume that State\nprisons do, in fact, provide for mail delivery to their\nprisoners.\nQUESTION: Would you just comment on the\nsuggestion that your opponent has made, in effect, that\nthere really ought to be a special rule for people who are\nin the custody of the Federal Government? And I assume\nwith Justice Scalia that would include military personnel\ntoo. Is there -- would it make sense to say that when\nthey know darned well where a person is, there's no reason\nto have three publications in the local newspaper? You\njust make sure you get it to -- to where the man is.\nMR. MINEAR: Well, there's no reason to depart\n-- that's certainly -- the fact that we know where the\nperson is, certainly does dictate that we contact the\nperson by mail, and that's inconsistent with Mullane and\nits progeny, that where the address is reasonably\nascertainable, the person should be contacted by mail.\nThe fact that we have the person under our\ncontrol I don't think adds anything to that. The basic\nquestion is, is this notice reasonably certain to reach\nthe inmate? And if it does, it doesn't really matter if\nhe's at a location of our choosing or some other location.\nIt's simply what's important here is, is this method, is\nthe procedure reasonably certain to provide actual notice?\nQUESTION: Is there any court action -- if you\naccepted your -- your points and said, look, they send it\nto the prison. It's signed for in the prison. So, up to\nthere, it's certified. And then a person regularly picks\nit up, and this person did, and then delivers it to the\ncell. Suppose the picker-upper either maliciously,\nnegligently, or deliberately didn't give it to the\nprisoner. Would the prisoner have any kind of claim under\nthe Tort Claims Act?\nMR. MINEAR: I think not under the Tort Claims\nAct because it does exclude intentional torts. There\nmight be the -- the opportunity for either seeking redress\nthrough the prison administrative remedies or through a\nBivens type action. But certainly the problem there --\nQUESTION: -- Bivens type action. It must be\nthat there's a constitutional right or -- I mean, that's\n-- but -- but is under the Torts Claims Act negligence?\nMR. MINEAR: Under negligence? There is\nconceivably an opportunity to seek damages based on\nnegligence, although you'd have to show an absence of --\nof due care. In the case of the Government, the\nregulations here do certainly provide the sort of\nreasonableness that we think compliance with would --\nwould satisfy the standard.\nQUESTION: Let me make sure I understand your\nposition on one point. Is it your view that that even if\nyou had not use certified mail in this case, but just used\nregular mail and an affidavit by the Secretary that it was\nmailed and so forth, that that would be constitutionally\nsufficient?\nMR. MINEAR: Yes. It's our view that that would\nbe constitutionally sufficient. The procedures that we\nuse, with regard to certified mail, are something that we\ndo beyond constitutional requirements in order to --\nprimarily to ensure that we can disprove false claims of\nnonreceipt.\nQUESTION: Mr. Minear, am I correct that the --\nthat the current method of simply providing written notice\nis -- you -- you maintain that that is method that\nCongress has specified in 19 U.S.C. 1607(a)?\nMR. MINEAR: The method of -- the requirement of\nproviding written notice I believe is in 1881, on page 3\nof our briefs. And all that Congress has specified is\nthat -- oh, excuse me. It is 1607(a). I'm mistaken.\nWritten notice of seizure, together with information --\nQUESTION: This is on page 3, Mr. Minear?\nMR. MINEAR: On page 3, and the -- at the end of\nthe first indented paragraph.\nIt provides that written notice of seizure is to\nbe provided. It does not specify mail --\nQUESTION: Shall be sent.\nMR. MINEAR: Shall be sent.\nQUESTION: Shall be sent.\nMR. MINEAR: To each party --\nQUESTION: What do you think that means? How\ndoes one normally send things?\nMR. MINEAR: Well, normally by mail, and we\nthink that it's --\nQUESTION: It doesn't say shall be sent by\ncertified mail. I think it's -- a fair reading of what\nCongress thought was adequate was -- was by mail.\nMR. MINEAR: Yes. I think that by ordinary\nmail. And I think -- as I say, the certified mail\nprocedure is something that the Bureau of Prisons and the\nagencies have adopted in order to disprove false claims of\nnonreceipt. That's its principal purpose.\nBut it's our position that ordinary mail is\nsufficient here as it would be in the wide variety of\nother cases, comparable other cases, this Court has\naddressed.\nQUESTION: How do you think the Sixth Circuit\nstandard differs from the Third Circuit's and the\nFourth's?\nMR. MINEAR: I think as a practical matter, Your\nHonor, there's primarily a question of the burden of\nproof. Under the Sixth Circuit's standard, we are simply\n-- if we are challenged, if there's a challenge to whether\nmail was -- was received or not, it's the obligation of\nthat party who's raising the challenge to prove the lack\nof reasonableness.\nQUESTION: Well, but here the Government is\nseeking to forfeit property from someone. Maybe it's not\nunreasonable to think that the Government has the burden\nof proving that notice was given or reasonably calculated\nto be given.\nMR. MINEAR: Well, the Government met that\nburden in this case, but again, we don't think that that\nshould be the test. Rather, we think that it's the\nobligation of the party to show that -- what defects are\nnecessary. And in this case, the only defect -- the only\nproof of inadequacy that petitioner showed was his claim\nthat he did not receive the notice, and we in return\nindicated there were procedures in place that would have\nascertained the mail.\nNow, because the issue is joined, it's likely\nthe Government would be required or would find it\nnecessary or useful to put forward information about\nprocedures.\nBut the problem with the Third Circuit standard\nis it requires that we, ex ante, at the very beginning of\nthe process, go through and determine what procedures are\nin various prisons. And that doesn't seem particularly --\nthat seems particularly inappropriate with regard to State\nprisons where we think it's reasonable for us to send --\nto mail the receipts to the prisons with the expectation\nthat those State prisons will forward the mail\nappropriately.\nQUESTION: Mr. Minear, we have a smattering of\ncourts of appeals cases addressing the issue that we've\ngot today, but beyond that, I don't know how much\nlitigation there is about this. Do we have any indication\nof how much time in forfeiture cases is spent litigating\nthe question of notice?\nMR. MINEAR: I don't know the answer to that,\nYour Honor. As we point out in the brief, in the year\n2000, the Government, the DEA and the FBI, sent out\nroughly 9,000 notices of forfeiture to their incarcerated\nprisoners. Now, how many of those are contested, I don't\nknow the answer to that, but certainly there is the\npossibility of a substantial clog on the courts,\nparticularly over claims of nonreceipt which are so easily\nmade.\nQUESTION: Well, except that I -- I don't know\nthat the -- that that argument really favors you. There\nwould be certainly some questions of -- of adequacy of\nsignature and so on. But if there were a -- a certified\nmail kind of signature requirement, I'm guessing that\ninstitutionally it might be of some help to the courts\nbecause I'm -- I am assuming that in most cases there\nwouldn't be any contest. If the Government had the\nsignature, it would go forward. If it didn't have the\nsignature, it would wait until it got one. So, I am -- I\nam assuming that, knowing nothing, if I don't know any\nfacts beyond what I know now, that there might be an\ninstitutional advantage in a rule that required the -- the\nkind of proof that -- that your friend on the other side\nwants.\nMR. MINEAR: Your Honor, I think that -- you\nknow, that the Department of Justice, and the Bureau of\nPrisons in particular, has tried to be helpful in that\nregard with -- with regard to providing this type of\nprocess. But we simply do not believe that it's required\nby the Due Process Clause and was not required to be in\nplace in 1988 when this case arose.\nQUESTION: But would you -- would you agree that\nthere can be an institutional consideration in a closed\ncase in deciding what due process does require?\nMR. MINEAR: That certainly is a factor that the\nCourt could weigh, but again --\nQUESTION: Well, you'd have no problem if we --\nif we held the way you've asked us to hold. I mean, that\n-- that institutional problem would disappear if you put\nit in the mail and there are prison procedures in place,\nas there are in every prison, everything is okay. Right?\nQUESTION: There wouldn't be any litigation\nabout that.\nQUESTION: There wouldn't be any litigation.\nMR. MINEAR: Well -- well, no. No, there isn't,\nbut there are also State prisons that do need to determine\nwhat procedures they would follow. And my guess is there\nare a large number of State prisons that follow the\npractice that was in place in 1988, namely that certified\nmail may be signed by the -- by the prison officials, but\nthey may not have recorded signatures with regard to the\nactual receipt by the inmate.\nQUESTION: And you think it's not reasonable for\nthe Government go assume that the State prison procedures\nare adequate to get mail to State prisoners. You don't\nthink that that's reasonably calculated to get mail to\nState prisoners.\nMR. MINEAR: We think it is reasonably\ncalculated. Exactly, yes.\nQUESTION: So, if we held that this is a\nreasonable -- sending it by mail is a reasonable way to do\nit, you wouldn't have any more of an institutional\nproblem.\nMR. MINEAR: Well, no, we wouldn't. At the\nsame --\nQUESTION: But if we -- if we said that because\nthere is a gap between mail delivery to a prison and\ndelivery to a prisoner and, for that reason, there must be\nsome indication of the procedure for getting the mail to\nthe prisoner, then you might have a -- a problem and there\nmight be an institutional advantage in a signature rule.\nWouldn't there?\nMR. MINEAR: Well -- well, that's correct. But\nagain, I think that the baseline, the constitutional\nbaseline, here should be that ordinary mail suffices, and\nit's left to the --\nQUESTION: I don't understand why it's -- it's\nintuitively obvious that ordinary mail suffices when we\nhave a situation here which is different from the\nsituation covered by the -- the ordinary mail. In the\nordinary mail situation, the mail is delivered to\nsomeone's post office box or -- or a mailbox, and that box\nis under the control of the addressee. We don't have that\nhere. We have a -- we have a gap between that point and\nthe point at which the mail gets to a prisoner. And\nthat's why it doesn't seem obvious to me that merely\nadopting an ordinary mail rule is appropriate to these\ncircumstances at all. What am I missing?\nMR. MINEAR: Your Honor, I think what -- what\nyou see here is the proceedings below validated the fact\nthat ordinary mail would suffice, the fact that there are\nmail --\nQUESTION: The proceedings below didn't -- as I\nunderstand it, did not stop with proof that the letter was\nmailed. The proceedings below involved an -- an\nindication of what the prison did with the mail when it\ngot it in order to get that mail to the prisoner. Isn't\nthat correct?\nMR. MINEAR: Well, perhaps the answer to your\nquestion, Your Honor, is that this Court can certainly\naffirm the decision below and say that the procedures\nbelow were adequate. It would be our view, though, that\nthe Court ought not to foreclose the possibility that\nordinary mail would suffice.\nQUESTION: Mr. Minear, are there -- do you know\nwhether there are more prisoners incarcerated in prisons\nthan there are college students living in dormitories to\nwhom the mail is not delivered personally or -- or\nindividuals living in high rise apartment buildings where\nthe mail is -- is sorted downstairs and not delivered by\nthe -- by the postman to their -- to their own room?\nMR. MINEAR: I do not know the answer to that,\nYour Honor.\nQUESTION: That's a problem for all those\npeople, just as it is for prisoners. They have to rely on\nwhatever institution they're in getting the mail to them.\nMR. MINEAR: Yes. Although I would draw a\ndistinction between the apartment building where\noftentimes the mail is provided -- is sorted by the mail\n-- by the U.S. Postal Service, put into individual boxes,\nand the dormitory residential hall. I think the Postal\nService does draw a distinction between apartment\nbuildings and dormitories in that regard.\nQUESTION: Mr. Minear --\nQUESTION: What about a hospital?\nQUESTION: -- there was a period when mail was\nnot always routinely delivered to prisoners. Sometimes it\nwas censored and all the rest. Would you say that\nordinary mail would have been sufficient in that period of\ntime?\nMR. MINEAR: Yes. Well, we think -- again,\nthere are --\nQUESTION: The warden could just put it on the\nshelf and not even give it to the prisoner and there would\nbe no remedy at all.\nMR. MINEAR: Obviously, if there is -- if there\nis reason to believe by the party that's sending notice\nthe mail will not -- that ordinary mail will not suffice,\nthen due process may require that additional steps be\ntaken.\nQUESTION: Mr. Minear, in the -- in the hospital\nsetting, the Government has a claim against someone, knows\nthat person is hospitalized, sends ordinary mail to the\nhospital for the contract claim, the tort claim, whatever.\nIs the Government saying that for an individual it is\nenough that mail is sent to that person care of an\ninstitution, no return receipt requested, that will do to\nsatisfy due process notice requirements?\nMR. MINEAR: Your Honor, I think that it would\nfor this reason, that if a return address is provided and\nthe mail is not delivered by the hospital, we can expect\nthe hospital to send the mail return it to sender. Upon\nlearning that, the Government may be on an -- under an\nobligation at that point --\nQUESTION: But suppose the hospital doesn't?\nSuppose all we know is that this mail -- well, I think\nyour time is up.\nMR. MINEAR: Okay. Thank you, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Minear.\nMs. Zieve, you have 2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALLISON M. ZIEVE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. ZIEVE: First of all, I'd like to address\nthe -- the suggestion that these cases are about false\nclaims. Mr. Dusenbery actually made claims -- tried to\nget return of property of eight categories of forfeited\nproperty in this case and in the one cited at 201 F.3d\n763. As to seven of the eight categories, it was proven\nthat he didn't get the notice either because it wasn't\nsent at all or it was sent to the wrong place. So,\nthere's no reason to think that he's lying about the\neighth.\nIn addition, this is not a mail notice case.\nWe're not talking about the adequacy of mail notice to a\nmortgage company or a creditor of an estate. This case is\nmore comparable to a situation in which you have a process\nserver go out and you prove that you gave the notice to\nthe process server, but you don't ask him or her to ever\ngive you any verification that it was served.\nCertified mail -- counsel suggests it could be\nabove the constitutional minimum, but applying this\nCourt's framework, this Court's test for assessing the\nadequacy of notice, we know it's not above the\nconstitutional minimum because it will reduce the risk of\nerroneous deprivation at minimal burden, and we know it\nreduces the risk because it can only be -- the notice can\nonly be delivered, if their signature is required, to the\naddressee. It will not be sent as in a private residence.\nIt won't be misdelivered to your neighbor's house if you\nhave to sign for it. In a prison, it's not going to be\nmisdelivered to the next cell or bundled with something\nelse. The inmate is going to have to sign for it.\nAnd finally, the Third Circuit, which did not\nrequire actual notice, did so only because of concern\nabout the evidentiary burden it would place on the\nGovernment to have that standard, but the Government's\ncurrent --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Zieve.\nMS. ZIEVE: Thank you.\n"
