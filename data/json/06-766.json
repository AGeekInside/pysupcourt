        "content": "(10:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst today in Case 06-766, New York State Board of\nElections v. Torres.\nMr. Olson.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON.\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS NEW YORK STATE\nBOARD OF ELECTIONS, ET AL.\nMR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nFor 10 years, New York relied on political\nparty primaries to nominate general election candidates\nfor supreme court justice, but that process discouraged\nqualified candidates and spawned unseemly, expensive,\nand potentially corrupting fundraising by judicial\ncandidates.\nSo the legislature substituted an indirect\nparty primary system at which delegates are elected who,\nin turn, select general election candidates at political\nparty conventions.\nThe Second Circuit concluded that the\ndelegate convention statutes enabled political parties\nto exercise too much influence at the expense of the\ninsurgent party members or insurgent candidates and\nstruck those statutes down as facially unconstitutional\nand reinstated the discredited primary process.\nThe issue in this case is whether the\ndelegate-convention system is facially unconstitutional\nbecause it allows party leaders to defeat the\naspirations of party insurgents.\nStates have broad, as this case has\nrepeatedly held -- broad constitutional latitude to\nprescribe the time, place, and manner of elections,\nparticularly elections for State office.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Just focus on, if you\nwould, Mr. Olson, on the election for the delegates.\nNow, suppose it were shown -- a hypothetical\ncase -- that it's extremely difficult to get on that\nballot. You need, let's say, 2,000 signatures in 30\ndays. Would there be a constitutional issue raised by\nthat situation?\nMR. OLSON: Well, in the first place, as you\nknow, Justice Kennedy, that -- that is not the case\nhere. It takes 500 signatures --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: A hypothetical case.\nMR. OLSON: If it were an impossible burden\nto get on the ballot, I still don't think that First\nAmendment associational rights would be involved.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What about Kusper, the\nKusper case?\nMR. OLSON: I don't think the Kusper case\ngoes that far, Justice Kennedy. I think that, as the\ncases of this Court --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I think we have made it\nvery clear that if you're going to use a primary system,\nyou can't have such burdensome registration requirements\nthat the primary system is not, to all intents and\npurposes, to all intents and purposes open to those who\nwish to participate.\nMR. OLSON: I think that the other factor\nthat is involved here is that, provided that there is\nreasonable access to the general election, which is\nanother factor in this case, then the constitutional\nrights to associate are satisfied.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So you think that in\nKusper, if -- if there was reasonable access to a\ngeneral election, you can structure and stifle the\nprimary any way --\nMR. OLSON: Well, I think that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm just looking at the\nprinciple here, and it may be that you'll say that\nthere's no burden here, et cetera. But I just want to\nknow: Isn't there a constitutional principle that we\nare entitled and we must look at the fairness of the\nprimary system insofar as participation of the voters?\nMR. OLSON: I think that the case that maybe\nbest answers that is the Munro case, in which the State\nof Washington's practice -- and there was a different\npractice of the State of Washington before this Court\nearlier this week. But at that point in time the\nprocess was that there was an open blanket primary,\nwhich was not held unconstitutional at that point, where\nthe major candidates -- the one and two positions of the\nmajor candidates of each of the political parties would\nget on the ballot, and then the Socialist Party was\ncomplaining because it took 1 percent of the votes of\nthe primary process to get on the general election\nballot.\nThis Court held that that -- that that was\nnot an impossible burden, and that -- the principle from\nthat case and the other cases, the American political --\nAmerican Party of Texas v. White and so forth, the\nCourt's jurisprudence has held that, as long as there is\nreasonable access for a candidate or a political party\nto the general election process, then it does not have\nto be provided in that level in the primary.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it right to\nregard the election of delegates here as a primary\nelection?\nMy understanding, of course, is that that\nsimply elects -- it doesn't get you on the ballot. It\nelects delegates who then exercise the choice. Do you\nthink our primary election cases are transferable to\nthis situation?\nMR. OLSON: Well, I think there are two\nanswers to that. Your primary election cases talk in\nterms of, the ones that have been mentioned in the\nbriefs here, talk particularly in terms of protection\nunder the Equal Protection Clause.\nThis is -- it's called a primary, but it's\nan election of delegates by party members that -- and\nthen, when those delegates get together, they go to the\nconvention. So I'm not sure that the nomenclature makes\nso much difference as this is a process that the State\nhas allowed the party to implement to choose its\nleadership. The Court has repeatedly held that there is\nno point in the process --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The State has not allowed\nit. The State has required it, no?\nMR. OLSON: Yes, the State requires it, but\nit --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Although if we -- if we\nhold it unconstitutional for the State to require it, I\nsuppose it would also be unconstitutional for the State\nmerely to allow it, wouldn't it? So that this manner of\nselecting judges in any other State, if it has been\nvoluntarily adopted by the party, would be\nunconstitutional?\nMR. OLSON: That's the principle that the\nRespondents in the Second Circuit advance. It would\nstrike down the conventions, because conventions are, by\ndefinition, selections of individuals to represent the\nbroader constituency at a subsequent --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Just to make it clear, is\nit your position that, with reference to this election\nfor delegates, the State can make it as burdensome as it\nchooses on those who wish to put themselves forward on\nthe ballot as a proposed delegate?\nMR. OLSON: I think, Justice Kennedy, as\nlong as the system in the State provides a reasonable\naccess to candidates and political parties to the\nelection process, that there is not a First Amendment\nright with respect to the primary process or the\npreliminary process, which in this case includes both\nthe so-called delegate selection primary --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what if it were\nthe parties that objected to this and not some\nindividual who said, I'm not being given enough voice in\nthe party? What if the parties said, we don't want to\nselect our candidates this way? Is it clear that the\nState could impose it upon them?\nMR. OLSON: It's clear the State has the\nright, and this Court has said so in the American Party\nof Texas v. White, that the State can require either a\nprimary election or a convention. The Court\nspecifically addressed that. In fact, what the Court\nsaid: It is too plain for argument that a State may\ninsist that intraparty competition be settled by primary\nor convention. That's the holding of that Court --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That convention --\nconventions can come in all sizes and shapes. The\nargument here is that this system shuts out\nrank-and-file party members and gives the total control\nto the party leaders, and that the preliminary was the\nprimary or selection of delegates, but it's really a\nsham because nobody is going to run for that except the\nparty faithful, someone picked by the party boss.\nSo the argument on the other side is\nthat this system, as complicated as it is, reduces to\nthe party leaders choose the candidates.\nMR. OLSON: Well, what this Court has said\nin the California Republican Party v. Jones case, a cite\nquoting the Eu case, the Eu case that the Court had\ndecided before, is that the political party has the\nright to select its leadership, to select its nominating\nprocess, to select its candidates, and to exclude\nmembers. So, Justice Ginsburg, the party has the right,\neven arbitrarily, as long as the Fourteenth Amendment is\nnot violated in an election context, to exclude members\nof its party.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the State can\nrestrict that right if it wants to. The State can\nrequire the party to select its candidates by -- by\nprimary.\nMR. OLSON: By primary or -- or by\nconvention.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or by convention.\nMR. OLSON: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But if the State wants to\ndo it by smoke -- if the party wants to do it by\nsmoke-filled room, the State can say, if it wishes to\nsay, you can't do it by smoke-filled room.\nMR. OLSON: It can, Justice Scalia, but the\nState must respect the rights of the political parties\nin determining who their leaders and candidates must be.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but that -- but\nthat's not the issue here. The State and the party are\nin agreement.\nMR. OLSON: Yes. Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The State is not trying to\ncoerce the party into doing something that it doesn't\nwant to do.\nMR. OLSON: Yes, I totally agree with you.\nBut I'm answering hypothetical questions with respect to\nsomething else. What this Court has said, that this\nCourt vigorously protects the special place the First\nAmendment reserves for the protection by which a party,\npolitical party, selects a standard-bearer. Selecting a\ncandidate is selecting the person that will communicate\nthe party's interests --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So the party is -- you're\nidentifying the party with the party leader because the\nargument comes down to this is not the rank and file\nthat's making this election; this is the party leader;\nand the party might like that or the leadership might\nlike that, but the rank and file might not, and the\nargument is that they have rights of association, too.\nMR. OLSON: Well, they have rights of\nassociation, but they have -- they have associated in a\npolitical party which has elected leadership which makes\ndecisions, Justice Ginsburg.\nThey do not have a right to belong to the\nDemocratic Party or the Republican Party. The rank and\nfile, so forth -- the definition of \"insurgent,\" which\nis at the other side of the table here, are people that\nare rebelling against the duly elected leadership of the\npolitical party.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But if there is a\nState-mandated primary, I thought it's basic law that\nthe State may not place unduly restrictive barriers to\nparticipation in that primary. I think that's a given,\nit seems to me. Now, tell me if I'm wrong --\nMR. OLSON: I may be --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And then we can argue\nabout whether the burden is too great here, which it may\nnot be.\nMR. OLSON: Let me say, Justice Kennedy,\nthat I may be wrong in terms of what this Court's\ndecisions stand for with respect to ultimately allowing,\nas far as associational rights are concerned,\nindividuals and parties access to the total electorate.\nBut even if your premise is correct that there must be\nan open access in a reasonable way to either the -- to\nboth the primary and the general election, then this\nprocess is reasonable. It's not unreasonably difficult\nfor a person to participate.\nLet me say -- let me enumerate the ways. An\nindividual, a rank-and-file member, can campaign and\nvote for delegates. An individual might become a\ndelegate himself by -- or herself, by getting 500 names\non a signature, and that's far below what this Court has\nindicated before was -- was an acceptable level of\nrequirement of access to the ballot. An individual can\nattempt to form delegate slates, can attempt to persuade\nthe delegates, can -- the individual can form or switch\nparties.\nIn this case the Respondent Lopez Torres,\nactually in the 2003 election, became a candidate at the\ngeneral election for supreme court justice of the\nWorking Families Party, and she did that without giving\nup her registration and membership in the Democratic\nParty. She was in that election and she lost.\nFinally, and this is even if she hadn't been able to\nsecure the nomination of that political party, she could\nrun in the general election. There's access to -- it\ntakes 3500 to 4,000 signatures to run as an independent\nbody in the general election.\nSo there is way after way after way for\nindividuals in New York to participate in the election\nprocess.\nSo in answer to your question,\nJustice Kennedy, to the extent that your statement of\nthe principle with respect to access to both the primary\nand the general election is -- is the law of this Court,\nthen that access exists here.\nBut I come back to the point that political\nparties have the greatest possible latitude -- yes,\nJustice Scalia, that the Court has upheld certain\nrestrictions with respect to how the nominee of the\nparty gets selected. But the Court has also said that\nwhen the party is in that process, its powers and rights\nand First Amendment freedoms to elect the\nstandard-bearer, to select the standard-bearer, are at\ntheir apogee, because the person selected as a\ncandidate, whether that person might be the most\nfavorable person to the rank and file, the duly elected\nleadership of the political party might decide, well,\nthat person really isn't qualified to be a supreme court\njustice even --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Have we -- have we imposed\nany such restrictions on our own, as opposed to merely\nupholding restrictions that were imposed by the State?\nThat is to say, have we held that the Constitution\nitself imposes certain restrictions?\nMR. OLSON: Except in the context of\nanalyzing what State requirements have been?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. I want a case where\nthe State did not impose the restriction and it was up\nto us to decide whether the State could do that or not,\nbut rather the State said the party can do whatever it\nwants, and we have disallowed what the party itself\nchose under no compulsion from the State --\nMR. OLSON: Aside --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- on the basis of some\nconstitutional principle apart from the Equal Protection\nClause --\nMR. OLSON: Yes. The only cases --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- or the Thirteenth\namendment.\nMR. OLSON: The only cases that I would\nsubmit, that I'm aware of, that would answer that would\nbe Equal Protection Clause cases, because the --\nthese -- the political party is a group of people that\ndecide to form together because of common beliefs. In\nthe -- that is the maximum freedom that we allow for\nassociations.\nWith all the business about smoke-filled\nrooms and things like that, people have the right to\ndecide, make decisions --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think a political\nparty could say, you can't vote in our primary unless\nyou've been a member of our party for 4 years?\nMR. OLSON: Yes, Justice Kennedy. I -- I\ndon't -- in an association --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: This would be a\nState-mandated party primary for --\nMR. OLSON: Well, a party might --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- election --\nMR. OLSON: A party would -- there's two\nquestions there. If the party wants to have a 4-year\nrequirement before you can be a part of that\nassociation, I can't understand what the First Amendment\nassociational right would be.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, what about --\nMR. OLSON: If the State imposed that, the\nparty could say, well, that's unreasonable; we want to\nopen -- in fact, the Court decided this by saying that\nthe --- the party who wanted to could allow independents\nto vote.\nIf I might, Mr. Chief Justice, may I reserve\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Didn't Justice Kennedy\nasked if the Kusper case was correctly decided?\nMR. OLSON: Well, I'm not -- I think I tried\nto answer that the best I could by saying that I think\nthe import of the cases, without getting into the\nspecifics of that, are that if you have a reasonable\naccess by individuals or political parties to the\nelectoral process, that satisfies the Constitution.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Olson.\nMr. Rossman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. ROSSMAN\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS NEW YORK COUNTY\nDEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE ET AL.\nMR. ROSSMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI'd like to begin by responding to\nJustice Kennedy's question regarding the election of\ndelegates and fairness for voters. There are two\nresponses: In this case that I have -- this case, there\nwas conceded below that the requirement for delegates of\ngetting only 500 signatures was no barrier at all.\nAnd secondly, I would say that in\nconsidering that question, Justice Kennedy, the\nimportant thing is to consider what is the intended role\nthat the State gives to the participants in this\nprocess? And what the role here is that individual\nvoters have the opportunity to vote for local delegates\nwho are to represent their interests at the convention.\nAs Cousins instructs, once they have the opportunity to\npull a lever for the delegate that shares their values\nand their preferences, their right of suffrage is\nsatisfied.\nWhat they do not have, what Respondents and\nwhat the lower courts would like to have exist but\ndoesn't exist and isn't required under the Constitution,\nis the opportunity for rank-and-file voters to vote\ndirectly for the candidates at the nomination stage, and\nthat's the difference between a delegate-based\nconvention and a primary.\nIf we agree, and I think the Court would\nagree, that there is no right to a primary -- that's\nsomething, in fact, that's conceded in this case; there\nis no constitutional right to a primary -- then there is\nno State requirement that there be a direct opportunity\nfor association between voter and candidate at the\nnomination phase; that it is perfectly appropriate and\nconstitutional for that association to be between voter\nand delegate, and the voters then rely on their locally-\nelected delegates to advance their interest in the\nconvention process.\nThat's the difference between a convention\nand a primary. We think it's a critical one here. So\nthe cases --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In practice, how many\npeople other than the slate selected by the party\nleaders run in New York for this delegate position?\nMR. ROSSMAN: In New York City, the evidence\nbelow was that approximately 12 to 13 percent of\ndelegate slates are contested. What we suggest is that\nthe availability of a contest is the key. It's not the\nfrequency of the contest, because there's also evidence\nin the record that for open primaries for civil court,\nwhich is the closest parallel, that those are only\ncontested 28 percent of the time.\nSo the fact that an election is not\ncontested, that there may be voter apathy out there,\nthat there may be party unity that causes people to\nrally behind the parties and their leadership, is not a\nconstitutional problem.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The theory of this, I take\nit, is that, just as you said, voters elect convention\ndelegates, and those convention delegates choose the\nofficial nominee, say, of the Democratic Party. So that\nnominee goes on to the final ballot.\nMR. ROSSMAN: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what then of the fact\nthat the convention delegates when they meet won't let\npeople who would like the position of the judge appear\nbefore them?\nMR. ROSSMAN: Well, that is not the general\ncase in the State of New York.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's not?\nMR. ROSSMAN: But even if it is, the\nimportant thing is not that individual candidates appear\nto politic before the delegates, it's that delegates\nhave the freedom under the statute to vote for whatever\ncandidate they like. There's evidence that there's\nlegislative intent that, in fact, candidates not appear\nat the convention because it would be unseemly for them\nto do so.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well then, how are the\ndelegates to find out the qualifications? In other\nwords, if that's the intent of this statute, then you\nhave a statute that's designed on the one hand to have\nconvention delegates who will choose, and on the other\nhand to prevent the convention delegates from finding\nout the qualifications of the different applicants, in\nwhich case it would seem to be a statute that would give\nthe actual power of selection to the leader or the\nchairman -- I forget the title -- of the Democratic\nParty. And I don't know about the constitutionality of\nthat or not. In other words, go ahead.\nMR. ROSSMAN: Let me respond to the most\ndifficult part of your question first, which is the\nconstitutionality of the party leader selecting a\ncandidate we think is not troublesome at all. In fact,\nthere are many instances in New York and in other States\nwhere the political leaders, through their structure, do\npick the candidates, for example in the case of vacancy\nelection, which this Court upheld as constitutional in\nthe Rodriquez case.\nBut the question that I think that you're\nasking is, is there some denial of voter or delegate\neducation, and does that pose a constitutional problem?\nWe have here a bare statutory framework and the\nstatutory framework does not in any way, shape, or form\npreclude the ability of delegates to become educated\nabout the candidates. Within that bare statutory\nframework. The parties themselves, through what we\ncontend is core associational activity protected by the\nFirst Amendment, participate in their own way of\nchoosing in educating delegates and in putting forth the\ncandidacies of judicial -- potential judicial nominees.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose that the\nState can make the judgment that it's more likely that\nthe delegates would be informed about the qualifications\nof candidates for judgeship than voters?\nMR. ROSSMAN: In fact, we think that is the\nvery judgment that the State has made here. And when,\nas Mr. Olson said, when it went from a primary to a\nconvention process, the idea behind it in part was that\nthe delegates could be more educated, would be expected\nto be more educated than rank-and-file voters would be\nabout judges. And the evidence in this case is that\nrank-and-file voters are not educated hardly at all\nabout the judge candidates that they select. So we\nthink this is clearly a legislative sensible policy\nchoice to put the selection process in the hands of\nthose who have the motivation and the opportunity to\nbecome more educated about those that they're selecting.\nNow, one thing that needs to be recalled in\nthis process is, of course, it is not merely a State-run\nelection. As -- as the Court observed in Jones, it is a\nparty affair, too. So there are core First Amendment\nrights of the parties themselves that attach.\nAnd the question -- I think in response to\nJustice Ginsburg's question about whether there's\nconfusion between the party leaders and the parties, it\nis our reading of the Eu, Tashjian and Jones cases that\nthe Court has recognized that parties have a structure\nand have the core constitutional right to create their\nown structure, and their leadership can make choices for\nthe parties. So they can choose to endorse candidates,\nfor example. They can choose to associate or not\nassociate with particular individuals. And that's a\nchoice that's made here by duly elected leaders of the\nparties.\nAnd if there's a problem with that, the\nremedy for that problem is in the political arena. The\nremedy is for the rank-and-file voters to vote their\nparty leaders out when they come up for election if they\nadopt a process that they don't like or they think\nsquelches the input of the rank-and-file members.\nSo the reason that -- the reason why that's\nnot happening here, we believe, could be attributable to\none of two things. It could be attributable to apathy,\nwhich the Constitution does not have a prerogative to\nstamp out, or it could be attributable to party unity\nand the fact that leaders are sensitive to who will be\nbest to advance the interests of their rank-and-file\nmembers. But we don't think there's a constitutional\nproblem with that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if the autonomy of\nthe party and, let's say, the leader is the\njustification for this, the party -- how -- how\nautonomous can a party be when it's told, even if you\nwant to be more democratic about how you choose your\ncandidates, you can't because New York is forcing this\nsystem on you?\nMR. ROSSMAN: Well, the only system that New\nYork is forcing is a bare framework for representative\ndemocracy. It's a convention. It's no different than\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the parties are not\nprotesting in this case, are they?\nMR. ROSSMAN: Absolutely not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If and when that situation\narises, I suppose we can -- we can decide it. But it's\nnot here. The parties are totally happy with this and\nwould do it on their own.\nMR. ROSSMAN: We absolutely agree. The\nparties intervened from the outset of this case, both\nmajor parties, because they share the view that the\nsystem is better than a primary would be, and they\nbelieve that their right --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In fact, it is probably\nlikely the parties got this system adopted by the New\nYork legislature.\nMR. ROSSMAN: Well, however the legislative\nprocess has unfolded, in 1921, multiple times since, and\nto the present when the legislature filed an amicus\nbrief with the Second Circuit, the legislature has\nclearly been in support of this. And we think it's\nwithin -- it's a core State power, it's a sensible\nlegislative choice that they have made. It' ss within\nthe contours of American Party of Texas v. White, which\nrecognized, as Justice Scalia observed moments ago, that\nthe State can choose to have primaries or conventions.\nWhere the State has chosen to have\nconventions, party rights attach to that. And the one\nthing that the lower court did that we urge the Court to\nconsider to be quite inappropriate was to apply strict\nscrutiny to what is routine core party associational\nactivity. Leaders developing candidacies, recommending\ncandidates, endorsing candidates, and fielding delegates\nwho they think are loyal to the interests of the party,\nthat doesn't deserve strict scrutiny. At worst, we\nthink there's no burden here to the rank-and-file voters\nto force them to participate in the party's own\nconvention. But even if there were some burden, at\nworst, we think that there are countervailing rights\nhere. And where there are countervailing rights the\nCourt should prefer to the legislative expertise here,\nand the expertise -- thank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Rossman.\nMr. Schwarz.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF FREDERICK A.O. SCHWARZ, JR.\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS\nMR. SCHWARZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nOn a robust record, the district court,\nconfirmed in great detail by the Second Circuit, found\nthat there were severe burdens placed upon insurgents\nand placed upon party members who wished to band\ntogether to support a candidate.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What about the burden on a\nsingle delegate wanting to be on the ballot? I think\nthat requires 500 votes, and there was no specific\nfinding that that was burden, was there? Or am\nincorrect?\nMR. SCHWARZ: Two --there was no specific\nfinding that was a burden, you're correct. I have two\nadditional points to make.\nFirst, if you look at John Dunne's amicus\nbrief, John Dunne was a Republican leader in the State\nof New York. He was chairman of the judiciary committee\nfor many years in the State Senate. And he on page 19\nof his brief describes how it was impossible even for\nhim to get admitted as a delegate, and it wasn't\nworthwhile to try and be a lone gadfly.\nSecondly, the courts analyzed the burden in\nterms of the difficulty of assembling and running a\nslate of delegates, a slate that cut across the various\nassembly districts, and the court found --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Assuming that the plaintiffs\nhave associational rights at stake here, isn't this a\ncase where there's a conflict between two associational\n-- two sets of rights of association? You have the\nparty hierarchy who wants to, in your own words, fence\nout the insurgents. That's a right not to associate.\nAnd then you have the insurgents who want to be fenced\nin?\nMR. SCHWARZ: Well, the --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that different from\nthe cases that you rely on?\nMR. SCHWARZ: I -- I think not, Your Honor,\nbecause I think if you think about the question of do\nthe party leaders have the right to stifle the voices of\nordinary members, one should conclude no, and it's very\ndifferent from your decision in Jones.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But that's charged language:\nThey have the right to stifle.\nMR. SCHWARZ: Okay.\nJUSTICE ALITO: The insurgents, do they not\n-- does not the right of association include the right\nnot to associate?\nMR. SCHWARZ: I think, Your Honor, the right\nof association does not include the right to use an\nelection system imposed by the State which makes it\nimpossible. That's where the burden comes from. It's\nbecause the State has imposed this system on every\nparty. So I do not think there is a countervailing\nright on the other side.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What are your -- what are\nyou best cases for that proposition?\nMR. SCHWARZ: In the -- I would say in the\nfirst place I'd have to start out by saying there's not\nthe case on all fours like this. The -- then I would\nsay that's quite clear why that would be, because\nthere's no system like this in the United States and\nnever has been.\nThe -- I guess I would say after that point,\nthat the cases -- first, there are principles in your\ncases. There's a principle being worried about the\neffect of State laws serving to entrench power. That's\na theme that runs through all your cases.\nSecondly, there is in your cases the --\nmany, many cases that hold what's important is to make a\nrealistic assessment of how a statute actually works.\nNow, having said those two points by way\nof -- three points by way of preliminary, first, there's\nnothing on all fours and really you wouldn't expect it,\nthen what are cases that I think are -- that bite in our\nfavor? Well, there are principles in the cases.\nI would start with Storer and Storer says in\nassessing severe burden what you want to look at is the\n-- is the realistic effect of whether people have gotten\non the ballot. And Storer says if you find that happens\nrarely, while it's not conclusive, it's the -- it's\nindicative that there is a severe burden.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But Storer --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't that a general\nelection case?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's a general election\ncase, isn't it?\nMR. SCHWARZ: Well, but the principles of\nwhether the election, general election cases and the\nprimary cases should apply, it seems to me are the same\nprinciples. The root principles that apply are the same\nones.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let me ask you\nabout that.\nMR. SCHWARZ: Please.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let's suppose the\nState doesn't think that direct voter election of judges\nis a good idea, that it thinks there ought to be some\ninsulation to avoid the problems of judges campaigning\nand raising money and all that; yet, at the same time\nthey want some participation by the voters in the\nprocess. Is there any way they can achieve that\nobjective, to have the nominees actually chosen not by\nthe voters but by a convention, and yet have some role\nby the voters?\nMR. SCHWARZ: There absolutely is, Your\nHonor. We do not claim here that any convention is\ninappropriate. Conventions are appropriate.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I'm just asking\nis there a way to have a convention with some role by\nthe voters or the party --\nMR. SCHWARZ: Yes, Your Honor, as long as\nthat convention does not set up severe barriers to\npeople competing; and I would say even if you look at\nthe Board of Elections' own --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, doesn't that\nseem kind of odd, that if a State can have no role for\nvoters, it can have a pure convention, that they're\npenalized if they have some role for voters?\nMR. SCHWARZ: I wouldn't put it as being\npenalized, Your Honor. I think it is the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Being found\nunconstitutional is a pretty severe penalty.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SCHWARZ: But it's what we seek and we\nthink the courts below appropriately granted, Your\nHonor. The -- but it's not penalizing the State for\ndoing something; it's saying if do you this, and if you\nseverely burden, as after an extensive fact-finding\nhearing the court held the statutes do, then you have to\nshow that there's a compelling justification.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Schwarz -- I'm sorry,\ngo ahead.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The, the problem that I\nhave in the analogy you are drawing on the application\nof your principle based on the general election cases is\nthis: There is concededly -- and you mentioned this\nearlier -- there is concededly no unreasonable barrier\nto somebody who wants to become a delegate. He's got to\nget 500 signature, but that can be done. The burden\nthat I understand that your clients are complaining\nabout is the, in effect, the burden of influencing the\nultimate decision-maker to decide to nominate that\nperson.\nAnd that burden is -- is focused on two\npoints: number one, the entrenched power of the\npolitical bosses; and number two, the difficulty --\nwell, I guess three points -- the difficulty of\nfielding, for a dissident to field a whole slate of\ncandidates who in effect, once elected, would make the\nnomination desired; or, three, the capacity of the\nintending or the aspiring candidate to influence the\ndelegates directly once they're selected, because the\ntime is short.\nAnd those aren't -- those aren't, it seems\nto me, complaints about access to the electoral process.\nThey're complaints about the capacity to influence those\nwho are elected, who make the ultimate decision. And\nthat's the difficulty I have in the analogy that you are\ndrawing or the parallel that you are making between the\ndirect election cases and your claim here. Could you\ncomment on that?\nMR. SCHWARZ: Yeah. I guess I want to make\ntwo comments. First, it seems to me the principles that\nare in your direct election cases, and also primary\ncases like Kusper and the Panish v. Lubin or Lubin v.\nPanish, where the Court took the language in your\nWilliams case about you ought to be worried if there are\nmultiple parties competing, clamoring for a place on the\nballot, and said, well, that should also apply -- this\nCourt said that should also apply in a primary context\nwhere there are multiple people seeking to -- to attain\na nomination.\nNow, should it matter because here the\nprimary or the election -- it's really an election but\nthe State happens to call it a primary -- should it\nmatter that that is in the preliminary stage, in the\nnomination stage?\nI would suggest it should not.\nNow, I think your --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it's still the case\nthat at the end of the day, the nub of your claim is\nthat the intending judicial candidate cannot effectively\npolitic, does not have a reasonable chance of getting\nselected; and I don't see that as a -- as a direct\nballot access claim.\nLet me put the question in another way:\nYour -- your friend on the other side, Mr. Rossman, in\nresponse to a question, said that if this election of\nthe judicial candidate for the party were made directly\nby the political bosses, whatever their titles are, the\nones who are supposedly in control here, he would not\nsee any constitutional objection to that.\nWhat if New York had a system that provided\nprecisely for that? The political bosses, as I\nunderstand it, get elected every 2 years and the State\nlaw would provide that those party bosses, whatever\ntheir title is, would in fact select the candidate.\nWould that be unconstitutional?\nMR. SCHWARZ: I think I would like to draw a\ndistinction between the law as I think you've described\nit and a different law that Justice Scalia described. I\nthink the law that Justice Scalia described would be\nconstitutional. If what the State did is to say, you\nthe party decide on what to do, I think the State is\nthen not putting a thumb on the scale; the State is not\ninterfering with the disputes within the party.\nHowever, on the statute that I think you\ndescribed, Justice Souter, where the State says, we\ndecree that for every party the leader shall make the\ndecision, I think that would be unconstitutional because\nthe State has no business intervening in the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the party isn't\nobjecting.\nMR. SCHWARZ: Well, Your Honor, I think\nthat's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The party -- the party\nlikes it.\nMR. SCHWARZ: I'm sure the party likes it.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And you are the -- the\nclaim here: These people are not, as I understand it,\nbringing a case on behalf of rights of the party.\nThey're bringing a case based on a premise of a\nprinciple of participation, which is theirs.\nAnd that's why, it seems to me, that the\nhypo that I posed is not significantly different,\nprovided the parties aren't objecting, in which we have\na different case.\nBut it seems to me that my hypo is not\nsignificantly different from the one that gave rise to\nthe question that Mr. Rossman answered.\nMR. SCHWARZ: Well, the -- first, on the\nconsent of the party leaders, which is really what we\nhave here, of course they are -- they like the system\nbecause the State system entrenches them.\nAnd -- and this Court --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the Federal system in\npractice entrenches United States Senators.\nI'm -- I'm not sure that, in terms of\npolitical participation on the part of an intending or\nan aspiring judge that the system that I suggested in\nthe hypo, in which the party bosses select the nominee,\nis for constitutional purposes significantly different\nfrom the Federal system for -- for picking district\njudges.\nMR. SCHWARZ: Well, because the Federal\nsystem provides that there shall not be elections. Here\nelections --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Sure. And in my hypo the\nonly election is the election for the party boss.\nMR. SCHWARZ: Well, I would still suggest,\nYour Honor, that, as we see the case that would be\nunconstitutional. But our case is much stronger than\nthat because, in any event, there is here an election\nfor delegates.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But isn't your\nargument still that, because there is a limitation on\nthe participation of the intending judicial candidate,\nthere is ultimately a constitutional problem?\nSo let me pose a different question to you,\nand this one is not hypothetical. The nub of your case\nis that the political bosses in effect are controlling\nthe process because they tell the delegates who to vote\nfor. Does your -- does the intending judicial nominee\nwhom you represent have any difficulty in getting to the\npolitical bosses and saying: I want you to consider me?\nMR. SCHWARZ: Yes. They would not listen to\nher, and they said: We won't listen to you in this\nparticular case; we won't listen to you because you\ndeclined to hire an unqualified person as your law\nclerk.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Sure. They -- for\npolitical reasons, they're saying: We don't like you.\nThere are -- there are a lot of people who go to United\nStates Senators, and the United States Senators say:\nScram; we don't -- we don't like you; your politics\naren't good enough for us.\nAnd so I'm not saying that -- that -- on my\nhypo the person who lobbies the bosses directly is --is\nclaiming a right to success. I think they're claiming a\nright to have a chance to influence the process. And\nwhy don't they have the chance by going to the boss?\nMR. SCHWARZ: Well, Your Honor, let me try\ntwo things. First, that never has worked. And it -- it\nhas to be -- at least using the Storer analysis of what\nactually happens, the fact that never in the history of\nNew York, not in the Republican Party, not in the\nDemocratic Party, not in New York City, not in upstate,\nnever has someone who was opposed by the party boss been\nable to become a judge.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And I don't know of\nany enemy of a United States -- go ahead.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The person wouldn't be\nopposed if he approached the boss and the boss said:\nYeah. Boy, I really like you. That person would\nautomatically not be a rebel. He'd be part of the\nestablishment.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SCHWARZ: But the -- you know, this\nisn't an issue that divides by ideology. It's --\nreally, the question here is if you have a statute that\nmakes it difficult for the voters to participate, to\nhave a voice. That's really the question. And if I\ncould use something that the Board of Elections' brief\nconceded in both their reply and their opening brief,\nthey said a person -- they said that party members who\nwanted to attempt to assemble a slate to try to\ninfluence the decision at the convention would be \"well\nserved\" -- that's their exact words -- to assemble and\nrun a slate. But the district court and the circuit\ncourt found that it was impossible -- severely\nburdensome, actually impossible -- for that burden to be\nmet.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this\nquestion, Mr. Schwarz. Supposing that the statute did\nnot contain the delegate-selection process and instead,\nsaid: Delegates shall be selected by the county\nchairman in each county and by the organization. Would\nit then be unconstitutional?\nMR. SCHWARZ: If it said delegates will be\nselected --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: By party officials.\nMR. SCHWARZ: I'm not sure about that. I'm\nnot -- I think that -- I'm not sure. I think it's\ndifferent than Justice Souter's hypothetical.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm just saying just\neliminate this whole folderol about picking delegates\nand say the county chairman shall pick the delegates,\nperiod. I don't see why that would be unconstitutional.\nMR. SCHWARZ: I'm not sure I have a position\non that one way or the other. What I do say, though, is\nthis Court in your Minnesota Republican Party v. White\ndecision said it makes -- and, you know, the question of\nwhether judges should be elected or appointed is a\ncontroversial question. But this Court in that decision\nsaid that if you're going to have an election -- and\nhere we have elections for delegates -- if you're going\nto have an election, you shouldn't structure that\nelection in a way that makes it in that case extremely\ndifficult or impossible or forbidden --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Schwarz, you're\ntalking about the election of the judge or the election\nof the delegate? I think you're mixing two oranges and\napples there.\nMR. SCHWARZ: Well, the -- I do believe that\nthe election of the delegates raises the constitutional\nquestions about has the State put its thumb on the\nscale, has the State done something that severely\nburdens the voters.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It -- the evidence shows\nthe thumb on the scale is just as strong as if the party\nchairman picked the delegates. And, therefore, it seems\nto me, it presents the question of whether it would be\nunconstitutional to enact a statute that allows the\nparty chairman to pick the delegates.\nMR. SCHWARZ: I'm not sure, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, if you're not sure,\nit's difficult --\nJuSTICE KENNEDY: If I could interrupt,\nJustice Breyer, for just a moment. But in the Minnesota\ncase the thumb on the scale was to deprive the\nconstituents of a First Amendment right. Smith v.\nAllwright, it was a right not to be discriminated\nagainst race. Here what we're asking is: What is the\nsubstantive right?\nMR. SCHWARZ: Well, I think here it is the\nright not to be burdened, severely burdened, in an\nelection. And that just runs through all your cases --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but what you are\ncalling -- and correct me if I am wrong. Maybe I\nmisunderstand this. I think what you are calling the\nsevere burden is the difficulty of assembling a whole\nslate that can control the meeting or have a majority in\nthe ultimate meeting of that delegate, of those\ndelegates, and therefore actually select the candidate\nwho wants to put the slate together. And it's control\nover result rather than the capacity of any individual\nto get elected a delegate which I think you are\nobjecting to. Am I wrong?\nMR. SCHWARZ: We have never said that\nthere's a right to win. We have only said there's a\nright to meaningfully participate.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but when you say\n\"meaningfully participate\" you talk about putting -- and\ncandidly talk about putting -- a slate of delegates\ntogether.\nIf I put a slate of delegates together, it\nis because once those delegates are selected they're\ngoing to support me; and that's why it -- I think your\nreal argument is not that somebody has difficulty\nbecoming a candidate for a delegate or even getting\nelected one. The difficulty that you're claiming is\nthat it's hard for the intending judicial candidate to\nassemble a large enough group of people to give that\ncandidate success once the delegates are elected. It's\na success argument that you are making, not an access\nargument.\nMR. SCHWARZ: No. It's a compete argument,\nnot an access argument. And I do think the Constitution\nshould be read to say that if the State passes laws that\nmake it very hard for voters to band together or for\ninsurgent candidates to compete, then -- and it is a\nsevere burden, they have to justify it. And, by the\nway, they haven't sought in their papers to justify it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Could a State decide it\ndoesn't want candidates to have any part in this\ndelegate-selection process? It thinks it's unseemly to\nhave would-be judges engage in that kind of activity.\nSo it structures the system that says that they choose\ndelegates for a convention, but we don't want those\ndelegates to be the delegates of any particular\ncandidate. We want to insulate this process from\nwould-be candidate influence. Would that be\nunconstitutional?\nMR. SCHWARZ: The problem is that in the\nreal world the statutes work to entrench the power of\nthe party leaders and to prevent voters from, to use the\nBoard of Elections' reply brief, I think, on page 5, to\nuse -- or 17, to use -- the voters are not able to band\ntogether to try and influence the results at the\nconventions.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course not. You're\nreally arguing against the whole purpose this scheme,\nwhich is not to have judges popularly elected. And\nyou're saying no, we want them popularly elected. The\npurpose of the scheme is to -- is to have the people\nelect delegates and have delegates use their good\njudgments as to who -- as to who the best judge would\nbe. But you say, no, we want the people to have an\ninput. I mean, it's contrary to the whole purpose of\nthe scheme. Of course it works the way you say it does.\nIt is designed to work that way. It's a basic judgment\nnot to have judges popularly elected, and your objection\namounts to saying no, judges ought to be popularly\nelected.\nMR. SCHWARZ: We -- we have no problem with\nthe convention, but we don't think that the -- either\nthe insurgent candidate or the band of voters who wish\nto support that person should be, by the State, fenced\nout, severely burdened from attempting to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's all right,\nI take it, if they don't prevail? For example --\nMR. SCHWARZ: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the other side\nsays that your argument is -- is implicated whenever a\nconvention leads to a different nominee than the\nprimary.\nMR. SCHWARZ: No, that's -- that's not --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't think\nthere's anything wrong with the convention deciding that\nthe nominee is going to be someone other than the person\nwho would prevail in the primary election.\nMR. SCHWARZ: There is nothing wrong with\nthat, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's all right to\nfence them out to that extent?\nMR. SCHWARZ: If you want -- if we want to\ncall that fencing. I don't call that fencing. That's\nthe -- if the convention is one that is put together\nwithout the State burdening the ability for people to\nget involved --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I take it, in\nevaluating the burden, we should look at how difficult\nit is for someone to be elected a delegate.\nMR. SCHWARZ: I think you should also look\nat the -- since the party leaders run slates and they\nhave no difficulty in running slates because -- for\nvarious reasons that the courts found, I think you\nshould look at the question of slates as well as\nindividual delegates. And in considering individual\ndelegates, I do think that Mr. Dunne's amicus brief\nwhich describes, on his page 19, indicates that, you\nknow, it's -- it's a little unrealistic to think that\nanybody other than --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, is that\nbecause Mr. Dunne was not supported by the party members\nat the convention --\nMR. SCHWARZ: No, he wasn't --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- for whatever\nhigher office --\nMR. SCHWARZ: He wasn't trying to be a\njudge, Your Honor. He -- he speaks about his desire to\nbe a delegate and his being told that, you're not\nsufficiently reliable; we're not going to let you be a\ndelegate.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What did he have to\ndo to become on the ballot for delegate?\nMR. SCHWARZ: If he wanted to be a single\nperson running -- appearing as a gadfly --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 500 signatures,\nright?\nMR. SCHWARZ: He needs the 500 signatures.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If we don't think\nthat's a sufficient burden, do you lose?\nMR. SCHWARZ: I think we have a difficult\ncase, if you don't think that's sufficient burden. If\nyou think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the State -- the trial\ncourt didn't find that that was a burden.\nMR. SCHWARZ: No, I -- I'm not -- I'm\nagreeing with the Chief Justice that I think that, if\nyou thought that just running for one delegate slot was\nsufficient to solve the problem of a State statute that\nwas designed -- their words, their admission -- to\nentrench the power of the party leaders, I think that\ngives us a problem.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why? I mean I don't see\nhow you avoid answering Justice Stevens's hypothetical?\nThe reason I think you have to answer it is because the\nNew York system is the system he described in the\nhypothetical, with a safety valve.\nMR. SCHWARZ: The safety valve being?\nJUSTICE BREYER: The safety valve being that\nthe party leaders cannot just choose anybody. I mean,\nif it looks they're going to choose something really\nnutty, then there will be opposition to these delegates\nand something will happen.\nMR. SCHWARZ: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So they have leeway, but\nyou can't go too far.\nMR. SCHWARZ: The record, Your Honor, and\nthis is an extensive record, shows that the party\nleaders can choose and do choose people who are, to use\nyour word, who are --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You don't like that.\nThat's why I say you have to answer it. If you feel\nthat that's so terrible, then you say no, the\nConstitution forbids that, though you'd have to explain,\nwouldn't you, why, with all its faults, that is not\nbetter in the judgment of New York than a system where\npeople raise $4 million from the lawyers in order to run\nfor office?\nMR. SCHWARZ: We -- no, we -- we have not\nsaid that there needs to be a primary. We haven't said\nthat. And sometimes our opponents leave the impression\nthat we have said that. We haven't said that.\nYou know, there are -- get rid of the\nleaders --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's the -- that's the\nremedy that, the temporary remedy, that you sought was\n-- at the bottom line, the court's order was, until New\nYork reacts to this decision, the candidates will be\nchosen by primary.\nMR. SCHWARZ: Yes, the -- but the judge,\nYour Honor -- the judge did two things in imposing that\nremedy, three or four things actually:\nHe said, first, I'm not going to\nmicromanage. I think the statutes are unconstitutional.\nI'm not going to get into all the details of fixing it\nbecause the Legislature should do that and the Federal\ncourts shouldn't do that.\nSecond, he relied on the fact that the\nfall-back position in the State statutes is there is a\nprimary if there is no other system in place.\nBut, third and most important, he stayed his\ndecision to give the Legislature time to address the\nquestion, and they were well on their way to addressing\nit when this Court gave us the opportunity to be here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you agree it's\nnot realistic that one way they would address it is by\nhaving an entirely appointed system?\nMR. SCHWARZ: No, they -- they're entitled\nto do that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know they are\nentitled to it.\nMR. SCHWARZ: Well, the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: As a practical\nmatter, is that a realistic option in New York?\nMR. SCHWARZ: If you look at the amicus\nbriefs filed in our favor, the State bar, the City bar,\nthe Fund for the Modern Courts, the City of New York all\nfiled a brief in which they say, we think the right\nsolution is to have an appointive system, and they're\nworking to try to have that happen. And the governor\nhas put forward a bill for an appointive system. But,\nthey say --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm sure he\nhas. I mean that's in his interest.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SCHWARZ: No, not --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought I read a\nrepresentation somewhere in the briefs that it's\nunrealistic to expect that New York would move to an\nentirely appointive system. So that the options, if\nyou're successful, the options will either be direct\nelection of judges or a pure convention with no role for\nthe voters at all.\nMR. SCHWARZ: No, it could be a role for the\nvoters that does not burden them in the way this statute\nburdens them.\nAnd the -- that brief by the State bar and\nthe Bar of the Association of the City of New York and\nthe other groups who are strongly in favor of an\nappointive system, say to this Court, this is the worst\nof all worlds. And it -- this system, as also the\namicus brief from the former judges who were responsible\nfor appellate judges responsible for administering the\nNew York State system, says that this system has\nundermined judicial independence and undermined\nconfidence in the courts.\nAnd that is -- you know -- that is clearly\ncorrect --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There's also one view, I\nthink it was, in the Feerick Report that said, the worst\nthing in the world would be to return us to the primary\nsystem this system was intended to replace.\nMR. SCHWARZ: Yes, the -- actually the\nFeerick report, which found that the party leaders all\nover State however have always made the picks, they\nvoiced a favoring amending the law. They -- they think\nthe law needs to be amended.\nAnd Chief Judge Kaye, in her remarks after\nthe decisions came down and after the Feerick Commission\nreport came out, said the problems that had been\nrevealed in this case are pervasive both systemically\nand geographically.\nThe Feerick Commission's view is that,\nunless there's public financing, in which case they'd\nfavor some more involvement by the voters, is simply\namend the portions of the law that make it so burdensome\non competitors, on voters.\nWe're -- we're neutral. We just say this\nlaw is unconstitutional. And how it should be amended\nis up to the Legislature, but that it should be amended\nis -- there's a powerful case and, you know, I don't\nknow where I am on the time here, but I commend to you\nthe various amicus briefs that have come in on --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They're all policy\narguments about why this is a terrible statute. They're\nnot necessarily constitutional arguments.\nMR. SCHWARZ: No, they also speak --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And that's a vast\ndifference.\nMR. SCHWARZ: -- speak about the\nConstitution, and, indeed, it's not very often that you\nfind, on a constitutional issue, both the Washington\nLegal Foundation and the ACLU coming in, as they have\ncome in, to assert that this is an unconstitutional\nstatute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's not often\nyou have both the Democratic Party and the Republican\nParty --\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- supporting it\neither.\nMR. SCHWARZ: Yes, but then I -- I think you\nshould look at the -- what you've said in -- not you,\nbut your predecessor said in Eu, about we've never held\nthat a political party's consent will cure a statute\nthat otherwise is violative and, there are other quotes\nin Justice Scalia's Tashjian opinion and in -- in\nseveral other cases to that effect.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Schwarz.\nMR. SCHWARZ: Thank you.\nMr. Olson, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS NEW YORK STATE\nBOARD OF ELECTIONS ET AL.\nMR. OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nThe Second Circuit reinstalled what the New\nYork Legislature found to be a bad system, that it\ndiscouraged qualified candidates and it encouraged this\nunfortunate, unseemly race for money.\nThe Respondents just said that that is not\nwhat they were interested in doing, but their prayer for\ntheir relief, on page 35 of their complaint, calls for a\ndirect primary election for the Supreme Court.\nWith respect to the Kusper case,\nJustice Kennedy, I gave that a little bit more thought.\nThat -- that case focused on the fact that the statute\nwas inhibiting the rights of an individual who wanted to\nparticipate in a way that the party wanted that\nindividual to participate. That long period of time\nprevented both the individual and the association from\nassociating together, which is why --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You say the State, your\nmean the State statute?\nMR. OLSON: Yes. But -- and to the extent\nthat it was -- it was -- part of that is answered by\nyour Clingman case which just came relatively recently,\nwhere the party wanted independents to vote in the\nprimary and the Supreme Court -- this Court said that\nthe State had to let that happen. With respect to time\nperiods between when you had to identify yourself as a\nparty member this court held in the Rosario case that a\ncertain length of time is appropriate under the system.\nWith respect to Mr. Dunne, we've heard about\nhim. He may have had a desire to be a delegate but he\nnever tried to get the 500 signatures. It says that\nright on his -- on page 19 of his brief -- the brief\nthat my colleague was quoting.\nWith respect to the questions that I think\nboth Justice Stevens and Justice Souter were asking,\ncould the State lodge the candidate selection or the\ndelegate selection process in the party leaders, I can't\nconceive of how that would be unconstitutional.\nIf the parties wanted to select the\ndelegates or select the candidates to be their standard\nbearers, that seems to me to be perfectly within the\nright of an association to do; and would be perfectly\nappropriate, provided that there was an access for\nindependents and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're not saying the State\ncould compel that?\nMR. OLSON: No. No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying that the\nState could permit it?\nMR. OLSON: No. But I think those\nhypothetical questions are could the State vest that\nauthority.\nFinally I think it's important to say -- oh,\none more preliminary point. It is competitive in New\nYork. It may not be perfectly competitive, as is the\ncase of 90 percent of the congressional districts in\nthis country, which are said not to be competitive. But\nin New York, six sitting judges testified in -- in -- in\nthe lower court that they successfully lobbied delegates\nto, you know, to be candidates. So that happens.\nBetween 1900 and 2002, this is appendix 130,\nnearly one fourth of the general elections in New York\nwere competitive.\nLopez Torres, the Respondent, received 25\nvotes at the 2002 judicial selection convention, and\nmany of the districts in New York are not dominated by a\nsingle party.\nSo the final point is it is important to\nemphasize this is a -- a challenge on its face to the\nstatute that simply creates a delegate election and it\nthen creates a convention. Neither of those provisions\ncan possibly be constitutional, and so what the\nRespondents are complaining about is what party bosses\ndo.\nBut on page 38 of their brief, they state\ncategorically that the constitutional offense is not the\nfact that party leaders act as one would expect in\nchoosing nominees.\nIn other words, they act -- party leaders act like party\nleaders and exercise their influence. They're not\nsaying that that's unconstitutional. What they're\nsaying is that a statute that allows party leaders to be\nparty leaders, to be constitutional, to act in ways\nwhich are not only permissible under the Constitution as\nthey knowledge, but constitutionally protected, is\nsomehow constitutional. That simply is not consistent\nwith any of this Court's jurisprudence, which says that\npolitical parties must have the maximum opportunity to\nselect their leadership.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you Mr. Olson.\n"
