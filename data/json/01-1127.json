        "content": "(11:10 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in Number 01-1127, Bill Lockyer v. Leandro Andrade.\nMr. Danzig.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS P. DANZIG\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DANZIG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Ninth Circuit's grant of habeas relief in\nthis case should be reversed for two reasons. First, the\ncourt erred in setting aside the State court judgment\nbecause it did not properly apply the principles of habeas\ncorpus review to cases that are considered under the\nAEDPA.\nthis Court yesterday, Early v. Hill and Woodford v.\nVisciotti, this case is resolvable on AEDPA grounds and\ntherefore the Court need not address the constitutional\nissues in this case.\nIn any event, independent of the habeas corpus\naspects of this case, the sentence in this case is not\ngrossly disproportionate and therefore does not violate\nthis -- the Eighth Amendment.\nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2254(d), a Federal court\nmay not grant habeas relief unless the State court\ndetermination on the merits was either contrary to, or\ninvolved an unreasonable application of this Court's clear\ncontrolling precedent. In this case, the Ninth Circuit\nheld that the State court determination involved an\nunreasonable application. Despite the Ninth --\nQUESTION: Is this the case in which the Ninth\nCircuit first decided for itself the constitutional\nquestion, and then decided whether the State court had\nreasonably applied it?\nMR. DANZIG: Yes, that is correct, Your Honor.\nDespite the Ninth Circuit's holding in this\ncase, a careful analysis of the Ninth Circuit's opinion\nhere reveals that although they reversed, or granted\nhabeas relief, reversing the district court on\nunreasonable application grounds, the fact of the matter\nis this, all of the reasoning lends itself to a contrary-\nto analysis rather than an unreasonable application, and\nopposing, or the respondent has, in fact briefed the\ncontrary-to prong of the 2254 as well as the unreasonable\napplication prong.\nFor example, the -- and for the most part the\ncircuit court held that holding was based on the\nconclusion that the State court merits determination erred\nbecause it did not consider the three-case triumvirate of\nRummel, Solem, and Harmelin, and faulted the State court\nfor failing to apply, or essentially disregarding Solem,\nbut as Early v. Packer made clear yesterday, on -- when we\nare talking about a contrary-to application, it's not\nnecessary for the State court to have cited this Court's\ncontrolling authority, and it's not even necessary for the\nCourt to be aware of it, and in fact the State court in\nthis case cited, or provided what we call a Lynch analysis\nunder California law, which incorporated virtually every\naspect of the Solem analysis that the State court said --\npardon me, that the Ninth Circuit said the State court\ndisregarded.\nSo on that basis alone, and I think Early\nmakes -- the per curiam opinion in Early makes clear that\nthat's okay if you have an application of State law, or\nyou rely on State law that provides even greater depth of\nanalysis than the Federal rule would require, and that's\nwhat happened here. The Lynch analysis requires what\nwould be comparable to the second and third prongs under\nthe Solem analysis, which, following Harmelin, are deemed\nno longer required unless -- and serve only to validate an\ninitial inference on the first prong, so this was clearly\nnot a contrary-to case. The court -- the State court --\nQUESTION: May I just ask on that point, do you\nthink there was not even the need to look at the second or\nthird elements of the test because there is not even a\nbasis for saying this sentence was grossly\ndisproportionate?\nMR. DANZIG: Yes, Justice Stevens, I agree with\nthat. I think that there is no inference --\nQUESTION: In other words, the case could be\ndecided on the ground that there's -- an inference of\ngross disproportionality should not be drawn in this case?\nMR. DANZIG: That's correct, Your Honor, I do\nagree with that, and on the Eighth Amendment, the pure\nEighth Amendment question, that there was no inference of\ngross disproportionality here, and therefore the second\nand third prongs were not required, but the State court\ndid, in fact, apply a second and third prong analysis, and\nthat leads into the only portion of the Ninth Circuit's\nopinion that really addresses the reasonableness of the\nState court's decision.\nThe Ninth Circuit disposed of the unreasonable\napplication analysis in a footnote, and it basically said\nthat the State court's reliance on State law is irrelevant\nbecause it didn't cite Federal law, and I think that the\ndecision yesterday in Early v. Hill kind of renders that\nparticular portion of the analysis --\nQUESTION: Would you just refresh my\nrecollection on the facts of this case, because the prior\nargument, the argument was made that violence was the\ncritical matter in the prior conviction. Were there\nviolence in the earlier, in the priors in this case?\nMR. DANZIG: The record does not indicate\nwhether there were or not, Your Honor. The priors that\nwere the predicate for the three strikes sentence were\nboth residential burglaries, and there -- we have no facts\nconcerning them in the record, but the gravamen, as we all\nknow, of a residential burglary is the potential for\ndanger and violence that comes from invading someone's\nhome, and also subsequent to this case being decided quite\nrecently, the California legislature amended its statute\nand now includes a residential burglary where the house is\noccupied in its articulation of violent felonies. It's no\nlonger just confined to the serious felony --\nQUESTION:\nthe prior case that violence is a critical element in the\npriors or not?\nMR. DANZIG: No, I do not, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. DANZIG: Not to be overly inconsistent\nbetween our mutual arguments, but I think this Court has\nheld that the presence or absence of violence does not\nnecessarily dictate the proportionality analysis. There\nmay be circumstances where a crime is of sufficient\ngravity that doesn't involve violence, such that extremely\nlong sentences are appropriate.\nQUESTION: I agree on the merits that we can't\nconvert this Court into a sentencing commission, but it's\nalso true, I guess, that there must be some way of\ndeciding when a State has gone too far, and I don't know\nany way that's other than highly subjective, except to\nlook at data that would show what happened in the past,\nbut if you take that, how do you give the State the right\nto become harsher in the future?\nNow, you're going to say, well, it has that\nright, and of course it does to a degree, but is there a\nway to say that it has to meet some burden, or that it has\nto show something if it's going to change dramatically\nwhat was the consensus in the past --\nMR. DANZIG:\nQUESTION: -- in a harsh direction?\nMR. DANZIG: I don't think that the fact that\nit's going to change dramatically is determinative or\ndispositive, but I do think, Justice Breyer, that there\nare a couple of responses to that question.\nFirst of all, turning back to one of the\nquestions Justice Souter asked in the prior argument, I\nbelieve that when the State is going to define certain\nfelonies as being sufficiently serious to trigger the\nimposition of the three strikes, or three strikes approach\nor harsher sentencing, I think a rational basis -- the\ncourts may be required to engage in a heightened scrutiny\nanalysis to determine whether there's a rational basis for\nthat in the first place.\nBut I think that's distinct from any\nproportionality analysis, and the problem with the\nhypothetical that you pose is that, while you are correct\nthat there is a subjective prong to this, the question is,\nwhere does that subjectivity belong? Is it within the\nparticular personal subjective views of the reviewing\ncourt, or is it within the confines of the subjective\nviews as reflect -- that the legislature represents of the\nsubjective views of the citizenry?\nQUESTION: It has to be the latter, but still\nthere has to be a way of deciding when they go too far.\nMR. DANZIG: In other words --\nQUESTION: And that's what I'm looking for, and\nI look to -- you know, what I've said before as a way of\nisolating the problem, and then -- and I think here you\nmight say that on the merits of your case, it'll -- you'd\nbe hard-pressed to find many examples outside of the three\nstrikes laws where there were such sentences given for\nsuch things.\nMR. DANZIG: I --\nQUESTION: I think so. I mean, there are a\nhandful in the SG's brief, that's true.\nMR. DANZIG: I understand your question, Justice\nBreyer, to basically go to what is grossly\ndisproportionate.\nQUESTION: That's right.\nMR. DANZIG: And the Court, this Court has not\ndefined that term, or given us any clear guidelines, but\nwe do know that by the very nature, grossly\ndisproportionate implies an extreme situation, and --\nQUESTION: Suppose we were to find -- and\nthere's argument in this about the briefs both ways, but\nsuppose we were to conclude that this has likely been a\nmost effective scheme, that it's reduced the crime rate in\nthe State of California. The prisoners talk about it all\nthe time. They know what three strikes means. It's a\nsimple thing that they can understand, and that it works.\nIf we made that finding, and there -- your\nadversaries will disagree that that's true, but if we made\nthat finding, does that bear on whether the sentence is\ndisproportionate?\nMR. DANZIG: Not really, because I suppose -- I\nmean, in an extreme example, Justice Kennedy, we could\nlock up everybody for extremely long periods of time, and\nit could still go past that point of proportion, of gross\ndisproportionality. I think there has to be a more clear\ndefinition than simply the impact of the sentencing\nstatute, and --\nQUESTION: Well, what's your limiting principle\nhere?\nMR. DANZIG: The limiting --\nQUESTION: Is there one?\nMR. DANZIG: The limiting principle we offer is,\nor we urge upon the Court is the one that's been mentioned\nin a -- or has been used as related to an example\nmentioned in a couple of the Court's opinions, when they\nrefer to lifetime for parking, and the reasonable mean --\nunderstanding of that example is often cited as a life\nsentence for a first-time parking --\nQUESTION: But that --\nQUESTION:\nprinciple? I haven't heard it.\nMR. DANZIG: The limiting principle would be\nthat those are, that sentences are grossly\ndisproportionate when they are not reasonably susceptible\nto debate amongst reasonable minds.\nQUESTION: But --\nQUESTION: You seem to be --\nQUESTION: -- in this particular case it's 50\nyears for stealing some tapes, right?\nMR. DANZIG: No, Your Honor, I -- Justice\nStevens, I disagree with that. It is not a 50-year\nsentence for stealing tapes, it is two 25-years-to-life\nsentences.\nQUESTION: But they're consecutive.\nMR. DANZIG: They are consecutive.\nQUESTION: Well, why isn't that 50?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DANZIG: Because I think it's important to\nbear in mind two things in reaching that conclusion.\nFirst of all, they represent independent episodes of\ncriminal behavior. They are not connected. They may have\nthe impact of resulting in a 50-year sentence, but it --\nbut they do reflect the fact that the -- Mr. Andrade in\nthis case demonstrated beyond any question that he is a\nhabitual offender.\nreleased, or booked and released and 2 weeks later he went\nright back out and did the same thing.\nNot only that, he told the probation officer\nthat he stole the tapes in order to sell them to buy\nheroin, not as gifts for his children, but to buy heroin\nwith. He also indicated he was a hopeless heroin addict,\nand that he always does something stupid when released\nfrom prison, and I think the reasonable inference of what\nhe meant was, he always goes out and recommits crimes, so\nI think that's part of why it's not a 50-year --\nQUESTION: Well, is he being punished because\nhe's a heroin addict or because he stole these tapes?\nMR. DANZIG: He's being punished because of his,\nof a combination of his record of recidivism and his -- or\nhis habitual criminal behavior.\nThe other reason I think it's important to make\nthe distinction between the two 25-to-life sentences\nversus characterizing it as 50-to-life for receiving, or\nfor stealing some tapes is because of the ameliorative\neffects of the California sentencing structure.\nQUESTION: But in light of the answer that you\ngave to my question, and then to Justice O'Connor's about\nwhat is the standard, I'm now at somewhat a loss as to how\nto defend your statute under the incapacitation and\ndeterrence theory.\nThat's quite a surprising answer to me. I thought the\nwhole point of this statute was that we wanted something\nthat works.\nMR. DANZIG: And I agree, Your Honor, and if I\nmisstated that, I did not mean to. I think that the --\nQUESTION: Then proportionality has to be judged\nagainst the legislative objective, I should think.\nMR. DANZIG: Absolutely, Justice Kennedy.\nQUESTION: Well, then, then the question that I\nput to you does bear on proportionality. The premise I\nput to you does bear on proportionality, that we need a\nsystem that's simple but works, that reduces crime in the\nState, and you told me, oh, well, that means we could lock\nup everything, everybody so you can't use that.\nMR. DANZIG: No, I did not mean --\nQUESTION: But we don't lock up everybody.\nThat's not the three strikes statute.\nMR. DANZIG: I did not mean to imply that it\ndoesn't bear on proportionality, I certainly believe that\nit does. I simply said that standing alone, without any\nfurther consideration, that would also justify an extreme\nexample, but yes, I do believe that it does bear on\nproportionality in light of the legislative purpose of the\nstatute, but in measuring that legislative purpose, I do\nbelieve that what's reasonable -- sentences, evaluating\nsentences on whether they are reasonably susceptible to\ndebate also provides a framework or a lens with which to\nlook, to apply that analysis.\nQUESTION: Mr. Danzig --\nQUESTION: Okay, but if we do that --\nQUESTION: -- if we can just back up, I think\nyou started out by urging that we not do what the Ninth\nCircuit did in terms of the order. It first made a ruling\nthat there was a violation of the Eighth Amendment, and\nthen it determined whether we had clearly established law.\nMR. DANZIG: That's correct.\nQUESTION: You are urging that we not reach any\nultimate decision on the Eighth Amendment question, but\nsimply decide that however you come out on that, the --\nthere was no violation of clearly established Federal law.\nMR. DANZIG: Not exactly, Justice Ginsburg. We\nare saying that the case is disposable on AEDPA grounds,\nbut if the Court found that the State court merits\ndetermination was unreasonable, it necessarily would have\nto turn to the Eighth Amendment issue.\nQUESTION: Yes, but which -- the Ninth Circuit\nsaid it's appropriate in these cases to decide the Eighth\nAmendment question first. What is your view on that?\nShould we follow in line with what the Ninth Circuit did,\nor should we say the proper thing to do is to find out\nwhether it's an unreasonable interpretation of clearly\nestablished Federal law, and if it isn't, that's the end\nof it?\nMR. DANZIG: The latter, Justice Ginsburg. The\nmethodology that the Ninth Circuit has developed as\narticulated in Van Tran is inconsistent with the very\nspirit of the AEDPA.\nQUESTION: Well, it's also inconsistent with our\nidea that we try to avoid constitutional questions if we\ncan, isn't it?\nMR. DANZIG: Yes, it is, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: But you said earlier that you thought\nthe proper analysis was contrary to, rather than\nunreasonable application, and how can you decide whether\nsomething's contrary to a rule unless you know what the\nrule is?\nMR. DANZIG: I would like to clarify that,\nJustice Stevens. I didn't say that the proper analysis in\nthis case was contrary to. I said that the Ninth Circuit\npurported to reach an unreasonable application prong, but\nwhen you look at their reasoning, it actually is a\ncontrary-to argument that they made, and I meant to say\nthat when -- if -- to the extent that it is a contrary-to\ndecision that they made, no matter the fact that they\nultimately labeled it unreasonable application, this\nCourt's per curiam decision yesterday in Early v. Packer\nhas essentially resolved that question, because of what\nthey base their decision on.\nQUESTION: I'm not sure you've answered my\nquestion. It seems to me that we have to decide whether\nor not -- regardless of what the Ninth Circuit did, I\nthink one of the things we have to decide is whether or\nnot the sentence in this case is contrary to a Federal\nrule, and I don't know how we can decide that without\nknowing what the Federal rule is, and I was asking for\nyour advice on that point.\nMR. DANZIG: The Federal rule I think is\narticulated in Harmelin, and that is that grossly\ndisproportionate sentences violate the Eighth Amendment.\nQUESTION: But we have to identify that as the\nFederal rule before we go on to decide whether it's\ncontrary to, I think. Is that -- would you agree with\nthat?\nMR. DANZIG: Yes. You're -- I would.\nQUESTION: That seems just the opposite of what\nyou responded to me earlier, that we don't have to decide\nthe Eighth Amendment question, that we can just decide\nwhatever the answer to that is, this was not off the\nchart.\nMR. DANZIG:\nthat it's necessary to resolve the Eighth Amendment\nquestion, but it may be necessary to know what the rule is\nbefore we know whether the State court selected\nthe right rule or not --\nQUESTION: But if we know what the rule is --\nQUESTION: Well, precisely we have to ask\nwhether there is a Federal rule. We don't have to know\nwhat it is. The question is, is there a clearly\npronounced Federal rule.\nMR. DANZIG: Correct.\nQUESTION: And the answer to that may well be\nno.\nMR. DANZIG: In many circumstances it may be.\nQUESTION: In which case we have no occasion to\npronounce on what the Federal rule is.\nMR. DANZIG: Correct.\nQUESTION: All we have to say is that there is\nno clearly enunciated Federal rule here.\nQUESTION: Can I go back for a second to the\nmerits of this?\nMR. DANZIG: Yes.\nQUESTION: Because I -- we all have -- my\nproblem that I'm struggling with is, is there an objective\nstandard. You're absolutely right about what the problem\nis I'm having, and I tend to -- do look to this empirical\nstuff as a way of finding an objective standard, and if\nhere the empirical part suggests this is way out of line,\nI'm now faced with the question, well, can't the State\nmake a harsher system if it has a reason for doing it, and\nI think the answer to that question must be yes.\nBut then -- then I'd ask, very well, doesn't the\nState have to come up with some reason that's persuasive\nin this case that it makes a difference to extend the\nthree-strike thing with this kind of thing in mind, this\nkind of case in mind, to the wobblers?\nI mean, is there some punitive purpose in terms\nof incapacitation that's gained, of a significant kind, by\nincreasing the wobbler sentences by factors of, you know,\nmultiples of four or five or 10 or something, over what\nthey would have been before when committed by serious\ncriminals, and I guess the answer to that is, there's no\nindication, or is there?\nMR. DANZIG: The -- I think you can't -- that\nbegs the question. It cannot disassociate the wobbler\noffense that's at issue in this particular case from the\nrecidivism.\nQUESTION: No, no, I'm not. I'm only\nconsidering the class of recidivists, and I'm saying --\nlet's call them recidivist plus wobbler, all right. That\ngroup of people, recidivist plus wobbler, is getting an\nenormous increase in sentence over what was or is any\nother place, on average, and therefore I think, gee, maybe\nthis is really grossly disproportionate.\nMR. DANZIG: But it's a certain class of\nrecidivists. It's not just recidivists in general. It is\nthat class --\nQUESTION: No, that's right.\nMR. DANZIG: -- that's already demonstrated that\nthey are willing to commit the most serious and violent --\nQUESTION: That's right.\nMR. DANZIG: -- potentially violent types of\ncrimes, and has now indicated that they are also unwilling\nto remain law-abiding, and there comes a point at which\nthe State has a right to say, enough is enough.\nQUESTION: So jay-walking?\nMR. DANZIG: Well, I think that would probably\nreturn to the rational basis, the -- analysis.\nQUESTION: Fine. If jay-walking's not there,\nand this is, the wobblers, why can the wobblers be there,\nbut not the jay-walkers? That's what I'm -- that's what\nI'm thinking about here.\nMR. DANZIG: There is a distinction between the\nwobblers and the jay-walking. There's the obvious\ndistinction that there's a longstanding historical\ntradition between felonies and misdemeanors and\ninfractions. The infractions, the jay-walking doesn't\neven present, for the most part, a property or personal\nsafety issue.\nQUESTION: Well, does California fine people for\njay-walking?\nMR. DANZIG: There is, I believe, a code on the\nbooks that makes it an offense, or an infraction.\nQUESTION: Is it enforced at all?\nMR. DANZIG: I do not know the answer to that,\nYour Honor.\nQUESTION: Mr. Danzig --\nQUESTION: I don't understand why a parking\noffense wouldn't qualify if a man is on parole, and any\nbreach of parole is always emphasized as being\nparticularly bad, and one of the things he can't do is\nengage in parking in no-parking zones, and if he did that\nin breach of a parole, and he had nine prior cases, I\ndon't know why you couldn't impose your three-strike\npenalty on the overtime parker.\nMR. DANZIG: The -- if the California\nlegislature chose --\nQUESTION: It says, any violation -- it put it\nin as a wobbler, any violation of a parole condition by a\nperson who's on parole.\nMR. DANZIG:\nIt's a parole revocation issue.\nQUESTION: It would not, because the other, in\nthe other case they emphasized the fact he'd been on\nparole a number of times, what -- his violations were\nparole violations. Is the fact that whether or not it's a\nparole violation relevant to our inquiry at all?\nMR. DANZIG: It is in the sense that the Court\nhas held that when doing a proportionality analysis, his\nentire criminal picture can be taken into consideration.\nWe're not -- the Court is not required to confine the\nanalysis only to the predicate and triggering offenses, so\nin that sense it does -- it is an indication of continued\nhabitual criminality and an unwillingness to remain\nlaw-abiding.\nQUESTION: I think you're saying --\nQUESTION: Mr. Danzig, there is something\nmissing in this case that was present in the other. That\nis, the judge in the -- Mr. Ewing's case was asked to\nreduce the wobbler to a misdemeanor, was asked to strike a\nstrike and she said no, it's not within the spirit of the\nthree-strikes law.\nHere, the California Court of Appeals seemed\nalmost nonplussed that there had not been such requests\ntimely made to the trial judge, and twice the court of\nappeal said it would still be open to Mr. Andrade to\npursue on State habeas both pleas, that is, the wobbler\nshould be reduced to a misdemeanor, a strike should be\nout. Do you agree that that avenue of relief is open to\nMr. Andrade?\nMR. DANZIG: Yes, but it requires an\nexplanation, Your Honor. He -- Mr. Andrade did, in fact,\nask the court for misdemeanor treatment under California\nPenal Code section 17(b).\nQUESTION: He didn't repeat it at the time of\nsentencing.\nMR. DANZIG: No, he did not, Your Honor, but\nthere is an odd chronological history here that's just --\nthat distinguishes this case.\nThe California Court of Appeal, or -- pardon me.\nThe judgment came down in this case a few weeks before the\nCalifornia Supreme Court issued its decision in Romero\ngranting trial courts the discretion to dismiss priors, so\nin the California Court of Appeals decision, they noted\nthat that Romero decision had said that if you got a\nrecord that you can't determine whether the sentencing\njudge knew whether he had or not -- he or she had\ndiscretion to dismiss the strikes, then the proper basis\nfor addressing that is through State habeas.\nMr. Andrade then filed a petition for review to\nthe California supreme court which was denied, and without\nprejudice to file a State habeas corpus petition based on\nRomero, which he did. He went back to State court, filed\na habeas corpus petition -- pardon me. He did not file a\nState habeas corpus petition -- pardon me. He did file a\nState habeas corpus petition which was entertained by the\nsame sentencing court that had sentenced him, and that\ncourt said that it did not find that he was appropriate\ncandidate for dismissing the strikes.\nCuriously, though, that court also noted that if\nit felt that it read the law as having discretion to\nimpose concurrent rather than consecutive sentences, it\nmight consider it. That wasn't an issue at the time. It\nwas just kind of dicta within the court's, the sentencing\ncourt's decision.\nUltimately, though, about a year later, the\nCalifornia supreme court issued another case called People\nv. Garcia in which the supreme court said that sentencing\ncourts have a right to dismiss strikes on a count-by-\ncount basis, and Mr. Andrade has never asked by any\nvehicle for a reconsideration of that issue, so in theory\nhe could go back at this point and file another State\nhabeas corpus petition and ask for what we would call\nGarcia consideration, and -- which, based on what the\ncourt, the sentencing court had previously indicated, the\ncourt might be inclined to grant him, which would reduce\nthis sentence if, assuming it was applied to one of the\ncounts, to a 25-year-to-life sentence.\nQUESTION: Would you object to that relief?\nMR. DANZIG: We would not concede the issue,\nbut -- and I'm not saying that we would necessarily oppose\nit, but it is available to him. We'd have to consider our\nposition on that if and when it was -- he made that\napplication.\nQUESTION: Do you wish to reserve some time?\nMR. DANZIG: Yes, I do, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Very well. Thank you, Mr. Danzig.\nMR. DANZIG: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Mr. Chemerinsky, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN CHEMERINSKY\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nToday, the State of California asks this Court\nto disregard and essentially to overrule a century of\ndecisions that have held that grossly disproportionate\npenalties violate the Eighth Amendment. If any sentence\nis grossly disproportionate, it's that which was imposed\non Leandro Andrade.\nQUESTION: A century of decisions? I thought we\ndecided this since I've been on the Court.\nlonger than I thought, I guess.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: I'm sorry, Justice Scalia, I\ndidn't hear the question.\nQUESTION: You say there -- for a century we\nhave been engaged in proportionality analysis?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, Your Honor. In Weems v.\nUnited States in 1910, this Court said that sentences must\nbe graduated in proportion to the offense. Most recently,\nin Harmelin v. Michigan, seven Justices -- and Justice\nKennedy's opinion becomes the rule of Harmelin --\nprescribed a three-part test based on Solem v. Helm for\ndeciding if a sentence is cruel and unusual punishment.\nQUESTION: Mr. Chemerinsky --\nQUESTION: I don't think that's quite accurate,\nMr. Chemerinsky. I think if you were to take points,\ndecisional points, you would look at Rummel on one side,\nand then Solem moves away from that, and then Harmelin\nmoves back towards Rummel.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Chief Justice Rehnquist, each\nof the cases said it's consistent with all of the cases,\nand each of these cases cites to Weems v. United States as\nsaying that grossly disproportionate punishments violate\nthe Eighth Amendment.\nQUESTION:\ntrying to apply our cases when you take those three cases?\nI mean, it isn't a very obvious answer, is it?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, many State courts,\nand virtually every circuit has said that Justice\nKennedy's opinion from Harmelin becomes the rule of\nHarmelin, because in United States v. Marks it was the\nnarrowest ground that a majority agreed to, and of course\nJustice Kennedy's opinion is simply a modification of the\nthree-part Solem test.\nQUESTION: Well, it -- Justice -- I've just read\nit over, and it cites Rummel more often than it cites\nSolem.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: So the point that I think you need to\naddress is the AEDPA point. That is, is the supreme court\nof California way out of line, or whatever the test is,\nyou know, improperly applied --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: -- in the light of these cases.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, Your Honor. Under this\nCourt's decision in Williams v. Taylor, in Bell v. Cone\nand yes, in Early v. Packer, there are two ways in which a\nFederal court can grant habeas relief. One is to find\nthat it is contrary to clearly established Federal law.\nThe other is to find that it's an unreasonable application\nof clearly established Federal law. Both are present\nhere, and all --\nQUESTION: But one must find in either case\nclearly established Federal law, and frankly that's my\nproblem when you cite Weems. There are lots of grand\nstatements in our cases, but most of them come out\nrejecting the claim, and you cited Weems. That was an\nextraordinary case because it involved not simply hard\nlabor, but hard and painful labor. It was a kind of a\npenalty that was foreign to Anglo-American law, and if\nthat's the one example before we get to Solem, you really\ndon't have anything concrete to go on. You just have\ngrandly general statements.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, there are cases\nprior to Solem that found sentences to be cruel and\nunusual punishment. In Robinson v. California in 1962,\nfor example --\nQUESTION: That was a status crime.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, Your Honor, and it did\nfind a violation of the Eighth Amendment.\nQUESTION: But you're not saying, are you, that\nbeing an habitual criminal is like being a drug addict or\na drunk? That is, just being drunk, just being stoned on\ndrugs is not a crime?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No.\nthat this Court has repeatedly said that grossly\ndisproportionate sentences violate the Eighth Amendment,\nand the cases that I mentioned say that. In addition --\nQUESTION: That's what they say, but you've\ngiven Robinson as an example, and that's a case where I\nthought the Court said there was no crime, not that it was\ncruel and unusual punishment for a crime.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, Your Honor, and what I'm\nsimply saying is, these are examples which the Court has\nrepeatedly said that grossly disproportionate sentences\nviolate the Eighth Amendment.\nQUESTION: Did the California courts contradict\nthat? Did the California courts here say, grossly\ndisproportionate crimes don't violate the Eighth\nAmendment?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, Your Honor. The\nCalifornia Court of Appeals, and you find this in the\nappendix to the cert petition, said it questioned whether\ngross disproportionality analysis would be applied, and it\nquestioned whether Solem v. Helm analysis applied, and\ntherefore the California Court of Appeals did not apply\nthe three-part test from Solem v. Helm and the three-part\ntest that comes from Justice Kennedy's opinion in\nHarmelin.\nAnd in answer to Justice Ginsburg's question, it\nis those cases that announce the test that should have\nbeen applied, and those cases are clearly established law.\nQUESTION: Your opponent says that the\nCalifornia court relied on a Lynch analysis, which is a\nState court doing much the same thing.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: Do you disagree with that?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: I do disagree. First, the\nCalifornia Court of Appeal expressly said it was not going\nto do gross disproportionality analysis. It did not do\nSolem analysis. It did not do Harmelin analysis.\nQUESTION: Well, I realize that, and my question\nto you was, if the California court said we're going to do\na Lynch analysis, is that substantially the same thing?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor. The\nCalifornia Court of Appeal said the test under California\nlaw is whether the sentence, quote, shocks the conscience.\nThat is a quite different test than the objective test of\nSolem and Harmelin, which is carefully calibrated\ndetermining whether a sentence is grossly\ndisproportionate.\nAlso, the three factors used by the California\nCourt of Appeal under the Lynch analysis were quite\ndifferent than the Solem analysis. First, there was no\ncomparison of the gravity of the offense to the harshness\nof the punishment. Second, the court did not look to\nsimilar punishments in the same jurisdiction.\nIn California, the punishment for rape would\nhave been 8 years in prison, the punishment for\nmanslaughter would have been 11 years in prison, the\npunishment for second degree murder would have been 15\nyears in prison, and he received 50 years to life. In\nfact, if his prior offenses had been rape and murder, he\ncould have at most gotten a year in jail.\nThis goes to Justice Stevens' question earlier.\nHis prior -- his crime here was the misdemeanor of\nshoplifting. Because of double-counting it was elevated\nfirst to petty theft with a prior, and then it triggered\nthe three strikes law, but in order for it to be petty\ntheft with a prior, there has to be a prior property\noffense.\nIf his prior crimes had been rape and murder,\nthen his maximum sentence for stealing these videotapes\nwould have been a year in jail. It's because his prior\noffenses were property crimes that the double-counting\ncould occur. Additionally --\nQUESTION: I thought your opponent, or perhaps\nthe representative of the State, said that was not so.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor. The confusion\nhere is that with regard to petty theft, petty theft, the\nmisdemeanor can become the wobbler petty theft with a\nprior under California Penal Code section 666 only if the\nprior crime is a property crime, and if you look at\nCalifornia Penal Code section 66, it enumerates just\nproperty crimes.\nQUESTION: Mr. Chemerinsky, I thought that what\nmade the petty theft in this case into a wobbler was not\nthe crimes that were listed as strikes, but another petty\ntheft. Is that not true?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, Your Honor. They used a\npetty theft, but they also used the burglaries to convert\nthe petty theft to a petty theft with a prior, and then\nthey used the petty theft with a prior to trigger the\nthree strikes law.\nQUESTION: I thought they used -- they didn't --\nthere was a second petty theft. That was the crime of\nconviction. I thought there was an earlier one that made\nthe crime of conviction the petty theft with a prior. Is\nthat wrong?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: That is correct. However,\nYour Honor, under California Penal Code section 667(g) any\nprior felonies must be pled and proven, and the only prior\nfelonies here that were ever mentioned were the\nburglaries, and as a result, simply because of stealing\n$152 worth of videotapes in those burglaries, he received\na sentence of 50 years to life, and under the third prong\nof the rule of Harmelin.\nQUESTION: Well, is it not so that a judge\nhaving the two strikes that are listed, and also having\nthe full record of the crimes that this person has\ncommitted, that that's relevant to the discretion the\njudge has to strike a strike, or to say I'm not going to\ntreat that petty theft as a felony, the petty theft with\nprior as a felony. I'm not going to do that.\nThere was in this case, was there not, in\naddition to the two strikes, some serious criminal\nactivity?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor, they played no\nrole in the sentence here, and the reason, as I said, is\nthe California Penal Code says any prior felonies must be\npled and proven. If you look at the felony complaint --\nQUESTION: I didn't ask you about --\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: -- the ones that count as strikes.\nI asked you about the sentencing judge who has discretion\ncould say, looking at -- if that's all we had on this\nrecord, I'm not going -- I'm going to exercise my\ndiscretion to knock down the wobbler to a misdemeanor.\nI'm going to knock out a strike. Isn't that in effect\nwhat sentencing judges would do?\nsimply to the two strikes that are formally pled, but this\nperson's entire record.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, that not what\noccurred here. If you look at the sentencing transcript\non page 37 of the Joint Appendix, you'll see that the\nsentencing judge made no mention to anything other than\nthe three burglaries.\nQUESTION: Well, isn't he presumed to know what\nthe record is?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor, because\nCalifornia Penal Code requires an order, for it to be\nconsidered a strike, it has to be pled and proven. The\ncriminal complaint here, the criminal information, the\njury finding was just as to those burglaries, and the\nsentencing judge focused it just on those burglaries.\nQUESTION: Well, no. No. That's true as to the\nstrikes, but that doesn't mean that he didn't notice the\nentire record in order to inform his discretion.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, there's no --\nQUESTION: Or her.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: -- indication here that there\nwas ever any consideration other than the burglaries.\nQUESTION: But there's no indication that the\nrecord was not before the judge.\nQUESTION:\nhim? Isn't there a presentence or an equivalent of a\npresentencing report? Doesn't he get the record of what\nthis person he's about to sentence has done in the past?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: There was a probation report,\nbut because under California law prior strikes have to be\npled and proven, because only the burglaries were\nmentioned, there's no reason here for the judge --\nQUESTION: Excuse me. Only the burglaries were\nmentioned in the presentencing report?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No. Only the burglaries were\nproven.\nQUESTION: Were proven?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: The jury, on pages 18 and 19\nof the joint appendix, found the burglaries, thus there\nwas no reason for Andrade to challenge the contents of the\nprobation report, and the judge never mentioned the\nprobation report. He focused just on the burglaries.\nAnd the other thing that makes this case, I\nthink, quite unique is no other State in the country would\nimpose a punishment like this on Andrade. The Solicitor\nGeneral's brief points to some instances where in essence\ngrand theft, stealing more than $400 has led to a\nsentence. The State can't identify, and there is no\ninstance where anybody else has received this sentence.\nQUESTION:\npoint that let's think of the class of serious criminals,\nand we've decided in California to tell all people in that\nclass one more crime, you've had it.\nNow, they have to define one more crime, and so\nwhere they choose to draw the line is the line not before\nyou get to wobblers, but the line after you get to\nwobblers, and they say that takes jay-walking and parking\noffenses and everything and says, we're not talking about\nthose, we're talking about these, and what the other side\nis arguing is, that's within the legislative discretion\nthat the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause must give.\nAll right. Why isn't it?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Justice Breyer, the reason\nthis case is different is the underlying conduct here is a\nmisdemeanor that's double-counted in order to become the\nbasis for a life sentence. Earlier, for example, Justice\nScalia even invoked the distinction between misdemeanor\nand felony. A key point here is, there is no limiting\nprinciple that --\nQUESTION: Well, no, they're saying on that\nparticular point, and I'm trying to get your response --\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- they say, there are felonies which\nare not wobblers, and they're quite serious. There are\nwobblers which are medium-serious, and there are those\nthings that can't even wobble. They are trivial, and\nwhere we choose to draw the line is between the last --\nyou know, between -- below the wobblers and not above.\nWhat's wrong with that?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Because that could lead to an\nindeterminate life sentence for stealing a candy bar or\neven a gum ball.\nQUESTION: Yes, it could.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: And that would violate --\nQUESTION: It could, and they'll say yes, that\nis true in certain circumstances, and then they will\nrepeat the argument I just made. I'm not holding him to\nmy argument. I'm trying to push you a little bit, and to\nsay, if people are told, one more gum ball and you've had\nit, that's a legitimate purpose of sentencing.\nNow, how do I come back in some other than\npurely subjective way and say, well, you know, you've gone\ntoo far? Is there anything one is to appeal to other than\na judge's subjective reaction?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: It is not subjective, it is\nthe three-part objective test that is the rule of\nHarmelin. It is first comparing the gravity of the\noffense to the harshness of the punishment.\nIn Solem v. Helm, this Court said the courts can\nevaluate the gravity of the offense, looking to see if\nit's a violent versus a nonviolent offense. Leandro\nAndrade never committed any violent offense.\nQUESTION: But in that, there's nothing in\nHarmelin as I reread it that indicates that you must\npreclude or prescind from that analysis, that initial\nanalysis, the fact that there is a recidivist element\nhere.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Of course.\nQUESTION: Recidivism is part of the analysis.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: It is, and recidivists can --\nQUESTION: So we're not just talking about gum\nballs. We're talking about all of the offenses, including\nbreaking and entering with knives and so forth.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: But Leandro Andrade never was\naccused or convicted of breaking and entering with knives\nand in fact, Your Honor, even if you look at all of his\noffenses, his criminal pattern is virtually identical to\nthat of Helm in Solem v. Helm.\nI would go back to Chief Justice Rehnquist's\nquestion --\nQUESTION: On that matter, what about what Judge\nSneed said in his dissent in the Ninth Circuit when he\npointed out that there was much in this criminal history\nrecord in addition to the two strikes, including Federal\nmarijuana transportation offenses and a parole violation\nfor escape from Federal prison?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: First, Your Honor, as I said\nbefore, there's no indication that those were ever\nconsidered, nor could they be by the sentencing court, but\nsecond, Your Honor, even if you consider all of those,\nthen his criminal record is virtually identical to Helm's\nin Solem v. Helm, and this does go to Chief Justice\nRehnquist's initial question.\nOne way that this Court has said that you can\nfind that a penalty or a sentence is contrary to clearly\nestablished Federal law is if a State court ignores a\ndecision that is on all fours. Solem v. Helm --\nQUESTION: Well, on all fours, on that point, is\nthere any decision where a term of years was struck down\nas disproportionate? Solem, I take it, was a life\nsentence.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, in Solem v. Helm\nit was a life sentence, but there's nothing in Solem or\nHarmelin that indicates that disproportionality analysis\nis only where there's no possibility of parole. If that\nwere the analysis, then a State could avoid\ndisproportionality review just by calling every life\nwithout possibility of parole a 75-year sentence.\nQUESTION: If the question is what's clearly\nestablished, and if I'm a trial court judge, I'll look to\nsee what the court did, not grandly general statements\nthat it made about constitutional principle, and if I --\nif my investigation led me to find that no, there has not\nbeen a single case in which a term of years has been\nstruck down, then I might assume that the law for terms of\nyears is not clearly established.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, Solem v. Helm\nanswers that question. Here, Leandro Andrade received an\nindeterminate life sentence with no possibility of parole\nfor 50 years. That is the functional equivalent of the\nsentence that Helm received in Solem v. Helm, and yet the\nCalifornia Court of Appeal expressly said it would not\napply Solem v. Helm.\nQUESTION: Mr. Chemerinsky, the difficulty that\nI have with your argument is, number 1, the point that\nJustice Ginsburg made, but a further point that has come\nout this morning.\nWhen we are asking whether there is clearly\nestablished law, I think we've got to take into\nconsideration something that has become clear from, I\nthink has become clear from this argument, and that is\nthat there is a question as to whether the test is\ngenuinely a proportionality or a gross disproportionality\ntest, or whether that is simply an example of a kind of\nrational basis test, because we've had this difficulty in\nfitting the recidivism into the structure of\nproportionality analysis, and I think what tends to come\nout in the answers that we've gotten this morning is,\nthere's more than just proportionality which is being\nconsidered here.\nIf that is true, if that is a fair\ncharacterization of the way our reasoning is working, then\ndon't we have great difficulty in saying that there was\nclearly established law simply by looking to Solem and to\nHarmelin?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor. The reason\nis, two things were clearly established at the time the\nCalifornia Court of Appeal decision came down, first, that\ngrossly disproportionate sentences violate the Eighth\nAmendment, and the court said it questioned it, didn't\napply it, and second, the test that's supposed to be used,\nthe objective test from the rule of Harmelin -- from\nSolem v. Helm, and the court did not apply that three-\npart test, and in that way the court acted contrary to\nclearly established law.\nAlso, since Solem v. Helm is really factually\nindistinguishable in this case, the court acted contrary\nto in not following, and in addition --\nQUESTION: You're saying that if the law is\ngoing to become unclear, it's going to be as a result of\nwhat we say this morning, as -- rather than what we have\nsaid before.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, Your Honor, at least\nwith -- insofar as gross disproportionality violates the\nEighth Amendment, and the test for gross\ndisproportionality being clearly established, and the\nCalifornia courts followed neither of those.\nQUESTION: Well, do you -- Mr. Chemerinsky, do\nyou -- do you think that Solem v. Helm was as strong a\ncase after our decision in Harmelin as it was before?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, in two ways. First, the\nthree-part test that it prescribes is still followed,\nthough Justice Kennedy's opinion from Harmelin says\nthere's only a need to consider the latter two prongs if\nthere is an inference of gross disproportionality\ncomparing the gravity of the offense to the harshness of\nthe punishment.\nAnd second, no subsequent case, including\nHarmelin, has ever ruled, overruled Solem v. Helm, so --\nQUESTION: Well, but do you think a State court\njudge is acting unreasonably if he says we have three\ncases, Rummel, Solem, and Harmelin, and it just isn't\nquite all that clear?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor, I think that\nis unreasonable here, because the California Court of\nAppeal applied only Rummel, but in footnote 32 in Solem,\nthe Court said that Rummel is confined to its facts,\nbecause it's before the three-part test.\nQUESTION: Yes, but then Harmelin goes ahead\nand, as I say, cites Rummel more often than it does Solem.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: And Rummel remains good law\ninsofar as result, but Harmelin affirms the three-part\ntest. This Court has repeatedly affirmed that three-part\ntest.\nQUESTION: Although it didn't apply it, although\nit said, we don't have to go beyond the first step, and it\nsaid, you might get to those others in exceedingly rare\ncases.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: That's correct, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: And I suppose what you are telling us\nis, this is that rare case.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: This is that rare case,\nbecause in this instance, a man who had never committed a\nviolent crime received an indeterminate life sentence with\nno possibility of parole for 50 years for stealing a small\namount of videotapes.\nQUESTION: May I ask this question that's -- is\na practical one, is, in view of what I referred to before\nthat Judge Sneed brought out in his dissent, if any of\nthose other activities could have been priors, wouldn't a\nresentencing here likely yield the very same result,\nexcept that this time the prosecutor would spell out what\nthat entire course of conduct was?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: I think, Your Honor, that\nthere is very little likelihood, based on all of the\nCalifornia cases, that a resentencing would lead to a\ndifferent result here, so in that sense I agree with you,\nand that's why it really is a constitutional issue. Does\nan indeterminate life sentence for this conduct, even\ntaking into account his recidivism, justify the penalty\nthat was received here?\nThis Court has prescribed exactly the objective\nfactors to be considered, and to treat stealing $153 worth\nof videotapes more seriously than second degree murder\ndoesn't even meet a rational basis test, and it is an\nunreasonable application, and in that way, this case --\nQUESTION: Well, it wasn't that they were\ntreating this person as someone whose prior record\nwarranted incapacitating him. They weren't merely\npunishing a single offense. They were punishing a person,\nor they were incapacitating a person that they found to be\nan incorrigible offender.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Based on three burglaries that\nwere 13 years earlier, and twice shoplifting a small\namount of videotapes, and that's why our argument is that\nthis is that rare case where it is grossly\ndisproportionate punishment to in essence --\nQUESTION: But that case hasn't been seen yet.\nThis would be it. This -- there has been -- am I wrong in\nthinking there has been no case since Harmelin where we\nhave said that a sentence is grossly disproportionate, and\nno lower Federal court has struck down a sentence since\nthen?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: It is correct that this Court\nhas not found any sentence to be grossly disproportionate\nsince Harmelin -- you've not dealt with this issue since\nHarmelin -- but there are lower court cases. For example,\na year ago the Eighth Circuit in Henderson v. Norris found\na life sentence for possessing a small amount of cocaine\nwas grossly disproportionate, applying the rule of\nHarmelin and also applying the Solem v. Helm test.\nQUESTION: Was that a recidivist case?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: I don't think it was a\nrecidivist case, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Has there been a recidivist case\nsince that trilogy that you recited?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: There are State courts that\nhave found recidivist sentencing structures to violate\nUnited States Constitution, but there are not -- then\nthose would also involve recidivists, and those would have\napplied both Solem and Helm.\nThe West Virginia Court in State v. Deal, for\nexample, found a recidivist sentencing structure to be\ncruel and unusual punishment. The Colorado court of\nappeals in People v. Gaskins came to the same result, and\nthat also explains why this case is different than Early\nv. Packer, which you decided yesterday, and there the\ncriticism was that it was a situation where the State\ncourt didn't cite to or mention the controlling Supreme\nCourt decision.\nHere, the California supreme court said it was\nrejecting the test prescribed by this Court, rejecting the\ntest from Harmelin v. Michigan, which is a very different\nsituation than this case.\nQUESTION: What were the words that it used? I\ndon't think it was that strong. I thought it questioned\nwhether those -- that was still good law.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, Your Honor. The exact\nwording from the court was the question. The exact\nwording was, and I quote to you from page 76 of the\nappendix to the cert petition, however, to the extent that\nthe defendant suggests that proportionality analysis\napplies under both the State and Federal Constitutions, we\nmust question that assertion, and then the court said, on\nthe same page, the current validity of the Solem\nproportionality analysis is questionable.\nAnd having said it was questionable, the court\nthen did not apply the rule that grossly disproportionate\nsentences violate the Eighth Amendment. The court did not\napply the Solem analysis, the rule of Harmelin that the\ncourt identified in Harmelin v. Michigan, and it was the\nfailure of the court to apply the controlling test, it was\nthe failure of the court to follow the controlling\nprecedent --\nQUESTION: Well --\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: -- that made the decision\ncontrary.\nQUESTION: -- they say, Mr. Chemerinsky, on that\nsame page, they say that the Solem proportionality\nanalysis is questionable in the light of Harmelin against\nMichigan. They certainly weren't saying they were\nrefusing to apply Harmelin.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: But Your Honor, they then did\nnot apply the three-part test that Justice Kennedy\narticulated, which is the rule of Harmelin --\nQUESTION: But I thought you said they simply\nrefused to follow Harmelin.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Well, they didn't --\nQUESTION: I -- you're not meaning, then, that\nthey expressly refused to follow Harmelin, you're saying\nthat, in fact, they didn't use the same formula as\nHarmelin suggested?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Well, that's correct, Your\nHonor, they didn't use in any way the three-part test from\nHarmelin.\nQUESTION: But --\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: All they did was analogize to\nRummel v. Estelle.\nQUESTION: That was not the Court's test, that\nwas Justice Kennedy's test, which you say was the lowest\ncommon denominator. You think it's clearly established\nlaw that where you have a split decision, the lowest\ncommon denominator is the law of the land?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: In United States --\nQUESTION: I think that's a highly controverted\nproposition myself.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, in United States\nv. Marks this Court described how to determine the rule\nwhen there is no majority opinion, but especially here,\nwhere Justice Kennedy is simply slightly modifying a prior\ntest from Solem v. Helm, the law is clearly established.\nQUESTION: Not an opinion of the Court, an\nopinion of Justice Kennedy, and you say that all the\nStates' courts have to accept the proposition that that is\nthe law of the land?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, virtually every\ncircuit has said that is the rule of Harmelin, but\nespecially so here, where it is simply slightly modifying\na test that's been on the books for 20 years, since\nSolem v. Helm, that says three considerations are used to\ncalibrate whether a sentence is cruel and unusual.\nQUESTION: So Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke\nis the law of the land, and you think that that is\ngenerally accepted?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: My sense is you're going to\nhave occasion soon enough to deal with that issue --\nQUESTION: Understood.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: -- but --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: My point is that the proposition is\nnot, is simply not well-established, that you must accept\na less than majority opinion of the Supreme Court as being\nthe law of the land so long as it's the lowest common\ndenominator.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, I think there's\nthree reasons why it is. First, this Court's opinion in\nUnited States v. Marks describes how to determine what the\nholding is.\nSecond, every circuit -- and we cite this in our\nbrief -- refers to the rule of Harmelin, and virtually\nevery State that's considered it refers to the rule of\nHarmelin, which shows that it's clearly established.\nAnd third, the Solem v. Helm test was not in any\nway overruled. Seven Justices in this Court in Harmelin\nadhered to the Solem test.\nQUESTION: But they split 4 to 3 as to what the\ntest required in that case, didn't they?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: But seven Justices --\nQUESTION: So you -- doesn't that throw some\ndoubt as to how closely you follow that?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor. Seven\nJustices agreed that grossly disproportionate sentences\nviolate the Constitution. Four would apply an even more\nprotective standard for criminal defendants, but seven\nJustices clearly adhered to that. Seven Justices adhered\nto the Solem v. Helm test.\nQUESTION: But doesn't that suggest that the\ntest isn't that clear if they apply it and three come out\none way and four come out the other?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, often Justices\nwill disagree, but the question here is, is the rule\nclearly established, and the rule that grossly\ndisproportionate sentences violate the Constitution, the\nrule that there's an objective three-part test, is what is\nthe clearly established law, and Your Honor, if any\nsentence is grossly disproportionate, it's this case.\nThe punishment here isn't just cruel and\nunusual, it's cruel and unique. The State can't point to\neven one other person in the history of the United States\nwho has received a sentence of 50 years to life for\nshoplifting a small amount of merchandise. Even in\nCalifornia this sentence would be regarded as quite --\nmuch larger than, say, second degree murder, manslaughter,\nrape, which shows that it is a grossly disproportionate\npunishment.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Chemerinsky.\nMr. Danzig, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS P. DANZIG\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DANZIG: Thank you. Given the limited time,\nthere are just a couple of brief points I would like to\nmake about respondent's argument.\nI think it's clear that when he's arguing that\nthe proportionality analysis has to be confined to the\npredicate offenses and the triggering offense, without\nregard to the entire record, what he is essentially doing\nis raising a facial challenge to the statute despite the\nfact that the Ninth Circuit claimed that they were not\ninvalidating the statute, and to that extent that any\nfacial challenge can be made, the ameliorating provisions\nof the California scheme would result in a finding that\nthe statute is not -- in -- unconstitutional on its face.\nSecondly, just as a points, a couple of points\nof correction -- the Court has already touched upon it --\nthe court of appeal did not question whether the\nproportionality analysis was correct. It questioned\nwhether Solem's version of the proportionality analysis\nwas still correct. That's what the State court did, and\nit still went ahead and applied a proportionality analysis\nvia a State court decision of Lynch.\nAnd in terms of whether gross disproportionality\nwas addressed or not, the State used, or the State court\nused a standard articulated from Lynch, which is shocks\nthe conscience, and it is much stronger language and is at\nleast reasonably a euphemism for grossly disproportionate.\nAlso, I will find the page in just a moment, but\nI believe at the sentencing hearing the judge did indicate\nthat he had considered the probation report. It's in the\njoint appendix, and I will find the cite in a moment.\nUltimately, if there's any doubt about whether\nthere's clear precedent or not, the -- I think that the\nState court determination should be given deference in\nthis case, and almost finally, not -- Andrade did not\nreceive life for three burglaries and two petties, he\nreceived that because the ameliorating provisions go into\nthe analysis, and as he was not granted the benefit of any\nof them, and in fact hasn't even asserted one of them, he\ndid not receive that sentence for that, for strictly life\nfor three burglaries and two petties. He's received it\nbased on his overall record.\nIn terms of whether there are -- anyone else in\nCalifornia has suffered a similar sentence, while we -- I\nhave no reference to any 50-year-to-life sentences based\non two convictions, there are 300 and -- approximately 344\ndefendants in California serving 25-year-to-life sentences\nfor petty offense, offense with a prior which constitutes\nthe one 25-to-life sentence.\nQUESTION: But that's under the three strikes\nregime?\nMR. DANZIG: Correct, Your Honor.\nFinally --\nQUESTION: So that doesn't tell us much about\nthe constitutionality of the three strikes regime.\nMR. DANZIG: No. It was simply a response to\nrespondent's assertion that we could not point to anyone\nelse serving a similarly severe sentence for a similar\ncrime --\nQUESTION: But we have the SG's footnote, which\ndoes have a few.\nMR. DANZIG: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: But not this serious. I mean, not\nthis trivial.\nMR. DANZIG: Well, I don't think -- I would not\ncharacterize it as trivial, but I understand --\nQUESTION: Not this -- I'm looking for the right\nword. Not this minor?\nMR. DANZIG: I think that under the California\nscheme it's clear presumptively that theft is a felony\noffense, and we simply grant -- and California simply\ngrants the first-time offender an opportunity to reform.\nI don't consider it trivial or minor.\nUltimately, we would ask the Court to disapprove\nVan Tran. It's presenting significant problems. It's\ninconsistent with this Court's pronouncements in\nWilliams v. Taylor and in Bell v. Cone and Penry v.\nJohnson. It establishes a methodology that is simply\nincorrect, and finally, in 1996, Congress limited the\nscope of Federal habeas corpus review.\nHere, the Ninth Circuit failed to properly apply\nthose, the principles guiding that analysis.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Danzig.\nMR. DANZIG: Thank you, Your Honor.\n"
