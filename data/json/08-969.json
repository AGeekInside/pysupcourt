        "content": "(1:00 p.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nthis afternoon in Case 08-969, Hemi Group v. The City of\nNew York.\nMr. Barnhouse.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF RANDOLPH H. BARNHOUSE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. BARNHOUSE: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nPossessory and use taxes are extremely\ndifficult to collect, even under the best of\ncircumstances. Indeed, here the city alleges in its\nsecond amended complaint that it only collected 40 cents\non the dollar, and its response claims a collection rate\nof 55 cents on the dollar. Yet it wants to collect 300\ncents on the dollar from my clients, who never owed\nthese taxes in the first place.\nThe Respondent City of New York alleged two\nRICO claims and pendent State law violations that the\ncity said resulted in a lost sovereign opportunity to\ncollect cigarette possessory taxes from its city\nresidents. The alleged lost opportunity to tax was\nbased on claims that my clients and 50 other defendants\nin four consolidated cases did not send names of\ncustomers to the State of New York and had statements on\ntheir website saying sales were tax-free and no tobacco\ntaxes applied.\nThe Federal district court dismissed all\nclaims. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated\none of the city's RICO claims against the Petitioners,\nthe Hemi Group and its sole owner, Kai Gachupin, and\naffirmed dismissal of the city's other RICO and its\ncommon law fraud claims.\nYet reinstating the one RICO claim was\nimproper because the city does not have standing to sue,\nbased on the injuries that it has alleged. It does not\nhave standing because the city's claim that it lost the\nsovereign opportunity to tax is not an injury to -- to\nbusiness, and it's not an injury to property.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why -- why isn't the\nmoney property?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: Money in the bank would be\nproperty, Mr. Chief Justice Roberts, but an opportunity\nto collect money is an inchoate interest, and so it\nwould not be property at that point. It would be the\nopportunity to collect it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, isn't a\nlawsuit with a potential recovery regarded as property\nof an individual?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: The lawsuit would be -- the\nlawsuit itself would be property, but the -- but any\nrecovery would not be property until it became choate,\nuntil there was an amount of money assigned to it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There is no such\nadjective -- I know we have used it, but there is no\nsuch adjective as \"choate.\" There is \"inchoate,\" but\nthe opposite of \"inchoate\" is not \"choate.\"\nMR. BARNHOUSE: All right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Any more than the -- I\ndon't know.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BARNHOUSE: Well, I'm wrong on the -- on\nthe --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly. Yes. It's like\n\"gruntled.\"\nMR. BARNHOUSE: But I think I am right on\nthe law, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly. \"Disgruntled\" and\nthe opposite of \"disgruntled\" is \"gruntled.\"\nMR. BARNHOUSE: Is \"gruntled.\"\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BARNHOUSE: Well, it would -- it would\nbe inchoate at the time the -- the city was just\nexercising its opportunity to tax, but had not -- or\nexercising its sovereign right to tax, but had not yet\nassessed the tax --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the status of\ntaxes owing for wire fraud purposes was settled in\nPasquantino. There it was a question of alcohol taxes\nowed to Canada.\nThere were taxes due, but not paid. So why\ndoesn't Pasquantino settle at least the property\nquestion that taxes owed to a sovereign qualify as\nproperty?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: Justice Ginsburg,\nPasquantino, the holding there was -- it was a criminal\nprosecution by the U.S. Government, and it dealt with\nthe term \"property\" in the -- in the Mail and Wire Fraud\nStatute, not the overlying 1964(c) requirement of injury\nto business or property.\nMoreover, it was the taxpayer who was being\nprosecuted, the person who actually had taken the liquor\ninto Canada, not some third party that said, let me sell\nyou the liquor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, there are certainly\ndifferences from this case, and it wasn't a RICO case,\neither. But why would the determination of what --\nwhether an amount owed to a government qualifies as\nproperty, why wouldn't -- why would that answer differ?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: Justice Ginsburg, once the\namount owed is assessed, once there's a determination of\nthe amount owed --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was no assessment\nby Canada in the Pasquantino case.\nMR. BARNHOUSE: There was --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They said the -- the\ndefendant was smuggling liquor into Canada and getting\nit there without paying the Canadians' exorbitant taxes.\nMR. BARNHOUSE: The prosecution on the mail\nand wire fraud criminal -- well, criminal standing was\nnot an issue there. It was the U.S. Government --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But we're talking\nabout -- only about property, not standing or anything\nelse. And in Pasquantino, the Court said that a scheme\naimed -- aimed at depriving Canada of money to which it\nwas entitled by law qualifies as property for wire fraud\npurposes.\nMR. BARNHOUSE: Yes, Your Honor, for wire\nfraud purposes. and the Court took a very expansive\nview of property in Pasquantino.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So why is this different?\nI mean, it's clear that \"property\" can mean that. You\nacknowledge that it can mean the government's\nentitlement to money from taxes?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: For purposes of the -- of\nthe Mail and Wire Fraud Statute, this Court has held\nthat property can be for purposes of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So it can mean that. Now\nwhy -- why should we say it doesn't mean that here?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: At the time, because of the\noverlying standing requirement Congress placed in RICO\nof injury to a person's business or property, and\nbecause of Congress's reliance at that time on the\nantitrust laws and the general understanding at that\ntime that business or property did not include the type\nof sovereign interest in an opportunity to collect tax,\nas confirmed by the Ninth Circuit and this Court in\nHawaii v. Standard Oil of California that this Court\naffirmed, where the sovereign opportunity to tax is much\ndifference -- different from the actual collection of a\n-- of a set amount of tax that the government knows it\nhas coming.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is the word \"property\" used\nin the antitrust laws?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: Yes, Your Honor. In fact,\nthe -- I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What does it say?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: The standing for purposes of\nthe antitrust laws is injury. A person has standing who\nhas been injured in his business or property. It's\nexactly the same as in RICO. In fact, Congress took the\nlanguage from the antitrust laws, Justice Scalia, and\nplaced it into RICO unchanged.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And it -- and it's clear\nthat for purposes of the antitrust laws, property does\nnot include the government's entitlement to income from\ntaxes?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: Yes, Your Honor. In Hawaii,\nthis Court made it clear that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The Hawaii case didn't\ninvolve a claim to taxes.\nMR. BARNHOUSE: Justice Stevens, it was a\nclaim of injury to the general economy, which included\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right, and parens patriae\nfor the community at large.\nMR. BARNHOUSE: Yes, Your Honor. The State\nof Hawaii brought three claims. One was its injury to\nitself; one was the potential class action; and then the\nparens patriae claim.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But none of them involved\na claim to taxes.\nMR. BARNHOUSE: It was my understanding that\nthe injury to the general economy, the underlying claim\nwas that by losing that economic engine, that the State\nitself would be injured because of the loss to the\neconomy and in its governmental functions. The actual\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but that -- that's\nsomething different. This isn't just the general, you\nknow, you hurt the economy and therefore you hurt the\nState. Here, what they're saying is: You caused people\nwho owed me taxes not to pay taxes, an identified sum of\nmoney.\nMR. BARNHOUSE: Justice Scalia, it's not an\nidentified sum of money. They don't know -- they can't\ntell who owed the taxes, in what amount, whether any of\nthose people were eligible for the exemption under the\nlaw. It was inchoate. It was not known. It was not\nknown who owed it or --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it might have been\ninchoate but still -- they would have to be prove that,\nI assume, in the litigation here, wouldn't they? I\nmean, let's assume we let the litigation go forward.\nWouldn't they have to prove what taxes were not paid?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: They would have to -- they\nwould absolutely have to prove that for purposes of\ndamages.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So worry about that later.\nI mean, just because some of them might be difficult to\nprove or not provable doesn't mean that the rest that\nare very clear do not constitute property.\nMR. BARNHOUSE: The -- the -- what they've\nalleged here is not that they've lost the taxes, but\nthat they've lost the opportunity to tax. Moreover,\nthey should not be able to reach that point because the\nallegations themselves are that the injury is not\nproximate. It is the city itself --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's a different issue.\nMR. BARNHOUSE: It is a different issue.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're going to talk about\nthat one, aren't you?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: I was hoping for a smooth\ntransition, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You've got it.\nMR. BARNHOUSE: The -- the injury to the\ncity is much like the injury in Holmes, where the city\nclaims to be at the tail end of the chain of causation.\nThey allege two injuries, sources of their injury. One\nwas that statements made on an Internet website somehow\ncaused people who purchased cigarettes in New York City\nnot to pay. The district court described that source of\ninjury as farfetched. Those were Judge Batts' words.\nThe second source of injury they claim is\nthat by not reporting to the State of New York, the city\nthen did not receive information about which city\nresidents purchased cigarettes, and the city could then\nnot go to those residents who had not self-assessed, and\n--\nJUSTICE ALITO: Putting aside the fact that\nthe Jenkins Act information would be sent to the State\nrather than the city, why -- how can you -- how can it\nbe said that at this stage of the litigation that it's\nfarfetched that having a statement on the website \"No\ntaxes due\" is -- doesn't cause people to purchase those\ncigarettes for the very purpose of avoiding the taxes?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: Well, Justice Alito, the\nallegations here are not that there were no taxes due.\nThere wasn't someone waving a tea bag and saying, \"Don't\npay your taxes.\" What the website's allegations are is\nthat the sales are tax-free, and the sales were\ntax-free. As the city points out, they -- it was beyond\nthe power of the city to impose any sales tax on these\ntransactions which occurred on the Jemez Pueblo in New\nMexico.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is it, a user tax once\nit gets into the city?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: Exactly, Justice Scalia.\nIt's a possessory tax --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Like automobiles.\nMR. BARNHOUSE: Pardon me?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Just like automobiles. If\nyou buy a car out of the State, you haven't paid the\nState sales tax, but if you bring it into the State, you\nhave to pay a use tax.\nMR. BARNHOUSE: That's right. That's right,\nJustice Scalia, and the obligation to pay that tax is on\nthe person who brings the car into the State. The\nobligation to pay the possessory use tax is on the\ncitizens of the city of New York.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that's all it was\nalleged that these websites said, \"tax-free\"? They said\n\"tax-free\"?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: \"Sales are tax-free.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: \"Sales are tax-free.\"\nThat's very clever.\nMR. BARNHOUSE: And \"no tobacco tax.\" Those\nare the two allegations.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No -- \"no tobacco tax\"?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But there is a tobacco tax,\nisn't there? Don't you -- wouldn't you call that use\ntax a tax on tobacco?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: No, Your Honor, it's\nspecifically not a tax on tobacco. It's a tax on the\npossession of cigarettes and there are exemptions to it.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why isn't that just a\nquestion -- a substantive fraud question, rather than a\nproximate cause question?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: The --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is it -- is it fraudulent to\nsay \"sales are tax-free\" as opposed to, you know, saying\nno taxes are due?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: Well, it has to do with the\nintervening, Justice Alito, with -- with intervening\ncauses of the city's failure to collect these taxes.\nThe -- RICO requires someone who has been\ninjured in their business or property by reason of the\nalleged proximate act, and the fact is the city here was\ninjured in its -- was injured, if at all, by reason of\nits citizens' failure to self-assess and pay their\ntaxes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It was injured because it\ncouldn't find its citizens because it didn't know who\nthey were. And that was the whole idea of the Jenkins\nAct, was to help States find the people who were evading\nthe payment of the use tax on the cigarettes.\nMR. BARNHOUSE: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. The\nJenkins Act was -- was focused on allowing States to\nhelp find those, and the city is therefore outside the\nzone of interest.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose -- suppose\nyou had a case in which an individual that lives in New\nYork goes to a person with a supply of cigarettes\noutside the State and says: I want to buy a lot of\ncigarettes and I don't want to pay taxes; can you help\nme? And they agree on an arrangement to ship, to ship\nthe cigarettes.\nIs there proximate cause? Is it there if\nthe city sues for injury in that hypothetical case?\nWould you say there's no proximate cause?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: I would say that there is no\nproximate cause for a lawsuit under RICO against the\nseller who the person went to and said: My goal here is\nnot to pay taxes; can you help me figure out a way to\nget them into the city in a way that I don't have to?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And you think the city --\nand you think the city cannot show proximate cause in a\nsuit for its injury against the seller of the\ncigarettes? You think there's no proximate cause in\nthat hypothetical case?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: Yes, Your Honor, I would say\nthat there would be an intervening, Justice Kennedy,\nthere would be the intervening cause of the person's\ndecision. It's -- it's beyond the first step.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Even though those are the\nonly two people that have made the arrangement, and that\nwas the whole purpose and intent of the arrangement?\nAnd you still say there's no proximate cause?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: Your Honor, the intent to\ninjure, even if specific, as the Court held in\nAssociated General Contractors, is not itself sufficient\nto change -- to give someone standing under RICO.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does your answer to\nJustice Kennedy depend upon a notion that the causation\nstandard as -- in RICO is different than general\nproximate cause standards in tort law?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: No, Your Honor, because I\nbelieve that the proximate cause standard that the Court\nhas adopted rests at its core in proximate cause\nanalysis in tort law. When the Court first started\napplying proximate cause requirements in the antitrust\nlaw and in RICO, it was looking at, as I understand it,\nthe -- the common law analysis of proximate cause,\nand -- and it really discussed the elements of that\nquite clearly in the Associated General Contractors case\nwhere it talks about five or six factors that the Court\nhas to look at, those factors being the nature of the\nplaintiff's alleged injury, is it -- whether it was the\ntype that the antitrust laws were intended to forestall,\nor here the RICO laws. We would submit that it is not.\nIt's an injury to a sovereign interest.\nThe directness of the injury. Here the\ninjury is indirect. It either comes -- flows through\nthe citizens who didn't pay their taxes or through the\nState that didn't get the reports of customers in the\ncity.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you go back to the\nquestion I had asked you and was not finished getting\nyour position on. Jenkins requires report to the State.\nYou say the city was not within the zone of interest.\nBut from the point of view of the sellers, the\nout-of-state sellers of cigarettes, my goodness, would\nthey really want not only to have the burden of sending\na list of names to the State, but to every county and\nmunicipality? Isn't it the -- just as it is in New\nYork, there is a working relationship. The State gets\nall the names, and then it sends the names to the\ncities.\nYou -- you -- I -- you're suggesting that it\nwould be okay if the Jenkins Act had made it even more\nburdensome to the cigarette sellers by saying not only\ndo you have to disclose to the State but also to any\nmunicipality that independently taxes cigarettes?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: Justice Ginsburg, Congress\ncould have given the States power to share those lists,\nbut it did not under the Jenkins Act. And it's not\nclear that -- that -- even the agreement --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it -- we're told that\nNew York City and New York State have a tax information-\nsharing agreement pursuant to which the State does share\nthis information with the city.\nMR. BARNHOUSE: The -- the agreement, and\nit's quoted on page 6 of the response -- and I want to\nget this right -- says, Justice Ginsburg in paragraph 1\nof the quote, in footnote 6: \"Provided, that the\ndisclosure of that information is permissible under\nexisting laws and agreements.\" And this is proprietary\ninformation. These are customer lists.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what do you do\nwith -- what do you do with Justice Ginsburg's\nhypothetical? I mean, she can pursue her own question,\nbut I'm interested in the answer.\nHer question is, suppose the statute were\namended so that the information had to be given to the\ncity as well as to the State; would the case then be\ndifferent, hypothetical case?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: Yes, it would be different,\nbecause in that instance the city would be the --\nwould -- would as -- would -- would be the direct\nvictim, would be within the zone of interest of the\nstatute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are there any sanctions for\nfailing to comply with the Jenkins Act, just on its own,\nwithout having to go through RICO?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: Justice Scalia, it's a\nmisdemeanor violation and it has to be prosecuted by the\nU.S. Government. Those -- that's the extent of the\nJenkins Act. And -- and the -- and what the city has\ndone here, as Judge Winter noted in his dissent, is take\nthe misdemeanor Federal criminal law and bootstrap it\ninto RICO, seeking 300 cents on the dollar through mail\nand wire fraud.\nThese sales occurred on the Jemez Pueblo in\nNew Mexico. And it's my client's position, and it's no\nsecret, he says on his websites that he doesn't -- that\nthe Jenkins Act, the scope of the Jenkins Act does not\ninclude his sales. There -- there's a dispute with the\ncity on that, but it's not even clear that the State had\na right to get these names, much less the city.\nYet the city is claiming because it didn't\nget the names -- and if it had the names it claims a\nrecovery rate between 40 cents and 55 cents on the\ndollar -- it should be able to collect 300 cents on the\ndollar from a business that didn't owe them in the first\nplace.\nBecause the civil RICO has a separate\nstanding requirement separate from mail and wire fraud,\nas Justice O'Connor discussed in Holmes that it's not\njust the predicate act's standing requirement, but --\nbut the person injured in his business or property by\nreason of -- because Congress took this \"business or\nproperty\" language right out of the antitrust laws\nunchanged, the court in Hawaii interpreted that\nlanguage. The court drew a bright line. It was a\npragmatic line, a workable line, an important line, that\nthat business or property did not include injury to a\nsovereign interest.\nThe opportunity to collect taxes is a\nsovereign interest. The taxes themselves, once\ncollected or assessed, could be property, but not the\nopportunity. The injury flows either through the States\nor consumers and, therefore, is not proximate. These\nwebsites were not State-specific, much less\ncity-specific.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you don't -- you\ndon't think that proximate cause is satisfied only with\nrespect to the person who is supposed to be paying the\ntaxes? If there's some way in which someone else\ncontributes or makes it feasible or makes it more likely\nthat the person is not going to pay his taxes, that's\nnot automatically outside the scope of proximate cause,\nis it?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: It wouldn't automatically be\noutside the scope of proximate cause, but if -- if it\nwas action that made it more or less feasible. But it\nwould be unreasonable under this Court's decision in\nU.S. v. Boyle, where you -- where the Court held that\nyou cannot rely even on an agent for purposes of not\nfiling taxes -- it would be unreasonable for anyone to\nrely on language on a vendor's Internet -- commercial\nlanguage on a vendor's Internet website to -- to -- to\ndecide that for some reason they didn't have an\nobligation to pay.\nAnd these websites had language that said --\nthe city attached the -- the pages from the websites\nthemselves to the -- they were part of the record, the\nRICO record. I had those just a second ago and I can't\nseem to find them.\nBut the -- the website pages for my client\nspecifically had languages noted in the briefs that said\nthese are not city-specific or State-specific, that --\nthat you need to contact -- you should contact your\nState officials for purposes of determining what your\nindividual obligations are regarding possession and tax.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How many people who buy\ncigarettes out of State come back to their home State\nand voluntarily pay the use tax?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: In the response to the\npetition, the city said it's a fraction, I believe, of\nthe people. They've also --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't there some exemption,\nanyway, for a couple of cartons?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: There is an exemption, yes,\nJustice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: For what, two cartons?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: Two cartons of cigarettes.\nAnd -- but -- but it's clear that possessory and use\ntaxes are a bear to collect for any government. And the\ncity here, as I -- as stated in the record, says even\nunder the best of circumstances, Justice Ginsburg, it\ncollects only 40 cents on the dollar, perhaps as much as\n55 --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it needs the names so\nit can collect anything. Otherwise, how is it -- how --\nhow would it ever know?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: It would rely on its\ncitizens to step forward and pay it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And they don't.\nMR. BARNHOUSE: And they don't. And that's\nthe intervening cause of the -- that's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It would probably cost them\nmore to collect than -- than it's worth the money, don't\nyou think, to sue individual citizens after they get the\nnames?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: It's a very expensive\nprocess, Your Honor, Justice Scalia, and it -- it's\ntedious. You get the names. You have to go through the\nnames and write. There's a cost involved in all that.\nThere's a lot of friction in that entire process.\nThere -- there are lots of reasons that, even when the\ncity gets the names and even under its allegations of\ncollection rates, Justice Ginsburg, very small, 40 cents\nto 55 cents on the dollar.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we know if these\nJenkins Act lists -- are they in fact maintained by the\nState?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: It -- it's my understanding,\nJustice Ginsburg, that the State would receive Jenkins\nAct reports from some vendors. Those can come in all\nsorts of different formats, some of it just stacks of\npaper perhaps. And it would be the State's\nresponsibility then to go through those, select which\nones were residents of the city of New York, and then\ndecide whether under existing laws it was even permitted\nto share this proprietary information with the city,\nbefore giving those to the city.\nIt would then be the city's responsibility\nto take the list given to it by the State and decide who\nhasn't paid. Then there's the exemption issue that\ncomes on top of that. And then go out and try to\ncollect these amounts, which they allege to have done in\nat least two instances.\nFinally, the policy -- I'm sorry. The\npolicy that this Court adopted in Hawaii makes a --\nmakes very much sense, as recognized by courts who have\nlooked at issues such as additional fire protection,\npayment of -- of public benefits, other instances where\ngovernments have come forward and under RICO tried to\nbring a claim to recover actual out-of-pocket expenses,\novertime that was paid to police that had to monitor\nprotests against abortion clinics, public benefits paid\nto people who were not legally in the country and\nworking in agriculture.\nGovernments have brought those and the\ncircuit courts of appeals in both of those instances\nsaid those are injury to sovereign interests, citing\nHawaii, and not the kind of injury to business or\nproperty that Congress intended when it adopted RICO.\nIf there are no further questions, I'll\nreserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Koerner.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD J. KOERNER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. KOERNER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWith respect to the definition of property,\nthis goes back to Wyoming v. Oklahoma, where in an\noriginal jurisdiction case Wyoming sued the State of\nOklahoma on the ground that the State's regulation which\nattempted to require Oklahoma coal-fired generation\nplants to use 10 percent of Oklahoma coal, and prior to\nthe legislation all of Wyoming coal was used in the\ngeneration plant.\nWyoming sued in this Court and the defense\nwas that Wyoming didn't have an interest because it lost\nthe opportunity to collect taxes. This Court found\nstanding and allowed them to sue and successfully\nchallenge under the interstate commerce rule. That was\nbefore we get to Pasquantino. Justice Ginsburg is quite\nright --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Did -- was\nthere some statute at issue in that case which required\nnot just an interest, but an interest in property?\nMR. KOERNER: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well --\nMR. KOERNER: The -- it was just -- I was\njust going to -- yes, it was just a discussion of what\nwas the nature of Wyoming's interest. Was it\nsubstantial enough to allow them to sue, challenging the\nOklahoma statute.\nIn Pasquantino, though, the issue was\nforeclosed. In that particular case the issue of\ndefinition of property was the exact same issue that you\nhave in the RICO case. Indeed, mail and wire fraud is a\npredicate for RICO. In that case there was, as Justice\nGinsburg noted, a criminal prosecution based on the\nimportation of alcohol into Canada from Maryland. The\ncharge was wire fraud.\nAnd first, there were two issues: One, the\nrevenue rule, which is not relevant here. But the first\nissue was whether or not the opportunity to collect\ntaxes which Canada lost, whether that was an injury to\nproperty. And there was a long discussion by this Court\nequating the lost opportunity with embezzlement from the\nCanadian treasury and pointing out in the definition of\nBlack's and the Webster's definition that property\nincludes not only that which you actually have, but that\nwhich you were denied the opportunity.\nIn this particular case, the reason we don't\nhave the taxes is because of the act of fraud as we\nallege of the defendant. It's a little tough --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, because\nof -- because of what?\nMR. KOERNER: The fraud of the defendant.\nIt's a little hard to argue when you've created the\nsituation so we can't collect that an inability to\ncollect then becomes no property. After Pasquantino\nthis Court decided the Anza case, which I'll discuss for\nboth issues.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Before you get to Anza,\nthis might be a good time to ask because I don't think\nwe focused on this in Pasquantino. But if in fact the\nfailure of a State to collect a tax is property, then\nwhy isn't every corporation that files an income tax\nreturn and makes two false statements automatically\nliable for RICO? I mean --\nMR. KOERNER: As long as they meet the\ndefinition of --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that would mean the\nStates have a new method, which I don't think they use,\na new method of collecting treble taxes from anyone who\nmakes two false statements or a false statement in two\nincome tax returns, and it would seem to me that would\nhave vast repercussions. I mean, it might be very\nbeneficial; the States are having a deficit crisis;\nbut --\nMR. KOERNER: If people --\nJUSTICE BREYER: How, how -- why would it\nnot be --\nMR. KOERNER: Why would --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But they left -- they don't\nhave the RICO predicate, not paying your State taxes.\nBut in effect you would read into the RICO\npredicate protecting States.\nMR. KOERNER: This is precisely what\nhappened in Anza.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That may be, but nobody\nfocused on this issue. So -- so that's what's bothering\nme. What is the -- what is the stopping place?\nMR. KOERNER: If you're --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Or is there one? And if\nthere is none, how do we reconcile this view of --\nthey're suggesting a stopping place, Anza and\nPasquantino to the contrary. Right. But they're\nsuggesting a stopping place on a matter that hasn't come\nup.\nMR. KOERNER: But they're suggesting --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Or focused on. It's come\nup but not focused on.\nMR. KOERNER: But they're suggesting a\nstopping place which is inconsistent with the actual\nlanguage of the RICO --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So in your view\nCalifornia --\nMR. KOERNER: Well, may I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- which has a $10 billion\ndeficit, could go through, find every instance where a\ncorporation made two false statements in two tax\nreturns, one in each, and collect treble what they're\nowed.\nMR. KOERNER: If there is a systematic\nunderstatement under the statute, that's exactly --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't say systematic\nunderstatement.\nMR. KOERNER: It says --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It says two --\nMR. KOERNER: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- predicate acts.\nMR. KOERNER: And in these --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the predicate acts are\na deliberate false statement.\nMR. KOERNER: And indeed that -- that is\nwhat Congress intended. If you look --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If they did, then why\ndidn't they put in not paying your State tax returns as\na predicate act?\nMR. KOERNER: Well, in fact what they put in\nin 1978 was the Contraband Cigarette Trafficking --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, well, that cuts against\nyou.\nMR. KOERNER: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because if they put in one,\nyour theory -- they don't even need, whether they need\nthat or not. Your theory applies to every tax, every\ntax.\nMR. KOERNER: Well, the reason they put it\nin was to increase the criminal penalties as well as\nrecognize the civil penalties.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, but go back to my\nquestion.\nMR. KOERNER: The importation -- yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: My question is, forget the\ncigarette taxes. If I accept your argument, am I then\nsaying that California, New York, and every other State\nthat's owed money by corporations in their taxes can go\nthrough, look for two tax returns that have a false\nstatement in them that were mailed in, and thereby\ncollect RICO damages?\nMR. KOERNER: Yes, that's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's a pretty\nfar-reaching --\nMR. KOERNER: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do you know anybody, any\ncourt that has ever said that?\nMR. KOERNER: Well, the issue hasn't been\nraised. But the -- but the -- RICO has been\nconsistently interpreted by this Court in an\nexpansionist mode, and despite that Congress has not\ntruncated it except in the one area of securities\nviolation and only because they found that there were\nample remedies in securities law, and because they\nthought it was inappropriate to use exclusively mail and\nwire fraud.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why would --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why should that help?\nJUSTICE BREYER: If Congress wanted that\nresult, why didn't they put in as a predicate act not\npaying your income tax or not paying your State tax?\nMR. KOERNER: Because they had a more\ngeneral definition, and they wanted the broadest\npossible interpretation. But the Cigarette Contraband\nTrafficking Act was put into RICO as a predicate crime.\nThe sole economic injury in that act is lost taxes to\nthe State and the city. It's the only economic injury.\nIt's hard to say that Congress didn't contemplate this\nwhen, in addition to the general definition, they put\nthis in.\nIn addition, the Jenkins Act was passed in\n1949 precisely for this problem, so it was on\ncongressional minds.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but Congress said --\nwe were just told by counsel for the Petitioner,\nCongress said you can only -- only the Federal\nprosecutor can sue for violations of Jenkins --\nMR. KOERNER: Correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- not New York City, not\nNew York State --\nMR. KOERNER: Correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and it's a\nmisdemeanor.\nMR. KOERNER: Correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And now you -- you are\nsaying the Jenkins Act gives you a basis to go after\nwhat are basically aiders and abettors of use tax\nviolations?\nMR. KOERNER: No. What we're saying is the\nJenkins Act is some evidence of the state of mind of the\ndefendant when he commits this fraud. What we are\nsaying is he is aware that he has an obligation to file\nreports with the State indicating both the identity of\nthe seller and the identity of the purchaser. Our\npredicate act is not Jenkins. Our predicate act is wire\nand mail fraud. Even if Jenkins did not exist, we would\nstill have a wire and mail fraud cause of action based\non the representations of the seller, which is that all\nthe sales are tax-free.\nWhat Jenkins does through the cooperation\nagreement is it gives us the mechanism to collect these\ntaxes when they're complied with. If the defendant by\nactive intervention does not file and instead advertises\nno sales tax required, he is preventing us from --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But do you know -- do we\nknow that? Do we know whether the Petitioner has in\nfact filed the Jenkins Act report with New York State?\nMR. KOERNER: No. We have -- we have\nalleged that he has not -- not filed one report with New\nYork State. Indeed, he has actively represented in the\nwebsite that he has no obligation to file the report,\nand that any information that he obtains from the\npurchaser is confidential.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So I think that\ntheir response to the mail and fraud is, you're right,\nit is all mail -- it is all mail fraud. All these tax\nviolations, in fact every one, you mail in your tax\nreturn normally.\nMR. KOERNER: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So all of these would be\nmail fraud. But mail fraud is not a treble damages\nstatute. And therefore the question is who will\nprosecute, State or Federal? So normally it's State if\nit's a State tax. But it's one thing to say Congress\ndidn't care about that and quite another thing to say\nthat Congress didn't care if the States were going to\nuse this in order to collect three times what the taxes\nare owed. And so they're looking for a way to cut off\nthis tax liability for ordinary, simpleminded tax --\nfailure to pay your State taxes. And that's why they've\nhit on this idea of the antitrust. I don't know if\nthat's a satisfactory idea. I don't see the solution.\nI think I see the problem.\nMR. KOERNER: But in the antitrust case in\nthe State of Hawaii, the reason there that the State was\nnot allowed to sue was not because of the injury. It\nwas not -- it was the directness of the injury. This\nCourt pointed out the fact that there was the\npossibility of duplicative recoveries, and the State of\nHawaii was acting on behalf of the consumers.\nHere, we have a direct injury. The city was\nthe only one injured as a --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it was injured\nby the consumer's failure -- it was injured by the\nconsumer's failure to pay the taxes. That is an\nintervening cause.\nMR. KOERNER: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, why shouldn't\nthat be the end of the causation chain?\nMR. KOERNER: Because it's -- while the\nconsumer has failed, we are suing the seller because he\nset up the ambiance, the environment for the consumer\nnot to pay. It is his --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're suing him for\nsetting up the ambiance?\nMR. KOERNER: Yes. He is the one who\ncreated the fraud, by leading the consumer to believe\nthey didn't have an obligation to pay. We are suing\nbased on impedence with the opportunity to collect\ntaxes, where there are three parties to this\ntransaction --\nJUSTICE ALITO: In order to -- in order\nto -- to prevail on that theory, would you have to prove\nthat these -- these alleged misrepresentations in fact\ncaused people not to pay taxes?\nMR. KOERNER: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: You would have -- you would\nhave to prove that?\nMR. KOERNER: Yes, and that's something we\ncould establish at trial, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And you think you could\nprove that?\nMR. KOERNER: Absolutely, because the\nresponse rate of individuals on their own when the\nJenkins report is not filed is extremely low. Yet when\nthe Jenkins report is filed they do --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What -- what percentage of\nthe -- of the residents of New York State or New York\nCity voluntarily pay a use tax on their income tax\nreturns for items that they purchase on the Internet?\nMR. KOERNER: I don't know the answer to\nthat. I know with respect to --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Would you make a guess?\nMR. KOERNER: Probably very low. But in\nthis particular --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So how can you call it -- I\nmean, part of the problem with calling it property is\nthere -- there is such a low chance of recovery of the\namount owed here.\nEven if the Jenkins Act filing had been\nmade, you still have to -- have to assume that this --\nnumber one, you have to assume that the State would turn\nthe list over to the city, which the State isn't\nrequired to do.\nMR. KOERNER: But we do have a cooperation\nagreement.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that may be, but the\nState isn't required to, and the State can terminate\nthat agreement whenever it likes.\nBut, secondly, after you get the information\nwe have to assume that you're going to move against\nthese people.\nMR. KOERNER: If you look in footnote 8 of\nour brief, we point out, even in this case, when we've\nsettled with parties and they've turned over the\ninformation we have been able to recover significant\namounts of the taxes owed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it -- does it\naffect your ambiance theory that the website has the\nlanguage that your friend told us is on it, that you\nhave to -- you know, this is -- viability varies from\nState to State or whatever the exact language is?\nMR. KOERNER: No. No.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That still creates\nthe ambiance?\nMR. KOERNER: When you look at the website\nand you have flashing lights that say \"No taxes\nrequired,\" indeed we allege in the complaint that the\nentire business model is predicated on the fact that\nthey don't have to pay State and city taxes.\nThe wide difference allows for the profit\nfor the seller and a savings for the buyer. That is\nwhat we allege and, given the opportunity, we can prove\nthat.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could you satisfy Justice\nBreyer's concern -- and maybe the answer is not -- by\nsaying that if there were a corporation that went around\nto California taxpayers and said, we have a way to avoid\ntaxes, that then there would be a RICO violation, and\nthat would be closer to your case?\nMR. KOERNER: It would be -- it would be\neasier to prove, but I can't dispute Justice Breyer's\nfact pattern, that if you had an underpayment through a\nfraudulent return that it may be a predicate for RICO,\nand indeed --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- well, you're\ncertainly consistent and persistent on that point.\nMR. KOERNER: Yes. That would be a better\nfactor --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But it -- it would seem to\nme -- it would seem to me that I gave you a way to\ndifferentiate this case. And isn't that consistent with\nRICO because we have a very specific enterprise here?\nMR. KOERNER: Well, I do want to reiterate\nthe fact that, apart from the general language in this\ncase, we do have this Contraband Cigarette Trafficking\nAct, which I alluded to earlier. That -- that Act\nprecisely deals with the problem of underpayment of\ntaxes for cigarettes. It was passed in 1978 and then\namended in 2006 to include localities. It has very\nsevere penalties under RICO criminally. It allows for\nfines and forfeitures. But more important, you can use\nRICO civilly, and the only economic injury in that\nentire legislation is the lost opportunity to collect\ntaxes. So it's difficult to say that Congress was not\naware of this problem, aware of its potential scope.\nAnd while I understand this Court's\nfrustration, it seems to me, as this Court has said in\nmany cases, including the last one, Boyle, it resides\nwith Congress to change it. If they feel there is a\nmisuse of this legislation and suits are exploding out\nof context in terms of what they contemplated, then they\nshould change it.\nYet --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the\ndefinition and giving scope and meaning to the concept\nof proximate cause is one that's in our bailiwick.\nMR. KOERNER: It is, but if you look at --\nChief Judge, if you look at how you've applied proximate\ncause in the past in Anza, in Holmes, what you said is\nthat there are other factors that are not associated\nwith the unlawful act, and therefore you didn't want\ncourts or juries to have to parse -- parse out\nlegitimate business problems and illegitimate business\nproblems because they become too complex.\nYou don't have that here. Here, you have\ndirect injury to the city, and it's an easy calculation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we know -- you gave an\ninstance in your brief or two instances of successful\nattempts to recoup from the taxpayer, that is the\ncigarette buyer. Did those come about because the city\nreceived the Jenkins Act list from the State? How did\nthe city get --\nMR. KOERNER: In the particular cases that\nwe mentioned in footnote 8, they were parts of\nsettlements for the people who had, similar to this\nparticular defendant, had advertised as tax-free, and we\nhad settled with those people to get the reports, and\nthen, based on the reports, we were able to track them\ndown.\nWhere we get the Jenkins -- where people\nvoluntarily disclose the Jenkins Act reports, we do\nfollow up aggressively, but the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you follow up by\nwriting them a letter and what your footnote 8 says is,\nwhen you wrote them a letter, about half of them\ncoughed -- coughed up the tax.\nMR. KOERNER: Correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They may have been the\nfoolish half. Did --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KOERNER: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Were the other -- were the\nother half pursued by the city?\nMR. KOERNER: Not yet, no.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not yet. I don't --\nMR. KOERNER: But that -- but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It can't be worth it. It\ncan't possibly be worth it.\nMR. KOERNER: Here's what would be worth it:\nIf we can stop the fraudulent practices that these\nsellers represent through the treble damages. The only\nbenefit that these Internet sellers have is the cost\nsaving as a consequence of the tax saving.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is what they're doing\nany different from what out-of-State mail order houses\nhave done in -- they set -- they set up in States\nwithout a sales tax, they ship into a State that has a\ncompensating use tax, that, apart from automobiles, I\ndon't know is ever collected.\nMR. KOERNER: Well, I would like to think\nthat those out-of-State sales entities don't exist\nsolely to try to deprive receiving States of tax. The\ndifference here is the entire business plan is based on\nnot paying tax.\nNow, RICO has been in business since 1970.\nYour decisions have expanded its use. As I indicated,\nthere has been no attempt to restrict it in any way,\nand, indeed, despite --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that's\nbecause in every one of those cases, or at least in many\nof them, we kind of wring our hands and say, well, we\ndon't have any choice, this is what Congress did, and\nwe're faithful to that intent.\nBut I guess, as I tried to point out\nearlier, this is a different question. This is the\nusual judicial application of concepts of proximate\ncause, and I would have thought concern about how broad\nRICO was written and how broadly it has been interpreted\nwould cause us to look very carefully to the proximate\ncause question.\nMR. KOERNER: But in the proximate cause\nequation, as you yourself have defined it, meaning the\nCourt, you've talked about unlawful issues and lawful\nissues. And as I indicated, where there's a combination\nyou don't want a Court to weigh what's lawful and\nunlawful.\nBut here our injury -- injury is solely the\nresult of an unlawful use. There are no intervening\nfactors.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No -- I don't\nunderstand that. The injury is directly caused by the\nconsumers who don't pay the taxes.\nMR. KOERNER: And I -- that's -- that's the\nway you frame it, I understand, but it can be equally\nframed by saying the injury is caused by the seller's\nmisrepresentation, which encourages the purchasers not\nto pay taxes.\nAnd if you look at the websites, there is no\ndoubt about what this --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So do you say then that\nproximate cause is in part established because of the\nspecific intent? Is that --\nMR. KOERNER: No. I'm saying --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm glad -- I'm glad\nyou said that, because the Associated Contractors said\nspecific intent is not --\nMR. KOERNER: I know. What I am saying is\nthat, given the opportunity to prove this, we can show\nthat the entire business model was intended never to\nhave any taxes paid on these transactions.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But in -- in the world and\nin the lexicon of proximate cause, why is there\nproximate cause because this was the business model?\nHow do I explain that in terms of proximate cause?\nThere's not specific intent.\nMR. KOERNER: There are no other intervening\ncauses between the fraud and the injury to the city. It\nis -- we lost an opportunity. Look --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I know. But there is no\nother -- take a case which was put to you as the seller\nwho has many reasons for selling from out of State.\nThey have a good catalog business, it's a\nwell-established name, and so it's not just to avoid\ntaxes. How is that different from what happened here?\nMR. KOERNER: Because in this case, they\ndon't have any other reason --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay, and in terms of\nproximate -- the universe of the law that we call\nproximate cause, how do you explain that? It's not\nspecific intent.\nMR. KOERNER: The law of proximate cause in\nthe case you described, you would have to consider all\nof the issues, some related to the transaction that\nyou're suing on, some not. If the mail order catalog\ncould show there were other reasons for their sales, not\nattributable to the unlawful RICO definition, then it's\nthe type of injury you don't want to make an inquiry to.\nBut if you have --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Reason on whose part? Some\nreason on whose part? On the seller's part or on the\nNew York buyers' part? They will be -- the New York\nbuyer is doing it because it's cheaper because he is not\ngoing to pay taxes on it. But it seems to me the seller\ncouldn't care less whether the buyer pays taxes on it or\nnot. So long as he pays the money for the cigarettes,\nthe seller has gotten what the seller wanted.\nMR. KOERNER: Except that the buyer -- the\nseller is advertising it as tax-free. He's not --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's a mail order\nhouse and they put a little line on it, says: By the\nway, if you live out of State, no taxes, no sales taxes.\nThen they're also subject to RICO prosecution?\nMR. KOERNER: As I said, it's a harder case\nbecause there may be other reasons why that mail order\nhouse is -- is successful, just like you said in Anza,\njust like you said in Holmes. But in this case there's\nonly -- it's the whole model. There's only one reason\nwhy they're successful.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, maybe that isn't\ncompletely true. Maybe it's a matter of convenience, at\nleast theoretically. You buy stuff over the Internet,\nyou buy these advertised cigarettes, the price seems all\nright, and you don't -- whether you pay the tax or not\nis your decision.\nMR. KOERNER: Except that the seller --\nthat's not the facts in this case. The seller\naffirmatively represented that there are no taxes. He\ntold the consumer, and then kept the consumer's identity\nunknown --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, we were --\nMR. KOERNER: -- by deliberately not filing\nas required by Federal statute, and places us in a -- in\nthe position in the circle of having no knowledge of who\nthe buyer is, having affirmative misrepresentation, and\nwe are the only one in this transaction who are directly\ninjured.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To whom was the\npermanent misrepresentation made?\nMR. KOERNER: The customers.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Usually you're not liable\nfor misrepresentation unless it causes -- it's relied\non. You really think that the -- that a large\npercentage of the people who were getting this stuff\nreally, really were gulled into believing that New York\nState was somehow being done out of taxes?\nMR. KOERNER: Yes, because of the\nrepresentation that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Really?\nMR. KOERNER: -- they would never contact\nthe State with any information concerning the\ntransaction. That's exactly what they did. Everybody\nunderstands in the nature of these purchasing exactly\nwhat it's about.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, I am sure the purchaser\nknows: I'm not going to pay taxes, even though I should\npay taxes. But you're -- you're telling me that the\nonly reason the purchaser doesn't pay taxes is because\nof this misrepresentation that you don't have to\npurchase -- you don't have to pay taxes. I've known a\nlot of New Yorkers, and not many of them are that\ngullible.\nMR. KOERNER: What I'm telling you, that\nit's probably easier to go to the corner store and\nobtain a package of cigarettes than order it over the\nInternet. What I'm saying, you have to look at the\ncontext of the facts. The facts were affirmative\nmisstatements by the seller.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But what if the seller\ndidn't make those misstatements but just says -- the\nwhole operation is set up exactly as this one is, but\nthey don't have that statement in there; they just say:\nGet advice from your lawyer about whether you need to\npay taxes or not.\nAnd what if that was the -- that was exactly\nthe -- and then they all got the advice, and the lawyer\nsays: They'll never catch you if you don't pay it.\nMR. KOERNER: I think it's a question of\nproof, and if we're able to show that these individuals\nthought it was tax-free, then we should be able to\npursue -- let me just say, forget the Jenkins Act. You\nhave the Cigarette Trafficking Act. That is within\nRICO. That sole economic injury is loss of revenue to\nthe State and the city.\nSo if we allege the Cigarette Trafficking\nAct -- it was not applicable at the time of this case;\nit was amended to apply to localities slightly after,\nbut if we predicated the case on that, would you still\nsay there's a proximate cause issue when you have\nCongress's express intent to allow that to be a\npredicate to the RICO count?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't want silence\nto be interpreted as acquiescence, but --\nMR. KOERNER: No, no, no. It was\nrhetorical. I wasn't --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. KOERNER: I'm just trying to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just to get back at\nmaybe the same point Justice Kennedy was raising, which\nis you're focusing on -- you keep saying: The whole\npurpose of this, look at their website.\nBut the issue is proximate cause, and if\nyou've got to go through the individual consumer, it's\neither proximate cause or not. And if the -- if the\nindirect nature of what they're doing because the direct\ncause is the consumer's failure to pay, it doesn't seem\nto me that their intent is pertinent.\nMR. KOERNER: But we're seeking -- the\ninjury is the opportunity to collect, which we've been\ndenied, which is the Cigarette Traffic Act contemplates.\nIndeed, if you look at the legislative history of that\nAct, the sole purpose was to make it a very, very\nserious felony, and with civil undertones, in order to\ndiscourage the act as a disincentive, so that this\ntrafficking, which is a major problem, started to be\nreduced.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I'm -- I'm not sure.\nLet's talk about the contraband cigarette trafficking.\nI'm not sure that these people would be in violation of\nit. It makes it unlawful for any person knowingly to\nship or transport, also receive, possess, sell,\ndistribute, or purchase, cigarettes which bear no\nevidence of payment of applicable State or local\ncigarette taxes.\nMR. KOERNER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But there is no applicable\nState or local cigarette tax upon the shipment of these\ncigarettes.\nMR. KOERNER: But if the shipment is done\nwith the intent of avoiding taxes, which was\ncontemplated by this statute --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's not what it says.\nIt makes it unlawful to knowingly ship it when they bear\nno evidence of payment of applicable taxes, and --\nMR. KOERNER: That's correct. There's a\nquestion of proof.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- there is no applicable\ntaxes at the time that they ship it.\nMR. KOERNER: But if you look at the\nlegislative history, it was directly --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I don't look at\nlegislative history.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KOERNER: May I address the rest of you?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why is it that you\nhaven't argued -- why haven't you --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I don't see a difference --\nwould appreciate if you would tell me the difference\nbetween your argument as to this situation and the\ntypical Internet site where I think a lot of people buy\ngoods on the Internet, because they're convenient and\nalso because they know that they're not going to have to\npay State sales tax when they make those purchases.\nMR. KOERNER: In those cases, you have\nestablished companies and you may have to look behind to\nsee what is the reason; why are they at -- I assume they\nhave other businesses that are legitimate. This\nparticular enterprise has no legitimate aspect.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why is that relevant as far\nas cause is concerned?\nJUSTICE ALITO: You have a company that is\nselling televisions, cameras, whatever over the Internet\nand they -- you know, you put your -- you put in your\ncredit card information or whatever, and then it tells\nyou, \"sales tax due,\" and if they have no outlet in the\nState, it says \"sales taxes due: Zero.\" What is the\ndifference between that situation and this situation?\nMR. KOERNER: Well, first of all, in time,\nthe Internet has raised many issues. It's unclear how\nCongress feels about this. We have legitimate\nenterprise.\nBut cigarettes have been a particular focus,\nand I think, in effect, you cannot use the general\nargument as to the Internet, when you have congressional\nlegislation which, one, under the Jenkins Act, was\nspecifically passed in 1949 because of transactions like\nthis, where States were -- were being deprived of the\nrevenues through the interstate shipments.\nAnd you have the traffic -- the Cigarette\nTrafficking Act which is, again, an expression by\nCongress that they want these individuals to be put out\nof business. That's exactly what RICO is about.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Judge Winter in the\nSecond Circuit said the State appears uninterested in\nenforcing the Jenkins Act and may not collate or\nmaintain accurate records of reports from out-of-State\nvendors. What -- what was the basis for his statement\nthat the State appears uninterested?\nMR. KOERNER: The State has records, but\nthey -- they've been uninterested in this issue for\npolitical reasons.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Barnhouse, you have four minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RANDOLPH H. BARNHOUSE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. BARNHOUSE: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nJustice Stevens, the city brought exactly\nthat case, where one of the 50 defendants here was a\ndefendant that didn't say sales are tax-free, and that\ncase was similarly dismissed by the district court, and\nthat dismissal was affirmed by the Second Circuit.\nJustice Breyer, in Illinois v. Fawaz, the\nStates was going after $14,500 in back sales and\ngasoline taxes. After having prosecuted the individual,\nthey were seeking civil RICO damages, in that Seventh\nCircuit case, when the Seventh Circuit became the first\ncircuit to say, we -- we hesitantly believe that the\ncase could go forward beyond a motion to dismiss.\nJUSTICE BREYER: On cause, why isn't it a\ncausal connection for them to say, look, your clients\ndon't tell them who's bought it. They're supposed to,\nbut they don't. And if we got the information, we go\nwrite a letter to the people, and half of them would\npay.\nMR. BARNHOUSE: That would be but for; But\nfor your failure to give us the names --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah.\nMR. BARNHOUSE: -- we would have collected.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But why isn't that a direct\napplicant action, but for foreseeable?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: This Court said, in Holmes,\nthat but for is insufficient.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah. I know, but there is\nmore here. It is also foreseeable proximate cause. I\nmean, it is absolutely foreseeable, not just but for.\nMR. BARNHOUSE: This was an Internet\nwebsite, Justice Breyer, that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Forget the website. What\nif there had been no website?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: Was it foreseeable --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is it foreseeable that,\nwhen they don't know who owes the money, that the people\nwon't pay, but when they know who owes the money, they\ncan write them a letter, and half pay?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: And is it foreseeable that\nno one will pay or that some will pay? Some will pay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Some pay. Some don't.\nThey have the numbers there. They get more than half.\nMR. BARNHOUSE: It's -- it's foreseeable\nthat some won't pay. That's foreseeable, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you get half-treble\ndamages. What is that? One-and-a-half damages.\nMR. BARNHOUSE: But, at that point, it\nbecomes speculative, Justice Scalia, and it's -- it's\nforeseeable that some won't pay, but it's also\nforeseeable that some people won't pay --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And, if you put people in\nfront of railroad trains and half survive, then it's\nspeculative?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: I'm sorry? I didn't --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, if you put somebody\nin front of a railroad train and half survive because\nthey jumped, does that make it a speculative cause?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: No, Your Honor, but, in that\ninstance, I would be the one pushing the person, and not\nthe one -- I would be the person, as in Pasquantino, who\ndid not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And you say it's\nforeseeable that they won't get a lot of money. And\nthat's what they're arguing?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, what's the answer to\nthat?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: That it's foreseeable that\nthey won't get a lot of money?\nJUSTICE BREYER: The reason is because of\nwhat your clients did, so it's but for and foreseeable.\nMR. BARNHOUSE: It's but for, and it is\nforeseeable that some -- some taxpayers in New York will\nnot pay. Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: End of case. Now, we go to\nthe damage section.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But for -- no, no, your\nresponse is, but for, plus foreseeable, is not a\ndefinition of proximate cause.\nMR. BARNHOUSE: But it's not a definition of\nproximate cause.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You need more than that.\nMR. BARNHOUSE: That, itself is not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I took torts a long time\nago. I thought that was part of it.\nMR. BARNHOUSE: What -- what the Court said\nin Associated General Contractors is, even if it's not\nonly foreseeable, but that's your intent, but that--\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. There can be other\nthings that cut it off. Proximate cause. Foreseeable.\nNo kind of an event that would cut the causal chain,\nlike some odd fluke or something.\nMR. BARNHOUSE: But --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No policy reason or others\nfor cutting the chain. I mean, it's Torts 1 in 1962,\nokay?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't it -- well, I\ndon't know, maybe it's more -- but isn't it a\nproposition that you don't rely on illegal conduct, that\nthe -- the assumption of illegal conduct cuts the chain?\nIn other words, there's only proximate cause\nif you assume people are going to not pay taxes that\nthey're due, contrary to law, and that that breaks the\nproximate cause chain?\nMR. BARNHOUSE: It -- if we assume that --\nthat the assumption that they will pay their taxes\nbreaks the proximate cause? I'm not -- I'm sorry --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, that you have\nto -- in order to maintain -- this is a helpful\nquestion.\nIn order --\nMR. BARNHOUSE: Yes, sir. That's why --\nthat's why I'm trying to understand.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In order to maintain\nthe chain of connection, I thought you cannot rely, for\none of those links in the chain, that a party is going\nto commit illegal action.\nMR. BARNHOUSE: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's wrong. I\nmean, at least for civil torts, you can -- there are a\nlot of cases where the landlord leaves out the bulb\nin the -- in the stairway and one of the residents gets\nmugged and he sues the landlord and wins, even though\nthere is an intervening criminal act.\nNow, maybe what you want to argue is that\nthat -- that has never been applied, to my knowledge, to\neither criminal liability or -- or penal provisions, and\nthat maybe the -- an intervening criminal act does cut\noff causality, for purposes of penal statute, such as --\nsuch as RICO. That would be a reasonable argument.\nMR. BARNHOUSE: That's a great argument,\nJustice Scalia.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And a good place to\nend.\nThank you, counsel.\n"
