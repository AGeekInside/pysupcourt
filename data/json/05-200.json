        "content": "(11:05 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in 05-200, Empire Healthchoice Assurance v.\nMcVeigh.\nMr. Shelley.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY F. SHELLEY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SHELLEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nEmpire's complaint in this case raises a\nFederal claim. As a result, it arises under Federal\nlaw. This case involves fringe benefits for Federal\nemployees provided by the Federal Government. The case\ninvolves enforcement of a Federal Government contract.\nThe same contract is rooted in a Federal statute, and\nthe money collected here will go to the Federal\nTreasury. Nonetheless, the court of appeals held that\nthis case belonged in State court to be governed by\nState law. The court of appeals should be reversed.\nIn particular, this case concerns the\nreimbursement of health benefits by a Federal employee\nto his Federal Government health benefit plan, which is\nknown as the service benefit plan. That plan is\ngoverned by the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act,\nFEHBA, and is established through a Federal Government\ncontract.\nIn this case, Empire paid approximately\n$157,000 in benefits for certain injuries suffered by\nJoseph McVeigh, but the plan conditioned the payment of\nthose benefits on reimbursement in the event that a\nrecovery was made from a third party. Those terms are\npart of the Government contract, the reimbursement\nterms.\nThereafter --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you go back and\nbecause the -- the parties seem to have different views\nabout it? I think you said it was required by OPM to\nhave this reimbursement term, and the other side said\nthat there was no requirement from the Government\nagency that you include the reimbursement term.\nMR. SHELLEY: Under the statute -- Justice\nGinsburg, under the statute, the Office of Personnel\nManagement is charged with selecting the benefits and\nexclusions for this particular program and for this\nparticular plan. The statutory section is 8902(d).\nAnd those terms are -- OPM has the final authority over\nthose terms and those terms are placed in a statement\nof benefits which the -- which this statute also says\nshall become part of the contract and are attached and\nincorporated into the contract. So the final authority\nover the benefits and the exclusions --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that -- all that says\nis that OPM looked at these terms and it thought they\nwere okay. It's not -- it doesn't show that OPM\nrequired these -- this as a condition for Empire to\nserve as the insurer.\nMR. SHELLEY: Well, it's -- our obligations\nare through the contract, and our only obligations here\nare the ones in the contract. And that contract --\nthat provision is in the contract. And as a result of\nthat, we were -- we were mandated to enforce that\nprovision. If the Government wanted that provision\nout, it had the final authority to take it out, and it\nwould only have been included if, as a matter of\nauthorization, OPM wanted it in there.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that's different from\nputting it in. I mean, you want to change what you --\nwhat you allege, that -- that it's mandated by the\nGovernment to simply the Government, although it had\nauthority to eliminate it, did not do so? If -- you know,\nthat's a different -- different assertion.\nMR. SHELLEY: The -- I think it makes no\ndifference. The fact of the reality is that it's in\nthe contract.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'll assume it's the latter\nthen.\nMR. SHELLEY: The reality is that the --\nthese reimbursement terms are in all the contracts\nessentially of the FEHBA carriers, and as a result, I\nthink it can be assumed that it's the policy of the\nGovernment that they should be in here. And the result\nof them is that they save the Government money. So it\ndoes make good Government policy to have these\nprovisions in -- in the contracts to begin with.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But this is a fairly\nindirect way of establishing a Federal cause of action.\nI mean, it -- it's a preemption provision. Why isn't\nit reasonable to assume Congress thought there was no\nneed for a Federal cause of action? Because it's a\ncontract action. State courts handle those every day,\nand they assumed they'd be handled by State court.\nMR. SHELLEY: I think the Court's decision in\nJackson Transit sets up the framework for that, and\nthat is, that Congress did assume there would be a\ncontract cause of action, but --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I noticed you\nreferred in your brief to the Jackson Transit line of\nauthority. Do you know how many times Jackson Transit\nhas been cited in the last 20 years by this Court?\nMR. SHELLEY: It has not been applied again\nsince then, but we would say it's settled law as a\nresult.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not been cited.\nI think it's never been applied and it's not been\ncited once in 20 years. So what's the line of\nauthority?\nMR. SHELLEY: Well, it's four or five cases\nthat Jackson Transit was built on, for instance, the\nMachinists case v. Central Airlines, which came out of\nthe 1960's. In those cases, for instance, they -- the\nprinciple is simple and it's a strong one, and that is\nthat Congress assumes that a -- when it calls for the\ncreation of a -- a contract in a statute, that it will\nbe enforceable just as with ordinary contracts.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Those cases came from the\ndays when we were also quite willing to imply Federal\ncauses of action in statutes that had nothing to do\nwith the Government, you know, 10b-5 and things of that\nsort. I thought we had put all of that behind us. You\nwant us to go back to that bygone age.\nMR. SHELLEY: No, I don't think so, Justice\nScalia. The -- the Court in Jackson Transit\nspecifically differentiated between Congress assuming\nthere was a contract cause of action whenever it calls\nfor the creation of a contract and separately implying\na cause of action. That's different because that --\nthat has to -- in doing that, the Court has to create a\ncause of action in the first place, but Congress is\nassumed to want contracts to be enforceable when it\ncalls for the creation of the contracts in a Federal\nstatute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We're not talking\nabout the contract between you and the Federal\nGovernment. We're talking about some other agreement\nbetween you and an individual employee.\nMR. SHELLEY: No. We're talking about the\ncontract between us and the Government because it's\nthat contract that contains the reimbursement terms,\nand when the enrollee enrolls in the Federal program,\nhe or she takes on the obligation of complying with all\nthe terms of the Government contract.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that may give\nrise to a separate agreement, a related agreement, if\nyou will, between you and the employee. But it's not\n-- it's not a -- you're not the Government. The\nemployee is not the Government, at least not for these\npurposes. So why is it a Government contract?\nMR. SHELLEY: Because the -- the underlying\nterms are part of the Government contract and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if the Government\nsays -- Congress says, we think OPM should have a\nrecreation center for its employees and it should have\nall these things, and then OPM enters into a contract\nwith a company that runs recreation centers -- okay --\nthat's a contract with the Government. And then that\nentity enters into a contract with somebody else to\nsupply the basketball hoops. Would you say that that\nlast contract is a Government contract?\nMR. SHELLEY: The subcontract?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. SHELLEY: I would not say it's a contract\nwith the Government, and that's not our situation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if the provision\n-- even if at some point Congress said, and besides,\nyou know, the basketball hoops should be -- you know,\nmade in America as opposed to somewhere else and, you\nknow, specifies the terms of the subcontract.\nMR. SHELLEY: It's not a Government contract.\nThe Government contract is the contract between the\nparty with the Government, and that's what we have here\nand that's what we're seeking to enforce.\nBut I would point out that cases like Jackson\nTransit and the Central Airlines case -- the case --\nthe party suing wasn't really suing on the contract\neven. It was -- the case emanated from the contract,\nand as a result, the Court, nonetheless, held it arose\nunder Federal -- Federal law. In this case, the -- the\ncase is directly on the contract itself. So it's a\nmuch closer connection to the Government terms.\nUnder the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's nothing in the\nstatute that speaks about a Federal forum. And if you\nlook at this entire picture, you're seeking\nreimbursement, and you're seeking reimbursement based\non a tort recovery. And why wouldn't the most\nsensible, the most natural thing for a legislature, if\nthey thought about it, be to say, well, that claim for\nreimbursement ought to come in on the coattails of the\ntort claim? You don't need to make a whole separate\nFederal case out -- out of it. Why would Congress want\nthese claims to be subject to a separate Federal case?\nMR. SHELLEY: Justice Ginsburg, every other\ntype of claim under this program is in Federal court\nalready, denials of benefits cases, disputes between\nthe carrier and the United States. Only a sliver of\nlawsuits, these reimbursement suits, are -- are left.\nAnd it would be anomalous to -- for Congress to have\nwanted those to be in State court.\nBut even aside from that, a Federal forum\noffers the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it's because there's\nan anterior lawsuit that everything rides on that State\ncourt suit. There wouldn't be any recovery from which\nyou could claim reimbursement were it not for that\nState court lawsuit.\nMR. SHELLEY: The reality is that a\nstraightforward Federal lawsuit and a Federal rule that\nthese -- these reimbursement provisions are\nstraightforwardly enforceable through Federal claims\nmeans that they will -- the reimbursement will be\ncollected efficiently and correctly.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could you --\nfollowing up on Justice Ginsburg's question, could you\nintervene asserting rights of subrogation in the\nunderlying tort suit that your covered beneficiary\nbrought in State court?\nMR. SHELLEY: Conceivably, but the Federal\nquestion statute allows us to raise Federal claims in\nFederal court, and through it, Congress has determined\nthat if the case turns on Federal law, that the Federal\nforum is an appropriate forum for that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, wouldn't it be\nmore efficient for you to intervene in the pending\nState suit and get it all resolved at once rather than\nwaiting until your beneficiary gets a recovery and then\nstarting a whole other Federal suit over this somewhat\nsubsidiary subrogation point?\nMR. SHELLEY: No, because in many States --\nmany States don't allow reimbursement altogether. They\nhave anti-subrogation policies as well, and the reality\nis, is that what --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, at that point,\nyou'd be able to assert your argument under the Federal\npreemption provision that says, in my view somewhat\nsurprisingly, that these contract terms preempt State\nlaw.\nMR. SHELLEY: Yes, and we've fought many\nbattles on those fronts in the State courts. And the\nreality is that the Federal forum with its familiarity\nwith Federal law, its solicitude towards Federal law is\nthe appropriate forum in these cases, more so than the\nState court. And what may seem like an efficient --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You don't have any\nsuch problem here. There's no conflict between the New\nYork law -- you certainly could have gone into that\nlawsuit and --\nMR. SHELLEY: Well, no conflict is required,\nfor instance, under the Jackson Transit analysis. The\nanalysis is, is this a pervasively Federal regime to\nstart with, and if so, it's a Federal claim whether\nthere's a conflict or not. And so a conflict is really\nunnecessary.\nBut the other point is that with the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I could see if this were\n-- what we were talking about everything is -- the\ninsurance of a Federal employee and questions about\ncoverage, questions about benefits, all of that between\nthe employee and the carrier. But this comes up\nbecause we have a third party who enters the picture in\nan estate law claim. So I don't think you can just\nsay, well, everything is -- this whole thing is -- is\nall a Federal contract.\nMR. SHELLEY: Your Honor, there is no --\nthere's no requirement in the preemption provision\neither for a conflict. I mean, Congress went back to\nthe -- to the drafting table in 1998 and said, we want\nState law to be preempted whether or not there's a\nconflict in this particular situation. So --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That would have been\na good time for them to say we want a Federal --\nFederal court jurisdiction over these causes of actions\nif that's what they had in mind, but they didn't do\nthat.\nMR. SHELLEY: Well, first of all, there have\n-- there was no dispute whatsoever that these types of\ncases could be brought in Federal court in 1998.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, there sure was.\nFor those who like to look at the legislative history,\nthe House report said that -- again, it's very curious\nlanguage. It said, this change will help strengthen\nthe case in favor of Federal jurisdiction, or something\nlike that.\nMR. SHELLEY: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, since when is\nCongress trying to strengthen -- they either decide\nit's going to be Federal jurisdiction or not. They\ndon't try to make arguments.\nMR. SHELLEY: There had been no dispute about\nwhether reimbursement claims could be brought in\nFederal court. The courts -- the courts were in\nagreement on that. What there was a dispute about was\nwhether denials of benefits cases could be removed from\nState court to Federal court. And what Congress did\nwas it followed the ERISA model and changed the\npreemption provision because the preemption provision\nwas what had been giving the courts problems about the\nremoval issue. And so Congress did, I think, what the\ncourts told it to do, was get rid of some language in\nthe preemption provision that is hampering Federal\njurisdiction. Congress did that and created Federal\njurisdiction.\nNonetheless, now we come up with a new\ndispute that had never been a problem before --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's sort of queer\nterminology anyway. When Congress has already decided\nthat there should be Federal jurisdiction. It would seem\nvery strange for Congress to say this strengthens the\ncase for Federal -- what do you mean the case for\nFederal jurisdiction?\nMR. SHELLEY: I don't think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We prescribe Federal\njurisdiction. I -- you know, I'm not a fan of\nlegislative history, but I -- I don't find that\nparticular piece very much against you. In fact, it\nmay be just -- just the opposite. It may be -- it's\nlawyers' language, you know. We don't know whether\nthere's Federal jurisdiction or not, but this will make\na better case for -- you know, for the other side.\nMR. SHELLEY: I think Congress enacted the\nstatute in 1995 against the backdrop of -- of settled\nlaw that Federal programs are typically litigated in\nFederal court.\nWhat happened, though, was that the States\nstarted -- started enacting provisions in the area and\nCongress went to work in 1978 and enacted a preemption\nprovision to reemphasize what I -- what it believed in\nthe first instance.\nThen in 1998, after courts continued even to\ninterpret the preemption provision narrowly, they went\nback to the -- they went back to the -- to the statute\nand they strengthened it even further to make it\nabsolutely clear. So I think what we have is a --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that the -- the\npurpose of the preemption provision in this statute was\nrelated to benefits and coverage. Some States have\nmandatory coverage for this or that. The case that was\nmentioned is the chiropractor. And the -- in the\nFederal scheme, the Federal administrator didn't want\nto be saddled with whatever the particular packages\nthat the States had. So the coverage and the benefits\n-- those were to be determined on the Federal level,\nand you weren't supposed to be saddled with whatever\nthe State thought would be good to have in the plan.\nMR. SHELLEY: But the provision doesn't read\nsimply that State laws defining benefits shall be\npreempted. It reads State laws relating to the extent\nof coverage or the nature or provision of coverage,\nbenefits, or payments with respect to benefits. And so\nit covers a broad array of things other than simply\nmandated benefit statutes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but -- but -- I'm\nsorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there any\ncomparable situation where a contract between two\nprivate parties has the effect of preempting State law?\nSuppose all you have to do in your service benefit plan\nis agree with your beneficiaries that in the case of\nsubrogation, you're entitled to, you know, 10 times\nactual damages, if they don't pay up right away or\nsomething like that. And -- and that would override\nall sorts of State law. You could specify you're\nentitled to interest at 20 percent and that would\npreempt State usury laws?\nMR. SHELLEY: Well, I believe there are many\nother statutes in the benefits area involving the\nFederal Government from long-term care to miliary\nbenefits which have a similar preemption provision. I\nthink it --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's a sloppy way to put it,\ndon't you think? Maybe what Congress should have said,\nalthough Congress doesn't always speak precisely, is\nthat any -- any State law which contradicts a provision\nof the contract on these particular subjects is\npreempted.\nMR. SHELLEY: It said that originally, and\nthe courts interpreted that so narrowly that\nCongress took that out. Took the contradiction part\nout. There was an inconsistency requirement in the\nstatute. Congress took it out specifically to knock\nout even supplementary or --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, I'll put it differently.\nAll State laws relating to subjects that are covered\nin the contract are preempted.\nMR. SHELLEY: And I would say that that's --\nthat Congress, when it enacted the provision, I think\nintended something on those lines. The provision is,\nin fact, the result of several different amendments and\nit reads the way it does as a result of the amendments.\nAnd if I could reserve the remainder of my\ntime for rebuttal, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Srinivasan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nAn action to enforce the terms of a FEHBA\ncontract is a Federal action because the rights and\nduties in FEHBA contracts are Federal in nature under\nthe Jackson Transit inquiry.\nThe Federal nature of the rights and duties\ncomes both from the context in which FEHBA operates and\nalso from the terms of the express preemption\nprovision. Briefly --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't there -- isn't\nthat a big leap? I mean, even if we agree with you\nthat there are Federal rights and duties, is it\nirrational for Congress to determine, since they arise\nin a normal breach of contract action, we're going to\nassume they're going to be brought in State court? The\ncause of action is for breach of contract that every\nState recognizes.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I guess that seems\nlike an unlikely outcome, given that under the express\nterms of the preemption provision, it's clear that the\ncontract terms are matters of Federal law in the sense\nthat Federal law dictates that they govern over State\nlaw. And if we know that Federal law provides a\nsubstantive rule of decision with respect to the\nconstruction of the contract, it seems anomalous to\nimpute to Congress the intention that those Federal\nrights and duties should be litigated solely in a State\ncourt action.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But wouldn't it have\nbeen the easiest thing for Congress to say, as it does\ncountless times when it creates Federal rights, that\nFederal courts have jurisdiction to enforce these\nrights? And they didn't do that here.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, they didn't do that,\nbut I think as Jackson Transit explains, it's -- it's\ndifferent in the contract context than in your standard\nimplied cause of action context for the following\nreason. When Congress specifically contemplates the\nconstruction of contracts, as it did in FEHBA, it\nclearly contemplates that those contracts will be\nenforceable somewhere. So there is a cause of action\nfor breach. The only question is whether that cause of\naction sounds in State law or instead in Federal law.\nAnd on that question, when Congress\nprescribes, as it did in the preemption provision, that\nthe rights and duties are matters of Federal law, it\nseems most likely that Congress intended there would be\na Federal cause of action that could be brought in\nFederal court to litigate those terms. And that's what\nCongress did in the terms of the preemption provision.\nThat --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- you -- you might\nfollow along with that perfectly well if you're talking\nabout the beneficiary, the Federal employee, saying I'm\nentitled to a certain coverage or I'm entitled to\ncertain benefits. You would expect that suit to be in\nFederal court. But why would you expect what piece of\nthe tort recovery the carrier will get to be in Federal\ncourt?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, this is part and\nparcel of benefits, Justice Ginsburg, because you're\nright that when -- and when an employee asks for\nbenefits, you'd expect that issue to be litigated in\nFederal court. But this is a condition on benefits.\nThat's how the reimbursement obligation is framed in\nthe contract. It's that if you get benefits from the\nFederal Government and then later on get the same\nbenefits from a third party, a condition on the\nGovernment benefits is at that point you have to\nreimburse the Federal Treasury. So I don't think that\none can easily draw a distinction between benefits qua\nbenefits and benefits that are at -- at one point\nissued to the employee but then are subsequently\nreturned pursuant to the terms of the reimbursement\nobligation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose there's a dispute in\nthe -- in the lawsuit about whether a particular\nbenefit to which one - the party was entitled under the\ncontract has been waived. Okay? That's the issue. Is\nthat issue to be decided by Federal law or by State\nlaw?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, do you mean in an\nunderlying tort action or --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No. In the underlying tort\naction, that generally would be governed by State law.\nNow, on the question of whether a benefit is something\nthat the individual is entitled to or, conversely,\nwhether the benefit is obligated to -- whether the\nindividual is obligated to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, I'm not talking about\nthe -- I'm talking about the claim, the claim made by\nan individual against the carrier. And -- and it is\nasserted that this claim should have been made sooner.\nIt has been waived by not having been brought forward\nsooner. Okay? That's -- that's the hypothetical. Do\n-- do you think that that -- that is governed by\nFederal law?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I'm not sure --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Whether waiver occurred or\nnot.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I -- I think that -- that\nwhen it's a claim for benefits, it probably would be\ngoverned by Federal law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: But even --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, the text -- the text\nonly -- only says, shall -- which relate to the nature,\nprovision, or extent of coverage or benefits. Extent\nof coverage or benefits. I don't know that that\nrelates to any of them. It relates to whether the\nbenefit that was covered has been waived.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it depends on whether\nthe contract speaks to the issue. Now, insofar as the\ncontract --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: -- insofar --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't speak to it.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: -- insofar as the contract\ndoesn't speak to an issue, there obviously would be a\nstronger argument for the operation of State law. But\nthat's not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So you're not saying\nthat -- that Federal law is -- is pervasive here, that\nit covers the -- the entire -- the entire suit between\nthe claimant and the insurer.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Not necessarily.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. In that respect,\ndoesn't it differ from ERISA?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it -- it differs from\nERISA in the following sense, that in ERISA, ERISA sets\nforth a cause of action. And so the Court has\nconcluded that that cause of action is exclusive of\nState court causes of action. And we're not taking\nthat position here. We -- we don't say that the\nFederal action is the only action -- excuse me --\nthat's available. State court actions for breach of\ncontract might also be available. But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you're gong to make a\nlot of trouble for us. We're going to have to sort out\nwhich of these things are covered by State law and\nwhich aren't.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I don't know that it's\ngoing to be a -- a terribly difficult inquiry because\nof the precision with which the terms of the preemption\nprovision speaks. And it's certainly not difficult\nwith respect to the reimbursement obligation because it\nfits --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, ERISA has a\nvery clear preemption provision too, and that's\ngenerated a fair amount of work for us.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It has, but in terms of --\nin terms of the relate-to requirement, that's true, and\nI think the Court would apply exactly the same\nstandards that it applies in ERISA.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think there's any\nconstitutional difficulty with the preemption provision\nin this statute?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I don't. I think --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You can make a contract\npreempt State law. Is there any precedent for that?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think Boyle somewhat\nstands for the same proposition in this --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You don't have Boyle for\nthat.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I didn't think Boyle went\nthat far.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, Boyle at least\nestablishes that the terms of a contract preempted\nState law because it was a procurement contract and the\nidea was that by complying with the terms of the\nprocurement contract, the contractor asserted\nessentially a federally compelled defense to the State\ncourt action.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I thought -- I\nthought it defined a duty. I -- I agree with Justice\nStevens. I -- I've never seen it -- are there other\nstatutes where the contracting parties can decide\nwhether or not they're going to oust Federal law -- or\nState law?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I don't know that there are\nother statutes, but what this particular -- particular\nprovision indicates is that Congress thought it was\nvery important that FEHBA contracts would control over\nState law, and I don't think there's any constitutional\nlimitation on Congress' ability to do that. After all\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I wrote Boyle and what\nI thought I was saying was that the common --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- was that the common law,\nFederal common law precluded, preempted any State law\nwhich contradicted this contract. Now, you can -- you\ncan put that in a sloppy fashion by saying that the\ncontract preempted State law, but it wasn't --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that we thought it was\nthe contract that preempted State law. It was Federal\ncommon law which said that the contract -- that any\nprovision in State law which contradicts the contract\nis preempted by Federal common law.\nAnd you can read this statute the same way.\nIt's a sloppy way of putting it, but what it means is\nFederal law preempts any State provision that is\ncontrary to a provision of the contract --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That -- that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- which -- which is\ncertainly constitutional.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Absolutely that's\nconstitutional, and that's -- that's what I mean to be\nsaying because it's Federal law --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Congress isn't always\nprecise, is it?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No, they're not.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there any significant\nvariation among the different carriers as to the terms\nof the contracts they use in different places for\nFederal employees?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: On which particular --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Under this program.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: There's -- there's\nvariation, sure. Now, on -- on --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there a lot or a little?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, there's -- it depends\non what you're talking about.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What I'm thinking of is a\nstatute. The statute has fairly close detail as to\nwhat the contracts must contain. It gives authority to\nOMB or -- to write regs. And they have written regs\nthat have very detailed provisions as to what the\ncontracts must contain, and then there is the contract\nwith the individual carried -- when the -- when the\ncarrier is implementing these rules, regulations, and\nstatutes.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I'm trying to figure out\nis --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: The statute doesn't give a\ngreat deal of specific --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It gives some.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: -- direction on the\nterminology.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It gives some.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It gives some, but it's only\nbare bones, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, I know, but I'm trying\n--\nMR. SRINIVASAN: But I think that's important\nbecause what -- what Congress has done is essentially\nto leave it to OPM to negotiate the terms of these\ncontracts.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Insofar as the individual\ncarriers write contracts with their covered employees,\ni.e., me and you and other people, and there's a lot of\nvariation, I would say there's a lot of private going\non. But insofar as those contracts are dictated by\nwhat OPM says, then it looks more to me like a regular\nFederal program.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, those --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I'm trying to get a\nhandle on that.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: The contracts between the\nindividual and the carrier are dictated by OPM in some\nsense because OPM negotiates the terms that bind the\nindividual. So, the contract that you and I enter into\nwhen we sign on for health insurance is a part of the\n-- of the program, if you will, that's negotiated by\nOPM with the carrier.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So in other words, when I\nsign a contract, or anyone who's a Federal employee,\nit's OPM who effectively sets those terms?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's right, in negotiation\nwith the carrier, and the statement of benefits is\nessentially the program. It tells you what benefits\nyou're entitled to and it tells you what obligations\nyou're encumbered by when you take on those benefits.\nAnd one of the obligations that you're encumbered by\nunder the clear terms of this contract is the\nobligation to reimburse the carrier in the event --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I understand.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: -- that you receive benefits\nand then subsequently receive benefits from a third\nparty.\nAnd one thing that I don't want to lose sight\nof is that ultimately this concerns money that will be\nreimbursed to the Federal Treasury. And so the fact\nthat this case happens to involve litigation between\ntwo private parties shouldn't obscure the strength of\nthe Government's interest in the area, given that\nFederal funds are involved.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nSrinivasan.\nMr. Stock.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS J. STOCK\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. STOCK: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please\nthe Court:\nI must confess that I continue to be\nperplexed by the claim that Congress intended\nreimbursement claims of this type to be handled and --\nand to be dealt with in the Federal courts when that\nsame Congress, in enacting the FEHBA statute, did not\nprovide for that cause of action or that right in the\nfirst instance.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's quite possible no one\nin Congress thought about this --\nMR. STOCK: It -- it --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- which is common. So if\nit is common, why is it that we would not use the same\napproach that the Court used in Clearfield Trust, in\nKimbell Foods, and really look to the nature of the\ncontract? Whereas here, the rights at stake are really\nthose of the United States in that they are going to\nget the money. We have a statute. We have all those\nthings I just listed. It covers only Federal\nemployees. Should -- there are strong interests in\nuniformity throughout the Nation, et cetera, et cetera.\nSo what is the difference between this case,\nother than a technical difference? I concede that one.\nThe title is not United States. It's Blue Cross Blue\nShield or whatever.\nMR. STOCK: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Empire, et cetera. But\naside from that, why is it different?\nMR. STOCK: Because, Your Honor, in the first\ninstance, number one, uniformity really is not a -- a\nlegitimate claim in this -- in this instance by Blue\nCross and Blue Shield.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why -- why?\nMR. STOCK: Because --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The obvious reason for\nuniformity would be you are a Federal employee, whether\nyou're in Alaska or whether you're in Virginia.\nMR. STOCK: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And it's unreasonable to\nthink Congress would want the rights of those different\nFederal employees to differ just because of where they\nlive. And so what's the answer to that?\nMR. STOCK: It -- the fact of the matter is,\nis the way Blue Cross has written this reimbursement\nprovision, they will differ. The reimbursement\nprovision, which -- by the way, to start with, the\nreimbursement provision that is in the Blue Cross Blue\n-- Blue Cross Blue Shield contract with the employees\nis different than the reimbursement provisions which\nare described in the contract between OPM and Blue\nCross Blue Shield. It is markedly different in several\nways, the first way being that, with respect to\nprocurement costs and the issue of this $157,000, who\npays to obtain that. In the OPM Blue Cross Blue Shield\ncontract, it provides for attorney's fees and\ndisbursements to be paid by the Government and the --\nand the claim -- the reimbursement claim to be\nreduced by that.\nIn the Blue Cross Blue Shield version of that\nbetween Blue Cross Blue Shield and the -- the litigant\nhere, that provision is changed. And this is why I say\nthey then undercut their own claim for uniformity.\nThey basically say that we'll allow you attorney's fees\nif we feel like it in a particular case. That's not a\nuniformity provision.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you're saying that\nthere is a uniformity between a master contract between\nthe United States and Blue Cross on the one hand, and\nBlue Cross and the subscriber on the other hand. But\ndoesn't the United States approve the latter contract?\nIn other words, doesn't it -- well, I forget the\ninitials -- OPM or whatever it is. Doesn't it have a\n-- a requirement of approval going to the terms of the\ncontract between Empire and -- and the employee before\nthat contract goes into effect?\nMR. STOCK: I'm not sure what the mechanics\nare of it, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't that -- isn't that\ncrucial, though, in your answer to Justice Breyer?\nBecause if the United States -- if OPM approves the\nEmpire employee contract, maybe you can say, well, gee,\nthere's something strange going on at OPM that they don't\nrequire exactly the same terms in the contract with the\nemployee that they -- that they require in their master\ncontract with -- with Empire. But it doesn't say\nanything one way or the other about the interest of the\nUnited States in having uniformity in which the -- in\nthe -- in the interpretation and application of\ncontracts, which they do approve, between Empire, other\nBlue Cross Blue Shield entities, and their employees.\nMR. STOCK: Well, I think when we're talking\nabout uniformity, Your Honor, because this is a statute\ndesigned to benefit Federal employees, that we're\ntalking about uniformity in the context of all Federal\nemployees are treated the same. The provision that\nBlue Cross Blue --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And the United States is\ntreated the same in relation to all Federal employees.\nI mean, there's -- there's an interest in uniformity\nfor fairness among employees, and there's an interest\nin the United States in having the same expectation, in\nthis case a reimbursement expectation, no matter where\nthe employee is.\nMR. STOCK: That's correct. But in -- in\nterms of uniformity, the provision that Blue Cross --\nseveral provisions that Blue Cross Blue Shield has\nadded to this reimbursement clause undercut the\nuniformity aspect of it. And when you say in a\nparticular case, we'll decide, well, the fellow from\nAlaska -- we'll give him his attorney's fees and\ndisbursements, but the fellow from New York, we won't\ngive it to, you undercut any -- any --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's uniform in both\nAlaska and New York, they are subject to the -- to the\nBlue Cross waiver of attorney's fees or not. They're\nbeing treated uniformly. I don't see that that's\ndisuniform.\nWhat is disuniform, it seems to me, is that\nyou have an employee who wins a judgment in Alaska and\nhe gets to keep all his money because Alaska law says\nthe reimbursement provision is -- is invalid, and then\nyou have a Federal employee in Texas who -- who gets a\n-- wins the same tort lawsuit, and he has to turn over\nto Blue Cross all the -- the portion of his recovery\nthat would cover the outlay that Blue Cross has made.\nThat's disuniformity.\nMR. STOCK: The -- the uniformity which we're\nseeking, relative to these benefits, and the -- and the\nargument as to uniformity I would submit to you, at\nleast as to how we treat the Federal employees, is\nillusory in this case because no matter how this Court\ndecides in this particular case, whether there's\nFederal jurisdiction here or not, the employees are\nbeing treated differently State to State based upon the\nprovision that Blue Cross Blue Shield has enacted.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I suppose that\nthe preemption provision would apply equally if this\nwere brought in State court or Federal court. Correct?\nMR. STOCK: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I'm curious --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Your -- your answer to -- to\nJustice Scalia -- I'm sorry -- just did not register.\nI don't understand --\nMR. STOCK: Well, it was incomplete, Your\nHonor, because I -- I had turned around to answer the\nChief Justice.\nThe -- the way they have this set up with the\nright of reimbursement and the -- and the kickers that\nBlue Cross Blue Shield puts in the statement of\nbenefits creates a situation. They -- they add that\nthese rights of reimbursement apply no matter how the\ncause of action for damages is delineated, in other\nwords, whether it's seeking damages for medical\nbenefits or damages for pain and suffering. And what\nBlue Cross Blue Shield has introduced is that -- that\nkicker.\nAnd -- and what that does, in effect, from\nState to State is change the outcome for the employee\nbecause, for instance, in New York where we have a\ncollateral source rule by statute that says, you may\nnot prove medical damages in a personal injury case for\nwhich you've collected insurance. So, for instance, in\nDenise McVeigh's case, I can't prove her medical bills.\nYet, Blue Cross Blue Shield is going to come in and\npick Denise Finn's pocket on her claim for pain and\nsuffering for the $157,000 in medical bills that they\nsay they've paid.\nWhereas, if I go across the river -- and I\ndon't know the law in New Jersey, but assuming that New\nJersey uses the older rule where, if I had the good\nsense to buy myself medical insurance and I collected\nmedical insurance for the benefits that were -- if I\ncollect the medical payments for the medical bills, I\ncan still go into court and prove those medical bills\nas against the tortfeasor. In that particular\ninstance, Blue Cross Blue Shield comes in and it takes\nmoney at least that I've gotten from the other side as\nopposed to in New York where they take money that I\nhaven't gotten from the other side.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but do they take money\nin New York that you haven't gotten from the other\nside?\nMR. STOCK: Absolutely. They're looking to\nassert a claim. I don't have a claim for medical\nbenefits in the underlying court --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but there's\nuniformity because the Government wins in both cases.\nMR. STOCK: I'm sorry, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: There's uniformity because\nthe Government wins in both cases.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. STOCK: I have to concede that that's\ntrue, and if that is the uniformity that we seek and\nthe only --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, that's the kind of\nuniformity the Government loves.\nMR. STOCK: I'm sure they do.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: I -- I wasn't thinking of\nthat kind of uniformity.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. STOCK: I assure you, Your Honor, that\nDenise Finn doesn't.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I was thinking of the\ncontract -- the contracts that the carriers enter into\nwith the individual Federal employees in different\nplaces. And I'm trying to get an idea of whether those\ncontracts all read the same or they don't. And so far,\nyou have found one example of where they read\ndifferently. Some contracts apparently say when you\nreimburse us, you can subtract attorney's fees, and\nothers say when you reimburse us maybe you can subtract\nattorney's fees, depending on how we feel about it.\nAnd I grant you that is a difference.\nAnd I am curious, as was Justice Souter, as\nto whether you have to get OPM approval for that\ndifference or whether OPM can tell you, knock it off,\nwe want the same. And also I'd like other examples.\nWhat I'm trying to do, to be clear about it,\nis I'm trying to see how similar this is to the\ninstance of the Federal employee checks, which this\nCourt many, many years ago said, when you pay your\nFederal employees and you write a check, it's Federal\nlaw that's going to govern the interpretation of the\nendorsement. I want to see how similar it is and how\ndifferent.\nI have two differences. One is the name on\nthis case is Empire, not United States, and the second\ndifference is the one you just mentioned about may\nrather than must. Now, are there others?\nMR. STOCK: There are differences in my\nunderstanding, Your Honor, from State to State between\nthe different Blue Cross entities. I couldn't tell you\nwhat exactly those differences are, but my\nunderstanding is that these Blue Cross policies vary\nfrom State to State.\nDo they vary -- I -- I think, Your Honor,\nalthough it supports my contention, that you may have\nmisunderstood what I said about the -- the difference\nbetween the reimbursement clauses, honestly. What I --\nwhat I indicated was the -- the reimbursement clause\nthat is in the OPM/Blue Cross contract is different\nfrom what Blue Cross then enters into with its members.\nThat differs. I was not asserting that it differs\nfrom State to State. What I'm saying is that the\neffect of that differs from State to State certainly.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May -- may I ask this?\nBecause I think your example overlooks the fact that at\nleast your opponent claims that the Blue Cross contract\nprovision would preempt the New York law that denies\nyour client recovery for health benefits.\nMR. STOCK: It does --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I think that would be their\nanswer to your example.\nMR. STOCK: It -- it would be in error, I\nbelieve, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, if we -- if we think\nCongress can provide that a contract provision would\npreempt a State law, it seems to me the example you've\ngiven is the precise example that that statute was\nintended to cover.\nMR. STOCK: The -- at the -- at the very\nessence of that, I don't believe that a contract can\npreempt State law. The constitutional laws of the\nUnited States can preempt State law. If somehow you\ncan bootstrap a contract into that by some theory, I\nsuppose you could argue that it -- that it --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But if -- if it does, it\nwould eliminate the lack of uniformity on which you\nrely.\nMR. STOCK: It -- it would not, Your Honor,\nin this instance because the -- the operation of that\nstatute does not affect their right to reimbursement\nunder their contract provision. It affects the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but it affects the\namount that your client can recover. And they would\nsay that they -- because it assumes an absence of -- it\nassumes a payment by the carrier, and under -- I -- I\nthink they would take the position that they have, in\nfact, the -- they have not, in fact, paid that\ninsurance cost.\nMR. STOCK: Your Honor, I don't think we\nwould ever --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not stating it very\nwell, but I --\nMR. STOCK: The -- the situation with the --\nthe term of New York law that I am -- that I had\nindicated would occur during a trial of the case and in\nterms of my cause of action. It would not affect Blue\nCross' lawsuit against my client.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No. But the defendant\nwould say, we don't have to pay those damages because\nthey're covered by insurance. And the response would\nbe, well, they're not -- they -- they are only covered\nby insurance if they can be reimbursed. I don't want\nto take up too much of your time on this.\nMR. STOCK: Yes, they wouldn't be a party to\nthat suit at that time, though, Your Honor, in -- in\nterms of raising that issue.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But -- but the\npreemption provision, at least with respect to the\nrights of Empire, would ensure uniformity. In other\nwords, if the contract terms preempt State law, then\nany impediment to recovery by Empire that varies from\nState to State would be overridden.\nMR. STOCK: Right, but that wouldn't affect\n-- that wouldn't override the net -- the net effect on\nthe -- on the person. The -- the real world effect on\nDenise Finn and other people like her would still be\ndifferent.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I understand\nthat. But to the extent people are concerned about\ndisuniformity from the point of view of the Federal\nrecovery, the preemption provision is going to apply\nwhether this action is in State court or Federal court.\nMR. STOCK: That's correct.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What's your --\nMR. STOCK: And if the only -- if the only\ninterest in uniformity we have, again, is whether the\n-- whether the Federal Government gets its -- its money\nback, then -- you know, then the uniformity argument\nmay fly. But if we're also interested in the -- in the\nuniformity argument in the manner in which Federal\nemployees are treated and in the manner in which ladies\nwho -- such as Denise Finn are treated, then uniformity\nis -- is out the window under these -- under this --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the only question\nthat we're considering today is whether or not Federal\nquestion jurisdiction exists to authorize bringing this\nsuit in Federal court.\nMR. STOCK: And I would submit to Your Honor\nit clearly does not because this case, involving Blue\nCross suing Denise Finn for these benefits involves not\nissues of the construction or interpretation of a\nFederal statute, but issue -- the issues involved in\nour case are whether they're entitled to collect the\nmoney that they paid three times to the same doctor for\nthe same service on the same day. They paid a\nparticular Dr. Brown $17,500 for the same service on\nthree occasions.\nIn addition, our dispute involves whether or\nnot some of the benefits that they claim they paid and\nwhich were medically a result of this accident were in\nfact or whether they were taking other benefits they\npaid and trying to be a little cute and collect those\nunder saxony.\nThose are the issues. Those issues --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I would have thought\nthe issue is whether Federal law governs this --\nMR. STOCK: Well, yes, but --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and they come to Federal\ncourt.\nSo what is clearly -- maybe I -- maybe you've\n-- I don't think you've said this. We know this. That if\nthe United States issues checks to all of its employees\nthroughout the country and then it seeks to recover\nfrom one of the drawees or one of the people who\nendorsed the check on the ground it was fraudulent, we\nknow that it is Federal law that must govern those\nchecks. Right? From Clearfield.\nMR. STOCK: Yes, Your Honor, which --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, what is the\ndifference in this case? In this case, we have a\nprivate administrator of this Federal -- of this -- of\nthis Federal program. There are Federal employees\nthroughout the country. They are supposed to receive\nuniform -- reasonably uniform health insurance, and the\nprivate administrator wants to obtain money that it\nthinks it's entitled to to put into the Federal\nTreasury. Now, aside from the name, what's the\ndifference?\nMR. STOCK: The difference is, is in the\ninstance of Clearfield Trust, you had the Government\ninvolved in a dispute over their own commercial paper\nthat they issued and a uniquely Federal interest and a\nuniquely Federal item.\nHere, these -- Federal employees aren't the\nonly employees in America who get health benefits, and\nthey are -- these disputes that arise under this\nstatute are most frequently not of the -- not seeking\nto answer the grand questions. They're most frequently\ninvolved in dealing with issues such as we have here.\nWhether the --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If the Federal Government\nwere running this program itself, would you make the\nsame argument?\nMR. STOCK: I'm sorry, Your Honor. I missed\nthe first --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If the Federal Government\nwere running the program itself, rather than having\nit -- private entities administer the program for it,\nwould you make the same argument?\nMR. STOCK: I don't know that I would, but I\nthink the caveat to that is if the Federal Government\nwere running it themselves, pursuant to a different\nstatute than we have here, the first thing I think I\nwould look at is what jurisdiction or what the Congress\nhad to say about where they wanted cases arising from\nthat. It may well be --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they've already\nsaid that. I mean, there would be Federal jurisdiction\nthere because the Federal Government would be a party\nto the case. Right?\nMR. STOCK: Yes, Your Honor. But they're not\na party to this case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's exactly what I'm\ntrying to find out. That's -- that's what I'm -- I'm\ntrying to figure out in my mind how close this is to\nthe Federal Government running a uniform program. I\nmean, everybody agrees Federal law governs questions\ninvolving the rights of the United States --\nMR. STOCK: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- arising under nationwide\nFederal programs. And here, we have not the United\nStates. We have Empire. And so how close is Empire to\nbeing simply an instrument of the United States in this\nrespect, and how close is it to being really an\nindependent company that sets up its own insurance\ncontracts? That's what I'm trying --\nMR. STOCK: Interestingly enough, the\nGovernment has told us that. And what they told us --\nand it's at page 4 of -- and in a footnote number 3\nfrom the amicus curiae's briefs from Cruz. And the\nGovernment has told us in Cruz's pending certiorari\npetition that that -- Blue Cross Blue Shield carriers\ndo not perform outsourced Government tasks, are not\nagents of the Government, and do not act on behalf of\nOPM. Rather, they function as independent economic\nentities that offer and run their own health insurance\nplans, performing a role that is not governmental in\nnature.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's quite good. What are\nyou reading from?\nMR. STOCK: I'm sorry, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE BREYER: What are you reading from\nthere?\nMR. STOCK: We're reading from the footnote\nnumber 3 of the amicus curiae's brief at -- at page 4.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The Government -- the\nGovernment as amicus? The Government as amicus.\nMR. STOCK: No, no. The -- the amicus from\nthe -- representing Cruz.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't -- isn't that --\nMR. STOCK: And their -- but it is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- isn't that -- isn't that\n--\nMR. STOCK: -- their statement in their -- in\nthe certiorari -- this is the Government's statement. This\nis the Department of Justice's concession that Blue Cross\nhas sole authority over reimbursement decisions, and that\nis their language. That's the way they describe --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But at the end of the day, the\nmoney, every penny collected, minus any service fee, is\ngoing to go into the Federal Treasury. Isn't it?\nMR. STOCK: That's true.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, you could say the\nsame about -- about any recovery, that a certain\npercentage in taxes will go to the Federal Treasury I\n-- I --\nMR. STOCK: Well, we can also say -- we can\nalso say that irrespective of whether the Federal\ncourts collect it or the State courts collect it, it's\nstill going to end up in the Federal Treasury, and that\nthese are --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But whether it's collected\nor not may -- indeed, may vary depending on whether\nState law or Federal law applies. And if Federal law\napplies, then you have the jurisdictional consequence.\nMR. STOCK: The problem in this case, in\nterms of asserting arising-under jurisdiction, is --\nand -- and in terms of Boyle also, is that the -- the\nPetitioner has failed to point out any difference in\nhow it would occur. There is absolutely no difference\npointed out by the Petitioner as to how the law would\ndiffer --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, presumably it didn't\ndo that because the preemption provision does not rely\nupon conflict.\nMR. STOCK: The preemption provision doesn't\napply to reimbursement provisions either, Your Honor.\nIt applies to --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it doesn't apply to\nreimbursement provisions, you say, but it does apply to\nbenefits. And -- and the value of a benefit is going\nto vary from the -- the policy limit to zero depending,\nin a case like this, on whether a third party payment\nhas to be given to the Government with -- with -- isn't\n-- isn't that a question of benefit?\nMR. STOCK: No, it is not, Your Honor.\nAnd with all due respect, this Court has\nconsistently held that words used in one place in the\nstatute should mean the same thing as in other places\nin the statute. Coverage and benefits, as it's defined\nin this statute, does not include reimbursement claims,\nand to stretch that preemption clause --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Will you quote the language\nthat you're referring to?\nMR. STOCK: If I can find it, Your Honor,\nsure. I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I don't want to take up\ntoo --\nMR. STOCK: Yes, I'm sorry, Your Honor. I'm\nflipping around. I have it here.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: My -- my concern simply is\nthat you've made a conclusory statement that elsewhere\nthere's a definition that doesn't --\nMR. STOCK: There is.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and --\nMR. STOCK: And it's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: After the argument, just\ngive me a cite so I know exactly what you're -- you're\ngetting at.\nMR. STOCK: No problem, Your Honor. The --\nthe punch line to it is or to paraphrase it, you know,\nbenefits are described as payments for medical --\nmedical payments for this, that kind of thing. But\nthere is a very specific description of what benefits\nmeans in the plan. It doesn't include reimbursement.\nAnd I -- and I think it really stretches it to include\nreimbursement as a -- under that benefit setting.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But how do you answer the\nquestion that I think Justice Breyer was -- was getting\nat, that it's -- it's a -- the -- what's in it for the\ncarrier? Nothing. As -- if -- if every penny that the\ncarrier collects is going to go into the U.S. Treasury,\nthen why does the carrier care?\nMR. STOCK: Being a cynic, I'm not so sure of\nthat, Judge. But -- Your Honor. I'm sorry. I'm not\nso sure of that because early on in the -- in Blue\nCross Blue Shield's summary of the facts, they indicate\nthat Blue Cross' fees in the matter are determined\nbased upon performance. I don't know what performance\nmeans, but I suspect it has something to do with how\nmuch money ultimately ends up being spent.\nI don't think it's necessarily relevant to\nthe inquiry that we're involved in. The fact that --\nthat all of the money may ultimately go to the\nGovernment, though, I don't think changes the issue as\nto whether or not this Court should confer subject\nmatter jurisdiction upon the district courts in this\ncase. There -- the -- the issues here can be resolved\nin the State courts and more efficiently than in the\nFederal courts. And certainly I think that the Federal\ncourts would not look forward to an influx of cases\ndealing with issues in -- in essentially personal\ninjury issues involving whether or not particular\ndoctors were paid properly, whether or not particular\npayments need to be made in connection with and are\nreimbursable to the Government, or the types of issues\nthat we have here.\nAnd to be perfectly honest, most of the cases\nare not of the magnitude of this one where we're\ntalking about $150,000. Most of the cases involve\n$5,500 and $6,500 and things like that. The Government\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but this is a claim\nfor $150,000 out of a settlement of $3 million or $4\nmillion.\nMR. STOCK: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What was your defense on\nthe merits?\nMR. STOCK: To this claim?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. STOCK: Our defense on the merits to this\nclaim, were we to get there, is that the Government has\npaid the same doctor $17,500 three times for the same\nservice, and that Denise Finn should not be required to\nreimburse Blue Cross Blue Shield when they have\nincompetently, in effect, paid out more money than they\nshould have.\nThe second defense involves the fact that\nsome of the benefits which Blue Cross Blue Shield is\nseeking reimbursement for are not connected to the\naccident that injured Mr. McVeigh. They're part of his\nnormal health care type of services which wouldn't fall\nunder the reimbursement claim.\nThose claims are -- are not the type of\nthings that I think that the Federal district courts\nwant to deal with. This case --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I take it you're not\nforeclosed from making your defense or your claim in\nthe Federal court.\nMR. STOCK: No, absolutely not. But --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. -- Mr. Stock, we have\none loose end. I think we do. Both Justice Breyer and\nI have -- have asked the question whether OPM has to\napprove of the terms of the contract between Blue Cross\nand -- and the -- the insured. Is -- does OPM have to\napprove?\nMR. STOCK: I don't believe they do, Your\nHonor. I think the terms of OPM and Blue Cross'\ncontract provide that Blue Cross will enter into a -- a\ncontract with the -- with the policyholders that is\nconsistent with its contract with OPM. But I don't --\nI don't believe -- and -- and honestly, I -- I did not\nlook before we -- we talked about this. I don't\nbelieve it requires their approval. They don't get a\ncopy of the contract and read it over.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Assuming the consistency\nterm, that supports an argument that the Government has\nan interest in -- in uniformity of -- of\ninterpretation, doesn't it?\nMR. STOCK: Only if the -- if in uniformity\nof interpretation of the contract?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, yes.\nMR. STOCK: I think the Government has an\ninterest in uniformity of the manner in which the --\nthe employees are ultimately treated, and I think when\nwe talk about uniformity, that that's what we ought be\ntalking about.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I guess you can be --\ndepending upon how detailed the OPM contract is, you\ncan be consistent with that contract and still have an\nenormous amount of variation from one to another. It\ndepends entirely upon whether the OPM contract is\nentirely comprehensive. If it covers every jot and\ntittle, then I guess you can't be consistent with it\nand different. But if it's -- if it's sort of bare\nbones, you -- you could be consistent with that and\nhave a lot of variation, couldn't you?\nMR. STOCK: Yes, absolutely. And -- and my\nunderstanding is that -- is for that reason that OPM\ndoes not review the contracts and approve the contract\nlanguage of Blue Cross Blue Shield.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if -- if --\nMR. STOCK: But I don't know that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- if, in fact, there were\nconsistently only in this remote sense so that the\ninterests which are meant to be protected in the -- in\nthe OPM Blue Cross contract aren't being protected at\nthe next level, then OPM could bring an action against\n-- against Blue Cross saying it's not consistent\nenough, couldn't it?\nMR. STOCK: It could.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. STOCK: It could. But in this particular\ninstance, the contract provisions that Blue Cross are\n-- and Blue Shield are seeking to enforce, as regards\nreimbursement, are markedly different. I mean, it's --\nit's not a small variation. It's a very substantial\nmatter in terms of, first, the procurement costs and,\nsecond, in terms of what kind of a cause of action Blue\nCross Blue Shield can take the money from. But that's\nnot an -- an incidental. That goes to the heart of --\nof the matter.\nIf there's no other questions, Your Honors,\nthank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you very much,\nMr. Stock.\nMr. Shelley, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY F. SHELLEY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SHELLEY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I wonder if you could\nfocus on one question for me. If you have a State law\ncause of action and the law to be applied to some\naspects of that cause of action is Federal law, is that\nsufficient to establish Federal question jurisdiction\nor not?\nMR. SHELLEY: It is, Your Honor, under the\nGrable case that the Court issued last year. A State\nlaw claim that turns on the construction of Federal\nlaw, a substantial question of Federal law, is\nremovable to Federal court and arises under Federal law\nin the first place.\nI wanted to address Justice Souter's question\nof whether OPM does approve the contract. There's no\nindividual contract -- excuse me -- between Blue Cross\nand any individual enrollee. The statement of benefits\nis part of the Government contract. It is attached at\nappendix A and the terms of the contract, the master\ncontract, specifically say that in sections 2.2 and\n2.5, that the benefits shall be -- and -- and\nreimbursement terms as well -- shall be consistent with\nand incorporated by the statement of benefits, which is\nattached. And so it is part of the contract. There's\nno separate contract here. It's one --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You mean everybody in the\nentire United States gets the same piece of paper.\nMR. SHELLEY: The same brochure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So it's identical. There is\nno difference between every individual's contract,\nevery Federal employee's -- I guess it's a contract\nwith the Federal employee. Isn't it? I mean, he's\nbound by it you say.\nMR. SHELLEY: They -- by enrolling, they bind\nthemselves to the contract.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So I am -- in\nAlaska, Virginia, everywhere, they get the same piece\nof paper. They enroll and then they're bound by it.\nMR. SHELLEY: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the question here is\nwhether that should get different interpretations\npossibly in different places.\nMR. SHELLEY: Under State law, and it should\nnot.\nAnd we are -- it is a uniform system across\nthe country, and the -- the carrier is bound to apply\nthose terms, particularly the reimbursement terms,\nconsistently and equitably across the country.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel --\nMR. SHELLEY: Section 4.1 of the contract\nsays that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the -- the Grable\ncase said, though, that the Federal question had to be\na necessary element of the State law cause of action.\nThat's not always the case in these cases, is it?\nMR. SHELLEY: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's only -- the --\nthe Federal question comes up only on issues of\npreemption. They may or may not be presented in a\nparticular case.\nMR. SHELLEY: In the first instance, our\nclaim is an enforcement claim for the contract. The\ncontract itself and the common law that surrounds it\nare -- are Federal law, and as a result, we --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that kind of --\nthat begs the -- that's not the question I asked and it\nsort of begs the question. I mean, you have the State\nlaw cause of action to enforce your contract claim, and\nif there's some State law that's asserted against you\nthat's inconsistent with the contract, then you have\nthe Federal question issue. But that's the only\nFederal question I see in the case.\nMR. SHELLEY: Well, but there are, for\ninstance, seven States that wouldn't allow us to bring\nthe cause of action in the first place, and that's why\nwe need to go back to the question of whether the claim\nitself is Federal in nature. And under the Jackson\nTransit or Clearfield Trust analogies, the law at the\nstart, the cause of action, the claim itself is Federal\nin nature, and you don't need to get to the question of\nwhether the vessel of a State law claim --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My hypothetical that\nI started with was assuming you have a State law claim,\na State law cause of action. So do you have any\nauthority other than Grable for the proposition that a\nState law cause of action which -- in which the law to\napply may or may not turn on Federal law in particular\naspects presents a Federal question?\nMR. SHELLEY: Well, the contract itself is\nFederal law. It -- it is a -- it is tantamount to a\nregulation that the Government has selected the terms\nof, and as a result, it should be treated as Federal\nlaw. And -- and cases, Franchise Tax Board, on which\n-- on which Grable relies and the earlier cases -- we\n-- we would say those reach a similar result.\nOne other point I wanted to address was this\nissue of whether this attorney's fees question is\ndifferent than the master contract or the statement of\nbenefits. It's not. The master contract addresses the\nquestion of whether we can deduct our own attorney's\nfees from the recovery before we give the money to the\nFederal Treasury. The statement of benefits governs\nthe question of whether we -- we will deduct for\nattorney's fees when we collect the claim from the\nsubscriber.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you very much,\nMr. Shelley.\n"
