        "content": "(11:07 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in Number 00-1471, The Kentucky Association of Health\nPlans versus Janie A. Miller.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT N. ECCLES\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. ECCLES: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWhen Congress enacted ERISA, it created a\nFederal regulatory structure for employers and unions to\nsponsor plans that provide health care benefits for\nemployees and their families. The vast majority of ERISA\nplans throughout the country have chosen to provide these\nbenefits through HMO's or other managed care entities that\nuse limited provider networks in order to deliver quality\nhealth care at a reasonable cost.\nThe Kentucky laws before the Court today\npreclude that use of limited provider networks and require\nan HMO, and by using that term I mean to encompass a\nvariety of managed care arrangements, require those\narrangements to allow into the network any provider\nwilling to accept the network terms. Because ERISA saves\nfrom preemption State laws which regulate insurance, the\nquestion here is whether these any willing provider, or\nAWP laws, regulate insurance.\nQUESTION: Now, I take it these laws have become\nfairly common --\nMR. ECCLES: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- around the country, so Kentucky's\nnot alone in having such a law.\nMR. ECCLES: Kentucky has a relatively broad\nlaw, Your Honor. Many of the laws are pharmacy solely,\nbut they -- Kentucky is not alone, that's correct.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nQUESTION: Can -- can Kentucky exclude certain\nspecialties, like they say, we will not have\nchiropractors? In -- in Kentucky, can the plans do that?\nMR. ECCLES: No.\nQUESTION: In other words, they have to be open\nto various subspecialties?\nMR. ECCLES: There are -- there are different\nlaws about that. The Kentucky law by itself, in the\ndefinition of provider, includes a variety of specialties,\nincluding chiropractor, and there's a separate\nchiropractor any willing provider law also, but the\nquestion here is whether that law regulates insurance, and\nlast term, in Rush Prudential versus Moran, the Court said\nthat a law regulates insurance when insurers are regulated\nwith respect to insurance practices.\nAWP laws do not regulate insurance practices.\nThey do not affect the risk of financial loss that's\ntransferred by the HMO policy, they do not change the\nterms of the policy at all, and they do not change the\nbargain between the insurer and the insured.\nQUESTION: But they -- they do have something to\nsay about who's going to be available as a doctor on the\nplan.\nMR. ECCLES: They -- they change the network,\nthat's correct, Your Honor. They -- through a -- they\npotentially change the network. The law itself creates no\nchange. If the provider elects to join the network, and\nis willing to accept the terms --\nQUESTION: But isn't that a change in the\npolicy? Doesn't it give the patient a right he otherwise\nwould not have?\nMR. ECCLES: No, Your Honor. It -- it gives the\npatient no right he would otherwise not have. If you look\nat the exemplar policy that's in Exhibit C to the joint\nappendix, you will see nothing that's changed in the\npolicy terms.\nQUESTION: Well, there's nothing in the policy\nterm that is changed in -- in the literal sense of a\nchange in language, but it seems to me that it does mean\nthat under a policy subject to a law like Kentucky's, the\nperson who joins the HMO, in effect the person who obtains\nthe insurance, has a far greater choice, in -- in effect,\nin -- in the expenditure of benefits under that policy\nthan he otherwise has. He's getting something under a\npolicy subject to the Connecticut law -- the Kentucky law,\nthat he does not get under a policy without that law, and\nthat is a breadth of choice about who is going to treat\nhim.\nMR. ECCLES: Not necessarily, Your Honor. The\nchoice, you know, exists if the provider elects to join\nthe network, and it's entirely --\nQUESTION: Well -- well, sure, but I mean, the\npoint of the statute and the point of the case is that\nproviders do elect, and to the extent that they elect,\nthe -- the person subject to the policy has a choice that\nis a -- a breadth of options that otherwise are not going\nto be available.\nMR. ECCLES: Potentially. In a --\nQUESTION: Even -- not potentially. I mean,\neven -- even if nobody elected -- even if nobody elected\nto join, what has happened by reason of this law, is it\nnot the case that the term of the policy is changed, that\noriginally the policy said, we will pay for your treatment\nby a limited number of individuals whom -- whom we -- whom\nwe approve, and that policy is now changed to, by reason\nof this law, we will pay for your treatment by any\nindividuals who want to join our plan. Isn't -- isn't\nthat a different policy?\nMR. ECCLES: Not -- the policy does not change\nin that way, Justice Scalia. What -- what the policy\nsays --\nQUESTION: It's not rewritten, but doesn't the\nlaw have that effect, to -- to effectively change the term\nof the policy?\nMR. ECCLES: No -- no, it does not, and the\nreason is, what the policy provides is, we will pay for\ncare from participating physicians, from network\nproviders, and that is still the policy. The -- before,\nwith or without the AWP law.\nQUESTION: Well, to use your term, physicians,\nbefore the law, is defined as those physicians whom we are\nwilling to accept as part of the plan, and after the law,\nthe definition of participating physician is any physician\nwho wants to join the plan.\nMR. ECCLES: It -- it has taken away the HMO's\nability to select, that's correct --\nQUESTION: It's --\nMR. ECCLES: -- but the definition of who -- it\nis still limited to participating physicians who meet its\nown --\nQUESTION: In -- in your opening remarks, you\nsaid it doesn't change the bargain. It seems to me the\nthrust of Justice Scalia and Justice Souter's questions\nis, it does exactly that.\nMR. ECCLES: But the -- before or after the AWP\nlaw, the participant has no right to choose any particular\nprovider. The participant has the right to use the\nnetwork physicians under the terms in the policy.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. ECCLES: After the AWP law, if a provider\njoins the network, the participant still has exactly the\nsame right. The network has a different composition.\nQUESTION: But -- but that -- that really does\nnot seem to make sense to me. The purchaser has the same\nright, in theory, certainly to go to any physician in the\nnetwork, but the HMO has been required to expand the\nnetwork.\nMR. ECCLES: Under that hypothetical, that's\ncorrect, Your Honor, you know, if that's --\nQUESTION: What's hypothetical about it?\nMR. ECCLES: Well, we don't know the effect of\nthe law on the networks --\nQUESTION: Well, for instance, here, if it's\nchiropractic services, and let's assume the HMO did not\npreviously include chiropractic physicians as providers,\nafter this law, if a chiropractic physician in good\nstanding were willing to come in under the HMO, then the\nHMO would have to take that physician, and then the -- the\npatient would have a possibility, at least, of having paid\nservices seeing a chiropractor that formerly would not\nhave been available.\nMR. ECCLES: That -- that would be a\nsignificantly different law, Justice O'Connor, and for\nthis reason. In that case, which is generally referred to\nas a mandatory provider law, it's very much like the\nmandatory benefit laws that this Court has held to be\nsaved. That changes the legal rights to get -- of the\ninsured to get that type of care, and it changes the risk\nunder the policy.\nQUESTION: No, well, why -- why is what I said\ndifferent from what happens here?\nMR. ECCLES: Because the terms of the -- the\nnetwork would already provide for chiropractors. The only\nquestion is how many would come in. This law would not\nregulate that. That's regulated through other aspects of\nKentucky law.\nQUESTION: Well, it -- it's -- maybe I'm under a\nmisapprehension as to how the bill -- I -- I thought that\nthe -- one of the examples given in the brief was, a woman\nis being treated during the term of her pregnancy, she\nchanges her employer, she wants the same doctor to --\nto treat her, and she is the one that can initiate the\nrequest to the HMO, please allow this doctor to treat me,\nand the doctor then says yes, I'm willing to be bound by\nthe terms of the HMO, and -- and she has that doctor.\nThat seems to me to significantly increase the bargain\nthat she made.\nMR. ECCLES: But the -- the bargain in that\ncircumstance, if it -- if it works out that way, she --\nshe is able to stay with the doctor, but under -- only if\nthe doctor can get into the network, and is willing to\nmeet the terms of the network. It's entirely up to the\ndoctor to come in.\nQUESTION: Yes, but before the law, the network\ncould have refused him categorically, even though he were\nwilling to meet the terms.\nMR. ECCLES: That -- that's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: I -- is --\nQUESTION: I hear you, I just don't see that --\nthat you -- you make much headway in saying that isn't a\nchange.\nMR. ECCLES: Because the -- the change is the\nlegal right of the insured, which was never to any\nparticular provider, and that's still true after the --\nthe law.\nQUESTION: I don't -- you -- you're really\nasserting that -- that two insurance policies are exactly\nthe same, their terms haven't changed, or their terms\naren't different, where one says you can get your\nautomobile fixed, we will pay to get your automobile fixed\nby these companies, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and the\nother one says, we will pay to get your automobile fixed\nby any company that is willing to do the job up to our\nstandards, and -- and you think those two insurance\npolicies are saying exactly the same thing, that there's\nonly a hypothetical difference between the two.\nMR. ECCLES: I -- I think the difference between\nthat hypothetical and -- and mine is, the -- the standard\nwith or without the law is still, if the provider comes\ninto the network, and you have the right to the network\nprovider, and that's all.\nQUESTION: The thing I don't understand is, if\nyour view is correct, why are you objecting to the law?\nMR. ECCLES: We believe that the law\ninterferes --\nQUESTION: Doesn't have any impact on your\nbusiness.\nMR. ECCLES: Yes, it couldn't, Your Honor, it\nprecludes the plans from limited networks, and what that\ndoes, and this is the point made by the FTC staff, which\nhas been writing States objecting to these laws, is it\ncreates an uncertainty in the network, because the bargain\nthat's been made, the noninsurance bargain between the HMO\nand the providers is, it's altered, although the policy is\nnot, and -- and suddenly, the providers who are in the\nnetwork already, they -- they signed up for a different\ndeal, which was a limited network. They may not want the\ndeal they've got, because they'll have less patient volume\nthan they thought they were getting.\nIt also adds significantly just administrative\ncosts to deal with more providers, and it's also more\ndifficult to monitor quality with a larger network, so it\ndoes have -- it's the uncertainty of what the law's effect\nwill be that --\nQUESTION: But you're complaining about the --\nthe increase in the number of providers, and it's that\nincrease that is what might be desirable from the\npatient's standpoint.\nMR. ECCLES: Well, we're really complaining\nabout the uncertainty that's created, that the networks\ncan no longer be selective, which has quality and cost\nimplications, including fee implications.\nQUESTION: The -- the any willing provider\nstatutes have been around now for sometime. I understand\nthe case that you're making in its most dramatic is, this\nspells the end of HMO's, because the whole thing works\nonly if they have few doctors and lots of patients, so the\ndoctors have a guaranteed patient flow. Has that happened\nin States with any willing provider laws, that there are\nso many doctors who are coming in that the doctors who\nwere in in the beginning now say, the rates have to go\nway, way up, because we don't have any guaranteed patient\nflow any more?\nMR. ECCLES: I -- I can't tell you about the\nnumber of doctors, Justice Ginsburg. The studies that are\nin -- cited in, particularly in the amicus briefs, suggest\nthat there's been about a 15 percent increase in cost\narising out of --\nQUESTION: If that's so, I mean, since -- I'm\nnot sure of the relevance of this, but I mean, if it\nturned out that this law or others like it drove up costs\nfor no advantages, couldn't the Federal Government stop\nthem by -- under Medicare and Medicaid, wouldn't they have\nenough power, or would they, to simply write regulations\nsuch that they won't reimburse States for -- if these\ncircumstances were quite bad?\nMR. ECCLES: I -- I'm not sure they could do it\nin -- in that avenue, through Medicare or Medicaid. The\nFederal Government could obviously do it directly with its\nown law on the books, which would --\nQUESTION: That would require an act of\nCongress.\nMR. ECCLES: Yes, that's correct.\nQUESTION: I want to -- you think they don't\nhave the authority?\nMR. ECCLES: I -- I don't think it would do\nthe --\nQUESTION: But anyway, as far as the harm is\nconcerned, a) we don't know that there's any harm.\nMR. ECCLES: Right.\nQUESTION: b) We don't know that the Government\ncould deal with it in some other way, and so it's pretty\nmuch irrelevant to our decision, is that right?\nMR. ECCLES: Right. Right. What is relevant is\nwhether, as the Court said in Moran last term, these are\ninsurance practices, and the Court's --\nQUESTION: Then we're back at Justice Scalia's\nquestion.\nMR. ECCLES: The --\nQUESTION: Is the whole distinction that here\nthe direct beneficiary is the provider? That is, the\neffect of the any willing provider law has opened the door\nto the provider, whereas in Rush and in Ward, it was the\ninsured himself or herself?\nMR. ECCLES: That -- that's certainly a major\npart of our distinction, Justice Ginsberg.\nQUESTION: Is -- is there anything more than\nthat that -- here, the patient is the indirect beneficiary\nof opening the door to the provider. In those two cases,\nit was the insured. There -- there was no third party\ninvolved. It was just the insurer and the insured.\nMR. ECCLES: The -- the patient, I would say, is\na potential beneficiary, but without rehashing that, those\ntwo cases, a legal right was created for the insured. In\nWard, the Court said that was a mandatory contract term\nthat had been added by using the notice-prejudice rule,\nand Rush added the option of seeking external review and\nthose -- and described it as a legal right enforceable\nagainst the HMO. Here, there is no such legal right, and\nwe believe that in order to be an insurance practice under\nthis Court's precedents, the practice must either affect\nthe spreading of risk, which any willing provider laws do\nnot do --\nQUESTION: But that was not true, that was not\ntrue in either --\nMR. ECCLES: That's right.\nQUESTION: -- Ward or --\nMR. ECCLES: Or, as in Ward and Rush Prudential,\nmust affect the legal rights of the insured. The -- the\nCourt has used a formulation of that phrase in -- in many\nof its Savings Clause decisions, including those two.\nWe -- we also think the Court has approached\nthis through a common sense inquiry. That's how it begins\nthe Savings Clause inquiry, and on a common sense basis,\nnobody contends that the provider contracts themselves are\ninsurance contracts, and nobody contends that the\nproviders are part of the business of insurance.\nInstead --\nQUESTION: Yes, but nobody -- nobody can\nseriously deny, on the common sense criterion, that a\nperson who gets HMO coverage -- whether it's subject to a\nlaw like Kentucky's, is getting a far greater choice,\npotentially and, I presume, actually, since you're here,\nthan a person who signs up for an HMO without the choice\nguaranteed.\nMR. ECCLES: But --\nQUESTION: In a common sense way, someone is\ngetting a different kind of coverage, i.e., a breadth of\nchoice under the medical coverage, that otherwise wouldn't\nbe available.\nMR. ECCLES: I -- I think the common sense\napproach can be viewed by looking at this Court's decision\nin Royal Drug, and particularly if you look at the factual\nparallels with this case.\nIf the Kentucky statute, the general any willing\nprovider statute can be disaggregated into a bunch of\nseparate statutes, each about a different provider, that\nthe term, provider, includes podiatrists, physicians,\noptometrists, and pharmacists, so we have here effectively\none part of the statute is an any willing pharmacy\nstatute, that's functionally indistinguishable from the\nstatute that was before the case in Royal Drug.\nQUESTION: Well, considered by itself, if -- if\nyou simply narrow to the provider subcategory of\npharmacists, I -- I assume you're right, but if you look\nat the -- at the broad category that is covered by this\nstatute, there is one, I think, significant difference\nbetween this and the -- and the limited pharmacy coverage\nin Royal Drug. I think the difference is this. Pharmacy\ncoverage basically is -- is coverage for -- for benefits\nthat are fungible regardless of where you get them.\nThe super-aspirin, the industrial strength\nMotrin is going to be the same no matter what drug store\nyou get it from. Medical coverage, however, is not. It\nis really important to patients to -- to choose a doctor\nbecause of the personal relationship, and therefore, I\ndon't see the -- the precedential force of Royal Drug\nin -- in a physician coverage; a -- a physician option\nkind of case like this.\nMR. ECCLES: But under the Kentucky law, the\npatient has no right to choose the family doctor.\nQUESTION: Well, the -- the patient, in fact,\nis -- is given in practical terms a breadth of option.\nIt's true the patient can't force a doctor to sign up with\nthe HMO or force the HMO to take on a particular doctor,\nbut in practical terms, there are going to be more doctors\navailable under a Kentucky kind of regime, and in that\nsense, the patient is given a breadth of options that\notherwise wouldn't be available. That seems to me to be\nimportant when one is selecting physician coverage in a\nway that is not important when one is selecting drug store\ncoverage.\nMR. ECCLES: I -- I understand the point,\nJustice Souter, although the -- the option and the -- the\npreference don't match up perfectly. Even if there is a\nbroader range of options, they don't necessarily include a\ndoctor with whom the patient has a prior relationship.\nQUESTION: Absolutely -- absolutely right.\nMR. ECCLES: But returning to the pharmacy, it's\ntrue that the aspirin is all the same wherever you go, but\nthe -- the agreements at issue in Royal Drug, besides\ngiving the benefits of pure convenience, the ability to\nget the drug at the corner drug store, which is not\nnothing, also gave a very important financial advantage if\nyou -- if your pharmacy were participating, and --\nQUESTION: Yes, but another difference is,\nthere -- there is an any willing provider law here.\nThere's no any willing provider law in Royal Drug. There\nwas a private arrangement among the --\nMR. ECCLES: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- with the -- the Blue Cross.\nMR. ECCLES: That's correct, Your Honor, but the\neffect that the agreements that were being regulated in\nBlue -- with Blue Shield and Royal Drug, the Court held\nwere not part of insurance.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. ECCLES: And we have functionally the same\ntype of agreements here, an agreement between the HMO and\nthe pharmacy or other provider, and they also should not\nbe part of insurance. They're -- they're outside the\ninsurance relationship, and -- but it was important --\nI want to make this point, important potentially to the\npatients, the insureds in Royal Drug, that -- that their\npharmacy became a -- a participating pharmacy. It was not\ninconsequential.\nQUESTION: You mean just as a matter of\nconvenience?\nMR. ECCLES: Besides convenience, Mr. Chief\nJustice. The example in the Court's opinion was taken\nfrom the brief of the United States as amicus. They\nposited a 10-dollar drug at retail, and if you got it at a\nparticipating pharmacy it cost $2, if you got it at a\nnonparticipating pharmacy it cost 100 percent more, or $4.\nPresumably those numbers are indexed since 1979\nnow, and -- and greater, but it was of great interest to\nthe insured whether the pharmacy was participating or not.\nIt made a large cost difference, and yet the Court said it\nis not insurance in part because it was not affecting, was\nnot integral to, was not changing the legal rights of the\ninsured-insurer relationship.\nQUESTION: It's an antitrust case, then.\nMR. ECCLES: That's correct, Justice Breyer.\nQUESTION: I would think maybe that makes a\ndifference.\nMR. ECCLES: That's argued in the briefs that\nit -- that it makes a difference, and we understand it's\nan antitrust case. We -- we still think besides the\ndirect, factual parallel with the fact that Kentucky has\nan any willing pharmacy statute, that Royal Drug is still\nthe correct analysis for -- it gives the correct analysis\nas to the McCarran-Ferguson factors really for two\nreasons. One is, that's what this Court has applied\nconsistently in its Savings Clause case -- cases.\nIt -- it -- this Court said in the first Savings\nClause case, Metropolitan Life versus Massachusetts, that\nthe Royal Drug analysis was directly relevant to the ERISA\nSavings Clause, so it has the virtue of familiarity and\nprecedent, and the -- the standards, the McCarran factors\nmake sense here. They're objective factors that give some\ncontent to the subjective test, the common sense test.\nBut the -- the second piece of -- of the many\nattacks that have been made on the -- the relevance of\nRoyal Drugs in the brief is, it -- it's argued in the\nbrief that this Court in Fabe took a broader view, looked\nto a different clause of McCarran-Ferguson and said it's\nbroader, that insurance regulation can be a little\nbroader, and it's geared to protect the performance of the\ncontract, and we don't shy away from that. The any\nwilling provider laws have nothing to do with the\nperformance of the HMO policy here. They just do not add\nto that policy at all.\nIt's argued in the briefs through hypothetical\nexamples that they are effectively Kentucky's regulation\nof HMO's, the adequacy of the networks and so on, and we\nare accused of wanting to undo all regulation of HMO's.\nThat's not our position here. The line we would draw\nwould preserve most of the State's regulation of HMO's,\nbut these laws are not laws that are substantive\nregulation of insurance, the AWP laws. They are not\nadequacy laws. They are not continuity of care laws.\nKentucky has laws like that on its books.\nQUESTION: How would you characterize them?\nMR. ECCLES: I would characterize them as a law\nthat gives a right to a provider and makes it difficult\nfor HMO's and ERISA plans, but gives nothing of\nenforceable right to the insurers.\nQUESTION: Well, you -- you don't like the\nlabel, insurance. Would you call it a health care law?\nYou said it's not an -- an insurance law --\nMR. ECCLES: It -- it might be considered a\nhealth care law, Justice Ginsburg, that's correct, and in\nthat case, it would not come within the Savings Clause,\nbut it's a law that regulates the contracts between the\nproviders and the HMO's.\nNow, just to go back slightly over what I just\nsaid, we are not here challenging the basic concept of\nState regulation of HMO's. Where we think the Court has\ndrawn the line, and where we would urge that it continue\nto draw the line, is to say that a law regulates insurance\nif it affects risk-spreading, which this does not.\nThe risk here is the risk of financial loss from\nneeding medical care. ERISA actually has a helpful\ndefinition that makes that clear. The definition of an\nemployee welfare benefit plan, which is the kind of plan\nwe're dealing with here, is a plan that provides benefits\nfor medical, surgical, or hospital care, or benefits in\nthe event of sickness. That's the risk.\nQUESTION: I -- I recognize that we have the\nrisk-spreading and the factors, and then we have the\ncommon sense test -- we can all have tests floating around\nhere. It -- it seems to me that this just does regulate\ninsurance.\nMR. ECCLES: But it regulates only the\nnoninsurance relationships, Justice Kennedy. It -- it's\nexactly what the Court held was not insurance in Royal\nDrug. They're external to the insurance relationship, and\nthey don't change the insurance relationship at all.\nQUESTION: How do you -- what about Metropolitan\nLife? What about -- you have a -- you have a contract the\nState says -- I would have thought the harder thing, which\nI don't think any more, is, is -- is an HMO an insurer.\nWe went over that in that other case, Rush, and it's quite\nclear that 40 States regulate them as insurers, so we know\nthey're insurers.\nNow, if any State tells an insurer,\nMr. Insurance Company, when you write that contract, you\nhave to put in it mental health benefits, isn't that --\nthat's part of the business of insurance, or not?\nMR. ECCLES: That's absolutely regulation of the\nbusiness of insurance, and that's --\nQUESTION: All right. Now, here what they're\nsaying is, you have to put in, use any physician benefits.\nI mean, it's the same question.\nMR. ECCLES: Well, what --\nQUESTION: How do we -- how do you get out of\nthat?\nMR. ECCLES: Sure. The distinction is, our test\nis, effect the transfer of the risk, and in that case,\nthere is suddenly a new covered risk, the risk of needing\nmental health care is covered by the policy and, if that's\nnot at issue, and the Court has had recent decisions where\nit has not analyzed risk-spreading, found it unnecessary,\nit's always looked at the second McCarran factor. It's\nalways considered, you know, whether the legal rights of\nthe insured are being regulated here, are being protected\nby the State regulation in the insurer-insured\nrelationship, and in that mandated benefit case, they're\nclearly getting a new legal right which they do not have\nunder any willing provider.\nQUESTION: But you would not consider the -- the\nbenefit of having the selection among physicians as a\nbenefit?\nMR. ECCLES: That's -- in a colloquial sense, of\ncourse, if all these things fall into play.\nQUESTION: So you say it's purely financial. As\nlong as you pay the bills, that's the only thing the\ninsurance was intended to cover.\nMR. ECCLES: If all these eventualities fall\ninto place and you do have a broader choice, that's\nobviously, in a colloquial sense, of some benefit, but\nit's not what benefit means under, and insurance means\nunder the Court's Savings Clause process.\nQUESTION: Well, of course, the -- the criteria,\nthe way we refer to that criterion under the McCarran-\nWalter trio is -- is not in terms strictly of legal right,\nthough that will satisfy it. We ask whether it's integral\nto the policy relationship, and I suppose something can be\nintegral -- integral to the policy relationship even\nthough it is not expressed literally in terms of policy\nlanguage which grounds a conventional right.\nMR. ECCLES: That -- that's correct, Justice\nSouter, it is phrased in terms of, integral to the\nrelationship. However, when the Court has described that\nfactor in Pilot Life, in UNUM versus Ward, and Rush\nPrudential, it's used terms, Rush Prudential, a legal\nright to the insured enforceable against the HMO.\nQUESTION: No -- no question that that certainly\nis a -- an example of something that is integral.\nMR. ECCLES: Right.\nQUESTION: But I would suppose that the\ndifference in -- in the kind of policy choices that we've\nbeen talking about would be regarded as a -- by a\npotential HMO subscriber as -- as integral to what he is\npurchasing when he signs up with -- with one HMO rather\nthan another.\nMR. ECCLES: Our point -- in Pilot Life, the\nCourt described the second factor as not satisfied because\nthe, you know, the cause of action does not define the\nterms of the relationship, and we would say, you know,\nthat has not -- does not occur, either, under any willing\nprovider.\nIf there are no further questions, I'd reserve\nthe balance of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Eccles. Mr. --\nMs. Johnson, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH A. JOHNSON\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. JOHNSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nAs a matter of common sense, Kentucky's any\nwilling provider statutes regulate insurance because they\nare solely directed at the insurance industry. These\nstatutes apply only to Kentucky insurers issuing Kentucky\nhealth benefit plans. Petitioners are insurers regulated\nby the Commissioner of Insurance. The health benefit\nplans that they offer are exclusively regulated by the\nCommissioner of Insurance.\nThese statutes are located in subtitle 17A of\nthe Kentucky Insurance Code.\nQUESTION: But that's -- they could just as well\nhave been in something labeled, Health Code. This is not\nlike -- I mean, things that regulate risk, you'd say, oh\nyeah, I'm going to find that in the Insurance Code --\nMS. JOHNSON: That's --\nQUESTION: -- but here, wouldn't it have been --\nsuppose the law had been written to say that no doctor can\njoin a closed plan. It would be the same thing, wouldn't\nit?\nMS. JOHNSON: If that law was not in the\nInsurance Code, first of all it would not be enforceable\nby Commissioner Miller. Second of all, insurers are the\nonly entity that builds networks for the benefit of their\ninsured. When an insurer decides to offer a managed care\nplan, they tie in the network of providers to the benefit.\nThus, the terms in-network benefit, out-of-network\nbenefit. Therefore, if that law was on the books and was\nnot enforceable against the insurer, the insurer would\ncreate closed panels, and they wouldn't be able to have\nany doctors --\nQUESTION: Well, there would be the equivalent\nof disbarment. A doctor, a rule, a regulation of the\nmedical profession is, doctor, you cannot join a closed\nplan. It seems to me that would accomplish the very same\nthing, but it would be in their Health Code. Unlike some\nthings -- it can't be that everything that the Insurance\nCommissioner does is therefore regulating insurance within\nthe meaning of this legislation.\nMS. JOHNSON: That's correct, Justice Ginsburg,\nbut this Court has found that relevant to the inquiry, and\nthe fact that this is a insurance law that is only\ndirected toward those insurers regulated by the\nCommissioner of Insurance is very important, and it is\nrelevant, and the fact that these statutes are in subtitle\n17A of the Kentucky Insurance Code, which dictates the\nbenefits to be included in a Kentucky health benefit, and\nthe requirements for those insurers offering those plans.\nThe common sense test is also met because these\nstatutes regulate an insurance practice, and that practice\nis the practice of insurers offering managed care plans to\ncontract with providers for the benefit of their insureds.\nQUESTION: I -- I would -- I would be\nsympathetic to your case -- I -- I keep bumping up against\nthe Royal Drug case, where it seems to me all of the\npractical things you say about this case could have been\nsaid there. The -- the contract really is -- is altered,\nthe contract of the insured. Under one situation, he has\nto go to a certain drugstore, under another situation he\nhas his choice of drugstores which may provide lower cost.\nEven if it doesn't provide lower cost, it's a great\nconvenience to be able to go around the -- around the\ncorner, and yet we said that, you know, limiting the\nnumber of drugstores with whom the insured could deal did\nnot affect the business of insurance.\nMS. JOHNSON: Your Honor, Royal --\nQUESTION: How do you distinguish that from this\ncase?\nMS. JOHNSON: Your Honor, Royal Drug is both\nfactually and legally distinguishable from the present\ncase. First of all --\nQUESTION: I know it is factually. I don't care\nabout factually. Tell me why it's legally\ndistinguishable.\nMS. JOHNSON: Well, legally distinguishable is\nthat you're -- in Royal Drug you were looking at one\nFederal statute. In the present case, you're looking at\nanother. In Royal Drug --\nQUESTION: Well, now, wait. You -- you want us\nto abandon the -- the proposition that what constitutes\nthe business of insurance is the same under -- under the\nantitrust laws as it is --\nMS. JOHNSON: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: As it is here?\nMS. JOHNSON: I believe the --\nQUESTION: Unless you want us to abandon that,\nthen -- then what you've just said doesn't make any sense.\nMS. JOHNSON: No, Your Honor. I believe the\nanalysis in Royal Drug was -- was appropriate and -- and\naccurate for an antitrust analysis as opposed to analysis\nunder the Savings Clause, which this Court has said --\nQUESTION: So you say the same analysis does not\napply. You're saying that the McCarran-Ferguson criteria\ndo not necessarily apply to ERISA. I mean, maybe they\nshouldn't, but that's certainly new for --\nMS. JOHNSON: No, Your Honor, they are relevant,\nas this Court has said, but they are not required, and in\nthis Court --\nQUESTION: They are relevant but not required?\nMS. JOHNSON: In this, in Metropolitan Life this\nCourt came up with a -- a broader test than the common\nsense test, and that test is tested by the McCarran-\nFerguson factors that were developed in Royal Drug --\nQUESTION: I see.\nMS. JOHNSON: -- but they are not required.\nThey are relevant. They're guideposts.\nQUESTION: So the very -- the very factor that\nqualifies as -- the very same factor. Let's assume that\nthey were factually the same. The very same factor that\nqualifies as part of the business of insurance in our\nantitrust analysis could nonetheless qualify as not\nbusiness of insurance under ERISA, is that -- is that\nright?\nQUESTION: Vice versa.\nMS. JOHNSON: In an ERISA case, this Court\nstarts with --\nQUESTION: Vice versa means the same.\nMS. JOHNSON: -- the common sense test, and\nunder the common sense test this Court looks at whether or\nnot --\nQUESTION: No, but just answer yes or no to what\nI just said. I think you got -- I think you -- I think\nyou want to say yes.\nMS. JOHNSON: Would you please restate your\nquestion? Thank you.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Let's take the very same factor, like\nthe exclusion of certain pharmacies, which -- which was\nthe case in Royal Drug. That very same factor could\nconstitute the business of insurance under ERISA, and yet\nnot constitute the business of insurance under the\nantitrust laws, because we're applying a different test, a\ncommon sense test. Is that your position?\nMS. JOHNSON: The common sense test controls in\nERISA preemption analysis.\nQUESTION: So your answer to my question is yes\nor no?\nMS. JOHNSON: In your analysis is there a State\nlaw that requires, or is it the Royal Drug --\nQUESTION: Well, in the ERISA case there is, in\nthe antitrust case there isn't. I mean, that's what makes\nantitrust different from ERISA, I think.\nMS. JOHNSON: Right.\nQUESTION: But -- but they both focus on the\nvery same factor, the provision of -- the ability of the\ninsured to select pharmacists. Now, you say that that\ncould be the business of insurance for ERISA, and yet\ncould not be the business of insurance in antitrust cases.\nYes or no?\nMS. JOHNSON: Yes.\nQUESTION: Okay. I think that's the right --\nMS. JOHNSON: Yes. Yes. Yes.\nQUESTION: That's the right answer. I mean,\nfor --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: For you it's the right answer.\nMS. JOHNSON: Yes.\nQUESTION: But I'm not sure it's the right\nanswer for me.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. JOHNSON: Yes.\nQUESTION: And may I ask a follow-up question,\nthen? If the whole difference, then, is this, quote,\ncommon sense test --\nMS. JOHNSON: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- I'll tell you frankly what my\nproblem is. I read the Sixth Circuit opinion, I said,\nyes, that makes common sense, and I read Judge Kennedy's\ndissenting opinion and said, yes, that's common sense,\ntoo, so what --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: These -- these are rational judges on\nboth sides, they both made good arguments, and they both\nconformed to some sense of what goes on in the real world,\nso what is the common sense test?\n(Laughter.)\nMS. JOHNSON: Well, Justice Ginsburg, it's a\nvery broad test, and I -- I think it -- it's looking at\nthe whole picture, and the fact that this law is focused\non regulated insurers, risk-bearing entities that are\nunder the control of Commissioner Miller, and it regulates\ntheir insurance practices.\n20 years ago you might not have had the issue\nwhere providers -- that insurers were contracting with\nproviders for the benefit of insurers, but that is a -- a\nvery prevalent practice in the insurance industry today,\nand the State Departments of Insurance regulate that\npractice, and in Kentucky it's heavily regulated.\nOn page 15 of my brief, I -- I set forth many\nKentucky statutes that regulate the insurer's relationship\nwith the health care provider for the benefit of the\ninsured. These statutes were also set forth on page 2 of\nthe Solicitor General's brief. That is a common practice\nin -- in the insurance industry today, and it's a heavily\nregulated practice.\nThe --\nQUESTION: Also, I guess if you were taking the\nview that the language business of insurance could mean\ndifferent things for purposes of section 2(B) of McCarran-\nFerguson in here, you'd find support for that in Royal\nDrug itself, isn't it, which said that maybe the meaning\nof those words in 2(A) and 2(B), although they're the same\nwords, is different.\nMS. JOHNSON: It is different, and -- Your\nHonor, and in Royal Drug was -- this Court made it clear\nthat they were trying to decide whether an insurer's\npractice of entering into provider agreements was --\nconstituted the, quote, business of insurance for the\npurpose of meeting a very narrow exemption from the\nantitrust liability.\nQUESTION: Well, it isn't only that. I think\nthe statutory language refers to the regulation of the\nbusiness of insurance, and in the insurance case in Royal\nDrug there was no official regulation, only private\nregulation of the agreement, whereas in this case you have\npublic regulation, so it's conceivable that here you have\nregulation of insurance, and there you don't count a\nprivate agreement as the kind of regulation that the\nstatute's speaking about.\nMS. JOHNSON: That's true, Justice Stevens, and\nin --\nQUESTION: That isn't what the Court said\nthough, is it?\nQUESTION: Yes, it is.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: You can continue with your argument.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. JOHNSON: The McCarran-Ferguson factors are\nalso met. As the Sixth Circuit noted, the second factor\nis clearly met. These statutes regulate an integral part\nof the policy relationship between the insurer and the\ninsured.\nIn managed care plans, provider agreements are\nessential. In managed care plans, and under Kentucky law,\ncertificates of coverage cannot exist independently from\nthe provider directory. These statutes simply prohibit\ninsurers from arbitrarily limiting the number of providers\nthat they contract with for the benefit of their insureds.\nThese statutes allow insureds greater access to\nthe health care provider of their choice, and I think this\nis -- is clearly seen in KRS 304-17A-505(1)(k), which\nrequires the insurer to disclose that they are willing to\ncontract with any willing provider. This simply puts more\ncontrol to the insured in their relationship with their\nhealth care provider, which is a very personal and unique\nrelationship.\nQUESTION: Royal Drug says that the spreading of\nrisk is an indispensable characteristic of insurance. It\nthen holds that the pharmacy agreements do not involve any\nunderwriting or spreading of risk. Now, why aren't those\ntwo propositions as -- as true here as they were in Royal\nDrug, that the spreading of risk is the essence of -- of\ninsurance, and that an agreement between the provider of\nthe goods or services and the insurance company is not\npart of the spreading of risk?\nI mean, maybe Royal Drug is wrong, but I -- I\ndon't see -- I don't see how you -- how you get out of\nthat box.\nMS. JOHNSON: Well, again, Justice Scalia --\nQUESTION: And I don't like the, you know,\ncommon sense test, I know it when I see it. What I worry\nabout, the -- the common sense test is that we will\napprove those things that we like, and disapprove those\nthings that we don't like. I mean, who likes a private\nantitrust arrangement that -- that limits choice, so you\njust say, common sense, that's not the business of\ninsurance, and who doesn't like something that enables --\nenables the insureds to -- to have a greater selection\nin -- in doctors, so we say, common sense says, that is\nthe business of insurance.\nI -- I don't trust common sense.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: I -- I want some rule of law that --\nthat I can adhere to. I thought we had one in Royal Drug,\nand I -- I'm just not persuaded about why insurance is one\nthing there, and it's something else here. I mean, if --\nif, indeed, the spreading of risk is what insurance is\nabout, then --\nMS. JOHNSON: Your Honor, the Sixth Circuit did\nfind that Kentucky's any willing providers transfer or\nspread policyholder risk. As the Sixth Circuit noted,\nthese statutes open --\nQUESTION: But how does it spread the risk,\nactually? It's hard for me to see that it does that.\nMS. JOHNSON: Justice O'Connor, when a -- when\nan insurer sets up a managed care plan and structures\ntheir benefits to be in a managed care plan, they have\ntied in the network of providers to that benefit, and when\nyou have a statute on the books that allows the insured\nand the health care provider greater control to continue a\nrelationship, and common sense tells us that an -- an\ninsured will seek an out-of-network provider in order to\nensure continuity of care and that unique relationship,\nwhat these statutes do is, they --\nQUESTION: I -- I don't see how that spreads the\nrisk. I understand you think there's a practical benefit\nto the insureds --\nMS. JOHNSON: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- but how does it spread the risk,\nplease?\nMS. JOHNSON: It -- Your Honor, it increases the\nrisk for the insurer that the insured will not have to\nseek treatment from the out-of-network provider. However,\nas this Court has noted, all three McCarran-Ferguson\nfactors are not required to be met. This Court reiterated\nthat last term in Rush Prudential versus Moran.\nUnless there's any more questions, I will\nconclude by saying that Kentucky's any willing provider\nstatutes are laws that regulate insurance, and therefore\nare saved from ERISA preemption.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Johnson.\nMr. Feldman, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMR. FELDMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nQUESTION: Mr. Feldman, what would be an example\nof a measure which did spread the risk, as that term was\nreferred to in Royal Drug?\nMR. FELDMAN: Well, I think one example would in\nMetropolitan Life against Massachusetts, certainly I think\neverybody -- I understand everybody here to agree that a\nlaw that required an insurance policy to include insurance\nagainst a particular risk would spread the risk, but I\nthink what -- in this case also comes right -- it spreads\nthe risk at least for purposes of -- of ERISA for this\nreason. What this law is, is a condition on the spreading\nof risk, the insurer is saying, we are going to spread the\nrisk so long as you go to an in-network provider, and the\nState here is regulating that condition, and really it's\nanalogous -- it has to do with the performance of the\nrisk-spreading.\nQUESTION: So, you're -- you're saying the first\nMcCarran-Ferguson factor includes a provision that\ndetermines the way the insurer manages the risk, even\nthough it may not affect the risk as between the insurer\nand the insured.\nMR. FELDMAN: I think it does -- not quite.\nI think it actually does -- it does affect that risk,\nbut I think it's a condition --\nQUESTION: No, but I thought that was the\nargument you were making right then and there.\nMR. FELDMAN: It's a condition on the spreading\nof risk, or a condition on the performance of the\ninsurance contract, and in the Fabe case, which was a\nMcCarran-Ferguson Act case, but involved a different\nprovision of the McCarran-Ferguson Act than at issue in\nRoyal Drug and the Pireno case that followed it --\nQUESTION: Well, how, as a practical matter,\ndoes it affect the risk here? Is the -- is the risk\nincreased for the insurance company under this law because\nit -- under -- under the Kentucky law it has to pay for\nchiropractic services, where otherwise it would not, so\nthat's an increase in the risk? Is that -- is that your\npoint?\nMR. FELDMAN: It would -- I guess -- for you --\nit certainly could be -- I think semantically it could be\nsaid to just increase the risk in just that way. I think\nfor me, I'm more -- it's more comfortable to talk about\na -- it removes a condition on the spreading of risk. The\nrisk would be spread under -- without this law so long as\nyou go to a provider who the HMO has said we're going to\nlet into our network, whereas here --\nQUESTION: That's what -- that was going to be\nmy second question. It seems to me that's the risk-\nspreading.\nMR. FELDMAN: Right, and here the risk-spreading\nis so long -- we're going to spread this -- such-and-such\na risk, but so long as you go to any willing provider, and\nthat's a different condition.\nQUESTION: But it doesn't spread the risk.\nQUESTION: It doesn't.\nQUESTION: I mean, it just doesn't, does it?\nI mean, it's simply an ordinary -- it's -- what it's a\nregulation of is, if the risk eventuates, the insurer has\nto carry out his side of the bargain in this particular\nway.\nMR. FELDMAN: Right.\nQUESTION: It's a regulation of the goods or\nservices that an insurer provides.\nMR. FELDMAN: That -- that's correct.\nQUESTION: Now, if you're going to --\nQUESTION: And the risk is a condition, is a\nhealth condition of the patient that will be covered.\nMR. FELDMAN: Yes, but -- but it's really\nexactly the same as what this Court faced in Fabe,\nwhere --\nQUESTION: What's the name of the case?\nMR. FELDMAN: Department of Treasury against\nFabe. In that case, what was at issue was a priority\nstatute about how to distribute the assets of an insurance\ncompany after it has become insolvent, and it had nothing\nto do with the contract as to what -- what risks the\ninsurer was going to insure, but what the Court said is,\nit does have to do with the performance of that contract,\nbecause if the assets are spread in a certain way, the\ninsurer will actually get paid -- the insured will\nactually get paid if that risk results, and otherwise not.\nQUESTION: What -- what if the risk were tied --\nthe risk is that the patient becomes ill and needs --\nMR. FELDMAN: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- medical care, isn't it?\nMR. FELDMAN: Yes, and this is a condition on\nthat, but I don't --\nQUESTION: So -- so how -- how does this measure\nspread the risk, or why does it not spread the risk?\nMR. FELDMAN: It -- it operates as a condition\non the spreading of risk, because without this law,\nthere --\nQUESTION: Well --\nMR. FELDMAN: -- the risk will -- it's -- the\ninsurance policy says we -- you -- we will spread this\nrisk among all our insurers. If you get ill, we're going\nto pay for it so long as you satisfy a certain condition,\nand what this law does is, it alters what that condition\nis.\nQUESTION: Which is to say, it doesn't spread\nthe risk, so if the other case means you have to have a\nrisk, then you lose.\nMR. FELDMAN: Right, but the Court --\nQUESTION: But it doesn't -- I thought that that\nother case has -- since it involves the provision by an\ninsurer of goods and services, and a regulation of how,\nwhen the risk eventuates, it is pretty similar, and so the\ndifference is, what they say in footnote 18, I guess,\nwhich is probably what was going on here, which is that\nwe're interpreting not the McCarran Act's effort to allow\nStates to regulate insurance. We are interpreting what\nthey call the secondary purpose, and that purpose was to\nimpose a narrow -- narrower limitation on the reach of the\nantitrust laws.\nMR. FELDMAN: Right, and -- that is true, and\nthe Court repeated that in Royal Drug, and in Pireno, and\nin Fabe, in all of those McCarran-Ferguson Act cases it\nmade exactly that point, and it --\nQUESTION: But is that the key distinction, or\nis there another one, too?\nMR. FELDMAN: Well, I think that's the most\nimportant one, but there's a number that are related. In\nthe ERISA context, for example, the Court has added -- the\nCourt said, well, we first look as a matter of common\nsense at the insurance policies. It didn't just say, we\nare going to apply the McCarran-Ferguson Act to ERISA, and\nit shouldn't be surprising that there are therefore some\ndifferences between the two, or otherwise it would have\nbeen unnecessary for the Court, as the primary test, to\nlook at the policy as a whole.\nSecond, in the ERISA context, the Court has\nspecifically said that not all three factors are necessary\nto be found in order to find that something regulates\ninsurance.\nQUESTION: This is all very sophisticated, but\nI -- it just seems to me that what constitutes the --\ninsurance in one -- in one situation ought to constitute\ninsurance in another, and it --\nQUESTION: It's just common sense.\nQUESTION: -- it's just common sense.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: And -- and what -- and what we're\ndoing when we -- when we deny it is -- is exercising\npolicy judgments about whether we think the -- the\nparticular thing that's been done is desirable or not\ndesirable.\nMR. FELDMAN: I -- I don't -- I don't think\nthat's correct, and I -- I don't think it should be\nsurprising that there are some differences between ERISA\nand the McCarran-Ferguson Act, not only because of the\npolicy differences, but there's a noted difference in\nlanguage between what -- the statute that the Court was\nconstruing in Royal Drug and in Pireno, and with the one\nit's construing here.\nQUESTION: So you don't think that the -- that\nunder ERISA it's important that what is regulated is the\nbusiness of insurance?\nMR. FELDMAN: Well, ERISA just says, regulate\ninsurance.\nQUESTION: I understand that, so you think it\ndoesn't have to be the business of insurance. It -- it\ncould be other aspects of the insurance -- of the\ninsurance company?\nMR. FELDMAN: I think the Court recognized that\nthere can be a difference --\nQUESTION: Right. Like what buildings the\ninsurance companies have to be in, and other things?\nMR. FELDMAN: No, but I --\nQUESTION: I mean, once you depart from the\nbusiness of -- the business of insurance concept in the\nMcCarran-Ferguson line of cases, it seems to me, was\nessential to make sense of it, and it's just as essential\nto make sense of the ERISA prescription, it seems to me.\nMR. FELDMAN: I think it's because of the\ndifference in language that the Court from Metropolitan\nLife on has adopted a different analysis in ERISA, and\nthere's actually two differences. One is that in Royal\nDrug and in Pireno, which involved the antitrust exemption\nthat has to be narrowly construed, you were just talking\nabout a -- a law that is -- that is in -- that is -- the\nbusiness of insurance.\nIn the Fabe case, which involved the other part\nof McCarran-Ferguson, which saved State laws in the areas\nof traditional, in the area of traditional State\nregulation, it talks about regulating the business of\ninsurance.\nIn ERISA, you're now one step farther away,\nbecause now it just says, regulate insurance, and I think\nthose laws are differently worded, and there's every\nreason to give them a somewhat different scope.\nQUESTION: Have we ever --\nQUESTION: Have you --\nQUESTION: -- analyzed a case that way in\nsolving these problems? Have we ever relied on that\ndifference in language, Mr. Feldman?\nMR. FELDMAN: Well, in the -- I think the Court\nin the Pireno case, for -- oh, the difference in language?\nQUESTION: Of regulation of insurance versus\nregulating the business of insurance?\nMR. FELDMAN: I -- I don't think the Court has\nrelied on that specific --\nQUESTION: No.\nMR. FELDMAN: -- language in any of its cases so\nfar, because in most of the cases everything has lined up\nand it hasn't had to, but I will say that in the ERISA\ncases, there's now a couple of them where the Court has\nmade clear that all three of the McCarran-Ferguson\nactors -- factors don't have to be applied in ERISA, and\nthe Court has never reached that conclusion under the\nantitrust exemption in the McCarran-Ferguson Act.\nQUESTION: Well, that would be ridiculous to\nreach it, since the three factors are what the McCarran-\nFerguson Act is.\nMR. FELDMAN: Right, but by recognizing that\nthey -- that they're not all -- specifically holding that\nthey're not all necessary in ERISA, I think the Court\nagain recognized that there can be a divergence in --\nbetween the two areas.\nQUESTION: And one reason, I suppose, is the\npresumption against preemption which we are trying to\nmaintain in ERISA.\nMR. FELDMAN: That's right. That's right.\nAnd I -- I would like to add one other thing\nabout the -- what's been called the common sense test,\nwhich is, I do think the Court has given substantial\ncontent to it in its cases. It talks about a regulation\nthat homes in on the insurance industry, or is aimed at\nthe insurance industry. It is relevant how the State\ncodified it because, as the Court said in -- as recently\nas Rush, I think, the term insurance acquires its\ncoloration and meaning from State law, State practice, and\nState usage, because what Congress was trying to do was\npreserve State law in an area of traditional State\nauthority, and therefore, the codification in the\nInsurance Code is of relevance.\nAnd finally, at the very least, a State law that\naffects the contract between the insured and the insurer,\nwhich this one does, has a necessary effect on that\ncontract and, in fact, a substantial one. That, although\nwhat is insurance may be broader than that, something that\ndoes satisfy that I think clearly is insurance under\nthe -- the common sense --\nQUESTION: Mr. Feldman, can I ask you a\nquestion? Do you suppose, if, in the Royal Drug\nsituation, there had been an insurance regulation that\nrequired the insurance company to give the patient an\noption between generic and nongeneric drugs, that that\nwould have been the regulation of the business of\ninsurance?\nMR. FELDMAN: I think it probably would have\nbeen, and I -- I think that would, of course, have been\nanalyzed under the other half of the McCarran-Ferguson Act\nif it was a State regulation of that sort.\nThat concludes my -- Thank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Feldman.\nMr. Eccles, you have 2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT N. ECCLES\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. ECCLES: I'll address four points, if I may.\nFirst, as to the argument that a condition is\nremoved in the policy by operation of Kentucky law, that's\nnot true. Before and after the Kentucky law, the\ncondition on getting payment from a -- from a\nparticipating physician is identical. All that's changed\nis that outside network. The law, just so I'm clear, does\nnot, by itself, require a network to admit a chiropractor\nwhen it has no chiropractic coverage. That's a different\nlaw. If it did that, we would say that definitely affects\nthe legal rights of the insured and would be a mandated\nbenefit law such as the Court sustained.\nSecond point, we are not -- a comment was made\nby counsel for the Commissioner about regulations of\nproviders providing benefits to the insurers. Some do,\nand those -- the line we would draw, say, if it's a\nregulation of a provider such as a continuity of care,\nsuch as a hold harmless provision that prevents the\nprovider from billing for the balance above the network\nrate, that clearly affects the legal rights of the\ninsured, and would be saved under our test.\nThird, Royal Drug, it's this Court's precedents\nthat have said the Royal Drug analysis is directly\nrelevant to the ERISA Savings Clause. It was the dissent\nin Royal Drug who said that pharmacy agreement is integral\nto the relationship. You can't have it without -- you\ncan't have the insurance without the pharmacy agreement,\nbut that was said in the dissent. The Court rejected that\nview, and who is in the participating network is not part\nof the benefit of the insured. The insured just has no\nright to decide what doctor to go to, or any legal right.\nTo address -- fourth and finally, to address\nperhaps more concisely the question of why do we care, if\nthis isn't going to expand the networks, it's -- it hurts\nus even if the network doesn't expand in the slightest\nbecause if nothing changes, if no choices or options are\nexpanded, the uncertainty that has resulted is added to\nthe administrative cost. It's affected the ability to be\nselective. You have these networks --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Eccles.\n"
