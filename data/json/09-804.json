        "content": "(10:07 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Case 09-804, Cigna\nCorporation v. Amara.\nMr. Olson.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nCongress crafted a carefully balanced ERISA\nenforcement scheme that enables plan participants to\nrecover plan benefits under section 502(a)(1)(B) and\nequitable remedies for ERISA violations under section\n502(a)(3).\nIn this case, Respondents are seeking a\nremedy for misleading plan summaries that violated\nERISA. Their remedy, if they were harmed by defective\nplan summaries, is under 502(a)(3), equitable remedies,\nnot for plan benefits under 502(a)(1)(B). The section\nthat governs the relief that is sought is a necessary\nantecedent to any of the other questions in this case,\nand ERISA carefully structures, and this Court has\nrepeatedly said the Court is not interested and does\nnot -- is not willing to alter the structure that\nCongress carefully crafted and carefully developed over\nthe years to provide remedies with respect to ERISA\nprograms.\nAnd the scheme is such that, if there is a\nparticipant to the plan who is seeking benefits under\nthat plan, section (a)(1)(B) of -- subsection (a)(1)(B)\nof section 502 provides for relief under the plan. If\nthere are other violations of ERISA, section 502(a)(3)\nprovides for equitable relief. That is the scheme\ncarefully developed by Congress.\nNow, in this case what happened is that\nCigna changed its pension program, its ERISA plan, from\na defined benefit plan to a cash benefit plan, a cash\nvalue plan. And it put out, as required by ERISA,\nsummaries of the new plan that the district court found,\nand the court of appeals affirmed, were misleading in -\nin the sense that they did not provide all of the\ninformation necessary for plan participants to evaluate\nwhat was happening.\nNow, the changes to the plan were lawful.\nERISA permitted and does permit these kind of changes to\nan ERISA plan. There was nothing unlawful about the\nplan and the plan change. And the beneficiaries, the\nparticipants to the plan, did not have any choice.\nCigna had the right to change the plan. It did change\nthe plan.\nIt did have an obligation under ERISA to\nprovide accurate summaries, and the district court and\nthe court of appeals found that those summaries were not\ninaccurate. In other words -- they were not accurate.\nIn other words -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Olson, when you say\nthe employees had no choice, but the district court\nfound, didn't it, that the reason for this plan summary\nbeing misleading was that the employer, Cigna, feared\nthat there might be a backlash on the part of the\nemployees if they found out, if they were told the truth\nabout this plan; that is, that it was less favorable,\nthat they would not have the same benefits that they had\nunder the prior plan?\nMR. OLSON: That is correct, Justice\nGinsburg. They had no choice in the sense that Cigna\ncould adopt a change in the plan, as it did. That was\npermitted under ERISA, but it was required to give\naccurate summaries.\nThe choice that you're suggesting and the\ndistrict court was concerned about is that an individual\ncould have left the employ of Cigna if he or she was\nunhappy with the change in the plan, or the district\ncourt said there could have been some sort of a protest.\nWhat we're saying is that the remedy -\nwhat was -- what was the violation is the summary\nitself. And we're not -- we're not challenging that\nhere. That's a finding below. The summary was\nmisleading, but that makes it a violation of ERISA. The\nsummary is not the plan. And -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Olson, we have\nseveral times referred to the plan as having a range of\ndocuments associated with it, not as having just a\nsingle written instrument, but we referred to documents\nand instruments governing the plan. We did that in\nCurtiss-Wright, which is the case that you pin so much\non. We did that in Kennedy.\nAnd the statute itself talks about that on\nnumerous occasions, that there are documents and\ninstruments, in the plural. And one would think that\nthe SPD is -- is one of those documents and instruments\nthat govern the plan.\nMR. OLSON: It's quite clear from the\nstructure of the statute that is correct, as you\nsuggest, that there may be multiple instruments or\ndocuments that are the -- create the plan itself. But\nthe summary plan document, the SPD, is not a part of the\nplan. It is a separate document. It is a summary. It\nis a succinct statement of what might be in the plan,\nand it must be accurate, and it must be written in\ncomprehensible English.\nBut I would refer the Court to section 1024\n(b)(2) and (4), which are on pages 3a, 4a, and 5a of the\nblue brief. That describes the obligations that are\nrequired with respect to the summary plan document. And\nit describes the instruments of both the summary plan\ndocument and the instruments that constitute the plan\nitself in the following sentence -- and this is a\nsimilar sentence in subsection (4), but I'm reading from\nsubsection (2), which is on 4a of the blue brief.\nIt says: \"Summary plan\" -- it refers to \"a\nsummary plan description and the latest annual report\nand\" -- or other -- \"and the bargaining agreement, trust\nagreement, contract, or other instruments under which\nthe plan was established.\"\nThe construction of that sentence has to be\nthat the summary plan description is a separate\ndocument. It is not one of those latter category of\ndocuments under which the plan was established. And the\nproof of that, if -- if English doesn't teach it to us,\nwhich I think it does, is the reference to the annual\nreport. No one would say and no one would contend that\nthe annual report is a part of the instruments creating\nthe plan.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I was struck by\nsomething else, Mr. Olson. I was struck by the fact\nthat the -- that the statute saying what is in the\nsummary plan description is packed with information that\nneeds to be in the summary plan description. By\ncontrast, the written instrument, which you equate to\nthe plan, the written instrument says barely anything\nabout what has to be in it. It just says the name of\nthe fiduciaries has to be in the written instrument.\nSo it seems clear that this statute is set\nup so that everything that is important, everything that\nthe employee needs to know and needs to rely upon, is\nsupposed to be in the SPD, not necessarily in the\nwritten instrument.\nMR. OLSON: Well, the written instruments,\nas these things turn out, are long, complex documents.\nThey may be 90, 100 pages long. The summary, as you\nsuggest, Congress said, yes, there is a separate\ndocument that must state in intelligible English that\nplan participants can understand the following things,\nand they must be furnished to plan participants, but\nthey are not the plan document. The way that ERISA is\nstructured, it -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Am -- are we missing\nsomething? They -- they cannot be in the SPD unless\nthey are in the plan; isn't that right?\nMR. OLSON: Well -- if the -- if the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So -- so the one cannot be\nmore detailed than the other, can it?\nMR. OLSON: The plan can be more detailed\nthan the SPD.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right. But what -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But can't the SPD -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Whatever is in the SPD must\nbe in the plan; isn't that right?\nMR. OLSON: Well, if the plan is -- if the\nSPD complies with ERISA, yes. It has to be -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. That's what I'm\ntalking about, of course.\nMR. OLSON: Yes. Yes, exactly. But not\neverything that is in the plan, or the plan -- as the\nstatute says, the documents that constitute the plan\nneed not necessarily be in the summary. The words\n\"summary plan\" -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Olson, what about\nthe opposite? Because the statute seems to be written\nso that things are in the SPD which don't need to be in\nthe written instrument. And together, they all somehow\nconstitute the plan.\nMR. OLSON: Well, I -- I submit that that is\nnot the way the statute is written, and subsections (2)\nand (4) of the provision that I was referring to make\nthat clear if the word \"summary\" itself did not make\nthat clear. But the Curtiss-Wright case to which you\nreferred to in your earlier question also proves that.\nCurtiss-Wright case talked about a summary\nplan description and said it can't modify the plan -\nusing \"plan,\" \"summary plan description,\" in different\nterms -- it cannot modify the plan, which is what the\ndistrict court here held, unless the plan specifically\nsays that it may be modified in a certain way and that\nthe summary is an appropriate amendment to the plan. So\nthe Court -- and this was a unanimous decision of this\nCourt -- was referring to the summary as something that\nwas separate, that might modify the plan if the plan\nitself allows for it to be modified in that fashion.\nNow, the Government says that the summary\nplan description is a part of the plan and so do\nRespondents. And that's what the court below -- the\ncourt below didn't actually find that the SPD was a part\nof the plan. The court found, on the latter pages of\nits opinion, that it was a modification, it was an\namendment to the plan. That's inconsistent with the\nCurtiss-Wright case because in this case the plan itself\nspecifically says that it cannot -- does not say that it\ncan be amended by the SPD.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that what the\ndistrict court said was that they would treat the plan\nas containing what the summary said, not that -- that it\nwas part of the plan itself, not an amendment,\namendment. I thought that was what the district court\nsaid.\nMR. OLSON: I think in the -- on page of\nthe -- this is of -- this is the summary to the cert\npetition, page 218, which is the district court's -- the\nconclusions of the district court's decision. Under\nRoman numeral VIII, the district court specifically said\nthat the terms of Part B have been correspondingly\nmodified by the SPDs.\nThe court was saying -- I think you were\nreferring, Justice Ginsburg, to the relief that the\ncourt ordered, but the court was ordering that relief on\nthe theory that the SPDs modified the plan. And the\nplan itself, under Curtiss-Wright, doesn't provide for\nit to be amended in that way. And the SPDs -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It can't be part of the\nplan without modifying the plan, can it?\nMR. OLSON: That's -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Because it contradicts\nother provisions.\nMR. OLSON: That's correct. And the SPDs,\nthe two SPDs themselves, on page 922a and 938a of the\nJoint Appendix, specifically say that if there's any\ndiscrepancy between the SPD and the plan, the plan\ngoverns. The language is at the bottom of, for example,\nat the bottom of 922a. So -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But the SPD can't negate the\nforce of ERISA, and if ERISA says that the summary has\nto be consistent with the plan documents, nothing in the\nSPD can negate that requirement.\nMR. OLSON: That's correct. No one -- but\nCongress did consider prohibiting a provision like that\nin SPDs, that they could not disclaim, they could not\nsay that if there's any inconsistency, the plan\ngoverned, and Congress did not adopt such a provision.\nThis is a perfectly legal provision, to tell\nsomeone that if there's any discrepancy -- and there's\nbound to be discrepancies, the -- as I said, the plans\nthemselves can be 90, 100 pages, very long and very\ncomplex. That's why there is an SPD that can't contain\neverything in the plan.\nAnd one of the things that would be the\noutcome of what the Government and Respondents are\nurging here is that plan creators, these companies that\ncreate these plans, either will be discouraged from\ndoing it, or they will start preparing summaries that\nare 90 and 100 pages long so they -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But they can't do that\nbecause the statute requires the summary to be\nunderstandable and not prolix.\nMR. OLSON: That's Catch 22, because if\nthere's a -- if there's a discrepancy because they have\nto be short, summary, and intelligible, then we have -\nwe're faced with the proposition that someone's going to\nsay, well, I read the SPD and it didn't say what was in\nthe plan. If the SPD is as long and as detailed as the\nplan, then there's a violation of ERISA.\nMy point I guess in this is that, yes,\nJustice Kagan, the statute requires the SPD to contain\ncertain information. We accept the fact of the\nconclusions of the court below in this case that they\ndid not do so. There are two SPDs. They failed to live\nup to the -- to the requirements of ERISA. There is a\nremedy for that. It is a violation of ERISA, and it\nspecifically says in 502(a)(3) that for violations of\nERISA, equitable remedies are available. And that is\nwhat Congress decided. It is -- unless it's a part of\nthe plan, you must go under (a)(3).\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But the very question here\nis if there is an SPD that is inconsistent in some way\nwith the written instrument, what happens? Is the\nwritten instrument modified or, instead, is the\nprovision in the SPD given operative effect? And that\nquestion is one about your benefits under the plan.\nMR. OLSON: I would submit that it can't\nmodify the plan unless the plan permits that. That's\nCurtiss-Wright. That's a unanimous decision of this\nCourt.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I do think you're\nover-reading Curtiss-Wright. Curtiss-Wright talked\nabout whether a particular provision satisfied the\nrequirement that a plan have an amendment provision. It\ndidn't say anything at all about whether there are\nprovisions that can have operative effect regardless of\nwhether they pass through a formal amendment procedure.\nMR. OLSON: It seems to me -- I think we\nmight disagree about that, respectfully. I think that\nthe sense of the opinion in Curtiss-Wright was that if\nyou're going to say that this SPD modifies the plan, it\ncan only do so if the plan permits the SPD to modify the\nplan. Then the Court sent it back to a lower court to\ndetermine whether in fact the employees that were\ninvolved in creating the SPD there had the authority\nunder the plan to modify the plan -- was it done -\nJUSTICE BREYER: So far we're just\ndiscussing, I take it, whether under (1) the other side\nis entitled to their benefits even if they weren't hurt,\non a contract theory.\nMR. OLSON: That -\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. But I thought\nwe took the case to decide a different issue.\nMR. OLSON: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that is -- I'll assume\nyou're right -- it should have come under (3). But I\ndon't know if that's harmful, whether it was (3) or (1).\nAnd the question I thought we were to decide was, if\nyou're under (3), say, where equity is at issue, now\nequity is at issue and the district court says: Here we\nhave 27,000 people, and now here's how I'm going to go\nabout this. I'm going to look at this provision mistake\nhere, and the mistake it seems to me was likely to cause\nthem harm. And once that's shown -- and they showed it,\nit's likely to cause it harm; we can't be sure, but it's\nlikely -- then it's up to your client to refute case by\ncase that these guys were not -- or women were not\nreally harmed. Okay?\nNow, that seems very sensible to me. And -\nand if that's the issue we're going to decide, I'd like\nto hear you explain why that isn't sensible. It's an\nequitable matter. This is simply a way of going about\nit. What's wrong with that?\nMR. OLSON: Well, in the first place, it is\nimportant which section that -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I agree, but I don't\nunderstand -- I'm with you on this one so far.\nMR. OLSON: Okay. Okay. Because it's a\ndifferent defendant. The plan is the defendant versus\nthe plan administrator is the defendant. So that's\nimportant.\nSecondly, (a)(3) provides only for remedies\nthat are available in equity. Then the point that you\n-- that you're making with respect to what provision of\nequity, what is the -- what is the action that's brought\nand what is the remedy sought, as this Court talked\nabout in the Varity case, and so therefore those are\nthose questions.\nNow, the Second Circuit said \"likely\nharmed.\" The fact is, as I pointed out at the very\nbeginning, this was a lawful change in a plan and it's a\nplan where 27,000 people that were employees were\nparticipants in this plan and they would have had to do,\nas Justice Ginsburg suggested, either leave the company\nand suffer some harm or engage in some -\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're sounding to me as if\nyou're saying there wasn't likely harm. Okay.\nMR. OLSON: Except -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Are you conceding that the\nstandard that they used, that the standard was -- the\nquestion that you raised at the beginning, whether -\nwhether the showing of likely harm is sufficient in the\nabsence of a rebuttal?\nMR. OLSON: Absolutely we are not, and so -\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. That's what I\nwant to hear: What's the argument against that\nstandard?\nMR. OLSON: Six circuit courts of appeals\nhave held that -- that detrimental reliance is required.\nIf -- if this is an action under (a)(3) under equity,\nneither the Government nor the Respondents dispute the\nfact that detrimental reliance would be required if\nyou're proceeding in equity under (a)(3).\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. And does\n\"likely harm\" capture that idea?\nMR. OLSON: \"Likely harm\" is not a\ndemonstration of prejudicial reliance.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why not? Why not?\nMR. OLSON: That's the -\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's the kind of harm\nthey mean. What they mean -\nMR. OLSON: Because --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- by harm is they were\nhurt, brought about by reliance.\nMR. OLSON: Well, in the first place, it\ncomes out of the blue, \"likely harm,\" as I suggested,\nsince this was a legal, lawful change. People were\ngoing to retain their employment. They didn't have a\nright to opt for one or the other. If they could prove\nthat they were -- this is -\nJUSTICE BREYER: You object to this decision\nsaying the following: Of course, the lower court said\nlikely harm is necessary. As we understand it, given\nthe context of equity, what that means here is that\nthere was reason to believe -- reason to believe -- it\nwas probable that, or some words like that, that there\nwould have been harm caused by reliance on the -- the\nmisstatement.\nMR. OLSON: I -- that would not be justified\nat all. I mean, under equity, as this Court said in the\nLyng v. Payne case, which is cited in the briefs, this\nis like an estoppel action. An essential element of an\nestoppel action is detrimental reliance on the adverse\nparty's misrepresentation.\nWhat the district court below did was, by\ncoming up with this \"likely harm\" harm thing, is throw\nthe burden over to the plan or the plan administrator\nand saying: Demonstrate that any one of your -- all of\nyour 27,000 members of this purported class somehow were\nhurt by a change in a plan over which they had no\ncontrol, over which they had no discretion, unless they\nwere going to leave the -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But wasn't the -- wasn't\nthe meaning of \"likely harm\" simply that they were\npromised one thing in the plan document, and so what\nlikely harm is, is we have to do away with what they\ncall, what is it, \"the wear-away effect\"? So that's the\nharm, the wear-away effect, and we have to remedy that.\nAnd the way to remedy it is to treat this as, what is\nit, instead of (a) or (b), (a) plus (b)?\nMR. OLSON: And that would be an action to\nseek benefits under the plan, which would be an\n(a)(1)(B) action against the plan itself.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. OLSON: Against the plan. The record\nsuggests in various parts -- I can't remember exactly\nwhich page to refer to -- that $70 million would be the\nconsequence of this against the plan, on which some\npeople, depending upon how long they were with the\ncompany, when they left the company, whether they were\nabout to retire, whether they stayed longer and the\ninterest rates fluctuated, there can be all --\ninnumerable permutations of the effect upon persons -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Then you can't -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Excuse me, Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Then you can't\nrequire, it seems to me, each individual to make a\ncalculation about whether they have actually been\nharmed, whether there's detrimental reliance. The whole\npoint of these plans is to give people some comfort and\nassurance when they are age whatever, that: Don't\nworry; retirement is taken care, or at least I can rely\non that.\nAnd your formulation would sort of put that\nup in the air and say: We don't know if you're going to\nbe harmed or not; wait until you're 65 and we will see.\nMR. OLSON: Well, Chief Justice --\nMr. Chief Justice, that is the statute. The statute\ngives you relief with respect to a misleading plan\nsummary under the laws of equity. The laws of equity\nwould require that the person say -- demonstrate in some\nway that they were harmed. The petition -- the\nRespondents in this case, the named members of the\nclass, claim that they were out 30-some thousand dollars\neach. They would have an incentive to bring an action\nby themselves.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it couldn't be --\nMR. OLSON: Under the rules -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it couldn't be\nbrought as a class action, and isn't that a large piece\nof this picture, that proceeding as they did they can\nproceed as a class? Proceeding under detrimental\nreliance, it would be hard to get a class because it\nwould be an individual case of detrimental reliance.\nMR. OLSON: The Rules Enabling Act provides\nthat a class mechanism cannot change the substantive\nprovisions of law. And so, it cannot be that, because\nthis is brought as a class action, the rules of equity\nsomehow change.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then the question is,\nunder the -- under the section that the district court\nproceeded under, not the one that you say is proper, a\nclass action would be appropriate.\nMR. OLSON: A class action might be\nappropriate, but it would not change the detrimental\nreliance requirement. Again, this -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, turning to (a)(3), I\nhave two questions. One is, as you -- and this is\nprobably for your friends on the other side more than\nyou. But as you understand the \"likely harm\" standard\nthat prevails in the Second Circuit, is it likely harm\nto a majority of the members of the class, all of the\nmembers of the class? Do you know? Has the Second\nCircuit told us what that means?\nMR. OLSON: Yes, well, the Second Circuit\nsuggested, and the Government and Respondents,\nparticularly the Respondents, say if there's a material\ndifference, likely harm is presumed. And the Government\nitself says -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Likely harm to whom? I\nthink that's the question -\nMR. OLSON: That is the question.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that Justice Kennedy is\nasking, and I have the same question. Does it mean\nlikely -- is it likely that the class as a whole has\nbeen harmed, or that each -- is it likely that each\nindividual member of the class has been harmed?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Or -- or a significant\nnumber?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or a majority? Or\nwhatever?\nMR. OLSON: Yes, I -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What does \"likely harm\"\nmean? Do we know that?\nMR. OLSON: And I -- I totally agree with\nthe import of those questions. You can't describe that,\nin this Court --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: My question had no import.\nI really wanted to know the answer to that.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. OLSON: Well, the answer -- the answer\nis what the district court ordered and the Government\nseeks and the Respondents seek, is they're all harmed by\nthis, that there's any material disparity, then\neverybody -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Maybe it wouldn't be too\nhard. They're -- they're joined as members of the class\nin light of a certain set of characteristics, and the\njudge would find that, other things being equal,\nindividuals who have that set of characteristics which\nin this circumstance make them members of the class\nwould be harmed in all likelihood, okay? Done.\nNow, it's up to -- it's up to the -- the\ndefendant then to show that in a particular case this\nindividual wasn't harmed.\nMR. OLSON: It defies reality -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why?\nMR. OLSON: -- Justice Breyer, to suggest\nthat the 27,000 people -- each one occupy a different\nposition in terms of the length of their employment,\nwhen they might be retiring, what their benefits might\nbe, whether they might take a lump sum or an annuity.\nAll of those thing are different. And the only way they\ncan -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, it depends on the\nfacts. Maybe they have a union or -\nMR. OLSON: The only way they could have\nbeen harmed, Justice Breyer, is if they had otherwise\ndecided to leave the employ of the company and go\nsomeplace else. They could demonstrate that.\nIf I could save my time -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Your white light is -\njust one more thing. If you proceed under (a)(3),\ndoesn't Mertens bar the award of -- of monetary damages?\nMR. OLSON: I think it would. I mean, this\nCourt -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then -- then you're\nnot offering us much. You say: Oh, please go under\n(a)(3), but then you go back and say: Oh, well, you\ncan't get monetary damages.\nMR. OLSON: In the first place, that's\nCongress's choice. It's an equitable remedy that would\nbe required. Congress made that decision. This Court\nhas said it's not going to reconstruct what Congress\ncarefully did.\nThe thing is that it would have to balance\npeople wanting to create these plans and go into these\nplans and the solvency and stability of the plan; what\nJustice Breyer is suggesting, and the Second Circuit\nsuggested, is that you would expose plans to enormous\nliability because someone might think that someone might\nhave left the employ of the -- of the company and taken\na different job. That's not realistic. And -- and\nthat's why it just came out of -- out of thin air.\nIf I may -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Olson.\nMr. Bruce.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. BRUCE\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. BRUCE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nOur position is that detrimental reliance is\nnot found in section 102 of ERISA, which establishes the\nsummary plan description requirement. It's not found in\nsection 404(a)(1)(D) of ERISA, which establishes the\nfiduciary duty that's in accordance with the plan\ndocuments and instruments, plural, insofar as consistent\nwith the provisions of this title.\nIt's also not consistent with any language\nin section 502(a), either in 502(a)(1)(B) or 502(a)(3).\nThe reference to equitable relief is to appropriate\nequitable relief to redress a violation of Title I or a\nviolation of the terms of the plan.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that seems to me\nlike just a roundabout, complex way of saying that you\nmust recover under the plan, because if reliance is not\nrequired then there must be some basis on which you must\nrecover, and that recovery must be under the plan. So\nit's -- it's -\nMR. BRUCE: Well, the -- the -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, if you say -- if\nyou say injury is not required, then -- then I don't see\nhow the SPD can give you recovery, unless the SPD is the\nplan, which brings us right back to the argument, which\nis your argument, under the first -- under the first\nsection, under (a) -\nMR. BRUCE: Under either (a) -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- (a)(1), (a)(1).\nMR. BRUCE: Under -- our understanding is\nthat under either (a)(1)(B) or (a)(3), that the court is\neffectively providing an injunction in a case like this,\nwhere -- where an action violates the statute. And here\na plan provision which had a very detrimental effect on\npeople was not disclosed to them, and so the effect of\nthe statute is to make that unfavorable provision\nineffective. And so --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If the -- if the SPD is part\nof the plan, then where does the \"likely harm\" standard\ncome from?\nMR. BRUCE: I think, as we've said in our\nbrief, we think that the likely harm, possible\nprejudice, and the material conflict that -- that is\nused in the Third Circuit in Burstein, we think that all\nof those standards are very similar, that they are\nreally looking at whether it -\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, but why is there any\nrequirement whatsoever, other than the fact that it's in\nthe plan? If the SPD is the plan and the SPD says you\nget certain benefits that you wouldn't get under the\nwritten document, then -- the previously executed\nwritten document, then you get the benefits under the\nSPD, period. It doesn't matter whether there's likely\nharm or reliance or anything else, right?\nMR. BRUCE: Well, I think, Justice Alito, we\nsee this more as a nondisclosure issue, that the\nunfavorable provisions in the plan were not disclosed,\nand that the effect of the statute is to make those\nunfavorable plan provisions ineffective. But because\nthe statute refers to, for example, material\nmodifications and being sufficiently comprehensive and\nreasonably apprising, that there are enough\nqualifications in there where the court can look and\nsee, is this really -- was this conflict, was it really\nabout something that was significant to people that\nmight have an impact on their decision making and\nwhether the terms of their employment are satisfactory,\nwhether they might want to seek another job, they might\njust go into the office and say: We need more benefits.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me that\nit's a very tough argument to say -- to make a\nnondisclosure claim on the theory that the summary is\npart of the plan, because the whole point of a summary\nis not to disclose everything. If it disclosed\neverything, it wouldn't be a summary. And if you can\nclaim something because it didn't disclose it, it seems\nto me that's in tension with the idea that it's not\nsupposed to be just a repetition of the plan.\nMR. BRUCE: Our position is that the SPD is\none of the documents or instruments governing the plan.\nAnd by statute it's required to have certain -- to meet\ncertain requirements, and therefore it becomes a\ndocument governing the plan. It is -- in response to\nMr. Olson, it is referred to as a document in section\n1024(a)(6) of the statute, and of course this Court has\nrepeatedly referred to it as a plan document and to\n\"plan documents\" plural. So, what --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's -- I think\nthe brief -- the Petitioners' brief pointed out, it\ngoverns the plan only when it's more favorable to the\nparticipants, because you wouldn't say, if the plan were\nmore favorable and the summary would show fewer\nbenefits, that the summary would then govern.\nMR. BRUCE: I think the -- the\nfavorable/unfavorable is that the way -- the way I see\nit is that an unfavorable plan term, when you look at\nCurtiss-Wright, an unfavorable plan term must be validly\nadopted and it must be disclosed in accordance with\nERISA in order to be effective.\nAnd so, in the Frommert v. Conkright case,\nthat was specifically what the Second Circuit held, was\nthat the summary plan description did not disclose the\nphantom offset, and therefore the phantom offset was\nineffective. Here the summary plan description did not\ndisclose the wear-away provisions. People's normal\nexpectation is that if they are under a pension plan and\nthey are continuing to work, that they are continuing to\nearn pension benefits. So that the SPD was not\napprising them that there were unfavorable provisions in\nthe plan, which were validly adopted, but which were\nsecret as far as they were concerned.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So there's a -- there's a\npresumption that everything in the plan is favorable? I\nstill don't see how you get it both ways. If it -- if\nit understates the benefits, that doesn't count?\nMR. BRUCE: The -- the Congress in ERISA is\nconcerned with unfavorable effects on participants.\nIt's about protecting employee rights. So the focus is\non losses of benefits, and there is a specific provision\nin the regulations and in the statute about disclosing\nall the circumstances that can result in a loss of\nbenefits. So there was a plan provision here which\ncaused the loss of benefits that was never disclosed to\npeople. And it was -- there was no baseline where\npeople knew, well, the plan document may have a\nwear-away provision, and the SPD doesn't mention it and\ntherefore there is no wear-away.\nThey didn't know what wear-away was. They\ndon't know what wear-away is today, because it has never\nbeen disclosed to them that there's a way to -- to rig\nup a pension plan where you can have a period of years,\nunbeknownst to you, where you're not earning any an\nadditional benefits.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Are you finished\nwith that?\nMR. BRUCE: Yes. Sorry.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If you're finished. As I\nunderstand what you have been saying and written, you\ndon't mean that the SPD, the summary, is a contract? I\nmean, one thing would be to say it's a part of the plan\nand moreover it's a contract, so therefore we enforce it\naccording to terms. That's one view.\nBut if you took that view, you get into\nproblems such as were mentioned. The employer would\nwrite 10,000 pages because he knows it's an enforceable\ncontract. Nobody would understand it. You'd have to\nworry about the time when it was less favorable than the\nwritten document. So call it a plan if you want, as\nlong as you don't mean it's an enforceable contract.\nNow, there's a provision that deals with it,\nsaying just what you said in response to Justice Alito.\nAnd what I don't understand is why wouldn't that\nprovision govern? I take it there's a provision,\n1054(g)(1), that says a plan cannot reduce the rate of\naccrual of future benefits unless there's written notice\nin a manner calculated to be understood by the average\nplan participant.\nSo I would have thought, I read that, I get\nwhat you've said in your brief. The summary was\ninadequate. It wouldn't have been understood, and,\ntherefore, according to this particular provision, those\nprovisions in the plan that reduce benefits are void.\nSo now we enforce the plan with the -- in the absence of\nthose particular void provisions, and you get what you\nwant. Now, I thought that makes a lot of sense to me,\nexcept I don't see that anywhere in this case.\nMR. BRUCE: Now -\nJUSTICE BREYER: So there's some reason it\ndoesn't seem to appear in the opinions. It doesn't\nappear in the briefs. It doesn't appear anywhere until\nyou just mentioned it in response to Justice Alito, or\nseemed to.\nMR. BRUCE: No, it is in the opinion.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It is?\nMR. BRUCE: The district court found a\nviolation. It's 1024(h) -- it's 204(h) of ERISA, that\nthat provision -- the district court found a violation\nof that provision, which if the court had provided\nrelief would have resulted in the class receiving much\nmore relief than the court ultimately ordered; that it\nwould have resulted in the class receiving four or five\ntimes as much relief, because they would have just been\nput back under the old pension formula.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is that provision?\nJUSTICE BREYER: (h). He's right, it's (h).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does it appear anywhere in\n-- in the briefs? 1024(h), does it appear anywhere in\nthe briefs?\nMR. BRUCE: It appears in our petition for\ncertiorari, because after the district court found a\nviolation of it, the district court declined to provide\nrelief because there had been an intermediate interim\namendment that might have -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I understand that. So\nsuppose we can't reach that, which would seem to be the\nlogical thing to govern this, but we can't, okay? Then\nwe only have two choices. The first choice is (1)(b),\nwhich seems to -- you want to use that by treating the\nsummary as a contract, or we go to (3), in which case\nwe're under equity.\nNow, between those two, the first one gets\nall the problems that we just were talking about. The\nsecond one would seem to be you're free and clear as\nlong as you show some kind of reliance and harm, and\nthen we're back to what I thought we granted this for,\nwhich is why not say if harm is likely, then the burden\nshifts?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why not?\nMR. BRUCE: That's -- that's -- that's one\nway that it would be -- that was the way it's approached\nunder the Securities Act, where there is an express\nreliance requirement.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What happens in a trust law\nwhere, let's say, there are 10 or 50,000 beneficiaries\nin a trust, and -- and the trustee has indeed made an\nerror. And now they can recover money only if, only if\nthere really has been harm. Now, how do the -- how does\ntrust law work that out? This can't be the first time\nthis ever arose in history. We have a big class, and -\nMR. BRUCE: Well, I -- we didn't go based on\na trust law case involving a big class, but we based it\non Bogert and on section 173 in the Restatement of\nTrusts, that when there is a breach of the duty to\ndisclose all of the material information that the\nbeneficiary needs to know in interacting with a third\nparty, which in this case would be Cigna with respect to\ntheir employment, that then there is no requirement of\nproving reliance; that the trustee can prove -- as the\nSecond Circuit set up, that the trustee can try and\nprove that the beneficiaries have all the information\nthat they needed.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So you say under standard\ntrust law once you show there's a breach, the burden\nshifts to the trustee to show that there's no harm?\nMR. BRUCE: For a breach of the duties to\nthe -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, I understand that\nto be the Second Circuit rule, but I didn't understand\nthat to be the rule generally in the law of trusts, and\nI quarrel with the Government's brief on that. I think\nthe Government's brief is quite wrong to suggest that\nthis is part of the law of trusts.\nMR. BRUCE: Now, I -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, it could be the law\nof ERISA under the Second Circuit, but that's something\nquite different.\nMR. BRUCE: My understanding is -- I mean,\nthat's the law that's been -- that this Court has\nadopted in securities cases where we have nondisclosures\nto broad classes, is that there's a presumption of\nreliance, which -- because it's unrealistic for\nthousands of people to prove reliance in -- in -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's not under\ntrust -- trust law, or correct me if I'm wrong.\nMR. BRUCE: Well, that's -- that's what I'm\nsaying, that there's a commonality between the\nsecurities cases, trust law as stated in the -- in the\ncomment to section 173 and in Bogert, and what the\nSecond Circuit is doing.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could I just stop -\nthe securities cases, does that involve stock traded in\na market, in which case the inference of harm would be\nmuch more obvious and follow more logically than in the\ntrust context?\nMR. BRUCE: Well, one -- one of this Court's\nvery first ERISA cases was Teamsters v. Daniel, in which\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission had considered\npension plans to be a security. And -- and the case\nactually involved break-in-service rules, and this Court\nconcluded that whatever protections the securities laws\noffered, potentially offered, to participants were now\noffered in more concrete form under ERISA.\nBut the -- the point that I want to get back\nto on reliance is that my reading of this Court's\ndecision in Bridge and in Lyng v. Payne is that this\nCourt does not look for the closest analogy to a\nstatutory provision. The question is: What did\nCongress do in enacting this statutory provision?\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you this: If\nthis were an individual action and it -- and it were\nunder (a)(3), what would either the plaintiff or the\ndefendant have to show, depending on what the burden -\nwho has the burden, on the issue of likely harm?\nWhat would \"likely harm\" mean in that\ncontext? The person was likely to have left the\nemployment of the company, or what? What else?\nMR. BRUCE: \"Likely harm\" can include\nthat the -- that if the person knew about the provision,\nthey might have asked for the provision to be changed.\nThey might have asked for a different compensation\npackage. They might have asked -- they might have taken\npersonal kind of self-help steps to protect themselves\nso that they might have -- have, you know, decided to\nhave their wife work longer. They might have decided to\nwork longer themselves. They could have saved and saved\ndifferently.\nThere's both the -- the steps that you can\ntake in relation to your employment and the steps that\nyou can take on a personal basis.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Could they here have\ngone -- could they also have said to the company: Look,\nwhy are you doing this? If interest rates fall, we're\ngoing to lose money. But interest rates might rise, and\nif interest rates rise, you'll lose money. So we're\nrisk-averse, so what we would like to do is just make\nsure we get the same pension that we would under Plan A,\nand then if there's more on Plan B, add it in, and we'll\nrisk the fact that interest rates might have gone up.\nMR. BRUCE: The district court -\nJUSTICE BREYER: So they could -- they might\nhave talked the company into it.\nMR. BRUCE: Well, the district court found\nthat there was a real prospect of employee backlash if\nthe employees knew about these benefit reductions. It's\nwell-established in behavioral economics that people are\nvery averse to losses. So if a -- if the statute and\nthe regulations are requiring the loss to be disclosed,\nit isn't going out on a limb to say that there's going\nto be a reaction to that.\nAnd here, Cigna knew that there was a\nreaction to that, and they had examples from the press\nof with Deloitte & Touche had had a similar situation\nwhere they had to roll back the cash balance changes\nbecause employees were so upset.\nI think, in response to Justice Alito's\nquestion, the -- I don't think that the individual has\nto -- that if the individual has to prove possible\nprejudice, then I think that, as -- as our district\ncourt ruled here, then I think the standard inevitably\nbecomes very close to actual prejudice. And so I think\nthat the possible prejudice is really to the employee\ngroup. It's to the -- the statute is in terms of the\naverage plan participant. It's all based on objective\nstandards.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Under your proposal, I\nassume, if you prevail, under your position, the -- the\nsummaries will now become part of the plan. So that\neven if there's no intent to mislead, there can be a\nclass action if the -- if the SPD is in anyhow at\nvariance with the plan -\nMR. BRUCE: Well, as we -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- and to the -- to the\ndetriment of the employee.\nMR. BRUCE: Well, as we said in the brief,\nthere are already cases that -- that recognize\nexceptions to liability here, and one of them is for\nprompt correction of any problem. So if you have the\nunintentional error in that unintentionally the\nwear-away provisions weren't disclosed, well, then the\nissue is: Why wasn't that corrected at any point in\ntime? We're now 12 years out, and Cigna has never\ndisclosed those wear-aways to anyone.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If an administrator -- if an\nadministrator issues a summary plan description that is\n100 pages long and is basically the same thing as the\nwritten instrument, and that's a violation of the\nrequirement in ERISA that it be a summary and that it be\nintelligible to ordinary readers, what remedy is\navailable to a beneficiary?\nMR. BRUCE: I think -- I think that that's\n-- obviously, injunctive relief in terms of an order to\ncorrect that would be available. I think in terms of --\nof affecting the benefit offers, of saying, well, is\na -- if the SPD is identical to the plan document, is\nthere any -- there are no undisclosed plan provisions,\nthen. So it becomes -- it becomes more difficult in\nterms of relief, but obviously there would be relief for\nthe understandability requirement.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, doesn't that put\nthe -- think of the incentives for the administrator in\nthat situation or for the plan sponsor. If you issue a\nsuccinct SPD, you risk misleading the recipients as to\nthe contents of the plan, and you may have financial\nliability.\nIf, on the other hand, you issue -- you err\non the side of issuing an SPD that is comprehensive,\nwell, the worst that can happen, according to what you\njust said, is you can be faced with an injunction to\nprovide a more concise and comprehensible statement.\nMR. BRUCE: Well, intentional errors should\nnot be countenanced, and here Cigna was deliberately\nmisleading employees. If it's an unintentional error,\nthen it should be promptly corrected.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. BRUCE: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Kneedler.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING RESPONDENTS\nMR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe pension benefits an employee accrues\nwhile she works are a major component of her\ncompensation for working, just as her wages are. The\nemployee is entitled to receive those benefits and to\nrecover them if they are withheld without any\nparticularized showing of detrimental reliance, just as\nshe is entitled to recover the wages that were promised\nto her.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Kneedler, do you\nview this as essentially a contract case, as that just\nsuggested, or instead a trust case?\nMR. KNEEDLER: We view it as basically a\ncontract case. In Firestone, the Court referred to\ncontractually -- contractually guaranteed benefits,\nthose under the plan. And the reason we think that\nhere, in this case the district court found that the SPD\nbasically promised, represented to employees, that after\nthe conversion they would receive pension benefits in\nthe form of A plus B, the old benefits plus the new\nbenefits, accruing right away.\nERISA -- the scheme of ERISA is that the SPD\nis often -- typically the only document that the\nemployee receives to inform him or her about the\ncontents of the plan.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If this is a contract case,\nthen where does the \"likely harm\" standard come from?\nIf I'm owed something under a contract, I'm entitled to\nget that under the contract. I don't need to show that\nI was likely harmed by, that I relied in any -- in any\nway on anything.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right. We do not think\ndetrimental reliance -- and I think it works out -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you think likely harm is\nrequired?\nMR. KNEEDLER: In this sense: If the -- if\nthe SPD contains these sorts of representations such\nthat the employee could reasonably be expected to rely\nupon them in defining her benefits, then that controls.\nThe likely harm is not being told, or being told\nsomething different from what the underlying plan says.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the likely harm -\nMR. KNEEDLER: That could be rebutted -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's not the likely harm.\nThat's the breach. That's the offense.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying once you make\nthe offense, you have to cough up what you stated in the\n-- in the summary.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Unless the participant\nactually knew or couldn't reasonably depend upon it.\nActually knew -- for example, this was the case in the\nGovoni case in the First Circuit, that -- whose\nformulation is the one that other courts typically\nfollow. That was the situation where the employee found\nout before she retired what the true facts were, and,\ntherefore, there could have been no claim of harm or -\nor that the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then it's not\ncontract.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The minute you get away\nfrom contract -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is it contract or not\ncontract?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, it is contract,\nbecause -- because in that -- it -- it -- the question\nis: What is the contract? To the employee, typically\nthe SPD is the only thing that is the contract that -\nJUSTICE BREYER: But the SPD is written by\nthe fiduciary.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the other is written by\nthe -- by the person who is giving the money, the\nemployer. So now you're saying that it's a contract,\neven though it wasn't written by the employer and even\nthough it could differ in dozens of ways from the actual\n-- from the actual plan document. Sometimes they'd be\nfavorable to the employee, sometimes they'd be\nunfavorable, sometimes they'd be different but neutral.\nSo what's the judge supposed to do? Forget about the\nbasic document and just enforce this thing written by\nthe fiduciary?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, but the underlying\nformal document is -- is what controls, unless the SP -\nunless there's a conflict. This case -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I said that there can\nbe conflicts, sometimes favorable to the employee,\nsometimes unfavorable, sometimes neutral. So what we\nhave is a document that's, by the way, supposed to be\nshort, but I guess if we took your view it wouldn't be\nshort anymore. And -- and it -- it could differ in any\none of three ways; and I could think of seven other\nways.\nSo -- and we'll find seven others. So, what\n-- how is a judge supposed to react? Is he supposed to\nsay that this two-page document is the contract, is the\ncontract, and there are all kinds of conflicts -- what's\nsupposed to happen?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It forms -- it forms part of\nthe contract. And cases of conflicts between the SPD\nand the -- and the formal plan document are not common,\nand they shouldn't be, because the SPD -- the\nadministrator or the employer has an obligation to\nmake sure -\nJUSTICE BREYER: That isn't my question. My\nquestion is: One, why should a document written by a\ndifferent person, the fiduciary, govern over the actual\nplan? Second, what happens when you have a favorable\nconflict? What happens when you have an unfavorable\nconflict? What happens when you have a neutral\nconflict?\nMR. KNEEDLER: As to -\nJUSTICE BREYER: How should it be worked\nout?\nMR. KNEEDLER: As to the first point, it is\n-- it is common, and it was critically true here, that\nthe -- that the employer, the plan sponsor, is involved\nin -- in drafting the SPD. This was an SPD that was\nissued in conjunction with the plan amendment, and the\nSPD and the plan amendment -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I think the fact that this\nindividual in this case happened to be the same group or\nperson is beside the point of my question.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Okay. And -- and so the -\nthe second point is, I -- I think it would be useful for\nthe Court to look to the experience of certificates of\ninsurance under group insurance plans. That is the most\ndirectly analogous circumstance in our view. It is the\nprevailing position in the courts, and it has been for\nsome time, that where an employee -- or employee under a\ngroup health plan or pension plan receives a certificate\nof insurance that sets forth certain elements, essential\nelements of the plan, and the -- an underlying insurance\npolicy is in conflict with that, that the certificate of\ninsurance governs, for the same reason that the SPD\ngoverns -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is this governed by ERISA\nor are these things governed by ERISA?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Some of them may be and some\nof them may not be. I mean, it -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So where does the rule\ncome from, then?\nMR. KNEEDLER: The -- the rule is a common\ninsurance rule that in -- in the group insurance\nsituation, where you have an underlying policy that the\nindividual insured is not going to see.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But we have a statute here\nwhich says that it is the plan that governs. I mean,\nthat -- that's -- don't you think that's a crucial\ndifference?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, but there's -- it's\nalso a statute that, as this Court said in\nCurtiss-Wright, that the SPD is designed to -- to\nfurnish the employee the essential information under the\nplan.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that true of the\ncertificate of insurance? Is a certificate of insurance\na simple document that any consumer is able to\nunderstand or -- or is supposed to be?\nMR. KNEEDLER: That's what -- that is what\nit's supposed to be. And importantly in that -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there an example I could\nlook at? Find one, on line -\nMR. KNEEDLER: I'm not sure. There's not in\nthe record in this case, but -- but we cite some\ninsurance treatises. And a further point I want to\nmake, that -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do they use a likely harm\nstandard? Is that where the likely harm standard comes\nfrom?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, the likely harm standard\nwas a formulation of the -- of the Second Circuit. I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's nice. Where did\nthey get it from?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They just made it up?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- I think it was -\nit was an effort to judge whether the -- whether the\nparticular statements in the SPD were of the sort\nthat -- I think it really gets at materiality, whether\nthe statement's material.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Kneedler, I -- I think\nit's a hard question here as to whether to think of this\nas more like a contract dispute or more like a -- a\ntrust issue.\nIf we were to look at it as a trust issue,\nwhat would be the result of that? What kind of test\nwould we use?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think it would be -- I\nthink it would be the same thing where you -- where you\nhave a -- either in this case an affirmative\nrepresentation of what the -- of what benefits will be\ndue, or you could have a situation where there was a -\na failure to disclose.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if it's a contract\ncase as you're submitting, then the burden-shifting\nrules, it seems to me, that apply in trusts don't apply.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, the burden-shifting\nrule would apply to the extent of enabling the\nadministrator of the plan or the employer to demonstrate\nthat the employee actually knew or that there were other\ndocuments that would have informed the employee so that\nhe would not have been misled by the statements in the\n-- in the SPD.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, and in all of\nthat -\nMR. KNEEDLER: You have brochures -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- I think, under trust\nlaw, there has to be a showing of breach and harm before\nthere is -- the burden shifts on causation. And your\nbrief left out the -- you indicate the burden shifts\njust so long as you show that there is a misstatement.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, there is harm, because\nthe employee was not told of what the -- of what the\nterms of his -- of his deal were.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler -\nMR. KNEEDLER: He goes to work every day\nexpecting to earn his wages and expecting to earn the -\nthe benefits set forth in the SPD. And in -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you put -- do you put\nany weight on Congress insisting that the summary, that\neach -- each participant get a copy of that summary, but\nthere's no such requirement with respect to the plan?\nMR. KNEEDLER: That's -- that is critical to\nour position. And, again, the insurance/certificate of\ninsurance analogy, it's all the same reasons that we say\nunder ERISA, that that's the only document that is\ngiven, it's given for the obvious purpose of -- of\ntelling the employee the essential aspects of the deal\nthat he's going to get, and ERISA identifies, itemizes\nwhat they are and requires that the plan administrator\nnot -- not minimize what they are.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So it can't -- it can't\namend the plan, contrary to what we've said.\nMR. KNEEDLER: It's not -- it's not an\namendment to the plan.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not an amendment?\nMR. KNEEDLER: The SPD -- the SPD is part of\nthe plan, and as far as the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait -- wait. It's\npart of the plan, but the other part of the plan\ncontradicts this part of it. And -- and you say it is\nthis part, the SPD, that governs, which means it amends\nthe prior part, right?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It -- it controls. I -- it\ndoesn't formally -- it doesn't formally -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, all right, okay. We'll\nsay it controls. Does that make you feel better about\nit?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, that -- that's the\nexplanation -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Does it control when it's\nless favorable?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It does not. The -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh. It only controls when\nit's more favorable, but not when it's less favorable.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Because -\nJUSTICE BREYER: What theory of contract law\ngets you to that conclusion?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Because you have two\ndifferent documents that may be part of the contract.\nIt's an effort to find out what the deal is. Under the\ninsurance cases that I mentioned, what the courts\nsays -- what the courts say is the certificate becomes\npart of the contract, but those cases also say when\nthe -- when the plan is more favorable, that the plan\ngoverns because that -- under ERISA, that is the\noperative plan document that the administrator is\nsupposed to operate under day to day.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Kneedler.\nMr. Olson, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B.

OLSON: Well, (g), I'm talking about.\nThat's what they -- I refer you to page 212 of the cert\npetition appendix under Roman numeral VI, where the\ndistrict court specifically said: Plaintiffs also seek\nto assert their claim under ERISA's anti-cutback\nprovision, 204(g). That claim has been rejected in the\nliability decision. That claim was raised; it was\nrejected in the liability decision. It's not here\nanymore.\nSection -- the real section that the Court\nshould refer to in 204, is 204(h) -- (h)(6)(A) of ERISA,\nand I can't point to the portion of the appendix, but\nthat was an addition by Congress in 2001 to deal with\negregiously inaccurate notices of change. That -- and\nCongress amended ERISA in 2001, added that provision,\nand said, if there's an egregious violation of that\nprovision, then you get all the benefits that you should\nhave gotten.\nThat's what Congress can do if it wishes to\ndo. That's what's being sought in this case. Congress\ncan take care of this if it wishes, but Congress enacted\na carefully reticulated scheme; you're either suing for\nbenefits under the plan or you're suing for violations\nof ERISA.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why didn't that (h) apply\nhere? Was it not egregious enough? Is that -- is that\nwhy it didn't apply? Or they just forgot about it or\nwhat?\nMR. OLSON: I -- I don't think that the -\nthe notice that was involved was referring to the SPD.\nThe SPD, to the extent that it violates ERISA, there is\na remedy that still exists; Congress hasn't changed.\nIt's in (a)(3). It must be an equitable remedy. You\ncan seek an injunction.\nAnd to the extent the Court is concerned\nthat that's an empty remedy, that that's not a\nsufficient remedy, that's what Congress decided; and we\nreferred in footnote 3 of our reply brief of a number of\ncases that -- that circuit courts have handled\ndemonstrating detrimental reliance and providing for\nremedies.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but I still have the\nsame question Justice Scalia had, which is -- which is\nwhy didn't this (h) thing apply here, because they\ndidn't have -- their claim, the notice wasn't good, and\nif the notice wasn't good, then -- the plan didn't\nchange, and if the plan didn't change, they should have\ngotten the money. Why didn't it -- why?\nMR. OLSON: That provision doesn't apply to\nthe SPD, and they did not bring that case. I don't\nknow -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why doesn't it apply to the\nSPD? Isn't that a notice?\nMR. OLSON: I think it's a different type of\nnotice that -- under that provision.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought it says -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, there was a -- there\nwas notice, wasn't there?\nMR. OLSON: There was a notice.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And is the claim based on\nthat, or is it based on the SPD?\nMR. OLSON: The claim is based upon the SPD,\nand the district court decided that the SPD had amended\nthe plan. And that's inconsistent with what the statute\nprovides.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Olson, on your view of\nshowing detrimental reliance, I take it you would\nrequire each employee to come forward and say yes, I\nread this SPD; is that correct?\nMR. OLSON: Yes. And trust law -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And doesn't that really\nmisunderstand the realities of the workplace? Very few\npeople read their SPDs, but you only need one person to\nread the SPD to come in and say, by the way, folks,\n21,000 of us are not getting our retirement benefits for\nthe next few years. And within a day, every employee in\nthe workplace is going to know about that. So doesn't\nthis give an incredible windfall to your client, Cigna,\nor to other companies that commit this kind of\nintentional misconduct if you hold them to this\ndetrimental reliance standard?\nMR. OLSON: The -- I refer to what\nJustice Kennedy was referring to. To the extent that\nwe're talking about trust law, we're talking about the\nrequirement of a loss. I would say that a person would\nnot necessarily have to have read the SPD but have been\naware of it and taken some steps in connection with it.\nAnd that's the evidence that would have to be\nestablished, and there's no -- and every court has said\nthat under (a)(3) equity requires detrimental reliance.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Olson.\n"
