        "content": "(10:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument now\nin number 01-714, Utah vs. Donald L. Evans, Secretary of\nCommerce. Mr. Lee.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS R. LEE, ESQ.\nON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS\nMR. LEE: Mr. Chief Justice and may it please\nthe Court: for most of the history of the census of the\nAmerican population, that census has been conducted by\nmeans of an actual count unaltered by any methods of\nstatistical estimation. At the time of the first census\nof 1790, James Madison noted that this was the way\nrequired by the Constitution and ever since then, that\nrequirement has been implemented by Congress in the Census\nAct. The question presented in this case is whether the\nCensus Bureau acted unlawfully in departing from that\nlongstanding historical tradition by using the method of\nestimation called hot-deck imputation in the 2000\napportionment count. 99.6 percent of the 2000\napportionment count was comprised of actual data compiled\nby census enumerators in two phases. First, a mailing\nsent to all addresses on a master address file, and\nsecond, as many as six follow-up visits.\nImputation added an additional .4 percent to that\ncount, 1.2 million statistically generated persons were\nadded to the apportionment count by means of a statistical\nestimate. The basic essence of the estimate was to say\nthe 620,000 addresses that the Census Bureau was unable to\nenumerate are assumed to have estimated to have the same\nnumber of occupants as their next door neighbors.\nQUESTION: Mr. Lee, I would like to ask you to\naddress early on whether this injury that Utah alleges to\nhave suffered is redressable in any fashion. Things have\nhappened since the census was taken. North Carolina\npresumably has drawn districts and has gone quite far down\nthe road in reliance on the census. The President has\nturned over the numbers and so forth. How can this be\nredressed, do you think, now?\nMR. LEE: I suppose, Justice O'Connor, that\nthere are two aspects of your question if I'm\nunderstanding it. One of them would be a redressability\nstanding question. That's a question as the Solicitor\nGeneral notes that has already been decided by this Court\nboth in Franklin and in Montana with regard to --\nQUESTION: Well, there is jurisdiction,\nbut I don't know that we have really addressed the\nredressability issue fully in prior cases. When could\nUtah have made its challenge? When is the earliest time\nUtah could have challenged this imputation business?\nMR. LEE: It would have been impossible, Justice\nO'Connor, for Utah to have brought a challenge prior to\nthe census. As North Carolina indicated --\nQUESTION: Well, why is that? I mean, you knew,\ndid you, that the Census Bureau planned to use it?\nMR. LEE: Yes. We certainly had constructive\nknowledge.\nQUESTION: But you wouldn't have had an injury.\nMR. LEE: We wouldn't have had an injury, and in\nfact as the Census Bureau itself indicates, there would\nhave been no way even to have anticipated that imputation\nwould have had this effect.\nQUESTION: Well, you have no incentive to bring\na challenge until you know that you are losing a\ncongressional seat, I suppose.\nMR. LEE: That's exactly right. And that was\none of the problems. It took us some time to get\nthe numbers from the Census Bureau, specific state by\nstate numbers, in order to be able to determine whether in\nfact this was a method that impacted Utah, and as soon as\nwe got those numbers, we brought this suit within a few\ndays.\nQUESTION: Well, was there a window of time\nbetween completion of the census and the submission of the\nnumbers to the President where you could have sued? How\nlong was that period of time?\nMR. LEE: That was, the time line is that the\nSecretary must submit the numbers by the end of the\ncalendar year to the President, and then the President\nmust submit those numbers within seven days after the\nfirst day of the Congress. The problem, Justice Kennedy,\nwas that we didn't have those numbers at that time. The\nCensus Bureau had not released again state by state\nimputation numbers until well into March of 2001, and it\nwas within a few days after that that we brought this\nsuit.\nQUESTION: Well, if you prevail, what's supposed\nto happen?\nMR. LEE: The remedy that we are asking for,\nJustice Kennedy, is simply a declaration and an injunction\nto the Secretary of Commerce directing the Secretary to\nissue a new apportionment count free of\nthe statistical estimates that we believe are unlawful\nunder the Census Act and under the Census Clause of the\nConstitution.\nQUESTION: Well, what's supposed to happen under\nthe Act? I mean, I went back and read the Act last night.\nAnd that's geared to certain automatic apportionment, and\nthat in turn is geared to the delivery of the numbers by\nthe date specified. So let's assume the Secretary and\nthen the President comes with different numbers. The Act\ndoesn't have any provision in effect for self-adjustment,\ndoes it?\nMR. LEE: And I think, Justice Souter, that's\neffectively North Carolina's argument. That there are\ntime deadlines set forth in the Census Act that somehow\nstand in the way of reviewability here. That is an\nargument that was raised and rejected in Franklin. The\nFranklin opinions, Justice O'Connor's opinion for a four\njustice plurality on that point, says that if this Court\nagrees with the Plaintiffs in this case, we may presume\nthat the President of the United States will conform to\nour decision and will in fact issue a new apportionment\ncount that is consistent with the law as we clarify it.\nBy the same token --\nQUESTION: I will presume that, too, but\nthat was four justices, and there wasn't a specific\ndiscussion of what is supposed to happen under the\nstatute, even assuming the President sort of takes counsel\nfrom our opinion.\nMR. LEE: And the other opinion in that case,\nJustice Souter, that also addresses this issue was Justice\nStevens' concurring opinion, for a separate four-justice\nconcurrence on this issue, and his analysis was in fact\nthat the statute would require the President to conform to\na revised count that the Secretary might present in\nconformity to a decision of this Court.\nQUESTION: Well, that's what he said and as you\nknow, I joined his opinion. But that didn't have a\nmajority, either. So isn't it incumbent upon you to tell\nus whether in fact the position that some of us took that\nfirst time is in fact correct? Why will they, I mean, it\nseemed so to me at the time but it's a real issue in this\ncase, as to whether the statute which is geared to\ndelivery of information at certain times can in effect\nreverse itself.\nMR. LEE: The other point that Justice Stevens\nmade in his concurring opinion, Justice Souter, which I\nthink is critical on this issue, is that the time lines\nunder the statute can be\nunderstood only to trigger, only with regard to the issue\nof ripeness. In other words, it makes no sense to think\nthat a time deadline for executive action under a statute\nmeans that you, you must -- it makes no sense to think\nthat those deadlines are a bar to judicial review. In\nfact, what we usually think of when we look at a statute\nthat has deadlines is that once those deadlines have\npassed, then executive action is at an end, there is a\nripe claim that may be brought and then it's appropriate\nfor the federal courts to step in.\nQUESTION: But those are not cases where after,\nafter the deadline provisions, you have a, a basic change\nin, in the court's role, that after the deadline in this\ncase, you are going to have to, the court is going to have\nto issue an opinion that purports to bind the President.\nWhich is, you know, a significant step.\nMR. LEE: Yes. I think that the opinion does\nnot need to purport to bind the President, and as the\nCourt indicated in Franklin, there is no need for the\norder to go to that point.\nQUESTION: Well, but I mean that's, that's even\nworse. You want us to decide something on the ground that\nsome good may come out of it. But I just\ndon't know what your closest case is for the proposition\nthat this satisfies the redressability requirement.\nLet's assume that the President, were interested\nin implementing our orders. We send something to\nCongress, and maybe that's the end of it there. Can we\nforce the Congress to act?\nMR. LEE: Well, the, the order would go to the\nSecretary. The Secretary would submit a new apportionment\ncount to the President that would be free of the\nestimations and the question then is what would the\nPresident do. And the President under two alternative,\nbut not necessarily inconsistent theories, of eight\njustices in the Franklin case would certainly conform and\nwould present those same numbers, that same revised\napportionment count.\nQUESTION: Mr. Lee --\nQUESTION: Let me just -- what's your closest\ncase to show that a declaration of this kind satisfies the\nrequirement of redressability?\nMR. LEE: Well, I believe it's Franklin, Justice\nKennedy.\nQUESTION: Excuse me. Other than Franklin.\nBecause Franklin was a fractured opinion.\nMR. LEE: Well, one understanding\nconsistent with Justice O'Connor's opinion in Franklin\nwould be that of a declaratory judgment. It does not in\nand of itself bind the parties. It rather declares the\nlaw. It is not a, it is not a, a binding order in the\nsense of ordering parties to do anything.\nQUESTION: Well, it does bind the parties in a\ncertain extent. It's just, there is no action required as\na result of it. There is no mandate saying you must do\nthis.\nMR. LEE: That's right, Mr. Chief Justice, and I\nthink that that's consistent again with Justice O'Connor's\nplurality opinion in Franklin.\nQUESTION: We have never held that a declaratory\njudgment will issue where the Court has no power to compel\nthe action that the declaratory judgment describes. I\nmean, you cannot get jurisdiction by saying well, you\nknow, we have no power to, over this person to compel any\naction, but we are just going to declare what the law is\nbecause this person, you know, might follow it. I don't\nthink that's a basis for jurisdiction.\nMR. LEE: Well, Justice Scalia, but I think\nthere are two alternative theories. One is Justice\nO'Connor's approach and the other is Justice\nStevens' approach in Franklin, and Justice Stevens'\napproach in Franklin in fact, is in fact that the\nPresident is required to conform with revised numbers.\nBut the Secretary might represent --\nQUESTION: But you are actually taking a\nposition also that whether or not the President would\nrespond, at least the Secretary would have a duty to do\nsomething in response to our order.\nMR. LEE: That's exactly right.\nQUESTION: Is it quite common that in suits the\nPresident is not named, and the Secretary is. But I\nwanted to go back to a question -- the President has\nacted, but Congress has not. Am I correct? Congress is\nwaiting on what this court does?\nMR. LEE: The final step, Justice Ginsburg, in\nthis process, is for the clerk of the House of\nRepresentatives to forward to the states a certificate\nthat shows how many seats in the House of Representatives\nthey are entitled to after clerk receives the revised\nnumbers from the President. And this Court in Franklin\nindicated clearly that that duty is a ministerial duty and\nthat we can absolutely expect that the clerk of the House\nwill follow suit. So the only question is with regard to\nthe President,\nand either under Justice O'Connor's approach or under\nJustice Stevens' approach in the Franklin opinions, we can\nand should expect that the President will in fact conform\nto this Court's order.\nQUESTION: You only have a certain amount of\ntime, Mr. Lee. I want to ask you a question about the\nmerits of the case. Are you saying in effect that there\nhas to be a specific, something more than just a little\nbit of educated guesswork with respect to every house in\nthe country?\nMR. LEE: Well, the actual enumeration clause of\nthe Constitution would require an actual count, and --\nQUESTION: Okay. But what, supposing that the\ncensus people have, they see a house, and they see a car\nin the driveway, but they can never find anybody home, and\nthen someone sees lights on late at night. They do their\nbest. Do they have to say nobody lives there?\nMR. LEE: Yes, they do, Mr. Chief Justice, and\none of the reasons is that the mere fact that there are\nlights on and cars there doesn't tell us that this is\nanyone's usual place of residence. It may be a seasonal\nvacation home.\nQUESTION: It doesn't confirm it, but\nisn't it a permissible inference for the census takers?\nMR. LEE: Well, at some point a census taker may\nmake a conclusion, if it's based on information specific\nto an individual household, may make a conclusion that a\nhousehold is in fact occupied. Our position is that what\nthe Census Act requires, Section 195, is -- what the\nCensus Act prohibits, rather, is the use of information\nspecific not to that individual household but specific to\nan entirely different household for the purpose of drawing\nan inference.\nQUESTION: Okay. Would you, on that theory,\nwould you agree that although they may not impute a number\nbeyond one, it would be fair for them at least to count it\nas one? Because they start out as I understand it with a,\nin effect a report from the post office saying, you know,\nthis is a house at which somebody lives. So isn't that\nkind of hearsay just as good as, let's say, the next door\nneighbor's hearsay at least to the extent of saying\nsomebody lives there and they can count one person?\nMR. LEE: Justice Souter, they don't start out\nwith the proposition that this is a house and somebody\nlives there. They start out with the\nproposition that this is an address.\nQUESTION: Well, doesn't an address usually mean\nsomebody lives there, at least if we can establish that\nit's a residential neighborhood?\nMR. LEE: Not necessarily, for a number of\nreasons. Number one, you have got the seasonal home\nproblem. It may be no one's personal, no one's usual\nplace of residence.\nNumber two, you have got the problem that some\nthings that look like homes and that are in residential\nareas actually turn out to be businesses.\nQUESTION: What percentage of homes in the\nUnited States when they take the census turn out to be\nvacation or second homes?\nMR. LEE: I don't have that number handy off the\ntop of my head, Justice O'Connor. I believe that it is in\nthe record, but I'm not aware of that. The total number\nof imputations was with regard to 620,000 unrelated --\nQUESTION: But the imputation techniques\napparently treat all the dwellings that are identified as\nresidences to be counted? They don't discount for a\npercentage that are vacation homes?\nMR. LEE: No. They do not. And that's part of\nthe problem. Part of the problem here is\nthat imputation assigns occupancy not only to units,\nJustice Souter, that are known to be houses.\nQUESTION: That's saying that they are doing it\nbad. We have to assume they are doing it good. I mean,\nsuppose they have learned with experience that an old age\nhome that has two bedrooms in each apartment and that has\na sign out in front that says \"full,\" has two people. One\nin each bedroom. And now they learn something about this\nhouse. It's an old age home. It has two bedrooms. And\nthe sign in front says full.\nNow, can they make the assumption that this too\nhas two people in it?\nMR. LEE: I think not.\nQUESTION: Not. Now, why not? Can they make an\nassumption that if the pizza man delivers pizza to the\nplace and people eat the pizza, i.e., at least it\ndisappears, that there is someone in the house? Can they\nmake that assumption?\nMR. LEE: They cannot, Justice Breyer.\nQUESTION: They cannot make the assumption about\nthe pizza man. They deliver it to the door and the food\ndisappears and the lights are on and off. They can't make\nthat assumption?\nMR. LEE: No. People in businesses eat\npizza and people who are living, staying temporarily in a\nvacation home eat pizza.\nQUESTION: And by the way, there is a sign in\nfront that says this is not a vacation home.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. LEE: Then I suppose -- I suppose under\nthose circumstances, then we'd have information. But --\nQUESTION: Fine. Once you are down, once you\nare down that road, then you are then -- then I can easily\nconstruct examples where the imputation is absolutely as\nstrong. I mean, I just did that with my old age home. So\nyou are not against imputations, you are against weak\nimputations.\nMR. LEE: No. I'm against sampling because\nthat's what the statute prohibits.\nQUESTION: You have to take that position.\nMR. LEE: I think it's important, though, to\nanswer your question, Justice Breyer, to go back to the\nbaseline of the House of Representatives decision. It\nholds that a method proposed by the Census Bureau in 1997\nis a method of sampling. We know that much, and so there\nis really a narrow statutory question presented here and\nit is, is this particular method meaningfully different?\nAnd the\nanswer is that it is not.\nIt is not under the statistical understanding of\nthe term sampling. It also is not because the definition\nthat the appellees are proposing here is a definition that\nwould nullify this Court's decision in the House of\nRepresentatives because the two methods simply are not\ndistinguishable. Let me talk about the appelees'\ndefinitions and explain why that's true.\nThe definitions that they propose say that\nsampling is limited to methods that are employed as a last\nresort, only after an initial effort to enumerate the\nwhole population. Under that definition, in fact, both,\nneither one of the methods that's at issue here would\nfollow sampling, and so that effectively is an argument\nthat the Court got it wrong in House of Representatives\nand that that case ought to effectively be nullified. And\nhere's why.\nQUESTION: Are you suggesting, Mr. Lee, that the\nCensus Bureau goes about this thing in a way, say,\nsupposing you have a lake in northern Wisconsin where the\ntemperatures get down to about 40 below in the winter. So\nyou know it's not a year-round, you see a bunch of houses\naround the lake. The census people come along and do you\nthink\nif they could find somebody there, they would just\nautomatically say yes, that person counts? Without\ninquiring as to whether it's a vacation home or not?\nMR. LEE: Well, if they know that there is\nsomebody who is living there, they have to find out\nwhether the somebody who is living there lives there as\nhis usual place of residence, or that person doesn't count\nin the apportionment count. But what's going on --\nQUESTION: But under the imputation method as I\nunderstand it, the assumption is made that if a house is\nthere, that it is a residence, and a second assumption is\nmade that the number of occupants will be that in a\ngeneral geographic area of other homes. Is that right?\nMR. LEE: That's right. And that's exactly the\nsense in which this particular method of imputation is a\nmethod of sampling. The Census Bureau took a sample of\n620,000 addresses. They called them donor housing units\nin the 2000 census. It used that sample of 620,000\naddresses or housing units as a representative sample of\nthe 620,000 addresses that they never were able to count\non the theory that they were representative, knowing that\nnext door neighbors are not always the same, but that\ngenerally across the board, if you take the 620,000 sample\nor donor units and use them to estimate the 620,000\naddresses about which we know nothing, generally across\nthe board it will average out and it will be\nrepresentative. And that's sampling. Sampling is taking\ninformation about the parts to make an inference about the\nwhole.\nQUESTION: I'm curious both in your argument\nhere this morning and in the brief, I think both parties\nseem to assume that the key question is whether or not\nthis is sampling. Do you take the position that other\nstatistical methods of adjustment are permitted just so\nlong as they are not called sampling?\nMR. LEE: Our position is, Justice Kennedy, that\nany method that takes information from a part of the\npopulation to make an inference about the whole is a\nmethod of sampling and is prohibited. Now, there are\nmethods, statistical methods that the Bureau uses that\ndon't amount to sampling that are permitted. Let me give\nyou one example.\nQUESTION: Go ahead.\nMR. LEE: It's called the method of quality\nassurance, and the quality assurance phase, what the\nBureau does is to randomly send out\nenumerators to given census tracts to try to find the\ntracts where there are a large number of errors, where the\nenumerators may have made a lot of mistakes.\nBut the response to that is to send out an\nadditional army of enumerators to those problematic tracts\nto sort out the problem to get the new information. Now,\nthat's an actual count. That's not sampling but it's a\nstatistical method. And so that's an example.\nQUESTION: What about a house where they have\nnot been able to find anybody to talk to, no returns sent\nback, so they go to the people next door and they say is\nthere anybody living in that house and the person next\ndoor says yes, there are two people. Now, is that\npermissible under your theory?\nMR. LEE: That is permissible under our theory.\nThat's the use of proxy data that the Bureau currently\nengages in and Mr. Chief Justice, that would be\npermissible.\nQUESTION: But the Act refers both to sampling\nand to other methods of statistical adjustment. It seems\nto me sampling is a way to gather the data, and what we\nare talking about here are statistical assumptions made to\nevaluate the\ndata, and I'm not sure why you have to concede that you\nlose if we say this isn't sampling.\nMR. LEE: Well, there may be another way to get\nthere, Justice Kennedy, but my understanding under the\nstatute is that Section 195 prohibits the statistical\nmethod known as sampling. That may suggest that there are\nother statistical methods that are not, that don't amount\nto sampling, and the quality assurance example that I gave\nI think is one of those examples that would be permitted\nunder the statute.\nBut all methods that take information from a\npart, from these 620,000 addresses that are occupied, to\nmake an inference about the rest of the population, the\n620,000 addresses that we don't know anything about, those\nare methods of sampling and again you really cannot\ndistinguish this method in any meaningful way from the\nmethod that was struck down in 1997. The principal\ndifference is that instead of 620,000 addresses about\nwhich we know nothing, under the 1997 plan, the Bureau\nanticipated that there may be many more.\nQUESTION: Yes. But there is one significant\ndifference and that is in the technique that was struck\ndown before, a number of inferences\nare being drawn from the so-called sample. In this case,\nonly one inference is being drawn from a sample of one,\nand that is at least a tremendous difference in degree,\nand I suppose it's a difference in degree that would be\nlikely to have an effect on accuracy.\nMR. LEE: In fact, Justice Souter, that is not a\ndistinction. The fact that there is an imputation being\nmade one individual housing unit at a time, again, does\nnot distinguish this method from the method struck down in\nthe House of Representatives case.\nQUESTION: Well, it wouldn't in a literal sense\nif you were simply making one imputation at a time, but\nyou were making a long series of imputations from the one\nsample, in this case, the one house. But this is simply\none imputation made one time, and it involves not so much\na, a principle of selection, or let's put it this way.\nYou can characterize it not only as based on a principle\nof selection, but you can, you can characterize it on, on\na rule of probability, like birds of a feather flock\ntogether. People who live next door tend to be much\nalike.\nSo it seems to me that there is a qualitative\ndifference and a quantitative difference.\nMR. LEE: But Justice Souter, once you pool all of\nthe individual housing units together, the 627 -- 620,000,\nrather, of these housing units that were used to estimate\nthe 620,000 addresses that we know nothing about after six\nfollow-up visits, that's your sample. That's your group.\nQUESTION: No. Your sample isn't 620 to tell\nyou about just any random 620. It's, it's a selection of\none to tell you about one more which is right next to it.\nSo it seems to me that it sort of masks the issue to talk\nabout 620 and 620 as opposed to one and one.\nMR. LEE: Mathematically it seems to me, though,\nJustice Souter, we get to the same end. This is an\nintermediate step, even though it happens on a household\nby household basis. It's an intermediate step for the\nclear purpose of making an ultimate inference about the\npopulation as a whole. If, for example, there are three\n--\nQUESTION: Yes, but that, I mean that would be\ntrue about any inferential conclusion. I mean, strictly\nit would be true I suppose even if accepting the hearsay\nconclusion is true. And there is an awful lot of\ninference that does not fall within anyone's notion of\nwhat is a sample or what is\nin a technical sense a statistical method.\nMR. LEE: It is also true, however, Justice\nSouter, of the method struck down by this Court in the\nHouse of Representatives case. And I probably didn't make\nthis clear enough the first time I mentioned it so let me\njust make it one more quick time.\nUnder the 1997 plan, it's clear that the Census\nBureau proposed to estimate the roughly 10 percent of the\npopulation that it was not going to enumerate one\nindividual housing unit at a time. As is indicated in the\nadministrative record in this case at page 1647, it was\nprecisely the nearest neighbor assumption that the Bureau\nhad in mind under the 1997 plan. So that truly is not a\ndistinction between this particular method and the method\nat issue in the House of Representatives case, and thus\nthe argument that's being proposed here really is an\nargument that would effect an end run around the House of\nRepresentatives decision.\nQUESTION: Mr. Lee, as I understand it, the\nimputation method that was actually used after the 2000\ncensus has the effect of counting non-households as\nhouseholds in some instances?\nMR. LEE: That's correct, Justice\nO'Connor.\nQUESTION: And it counts one household several\ntimes in some instances.\nMR. LEE: That's correct, because some of these\nare different --\nQUESTION: And, all right. And the imputation\nis not based on the nearest neighbor. I mean, there is a\nbig block of homes, and the assumption about who lives on\nit is not based on a nearest neighbor.\nMR. LEE: Ordinarily, as I understand it, it is\nthe nearest neighbor address that's used to estimate or\nimpute the address about which we know nothing.\nQUESTION: That's not my understanding, but we\ncan explore that with the other side. But I was concerned\nbecause it seems to be a method that does amount to what\nwe said couldn't be done, in House of Representatives, on\na much smaller scale.\nMR. LEE: That's exactly right and of course the\nscale of the practice is beside the point.\nQUESTION: Well, they say it isn't beside the\npoint. I take it that their argument is basically in\nHouse of Representatives, what the census was trying to do\nwas to use a special kind of\ninferential method to determine the population of an\nentire area.\nWell, here they are using an inferential method\nto determine the population of an individual house. Now,\nif you don't make that distinction, and you say that\ndistinction is irrelevant, we are left with your\ndistinction which seems as Justice Souter just pointed out\nto be the same as all inference. In other words, I infer\nthat when you deliver pizza and it disappears, someone is\nin the house, because of the set of similar to pizza type\ncases that I have seen in the past. Or, you know, that's\nI think what Justice Souter was bringing out, they have a\ndifferent distinction. Now how do I deal with the\nproblem?\nMR. LEE: Well, Justice Breyer, let me mention\ntwo reasons why that distinction doesn't get them\nanywhere. It doesn't get them anywhere number one because\nit simply isn't borne out in the statistical understanding\nof methods of sampling, in two senses.\nNumber one, the statistical understanding of\nsampling says generally, what statisticians understand to\nbe encompassed within the general category of sampling is\ntaking information from a\npart to make a statistical definition.\nQUESTION: You have the statistical definition,\nbut my question was directed at a particular problem that,\nif I take your approach I can't get myself out of. That\nis, that your definition applies to all inference. Their\ndefinition distinguishes among kinds of inference and they\nhave their statistical support.\nMR. LEE: The problem with the distinction is,\nanother problem with the distinction is that it's clear\nthat it would permit the Census Bureau to replicate the\n1997 plan. If you buy that distinction, the Bureau can\nget back exactly to where it wanted to go in 1997 merely\nby scaling back its nonresponse follow-up efforts.\nQUESTION: I don't understand the pizza man.\nDoes the pizza man, does that inference consist of\nimputing something from the part to the whole? I mean, I\nwould think that's your answer to the pizza man example.\nIt is an inference.\nQUESTION: No, no. It goes from the whole to\nthe parts.\nQUESTION: But it's not the same kind of\ninference that is done by what you say is sampling,\nmainly, imputing information that belongs to a part\nto the whole. That's not what's going on in the pizza man\ncase.\nMR. LEE: Maybe, Justice Scalia and Justice\nBreyer, maybe I missed the pizza man example, but that may\nwell, that may well be a distinction.\nQUESTION: I didn't think the imputation\ninvolved any actual things like looking at, when pizza was\ndelivered. It involves looking at what houses returned,\ntake a big block in the district they are serving. It\ninvolves looking at the houses that returned the form,\nlooking at the houses where they reach people in a\nfollow-up visit, and there are some they may might still\nbe missing and so they impute the map.\nThey don't go see if there is a car in the\ngarage or look at the pizza delivery. They arbitrarily\nsay we are going to impute from the data we have that\nthere are X number of additional houses and that X number\nof houses are occupied at a certain level of occupancy.\nThat's what's going on.\nMR. LEE: That's exactly right. That's\nprecisely right, Justice O'Connor. The pizza man knows\nhow many people live there. He is a proxy and he can give\nthat information to a census enumerator. But the end run\nproblem is illustrated by this\ndistinction; if the Census Bureau can use any methods that\nfall within the definition that's now being proposed, the\nBureau can simply scale back slightly its nonresponse\nfollow-up effort and estimate increasing percentages of\nthe population, up to and even exceeding the 10 percent\nthat was proposed in 1997.\nQUESTION: Mr. Lee, didn't it prove out that,\nafter, that in the majority of these cases, something like\n75 percent, that they know for sure that these were houses\nwhere people lived?\nMR. LEE: Actually not, Justice Ginsburg. The\n75 percent figure is misleading and completely unhelpful.\nAt page 445 of the joint appendix the memorandum that's at\nissue there simply says that in 75 percent of the status\nimputed cases, status imputation was done with regard to\nenumerator returns or respondent returns. In other words,\nthese were not mail-back returns.\nQUESTION: But you don't have a negative\nshowing, either, that it wasn't accurate? And there was\nsomething Justice O'Connor said, and I'm not sure whether\nI fully understand it. I thought that this imputation was\nmade for people who didn't respond to the mailing, that\nthe like comparison was with the\ngroup of people that were eventually counted, but that\nthey were nonrespondents the first time around.\nMR. LEE: That's right. I think if understand\nyour question, Justice Ginsburg, I think that's right.\nThey took information from initial nonresponding\nhouseholds, used those as a sample of those who never\nresponded, and some of those may well not have been homes,\nJustice O'Connor, some of those may well have been\nduplicates, etc. If there are no further questions, Mr.\nChief Justice, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my\ntime for rebuttal.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Lee. Mr. Dellinger,\nwe'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER E. DELLINGER\nON BEHALF OF THE NORTH CAROLINA APPELLEES.\nMR. DELLINGER: May it please the Court, because\nNorth Carolina believes very strongly that the right time\nto challenge the Census Bureau's planned use of a\nstatistical method is before rather than after the census\nis completed, let me begin by --\nQUESTION: Well, how could the challenge have\nbeen brought before Utah knew that the imputation figures\ncaused this problem?\nMR. DELLINGER: Under your decision in\nHouse of Representatives, I think on page 332, you note\nthat citizens of Utah, you didn't specify the state, but\ncitizens who anticipate that the use of a method like\nimputation, as suburbanites might, would dilute their in\nintrastate districting representation, are specifically\nsaid in House of Representatives to have authority to\nbring that suit. So I think that there would have been\nparties able to litigate it. In response --\nQUESTION: Well, you can't bring a suit before\nyou know about what's going on.\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes, you can, Mr. Chief Justice.\nIt is true, as you noted, that there might not be a\nspecial incentive on Utah's part, but they don't know they\nare going to be the loser. They might have come out\nbetter or worse with or without imputation. But every\ngovernor, attorney general, states and cities are\ncarefully watching this. Many as you know sued in 1997.\nSo the suit could have been brought that, by any resident\nof a suburb could have had an expert allege that they are\ngoing to be diluted if you impute households because it's\nrural areas where the files are often damaged or --\nQUESTION: But Mr. Dellinger, a state can't, you\nsuggest there are suburban people, city\npeople, a state can't, until it knows what the result is\ngoing to be, and Congress used the words any aggrieved\nperson. The state, you are saying is the state can never\nbring such a suit, because it is not aggrieved before. It\ncan't predict that it's going to be aggrieved. It will\nknow only when the returns are in, so in effect, you are\nsaying this is not a question that the state has come too\nlate. It's not sooner or later, it's a never question for\nthe state. You're saying Congress simply did not authorize\nthe states to bring this kind of case.\nMR. DELLINGER: Justice Ginsburg, that is\ncorrect, if a state is unable to show, does not have the\nexperts about a forthcoming census that is unable to\ndemonstrate that it will be aggrieved. How much we should\nworry about a nonaggrieved party not being able to obtain\njudicial review is --\nQUESTION: They are aggrieved at the end of the\nline.\nMR. DELLINGER: They are now, but my point is\nthat if Utah had been watching this carefully, and as you\nknow, many states were involved in the '97 litigation as\namici and otherwise. Surely the Governor could have found\nmany citizens of the State of Utah who, and this suit\nitself includes individual\nvoters, some of whom may very well, the plaintiffs --\nQUESTION: The governor had no incentive to do\nso.\nMR. DELLINGER: I understand that.\nQUESTION: He could have gotten a stalking horse\nto, some suburbanite to bring the suit but he had no\nnotion that there was any reason to do that.\nMR. DELLINGER: It seems to me that that is\nexactly correct, but that it's exactly why any governor,\nmajor city mayor or others, these citizens, those who\nbrought suit in 1997 and did not include this,\nsuburbanites are going to hurt, would want to sue, could\nbring the suit, but in any event, they could also\nparticipate in the Bureau's process. Utah never made this\nobjection.\nNow, here's why that's so unfair. It's simply\nthis. The, it is, we don't know who would have gained\nthis seat if Utah had bought its objections to the Census\nBureau before the census was conducted.\nQUESTION: Is there a statutory time period for\npeople to challenge the Census Bureau proposed techniques\nbefore the census is taken? Is there some provision\nwhereby that challenge can be made?\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes. The public law which was the\nbasis for the suit in 1997 is a permanent law, and that\nsuit allows aggrieved parties to bring suit when the\ncensus produces its plan. So it's certainly at least --\nQUESTION: But is it a fact that somebody is\naggrieved when you are at the stage of the Census Bureau\njust saying this is what I plan to do?\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes. The law involved, the\npublic law, that was a basis of the '97 suit makes it\nclear that if you could say if they do that plan, that's\nexactly how it works in House of Representatives, if you\ndo that plan, we expect that our district will be diluted.\nQUESTION: Well, does the law provide for some\nsort of administrative hearing before the Census Bureau,\nsome sort of an exhaustion requirement? I thought that's\nwhat you were suggesting. If Utah had just brought this\nto the attention of the Census Bureau. Is there some\nstructure for doing that?\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes. The Census Bureau does\nhave a structure for doing this. I'm not saying that they\nare foreclosed because they didn't participate in the\nadministrative process, but the Bureau was open to hear\nthese objections and the\ncourts were open to hear them.\nQUESTION: But, you say now the Bureau, is that\nwell publicized? Is there some person you can go to in the\nBureau and say I don't like what you are doing?\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes. And that is the exact\nprocess that is followed with every -- that's why they\npublish the plan for the census. Now, if --\nQUESTION: It seems unfair to Utah, though, to\nsay that they are supposed to bring a suit before they\nknow they have been hurt and why. How -- what are they\nsupposed to do? Of course they wouldn't come in ahead of\ntime. For all they know, the system would benefit them.\nMR. DELLINGER: Justice Breyer, those who sued\nin the House of Representatives litigation had a very thin\nbasis for knowing that they would be adversely affected.\nIndiana maybe wrong in thinking that --\nQUESTION: Well, of course, sometimes you could\nguess in advance, but a lot of times you couldn't, and\nit's important that there be a fair method that treats\nstates fairly. So why, why would it be fair, any way, to\ncut off those states that don't know they have been\ntreated unfairly and hurt,\nuntil they find out later?\nMR. DELLINGER: And here's why. Here's why it's\nnot unfair. Because the unfairness is so great for the\ndisruption on the other side.\nIf it had been determined by the Bureau itself\nor through litigation that imputation could not be used in\n2000, the Census Bureau absolutely would have used some\nmeans other than imputation to ascertain the enumeration\nof those established residential addresses whose records\nwere damaged, missing or incomplete.\nThere are in North Carolina approximately 16,000\nhouseholds that are established residential addresses on\nthe carefully pruned master address list. Those houses\noften were visited by an enumerator in the, often the\nhouses were added where it was status imputation by a\nfield enumerator during the enumeration process. But the\nnew form, because it wasn't on the master address list\nbefore being added, never caught up with the master\naddress list. So you have no residential addresses, and,\nand the Bureau absolutely would have had another method.\nI mean, even now theoretically they could go\nback and start again and say what are we going to do about\n620,000 established residential addresses\nfor which we don't have input numbers, because at the end\nof this massive process, now, this is a process that\ninvolves 500,000 enumerators, 120 million households, one\nand a half billion pieces of paper, imputation occurs at\nthe end of that process when all the records are\ncentralized. It began in 1960, five censuses ago because\nthat's when computers were able to process these cards.\nDamaged cards, now forms, can't be read. The\ndata is discrepant or missing. It doesn't mean that these\nare households that were visited six times.\nQUESTION: Mr. Dellinger, you have recognized\nthat your argument is, as stated, that the position of\nUtah that can't project what the returns will be, does not\nhave, does not qualify as an aggrieved person at the only\nmoment in time when it can say that it's aggrieved. I\nthink you had another justiciability issue, did you not?\nBecause time is running and I think we grasp your position\nthat it's too bad they are not aggrieved because they have\nto come in in the beginning and not at the end.\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes. Justice Ginsburg, we are\nnot suggesting that these issues are immune from judicial\nreview. I believe someone could challenge\nimputation and would.\nQUESTION: Are you sure they were not aggrieved\nat the beginning? I'm surprised that you -- I mean, is it\nnot an aggrievement for the State of Utah or for any state\nthat its districts are distorted? Even if it doesn't lose,\nyou know, congressmen to another state, isn't the\ndistortation of the districts within that state a\ngrievance of that state?\nMR. DELLINGER: That is a very helpful answer,\nand that is not -- a very helpful suggestion. And that\nhas not been by any means ruled out, nor has it been ruled\nout in my view that a state could say we believe we are\nentitled to have a fair process determine our\nrepresentation. This process isn't fair. We don't know\nhow it's going to come out. But this process is loony.\nNow, you would also see there's just a matter on\nthe merits. Congress has said in Title II, Section 2 that\nthe President's determination shall be final and the\nstates are entitled to that for the next period of time\nuntil the next apportionment unless Congress itself acts,\nwhich they specifically provide for. That's surely\nconstitutional because the Constitution itself in\nproviding that the census\nneed be done only every 10 years puts a great stake in\npermanency.\nNow, turning to the merits, it's striking the\nextent to which the issues in this case are anticipated by\nthe Court's decision in the Wisconsin case. At page 22 in\nWisconsin --\nQUESTION: Before you go on to the merits, you\nhave nothing else to say then about justiciability? I\nmean, let's suppose they can file a suit. What's the\nremedy going to be at the end of the day at this stage?\nMR. DELLINGER: Oh, at this stage?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. DELLINGER: Justice O'Connor, that is a very\ngood question. Utah seems to assume that if the case went\nback to the District Court, overturning the District\nCourt's ruling that imputation is satisfactory on the\nstatute and the Constitution, that you would simply take\nout those occupancy figures for 620,000 households\nnationwide.\nIt seems to me that the, that what ought to be\ndone is you return that to the Bureau and say now there\nmay be time to match up the missing forms that were added\nlate in the enumeration process. There may be other ways\nto recover that data. Ways\nthat certainly would have been done if it were brought\nbefore the census might still be brought now. So that we\ndon't, it seems utterly unfair to treat all of those as\nzero when some of them are houses that, an enumerator\ncomes to 212 Elm Street, it's not on his list, he goes in,\ninterviews Ozzie, Harriet, the kids, sends in the form and\nit was corrupted or it didn't get matched up at the time,\nfaced with that time deadline. It may now be available.\nWe don't know who would prevail on that.\nOn the statutory issue I think if you look at\npage 22, the Court itself creates statistical adjustments\nas done in '70 and '80, and as they were done here --\nQUESTION: Page 22 of what?\nMR. DELLINGER: I'm sorry, Justice Rehnquist. I\nreferred earlier to the decision of Wisconsin vs. the City\nof New York, the unanimous opinion. On the statutory\nissue, the Court says that the statistical adjustments in\n1970 and 1980 which were imputation, hot-deck imputation,\nwere an entirely different type than the adjustment\nconsidered here, and they took place on a dramatically\nsmaller scale.\nThe Court also treats actual enumeration\nin the Wisconsin case and speaks of actual enumeration at\npage 6 in the Wisconsin case as having been something that\nthe Bureau has never, or the country has never actually\nachieved actual enumeration. It's never been wholly\nsuccessful. Treating it clearly as the end result of the\nprocess, the right number and not as a method.\nNow, let me go right to one point. We do not\nbelieve that there are no constitutional limits on how\nCongress can conduct the census. Wisconsin says that\nthere is virtually unlimited deference to Congress, but\nthey also set a standard that the congressional goal must\nbe related to representation according to the respective\nnumbers.\nThe way I read that is this. A proposed census\nas designed is not reasonably calculated to produce\ndistributive accuracy among the states is constitutionally\nsuspect, because it will not produce an apportionment\naccording to the respective numbers. And that would be a\nfatal flaw.\nHere, every imputed occupant and household is to\nan established residential address with a precise\ngeographical location. It was an effort to enumerate\nevery household in the country by using the best\ninformation available on known household\naddresses. This is historically consistent with what we\ndid when the neighbors are asked for their opinion, the\npostal worker is asked for his opinion. You use proxy\ninformation. Here you take --\nQUESTION: Mr. Dellinger, this isn't really a\nuse of proxy information. This isn't going to a neighbor\nwho lives next door, this is using a statistical method to\nmake assumptions, isn't it?\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes, it is.\nQUESTION: I think you have to be realistic\nabout that.\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes, it is a statistical method\nby which you take, when you have a known established\nhousehold address, the information from that, basically\nthe next door neighbor, somewhat refined, Justice\nO'Connor, the next door neighbor that was a nonresponding\nhousehold of a similar type and they found over the years\nthat that information is more reliable than zero.\nUtah's position is that the Constitution\nrequires when you have an address known to be occupied, if\nyou put down that it's occupied by zero people, that's not\nan actual enumeration, that is literally a counterfactual\nenumeration from what one knows to be the case. This is a\nprocess where you\nuse one unit's characteristics to supply to another.\nQUESTION: That's just part of it. It also, it\nalso imputes nonhouseholds as households. I mean, it does\na lot of things.\nMR. DELLINGER: It imputes only to known\naddresses. Thank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Dellinger. General\nOlson, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nSOLICITOR GENERAL, DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\nON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL APPELLEES\nGENERAL OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court: The Census Bureau has consistently\nutilized the imputation technique for drawing inferences\nabout a tiny fraction of damaged, discrepant or missing\npopulation data for the past five censuses.\nQUESTION: Do you agree that that's a\nstatistical methodology or is it just a method of making\ndeductions from circumstantial evidence?\nGENERAL OLSON: We agree that it is a\nstatistical methodology, Justice Kennedy, and it's very\nimportant in that context to focus on the words of the\nstatute. The words of the statute are that the\nstatistical method known as sampling is the one\nthat's prohibited with respect to the apportionment.\nThat statement in the statute suggests that\nother statistical methods are not prohibited by the\nstatuted, and that one particular statistical method, that\nis the one that is known as sampling, which is in quotes\nin the statute, which imports that it's a term of art that\nwas known by Congress to be a term of art. It was a\nphrase that was suggested by the Secretary himself in\n1957, when that statute was added, that exact phrase came\nfrom the Secretary. The Secretary was presumed to know\nwhat that phrase meant. It is a term of art that\nstatisticians know what it is. Furthermore --\nQUESTION: Well, I thought the statute also said\nthat statistical adjustments pose a risk.\nGENERAL OLSON: It does not say that. In fact,\nthe import of the statute, Justice Kennedy, is that\nstatistical adjustments, and I will refer to what my\ncolleague Mr. Dellinger just referred to, at page 22 in\nthe Wisconsin decision which was unanimous decision by\nthis Court just six years ago, distinguishing the sampling\nmethod that the Court was talking about in that case from\nstatistical adjustments known as imputation, which is\ndescribed on pages 4 and 5 of the Respondent's brief,\nreferred\nto on those pages of the Supreme Court, this Court's\nunanimous decision just six years ago as being an entirely\ndifferent thing.\nWe would go back also to the fact that this\nCourt unanimously held in that case that the Constitution\nvests virtually unlimited discretion in Congress\nrespecting the manner in which the census shall be\nconducted, and that Congress has delegated its broad\nauthority to the Secretary to take the census in such form\nand content as he shall direct. Now, the Congress has\nexercised that discretion by passing it on to the\nSecretary with the one limitation with respect, with\nrespect to one statistical method known as sampling.\nNow, at the same time, the Secretary was\nproposing the prohibition of the sampling method; with\nrespect to the apportionment of the census in 1957, the\nSecretary was planning the 1960 census, which was the\nfirst computerized census and the first time that the\nimputation method which we are talking about today was\nused. So it's obvious that the Secretary did not believe\nthat hot-deck imputation was sampling, because the very\nnext census three years later imputation was being used in\nthat census. And it was used again in 1970, 1980, 1990,\nand 2000.\nAnd with respect to 1970, and 1980, it was actually\nconsidered by this Court in connection with the Wisconsin\ncase.\nIt is widely understood in the industry that\nsampling is a collection of, a collection technique\nwhereby a sample, a fraction of the whole population is\nused to deduct -- deduce the actual whole population.\nIt seemed to me that a metaphor that might be\nconsidered outside the context of population gathering\nwould be if the Court asked the library of this Court to\nascertain the number of books, to conduct the number of\nbooks in the Court's library, and the, but sampling was\nnot permitted to do that, so that the librarian could not\ngo to every third shelf, multiply, count the books,\nmultiply by three and get the census. But if the\nlibrarian went to those shelves and counted every\nparticular volume and found that there was a space here on\nthat shelf, a space this big on the next shelf, and a\nspace this big on another shelf, for example, the\nimputation would be saying well, all the books or the\nbooks right next to this are this size, and therefore that\nspace a book is missing, so we know we have a book, and we\nwill impute one book to that space or two\nbooks to this space. So that the sampling technique is\ncompletely discrete from the imputation technique.\nWe know that because the Secretary has always\nregarded it that way. The Congress has given the\nauthority to this expert agency which has been conducting\nthe census for years and years and has drawn various\ndifferent types of inferences which is what imputations\nare.\nQUESTION: Why, just out of curiosity. I mean,\nI'd like to understand this better. In the library, you\nlook and see that everything around the book is a history\nbook and so then you impute the characteristic of being a\nhistory book to the one that's missing. That's your\nanalogy of what goes on here, is that right?\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, yes, I think that's an\nextension of it. In the example that I was giving you\nlook at the space and impute the size of the space by the\nbook that is immediately next to it.\nQUESTION: Okay. Why is it called statistical?\nWhy isn't that just ordinary inference? Why -- you said we\ndo it statistically? What's statistical about it?\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, I'm not sure. That's a\ngood question. I don't know the answer to\nwhy it should be called statistics, because in my thinking\nof it, it is drawing logical inferences from the data\navailable. Now Justice O'Connor, it is not creating\nphantom homes. Most of these cases in, the statistics\nindicated that with respect to one of the forms of the\nimputation, and this is in the record at the joint\nappendix, the information may be found in pages 445\nthrough 448 of the joint appendix, that 98 percent of the\nhousehold size imputation forms were enumerator forms with\nthe status of occupied homes.\nNow, the problem is that with respect to any,\nand the statistics are different, but in 93 percent with\nrespect to occupancy imputation, 75 percent with respect\nto status imputation. Each of these are attempting to\nfind actual people drawing from the closest comparable\nunit and it's one unit for each inference. It's not\nextrapolating from one unit to the whole population.\nThe problem with the census is that there are\nbillions of pieces of paper as Mr. Dellinger indicated.\nSome people refuse to return the forms and their known\naddresses. Some people fill out the forms incorrectly.\nThey may say occupied but zero. The enumerators might get\nbad information.\nIn 1850, a substantial portion of the\nentire State of California the returns were actually\nburned, and the Census Bureau in 1850 actually used a\nprocess to replace the 70,000 people that were not there.\nAnd one of the questions indicated, neighbors have been\nused as proxies. Heads of households have been used as\nproxies. Postal service has been used as proxies. These\nare all means by which the postal, the Census Bureau\nattempts to develop the most accurate count it possibly\ncan.\nQUESTION: When you say heads of households have\nbeen used as proxies. Does that mean you go to the head\nof the household who appears at the door and ask him how\nmany other people live in the house?\nGENERAL OLSON: That's correct, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and that was the way it was done in 1790.\nQUESTION: That doesn't seem too statistical.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, it's not necessarily\nstatistical. And I guess that, the fact is that as far as\nthe statute is concerned, there is only one technique\nthat's prohibited. The technique of drawing inferences\nthrough sampling is prohibited. It's prohibited probably\nbecause Congress feels that it might be subject to\nmanipulation.\nQUESTION: Yes. On the merits, I think we have to\nknow whether this so-called hot-deck imputation is a form\nof sampling. Which it appears that it might well be. I\nthink that's the --\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, Justice O'Connor, the\nexpert agency to which Congress delegated this broad\nauthority doesn't believe so. That seems to me that there\nshould be a substantial deference to the expertise of the\nagency. Not only that, but Congress with full awareness\nthat hot-deck imputation has been used over the past --\nQUESTION: Why do we call it hot-deck?\nGENERAL OLSON: Hot-deck imputation is\ndistinguishable from cold-deck imputation in the sense\nthat information from the most current census and the\nactual neighborhood, the most current available\ninformation for the actual census that's being developed\nis being used. Now where that term came from, I don't\nknow. But that's what it means. But this methodology has\nbeen used with the knowledge of Congress, with the full\nknowledge of Congress, for the past five censuses.\nThere was litigation over this matter, it's\nreferred to as the Orr case in the briefs, where a seat\nmay have been allocated to Indiana or Florida,\ndepending upon how the imputation process came out. So\nthat litigation took place. Congress actually changed the\nterminology, Section 141, which provides the Secretary\nwith the authority to conduct the census in a manner that\nthe Secretary thinks appropriate, in 1976. After\nimputation had been used in two censuses already.\nQUESTION: Of course, against all of that, and\nI'm not sure why we should give deference to the agency\nhere. They didn't conduct a rulemaking. They didn't have\nany adjudication on this subject. That's just what they\nhappened to do, right?\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, as a matter of fact, in\nthe unanimous decision of this Court in the Wisconsin case\nsix years ago, the court said substantial deference should\nbe owed to the agency.\nQUESTION: There's a lot of water over the dam\nsince six years ago.\nGENERAL OLSON: But the reasoning of the Court,\nI would submit, is --\nQUESTION: I refer to Meade in particular.\nAnd, but wouldn't the deference to the agency, even if\nthere is to be some, potentially be outweighed by a\nconstitutional doubt? If we thought that even if this\nisn't sampling, it may well be not enumeration\nwithin the meaning of the constitutional requirement, and\ngiven, given that constitutional doubt, we think the wise\ncourse is to interpret the word sampling as including,\nincluding this?\nGENERAL OLSON: Justice Scalia, not only the\nWisconsin case, but the other decisions of this Court\nwhich have considered census have suggested that the\nframers of the Constitution by using the word enumeration\ndidn't mean a particular method by which the census would\nbe conducted, nor did it wish to constrain both the\nCongress and whomever the Congress may delegate to --\nQUESTION: Even sampling, presumably.\nGENERAL OLSON: Presumably. Possibly.\nQUESTION: Pretty accurate sampling, you know?\nGENERAL OLSON: Possibly, Justice Scalia. But\nthat's nowhere close to that and this is not remotely\nsampling.\nQUESTION: Is this remotely estimation?\nGENERAL OLSON: This is not remotely estimation.\nThis is drawing an inference with respect to one\nparticular piece of data. We would agree that the gross\nestimation --\nQUESTION: Why isn't it estimation? Why\nisn't it estimation? You estimate that there are so many\npeople in this house because the house next door to it has\nthat many people. You don't call that estimation?\nGENERAL OLSON: In each of these cases, Justice\nScalia, the words can be changed and added to, but the\nprocess by which the framers analyzed this in framing the\nConstitution, the very first House of Representatives was\nassigned according to an estimation, and the words actual\nenumeration were used to compare an actual count, an\neffort to find the actual number of people by indulging in\na process --\nQUESTION: That's why I asked about estimation.\nYou say there is a difference in an estimation and a\ndeduction, I suppose.\nGENERAL OLSON: What I think the Constitution\nand courts with respect to the term actual enumeration, is\nan effort to go out and find a count. We, we pointed out\nthat the, the enumeration can mean listing by particular\nitems as used in the Ninth Amendment, the enumerated\npowers. It may be a process by which a count might be\ntaken or it might simply refer to a census, find the\npopulation. We submit that the Capitation Clause as we\nhave referred\nto in our brief, which uses the word census and\nenumeration indistinguishably as synonyms, and in fact the\nAppellants in their brief, in their reply brief at page 15\nacknowledge that the words enumeration and census are used\nin the Constitution interchangeably.\nJustice Scalia, it didn't seem, it does not seem\nthat the framers of the Constitution actually specified a\nmethod. And in fact, what the Appellants were saying here\ntoday and are saying in their briefs, every census\nconducted by asking people who may have lived next door or\ndrawing inferences from other pieces of information would\nnot have been the individual by individual count that --\nQUESTION: You think sampling --\nQUESTION: Sampling would have been okay as far\nas the Constitution is concerned? Real, real sampling?\nGENERAL OLSON: I think --\nQUESTION: We are going to do two-thirds of the\nstate and just guess that the other third is pretty much\nlike that.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, we are not remotely close\nto that here. But with respect --\nQUESTION: I understand. But your\nargument is that since enumeration doesn't mean anything\nexcept census, sampling would be okay.\nGENERAL OLSON: From the standpoint of the\nConstitution, I think a reasonably good argument could be\nmade and the Government has in the past made it, that\nsampling if it is consistent with the process of an\nattempt to find an actual count utilizing sophisticated\naccurate and nonmanipulatable techniques --\nQUESTION: Surely the term actual, though,\nbefore the word enumeration, narrows the idea that, what\nmight otherwise be an enumeration.\nGENERAL OLSON: I believe it does and I think,\nChief Justice, the District Court in this case\ndistinguished actual enumeration from the conjectural\napportionment that actually occurred in the Constitution\nitself with respect to the first House of Representatives.\nWhat we are talking about here today, though, is\nan effort to, an effort to produce extremely conscientious\nand meticulous, to count all of the households in the\nUnited States starting with a meticulously prepared master\naddress list. All of those people were submitted post\noffice forms which has been authorized by Congress for a\ncertain --\nQUESTION: That's not the issue. Can I ask you a\nquestion about the standing issue? I know that you in your\nbrief do not, do not contest the standing. You say that\nFranklin has decided it, because four justices thought\nthat there was standing on one basis, and four thought\nthere was standing on another basis. Which of those two\nbases do you agree with?\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, we --\nQUESTION: Do, do, do, is it your position that\nthe President will have to do whatever, whatever, accept\nwhatever revised census figures are submitted to him by,\nby the Secretary?\nGENERAL OLSON: If this Court is to, determines\nthat the process by which the 2000 census was conducted\nwas inconsistent with the statute or inconsistent with the\nConstitution and orders the Secretary to take out the\nimputed numbers --\nQUESTION: Right.\nGENERAL OLSON: -- and deliver a different\npiece of information to the President --\nQUESTION: Right.\nGENERAL OLSON: -- the President will transmit\nthat certificate or that certified, those certified\nresults to Congress for the process. In\nother words, in answer to your question, the President\nwill do what this Court assumed in those cases that the\nPresident would do.\nQUESTION: He has told you that that's what he\nwill do?\nGENERAL OLSON: The President will --\nQUESTION: You see, because, I sort of wouldn't\nwant to make the people of North Carolina mad by taking\naway one of their representatives. And were I President,\nI might well say, look at this judgment of the Court,\ndoesn't run against me. It runs against my Secretary,\neverybody agrees, you know, that it's not binding upon me.\nIt's sort of like a declaratory judgment. And I just\nthink too much time has passed and it would upset things\ntoo much and I don't want to take away a representative.\nGENERAL OLSON: The President is willing to\naccept the import, not only of the Franklin and the other\ndecision that we referred to, but also if this Court\ndecides that the process was unconstitutional or\ninconsistent with the statute, the President will accept\nthat, this Court's judgment in that respect.\nQUESTION: So if another, if the next President\ncomes along, we get another case like this,\nand the next President tells his Solicitor General, I will\nnot accept it, then we come out differently.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, if, for that reason, if\nMr. Chief Justice, the Court decides that that is not the\nkind of result that this Court can issue, because of that\npossibility, we'll accept that result as well.\n(Laughter.)\nGENERAL OLSON: But we think -- we think it\nis very unlikely for that to occur, because it is quite\nclear that the Constitution intended to give considerable\nflexibility, did not want to freeze in a system the\nability of the Government.\nQUESTION: Mr. Olson, you are saying we can\npresume the President will obey the law?\nGENERAL OLSON: Yes, Justice Stevens.\nQUESTION: What happens after that? He transmits\nto the Congress, I take it the clerk of the Congress says\nnot certified, the House has not certified the results\nyet?\nGENERAL OLSON: I'm not sure of the answer to\nthat question. I guess the answer is that is correct. Or\nno. That it has been certified and I would gather that it\nwould have to be a revised certification if that should\noccur.\nQUESTION: You say you assume the President will\nobey the law. So you are accepting the -- you are\naccepting the position that the President must, even if he\ndidn't want to, that the law requires him to transmit\nwhatever the Secretary gives him, is that right?\nGENERAL OLSON: What we are saying --\nQUESTION: Just answer that question yes or no.\nDo you take the position that the President must transmit\nwhat the Secretary gives it to him, and he has no, no\nobjection?\nGENERAL OLSON: I only can answer it this way,\nJustice Scalia. If this Court determines that the process\nbefore was unconstitutional or in violation of the statute\nand the Secretary must redo it and if that information is\ntransmitted to the Secretary, he will transmit that.\nQUESTION: That is not the question I asked.\nGENERAL OLSON: Then I misunderstood your\nquestion.\nQUESTION: The question I asked is whether, you\nsay the President will obey the law. I take that to mean\nthat you feel the President is bound by law to transmit\nwhatever revised figures the\nSecretary takes, is that correct?\nGENERAL OLSON: If it is based upon a decision\nby this Court that the Court has the power to issue --\nQUESTION: To tell the Secretary. Let's assume\nwe have the power to tell the Secretary. Does the\nPresident acknowledge that he is bound by law to transmit\nwhatever figures the Secretary gives him?\nGENERAL OLSON: I think that that would only\noccur in the context of this Court's decision.\nQUESTION: If not, he is not bound by law and I\ndon't think you are going to give that away.\nGENERAL OLSON: I don't think we need to give\nanything away, Justice Scalia. We would be talking about\na context in which this Court came to the conclusion it\ncould render a jurisprudentially binding decision in a\ncase in which there was redressability in that context.\nQUESTION: Fine. But that's a far cry by saying\nhe is bound by law.\nQUESTION: You seem to be accepting Marbury and\nMadison.\n(Laughter.)\nGENERAL OLSON: Let me just summarize because my\ntime is about up. This Court's words\nagain, that the Constitution gave virtually unlimited\ndiscretion to the Congress with respect to the manner in\nwhich the census would be --\nQUESTION: Extend your time by two minutes.\nI'll extend Mr. Lee's time by two minutes.\nGENERAL OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nThere is no evidence that the framers of the Constitution\nwanted to bind themselves to a particular method of\ncounting people. All of the evidence suggested that what\nthe framers wanted to do was to have a reasonably reliable\naccurate, reasonably accurate count of the citizens in the\nmanner that the, that Congress would determine. Congress\nin the words of this Court has delegated all of that broad\nauthority to the Census Bureau.\nThe Census Bureau, conscientiously using a\ntechnique that they have been using consistently for 50\nyears with the awareness of Congress, the General\nAccounting Office, oversight committees and the actual\nawareness of this Court, as reflected in this 1996\ndecision, has demonstrated, developed a method that is\nreasonably accurate, uses statistical methods other than\nthose known as sampling to get an accurate court. We urge\nthe Court to sustain that outcome.\nQUESTION: Thank you, General Olson.\nMr. Lee, you have five minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS R. LEE\nON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS.\nMR. LEE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I have\njust two or three quick points. The first is to clarify\nbriefly the record on an important issue. With all due\nrespect to the Solicitor General, the record does not\nindicate that the majority of the imputations here were in\nunits known to be occupied.\nThe Bureau's memo at page 445 of the joint\nappendix indicates that fully 69 percent of the units\nsubjected to imputation were the kinds of units that\nJustice O'Connor's questions directed us to be concerned\nabout, units where after as many as six visits, census\nenumerators were not able to determine whether the unit in\nquestion was a valid occupied housing unit and not a\nduplicate, not a seasonal home, not a home that happens\nnot to be occupied.\nSecond, I would point the Court to another\nunanimous decision that this Court has handed down with\nregard to the census, and it's the Montana decision, and\nI'd like to read a brief quote from Montana and explain\nhow important I think it is here. This is from 503 U.S.\nat 465.\n\"To the extent that the potentially\ndivisive and complex issues associated with apportionment\ncan be narrowed by the adoption of both procedural and\nsubstantive rules that are consistently applied year after\nyear, the public is well served.\"\nThat is precisely the goal of both the Census\nAct and the Census Clause. To give us rules that can be\nconsistently applied year after year, not rules that will\nebb and flow with debates among statisticians, and that's\nwhere the Census Bureau is heading us here. The variable\nstandard that will be produced by a debate as to whether a\nparticular method of sampling is sufficiently premeditated\nor follows a sufficiently premeditated intent to --\nQUESTION: What about what we said in the\nWisconsin vs. New York case by your opponent, Mr.\nDellinger, where we referred to this very kind of action,\nthis imputation, and indicated that that was vastly\ndifferent from the broader statistical?\nMR. LEE: I don't believe that was an issue in\nthat case, first of all, Justice O'Connor. Secondly,\nthere isn't any reason to give either deference to the\nSecretary here or much less to congressional inaction for\na very important reason. Imputation simply has not been\non anyone's radar\nscreen. It's been a nonentity because it's undisputed\nthat it impacted apportionment only once prior to this\ncase, in 1980. In 1960, in 1970, in 1990, it had no\nimpact. Congress reenacted the statute, amended the\nstatute in 1976.\nAt that point in time, imputation had never\naffected apportionment to any degree whatsoever. There\nwas no reason for anyone even to be focusing on it and\ntherefore no reason to give any deference here.\nI'd like to just close by saying a few brief\nwords about the constitutional question here. Mr. Chief\nJustice, to go back to your question about the word\nactual. The word actual is important, and it's important\nbecause it's not just that the word enumeration is defined\nto mean an actual count and not an estimate. It's that\nthis was a term of art. This phrase actual enumeration\nwas used consistently in the founding era, both in\ncolonial assessments of population when they reported\ntheir populations to boards of trade, and also in Great\nBritain throughout the 18th century. James Madison\nhimself referred to a distinction between an actual\nenumeration and a mere estimate. John Adams similarly\nsaid there is a difference between an authentic\nenumeration and a\nmere estimate.\nNot only that, but the framers of the\nConstitution thought they were giving us a permanent,\nfixed standard. That's what they said they were doing and\nJames Madison said not only is it permanent and fixed, it\nis the way required by the Constitution and \"which we are\nobliged to perform.\" It was a methodology; they\nunderstood it as such; and they understood also that it\nhad its shortcomings. They knew that it would result in\nan undercount, that when you require a count, you are\ngoing to leave some people out.\nGeorge Washington himself said look, we\nunderstand at the time of the first census that the real\nnumbers will exceed greatly the official returns. Thomas\nJefferson similarly said we know that the omissions in the\ncensus will be great. If they understood those\nlimitations, then why did they do it? The answer is clear.\nThey understood that that was a necessary price of a\npermanent, fixed, precise standard that would not be\nsubject to manipulation, that would not be subject to the\nvicissitudes of debates among not only politicians, but\nstatisticians from year to year. And the impulse, the\nproper impulse of this Court's unanimous\ndecision in Montana --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Lee.\n"
