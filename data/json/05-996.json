        "content": "(10:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst today in Marrama versus Citizens Bank of\nMassachusetts. Mr. Baker.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID G. BAKER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BAKER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nSection 706(a) of the Bankruptcy Code\nprovides that a debtor may convert a case under chapter\n7 to a case under any other chapter of the Bankruptcy Code\nat any time if the case has not been converted previously\nfrom another chapter, and that any waiver of the right\nto convert a case under the subsection is unenforceable.\nOther subsections of section 706 give rules for the\nCourt to decide about conversion in the case where some\nparty other than the debtor requests conversion of the\ncase and also provides that the conversion must lead to\na chapter to which that debtor is qualified to be a\ndebtor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Baker, as I\nunderstand it subsequent to the grant of certiorari in\nthis case, your client filed for relief under Chapter 13\nand that relief was denied. You're now seeking under --\nyour petition seeks a conversion to Chapter 13 and I\nguess I wonder what relief is still open to you.\nMR. BAKER: In the present case or the new\ncase?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What relief is open\nto you in this case? In other words, you're trying to\nget a conversion to Chapter 13. Subsequently, you've\ntried to apply for relief under Chapter 13 and that's\nbeen denied. Why isn't the case moot in the sense that\nthat relief is not available to you now?\nMR. BAKER: The circumstances of the new\ncase are entirely different. In fact, in that -- in the\npresent -- the new case, the court decided that he was not\neligible because his debt limit exceeded the statutory\nlimitations that exist section 109(e). There is a\nthree-year time span between the two, and we believe\nthat the existing case is not moot because he still has\nremedies that he can obtain in Chapter 13.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if he isn't\neligible -- the new case determined that he was not\neligible because his debts were too high. He didn't\nincur additional debts between the time of the\nproceeding one and proceeding two?\nMR. BAKER: Yes, Your Honor, he did.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Or he didn't reduce the\ndebt. If we have a finding from the bankruptcy court\nthat he is ineligible, that is number one condition\nto convert into Chapter 13. If you don't meet that\ncondition, that's the end of the matter.\nMR. BAKER: I wouldn't say it would be the\nend of the matter in the present case because the\neligibility was never questioned below, was never a\nfactor below.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But now there has been a\nfinding, and it's an essential finding, that there be\neligibility. And wouldn't the bankruptcy court's\nfindings in the later case have preclusive effect?\nMR. BAKER: In the prior case? I would say\nno, Your Honor. First, because as I mentioned, the\nissue of eligibility within the monetary limits was\nnever raised below. And in fact, if you look at his\nschedules in the supplemental joint appendix, he is\nclearly within the statutory limits based -- just\nlooking at his schedules.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's a question you\ncan argue on appeal in -- from the recent decisions, but\nfor the moment you have a bankruptcy court making that\ndetermination, which I think would be preclusive on\nanother bankruptcy court.\nMR. BAKER: The -- well, the -- the\nbankruptcy court made a decision in the current case,\nthe new case, but they haven't dismissed it. Dismissal\nis in fact on appeal to the District Court for the\nDistrict of Massachusetts. The reason is, in our view\nis that the bankruptcy court in the new case incorrectly\nlooked back to the claims that had been filed in the prior\ncase.\nNow, it is a difficult issue in some\nrespects because there is case law at least in\nMassachusetts or the First Circuit that says a debtor\ndoes not have standing to object to claims in a Chapter\n7 case. So the fact that a number of claims were\nfiled and argued doesn't relate to, in a prior case,\ndoes not have a preclusive effect in the new case.\nNow we did, in fact, object to quite a\nnumber of claims and the eligibility, and I think that\nultimately once the claim objections are resolved, we\nwill be within the statutory limits.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If the decision is\naffirmed on appeal to the First Circuit, do you think\nyou could still argue that there's qualification for\nChapter 13, after the court of appeals has affirmed a\ndetermination that there isn't?\nMR. BAKER: I'm -- I don't quite follow the\nquestion. Would you mind restating it?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: We have now a judgment that\nthis debtor is ineligible for Chapter 13. If that\njudgment is affirmed on appeal to the court of appeals,\ncan you nonetheless argue that somehow there is no\npreclusive effect?\nMR. BAKER: Yes, Your Honor, because there's\na three-year difference between the two and\nsubstantially different facts. The -- we have to go\nback, I think, to the case that's at bar, because it is\nthose claims, the claims that were filed in the current\ncase that are the issue. As I say, we are in the process\nof doing objections to those claims and I think that\nultimately we will come within them.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They're not at issue as far\nas this mootness question goes. I mean, you're seeking\nto have the right to file under 13.\nAnd if, in fact, there's no eligibility to\nfile under 13, you're asking for the impossible. The\ncase is simply -- you know -- it's just air. So I\nguess, perhaps you rely on the fact that the case is\nstill on appeal. Should we not take as a given that\nthere is a judgment that you don't qualify for 13, and\nyet you're coming before us asking us to say that you\ncan apply under Chapter 13. It doesn't make any sense.\nMR. BAKER: Well, I would respectfully say --\nsuggest that it does, Your Honor, because once -- we don't\nreally get to the eligibility question until the court\nbelow considers it in the context of the case that's at bar.\nWe have to, as I say, we are in the process of objecting to\nclaims and resolving them. Now the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, didn't you make that\nargument to the bankruptcy court that found that you\nwere not eligible?\nMR. BAKER: No, Your Honor, because as I\nmentioned before, the case law in the First Circuit up\nto this point has held that a Chapter 7 debtor does not\nhave standing to object to claims. Now in the new case,\nin fact, the bankruptcy court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's what I'm asking. A\nChapter 7 debtor doesn't, but a Chapter 13 debtor\npresumably does. So didn't you make the same argument\nto the bankruptcy court.\nMR. BAKER: In the old case, yes, once we\nconverted the chapter.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And they rejected it?\nMR. BAKER: No. I beg your pardon, Your\nHonor. No, we did not address eligibility in the\npresent case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't care about the\npresent case. I care about the Chapter 13 case in which\nyou have been found not to qualify for Chapter 13\ntreatment. Didn't you make before that court the same\nargument you're making now that some of the debts\nshouldn't be counted.\nMR. BAKER: I did.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They rejected it, right?\nMR. BAKER: Pardon?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And they rejected it?\nMR. BAKER: The bankruptcy court did reject\nit, yes. But they rejected it because, as I say, up to\nthat point the case law had held that we did not have\nstanding to object to the claims, so we were bound by\nwhat was there.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you said it was only a\nChapter 7 debtor who couldn't object.\nMR. BAKER: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you are applying under\nChapter 13.\nMR. BAKER: Right. What I'm trying to say\nis in the previous Chapter 7 case we lacked standing to\nobject to those claims and that in the new Chapter 13\ncase the court took the Chapter 7 case claims and said,\nyou're bound by these in the new chapter 13 case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Didn't you object to that\nand say you should look at these claims afresh?\nMR. BAKER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And what did the court say?\nDid it say it had to or that it did so and still found\nthem over the limit.\nMR. BAKER: It -- the bankruptcy court in\nthe new case said -- pardon? The bankruptcy court in\nthe new case said that there are circumstances under\nwhich a debtor would have standing. This was in effect\na new rule of law for that, for this district. So\nsubsequent to that decision we did, in fact, object to\nquite a number of claims and substantially reduced the\ntotal of those claims, and I think that once --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What did the bankruptcy\ncourt say?\nMR. BAKER: The bankruptcy court sustained\nour objections to those claims and in fact reduced the\ntotal substantially.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that.\nBut did it reduce it to a level that you qualified for\nChapter 13 treatment?\nMR. BAKER: We are not finished with the\nclaims objection process. I believe that once we are --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course you are. They've\nrendered a decision. How could you not be finished with\nthe claims objection process if the bankruptcy court has\nrendered a final decision.\nMR. BAKER: Because the bankruptcy court\nrendered a final decision which is on appeal in the new\ncase. We are objecting to the Chapter 7 claims in the\nold case. I apologize if this is confusing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is terribly confusing.\nIt seems to me that the Chapter 13 bankruptcy court had\nthe responsibility for determining whether you qualified\nunder the, you know, under the amount of debt.\nMR. BAKER: And it did so by reference to\nthe claims that had been filed in the previous Chapter 7\ncase. We can't object to claims in a Chapter 13 case\nthat haven't been filed. So procedurally, we had to go\nback to the Chapter 7 case and do the claims objections\nwithin the context of the old Chapter 7 case.\nNow, in the Chapter 13 case we used the --\nthe bankruptcy court used the total of those claims that\nhad been filed in the Chapter 7 case to determine\neligibility in the 13.\nIn doing so, the bankruptcy court basically\nannounced a new rule of law that the claims that had\nbeen filed would be essentially I suppose, res judicata\nin the subsequent case, but that in some cases a\nChapter 7 debtor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you objected to that, I\ngather?\nMR. BAKER: Sorry?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You objected to that, to\nthat ruling?\nMR. BAKER: Not necessarily, because it does\ngive you a vehicle to go back to the old Chapter 7 case\nand do the procedural claims objections in that case,\nwhich is what we did, and we substantially reduced the\ntotal of the claims.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the status of the\nChapter 7 case? I was under the impression it had been\ndismissed and a determination of no discharge had\nbeen made.\nMR. BAKER: A determination of no discharge\nhad been entered. However, it was an asset case, so it\nremains open, it remains open at this point, until the\nChapter 7 trustee makes a distribution to creditors or\nfiles his final report with the court. It has not been\ndismissed.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's a\ndetermination that you're not entitled to a discharge?\nThat has been made.\nMR. BAKER: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If we just could go to the\nmerits for a second here. You're saying this word,\nwhere it says, the word is you \"may convert,\" and that\nmeans you can convert no matter what?\nMR. BAKER: The plain language of the\nstatute says that, yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No matter what? Okay,\nsuppose they repeal Chapter 13 before you convert. Then\ncan you convert?\nMR. BAKER: I'm sorry. Would you repeat\nthat?\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm just producing examples\nwhere it's clear you can't convert. Now, suppose\nCongress -- there is no Chapter 13. Could you convert\nthen?\nMR. BAKER: Not if there's no Chapter 13.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, okay. Suppose he dies.\nCould you convert then?\nMR. BAKER: If the debtor dies?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. No inheritance, no\nnothing.\nMR. BAKER: Well, there is a rule, I believe\nit's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Even though there's no such\nperson existing any more. He's gone and his whole\nfamily is gone, and there's no inheritors, nothing.\nThen can he convert? No.\nMR. BAKER: Right. I think the rule 2009\nsays, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm trying to produce\nridiculous examples. Maybe -- all right, so you say\neven if he's dead and there's no family he still could\nconvert. That's an extreme test of my hypothetical, but\nokay. What about if, in fact, he goes insane? No.\nMR. BAKER: Well, again, Your Honor, the\nrule says --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about if, in fact, the\nconversion is part of a scheme to defraud millions of\npeople in a foreign country because it will be viewed as\na signal that they should mail their life savings into a\nparticular account in Switzerland? Can he convert then?\nMR. BAKER: The statute is plain, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You say yes on that?\nMR. BAKER: I would say yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Even though it's going to\nbilk people out of millions of dollars?\nMR. BAKER: I think that the statute is\nplain and says that the debtor may convert.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No matter what? Even if\nhe's dead, even if he's insane?\nMR. BAKER: Even if he's insane.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well alright, then I can't\nget anywhere with my hypotheticals.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: I would have thought the\nanswer was no, but there we are.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Baker, couldn't the\n-- let's say the conversion goes through. The first\nthing that the bankruptcy court does in the Chapter 7\nconverted to Chapter 13 is say: I'm going to dismiss\nthis suit, the -- the bad faith taint stays with the\ncase, it doesn't get -- you can't erase it; and so back\nyou go to the Chapter 7. Why couldn't the bankruptcy\ncourt now sitting as a Chapter 13 court say: We're not\ngoing to let a debtor who has conducted himself in bad\nfaith proceed in this court?\nMR. BAKER: The bankruptcy court could\ncertainly do that. The procedural safeguards of due\nprocess require, obviously, notice and hearing of the\ncourt's reasons for wanting to say that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but your claim doesn't\nrest on a due process denial of hearing does it? That's\nnot, that's not the question you brought to us. So it\nseems to me that Justice Ginsburg's question is not\nanswered by saying, well, he'd get a hearing in that\ncase. The fact remains that in that case the, as I\nunderstand it, the judge in Chapter 13 could immediately\ndeconvert to Chapter 7, couldn't he?\nMR. BAKER: Well, I wouldn't say he could\nimmediately reconvert. Again, there is the due process\nrequirement that the debtor have an opportunity to be\nheard on the issue.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But due process is not the\nissue here. The fact is the bankruptcy court could\ndeconvert or reconvert to Chapter 7, in effect,\nfollowing the election that the debtor makes. That's\nso, isn't it?\nMR. BAKER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well then, why would we\nhave a system as ridiculous as to preclude the court\nfrom looking at fraud or bad faith at the moment of\nelection, go through the paperwork and the folderol of\nconverting to 13, and immediately turn around,\nadmittedly having the power, to deconvert? That would\nbe a rather foolish system.\nMR. BAKER: Well, perhaps, but it is the\nsystem that Congress has given us. Congress has said\nthe debtor may convert at any time so long as it has not\nbeen converted previously.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When cases are\nreconverted to Chapter 7, is that typically done before\nor after the filing of the Chapter 13 plan?\nMR. BAKER: Most of the time, a plan is -- I\ndon't do it this way, but most practitioners will file a\nplan at the same time as they file the notice, the\nmotion to convert.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But they don't have to.\nMR. BAKER: They don't have to.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And the deconversion could\nbe done prior to the filing of the plan?\nMR. BAKER: I suppose arguably it could. In\nmy view, the statutory provisions of section 1307 have to\nbe applied to the question of conversion. So I think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Creditors -- under\nChapter 13 one of the prerequisites to approval of the\nplan is that the creditors get at least as much as they\nwould have gotten under Chapter 7, right?\nMR. BAKER: That's correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So presumably the\ncreditors might want to see what the Chapter 13 plan\nlooks like themselves.\nMR. BAKER: Exactly. Exactly. Exactly.\nAnd I think it's the Tenth Circuit Bankruptcy\nAppellate Panel noted that sometimes a problem debtor\nfiles a plan and gets it confirmed, pays creditors,\nand everybody winds up better off.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could the district\ncourt -- pardon me. Could the bankruptcy court make\nthat same determination in deciding whether or not to\nallow the Chapter 7 proceeding to be converted? He\ncould make this inquiry in a Chapter 7 proceeding? He\nsays: I don't think you should be able to convert\nbecause there's a fraud, but I'll look at how the\ncreditors come out. Could he do that? And then you\ndon't have the specter that Justice Souter referred to\nof this transfer back and then the transfer back, which\nis a waste of time.\nMR. BAKER: Well, again, the statute says\nthat the debtor may convert except in certain\ncircumstances. I think that the requirement of a motion\nto convert a case gives the court the procedural\nmechanism for looking at the case, seeing, making sure\nthat the debtor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But there is a difference,\nand this is -- assume with me, which apparently you\ndon't agree, that everywhere in law there are implied\nexceptions for unusual circumstances. I have never\nfound an instance where you couldn't think of some\nexception that they didn't see. You could not bring a\nthing if you were insane or dead or if a death would\nensue or a murder. Assume that, all right.\nThen the question would be, well, what about\nthis instance? And I think the strongest instance --\nthe strongest argument for saying there's is no\nexception here is the argument that the trustee\ndiscovers that this individual is behaving dishonestly,\nthat he's hidden assets. Maybe he has a safe deposit\nbox and he has a key and the key -- the key will allow\nhim to get diamonds out of the safe deposit box and hide\nthem. Under 7, the trustee has the key. As soon as you\nconvert it to 13 the key is given back to the debtor,\nwho has been shown dishonest.\nNow, assuming you're going to have some\nexceptions, why isn't that a very, very powerful one?\nMR. BAKER: Because ultimately the Chapter\n13 trustee has the same powers of the Chapter 7 trustee\nwith the exception, as Your Honor is pointing out, of\npossession of the property in the bankruptcy estate.\nBut that's how Congress wrote the statute. We should\nnot ignore Congress's command about the process of\nconverting and look for exceptions before we proceed to\ngo back to the appellate court --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If I could come back to a\nprior question. Unless there is some different\nprocedure required when -- between the two situations of\ndenial of conversion from 7 to 13 and allowing\nconversion but with immediate reconversion back to 7,\nunless there's some difference between that's required\nby the code in those two situations, maybe it is because\nyou have to -- in the reconversion situation, you have\nto wait until the plan is filed. Maybe it's because the\nbad faith doesn't carry over.\nBut unless there's some difference, I don't see\nwhat this case is about.\nMR. BAKER: Well, ultimately the case is\nabout the language of the statute and whether the court\nshould apply it as written. And I think --\nJUSTICE ALITO: You can't provide any reason\nwhy there's a difference between those two?\nMR. BAKER: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE ALITO: You deny -- do you dispute\nthe fact that the bankruptcy court could simultaneously\nconvert on the motion of the debtor from 7 to 13 and\nduring the 20-day period that's required by the rule,\nthe rules, reconvert? Do you dispute that, for bad\nfaith?\nMR. BAKER: I dispute that the court could\ndo it sua sponte and without notice and an opportunity\nfor a hearing.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If it gives notice and\nan opportunity for a hearing during the 20 day period --\nyou have to give 20 days notice before the conversion\ntakes place; is that correct, from 7 to 13?\nMR. BAKER: I believe that's correct. When\nyou file a motion, a 20 day notice is required, yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If it has the hearing during\nthat period, you don't dispute that the court could do\nthat, or do you?\nMR. BAKER: Well, again we come to the\nquestion of when the plan gets filed. The plan isn't\nfiled until after it's converted, according to the\nrules.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But here there was a\nhearing on the motion to convert, right? There was a\nhearing?\nMR. BAKER: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And as I understand it,\nthere was no objection to the character of that hearing?\nThere was no request for an evidentiary hearing? So\nthere was a hearing. Now, does that get wiped out too,\njust the way, the determination that you couldn't\nconvert?\nMR. BAKER: The procedure I would, I would\nexpect to see is that if the court saw an issue of fact\nwith respect to whether the case had been converted or\nwhether the debtor was eligible for it to be a debtor in\nthe chapter to which he seeks conversion, then an\nevidentiary hearing would be required.\nIf -- the fact that there was no evidentiary\nhearing in the particular case here, I think, I think we\nhave to go back to recognize the fact that most issues\nin bankruptcy court are decided summarily on motion\npractice.\nAnd it is my feeling that, the\njurisprudence of rule 56 has to apply. If a court\nsees that there are disputed issues of fact, the court\nmust schedule an evidentiary hearing. It cannot, it\ncannot simply grant summary judgment without furtherance\nissue of fact. So this is why I say that,\nthat on these two -- the two particular points -- and\nobviously, the question of whether it has been\npreviously converted is very easy to determine. But as\npreviously discussed, the issue of eligibility, whether\nthe claims and the debt is within the statutory\nlimitation, is an issue of fact that ultimately might\nrequire an evidentiary hearing.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But your case as I\nunderstand it, your case does not turn on the question\nwhether there was or was not, should or should not have\nbeen a hearing in this case, an evidentiary hearing in\nthis case; is that correct?\nMR. BAKER: That's correct. That's correct,\nbecause in our view the schedules -- excuse me -- in our\nview the schedules in this case clearly indicate that it\n-- that he was within the statutory limitations, at\nleast as far as the schedules go.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. -- Mr. Baker, I have -- I\nhave a question on a matter that really upsets me\nand causes me to wonder how, you know, how much we can\nrely upon your description here. You claimed in the\npetition that the reason your client filed under Chapter\n7 rather than 13 was that he was unemployed at the time.\nAnd that he decided to go to 13 after he became\nemployed.\nYet, on -- as shown in the supplemental\nappendix, when he filed under Chapter 7, under penalty\nof perjury, he said that he was employed, and at\nthe meeting of the creditors, he confirmed under oath\nthat he was employed.\nWhat was it? Was he employed or not\nemployed?\nMR. BAKER: On the petition date itself, he\nwas not. And if you look at schedule I, which is at\npage 30 of the supplemental joint appendix, at the\nbottom line, bottom of the -- and it indicates that he\nwas in the process of having a second tenant in his\nrental property and that he was beginning a job at about\nthe time the petition --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It says employment,\noccupation, name of employer: Capital Carpet and\nFlooring. How long employed, five months. Address of\nemployment: Woburn, Massachusetts. It also says the\nsame thing on page 18 of the supplemental appendix. And\nalso with the meeting of creditors. If you look at the\njoint appendix at 64a, he says the same thing that he\nwas employed. Was he employed or not employed?\nMR. BAKER: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does he go around swearing\nhe was when he wasn't?\nMR. BAKER: No, he was -- he was not employed\nat the time. If you look at his page 18, as you\npoint out, it says at the bottom the income given is\nestimated based on a new job which is about to start.\nHe had -- he had been the principal of a company called RLM\nFlooring, which had been closed by Citizens Bank. So he\nwas, in fact, unemployed because Citizens Bank had taken\nall of the assets of the corporation and shut it down.\nAnd this put him of course behind on his mortgage so he\nwas very concerned about finding employment so he could\nin fact, keep -- get his mortgage current and then\nretain his home.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Look on page 64a of the\nappendix, the meeting of creditors. Trustee says okay,\nand you now work for another entity, Capital Carpet and\nFlooring, sir? And Mark Marrama says yes.\nMR. BAKER: Right. And between the -- between\nthe time of petition at the meeting of creditors which\nwas approximately six -- six weeks later, he became\nemployed.\nAs I say, he had a mortgage. He had children\nto whom he has to pay child support. At the time he had\na wife he owed a lot of money to. He was concerned about\nhaving employment so he could in fact meet those\nobligations.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask, I may have\nmissed some of the colloquy here -- is it correct that\nhe would not be eligible to file a-- to have a,\ninstitute a Chapter 13 proceeding if he had unsecured\ndebts of over a certain amount?\nMR. BAKER: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And what if at the time he\nmakes the motion to convert, which you say he has an\nabsolute right to make, what if the record then\ndisclosed that he had debts exceeding that amount? What\nshould the bankruptcy judge do in that case?\nMR. BAKER: The bankruptcy judge should\nexamine the claims that have been filed, if any, do\nthe arithmetic, offer the debtor an opportunity --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: He concludes they're\nover the amount? So it is clear under the record. What\nshould he do then?\nMR. BAKER: He should deny conversion.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: He should what?\nMR. BAKER: He should deny conversion. If in\nfact --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So he does not have an\nabsolute right in all cases to convert, then.\nMR. BAKER: It's absolute except in the\ntwo circumstances stated in the statute.\nOne of which, is as Your Honor is pointing out, the\neligibility, the other is that if it has been previously\nconverted he does not have that right.\nIf the Court has no further questions, I'll\nreserve my remaining time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Baker.\nMR. BAKER: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Brunstad.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF G. ERIC BRUNSTAD,\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe bankruptcy court need not sit idly by\nand grant a motion which is part of an abusive scheme.\nThe power of the court is there to deny such a motion.\nIt is there by statute under section 105; it is there\nbecause the courts have always had power.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under -- you think\n105 is an affirmative grant of power?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: I think the second sentence\nof 105(a) supports the traditional powers that courts\nhave had to grant relief, to prevent or to deny relief\nto prevent abuse or to remedy bad faith conduct. The\nfact that the debtor has the authorization under section 706\nto convert a case cannot be construed to prevent the\ncourt from sua sponte taking action to prevent abuse --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 105(a) is much more\nlimited than that. It is only if you take the second\nclause of that out of context and quote it, as has been\ndone, that it looks like an affirmative grant. It says:\n\"No provision of this title providing for the raising of\nan issue by a party in interest shall be construed to\npreclude the court from taking sua sponte other action.\"\nThat's a much more limited, narrow provision telling you\nnot to imply a negative pregnant from a requirement\nthat a particular party raise an issue. I -- as a\nsource of sweeping powers to, to basically act as a\nroving commission in equity, I think that's a\nmis-citation.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Well, Chief Justice Roberts,\nI think that in order to understand 106(a), the second\nsentence, completely, I think it is important to\nunderstand it was added to 105 in 1986 in response to a\nnumber of decisions that were holding that the courts\ndid not have the -- the bankruptcy courts did not have\nthe authority to sua sponte take action to prevent abuse,\nto monitor their own calendars, to make sure that\ninappropriate things weren't happening, and that Senator\nHatch when he introduced this legislation which was\nultimately enacted, the goal was to overturn cases like\nthe Second Circuit's decision in Grissom to provide\nexpressly and perhaps not as clearly as perhaps they\nintended, to give the courts this power. But I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was that Second Circuit's\ndecision a decision that said the court didn't have the\npower because it had not been moved to take that action\nby the party who had the responsibility for raising the\nissue? Was that the basis for the Second Circuit's\ndecision?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: In part, yes. The court also\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Then -- then you haven't\ncontradicted what the Chief Justice suggested.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Well, I think -- I think\n105(a), the second sentence is worded the way that it\nis. It doesn't say exactly that the courts may take any\naction of sua sponte. It says shall not be construed;\nthe fact that a party has the right to make an action shall\nnot be construed to deny the court the right sua sponte to\ntake an action. But I think that the implication of the\nstatute is clear. There is this background principle which\napplies not only in bankruptcy cases but in trial court\ncases in the district courts everywhere, that this Court\nrecognized in Chambers, that it has specific application\nin this Court's jurisprudence in bankruptcy in Pepper\nversus Litton and other cases, that the bankruptcy\ncourts may take action to prevent abuse. And in fact,\nthey must do so. Because by granting a motion, by\nsitting back and allowing the court to grant relief that\nfurthers an abusive scheme in essence makes the court\ncomplicit in the fraud or misdealing. We can't have that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you do about\nthe different structures, wording between 706(a) and\n706(b)? I mean, this provision says debtor may. The\nother provisions say that a debtor may ask a court to\norder, and it suggests a difference in who has the\nprimary responsibility, whether it is a motion of the\nCourt or whether it is an independent action.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Mr. Chief Justice, I think\nthat the drafting conventions between the two subsections\nis key. 706(a) says the debtor may convert. Whereas\nother sections of the code, like 1307(b), other\nprovisions, provide that upon request of the debtor,\nthe court shall take some particular action. Here the\nuse of the \"May\" -- I think the word \"may\" properly\nsignals discretion in the court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think under\nthose other provisions the court doesn't have this\ninherent power or the implicit power from 105(a) that\nyou're arguing for here?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Well, if you look at section\n1307(b), upon request of the debtor the court shall\ndismiss the case, that is an absolute right. And for a\nclear reason. Nobody can force a debtor to continue in\nChapter 13 against the debtor's will because Chapter 13\nrequires the debtor to work to pay off creditors. That\nwould violate the 13th Amendment. So there would be no\ncircumstance where someone could block a debtor from\ngetting out from Chapter 13, for constitutional reasons.\nThat's a special case. That is why Congress drafted\n1307(b) the way that it did.\nContrast that with section 706 where the\ncourt said the debtor may convert. Now, there are,\nthere are requirements that the debtor has to comply in\norder to convert, statutory, but there is also, a debtor\ncannot have an absolute right to convert if it would be\npart of an abusive scheme. I think the direct analogy is\nthis Court's decision in Pepper versus Litton. There a\nfraudulent party wanted the Court to allow a claim as\npart of a fraudulent scheme, and this Court unanimously\nsaid no we're not going to allow that, even though there\nwas a subsequent remedy further on in the process.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you, if given\nthat the court has express statutory authority to\nreconvert from 13 back to 7, why should we take the leap\nof conferring inherent equitable authority to do\nsomething, when the statute addresses it in a much more\nspecific way?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Two primary reasons, Your\nHonor. The first reason is that it would be just\npointless wheel spinning.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, maybe, maybe\nnot. I mean, they convert. He comes up with a plan\nunder 13 that looks better to creditors. I mean, just\nbecause there's fraud that offends the court and prompts\nit to take action prior to conversion doesn't mean that\nthat's going to be the same situation after conversion.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But the debtor could argue in\nthe context of the motion to convert, well, I would like\nto propose a Chapter 13 plan, perhaps the misconduct\nwasn't that severe, and the court can take that into\nconsideration allowing the debtor to proceed. But where\nas here you have a clear case of abuse, the court should\nbe entitled to nip it in the bud at that particular\npoint in time. Allowing the court to senselessly say,\n\"Oh, go ahead and convert -- \"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if it might\ninjure the creditors.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Well, the court can take that\ninto account. The court is not -- is not shackled under\nsection 706 to deny conversion, it can consider various\nfactors. If all the creditors were to come up and say:\n\"We know the debtor has been abusing the bankruptcy\nsystem, but we think you should allow the conversion to\na Chapter 13 case because perhaps that will work for the\nparticular circumstances.\" But whereas here there was\nno such thing, the creditors were saying don't allow\nconversion, this is part of an abusive scheme. The\ntrustee was saying don't allow conversion, this is part\nof an abusive scheme, the bankruptcy court -- if the\ncourt had signed the order, then that affects the\nintegrity of the court.\nIs the court itself now not participating by\nallowing it to happen, this sort of fraudulent scheme?\nThe court should be able to nip it in the bud. Debtors\nwho are --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What limitations\nwould you recognize on this inherent authority to take\naction? Where do they come from?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Well I think that --\nMr. Chief Justice, I think that they're the same sorts\nof limitations that require the district court, when it\nis considering invocation of its inherent powers,\nwhether to exercise them or not, we have always sort of\nrecognized a special situation for bad faith conduct and\nclearly abusive schemes. Where those occur as in this\ncase, the bankruptcy court looks at the circumstances,\nholds a hearing as was held this case, considers the\nviews of the parties who are involved, and then decides.\nNow it is a relatively high bar. You know,\nbad faith -- it is a continuum. Where you have the\nhonest but unfortunate debtor, abides by all the rules,\nclearly no bad faith implication would apply. At\nthe other end of the spectrum where you have a debtor\nwho conceals assets, doesn't disclose, it's found out in\nbankruptcy and then as soon as the trustee finds out and\nis hot on the debtor's trail, then seeks to convert to\nget out from bankruptcy, well, there you have a\nclear-cut case of abuse that can't be tolerated.\nNow I think that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Brunstad, are you going\nto address the mootness point? Do you think the case is\nmoot?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Scalia. I think\ncandidly, the case is not moot. There is a good reason\nwhy we do not allow in our system two separate\nbankruptcy cases to be pending at the same time. Once a\nfirst bankruptcy case has started, the court\njurisdiction attaches its exclusive jurisdiction, and I\nthink the second bankruptcy case that was filed while\nthe first bankruptcy case was still pending was filed\nwithout jurisdiction and there was actually no\njurisdiction, because of the prior existing case.\nAdditionally, I think we have to recognize\nthat there were different debt levels at different\ntimes. I don't know exactly what they were, but for the\nfirst case there was debt level A. About three years\nlater, there was debt level B, which may well have been\nhigher. On remand if the debtor were to succeed, which\nI hope the Court does not allow the debtor to proceed,\nor succeed here, but on remand if it were determined\nthat with the first case the debt levels were properly\nbelow the limits under 109(e), then the debtor would be\neligible to convert as far as that criteria is\nconcerned. We do not know absolutely that that would\nnot be able to be satisfied in the existing case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did you make the\njurisdictional objection before the second bankruptcy\ncourt?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: We did not participate in the\nsecond case and make that objection, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How so?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: I think that it was\nprimarily, it was, the debtor was litigating and we did\nnot make the jurisdictional argument.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I find that extraordinary.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So it wouldn't be\nbefore the First Circuit.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: That particular issue, I\nthink the appeal of the second case is pending before\nthe district court. I think that the bankruptcy judge\ndisposed of the case pretty summarily and decided that\nwhile this particular debtor, just looking at the\nschedules, does not have the eligibility requirements\nfor the second case, and therefore dismissed it.\nThat does not necessarily preclude a finding\nupon the facts in the first case which is still pending,\nthat it could be converted. I think candidly, I need to\nsay that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's hardly a summary\ndisposition. The opinion goes on for pages and pages.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Well, this particular\nbankruptcy judge obviously had a lot of experience with\nthis particular debtor, having presided over the first\ncase as well, Justice Ginsburg. So I think the\nbankruptcy court was very fully apprised of the facts\nand circumstances surrounding the case, with the record\nand having written several opinions already in the first\nbankruptcy case which was still pending.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This case, your case?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: The current case today, yes,\nJustice Scalia.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question.\nIf the remedy of not allowing them to convert to Chapter\n13 is denied, are there other remedies that the\nbankruptcy court can impose against the debtor who\nengages in misconduct of this kind?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Stevens, but\nthey're not tailored to this particular problem or\nabuse. They are remedies, for example, the denial of\nthe discharge for concealing assets under section 727.\nBut that won't --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Are there any criminal\nsanctions?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: There might be criminal\nsanctions for willful -- basically, in essence, it's\nsort of an idea of theft, you know, by not disclosing\nassets, but it's a relatively high bar for criminality.\nBut that won't protect the creditors in the Chapter 7\ncase.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Then how are the creditors\nhurt by this series of events?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Well, the creditors are hurt\nbecause in the chapter 7 case, once the bankruptcy case\nis filed, the trustee takes possession of all the\ndebtor's property, which becomes property of the estate.\nThe trustee's role is to liquidate the property and\ndistribute the proceeds to creditors. When the case is\nconverted to Chapter 13, under 1306, the property\nrevests in the debtor, including any concealed property.\nAt that point, under section 348, upon conversion, the\nChapter 7 trustee is disenfranchised. His services\nterminate. What debtors in bankruptcy who are\nperpetuating this kind of concealment scheme want you to\ndo is say oh no, you can go ahead and convert, and then\nmaybe we'll deal with it later, because maybe later on\nin the proceedings something will happen. The Chapter\n13 trustee might not be apprised of it.\nThe case might go to a different bankruptcy\njudge. In some jurisdictions, the Chapter 13 docket is\nheard by an entirely separate bankruptcy judge. They\nwould like to get the benefit of delay in conversion,\nbecause perhaps they can get away with it in the\nsubsequent Chapter 13 case. Or alternatively in the\nChapter 13 case, if the debtor doesn't file a plan, then\nthe Chapter 13 trustee, who may have hundreds and\nhundreds of Chapter 13 cases he or she is responsible\nfor, on a check list might simply check off no plan\nfiled, case dismissed, in which case the creditors don't\nget the benefit of the liquidation, they don't get the\nbenefit of the assets being recovered, they don't get\nequality of distribution under the Chapter 7 scheme, and\nthe debtor's fraud is in essence gotten away with. So\nthat is why, when a motion to convert comes up and the\nbankruptcy court sees --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Wouldn't a Chapter 7 case\nbe refiled immediately?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Not necessarily, Your Honor.\nNot necessarily. The debtor could move to another\njurisdiction.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the creditors aren't\ngoing to let him just run away with the assets, are\nthey?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Well, Justice Stevens, in\nmany many Chapter 7 cases, in many many bankruptcy\ncases, you have creditors, most of the creditors may\nhold claims of $500, $1,000, $3,000. This case is\nunique because there happened to be a creditor, Citizens\nBank, who was owed hundreds of thousands of dollars who\nhad an interest in pursuing the case. In many other\ncases -- that's why -- one of the reasons why we have a\nChapter 7 trustee, to represent the interest of myriad small\nclaimants who collectively have no individual incentive\nto really incur all the costs to monitor the system.\nBy converting the case from 7 to 13,\ndisenfranchising that representative of all the\ncreditors, the debtor who wants to play the game of\nconcealing the assets, and catch me if you can, can in\nessence get away with it. This bankruptcy judge\nunderstood this. This bankruptcy judge denied the\nconversion so we would keep the case in Chapter 7, the\nChapter 7 trustee could do his job, collect the assets\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Could the Chapter 7\ntrustee be appointed the trustee in the Chapter 13, the\nsame trustee who has now been -- he's terminated because\nthe Chapter 7 has been converted. Could the court in\nthe Chapter 13 format appoint the same trustee?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: No, Justice Ginsburg. There\nis a standing Chapter 13 trustee in Chapter 13 cases\nthat handles all the Chapter 13 cases, unless for some\nreason that Chapter 13 trustee must recuse him or\nherself. Under section 348, once the case is converted\nfrom 7 to 13, the Chapter 7 trustee services are\nterminated.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What does the trustee do?\nHe's not really a trustee under 13, is he?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: The Chapter 13 trustee --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, the property\ndoesn't vest in him, you've told it. It remains in the\nownership of the debtor?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Scalia. The\nChapter 13 trustee is probably characterized mostly an\nadministrative person, who supervises to see that the\nChapter 13 procedures are complied with, has the debtor\nfiled the Chapter 13 plan. If not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He's called a trustee,\nthough?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Correct, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well that's really not his\ncapacity.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: In practical reality, that's\ncorrect, Justice Scalia. What the Chapter 13 trustee\ndoes is, if a plan is not filed, moves to dismiss the case.\nIf a plan is filed, may look at the plan. If the\nplan is confirmed, acts as the disbursing agent. The\ndebtor typically makes payments under the plan to the\nChapter 13 trustee. The Chapter 13 trustee then makes\ndistributions to creditors. And on Chapter 13 day in\nmany jurisdictions, one day a week or every other week,\nthe Chapter 13 trustee will come to court with hundreds\nand hundreds and hundreds of files.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's called Chapter 13 day?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: In many places it is, Your\nHonor, and they have a Chapter 13 bankruptcy judge.\nOften it's assigned to the most junior bankruptcy judge\nsitting in the particular jurisdiction. With hundreds\nand hundreds of cases, the Chapter 13 trustee has\nneither the incentive nor the resources to do the things\nthat a Chapter 7 trustee does every single day. And not\nonly that, the Chapter 13 trustee does not have the\npower to go after collecting all of the property and\nliquidating it. It's denied that power under the\nstatutory scheme.\nSo it makes no sense. It's pointless to say\nwe must -- the bankruptcy judge must idly sit by, grant\na motion that's part of this abusive scheme, allow the\ncase to be converted to Chapter 13, hold another\nhearing, have a second set of papers perhaps, only to\nsend the case back to Chapter 7.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The sense it makes\nis that that's what the statute provides, and rather\nthan relying on this alleged inherent power that\napparently is not boundless, and that the bounds of\nwhich will have to be articulated in case after case\nafter case, the statute provides a very clear mechanism\nto address the issue of fraud which allows him to\nreconvert it back to Chapter 7 promptly.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Well, I think, Mr. Chief\nJustice, in the Link case, the Court rejected that\nargument in construing section 41(b), where the Court\nsaid, quote, \"neither the permissive language of the\nrule, which merely authorizes a motion by the defendant,\nnor its policy requires us to conclude that it was the\npurpose of the rule to be abrogate the power of courts\nacting on their own initiative to clear their calendars\nof cases that have remained dormant because of the\ninaction or dilatoriness of the parties seeking relief.\"\nLikewise in Chambers, I think the same principle\napplied. The Court said, we don't need to wait and deal\nwith these subsequently occurring procedures to remedy\nthe problem. We should do it now.\nAnd that is the -- that is the clear import\nof this Court's unanimous decision in Pepper versus\nLitton. There was a remedy of equitable subordination\nfor the fraudulent claim that could have been invoked\nfar later in the proceeding. And this Court unanimously\nsaid no, you don't have to wait for that proceeding\nlater. Where it's clear that there has been fraud, the\ncreditor's scheme has been fraudulent, a fraudulent\nclaim, the court can act at the time of allowance of the\nclaim and simply deny the claim. The reason for it, I\nthink, is the reason articulated in Chambers. The\nintegrity of the court itself is implicated if it has to\nsit back idly by and watch the abusive process unfold.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I still\nhaven't gotten an answer, I think, on what the prejudice\nis. Who is prejudiced by the procedure set forth in\nthe statute? The conversion takes place. The judge\nthen says, because of this fraud, I'm going to reconvert\nit to Chapter 7. Who suffers under that? You say sit\nidly by, but I don't see the long passage of time.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Well, the creditors suffer,\nMr. Chief Justice. And they suffer because there are\nadditional administrative costs that are incurred that\ncompete with their distributions. We're already talking\nabout dividing up an inadequate pie to satisfy all\nclaims in full. Having a second set of procedures\nprejudices the creditors. It prejudices the court.\nBankruptcy judges can have thousands and thousands of\ncases on their dockets. To have to have a second set\nof procedures, a second hearing, it burdens the court\nunnecessarily. And again, it also implicates, again,\nand I think this is fundamental, the integrity of the\nprocess.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is it true or not what I\nsaid, because I don't know the area, that if in fact you\nhad a dishonest debtor, the present -- the proceeding is\ndismissed on 7. He gets the papers back. The papers\npermit him access to a hidden source of resources, and\nhe steals them basically. Is that possible or is that\nfanciful?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Breyer, that is\ncertainly possible, and I think that is why Congress has\nsaid you don't have an absolute right as a debtor under\nsection 707 to dismiss your Chapter 7 case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear from\nMs. Blatt first.\nMr. BAKER: I beg your pardon.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Blatt.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE\nSUPPORTING RESPONDENTS\nMS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nA bankruptcy court has the inherent\nauthority to sanction a debtor who has acted in bad\nfaith by denying his request to convert a Chapter 7 case\nto Chapter 13. Courts have the inherent authority to\ntake appropriate action to prevent an abuse of process.\nNothing in the Bankruptcy Code or section 706 purports\nto impair or limit the bankruptcy court's power to\npolice the integrity of its own proceedings.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why isn't the power to\nreconvert sufficient?\nMS. BLATT: The power to reconvert under\nsection 1307(c) is in this case, where the court is\nalready confronted with an adjudicated bad faith\nlitigator, it's indirect, it's inefficient, and it's\ninadequate to protect the bankruptcy process. The\npotential for abuse is very significant if the case\nlanguishes in Chapter 13 for any period of time because\nthe bad faith debtor gets control over the very asset he\nfraudulently sought to conceal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what are the\nodds that that's going to happen if you have a judge\nwho's exercised enough by the fraud to exercise inherent\nauthority to deny relief? He's not going to let it\nlanguish under Chapter 13.\nMS. BLATT: Well, he may or may not.\nBankruptcy courts have thousands of cases, and if there\nis an absolute automatic right to convert, a court with\nthousands of cases may put off that Chapter 13\nreconversion to another day. Moreover, there may be\nindividual creditors without a sufficient stake to raise\nthe issue, and the Chapter 7 trustee who typically will\nuncover the fraud cannot oppose conversion if there's a\nright to convert in bad faith, and the Chapter 13\ntrustee or the United States --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why wouldn't\nthat trustee recommend to the bankruptcy judge that he\nreconvert it to Chapter 7?\nMS. BLATT: Well, the Chapter 7 trustee is,\nhe's terminated on conversion. It doesn't raise Chapter\n13 issues. The much more likely scenario is the Chapter\n7 trustee will tell the United States trustee or the\nChapter 13 trustee, but they may or may not learn about\nit until after the case converts. In jurisdictions\nwhere there is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why can't they just have an\norder to the bankrupt -- to disclose the asset in the\nChapter 13 proceeding?\nMS. BLATT: An order to disclose the asset?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In the Chapter 13\nproceeding.\nMS. BLATT: Well, we're talking about a case\nthe court may or may not know about the fraud, and\nthe trustee may or may not tell someone in time. If\nthere's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in this case they\nknew about it, didn't they?\nMS. BLATT: Yes, and there was a basis to\noppose conversion. In jurisdictions where there's an\nabsolute right, and bad faith is not a grounds for the\nconversion --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Whenever he denies the\nmotion, he must know about it. He must have a reason to\ndeny.\nMS. BLATT: We're by hypothesis talking\nabout an absolute right to convert, and what I'm trying\nto say, in jurisdictions where there is an absolute\nright, the practice of bankruptcy courts is not to\nsimultaneously convert. It does happen on occasion, but\nthe more likely scenario is that a significant period of\ntime passes. But the other point is that if there's a\nsimultaneous conversion it's a completely pointless and\nburdensome process, and here's why: A conversion and\nsimultaneous conversion causes the termination and\nreappointment of the Chapter 7 trustee, the appointment\nand the immediate termination of the Chapter 13 trustee,\nand to the extent there's already pending Chapter 7\nproceedings for dismissal or denial of discharge, the\nconversion would appear to us to moot those proceedings\nand require their reinstatement. And this is a completely\nunnecessary waste of everyone's time and energy.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I just clear up one\ndetail that's confusing to me. The -- are there two\njudges? Does the same judge rule on both the motion to\nconvert and the motion to reconvert?\nMS. BLATT: Yes, in the majority of\njurisdictions. There are one or two jurisdictions where\nthere are different judges, but the vast majority it's\nbefore the same judge. But a -- if a -- if there's a --\nif there's a right to convert in bad faith, all you have\nis a notice of conversion and, assuming the eligibility\nis met and it hasn't previously converted, a court may\nsay, well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I wouldn't call it a\nright to convert in bad faith. If it's a right, it's a\nright to convert despite the allegation of bad faith.\nIt's not a right to convert in bad faith. No one is\narguing for that.\nMS. BLATT: Well, I think that our point is\nthat the absence of bad faith is implicit in the statute\nbecause there is this background rule. When a litigant\ncomes to a court that's already abused the court's\nprocess or seeks relief of bad faith, it is a core\nelement of a court's inherent authority to simply deny\nrelief. You can toss out an entire complaint when a\nlitigant seeks it in bad faith. If there was an\napparent benefit to this, go to 13 first or deny it, the\nUnited States trustee wouldn't be here. We see no\nbenefit to the debtor to require the court to convert\nand then reconvert. All it is is an unnecessary waste\nof everyone's time, and this is a core element of an\ninherit authority.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the idea\nthat the debtor can come in and say under 13, look,\nwhether the facts bear this out in this case or not,\nI've got a job now. I can pay off my debtors -- my\ncreditors according to this plan, and, as the statute\nrequires, the creditors get more under 13 than under\nunder 7. That's a benefit to everybody.\nMS. BLATT: Here's why. I don't think\nthere's any dispute under --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And he says, I'm\nsorry about that bad faith business.\nMS. BLATT: Sure. Right. And there's\nnothing to stop a debtor who truly converts and has\nfound religion and wants to come clean for arguing: Let\nme convert, it's in the interest of everybody if I do\nconvert. This is a discretionary right to deny relief.\nThe court is free to allow conversion.\nBut under the plain terms of section\n1370(c), the court has the power to dismiss or reconvert\na case to Chapter 7 without waiting for a plan to be\nfiled. There's no requirement that the court has to sit\nthere for 15 days and see if there's a plan. A Chapter\n7 -- excuse me --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If the statute\ndidn't provide that a Chapter 13 plan could be\nreconverted to a Chapter 7, would the court have the\ninherent equitable authority to do that?\nMS. BLATT: To reconvert to Chapter 7?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.\nMS. BLATT: I don't know if that would be an\nappropriate remedy. It might be because you can have an\ninvoluntary Chapter 7 case. But on this point about a\ncourt sitting in Chapter 13, if on day one a Chapter 13\ndebtor files a plan in bad faith, the debtor can say:\nPlease wait, I've got a plan, I'm working on it, give me\na couple extra weeks, and the court can say: No, I have\nthe authority to throw it out. And what's particularly\nodd about this proposal is that in 2005 a court is\ncategorically prohibited from allowing a Chapter 13\ndebtor to proceed under Chapter 13 if the petition is\nfiled in bad faith. The court can't confirm a plan.\nSo Congress had no interest in protecting\nbad faith debtors after 2005 and they didn't before\n2005. There's no policy preference in the code for bad\nfaith debtors or allowing a debtor either proceeding in\nChapter 13 or moving from Chapter 7 to Chapter 13, and we\nthink this is a modest exercise of a court's inherent\nauthority simply to deny relief when the court is already\nconfronted with a clear case of abuse while the case is\nin Chapter 7 or the debtor has otherwise abused the\nbankruptcy process.\nThe last thing I'd like to say is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what about the\ndifference in language under 706(a) and the other\nprovisions? 706(a) says the debtor may. The other\nprovisions call for action by the court, which suggests\nat least that the authority to convert is greater under\n706(a).\nMS. BLATT: I think section 706(a) is fairly\nread as granting a statutory right to convert absent the\ntwo statutory exceptions or the court's proper exercise\nof inherent authority. But the 706(b) and (c) just\nexplain that the court may do something or the court may\nnot, or the court shall do something. So we think our\nposition -- section 706(a) isn't even addressed to the\ncourt at all. It just gives the debtor the right to\nconvert, and it doesn't purport to limit or speak to the\nsituation when the debtor seeks that relief in bad faith\nor has otherwise abused the bankruptcy process. And I'd\njust like to end by saying that a debtor's bad faith\nconcealment of assets or misrepresentation of financial\naffairs is really the most serious abuse you can have in\na chapter 7 case. It threatens the very structural\nfoundation of the code and its integrity.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does the government have\nany position on the mootness question here?\nMS. BLATT: Well, our position is that it's\nnot moot because it's on appeal. If that decision is\naffirmed, it would in a sense practically be moot\nbecause there would be an alternative grounds and the\ndebtor wouldn't be eligible under Chapter 13 in any\nevent. But we didn't see that as necessarily an Article\nIII mootness problem.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess I've been\nassuming -- but the eligibility under Chapter 13 even\nunder the present case is a present day question, right?\nIn other words, we don't go back and see if he was\neligible for Chapter 13 when the conversion was denied?\nThe question would be whether he's eligible now?\nMS. BLATT: We have not compared the two,\nthe two chapters -- well, there was never a Chapter 13\npetition. We have not compared the Chapter 7 petition\nwith the -- after this case, this Court granted\ncertiorari, then the Chapter 13. But it is on appeal\nto the district court, so it's not presently moot.\nWe would ask for those reasons that the\nFirst Circuit's decision be affirmed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMs. Blatt.\nNow, Mr. Baker.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID G. BAKER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BAKER: Thank you, Your Honor and\nMr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. You have\ntwo minutes remaining.\nMR. BAKER: Thank you, Your Honor.\nThe first thing I would like to say is that,\nhaving been counsel to a Chapter 13 trustee many years\nago, I can assure the Court the Chapter 13 trustees\nexercise all of the powers and authority that a Chapter\n7 trustee does, with the exception, as was said, of\npossession of property of the estate. The property of\nthe estate remains vested, however, in the Chapter 13\ntrustee throughout the length of the case. It does not\nrevest in the debtor until the case is either dismissed,\na discharge is issued, and the case is closed. So the\nconcerns about leaving a debtor to do anything it wants\nto with property of the bankruptcy estate simply is not\na reality, and I think it does a disservice to the many\nfine Chapter 13 trustees that there are around the\ncountry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure I understood\nwhat you just said. You said until the plan is filed\nand approved the property remains in the possession of\nthe Chapter 13 trustee.\nMR. BAKER: No, it does not remain in her\npossession. The Chapter 13 trustee technically never\nhas possession. The title remains vested in the Chapter\n13 trustee.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So is it possible if it's\nin 13 that then the debtor, let's say a dishonest\ndebtor, could get back pieces of paper which would admit\nthat debtor to the possession of certain property which\nhe could then take and hide in a way that that couldn't\nhappen in 7? Is that possible or not possible?\nMR. BAKER: It's certainly possible. But\nthen again, there are statutory and rule-based remedies\nfor that sort of activity. And our position is that those\nrules and those statutes are what should control in the\ncase.\nThank you very much, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Baker.\n"
