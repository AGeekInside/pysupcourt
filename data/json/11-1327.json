        "content": "(11:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Case 11-1327, Evans v. Michigan.\nMr. Moran.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. MORAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. MORAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nA long and unbroken line of this Court's\nprecedents stand for the principle that a judge's final\ndetermination that a defendant is not guilty is a final\ndetermination of an acquittal for -- for double jeopardy\npurposes, even if that determination is wrong as a\nmatter of law or as a matter of fact. And even if --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do we give credence to\nhow the judge labels what the acquittal is?\nMR. MORAN: No. No. This Court must\ndetermine -- whatever its label, what has the judge\ndone. Has the judge made a determination that the\ngovernment has failed to prove its case, as in Martin\nLinen, or has the government -- has the judge made a\ndetermination of something else, as in Scott, for\nexample, pretrial delay.\nNow, the Michigan Supreme Court --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But once -- once the judge\ndetermines, quite erroneously, that it has to be a\ndwelling -- midway during the trial, I'm the judge, I\nconsider this has to be a dwelling, is there any way I\ncan make that point, make that ruling, without invoking\ndouble jeopardy?\nMR. MORAN: Well, you could reserve that\nruling to the end of the case. You could make a ruling\nas to the jury instructions without -- or what the jury\ninstructions are going to be without applying them to\nthe facts of the case; in other words, without making a\ndetermination of the defendant's guilt or innocence.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but if I persist in\nthat view, there's nothing the government can do?\nMR. MORAN: The government can try -- we\nlearned from Smith -- try to get you to reconsider that\nview before the defendant puts on his case. But once\nthe defendant -- once the judge has made a final\ndetermination that the defendant is not guilty, even on\nan erroneous view of the law, this Court has held\nmultiple times that that is a final determination --\nthat is an acquittal, for double jeopardy purposes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Because, I suppose, the\njudge is the government, too.\nMR. MORAN: Exactly. Once -- once the\ngovernment --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So whether the unfairness\nadheres in the prosecution or in the judge, the guy's\nbeen treated unfairly.\nMR. MORAN: If a state chooses,\nJustice Scalia, to vest acquittal power in its judges,\nit must accept the double jeopardy consequences of that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Even when the defendant\ninterjected this issue and the defendant urged the judge\nto make this incorrect notion that you have to negate\nthe higher crime, in order to convict of the lesser\ncrime, it was the defendant that led the -- the trial\njudge into error. The trial judge didn't come up with\nthis on his own.\nMR. MORAN: The judge came up with this,\nYour Honor, on defendant's motion, that's correct. But\nit was actually supported by the jury instructions that\nwere in use. And actually, it was supported by the\nstructure of the statute in question. The statute in\nquestion, under which Mr. Evans was charged, explicitly\nsaid that the building other than one specified in the\npreceding subsection --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you're not arguing\nthat that was the correct charge that --\nMR. MORAN: No. We're precluded now from\narguing that that's correct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you don't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel often encourage\njudges to do the wrong thing. In fact, in every case,\nthere is one of the two counsel urging the court to do\nthe wrong thing; right?\nMR. MORAN: Yes, Justice Scalia. And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's what the adversary\nsystem consists of.\nMR. MORAN: Yes. And in Sanabria, this\nCourt noted that point exactly, that all acquittals,\nwhether they're by the judge or by the jury -- or I\nshould say almost all acquittals, some are sua sponte --\nalmost all acquittals, whether by judge or by jury, are\nupon invitation of defense counsel.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- could a state\nprovide a procedure where, if a judge makes a critical\nruling mid-trial, that at the request of the opposing\ncounsel, jury proceedings are suspended for 48 hours,\nand the aggrieved party can run to the court of appeals\nto get a mandate?\nMR. MORAN: I don't think the state could do\nthat, Justice Kennedy, because of Smalis.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Because of?\nMR. MORAN: Because of Smalis. So that was\nessentially the situation in Smalis. You had a bench\ntrial. The judge grants a demurrer. He says the\nevidence is insufficient. And then the prosecution\nattempted to run to the Pennsylvania appellate court.\nAnd this Court said it couldn't do that because that was\na final determination. I think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in my hypothetical,\nthe state said -- and this isn't a final determination;\nthe ruling doesn't become final until you have 48 hours\nand go to the court of appeals.\nMR. MORAN: Well, I think a state could\nmake -- could -- investing acquittal power in judges\ncould put limitations on that acquittal power.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How would they do that?\nI'd like to go back to Justice Kennedy's question. It's\neasy when you have a jury because what happens is a\njudge can decide whether, at the end of the\nprosecution's case, he's going to dismiss for\ninsufficiency, or he can give it to the jury, and if the\njury renders a verdict, set it aside.\nJeopardy attaches only if the judge\ndismisses the case after the prosecution's judgment, but\nnot if he sets aside the verdict, correct?\nMR. MORAN: Well, jeopardy attaches both\nways, but a retry -- a reversal is possible in the -- in\nthe latter.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In the latter.\nMR. MORAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what can a state\ndo -- some have done something -- to ensure that, even\nif jeopardy has attached, that there can be a valid\nreversal; if the judge is wrong on a legal theory.\nMR. MORAN: Well, the easy --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So give us an example of\nwhat, in a judge trial, a state could do to ensure that\na legally wrong judgment is still reversible.\nMR. MORAN: In a bench trial, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In a bench trial. What\ncould it do?\nMR. MORAN: I think if -- if in a bench\ntrial, if the judge has the power to acquit or convict\nand the judge acquits, I believe the Double Jeopardy\nClause would preclude the state from coming up with a\nclever mechanism allowing -- for allowing appellate\nreview. The Court, of course -- I mean, the state\ncould, of course --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought there were, in\nyour briefs, some examples -- in someone's brief, there\nwere some examples --\nMR. MORAN: In a jury trial with a judge --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, forget about a jury\ntrial. Let's go to the bench trial.\nMR. MORAN: I don't know what --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're not helping your\nargument by saying there's nothing a state could ever\ndo.\nMR. MORAN: Well, they could withdraw the\npower of judges to grant acquittals or convictions in\nthe first place. In other words, they could abolish\nbench trials, which, as the Court noted --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you know something,\nCounselor? You're sinking your hole deeper. You're not\nhelping yourself in this argument because how does that\nhelp the system?\nMR. MORAN: Well, with all respect, Your\nHonor, the Double Jeopardy Clause here transcends the\nstate's --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't disagree. You\nmean no state could ever say to a judge, given --\ngiven -- render a verdict on the prosecution's theory,\nand then set it aside? If you think the theory is not\nlegally --\nMR. MORAN: After Smith, it's clear that\nimmediate reconsideration is a possibility. And if a\nstate set up a system, as in Lydon v. Municipal Court,\nwhere you have essentially a magistrate making a\npreliminary determination, and then it goes to a higher\njudge who goes trial de novo, that, of course, is\npermissible.\nBut if the judge is the final arbiter -- in\nother words, if the judge sits in the place of the jury,\nthis Court has said, over and over again, that a judge\nverdict is equivalent to a jury verdict, for purposes of\nDouble Jeopardy.\nSo, yes, courts -- a state could set up\nsystems, in which judges have less power than a jury\ndoes. I'm not aware of any state that's done that. I\nam aware of what Nevada has done, which has said that\njudges can't grant mid-trial directed verdicts. And\nthat's the way in a jury trial.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You keep saying,\n\"mid-trial.\"\nMR. MORAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What -- what is not\nmid-trial? Some states require a judge to wait.\nMR. MORAN: Yes. Yes. Nevada.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, what happens in\nthose states?\nMR. MORAN: Well, in that case, then there\nis no problem because, if the judge makes a\ndetermination after the jury verdict, then the -- then\nthat can be appealed under Wilson.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I keep talking, not\nabout jury verdicts, but about bench trials. I want to\nfocus on the bench trial process.\nMR. MORAN: If -- but if the judge at the\nend of a trial renders a solemn, formal, final verdict,\n\"I find the defendant not guilty,\" in a bench trial, I\ndon't see a mechanism for -- for the state to appeal\nthat determination, consistent with the Double Jeopardy\nguarantee, unless the state has set up a system as in\nLydon -- as Massachusetts did in Lydon. But short of\nthat, a judge's determination is entitled to the same\nrespect.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If, in the middle of a\ntrial, a judge grants a mistrial and says -- I'm sorry,\ngrants an acquittal and says, I think that prompt\nprosecution is an element of the offense, and there\nwasn't prompt prosecution here. Now, could there be a\nre-prosecution in that situation?\nMR. MORAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Even though the judge says\nhe thinks that that's an element of the offense?\nMR. MORAN: Because no part of my argument\ndepends upon the judge's labeling. What the judge has\ndone in that case is -- is a mid-trial dismissal that he\ncalled an acquittal, but it was actually a dismissal for\nanother purpose. That's exactly what Scott was talking\nabout. And that is like Scott, where the judge may have\ncharacterized what he had done as acquitting the\ndefendant, but he --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, he saw a phantom\nelement, and -- and that's what happened here, too,\nisn't it?\nMR. MORAN: Well, pretrial delay is not an\nelement of the offense. Pretrial delay is another part\nof criminal procedure in this state.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And this -- and the fact\nthat this was not a dwelling wasn't an element of the\noffense, either.\nMR. MORAN: But it is clearly related to the\noffense. And then Scott clarified what Martin Linen\nmeant. Martin Linen was an attempt to distinguish\nbetween cases in which the judge makes a ruling relating\nto guilt or innocence and a ruling designed to serve\nsome other purpose.\nThe problem with the line the Michigan\nSupreme Court drew here is that it is completely\nimpossible to administer. And if I can give a couple of\nexamples, the Lynch case, from the Second Circuit, was\nan effort by one circuit to attempt to administer -- to\nfollow the Maker line, and you get questions that are\ncompletely unanswerable in that case.\nIs bad intent simply a gloss on the\nwillfulness element? In which case, all you've done is\nmisconstrue an existing element. Or is it, as the\ndissent claimed in Lynch, a -- a new element? And these\nare questions like how many angels can dance on the head\nof a pin. They're simply semantics. It's all labeling.\nThere is no -- there is no substance there.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, there -- that's a\nproblem. But you're -- to come back to my earlier\nquestion, your -- what is your answer? Your answer is\nthat, if the judge grants an acquittal based on the\nfailure to prove anything that the judge thinks the\nprosecution has to prove, that's an acquittal. Is that\nfair?\nMR. MORAN: Yes. And -- and I fall back to\nthis Court's footnote in Scott, that courts are\nperfectly capable of distinguishing between rulings\nrelating to guilt and innocence and rulings designed to\nserve other purposes. So if you have a devious judge\nwho's determined to package a prosecutorial misconduct\nruling as an acquittal, I have no doubt that an\nappellate court would be able to -- to smoke that out.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, to come back to the\nargument we just heard, so suppose the judge grants a\nmistrial for failure to prove an action within the\nstatute of limitations, even though no statute of\nlimitations defense was raised. Would that be -- would\nthat be an acquittal?\nMR. MORAN: Only -- I think my answer to\nthat would depend on how you rule in the prior case,\ndepending on whether the statute of limitations is -- is\nsomething the prosecution has to prove in order to\nestablish guilt.\nJUSTICE ALITO: All right. Assuming, for\nthe sake of argument, that it's not an element -- it's\nnot really an element, but the judge thinks it's an\nelement.\nMR. MORAN: Well, if it -- if it's something\nthat could result in an acquittal, if it is -- if the\ndefendant raising the statute of limitations is\nsomething that could result in an acquittal -- because I\ncome to Burks, where Burks says an affirmative insanity\ndefense, the prosecution fails to disprove that, that is\nan acquittal -- when the appellate court concluded that\nthere was failure to disprove the affirmative insanity\ndefense.\nThat shows that that language in Martin\nLinen can't be taken as if it was construing the terms\nof an easement. You have to look at what was Martin\nLinen getting at. And Martin Linen is trying to\nidentify those rulings relating to guilt or innocence,\nwhich include affirmative defenses or --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure I understand\nthe rationale for your answer to your own hypothetical.\nThe judge characterizes a prosecutorial -- or a\nmisconduct incident as a grounds for acquittal; it\nreally isn't. Then you said the court of appeals could\nstraighten that out?\nMR. MORAN: Yes. That's Scott.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: On what rationale -- so\nwhat's the general principle that allows the court of\nappeals to do this sometimes and not others?\nMR. MORAN: If the judge has made a ruling\ngoing to the defendant's guilt or innocence and finding\nthat, as in Martin, examining the government's evidence\nand finding that they have failed to prove the\ndefendant's guilt, final. There can be no appeal. But\nif the judge has made a ruling that is designed to serve\nsome other purpose, so if the judge, in my hypothetical,\nwere to say --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, I thought -- I thought\nit was the judge just subjectively does this, but he\ndoesn't say any -- he just characterizes it as an\nacquittal?\nMR. MORAN: That's -- that's a case,\nactually, quite a bit like some of the cases, and it\ndemonstrates the problem of -- of the Michigan Supreme\nCourt's line. So example, in Martin Linen, all the\njudge said is, this is one of the weakest cases I've\never seen.\nPresumably, if the Respondent were to win,\nthey would be entitled to appeal a determination like\nthat to at least try to convince the appellate court\nthat the reason the case seems so weak to the trial\njudge was that the trial judge had added an extra\nelement.\nSame thing in Smalis, where the judge simply\nsaid -- he granted a demurrer by looking at the\nprosecution's case and saying that, I find the evidence\ninsufficient. And, in fact, in Smalis, the --\nPennsylvania tried to argue that the judge had actually\nheightened the burden for mens rea for third-degree\nmurder.\nAnd -- and so -- you know, they would be\nentitled to make these arguments. And so then we get\ninto questions of, in granting acquittals, would judges\nhave to explain all of the elements --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I see the problem, but I am\nstill back to where Justice Kennedy was -- and that is\nmy own failing here. I didn't quite understand. I\nthought, when you grant a dismissal and you dismiss the\ncase in the middle of the trial because the prosecution\nwas brought too late, all you're doing is, in the middle\nof the trial, granting something you should have granted\nin the first place before you impaneled the jury.\nBut I thought that, in Fong Foo, Judge\nWyzanski had dismissed the case after empanelment\nbecause he wrongly thought that the U.S. attorney had\nbeen talking to a witness or a juror or something at\nlunch time and that he had -- and that's an acquittal.\nAnd I thought Justice Harlan, for the Court, wrote\nDouble Jeopardy, Jeopardy attached, you can't try him\nagain. And I didn't think the Court ever overruled\nthat. That -- what -- in where?\nMR. MORAN: Fong -- Fong Foo has not been\nexplicitly overruled, but I think it has been limited by\nScott.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So Scott says that even in\njudge-wise -- Scott says Fong Foo was wrong, that that\n-- because the reason that Charlie Wyzanski dismissed it\nis he has this idea of a -- the AUSA doing something\nimproper at lunch. And -- and that's -- that's -- now,\non your theory -- on the theory you just enunciated,\nthere would -- there would -- Double Jeopardy wouldn't\nprotect against the second indictment, right?\nMR. MORAN: Well, Justice Breyer, Fong Foo\nactually listed two reasons why the trial judge granted\nthe directed verdict. One was prosecutorial misconduct.\nThe judge apparently thought that the prosecutor had\nbeen speaking with a witness.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. MORAN: But the second one was the total\nlack of credibility of the prosecution's witnesses.\nAnd -- and when the case came --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Yes. That's --\nMR. MORAN: When the case came to this\nCourt, the concurring Justice said, the second one is\ngood for Double Jeopardy purposes, but I would make\nclear that the prosecutorial misconduct rationale is\nnot.\nThat part -- I think that concurring opinion\nhas been effectively adopted in Scott, so that a finding\nof prosecutorial misconduct on dumping this case\nmid-trial, yes, the prosecution gets another bite at the\napple, assuming that it's done on -- on the defendant's\nmotion.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One -- one of the\nreasons we've said that underlies Double Jeopardy clause\nis to prevent overbearing conduct by the government.\nThat's not an issue here, is it? You said the\ngovernment gets one fair shot at conviction. And if\nthere has been a legal error below, they haven't had a\nfair shot.\nMR. MORAN: Mr. Chief Justice, I would\nrespectfully disagree. Mr. Evans was hauled into court\nby the state. He was acquitted, in our view, by the\njudge who is representative of the state, who was\nrelying on the standard jury instructions --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, this business\nabout the judge being a representative of the state, I'm\nnot sure how far that gets you. The government is one\nof the adversaries appearing before the judge, and the\njudge is not supposed to take the government's side. So\nhe is not really a part of the government. And it does\nseem to me that, if they had been thrown out of court\nbecause of a legal error, that's not a fair shot.\nMR. MORAN: Well, I understand that view,\nMr. Chief Justice, but it's contrary to a lot of this\nCourt's cases. I think this Court would have to review\na lot of its cases, most recently, Smith and Smalis and\nMartin Linen, all of which said that a legal error\naffects the quality of a judgment -- and Scott also\nspecifically said this, a legal error affects the\nquality of the judgment, but not it's finality for\nDouble Jeopardy purposes.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I suppose the\nquestion --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I know that --\nI'm just saying that that particular rationale for the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause is not applicable in this case.\nMR. MORAN: Well, I think it is because a\ncitizen has been brought into court, expects to go\nthrough one trial, and they are told, sir, I am finding\nyou not guilty. And then to find out later -- for the\nstate to come back later --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's looking at it\nfrom the defendant's perspective. We have said that the\ngovernment should have one fair shot at conviction. And\nit seems to me that, if they lose because of an error,\nthat's not a fair shot.\nMR. MORAN: Your Honor, I come back to the\nlanguage in Martin Linen, which talks about what the\npurpose of the Double Jeopardy Clause is, is to protect\ndefendants against continuing government oppression.\nAnd that oppression arises from the anxiety of having to\ngo through it again and again.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But isn't it -- isn't it\nhard to argue with a notion that your client has gotten\na windfall here? I mean, this is not continuing\ngovernment oppression and -- and -- you know, that's --\nthat -- that suggests a real harm on the part of your\nclient. I mean, here because of a legal error, your\nclient walks away the winner when he shouldn't have.\nMR. MORAN: Well, Your Honor, without the\nerror, the trial would have -- would have continued.\nBut I think that argument, respectfully, proves too much\nbecause there are lots of these cases in which legal\nerror was made. And so -- in Rumsey, you could say\nexactly the same thing about Mr. Rumsey.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, I think that's right.\nThis is -- this is an argument against this whole line\nof cases, that this whole line of cases essentially has\nset up a system where the real purposes of the Double\nJeopardy Clause do not apply and where defendants walk\naway with windfalls. And I guess what's your best\nargument against that proposition?\nMR. MORAN: Well, once you accept the\nequivalency of a judicial acquittal to a jury acquittal,\nyou have to accept that both actors are capable of\nerror. Both actors are human. Juries are incapable --\nare capable of making legal errors, as well as factual\nerrors. They are capable of misunderstanding the\ninstructions. In fact, they are capable of being\nmisinstructed.\nHad the judge not granted the directed\nverdict here, she presumably would have instructed the\njury the same way, and the jury would have also\nacquitted Mr. Evans for the same reason.\nAnd so to try and tease out legal and\nfactual errors, especially when -- and often, there are\nmixed questions of fact or law that are at stake here --\nI think, is a losing proposition. I think it -- I think\nthe Court has decided to draw a firm line, recognizing\nthat an acquittal is special. An acquittal is the most\nfundamental thing that can happen.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Could a system say, if\nyou have Double Jeopardy looming in -- in -- in the\ncase, then arguments like the one that the defendant\nmade and the judge bought have to be made pretrial, and\nif they are not made pretrial, they are waived. I mean,\nhere, the -- the -- the case was ongoing when the\ndefendant made this suggestion, as opposed the system\nhad built into it a requirement that defendants that are\ngoing to make this kind of plea do it pretrial.\nMR. MORAN: Justice Ginsburg, I don't think\nit would have been right for Mr. Evans to make this\nargument pretrial because it was only with the\nprosecution's proof that it became clear that what the\nprosecution was proving was that the building burned\nwas, in fact, a dwelling house and, therefore, seemed to\nbe excluded by the statutory language and especially the\ncommentary to the jury instructions from the definition\nof the offense.\nMichigan is an information state. Michigan\ndoes not require an indictment that lists every -- every\nlittle bit of the crime and all of the details. All\nMichigan requires is a very simple statement of the\ncrime and the statutory citation and, of course, who the\ndefendant is and the date and venue of the alleged\ncrime.\nAnd so here, Mr. Evans would have had no way\nof knowing in advance what the prosecution was going to\nprove. That's why this case is unlike Lee. This is --\nLee is an effective indictment. Nobody claims that Mr.\nLee was innocent and that the prosecution couldn't prove\nthe elements of the crime against Mr. Lee. The problem\nwas just that the indictment failed to allege a specific\nfact. And that --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. I'm a little\nconfused. It was charged with the crime of burning down\na dwelling, correct?\nMR. MORAN: Mr. Evans, no. He was charged\nwith burning other real property.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Of?\nMR. MORAN: Burning other real property.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And no specific statute\nwas cited?\nMR. MORAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which one?\nMR. MORAN: The -- that -- that statute, I\nhave --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The dwelling statute,\nnot the -- not the exception to the dwelling.\nMR. MORAN: It's the exception to the\ndwelling statute. It's -- it's 750.73, which is on page\n2 of the top side brief.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's what he was\ncharged with?\nMR. MORAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why did the court\ndismiss, if he was charged with burning down a house? I\nthought he was charged with burning down a dwelling, and\nthe argument was he should have been --\nMR. MORAN: No.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- charged with burning\ndown a house.\nMR. MORAN: No, he was charged with the\ncrime in 750.7 -- 750.73, which reads, in relevant part,\nthat, \"a person who willfully or maliciously burns any\nbuilding or other real property, or the contents\nthereof, other than those specified in the next\nproceeding subsection\" -- \"subsection of this chapter.\"\nAnd the next proceeding section of the chapter is about\nburning down dwelling houses.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: My only quibble is you\nhave no doubt -- the defense attorney had no doubt that\nhe burnt down a house -- that someone burnt down a\nhouse, correct?\nMR. MORAN: It was -- it was allegedly a\nvacant house. And apparently, that's why the\nprosecution charged it this way.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Got it.\nMR. MORAN: So they charged it. They're the\nones who made the choice of which statute to apply.\nThey, apparently, thought that they couldn't prove that\nit was a dwelling house, so they proved the other crime.\nAnd the thinking -- the thinking of the defense attorney\nand the thinking of the judge was that these two crimes\nwere complementary to each other; in other words, that\nthey did not overlap.\nIt was either a dwelling house or not a\ndwelling house, and then one statute or the other\napplies.\nAs a result of the ruling of the Michigan\nCourt of Appeals in this case, which is now not\ncontested, in fact, the burning -- the -- the statute\nunder which Mr. Evans was charged totally encompasses\nthe greater crime because any building is covered in the\ncrime with which Mr. Evans is charged, while only\nspecific buildings, dwelling houses, are charged in the\narson --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's a sentencing\nenhancement, is really what the argument is -- the\ndecision was.\nMR. MORAN: Well, there --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That every -- you can be\ncharged with burning down a dwelling and you can only\nget the enhancement if they prove it's a house.\nMR. MORAN: You can only get the greater\noffense.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly.\nMR. MORAN: Yes. But the -- a jury would\nhave to make that determination -- or the judge in a\nbench trial would have to make that determination beyond\na reasonable doubt.\nIf there are no further questions, I will\nreserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Baughman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY A. BAUGHMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis trial here was ended before verdict\nfrom a jury on the motion of the defendant, opposed\nvigorously by the prosecution, alleging, essentially,\nthat the crime charged contained an uncharged element on\nwhich insufficient proof had been presented for a\nrational factfinder to find guilt beyond a reasonable\ndoubt; that uncharged element being that the offense be,\nfor want of a better term, of a -- excuse me -- the\nstructure be, for want of a better term, a non-dwelling.\nWe had -- that had not been alleged. But it\nhas been conceded throughout the appellate history of\nthis case, from the Michigan Court of Appeals on, that\nthere is no such element in -- in the -- in the crime.\nThe statute that Mr. Moran mentioned, that\nrefers to the next preceding section, over three decades\nago, was held to be words of limitation; in other words,\nyou don't have to prove it's a dwelling, to prove that\nother real property -- a building or other real property\nhas been burned.\nSo in the 1970s, it was held the difference\nbetween the two statutes is the greater requires proof\nof a dwelling or a habitation; the lesser does not. The\njudge held that you have to prove the negative of the\nelement that enhances the offense, in order to prove the\nlesser offense; you have to prove it's a non-dwelling.\nAnd, again, that's been conceded to be error throughout\nthe entire appellate history here.\nAnd so the proofs were adequate -- were\nappropriate here, and the charging document was\nappropriate here. And the question becomes, on these\nfacts, does termination of the trial by the judge\nconstitute an acquittal, so that jeopardy should bar a\nsecond trial?\nThe Jeopardy Clause is aimed at prohibiting\ncertain governmental abuses that occurred historically.\nOne of them is when the government would terminate a\ntrial that was not going well, without the consent of\nthe defendant, in order to take another shot at it -- to\nbuild a better case or perhaps get a better factfinder.\nAnd the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits\nthat kind of conduct by establishing, through this\nCourt's cases, that mistrials without the consent of the\ndefendant bar retrial, that abhorrent practice is\nbarred, unless a manifest necessity is shown.\nAnd we've even extended that to the\ncircumstance that, if the judge is intending to help the\ndefendant, if he is doing something that he believes is\nin defendant's favor, if defendant has not consented,\nthen that valued right to a verdict from the tribunal\nthat he is before trumps everything.\nBut if there is consent, as there was in\nthis case -- the defendant asked the judge to terminate\nthe trial without going to this jury, so he gave up his\nvalued right to a decision by this tribunal -- if he\ndoes that, then that -- the other side of that coin is,\nthat is ordinarily outcome-determinative the other way.\nA retrial is permissible, unless the\ngovernment has achieved the first harm by the back door;\nthat is, by goading the defendant into the mistrial.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So if -- if the judge did\nthis on her own, that would have been okay? And there\nwould be Double Jeopardy attaching?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So we have to decide in\neach case whether the defendant was the initiating\nsource of the error?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: In terms of the -- whether or\nnot a judgment of acquittal was granted, yes, both the\nFederal rule and the Michigan rule provide that, on the\ndefendant's motion or on the court's own motion, the\ncourt may grant a directed verdict.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what if the\ndefendant just agrees with the judge? The judge says --\nyou know, I think this indictment is bad because you --\nyou have to show that it wasn't a dwelling place, and\nthe counsel for the Defendant says, yes, that seems like\na good -- a good idea. Is -- is that enough to --\nMR. BAUGHMAN: I think that would be enough.\nI think agreement with the judge's course of action\nwould be the judge -- would be, as in the mistrial\nsituation, would be the defendant's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, my goodness,\ndisagreement would be malpractice, wouldn't it?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Well, it -- it depends on\nwhether you really wish to get a verdict from this jury\nor whether you risk having a -- risk -- risk wanting to\nhave a retrial before a different factfinder. You may\nbe very happy with --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A bird in the hand,\ncounsel. I -- I --\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Sometimes, that bird in the\nhand can come back and bite you, when you have a second\ntrial.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Baughman, what would\nhappen if the defendant asked for improper instructions,\nreally saying exactly something like this -- you know,\nthat the jury has to find this additional element that,\nin fact, it doesn't have to find? But your theory, I\nwould think, would say that too, the government could\ntry the defendant again. After all, the government\ndidn't get its one fair shot.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: That -- that's correct. And\nthat -- that's the logic of Justice Holmes' position in\nKepner, and we don't go that far, essentially because\nthis isn't a jury case. There is a logic to that\nposition, but it is -- there's --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: You don't go that far, in\nother words, just because it doesn't happen to be this\ncase.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But do you concede that the\nlogic of your position would extend to improperly\ninstructed juries?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: It would, to a certain\nextent, but it is -- it is cut off by two facts. One is\nsimply, as -- as Justice Holmes often said, the -- the\nlife -- an ounce of -- I'm -- excuse me -- an ounce of\nlogic is often trumped by a pound of history. We have\nhistorically said that a verdict by the factfinder, by\nthe jury, terminates jeopardy, and there is no inquiry\ninto --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, we've historically\nsaid it in this context, too. I mean, the cases that\nyou are asking us to overrule go back 50 years.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Well, when I say\nhistorically, I mean back to the time of the founding,\nin terms of when the Double Jeopardy Clause was\npromulgated and adopted into the Constitution.\nFifty years is not back to when we were determining what\nit is we were protecting against when we adopted the\nclause.\nAnd as I think most of the commentators have\nnoted, there is very little explanation in Fong Foo as\nto how the Court came out where it came out, and there\nhas been very little explanation since as to how we got\nfrom the common law prohibition of a retrial after\nacquittal on the merits by a jury, to a ruling of law by\nthe judge that no jury could find guilt beyond a\nreasonable doubt being the same thing, which is where we\nare today.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You cannot necessarily --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we didn't have it, at\nthe time of the founding, any mechanism for a judge to\ndo that. I mean, this -- this is a new procedure, and\nhow it fit into the prohibition of Double Jeopardy was\ncertainly a -- an open question.\nIt's not as though this procedure existed at\nthe time of the founding or in English law before then\nand was never adequate to -- to constitute Double\nJeopardy. It's a new procedure introduced, so the\nquestion for the Court was, well -- you know, if it's\nthe judge rather than the jury that pronounces the\nacquittal, does -- does that constitute Double Jeopardy?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Well, I think you are exactly\nright. It, of course, is a new procedure. It didn't\nexist at the time of the founding. So our question then\nbecomes is this new procedure sufficiently equivalent to\nthat procedure that is historically protected, that\nit's -- that the protections that it is designed to\nguard against are served when we bar retrial in these\ncircumstances?\nAnd I think, as Justice Kagan has indicated,\nthere are many circumstances where what -- what we are\ndoing is giving the defendant a windfall while serving\nno interest that was protected by the Jeopardy Clause.\nSo if it's to be an analog, then we need to see does it\nreally closely approximate a retrial after acquittal on\nthe merits by a jury --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But the point I was making\nwas that the same windfall is received by the defendant\nthat gets an acquittal from an improperly instructed\njury.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: But -- that is true, except\nwe -- we could speculate that's -- that's true, but we\ndon't know why the jury came back the way it did. The\njury may have acquitted for an entirely different\nreason. We don't know. We don't have special verdicts,\nand we don't have any mechanism for inquiring, so we\ntreat -- you have to have a line somewhere. Jeopardy\nterminates with the jury verdict, which may have been\nmisinstructed, but we don't know why they came out the\nway they did.\nIf they --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now -- now, I take it\nyou -- you -- you agree that sometimes the\nprosecution -- I'm not saying anyone would -- but\nthey -- the defendant's acquitted by the jury so --\nbecause he doesn't find -- they don't find enough\nevidence, and so the prosecutor thinks, I think I'd like\nto try him again, and then he's acquitted again. I'd\nlike to try him again, and he's acquitted again.\nNow, substitute judge for jury, the same\nthing could happen. I mean, I don't see why not. And\nthere's no answer to that, is there? And if there's no\nanswer to that, the same bad thing could happen. Well,\nthen you're going to have to start distinguishing among\nwhich judge or jury acquittals do or do not invoke the\nproblem of the Double Jeopardy Clause.\nAnd where I'm driving is that -- that there\nis a principle, and the principle was -- it seems the\nsimplest way to put it, is where in fact the acquittal\nrests upon a judgment that there isn't enough evidence,\nthat's it. That's what we're after. And where it's\nsome procedural thing or not, maybe we aren't. Okay.\nNow, the virtue of that is it's simple, it's\nconsistent with the cases, it's been clear. And you're\nadvocating, let's go into that and change it or at least\ninterpret the cases that's consistent with it. And\nwe're saying there wasn't enough evidence, is because\nthe judge had in mind a legal point that he was wrong\nabout, then Double Jeopardy Clause doesn't work. But if\nthe judge was right, it does work. Well, except for the\nmatter of substantive evidence. Now, that way, as your\nopponent, lies a mess.\nI just went through that long thing because\nI don't want you to get -- sit down without addressing\nwhat I see as a central problem, namely, if we don't\naccept his view, it's going to be a terrible mess.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Well, let me say two things.\nOne is we don't -- we don't have the circumstance that\nexisted at the common law that the Jeopardy Clause was\ndesigned to protect against of the executive simply\nsaying, after an acquittal by the factfinder, let's try\nhim again, let's try him again, let's try him again.\nSomething has to happen in-between there,\nand that is that a court has to determine -- neutral and\ndetached arbiters have to determine that what happened\nwhen the judge granted the directed verdict of\nacquittal, as it's known in Michigan, was not that at\nall.\nThe judge actually did something different.\nAnd if the court doesn't interpose on the prosecution's\nrequest, there will be no retrial. So it's not the\nharassment and abusive practice of simply starting a new\nprosecution, we're trying to get what happened in\nthat --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, you're beginning to\nmake distinctions.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And once you make those\ndistinctions, I go back to the question I asked, which\nwas there is a distinction. The distinction is whether\nit's a procedural ground or -- and Justice Harlan's --\nit's whether there was -- \"Just talk to the U.S.\nattorney, I didn't like it,\" or \"Talk to the witness,\"\nor \"The prosecution brought too late.\"\nThe other side of it, where the clause\nattaches, is where it was done on a substantive basis,\nnot enough evidence. I said -- I don't want to repeat\nmyself, but I'm saying what he's coming up with is a\nsimple, clear rule, basically consistent with the cases,\nand why shouldn't we follow it?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Well, I think -- I think\nconsistent with the cases, and also clear, is to apply\nMartin Linen Supply by the very terms that it uses; that\nis, the resolution that we're talking about the judge\nmaking is moored to something. It's moored to the\nelements of the crime. We're talking about somebody\nbeing twice tried for the same offense. How do we\ndefine offense in the law?\nIn other Double Jeopardy cases, this Court\nhas taken an elements approach. Two -- two offenses\nare -- are different if one requires proof of an\nelement, the other does not. We look to the elements.\nAnd to direct a jury trial, this Court has been very\nactive very recently in determining how is it that we\ndetermine when somebody has a right to a jury trial on\nsome fact before punishment can be imposed? We look to\nwhat are the elements that have to be proven beyond a\nreasonable doubt.\nIf a fact is necessary to -- to -- in order\nfor punishment to be imposed, if that has to be proven,\nthen it is a matter for jury trial and it has to be\nproven beyond a reasonable doubt. So when this Court\nsaid one or more of the factual elements of the offense\nin Martin Linen Supply, I took it to mean -- and I have\nalways taken it to mean -- one or more of the factual\nelements. And we can identify what those are. We have\nto identify them in every case.\nThis is not a -- a strange process you have\nto instruct on them, determine what they are and use\nthose --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If the judge -- if the judge\nsimply misinterprets one of the elements, but doesn't\nadd a new element, you say that there would be Double\nJeopardy there, right?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that going to be a\nvery difficult line to draw?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: It can be a very difficult\nline to draw, but all tests can sometimes involve\ndifficult lines to draw. We used to have a no evidence\ntest for whether evidence was sufficient and we -- that\nwas changed in Jackson v. Virginia, to whether a\nreasonable juror could find guilt beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.\nAnd you will find a great many dissents in\ncases between appellate judges on whether or not this\ncase itself involved sufficient proof for a jury to find\nguilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The test is not always\neasily -- easily applicable. And neither was the no\nevidence test. So there might be some --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Let me give you an example.\nSuppose the -- a statute makes it a crime to burn down a\ndwelling, and the judge interprets dwelling to mean a\nbuilding that is currently lived in and, therefore, not\nincluding a vacation home. And let's assume that's an\nincorrect interpretation.\nNow, is that an incorrect interpretation?\nOr is that the addition of a new element to the statute,\nnamely, that it is a building in which people -- that's\none element, and the other is people are currently\nliving there?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: I -- I would define -- I\nwould draw the line at any time the court requires the\nprosecution to prove a fact that, under the law passed\nby the legislature, the prosecution never has to prove\nin order to make out the case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's every\nmisinterpretation. I mean, I don't know why this case\ndoesn't involve simply a misinterpretation of what the\nelements of the crime are. I mean, any\nmisinterpretation, you can -- which goes beyond the\nminimum that the -- that the statute requires, can be\nrecharacterized as adding an additional element.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Well, it does involve a -- a\nmischaracterization of what the elements were, but not\nof an element. The judge didn't here say, you can't\nprove that this is a building, unless it was a dwelling,\nyou can't prove it was real property unless it was a\ndwelling.\nThe judge said, you have -- you can prove\nthose things, and it's not enough, you also have to\nprove that it was a non-dwelling in this case.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But in several of our cases,\nwhat the court has done wrong is to make the prosecution\nprove additional facts in order to prove an element. So\nthe distinction that you're drawing is one between\nincorrectly making the prosecution prove additional\nfacts and incorrectly saying that the prosecution has to\nshow an additional element. And I guess I just don't\nunderstand that distinction.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Well, I would suggest that\nthis is an opportunity for this Court to draw the line\nat does -- does the judge require -- has the judge\nrequired the prosecution to prove something the statute\ndoesn't require to be proven, it's not one of the\nfactual elements of the offense.\nOr has the judge -- the error the judge can\nmake under Martin Linen Supply -- has the judge simply\nmisassessed the evidence? The judge has looked at it\nand said -- you know, I -- I understand all your proofs,\nI'm looking at them, and they're just not enough for a\nreasonable juror to find guilt --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, if I understand your\ntest correctly, under your test, Rumsey, Smalis, and\nSmith would all have come out differently.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: No, I don't think so. Rumsey\nis -- is a difficult case, but Rumsey is a verdict case.\nRumsey is not a directed verdict case. The judge in\nRumsey was the factfinder. Rumsey is your bench trial.\nIt's -- it's -- it's complicated because it was a\nsentencing case -- a death penalty sentencing case that\nthis Court treats the hearing the same as the trial for\nDouble Jeopardy purposes.\nBut the judge was the factfinder, and it was\nmore like a misinstructed jury. The judge himself --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you're saying that\nyour -- your approach doesn't solve the bench trial\nproblem any more than your friend's approach, right?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: A verdict is a verdict, I\nagree with Mr. Moran. When the judge on the merits\nreturns a verdict, what the judge does or the jury does\nin returning a verdict on the merits is very different\nwhen what the judge does on a judgment of acquittal.\nThe jury weighs credibility and assesses the\nweight of evidence, and the judge is prohibited from\ndoing those things -- is supposed to be by the law, in\nmaking his decision. His is the ruling of law as\ngatekeeper, that -- that we won't even reach this\ndecision.\nThe jury is expressing its opinion based on\nthe evidence. And although it can be proven that\nthey've reached a result contrary to reality, they can't\nbe right or wrong. Legally, their opinion is their\nopinion of those 12 collective people after doing\nsomething the judge isn't allowed to do.\nSo the directed verdict isn't, I don't\nthink, a perfect analog to the jury trial. But the\nbench trial issue gets very complicated because it is\npossible to do something with a bench trial that we\ndon't do with jury trials, and that is have specific\nfactfinding as to the elements. Many jurisdictions do.\nThere is, in fact, a case -- the Lynch case\nthat Mr. Moran cited, where, on rehearing en banc, the\ncourt split evenly as to whether or not the judge's\nverdict, where the judge had actually specifically found\nall of the elements -- the crime is elements A, B, and\nC, I find them; I don't find element B, so I acquit --\nthe court split five to five on rehearing en banc and\nwhether or not that judge had really announced two\nverdicts and it could be reformed -- be reformed to a\nconviction.\nAnd Justice Sotomayor was one of the members\nof the five who would have addressed the question of, is\nthat not different? The form of the language doesn't\ncontrol. Has not the judge actually entered a guilty\nverdict in that circumstance?\nThat's a very -- you know, kind of\noff-the-beaten-track kind of a situation. In a jury\ntrial, where a judge simply takes the case from the jury\non the motion of the defendant and resolves the fact\nthat the legislature has not said that one needs to be\nproven, that is not one of the constituent parts of the\ncrime, that is not something that need be proven to\nimpose punishment under the law, then he's done\nsomething very different than what the jury has done.\nAnd to reverse that and allow the\nprosecution to have one full and fair opportunity, we\nbelieve imposes no cruelty or oppression upon the\ndefendant.\nThank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Gannon.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS F. GANNON,\nFOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMR. GANNON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWe believe the Court can resolve this case\nby distinguishing between the misconstruction of an\nelement and the erroneous addition of an element to the\ncase. But if the Court's unwilling to draw that\nparticular distinction, it could also resolve the case\nby allowing the government to appeal in both of those\ninstances. This goes to the question that Justice Kagan\nwas asking near the end of my friend's argument.\nWe don't think that that would require\noverruling any of the Court's cases. We think it would\nrequire narrowing Smalis and Rumsey to their facts,\nand -- and -- but Smith would not be a problem in that\ncontext.\nRumsey is distinct for the reason that my\nfriend suggested. It was actually a case involving\nfactfindings by the judge. The Court characterized it\nas a special verdict made by the sole decisionmaker\nthere. It was not an instance like this, where the\njudge had taken the case away, as a matter of law, from\nthe jury because there wouldn't be any sufficient\nevidence. It has been cited later on in this cases, in\nparticular, in Smalis, as being about something like a\nsufficiency decision, but on its facts, that's not what\nit was.\nSmith is about a completely separate\nquestion because there is no dispute there about the\nappropriate construction of the element. The firearms\noffense there, the element in question was whether the\nbarrel length was less than 13 inches. There was a\nquestion about whether certain evidence that the firearm\nin question was a pistol was sufficient to satisfy that\nburden, but there was no doubt about what the -- what\nthe element was. It was 13 inches or less. And so it\nwasn't about misconstruing the element.\nSmalis is probably the hardest case in this\ncontext, but if you look at what actually happened in\nSmalis and what was at issue in the demurrer there, the\ndecision that the Court was reviewing was one that was\nprincipally about whether there was sufficient evidence\nof causation, which was an undisputed element of each of\nthe counts at issue there, and only in footnote 7 of the\nCourt's opinion did it address potential misconstruction\nof the element.\nAnd it was a different element. This was\nwhat my -- my friend Mr. Moran mentioned --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Let's go through this. My\nbasic question: Normally, a judge will wait till the\njury comes in and then decide, if the jury convicts him,\nwhether to set it aside. So there's no problem. So\nnow, we have the judge -- for some reason or other, this\njudge has decided to grant the motion of acquittal in\nthe middle of the case.\nNow, this is unusual, I think -- I hope.\nAnd if so, though, the judge might not think of writing\ndown his reasons. So he might just say there isn't\nenough evidence. And now, it happens that, just before\nhe did that, the defense lawyer argued to him an\nerroneous theory. All right. An added element or\nsomething or other, some kind of misconstruction of\nthis. What happens then?\nMR. GANNON: Well, I think that we -- we\nnormally expect judges to give reasons for their\ndecisions.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. But this a judge,\nafter all, who for some reason -- we don't know what --\ndecided, instead of waiting, as they normally would do,\ngrant it in the middle of the case.\nMR. GANNON: Well, in the -- in the State of\nMichigan, the rule does not permit the judge to reserve\nthe ruling on this motion.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, I see. So there are a\nlot more places --\nMS. GANNON: So -- and actually, in the vast\nmajority of states --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They do. They --\nMR. GANNON: -- that's the rule. The\nFederal rule was only changed in 1994, to allow this\ntype of --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And then this is a --\nMS. GANNON: -- decision to be reserved\nafter trial.\nJUSTICE BREYER: This has arisen a lot more\nthan -- than I think.\nAll right. Fine. Thank you.\nMS. GANNON: And in fact, in the Federal\ncontext --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And in that case, do they\nhave to write it down?\nMR. GANNON: Well, I -- I think that the\nrule in Michigan, and in the Federal Rule 29, does\nrequire the judge to make a determination of -- to\nsatisfy that -- that there's an acquittal, which would\nmean that there is no -- no sufficient evidence to -- to\nsupport a guilty --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But many states have a\ndifferent rule.\nMR. GANNON: Many -- many states --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And many states permit\nthe judge to reserve it till after the jury verdict.\nMR. GANNON: My -- my understanding is that\nmost states do not permit that. The Federal government\nonly started permitting that in 1994, and even the last\ntime the Justice Department studied this, about ten\nyears ago, it concluded that, notwithstanding the 1994\nrule amendment in the Federal rules, which came with\nadvisory committee notes, strongly encouraging judges to\nreserve these sorts of decisions precisely to preserve\nthe public's interest. So notwithstanding --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So then, in other words,\nwhen an acquittal --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Finish the sentence.\nNotwithstanding that, what?\nMR. GANNON: Notwithstanding that, in\napproximately 70 percent of the cases in which there are\nRule 29 verdicts, they are done mid-trial, even in the\nFederal system, at least in the early 2000s, is the only\ndata collection that I'm aware of.\nAnd so this -- this still is a problem. I\nthink that if -- if it looks like the decision is based\non classic insufficiency of the evidence and there is no\nargument about whether it was -- it's based on a\nmisconstruction or an erroneous addition of the\nelements, then we -- we would have to be -- we would\nlose, unless the Court's willing to overturn the broader\nline of cases in Martin Linens, Sanabria, Scott, and the\nother cases that were --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can you add to that -- your\n-- just your idea of what the empirical situation is in\nthe last 30 or 40 years? Have most U.S. prosecutors or\nprosecutors in these states thought that they could\nappeal an acquittal on the -- in the middle of the trial\non the ground that the judge made a mistake of law?\nMR. GANNON: I don't think that they -- they\nhave mostly thought that, but the Federal government\ncertainly has maintained that that -- that that is\nappropriate. In -- we think that in the Maker decision\nin the Third Circuit in 1984 recognized this.\nWe do think that there is -- my -- my friend\nMr. Moran asks the Court to conclude that any decision\nlike this, that is predicated upon a supposed erroneous\naddition of an element, could easily be recharacterized\nas a misconstruction of another element.\nAnd I think that -- that while, at some\nformal level, that -- that that might be theoretically\ntrue, in an egregious case like this, there is a\ndistinction, which is that if -- if this were an element\nof the offense that needed to be charged in the\nindictment -- at least in the Federal system, then the\nfailure to have alleged that the structure here was a\nnon-dwelling would have made the indictment invalid.\nAnd the Defendant would have been able to\nmake exactly the same legal argument he made to the\njudge here, which is to say that the prosecution has\nfailed to prove -- has failed even to allege one of the\nnecessary elements of the offense, which is that this\nstructure is not a dwelling. We know that that\nparticular --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Gannon, if we -- if\nwe adopt your rule, it -- it can't be for this case\nonly. And I -- I think this characterization,\nnonexistent element -- or a court's misconstruction of\nan element, I think, in many cases, you could do -- call\nit one or call it the other, so that -- that's a\ndifficult line to -- to adopt.\nMR. GANNON: Well, I don't think it's\ndifficult, in the sense that most -- most of the cases\nthat we are talking about don't involve this type of\nerror. The cases that this Court has decided, Rumsey,\nSmalis, and Smith, even the Petitioner doesn't\ncharacterize this case as involving additional elements.\nAnd this Court has recognized, in Lee, that\nwhen the error is one that kept the indictment from\nbeing valid because it failed to charge a relevant\nelement and the judge did not rule on that until after\njeopardy attached, the government was still entitled to\nappeal that decision, and if it were erroneous -- the\ngovernment's only going to get a chance at retrial if\nthe judge's decision was legally erroneous, then,\ntherefore, it demonstrates that there was no so-called\nacquittal on the -- on the offense charged --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, you gave us\nearlier the statistics of how many judges grant Rule 29\nmotions in trial. I think you said 76 percent. What's\nthe gross number, relative to the number of actual\nverdict decisions by juries or the judge himself?\nMR. GANNON: The only data that I have seen\nabout this is data that the Justice Department collected\nabout ten years ago. It was from the early 2000s.\nAnd -- and the conclusion there was that there were\napproximately 73 pretrial Rule 29 dismissals per year --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Out of what number?\nMS. GANNON: -- which actually is a larger\nnumber than you -- than you might at first think,\nbecause that represents about ten percent of the number\nof cases that were actually resolved by jury verdicts.\nAnd so it -- it is not uncommon.\nI mean, this particular type of error that\nwe have in this case, we think, is the most egregious\nkind, the non-existent element error, which -- which the\ngovernment had also pointed out in its amicus brief in\nSmalis, we think is the most egregious kind of error.\nIt's one that demonstrates that the court is engaging\nin -- it's usurping the province of the legislature in\nredefining the scope of the offense.\nAnd we think, under the terms of the Double\nJeopardy Clause itself, which talks about whether\nthere's been -- somebody's been subject to being twice\nin jeopardy for the same offense -- then it -- it\nmatters what the offense was.\nAnd when the judge has redefined the -- the\ncrime so extensively that the indictment literally would\nhave been invalid and could have been dismissed as not\nadequately alleging the elements of the offense, and we\nknow that that is something that the government would\nhave been able to appeal.\nWe also know that the government would be\nable to appeal if the judge had reserved decision until\nafter the jury had returned a jury -- a guilty verdict.\nWe acknowledge, as the state does, that jury\nverdicts are different. If a jury is misinstructed and\na jury returns an acquittal, that we are not quarrelling\nwith that in any way. We don't think there's any\npurchase in the Court's case law to do that. And I\nthink one of the reasons is because the jury verdict\nmight be attributable, not just to mistake or error, but\nalso to lenity or compromise.\nThere -- there are lots of reasons why we\ndon't exactly know why a jury did what it did, and why\njuries generally enter general verdicts. And that makes\nit different from what we have here. We have here an\ninstance where the court, as a matter of law, at the\ndefendant's behest, took the case away from the jury.\nWe think the fact that the defendants chose --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that important, \"at\ndefendant's behest\"?\nMR. GANNON: We do think that that's\nimportant by analogy to the Court's mistrial cases in\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause context.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you -- you're arguing\nthat this should only -- only be -- this rule should\nonly be applied when the defendant asks for it?\nMR. GANNON: Or if the defendant consents to\nit, as is the case in the mistrial cases in the Double\nJeopardy context.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Moran, you have five minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. MORAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. MORAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nResponding to Mr. Gannon's argument first, I\ndo characterize Rumsey as an additional element case.\nAnd I also characterize it as a misconstrued element\ncase. It's a perfect example of how these cases can be\nconstrued either way.\nThe judge required a contract. You can call\nthat an additional element to the aggravating\ncircumstance, or you can call it as a misconstruction of\nwhat pecuniary gain means in the first place.\nThe same here, the error here can be\nconstrued as a misconstruction of the element that the\nproperty burned has to be a building, and the judge\nsays, looking at the statute, I construe that to mean a\nparticular type of building. Or it can be, as the\nprosecution construed it, as the addition of an element.\nThere is no difference between the two\ncharacterizations.\nTurning to the -- the broader question about\nthis whole line of cases and should this Court go back\nand revisit this whole line of cases, is there really a\nproblem here? We have no amicus briefs from any states\nindicating that there's a problem. We have only the\namicus from the United States saying that there's a\nproblem.\nIs there a problem here that justifies going\nback and revisiting 50 years -- or possibly 108 years,\nall the way back to Kepner -- all of this case law? We\nsubmit not, especially since, as this Court noted just\nsix years ago in Smith, there is an easy solution if\nthere really is a problem.\nIf there really is a problem with judges\ngoing wild and granting directed verdicts mid-trial for\nno apparent reason, all that has to be done is the\nstates can fall into that, as we can say, judges can't\ndo that, or judges as an intermediate -- states as an\nintermediate step could at least give judges the power\nto reserve that decision --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Have any states done that?\nI -- I'm somewhat concerned about telling a judge that,\nif the judge's best judgment says there's insufficient\nevidence, that then it has to proceed with a trial.\nMR. MORAN: I would be, too,\nJustice Kennedy. I think it would be a mistake.\nI'm not aware of any state, since this\ndecision -- since this Court's decision in Smith -- that\nhave followed Nevada's lead. There are good reasons to\ngive judges this acquittal power, namely, preserve the\nstate's resources, preserve the jury's time, and\npresent -- and prevent the defendant from having to go\nthrough a trial that is going nowhere.\nAnd so there are good reasons why states\ndon't do this. States have apparently made the\ndecision, even after being alerted in Smith, that\nthere's something they can do about it, that the good of\ngiving judges this mid-trial directed verdict acquittal\npower outweighs the bad.\nFinally, I'd just like to respond to\nMr. Baughman's point, and it was also raised by\nMr. Gannon, about how jury verdicts are different.\nThere's something special about jury verdicts because we\ndon't always know why they granted the verdict.\nBut we have the same problem with judicial\ndirected verdicts. And we have Martin Linen, where the\njudge just says, this is the weakest case I -- I have\never seen. We have Smalis, where he just says, it's\nlegally insufficient.\nIf the Court adopts the line that the\nprosecution and -- and the Solicitor General would have\nyou adopt, you're going to have to require judges to\ngive very specific findings as to what the elements of\nthe offense are and which ones that they -- they don't\nfind. And that, itself, would require a radical\nreworking of this Court's jurisprudence.\nIf there are no further questions?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. MORAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The case is\nsubmitted.\n(Whereupon, at 12:00 p.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n50:2 54:25 27:16 50:10 applied
