        "content": "[10:06 a.m.]\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument this morning in case 06-157, Hein versus\nFreedom From Religion Foundation.\nGeneral Clement.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nIn Flast against Cohen, this Court\nrecognized narrow circumstances in which a taxpayer\ncould satisfy the requirements of Article III in\nchallenging a congressional exercise of its spending and\ntaxing authority. This court in doing so rejected the\nsuggestion of Justice Douglas that it allow all\ntaxpayers to sue in all manner of claims, as well as the\nslightly more modest suggestion of Justices Stewart and\nFortas that the Court allow taxpayer standing for all\nestablishment clause challenges.\nThis Court's subsequent cases such as Valley\nForge have made clear just how narrow the rule of Flast\nis. In order for a taxpayer to satisfy the requirements\nof Article III, the taxpayer must challenge a\ncongressional exercise of the taxing and spending\nauthority, and assert that the act of spending itself is\nwhat gives rise to the establishment clause violation.\nThe court of appeals in the decision below substantially\nexpanded the scope of taxpayer standing and in doing so,\nthe court adopted a doctrine that I think can fairly be\nonly understood as an exception to, not an application\nof normal principles of Article III standing.\nThe court did so on the rationale that there\nis much that the executive branch can do to violate\nthe establishment cause, but there is much that all\nthree branches of Government could conceivably do to\nviolate the establishment clause, and that has never\nbeen thought a sufficient reason to extend taxpayer\nstanding to all Government action, nor has it been\nthought a sufficient reason to relax the irreducible\nminimum requirements of Article III.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If I understand your\nposition correctly, if Congress enacts a program that\nfavors religion over non-religion, which is supposedly\nwhat the establishment clause prohibits, that's bad; but\nif Congress enacts a perfectly valid general program and\nthe President implements it in a fashion that favors\nreligion over non-religion, that's okay, insofar as the\nability of anybody to challenge it is concerned. Is\nthat an accurate description?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I don't think so,\nJustice Scalia. I mean, first of all --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why not?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I mean, I think that may\nbe sort of over inclusive and under inclusive.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Which is to say, it's not\na congressional program, it's a congressional spending\nstatute that is the key predicate. And then once\nthere's a congressional spending program, whether it's\nfacial challenge or an as-apply challenge that relies on\nan intervening ministerial act of the executive branch,\ntaxpayer standing will lie under this Court's precedent.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If this -- if Congress\nhad enacted this executive order that's in question\nhere, if it had been congressional legislation, would\nthere be standing?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think so,\nJustice Ginsburg, but let me just be clear. I don't\nthink it's just a matter of this executive order that's\nchallenged in this case and Congress could have enacted\nthat into statute. As I understand it, the -- what is\nreally at issue here is not the executive order. It is\nthe way that certain conferences were conducted by\nexecutive branch officials. That's what the dispute --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I had the same question as\nJustice Ginsburg, and I think was also suggested by\nJustice Scalia's question. Suppose that Congress passed\na statute that said we hereby appropriate a million\ndollars to the President to use to call religious\nconferences, and then it spelled out these conferences.\nIs there standing there?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think so,\nJustice Kennedy, because I look at this Court's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But --and I of course want\nthe answer, but then, why is that consistent with what\nyou told us at the beginning that there had to be a\nstatute?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Because there has to be\ntwo things. There has to be a statute. And then there\nhas to be an allegation that the statute creates a\nunique injury in the context of spending that affects\ntaxpayers differently than anybody -- than any other\ncitizen. And if you have a situation like your\nhypothetical statue, where you don't have any spending\nthat goes outside of the Government, then you might have\nan establishment clause problem, but it wouldn't be an\nestablishment clause problem where the nub of the\nproblem is the fact that money is spent. Because if\nthere's a problem with what's going --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you're saying if the\nGovernment, the executive, or the Congress, if the\ncongressional statute authorizes the giving of money for\nthe billing of a church, that's bad; but if it\nauthorizes -- it makes a general authorization to the\nPresident -- no. If the congressional statute says the\nGovernment will build a church, that's okay, because\nthen the money doesn't go outside the Government?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, importantly,\nJustice Scalia, it's not a matter of it being okay.\nIt's a question of whether it logically --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, as far as standing is\nconcerned.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Yeah, it logically gives\nrise to taxpayer standing. So -- and I think there is\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is your answer to\nthat? That in fact it's bad in the first situation and\nokay in the second, as far as standing is concerned?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: What I would say is in\neither case it's bad. I would say that there is\ntaxpayer standing to challenge the disbursement of funds\noutside the Government but not your horrible\nhypothetical about an internal Government church.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There is no standing for\nthe internal Government church?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Not taxpayer standing.\nAnybody who's subjected to the mass at the church\nprobably has standing as a matter of direct --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, we're not forcing\nanybody in at gunpoint. We're just building a\nGovernment church.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: With respect,\nJustice Scalia, nobody forced Van Orden to walk by the\nTen Commandments display in Texas at gunpoint, and yet\nthis Court said that he could bring an establishment\nclause challenge. So I think there would be directly\ninjured people who could challenge your sort of end of\nthe slippery slope --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But we're talking taxpayer\nstanding. And you think there is a real difference\ninsofar as whether the taxpayer is harmed between the\nCongress saying we're going to give the money to a\nreligious organization to build a church and Congress\nsaying we're going to build a church. You really think\nthere's a difference?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think there's a\ndifference in the extent to which there is a\nconceptually direct injury for the taxpayer as taxpayer.\nThe citizens are clearly injured when the Government\nsets up the church.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In both cases money is\nbeing used for a purpose that is contrary to the\nestablishment clause, according to the taxpayer.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: But with respect, in the\ncontext of the internal Government church, the fact that\nmoney is being spent to establish that church is the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Taxpayer money.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- least of your concerns.\nIt's the fact that the Government is establishing it\nthat's the principal concern.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't care whether it's\nthe least of the concerns, it's a concern. It's the\nsame establishment clause concern in both cases. Now\nyou may well be correct that there's a freedom of\nreligion clause violation in one case and not in the\nother, but as far as the establishment clause violation,\nI find it difficult to understand the difference between\nthe two.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, I\nthink it's a difference suggested by this Court's cases,\nand they do make an important distinction between the\ndistribution of money outside the Government where the\nspending itself is the injury and what this Court has\ntermed the incidental expenditure of money in the\ncontext of an executive branch activity that itself is\nalleged to violate the establishment clause.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And why should that make\nany difference if the entire theory behind it is sort of\na Madisonian theory, if not threepence from the pocket\nfor a religious purpose? If you start with the\nMadisonian view, there should be no distinction of the\ntwo cases that Justice Scalia puts.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I'm not quite sure that's\nright, Justice Souter, because I think that there's\nreally two ways the Government can establish religion.\nOne is they can do it themselves directly. And if they\ndo that, I think that the primary problem is the primary\nexecutive branch conduct in doing so. The other way\nthey can establish --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but let's talk about\nestablishing -- maybe this is what you're going to do,\nestablishing religion by spending the threepence.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Exactly. And that is\nprecisely what --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And in this case, when you\nbuild the church, you're spending the threepence whether\n-- whether a -- a Government employee is laying the\nbricks or a contract -- an outside contractor is laying\nthe bricks or a third party institution to which a grant\nhas been made is laying the bricks. It's the same\nthreepence.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: With respect in the one\nrespect it is the three pence itself that is the\nestablishment violation. It is the act of handing\nGovernment money into the coffers --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Taking the money out of the\npocket and using it for a particular purpose, and the\nmoney comes out of the pocket in each case. The purpose\nis the same in each case.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Again, I would take issue\nwith that and say the primary concern that Madison was\nfocused on was the taking of the money and then giving\nit to the outside religious entity.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would -- you've covered\nthe case where the Government itself, the executive is\nthe actor and said that's not covered by Flast. But it\nis covered -- what is covered is if the give the money\ndirectly to the religious organization.\nIf the money goes instead of to the\nGovernment -- take this case, if the conferences are run\nby a private contractor -- contractor with the\nexecutive, where would that fall?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think it might depend on\nthe nature of the claim actually. If the nature of the\nclaim --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This claim, these\nconferences are run now instead of within the executive\nbranch by various agencies, they are run by contractors,\nspecialists in conferences that have been engaged by the\nexecutive to help people make grant applications.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: But I think the better\nview, is the challenge is exactly this one, which is not\nthat there's something wrong with the recipient, but\nthat there's something wrong with what goes on at these\nconferences. Then in that context, I don't think there\nwould be -- standing --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's --that's a\nquestion on the merits. Right now we have to take the\nallegations of the complaint on the merits as -- the\nallegation is, I take it, that religious organizations\nare being favored over secular organizations; but that's\na merits question.\nYou've -- you've -- you have been clear that\nif the Government itself spends the money, then there's\nno standing. You've, you've been clear that if it gives\nthe money to the religious group, there is standing.\nNow money is going outside the Government.\nGoing outside the Government. But is not going to the\nreligious organization. Where do you fit that?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Again, I think if I\nunderstand the question, I would say that there's no\ntaxpayer standing there. And I think -- but, but and I\napologize for sort of bleeding over into the merits.\nBut with all due respect, I don't think you can really\nmeaningfully talk about the Flast nexus test without\nbleeding over a little bit into the merits, because the\nCourt did it itself in Flast. And what I would say is\nif you have a challenge where the problem is that it's\nthe very act of money going to the third party\nconference organizers that's the problem, then it really\nis a spending case, and I think the taxpayer standing\nwould logically lie.\nBut if it's really, what the concern here is\nthe primary conduct of what was done at the conferences,\nand not the fact that there's spending on the\nconferences at all, then I think it's more -- it is a\ncase there would not be taxpayer standing.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There wouldn't be\ntax -- taxpayer standing, but of course there would be\nregular Article III standing in the sense that in a\nparty claiming to be injured because they didn't get a\ngrant, and a religious organization did, and the reason\nwas religion, can bring any kind of claim they want\nunder Article III. It's just they wouldn't qualify for\nthe special exception to the general rule that there is\nno taxpayer standing for establishment clause cases.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: That's exactly right. And\nit's a very important point. Because for example, when\nthis Court recognized that the Bible reading in Doremus\ndid not give rise to taxpayer standing, that didn't stop\nthe parents who were directly injured by the same\npractice in Shemp from bringing an establishment\nclause --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- just one, one more\nquestion on this, on this line. And I won't belabor the\nhypothetical. Again there's a Federal statute for this\nconference, and the moneys go for air tickets to various\nreligious ministers and priests. Does that meet your\noutside the Government test for standing?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think there would be\ntaxpayer standing if I understand that. And I realize\nthat, you know, one could say well, that's is a fairly\nartificial distinction. But I do think that it is\nsuggested by this Court's precedents and the reason that\nit makes sense is that when you have injury -- where the\nreal injury is the spending, the fact that you're not\nsupposed to pay for plane tickets for ministers, that's\nan establishment clause injury, then it makes sense to\nsay that people that provided that money in the in the\nfirst place have a distinct injury.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But not -- but not if the\nPresident just gives the money out of a general\nappropriation, authorizing him to give money to people\nwho are helping in the programs that the Faith-Based\nInitiative was -- was designed to help?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If the President hands over\nthe money, that's okay?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Not necessarily,\nJustice Scalia, but it's important to focus on what this\ncase is about.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why, why not necessarily?\nI thought that was your -- you proposition, that it has\nto be a congressional violation not an executive.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Right. And it would\ndepend a little bit on about where the President is\ngetting the money. I think the way that we would look\nat it --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He's getting the money from\nCongress under a general, under a general appropriation.\nIf he takes this money and he says here, use it for a\nreligious purpose, that's okay?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: He --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: As far as standing is\nconcerned, he can't be sued?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: If he, if he's taking it\nfrom a general appropriation that makes no indication\nit's to go outside the Government so one could not in\nany way articulate that as an as-applied challenge to\nthe appropriations, then I suppose that there would not\nbe standing. But I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't understand. I'm\nback -- I really -- I'm surprised. And it's probably my\nfault. But that I thought -- I started where\nJustice Scalia was with his first question. I thought\nthis had something to do with whether Congress passed a\nstatute or the President acted on his own. But\nlistening to you now I think, I can't decide -- I think\nyou have a different argument.\nSuppose -- I'm just trying to understand.\nSuppose that Congress passes a law and it says it's a\nvery nice thing to commemorate the Pilgrims by building\na Government church at Plymouth Rock, where we will have\nthe regular worship in the Puritan religion. Now can a\ntaxpayer from California in your view challenge that?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I would say that that's a\nmuch harder case than this --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- but I say no. I would\nsay no, no.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why not? Because I thought\nFlast made clear that they could.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No. What Flast makes\nclear is that you can challenge a congressional statute\nthat is a taxing and spending statute. And I think to\nunderstand the circumstances in which you should give\nrise to taxpayer standing, you need two things: You\nneed a congressional statute that is an exercise of the\ntaxing and spending authority; but then you need the\nmoney to go outside the Government.\nAnd that's precisely what --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then you go to a private\ngroup?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Right. Because there's,\nagain, there's two ways --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So you're saying that if\nthe Government has the most amazing, let's -- I'm trying\nto think of something more amazing that what I just\nthought of.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: All over America, they\nbuild churches dedicated to one religion; and Congress\npasses a statute and says in every city, town, and\nhamlet, we are going to have a minister, a Government\nminister, a Government church, and dedicated to the\nproposition that this particular sect is the true sect;\nand they pass a statute like that, nobody could\nchallenge it?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Horrible hypothetical.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that what you're saying,\nthen?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I mean, I think the bottom\nline is that there would not be taxpayer standing.\nPlenty of people could probably challenge that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't know, I mean --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Probably --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- everybody else who\ndoesn't want to go just avoids it. So that they don't\nhave to do anything. They just have to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Any, presumably any\nother denomination that is not of the established church\ncould bring a challenge that they're being discriminated\nagainst, because they're favoring a particular church\nover them. Your proposition is simply that somebody --\nsomebody in Oregon can't challenge the fact that they're\nbuilding a church in Florida simply because the person\nin Florida pays taxes, right?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Exactly, and not just the\nperson in Oregon. But everybody in between Oregon and\nFlorida all have the same amount of standing. No, what\nwe're saying is plenty of people would be able to\nchallenge that. But not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Who? Who?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: As -- as the Chief Justice\nsuggested I think anybody from a different denomination\nthat said that this was discriminatory probably could\nbring a claim. I also think that anybody who walked\ninto one of those churches could bring a claim. And\nagain, this Court -- this Court --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Maybe they don't walk into\nit because it is not \"our church.\" So they don't walk\ninto it.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, we --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And moreover, they don't --\nthey don't feel it's discriminatory. It's just we're\ndoing this to commemorate the Pilgrims, and we'll give\nthe money to any group that's a Pilgrim.\n(Laughter.)\nGENERAL CLEMENT: With respect -- with\nrespect, Justice Breyer, I think you're underestimating\nthe ingenuity of plaintiffs to think that somebody that\nwalked by going to Plymouth Rock okay thinking I was\ngoing to see a nice historical exhibit, and is and to\nsee a church, wouldn't bring a -- an action. And that\nthere wouldn't be Article III standing for that\nparticular individual, not the taxpayer --\nJUSTICE ALITO: General Clement, are you --\nare arguing that these lines that you're drawing make a\nlot of sense in an abstract sense? Or are you just\narguing that this is the best that can be done that this\nis the best that can be done within the body of\nprecedent that the Court has handed down in this area?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: The latter, Justice Alito.\n(Laughter.)\nGENERAL CLEMENT: And I appreciate -- I\nappreciate the question.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why didn't you say so?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I've been trying to\nmake sense out of what you're saying.\n(Laughter.)\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, and I've been trying\nto make sense out of this Court's precedents.\n(Laughter.)\nGENERAL CLEMENT: And the best that I can do\n-- the best that I can do, when I put together Flast --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do we think have a duty to\nfollow precedents that don't make any sense?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think -- as a\nmatter of first course, the Court tries. And here -- if\nI could put the precedents on the map, though, I do\nthink they make a modicum of sense in the following way.\nYou start with Flast. Flast says that you can bring a\nchallenge to a congressional spending statute. Okay,\nfair enough. Valley Forge comes along and says that\nyou, that you don't have taxpayer standing to challenge\nan executive branch action. Now that raises a very\nobvious --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The difference was that\nit was because it was under the property clause, and\nmade a distinction between property and money.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: We are talking about\nmoney, not property?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: But Justice Ginsburg, in\nfairness, the Court could not have been more clear in\nValley Forge that there were two reasons that there\nweren't taxpayer standing there. One was there was a\nchallenge to Executive Branch action. The second was\nthat it was the property clause rather than the spending\nclause.\nNow, you could sort of take the view that\nthe third of the cases, Kendrick, overrules the first\naspect of the decision in Valley Forge. Now I think\nthat's wrong. I think the way to understand Kendrick is\nas follows: You have a decision that says you can --\nyou can challenge congressional spending, not Executive\nBranch action. That naturally poses the question what\nabout an as-applied challenge to a spending statute?\nSurely, I mean, because spending is something only the\nCongress does, and disbursement is a ministerial act\nthat only the Executive does, what do you do when\nthere's an intervening ministerial act of disbursement?\nDoes that mean that it's still an as-applied challenge\nto the spending statute? Or does --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was it just --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: That mean that it's\nExecutive Branch action?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was it just a ministerial\nact or did the Executive have discretion involved, about\nwho would receive the grant?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg,\ntwo things. One, in Bowen, there was -- there is\ncertainly always a degree of discretion. But it is\nworth noting that in Bowen as in Flast, the statute\nitself on its face made clear that money was to go to\noutside entities that were religious. In Bowen it did\nso in express terms by four times referring to religious\norganizations. In Flast it did so by saying money was\ngoing to go, or in-kind aid, rather, was to going to go\nto private schools. And that was at a time when this\nCourt roughly contemporaneously, in Lemon v Kurtzman\nthat 93 percent of the private schools were religious.\nThe both of those, the gravamen of what's the complaint,\nthat money is being spent by Congress on religious\nentities, was not within the discretion of the Executive\nBranch.\nAnd again, the way I would understand\nKendrick is simply reconciling Valley Forge and Flast\nand Cohen to preserve, not broad challenges to Executive\nBranch action, which would have overruled Valley Forge,\nbut rather to simply preserve the notion that you can\nbring an as-applied challenge to a spending statute.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you can reconcile\nValley Forge simply by saying when it's money from the\nFederal Treasury, whether it is a general appropriation\nor a specific appropriation, it is money from the\nTreasury, and that's what Flast is about. Because\nwhether it is spent by the Executive under an Executive\nprogram, which you have said can violate the\nestablishment clause as well as a congressional program.\nSo why isn't that the line to draw based on\nFlast, that it's money from the Treasury that makes the\ndifference?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, it\nis certainly not the line I would draw from reading\nthese cases side by side and together.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or to, or to put it another\nway, to put Justice Ginsburg's point another way, every\nExecutive action that involves the expenditure of\ncongressionally authorized funds is an as-applied\nchallenge to an expenditure statute. Because the only\nway the statute is applied is through executive action.\nAnd whenever the executive spends the funds improperly,\nyou have an as-applied challenge to the congressional\nstatute authorizing the funds, whether it's a general\nstatute or a -- or a single shot statute.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Scalia, I would\nhave said that no one would have conceptualized that as\nan as-applied challenge to a general appropriation\nstatute. I mean, I guess you would. But I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's a --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Even, even if you would do\nthat in another case, I don't see how you could do it in\nthis case. If you look at their complaint they don't\nidentify a single appropriation statute that they take\nissue with. Even before the Tenth -- the Seventh\nCircuit, if you look at page 10 a of the Petitioner's\nappendix --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's the essence of an\nas-applied challenge. You say the statute's okay. It\nis just what is being done under this statute that is\nbad. You don't have to identify a bad statute. You're\nsaying it is a perfectly good statute, but the President\nis -- is violating the Constitution in the way that he's\napplying it.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: With respect,\nJustice Scalia, I've never heard of an as-applied\nchallenge to a statute that doesn't identity that's\nunconstitutional as applied. And it's your right --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under that, under\nthat approach, when a U.S. Marshal executes a search and\nthere's a Fourth Amendment claim that the search is\nillegal, that's really a challenge to the appropriation\nof the Marshals Service on an as-applied basis.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: That's exactly right,\nMr. Chief Justice. And every constitutional right could\nbe sort of transmogrified into a claim that oh, that's\nan as-applied appropriations challenge, because the\nGovernment's not supposed to spend money to do unlawful\nthings.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what's wrong with just\nsaying that Flast stands for the proposition that when\nthe Government spends money in violation of the\nestablishment clause, a taxpayer -- after all, the money\ncomes from the taxpayer -- can bring a lawsuit? And the\nreason that they do that is because the establishment\nclause is an important joint part of the religion\nclauses; and there'd be no other way to bring such a\nchallenge. And sometimes it's that simple principle,\nand when we depart from that principle, say by giving\nproperty away instead of giving money away, you don't\nhave the standing. So we have a pretty clear, simple\nrule. That rule applies whether it's Congress or the\nPresident acting under congressional authority, et\ncetera, which I think is close to what the other side --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Can I just add this\nthought before you answer. And isn't that exactly what\nJustice Stewart said in his concurring opinion?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Absolutely. I mean, if\nthis Court wants to go the route of Justice Stewart,\nwhich it pointedly rejected, the majority of the Court\npointed rejected in Flast, and say, establishment clause\nchallenges, we're going to relax the normal Article III\nstandard -- now, I'm not quite sure where the Court gets\nthe authority to relax the normal Article III standards.\nBut assuming that, that would at least be --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because there is a real\ncase or controversy, because people become terribly\nupset when they see some other religion getting the\nmoney from the State for the -- for building a church,\nfor example, and that's why: There's a real\ncontroversy.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Getting upset is a\nconstitutionally adequate reason to bring a lawsuit? If\npeople get upset about spending money for purposes that\nthe Federal Government is not allowed to spend money for\nbecause of States' rights, that also would justify\nArticle III standing, wouldn't it?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I suppose under that\ntheory, and obviously the plaintiffs in Richardson and\nSchlesinger were very upset as well, and the Court said\nthat --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It is the kind of upset\nthat is a genuine injury if you look to the objectives\nof the establishment clause and possibly that kind of\ngenuine injury is not the case when you look to\nobjectives of various other clauses of the Constitution.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Breyer, let me try\nto answer in two ways if I can. One is to say that that\nway of looking at it takes you even beyond where Justice\nBrennan was in Valley Forge. Even Justice Brennan would\nhave drawn the line at what he called bestowals of\nGovernment largesse to third parties.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's what I was saying.\nI said that Flast then encapsulates that principle drawn\nout of the objectives of the establishment clause in a\nrule; and the rule is what I suggested.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, again, but he --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Based on money.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: But again, he didn't say\njust spending of money to do the Executive Branch's\neveryday operations and maybe -- and one day they go a\nlittle too far in praising religion. He said bestowal\nof Government largesse outside the Government. The\nsecond point I would make is I still don't understand\nwhere in just being upset you satisfy the irreducible\nminimum requirements of Article III, and even though\nFlast is probably the outer limit of what's an Article\nIII injury under normal principles, there is at least\nwhat Judge Leventhal in Public Citizen against Simon\ncalled conceptual directness between the injury to the\ntaxpayer and the injury that comes when tax money is\nspent outside the Government to a religious entity. He\ndifferentiated that from what happens when you have\ngeneral Executive Branch activity that's unlawful, where\nhe said there's no similar arrow between the action and\ntaxpayers as a class. It's a classic injury that's\ninflicted on everybody. It's a generalized grievance,\nwhich has never been said to satisfy Article III.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You're talking about an\nincidental expenditure as part of a regulatory program\nis quite different from looking at a discrete program.\nThe Faith-Based Initiative is a discrete program, and\none component of it is this set of conferences. This is\nnot an incidental something pursuant to a large\nregulatory program. Faith-Based Initiative is the name\nof this program.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: But Justice Ginsburg,\ntheir challenge is not that the money that's spent on\nconferences can't be spent on conferences. Their\nchallenge is that what happened at the conference is\nthere was too much promotion of religion. The fact that\nthe money was spent on the conferences is incidental to\nthe gravamen of the complaint.\nIf I may save my time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nGeneral Clement.\nMr. Pincus.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS, ESQ.\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS\nMR. PINCUS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe Government's argument here is that Flast\nneeds major surgery and, as the discussion I think in\nthe first part of the argument shows, it's proposing two\nvery substantial limitations that bear no relation to\nthe relevant establishment clause principles, the\nhistory of the clause, or the history of this Court's\ndecisions. And we think there's no basis for drawing\nthe arbitrary lines that the Government suggests. And\nmaybe I can follow up on some of the points that my\ncolleague made and that the Court made during the\nquestioning.\nFirst of all, with respect to the argument\nthat the money has to go outside the Government.\nThere's certainly nothing in this Court's cases that say\nthat and the lower courts and this Court at least in\npart have found taxpayer standing to challenge the\nsalaries paid to chaplains that are employed by the\nGovernment, and of course those would be --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's -- I\nguess that's my first question. I don't understand\nunder your theory why any taxpayer couldn't sue our\nMarshal for standing up and saying \"God save the United\nStates and this honorable Court.\" Her salary comes from\nCongress. You can trace that under your traceability\nrequirement. So any taxpayer under your theory could\nbring that lawsuit.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, I don't -- I don't think\nthat lawsuit could be brought, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nlet me explain why. We think that the limitations that\nare in this Court's opinions require the taxpayer to\nidentify a discrete and identifiable non-incidental\nexpenditure. In other words, it's not just any --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's very -- I can\nidentify it. It's the appropriations that Congress\nextends to this Court that pay the salary of the\nMarshal.\nMR. PINCUS: But, Your Honor, those\nappropriations don't do the trick, and maybe I can just\nexplain our test and explain why. The Court in Doremus\nexplained why there was standing in Everson to challenge\nthe payments for bus transportation by saying Everson\nshowed a measurable appropriation or disbursement of\nschool district funds occasioned solely by the\nactivities complained of.\nIn other words, there has to be some -- the\nviolation caused some unique expenditure. Not that the\nmoneys wouldn't have been expended, because in this\ncontext the taxpayer doesn't have to show a lower tax\nburden, but --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, Mr. Pincus --\nMR. PINCUS: -- that there was a tie between\n-- I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- there have been Federal\nspending programs declared unconstitutional under the\nestablishment clause, and can you cite any instance in\nwhich such a holding ing has caused a reduction in tax\nrates?\nMR. PINCUS: No, and this Court has said and\nthe lower courts have said that that is not the\nrequirement, because the injury here that the taxpayer\ncomplains of, as the Court said in Daimler Chrysler, is\nnot an increased tax burden. The injury is the\nexpenditure of funds in a way that violates the\nestablishment clause.\nJUSTICE ALITO: See, your traceability\neither covers every case or it covers no case. In real\nworld taxation terms, no case would ever meet the test.\nBut in, in purely conceptual terms, is any Federal money\nbeing spent, every case involving any expenditure of\nmoney, even the portion of the Marshal's salary that is\ndevoted to convening the Court in the morning, would be\nsufficient.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, respectfully, Your Honor,\nthat's not what the Court said in Doremus in describing\nEverson. It didn't say the mere fact that Some money\nbeing spent was enough. It said that there was a\nmeasurable appropriation or disbursement occasioned\nsolely by the activities complained of.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let me give you something\nmore measurable. It is easy to tell from time sheets\nand other things how much money is expended on Air Force\nOne and on security for the President when he goes to\naddress a religious organization, okay. And he urges\nthe importance of religion in American life and so\nforth. The whole trip is about religion. That's\nmeasurable. Would a taxpayer have standing to --\nMR. PINCUS: I don't think so, because, as\nthe court of appeals said, that this Court has\nidentified a second limitation, which is not incidental.\nThe money has to be central -- the money that's being\nchallenged has to be central to the violation. Just as\nyou couldn't challenge a prayer breakfast --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't understand.\nThe money -- say it again?\nMR. PINCUS: The money has to be central to\nthe violation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You mean Congress has to,\nhas to say that --\nMR. PINCUS: No. It can be -- in this case,\nfor example, the challenge is that these conferences\nwere -- the entire conference program was a program to\nfurther religion over non-religion.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what about Bowen?\nThe money wasn't central to the violation there.\nMR. PINCUS: I'm sorry, Justice Scalia?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It was, you know, a\npregnancy program and the executive added to it certain,\ncertain restrictions that were challenged as being\nreligiously based.\nMR. PINCUS: But the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And we allowed an\nas-applied challenge.\nMR. PINCUS: You did, an as-replied\nchallenge to the specific grants. But there were\nspecific grants identified and there was an as-applied\nchallenge. But the argument was --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But this is a specific\ngrant. There is money allocated to the White House\nwhich goes -- you can identify it in the budget, and\nsome of it goes to Air Force One. Some of it goes to\nthe payment of the security guards.\nMR. PINCUS: Yes, Your Honor, but the money\nthat's identified in the budget is not -- well, it's not\nthe entire Air Force one appropriation that would be\nchallenged in the kind of claim you're talking about.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It wasn't in Bowen either.\nMR. PINCUS: But it was a specific -- there\nwas a specific action that allocated a specific amount\nof money to those grantees. And the argument was those\ngrantees weren't entitled to any of that money because\nthe way they were using it violated the establishment\nclause. And so there was -- the government's own action\nby designating a specific sum of money in that grant\nidentified a specific sum of money, and the challenge\nwas to that entire expenditure as identified by the\nGovernment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I really don't think --\nthere's an identified sum of money that goes to pay the\ncosts of Air Force One, too, to buy the gas and\neverything else. There's an identified sum of money\nthat goes into the pockets of the security guards who\nprotect the President. I mean, it really doesn't make\nany sense.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, I think, I\nthink, as I say, there are two tests. One is whether\nthere's an identifiable sum. We were talking about with\nrespect to grants are the easiest case. There's another\ncase as when there's a challenge to an entire program\nthat the Government has identified as a particular\nprogram. And then the question, the second question\nthat the Court has identified in Flast, was is it\nincidental or not. Is it something that is peripheral\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Take\nJustice Breyer's Pilgrim church. Under your theory, if\nthe grant was to erect a memorial and suitable museums\nor whatever at Plymouth, Plymouth Rock, then there\nwouldn't be an identifiable sum if the Government said,\nhey, let's use some of this money to build a church?\nMR. PINCUS: If the Government then singled\nout some of that money --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The Government\nsingles it out. By that you mean the executive who's\nimplementing it, as opposed to Congress?\nMR. PINCUS: Yes. I think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do they -- in\nother words, if they spend the money are they singling\nit out? If it turns out it costs a million dollars to\nbuild the little Pilgrim church is that an identifiable\nsum singled out that would satisfy your requirement?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, I don't think the\nsingling out -- I don't think whether it's discrete and\nidentifiable depends on the amount, Your Honor. I think\nit depends on how --whether there is a way -- and this\nreally is part of both traceability and redressability.\nThere has to be a way to identify the expenditure that\nthe taxpayer is seeking to enjoin. And if there is some\nseparate Government grant for the building of a church,\nyes, if it's -- if -- if there is some religious --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it doesn't\nhave to be a grant, just that you can say it costs so\nmuch money.\nMR. PINCUS: Or a contract.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. PINCUS: If the Government let the\ncontract for the building of the church, yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or the contract hiring the\nsecurity guards who protect the President, right?\nThey're employed. That's an employment contract.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, they are, and that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And they're protecting him\nfor a religious purpose. He's going to this --\nMR. PINCUS: Well, they're protecting him\nfor a protection purpose. His trip is for a religious\npurpose. And I think our submission is that there is a\ndistinction that can be drawn there.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This is money that is\nexpended in order to enable the President to do\nsomething for a religious purpose. It wouldn't be\nexpended but for the fact that he chose to make this\nreligious trip.\nMR. PINCUS: But -- but, as with buying the\nbagels at a prayer breakfast, the cost of the bagels,\nlike the cost of the security, is not -- is not paying\nfor the center of what the violation is. And therefore\nwe think that that's the basis for a rule that rules\nthose types of expenditures out.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It wasn't, it wasn't the\ncenter in Bowen either. The center in Bowen was\nprograms for -- to combat pregnancy. And some of the\norganizations that were getting the money were placing\nconditions on it. It wasn't central to the program. It\nwas something added that the challenger said shouldn't\nhave been added.\nMR. PINCUS: But their claim was that the\nspending of this entire grant is unconstitutional\nbecause of the way the money is going to be used by the\ngrantees. It wasn't that $1.98 of the is\nunconstitutional and the other million dollars is okay.\nIt was that because of the way the grantee was using the\nmoney, the entire grant is unconstitutional. We think\nthat's a different case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I see. It would only came\nwithin your theory if there was one Secret Service agent\nwho was assigned to religious trips of the President?\nThen his entire salary could be challenged. But if it's\njust some of the salary of a Secret Service agent who\nprotects the President for all sorts of trips, that\ncan't be challenged?\nMR. PINCUS: Yes, and we think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that makes a lot of\nsense?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, it does make sense\nbecause, unlike the Government's limitations, which have\nnothing to do with the rationale of Flast or the\nunderlying threepence here of James Madison, that\ndoes -- that is a particular amount of money that the\nGovernment is spending and it's identifiable just\nbecause of religion. We think that that's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if we rule in\nyour favor, then every Government agency has to make\nsure that whatever activities they undertake are part of\na broader office? They don't set up a separate White\nHouse office. They just run it out of the White House\noffice.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, they may --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's purely -- a\npurely formalistic distinction.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, I don't think so, Your\nHonor, because I think it preserves --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that would\ndecide whether it's central or not. If you have a White\nHouse Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives,\nthen you can say it's central to it. If it's just the\nWhite House office, then the argument would be, no,\nthat's not central. They do a lot of other stuff as\nwent.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, but if there are --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the Marshall in\nboth --\nMR. PINCUS: -- if there are particular\npeople in that office for a particular, separately\ncalled out program in that office that is focused on\nfaith-based initiatives only, yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We're trying to\ndecide whether it is central. You have to decide what\nunit you're looking at before deciding whether the\nactivity is central. And you're just saying well, just\nlook at the people who are doing the offensive activity,\nand it's obviously going to be central to what they're\ndoing.\nMR. PINCUS: Your Honor, I think I haven't\nbeen clear in the test that I'm suggesting.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Pincus, I would like\nyou to go back to an answer you gave because it sounds\nto me like it wasn't right. The President needs\nprotection at all times no matter where he goes. The\nPresident may be doing something that violates the\nestablishment clause, but protection is the job, and it\ndoesn't make any difference where the President is. And\nso your answer to the question, well, suppose he had a\nspecial protector who just took care of his religious\nactivities? I would still say that it's, protection is\nthe thing. So I don't think -- I think you didn't --\nthe answer you gave isn't consistent with your theory of\nthis case.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, I think that's right, and\nI think that's because there are two steps to our\nanalysis, Justice Ginsburg. One is, is there a discrete\nand identifiable expenditure that only arises with\nrespect to religious activities.\nThe second question is, does that particular\nexpenditure, is that particular expenditure an\nincidental one? Flast said incidental expenditures\ndon't give rise to standing. And I think you're right\nin that situation, that expenditure --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But in response to\nJustice Ginsburg's point, you could have said the same\nthing about the expenditure in Bowen. That money would\nhave been spent anyway.\nMR. PINCUS: But the question --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It happened to have been\nspent badly, but it would have been spent anyway.\nMR. PINCUS: But it would have been spent\ndifferently, Your Honor, and I think that's the critical\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That was her point, that it\nwould have been spent differently. If the President\nhadn't gone to this religious event, he would have gone\nsomewhere else and the money would have been spent\ndifferently. But that didn't make the difference in\nBowen. Why should it make the difference here?\nMR. BOWEN: Well, I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The fact is it was spent\nfor a bad purpose, and that's the essential grievance of\nthe plaintiff, it seems to me.\nMR. PINCUS: We agree completely. But we\nalso agree that there are some limits that -- the Court\nhas said that every single dollar that's expended for a\nbad purpose doesn't give rise to a challenge. My\nexample, if there's a prayer breakfast and all -- the\nonly money that's spent is on the bagels, we don't\nbelieve the bagels are the basis for a taxpayer\nchallenge to the prayer breakfast.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So in fact, you have --\njust help me with one point here.\nI mean, I see that deciding what's\nincidental and what isn't incidental will be difficult.\nI guess many of these cases would end up being decided\non the merits, there is no violation on the merits, or\nmaybe sometimes there is.\nBut I'd started thinking of the question of\nstanding by thinking that there are strong feelings when\nthe Government spends money in favor of one religion and\nnot another. After all, they led to the 30 Years War.\nWe see that in other places in the world today. People\nfeel strongly. And if, in fact, they have that terribly\nstrong feeling and can't make any challenge because the\nfeelings are shared by many, then there are no cases in\nthe courts at all, and the Government can do what it\nwants without challenge.\nSo in Flast, they carved out an exception,\nand the exception was where the taxing and spending\nclauses were involved, because Madison and others said\nthis is aimed at \"Government shall not tax and spend\".\nSo that was my theory. And all we're saying is where\nthere's a big taxing and spending and it isn't\nincidental, there's standing.\nNow we're worried about the merits. Simple\nand clear. To which the response was, which has me a\nlittle worried frankly, was that, well, that was Justice\nStewart's position, or roughly speaking. But the Court\nrejected that quite clearly, and if you look at later\ncases, they reject it too. And therefore, whatever you\nmight think of it, it isn't the law. And I'm not free\nto think whatever, I have to think exactly in accordance\nwith what the cases say. So what is your response? I'd\nlike you to focus on that.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, respectfully, I think\nthat's exactly what Justice Stewart said. Justice\nStewart in his concurrence did not espouse a broader\ntheory than the one that the Court adopted in Flast.\nAnd he said he joined the judgment, the opinion of the\nCourt, and he said, I understand that to hold only that\na Federal taxpayer has standing to assert that a\nspecific expenditure of federal funds violates the\nestablishment clause of the First Amendment.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So you're saying that what\nJustice Stewart's view, insofar as it was rejected, that\nFlast suggested even broader standing, but it suggested\nat least what Justice Stewart said?\nMR. PINCUS: Yes. I think it's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that right or not?\nMR. PINCUS: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If Justice Stewart\nagreed completely with what the Court said, why did he\nwrite a separate opinion?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, in the -- sometimes\ndespite the Court's desire sometimes to have a less\nseparate opinion, sometimes justices do. And what he\nsaid here is he was just explaining his reason why he\nbelieved that Flast was distinguishable from\nFrothingham, and notes specifically that taxpayers have\na clear stake because of the threepence comment.\nJustice Fortas did say, did have a broader\ntheory, although he -- in addition, that the court did\nnot adopt -- but he also said, recognizing very similar\nlanguage to Justice Stewart, what the Court's opinion\nheld. So I think Justice Stewart's opinion is useful\nbecause he doesn't talk about Congress, he talks about\nexpenditures.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me unduly\nintrusive for the courts to tell the President that it\ncannot talk to specific groups to see if they have\ncertain talents that the Government may use to make sure\nthat all of their energies are used properly by the\nFederal Government.\nIt's almost like a speech rationale.\nAnd perhaps you would say that's just a\njudgment on the merits, but it seems to me that there's\na standing concern here, too, that we would be\nsupervising the White House and what it can say, what\nit can -- who it can talk to. And it seems to me that's\nquite intrusive from the standpoint of standing\npurposes.\nI'm not sure that this makes a standard\nthat distinguishes the case from Flast or brings it\nwithin those -- within those cases.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, we believe\nthat the incidental test, and what I've been talking\nabout in terms of what the limits are, that it has to be\na non-incidental expenditure protects against that.\nBecause if the argument is that some Government\nofficial, for part of his day met with three ministers,\nand therefore we want to challenge because Government\nshouldn't be meeting with ministers, I think it's both\nfor the reason, both because of the fact this is not an\nargument that the expenditure on the hours of the day it\ntook to have those meetings is clearly not central to\nanything.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You really want to condemn\nthe Federal courts to deciding case by case at the\ninstance of all these people who feel passionately about\nthis, case by case whether the expenditure was\nincidental or not. It doesn't seem to me an intelligent\nexpenditure of any sensible person's time.\nMR. PINCUS: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And just to add to\nthe question, before you answer, at the jurisdictional\nstage. In other words, this would be litigation over\nwhether the individual taxpayer has standing. The Court\nwould first have to determine whether the activity\nyou're challenging is incidental or not.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, I think the\nfact that there hasn't been a lot of these challenges\nthat the Government has been able to point to, indicates\nthat this may not be a big problem.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe they're\nreading Flast different than you read it. There are not\na lot of these challenges because you don't have\nstanding under Flast.\nMR. PINCUS: But the Court also said in\nAllen against Wright, you know, the absence of precise\nstandards does not leave the courts at sea in applying\nthe law of standing. Standing isn't an area, really,\nthat is susceptible to precise definitions. It seems to\nme that both because of the incidental test and the\nconcerns that Justice Kennedy articulated, if someone's\nclaim is that people in the White House have five meets\nin the course of a year that they're upset about, it\ndoes not take much at the jurisdictional --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what would\nhappen if --\nMR. PINCUS: Even if it's true -- even if\nit's true --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well then, five\nmeetings isn't enough. How many?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about 10?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 20?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I was about to ask, 20.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, our position\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We'll litigate it. We'll\nfigure out a number eventually, I'm sure.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, you know, in Allen\nagainst Wright, and Linda R.F., there are a whole series\nof cases where this Court has set up guidance, and the\nlower courts have evaluated whether the connection\nbetween the challenged conduct and the claimed injury --\nhere the expenditure -- is close enough for there to be\nstanding. And this -- the inquiry that we're suggesting\nreally isn't that different.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What would happen if when\nthis program was set up, nothing said about faith\nwhatsoever? This was just going to be a general program\nof outreach to community service organizations, but\nplaintiffs claimed that as the program was being\nadministered it was heavily favoring religious\norganizations. Would that come out the same way in your\njudgment?\nMR. PINCUS: If their challenge was that the\nentire -- the whole program essentially, as the court of\nappeals characterized the complaint here, the whole\nprogram essentially is facially neutral, but in reality\nis a preference, yes. Then it would come out the same\nway and the question would be --\nJUSTICE ALITO: It depends totally on how\nthey characterize?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, that's true in many\nstanding questions. The question is, how do you\ncharacterize the claim?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the problem here is the\nclaim, the gravamen here is the Government is doing\nstuff with money that's been taxed from me that it\nshouldn't do. I fail to see how it makes any difference\nto the people who care so passionately about this, as\nJustice Breyer suggests, whether it's just an incidental\nexpenditure or whether it's part of a targeted program.\nWe don't do that in any other area of\nconstitutional law. If someone has been subjected to an\nunreasonable search and seizure, we don't say well, you\nknow, it was just incidental. Yeah, we know you feel\nbadly about it, but this was just an incidental search\nand seizure, and you don't have standing.\nIt doesn't make any sense, given the\ngravamen that you're directing this law against, to\nestablish such a standard.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, it is a\nstandard that the Court established in Flast. It is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you also acknowledge\nwe're not here to try to make sense.\nMR. PINCUS: No. I actually think the\nCourt's precedents line up pretty neatly. I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But not neatly, I mean, in\nterms of the purposes of the thing. Are your clients\nclaiming that it would violate the establishment clause\nfor the President to go to lots and lots of prayer\nbreakfasts?\nMR. PINCUS: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. I never met anyone who\ndid, but I guess there is a legitimate concern, somebody\nmight think that, I guess. And I guess that if\npeople -- there is some tendency of the people that are\nworried, you know, there are pro ses, there are all\nkinds of people, somebody could claim that. So you want\na way to keep them out.\nMR. PINCUS: You want a way to keep them\nout --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's Justice Kennedy's\nconcern.\nMR. PINCUS: Exactly. And --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But what they're worried\nabout is will this word \"incidental\" and -- be\nsufficient to keep out the people who might somehow\ndecide they want to claim, which sounds like a frivolous\nclaim, that the President can't go to a prayer\nbreakfast. Now does the word \"incidental\" do that?\nThat's what I think --\nMR. PINCUS: Well, our submission is that it\ndoes, Your Honor, because we think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Again -- I asked\nthis before, and I think you were cut off before you had\na chance. Incidental with respect to what? All of the\nmoney for a particular meeting, a particular breakfast,\na particular whatever, is it incidental to that, or is\nit incidental to however many times the President has\nbreakfast if he goes to a prayer breakfast?\nMR. PINCUS: It's incidental to what --\nwhat's the focus of the claim? The focus of the claim\nisn't that bagels were served. The focus of the claim\nis there was prayer and that it was a religious meeting.\nIf there was -- just to think of what such a claim might\nbe. And so the expenditure that -- that's been\nidentified is the bagels, it really is pretty tangential\ncompared to the focus of what someone's complaining\nabout. And so we think that's a rational test for doing\nwhat Justice Kennedy was talking about.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So even if the\nexpenditure is very small, but to take a particular\nreligious symbol that might be offensive to some other\npeople, is that incidental because the meeting went on\nlonger and cost more than the particular religious\nsymbol?\nMR. PINCUS: No. I think there probably\nthere would be two challenges, because there would be a\nchallenge to the government's purchase of the religious\nsymbol to have at the meeting in addition to the\nmeeting, and I think then --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if it was 2\ndollars, you would say it's not incidental because it\ncovered the whole cost of purchasing the religious\nsymbol?\nMR. PINCUS: Yes, but I don't think this --\nand I think the Government agrees with this. I don't\nthink this is a test about how much. I think this is a\ntest about the relationship between the expenditure\nthat's challenged and the claim, what's alleged to be\nunlawful this complex of Government activity.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So there's no standing to\nchallenge a presidential directive which says we are\ngoing to buy bagels for all evangelistic Christian\nbreakfasts.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay? But not for any --\nMR. PINCUS: No, I think there would be\nstanding.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why would there be\nstanding?\nMR. PINCUS: Because there the challenge is\nto the discriminatory purchase. It's not about the\nprayer breakfast, it's about the idea that the\nGovernment is purchasing bagels in a religiously\ndiscriminatory way.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course. But the\npoint is that makes --\nMR. PINCUS: So there absolutely would be\nstanding.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that shows how\ntotally manipulable your incidental test is. You just\nhave to phrase your claim so that it covers\nwhatever expenditure --\nMR. PINCUS: But, Your Honor --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- is offending you.\nIt's not -- incidental doesn't protect you from\nfrivolous or insignificant claims in any way.\nMR. PINCUS: Your Honor, I think it does,\nbecause there would have to be an allegation in that\nsituation that bagels were being purchased on a\nreligious basis, and that's going to be awfully hard for\na lawyer to sign in good faith. I think the problem, if\nI may --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How does that confer\nstanding? How does that confer standing?\nMR. PINCUS: The purchase -- the idea that\nbagels are being purchased only for evangelicals and not\nfor Jewish breakfasts?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right. Right.\nMR. PINCUS: Because the Government --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Standing by Joe Doaks, not\nfrom somebody who's starting a Jewish prayer breakfast\nand says, you know, what could be worse than not buying\nbagels for a Jewish prayer breakfast.\n(Laughter.)\nWith him I could understand, he has\nstanding. But I'm just talking about one of these many\npeople who feel passionately about this just in general.\nYou walk in and say he can't do this because I'm a\ntaxpayer, and you say I'm sorry, being a taxpayer is not\nenough, we don't care how passionately you feel about\nit --\nMR. PINCUS: I don't think general passion\nis enough. I think what the Court said is there has to\nbe a tie-in, and let me say that I think what's critical\nhere is any test obviously is susceptible to\nhypotheticals, but the Government -- our test at least\nkeeps in taxpayer standing the core of what the framers\nwere worried about, which is Government expenditure of\nfunds --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Pincus, may I ask you\nthis question? Do you think your theory is consistent\nwith Valley Forge?\nMR. PINCUS: Yes, Your Honor, we do, because\nin Valley Forge, first of all, as Justice Ginsburg said,\nthe Court relied on the fact that it was a property\nclause claim. There is a passage in Valley Forge that\nrefers to executive action, but the Court in Kendrick\nwhen it talked about Valley Forge said, in\ncharacterizing that case, said executive action pursuant\nto the property clause. And we think those things are\ntied together and there's a reason why. In the\nappropriations context, there always is congressional\naction with respect to the very money that's at issue\nbecause there has to be a congressional appropriation.\nThat's not true in the property context. Congress\ndoesn't have to say, pass a statute to say, here are the\n58 property sites that we want the executive to get rid\nof.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you think the distinction\nbetween taxing, between taxing and spending and the\nproperty clause, makes any sense? Do you think James\nMadison would not be upset if the Commonwealth of\nVirginia transferred 10,000 acres to the Anglican\nChurch? That would be okay, but the threepence in\ntaxation would not?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, I think that the core of\nwhat was the concern was -- was the taking of the money\nand the using it for religious purposes. And I\nthink what the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's not the same\nmoney used. It's not the same property.\nMR. PINCUS: No, it's not the same money.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It goes into some pot of\nfungible money and it's other money used. So instead of\nusing other money, you use land. Does that make a\ndifference?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, I think that the Court\ndecided that it made a difference, and I think in terms\nof cabining, in terms of the worry that perhaps Flast is\ngoing to be overbroad and the need to have Congress\ninvolved, which I think is key -- there was no\ncongressional involvement at all in designating those\nproperties and there is in the appropriations context,\nand I think that's a key difference. But I think what's\nimportant here, and the Court's colloquy in the first\npart of the argument showed me this -- but the\nGovernment's position, the idea that it's only grants to\nthird parties -- - the Government could hire a corps of\nchaplains and send them out to civilians and to the\npopulace at large and that couldn't be challenged,\nbecause all it is is executive pay; and the Idea that\nthere's some difference between a Bowen v. Kendrick\nsituation, where the executive had tremendous discretion\nin terms of where it was going to give the money, and\nthe situation here, which is the exercise of Precisely\nthe same executive discretion, makes no sense.\nThe injury is the same. The conduct\nthat's -- that's the core of the violation is the same.\nIt's an Executive Branch decision to use funds in a way\nthat's impermissible under the establishment clause, and\nwe've been drawing the lines that the Government has\nbeen trying to draw just makes no sense, and to leave\nout, to insulate from any taxpayer challenge really huge\nswaths of conduct that is really at the very core of\nwhat Madison was concerned about.\nSo our submission is that that really makes\nno sense. There's no basis in history, for example, for\nthe Government's claim that Executive Branch decisions\nare somehow different and insulated with respect to\nspending. It's the spending of the same threepence, and\nif history indicates anything it's that concerns about\nestablishment were focused just as much on the King as\non the Parliament in terms of the history that the\nframers understood.\nAnd for the idea that the executive would be\ngiven free rein to exercise discretion with respect to\nspending and there would be no concern about the types\nof injuries that gave rise to Flast we think is just not\nright.\nIf the Court has no further questions, thank\nyou.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Pincus.\nGeneral Clement, you have three minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice. Just a few points in rebuttal.\nFirst of all, I think it's important to\nemphasize that if this Court recognizes that there is\nnot taxpayer standing, that does not mean that there\nwon't be lawsuits, that there won't be directly injured\nplaintiffs that can bring claims. Doremus and Schemp\nprove that point. But even more broadly, any time the\nestablishment clause injury takes the form of alleged\ncoercive conduct the individuals who are coerced Are\ngoing to have standing to bring the suit.\nThe second point to make clear is it's just\nnot an accurate description of this Court's cases to say\nthat the spending of appropriated funds by the executive\nis enough to give rise to taxpayer standing. The\nproperty distribution plan at issue in Valley Forge took\na tremendous amount of appropriated funds to run.\nNobody thought that was a basis for taxpayer standing.\nThe Bibles that were purchased and the salaries of the\nteachers in Doremus presumably cost at least a\nthreepence. But that was not found enough.\nNow, I think in trying to understand the\nCourt's cases you really have to focus on this word\n\"incidental.\" And I think that the colloquy in the\nsecond half of the argument shows that you can't look at\nincidental as being minimal. It doesn't mean that. It\ndoesn't mean minimal. It doesn't mean incremental. It\nis trying to distinguish an incidental expenditure of\nfunds when -- as to something where the expenditure of\nfunds is central or vital to the establishment clause\nviolation. In the context of money going to third party\nreligious entities, nobody would say that the spending\nis incidental. It's the whole violation. In the\ncontext of Bible reading or anything else the Executive\nBranch does, the fact that money went to fund the\nExecutive Branch to violate the establishment clause is\nthe least of the problems. The problem is the primary\nconduct of the Executive Branch in violating the\nestablishment clause, but that's not a spending injury.\nThe funding that goes into that is incidental. I think\nthat's the way to make sense of this Court's cases.\nIt's important to emphasize what's at issue\nhere. It's not a general challenge to the Faith-Based\nOffice. It's not a challenge to the name of the office.\nIt is a challenge to the particular offices and the\nassertion that the Executive Branch officials at the\nconferences spent too much time talking about\nfaith-based groups and not enough talking about\ncommunity-based groups. If that isn't intrusive on the\nExecutive Branch, I don't know what is.\nThe last point I would leave you with is\nthat if something has to go in this area, if you have to\nchoose between the logic of Flast and the irreducible\nminimum requirements of Article III, I think it's an\neasy choice. You don't abandon the basic requirements\nof Article III that distinguish the Judiciary from the\npolitical branches of Government.\nI think the Seventh Circuit, with all due\nrespect, lost sight of that. Its decision should be\nreversed. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, general.\n"
