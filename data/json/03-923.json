        "content": "(10:02 a.m.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We will now hear argument in\nIllinois against Caballes.\nGeneral Madigan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA MADIGAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. MADIGAN: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThis Court has made clear on several occasions,\nincluding 21 years ago in Place and 4 years ago in Edmond,\nthat a sniff by a drug-detection dog is not a Fourth\nAmendment search, and if something is neither a search nor\na seizure, then it requires no Fourth Amendment\njustification.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, we've held that it's\ncertainly not a -- a full-blown search. It's not a search\nin the classic sense, but a Terry stop isn't an arrest in\n-- in the classic sense either. We -- we have said that\nthat is a kind of seizure.\nWhy do -- I think your -- your argument assumes\nthat this for -- for purposes of search analogies that\nsomething is either a -- a full-dress search or it's not a\nsearch at all. Why isn't there a -- a possibility of --\nof a kind of middle ground on searches just as there is on\nseizures?\nMS. MADIGAN: Well, this Court made clear in\nArizona v. Hicks that it did not want to go down the road\nof creating something known as a quasi-search so that\ncourts and police officers would be in the position of\ntrying to determine whether or not something was a search\nor not.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, I -- I can -- I can just\nimagine the problems, but I mean, what -- I think what's\n-- what the -- what's bothering me about the case is that\nif we persist in -- in saying that -- that it's -- that\nit's an either and or question with no question with no\npossible gradation, then I assume nothing prevents the\npolice from taking the dogs through every municipal garage\nin the United States and I suppose there's nothing that\nprevents the police from taking the dogs up to any\nhomeowner's door, ringing the bell, and seeing if the dog\ngets a sniff of something when the door is opened. We're\n-- we're opening rather a -- a large vista for -- for dog\nintrusions, and -- and that's what's -- that's what's\nbothering me. Why -- why should we -- why should we open\nthat vista if there is a possibility of a -- of a middle\nground that would prevent it?\nMS. MADIGAN: Well, I would start with the\nreality that dog sniffs by their very nature, as this\nCourt recognized in both Place and Edmond, are very unique\nboth in terms of the manner in which the sniff is\nconducted, as well as the content of -- of the information\nthat the sniff reveals, so that a dog sniff is only going\nto be able to reveal the presence or absence of\ncontraband. And this Court has recognized that\nindividuals have no privacy interest in the possession of\ncontraband.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Does that imply that your\nanswer is yes to the question? If we say, as you urge, a\ndog sniff is not a search, then the police are free to\nparade up and down every street in the country with dogs\nsniffing car trunks.\nMS. MADIGAN: Yes. Because a sniff is not a\nsearch, a police officer would be able to take a\nnarcotics-detection dog down the street with him or her.\nI can tell you that because of the limited resources --\nand this is a point brought up in the Illinois Association\nof Chiefs of Police amicus brief -- that that is not\nlikely to occur.\nIn addition, I can also tell you that in the\nState of Illinois, the Illinois State police do not train\ntheir dogs nor do they use their dogs on people. They\nonly use them on objects.\nBut yes, in answer to both of your questions,\nbecause a dog sniff does not constitute a search, dogs\ncould be used to walk down streets. They could,\nhypothetically, be used in parking lots, and at times they\nare used in parking lots.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But they are used. I mean, we\ndon't have to make it up. From cases we've had here, we\nknow that they're used in places like bus depots to -- to\nsniff luggage that -- that passengers have carried through\non -- on buses.\nMS. MADIGAN: Yes, they are.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the republic seems to have\nsurvived.\nMS. MADIGAN: I agree.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: One could characterize those\nepisodes under the, quote, special needs doctrine. I\nmean, we are exposed to searches at airports that we would\nnot put up with walking up and down an ordinary street.\nSo the dogs at the terminals one expects nowadays.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. These aren't sniffs for --\nfor explosives. These are sniffs for drugs and -- and\nthese -- these are not buses that are coming in from\nFrance. They're coming in from one American city to\nanother. And -- and there's no more need in -- in that\ncase than there was in this case. It was just a good -- a\ngood place to find criminals who were carrying unlawful\ndrugs.\nMS. MADIGAN: In the present case, Mr. Caballes\nwas traveling from Las Vegas, Nevada apparently on his way\nto Chicago, Illinois. He was pulled over for speeding.\nAnother officer overheard when Master Sergeant Gillette\ncalled in to dispatch that he effected --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I interrupt, General\nMadigan?\nMS. MADIGAN: You may.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: He was pulled over for\nspeeding at 71 miles an hour in a 65 miles an hour zone on\nI-80. Right?\nMS. MADIGAN: Yes, that is correct, Justice\nStevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Did they know in advance that\nhe was someone to look for? Because I don't imagine you\narrest everybody on I-80 that goes 70 miles an hour. I've\ndone it many times myself is why --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Inadvertently.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Inadvertently.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. MADIGAN: We always like to have you in\nIllinois.\nObviously, the Illinois State Police have the\nability to pull somebody over whether they're going 1 mile\nover the speed limit or 26 miles over the speed limit, but\nthere is nothing in the record to indicate that they were\nlooking for Mr. Caballes as he was traveling eastbound on\nI-80 towards Chicago.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Does the record tell us what\ntime of day it was?\nMS. MADIGAN: Yes. It was approximately 5:10\np.m.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You -- you answered one of the\nearlier questions about the possible intrusiveness of dogs\neverywhere by saying, well, you don't have a privacy\ninterest in contraband, but that's never true. You don't\nhave a privacy interest in the murder victim's body, but\nyou still have to have a warrant to go in and get it. So\nthat -- that just doesn't work unless I missed something.\nMS. MADIGAN: You do not have a privacy interest\nin contraband, as this Court has recognized in the\nJacobsen case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, but you have a privacy\ninterest in your person and in your place, and that's what\nwe're talking about. So that seems to me that that just\ndoesn't help us.\nMS. MADIGAN: Well, there is a distinction\nthat's made in terms of Fourth Amendment protections that\nare given to homes and people versus cars. Ever since the\nCarroll case, it has been recognized that a warrantless\nsearch of a car can be done if they found probable cause.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's because of the\nnature of the place being searched not because of the\nnature of what you're searching for.\nMS. MADIGAN: Correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not necessarily.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So it just can't be that -- so\nthe fact that you don't have a privacy interest in\ncontraband, it doesn't seem to me -- I -- I don't think\nyou need that argument.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think you should use it.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. MADIGAN: I -- I plan on continuing to use\nit.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why do you -- are you\nsure that Kyllo, you know, the -- the imaging case, would\nhave come out the same way if the only thing -- the only\nthing -- that the imaging could pick out is not any of the\nother private activities in the home, but the only thing\nit could possibly discern is a dead body with a knife\nthrough the heart? Are you sure the case would have come\nout the same way? I'm not at all sure.\nMS. MADIGAN: I would hope the case would come\nout differently than --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, what --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you have any authority for\nthat other than Justice Scalia's speculation about how\nthis --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- how his Kyllo case might\nhave been written?\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: What about a house and -- and\nthe use of a dog to sniff around a door access or a house\njust because the police think, you know, it's possible\nthis is somebody growing marijuana in the basement or\nsomething? Is that all right?\nMS. MADIGAN: I would argue that, yes, it is all\nright to walk a dog around a house, but then as Justice --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: How do you -- how do you\nreconcile that with the heat sensor case then?\nMS. MADIGAN: The thermal imager that was used\nin the Kyllo case was able to reveal intimate details of\nthe house. A dog sniff is only going to reveal the\npresence or absence of contraband, and because of that,\nthat's where we suddenly get into the tension between\nKyllo and Place and --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What if the dogs get a little\nmore sophisticated in the future and can also smell a\ncertain kind of perfume, something like that? Would then\nthe whole analysis change?\nMS. MADIGAN: Well, then you would end up in a\nsituation as to whether or not an officer had probable\ncause when a dog, in fact, alerted. If he was alerting to\nthe presence of perfume as opposed to narcotics, there\nwould be--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: How would you know whether\nthe -- the dog -- I don't think the dog alerts, as I'm\nalerting, for one reason or another. He just alerts.\nMS. MADIGAN: Well, they're very well trained\ndogs. In fact, in the State of Illinois, the dogs and\ntheir handlers go through 320 hours of training, and\nthey're specifically trained to only alert to narcotics.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I just learned this morning\nthat some very well trained dogs that are trained to alert\nfor explosives will also alert for certain kinds of rubber\nin a tire. They didn't realize that. And I think it's\nentirely possible that dogs would -- there will be false\nalerts by -- by dogs because it's triggered by something\nthat -- that is not really anticipated.\nMS. MADIGAN: One of the things that does take\nplace during the training of these narcotics-detection\ndogs is to make sure that they are not alerting to things\nthat are not narcotics or -- I don't know exactly how the\nexplosive training is conducted because we don't train our\ndogs in Illinois for explosives, but they purposely train\nthem on narcotics not to alert to plastic wrap that is\nfrequently the container used for narcotics, not --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So you would agree the\nanalysis would be different if there could be an innocent\ncause of the alert as well as the contraband being the\ncause of the alert.\nMS. MADIGAN: It depends. The analysis would be\ndifferent if the dog was known to or had been trained to\nactually alert to the non-contraband.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or if that happened a large\npercentage of the time. I mean, surely you'd concede that\nthe search is unreasonable if, for every -- every one\ntime, you -- you make somebody open his bag because the\ndog actually smells narcotics, 99 times you make somebody\nopen his bag because he has apples in it. I mean,\nwouldn't that go to the reasonableness of --\nMS. MADIGAN: Well, it would actually go to\nwhether or not that dog provided -- that dog's alert\nprovided probable cause to conduct a search.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, do we -- we don't have\nthe probable cause question before us, do we?\nMS. MADIGAN: You do not have the probable cause\nquestion before you. This dog was determined to be\nreliable by the trial court and the Illinois Appellate\nCourt, and it was not part of the Illinois Supreme Court's\ndecision.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what again in your view is the\nbest distinction from Kyllo?\nMS. MADIGAN: Two things. One, the thermal\nimager used in Kyllo was able to reveal intimate details\nthat individuals --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Like what? I thought it was\njust heat?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMS. MADIGAN: There was some disagreement on the\nCourt about exactly what it revealed, but in terms of\nintimate details, it then allowed somebody --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Excuse me. What details? It\nis a device that measures heat.\nMS. MADIGAN: Because it could measure heat, it\ncould also potentially determine when somebody was taking\na bath, taking a sauna, and doing other intimate things in\nthe house.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I think there was a reference\nto my lady's bath in the opinion.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A nice turn of phrase, as I\nrecall.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: What was -- and what was the\nsecond?\nMS. MADIGAN: The second one would be the\ndistinction between houses and cars and the protections\nthat houses are given under the Fourth Amendment, which\nare far greater than the protections that people have in\ntheir cars.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, so you think if this\nwere a house, that the Kyllo case would apply?\nMS. MADIGAN: If this were a house in the\nsituation, it would certainly bring out the tension\nbetween Kyllo and Place --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wasn't there -- didn't Kyllo --\nwasn't what -- what the Court was worried about in Kyllo\nnot just the relatively crude heat imaging that existed in\nthe case before it, but the prospect of more and more\nsophisticated heat imaging which -- which we had evidence\nwas already in development that would enable you to see\npeople moving around a room? I thought the case referred\nto that. Now, are we going to have more and more --\nwhat's going to happen with dogs? I -- I can't imagine\nthat -- that this thing is going anywhere other than\nsmelling narcotics and smelling bombs.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but you would argue that\nthe same rationale should apply if, instead of using dogs,\nyou had some sophisticated device that would buzz or ring\na bell or something whenever the odor of -- of narcotics\nwas present, wouldn't you?\nMS. MADIGAN: I would argue that. So if there\nwas an ability to create a -- a mechanical dog, for\ninstance, we would again say that the use of a mechanical\ndog sniff would not be a search and therefore would not --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: There's nothing magical about\nthe fact that it's an animal rather than a sophisticated\ndevice. It has better detection capacity than a human\nbeing does. That's the only difference.\nMS. MADIGAN: You are correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In -- in discussing the -- the\nanswer to the -- the Kyllo issue, you've -- you place an\nemphasis on the protection given to a house. Would you go\nback to Justice O'Connor's question and my earlier\nexample? Is it still your answer that the police can walk\ndogs around the foundation of the house or take a dog to\nthe front door and ring the bell and see what it -- what\nit sniffs when the door is opened --\nMS. MADIGAN: I would --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- without there being a search\nand hence no Fourth Amendment concern?\nMS. MADIGAN: Yes, Justice Souter, I would say\nthat that is possible because the sniff itself is not a\nsearch and it only reveals the presence or absence of\ncontraband, which is something that the individual does\nnot have privacy expectations --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But then -- then the --\nthen there is no significance in the house.\nMS. MADIGAN: There is potentially significance\nin the house because the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, when does -- when does it\noccur? I mean, if -- if -- first you say the -- the house\nis -- is a matter of significance for Kyllo analysis.\nWe're trying to draw a distinction, if there is one,\nbetween Kyllo and this, and you say they can go to the\nhouse. They can sniff the foundations. They can go to\nthe front door, et cetera. I don't see that the house, in\nfact, is functioning as a distinction at all.\nMS. MADIGAN: This Court's precedents have shown\nus that in fact Fourth Amendment protections are higher in\nthe home than they are in the car.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, I realize that, but it\nseems to me your basic argument, if I understand it, is\nthere is simply no search here, and because there is no\nsearch here, it doesn't matter whether you're dealing with\na house or a parking lot or a car on the road. No search\nis no search. So for purposes of -- if I -- I want to\nunderstand your case, and as I understand it, for purposes\nof your case, there is no significance in the house\nbecause there doesn't have to be. The question doesn't\narise because there's no search. Is that --\nMS. MADIGAN: Justice Souter, that is absolutely\ncorrect. A search, as far as we are concerned -- and I\nbelieve it's based on the precedents of this Court -- is a\nsniff is not a search, and therefore it requires no Fourth\nAmendment justification.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You said there's no\ndisturbance of one's privacy and so that distinguishes the\ndog sniff from some other governmental intrusions. But\ndogs can be frightening, humiliating. It seems to me that\nthere is some association with the idea that I have a\nright to be let alone by my government and having a large\ndog circle my car.\nMS. MADIGAN: There are in this country millions\nof dogs, many of the types of dogs that are used by\nnarcotics detection teams, such as Labrador retrievers and\nshepherds, are identical to the pets that people own. We\nencounter them in the parks, on the streets, and I would\ncontend that an officer cannot be in the position of\nmaking a determination as to whether or not the individual\nthat he encounters is going to be frightened by the dog.\nMr. Justice Stevens, if I may, I'd like to\nreserve the remainder of my time.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, you may save your time.\nMS. MADIGAN: Thank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Wray.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER A. WRAY\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. WRAY: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThere's no dispute that respondent here was\nlawfully stopped based on probable cause. There's also no\ndispute that the entire stop took less than 9 minutes.\nThe question is whether a second officer's use of a drug\ndog to sniff outside of that car during those 9 minutes\nrequired some separate Fourth Amendment justification.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you agree with -- with\nGeneral Madigan that it doesn't make any difference\nwhether the -- the dog is a -- is a mechanical instrument\nor not? Do you agree it makes no difference?\nI thought that one of the -- one of the points\nin -- in the imaging case was that this was a new\ntechnology which didn't exist and that although the\nordinary rules in 1791 was that there was no search unless\n-- you know, unless you enter the house or unless you --\nyou physically intrude upon the person's -- at least the\nperson's clothes, we made an exception to that rule\nbecause of this new technology that enabled you to find\nout things without having to intrude into the home or into\nthe person. Now, but -- but this is not a new technology.\nThis is a dog and -- and they had that ability in 1791\njust as they had it today. And the rule that when there's\nno intrusion, there's no search -- there's no reason to\ndepart from that rule with respect to a dog although there\nwould be with respect to some sophisticated new technology\nthat would enable you to find out all sorts of things.\nMR. WRAY: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me you shouldn't --\nyou shouldn't assume that -- that the fact that this is a\ncanine makes no difference.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Are you going to rely on the\nfact that dogs were trained to do this sort of thing back\nin the 18th century?\nMR. WRAY: I'm going to rely on -- on three\ndistinctions between this case and Kyllo, Justice Stevens.\nThe first is that the three points that the\nCourt looked at in Kyllo were: one, as has already been\nreferenced, the fact that it's a home, the most sacred\nplace under the Fourth Amendment; second, that it revealed\ncertain intimate details; and third, that that was a\ntechnology --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It was potentially revealed.\nIt did not actually reveal any details.\nMR. WRAY: As -- as General Madigan referenced,\nthere is obviously some disagreement within the Court on\nthat issue, but the -- the fact was that the technology in\nKyllo revealed information about heat in the house which\ncould be thought to reveal intimate details about the\nhouse.\nThe third point in Kyllo, which I think Justice\nScalia is referring to, is that that was technology that\nwas not in general public use. Dogs have been used by law\nenforcement across the country since Place and before to\nsniff everything from --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But not in 1790.\nMR. WRAY: Not --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Did you come here --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't know that, do you?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Did you come here having\nresearched all about dogs in 1790?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WRAY: Justice Kennedy, I cannot, I regret\nto say, tell you what dogs were doing in 1790. I can tell\nyou -- and this is maybe a factual thing that might be of\ninterest to the Court -- that the dogs who train -- who\nare trained to alert to detect things -- it's not that\nthey are sniffing things that all dogs can't already\nsmell. It's rather that they are trained to let the\nhandler know that they've smelt whatever it is they've\nbeen trained to smell. So the smells that are coming out\nof Respondent Caballes' car are exposed to every dog.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you really think this would\nbe a different case if the officer had a device that did\nexactly what the dog -- dog did?\nMR. WRAY: We -- our position would still be,\nJustice Stevens, that as long as the device only revealed,\nas this does --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I would think you'd take --\nMR. WRAY: -- the absence or presence of\ncontraband, it would still be constitutional.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why do you rely on the -- in --\nin distinguishing Kyllo, why do you rely on the house if\nthere's no search? Why do you have to rely on the fact\nthat there was a house involved there? You -- you listed\nthat as one of your three distinctions.\nMR. WRAY: We don't believe we have to rely on\nit, Justice Souter. We do believe that there were three\nthings that were important in Kyllo. The fact that it was\na home was one of those things. Again, the -- the fact of\na home, the fact that it was technology not in general\npublic use, and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that didn't go to whether\nit was a search or seizure. I think it goes to whether it\nwas an unreasonable search or seizure. Don't you think\nso? That what -- what might be unreasonable with respect\nto a home would not be unreasonable with respect to a\nsuitcase?\nMR. WRAY: Yes, Justice Scalia, that's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but your -- is -- is it\n-- I understand it to be your position that there simply\nis no search here. Period.\nMR. WRAY: That is correct, Justice Souter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It's because it's a dog sniff.\nMR. WRAY: We would -- we would submit this is\nnot a search because, as this Court recognized in both\nPlace and Edmond -- and the Jacobsen case is also\nsignificant because the Court said that the reason this is\nnot a search, there using the dog sniff by analogy, is\nbecause it compromises no legitimate privacy interest.\nThe language of the Court in Place is\nsignificant because it says that we are aware of no other\ninvestigative procedure that is so limited in both the\nmanner in which the information is obtained and in the\ncontent of the information revealed. That language goes\nnot only to why it's not a Fourth Amendment search but why\nthe use of the dog sniff during a probable cause traffic\nstop here, where it doesn't prolong the duration, does not\ntransform an otherwise lawful seizure into an unlawful\none.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Do you -- do you\nthink it's -- it's reasonable to say that if the police\ntake dogs simply onto private property to sniff the\nfoundations of houses, if they take dogs to the front door\nand ring the bell so that they hope the door will open,\nthat there is -- there is no compromise of a privacy\ninterest?\nMR. WRAY: Well, there would be a question as to\nwhether the officer, the human officer, that is, could be\non private property -- I take it from your hypothetical,\nJustice Souter -- in the first place. But --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I mean, the Fourth\nAmendment analysis after Katz doesn't -- doesn't depend on\ntrespass, and -- and you have said up to this point that\nthere is no search. And then you have quite rightly said\nthat we have had as a consideration in our minds\nanalytically whether it's fair to say that what the police\nwere doing involved any compromise of a privacy interest.\nSo I'm assuming -- I'm assuming that the police\ncan at least get to the foundation with a dog and they can\ncertainly walk up to the front door and ring the bell.\nAnd if they do that with a dog, for the purpose of letting\nthe dog sniff and alert, if there's anything to alert to,\nis it fair to say that there is no compromise of the\nprivacy interests of the people who own the house?\nMR. WRAY: Our position would be -- the answer\nto that question is yes. The Court does not have to\nresolve that issue to decide this case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, we could separate\nthe home from the -- from what happened here and still\nvalidate the search here if we held that it was a search,\nbut was a reasonable one since all you find is that the\nperson was carrying contraband. It's the only thing\nthat's disclosed. Whereas, if you -- if you did the same\nthing with -- with regard to a house, which is a more\nsacrosanct part of one's privacy, it might be an\nunreasonable search. We -- we could reach that result if\nwe wanted to, couldn't we?\nMR. WRAY: I think you could, Justice Scalia.\nIt's important to distinguish --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: On the other hand, if it were\na drug-selling neighborhood or around a park where drugs\nare frequently sold, would it be legitimate in your view\nfor the police to take drug-sniffing dogs and walk around\nthe public street where cars are parked around that known\ndrug-selling area and see if they could sniff out some\ncontraband in the cars? Is that okay?\nMR. WRAY: We believe it would be okay, Justice\nO'Connor. It would be important not to use the dogs in a\nway to constitute a new seizure because in that case,\nyou're not talking --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: I'm -- I'm assuming parked\ncars. You haven't interrupted anybody. Nobody is in the\ncar, parked on a public street.\nMR. WRAY: In that instance, we believe that\nwould be acceptable under the Fourth Amendment.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So you -- you give no\nsignificance to the fact that this dog sniff was in the\ncourse of a lawful stop where the citizen's rights had\nalready been curtailed to a significant extent?\nMR. WRAY: We believe, Justice Kennedy, that the\n-- that that context here makes this an even easier case\nunder the Fourth Amendment, that is, the dog sniff not\nbeing a search compromising no legitimate privacy\ninterests during the course of a lawful probable cause\nstop, which we know from Atwater -- the officer could have\nsimply placed the woman under full custodial arrest and\ntaken her down to jail -- was not an activity that\ntransformed the seizure into an unlawful one.\nThe Illinois Supreme Court's concern and where\nwe think they got off track was that they were concerned\nthat the use of the dog sniff during this 9-minute traffic\nstop was that it transformed it -- it used the language\nthat it transformed the sniff into a drug investigation.\nWe would submit that the Fourth Amendment is about the\nreasonableness of searches and seizures and not about what\nthe scope of the government's investigation is. And in\nthat sense, the court got off track.\nThese -- this is a -- this is a means that law\nenforcement has been using properly in reliance on this\nCourt's decision in Place, reinforced just 4 years ago in\nEdmond, for more than 21 years to detect everything from\ndrugs to bombs to smuggled -- we have beagles in the\nairports that smuggle produce that's being smuggled in.\nDogs are used all over the country with great\neffectiveness in law enforcement, and the -- we -- that is\na -- a technique that we want to encourage law enforcement\nto pursue.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are there -- are there any\nmanuals for law enforcement officers with respect to the\ntime and place of using dogs, or it's just open season?\nMR. WRAY: Justice Ginsburg, there is extensive\ntraining of law enforcement to use dogs. It's a multi-\nweek program that requires --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't mean the training to\nmake the dog alert properly. How the police will use\nthem, when, under what circumstances.\nMR. WRAY: Justice Ginsburg, each agency has\ndifferent policies about when they use dogs and what\npurpose they're trained for. In this case, as you heard,\nthey're being used in the context of highway interdiction,\nand so they're trained to sniff around vehicles\nspecifically.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Wray.\nMR. WRAY: Thank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Meczyk.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF RALPH E. MECZYK\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. MECZYK: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThe State does not offer any Fourth Amendment\njustification whatsoever in regards to -- in this case.\nIt argues instead that there -- there was no need for any\njustification, and that is incorrect for two reasons.\nThe dog sniff in this case invaded a Fourth\nAmendment interest of Mr. Caballes in the context of a\nroutine traffic search. The sniff in this case was, in\nfact, a search. Albeit it was a limited intrusion, it was\nstill a search nonetheless.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why do you say that? I\nmean, is -- is anything that I observe a search? I mean,\nsuppose I -- I'm a policeman and -- and I'm looking out\nfor, I don't know, people with a nervous tic because I\nthink that that might be somebody who's about to commit a\ncrime or has committed a crime. Have I searched that\nperson because I -- I observe something external?\nMR. MECZYK: Any observation I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is there no difference between\nan investigation and a search?\nMR. MECZYK: There is in this case -- see if I\nunderstand you correctly.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. It seems to me your brief\nand -- and your statement here both seem to assume that\nthere's a search whenever the police investigate.\nMR. MECZYK: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that's not so. They -- one\ncan investigate without searching.\nMR. MECZYK: Well, to -- see if I understand\nyour question correctly. If you're looking with someone\nwith that nervous tic, that would be something in open\nview or plain view. That's not the type of investigation\nI'm talking about. There is in fact, most respectfully,\nan investigation technique here. There's an investigation\nmeasure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but that isn't the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What about a policeman who\nsmells marijuana coming out of a car or a residence. He's\nwalking down the street, public street, and he smells\nmarijuana.\nMR. MECZYK: The only way I can analogize that,\nJustice Kennedy, is that it -- that is akin to a plain\nsmell or plain view.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So once you say\nthat, you realize that there are billions and billions of\nsearches that go on every day that the police don't have\nto justify at all. They just look around.\nMR. MECZYK: I don't --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay? There are billions of\nthem. So the real question is do they have to give a\njustification for this. And the argument that they don't\nis simply that it's not in the person's house. When you\ngo out in a public place, even in your car, you might run\ninto people or animals with sharp noses. And a lot of\nthem can detect marijuana. And you know, maybe it's a\nLimburger cheese. I don't know.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: But people are sniffing things\nthat they don't sniff through windows into your house, but\nthey do get odors in your car on the street. So this is\nthe kind of search. Yes, it's a search, but one that the\npolice don't have to justify.\nMR. MECZYK: But this is with a specific\ninvestigative tool.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, it's a specific\ninvestigative tool when I put on my glasses to look\nthrough a window.\nMR. MECZYK: Well, this is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't see why it has to --\nwhy that matters if in fact all -- if you go into a car, a\npolice car, and you have -- drive through the neighborhood\nand look around, you are using a specific investigative\ntool, the police car, to look around and find out what's\ngoing on.\nMR. MECZYK: This is a far more -- most\nrespectfully, this is a far more sophisticated\ninvestigative tool.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What I'm trying to get to is in\nmy own mind it's not a question of the tools. It's a\nquestion of the expectation of privacy.\nMR. MECZYK: Then maybe I can see if I could\nanswer your question. Mr. Caballes in this case indeed\nhad an expectation of privacy. When he was asked by the\npolice officer in this case if he can consent to the\nsearch, he said no. He did not want that law enforcement\nofficer looking in --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that never --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, but both Place and\nEdmond, opinions from this Court, said sniffs are not\nsearches.\nMR. MECZYK: Well, I --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do you want us to reverse\nthat?\nMR. MECZYK: Justice O'Connor, I do not -- I do\nnot want you to reverse Place. Place, no pun intended --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, and Edmond also said\nit's not a search.\nMR. MECZYK: Well, there were --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: It was the stop of the cars\nin that case that caused the result.\nMR. MECZYK: The way I understand Place it was\ncontextually limited. In Place, the whole purpose of the\nseizure, the taking of the luggage, was to submit it to a\ndrug-detection sniff. That is the opinion authored by\nYour Honor, that specifically stated -- I'm not going to\nsay took for granted, but it specifically stated that the\n-- the context -- and that's what we have to look at Place\n-- the --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Fine. We had a context there\nwhere we supported it, but in the process said the sniff,\nthe dog sniff, was not a search.\nMR. MECZYK: Well, I -- I --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: So you want us to say\nsomething else here.\nMR. MECZYK: Well, I think that first in -- in\nthat case, in Place, the -- the Court --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: The context here was a\nlegitimate traffic stop.\nMR. MECZYK: But it was -- unlike Place, the\nlegitimate traffic stop here was completely unrelated to\nthe purpose of the dog sniff. There was an absolute --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: The dog sniff is not a\nsearch. What difference does it make?\nMR. MECZYK: Well, again, I would again\nrespectfully assert that the dog sniff is a search and the\nway Place was decided, first, the decision had to be made,\nin the context of -- of that case, what was worse. What\nwere they going to do with the luggage? Were they going\nto open the luggage first? So, of course, the Court had\nto decide in that case that it wasn't that kind of a -- a\nsearch. It wasn't as egregious a search as actually\nopening the luggage.\nThen you --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: This -- the trunk of the car\ndidn't have to be opened here.\nMR. MECZYK: I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: The trunk of the vehicle did\nnot have to be opened here. You're talking about a dog\nsniffing on the exterior of the vehicle that was\nlegitimately stopped for a traffic violation.\nMR. MECZYK: Again, in this context, unlike in\nPlace, there was absolutely no relationship between the --\nthe dog sniff and the dog sniff of Caballes' trunk and the\nsniff of the luggage that was placed at LaGuardia Airport\nin Place. There's a great distinction. Moreover --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose a policeman follows me\naround. He just -- just follows me around, observing with\nhis -- with plain eyes, nothing else. Now, is that a\nsearch? Does he need probable cause to do that? Now, he's\nwasting his time and he's wasting public money and maybe he\nshould get fired for doing it, if he has no reason to follow\nme.\nMR. MECZYK: It's not a search.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And maybe -- maybe I'd have a\nharassment action against him if he does it, you know,\nblatantly. But is that a search?\nMR. MECZYK: It is not a search. If he follows\nyou --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So -- so the mere fact\nthat one is in investigating something doesn't make it a\nsearch. What does make it a search?\nMR. MECZYK: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The fact that you find out\nsomething?\nMR. MECZYK: I think here the most distinctive\npoint here is that Caballes had already been stopped\nunlike the hypothetical that you just presented to me.\nCaballes was already stopped for one -- for probable\ncause. There's no question about that. But then now the\npolice launch into a wholly unrelated investigation\nthat's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You think it would be better if\nhe hadn't been stopped? If -- if they just -- just\nrandomly walked up to somebody who was going through a\ntoll booth and had the dog sniff the car, you think that\nwould be a better case --\nMR. MECZYK: I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- for allowing it than -- than\nyours?\nMR. MECZYK: Even in that case, even in a\nhypothetical where they used the dog for a toll booth, I\nhave a problem with that. That to me is a search. It's\ndifferent than -- I would assert it's different than if\nthey walked -- one of the hypotheticals that the Justices\nasked my adversary in this case, when they asked, well,\nwhat if they walked the dog instead around a -- parked\ncars or parked cars at a stadium? It depends for what\npurpose they want to walk those parked -- that dog around\nthose parked cars. My assertion is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, they said it's to find\nout if there's any contraband.\nMR. MECZYK: I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The answer was they are at\nliberty -- the police are at liberty to use dogs to find\ncontraband. And your -- Illinois I think was very candid\nwith the Court in saying we have taken from your decisions\nthat a dog sniff is not a search. So anything else is a\nmatter of police policy. It had nothing to do with the\nFourth Amendment.\nMR. MECZYK: Well, I -- I strongly differ. I\nhave to look at the purpose that they are going to use the\ndog for. This Court --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, does it matter if, for\ninstance, in today's world on Capitol Hill we're concerned\nabout terrorist attacks. What if the dog is trained to\nalert to explosives? Now, can the police just decide\nthey're going to sniff any car that's parked on Capitol\nHill?\nMR. MECZYK: Justice O'Connor, it depends on the\npurpose.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes or no, in your view. The\npurpose is to disclose potential explosives in a parked\nvehicle.\nMR. MECZYK: The answer is yes. I have no\nproblem whatsoever.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Wherever it is.\nMR. MECZYK: Wherever it is because I look at it\nas a public safety exception. And this Court in the\nEdmond case specifically condemned a general search -- a\ngeneral crime -- let me use the exact words. General\ninterest in crime control, to quote the Edmond case. And\nthat's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I still want to go back to my\nquestion because I think you may have an answer to it and\nI want to focus you --\nMR. MECZYK: I'm struggling, yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I want to focus you on the\nquestion. I think what you're doing, which is a\nreasonable thing to do, but it isn't my approach, look to\nthe English definition of search. I say forget that.\nLet's look to the Fourth Amendment because there are a\nwhole range of searches that don't even fall within the\nFourth Amendment in the sense that we don't need a\njustification. And I take Place as saying that dog sniffs\nis one of those, whether it does or doesn't use the word\nEnglish search.\nSo I want to know why it is that this dog search\nis one of the ones that's a Fourth Amendment search, i.e.,\none of the ones that requires a justification in terms of\nwhat the Fourth Amendment is about, privacy.\nMR. MECZYK: It invades a public -- I'm sorry.\nIt invades a private space that in this particular case\nthe respondent Caballes had a privacy interest in, that he\nwanted to exclude the whole world from going inside his\ntrunk. That's the difference.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but you don't respond to\none point in Place, if I remember correctly. It must be a\nlegitimate expectation of privacy, and if the only thing\nthe dog can detect is something illegitimate, how can you\nsay there's an invasion of a legitimate expectation in\nprivacy?\nMR. MECZYK: Well, it is -- it's true that one\ndoes not have an expectation of privacy in contraband, but\nby the same token, I have an expectation or Mr. Caballes\nhad an expectation of -- of privacy of what's inside that\nclosed trunk, his car. The Carroll doctrine is still good\nlaw. We still apply the Fourth Amendment in cars. It's\ntrue that the home is sacrosanct, but just because it's a\nhome, it's not a talisman where -- where the Fourth\nAmendment no longer applies.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was something you said\nin -- in your brief that I thought was unclear. So may I\nask you --\nMR. MECZYK: Of course.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- if Officer Gillette, the\none who did the arrest for speeding, had a dog in the back\nof his car, instead of having the second officer come with\nthe dog, would it have been permissible? I thought you\nhad conceded that it would be a different situation if the\ndog was already there when the car stopped.\nMR. MECZYK: First of all, Justice Ginsburg, my\nrecollection is that Trooper Gillette, who was the officer\nwho stopped Caballes, did not have a -- a dog in the car.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No, he didn't, but I'm asking\nyou to imagine that he did.\nMR. MECZYK: I see. If he had a dog in the car\nand the dog just happened to have alerted without his\ncuing the dog or walking the dog -- and I'll answer that\nin a moment too -- that would be pure serendipity. That\nmight happen. If -- if the dog just happened to have\nalerted. But if the troopers deliberately drove the car\nclose by -- and in reality, that's not what happens.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No. I would like to take\nthis scenario as it is except that when the officer gets\nout of the car, his dog comes with him.\nMR. MECZYK: Okay.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This is very -- make no other\nchanges except that Gillette has the dog and Gillette with\nthe dog go to Mr. Caballes' car.\nMR. MECZYK: My understanding of the way this\nworks, Justice Ginsburg, is that he just couldn't go up to\nthe car without -- and the dog would alert. My\nunderstanding of the way these dogs are trained is that\nthey specifically -- that the officer has to walk the dog\naround the car, the vehicle, first of all.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He does that. He does that.\nMR. MECZYK: He does that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, in this case.\nMR. MECZYK: He does that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. MECZYK: To cue the dog. In other words,\ntell him it's not playtime anymore, that he has to work.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. MECZYK: To trigger something in the -- in\nthe canine brain.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- I'm --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would it be bad? Would it be\nbad if that's what he did?\nMR. MECZYK: It wouldn't be bad that's what --\nwell, yes. In this case it's very bad because it's a\nsearch. There's no question. I'm not coming off of that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I'm -- I'm trying to\nunderstand what you meant in your brief when you said if\nthe dog had been in Gillette's car when Gillette stopped\nCaballes, the situation would have been different.\nMR. MECZYK: I -- I think what I meant there --\nthere would have been -- it would have been purely\nhappenstance, almost like plain view. It would have been\n-- without him even cuing the dog or starting to walk the\ndog around, my answer to that Justice Ginsburg is that\nthat would have been all right.\nExcept now that -- the more I think about it,\nI'm not so sure that it would be all right. And my answer\nto -- and the reason for that is I think in that case the\nofficer, if he could do such a thing and the dog would\nalert, would be exploiting the situation, would just be\ntaking the dog and walking him around the car and seeing\nthat the dog alerted. So in other words, there -- there\nwould be, I think, an exploitation of -- of the -- of the\ntraffic stop.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So then it really makes no\ndifference whether it was Gillette who had the dog in his\ncar or whether the dispatcher called another officer who\nhad the dog.\nMR. MECZYK: That is correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It doesn't -- so you're\nretracting that.\nYou, I think, were asked but I'm -- I'm not sure\nyou fully answered. Suppose the police, as Atwater would\nallow, arrested, made a full arrest of Caballes, and then\nthey impound his car. In the place where they put it,\ncouldn't they have a dog go around the car there?\nMR. MECZYK: Yes. Yes. I -- if we had an\nAtwater situation -- in this case there wasn't an Atwater\nsituation because there was first a warning given. You're\ncorrect. There was a warning given. I'm sorry. The\nofficer Gillette told Caballes he was going to give him a\nwarning. So unlike the Knowles --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But he could have. He could\nhave. I mean --\nMR. MECZYK: He could have, but he didn't.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- is -- is --\nMR. MECZYK: But he didn't. He didn't.\nInstead, he chose to treat this as more of a Knowles\nsituation. This case is -- is on all fours, no pun\nintended, like Knowles. In other words, in the -- in\nKnowles v. Iowa, the Court -- a case of this -- I'm sorry.\nLet me untwist my tongue. In Knowles v. Iowa, you had a --\nyou had a traffic stop and after the traffic stop, there\nwas a statute that said unrelated to the traffic stop, you\ncan go in and search. And this is the same thing. This\nofficer here Gillette treated Caballes as the officer in\nKnowles in -- treated Mr. Knowles in Iowa. It's the exact\nsame thing.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the -- the difficulty\nthat I have with that argument is take the -- take the\ncase of -- of the arrestable offense in which it is\nundoubtedly the case that although the police don't\nnormally arrest, they -- they can. Your -- if I\nunderstand your argument, you're saying if they, in fact,\ndo arrest, they may then take the dog around the car, and\nindeed, I presume you would agree, they could make an\ninventory search because they've got to protect themselves\nagainst claims that they lost property and so on. So\nthere's no question that in that case, as -- as you have\nargued it, they could make a full-blown search and -- and\ncertainly can use the dog. But if they choose not to\narrest on the highway, they can't.\nMy problem is how can you say that there is a\nreasonable expectation of privacy in case number two if\nyou admit that the police can search in case number one.\nHow does that affect the reasonable expectation of\nprivacy?\nMR. MECZYK: To me, once a person is told that\nhe is not going to be under arrest, it changes the whole\ncomplexion of the case. I think it's a completely\ndifferent -- a completely different scenario. We don't\nhave an arrest. It doesn't matter. Atwater --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Could the officer change his\nmind? I mean, he -- he did say I'm just going to give you\na citation, and then he said, mind if I search your car.\nThis is before the -- the dog showed up. And suppose the\nperson who had been speeding said, yes, I mind. Don't\nsearch my car. And then the police said, well, in that\ncase I'm going to arrest you.\nMR. MECZYK: It's a difficult question, but I\nhave to look at what -- I think reasonableness is judged.\nAgain, I'm going to remember what the -- those cases\ntaught. I think what Knowles taught, that reasonableness\nis judged by what the police actually do as opposed to\nwhat they might have done.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Meczyk, I assume that your\nanswer to whether it's lawful to have a -- a dog at a bus\ndepot just to sniff the bags of people who were coming\noff, without stopping them, but just -- just to have the\ndogs there, that's unlawful.\nMR. MECZYK: It depends --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: For narcotics, not for bombs,\nnot for -- just -- just for narcotics. The police think,\nyou know, a lot of narcotics goes on interstate buses.\nWe're going to put a dog in the bus depot.\nMR. MECZYK: It's a little less problematic to\nme, Justice Scalia, than the type of stop I'm talking\nabout here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why?\nMR. MECZYK: It's a little less problematic.\nOne, because it's a public place and I -- I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, so is the road, for\nPete's sake.\nMR. MECZYK: I know, but -- but here I think\nthere's a lesser expectation of privacy. Well, I don't\neven want to go that far. I -- I have to answer your\nquestion. I think that submitting the dogs without any --\nsubmitting the luggage without any reasonable articulable\nsuspicion --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. MECZYK: -- unlike the case --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. MECZYK: -- unlike the case in -- in Place,\nthat that to me is still a search. So --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. That's -- that's what I\nthink you should say.\nMR. MECZYK: And I am saying it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but that isn't -- I take\nit you don't --\nMR. MECZYK: Sorry it took me so long.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there anything wrong with\nthe policeman himself taking a sniff?\nMR. MECZYK: It goes back to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's the great Limburger cheese\nrobbery.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: He stopped the car and he walks\naround. Anything wrong with that?\nMR. MECZYK: There's nothing wrong if he can\ndetect Limburger cheese. That to me is like plain smell.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right.\nMR. MECZYK: As awful as that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So plain --\nMR. MECZYK: As awful as it might be --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So -- so what\nyou're saying is -- and this must tie back to reasonable\nexpectation of privacy. All right? Because it's okay for\nthe policeman to do it, and it's okay for dogs to do it in\nthe bus station, and it's okay to use a dog not in the bus\nstation with a car if in fact you actually are going to\nput him under arrest, although here you had probable cause\nto do so, I take it. And now you have to draw a pretty\nfine line. But it's not okay where it's not the bus\nstation, but it is the car and in fact the dog is doing\nthe sniffing -- and there are a lot of dogs around that\ncan sniff -- and you did have probable cause but you\ndidn't say it. And in face of Justice O'Connor's case\nwhich said that -- you see. Well, I mean, this is -- this\nis --\nMR. MECZYK: I guess you --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I'm not saying you\ncouldn't draw that line, but I'm saying it's pretty tough\nI think.\nMR. MECZYK: I guess you're telling me I'm --\nI'm the underdog in this case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I don't know.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm right? Am I -- I mean,\nthat --\nMR. MECZYK: It is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And you're going to draw the --\nwell, I don't want you to repeat yourself necessarily.\nMR. MECZYK: No. It --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you had already drawn the\nline at a different place than Justice Breyer suggested\nbecause in response to Justice Scalia, you said if it --\nif it were going into the bus terminal just to sniff for\nnarcotics, unlike explosives, it would be an impermissible\nsearch.\nMR. MECZYK: Yes, correct, Justice --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That would be --\nMR. MECZYK: That is correct, Justice Ginsburg.\nWhat makes this particular so --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but is -- why -- why\ndon't you simply say, look -- have a very simple line. If\nthey can arrest, they can sniff. If they can't arrest,\nthey can't sniff without individualized suspicion going to\ndrugs or whatever.\nMR. MECZYK: I would agree with that if I use an\n-- if -- if you're referring to an Atwater type scenario.\nIf they have probable -- if they decide to arrest, even\nthough it's on a minor traffic case, such as Atwater,\nwhich was a seat belt, as long as it's -- if -- if it's\nminor and if the officer elects to choose to do a full-\nblown arrest, then all the consequences that follow from\nthat arrest are -- it's going to happen. Excuse me. It's\ngoing to happen.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But what -- what is the answer\nto the reasonable expectation to privacy question in that\ncase? Isn't your expectation of privacy identical,\nwhatever it may be, or isn't the reasonable expectation of\nprivacy identical, whatever that may be, without regard to\nthe discretionary decision of the officer to arrest or\nnot?\nMR. MECZYK: I -- I think that when the officer\ndoes a full-blown arrest, as was envisioned in Atwater,\nyou know that you -- the person knows that he or she does\nnot have a reasonable expectation of privacy.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you're saying that the --\nthe reasonable expectation of privacy depends upon the\nofficer's discretionary judgment whether or not to arrest.\nIsn't that what you're saying?\nMR. MECZYK: Essentially yes, because I think\nthat the officer takes a physical action. It's just more\nthan words. It's also his deeds. I think in Atwater,\nunlike Knowles -- in Atwater, in that case, I think the --\nthe officer did make an election, and there was a full-\nblown or a full-fledged arrest. And I think there your --\nyour reasonable expectation to privacy does, in fact, go\nout the window.\nBut this is so different. This was just a\nwarning. Period. It was nothing worse than a warning.\nWhat makes this stop so pernicious is that it takes place\nin front of the whole world and is accusatory. It is\nprofoundly embarrassing, and it is humiliating to everyone\non the street. So if a person is stopped and the officer\njust decides to stop you for a minor traffic offense,\nthat's the worst part about this case. Just a minor\ntraffic offense, really a frivolous offense, basically\nwhat any law-abiding citizen would happen to -- it could\nhappen to anyone. And as this Court has said, even in\nWhren, there are so many multiple technical violations of\n-- of -- technical violations --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, I think it's worse if\n-- if you're subjected to it without having committed any\nviolation at all. Every time I travel abroad and come\nback into the country, customs officers have dogs and --\nand they parade the dogs through -- through the baggage\nterminal. Do -- do I feel offended by that?\nMR. MECZYK: No, Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This isn't a public safety\nmatter. They're -- they're not smelling for bombs.\nThey're -- they're smelling for contraband. And according\nto you, that is bad.\nMR. MECZYK: That -- in that situation, when you\nenter the country -- and this Court has said many times\nagain -- it's a border search. There's nothing that I can\nargue against the border search. It's the -- or the\nfunctional equivalent of the border. That is a border\nsearch. I bring luggage to the airport, in today's world\nI have a lesser expectation of privacy. If I know I'm\ntraveling abroad and coming into the United States, that's\ndifferent. That's different in an airport.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. A bus station is\ndifferent, though.\nMR. MECZYK: A bus station here inside the\nUnited States is different I think. I -- I look at your\nairport hypothetical as being -- as dealing with a border.\nIf it's not at a border and I use your hypothetical, it's\nat O'Hare Airport or Reagan International Airport and they\nbring a dog up to sniff for drugs at the carousel, that to\nme is a search. It's like -- I think you said in one\nopinion once if it -- you used the duck analogy, well, if\nit walks like a duck or quacks like a duck. Here it's\nstill a search. It walks like a -- a dog and it acts like\na dog, but its specific function is in fact to search out\nin public and humiliate people.\nIf there are any further questions.\nI respectfully ask this honorable Court to\naffirm the wise judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court.\nThank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Meczyk.\nGeneral Madigan, you have I think about 3\nminutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LISA MADIGAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. MADIGAN: Thank you, Justice Stevens.\nLet me make three brief points.\nNumber one, Justice Ginsburg asked a question\nabout something that was in the respondent's brief,\nwhether or not it made a difference if a dog was with\nMaster Sergeant Gillette when he initiated the stop or if\nthe dog was later brought, as was the case here, by\nTrooper Graham. Really what Mr. Caballes is arguing for\nhere is an inadvertence requirement which this Court very\nclearly held in Horton, there is no such requirement of\ninadvertence. And so a law officer, if they are at a\nlawful vantage point, do have the ability to detect\nincriminating facts. That is not something that has to\noccur inadvertently. It can happen intentionally.\nSecond, Justice Scalia asked a question about\nplain view, and similar to plain view, a dog sniff does\nnot effect an incremental search or seizure. And\ntherefore, similar to plain view, a dog sniff does not\nrequire Fourth Amendment justification.\nAnd let me finally acknowledge something that\nJustice Souter brought up, which is whether or not, by\nwalking a dog around a house, you in fact would have a\nsearch. Let me -- now, that is certainly a closer case\nthan whether walking a dog around a car constitutes a\nsearch, which we say is not. But ultimately you would\nreach a similar result because the principle is not going\nto extend to cars in the same manner in -- in Kyllo as the\nthermal imager did.\nFinally, if there are no further questions, we\nwould ask that the judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court\nbe reversed.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, General Madigan.\nThe -- the case is submitted.\nMS. MADIGAN: Thank you.\n(Whereupon, at 10:57 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n"
