        "content": "(10:05 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in No. 01-757, Syngenta Crop Protection, Inc. v.\nHurley Henson.\nMr. Alsobrook.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY B. ALSOBROOK, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. ALSOBROOK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn Kikkonen v. Guardian Life, this Court\nhypothesized the very situation that we have before you\nthis morning because here we have a nationwide class\naction settlement where the court specifically by judgment\nretained jurisdiction to manage the settlement as well as\nenforce it. A critical part of that settlement was the\ndismissal of this case. However, when class counsel went\nto dismiss the case, as the Eleventh Circuit pointed out\nand as the district court pointed out, his efforts were\nthwarted and the case was not dismissed.\nQUESTION: Mr. Alsobrook, I see you've changed\nthe question presented from the time in your certiorari\npetition to your opening brief. And the question\npresented, when we granted, referred to 28 U.S.C., section\n1441, and now you have dropped your reference to that.\nDoes that mean you're abandoning reliance on 1441 or\nsimply broadening the question?\nMR. ALSOBROOK: No, sir. We -- we're saying\nthat under 1441 that because the district court retained\njurisdiction, that that was original jurisdiction to\nremove the matter, and that actually, Your Honor, when we\nremoved this, they -- the majority of circuit courts of\nappeals, namely the second, sixth, seventh, and eighth,\nhad said that the proper vehicle to remove this was the\nAll Writs Act. And that is what we are claiming today, as\nwell as 28 U.S.C. 1367 ancillary jurisdiction, and we have\nset that out in our brief.\nQUESTION: But you have no right to remove under\n1441 because there wasn't complete diversity in the\nLouisiana suit. Isn't that right?\nMR. ALSOBROOK: That is correct.\nQUESTION: So you can't rely on 1441 and that's\nconceded.\nMR. ALSOBROOK: We -- we can -- our reliance on\n1441 was based on the fact that the Alabama court retained\noriginal jurisdiction and --\nQUESTION: But that's not -- nothing in 41 rests\non that. It has to be a case that would qualify for\noriginal jurisdiction, and you don't have that.\nMR. ALSOBROOK: Yes, Your Honor, but we -- we\nconstrued that as being a venue rather than a -- a --\nbecause the Alabama court had original jurisdiction.\nAnd certainly under 1651 --\nQUESTION: What did you construe as being venue?\nMR. ALSOBROOK: The -- the fact that we had to\ntake it to a Federal court in the district where the State\ncourt suit lay, and then it was immediately transferred to\nthe -- to the Alabama court.\nQUESTION: Yes, you -- you can't remove a case\nto a Federal court outside of the district in which the\nState court sat, is my understanding.\nMR. ALSOBROOK: That's right, Your Honor.\nWe took -- we took our road map from Agent\nOrange Product Liability. There they had a Texas --\nQUESTION: Who is they?\nMR. ALSOBROOK: There, there was a --\nQUESTION: What court are you talking about?\nMR. ALSOBROOK: We're talking about the Second\nCircuit. And --\nQUESTION: Initially the Eastern District of New\nYork, Judge Weinstein's --\nMR. ALSOBROOK: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- order, which was in no way based\non 1441. It was based on 1651.\nMR. ALSOBROOK: But, Your Honor, also in that\ncase was the case of Ryan, and in Ryan, it was brought by\nto class members in the State court in Texas. And it was\nremoved to the Federal court in Texas and then transferred\nto the Eastern District of New York. And that was our\nroad map for getting this case to -- back to Alabama.\nQUESTION: But that was all done under the All\nWrits Act or what they thought was the authority granted\nby 1651.\nMR. ALSOBROOK: Yes, and we also, Your Honor --\nin our removal petition, we pled the All Writs Act, as\nwell as ancillary jurisdiction under 1367.\nQUESTION: Well, what is your theory under the\nAll Writs Act? Is your theory that removal is itself --\ncomes under the All Writs Act?\nMR. ALSOBROOK: We contend that -- that in order\nfor the Court --\nQUESTION: Can't you answer the question yes or\nno?\nMR. ALSOBROOK: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yes.\nQUESTION: I thought the All Writs Act required\nthe existence of some sort of a common law writ like\ncertiorari or prohibition or injunction or something like\nthat. There -- there never was a common law writ of\nremoval.\nMR. ALSOBROOK: That is correct, Your Honor.\nBut the jurisprudence, particularly the Agent\nOrange case --\nQUESTION: Well, but can you cite any of our\ncases that support you in this respect?\nMR. ALSOBROOK: Well, I can cite the New York\nTelephone case where the Court said that -- that removal\nwas -- not removal, but a writ under the All Writs Act was\n-- was proper to avoid the frustration of judgment, and\nthat was -- that was certainly the situation here.\nQUESTION: But -- but that was a different --\nthat was an existing writ. Here -- here you're saying, in\neffect, that removal is -- is itself a writ. And I simply\ndon't see how the cases support you there.\nMR. ALSOBROOK: I agree with that, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Do you agree that the All Writs Act\nis not a source of original jurisdiction?\nMR. ALSOBROOK: Yes, ma'am. Yes, Your Honor, by\nthe --\nQUESTION: Why -- why then didn't you try to get\nan injunction in the district court in Alabama?\nMR. ALSOBROOK: There were two reasons, Justice\nO'Connor. First is that an injunction would not dismiss\nthe case. An injunction would enjoin the -- the State\ncourt suit from going forward.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. ALSOBROOK: And we would have had -- our\nclient would have had to carry this as a liability on\ntheir books ad infinitum.\nQUESTION: Well, couldn't the injunction have\nordered the party to dismiss the case?\nMR. ALSOBROOK: Yes, they did -- they could,\nYour Honor, and --\nQUESTION: But then why -- why wouldn't that be\nsufficient?\nMR. ALSOBROOK: I suppose it would have been.\nQUESTION: But if that's so, then why don't --\nwhy are we trying to read into 1441 language that isn't\nthere and read requirements out of 1651, requirements that\nare there, when there was another way, totally consistent\nwith the words, the statute, everything else, that you\ncould have achieved any legitimate objective that you had?\nMR. ALSOBROOK: Well, Justice Breyer, at the\ntime that we did this, as I said earlier, there was -- the\nmajority of Federal circuit courts said that the proper\nvehicle was to remove the case and get it before the court\nwhere -- that had issued the judgment. Today with the\nnumber of class action settlements that are going on,\nthere must be some kind of way by which a Federal court\nwho issues a judgment can enforce that judgment across\nState lines.\nQUESTION: There is. Isn't that just in your\nanswer to Justice O'Connor and Justice Kennedy? You\nprovided the way.\nMR. ALSOBROOK: Yes.\nQUESTION: The -- the only loose end, it seems\nto me, that -- that you have left, after your answers to\nJustices O'Connor and Kennedy, is the problem you say your\nclient would have in carrying liability on the books until\nthe second action was somehow finally terminated. But\nisn't the answer to that that once you had gotten either\nthe injunction or simply the -- the order to the parties\nunder the retained jurisdiction, you then could have gone\ninto court in the second suit and said, they cannot\nprosecute the suit? It has been enjoined. Therefore,\nplease dismiss it. Wouldn't you have gotten your\ndismissal and wouldn't that have taken the -- the\nliability off the book?\nMR. ALSOBROOK: I don't know, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I guess why wouldn't that\nhave been the appropriate course?\nMR. ALSOBROOK: I -- I presume that the State\ncourt under those circumstances would dismiss it, but we\ndon't know that as a matter of fact.\nQUESTION: I -- I was thinking about different\nwrits, and you've researched this more thoroughly than I,\nI suspect. I thought the closest thing here was a writ of\ncertiorari. This is like a writ of certiorari, but a writ\nof certiorari is from a superior court to an inferior\ncourt. And I -- I don't think that's the way we treat\nState courts and Federal courts.\nMR. ALSOBROOK: That is correct, Your Honor.\nAnd another reason --\nQUESTION: And -- and -- which -- and so that\nthe absence of that kind of -- of writ indicates to me\nthat the safer course, the more prudent course is to rely\non the standard equitable remedies such as injunction that\nwe've been discussing.\nMR. ALSOBROOK: That is correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Except that a lot of other lawyers\nhad -- had relied on the course that you relied on.\nMR. ALSOBROOK: That's correct, and a lot of --\nQUESTION: You were following what had been a\nsuccessful course in the past.\nMR. ALSOBROOK: And not only that, a lot of\njudges.\nQUESTION: Well, to be sure.\nMR. ALSOBROOK: And so there were a plethora of\ndistrict court cases that allowed the removal under the\nAll Writs Act and took jurisdiction where they had\njurisdiction originally under the cases of NAACP, under\nthe Agent Orange case, and the Sixth and Seventh Circuit\ncases.\nQUESTION: Were there any cases under the\nrelitigation exception to the Anti-Injunction Act that\nused that device, the antisuit injunction, to accomplish\nthe same thing?\nMR. ALSOBROOK: Well, Your Honor, no. The Tenth\nCircuit had ruled that the -- that the All Writs Act could\nnot be used in this -- in the method that we used it. We\nare not unmindful of Rivet v. Regions, but we -- our\nsituation there -- our situation in this case is much\ndifferent --\nQUESTION: But that was -- that was a question\nof fighting it out in the State court, and it's not the\nantisuit injunction that we're discussing now. Rivet said\nit's an -- preclusion is an affirmative defense. You can\nraise it in the State court that prior Federal litigation\nprecludes this case.\nThe other way to go is to ask the court that\nentered the judgment, the class action judgment, the\nnationwide class action, to enjoin the party who was\nsupposed to have settled the claim from proceeding in the\n-- in the original case when part of the bargain was to\ndismiss it. So I -- I'm just curious why you didn't\nattempt that route.\nMR. ALSOBROOK: We didn't attempt that, Your\nHonor, because the majority of the circuits at the time\napproved the All Writs Act as the vehicle with which to\nremove the case and to get it back before the district\ncourt.\nAdditionally, we felt that it -- State courts\nhave cases removed all the time to Federal court. And we\nthought it would be less onerous to the State court judge\nto have it removed rather than being enjoined by a Federal\ncourt.\nQUESTION: I don't understand that because right\n-- built right into the removal provision is a command\nthat the State court shall proceed no further. So the\nremoval petition acts as -- as a -- an injunction against\nthe State court proceeding further.\nMR. ALSOBROOK: Well, the removal petition --\nactually the court loses jurisdiction of it at that time\nbecause they -- it -- it is removed to -- to the Federal\ncourt. And there again, Justice Ginsburg, the -- we felt\nthat it was less onerous and there was some jurisprudence\nor some dicta and some legal writing that indicated that\nit would be less onerous to the State court judge to have\nit removed rather than have it enjoined.\nQUESTION: May I ask this question? Looking at\nthe language of the All Writs Act, which authorizes all\ncourts established by act of Congress to issue writs\nnecessary or appropriate in aid of their respective\njurisdictions and so forth.\nNow, in this case, you removed from the Federal\n-- to the Federal court in Louisiana in order to protect\nthe jurisdiction of the Federal court in Alabama.\nMR. ALSOBROOK: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: How do you square that with the\nlanguage, respective jurisdictions?\nMR. ALSOBROOK: Well, Your Honor, there again we\nhad to rely on Agent Orange.\nQUESTION: You don't rely on the statute,\nthough.\nMR. ALSOBROOK: Well, we relied on the statute\nbecause it says in the aid of their respective\njurisdiction, and --\nQUESTION: Don't you think that refers to the\ncourt to which removal would take -- would occur? And\nhere it's the Louisiana Federal court, not the Alabama\nFederal court.\nMR. ALSOBROOK: Yes, sir, and we -- it was our\nposition that there -- there respective jurisdiction\nrelated to the Alabama court. That is our position.\nQUESTION: Even though you removed to the\nLouisiana court.\nMR. ALSOBROOK: We had to, Your Honor. That --\nunder 1441, we had no alternative but to remove it. We\ncouldn't have removed it from the Louisiana court to the\nAlabama court because 1441 by venue says that it has to go\nto the Federal district court in the -- of the district\nwhere the case lies.\nQUESTION: But 1441 wasn't available to you. So\nas long as something new is being created in -- under\n1651, why not say that -- that the court that has\njurisdiction over the class action can issue orders to\nstop inconsistent litigation?\nMR. ALSOBROOK: That could be done under the\nAnti-Injunction Act, Your Honor. There's no doubt about\nthat. And as -- as --\nQUESTION: But do -- as far as -- you're\ncreating a removal that doesn't exist by statute. So not\n-- why not go all the way and say, under the All Writs\nAct, we can remove to the -- from the Louisiana State\ncourt to the Alabama court? Why touch base with 1441 when\n1441 is inapplicable?\nMR. ALSOBROOK: Because 14 -- we didn't know of\nany other vehicle that would allow us to remove it from\nLouisiana to Alabama. Even the All Writs Act would not\nallow us to remove it across State lines or even out of\nthe district. Certainly if this case had been brought in\nMobile, then we wouldn't be here today because the -- the\ncourt in Mobile would have authority to -- to remove it to\nthat district. But it was brought -- brought across State\nlines. And again, we followed the road map that had been\nset out for us in Agent Orange.\nQUESTION: But you still have problems even if\nit were to the Middle District of Alabama, because you\ndon't have complete diversity in the Louisiana action.\nTherefore, 1441 doesn't apply. You would still have to\nuse your All Writs Act theory even if the case were\npending -- if the Federal and State court were in the same\nState.\nMR. ALSOBROOK: Well, Your Honor, we feel that\n-- that under -- under the hypothet set out in Kikkonen\nthat the Alabama court would have had jurisdiction to take\nthat case.\nQUESTION: Mr. Alsobrook, what is -- what is\nthis writ called? I mean, Lyndon Johnson is -- is once\nsupposed to have asked somebody in the Justice Department\nto get him a writ of fixitatis.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: What -- what is this writ called? A\nwrit of removal?\nMR. ALSOBROOK: This could be a -- well, there\nis no writ for this, Judge -- Justice. There isn't any\nwrit for this.\nQUESTION: Well -- well, then how can you do it\nunder the All Writs Act?\nMR. ALSOBROOK: Because in other cases, the All\nWrits Act has been used to -- to remove cases to avoid a\nState court case from thwarting a Federal judgment.\nQUESTION: Certiorari I guess is the closest.\nHistorically you could have sent certiorari -- a court to\nany other court and to any administrative agency. I guess\nthat would be the closest historically. Would it?\nMR. ALSOBROOK: Well, I think Justice Kennedy\nbrought that up and --\nQUESTION: Yes. As we've come to limit it, it's\n-- it's higher to lower, but if you go back into history,\nit wasn't, I don't think. I mean, has it come down to\nsaying, look, you were in a situation where you thought\nthat the signer of the stipulation was flat out violating\nit, and you didn't know what to do, so you read the\nprecedent, and there was precedent that suggested, under\nthe lower court precedent, that this was the right thing\nto do. So you did it.\nMR. ALSOBROOK: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: Okay. Now, if you turn out to be\nwrong, what should we do next, assuming you're right about\nthe stipulation? They just flat-out wouldn't follow it.\nAnd -- and suppose you were wrong about the route. Have\nyou any suggestion for us as to what to do? Do we -- I\nguess we'd have to dismiss -- order this case dismissed\nwithout prejudice to your going to the Alabama court and\n-- and asking them to enjoin? Or what is your suggestion\nabout what we should do --\nMR. ALSOBROOK: Well --\nQUESTION: -- if you're right on the merits of\nthis thing?\nMR. ALSOBROOK: If we're right on the merits,\nYour Honor, what I suggest you should do is reverse the\nEleventh Circuit.\nQUESTION: I don't mean the merits of the\nprocedural issue. Suppose that you're wrong about that,\nhypothetically, but you're right about your basic\ninstinct, that they signed a piece of paper saying, we\npromise to dismiss this case in the State court and then\nthey didn't. They just didn't do it. That was your view\nof this. Right?\nMR. ALSOBROOK: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: All right. So have you any\nsuggestion for us about how we might help you achieve that\nultimate objective, and by us, I don't mean this Court\nparticularly. I mean the law. The law should provide a\nway that you get that objective if you're right.\nMR. ALSOBROOK: I would -- the alternative I\nwould suggest is to remand the matter to the Federal\ndistrict court in Mobile with instructions for them to\nfile an injunction or a contempt proceeding against the\nparty --\nQUESTION: But that would be up to you to -- I\nmean, the court doesn't initiate an injunction. You'd\nhave to ask for it. And I assume you would be free to do\nit. If all this Court would decide, if it decided against\nyou, was that the All Writs Act is not available for this\npurpose, that would leave you as though you had never\npursued that route and you could pursue another.\nThere's something curious about this case, and\nmaybe you can -- you can help me understand it. When the\nplaintiff's class counsel in Price went into the Louisiana\ncourt and said, Louisiana court, drop that case, dismiss\nthat case, the defense counsel wasn't there.\nMR. ALSOBROOK: No.\nQUESTION: Why not?\nMR. ALSOBROOK: Your Honor, this is not in the\nrecord but I was that counsel, and I had talked with the\nclass counsel days before, and he assured me that he would\ntake care of it and there would be no problem. We didn't\nanticipate this happening because the language of the\nstipulation of settlement, which the respondent signed,\nwas so specific that we couldn't imagine that the State\ncourt judge would not dismiss it on the motion of class\ncounsel.\nQUESTION: So you were relying on plaintiff's\ncounsel --\nMR. ALSOBROOK: Yes, ma'am.\nQUESTION: -- to do -- to do that job for you\nand felt you didn't need to appear in the State court.\nMR. ALSOBROOK: He actually told us we didn't\nhave to appear, that he would take care of it.\nQUESTION: Mr. Alsobrook, if we disagree with\nyou and reverse the -- and affirm the Eleventh Circuit, we\nwould be affirming a decision that says in its conclusion,\nwe accordingly vacate the district court's order\ndismissing Henson and remand with instructions for the\ncourt to remand Henson to Louisiana State court.\nWe do not, however -- this is part of what it\nsaid -- we do not, however, imply that the district court\nmay not by injunction force Henson's dismissal. So, you\nknow, we wouldn't have to say that -- that our decision\nhere was without prejudice. The decision of the Eleventh\nCircuit was said to be without prejudice. So you -- you'd\nbe able to, as far as the Eleventh Circuit opinion is\nconcerned, get -- get the injunction.\nMR. ALSOBROOK: Yes, sir, but the --\nQUESTION: I wonder why it wasn't -- wasn't more\nefficient for you to seek the injunction instead of coming\nup here.\nMR. ALSOBROOK: Well --\nQUESTION: I guess -- I guess --\nMR. ALSOBROOK: -- Justice Scalia --\nQUESTION: -- your answer is better to have two\nbites at the apple than one. Right?\nMR. ALSOBROOK: Yes, sir. And --\nQUESTION: Even if you lose here, you can then\nseek the injunction.\nMR. ALSOBROOK: And also because the majority of\nthe circuits have approved the procedures that we followed\nin this case. You have the Second Circuit; you have the\nSixth, Seventh, and Eighth. And --\nQUESTION: Well, what was the reasoning of those\ncircuits?\nMR. ALSOBROOK: The reasoning of those circuits\nwere that they had retained jurisdiction to enforce their\njudgments. For example, if you take NAACP II -- rather,\nNAACP I, the court remanded the case to the circuit court.\nNAACP II, the court said that because they had retained\njurisdiction in an order, that they could go forward under\nthe All Writs Act.\nQUESTION: And what -- did they specify what\nkind of a writ it was they were talking about?\nMR. ALSOBROOK: No, sir.\nQUESTION: I should think that might have made\nyou a little hesitant to rely.\nMR. ALSOBROOK: Well --\nQUESTION: It's a good defense to a malpractice\naction.\nMR. ALSOBROOK: Well, we had to rely on what the\ncourts were telling us, Your Honor -- I mean, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nQUESTION: Were those cases in which there were\ntwo -- two different districts involved?\nMR. ALSOBROOK: The Agent Orange case, there\nwere two different districts, yes.\nQUESTION: But all of them were not, were they?\nMR. ALSOBROOK: No.\nQUESTION: Weren't some of them -- yes.\nIt seems to me it's quite different if you're\nremanding to the court where the problem arose than\nremanding to a different court.\nMR. ALSOBROOK: That's right.\nQUESTION: Yes. Or removing, rather.\nMR. ALSOBROOK: That's right.\nQUESTION: Do you wish to save the --\nMR. ALSOBROOK: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: -- remainder of your time for\nrebuttal?\nMR. ALSOBROOK: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Very well.\nMr. Bederman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. BEDERMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. BEDERMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe All Writs Act may not be relied upon to\nremove an otherwise unremovable case. It is Congress's\nprovince to define the limits of removal, and chief of\nthese is the requirement of original jurisdiction in\nFederal court.\nQUESTION: Mr. Bederman, I just asked your --\nyour friend to -- to explain why he was up here. Why are\nyou up here? Because even if you win, the case will --\nyou know, don't you think that an injunction will issue?\nMR. BEDERMAN: Very likely Mr. Alsobrook will\napply, as the Eleventh Circuit invited them to, for an\ninjunction. Such an injunction could proceed because\nunder this Court's decision in Parsons Steel, the State\ncourt has yet to issue a conclusive ruling about\npreclusive effect. And therefore, they're at liberty to.\nWe are, by no means, conceding the -- the substantive\nmerits of the injunction motion whether they would have a\nsubstantial likelihood of success on the merits, but we\nwould certainly agree that they have the ability to file\nan injunction immediately.\nQUESTION: Why -- why -- okay. What -- what is\nat issue on the merits?\nMR. BEDERMAN: The issue on the merits would be\npresumably the proper construction of the settlement\nagreement --\nQUESTION: Of the settlement agreement?\nMR. BEDERMAN: That's right. And, of course,\nwhether an injunction, narrowly tailored to the parties,\nwould, as -- as the Justices have already indicated, be\nproperly addressed to the parties to order dismissal of\nthe case.\nQUESTION: Okay. So you -- you would -- you\nwould contest the injunction just as you're --\nMR. BEDERMAN: We would contest the merits of\nthe injunction. We would not context the ability of them\nto file for the --\nQUESTION: You can say in a sentence -- as I\nread this, it says, class counsel hereby stipulates that\nthe related case, including any and all claims, will be\ndismissed. And then it defines related case to refer to\nHurley Henson by number in the State of Louisiana.\nMR. BEDERMAN: That's right, Justice Breyer.\nQUESTION: So I'm just curious what the defense\nwould be.\nMR. BEDERMAN: The only defense that -- that I\ncould imagine is the ambiguity in that provision, as you\nwere reading, at 38a of the joint appendix, that the\nconcern about whether including any and all claims,\nincluding without any limitation any claims defined\nherein. And what has not been made clear is that there\nwere subsequent amendments to the stipulation, which made\nclear that certain classes of claims were excluded.\nQUESTION: Well, I guess that isn't before us\nhere --\nQUESTION: It's not before us.\nQUESTION: -- is it?\nMR. BEDERMAN: Certainly not, Justice O'Connor.\nWhat's before this Court is what is the proper procedural\nmechanism to be used here.\nQUESTION: And several circuits have allowed the\nAll Writs Act to be used in this fashion, do you think?\nMR. BEDERMAN: In this fashion? Yes, Justice\nO'Connor. That clearly this is what I would characterize\nas a newfangled procedural device that was launched by the\nSecond Circuit after the Yonkers and Agent Orange cases;\nthat it has developed, as I think Mr. Alsobrook fairly\ncharacterizes, a momentum of its own in the court of\nappeals.\nQUESTION: In the Yonkers case, the United\nStates Government urged the court to take that position,\ndidn't it? So it wasn't something newfangled that the\ncourt dreamed up on its own when it was the Department of\nJustice urging it.\nMR. BEDERMAN: That is true, but my recollection\nof -- of the procedural background with the Yonkers case\nwas that there was some concern about how Judge Sand\ndrafted the consent decree in that case. He -- as was\nlater acknowledged, Judge Sand had been perhaps misled by\ncertain representations made by the Archdiocese of New\nYork and therefore he did not include a provision that\nwould allow for a subsequent injunction or -- or a\nretention of jurisdiction. That may have led the court in\nthat circumstance to invoke All Writs Act.\nBut there, again, the complete alternative was\nan injunction that could have issued in these New York\nland use proceedings that were pending in State court. So\neven in Yonkers, which presents, I think, analytically a\nvery different context here, not a preclusion case, not a\ncase that turns on the construction of an earlier Federal\ncourt judgment or settlement, there was the availability\nof injunctive relief. In that case, the Second Circuit\nbypassed that -- that reasoning and went straight towards\nan All Writs Act basis --\nQUESTION: But you said you would defend against\ninjunctive relief on the ground that the settlement was\nnarrower than --\nMR. BEDERMAN: We would defend essentially on\nthe merits, is that an injunction should not issue because\nour construction of -- of the settlement is --\nQUESTION: Well, why didn't you seek that\nconstruction from the court that issued -- that -- that\nentered the settlement? Why go to another Federal court?\nLouisiana doesn't know anything about this case -- instead\nof saying, Alabama Federal District Judge, please clarify\nthe scope of the settlement so that we can either go on\nwith our case or know that we can't?\nMR. BEDERMAN: We believe that the proper course\nis -- in view of the precise enumeration of the -- of the\ncase in State court, that the proper course was to amend\nthe petition and seek a resolution.\nMr. Henson and his counsel could have very well\ninitiated an entirely new case and evaded the terms of --\nof the settlement in that fashion. They agreed and\ndecided that the proper course, the more forthright course\nwas to seek leave to amend the petition to make clear that\ncertain claims were dropped by virtue of the earlier\nsettlement, but there were remaining claims in play. And\nit was believed that this was the most forthright approach\nto -- to use here.\nI would credit, Justice Ginsburg, that it may\nhave been equally appropriate to go back to the Federal\ncourt, seek a declaratory judgment or some kind of\ndecision in that fashion. But I believe that this course\nwas certainly honest and forthright on the part of counsel\nbelow.\nI -- I hardly think it may be necessary to\nindicate that the All Writs Act does not confer\njurisdiction under 1441, as was already made clear in\ncertainly the questioning and certainly in view of\npetitioners' discussion. Original jurisdiction has always\nbeen required and has been upheld in countless cases. And\nmoreover, the All Writs Act textually demands that Federal\ncourts issue writs, quote, \"in aid of their respective\njurisdiction.\"\nPetitioners' argument essentially would read out\n\"respective\" from that provision in the All Writs Act in\nsection 1651. Clearly the All Writs Act does not\nindependently grant original jurisdiction, and this has\nbeen consistently upheld by this Court for nearly 200\nyears from the McIntire decision in 1813 to as recently as\nClinton v. Goldsmith in 1999.\nMoreover, issuance of writs under the All Writs\nAct is certainly conditioned by the statutory requirement\nthat such be necessary or appropriate. And as this Court\nindicated in Pennsylvania Bureau of Corrections, this is\nessentially a threshold requirement for invocation of the\nAll Writs Act. And in the Goldsmith case, as recently as\n3 or 4 years ago, this Court made clear that the All Writs\nAct can't be used as a form of cure-all to -- to fix what\nwould otherwise be the availability of other statutory\nmechanisms which are not otherwise complied with.\nQUESTION: What would be wrong with the Eleventh\nCircuit saying in substance it's the same thing? What\nwe're trying to do is to stop this litigation from going\nforward in Louisiana. So even though the defendants used\nthe wrong device, we'll treat it as though it had been in\napplication for an antisuit injunction?.\nMR. BEDERMAN: Well, if -- if, of course, the\nEleventh Circuit had construed petitioners' filings in\nthat way and -- and had indicated that injunction was the\nproper mode and essentially substituted, as they -- as\nthey seem to invite in their closing lines of their\ndecision, I think that would be appropriate. But there is\ncertainly a difference in form and in content between a\nremoval and a narrowly tailored injunction, and I think\nthe Eleventh Circuit was correct.\nAnd other courts of appeals that have so held\nhave indicated that there are profound federalism concerns\nthat are implicated in allowing essentially a common law\nwrit of removal to be used to evade what is Congress's\nrole in dictating the mechanism for removal and -- and\npatrolling the boundary and the balance of authority\nbetween State courts and Federal courts in this country.\nThere is, as -- as the Court indicated, no such\nthing as a -- as a common law writ of removal. There was\nno analogy in English common law at the time of the\nfounding. The -- a writ of certiorari, as Justice Breyer\nindicated, would have been -- could have been potentially\ndirected, I would agree, to -- to courts. But in no\ncircumstance was there analogy in English common law for\nthe court of one sovereign to remove cases from -- from\nanother sovereign. And unless we delve into a kind of\nobscurantist legal history, I think that would be clear.\nBut there was, in fact, no analogy for that. And in\ntruth, there's no such thing as a writ of removal --\nQUESTION: Administrative agencies.\nMR. BEDERMAN: I presume that in English common\nlaw, to the extent that administrative agencies existed,\nthe ones I'm aware of, of course, were quite inchoate.\nIt's potential that you --\nQUESTION: Sewer commissioners, I think is --\nMR. BEDERMAN: That's right. Or -- or sanitary\ncommissions in London. One might imagine that.\nBut again, at issue here is -- is removal, which\nthis Court has always indicated is a creature of statute\nbecause of the profound federalism concerns.\nAnd essentially what -- what petitioners would\nhave this Court do is allow, by use of the All Writs Act\nor analogous theories of ancillary enforcement\njurisdiction, to achieve what is otherwise unavailable by\nstatute. And as this Court clearly said in the\nPennsylvania Bureau of Corrections case, although the All\nWrits Act empowers Federal courts to fashion extraordinary\nremedies when the need arises, it does not authorize them\nto issue ad hoc writs whenever compliance with statutory\nprocedures appears inconvenient or less appropriate.\nIf I can say just a word or two about ancillary\nenforcement jurisdiction, to the extent to which\npetitioners appear to be relying on it. This Court has\nsaid very clearly in both Kikkonen, where the Court\nindicated that ancillary enforcement jurisdiction may be\nused in view of what courts require to perform their\nfunctions, and in Peacock, where the Court made very clear\nthat ancillary enforcement jurisdiction is a creature of\nnecessity, there can be no showing of necessity here by\nvirtue of the availability of alternate mechanisms,\nwhether in the form of an injunction properly issued\nagainst the parties and consistent with the relitigation\nexception under the Anti-Injunction Act, or even,\npreferably, recourse to State courts to properly rule on\nthe preclusive effect of earlier Federal court judgments\nand settlements, as this Court made clear.\nQUESTION: What about contempt? I suppose you\ncould have been -- your client could have been held in\ncontempt in that court, couldn't it? I mean, assuming\nyou're wrong -- that he's right --\nMR. BEDERMAN: In the -- in the Federal court.\nAnd of course, obviously sanctions were imposed below by\nthe Federal district court, and that's, of course, not --\nno longer at issue before this Court, but that court has\nthat power.\nSo certainly there are a variety of mechanisms\nto ensure compliance with -- with court orders. It is not\nrespondent's submission to suggest that we take an\nimportant tool out of the toolbox of Federal courts in\norder to maintain the dignity and the enforcement of their\njudgments. But --\nQUESTION: A number of courts that have allowed\nthe 1651 All Writs removal have said that they thought\nthat that was less offensive. That was more faithful to\nthe federalism concern, that -- that issuing an antisuit\ninjunction was more offensive to the State than this\nremoval device.\nMR. BEDERMAN: I would respectfully disagree\nwith that characterization. The assumption seems to be\nthat the injunction would somehow issue to the State\ncourt, and as of course we all know, that would never be\nthe case. That truly would be offensive. The -- the\ninjunction would issue to the parties, however, with\ninstructions to -- to dismiss or an even maybe even more\nnarrowly tailored instrument.\nQUESTION: Well, it may be that a particular\nremedy in a particular situation might be less offensive\nto federalism, but that's a concern that should be\naddressed by Congress, isn't it --\nMR. BEDERMAN: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: -- in view of this statute?\nMR. BEDERMAN: Absolutely. It is -- if Congress\nwishes to address the availability of removal in this\nclass action context -- and there is pending legislation\ntoday to that effect -- Congress is free to do so.\nQUESTION: And -- and if Congress wants to be\nmore offensive, it presumably can.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BEDERMAN: I wouldn't speak to the\npropensity of Congress in those circumstances, but they\ncould also amend the Anti-Injunction Act to also change\nthe balance of power between State courts and Federal\ncourts. We take no issue with that.\nYour Honors, unless there are any further\nquestions.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Bederman.\nMr. Alsobrook, you have 7 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY B. ALSOBROOK, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. ALSOBROOK: Excuse me. Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nI think Justice Breyer was correct when he\npointed out that the stipulation that was entered into is\nreally not ambiguous. The Eleventh --\nQUESTION: That's not -- I don't think that's\nbefore us, Mr. Alsobrook.\nMR. ALSOBROOK: All right.\nQUESTION: I mean, I don't think whether or not\nyou might be entitled to an injunction, should you seek\none, is -- is presented by the -- your question.\nMR. ALSOBROOK: Yes, sir.\nWell, Your Honor, I would say that at the time\nthat we removed this also we relied on NAACP II, and there\nthe Court said that if there are two alternatives that --\nand they also pointed out a footnote 3 in the Kikkonen\ncase which said that an injunction could be issued where\nthere are two alternatives that -- that you can choose\nbetween one or the other, and that the -- the\nAnti-Injunction Act does not preclude the remedy under the\nAll Writs Act.\nSo we realize that the Court is not a\nlegislative body and that it has been brought out here\nthat Congress is the one that can -- can dictate the\njurisdictional bounds of Federal courts. But by the same\ntoken, Your Honor, we have a great number of class action\nsettlements that are pending in this country that have\nbeen already consummated in this country, and we face a\nsituation where the settling party who has settled a\nnational class action must have some kind of remedy to\nstop suits in State courts that attempt to thwart that\nclass action settlement. And so we would ask the Court to\nconsider that in its -- in its deliberations.\nIf there any further questions?\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Alsobrook.\nMR. ALSOBROOK: Thank you, Your Honor.\n"
