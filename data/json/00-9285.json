        "content": "(10:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in No. 00-9285, Walter Mickens, Jr. v. John Taylor,\nWarden.\nMr. Wagner.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT J. WAGNER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. WAGNER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nOn April 3rd of 1992, Judge Foster dismissed\ncriminal charges against Timothy Hall. She noted on the\ndocket, case removed from docket, defendant deceased, and\nthen signed her name. 3 inches above that reference on\nthat docket sheet was the name, Bryan Saunders, in big\nletters, court appointed counsel for Timothy Hall.\nOn April 6th of 1992, warrants charging Walter\nMickens with the capital murder of Timothy Hall came\nbefore Judge Foster. Judge Foster telephoned Bryan\nSaunders and asked if he would receive the appointment on\nthat case. He accepted that appointment.\nThis case presents this Court with the\nextraordinary circumstances of a judge appointing a lawyer\nto a death penalty case when that judge knew or reasonably\nshould have known that the lawyer represented the victim\nat the time of the victim's death. As a consequence,\nWalter Mickens has been deprived his constitutional rights\nunder the Sixth Amendment to conflict-free representation.\nQUESTION: In the U.S. -- in the Public\nDefender's Office, couldn't this situation arise fairly\nfrequently? Sometimes in a small office, somebody in the\noffice would have represented a victim many years before\non a totally different matter.\nMR. WAGNER: Yes, it could.\nQUESTION: All right. Well, if it arises fairly\noften, then what kind of a rule would you suggest? I\nmean, does it mean that they have to -- public defenders\nhave a hard time. I mean, they -- they can't -- you know,\nthey -- they can't have a thousand people in their office,\nand sure enough, some members of the people -- sometimes\nthis will happen. So, what kind of rule would you\nsuggest?\nMR. WAGNER: Well, the rule that's in place\nhere, the rule from Holloway v. Arkansas, the rule from\nCuyler v. Sullivan, the rule from Wood v. Georgia, is an\nappropriate rule, and it's appropriate because it requires\nthat the trial judge or the -- or the judge in the case\nknows or reasonably should know that there is, in fact, a\nparticular conflict. So --\nQUESTION: But, Mr. Wagner, what difference\nshould it make from the point of view of the defendant\nwhether the judge knew or the judge didn't know? You make\na sharp distinction between this case where the judge\nknew. But suppose Mickens didn't know and the judge\ndidn't know. Why should Mickens be worse off? In both\ncases he doesn't know.\nMR. WAGNER: Well, in Holloway v. Arkansas, this\nCourt announced a rule which if a defense attorney\npresents to the court an objection on the basis of a\nconflict of interest, and the court fails to inquire into\nthat conflict, then prejudice is presumed. And the focus\nof the Holloway decision was on the court's responsibility\nto inquire into that conflict.\nQUESTION: But I was asking you what the rule\nshould be, not the rule -- I probably wasn't specific\nenough. I can't necessarily reconcile all the cases. So,\nif we were starting from scratch and you had a lawyer in a\n-- in a public defender's office who many years before had\nrepresented a victim, what should the rule be about\nwhether he can represent this person before him?\nMR. WAGNER: Well, the rule should be, first of\nall, if the -- if the court knows or reasonably should\nknow --\nQUESTION: Forget whether the court knows or\ndoesn't know.\nMR. WAGNER: Then it should be if there's an\nactual --\nQUESTION: I want to know what the rule should\nbe.\nMR. WAGNER: If there's an actual conflict, Your\nHonor, as opposed to a particular --\nQUESTION: That doesn't help me. If the facts\nare that many years before the person represented the\nvictim on a different matter. Now, what kind of a\nstandard is the judge supposed to apply?\nMR. WAGNER: If the -- the attorney is compelled\nto refrain from doing something because of his ethical\nobligations to the victim, if there's that compulsion by\nthat defense attorney where he can't do certain things for\nhis --\nQUESTION: Fine. I got it. That's helpful.\nThen why not just say, and that's what you have\nto do here? The judge should look into whether or not\nyour client was significantly harmed in the way you just\nsaid because his lawyer couldn't do a proper job given the\npreceding representation. Why isn't that just -- that\nwould take care of all these cases just as you say.\nMR. WAGNER: Well, and if -- if the -- the judge\nin this case had conducted that inquiry properly and had\ndetermined whether or not Mr. Saunders had that -- that --\nthe compulsion to refrain from doing something on behalf\nof Mr. Mickens, then in fact that would have been cured\nright away and we wouldn't --\nQUESTION: Fine. So, now he didn't do it. Why\nnot just send it back and tell him, do it?\nMR. WAGNER: Send it back and tell him to -- to\ndo the inquiry?\nQUESTION: Say where there's that prejudice, you\nlose; if there isn't that prejudice, you don't.\nMR. WAGNER: Well, because this Court has -- has\nprovided that there's a fundamental right to conflict-\nfree representation.\nQUESTION: Didn't -- didn't the district court\nfind against you on the -- on the point of whether there\nwas an adverse effect?\nMR. WAGNER: They did in fact, Your Honor.\nBut that's not what the question before the\nCourt is. According to Wood v. Georgia --\nQUESTION: The question before the Court is\nwhether, in addition to a Sixth Amendment violation, you\nhave to show an adverse effect.\nMR. WAGNER: That's right. That's right, Your\nHonor.\nAnd we -- we would suggest to the Court that\nunder Wood v. Georgia, we aren't compelled to show an\nadverse effect. All we need to show here is an actual\nconflict.\nQUESTION: But your answer to Justice Breyer --\ncorrect me if I'm wrong -- was that there had to be some,\nat least strong possibility of adverse effect in the\ninstance where he represented the victim years before.\nMR. WAGNER: And that's exactly what\ndistinguishes actual conflict from adverse effect. With\nan actual conflict, there's a compulsion to refrain from\ndoing something. With adverse effect, there's an actual\nlapse in representation, and -- and that's a significant\ndifference --\nQUESTION: Well, but here it seems to me that\ntwo inquiries tend to become conflated in a case like\nthis. If there's no adverse effect, that shows that there\nwas no conflict.\nMR. WAGNER: Well, I would suggest --\nQUESTION: And -- and that's quite different\nfrom a case where there's multiple representation over the\ndefendant's -- over the counsel's objection. I mean, we\ncould say that in that line of cases, prejudice is\napparent from the record. It -- it -- a burden on counsel\ninheres intrinsically in the representation to which he\nobjects.\nBut that's not -- there -- there are hundreds of\ndifferent kinds of conflicts. The -- the defense attorney\nis a candidate for the prosecuting attorney in an upcoming\nelection. One attorney has been interviewed -- the\ndefense attorney has been interviewed for a position in\nthe DA's office 4 weeks before.\nAll of these things you say there's an absolute\nrequirement of a new trial without any inquiry into\nwhether there's an adverse effect? This is an astounding\nproposition.\nMR. WAGNER: Your Honor, I would suggest,\nthough, that the key issue here is in the trial court's\nduty to -- to inquire into a conflict that it knew or\nreasonably should have known. And that was the focus of\nHolloway v. Arkansas.\nQUESTION: Yes, but Holloway and Cuyler were\nboth multiple representation cases where the trial court\ncould see the whole thing right before him at that time.\nThis was not a multiple representation case.\nMR. WAGNER: Your Honor, I agree. But I would\nsuggest that in this type of case, it's even more\ndangerous for the defendant that the court doesn't\ninitiate the inquiry. In that case, at least the court\nknows and the defendant knows that the co-defendant is\nbeing represented by the same attorney. In this case, Mr.\nMickens never knew that his -- that his attorney had a\nconflict.\nQUESTION: May I ask if -- if in your view would\neverything have been satisfactory, as a constitutional law\nmatter, if the judge had said, go ask your client if the\nclient has any objection, and the client had said, no, I\nhave no objection? Would that have taken care of it?\nMR. WAGNER: Well, I believe that the court\nshould have indulged in some inquiry of the client\nhimself. The court should have asked the client if he\nunderstood everything that was involved in waiving that\nconflict. And in this situation --\nQUESTION: Excuse me. You're -- you're\npresuming a conflict. I -- I really don't follow your\nargument for that -- whether the judge had an obligation\nto inquire into a conflict about which he knew or should\nhave known. What he should have known was -- was not the\nexistence of a conflict, but simply that this defendant --\nthat the deceased had previously been represented by\ncounsel who's representing this defendant. That does not\nconstitute a conflict.\nThe -- what follows from that -- from that\nrelationship? Does anything follow other than the fact\nthat the lawyer cannot, in -- in a subsequent\nrepresentation, disclose any confidential information\nwhich he learned in the prior representation. Right?\nIsn't that the only thing that follows?\nMR. WAGNER: Well, it is that, but there's also\nethical consideration 4-5 of the Virginia Code of\nProfessional Responsibility which states that anything\nobtained by Mr. Saunders through his representation of\nHall could not be used to Hall's disadvantage.\nQUESTION: That's fine, but that doesn't show a\nconflict. That shows at most the potential of a conflict,\nand -- and you're representing it here as though there is\na conflict and -- and the judge had an obligation to\ninquire into it. But the whole issue is -- is whether\nthere was a conflict. That hasn't been established at\nall.\nMR. WAGNER: Well, I believe it has, Your Honor,\nand it's been established because Mr. Saunders in this\ncase obtained confidential information from Mr. Hall.\nThat's clear from the record. The district court found\nthat. And in preserving those confidences of Mr. Hall, he\nwas precluded from doing certain things.\nQUESTION: Would you -- would you say what they\nwere? Because it seemed to me that some of the things you\nlisted were just matters of record and not at all -- there\nwas one conversation between this lawyer and the client.\nWe know it took place for 15 to 30 minutes, and that was\nit. And a number of your recitations do involve matters\nof public record that would not involve betraying any\nclient confidence if Saunders brought them out. So, what\nwas it that Saunders knew that was not available to the\npublic?\nMR. WAGNER: First of all, all of this happened\nin -- in juvenile domestic relations court, and under\nVirginia law, all of those files, all of that information\nfrom that case was confidential and couldn't be revealed\nto the public.\nBut nonetheless, even if it was public, under\nethical consideration 4-4 of the Virginia Code of\nProfessional Responsibility, which governed Mr. Saunders\nat that time, he was absolutely required to preserve the\nconfidences and secrets of Mr. Hall regardless of the\nsource or nature of those confidences --\nQUESTION: So what? So what? Why does that\nconstitute a conflict? Unless you connect up that\nconfidential information which he knew with something that\nwas relevant to the defense of his new client, there's no\nconflict.\nMR. WAGNER: I want to get to that point, and\nthe point is that in death penalty cases, it's absolutely\nessential that the attorney looks into the background of\nthe client. In this case --\nQUESTION: You're asking for a special rule in\ndeath penalty cases?\nMR. WAGNER: I'm not, Your Honor. I believe --\nQUESTION: Well, they why do you -- why do you\nstress the fact this a death penalty case?\nMR. WAGNER: Well, I also stress the fact that\nthis is a sex case, Judge. This is a case of forcible\nsodomy, and also in that type of case, it's absolutely\nessential for the attorney to look into the background of\nthe defendant --\nQUESTION: Well, isn't -- wouldn't that be true\nin most criminal cases?\nMR. WAGNER: It would be true that the -- the\nattorney should look into the -- the background of the\nvictim. Absolutely, Judge. But I think it's particularly\ntrue because of the sentencing phase in a death penalty\ncase. In the sentencing phase of the death penalty case,\nthe attorney needs to -- or the team of attorneys need to\nlook into the background of the victim, need to engage in\na -- in brainstorming about the background and an\ninvestigation about the background. And Mr. Saunders\ncouldn't engage in that brainstorming, couldn't engage in\nthat investigation because he had to preserve those\nconfidences, and he had a duty of loyalty to Mr. Hall.\nQUESTION: Well, this may not get us very far so\nfar as a general rule is concerned, but isn't your\nargument, insofar as this case is concerned, pretty much\nundercut by the fact, number one -- let's take an example.\nLet's take the issue that you -- you rightly stress about\nthe response to the victim impact evidence, the -- the\nmother's testimony. Isn't your case pretty much undercut\nhere by the fact that the information, on the basis of\nwhich defense counsel could have responded to the mother's\ntestimony, had already been published in a newspaper?\nAnd isn't it also undercut by the fact that\nthere was co-counsel here and there is no claim that co\ncounsel had any conflict, actual or potential. So, if we\n-- even if we accept your -- your premise that proof of\nconflict would be enough in this situation, don't you lose\nanyway?\nMR. WAGNER: Well, as to the newspaper issue,\nYour Honor, under ethical consideration 4-4, it doesn't\nmatter where the information is in the public. That\nattorney has an absolute responsibility to maintain those\nconfidences and secrets.\nQUESTION: But there's no confidence --\nQUESTION: It's no longer a secret. How can you\nkeep a secret that is no longer secret?\nMR. WAGNER: Well, because the ethical\nconsiderations in the Virginia Code of Professional\nResponsibility required Mr. Saunders to do that.\nQUESTION: Require somebody to keep a secret\nthat is something that is no longer a secret? I don't\nthink that's what they require.\nMR. WAGNER: Well, I don't believe that -- that\nan attorney under those circumstances can pursue anything\nfrom the confidences and secrets that he --\nQUESTION: All right. But I -- I don't --\nQUESTION: He can pursue it from the newspaper.\nHe doesn't have to pursue it from his confidential\nknowledge. He can pursue it from -- from the newspaper.\nMR. WAGNER: I would simply suggest, Your Honor,\nthat that's contrary to what is -- is provided in the\nVirginia Code of Professional Responsibility.\nQUESTION: All right. I find that -- I find\nthat hard to accept, but I'll accept it for the sake of\nargument.\nMR. WAGNER: As far as --\nQUESTION: And that gets us to co-counsel.\nMR. WAGNER: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Co-counsel wasn't bound by that\nbecause co-counsel hadn't represented the victim.\nMR. WAGNER: That's right. That's right. But\nthe fundamental right to conflict-free representation is\nnot that you -- you have unconflicted counsel. It's that\nyou have conflict-free representation. The fact that he\nmay have had 10 unconflicted attorneys makes no difference\nin this case. The fact that he has one conflicted\nattorney is enough to poison the well.\nQUESTION: One apple spoils the whole barrel? I\nmean, is --\nMR. WAGNER: I'm sorry?\nQUESTION: I mean, one bad apple spoils the\nwhole barrel?\nMR. WAGNER: That's what we're suggesting. If\nthat one bad apple was, in effect, trying to sabbotage the\ndefense in that case --\nQUESTION: Well, is there -- is there anything\nclose to that sort of a showing here, that this -- the\nlawyer was trying to sabbotage the defense?\nMR. WAGNER: No.\nQUESTION: Then why -- why do you make that\nstatement?\nMR. WAGNER: Well, because if a rule of law is\nto be promulgated in this case, I think that needs to be\nanticipated.\nQUESTION: Well, but you're saying that if -- if\na person, say, has a team of six lawyers, if there's one\nwith a conflict of interest, the whole case has to be\ntried over.\nMR. WAGNER: If you can show, under Holloway v.\nArkansas, under Cuyler v. Sullivan, under Wood v. Georgia,\nthat there was, in fact, either an actual conflict and\nadverse effect or in the event where the judge failed to\ninquire into a conflict that that judge --\nQUESTION: But I thought you were telling us you\ndon't inquire about an adverse effect. I thought that's\nyour whole point. Correct me, please, if I'm wrong. I\nthought you were arguing --\nMR. WAGNER: I may have misspoken.\nQUESTION: I thought you were arguing to us the\nproposition that it is wrong to inquire into adverse\neffect. Once there has been a failure on the part of the\ntrial court to inquire, that's the end.\nMR. WAGNER: That -- that's right, but in the --\nQUESTION: So then -- so then your argument\nwhether there's an adverse effect is completely contrary\nto your own proposition.\nMR. WAGNER: I'm sorry, Your Honor. I was\nspeaking more generally about general conflict of interest\ncases where an attorney may be there to -- to sabbotage\nthe defendant. In that situation, if there was no duty of\nthe trial court to inquire, then you would have to go the\nactual conflict/adverse effect analysis, and that question\nwill have to be addressed.\nBut if you're just dealing with a situation in\nwhich the -- the judge knew or reasonably should have\nknown of the conflict and failed to inquire, then of\ncourse, you're absolutely right. There would be no --\nQUESTION: This is the -- this is the second\ntime, Mr. Wagner, you've referred to an attorney being\nthere to sabbotage the defendant. You feel that's\nsomething that fairly frequently happens?\nMR. WAGNER: Well, I'm not saying that it fairly\nfrequently happens.\nQUESTION: I would think you would be very\ncareful about making a statement like that.\nMR. WAGNER: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Then why did you make it?\nMR. WAGNER: I made it because I think it's a\ncompelling point. I believe that -- that it can happen.\nQUESTION: Why is it a compelling point if it\nhardly ever happens?\nMR. WAGNER: Well, it may very well be in this\ncase that Mr. Saunders was trying to sabbotage. We don't\nknow all of the confidences and secrets that he obtained.\nWe don't know everything about his reasons for accepting\nthis case knowing that he had represented the victim in\nthis case and performing in this case in the way he did,\nfailing to look into a consent defense in this case,\nfailing to investigate critical information in this case.\nWe --\nQUESTION: All right. So, if you're right then\non this point, then there was loads of prejudice.\nMR. WAGNER: Well, there would be if we had --\nQUESTION: All right. So, what are we supposed\nto do then in your view?\nMR. WAGNER: What -- what --\nQUESTION: I mean, use -- send it back? I\nthought they found no prejudice. So --\nMR. WAGNER: The district court, in fact, found\nno prejudice, Your Honor.\nAnd -- and what we're saying in this case is,\nfirst of all, to adopt the rule of Wood v. Georgia, the\nrule where if we show an actual conflict --\nQUESTION: Mr. Wagner, may I stop you there?\nBecause it seems to me, reading the Wood v. Georgia case\nand those facts, in those -- in that case the actual\nconflict and the adverse effect coincided. If the lawyer\nwere loyal to the employer and the employer was interested\nin setting up a test case, then that very conflict would,\nat one and the same time, establish the adverse effect.\nTherefore, I could not take from the Wood case what you\nare urging this Court to take.\nAnd if that's so, then the Wood case is in no\ndifferent category. It's a case where adverse effect has\nbeen claimed and the two are not distinguishable.\nMR. WAGNER: I understand, Your Honor. And --\nand if you look to the Cuyler v. Sullivan case, Cuyler v.\nSullivan very specifically draws out a test in which you\nmust show both actual conflict and adverse effect. If you\nthen look to the dispositional paragraph of Wood v.\nGeorgia, that speaks only of actual conflict, and it\nspeaks of it three times. In Wood v. Georgia, the only\nrequirement upon a showing that the defense attorney had\nnot inquired into the conflict but that the judge knew or\nreasonably should have known of the conflict is that there\nbe an actual conflict showing. And again, it's three\ntimes in the dispositional paragraph.\nQUESTION: But if, on the facts of that case,\nthose two are opposite sides of the same coin -- there's\nno -- if you show one, then you inevitably show the other\n-- then how can we extract the words of the decision from\nthe fact background against which Justice Powell was\nwriting?\nMR. WAGNER: I don't believe that you\nnecessarily show one by showing the other. In an actual\nconflict situation, it's really the potential of a lapse\nin representation that the Court focuses on. When you get\nto the actual -- the adverse effect, then it is the actual\nlapse of -- of -- in representation. So, it's the\npotential in the actual conflict versus the actual lapse\nin the -- in the adverse effect, the impeded\nrepresentation in that case. So --\nQUESTION: Well, you are making a nice statement\nin the abstract. I'm trying to bring it down to earth in\nthe Wood case, and I said, well -- you answered both\nquestions if the employer has a conflict -- if the lawyer\nhas a conflict because the employer's interest diverges\nfrom the employee's.\nMR. WAGNER: Yes. And in that case, the Court\ndid actually find -- in Wood v. Georgia, did find an\nactual conflict, found that there were competing\ninterests, and sent it back to the trial court to\ndetermine whether or not there was an adverse effect.\nQUESTION: I thought the Court found nothing\nbecause it raised this question on its own. It was never\nbriefed and argued.\nMR. WAGNER: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: And we said you find out about this,\nlower court. We were supposed to hear another question\nentirely. We found that there is this lurking issue that\nshould be decided first. There was no briefing. How can\nyou use that as establishing a whole new category, a case\nlike that where the -- the Court didn't even have the\nbenefit of briefing on the issue?\nMR. WAGNER: Well, again, I would point to the\ndispositional paragraph and the very language, the precise\nlanguage of the case of Wood v. Georgia that said, we --\nyou know, if -- if the defendant fails to inquire and if\nthe judge knew or reasonably should have known or if the\ndefendant fails to advise the court of a conflict and if\nthe -- the court knew or reasonably should have known of a\nconflict and failed to inquire, all that needs to be shown\nis an actual conflict, and didn't mention adverse effect.\nThat -- that's as specific as I can get in -- in that\nspecific case.\nAnd you're right, Your Honor. I misspoke. They\ndid not find an actual conflict but sent it back to the\ncourt to determine if there was an actual conflict, back\nto the -- to the court that -- that did the probation\nrevocation hearing in that case to see if there was, in\nfact, an actual conflict. And -- and that's what the\nCourt found, just that the court had to find an actual\nconflict, and if it did find an actual conflict, then that\ncase appropriate for reversal. And that's what we're\nasking.\nQUESTION: I take it in any case at this point\nyou're not claiming the benefit of the Holloway rule.\nMR. WAGNER: Well, we are, Your Honor. We --\nQUESTION: Well, but as I -- you correct me if\nI'm wrong, but I thought if -- if you had the benefit of\nthe Holloway rule, you wouldn't have to show even an\nactual conflict.\nMR. WAGNER: That's correct, but -- but it is\nthe part --\nQUESTION: Are you -- are you arguing that we\nshould adopt that rule? I mean, if we did, that would --\nthat would answer the point that has just been raised.\nMR. WAGNER: No. I -- I believe that the\nHolloway rule was extended in Cuyler v. Sullivan, but the\nHolloway rule focuses on the court's failure to inquire.\nQUESTION: No. But you started -- at least, as\nI recall back in your brief, you started out by arguing\nthat what puts the court on notice doesn't matter so long\nas the court is on notice. You said in Holloway counsel\nraised it before the court, and you're saying in this\ncase, under the -- at least the rule that the court should\nhave known of the -- of the potential conflict, that was\nthe functional equivalent to counsel's raising it in\nHolloway, and therefore the result should be the same.\nAs I understand Holloway, if the result were to\nbe the same, we would not even look any further into the\nquestion of actual conflict. We would say if there was\nenough to put the court on notice, reverse. And I take it\nyou're not arguing for that now, or are you?\nMR. WAGNER: We are not, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. WAGNER: And the reason we're not is because\nof the component of Holloway v. Arkansas that deals with\nthe defense attorney's advisement of the court of the\nconflict and -- and the importance that that --\nQUESTION: So, you're -- you're -- maybe I -- I\nmisunderstood your position when I was running through the\nbriefs, but you're not taking the position that Holloway's\ncounsel's advice to the court should be equated with the\ncourt's kind of obligation under the should have known\nstandard that you argue for here. You're not equating\nthose two.\nMR. WAGNER: I'm sorry. I don't understand --\nQUESTION: I thought in your original argument\nyou were saying, look, in Holloway defense counsel said,\nthere's a problem, judge. Here the judge knew or should\nhave known about the problem. Those two facts are\nequivalent, and I take it now you're not saying those two\nfacts are equivalent.\nMR. WAGNER: They're equivalent to a certain\nextent, but the fact that the defense attorney raised it\nto the court has a certain significance. As the Solicitor\nGeneral indicates in their -- in their brief, there is\nsome significance to the defense attorney raising that\nissue to the court and the court's compulsion to inquire\ninto it at that point. It's not as significant as the\ntrial court's role in inquiring into that conflict, but it\nis significant. And Wood v. Georgia takes that\nsignificance, that component into effect when it requires\nan actual conflict, a showing of an actual conflict --\nQUESTION: But, counsel, I'm a little puzzled at\nthis point too. It seemed to me that you would have no\ncase if the judge were not on notice of the potential\nconflict.\nMR. WAGNER: Well, I believe --\nQUESTION: You're not -- you're not arguing that\na lawyer could have this relationship and keep it secret\nfor 5 years and then come around and say, now set aside\nthe conviction.\nMR. WAGNER: Well, Your Honor, we would say that\nthe adverse effect prong would not be required under the\ncircumstances where the judge knew, but we're not\nconceding that we can't satisfy the adverse effect prong.\nBut you're right, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Well, but we're taking the case on\nthe assumption there's been a hearing and there's been\nevidence that established an absence of adverse effect.\nAt least I thought that's the way the case comes to.\nMR. WAGNER: That-- that's what the district\ncourt found.\nQUESTION: So, I thought the key to your case\nwas the fact that the judge had a duty, when advised or on\nnotice of a potential conflict of interest, of making an\ninquiry as to find out whether in fact there was such a\nconflict. I thought that's your whole case.\nMR. WAGNER: That -- that is the focus of our\ncase.\nQUESTION: Is that -- is that your -- see, I\ndon't -- you -- you haven't put it that way. You --\nyou've put it that if the judge knew or should have known\nof the conflict. Now, is that it? Which is it? You've\nsaid this morning if he knew or should have known of the\nconflict. Is that he should have known of the conflict or\nshould have known of the potential conflict?\nMR. WAGNER: Well, in Cuyler v. Sullivan, it\ntalks to a particular conflict.\nQUESTION: No. I'm -- I'm asking you what your\nposition is.\nMR. WAGNER: My position is --\nQUESTION: -- you look at the question\npresented --\nQUESTION: No.\nMR. WAGNER: Knew or should have known of a\nconflict.\nQUESTION: That's not your question presented by\nyour blue brief. It's potential conflict. That's what\nyou put in your brief. Now you're changing your position?\nMR. WAGNER: Well, I don't mean to change my\nposition, Your Honor, but a potential conflict in the\ncontext of where we have it in the brief would -- would\nessentially equal a particular conflict. So, it is a\npotential conflict --\nQUESTION: Well, but -- a very different\nquestion. You mean whenever there's a potential conflict,\nif the -- if defense counsel had -- had represented the\nvictim 20 years ago on a totally unrelated matter, there\n-- there's always some confidential information he might\nhave obtained. The judge always has to inquire into that?\nMR. WAGNER: That's true, Your Honor.\nNo. If -- but if the judge knows --\nQUESTION: Well, how potential does potential\nhave to be then?\nMR. WAGNER: Potential has to be, as Cuyler\ndescribes, a particular conflict. If -- if the judge\nknows that there's some information that that attorney may\nhave obtained from a previous client, that there's some\nkind of conflicting interest that needs to be probed.\nQUESTION: No, no. That may be conflicting.\nMR. WAGNER: That may be conflicting. That's\nright. There is the potential for damage to the\ndefendant. It's that potential that the -- the judge\nneeds to inquire. It's the peril that the defendant finds\nhimself in by being represented by a conflicted attorney\nthat the judge has a responsibility to --\nQUESTION: 20 years ago. Is that enough of a\nperil?\nMR. WAGNER: In that case, it's very difficult\nto -- to imagine how the judge would have known of that\nconflict. So --\nQUESTION: But he knew about it.\nMR. WAGNER: If he knew about it, then -- then I\nwould suggest that that judge should at least inquire,\njust take the very -- the very reasonable measure, the\nvery simple measure of inquiring into the conflict. It\ntakes a very short amount of time, and you -- you\nalleviate the problem of all the litigation that we've had\nin this case.\nIf I may reserve the remainder of my time, Mr.\nChief Justice.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Wagner.\nMr. Harris, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT Q. HARRIS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. HARRIS: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please\nthe Court:\nThe Fourth Circuit correctly required a showing\nof adverse effect for Mickens to establish a conflict of\ninterest claim. There is a rule. The Court has\nestablished a rule and the general application for\ndeciding conflict of interest claims, and it was decided\nin Sullivan. It's consistent with the repeated admonition\nof this Court, that in order to claim an interference with\nthe right to counsel, you have to show that it had some\neffect on the representation. Sullivan states the Sixth\nAmendment standard. Justice Breyer, the rule that you're\nlooking for is in Sullivan.\nQUESTION: Well, Holloway doesn't stand for that\nproposition, does it? Holloway is consistent with what\nyou said?\nMR. HARRIS: Well, Sullivan explicitly --\nQUESTION: I'm asking you about Holloway.\nMR. HARRIS: Well, Sullivan explicitly carves\nout Holloway.\nQUESTION: Do you think Holloway is good law or\nnot?\nMR. HARRIS: Holloway is -- is not been\noverruled. It is perfectly good law.\nQUESTION: Well, that didn't require any showing\nof adverse effect.\nMR. HARRIS: What the Court said in Holloway is\nthat relying on the representations of counsel that there\nwas a conflict of interest and that he would be unable to\nexamine his multiple clients, the failure to inquire into\nthat was itself error.\nAnd I think if you -- you can put Holloway into\nthe exact same terms of the Sullivan over-arching\nstandard. The fact that counsel has taken these steps of\nadvising the court that he sees a conflict of interest,\nthe fact that counsel tells the court, when they get to\ntrial, that he is not able to examine his several clients\nbecause of the confidences he knows, that is, as -- as\nHolloway said, relying on counsel being in the best\nposition to know. That is persuasive evidence that, in\nfact, the conflict existed. And obviously, the impact on\nthe representation in that circumstance is evident.\nThe -- the --\nQUESTION: May I ask you this question? Do you\nthink the lawyer in this case had a duty to tell his\nclient that he had represented the victim? Just an\nethical -- not a constitutional duty, as an ethical\nmatter.\nMR. HARRIS: The district court found that he\nshould have -- under the rules of ethics, he should have\nadvised his client of the fact that he had previously\nrepresented Tim Hall.\nQUESTION: And then the next question I have is\ndo you think -- again, not necessarily a matter of\nconstitutional law, but that it would have been good\npractice for the judge to inquire of the lawyer whether he\nthought there had been any -- any difficulty in the\nrepresentation?\nMR. HARRIS: I -- I certainly agree that it\nwould have been good practice both for defense counsel and\nfor trial -- the trial -- well, in this case it wasn't a\ntrial court. It was a juvenile court that -- that made\nthe appointment. Certainly it would be a good practice.\nI think that is part and parcel of what Sullivan was\nsaying when it is encouraging trial courts to make those\ninquiries even on facts that may not be based on the\nobjection of counsel or the defendant.\nQUESTION: Would you say it was unethical for\nthe lawyer not to have revealed to the court and his\nclient not what is the better practice, but that it was,\nin fact, a violation of the ethical constraints for the\nlawyer, knowing that he had represented the victim, not to\ntell his client so his client could make the choice\nwhether to keep the lawyer or not?\nMR. HARRIS: I cannot make the final call on\nwhether it was ethical or not. We have an independent\nbody in Virginia that is -- is there to do that very\nthing, the Virginia State Bar.\nI would agree, as the district court said, that\nthe obligations, the ethical obligations, of counsel would\nbe to provide disclosure of such information to his -- to\nhis client.\nThe -- it is the next step that you are, I\nguess, deliberately not taking that -- that I would have\nto say that that is not the type of conflicting interest\nthat would -- that was being addressed in the Sullivan\nstandard for finding a Sixth Amendment violation.\nQUESTION: In other words --\nQUESTION: And I wasn't -- I wasn't asking you\nany question about the Constitution. I was asking you\nabout the ethical canons that govern lawyers.\nMR. HARRIS: I --\nQUESTION: Does the lawyer have a duty to advise\nthe client of a potential conflict?\nMR. HARRIS: There is a general duty of counsel\nto advise his client of any circumstances which the client\nwould want to know, as far as matters that may affect the\nloyalty of counsel to client. That is the general and\naccepted ethical statement. Certainly that is an\nobligation that was Mr. Saunders' obligation at the time\nof this case.\nQUESTION: May I ask -- take it one step further\nand turn away from the ethics to the Constitution? What\n-- what would you say about a case of the same facts, but\nthe -- the client tells the -- the client finds out about\nit and asks the judge to relieve the lawyer because the\nclient doesn't want a lawyer who represented the -- the\nvictim? Would the judge have a constitutional duty to --\nto discharge counsel?\nMR. HARRIS: Well, the -- I think Holloway I\nthink doesn't make a distinction between the defendant\nhimself or his client. So, in that very circumstance, the\njudge would have a duty to inquire. That much I think is\nclear from Holloway.\nQUESTION: No. I've given you the facts. The\n-- the client -- all the client says is, I don't trust a\nlawyer who's represented the man that I'm accused of\nkilling. I would like a different lawyer. Would the --\nwould the judge have a duty to give him a different lawyer\nas a constitutional matter?\nMR. HARRIS: No. I would say this, as this\nCourt pointed out in Wheat, the judge certainly has the\ndiscretion, a very broad discretion at that point in time,\nto anticipate the possibility of conflicts and to\nsubstitute counsel on the risk, on the possible danger of\na conflict appearing later on.\nQUESTION: What -- what if the lawyer says that?\nWhat -- what if the lawyer says that? I don't feel\ncomfortable representing this -- this defendant because --\nbecause I represented the decedent that he's accused of\nmurdering. The same question as -- as --\nMR. HARRIS: I understand.\nQUESTION: -- Justice Stevens, only it's -- it's\ncounsel who --\nMR. HARRIS: And the answer is -- is essentially\nthe same as well. If counsel is representing to the -- if\nthat can be interpreted as representing to the court that\nhe is objecting to representing this man because of his\nprior representation, the court has to inquire.\nNow, of course, the duty that Sullivan and\nHolloway set out, as far as the duty to inquire, is not a\nduty to grant relief. It's a duty to inquire to determine\nwhether or not there is a risk that the Sixth Amendment\nrights will be jeopardized.\nQUESTION: Well, except in Holloway exactly that\nhappened. The -- the lawyer said, judge, I can't\nrepresent these three defendants, and the judge said, you\ngo ahead and do it.\nMR. HARRIS: Well, that's --\nQUESTION: And -- and this Court reversed.\nI read the opinion as saying that in this case\nthe conflict is apparent on the face of the record. The\n-- the attorney is -- is -- has such a burden that it --\nthe conflict inheres in the very objection the attorney\nmakes. You don't even need to look any further. That's\nthe way I read that opinion.\nMR. HARRIS: I think that is exactly what\nHolloway gets to. The point is when counsel makes the\neffort of telling the judge that he sees a conflict of\ninterest and that he cannot do his job effectively, that\nessentially makes out the Sixth Amendment violation.\nQUESTION: Going back to the earlier questions\nabout the counsel's ethical duty, as you understand it,\nquite apart from the Constitution, is there a duty of\nloyalty to the former client or just a duty of maintaining\nconfidentiality?\nMR. HARRIS: After the close of the\nrepresentation of a former client, I -- I believe that the\ngeneral duty of loyalty devolves down to that duty of\nmaintaining the confidences of your former client. That\nis how the duty of loyalty is represented. I -- I don't\nthink we can impose a -- even an ethical obligation on\ncounsel to continue to have good feelings about a former\nclient or -- or this general notion of having once\nrepresented an individual, he is forever subject to the\nattorney's care.\nQUESTION: The trouble I'm having with the\nstandard is not whether the judge happens to know he\nshould have looked in or shouldn't have looked into it,\nwhich were unusual circumstances. If a lawyer is under a\nreal conflict -- a real one, a very serious one, a\nterrible one -- his client cannot get effective\nassistance. So, I would have thought that's the standard.\nMR. HARRIS: I believe that is --\nQUESTION: Did the client get effective\nassistance or not?\nMR. HARRIS: I believe it is.\nQUESTION: Now, the difficulty comes up because\nthe lawyer doesn't normally tell him, just like any other\nineffective case, and now the judge has to decide what is\nand what is not ineffective assistance. So, to do that in\nthe conflict category, do we just look to the ABA rules?\nThey're often quite attenuated.\nWhat do we use to decide whether the conflict is\nserious enough so the client couldn't get effective\nassistance? Once he didn't, I guess you do presume\nprejudice because you can't go back and second guess every\nsecond of what the lawyer was doing. But what's the\nstandard?\nMR. HARRIS: Well, again, Sullivan addresses the\nvery concern. It indicates that counsel must be actively\nrepresenting conflicting interests before we have a\npresumed prejudice. He must have an actual conflict\nadversely affecting --\nQUESTION: And what is that -- so, that's --\nit's exactly at the time you say the words actual\nconflict, that I think have gotten me mixed up in these\ncases.\nMR. HARRIS: Well, of course --\nQUESTION: And sometimes they mean one thing,\nsometimes another.\nMR. HARRIS: Well, I don't think there's any\ninconsistency in this Court's cases on --\nQUESTION: No, maybe not. But whether there is\nor not, can we do better than saying actual conflict?\nShould we say actual conflict creating ineffective\nassistance? Should we say look at the ABA rules? What\nshould we say in your opinion?\nMR. HARRIS: Well, I would take us back to\nSullivan because what Sullivan was doing was identifying\nwhat the lower courts had already been doing prior to the\ntime of its decision, which was finding something called\nan actual conflict. And what that involved was\nidentifying diverging interests, inconsistent interests,\nessentially potentially conflicting interests, and then\nlooking to see whether or not that existence of diverging\ninterests actually had any effect on the representation.\nNow, the lower court decisions often spoke --\nQUESTION: This is what confuses me about this\ndiscussion. I'm -- I'm not -- sometimes it seems to me\nthat -- that we're equating the existence of an actual\nconflict with prejudice. Is that what you're saying, that\n-- that when you show an actual conflict, there is\nautomatically prejudice? I -- I didn't understand that to\nbe the law.\nMR. HARRIS: No, and that's not what I'm\narguing.\nQUESTION: I understood it to be the law that no\nmatter how actual and apparent the conflict is, if it had\nnot effect on the trial, there's no foul.\nMR. HARRIS: I would argue that it is the\nadverse effect that makes a potential conflict actual.\nQUESTION: Then how do you explain Holloway?\nMR. HARRIS: Holloway I think can easily be\nexplained as the -- the adverse effect and actual\nimpairment of defense counsel's ability to conduct the\nrepresentation --\nQUESTION: But that -- all --\nMR. HARRIS: -- was provided by his own\nstatement.\nQUESTION: I think all you can say for sure in\nHolloway was that there was an actual conflict. There was\nno showing of what effect that conflict had upon the\nrepresentation.\nMR. HARRIS: Again, what Sullivan said about\nHolloway was that Holloway did not find an actual\nconflict. So, I will stop short as well.\nQUESTION: Well, there was no finding in the\nsense that the Court made a formal finding. I think what\nJustice Scalia was -- in any case, what I've been assuming\nis what Justice Kennedy said a moment ago, that when\ncounsel in a multiple representation situation says,\njudge, I can't go on representing all of these people,\nthat the conflict is so obvious that we'll take it as a\ngiven. And -- and I'm -- I'm inclined to read Holloway\nthat way.\nMR. HARRIS: Well, perhaps --\nQUESTION: The conflict is so obvious or the\nprejudice is so obvious?\nQUESTION: Well, the conflict is -- is so\nobvious because it seems to me -- and this was going to\nget to my next -- my -- my question to you.\nIsn't the difference -- reading Holloway the way\nI am reading it, isn't the difference between Holloway and\n-- and Sullivan something like this? We realize that if,\nthrough no fault of anybody, through the -- the client was\nnot asleep, the judge was not asleep -- it nonetheless\nturns out later that there was a conflict, we want to make\nsure that that conflict actually had an effect on\nrepresentation before we -- we start reversing\nconvictions. But if there was reason to believe in\nadvance, if somebody told the judge like the lawyer in\nHolloway, that there is a problem here, we want to have an\ninducement on the trial court to pursue that problem right\nthen and there. And in order to get that inducement,\nwe're going to have a rule that says, you don't have to\nprove effect. All you have to prove is conflict. In\nother words, in order to induce the trial courts to be on\ntheir toes, the defendants later on have a lesser burden.\nDo you think that's the way to read Holloway and\nSullivan together? And do you think that is a sensible\nrule?\nMR. HARRIS: I substantially agree with that,\nwith the following caveat. I don't think that Holloway\nnecessarily is saying the actual conflict as a separate\nconcept, actual conflict. It's so evident that we will\npresume prejudice. I think they are saying that in those\nparticular circumstances where the matter is objected to\nand brought to the trial court's attention, both the\nactual conflict and the expected prejudice from the\nattorney telling the judge he cannot represent all of the\npeople are so obvious that --\nQUESTION: Well, isn't that what Holloway is\ntalking about? Expected prejudice basically. If the\nattorney says I can't represent these people, instead of\nletting it go ahead and prove that he's right, which you\nhave every reason to think he's right, you simply say,\nwe'll have to stop right now.\nMR. HARRIS: Well, we are giving a great deal of\nweight to trial counsel's ability to know because he is\nthe only person that has the access to the confidences of\nmultiple clients who will know for certain, or at least\nwith a high degree of certainty, that there is going to be\na conflict and that it will affect the representations of\nthe various clients.\nBut to -- if I could get back to your question,\nthere is a difference, I think, in the circumstance where\nthe attorney has made that representation to the trial\ncourt, which I think is the same as saying I see an actual\nconflict that will affect my representation.\nQUESTION: If we want -- you know, I realize\nthat, but if -- if we want to keep the trial judges on\ntheir toes -- and having been a trial judge, I can tell\nyou that inducements do matter -- doesn't it make sense to\ntreat the -- the knowledge that the appointing judge has,\nin a case like this, as being the equivalent of the -- of\nthe objection by counsel?\nMR. HARRIS: No.\nQUESTION: Why -- why not equate them?\nMR. HARRIS: I think it is -- it is fair to say\nthat the trial judge's notice of facts that would cause\nhim to -- to perceive a -- the language that the Court\nused was a particular conflict. But the notice of that\ncertainly imposes an obligation upon him to inquire into\nit. But I don't think you can then say that having\nknowledge of facts that would suggest an actual conflict\nor even suggest a particular conflict can be equated with\nthe attorney's representation that it exists.\nQUESTION: Okay. The trouble -- the trouble is\nif you follow -- I mean, I think I follow your -- your\nargument. But if I -- if I understand you correctly, then\nnothing is really added to the law by saying the trial\njudge has an obligation to inquire into it because when we\n-- when we come at the -- at the question after the fact,\nthe trial judge hasn't inquired, there's been a trial,\nthere's been a conviction, then the issue of conflict gets\nlitigated.\nMR. HARRIS: Well, that is --\nQUESTION: On your -- on your rule we proceed\nunder the same standards whether or not the trial judge\nshould have known. Isn't that right?\nMR. HARRIS: It is not so much my rule. It is\nthis Court's rule. That's what Sullivan said.\nQUESTION: No, but I mean, regardless of who it\nbelongs to, on the -- on the argument that you are making,\nthe -- the standards are exactly the same whether the\njudge should have known or should -- need not\nnecessarily --\nMR. HARRIS: As far as ultimately finding --\nQUESTION: But -- but the world changes. I -- I\nassume that trial judges generally do what we say they're\nsupposed to do.\nMR. HARRIS: That -- that is correct.\nQUESTION: Now, it may mean it may well be that\nif they don't, nothing happens afterwards, but usually\nthey'll do what we suggest. Won't they?\nMR. HARRIS: Well, it -- it is true that the\nState judges and Federal judges -- lower Federal judges\nall are sworn to uphold the same Constitution.\nQUESTION: It didn't seem to happen here,\nthough, did it?\nQUESTION: May I suggest that the -- the problem\nis not the bright line distinction between potential\nconflict and actual conflict, but rather the serious --\nthe potentially serious character of the conflict.\nAnd your point is that the lawyers in Holloway\nmade it clear to the judge it was a serious problem.\nWhereas, here it's not all that apparent because it may\nhave been just a routine appointment of the public\ndefender's office that just happens. But if this lawyer\nhad been the family attorney for the victim for the last\n30 years and knew them intimately and so forth, I think\nyou would agree then the judge had a greater duty of\ninquiry than he might have had here.\nMR. HARRIS: I would say to the extent that you\nmake the two relationships, the between representations\nmore connected -- and you can certainly do that by virtue\nof a personal relationship -- you inch your way along --\nQUESTION: It was more likely to be prejudicial\nwould be the point. If it's reasonably likely to the\njudge to know -- I mean, if it's reasonably apparent on\nthe face of the matter, whether said by the lawyer or just\nfrom the facts, that there's a real danger of prejudice\nhere, you would agree the judge has a duty of inquiry, I\nwould think.\nMR. HARRIS: I -- I certainly agree that the\njudge's duty of inquiry is -- is presented at a much\nlesser level than actual prejudice to the defendant. And\nit's obvious these things should be taken care of --\nQUESTION: Okay. But does that -- does that\nduty of inquiry have any consequence later in the\nstandards by which the case will be judged on, say,\ncollateral attack?\nMR. HARRIS: No, and for a very simple reason.\nYou do not have the one ingredient that you have in\nHolloway v. Arkansas. You do not have the representation\nof counsel, the person in the best position to know, that\nin fact he sees a conflict and he sees the impairment. In\nfact, you have the opposite. The fact that counsel has\nnot raised any matter to the trial court when he is in the\nbest position to know and when he does not see that there\nis a conflict sufficient enough to call to the court's\nattention over -- for an objection to be resolved, we have\na different record. In that case --\nQUESTION: Why does it -- from the defendant's\nvantage point, why should it make a difference? He's got\na counsel who has betrayed his obligation. He doesn't\nknow anything. The client doesn't know anything. Why is\nMickens, who has a lawyer who doesn't tell the court --\nwhy is -- would he be better off if the -- the judge knew\nor should have known than when nobody knows and he's\ntotally in the dark? From the defendant's point of view,\nthe judge's knowledge isn't significant. It's that he has\na lawyer who is not totally able to represent him with\nundivided loyalty.\nMR. HARRIS: Again, that is included within the\nnotion that we have one Sixth Amendment standard for\nconflicts of interest regardless of whether or not the\ntrial judge was on notice of some facts that could have\nprompted the inquiry, that we will go beyond that standard\nin the circumstances such as Holloway where the attorney\nhimself has made it an essential fact of the case that he\nhas identified a conflict and impairment in his case.\nThe difference is not so much that the -- I\nmean, I guess the -- the answer is the defendant is not\nentitled to a different or more lenient standard of review\nof his conflict claim, you know, because of the judge's\nfailure to act on notice of additional facts. It doesn't\nget us any closer to determining whether or not there\nactually was an infringement of his Sixth Amendment\nrights. To assume it on the basis of a judge's failure to\nact on notice, it simply --\nQUESTION: And what is -- what is the test for\ndetermining whether there was an impairment? You're not\nsaying you have to be able to show that the defendant\nmight have been acquitted --\nMR. HARRIS: No.\nQUESTION: -- or might not have gotten the death\npenalty.\nMR. HARRIS: No. The --\nQUESTION: So, what is -- what is the nature of\nthe impairment?\nMR. HARRIS: Well, the Court is using the\nadverse effect to -- as a -- as a lesser showing of\nprejudice. As an example, it is not so much that a\ndefendant would have to show Strickland prejudice, a\nreasonable probability of a different outcome, but he\ncertainly has to show the likelihood that trial counsel's\nconduct or assessment of different defenses in the case\nwas affected, not --\nQUESTION: Thank -- thank you, Mr. Harris.\nMr. Gornstein, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWhen a district court has reason to know about a\npotential conflict and fails to initiate inquiry, the\nSixth Amendment is violated only when there is a showing\nof an actual conflict and an adverse effect on the quality\nof performance. And we say that for three reasons.\nFirst, it is a central tenet of this Court's\nSixth Amendment jurisprudence that a Sixth Amendment\nviolation does not occur unless there has been prejudice\nto the defense. It would be inconsistent with that basic\nprinciple to set aside a jury verdict and order a new\ntrial with all the societal costs that entails when --\nQUESTION: I must interrupt you here, though.\nThe prejudice standard under -- under Strickland is not\nthe standard we're talking about here, is it?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: It is not. Under Sullivan,\nthere has to be an adverse effect on the quality of\nperformance, but it is still -- from that, there is\ninferred prejudice. It would be inconsistent with the\ncentral thrust of showing some kind of prejudice to\nreverse a conviction, set aside it, and -- and order a new\ntrial when there has been no showing that the quality of\nrepresentation has been affected.\nAnd in Sullivan, the Court held --\nQUESTION: Well, let me just push that all the\nway. Supposing in -- in Holloway itself the judge said,\nwell, I -- I really think you -- he thought it through and\nsaid, I think you could represent both. Could he have\njust gone ahead and insisted on the lawyer representing\nthem?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: In -- in Holloway, if there's no\ninquiry conducted by the judge, there's automatic\nreversal.\nQUESTION: The question here is when does the\njudge have a duty of inquiry.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: The judge --\nQUESTION: Are you saying he never has a duty of\ninquiry unless there's going to be actual prejudice?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: No. I -- I think that what the\nCourt said in Wood about the duty of inquiry and -- and --\nthis is somewhat vague, I will agree, but it said there\nhas to be a clear possibility of a conflict.\nQUESTION: All right. Supposing there's a clear\npossibility of prejudice, but no actual proof of\nprejudice, is that enough to impose a duty of -- of\ninquiry on the judge?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: There's a duty of inquiry, but\nif the duty is not fulfilled and a trial is held and a --\nthere's a conviction and the defendant is seeking to\noverturn his conviction, at that point the defendant still\nmust show an actual conflict and an adverse effect on the\nquality of his representation.\nQUESTION: We've been trying to find a way to\ndistinguish Holloway from this case. One way is to say\nthat multiple representation is so fraught with\ndifficulties that it's simply a separate category.\nAnother is to say that the likelihood of an adverse effect\nis so significant, so serious that we'll presume it.\nAnother is to say that the conflict itself is much more\nserious in most cases than -- how would you --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: I would say that there would --\nQUESTION: How would -- how would you have us\ndeal with Holloway?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: I would say that Holloway is a\nspecial case where prejudice was presumed conclusively\nbased on two factors. The first is that deference to the\ncontemporaneous judgment of counsel that he was operating\nunder a disabling conflict, and when he's representing\nthat he's operating under a disabling conflict, it's not\njust a representation that he has a conflict, but that\nthis is going to affect his performance. He's not going\nto be able to represent the defendant adequately.\nAnd the second is that prejudice inheres in the\nsituation in which a judge orders a defense counsel, over\nhis objection, to continue representation even though the\nattorney believes he is not going to be able to perform\nadequately.\nAnd those two circumstances together create a\nper se rule of prejudice, and it's a carve-out from the\nSullivan rule.\nQUESTION: Does Wood stand for a similar\nproposition, or is Wood different?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Now, Wood is a situation where\nthe Sullivan rule was applied in a case in which there was\nreason to know a clear possibility of an actual conflict.\nAnd what the Court said in that circumstance is that the\nConstitution would be violated if it was found that the\nlawyer had a -- a conflict that influenced his basic\nstrategic decisions. And that is the same exact test as\nthe Sullivan test. There not only has to be a showing of\nan actual conflict but an effect on performance for there\nto be a Sixth Amendment violation.\nQUESTION: Are you saying Wood is an effect\ncase.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: It is both an actual conflict\nand effect. That's what it directs when it says the words\nactual conflict --\nQUESTION: So, you're saying in this case if the\nlawyer had said to the judge, my client doesn't trust me\nbecause I -- I represented the decedent and he won't be\ncandid with me, then the judge would have had a duty to\ndischarge counsel.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: I'm not saying that they -- he\nwould have had a duty to discharge counsel. He can\ninquire --\nQUESTION: Why would that case have been\ndifferent from Holloway?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: He can -- first of all, Holloway\nis a situation where the lawyer himself is representing\nthat he cannot adequately represent --\nQUESTION: Correct. It's because my client\ndoesn't trust me.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Well, if he represents that he\ncannot adequately represent the -- the defendant, and then\nthe district court has to conduct an inquiry. And if the\ninquiry reveals that in fact representation can be\nadequately given, then the judge need not dismiss. But if\nthe judge concludes that adequate representation cannot be\ngiven, then the judge should dismiss.\nQUESTION: No matter how severe the conflict. I\nmean, no matter how -- in your view, no matter how severe\nthe conflict, still unless you can show that it actually\naffected the lawyer's representation, it is not a\nconstitutional error.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: After a trial has been held and\nthe defendant is seeking to overturn his conviction,\nthat's correct.\nQUESTION: Well, Strickland doesn't say that.\nStrickland says that it's important to maintain a fairly\nrigid rule of presumed prejudice for conflicts of\ninterest.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Yes, but Strickland goes on --\nQUESTION: Should we change Strickland?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: No. No, because Strickland goes\non to say that in that situation, prejudice is presumed\nonly where there's been an actual effect on -- on\nperformance, both an actual conflict and an adverse effect\non performance. What Strickland says is the defendant\ndoesn't have to show the additional burden that is -- that\nis present in most Strickland cases of showing there's a\nreasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would\nchange. But what -- Strickland reaffirms Cuyler v.\nSullivan, which requires both an actual conflict and an\neffect -- an adverse effect on performance.\nQUESTION: Suppose the victim were the fiance of\nthe lawyer's niece and the lawyer was very close to the\nniece, and he says, I can't do this, judge. I -- I can't\nrepresent this murderer.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Well, then you have a Holloway\nsituation if the -- if the defendant -- defense counsel is\nrepresenting that he's operating under a disabling\nconflict and the judge doesn't conduct an inquiry, then\nthere's automatic reversal at that point. That's the\nHolloway carve-out.\nQUESTION: In the worst case, when the lawyer\nsays nothing, you end up not getting rid of him -- I mean,\nor not -- assuming prejudice --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Well, there's a -- there's a --\nQUESTION: But in the case where he's more\nhonest about it and comes straightforward, then you're\ngoing to presume the prejudice.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: But that's because of the\nreasons for Holloway have to do with the deferring to the\ncontemporaneous representation of a counsel that he is\noperating under a disabling conflict and that is given\ndeference, together with the fact that when somebody is\nordered to -- to provide representation over his\nobjection, that a certain amount of prejudice inheres in\nthat. And that's why the Holloway rule is as it is.\nAnd in this situation where that's not there and\nthe defendant is seeking to obtain a new trial with all\nthe societal costs that that entails, it is not too much\nof a burden for him to be able to identify a particular\nway in which --\nQUESTION: Of course, the irony of the rule is\nthat it gives greater protection when the lawyer is --\nconceals -- unethically conceals a known conflict than\nwhen he's candid with the court.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: There's a certain amount --\nQUESTION: And the argument -- that's the\nargument here, that in order to get the higher rate of --\nof fees for representing a defendant in a capital case, he\ndidn't want it to be known that -- that he represented --\nyou know, had this prior --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: That -- that was the argument,\nbut the district court found against the --\nQUESTION: I understand that.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: -- against the defendant on both\nof those points. The district court carefully examined\nthe questions of whether there was a conflict and whether\nthere was an adverse effect. Those were the correct\ninquiries.\nAnd the argument that's being made here is that\nyou can skip the second step, and it's our submission that\nunder Cuyler against Sullivan and under Wood and under\nthis Court's general Sixth Amendment jurisprudence, there\nhas to be a showing of an adverse effect on the quality of\nrepresentation.\nIf the Court has nothing further.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Gornstein.\nMr. Wagner, you have 3 minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT J. WAGNER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. WAGNER: Thank you, Your Honor.\nThe thrust of the respondent's argument here is\nthat Holloway stands for the proposition that if a defense\nattorney raises an objection to the court and the court\ncompels that representation over that objection, then that\nis where the prejudice is presumed.\nIf you take this argument to its logical\nconclusion, then anytime a defense attorney raises an\nobjection on the basis of a conflict to a court and the\ncourt compels that representation over that objection,\nthen prejudice should be presumed. In other words, when\nyou have a situation where a defense attorney raises an\nobjection to the court, the court properly inquires of\nthat defense attorney about that conflict and properly\nfinds that there is no debilitating conflict here and then\nrequires that -- that defense attorney to proceed with the\nrepresentation, then under what the respondents say here,\nprejudice should be presumed.\nThat's not what Holloway stands for. Holloway\nstands for the proposition that the trial court has the\nduty of protecting the essential rights of the defendant.\nThe trial court has the duty of seeing that the Sixth\nAmendment rights of a defendant are protected. And in\nthis case, the trial court failed in that responsibility.\nIt knew or should have known of that conflict, failed to\ninquire into that conflict and that's where the prejudice\nlies here.\nI thank the Court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Wagner.\n"
