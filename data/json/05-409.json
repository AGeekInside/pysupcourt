        "content": "(10:59 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Kircher v. Putnam Funds Trust.\nMr. Frederick.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID FREDERICK\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThis case concerns the appealability of\nremand orders under the Securities Litigation Uniform\nStandards Act, or SLUSA.\nOur position is that the general rule\nprohibiting appealability applies in this case for\nthree reasons.\nFirst, section 1447(d) has been consistently\nconstrued to prohibit appeal of remand orders based on\na district court's lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\nThat rule governs even if the district court\nincorrectly construes a subject-matter jurisdiction\nprovision.\nSecond, SLUSA section 77p(c) concededly\ndefines removal jurisdiction and it does so by\nincorporating the criteria for preemption. Thus, the\ncourt's subject-matter jurisdiction is coextensive with\nthose cases that SLUSA preempts.\nAnd third, Congress knows how to make remand\norders appealable when it wants to, but SLUSA contains\nno provision for appellate review of remand orders.\nUnder Respondent's approach, the Federal courts would\nobtain jurisdiction in cases not subject to SLUSA\npreemption, but there's no indication that Congress\nintended that result.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Under your approach, Mr.\nFrederick, the Federal court would decide the principal\nsubstantive issue in the case, the principal legal\nissue, nonfactual perhaps, and then decide that is has\nno jurisdiction if it finds that it doesn't come within\n-- within (c), sends it back to the State court. Is --\nis the State court bound by -- by that finding by the\nFederal court?\nMR. FREDERICK: No, it's not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why not?\nMR. FREDERICK: Because under this Court's\nlongstanding precedent, for there to be preclusion,\nthere must be a right of appellate review. So if you\nagree that the general rule of 1447(d) applies and\nthere is no right to appeal the remand order, then the\nbasis on which that order is -- is founded, the\npreemption of SLUSA is open for the State court to\naddress on remand.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And for this Court, I\nassume, at least theoretically, on petition for\ncertiorari?\nMR. FREDERICK: That's correct, through the\nState court system.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what was the basis\nthen, or was there a basis, for Judge Easterbrook's\ncomment, it's now or never?\nMR. FREDERICK: He was wrong. He was wrong.\nThe issue of preemption under SLUSA can be raised by\nthe defendants on remand in the State courts. It can\nbe litigated. It's important to note that the removal\nprovision says, shall be removable. It's at the\ndefendants' discretion whether they want to ask the\nFederal court to test whether SLUSA preempts the case\nor to keep it in State court for the State court to\napply SLUSA and thereby hold that the class action\nwould be unsustainable.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do we have a standard --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do we have any cases that --\nthat are like this one which are like this one which\ninvolve not just res judicata of -- of the -- of the\nfinding by the Federal court, but the law of the case?\nI mean this is the same case when it's remanded.\nYou've already had a court that has found a particular\nelement with respect to this case. It seems to me\nhighly unusual to have the same issue in the same case\nthen decided by a second court. Do you have any -- any\nparallel?\nMR. FREDERICK: There are cases in the lower\ncourts, Your Honor, in the complete preemption area\nthat have held that a removal based on the doctrine of\ncomplete preemption was not sustainable because the\ncase was not completely preempted, but holding that\npreemption, implied conflict preemption, can be applied\nby the State courts on remand.\nAnd it's important to note here that there --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't have any case of\nours, though.\nMR. FREDERICK: Not that I'm aware of, but\nwhat the City of Waco case says, upon which they base\ntheir reliance, is that the reason why there was appeal\nof that particular order was because it would be held\npreclusive. Here, it would not be held preclusive\nbecause there is no right of appellate review.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is -- is there --\ncorrect me if I'm wrong, but I -- I had thought there\nwas an -- an easier answer, and that is that the -- the\ndecision that ultimately the State court will make, as\nto whether there is or is not preclusion, is not\nidentical to the decision that the Federal court --\nthat the district court makes on the motion for remand\nbecause on the -- and this is the way I was going about\nit.\nOn the motion for remand, all a Federal court\ndecides is whether, in fact, there is a colorable basis\nfor the removal. When it goes back, if it does go\nback, to the State court, there will be an opportunity\nnot to go merely to the stage of colorable basis, but\nto litigate it ultimately on the merits. So -- so that\nwhat we have is a -- in effect, a kind of quick-look\nfinding at the Federal level, and that does not\npreclude a -- a complete development of the issue on\nthe merits in the State court, if that's where it goes.\nMR. FREDERICK: That is certainly true,\nalthough I would take issue with the notion of there\nbeing a colorable claim. I don't think that the SLUSA\nremoval is analogous to the Federal officer removal\nstatute where the statute itself says the defense has\nto be under color of law, and this Court in the Mesa v.\nCalifornia case said that phrase is where the colorable\nclaim creates article III jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but do you take\nthe position --\nMR. FREDERICK: But I -- I don't -- sorry.\nIf I could just finish. I don't contest the rest of\nit, which is that on remand, preemption can be\ndeveloped through amended pleadings, through facts that\nare developed --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but you must take\nissue with the this is only a quick determination,\nunless you also agree with -- disagree with Justice --\nJudge Easterbrook when he said, the decision for the\nFederal court is only two things. It's either remand\nor dismiss the action. That is, the Federal court\nunder no circumstances will keep this case for trial.\nEither it will dismiss it outright or it will remand.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, under their theory,\nthough, Justice Ginsburg, the court could, because of\ntheir construction of the removal jurisdiction\nprovision, would retain jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but that was not --\ncertainly not the Seventh Circuit's understanding.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, and we think that that\nposition that they have advanced in this Court is\nincorrect, and I would agree with your postulate that\nwhat the Federal district court does and it has\njurisdiction to do is to decide whether preemption\napplies and then remand the case, or if preemption does\napply, to dismiss it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Whether preemption applies\nor whether there's a colorable basis for saying? I\nthought you were saying that the district court decides\nwhether preemption applies.\nMR. FREDERICK: It does -- it does do that.\nIt's actually --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you don't -- you don't\nagree with what Justice Souter was saying, that all\nit's -- all it's making is a colorable basis.\nMR. FREDERICK: I thought I expressed my\nposition there.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, you take the\nposition that -- and -- and you may well be right, but\nI mean, you take the position that there is a complete\ndetermination on the merits at the -- at the stage at\nwhich the district court rules on the motion to remand.\nMR. FREDERICK: That's -- on the basis of the\nrecord then before it.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you say on the basis\nof the record then before it. I mean, they can -- they\ncan -- can they put in any evidence they want?\nMR. FREDERICK: The court always has the\nauthority to have evidence taken to determine its own\njurisdiction. That's routinely done by district\ncourts.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, as I\nunderstand it, at least the Seventh Circuit's fix on\nthis case was that the Federal courts have adjudicatory\nauthority to do one thing and to do that one thing\nfinally, that is, to decide whether this is a case that\ncannot be brought in any court or whether it's a case\nthat Congress has left over for the States still to\ndeal with. That was the whole theory of the Seventh\nCircuit, that this is no quick look. The -- the\nFederal courts are making a final determination. And I\nthink that would exclude what Justice Souter has\nsuggested.\nMR. FREDERICK: I -- I agree with you that\nthat is how the Seventh Circuit described the opinion\nand what -- what the adjudicatory authority was, and\nthat is why we take issue with the Seventh Circuit. We\ndo think that the State court on remand has any issue\nthat the defendants want to raise before it. All that\nthe Federal district court has done is to decide that\n-- that there was no basis for a SLUSA preemption\nbecause the requisites of subsection (b) had been\nsatisfied.\nBut I want to point out that the issue before\nyou is whether or not that decision, correct or not, is\nappealable. And what is important in the error of the\nSeventh Circuit was that they held that that decision\nwas appealable, and under the Thermtron rule, as\napplied in Gravitt and Things Remembered, even a\ndistrict court decision that is erroneous in its\nconstruction of a subject-matter jurisdiction provision\nis still a remand based on subject-matter jurisdiction\nand therefore falls within the four corners --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, it doesn't -- what\nThermtron says is that we read (d) in conjunction with\n(c). Now, the reason that (c) is relevant here is\nbecause it says, if at any time before final judgment\nit appears that the district court lacks subject-\nmatter jurisdiction, the case shall be remanded.\nPresumably what (c) is thinking of are cases\nwhere subject-matter jurisdiction is not the whole\nissue before the -- the Federal court. It's thinking\nthat subject-matter jurisdiction in certain instances,\nlike a defect in a removal proceeding, is something\nthat the -- that the Federal court could get to prior\nto a final judgment.\nBut here, the final judgment in the Federal\ncourt is the very question of whether this is preempted\nor not. And therefore, I guess what Easterbrook is\nthinking is that that isn't the kind of subject-matter\njurisdiction dismissal to which (c) refers.\nConsequently, it is not within the scope of (d)'s no\nappellate review rule.\nMR. FREDERICK: And our problem with that,\nJustice Breyer, is that all eight district court\ndecisions here thought that they were deciding subject-\nmatter jurisdiction, and they thought that because\nFederal preemption ordinarily is not a basis for\nremoval. And --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. It's no doubt that all\nthe lower courts then would be wrong. But the reason\nhe says that they are wrong is because they looked at\nthe word, subject-matter jurisdiction, in (c) without\nrealizing that the reference in (c) is a reference to\ninstances where subject-matter jurisdiction is not the\nwhole issue; i.e., it's something other than the final\nFederal court decision.\nMR. FREDERICK: It -- it is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That would be the argument\nhe's making. I would like your response.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, functionally it is the\nequivalent of codifying the complete preemption\ndoctrine, which is how SLUSA actually works. And in\nthe complete preemption cases, Beneficial Bank is what\nspells out this --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I agree with you. You would\nalso have to say that the same rule applies, one, to\nthe complete preemption cases and, two, to sovereign\nimmunity determinations under the Foreign Sovereign\nImmunity Act. But he would say that may be so, but\nnonetheless, Judge Easterbrook would say, well, so be\nit. That's what Congress intended. That is wrong to\ndeprive someone of a right to appeal when it turns on a\nmisreading of (c) and an incorporation of the\nmisreading into (d).\nMR. FREDERICK: It would be a strikingly odd\nresult, though, for this Court to reach that, given\nthat Congress has clearly provided for appellate review\nof remand orders in other contexts, including in the\nClass Action Fairness Act, under tribal property\ndisputes, the FDIC, the RTC, and specifically in\n1447(d) itself, civil rights cases. So Congress knows\nhow to do this if that's what Congress had intended.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but isn't the -- isn't\nthe argument --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Frederick, can I ask\nyou a question?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- that in those cases in\nwhich Congress has provided, we -- we are not dealing\nwith a situation in which the -- the removal or not,\nthe preemption or not is the end of the litigation.\nHere, we've got a case in which there -- there are\nbasically two kinds of preemption, as -- as you've\nrecognized. There is -- there is regular preemption,\non the basis of which there may or may not be a\nremoval, and there is a preclusion of any litigation\nwhatsoever.\nAnd in the cases in which Congress has made\nspecific provision, were they -- the instances -- were\nthey instances in which it was the second issue which\nprecluded any litigation whatsoever? The answer may be\nyes. I just don't know.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, I think that the\nclosest analogy, again, is in the complete preemption\narea where the Court has held that, you know, the\nremoval is based on complete preemption, and if that is\nfound by the district court, that functionally\nterminates the litigation.\nBut I would point out that even in the\nFederal officer removal statute, there's no appellate\nreview of a district court's decision that the Federal\nofficer statute was improperly invoked to remove an\naction. So what the securities defendants here are\nasking for is something Congress didn't even give to\nFederal officers.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you one\npreliminary question just to be sure I understand the\ncase. Is it your view -- when the petition for removal\nwas filed, did the district -- Federal district court\nhave jurisdiction to decide the preemption issue in\nyour view?\nMR. FREDERICK: It had the -- it had the\npower to determine whether SLUSA applied.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: All right.\nMR. FREDERICK: And that's what section\n77p(c), when it says, as set forth in subsection (b),\nis referring to. So the district court analyzed those\nfactors and it came --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So the -- there -- there\nwas jurisdiction in the Federal court to entertain the\nremoved case.\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Then -- then why -- then\nhow can you say the -- the remand was based on a lack of\n-- of jurisdiction?\nMR. FREDERICK: Because the courts held that\nthe requisites of SLUSA of subsection (b) had not been\nsatisfied.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but they -- they had\nheld it acting on an interpretation of SLUSA before our\ndecision in Dabit.\nMR. FREDERICK: That's correct.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And isn't it at least\npossible that they would -- would have decided that\nissue had they reviewed --\nMR. FREDERICK: It is possible, but that's\nwhy the issue of the underlying district court's\ndetermination is not before you. The issue before you\nis can appellate jurisdiction be asserted to review\nthat decision.\nBut I would further point out, Justice\nStevens, that the Dabit court assiduously avoided the\nkinds of claims that are present in our case, which is\nwhether or not negligence can be asserted against the\nsecurities defendants for failure to fair-value price.\nDabit was strictly a fraud case, as this Court made\nclear. This is a negligence case, and there is a part\nof subsection (b) which makes very clear that what\nSLUSA is getting at are claims based on fraud.\nBut even if you were to disagree that the --\nthe district court had, you know, an alternate basis\nthat had not been properly ventilated or addressed by\nthe district court because it went off on the holder\ntheory that this Court rejected in Dabit, you still\nwouldn't have jurisdiction to decide that because of\nthe general rule of 1447(d), which provides, as I have\nstated, that a court doesn't have jurisdiction to\nreview -- appellate review of a remand order.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, will --\nwould you please explain something to me that you just\nsaid? You said that our complaint isn't about fraud.\nIt isn't about deception. It's about negligence. But\nthe Seventh Circuit reported and seemed to have no\ndoubt about it that the complaints in this set of cases\nwere based on allegations of deceit and manipulation,\nnot mismanagement.\nMR. FREDERICK: That's incorrect, Justice\nGinsburg. We've put the complaints before you. They\nare in the joint appendix. We have cited every\nparagraph in which those claims are asserted.\nThe Seventh Circuit based its decision about\nthat on a misunderstanding of the colloquy at oral\nargument in the Seventh Circuit, which Respondent's have\nrecited the Web site. You can listen to the argument\nyourself. It did not contain any type of concession by\ncounsel for the class that these claims were anything\nother than the negligence claims, which on the four\ncorners of the complaint, they assert themselves to be.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the Seventh Circuit\nsaid precisely, in particular, they did not argue in\ntheir briefs and did not maintain at oral argument,\ndespite the court's invitation that their suits allege\nmismanagement rather than deceit or manipulation. So\nis that totally wrong, that you did do it -- mention it\nin your briefs?\nMR. FREDERICK: The briefs recounted what the\nclaims are, which are negligence claims.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then how could the Seventh\nCircuit have gotten it that wrong?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, the Seventh Circuit\nmade five crucial errors, that it was wrong to describe\nthe district court as saying that removal was proper.\nThe district court didn't say that.\nThey were wrong to say that the remand was\nbased on section 77(d)(4). That's not what the\ndistrict court did.\nThey were wrong to evaluate section 77p(c)\nwithout even reciting or construing the language.\nThey were wrong to say that SLUSA's\nsubstantive decisions, quote, must be made by the\nFederal rather than the State judiciary. That's not\ncorrect.\nAnd they were wrong to say that it was now or\nnever for appellate review whether an action under\nState law is preempted.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it -- it might\nhave been that prior to Dabit, you would have been\nemphasizing -- or whoever would have been emphasizing\nthe -- the fraud character of -- of the claims, and\nafter Dabit, perhaps the negligence boat is the only\none left for you.\nMR. FREDERICK: But the point, Mr. Chief\nJustice, is that this is on a basis of subject-matter\njurisdiction. It's not waivable and we're permitted to\nsay that a district court decision based on subject-\nmatter jurisdiction can look at the relevant claims.\nIt is true that the perception at the time was that\nthese holder theories evaded SLUSA. All of the courts\nup until that time of Kircher II had held that, and\nthat's not an unreasonable position for a lawyer to\ntake.\nNow, certainly after Dabit, those claims are\nforeclosed where there are holder fraud claims. We do\n-- we obviously don't take issue with that.\nBut here, the claims in the complaint\nthemselves are based on negligence, and it is certainly\nfair --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe this is not a\nfair -- how likely is it, given our determination in\nDabit about how Congress intended to treat fraud\nclaims, that negligence claims are going to fare any\nbetter?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, this Court in the Santa\nFe case, Mr. Chief Justice, said that negligence claims\nare not within 10b-5. Those are claims that are\nproperly brought under State law.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Would it make sense --\nMR. FREDERICK: So if the -- if the State\ncourt applies Dabit and Santa Fe, it will come to the\nconclusion that the holder theory is preempted under\nDabit, but the negligence theory is not preempted under\nthe Santa Fe case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Does it make -- what's\nworrying me in the back of my mind is we have decided\nDabit since this case was brought. Then I thought,\nwell, could we remand this case in light of Dabit.\nNow, if we did that, we wouldn't decide the issue that\nyou all want decided, and we'd let this, unfortunately,\nslightly confused situation continue to exist.\nWhat would be the consequence of that? Are\nthere -- are there a lot of cases, or is this something\nthat comes up often?\nMR. FREDERICK: It does come up often because\nthe securities bar, every time they get a district\ncourt decision that they don't like, they want to\nappeal it, notwithstanding the general bar of\nappealability. So this issue is something that is very\nimportant to both sides in the development of this law.\nBut I would further point out, Justice\nBreyer, that as this case has come up, your -- your\nview would have to be based on do you have appellate\njurisdiction, and our submission is that you don't,\nsubject for purposes of remanding the case in light of\nDabit.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm trying to think. It\nseems if you -- it ought to work out similarly to what\nhappens in a case where there's a Federal issue that\nyou remove under. Now you've removed. And there also\nis a State issue pendent. Now, what the judge does is\nhe says, defendant, you win on the Federal issue, and\nI'm going to send this thing back now, remand it,\nbecause I don't think I want to maintain here the State\nissue. And so it's a remand order. The case is\nremanded.\nNow, I think you get an appeal on your\nFederal issue there. And then -- then why shouldn't --\nif that's so, shouldn't this work out the same way?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, in the Cohill case,\nthis Court addressed the situation where there was a\nFederal dismissal of the claims and the -- and the\nFederal district court remanded the State claims for\nconsideration under -- under State jurisdiction. And\nthe Court had internal discussion about whether or not,\nyou know, there was appealability of what was left in\nthe case.\nOur -- our position is that ordinarily a\ndismissal of a Federal claim is an appealable matter\nand that that is subject to appeal, but that a remand\ndecision, which is what the district court made in this\ncase, is not.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Shouldn't it work out the same?\nMR. FREDERICK: No, it shouldn't and the\nreason it shouldn't is because Congress has decided\nthat it shouldn't. Congress has decided that there is\na paramount interest in having decisions made on their\nmerits, which is why there is not appellate review of\nremand orders. That's --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But aren't you -- aren't you\nurging a very strange result that the -- the decision\non the merits of the SLUSA preclusion issue should be\ndecided by the State courts when the whole purpose of\n-- of that provision was to take matters out of the\nState courts because there was a view in Congress that\nthey were not being handled properly there?\nMR. FREDERICK: No, Justice Alito, to the\ncontrary. They are being decided by Federal district\ncourts. They're just no subject to appellate review,\nand it was because --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I thought you said the merits\nof the issue was not going to be decided by the Federal\ncourt.\nMR. FREDERICK: No. Well, the -- the merits\nof the case are going to be decided by the State court.\nThe question of whether there's a Federal defense\nbased on SLUSA in the first instance is decided by the\ndistrict court in remanding the case, and then if there\nbecomes a basis through evidence or amendment to the\npleadings or whatnot, if the defendants want to re-\nraise their SLUSA preemption argument, they are\ncertainly free to do that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So he's right that it's\nultimately not decided by the Federal court.\nMR. FREDERICK: No, it is decided.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying the Federal\ncourt makes a decision which is not binding in the\ncase. That decision can be undone by the State court.\nMR. FREDERICK: It is decided by the Federal\ncourt within the confines of what Congress has\ndetermined based on its wording of SLUSA and its fact\nthat, as this Court has said in Things Remembered, the\nCongress is presumed to accept the general rule of\nnonappealability unless it says so.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I understand that.\nCan you answer my question? You -- you were\nsaying that the -- that the decision by the Federal\ncourt on this issue is not final.\nMR. FREDERICK: I'm saying that it is final\nfor purposes of remand.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, but it is not final --\nMR. FREDERICK: And that in terms --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- for purposes of the\nlawsuit.\nMR. FREDERICK: Because -- because what SLUSA\ndoes is it has an interplay between the removal\njurisdiction provision and it says, as set forth in\nsubsection (b).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that, but as\nlong as you say that, the point that -- that Justice\nAlito makes is -- is well taken, that we -- we thought\nthat this was a -- a statute designed to have the\nFederal courts determine this issue, and it turns out\nthat the Federal court just takes the first swing at\nit, and if a State court disagrees, it's -- it's free\nto do so.\nMR. FREDERICK: That is a policy choice that\nCongress made when not providing a special mechanism\nfor appellate review of remand orders.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Of course, if the Federal\ndistrict court says there is preclusion, therefore,\ncase dismissed, that would be reviewable.\nMR. FREDERICK: That's correct, and that's\nwhere the uniformity of decisions would come from, the\nreviews by plaintiffs who's had their -- who have had\ntheir cases dismissed. Those are subject to appeal.\nI'd like to reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nFrederick.\nMr. Perry.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK A. PERRY\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. PERRY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nIt was quite a litany of errors that Judge\nEasterbrook is alleged to have committed in this case.\nI would submit, Your Honors, he committed none.\nJudge Easterbrook correctly recognized that\nthe only issue put into play by these Petitioners was\nthe Dabit question. In their motion to remand this\ndocket, docket number 20 in the Kircher case, they\nsaid, it is the fourth requirement, the in-connection-\nwith requirement, which is at issue in the present\ncase.\nWe pointed out in every subsequent brief that\nthey had waived all other issues, and they never\nresponded to that waiver. It is that, Justice\nGinsburg, to which Judge Easterbrook was responding\nwhen he said plaintiffs never argued in their briefs\nand they did not maintain an argument that any other\nrequirement --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Could we just -- can I ask\nyou suppose they didn't waive it? Would their -- would\ntheir position have any merit?\nMR. PERRY: No, Your Honor. Their complaint\nrests on two factors that are clearly within SLUSA.\nFirst, misrepresentations. They claim that our\nprospectuses misled them into investing in these mutual\nfunds and then --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me put the question\njust a little differently. Suppose the -- in Dabit, we\ndecided that the distinction between the purchaser-\nseller rule and the scope of 10b-5 did not prevent\nSLUSA from preempting. But does SLUSA preempt a claim\nthat is beyond the scope of rule 10b-5?\nMR. PERRY: Your Honor, SLUSA precludes\nprecisely what subsection (b) says it precludes, which\nis beyond the scope of 10b-5. For example, 10b-5\nrequires scienter. SLUSA has no scienter requirement.\nSo a non-scienter-based State law claim is still\nprecluded under SLUSA.\nWhat SLUSA requires is a misrepresentation,\nomission, manipulation, or deceptive device in\nconnection with the purchase or sale of securities.\nPeriod. All of that is present in this complaint.\nThey allege omissions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But they can always amend\nthe complaint and pare it down and say now -- we -- we\ncomplained all along about negligence. Now, Judge, we\nare complaining about mismanagement on the defendants'\npart, nothing more. No manipulation. Cut out -- they\ncould have such a complaint, and would that be\nprecluded if -- if they started afresh in the State\ncourt and they said, we are complaining about\nmismanagement? We're not charging anyone with fraud or\ndeception. Couldn't -- isn't that a viable claim?\nMR. PERRY: Your Honor, in this case they\ncould not amend their complaint because the Federal\njurisdiction is determined on the complaint that we\nremoved. And at the time of removal, it was clearly\nprecluded by SLUSA. And the Court's cases are very\nclear that a plaintiff may not amend. For example, you\ncan't lower the amount in controversy below $75,000 to\nget back to State court. At the time of removal, the\nFederal court both had jurisdiction over this case and\nit was clearly precluded under SLUSA.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And -- and I\nunderstand your submission -- and perhaps it's distinct\nfrom the Seventh Circuit holding in this respect -- to\nsuggest that those are different standards, the\nstandard for removal and the standard for preclusion.\nMR. PERRY: Your Honor, I think we're the\nsame as the Seventh Circuit. We may have articulated\nit slightly different, but yes, they are different\nstandards.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that under your\nview at least, it's possible that you could have\nremoval jurisdiction and then determine that the -- the\ncase is not, in fact, preempted.\nMR. PERRY: Yes, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And so that an\nentirely State law case would proceed in Federal court.\nMR. PERRY: Mr. Chief Justice, let me give\nyou an example. The answer is yes.\nIn a case in which there is removal\njurisdiction because the defense is colorable, there\nmay be a factual issue as to whether the in-connection-\nwith requirement is met. In 10b-5 cases, it's not\nuncommon that that is a factual question, not a legal\nquestion. The Federal court would then retain\njurisdiction to decide that question on summary\njudgment, at trial, or whatever. It won't know until\nit finally disposes of the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there another\ninstance in which we've upheld Federal court\njurisdiction over a purely State law cause of action,\napart from the Federal officer situation?\nMR. PERRY: You have the Federal officer\nsituation and you have the FSIA, Foreign Sovereign\nImmunities Act situation, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But those are the\nonly two.\nMR. PERRY: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So this would be a\npretty unusual creature that you're asking us to\nsanction.\nMR. PERRY: No, Your Honor. It would be\nprecisely the same creature that happens every time\nCongress makes a case removable on the basis of a\nFederal defense. Every time Congress does that, which\nis not very often, the Court has held that the\ncolorable defense is sufficient to invest the Federal\ncourt with jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But then, Mr. Perry,\nthere's a whole case. See, what's peculiar about this\nis Congress says it's not really preemption. I think\nJustice Stevens pointed that out in Dabit. It is\npreclusion. It says this action shall not exist.\nPeriod. Not as a State claim, not as a Federal claim.\nAnd it wanted the Federal courts to monitor that\ndetermination. It surely didn't want -- if -- if the\nState claim is outside that preclusion, didn't want the\nFederal courts to sit and have a whole trial on what is\na non-diverse, no Federal question case. I mean, it\njust seems -- if you're going to imagine what Congress\nwouldn't want in the Federal court, that would be it.\nMR. PERRY: Justice Ginsburg, three answers.\nFirst, Congress wanted Federal courts to make\nthe decision, not monitor the decision.\nSecond, we agree the Federal court has the\npower to remand the case. If all that's left is State\nlaw claims, the court doesn't have to keep it.\nAnd third, that is what -- the regime that\nCongress set up was designed because there is a risk of\nerror. Some district courts will get some SLUSA\npreclusion questions wrong. And the question before\nthis Court really is would Congress have wanted those\ncases to stay in the Federal courts subject to Federal\nappellate review or --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But now there you must\nadmit that you are departing from Judge Easterbrook\nbecause Judge Easterbrook said this statute gives the\nFederal court adjudicatory authority to do one thing,\nto decide whether there's preemption or preclusion or,\nif not, then to remand. So they make -- they make one\ndetermination and bow out he said. And you're telling\nus, no, they don't bow out. They can, if they want to,\nkeep the State law claim and adjudicate it on the\nmerits.\nMR. PERRY: Your Honor, Judge Easterbrook\nread section -- subsection (d)(4) to require remand.\nPetitioners and Respondent's are in agreement in this\nCourt for the first time that (d)(4) does not apply to\nthe remand in this case. It only applies to remands\nfor expressly exempted actions. The -- (d)(4), it\nsays, shall be remanded.\nThe corollary to that, we would submit, is\nthat where Congress recognizes that certain cases shall\nbe remanded, even though they're within the removal\njurisdiction, other cases, such as this one, may be\nremanded. Otherwise, Congress could have said all\ncases that are not precluded shall be remanded.\nAnd -- and, Justice Ginsburg, it's not as\ncounterintuitive as -- as I think Petitioners are\ntrying to make it seem because there may be Federal\nissues that continue past the preclusion --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. I'm simply asking\nabout the Seventh Circuit's understanding of the case.\nIt says, after making the decision that 77p(b)\nrequires, the district court has nothing else to do.\nDismissal and remand are the only options. So Judge\nEasterbrook or the Seventh Circuit clearly did not\nthink that there was any adjudication on the merits of\na State law claim to be made. He said it twice. One\nis at 14a of the joint appendix, and the other is 11a.\nMR. PERRY: And, Justice Ginsburg, the reason\nhe said that was because of -- of section -- subsection\n(d)(4), which is quoted in full at the top of page 12a\nof the petition appendix. That is because the Second\nCircuit had held that (d)(4) applies to remands in this\nsituation, and both Petitioners and Respondent's in\ntheir Seventh Circuit briefing took that position.\nWhen we got to this Court and we both looked harder at\nthe statutory scheme, we both realized that we were\nwrong. Therefore, Judge Easterbrook -- you know, the\none mistake he made was the one we led him into making.\nBut that doesn't change the validity of his\njurisdictional analysis, which is to say that the only\nrequirement of SLUSA that goes to the jurisdiction on\nremoval is whether this is a covered class action. The\nelements of the preclusion defense are then the\nsubstantive question of Federal law that Congress\nauthorized the Federal court to make, and it authorized\nthe Federal court to make final.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm confused now. You're\nsaying both sides agreed that section 1447(d) does not\napply?\nMR. PERRY: No, Justice Breyer. Both sides\nagree that SLUSA, section 77p(d)(4) --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, then --\nthen I understand that.\nWhat I don't understand is the question about\nsomething remaining to be done. What -- what 77p(b)\nsays is the covered class action, I take it, is any\nprivate party alleging. And when I see the word\nalleging, I think you're supposed to look at the\ncomplaint to see what they allege, not some other thing\nabout what's going to happen later. But you're telling\nme that's wrong.\nMR. PERRY: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if you're right that\nthat's wrong, I don't see how you could possibly get\nout of (c) in 1447(c) which talks about a decision\nbefore final judgment, that it lacks subject-matter\njurisdiction. Because if you're right, then this is\nbefore final judgment, it lacks subject-matter\njurisdiction. That's the end of your case.\nMR. PERRY: Justice Breyer, I disagree\nrespectfully.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. You have to\ndisagree with -- I guess -- go ahead. Disagree. I'd\nlike to hear the answer.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PERRY: If it is a covered class action,\nthat is, 50 plaintiffs and so forth --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. PERRY: -- it is removable and within the\nsubject-matter jurisdiction of the Federal courts so\nlong as the defendant has presented, either on the\ncomplaint or in the removal papers, a colorable defense\nof preclusion. Only --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, which would have to be\na colorable defense that there is an allegation by the\nplaintiff that falls within (b).\nMR. PERRY: An allegation by the plaintiff as\nelaborated on by the removal notice, if necessary,\nbecause where Congress has waived the well-pleaded\ncomplaint rule, the removal court will look beyond the\nfour corners of the complaint to include affidavits and\nother materials provided by the defendant. That has\nalways been held the case in -- in the rare instances\nwhere Congress has made a Federal defense removable.\nThe Court said that in the Franchise Tax Board case,\nfor example, and it's well supported by history from\nthe 1870's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I don't think that any\nof those cases are comparable, in that the removed case\nis going to be tried someplace.\nTake a diversity case. The Federal court has\nto decide -- and it's removed -- whether the parties\nare really diverse. If it decides that they are really\ndiverse, it keeps the case and it's adjudicated in\nFederal court. If it decides they're not, the case is\nadjudicated in the State court.\nBut here, the determination is, is there a\nclaim to be tried anyplace? And if there is preclusion\nunder SLUSA, then it's not a question of, as Judge\nEasterbrook put a menu, where is -- it's not a where\nquestion. It's a whether question. And so that makes\n-- makes SLUSA quite different from other cases where\nthe -- the case is going to be tried someplace. Here,\nthe decision to be made is, is this going to be tried\nor not? Is it -- is it a claim or is not a claim?\nMR. PERRY: I entirely agree with you, Judge\n-- Justice Ginsburg, and I think that supports Judge\nEasterbrook's opinion.\nIn the where will it be tried case, the lack\nof appellate review is less important because the\nmerits of the case will go to State court and up\nthrough the system, and any Federal issues can reach\nthis case.\nIn the SLUSA case, where the district court\nerroneously, as we know the district court erroneously\ndid here, denies the preclusion and sends the case back\nto State court, that is a final determination of\nFederal law that we submit is not reviewable in State\ncourt and can't be reviewed by this Court up on review\nthrough the State system. So that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why do you say it is not --\nwhy do you say that it cannot be examined in State\ncourt if there's no appeal in the Federal forum?\nMR. PERRY: Your Honor, this Court has always\nheld and reiterated in the Munsingwear case that where\na collateral estoppel attaches because an issue has\nbeen fully and finally litigated in a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction between the same parties, that\nthe availability of an appeal --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but the --\nMR. PERRY: -- does affect collateral\nestoppel.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but -- but there is\nalso exceptions to the rule of claim and issue\npreclusion, and when you don't have an opportunity to\nappeal because the system doesn't let you appeal, then\nyou can say, Judge, don't give this preclusive effect.\nI did not have that full and fair opportunity because\nI was unable to appeal. And I think that that's a solid\npreclusion law.\nMR. PERRY: Justice Ginsburg, this Court has\nnever held that an appeal is required to give\ncollateral estoppel effect. Therefore, on remand, the\ncourt could -- the Madison County State court could\ngive collateral estoppel effect. In fact, I expect\nPetitioners would argue precisely that. And no\ndecision of this Court stands as a barrier to that.\nThe Court would have to change preclusion law to say\nthat the lack of an appeal is a prerequisite to an\napproval. I agree with you, Your Honor, that it can\nbe taken into account by a court, but it does not --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And a Nassau County court\ncould say, we're not going to treat that as preclusive.\nThey didn't have a fair chance to appeal. And that\nwould be all right.\nMR. PERRY: And if they came out the other\nway and said, I am going to treat it as preclusive,\nbecause the Supreme Court says you don't have to have a\nright to appeal, we'd be stuck with that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you wouldn't be stuck\nwith it. I mean, that would be a Federal preclusion\ndecision and that would ultimately be reviewable here.\nMR. PERRY: That -- that decision would be\nreviewable here, Your Honor. It's an unnecessary\nmultiple layers of appeals and going through the State\nsystem to decide a Federal question that Congress\nwanted to have decided in the Federal courts.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But in any case, you said\nEasterbrook made only one mistake.\nMR. PERRY: Only one mistake.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But he made another one\nwhen he said, it's now or never for appellate review.\nThat preclusion question could come to this Court if it\nwent -- the case went back and the Nassau County said,\nwell, I'm going to follow the Federal court, I'm not\ngoing to -- at the end of the road, the preclusion\nquestion would be open for this Court to review.\nMR. PERRY: I respectfully disagree with you,\nJustice Ginsburg. The -- if the State court gave\npreclusive effect to the Federal court judgment, the\npreclusion question would be open to question -- the\ncollateral estoppel question would be open to review.\nBut the substance of the remand order would not be. It\nwould still be barred by 1447(d), if Petitioners are\nright, and this Court held exactly that in the Missouri\nPacific Railroad case in 1896 and has never revisited\nthat. So that we cannot get the SLUSA issue up back\nthrough the State system.\nJudge Easterbrook was exactly right. It is\nnow or never, Your Honor. And Congress certainly could\nnot have expected on an issue of this magnitude where\nit passed a law 3 years after the PSLRA --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Now or never. The\nquestion is not can you -- is there an appeal or does\n1447(d) bar it. The question is whether an action\nunder State law is preempted.\nAnd suppose this case had gone along in the\nFederal -- in the State court, and the defense of\npreclusion is made in the State court. The State court\ncould certainly decide that question. Nobody removed\nit. So the State court has competence to decide that\nquestion, doesn't it?\nMR. PERRY: Certainly, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And in -- this Court could\ndecide it on review.\nMR. PERRY: In a non-removed case, yes.\nPetitioners' theory, though, is if this is a 1447(d)\nbar, and it was removed to Federal court, decided that\nit was not precluded by SLUSA and remanded it, this\nCourt could not review it directly or indirectly, could\nnot review the issue of SLUSA preclusion decided by the\nFederal court.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I don't understand\nthat. Why can't it?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And your best case on that\nis Munsingwear?\nMR. PERRY: No, Your Honor. Our case on\nthat, where the Court held exactly that, is Missouri\nPacific Railroad v. Fitzgerald.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, the Missouri Pacific\ncase.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was that a case where\nthere was no possibility of reviewing the decision of\nthe court of first instance?\nMR. PERRY: Yes, Your Honor. It was a case\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: On -- on the merits of the\nissue as opposed to diversity?\nMR. PERRY: On the merits of the final\njudgment in the case, correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And why --\nJUSTICE BREYER: In other words, if -- I\nmean, it's awfully surprising -- I think that's why\nyou're getting this resistance -- that there's an issue\nin a case, does -- is the -- the State action preempted\nor not. They've never had an appeal. So they get it\ntried. The whole case is tried out, and then the --\nsome State court says, in our opinion it is preempted.\nBut they can't decide that. They can't decide it\nbecause there was a Federal judge who said the opposite\nin the same case before the case was final.\nMR. PERRY: Justice Breyer, I think the State\ncourt could decide that. It's not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if they don't -- and if\nthey refuse to decide it, why wouldn't this Court say,\nthis is the same case? There is only one case. It\nisn't over yet, and we're reviewing that, and we think\nthat district judge was wrong. We think that Federal\ndistrict judge never read Dabit, which isn't surprising\nsince it was decided after he wrote the opinion.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PERRY: Justice Breyer, we would\ncertainly hope that if Petitioners were to prevail on\nthe 1447(d) issue, this Court would make clear both\nthat we could relitigate the question to State court and\nbring it to this Court.\nWhat we are saying is under the current state\nof this Court's law, laid out in our brief and not\nchallenged in any regard by Petitioners, that is not\nobviously the case, so that we are left with the fact\nthat a State court could give preclusive effect to an\nobviously wrong Federal judgment that could not be\nreviewed in this Court.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So you're saying we would\nhave to overrule Missouri Pacific?\nMR. PERRY: I think you would have to clarify\nat least that Missouri Pacific does not apply to SLUSA\nremovals and remands, Justice Souter.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is part of the dynamic\nhere, Mr. Perry, that if this goes back to the State\ncourt, that affects the dynamics of the litigation\nbecause you now have a class action that has to\nproceed, and that a large part of the litigation\nstrategy in these cases is determined by whether or not\nthere's going to be a full trial on the merits of the\nclass action to effect a settlement, and so forth, so\nthat Congress wanted to have this reviewed quickly and\nin the Federal courts?\nMR. PERRY: Correct, Your Honor. And --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question?\nBecause I hadn't, frankly, realized the importance you\nattach to the Missouri Pacific case. And the way you\ndescribe it as saying that the -- the State court\ncannot be held to have decided against a Federal right\n-- well, anyway, the -- the point is there are two\nthings that are decided by the Federal court when it\nremands a case. One, there was no preemption, and two,\ntherefore, there shall be a removal.\nNow, as I understood the principle underlying\nthat case, the -- the correctness of the remand could\nnot be reviewed. That's litigated. But could not the\ncorrectness of the reason given for the remand, namely\nthere was no preemption, be removed by us on\ncertiorari?\nMR. PERRY: Not under Petitioners' theory,\nYour Honor, because their theory is that the inquiries\nare completely and totally coextensive. That the\njurisdictional inquiry, the -- the remand inquiry is\nprecisely the same as the preclusion inquiry. Our\nposition is that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Under their theory, but it\nseems to me very strange to say that we could not, when\nwe do get the case on a petition for certiorari --\ncouldn't review whether it was -- whether it was in\nfact preemption.\nMR. PERRY: Your Honor, I'd submit that it's\nvery strange that this would not be just reviewable\nstraight up through the Federal system, as Judge\nEasterbrook and the Seventh Circuit correctly held.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the reason is\nthere are two separate questions. They just happen to\nbe identical. But I mean, the State court isn't going\nto worry about whether removal is appropriate or not.\nIt doesn't have to answer that question, but it may\nwell have to answer the question whether it's\npreempted. It happens to be the same analysis, at\nleast under a reading of the statute, but that doesn't\nmeant that you -- that just because a review of the\nremoval decision -- the remand decision is -- is\nprecluded, that review of the preemption decision is\nprecluded.\nMR. PERRY: Your Honor, that -- that may well\nbe a fair distinction of the Missouri Pacific case. We\ncome to the Court today with the law as it stands and\nnot knowing whether such a distinction will be drawn in\nthe future --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But it's so odd.\nMR. PERRY: -- the Seventh Circuit.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose -- suppose the -- it\ncame up under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.\nThe district court judge remands the case. In his\nopinion Romania is not a country. That's what he\nthinks. Never heard of it.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: So -- so it goes back to the\nState court and the State court says, yes, that's\nright. We've not heard of Romania either. It's not a\ncountry.\nAll right. Now, you're saying there we are\nfor all time. Everybody is stuck with this holding.\nMR. PERRY: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that right? Maybe that's\nwhy I'm so surprised that such could be the law.\nMR. PERRY: If -- if it works the same way\nwith SLUSA, such could be the law. The Court certainly\nhas the opportunity to clarify that.\nAgain, I'll return to the simpler way --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You're -- you're positing\na -- a State court that's going to, by golly, give that\nFederal decision preclusive effect even though, say,\nthe Restatement of Judgments says -- now if a decision\ndidn't -- if there was no opportunity for review, then\nthat's a ground for refusing preclusive effect.\nMR. PERRY: And in -- and in Munsingwear,\nYour Honor, the United States cited that precise\nprovision of the Restatement of Judgments to this\nCourt, and six Justices of this Court held, no, if\nthere's no appeal, we are still going to give this\njudgment collateral estoppel effect. Certainly a State\ncourt would not be unreasonable in following this\nCourt's lead, since this Court has never retreated from\nthat statement.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought Munsingwear was\nabout mootness.\nMR. PERRY: Your Honor, it was about mootness\nand the result of the -- the Government's complaint\nthere was that it was going to have to live with the\ncollateral estoppel effects of the judgment. One of\nthe arguments they made was, well, because we can't get\nan appeal, we won't be bound, and the Court disagreed\nwith that en route to saying, and to avoid that\nproblem, precisely that problem, you should have asked\nfor vacatur. But since the Solicitor General didn't do\nit, the Court -- the decision stood and it had\ncollateral estoppel effect. That -- that is the\nholding of Munsingwear, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But in -- in any case,\nMunsingwear turned on -- not on the availability of --\nof an appeal generally, but on the mootness of the\ncase. In other words, Munsingwear said, look, your\ncase disappeared, and the -- the only way to get rid of\nthe order you don't like is -- is vacatur. And if you\ndidn't take that opportunity to get rid of it, then the\n-- the decision that was made survives, and that gets\npreclusive effect. It -- it doesn't -- Munsingwear\nwould not apply of its own force in this case.\nMR. PERRY: Well, Munsingwear reaffirmed\nJohnson v. Wharton which said that where Congress takes\naway the right to appeal, there is still collateral\nestoppel effect of the district court judgment. That\n-- that was the previous decision that Munsingwear\naffirmed.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But not if the litigant\nasks to have it vacated under Munsingwear, the litigant\nwould be entitled to have it vacated. So it was a foot\nfault and the -- the Court held the counsel to the\nmistake that had been made.\nMR. PERRY: Your Honor, the -- the holding of\nMunsingwear is that Johnson v. Wharton is good law, and\na court need not give -- may give preclusive effect to\na case without an appeal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel --\nMR. PERRY: If the Court would like to change\nthat law, it's -- it's up to this Court, but that's how\nwe come to this case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if you -- on\nthe removal question, if there's a dispute about\nwhether it's a covered class action, dispute about the\nnumber of people involved, the dollar amount, I take it\nthat is litigated at the jurisdictional stage?\nMR. PERRY: Correct, Your Honor. I think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. But you say\nthat when it gets to whether it's a -- there's a --\ninvolving a covered security, for some reason that\ncan't be litigated at the jurisdictional stage.\nMR. PERRY: No, Your Honor. That is the\nmerits determination. And -- and the statute tracks --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. No or\nyes? That that is not litigated at the jurisdictional\nstage?\nMR. PERRY: That the preclusive elements are\nthe merits question of the case, not the jurisdictional\nquestion.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is that? There\n-- it's the same clause. What you can remove is a\ncovered class action involving a covered security. So\nwhy do we have such different approaches to the\ndifferent prongs?\nMR. PERRY: Your Honor, I'm agreeing with you\non covered security. I'm -- I'm saying that there then\nis the further inquiry of whether all of the preclusive\nelements of subsection 77p(b) are met, which is the\nmerits inquiry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. And --\nMR. PERRY: There -- there are very few cases\nthat don't involve covered securities because virtually\nevery security is covered. There are very few cases\nthat aren't covered class actions because if they\ninvolve more than 50 people, that's about all the\nrequirement there is. Those are the jurisdictional\nprerequisites. That, if established, gives the court\nsubject-matter jurisdiction.\nThen we have the substantive elements of the\nSLUSA preclusion defense provided in a different\nstatute that is not jurisdictional, just like this\nCourt described in Arbaugh. The covered security and\ncovered class action Congress made jurisdictional by\nputting them in the statute. The substantive elements\nof the defense Congress did not make jurisdictional\nbecause they're in another statute.\nThat's the disconnect that Judge Easterbrook\nunderstood so that on the face of the opinion of the\ndistrict court, where it recites the defendants\nmaintain that the in-connection-with requirement was\nmet, that defense, if colorable -- and it clearly was.\nThis Court has accepted it in Dabit -- conferred\njurisdiction on the court, and then the substantive\ndecision on the merits was the merits determination.\nThat is the decoupling that Congress did in SLUSA, that\nJudge Easterbrook correctly recognized, and that puts\nthis case squarely within the Thermtron exception to\n1447(d).\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you answer the\nargument, the third argument, that Mr. Frederick\nstressed that is, that Congress provided specifically\nin the Class Action Fairness Act, a couple of other\nacts, and 1447 itself with respect to civil rights\nactions removable under 1443? In all those cases, it\nprovided specifically for review of remand decisions,\nand here the silence is deafening.\nMR. PERRY: In those cases, Your Honor, they\nwork differently than SLUSA for two reasons. One,\nthey're the whether -- not whether it will be tried,\nbut where it will be tried. And when Congress -- and\nwhen it was only a where question, Congress puts in a\nspecific provision.\nThe other is CAFA, for example, is expressly\njurisdictional. It amends the diversity statute. So\nthere's no argument that it would be within Thermtron.\nEvery CAFA question is a 1447(c) issue. Congress had\nto make it.\nHere, Congress knew about Thermtron.\nCongress has known about Thermtron for 30 years. This\nCourt reaffirmed Thermtron while they were debating\nSLUSA. And Congress knew that this question was not\njurisdictional. Congress decoupled them, just as this\nCourt described in Arbaugh.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't know what -- what\nCongress' knowledge about Thermtron was a district\njudge who said, they removed this case, but I'm much\ntoo busy. This court is much too busy to mess with\nstuff that belongs in the State court. I'm remanding\nit. That was just too much, and the Federal court --\nMR. PERRY: And, Justice Ginsburg, if Judge\nHermansdorfer had said, I'm much too busy and therefore\nI lack subject-matter jurisdiction, it is inconceivable\nthat the Thermtron case would have been decided any\ndifferently. Congress understands the difference\nbetween jurisdiction and merits. This Court\nunderstands the difference between jurisdiction and\nmerits. Judge Easterbrook certainly understood that\ndistinction. This determination made by the district\ncourt here was a merits determination not controlled by\n1447(c), and therefore, appeal was not barred by\n1447(d).\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But -- but I still\ndon't -- and this gets back to the question I asked\nbefore. I mean, subsection (c) of 77p -- it's\nunfortunate we've got a lot of subsection (c)'s here\nbut -- of -- of SLUSA incorporates subsection (b).\nMR. PERRY: No, Your Honor. It references\nsubsection (b).\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it says what\ncan be removed is the covered class action involving a\ncovered security, as set forth in subsection (b).\nMR. PERRY: Just as title VII says what can\nbe brought is an action under this title or just as the\nenvironmental statute in Steel Company said what can be\nbrought is an action under subsection (a).\nThe cross reference of another provision\ncontaining substantive elements of Federal law does not\nmake those elements jurisdictional. That's the holding\nof Arbaugh. That's the holding of Steel Company.\nThere's no reason that the same principle shouldn't be\napplied when Congress makes a Federal defense removable\nas when it makes a Federal claim subject to suit within\nthe original jurisdiction of the Federal courts.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but here, what is set\nout in subsection (b) is exactly the reason for\nCongress' wanting to place these restrictions on it,\nand that, it seems to me, is the sensible reason for\nreading it the way your -- your brother on the other\nside does.\nMR. PERRY: Well, Justice Souter, we know\nfrom Mesa that if Congress had just made all covered\nclass actions removable, we would have to find some\nFederal defense to support article III jurisdiction.\nCongress, by cross-referencing subsection (b), just\npointed the Federal courts to the particular Federal\ndefense that is sufficient, clearly sufficient, to make\narticle III satisfied under the Mesa case. That's all\nthat that cross reference is doing.\nIt's not, however, picking up every element.\nIf Congress wanted to include every element of title\nVII, that environmental statute of SLUSA, it would have\nput them in the jurisdictional provision. Arbaugh says\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why would it have\ndone that? That would have been a waste of time. I\nmean, you just say, as set forth in subsection (b).\nYou're saying if they had repeated subsection (b)\nthere, we'd have -- the case would come out the other\nway?\nMR. PERRY: Yes, Your Honor. We have not\nonly the -- the reference there, but we have the final\nsentence of that clause where we say after removal,\nafter the court establishes that it has removal\njurisdiction, it shall subject the action to subsection\n(b). That clause is entirely redundant under\nPetitioners' reading of the statute. Entirely\nredundant. I've read the reply brief a number of\ntimes. I don't understand their explanation for that.\nThe only explanation is that Congress made\nremovability contingent on the subsection (c) factors.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Perry.\nMr. Frederick, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID FREDERICK\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. FREDERICK: Thank you. I think it's\nreally important for you to look at the complaints in\nthese cases because every single one of them asserts\nclaims on the basis of negligence and the value -- the\nfair-value pricing of the securities. They are not\nbased on misrepresentations. The other side has\nattempted to make them look like misrepresentations,\nand they've quoted things out of context in order to do\nso. But the complaints themselves are pure negligence\nclaims that would fall outside of SLUSA.\nBut even if you were to disagree with that\nand even if you were to disagree with the district\ncourt's basis for saying that remand was proper because\nit lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, the general rule\nof Thermtron, Things Remembered, and importantly, the\nGravitt case applies. And this Court does not have\nappellate jurisdiction. The Seventh Circuit does not\nhave appellate jurisdiction because of the plain\nlanguage of section 1447(d).\nRespondents concede that State courts can\ndecide SLUSA questions. It is up to defendants to\ndecide whether to try to remove them. And subsection\n(d), about which Mr. Perry spoke, expressly provides\nthat certain kinds of securities actions shall be\nremanded because Congress was not so concerned that\nFederal courts decide everything concerning securities\ncases, but only as to those that are expressly set\nforth in subsection (b).\nAnd, Mr. Chief Justice, respectfully, what\nsubsection (c) is doing with its references to\nsubsection (b) are to incorporate those criteria as one\nof the three elements or criteria for removability. It\nhas to be a covered security, has to be a covered class\naction, and it has to meet the requisites of subsection\n(b). That's the only reasonable way to read that. And\nthe last clause is simply confirmatory that if those\nare -- are met, then the district court has to find\nthat the case shall be precluded.\nIn the Gravitt case, in which this Court\nthrough a per curiam dismissed the appeal, there was a\ndispute between the district court and the court of\nappeals over whether the district court had properly\napplied subject-matter jurisdiction principles in\ndeciding whether or not there was diversity. This\nCourt said, no matter. That is outside the -- the\nrequisite -- that is outside 1447(d), and the general\nrule against appealability applies.\nNow, importantly, they argue that they would\nbe precluded by -- from arguing against SLUSA\npreemption in State court, but in fact, the last brief\n-- the last page of our brief, our reply brief, cites\nthe Standefer case in which this Court held, under\ncontemporary principles -- and I'm quoting now -- under\ncontemporary principles of collateral estoppel, the\ninability to pursue an appeal is a factor strongly\nmilitating against giving a judgment preclusive effect.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you agree that there\nwould be Federal court review in this Court from a\nState court determination on the applicability of SLUSA\nin this case?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes, there would be. And\nthere would be -- their argument about the Missouri\nPacific case is wrong because what the -- what was\ngoing on there was the remand determination, not the\nunderlying Federal right. And that's what would be\nappealed, and there would also be appeal of the\npreclusive consequences because that would be a\nquestion of Federal law under this Court's longstanding\ndetermination. The Restatement --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you one question,\nMr. Frederick? Because it's important to me.\nWould you agree that a complaint that alleged\nthat the defendant negligently used or employed\nmanipulative devices and so forth would be covered by\nSLUSA -- would preempt it?\nMR. FREDERICK: That would be covered. And\n-- and the reason is that it is -- involved a\nmanipulation. The wording of SLUSA involves a\nmanipulation of -- of the security.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So the mere fact that it's\nnegligently caused would not preclude preclusion.\nMR. FREDERICK: What -- what we're talking\nabout here, Justice Stevens -- it's important -- is\nthat in how these securities get priced, was there\nnegligence in the pricing of those, that had\ndeleterious effects on one class of holders but not on\nmarket-timers that we were moving in and out of the\nmarket.\nAnd so, frankly, Judge Easterbrook was wrong\nfor a sixth reason, and that was in saying that there\nwould have been a derivative claim here too because a\nderivative case has to be brought on behalf of the\ncorporation on behalf of all shareholders --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then the district court was\nwrong too I guess because the district court made the\nsame --\nMR. FREDERICK: The district court was wrong\nin not anticipating what this Court held in Dabit, but\nit was not wrong insofar as it held that there was no\nsubject-matter jurisdiction because this case is based\non negligence and not fraud.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nFrederick.\n"
