        "content": "(11:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in No. 03-6821, David Nelson v. Donal Campbell.\nMr. Stevenson.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BRYAN STEVENSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. STEVENSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\n6 days before petitioner's scheduled execution\nin this case, an execution that he had sought and\ninformally requested be -- be carried out as soon as\npossible, prison officials went to him and for the first\ntime told him that to deal with a medical problem that\nboth parties acknowledged exists, he would be subjected to\na procedure that would be conducted by State officials,\nnot necessarily medically trained, not necessarily\nlicensed, where they were going to make a 2-inch incision\nin his arm, cut through fat and tissue and muscle, until\nthey had a vein that they could access for the purposes of\ninserting a catheter.\nQUESTION: Well, presumably at a much earlier\ndate, the prisoner did know that he -- he was -- he would\nbe scheduled to be executed by lethal injection.\nMR. STEVENSON: Absolutely, Your -- Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And he did know his veins were\ncompromised.\nMR. STEVENSON: Absolutely, and as soon as he -\nQUESTION: So -- so presumably in -- well in\nadvance he could anticipate a problem.\nMR. STEVENSON: Yes, Your Honor, and he did. He\nimmediately began contacting the warden at Holman Prison.\nHe was housed in another facility some 200 miles away. He\nimmediately began contacting the warden at Holman Prison,\nwho had just been installed, who did not know him, and\ninformed him he had this condition, that they would need\nto create protocols necessary to deal with it.\nThe State admitted that they had never dealt\nwith someone in this condition before and began offering\nall kinds of things that would accomplish this execution.\nLet him bring in a physician that can insert a catheter.\nLet's get some protocols established so that we don't have\nany problems. And for 6 weeks essentially this effort was\nbeing made.\nHe had been previously told that they were going\nto do this 24 hours in advance, that they weren't going to\nmake this kind of 2-inch incision, and even though he\nhadn't been assured there would be medical people, he was\nrelatively comfortable with that. He did not file suit.\nIt's only 6 days before for the first time that the State\nannounced they would have this kind of invasive procedure\ncarried out by someone who was not necessarily medically\ntrained.\nHe filed a 1983 action. I think it's important\nfor this Court's judgment here today. The district court\nfound that that 1983 action, if it went in Mr. Nelson's\nfavor, would not invalidate his judgment or conviction.\nNotwithstanding that conclusion, the district court felt\ncompelled to apply a rule in force in the Eleventh Circuit\nthat effectively shields death row prisoners facing an\nexecution from doing anything that can challenge\nunconstitutional conditions of -- of confinement.\nThe Eleventh Circuit rule is essentially once\nyou are scheduled for an execution, it doesn't matter that\nthe prison begins to do something and amount to something\nthat -- that is unconstitutional.\nQUESTION: Well, they're -- they're not saying\nthat. They can bring actions that -- that challenge\nunconstitutional conditions of confinement. He's being\nkept in a dank and dark cell that's -- that's cruel and\npainful. The only thing they're saying he can't bring is\n-- is an action that, in effect, says I can't be executed\nthe way the State intends to execute me, that that has to\nhave been brought up earlier.\nMR. STEVENSON: Yes, and -- and I -- I guess\nthat's our -\nQUESTION: It has -- has to be under habeas\nrather than under 1983.\nMR. STEVENSON: Yes. And Your Honor, I -- I\nguess our position is -- is that this action is like the\naction that you describe. He is challenging medical\ntreatment, medical procedures. He doesn't say he doesn't\nwant to be executed. He's not trying to block his\nexecution.\nQUESTION: Well, but it's unlike these other\nactions in this one crucial respect: its effect is to\nprevent the execution.\nMR. STEVENSON: No. I think the effect here was\nto facilitate the execution. Mr. Nelson went into court\nsaying, let's just get an order so that my doctor can come\nin and carry this out. Let's just get a temporary\nrestraining order on this 2-inch incision which makes no\nsense. The -- the court -- the district court judge says,\ncan't you lawyers work this out? Mr. Nelson's counsel was\nready then and there to effectuate a procedure that would\ncarry out this execution.\nAnd the Eleventh Circuit judgment, Justice\nScalia, is actually one that says once the petitioner is\nscheduled for an execution, it doesn't matter whether it's\na conditions of confinement suit as you described, that\nthe Federal courts somehow have no authority to grant\nrelief or conduct review because the execution -- the\nscheduling of the execution somehow divests those courts\nof jurisdiction. That's the Eleventh Circuit rule.\nThey didn't argue here that because his\nlitigation, because his lawsuit is, in effect, an attempt\nto bar the execution, he loses. That's the distinction.\nWhat they said here is that because he is\nalready scheduled for execution, it doesn't matter what\nthe conditions of the confinement are, whether it\ninvalidates the conviction and sentence. Federal courts\nhave no authority to grant relief. And that's the rule we\nurge this Court to overturn.\nQUESTION: May -- may I get clear on one thing?\nMR. STEVENSON: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: Did he -- did his counsel say to the\ncourt, the district court, we want under 1983 an order\nthat says admit this man's doctor to the place of\nexecution at the time the State chooses so he can find a\nway then and there to allow the State to carry out the\nexecution when it wants to do it? Did he ask for that?\nMR. STEVENSON: Well, what he asked for -- what\n-- what he -- what he put in his complaint was that he had\nmade that offer to the State, and that was in his\ncomplaint, that -- that the defendant's counsel had\nauthorized or requested the opportunity to bring in a\nphysician to facilitate a review -\nQUESTION: Is that what he was asking for when\nhe went into court?\nMR. STEVENSON: Well, what he was asking for is\nan injunction barring them from doing this kind of 2-inch\nincision, but yes, he made it very clear in the\ncomplaint -\nQUESTION: Was it made clear to the district\ncourt that he would be satisfied with the order I have\njust described?\nMR. STEVENSON: Only to the extent -- yes, I\nbelieve so, Your Honor, because when the district court\nsaid, can't you work this out, Mr. Nelson's counsel said,\nyes, I think we can.\nQUESTION: Did -- did he ask for a postponement\nof the execution?\nMR. STEVENSON: He did, Your Honor. He did, and\nthat was in part because the State was, at least at the\npoint at which this lawsuit was filed in, saying that this\nis what they were going to do in -- in the absence of some\nkind of Federal intervention.\nQUESTION: What would have been the terms of the\npostponement that you were asking for?\nMR. STEVENSON: I -- I think the district court\ncould have basically issued a cease and desist order. You\nare enjoined from doing this kind of conduct because it\nviolates contemporary standards of medical decency.\nQUESTION: Would it have been sufficient to say,\ndon't -- postpone it until you admit the doctor to be\npresent and get the catheter in?\nMR. STEVENSON: I -- I think it could have been\nsufficient to say I'm going to order that his physician be\nadmitted into the facility. I'm going to order that you\naccomplish this through the method proposed by\npetitioner's counsel. I think all of those things could\nhave been done, but the district court here felt like he\ndid not have the authority to actually deal with this in\nthe 1983 context.\nQUESTION: Was it that -- before, Mr. Stevenson,\nyou said that nothing that the prisoner requests, once the\ndate of execution is set, is actionable in 1983. But I\nthought that the Eleventh Circuit made a distinction\nbetween a proceeding that would require a stay of the\nexecution. If he says that prior to the execution I'm in\n-- in a dark, dank cell, that would be actionable so long\nas he's not seeking to postpone the date of the execution,\nas I understand it.\nMR. STEVENSON: And I guess here, Your Honor,\nwhat we think is that when the prison waits until 6 days\nbefore the scheduled execution -- a complaint can only be\nfiled 3 days before the scheduled execution -- a\ndetermination of whether what the prison is proposing is\nunconstitutional or not cannot ordinarily -\nQUESTION: He -- he didn't -- he didn't know\nbefore that that -- that this was -\nMR. STEVENSON: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- the procedure they were going to\nuse?\nMR. STEVENSON: No, Your -- he had been told\nbefore that they were going to do something 24 hours in\nadvance. It was only on the Friday before the Thursday -\nQUESTION: When they're going to do it is not\nthe issue. It's what they're going to do.\nMR. STEVENSON: Well, yes, that's -- he was told\nfor the first time on that Friday, 2-inch incision in the\narm, not necessarily done by someone medically trained.\nThat presented a very different kind of -\nQUESTION: But he -- he knew that -- that\nsomething special had to be done with respect to him\nbecause he had these compromised veins. Didn't he?\nMR. STEVENSON: Absolutely. And -- and the\nrecord reflects that there were repeated efforts on the\npart of Mr. Nelson's counsel to get the State to -- to\ndeal with it.\nQUESTION: How -- how long ago was the\nconviction for which he was condemned to -- to death?\nMR. STEVENSON: The conviction was 1978. The\ndeath sentence is 1994. He spent a lot of years on death\nrow under an illegal death sentence that the Eleventh\nCircuit overturned in 1993.\nQUESTION: The crime was committed when?\nMR. STEVENSON: In 1978. The death sentenced\nimposed here was committed in 1994, and it's worth noting\nthat even then Mr. Nelson was very, very sort of unsure\nabout fighting a death sentence. He told the judge he\nwanted a death sentence. No appeal briefs were filed into\nthe Alabama appellate courts. The -\nQUESTION: Did -- did you at any point shape\nyour claim for relief in the alternative, saying we want\neither habeas corpus or 1983? Or do we take this case on\nthe assumption that almost everybody agrees it has to be\n1983?\nMR. STEVENSON: Well, no, it was not styled as a\nhabeas action, in part because the Eleventh Circuit rules\nwould have prevented us from ever getting review in this\nCourt or any other court if it had been framed in that\nway.\nQUESTION: Is that -- is that correct? If -- if\nwe had to do this in a circuit with no precedents, could\nyou argue that this would be -- could be habeas? It's not\nsuccessive because it's -- the issue hasn't come up\nbefore?\nMR. STEVENSON: Well, yes. There -- there\ncertainly -- it's certainly true that other circuits,\nJustice Kennedy, apply this Court's doctrine in Stewart v.\nMartinez where a claim, an execution claim, not previously\nripe, can be subject to habeas review. The Eleventh\nCircuit doesn't. Their position expressed in In re Medina\nis that if it wasn't in your first habeas, it can't be\npresented.\nQUESTION: Well, what does the statute say? It\nsays it has to be not only not previously ripe -- you\ndidn't have the information -- but also the statute says\nit has to show that he was innocent.\nMR. STEVENSON: Yes. And that's why we -- we -\nQUESTION: So why isn't that conclusive here? I\nmean, it -- it doesn't meet the second condition.\nMR. STEVENSON: Well, absolutely. It's -- it's\ncertainly conclusive, Justice Scalia. It could not be -\nQUESTION: Well, of course, that's assuming it's\nsuccessive.\nMR. STEVENSON: That's right. That's right. It\ncertainly would not be a successive petition. What we\nwould be arguing is what this Court has already held, that\nan unripe execution claim of this sort, of a competency to\nbe executed claim, which this Court held in Stewart was\ncognizable would be proper. In the Eleventh Circuit\nthat's not possible.\nQUESTION: But you don't have to go that far, do\nyou?\nMR. STEVENSON: We do not. We do not.\nQUESTION: Because ripeness could be a merely\nevidentiary matter, whereas in this case, you did not have\na claim that you could bring -\nMR. STEVENSON: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: -- at the time. So this is more than\njust ripeness.\nMR. STEVENSON: Absolutely. And -- and, Justice\nSouter, I think you're absolutely right. Here, where\nyou're not trying to do something that invalidates a\nconviction and sentence, it's not arguably appropriate to\nbe thinking about this in the habeas context.\n2241(c) says that to grant habeas relief, the\npetitioner has to allege that the conviction and sentence\nis illegal, is in violation of the Constitution. That's\nnot Mr. Nelson's contention here.\nQUESTION: Would you say -- would you be making\nthe same argument if his complaint was not this inch cut\nbut the combination of chemicals?\nMR. STEVENSON: No, Your Honor. I think that's\na much -- a much harder question because that does, it\nseems to me, get closer to the execution. What's\nanalogous to our claim is a claim where the prison says a\nweek before the execution that we're going to and\neffectively shackle you to a hitching post and not give\nyou any food for 72 hours. We contend that that kind of\ntreatment would be in violation of the Constitution. What\nwe'd be trying to block is that treatment, not the\nexecution. The reality is in this case -\nQUESTION: Well, I mean, you know, as you know,\nwe've -- we've turned down certiorari in -- in these cases\nchallenging the type of drug used. What -- what is the\ndifference between, you know, your using a drug that's -\nthat's going to hurt me and your using a catheter\nprocedure that's going to hurt me? I don't -\nMR. STEVENSON: I think the primary difference,\nJustice Scalia, is that those are a method of execution\ncases. They are challenging the method of execution.\nHere we have a procedure that is not even unique to\nexecutions.\nQUESTION: Well, but -\nMR. STEVENSON: Venous access can -\nQUESTION: -- they're -- they're not challenging\nthe method of execution. If you want to execute me by\ndrugs, they're saying, that's perfectly fine, just don't\nuse a drug that hurts me.\nMR. STEVENSON: Well, it's -- it's -\nQUESTION: And just as here, you're saying if\nyou want to execute me by lethal injection, that's fine,\njust don't use a manner of lethal injection that hurts me.\nI find it very difficult to separate the two -\nMR. STEVENSON: Well, I guess -\nQUESTION: -- categories of case.\nMR. STEVENSON: It's not clear, Your Honor, that\nin all of those cases that they are saying if you want to\nuse a different drug, that's okay. I think that that's\none distinction.\nI think the second distinction is that an order\n-- particularly in States that have statutes dictating\nwhich chemicals can be used, in those cases it may be\neasier for a court to find that an order in that case does\ninvalidate the sentence.\nHere we have a completely severable procedure.\nWe have something that is not in any way required by the\nexecution. And -- and the State is saying we want to do\nit this way, and there are 100 other ways that it can be\ndone. And in fact, it's just the discretionary conduct of\nthe State prison officials that puts us in this situation.\nQUESTION: Well, was it -- was it any more than\nthe presence of his own doctor to make the cut that he -\nhe was asking for?\nMR. STEVENSON: No, Your Honor, and it wasn't\neven -- he wasn't even insisting on that. He was prepared\nto have their doctor come in. He was promised a doctor\nwhen he got to the prison. He never saw one. There was\nnever a physical -- never a doctor to examine him.\nQUESTION: Well, but this isn't a contract\naction.\nMR. STEVENSON: No, no, Your Honor. I'm just\nsuggesting that there was -- he wasn't insisting on this\nbeing carried out in one way. There were dozens of -- of\noffers of -- of carrying this out, including being\nexecuted by electrocution, something else that the State\nrejected as -- as an option for him.\nQUESTION: But he did -- he did want more than a\ndoctor. He didn't want this procedure to be used when\nthere was an alternate procedure that would be safer, less\npainful?\nMR. STEVENSON: Yes. It's our position that\nthis procedure is unconstitutional. It does not comport\nwith contemporary standards of medical decency. It's a\nprocedure that is rarely done. When it's done in the\nhospital, it's under deep sedation. That there are all of\nthese alternative procedures that could be done very\neasily. A percutaneous insertion would be very easy to\naccomplish. There are a lot -\nQUESTION: Doesn't that require a cut as well?\nMR. STEVENSON: No, ma'am. It -- it would just\nrequire a -- a needle, a hollow needle, with a wire\ninside. And -- and they would then access the vein that\nway. It wouldn't require the kind of incision and all of\nthe kind of auxiliary support systems.\nQUESTION: But that sounds to me more like the\nmode of execution with the -- with the drugs that you said\nwas distinguishable.\nMR. STEVENSON: No. They wouldn't effectuate\nthe injection that way. They would just actually get\naccess to the vein that way. And -- and this could be\ndone, Your Honor, 24 hours in advance. It could be done\nsome time in advance. There was no objection expressed by\nMr. Nelson in any of the lower courts to that procedure.\nBut again, all of these issues we never got to\nin the district court. There was never any opportunity to\ndevelop facts, to have discussion, to have argument to\nresolve a basic problem.\nQUESTION: If a challenge is brought to the use\nof lethal injection as a method of execution, how must\nthat be brought? In habeas?\nMR. STEVENSON: Yes. My position, Justice\nO'Connor, would be if I'm representing someone, I would\nput that in a habeas mostly because that's -- there is\nsome historical precedent for those kinds of challenges\ncoming in habeas. I think you are, in effect, saying that\nthe sentence is invalid. It -- it should not be carried\nout.\nQUESTION: This comes close because you say it's\nunconstitutional to proceed with lethal injection under\nthese circumstances.\nMR. STEVENSON: No. We tried really hard to not\nsay that. What we say, it is unconstitutional to proceed\nwith venous access in this manner, to conduct medical care\nin this manner. It violates recognized standards of\nmedical care. And that's what we're saying you cannot do.\nWe have no objection. Mr. Nelson doesn't object to lethal\ninjection. He doesn't even object to venous access. What\nhe objects to is some kind of inhumane cutting by people\nwho are not qualified or competent to do that.\nAnd like any other condition of confinement, the\nfact that he is near an execution, the fact that he has\nbeen scheduled for an execution shouldn't exempt him from\nprotection if the State at the last minute announces that\nthis is what they intend to do. This has not historically\nbeen a big problem. There have been over 700 executions\nin this country involving lethal injections.\nQUESTION: What is -- as a lawyer who works in\nthis area, what do you think is the correct procedure that\nshould be followed in respect to Ford mental incompetence\nclaims or general challenges to a whole big method of\nexecution not just this individual one which arise for the\nfirst time after termination of a first habeas?\nMR. STEVENSON: Well, Justice Breyer, I -- I\nthink you're right. There is a problem. We do have a gap\nin the law in that the Congress did not contemplate the\npossibility of execution claims that arise just as you\ndescribe.\nIn the competency context, this Court created a\nrule, which I think is a very functional rule. I think it\nis a very appropriate rule. If the facts supporting that\nclaim were not ripe previously, I think that -- and it's a\nlegitimate execution-related claim, I think the petitioner\nshould be able to get access in front of the district\ncourt judge that reviewed his initial habeas petition. I\nthink that's the way we should deal -\nQUESTION: Yes, that may be. So what's the\nprocedural route? That's why I'm curious.\nMR. STEVENSON: Yes.\nQUESTION: This fits into a bigger picture.\nMR. STEVENSON: Yes, yes.\nQUESTION: And I'd like to be clear about the\nbigger picture -\nMR. STEVENSON: Yes. The big -\nQUESTION: -- in your opinion.\nMR. STEVENSON: Yes. The bigger picture in my\njudgment, Your Honor, would be it would be filed as a\nhabeas petition in front of that district court judge\nrelying on this Court's -\nQUESTION: And -- and you say that it would be\n-- count as a first habeas.\nMR. STEVENSON: Well, it would be part of the\nfirst habeas. It would -\nQUESTION: Well, what the -- what the response\nto that is it's very hard to reconcile that with the\nlanguage of the statute.\nMR. STEVENSON: Well, what the -\nQUESTION: And -- and also they add that the\nright route is to file an initial habeas here or,\nalternatively, to go to the State court, at least if\nthat's still open.\nMR. STEVENSON: Yes. And -\nQUESTION: In which case it raises no\nconstitutional question about blocking habeas because we\ncould review the State court. I'd just like briefly your\nviews on that kind of an argument.\nMR. STEVENSON: Yes, sir. Well, in Stewart,\nwhat this Court did was resolve it by saying, no, Congress\ndid not intend to preclude petitioners with legitimate\nexecution claims from getting that. This Court has\ncreated those protections. I think -\nQUESTION: Was there -- was there anything open\nto this petitioner in the State for an application for\nrelief here?\nMR. STEVENSON: No, Justice O'Connor,\nunfortunately not. In Alabama you cannot present a second\npost-conviction petition even on claims that -- that turn\non new evidence. On execution claims, on new evidence\nclaims, you have no remedy. And consequently, we would\nneed access to the Federal courts to protect Mr. Nelson\nfrom the kind of claim that we're presenting here or even\nin the kind of claims that Justice Breyer is suggesting.\nAnd that's why we do think there is a problem.\nIt's not presented precisely in this case. There is a\nproblem with the way in which there are these execution\nclaims. If some State says tomorrow, we're going to\nchange our method and from here on out, we're going to\nstone people to death or beat them to death with baseball\nbats, and this Court believes that that is\nunconstitutional, in a place like Alabama, to the extent\nthat -- that the Court construes that as an execution\nclaim -- and that's the only way they could carry out the\nexecution, so it might be said that that would invalidate\nthe conviction and sentence -- we would need a rule. We\nwould need to find some way to get access to courts, and\nwe currently don't have it.\nHere --\nQUESTION: Your -- your claim here is an Eighth\nAmendment claim, cruel and unusual punishment.\nMR. STEVENSON: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: Right?\nBut -- but you say it just doesn't comport with\nwhat? The -- the most advanced medical procedures?\nMR. STEVENSON: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Anything that does not comport with\nthe most advanced medical procedures is cruel and unusual\npunishment?\nMR. STEVENSON: That --\nQUESTION: I mean, you know -\nMR. STEVENSON: No, I hear you. I hear you.\nQUESTION: -- this man is -- is looking death in\nthe face.\nMR. STEVENSON: Sure.\nQUESTION: And -- and the crime was committed\nover a quarter of a century ago for which he was -- he was\ncondemned. And -- and what he's really concerned about is\n-- is an incision? I find it difficult to contemplate\nthat this constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.\nMR. STEVENSON: Well, Your Honor, it's not our\nposition that he is seeking and -- and demanding the most\nadvanced procedures. What I think he is objecting to is\nsomething that we regard as fairly barbaric, to have a\ncorrectional staff member come back with a scalpel, make a\n2-inch cut in his arm, cut through fat and tissue to get\nto a vein with no assurances that that person knows what\nthey're doing, violates the basic standards of medical\ndecency.\nAnd it's not just a cruel and unusual\npunishment. This Court has created a line of cases under\nEstelle v. Gamble that talk about deliberate indifference\nto serious medical needs. This is a medical care case.\nYes, he's in prison. Yes, he's on death row. Yes, he's\nforfeited some of his basic expectations, but he hasn't\ngiven them all away. He's still entitled to be treated\nwith some regard.\nQUESTION: You're saying it's -- it's not the\nEighth Amendment. You're saying it's a medical care case.\nMR. STEVENSON: No. It's -- it's both. We -\nthe complaint raises both the cruel and unusual theory and\na deliberate indifference theory. Both are alleged in the\ncomplaint.\nQUESTION: It just doesn't fit under deliberate\nindifference somehow. It's a little bit like the case\nthat the court of appeals decided that you couldn't use a\nlethal injection because it hadn't been approved by the\nFDA.\nMR. STEVENSON: I -- I agree, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI think it -- it fits more in the cruel and unusual\ncategory because it seems so pointless to be doing it in\nthis way. However, for all of this time, there -- there\nwas no protocol. There was no response. There was no, in\neffect, effort by the State to deal with this problem and\nthat's why we -- we made that allegation of deliberate\nindifference as well. And the district court could make a\ndetermination that says, no, following this case -- this\nline of cases, we -- we can't make that determination.\nBut here, we never got to any of this. We\ndidn't basically have an opportunity -\nQUESTION: But your deliberate indifference\nclaim is also an Eighth Amendment claim, isn't it?\nMR. STEVENSON: Yes, sir. Yes, yes, yes.\nThat's correct. And so we're still dealing with this -\nthe Eighth Amendment universe.\nBut again, the district court was precluded from\ngetting to any of this. If the State wants to come in and\nsay, we think this is silly, we think it is not\nappropriate for the Constitution to create these kinds of\nprotections for these kinds of prisoners, the district\ncourt can make a finding that says, I agree. What\nhappened here, however, was the district court was\nprecluded from ever even engaging in discussion about this\nissue because of this rule that, in effect, blocks people\non death row facing execution and enforcing basic\nconstitutional protections. And that's what we think is\nobjectionable.\nThere are several hundred executions that have\ntaken place, 733, lethal injections that have taken place,\nwhere this has not been a problem. This is an -- an\nunusual medical problem. It's not a medical problem that\nusually presents itself, but it presented itself for the\nfirst time in Alabama. It's only come up a few times.\nBut we do think there ought to be some constitutional\nprotection.\nQUESTION: When -- when did Alabama switch from\nelectrocution to lethal injections?\nMR. STEVENSON: That happened in July of 2002,\nafter Mr. Nelson had already completed his Federal habeas\nprocedure.\nQUESTION: And before that, electrocution was\nthe only option?\nMR. STEVENSON: Yes, sir.\nUnless there are further questions from the\nCourt, I'd like to reserve the rest of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Stevenson.\nMr. Newsom, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN C.

NEWSOM: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI'd like to make three points this morning.\nI'd like to first discuss and to convince the\nCourt that a challenge to a State's means of gaining\nvenous access for purposes of accomplishing a lethal\ninjection, a challenge that runs to the very core of the\nexecution process, is indeed tantamount to a challenge of\nthe imposition of the sentence itself and subject to\nhabeas corpus restrictions.\nI hope also to -- to be able to address the\nremedies issue, which we were discussing with Mr.\nStevenson at the end of -- of his argument.\nAnd third, I'd like to discuss the practical\nconsequences of a decision in Nelson's favor in this case,\nwhich I think will be not only to unleash in Federal\ncourts a torrent of -- of new challenges to all manner of\nState execution procedures, but also in the process,\nfundamentally to undermine Congress' intent to stem the\ntide of what President Clinton in his signing statement\ncalled endless death row appeals.\nQUESTION: On the -- on your first point, are\nyou going to address directly whether this is second or\nsuccessive?\nMR. NEWSOM: I can certainly address that, Your\nHonor, and I can address it now, if you'd like.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. NEWSOM: We simply cannot agree with -- with\n-- with Mr. Stevenson's contention here that this is\nsecond or successive, and I would like to point out to the\nCourt that I -- that I think -\nQUESTION: He says it's not.\nMR. NEWSOM: I'm sorry. That -- that is not\nsecond or successive. I'd like to point out to the Court\nthat I think in fact there is a concession on the record\nin this case that it, in fact, is second or successive.\nMr. Stevenson, of course, has -- has given the Court\nessentially a two-page footnote in his brief trying to\nwalk away from -\nQUESTION: You mean if it's treated as habeas.\nMR. NEWSOM: Correct. Our -- correct. Our\nposition, of course, is that this -- that this sort of\nchallenge is fundamentally a habeas challenge, and in\nanswer to Justice Souter's question, I think that there is\na concession on the record. Of course, this -- this\nissue, the second or successive issue, was not raised in\nthe lower courts. It was raised for the first time in -\nQUESTION: Well, it wasn't raised because he\nbrought 1983. But, I mean, as I understand the -- the\napplication of the Alabama rule, 1983 was ruled out\nbecause this either should have been brought in habeas or\nif it had been brought in habeas, it would have been\nbarred under AEDPA, and it would have been barred under\nAEDPA, because it was second or successive. So I think\nregardless of -- of how we analyze it, we've got to get to\nthat point.\nMR. NEWSOM: And our position certainly is, Your\nHonor, that this would have been barred as second or\nsuccessive. I think Justice Scalia really hit the nail on\nthe head. It is -- Mr. Stevenson, in his argument, just\nhas not done business, I think, with the textual and\nstructural gymnastics required to -- to make this petition\nanything other than second or successive. His position,\nin essence, is that any claim that is new, in the sense\nthat it could not have been brought before, is by\ndefinition not second or successive.\nQUESTION: Well, isn't that a possibility? In\nother words, one of the things we've got to do is -- is\ngive effect to the -- to the AEDPA text. We can give\neffect to the -- I'm not saying that we should read it\nthis way, but we could give effect to the AEDPA text if we\nsay that regardless of whether a claim was ripe or not as\na factual matter, so long as there is new evidence,\nwhatever new means, the evidence is -- is not going to\nentitle him to relief unless it satisfies the -- the\ninnocence prong at the end of the test. We could say that\nand at the same time say, all right, that's how we give\neffect to AEDPA.\nBut if there is something more than ripeness,\nwhich makes the difference between bringing the claim and\nnot bringing the claim, then that goes to whether we\nshould regard it as second or successive. There is\nsomething more here because this is a claim which simply\ndid not arise. He could not have pleaded this claim at\nany point prior to the conclusion of -- of his habeas, and\nfor that reason, we should interpret second or successive\nas not barring this because otherwise we would have a\nuniverse of claims, assuming they are proper habeas\nclaims, that could never be brought even though they state\na constitutional claim.\nMR. NEWSOM: My own sense, Justice Souter, is\nthat that might just be slicing the bologna a little thin.\nCongress -- the -- the point of section 2244 in my view is\ncertainly to get at claims that, for whatever reason,\ncould not have been brought earlier, and I think the -\nQUESTION: But that's -- that's fine, but I\nmean, that's a conclusory statement: for whatever reason.\nWhat I'm suggesting to you is that this is a good reason\nto say that the term, second or successive, does have some\nlimiting effect.\nMR. NEWSOM: Perhaps, but I think that we are\ncoming awfully close simply to -- to reading the\nlimitations that Congress imposed on these sorts of\npetitions out of the statute.\nQUESTION: If Congress felt that way, they\nsimply wouldn't have added the second condition.\nMR. NEWSOM: That's certainly the position\nthat -\nQUESTION: They would have just said the facts\n-- the factual predicate for the claim could not have been\ndiscovered previously through the exercise of due\ndiligence. That describes a situation in which there's no\nway that the person could have brought the constitutional\nclaim.\nMR. NEWSOM: That's precisely -\nQUESTION: But Congress didn't leave it there.\nIt went on to add (ii), the facts underlying the claim\nwould -- would show that the applicant is not guilty of\nthe underlying offense.\nMR. NEWSOM: Which is exactly the point that I'm\ntrying to make about stripping out the limitations. In\nsection 2244 -\nQUESTION: Except that to -- in order to make\nthat point, you have to assume that Congress was adverting\nto this problem, and you have to assume that the words,\nsecond and successive, could -- could simply have been -\nor the word subsequent could have been inserted in place\nof second or successive, which in fact is -- is a set of\nphrases that -- that are terms of art.\nMR. NEWSOM: Well -\nQUESTION: So I think -- I think the argument is\na stretch.\nMR. NEWSOM: It -- it -- I -- I think it is not\nthe case, Your Honor, that -- that second or successive is\na term of art in the sense that -- that AEDPA in section\n2244 merely incorporates the old abuse of the writ\ndoctrine as -- as this Court made -\nQUESTION: It doesn't necessarily incorporate\nthe old abuse of the writ doctrine, but it seems to me\nthat it does allude to a body of law by which we made -\nbecause there was no other law involved, we had to draw\nconclusions as to whether it was appropriate or not\nappropriate to bar this claim. That's the kind of art\nthat those words plug into. If they did want to plug into\nthat, all they had to use was a neutral word like\nsubsequent.\nMR. NEWSOM: Again, Your -- Your Honor, I -- I\nfeel like clearly I'm not convincing you, but I think that\n-- that we are -- that the Court would be coming\nawfully -\nQUESTION: Convince the others.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. NEWSOM: -- that the Court -- the Court is\ncertainly coming awfully close to simply stripping out the\nlimitations on the statute -\nQUESTION: What -- what should happen?\nQUESTION: Isn't -- isn't (B)(i) a description\nof what our prior successive habeas -\nMR. NEWSOM: The -- the --\nQUESTION: -- law was?\nMR. NEWSOM: The Court -\nQUESTION: The first condition alone: the\nfactual predicate for the claim could not have been\ndiscovered previously through the exercise of due\ndiligence.\nMR. NEWSOM: That's absolutely right, and\nthat -\nQUESTION: Isn't that a fair description -\nMR. NEWSOM: -- that's the -\nQUESTION: -- of what our prior second or\nsuccessive law was?\nMR. NEWSOM: I -- I -\nQUESTION: And Congress rejects that by adding\nto it a new -- a new number (ii).\nMR. NEWSOM: Precisely.\nQUESTION: So it's impossible to say that it was\n-- it was simply embracing our prior law.\nMR. NEWSOM: Which is precisely the point we\ntried to make in our brief, that under -\nQUESTION: Well, so can it be brought as a 1983\naction?\nMR. NEWSOM: I don't think it can, Your Honor,\nand -- and I --\nQUESTION: And why not?\nMR. NEWSOM: -- I hope I can convince why it\ncan't. I'd like to start by addressing that position with\nMr. Stevenson's concession here this morning that he has\nreiterated, that the chemical composition claim indeed is\nsubject to habeas corpus restrictions. Of course, he\nseeks to distinguish his own claim from the chemical\ncomposition claim on the basis, he says, that his claim\ndoes not challenge the sentence itself, but merely a\nseparate and unnecessary procedure. But the procedure he\nchallenges is a procedure for gaining venous access. It\ngoes without -\nQUESTION: Well, there are other ways to do\nit -\nMR. NEWSOM: Well -\nQUESTION: -- is his point. And it is a little\ncurious that the State isn't willing to talk to the\nprisoner's counsel about considering one of the other ways\nof doing it. Why is that?\nMR. NEWSOM: Well, let me just -- if I could\nanswer in two parts.\nFirst, I think frankly that -- that on the\nrecord in this case, he's just not right about that. The\nrecord at pages 91 and 93 of the joint appendix makes\nclear that the specific procedure that he has challenged\nhere, this cut-down procedure, will be used only as a last\nresort in the event that other means of gaining venous\naccess -\nQUESTION: Well, does that mean that -- what is\nthe description of the other? The -\nMR. NEWSOM: The percutaneous central line\nplacement.\nQUESTION: Percutaneous. Is that something the\nState is prepared to use first?\nMR. NEWSOM: By all means. And that's part of\nthe irony of this case.\nQUESTION: And you make that assurance to us\ntoday.\nMR. NEWSOM: Oh, absolutely. And -- and in\nfact, the -- the affidavits that we filed make that\nassurance.\nQUESTION: That will be attempted.\nMR. NEWSOM: Yes. And -- and let me just be\nclear that -- that the State, of course, has outlined a\nthree-step process in this case. Steps one and two are a\ncentral line placement in the femoral vein and a central\nline placement in the jugular vein in the neck. Both of\nthose, in essence, are percutaneous central line\nplacements. So the parties are in agreement here that the\nfirst two procedures attempted should, in fact, be\npercutaneous central line placement.\nThis cut-down procedure comes into play only in\nthe event that those two procedures fail and as a last\nresort must be used to accomplish the sentence.\nQUESTION: Are you sure, Mr. Newsom -\nQUESTION: Mr. Newsom, can I ask you a -- a\nhypothetical question? Because -- assume there's merit on\nthe -- to the -- assume -- assume you have a case in which\na week before the election -- the execution the State\ntells the inmate that they're going to hang him up by his\nthumbs and beat him with whips until he dies. And he\nnever expected that. What is his remedy in the -- in your\ncircuit and in Alabama for trying to stop that?\nMR. NEWSOM: Well, the important point here -\nand I -\nQUESTION: If -- if any. Is there a remedy?\nMR. NEWSOM: Sure, absolutely. And I can't\nagree, of course, with Mr. Stevenson's description of\nAlabama law. I think that there very clearly are remedies\nin the State courts, and his argument essentially asks the\n-- this Court to ignore those -- the entire State system.\nWith respect to two of the remedies -\nQUESTION: What would the remedy be in Alabama?\nIt would be a habeas corpus proceeding?\nMR. NEWSOM: Well, he is, of course -- I -- I\nshould just be careful about how I answer this question.\nThere is an Alabama procedure called a rule 32 petition\nwhich is -- is, in effect, a -- a State habeas petition to\nchallenge things like this. And his -- his position in\nhis reply brief is that -- that a rule 32 petition would\nhave been time barred. That may be true now, but it was\nnot true as of the time that he filed this petition.\nQUESTION: Well, let's assume he -- assume he's\ndenied relief in the Alabama courts. What can he do? Can\nhe get into Federal court?\nMR. NEWSOM: May I just -\nQUESTION: And if so, how?\nMR. NEWSOM: May -- may I continue with the\nAlabama courts just on a minute because that's not -\nthat's not -- I'm not done with the Alabama courts, in\nessence. I mean, there -- there are other remedies that\nwe've outlined in --\nQUESTION: But you -- you said if this happened\ntoday, that rule 32 procedure would not be available.\nMR. NEWSOM: I think very arguably. It comes\ndown frankly to how you -- at -- at what point that the\nstatute of limitations begins to run. Our position, of\ncourse -\nQUESTION: The law wasn't changed. You just say\nmore time has gone by, that -- that he could have brought\na rule 32 at the time, but he can't now because more time\nhas gone by. Is that your point?\nMR. NEWSOM: Rule 32 statute of limitations is a\n-- is a 6-month statute of limitations that begins running\nat the time new -- a new factual predicate is discovered.\nQUESTION: I see.\nMR. NEWSOM: That -- that -- if -- if the\nstatute began to ran -- began -- began to run, as -- as we\nwould say, on August 19th of 2003, when the record at\npages 25 and 26 of the joint appendix makes plain that he\nknew that a cut-down was a possibility as a means of\ngaining access to his veins, then yes, that statute has\nexpired.\nIf, as Mr. Stevenson has pointed out to the\nCourt today, that statute began to ran not -- began to run\n-- why do I keep saying that -- began to run on October\n3rd of 2003, then the truth is he has 4 or 5 more days to\nfile that rule 32 petition.\nBut I want to get to the other remedies, if I\ncan.\nQUESTION: Can he -- can he get a stay?\nQUESTION: Well, I'm not really so much\ninterested in the State remedy. I assume that an Alabama\njudge says it was a terrible crime, he deserves that\npunishment. And now what does he -- can he get into\nFederal court?\nMR. NEWSOM: He can get into -\nQUESTION: And if so, how?\nMR. NEWSOM: He can -- of course, by all means.\nThis Court retains the discretion, as it always does, to\ngrant in an extraordinary circumstance an original writ of\nhabeas corpus. And I -\nQUESTION: You mean he should apply for an\noriginal writ in this Court? That's his remedy?\nMR. NEWSOM: Well, not -\nQUESTION: If -- if that's not the remedy, is\nthere a remedy in the district court in Alabama?\nMR. NEWSOM: There is not I think a remedy in\nlower Federal courts. But I should just emphasize that\nthis Court has -- has discussed a case very similar to\nthis and dealt with a case very similar to this in Allen\nv. McCurry where the Court refused to indulge -\nQUESTION: Well now, if there is no remedy in\nthe Federal district court, why should there not be a 1983\nremedy?\nMR. NEWSOM: Well, because our -- our position,\nYour Honor, is that 1983 is not intended to be used to\nfill the gaps in the remedial scheme that Congress has\nspecifically set up in the habeas statutes, that instead\nsection 1983 deals with different kinds of claims.\nQUESTION: Do you think AEDPA amended 1983?\nMR. NEWSOM: No. But the point is, of course,\nAEDPA does not have, in effect, an integration clause in\nit that -- that precludes review of all -- under all other\nstatutory sources of review. But this Court's decision -\nQUESTION: If AEDPA had never been passed, would\nthere be a remedy under 1983?\nMR. NEWSOM: No. I think then it -- then it\nclearly -- it's a -- it's a habeas petition however you -\nhowever you view it, and -- and our -\nQUESTION: If the only thing -- say it's a\nperson who's not on death row who's going to be subjected\nto this kind of treatment for 6 days. Would he have a\nremedy under 1983?\nMR. NEWSOM: To be sure. And that I think is a\n-- is a categorical distinction. I don't disagree with\nMr. Stevenson that -- that a -- that a cut-down occurring\nfor purposes of venous access, wholly divorced from an\nexecution, is indeed a valid conditions of confinement\nclaim.\nBut this simply is not a conditions of\nconfinement case. This is, to be sure, a procedure of -\nthe means of gaining venous access for the purposes of -\nof carrying out a lethal injection. Venous access, of\ncourse, is a necessary predicate, as Nelson has\nacknowledged in his briefing in this case, to -- to the -\nQUESTION: You were going to -- you were going\nto tell us that, you know, the sky is going to fall if we\nfind that this is 1983.\nMR. NEWSOM: I think it will fall pretty hard,\nJustice Kennedy. I think that if -- if this Court\nconcludes that -- that Nelson in this case can -- can\nchallenge this -- this cut-down as a means of gaining\nvenous access, then the -- the lower courts will be\ninundated with -- with challenges to all manner of State\nexecution procedures just as this Court was inundated with\nchallenges following -\nQUESTION: Well, there are a lot of ways to deal\nwith that. One, you could say on the merits, if they're\nnot valid, they're not valid.\nMR. NEWSOM: That's -\nQUESTION: If they are valid, why shouldn't they\nbe able to make it?\nMR. NEWSOM: Well, that certainly is one way of\n-- of dealing with the problem, Your Honor, but -\nQUESTION: Or there's the equitable problem -\nQUESTION: How long do the appeals take?\nMR. NEWSOM: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: The district court says it's not\nvalid. Get out of here. Then there's appeal to the court\nof appeals and then certiorari here. How long does it\ntake?\nQUESTION: And suppose in a case where there is\nwhips and so forth, he happens, by the way, actually to\nhave a valid claim because they're going to be tortured.\nAll right. Now, you're saying there's no remedy for such\na person.\nMR. NEWSOM: In answer -\nQUESTION: And indeed, the reason there's no\nremedy is because the courts are unable to use their\nnormal rules to prevent abuse of process.\nMR. NEWSOM: Let me try to answer these various\nquestions in order, if I can keep up.\nWith respect to your first question, I think\nthat to be sure, there is -- the -- the district court can\nalways reject the claim, but the problem is that when\nthese claims come in at the last minute and the complaint\nis chock full of -- of inflammatory language, then the\ndistrict courts I think in -- in many cases will feel\nvirtually coerced into granting the stay. And the stay\nitself is -- is an imposition or an impediment to the\nState's imposition of the sentence.\nQUESTION: But there's nothing in the language.\nI mean, as I read the language of 1983, it says there will\nbe an action, if I'm subject to the deprivation of a right\nsecured by the Constitution, which is what his claim is.\nSo it fits within the language.\nMR. NEWSOM: To be sure.\nQUESTION: And there's nothing in the habeas\nstatute that suggests it fits because habeas is when\nyou're challenging a custody in violation of the\nConstitution. So the habeas language doesn't apply and\n1983 does apply.\nAnd there's nothing in Preiser that suggests it\nfits because that's where in fact we're talking about a\nchallenge to fact or duration, and he's not challenging\nthe fact and he's not challenging the duration.\nAnd there's nothing in Heck v. Humphrey because\nit talks about necessarily implying the invalidity of the\nconviction or sentence, and he's not talking about the\nconviction and he's not talking about the sentence that\nwas given in the judgment anyway.\nAll right. So how is it we get this claim which\nrisks people who might have a valid claim not getting into\ncourt -\nMR. NEWSOM: Okay. Now -\nQUESTION: -- into the language of any prior\ncase or the statute itself?\nMR. NEWSOM: Bear with me. Section 1983, to be\nsure, does not exclude this claim as a matter of its text,\nbut this Court in Preiser did make clear that -- that\nwhere a -- where an action falls within the traditional\nscope of habeas corpus, that section 1983 must give way.\nWhen there is that intersection, section 1983 must give\nway.\nNow, in answer to part two of the question, to\nbe sure, the habeas corpus -- the -- the specific language\nof the habeas corpus statute talks in terms of custody,\nbut for more than 100 years, this Court has dealt with\nchallenges to death sentences in habeas corpus petitions.\nAnd indeed, in Your Honor's opinion for the Court in\nLonchar, this Court said that -- that -\nQUESTION: You're right about that.\nMR. NEWSOM: Bear with me. Citing Gomez and -\nand reiterated that habeas restrictions apply to suits\nchallenging the method of execution regardless of the\ntechnical form of action.\nQUESTION: Gomez was 10 years and a claim that\ncould have been brought much earlier. As was just\nexplained to us, this claim could not have been brought\nuntil 6 days before the scheduled date of execution\nbecause it was only at that point that he -- that he knew\nabout this. So I don't think that Gomez -\nBut I did want to ask you something you said\nthat seemed to me inconsistent with what -- what Mr.\nStevenson told us. You said that it was only the -- they\n-- they agreed on what would be the first steps and that\nincorporated the percutaneous. I thought we were told by\nMr. Stevenson that, no, everybody agreed on what the first\nprocedure would be, but you then went immediately to the\ncut-down and they didn't. There was an intermediate step\nthat you don't have in your protocol that they said would\nhave been more respectful of this man's right to have a\npainless death.\nMR. NEWSOM: I think that's just not quite\nright. Percutaneous central line placement simply means\ncentral line placement through the skin.\nQUESTION: But was there -- whatever labels you\nuse, was there something else that they asked for that you\nwere not willing to give?\nMR. NEWSOM: They -- I'm sorry. Go ahead. I\ndidn't mean to -\nQUESTION: Yes. I thought I understood from the\nbriefs that there was the first step. Everybody agreed if\ncould do it that way, it would be okay. And then there\nwas something else that the defendant said should have\nbeen done before you would ever get to the cut-down, and\nif you got to the cut-down, certainly you'd want to have\nproper medical personnel there to administer it.\nMR. NEWSOM: The point that I'm trying to make\nis that -- that in fact those first two -- what the -\nwhat the plaintiffs asked for in this case was indeed\npercutaneous central line placement. That's the label not\nthat I'm giving it but that they gave it. That's the\nprocedure that they wanted, and now I'm trying to tell the\nCourt that -- that percutaneous central line placement is\na central line placement through the skin which options\none and two, central line placement in the thigh, central\nline placement in the neck, are indeed both percutaneous\ncentral line placement. So, no, there is -- I think there\nis no disagreement here that percutaneous central line\nplacement is the preferred method and will, in fact, be\nused, a cut-down to be used only if actually necessary.\nQUESTION: I'll ask Mr. Stevenson to clarify\nthat.\nMR. NEWSOM: Fair enough.\nAnd if I can, just in answer to the -- to the\nfirst question that you were asking me, my -- the point\nthat I was making about Gomez at this point in the\nargument is not necessarily, although I'd like to make\nthis point as well, if I have time, an abuse point so\nmuch. We certainly recognize that the abuse at issue in\nGomez is in some sense more -- more egregious than the\nabuse here. The point I was simply trying to make in\nanswer -- in answer to Justice Breyer's question was that\nthis Court in Lonchar pointed to Gomez for the proposition\nthat habeas rules apply to method of execution claims\nwithout respect to what label is placed at the top of the\npleading.\nQUESTION: It wasn't an issue in that case, was\nit? I was simply describing what happened. I mean, it\nwas true -\nMR. NEWSOM: Accurately describes.\nQUESTION: -- in that case it was -- yes,\naccurately described it. Nobody challenged it. So I\nwouldn't think that's terrifically strong precedent for\nthe proposition that that is what should have happened.\nMR. NEWSOM: Well, I think -- I think it is\nfairly clear, Your Honor, from Gomez and Lonchar, read\ntogether, that method of execution -\nQUESTION: But is there anything other than -\nother than -- Lonchar, which is describing the posture of\nthe case as it appeared here on a different issue?\nQUESTION: I thought we had a lot of cases that\n-- that say you can bring habeas to challenge not only -\nQUESTION: That's what I want to know. I want\nto know which are the ones -\nQUESTION: Let's go one at a time. Go ahead.\nQUESTION: I thought that it -- it was our law\nthat -- that you can bring a habeas action to show that\nyou are not guilty of the sentence, which always seemed to\nme a very strange formulation, but it's -- it's been done\nin a lot of cases.\nMR. NEWSOM: I think it is unquestionably\ncorrect, Justice Scalia, that this Court has held that\nhabeas is an appropriate vehicle for a method of execution\nclaim or otherwise. And my point in answer to Justice\nBreyer is I think that this Court's decisions in Gomez and\nLonchar, read together, make -- come pretty close to\nsaying that it is the appropriate -- the appropriate\nvehicle for challenging a method -\nQUESTION: So those are the two cases which you\nfeel are the strongest support for you.\nMR. NEWSOM: The strongest support I think, yes,\nfor the -- for the fact that a -- that a habeas -- that\nhabeas is -- is the appropriate vehicle for a method of\nexecution claim.\nAnd I should just be clear -- and we're getting\nback here to Justice Kennedy's question -- that if -- if\nwe're rolling back habeas all the way to simply the fact\nof the sentence and you can challenge nothing other than\nto say I should not have been sentenced to the death\npenalty, then we have a -- an even bigger floodgates issue\nthan I had -- had at first imagined. District courts\ntomorrow will be dealing with everything short of I should\nnot have been sentenced to the death penalty under section\n1983 without the protections that Congress built in -\nbuilt into AEDPA to protect against that very floodgates\nproblem.\nQUESTION: But this is -- you made the point\nearlier that if this man were just in his cell and under a\nterm of years, that this would be an entirely proper 1983\ncase. That's not the same for somebody who's says I'm\ninnocent of the death penalty. That -- that one -- you\ncan say, oh, yes, that's habeas and nothing else. Here,\nyou've already said exactly what they're doing to him, if\nthey had done it in order to get access to his vein for\nsome other procedure while he's incarcerated, it would be\na good, plain 1983 claim. But somehow when it gets to be\nconnected with how he's going to die, it's no longer a\n1983.\nMR. NEWSOM: To be sure. There -- there is\nclearly some common sense line between a pure conditions\nof confinement claim, the fellow in his cell that has to\nhave the cut-down for some other purpose, and the -- the\nfellow on death row who has to have the cut-down as a\nmeans of gaining access to his veins for purposes of\naccomplishing a lethal injection. Without the venous\naccess, there is no lethal injection.\nI think there is a very real difference between\nthose two situations, and I can't, as I'm standing here,\npromise you that I know precisely where that line is\nbetween the outer bounds of an execution procedures claim\nand the outer bounds of a conditions of confinement claim,\nbut what I can tell you is that this claim runs to the\nvery core of the State's execution process.\nQUESTION: Well, but -- but is it? I mean, you\n-- you said without venous access, there -- there is no -\nthere's no execution by lethal injection. But there is\nexecution by lethal injection without cut-down. And -\nand the question in each case is is the cut-down\ngratuitous. Calling the cut-down gratuitous for purposes\nof injection does not challenge the legality of injection.\nMR. NEWSOM: It just strikes me, Justice Souter,\nthat that with respect -- well, let me answer in two ways.\nFirst, as I said earlier, I think the record in\nthis case is clear that the cut-down becomes a live issue\nonly in -- in the event that it is necessary.\nPoint two, and I think the more important point,\nis that it just strikes me as a bad way to administer the\nrule on a going-forward basis for a district court to have\nto sift through on a procedure-by-procedure basis to\ndetermine is this procedure in fact medically,\nscientifically necessary to accomplish the sentence, in\nwhich case Mr. Stevenson I think concedes that it's a\nhabeas petition, but it's not.\nQUESTION: What you're doing is asking all the\ncourts, including this one, to ignore the very issue and\nsimply say, in effect, under AEDPA we don't care. I mean,\nwe're somewhere between the devil and the deep blue sea\nhere, and -- and I would suppose there -- there ought to\nbe a middle ground.\nMR. NEWSOM: I certainly am not suggesting in\nany -- to any extent that -- and I don't think it's true\n-- that -- that to extent that, say, a -- a technically\nunnecessary but nonetheless chosen procedure for gaining\nvenous access is unreviewable. That's the point -- that's\nthe discussion that I was having with Justice -\nQUESTION: That's I thought is what he wanted\nreviewed. He wants to be able to litigate the necessity\nof this. He claims that it is gratuitous. That's his\npoint.\nMR. NEWSOM: Right. And -- and our point is -\nis that that is fine if he wants to litigate and we will\nlitigate and fight him tooth and nail in the appropriate\nforum. The appropriate forum in this case -\nQUESTION: There is no appropriate forum because\nthe appropriate forum was closed to him before you\nannounced, A, that you were going to execute him by\ninjection and, B, that you were going to use this\nprocedure as a last resort.\nMR. NEWSOM: With respect, Justice Souter, the\nappropriate forum in this case exists. It exists in the\nState court system. It is -- it simply is not the case\nthat Mr. -- that Mr. Nelson is out of luck entirely\nwithout a 1983 -\nQUESTION: Well, let's try this again. What\nprocedure is open to him in the State of Alabama? We were\ntold that no procedure was.\nMR. NEWSOM: Your Honor, I think that there\ncertainly are procedures. We outlined procedures in our\nbrief, namely, the two that we have not discussed to this\npoint were that Mr. Nelson could have filed a response to\nthe State's motion to set the execution date, and two, he\ncould have filed a motion to stay the execution in State\ncourt. Now -\nQUESTION: Well, we're talking about now. What\nis open to the prisoner today -\nMR. NEWSOM: Those -\nQUESTION: -- in Alabama?\nMR. NEWSOM: Those procedures, Your Honor, are\nin fact open to -- to the prisoner today because when this\nCourt stayed the execution, the death warrant expired. We\nwill now need to go back to the Alabama Supreme Court,\neven -- even in the event that we prevail here and ask for\na new death warrant, at which point Mr. Nelson can -- can\nparticipate in the State process -\nQUESTION: And do you represent he can get a\nhearing on the merits of his arguments in one of those\nprocedures?\nMR. NEWSOM: What I -- what I can represent to\nthe Court is that I am certainly not aware of any\nprocedural bars that exist to him participating in either\none of those processes, and that certainly with respect to\nMr. Nelson, we would -- we would be glad to waive any\nprocedural bar that did exist. We would certainly expect\nthe -\nQUESTION: So that there could be a factual\nhearing on -- on the necessity of the -- and the -- and\nthe medical propriety of these procedures?\nMR. NEWSOM: Sure. If he -- if he chooses, as\n-- as we hope he will -- as we hope he would have and now\nhope he will, to participate in the State process, he will\nget a hearing on the merits of his Eighth Amendment claim.\nAnd again, I'm not suggesting -\nQUESTION: But -- but if he does and loses, his\nonly access to the Federal courts is by a petition for an\noriginal writ here.\nMR. NEWSOM: That's right and that's -- that's\nvery close, Your Honor, to the -- to the very situation\nthat this Court dealt with in Allen v. McCurry.\nQUESTION: He would also have the opportunity to\nseek a stay, would he not, from this Court from the\ndecision of the Alabama court saying that his Eighth\nAmendment claim was -\nMR. NEWSOM: To -- to be sure. This Court\nalways retains cert jurisdiction over merits\ndeterminations of State courts.\nQUESTION: Would we have to go into the question\nof whether that's a suspension of the writ of habeas\ncorpus in a case, say, much worse than this one? It's\nhorrendous. He couldn't raise it before. No access to a\nFederal district court.\nMR. NEWSOM: I don't think, Justice Breyer, that\nthis case even presents a suspension -\nQUESTION: No, no, no. But just imagine this\ncase with much horrible circumstance because your rule of\nlaw is the same, irrespective of the horror of the\ncircumstance. So there would be no claim but a State\ncourt for a person who could never had brought a Federal\nhabeas because the issue didn't arise. Is that a\nsuspension of the writ of habeas corpus not in time of\nwar?\nMR. NEWSOM: I think it's not in this Court -\nQUESTION: And you'd refer me, because there's\nonly a minute, to read on that so I'd become convinced\nwhat?\nMR. NEWSOM: Please read Felker. This Court's\ndecision in Felker is quite clear that pointing\nspecifically to section 2244, this Court said Congress, by\nand large, gets to make judgments about the scope of the\nwrit. Section 2244 is not a suspension. We're not even\nin the ball park of an across-the-board bar on -- on\njurisdiction.\nQUESTION: But if we -- we're doing 1983, then\nthere's no -- there's no exhaustion requirement.\nThere's -\nMR. NEWSOM: That's -- that's certainly true,\nbut I guess it assumes that -- that I'm wrong about -\nabout the nature of this claim. Our position, of course,\nas I've tried to convince the Court -\nQUESTION: But you've said it is a good 1983\nclaim except if it -- if it is in relation to the\nadministration of the death sentence.\nMR. NEWSOM: Your -- that's right, Your Honor,\nand this will give me I think a -- as good an opportunity\nas I can to try to sum up our position in this case.\nWe have certainly made the argument that a\nchallenge to a State's means of gaining venous access, a\nchallenge to -- to a procedure for carrying out an\nexecution is in and of itself -- should be understood to\nbe a challenge to the sentence itself and subject to\nhabeas corpus restrictions.\nThe State amici, the 30 States who have\nparticipated in this case on our behalf, have made very\nstrongly the argument that a -- that a stay of execution\nin and of itself should be understood as a challenge to\nthe sentence.\nThe Court need not go so far in either respect\nwith us today. All we ask the Court to hold today is that\nwhere -- where an inmate both challenges a procedure for\ncarrying out his execution and, in essence, tries to tell\nthe State, dictate to the State how to go about conducting\nthat execution, and seeks a stay of that execution to give\nhimself time to engage in that reordering of the process,\nthat that should be understood as a challenge to the\nsentence.\nQUESTION: May I -\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Newsom.\nMr. Stevenson, you have 8 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRYAN STEVENSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. STEVENSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI -- I'd like to start first by -- by trying\ndesperately to -- to inform this Court that there is no\nremedy available to Mr. Nelson in State court. I\nappreciate Mr. Newsom's argument on this point, but rule\n32 is not an available option. I -\nQUESTION: Before you go into that, would you\nclarify one thing for me I want? Did they object in the\ndistrict court to -- on the ground there was a failure to\nexhaust State remedies?\nMR. STEVENSON: No, they did not. No, Justice\nStevens. There's never been any -\nQUESTION: And the district court did not rule\non the claim that there was --\nMR. STEVENSON: Absolutely, and the problem here\nis, again, none of these issues were -- were permitted to\n-- to develop.\nLet me just start with the State court question.\nRule 32 has the same kind of factual innocence\nrequirement. For the 6-month time line that Mr. Newsom\nwas talking about, yes, you can file a new successive\nState court petition under rule 32, but just as you have\nto in the Federal context, the State court petition has to\nallege factual innocence.\nIn footnote 19 of our reply brief, I cite a\ncase, Tarver v. State. It's a case where immediately\nbefore an execution, the prosecutor admitted that he had\nexcluded African Americans from jury service in a\ndiscriminatory manner. He said here's our new evidence.\nThe execution be -- should be stopped. The Court of\nCriminal Appeals and the Alabama Supreme Court held no.\nNew evidence claims must go to factual innocence. That's\n32.1(e). There is no remedy available.\nMr. Newsom talks about filing something in the\nState supreme court. The State supreme court of Alabama\nhas no jurisdiction -\nQUESTION: But that's a little different from a\ncase that alleges a current impending constitutional\nviolation.\nMR. STEVENSON: Yes, Your Honor. And I could\nspeak to that because in the other case we cite in\nfootnote 19, we did that too. In the first Tarver case,\nthis Court had granted cert on the constitutionality of\nexecution by electrocution. The case was pending at this\nCourt. We went to the State courts of Alabama saying,\nlook, the State supreme -- the United States Supreme Court\nis about to review this. We've got new evidence that\nelectrocutions in Alabama are being conducted in an\nunconstitutional manner. Let us in. No. Your method of\nexecution claim is not cognizable because the 2-year\nstatute of limitations at that time is an absolute bar.\nThe courts have no jurisdiction to adjudicate any\nconstitutional claim unless it is a new evidence innocence\nclaim. The Alabama Supreme Court has no jurisdiction to\ngive us a merits review on this issue.\nQUESTION: We were told there were a couple of\nother methods besides rule 32.\nMR. STEVENSON: There are none, Justice\nO'Connor. The only thing we could do is file a motion for\na stay. At the point at which the stay motion was\nrequested here, April of 2000, Mr. Nelson didn't want a\nstay. He doesn't want a stay of execution. He actually\nwants his execution to be carried out.\nQUESTION: Well, he did ask for a stay you said,\nin order that this could be resolved.\nMR. STEVENSON: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: So, as I understand it, he does want\na stay in order that this can be heard.\nMR. STEVENSON: Well, he wants a stay to -- he\nwants to enjoin the kind of conduct that we're talking\nabout here, but filing a stay motion in the Alabama\nSupreme Court would not get him merits review where we\ncould present the kind of facts that we're now presenting.\nAnd I have to say that access to the Federal\ncourts in this case has really changed the State's\nposition. Nothing that we've been talking about here this\nafternoon about what they intend to do was ever presented\nto Mr. Nelson until he got in front of the Federal judge.\nIn front of the Federal judge, they said for the first\ntime, we will try to do a peripheral stick, not\npercutaneous invasion. It's a different procedure. And\nat page 109 of our joint appendix, the district court\nfinds -- and I'm reading here -- the defendants have\noffered no explanation as to why they intend to use a cut\ndown procedure instead of a percutaneous central line\nplacement.\nThey have never made that offer. They're making\nit here today. It's because we're in court, and of\ncourse, we can't get to court unless this Court recognizes\nour authority to bring a legitimate challenge that does\nnot attempt to invalidate his conviction or sentence.\nThere is a gap.\nQUESTION: Well, what we heard today, does that\nsatisfy the prisoner's request that these -- all of these\nother things be used first?\nMR. STEVENSON: Well, if -- if the State had\nthen and would now concede that percutaneous line\nplacement would be an acceptable method, then yes. That's\nall we were seeking. But of course, without a remedy -\nQUESTION: Is that not what was said today?\nMR. STEVENSON: Well, it's not said in a way\nthat we can enforce, Your Honor. Until we can go to the\ndistrict court, go to a court, and enforce any of these\nrepresentations, we are at risk. And that's all we're\nasking. That's all Mr. Nelson asked in the first\ninstance.\nAnd the irony, of course, is if it had been\npermitted to proceed, I think we would have resolved this.\nHe'd already be executed. And I think their conduct today\nstrengthens that position. And that's why we would\nurgently ask this Court to reverse the rule that the\nEleventh Circuit is now applying which bars prisoners like\nMr. Nelson from getting Federal review. It's not asking a\nlot.\nAnd I understand the fears, but I don't agree\nwith Mr. Newsom that this is opening up anything. People\ncan file complaints now. They could have done it for the\nlast 20 years. But district courts are not obligated to\nreview those complaints. The PLRA puts restrictions on\n1983 actions. The habeas corpus right permits -- creates\nrestrictions.\nWhat this Court shouldn't do out of fear is to\nblock prisoners like Mr. Nelson who have legitimate\nconstitutional complaints from getting remedies that are\nprecisely the kinds of claims that could and should be\nresolved in the manner that they've been discussed about\n-- discussed today easily. We tried to exhaust the\nadministrative remedies, but until we got in front a\nFederal judge, no one would allow us to be heard. And\nthat's simply the problem that we face in this case and\nwhy relief is required. And I think that's why there\nought to be the kind of Federal -- Federal remedy that\nJustice Breyer has indicated because without it, our\nprisoners are at risk.\nUnless there are further questions, I'll -- I'll\nrest -\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nStevenson.\n"
