        "content": "(11:01 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear -- we'll\nhear argument next in No. 01-595, the United States\nagainst Ruiz.\nGeneral Olson.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe Ninth Circuit has created a new\nconstitutional rule for guilty pleas that is neither\nrequired by the Constitution nor warranted by this Court's\nprevious decisions. Its inevitable effect would be to\ncomplicate and expose to collateral attack confessions of\nguilt which -- which account for approximately 95 percent\nof all convictions in the Federal system and to stifle the\nmarket for plea bargains, which this Court has described\nas an essential component of the administration of\njustice.\nThe Ninth Circuit held that an accused cannot\nenter a valid guilty plea unless he is first given all\nevidence in the prosecutor's possession which would have a\nreasonable probability of discouraging him from pleading\nguilty.\nThe Ninth Circuit's rule, new rule, is not a\nlogical extension of the Brady -- Brady v. Maryland, which\nis premised on concern over the constitutional fairness of\ncriminal trials. Brady and its progeny require disclosure\nonly when necessary to ensure a fair trial. In fact, in\nBrady itself, the Court was explicit to point out that it\n-- that decision was premised on the avoidance of an\nunfair trial to the accused. The subsequent cases, which\nhave expanded upon or interpreted or explained Brady, have\nbeen even more specific with respect to the limitations on\nthe scope of Brady.\nIn U.S. v. Agurs, the Court said the prosecutor\nwill not have violated his constitutional duty unless his\nomission is of sufficient significance to result in the\ndenial of a fair trial.\nSomething similar was said in U.S. v. Bagley.\nBrady's purpose is not to displace the adversary system as\nthe primary means by which truth is uncovered. If it did\nnot deprive a defendant of a fair trial, there is no\nconstitutional violation.\nQUESTION: Can we get to your main argument\nabout Brady, that is, Brady in all its aspects is a trial\nright, not a pretrial right, in view of the plea agreement\nin this case, which represents that you have already\nturned over the prime Brady material and the only question\nis the impeaching material?\nMR. OLSON: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. The\nagreement to which Justice Ginsburg is referring is set\nout -- the two paragraphs of that agreement --\nQUESTION: 45a and 46a of the petition for cert.\nMR. OLSON: Yes, and I also have it on -- on\npage 12 of the joint appendix.\nQUESTION: What -- what --\nMR. OLSON: Page 12 of the joint appendix. It's\nthe --\nQUESTION: -- the petition.\nMR. OLSON: It's -- it's on page 14a of the\npetition -- of the appendix to the petition for\ncertiorari.\nQUESTION: It's the Government's representation\nthat any information establishing the factual innocence of\nthe defendant known to the prosecutor has been turned over\nto the defendant. And so my question is, isn't that, at\nleast in this case, a moot issue? You do have the\nquestion about the impeaching material.\nMR. OLSON: The answer to that, Justice\nGinsburg, is that both in the Sanchez decision and in this\ncase, the Ruiz decision, the Ninth Circuit went further\nand made it clear that it was applying the rule that it\napplied in this case to all exculpatory material which, if\nknown to the defendant, might cause the defendant not to\nplead guilty. Now, the undertaking that was made in the\nparticular proposed agreement here went a little bit\nfurther in the direction of the defendant, which often\nhappens. Prosecutors frequently will decide, for one\nreason or another, to give exculpatory information of some\nsort to a defendant. But the Ninth Circuit went further\nthan that and made it clear that the rule that it was\nenunciating applied to all exculpatory material, including\nimpeachment material, and that is the rule that's going to\nbe applicable in the Ninth Circuit.\nSo, even if this Court determined to limit its\ndecision to the -- the narrower scope, as articulated in\nthe second paragraph of that proposed agreement, we'd be\nback here next year because it's quite clear what the\nNinth Circuit intends to do with its rule.\nQUESTION: I -- I don't --\nQUESTION: The statement referred to on page\n14a, the Government represents -- that -- that was not\npursuant to any court order, I take it, the Government\nturning that over?\nMR. OLSON: No, it was not, Mr. Chief Justice.\nThis was a -- simply a -- a draft agreement which was, in\nfact, prepared in response -- as a result of and in\nresponse to the earlier Sanchez decision, which -- which\nthe Ninth Circuit had articulated. This was an effort by\nthe prosecutor --\nQUESTION: I was -- I was going to ask why --\nwhy is that second paragraph there? It wouldn't have\noccurred to me to --\nMR. OLSON: It's -- it's not in the record,\nJustice Scalia, but it's my understanding that it's\nsomething that is -- is developed particularly to deal\nwith the Sanchez case which the Ninth Circuit had already\ndecided, and the presumption that the Ninth -- the Ninth\nCircuit's Sanchez decision went so far and not as far as\nthe -- that that covered the impeachment material, but not\nother exculpatory material in the reverse.\nSo, however inartful this is, it was not in\nresponse, Mr. Chief Justice, to a court order or any other\nlegal requirement, nor does it purport to articulate what\nthe law is. It purports to undertake what the prosecutor\nvoluntarily was willing to do with respect to this\nparticular form of plea --\nQUESTION: Has this been used throughout the\ncountry --\nMR. OLSON: No.\nQUESTION: -- or just --\nMR. OLSON: This is -- this was developed just\nin the San Diego -- the Southern District of California,\nalthough other versions in other places, but there's no\nstandard national form for plea agreements.\nQUESTION: I -- I know what you'd like is that\nwe reach the question of this impeachment material and say\nthere is no such right in a -- in a plea agreement\ncontext. But how would I even get there? They only get\nan appeal here if there's a violation of law. I never\nheard of a violation of law consisting of a judge refusing\nto depart.\nAnd then assuming that there is some violation\nof law in his refusal to depart, which I thought was\ndiscretionary, how could he possibly depart? And this is\nimportant to you. Because I don't see at the moment how\nit would ever be a justification to depart, that a\ndefendant has entered into this program. I mean, I can't\nfind anything in the guidelines where it says \"you can\ndepart for a reason such as,\" and then fill in the content\nof the program to get a two-level departure.\nSo, how -- how do we get to your issue and what\ndo I do about those two things which seem tremendous\nblocks?\nMR. OLSON: The Ninth Circuit -- let me answer\nthe jurisdictional point first. The Ninth Circuit\nperceived that it had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C.\n3742(a)(1).\nQUESTION: That's violation of law.\nMR. OLSON: A -- that the sentence was imposed\nor the --\nQUESTION: Yes, in violation of law. So, I\nwould ask them. I'd say, what law?\nMR. OLSON: And -- and that the Ninth Circuit\nperceived that the district court felt that it was barred\nby law from departing --\nQUESTION: There isn't much I can find in this\nrecord that says that.\nMR. OLSON: And -- and that the Ninth Circuit\nfelt that because this was a constitutional right that the\ndefendant was -- had that was being withheld from the\ndefendant because of the -- of the circumstances of this\ncase, that the -- the district court erroneously presumed\nthat it was prevented from going in a -- in a direction\nthat the Ninth Circuit felt that it could go.\nAnd I think that then ties in with your second\n-- your second question with respect to the sentencing\nguidelines and section 5K2. The -- the court felt -- the\nNinth Circuit felt -- and it's not very clear, but -- and\n-- and the Government is not objecting to the -- the way\nthe Ninth Circuit exercised jurisdiction at this point and\nis not opposing the court's decision with respect to\njurisdiction at this point.\nThe Ninth Circuit felt that under section 5K2 of\nthe sentencing guidelines, this would be a -- mitigate --\nthe -- the entry into the so-called fast track program was\na mitigating circumstance of a kind or a degree not\nadequately taken into account by the guidelines in\nformulating the guidelines. It should result in a\nsentence different --\nQUESTION: Those are supposed to be individual\nthings. I mean, in other words --\nMR. OLSON: Well, but -- yes.\nQUESTION: -- I -- I see -- normally you could\nsay, okay, the Government doesn't oppose it. We'll get to\nthe main issue. But these look like tremendous\njurisdictional blocks to me.\nMR. OLSON: It -- it -- I think the answer to\nthat latter point with respect to the individual\nconsideration is covered by the fact that this particular\nprogram, under the circumstances of this district, are --\nthey may be -- it may be frequently occurring, but it's\nindividualistic in the sense that entering into this\nprogram alleviates a substantial amount of work and -- and\nprovides a substantial benefit to the prosecutor in that\ndistrict without which the prosecutor may not be able to\nenforce the law on all of the responsibilities of the law.\nThis is one of the most busy districts of the\nUnited States because of the tremendous number of\nnarcotics crimes coming in across the border, multiplied\nin a sense by the number of immigration violations that\ntake place. So that this was an individualized\ncircumstance in that district.\nNow, one could quibble about the appropriateness\nof that, but that's how the Ninth Circuit perceived it.\nIt perceived that it had jurisdiction on that basis, and\nwe're not objecting to it.\nIt seems clear that not only, therefore, that\nnot -- that this right is not required by or implicit\nwithin Brady, but that the language of the Court's\ndecisions interpreting Brady make it clear that Brady is\nnot supposed to go that far, that it only has to do with\nthe rights at -- at trial.\nFurthermore, the solution that the Ninth Circuit\nproposed with respect to this is both overly broad and\nunderly inclusive. If the Court was concerned, as it said\nit was and as the respondent contends it should be, with\nthe potential of innocent persons pleading guilty, the\ntest itself, which is set out in the court's -- the -- the\nNinth Circuit's opinion on page -- I think it's 15a of the\nappendix to the petition for certiorari. About midway\nthrough the page, the court says, the evidence is material\nunder the test announced in this case if there is a\nreasonable probability that but for the failure to\ndisclose the Brady material, the defendant would have\nrefused to plead and would have gone to trial.\nIn other words, the test is not couched in terms\nof the potential innocence of the defendant or the risk\nthat a defendant was -- was innocent. It's couched in\nterms of the tactical decision a defendant might make with\nrespect to whether or not to go trial.\nQUESTION: He should know what the house odds\nare before he -- before he rolls the dice by pleading\nguilty.\nMR. OLSON: Precisely. In fact --\nQUESTION: Which is sort of a different concept\nfrom -- from what Brady was about.\nMR. OLSON: Exactly, Justice Scalia. In fact,\nthis Court has frequently said that -- that there are lots\nof risks involved in the -- in the defense of a case, a\ncriminal case, and -- and there are risks and benefits and\nburdens and evaluations that must be taken into\nconsideration.\nQUESTION: What is the Government's obligation\nwith respect to advising the defendant or the court that\nthe elements of an offense have -- have been committed? I\n-- in all these hypotheticals, the cocaine supposedly --\nthere was supposed to be cocaine. It's really talcum\npowder or something, and the Government knows that. What\n-- is this all taken care by rule 11 or --\nMR. OLSON: Well, I think it's taken care of in\nseveral ways. If the -- the Constitution gives the\ndefendant a right to trial or a right to confront\nwitnesses, a right to counsel, reasonably competent,\ninformed counsel. Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of\nCriminal Procedure require a relatively exhaustive\nprocedure where the court makes sure that the guilty plea\nis voluntary and intelligent and that the elements of the\ncrime, of course, are involved in whether or not --\nQUESTION: Well, does the Government have to\nhave a good faith belief that an offense has been\ncommitted? Is there -- is there some standard that binds\nthe prosecution?\nMR. OLSON: The standard -- the standards for\nprosecutors in the United States -- for the United States\nare set forth in the -- the U.S. Attorneys Manual. It\nrequires prosecutors not to bring a case unless they\nbelieve in good faith that there is a reasonable basis for\nthe case that's being brought, in fact a reasonable basis\nfor believing that there could be a conviction based upon\nevidence beyond a reasonable doubt. That's not a\nconstitutional standard, Justice Kennedy.\nThe constitutional standard is set forth in the\n-- this Court's decisions with respect to the right to\ncounsel, the right to trial, the right to intelligent\ninformation with respect to that.\nRule 11, which is a -- which is a joint product\nof the courts and the -- and the legislature, sets out\nelaborate procedures pursuant to which a Federal judge\nwill inquire with respect to the basis for the plea,\nexplain the rights that the defendant has violated, and\nspecifically requires the Federal court to find that\nthere's a factual basis for the plea.\nNow, so that what I was saying was that is the\nremedy, the so-called remedy, that the Ninth Circuit has\ncome up -- is -- is under-inclusive to the extent that if\nit's concerned about -- it's over-inclusive to the extent\nthat it's concerned about innocent people pleading guilty\nbecause it doesn't go to the -- the factual innocent. It\ngoes to the tactical decisions, the rolling of the dice,\nwith respect to what are the chances of winning or losing\nin court.\nQUESTION: Is this true, Mr. Solicitor General,\nthat the rolling of the dice concept can apply to an\ninnocent defendant as well? Supposing the -- the\ndefendant and his lawyer know there are three eyewitnesses\nwho were going to identify him. They also know he wasn't\nthere, but there was somebody there who looks a lot like\nhim. And so they've got a choice of either taking the\nchance of getting acquitted, in the face of that evidence\nand based on their own denial -- he doesn't have an alibi\n-- and if he gets convicted, he has a very long sentence.\nAnd he gets an offer of a plea bargain, a very short\nsentence. I don't suppose there's anything unethical\nabout the lawyer trying to figure out what the odds are.\nMR. OLSON: Well, no, there's nothing unethical\nabout the lawyer trying to figure out what the odds are.\nIn fact, rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal\nProcedure give fairly elaborate rights of discovery to the\ndefendant's counsel. And at that plea agreement, the\njudge will inquire with respect to whether there's a\nfactual basis for the plea agreement.\nIn fact, the judge in this case specifically\naddressed that question to the defendant, asked the\ndefendant is it, indeed, true -- asked the defendant and\nthen the counsel interceded and said, yes, she was\nbringing in her car 60 -- 60 pounds of marijuana. And\nthen the judge turned to the defendant and said, is that\ntrue? And the defendant said, yes, I knew that it was --\nQUESTION: What is the lawyer -- what kind of\nadvice is the lawyer to give? Hypothetically we have an\ninnocent client who has a very severe risk of being\nconvicted, and the lawyer would tell him there's going to\nbe a plea colloquy here, and if you don't acknowledge\nthis, the plea bargain will go down the drain. Now, I\nguess he shouldn't tell him what -- I don't know exactly\nwhat the lawyer is supposed to do there.\nMR. OLSON: Well, I don't -- I'm not sure\neither. It would all depend upon the circumstance. There\nis -- there is a possibility that this Court's recognized\nin the Alford decision a possibility of making a plea\nwhich is -- which is not incompatible with a defendant's\nassertion of innocence. But I think that in most cases\nthe defendant is the one who will know more than anyone,\nthe prosecutor or anyone else, whether the defendant is\nguilty.\nQUESTION: Right, but I'm assuming a case in\nwhich the defendant knows he's not guilty, and\nnevertheless, there's a risk that, because the odds are so\nheavy if you get convicted, you go away for 20 years. If\nyou have a 16-month plea bargain, you may want to not take\nthe chance.\nMR. OLSON: Well, I understand that, Justice\nStevens. That may happen in a particular case. This\nCourt said in Bagley that Brady's primary purpose is not\nto -- Brady's purpose is not to displace the adversary\nsystem as the primary means by which truth is -- as the\nprimary means by which truth is uncovered. And I think\nthat the answer to your question is that this system, no\nsystem is perfect or ever will be perfect, but we do have\na panoply of constitutional rights. We insist that the\ndefendant be adequately counseled. We insist that the\njudge through rule -- through rule 16 --\nQUESTION: So that in effect you're saying there\nmay be a hypothetical situation out there, but we've got\nmillions of cases. Also, we've got to balance the two,\none against the other.\nMR. OLSON: Absolutely. And I must -- I must\nsay that with respect to -- we're not talking about that\ncase here. We're talking about a blanket rule which would\napply in 57 -- you know, 57,000-some guilty pleas in the\nFederal system every year.\nQUESTION: Well, the McMann and Brady cases too\nsaid that a defendant may have to make some hard choices.\nMR. OLSON: The Court said that explicitly.\nQUESTION: Well, if we're talking about\nbalancing and basic fairness, I guess their argument would\nbe with 57,000 cases going -- that's 85 percent or 90\npercent of all people plead guilty. Most of those are\ndrug crimes. When the prosecutor sits there with a drug\ncrime, he says, you plead guilty to a telephone count,\nit's 8 months, or I bring you to a mandatory minimum\ncharge in trial and it's a minimum of 5 years. And under\nthose circumstances, the person is quite tempted to plead\nguilty irrespective of the facts. And therefore, it\nbalances. As you were saying, it balances the system and\nit makes it somewhat more fair in that mine run situation\nto understand what are the chances of being convicted if I\ndo go to trial.\nMR. OLSON: Well --\nQUESTION: That would be the argument, I think,\nthe other way in terms of fundamental fairness.\nMR. OLSON: And I would answer that in two ways.\nIn the first place, I think the Chief Justice answered it\nby referring to the Brady v. United States case.\nQUESTION: So, you'd have to say that you're\nright, that that isn't what Brady said. But in taking --\ntaking into account the reality of the criminal justice\nsystem, where 85 percent of the people plead guilty, and\nthe prosecutor is armed with this tremendous don't plead\nguilty or else sentencing system, that this creates a kind\nof basic balance that -- in terms of fairness -- I'm\ntrying to get the argument out.\nMR. OLSON: I understand, Justice Breyer, I\nunderstand what you're saying. And there's a certain --\nthere's a certain logic to it. But if that is -- if that\nwas the case, then the Ninth Circuit's rule is under-\ninclusive because if the defendant really wants to know\nwhat the best chances are, rather than the exculpatory\nmaterial or the impeachment material, what he is going to\nwant to know is the inculpatory material. And you made\nthe point about the other -- other prosecutions that are\nbeing held over the defendant's head. He's going to want\nto know what -- well, what evidence do they have on the\ngreater offense that they're about to charge me with,\nbecause I'm going to take my chances now and plead to this\nlesser included offense.\nSo, if the Ninth Circuit wanted to accomplish\nwhat you're talking about as the thrust of your question,\nit would have gone -- and I suspect that it will --\nQUESTION: Well, you -- you wouldn't want it to\ngo further, would -- would you, General Olson? You -- you\nwould not want us to adopt a rule that encourages -- that\nenables innocent people to more intelligently plead guilty\nwhen they're innocent?\nMR. OLSON: No. I'm not --\nQUESTION: I mean, it seems to me we should do\neverything to discourage people who are innocent from\npleading guilty.\nMR. OLSON: I -- I --\nQUESTION: What kind of a legal system is this\nwhere we're going to design our rules to encourage guilty\npeople to plead -- or innocent people to plead guilty?\nIt's crazy.\nMR. OLSON: This Court -- this Court has said\nthat it's perfectly appropriate in the adversarial system\nfor the prosecutor to find legitimate ways to encourage\nguilty defendants to plead guilty.\nNow, we -- you're absolutely right. It's --\nQUESTION: We're worrying here about innocent\npeople, and we're trying to encourage them to plead guilty\nso that -- if they know everything about what the\nGovernment has. I mean, there's something wrong with a\nlegal system that -- that --\nMR. OLSON: But there's --\nQUESTION: -- is even contemplating such --\nMR. OLSON: -- Justice Scalia --\nQUESTION: -- such action, it seems to me.\nMR. OLSON: -- nothing in this case that\ninvolves that issue at all. We have a guilty defendant\nwho has acknowledged under oath -- I think it was under\noath. Usually it is, in the Federal court systems -- that\nthis person was guilty. So, you are faced with the\npossibility of drafting a rule -- or the Ninth Circuit\ndrafted a rule for a hypothetical situation not involving\nthe case before it, which was over-inclusive because it\nincludes the vast number of people that are indeed guilty,\nand under-inclusive because it doesn't provide a remedy --\nthe best remedy which we would definitely not encourage,\nbut I would suggest would be the next step, possibly from\nthe same circuit, with respect to giving additional\ninformation.\nAnd it would be inconsistent not only with that,\nbut it would be inconsistent with what this Court has said\nover and over again with respect to the value of competent\ncounsel, the fact that certain chances have to be taken,\nthat a defendant is not entitled to set aside a plea\nbecause he may have misconstrued the weight or balance of\nthe prosecution's case, or there may have been mistakes of\nlaw. In one -- in -- in Brady v. the United States, in\nfact, it was a misconstruction of whether or not the\ndefendant would -- could be -- could be put to death if\nthe defendant went to trial. So, this Court has\nrecognized that there are those balances in the system.\nBut what the -- what we urge upon the Court is\nthat there are so many protections, including the\ndiscovery right, the fairly exhaustive --\nQUESTION: The discovery right would cover --\nyou did say there were some things that a defendant\nperhaps would not know, and one of them you mentioned in\nyour -- in your brief is if you rob a bank and you don't\nknow whether it's FDIC insured. That kind of information.\nHow would that -- how would that come out pretrial?\nMR. OLSON: That would -- that would come out\nthrough rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal\nProcedure, which is set out in the appendix, I think 3a to\n5a, of our brief on the merits. The defendant is given\npretrial considerable discovery rights to find out those\nsorts of things, and if the defendant is not sure and,\nafter consultation with his counsel, wishes to go to\ntrial, there's -- the Brady rights do kick in at an\nappropriate time to allow the defendant to prepare for\ntrial.\nWhat I'm saying is that -- that the combination\nof the constitutional rights to trial and -- and\nconfrontation, the constitutional rights to counsel, the\n-- the statutory rights to discovery, the statutory\nobligations on a judge to make sure there's a factual\nbasis for the guilty plea, the obligations -- and we have\nto assume under -- as this Court suggested in the\nMezzanatto case, a -- a good faith behavior by our public\nofficials that a prosecutor is not going to withhold\nevidence in -- on -- where it knows that the -- this is an\ninnocent defendant. Those are ample assurances,\nespecially in the context, as this Court has said over and\nover again, that the best person to know whether there's a\nfactual basis for a plea of guilty is the defendant\nhimself or herself.\nI will say one more thing that is -- that seems\nto me important with respect to the -- this -- the posture\nin which this case comes. If this Court were to determine\nthat there is a constitutional right -- and we think that\nneither this Court's decisions nor the Constitution would\nlead the Court to that conclusion -- the constitutional\nright could be waived. The Ninth Circuit said that a\ndefendant cannot, even if the defendant wanted to, plead\nguilty. Knowing that the defendant was guilty, the\ndefendant could not waive the right.\nNow, that has several implications. It -- it\ncreates problems for the criminal justice system. The\nBrady -- the Brady right that the Ninth Circuit would\nengraft on the system here would force prosecutors to\ndevelop cases and use resources at the defendant's\ninitiative, on the defendant's time table. It creates --\nturns Brady -- the right, from a fair trial right into a\nfair trial preparation right.\nWith respect to certain types of cases, it would\ncompromise conspiracy cases, racketeering cases, organized\ncrime drug cases, white collar cases where there may be\nsubstantial warehouses full of documents. In other words,\nmany prosecutors won't be preparing their case for\ndetermining what witnesses they're going to use until\nthey're ready to go to trial. Once they -- if they had to\ndisclose this information on the defendant's time table,\nwhich the defendant -- if this rule were adopted by this\nCourt, the first thing a defendant would do is offer --\nsay, \"I'm thinking about pleading guilty. Give me\neverything in your files.\"\nNow, a prosecutor in complicated cases is not going\nto want to do that and -- and will refuse to engage in\nthat process or will -- once -- once it does so, there's\nno more incentive for the -- for the prosecutor to enter\ninto the plea bargaining process. So, it could be\ndamaging to the benefits of the defendants over and over\nagain that's received the benefits of the plea bargaining\nsystem, which this Court has sanctioned and encouraged.\nQUESTION: I don't want to cut into your -- your\nreserve time. Just one question. If you prevail in this\ncase, what happens? Does she get a longer supervised time\nof relief? Or is there anything that's still live in this\ncase as to this defendant?\nMR. OLSON: The --she -- she --\nQUESTION: Or has she served the full time\nanyway?\nMR. OLSON: -- she -- I don't -- I don't know\nwhether she's served the entire -- the sentence that was\ngiven to her was 18 months in incarceration and a 3-month\n-- a 3-year --\nQUESTION: 3 years.\nMR. OLSON: -- probationary period. I think\nthat that would continue to go on. That was at the very\nlow range, low end of the guideline sentence.\nQUESTION: So there is still some -- something\nat stake here?\nMR. OLSON: Yes, I believe so, Justice Kennedy,\nbut I'm not sure, 100 percent sure, factually I know the\nanswer to that.\nIf I may reserve the balance of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, General Olson.\nMr. Hubachek, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN F. HUBACHEK\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. HUBACHEK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Due Process Clause requires the disclosure\nof materials --\nQUESTION: Before you get going, is the case\nmoot? Is there something left on the 3-year probation\nperiod?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Yes, there is, Justice O'Connor.\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Now, the -- the disclosure of\nmaterial exculpatory information is essential to ensure\nthe accuracy of criminal convictions. And Ake indicates\nthere's a societal and individual interest in the accuracy\nof such convictions that's paramount.\nThe system that we have now, as has been\ndiscussed already this morning funnels cases into plea\nnegotiations, and the -- the Court has said that's not a\nbad thing, but it -- still, it funnels everybody, the\nguilty and the innocent, into the same sort of result.\nInnocent people are provided the same substantial and\nlegitimate incentives to plead guilty as guilty people\nare.\nAnd if I could return to Justice --\nQUESTION: No. I -- I object to that. I -- I\ndon't think our system ever encourages or, indeed, even\npermits an innocent person to plead guilty. Our rules\nrequire the judge to -- to interrogate the person pleading\nguilty to make sure that, indeed, the person is guilty.\nThere is nothing in our system that encourages or even\nallows an innocent person to -- to plead guilty. And I\nwould be horrified if -- if there were something like\nthat.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, Justice Scalia, the -- the\nsystem does not -- first of all, I guess the first\nprotection would be a rule 11 type factual basis. That's\nnot required in every case. In fact, the Fifth Circuit\ncases that the Solicitor General relies upon, both of\nthose were nolo or Alford type pleas. So, there was no\nfactual basis provided at all in those cases. Individuals\nwho don't know whether they're innocent or guilty -- they\ndon't have to provide a factual basis that's -- that's\nincorrect or false.\nQUESTION: How many individuals don't know\nwhether they're innocent or guilty?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Your Honor, there are some.\nI've --\nQUESTION: I'm sure there may be rare cases, but\nit -- it is rare. Is it not?\nMR. HUBACHEK: I'm sure that it's not\ntremendously common, but the important thing is -- is that\nindividuals who are innocent do receive the same\nincentives to plead guilty. And I've cited some cases\nfrom various State courts at pages 10 to 11 of the brief\nwhere individuals pled guilty where substantial material\nexculpatory evidence existed, several cases like Justice\nStevens' hypothetical involving identification testimony\nwhere an individual was charged with an offense and was\ntold that there had been an identification made by what\nappeared to be an otherwise unimpeachable witness --\nQUESTION: So -- so that's what your case comes\ndown to? You want us to facilitate the pleading of guilty\nby innocent people. You -- you want us to set up a system\nthat will make -- will make that a more intelligent\ndecision so that we can put in jail a lot of people who\nplead guilty even though they're innocent because it's a\ngood deal for them.\nMR. HUBACHEK: No, Your Honor, not -- not at\nall. I --\nQUESTION: I thought that's what you're saying.\nI don't know what other -- for the guilty person, you're\nnot worried about it. You're -- you're asserting the\nrights of the innocent.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Right. It's the innocent person\nwho needs to receive this --\nQUESTION: Who needs to be able to plead guilty\nso he'll -- he'll serve a sentence that he doesn't\ndeserve.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, Your Honor, the fact that\nthat happens exists already. The rule that I'm asking for\nis to provide material exculpatory information to\nindividuals who are not guilty which will, when they are\nable to --\nQUESTION: But your client is guilty, and I\ndon't understand why what we're talking about is some\nhypothetical. You have to establish your client's right\nand the argument is, if the case is going to go to trial,\nyou're entitled, before the trial starts, to get this\nstuff, but you're not entitled to get it in the beginning\nof the case. And you are representing a guilty client and\nasserting that right on behalf of your guilty client.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, Justice Ginsburg, the --\nthe posture of the case, as has been discussed, is that\nthere -- this is a sentencing issue where there's a\nrequest for a departure based upon the -- this fast track\nprogram. Ms. Ruiz didn't participate in the fast track\nprogram because she objected to the term of the plea\nagreement which required her to surrender her rights under\nthe -- the Brady decision.\nQUESTION: But she -- she pled guilty\nnonetheless.\nQUESTION: She said she's guilty.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Yes, she did.\nQUESTION: And she didn't enter an Alford plea.\nMR. HUBACHEK: No, Justice Souter, she did not.\nBut the -- the way that the case was presented to the\nNinth Circuit was that she had a constitutional right to\nthis information, if it existed. I mean, there are\nsituations where the -- the marijuana, for instance, in\nthis case is concealed. It's unlikely that an individual\nwho's merely a courier would ever have actual access to\nit. There is a recent spate of cases in Dallas where the\ndrugs that were seized turned out not to be drugs.\nQUESTION: That's all true, but this is --\nyou're asking for a really major change in the system. I\nmean, what the Government says -- and maybe it would be a\nbetter system, but the Government says, once we go down\nthis path, here's what's going to happen. And they sound\nright to me.\nThe prosecutors, who are very busy -- very busy\n-- and have a little time with the witnesses and they go\nin and start talking about a plea, will now not be able to\ndo that. They'll have to look into their witnesses, get\nall the evidence together, get the impeachment stuff, give\nit to the defendant, and 80 percent of them or maybe only\n30 percent will say, the hell with this. We'll go to\ntrial. I'm not going to do it. We'll go to trial.\nAnd under the present system, particularly in\ndrug offenses, what that means for many, many, many\npeople, guilty and innocent -- let's say guilty -- they're\ngoing to go away for very long times. And therefore,\nwe're transforming this system into something like a\nEuropean system where you can't take guilty pleas, and\nit'd be somewhere in the middle. That's a major change.\nAnd, anyway, the Constitution doesn't requirement --\nrequire it and it would work out the worse, they say, for\na lot of defendants.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, first of all, Justice\nBreyer, the -- this system has been in place in the\nSouthern District of California, which has this enormous\ncaseload and all these drug cases, for the past year. The\nterm --\nQUESTION: Have they been giving all the\nevidence, the impeachment evidence and so forth?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Right. The term that -- that Ms.\nRuiz objected to has been removed from the plea agreement.\nIt's been going on for a year. The pleas are proceeding\napace.\nQUESTION: The same way?\nMR. HUBACHEK: The same way, Your Honor. The --\nQUESTION: But let's -- let's go back perhaps to\nJustice Ginsburg's question, that you say you're here on\nbehalf of innocent people who want to plead guilty. But\nyour own client admitted that she was -- had 50 or 60\npounds of marijuana. Surely, you've got to argue for a\nrule that favors something like that who is not an\ninnocent person.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, the rule that I'm proposing\nwould, indeed, benefit both non-innocent and innocent\nindividuals. But that's the case with every\nconstitutional protection.\nQUESTION: Well, wouldn't it be better to just\nsay we don't accept guilty pleas from innocent people?\nThat's our policy.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, the -- I don't think that\nany judge or any prosecutor wants to accept guilty pleas\nfrom innocent people.\nQUESTION: And indeed may not do so. That's the\nrule. You -- you won't accept a guilty plea from someone\nwho's innocent.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, the protections that are in\nplace don't fully account for innocence. For -- for\nexample, even in a rule 11 decision -- in a rule 11 plea,\nif you ask someone, did you sell the drugs or did you, you\nknow, shoot the person, that doesn't say anything about\nwhether or not there's entrapment. It doesn't say\nanything at all about whether or not there's self-defense.\nIf a defendant pleads guilty in ignorance of that kind of\ninformation, then in fact an innocent person could plead\nguilty. In Alford pleas or nolo pleas, there's no factual\nbasis provided at all. And again --\nQUESTION: Wait a minute. I don't understand.\nThe person doesn't understand that there's a -- this\nperson doesn't have a lawyer who tells him, you know, if\nyou shot the person in self-defense, of course, you're not\nguilty. Is -- is that the hypothetical you're positing,\nsomebody who has such poor legal advice and he doesn't\nknow there's a right of self-defense?\nMR. HUBACHEK: The -- the concern here, Justice\nScalia, is not evidence that the lawyer has access to and\nsimply misadvises the client. I understand that you have\nto take the risk in many situations. What I'm talking\nabout is evidence that would support such a defense, an\nentrapment defense, or a self-defense defense that's not\navailable to counsel but is in the possession of -- of the\nprosecution.\nQUESTION: Well, it would certainly be in\npossession of the defendant. I mean, it -- it's\nimpossible for him not to know whether he was acting in\nself-defense. The -- the only possible reason for -- for\ngiving him, this innocent person, this information is to\nenable him to make an intelligent judgment to plead guilty\neven though he's innocent. And I don't think we're -- I\ndon't think we're supposed to encourage that.\nI mean, we would have contradictory policies.\nOther provisions of our laws make it very clear that we\nare not to accept guilty pleas from innocent people, and\nyou want to adopt a system that will enable innocent\npeople more intelligently to plead guilty.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, perhaps -- what I'm saying\nis -- is that if information that supports the self-\ndefense theory that is not in the possession of the\ndefense but is in the possession of the prosecution, if\nthat evidence is turned over, that will make it more\nlikely that the innocent person will go to trial --\nQUESTION: Okay. Let's --\nQUESTION: Is there -- is there any precedent\noutside the Ninth Circuit that says Brady is an immediate\nturnover right and not a preparation for trial right?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Yes, there is. The Second\nCircuit has adopted this rule since 1988, and again, while\nthe Solicitor General has come forward and indicated there\nare numerous potential down sides to this type of\nconstitutional rule, the bottom line is -- is it --\nQUESTION: The Second Circuit has for impeaching\nmaterial as well?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Let me go back to a variant of\nJustice Scalia's question. It seems to me that your\nstrongest argument is the argument that does focus on the\n-- the supposedly innocent defendant. And -- and the\nargument that I think is strongest with respect to that\ncategory is the argument that those who enter Alford pleas\nobviously are not doing so because they want to plead\nguilty, despite their protest of innocence, they're doing\nit because they think they face such terrible odds that,\nin fact, it's better for them to collapse at the beginning\nand get it over with. And if these people are presented\nwith exculpatory, including impeachment evidence, they are\nless likely to do just what Justice Scalia says we, after\nall, as a system don't want them to do.\nMy question is, do you have any indication that\nthere is such a rash of unintelligent Alford pleas going\non that we should modify the entire system to respond to\nthis risk of Alford pleas that, in fact, would not be\nentered if the disclosure that you ask for were given?\nMR. HUBACHEK: I don't have an -- an empirical\nstudy that shows how many such guilty pleas are entered.\nI've cited on pages 10 to 11 of the respondent's brief a\nnumber of cases in which there are potentially innocent\npeople who have pled guilty, individuals who didn't know,\nfor instance, that a witness saw the tire blow out on the\ncar before the car crossed over the median, indicating\nthat that person -- that the tire blowout, not the\nperson's driving was responsible for the accident.\nAnother case, the Gibson case, where the\nprosecutor was actually told by the main identification\nwitness that she was changing her story, and that wasn't\nturned over to the defense.\nIn the Lee case, a situation where the\nindividual was charged with an offense and told that there\nwas an identification, and it turns out that the -- the\nwitness misidentified him and that then the -- the witness\nwas later shown, before a preliminary hearing, a picture\nof the defendant. So, there are cases out there in which\nthis risk exists.\nAnd if I could, I think that the -- one of the\nproblems I guess in getting across the point is that I\nthink the Solicitor General has misstated the import of\nthe Ninth Circuit's test. The Ninth Circuit's test is not\nsolely a -- you know, we want to give you all the cards so\nyou can make a better strategic choice. The -- the test\nis derived from the Court's decision in Hill v. Lockhart,\nand Hill v. Lockhart's test says would the defendant have\ngone to trial if, in fact, he had received the proper\nadvice. But then it says that --\nQUESTION: Well, but even -- even if you're\ngoing to imply -- if -- if that's going to be your\nstandard, it seems to me that the Solicitor General has\ngot a point when he says if the Ninth Circuit test is\ngoing to be applied and applied with your gloss, it can't\nstop where it is now. It's going to have to go the\nfurther step and, in effect, require disclosure of all the\ninculpatory evidence. What's your response to that?\nMR. HUBACHEK: My response to that is -- is that\nwe're asking for a right based on Brady, and Brady doesn't\nprovide for --\nQUESTION: Oh, but Brady -- I mean, Brady\nultimately comes down to a judgment about materiality, and\n-- and materiality in the sense of -- of the kind of\nevidence that disturbs confidence in the verdict is a\njudgment that can only be made in the context of the\nentire evidence of the case. Brady judgments ultimately\nare made after the fact. And I don't see why that -- that\nvery fact if we're -- if Brady is going, ultimately, to be\nour standard here, doesn't imply just what the Solicitor\nGeneral argued.\nBefore we can tell that there has been a\nviolation of the rule that you propose, a court would have\nto know -- and indeed, before that, a defendant presumably\nwould have to know -- the -- the entire evidentiary world\nof that case. And that means you've got to know a lot\nmore than impeachment evidence or even exculpatory\nevidence. You've got to know what the inculpatory\nevidence is. So, it seems to me that what you're arguing\nfor, even with your gloss and even starting with Brady, is\nessentially a global disclosure rule.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, I'd respectfully disagree.\nI think that the Hill v. Lockhart test, when specifically\nthe Hill case was discussing when defense counsel fails to\n-- to find material exculpatory evidence, that the Ninth\nCircuit test would apply at that point, but that that test\nwill ultimately devolve into what effect this evidence\nwould have at trial. So --\nQUESTION: Hill -- Hill was an ineffective\nassistance of counsel case, wasn't it?\nMR. HUBACHEK: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: So, we're not talking about any\nobligation of the prosecutor in Hill.\nMR. HUBACHEK: No. I understand. But -- but\nHill talked about ineffective assistance of counsel in the\ncontext of the failure to locate material exculpatory\nevidence, essentially the same facts that -- that could\nconceivably result in the withdrawal of the guilty plea.\nQUESTION: Yes, but the relationship between a\ndefendant's attorney and the prosecutor on the other side\nare by no means the same.\nMR. HUBACHEK: I agree. And Brady certainly\ndoesn't suggest that they're the same. Brady in trial\nrequires that the prosecutor turn over the evidence but\nnot to tell the defense lawyer how to use it. Well, we're\npositing that the same sort of obligation should exist at\nthe pretrial stage. The prosecutor has to turn over the\ninformation but not go any further and provide advice as\nto how it should be used.\nQUESTION: It's so odd that it comes to us in a\ncase where there's no suggestion that we're dealing here\nwith an innocent defendant. We're -- we're told nothing\nabout what's out there that would affect this case, are\nwe?\nMR. HUBACHEK: I -- I understand that this is a\ncase where there's a guilty plea and we're not making an\nargument that she -- that Ms. Ruiz should be permitted to\nwithdraw her guilty plea. However, if the Court adopts a\nrule that the Ninth Circuit and the Second Circuit's\napproach is incorrect, then defendants will not receive\nexculpatory evidence before they plead guilty and\nsituations such as arose in the various --\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I assume there is, as the\nSolicitor General suggests, some pretrial discovery right\nthat a defense counsel has.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, there's some pretrial\ndiscovery right, but it's not extensive and oftentimes it\ndoesn't cover the types of information that has led to\npotential miscarriages of justice, as I set out in the\nbrief.\nQUESTION: And in fact, the -- the relevant\ndiscovery rule actually prohibits, as I read it, discovery\nof some material that you say this rule would cover.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Right. For instance, the --\nthe --\nQUESTION: Statements of witnesses, for example.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Exactly. Justice Stevens,\nyour --\nQUESTION: Which is -- which is a troubling\nconcept because one of the things we're sort of trying to\ndo here is balance the system-wide benefit of an -- a fast\ntrack program, on the one hand, with the occasional case\nwhere there's a risk of injustice that -- that concerns\nyou. And it's that very balance that, it would seem to\nme, must have motivated the draftsman of rule 16 and the\nenactment of the Jencks Act that have developed some\nrather elaborate rules as to just what rights you do have\nbefore you plead guilty, and you're, in effect, saying\nwell, we should go beyond those as a matter of judicial\ncraftsmanship.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, the rule that we're\nproposing would not supplant all of those rules. This is\na narrow range --\nQUESTION: It would add to them, and that's it.\nThere's -- there's a limited right of discovery under the\nFederal rules, and you are urging an expansion of that\nright essentially.\nMR. HUBACHEK: It -- it would expand it. That's\ncorrect. However, it would expand it in only a narrow\nfashion because the information that we would -- that the\ndefense would be entitled to would be limited by the\nnotion of materiality. Much of the debate in Agurs and\nBagley was whether or not a more broad rule should be\nadopted, but ultimately the -- the Court settled on the\nmateriality standard.\nQUESTION: What we're doing is -- is you're\nasking us to open up the plea bargaining process and\npiecemeal to bring in a constitutional rule that would\naffect one aspect of it. Now, it's -- it's hard for me to\naccept that, at least without knowing more about what are\nthe proposals around in the bar and elsewhere as to how\nthat process should be regularized. Are there rules\nsuggestions, rules change suggestions, statutory\nsuggestions? Where does this constitutional rule coming\nin, in a sense, out of -- from somewhere suddenly affect\nthis -- the whole process? Can I get a grasp of that by\nreading something?\nMR. HUBACHEK: I -- I can't direct you, Justice\nBreyer, to any particular rule change proposals that are\nout there.\nOur argument is based upon the notion that\neveryone agrees that the defendant is entitled to -- to\nmaterial exculpatory evidence at trial under the Fifth\nAmendment and also that the -- that the Sixth Amendment\nrequires defense counsel to find material exculpatory\nevidence to use at trial.\nNow, the -- the Sixth Amendment also requires\ncounsel to locate material exculpatory evidence before the\ndecision to make a plea is -- is made. And the reason\nthat is is so that it will be a plea that's worthy of\nconfidence. And that's -- ultimately the standard under\nBrady is -- is essentially the same as under Strickland.\nWe want a -- a proceeding that's reliable.\nUnder the current state of the law, if defense\ncounsel fails to find a piece of material exculpatory\nevidence, that guilty plea is then, therefore, going to be\nunreliable. But if the same piece of -- of material\nexculpatory evidence is unavailable to counsel, but in the\npossession of the prosecution, that conviction is\nconsidered to be reliable even if the defendant doesn't\nget the benefit of it.\nSo, what we're proposing is -- is that there is\na complementary action of -- of both the Fifth and Sixth\nAmendment rights pre plea and during the trial and that if\nthere is going to be an overlap in the Fifth and Sixth\nAmendment rights it's got to be at -- where the interest\nthat those rights protect is at its highest, and that is,\nprotecting the innocent from pleading guilty.\nQUESTION: Under the fast track program, does\nthe defendant have to waive rule 16 rights?\nMR. HUBACHEK: The -- under the fast track\nprogram, the defendant can't file any motions at all, but\nthe -- what happens is -- is that there is a pre-\nindictment offer that's made and the pre-indictment offer\nis usually accompanied by discovery in the form of -- in a\ncase like Ms. Ruiz's, the reports of the initial\ninspectors and then the special agent who comes in and\ndoes the interrogation and does the -- sort of a summary\nof the other individuals' information.\nQUESTION: So, those are available even under\nthe fast track program.\nMR. HUBACHEK: That's correct. That information\nis provided.\nQUESTION: Suppose you're right on your\nconstitutional argument. I'd just like you to spend 1\nminute addressing what I do not see how we get around the\nsimple fact that you have a client and your client is\nsaying that, as a matter of law, the judge had to depart.\nAnd not only am I unaware of any law that says the judge\nhas to depart, but in this case, I can't even find a\nprovision that would allow him to depart.\nAnd -- and I -- they've said, oh, well, he was\nunder a mistake of law. So, I've read the three sentences\nquoted for that proposition, and I certainly don't see any\nmistake of law there. He says, the court has read and\nconsidered the -- the documents, blah, blah, blah, and\nI've decided this is -- the court feels that this is not a\nproper case for departure. So?\nAnd in another part of the record, he says -- he\nsays, if you didn't sign an agreement, you have to live\nwith the consequence.\nMR. HUBACHEK: I -- I agree, Justice Breyer,\nthat there's no rule that you can say that a district\ncourt is compelled to depart in any case. The -- the\ndistrict court judge, when asked to depart because Ms.\nRuiz was being denied the fast track benefit because she\nrefused to agree to what she thought was an\nunconstitutional provision -- the district court's only\nresponse was -- is that was acceptance and offer. The --\nand the interpretation of that is -- is the district\nthought it didn't have discretion to depart unless the\nGovernment was agreeing --\nQUESTION: That's really not what he said. I\nmean, he just said you're not going to get advantage of\nthis because you didn't sign it.\nQUESTION: He said it's just not proper. I\nmean, I wish he'd give us language that -- that would\nindicate that he thought he couldn't depart, even if he\nwanted to. He just said it's not, in his view, a proper\ncase, but that's -- you know, that's fully consistent with\nhis discretion.\nMR. HUBACHEK: The -- the district court's\ncomment related to whether or not -- he said to counsel\nthat there was offer and acceptance and -- and that's it.\nAnd that --\nQUESTION: What's bothering me is this, that you\ncould say, okay, let's just hold everything in abeyance,\nget to the issue. If we do that, why wouldn't this case\nstand for the proposition that courts of appeals have\nabsolute authority to review every instance in which a\ntrial judge refuses to depart? In which case there will\nbe tens of thousands of such instances every year going\nright up to the court of appeals for review of the\nquestion whether he should have departed. Now, that's a\nmajor change in the law, I think. And how -- how could I\navoid that change and yet get to the issue?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, the Solicitor General\nhasn't been framing the questions related solely to the\ndiscovery issues, the Brady issue and the waiver issue.\nSo, I don't think that the Court would be ruling on the\npropriety of the -- of the Ninth Circuit's analysis --\nQUESTION: Your -- your answer is an easy one,\nMr. Hubachek. Our -- our opinions are very clear that in\ncases where we say nothing about jurisdiction, there is no\nholding on jurisdiction.\nMR. HUBACHEK: That's -- that's what I was --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: If we simply didn't -- if we -- if we\nsimply didn't discuss the jurisdictional point, our -- our\ndecision would stand for nothing. But it's not very\nresponsible to do that where it's very clear where there's\nthat there's no jurisdiction. That's -- that's the more\nserious obstacle.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, perhaps cert was -- was\nimprovidently granted. I mean, the -- Mr. Solicitor\nGeneral has come up and said that the -- the Government is\nnot challenging the -- the Ninth Circuit's ruling.\nQUESTION: Did you argue in the Ninth Circuit\nthat there was jurisdiction?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Yes.\nQUESTION: Then I take it you certainly don't\ntake a different position here.\nMR. HUBACHEK: No, certainly not, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nQUESTION: But our remedy would not be to\ndismiss the writ. Our remedy would be to vacate the\njudgment of the court of appeals if the court of appeals\ndid not have jurisdiction.\nQUESTION: You don't want that.\nMR. HUBACHEK: No, I don't.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HUBACHEK: With respect to the -- the --\nwith respect to the Fifth and Sixth Amendment claim that\nwe've made, the Second Circuit has also found a different\ntheory under which the -- the Court could find a Brady\nviolation, and they've indicated that the failure to turn\nover Brady information is essentially otherwise\nimpermissible conduct under the Brady v. United States\ncase. So, Mr. Chief Justice brought up Brady v. United\nStates, and I think that the Ninth Circuit's analogy to\nHill v. Lockhart and the Miller v. Angliker impermissible\nconduct approach has both addressed the concern that\nUnited States v. Brady would preclude.\nQUESTION: But -- but, you know, to say we'll\njust call it impermissible conduct because we want to get\nit done isn't very satisfactory. I mean, you have to say\nwhy it's impermissible.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Right. And our -- our point is\n-- is that it's impermissible because the Fifth and Sixth\nAmendments together protect the innocent from conviction.\nWhen the Fifth Amendment right to receive the information\n-- excuse me. When the Sixth Amendment right to have\ncounsel find this information attaches, then the Fifth\nAmendment right to have the Government turn it over should\nalso attach because the same source of unreliability would\nbe present if, in fact, the defendant were to make the\ndecision to plead guilty without receiving material\nexculpatory information.\nQUESTION: But in order to make that argument,\nas I understand it, you have to make an unreliability\nargument divorced from a materiality argument. Do you\nagree?\nMR. HUBACHEK: No. No, I don't because there is\na materiality requirement in Hill v. Lockhart.\nQUESTION: How do we judge that materiality at\n-- I mean, in Hill and Lockhart, when -- when you're\ndealing with counsel, you can at least say, well, if -- if\nthey had been aware -- regardless of how the case would\nhave turned out, there's a way in which it makes sense to\nsay that if they had been aware of this kind of evidence,\nthey would have said we're going to trial. We're going to\nroll the dice.\nWhen you're dealing with -- with essentially a\n-- a Brady rule, you're not dealing with a will they roll\nthe dice or will they not kind of question; you're dealing\nultimately with the question of what was its effect on the\n-- the soundness of the verdict, the soundness of a\nresult. And the only way you can make that judgment is to\nknow everything that would be in the case. In a sense\nthat's easy in a Brady situation because you're looking\nback. Here you can't look back.\nSo, it seems to me that you've either got to\ncome up with an entirely new materiality or prejudice\nstandard, and the -- and the effectiveness of counsel\ncases don't seem to me quite on point there. Or you've\ngot to dispense with a materiality standard entirely and\nsay anything that would have had any tendency to exculpate\nor to impeach in a way favorable to the defendant, if\ndenied, supports in effect a -- a claim for relief, which\nis a nonmateriality standard.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, Justice Souter, on page 16\nof our brief, we have a block quote from Hill v. Lockhart,\nand I really think that the test that was discussed in\nHill v. Lockhart covers the -- the concerns that Your\nHonor is mentioning today. And ultimately Hill v.\nLockhart concludes by saying that in -- in the case of\ncounsel failing to discover material exculpatory\ninformation, which is essentially the same type of problem\nthat we're talking about here, it says that ultimately the\nassessment will depend in large part on a prediction\nwhether the evidence likely would have changed the outcome\nof a trial.\nNow, I certainly agree that it will be a more\ndifficult assessment to make without there actually having\nbeen a trial, but we're asking that Your Honors adopt a\nrule in which you would be -- the courts would undertake\nexactly the same analysis that Hill v. Lockhart already\nrequires in the context of defense counsel failing to find\na piece of exculpatory information. And -- so, we're not\nat all asking that this analysis --\nQUESTION: But that is a different -- I mean, it\nnecessarily is a different standard from the Brady\nstandard of materiality which we have now. Is it not?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, the Brady standard for\nmateriality, as was explained in Kyles, derives from\nStrickland. Hill v. Lockhart also derives its materiality\nstandard from Strickland. So, I think it's --\nQUESTION: Well, let's go back to my question.\nThey -- they may have a common ancestry, but in fact they\nare not identical tests because they are applied in\ncircumstances that are by definition very different.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, I -- I think that it's an\neasier application post trial, but it's still the same\ntest that -- that's -- that we're being asked to apply in\nthe plea situation because Hill v. Lockhart says, look, if\ncounsel doesn't find the key piece of evidence and you\nplead guilty, then we're going to go back and look and\nsee, well, what would have happened at a trial if you had\nthat key piece of evidence. If there's a reasonable\nchance you would prevail at trial --\nQUESTION: And in -- and in order to do that\nintelligently, we've got to know what the trial would have\nincluded, won't we? And that either means, number one,\nthat the disclosure has got to go to, in effect, the\ninculpatory evidence, or it means at the minimum, number\ntwo, that the State has an opportunity to come in and say,\nwe'll tell you what the inculpatory evidence would have\nbeen. This is what we would have put in, and judged in\nthis context, it's not material.\nOne way or the other, either -- either the\nnecessary implication of your test or the -- the\nimplication that the State would have a right to respond\nto it, it seems implies that in order to apply your rule\nbefore trial, a -- a court, reviewing one of your claims,\nwould have to make a judgment about the -- the\nsignificance of the evidence in the context of -- of an\nentire trial, a whole evidentiary record that can be --\nthat can -- can be anticipated.\nMR. HUBACHEK: And that's the same approach that\nHill v. Lockhart requires. But a prosecutor in making the\ndetermination --\nQUESTION: Except in Hill it's easier because we\nknow that trial decisions are -- are often made without\nknowing what the result would be. They are decisions to\ngo ahead and have a shot at defending the case, and that's\na different -- that's a different standard from Brady\nmateriality.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Hill is a plea case.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Hubachek.\nGeneral Olson, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nWhat the respondent is proposing and what the\nNinth Circuit adopted is an unworkable and undesirable\nrule to solve a nonexistent problem. And it's illustrated\nby the facts of this case. The footnote or the -- the\npages in the respondent's brief cite some cases in which\ntheoretically it might be that some driver who crossed the\nline earlier might create a problem, but that is not this\ncase. And there's no empirical evidence or any other\nevidence in the record that would show that there's a\nsignificant problem here. The --\nQUESTION: Mr. Olson, would you address again\nthe jurisdictional problem here? I mean, if -- if in fact\nthe district court judge had discretion about what\nsentence to impose and could have -- and did exercise that\ndiscretion, do we have to be concerned about --\nMR. OLSON: I think that is not an easy\nsituation, but I think that the Ninth Circuit believed\nthat however inartfully the district court expressed it or\nincompletely the district court expressed it, that the --\nthat the district court was saying it didn't feel that it\nhad the capacity or the ability under the law to depart,\nthat it didn't have the discretion to do so. That's what\nthe Ninth Circuit decided. We argued otherwise to the\nNinth Circuit --\nQUESTION: I guess this is not a proper case\ncould mean that, I suppose. I wouldn't put it that way,\nbut it could --\nMR. OLSON: It could mean that. That's how the\nNinth Circuit -- Circuit perceived it.\nQUESTION: I'd even attempt not to say anything\nabout it, so long as I was not certain that there was no\njurisdiction.\nMR. OLSON: We -- we believe that we -- after\nlooking at it carefully, we've decided that the Ninth\nCircuit probably was right under the circumstances,\nalthough you could argue it the other way, and that this\n-- this is an issue that is presented clearly with respect\nto the -- the legal standard that's been adopted to the --\nby the Ninth Circuit and which is in play today.\nThe -- the respondent says, well, pleas are\nproceeding apace in California notwithstanding -- or in\nthe Ninth Circuit, notwithstanding the decision in this\ncase. There is no evidence in the record to suggest that\nthis hasn't created a problem, and in fact, I'm informed\nthat there are cases that have not been brought and cases\nthat have been dismissed because of a concern about\ncomplying with the rule in this case, because once that's\ndone, those cases are -- are potentially over with. But\nthe fact is there's no evidence either way.\nJustice Breyer, you raised some questions about\nwhether we would be constitutionalizing a rule which would\nchange Jencks and change the discovery rules. There --\nthere -- on page 26 of the Government's brief, we talked\nabout the fact that there have been efforts to change and\naccelerate the discovery requirements and that those have\nbeen soundly rejected for the very reasons we've been\ntalking about here. And the Jencks standard is what it is\nbecause there's very much concern over the safety of\nwitnesses when those statements are produced earlier in\nthe case. And that's -- Congress has made that decision\nquite consciously that those statements don't have to be\nproduced until the witness is actually called in trial for\nthat reason.\nLet me finish by saying that with respect to\nHill v. Lockhart, that's a case involving a requirement\nthat a defendant have, under the Sixth Amendment,\ncompetent counsel within the range of -- of competence\nexpected for counsel in criminal cases. That's a Sixth\nAmendment right to effective assistance of counsel. It is\nnot a -- a constitutional right to effective assistance of\nthe prosecution in deciding whether to plead guilty or\nnot.\nWhat we have in this case is a rule which is not\nrequired, which -- which would cause considerable\nproblems. It would undermine the plea bargaining system,\nwhich is important to the administration of criminal\njustice in this country, and affect the finality of guilty\npleas, which is an important consideration as well.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, General\nOlson.\n"
