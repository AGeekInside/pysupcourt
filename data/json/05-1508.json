        "content": "(10:05 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst today in case 05-1508, Zuni Public School\nDistrict, et al. vs. Department of Education.\nMr. Van Amberg.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD J. VAN AMBERG\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. VAN AMBERG: Mr. Chief Justice and may\nit please the Court:\nIn 1994, Congress enacted the equalization\nformula under the Impact Aid Act. It did so clearly and\ndecisively, and described a methodology which was\nunambiguous, was self contained, reflected a recognized\nstatistical standard, and assisted in actually\npromulgating -- and -- the intent of the Impact Aid Act,\nwhich is to benefit impacted local educational agencies\nor school districts and not fund the general educational\nprogram of the States.\nIn so doing, Congress removed from the\nSecretary the previously delegated authority to\nestablish by regulation the equalization formula. The\nSecretary in turn in 1996, in enacting his regulations\nin response to the 1994 legislation, disavowed that he\nwas engaging in any rulemaking or in fact in any\ninterpretations of statutes. Instead, the Secretary\nsought and announced that he was proceeding under an\nexception to the public notice and comment laws,\n5 U.S.C. 553(b), by stating that his regulations merely\nreflected changes in legislation, refining regulatory\nlanguage.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Van Amberg, they were\nessentially the same as the prior regulations, were they\nnot? And those regulations had gone through the notice\nand comment process.\nMR. VAN AMBERG: Yes. That is correct,\nJustice Ginsburg -- Ginsburg. Those were essentially,\nexcept for a few words here and there, those were the\nsame regulations. But they were in response to a\ncongressional directive back in 1974 that the Secretary\nis to create the equalization formula. In 1994,\nCongress came in with legislation and established that\nformula.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that the\nformula was proposed to Congress by the Department of\nEducation, which is not something that Congress did in\nother words, to stop the Secretary from whatever he was\ndoing. But it was indeed -- wasn't it the Secretary's\nown language that Congress enacted?\nMR. VAN AMBERG: The contention is made that\nthis 545-page omnibus education bill --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, just as to that,\nthe provision that we're talking about, do you say, you\nsay it wasn't drafted by the Department of Education?\nMR. VAN AMBERG: I don't think we know\nexactly who it was drafted by. I think there is --\nthere is some references in the Congressional --\nCongressional Record that this is an administration\nbill. But I would, I would like to respond, Justice\nGinsburg, based on the assumption that this was the\nSecretary's bill.\nUnder the statutory formula, the language is\nclear that what is disregarded in -- in ranking LEAs and\neliminating percentiles of LEAs is those LEAs which fall\nabove the 95th percentile --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Before you get into the\nsubstance let's -- let's finish with this, this problem,\nwhether it was indeed the other Secretary's own bill.\nWas the Secretary who proposed the -- the '94\nlegislation, the same Secretary who had promulgated the\nprior regulations?\nMR. VAN AMBERG: No. This --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The prior regulations were\npromulgated when?\nMR. VAN AMBERG: The former regulations were\npromulgated in 1976.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: My goodness, that's a long\ntime before.\nMR. VAN AMBERG: That's a long time.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: With a different Secretary\nnow.\nMR. VAN AMBERG: And a different agency.\nThere wasn't even --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So there's no reason to\nbelieve that the same Secretary -- that the Secretary\ncontinued to have the same view of what was proper, is\nthere?\nMR. VAN AMBERG: We view that it did not\nand, and also, Justice Scalia and Justice Ginsburg, we\nalso view that if this was the chief educational officer\nof the Federal Government, he was more than capable of\ndeveloping a statute which reflected his methodology\nof --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Indeed he could have copied\nthe regulations that were on the book and just put them\nin the statute, couldn't he?\nMR. VAN AMBERG: Well, even in the same act,\nYour Honor, under when they had the EFIG statute, there\nCongress was able to reference the regulations of the\nSecretary. They didn't do so when they were, when they\nenacted the impact aid part of it. So --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, as -- as far as the\ndifference in time, it was the Secretary's decision, the\nlater Secretary's decision to retain, as you\nacknowledged, the, almost the identical regulation. You\nsaid it didn't go through notice and comment the second\ntime, but the text was basically the same in '76 and in\n--\nMR. VAN AMBERG: He didn't -- if I could,\nYour Honor, he did not retain the second regulation.\nThis was supposed to be a new regulation which was\npromulgated by the Secretary because the Impact Aid Act\nhad been repealed --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes --\nMR. VAN AMBERG: -- and re-enacted.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and I appreciate that.\nBut the text of it, what the regulation said was not\nsignificantly different from what the earlier regulation\nsaid.\nMR. VAN AMBERG: No. But it --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was this the same\nSecretary, by the way, as the Secretary who issued the\nnew regulation, the same Secretary that was in office\nwhen the new legislation had been proposed?\nMR. VAN AMBERG: The new legislation was\n'94. Secretary enacted it in '96. I think it probably\nwas. I -- I -- it was the same administration.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why, why would the\nSecretary, if indeed it was his bill, why would he\ndeprive himself of the power to decide what the formula\nshould be? Which is the power he had before. I mean,\none must think that there must have been some pressures\nfrom elsewhere when the Secretary goes in and says take\nsome power away from me, please.\nMR. VAN AMBERG: Well, that, and I would\nagree, Justice Scalia, that that is not a, a usual event\nwhere an administration intentionally disgorges from\nitself its own authority. And, and I would also point\nout the fact that again, there is a dramatic difference\nbetween what, what the statute proposed and, and the\nmethodology described in the regulation. And what's,\nwhat's very significant is if you go back to 1976 when\nthe original regulation was promulgated, there was a\ndebate that went on in the public notice and comment\nportion of these proceedings where they discussed\nwhether you eliminate percentile of LEAs directly or\nwhether you add this extra step of eliminating\npercentage, percentages of pupils and then eliminating\nLEAs as these pupils are eliminated.\nI mean, it's a totally different process,\ntotally different philosophy behind them and as we can\nsee in this particular case, in New Mexico and in\nAlaska, totally different results.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, Mr. Van Amberg, is the\nstatutory language really as unambiguous as you suggest?\nIt says above the 95th percentile or below the 5th\npercentile, but it doesn't say above the 95th percentile\nof local education agencies or below the 5th percentile\nof local education agencies, does it?\nMR. VAN AMBERG: Well, Justice Alito, I, I\nthink what you, I think it is clear and unambiguous.\nAnd the reason is that if you, in order to run a\npercentile calculation you need units against which to\nrun that, and then you need these, an identified set of\nvariable standards such as they provided here, the\naverage per pupil expenditures of each set of these LEAs\nor districts.\nSo you rank the, the LEAs. You've got the\nvariable values and then it, it's, the statute provides\nthat you find that you eliminate those LEAs which are\nabove the 95th percentile. And then if you go back to\nwhat \"such\" means and referencing back to other portions\nof the statute, it's 95th percentile of the revenues and\nexpenditures of the LEAs in the State. It's a very\nsimilar process for --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but what do you\ndistribute?\nMR. VAN AMBERG: Pardon?\nJUSTICE BREYER: What do you distribute? I\nmean, I agree you have a, some kind of, let's put\nsomething on cards, so you have thousands of cards and\neach one has a number on it. What are you distributing\n-- the cards? Are you, are you -- what's distribute --\na 5th percentile refers to some kind of distribution.\nWhat's it a distribution of?\nMR. VAN AMBERG: It's the distribution of\nthe percent of the, what is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is it a thing?\nMR. VAN AMBERG: Like a thing.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Like a -- like a set of\nthings that you're distributing, what are they?\nMR. VAN AMBERG: The thing that you're\nrunning the percentile against is the total number of,\nof expenditures and revenues in the State.\nJUSTICE BREYER: In other words, you take\nall the -- there is a set of numbers, each number is a\ndifferent number and the characteristic of each number\nis there some school district that spends per, or takes\nin per pupil, revenue equal to that number. So we write\neach one on a card. Is that what we're, is that our\ndistribution? We have like, let's say we have a, a\nthousand cards. Is that what it is?\nMR. VAN AMBERG: Well, you know, in New\nMexico's case you have --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. No. I'm not, I'm\nsaying what do you think it has to be? What do you\nthink it should be? What are, what is it we are\ndistributing? A simple question, I guess, for a\nstatistician. I unfortunately am not one and can't find\none, so I have no idea what this statute means.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. VAN AMBERG: Well, the, the -- the value\nagainst which --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Not a value. I want to\nknow what I'm distributing. And if you don't know I\nwould say that this is, I have never seen a case so much\nbetter fitted for relying on the views of an agency.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, I thought you said\nthat you did know what it was. I thought you simply\nquoted the statute, the 5th percentile of such\nexpenditures or revenues in the State. That's what's\nbeing distributed.\nMR. VAN AMBERG: Yes, but --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm sorry, I don't know how\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Such revenues or\nexpenditures in the State consist of, the word \"such\"\nobviously refers you back to some prior reference to\nrevenues in the State, and that prior reference in\nsubsection A is a reference to district by district, not\npupil by pupil.\nMR. VAN AMBERG: That, that's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, so in other words we\nare distributing those cards, it's a set of numbers? If\nyou're certain, isn't it fair to say that this statute\nis not clear as to what it is you're distributing?\nMR. VAN AMBERG: Well, I'm sorry, Justice --\nI'm -- Breyer; I'm having a little trouble understanding\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I -- I thought not.\nIs there a --\nMR. VAN AMBERG: -- the question.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're not certain\nabout the hypothetical but you're certain about the\nstatute, aren't you?\nMR. VAN AMBERG: I'm certain about the\nstatute. You're provided the variable values that are\nattributed to each of the LEAs; you rank them; and you\nprovide a percentile. It's a methodology which was\ndescribed in 1976. It's a methodology employed every\nday in ranking students and schools.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah -- that -- right. But\nI unfortunately don't know enough about this subject, so\nI thought, not being an expert on it, that when you\nreferred to a percentile, you have some group of things,\na set of things that's being distributed in a certain\norder and there is a top of that and a bottom of that.\nMR. VAN AMBERG: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if that's what\npercentile refers to, I just want to know what those\nthings are that are being distributed. And - and that's\nwhere I find the ambiguity. And if there is an\nambiguity, I guess we are going to take the view of the\nagency at least as I understand it. So -- so that's why\nI asked the question.\nMR. VAN AMBERG: All right. And, and I\nthink I understand the question now, Justice Breyer.\nThank you.\nThe units that are ranked or distributed are\nthe LEAs or the school districts. And they are ranked\nin order of their per pupil expenditures and revenues.\nThose are the units and the component parts of this\ncalculation that are provided for us by Congress.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And does the statute say\nyou have to do it that way? It has to be the group\nthat's distributed?\nMR. VAN AMBERG: It's my understanding under\n-- under Brown and Williamson is if Congress speaks to\nan issue, Congress is to be obeyed.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Clearly.\nMR. VAN AMBERG: There is nothing mysterious\nabout this type of a methodology. And this is the one\nthat Congress chose.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, you could do it that\nway and the reason the Government, I think, says that\nyou shouldn't do it that way is that it would produce an\nabsurd result.\nMR. VAN AMBERG: All right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That the object of the\nstatute is to catch the outliers. And if you, for\nexample, had one giant school district like New York\nCity which was at the top of the list and another giant\nschool district that was at the bottom of the list you\nwould cut those two out, and you might have cut out half\nthe pupils in the whole State, and those wouldn't be\noutliers would they? I mean, that's the problem.\nMR. VAN AMBERG: And you have a similar\ninfirmity associated with the other methodology. That\nis, if you have a number of LEAs which are small in\nnumbers, as in New Mexico, particularly if you had a\nnumber of small LEAs at the bottom, which is I think a\nhuge problem policy wise, you were to cut them out and\nlet them to float off in their poverty. I think, I can\nunderstand where there is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Doesn't, doesn't\nsubsection b(ii) address outliers? I was surprised\nthere wasn't more discussion of that in the briefing and\nmaybe it's, it's because of some reason I'm unaware of.\nThat says that the Secretary in making this\ndetermination can take into account particular types of\nLEAs where there is extra, additional costs. I would\nhave thought for example if you had a very small LEA\nwith only 20 students and the cost is particularly high\nbecause you don't have economies of scale, that you\nhaven't -- that would, could be knocked out for that\nreason. Is that not how that works?\nMR. VAN AMBERG: Yes. And this is the, the\nwhole problem, that we can argue philosophically how\nwhether Congress's methodology or the Secretary's\nmethodology is better, but the backdrop of this is that\nthe, the statute and also the regulation allows for\nschool, for the States to back out all these\ndisequalizing expenditures so that you, you make an\nadjustment to more or less end up with a baseline per\npupil expenditure. And there is really no reason after\nyou do that for having a wide disparity, even between\nthe top and the bottom LEA.\nThe Secretary's formula, and I don't think\nwe should be arguing whose formula is better, because if\nthey are different, Congress wins, but nevertheless, the\nSecretary's formula, it eliminates 26 percent of the\nschool districts. And under New Mexico, if you, if you\nlook at the top and the bottom school district even\nafter the eliminating of these funding differentials,\nyou've got a 244 percent disparity.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It, it eliminates 26 school\ndistricts but those 26 school districts account for 5\npercent or 10 percent of the pupils. And I guess what\nwe are interested in here is not school districts; they\nare not a thing -- they are a thing of a kind, but we\nare interested in students, real people who get money.\nAnd so that it, that it -- it eliminates 26 percent of\nthe school districts would see, to be a good thing, not\na bad thing, because what we are really interested in\nare the pupils and it keeps in 90 percent of the pupils.\nMR. VAN AMBERG: And Justice Breyer, I think\nCongress and in its methodology has disagreed with that\nview, because it does not rely strictly upon pupils, and\npupils are not necessarily the driving force in how we\nwork this formula.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought the problem was\ndisparity in school districts. Since much of the\nfunding for education is local funding, in some places\nthere are very rich school districts and very, very\npoor, poor school districts. And I thought that the\npurpose of this was to make sure that there is not an\nenormous disparity, not pupil to pupil but district to\ndistrict. It makes perfect sense, it seems to me.\nMR. VAN AMBERG: And that is correct.\nBecause these districts particularly in New Mexico serve\na unique purpose. New Mexico has pockets of, of urban\nand populations, and then they have got small\ntraditional villages; they have got farming communities;\nthey have got Indian lands; they have got military\nbases. And a school district whether it educates 100\nchildren or 1,000 children or 5,000 children has a\nspecial value in the State and in our educational\nprocess. And simply because a child in New Mexico\nattends the school district that does not have\nparticularly many students in it doesn't mean that he\nhas to suffer a poorer education than his brethren and\nbrothers and sisters in the metropolitan area.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Van Amberg, if there\nis any ambiguity in the statute, one relevant\nconsideration might be how would this work across\nStates, and I think it's true, is it not, that your\nreading would lead to wildly different, wildly different\nresults from State to State depending on whether they\nhave large districts or small districts at the top and\nthe bottom, whereas the other way, counting pupils\nrather than school districts regardless of size, you\nwould get uniformity going from State to State.\nMR. VAN AMBERG: Justice Ginsburg, the\nSecretary recognized in 1976 that both methodologies\nhave their problems, depending on how your districts,\nthe number of districts that you have in a State, their\nrelative populations, how they line up. And --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Am I correct in\nunderstanding that at the end of the line here, if you\nwin the Federal money will go to your two districts,\nwhereas if the other side wins the Federal money will go\nto the State? Is that what the bottom line is?\nMR. VAN AMBERG: That's the bottom line.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. VAN AMBERG: And I would point out,\nJustice Stevens, that Congress has made it clear that\nthe impact aid is supposed to go to the impacted\ndistricts. It is not supposed to fund the general\neducational program of a State. The money that the\nState, that the State of New Mexico seeks to retain is\nunder a limited exception that has been created and it\nis, it is not that we are trying to take the State's\nmoney as the bottom line. It is that the State has\ntaken the impact aid dollars and doesn't have an\nequalized system. New Mexico could equalize if it wants\nto. It established its equalization formula.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask another general\nquestion. If it were true, and I don't think it is in\nthis case, that the biggest district was the one that\ngot the most per pupil money -- the two biggest\ndistricts that were at the opposite ends of the\nspectrum, they would all be taken out, wouldn't they,\nunder your view?\nMR. VAN AMBERG: Well, it actually\ndepends -- you get into statistical approaches, but if,\nlet's say, there were less than 20 districts, you just\nhad let's say 18 districts or 19 districts, then if you\ndo the percentile against, if you work the percentile in\nthat particular setting, nobody gets eliminated.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you have the same\nproblem if it's students, I take it? You'd have the\nsame statistical question whether you, you use districts\nor students?\nMR. VAN AMBERG: Correct, because you would\nrun -- because if you had districts, big districts at\nboth ends, you run your 5 percent on both ends with the\nstudents, you end up not eliminating anybody.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's all right. I\nwouldn't think that was a problem. But what about\nJustice Stevens' question. There are 20 districts in\nour State -- it's exaggerated, let me exaggerate it --\nand the rich district has 20, has a quarter of the\nstudents, and the poor district has another quarter. So\nour outliers in that situation which we're eliminating\nfrom our calculation are the rich district and the poor\ndistrict. One's at the top, one's at the bottom. And\nnow we're left with 18 districts to figure out whether\nthey're equalized. But those 18 districts account for\nless than half or about half of all the students.\nThat's the problem. It seems that isn't very\nrepresentative and we're trying to get\nrepresentativeness.\nMR. VAN AMBERG: Well, Justice Breyer, I, I\nwould respectfully like to go back, not to what we are\ntrying to accomplish through judicial decision, but what\nCongress accomplished through its decision.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I understand that. If the\nlanguage doesn't permit it you can't do it, they can't,\nand you win. But if the language does permit it, the\nreason -- you have to stretch the language, I suspect,\nin my view to get to the Government's result. It might\njust barely permit it. But one of the things on their\nside is that if we take your view it produces an absurd\nresult, because of what Justice Ginsburg said, because\nthere is such variation in the number of pupils among\nschool districts in different states.\nMR. VAN AMBERG: Right. If I could address\nthat, Your Honor. The only argument I see the State has\nis the argument about absurdity. This debate that we're\nhaving now is the debate that took place in 1976 in\nfront of the Secretary. He recognized that there were\ntwo methodologies that he was considering. He\nrecognized that they both had their problems. But in\n1994, Congress had before it at least or had available\nto it information as to the, whether, what, how this\nparticular formula would work. There were only three\nand perhaps -- three States, Kansas, Alaska, New Mexico,\nand perhaps Arizona -- that had -- that were trying to\ntake advantage of the, of this narrow exception. So\nthey knew the configuration and the composition of these\nschool districts.\nAnd so they could look if they wanted to --\nand there's no legislative history to this, but they\ncould have looked if they had wanted to, to exactly what\nthe practical effect would be of these two formulas.\nAnd the practical effect is that in New Mexico the\nformula which the Respondents contend is absurd reduced\nonly 11 percent of the LEAs. And with the backdrop that\nthis, that these LEAs should have been more or less\nequalized anyhow because of removing the disparate\nfunding, that's, that's much more reasonable and\ncertainly doesn't reflect an absurdity, and when you\ncompare that to the Secretary's approach which\neliminates 26 percent and cuts loose 23 school districts\nout of 89 from any consideration and you end up with\nkind of a core block in their 14 or 15 percent\ndisparity, I think there may be those who could argue\nforcefully that that's an absurdity.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I see your white light is\non. I don't want to take -- would the other States make\nthat same answer that you just made?\nMR. VAN AMBERG: Kansas equalizes under any\nformula, as New Mexico did, could do. Alaska, you\neliminate 22 percent in order for them to just kind of\nsqueak by. If they applied Congress's formula they\nwould just equalize. This is an option I contend that's\navailable to every State that wants to take advantage.\nIf you give them a 25 percent disparity allowance, you\nallow them to back out disequalizing expenditures.\nThere's really no explanation that's been offered why\nthere's any disequalization at all.\nWith that, if there is any time -- unless\nthere are any further questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Srinivasan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN, ESQ.\nON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESPONDENT\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Srinivasan, you don't\nwant us to stretch the language, do you?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I don't think you\nneed to stretch the language, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you wouldn't urge us to\ndo either, would you?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it depends on what\nyou mean by stretch.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SRINIVASAN: The question, the question\nbefore the Court is whether the Secretary's formula is\nunambiguously foreclosed by the statutory test, not\nwhether it's the better reading, but whether it's\nunambiguously foreclosed. And we happen to think it's\nthe better reading, but we certainly think it's not\nunambiguously foreclosed. And maybe the clearest\nindication that Congress did not unambiguously foreclose\nthe Secretary's methodology --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's the case that\nsays \"unambiguously foreclosed\"?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, Brand X says that,\nbut it's a characterization of the step one inquiry\nunder Chevron. And we can use \"foreclosed\" if you like,\nYour Honor.\nBut the clearest indication that the statute\ndoes not foreclose the Secretary's methodology is a\nprovision that I think hasn't been addressed thus far in\nthe argument and that's that in the very same act in\nCongress in which Congress enacted Section 7709, the\nprovision at issue here, Congress also explicitly\nendorsed and incorporated the Secretary's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You begin with an\nargument that directly cuts against your position. They\nknew how to do it under the -- I assume you're referring\nto the education finance and incentive grant program?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I am.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they did it\nthere, they didn't do it here. To me that suggests the\nopposite of the inference you're trying to draw.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I don't think so, Mr. Chief\nJustice, with respect. There are two education finance\nincentive grant program, or EFIG, provisions that we\nidentified in the briefs and one of them I would\nacknowledge is susceptible to that line of argument,\nalthough I don't think it's persuasive. But it's the\nother one that I'm focusing on, and what the other one\ndoes is to explicitly incorporate the Secretary's\nregulations and so what Congress said in 1994 is that\nfor purposes --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which they did not\nsay in this act.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: They didn't, but I think it\nwould be very odd to attribute to Congress the intention\non one hand to say, we like your regulation, so much so\nthat we want to use it and we want you to continue to\nuse it for purposes of the EFIG program --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Different purposes.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: They're not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They're for different\npurposes.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: They're not different\npurposes at all, Justice Scalia, with respect. They're\nthe exact same purpose. In both programs what Congress\nwanted to do was to get an assessment of the extent to\nwhich education expenditures were equalized in a State\namong school districts. They're the very same purpose.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But for different\npurposes. In the one case, in this act we're worried\nabout an extensive Federal presence that has an effect\non the tax base available for schools and under the EFIG\nprogram it's an entirely different question of\nequalization.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, at that level of\ngenerality you might be right, but with respect to the\npurpose of the equalization provisions of both of those\nacts the purpose is exactly the same. In impact aid,\njust like in EFIG, the question is to what extent has\nthe State equalized expenditures across school\ndistricts. It's the very same question.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, maybe let me\nask it directly. If they could so easily just say we\nincorporate the Secretary's regulation in EFIG, why\ndidn't they do it here?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, because --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They instead went to\nthe trouble of mimicking part of the regulation, but not\nmimicking the appendix, which is where your calculation\nmethodology is.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, they didn't mimic it.\nThey incorporated it. And so far as the argument is\nthat they incorporated just the regulation qua\nregulation and not the appendix to the regulation, I\ndon't think that that argument can be squared with the\nstatutory text or the regulatory text.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I ask, is there\na difference legally between a regulation and an\nappendix to the regulation?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I don't think so, at least\nnot in the circumstance of this case, where the\nregulation by its own terms incorporates the appendix.\nAnd so when Congress incorporated the regulation it\nnecessarily incorporated the appendix.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you say\n\"incorporated,\" though. What it did was it took the\nlanguage and it did not take --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No, I don't think so, Your\nHonor. The text of the statute in 1994 is set forth at\nthe top of page 30 of the Government's brief, and I'm\nquoting from the second line of page 30 and what\nCongress said in the EFIG statute in 1994, again in the\nvery same act that enacted this language --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In the EFIG statute?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: In the EFIG statute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But in this statute\nthe regulation says look to the, look at the appendix.\nCongress as I understood when it enacted our statute, it\ntook language from the regulation; it didn't take the\npart that said look to the appendix.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it didn't take the\npart that said look to the appendix because I don't know\nthat that would have been a sensible thing to do when\nyou're enacting a statute. But the point I'm trying to\nmake is that when Congress in the EFIG statute\nincorporated the regulation it specifically referred to\nthe regulation that the Secretary had in place at that\ntime.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it didn't do\nthat here?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It didn't do that here, but\nit didn't have to. It makes sense --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I still think it cuts\nagainst you rather than for you, the fact that they\ncould have done the same thing here and we wouldn't have\nthis case.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, let me just make one\nmore point on this, Your Honor, and then I'll move to\nthe text of Section 7709, because I do think that this\npoint has a great deal of force. The reason that\nCongress would have incorporated the regulation\nspecifically in EFIG but not in impact aid is because\nwe're dealing with an impact aid regulation. So the\nSecretary ordinarily wouldn't have thought that he\nshould apply the impact aid regulation for purposes of\nEFIG unless Congress told him to do that and that's what\nCongress did. But with respect to impact aid, there's\nno reason to incorporate the regulation. The regulation\nalready existed, and the question is did Congress in\nthis act foreclose the Secretary from continuing to\napply that longstanding regulatory methodology. And I\nwould suggest that if Congress really wanted to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Srinivasan, if we could\ncome to the, to the text that you're talking about.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Sure.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What I don't understand\nabout the Government's position is why you use this,\nthis per pupil theory for purposes of (B)i), but don't\nuse it for purposes of (A). You, you don't -- in the\nmajor computation portions, namely for purposes of\nparagraph 1, a program of State aid equalizes\nexpenditures among local expenditures, if in the second\nfiscal year is made the amount of per pupil expenditures\nmade by or per pupil revenue available to, you do it\nagency by agency, don't you? You DON'T apply this, you\nknow, it depends on how many pupils in each agency. Why\ndon't you do for both?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, if you look at 2(a),\nYour Honor what that says is that the disparity, the\ndisparity standard at its broadest level deals with\nwhether the per-pupil revenues for the highest ranked\nlocal educational agency exceeds the per pupil revenues\nfor the lowest one by 25 percent.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It would make no difference\nif you take into account pupils for that part of the\nanalysis, and here's the reason why. When you take into\naccount pupils with respect to a local educational\nagency and you weight the local, the figure by the\nnumber of pupils served by the local educational agency,\nthe per pupil figure that you're going to attach to each\nof those individual pupils is the same. It's the same\nper pupil figure for each one. It's just that you\nmultiply it by the number of pupils.\nSo for purposes of this part of the statute,\nwhere you're comparing the highest to the lowest,\nwhether you took into account the number of pupils or\nnot you'd still be dealing with the same two figures.\nYou'd be dealing with a figure that applies to the\nhighest ranked local educational agency and you'd be\ndealing with a figure that applies to the lowest ranked\nlocal educational agency.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying it comes to\nthe same, but the fact remains you don't use that\nmethodology in A, because you don't think the language\nrequires that methodology. And it is the same language\nin B.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No, there would be -- I\ndon't know that we use one or the other. It's just that\nthere would be absolutely no purpose served by using\npupils with respect to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the purpose would be\nto follow the language of the statute, and if you think\nthat the language in B requires this kind of an approach\nyou should take the same approach in A, especially if it\nmakes no difference.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, no; especially\nbecause it makes no difference, because with respect to\nthe B part of it, the 95th and 5th percentile\nexclusions, it makes all the difference in the world\nwhether you take into account --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I have a conceptual\ndifficulty, and it may be my limitations with the way\nyou do it. You take students and you assign a per-pupil\nnumber to each individual student.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Effectively.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I would have\nthought the per-pupil concept only makes sense if you're\ndealing with LEAs. They have a per-pupil number because\nthey've got a bunch of pupils. You take individual\nstudents, and you know for example in that school\ndistrict you don't spend the same amount of money on the\nkindergartner that you spend on the eighth grader. And\nyet, you give the kindergartner a per-pupil number and\nthe eighth grader a per-pupil number that is the same.\nIt's an artificial association. It makes sense to speak\nof per-pupil numbers when you're referring to the LEAs\nbecause they have so many pupils, they get so much\nmoney, you can do the calculation. It doesn't make\nsense to say, you know, John Smith the kindergartner has\na per-pupil expenditure of a thousand dollars. He may\nhave $200 and the eighth grader 2,000, so why are you\ncreating this artificial association and then using,\nusing that methodology?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it's an approximation\nto be sure, and per-pupil revenues by definition deal\nwith approximations across the swath of students that\nare covered by local educational agencies.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it's only -- the\nreason is to rank them if you have an entity that has a\nswath of students, the district, that's the way it\nshould be ranked. When you're ranking it by pupils,\nmaybe if you ranked them by pupils and you have the\nactual numbers of course, which nobody does, your\nmethodology would make sense.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think what we're\nreally doing, Your Honor, is weighting each figure by\nthe amount of pupils in the school district, and the\nreason we're doing that is to get a more accurate\npicture of the extent to which any one school district's\nper-pupil revenue figure contributes to the overall\nrevenue pictures in the State. And if I could use one\nexample which I think might help to crystallize why it's\nnecessary to do this sort of weighting and why education\nfinance practitioners routinely prescribe that you have\nto do this sort of weighting in order to avoid distorted\nresults, if you consider the example of a State that has\ntwo school districts, and I'll use real examples from\nNew Mexico. One would be the district that has the\nhighest per-pupil revenues in the state, the Mosquero\ndistrict, in which there's 57 pupils. And the other\nwould be the Albuquerque school district, the largest\nschool district in the State, which serves 84,000\npupils.\nNow the per-pupil revenues for Albuquerque\nare roughly $3,000 and the per-pupil revenues for\nMosquero, the smaller school district, are roughly\n$7,000. And if you imagine a State that consists of\njust those two districts, and you ask the question to\npair with the statutory language, what is the 50th\npercentile, and I'll use 50th just for ease of analysis,\nwhat is the 50th percentile of such per-pupil revenues\nin the State? One answer would be that you take the\nnumber for Mosquero, the 7,000 and you take the number\nfor Albuquerque, the 3,000, you split the difference and\nyou say the 50th percentile of per-pupil revenues in the\nState is $5,000. But I think that would present a very\nmisleading picture of what's actually going on in the\nState.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Because --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, because it's\nan absurd hypothetical. What is the --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I don't -- I -- it is not\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is the\nsmallest number of districts, what is the smallest\nnumber of school districts in a State?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: One.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which State has one\nschool district?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Hawaii. Hawaii has one\nwhich is a special case but there are states that have a\nrelatively small number of school districts.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In the, in the\nhypothetical you posed why couldn't the Secretary\naddress that disparity under (b)(ii)? In other words,\nthe school district which has only 57 students, it seems\nto me could be taken out of the calculation under\n(b)(ii), and then you would be dealing only with more\nrepresentative school districts, not the special case of\nthe particularly isolated school district or whatever.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Two points on (b)(ii),\nMr. Chief Justice. The first is that by -- by the\nstatutory text, (b)(ii) is over and above what you do in\n(b)(i,). The 95th and 5th percentiles exclusions. So\nyou first have to do that. But the more relevant\npoint --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why do you have to\ndo that? Why do you have to do it first? It says you\ncan take into account this -- extent to which the\nprogram reflects additional costs in particular\ndistricts.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No, my point is simply that\nunder (b)(i) the statute says the Secretary shall\ndisregard local education agencies that are above the\n95th and below the 5th percentile. So I think the\nSecretary has to do that. Now (b)(ii) in some sense\ncould be seen as an additional option for the Secretary\nover and above the exclusion, but there is a more\nfundamental point which is that with (b)(ii), it says\ntake into account the extent to which a program of State\naid reflects the additional costs.\nAnd so what that does is a piggyback on the\nway that the State approaches the situation. So this,\nas -- this provision as the Secretary understands it\nallows it to give effect to a State that gives effect to\nthose sorts of considerations, but it's not an\nindependent grant of authority for the Secretary himself\nto take those considerations into account.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Srinivasan, you -- you\nmay have convinced me. I'll stipulate that you have\nconvinced me that the argument that you're arguing for\nwould probably be a better method, but you haven't\ntouched the text of (b)(2)(b)(i) yet, and that's where\nsome of us at least are, are having our -- our problems.\nDo you agree that in the absence of the\nother program, I forget the, the acronym for it -- that\nyou really would not have any argument that there is\nambiguity in the text here?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No. No. Absolutely not.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then -- then would you\naddress the text?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Sure, I will.\nIt's at page 4a of the appendix of the\nGovernment's brief, b -- (b)(i). And what the text says\nis disregard local educational agencies with per-pupil\nexpenditures or revenues above the 59th percentile or\nbelow the 5th percentile of such expenditures or\nrevenues in the State.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Now one point I make --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So what is supposed to be\ndisregarded are educational agencies?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right. And the agencies\nare identified how? How do we identify the agencies\nthat would be disregarded?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: You identify the agencies\nto be disregarded by first identifying the 59th and 5th\npercentiles of per-pupil revenues in the State. And\nthen you disregard --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And we identify their\nper-pupil revenues, too, don't we? Agencies with\nper-pupil expenditures or revenues above or below,\nright?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Yes, but -- and -- but the\ncritical test is the 95th percentile and 5th percentile\nof such expenditures or revenues in the State.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that critical test is\nbeing applied to an agency which is being identified by\nreference to per-pupil expenditures or revenues,\ncorrect?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It is. I mean there is no\ndoubt that the per-pupil revenues or expenditure figures\nthat lie on the spectrum are associated with the local\neducational agencies. That's how --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it's not merely that\nthey are associated with. The very definition, the very\nidentification of LEA here is exclusively in terms of\nper-pupil expenditures or revenues. It's not merely in\nassociation. It is a definition, isn't that so?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I don't think so. The --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then, then what does the\nphrase with per-pupil expenditures or revenues above 95\nor below 5 mean?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, that's true that each\nlocal education agency has a per-pupil expenditure or\nrevenue. But the critical part of the statute which has\n59th percentile or 5th percentile of such expenditures\nor revenues doesn't foreclose weighting. And I think\nthe point that Justice Alito made bears, which is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, why doesn't it? It\nseems to me that the only identification of an entity or\nperson, if you want, to be disregarded is the\nidentification of an LEA, and the LEA is described in\nterms exclusively of its expenditures or revenues. So\nwhy doesn't that foreclose your position?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, we -- two parts to\nthe answer, Justice Souter. First the Secretary's\nformulation, no less than Petitioner's formulation, does\ndisregard local educational agencies with per-pupil\nrevenues above the 95th and 5th percentiles.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right. Obviously --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Where we disagree is in\nidentifying the 95th exactly.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: After identifying them in\nterms of the expenditures or revenues. That's what\nyou're supposed to do.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Exactly. And I'd --\nexactly. And I'd reiterate the point that Justice Alito\nmade earlier, which is that Congress could have\ncompelled the approach that Petitioners compelled --\ncontend, if it would have said --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: There are lots of things\nthat Congress could have done differently from what it\ndid do, but it, that doesn't seem to me to inject an\nambiguity in the identification in, in this subsection\nof the LEA that we are talking about. And it doesn't\ncreate an ambiguity in, in the clear provision that what\nis to be disregarded is an LEA as so defined.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think it does, Your\nHonor, because there are two different ways of ranking\nthe LEAs. One is to take the per-pupil revenues\nassociated with each LEA and simply take that list into\naccount. Another is to take the same list but then\nweight it by the number of pupils in each LEA.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Sure, that's another way to\n--\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Nothing in the statute\nforecloses that approach.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- do it, but tell me why\nthat is consistent with the text.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Because the text refers to\nthe 95th and 5th percentiles of such expenditures or\nrevenues in the State, and the list that includes the\nweighting does represent a list of expenditures or\nrevenues in the State.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would such be -- of such\nexpenditures or revenues. That refers back to local\neducational agencies with per-pupil expenditures or\nrevenues. It's referring you back not to the totality\nof students but to, to agencies with per-pupil\nexpenditures or revenues.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Sure. And I don't, I don't\ndispute that the per-pupil revenue figures belong to a\nlocal educational agency. But again that doesn't mean\nthat you can't take into account the relative extent to\nwhich a particular school district contributes to the\noverall State picture, and the way you do that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Wouldn't the statute\nhave told you, though, to, to disregard pupils according\nto the ranking? It does tell you to disregard LEAs,\nwhich suggests the ranking -- at least to me, that the\nranking ought to be of LEAs and not pupils.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it is, it is a\nranking of LEAs in the first instance and then it's,\neach of those LEA figures is weighted by the number of\npupils the way we do it, and we do end up disregarding\nLEAs. But as Justice Souter pointed out the first step\nis identifying the 5th and 95th percentiles, and on that\nstep we take into account the number of pupils. It's\nonly at that step that we take into account the number\nof pupils.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: And nothing in the statute\nforecloses that. I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- a rather basic\nquestion? What if I'm convinced that your opponent's\nreading is really only the fair reading of the statute,\nbut I'm also convinced by you that that's not what\nCongress intended. What should I do?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, one way or another I\nthink your should rule in our favor.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well no. Accept, accept\nmy premises. What do you think I should do?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think in that\nsituation you sort of have the sliding scale that we\noften confront with textual analysis. And if you really\nthink that Congress would have compelled an absurd\nresult, and I think it does verge on that, then you\nwould --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I don't think it has to be\nabsurd, it's just, I would measure it by what Congress\nactually intended. Assume there two permissible\nreadings, and two -- both of them make sense. And I'm\nconvinced, assume I'm convinced by you, that they really\nintended to perpetuate the prior method of procedure.\nMay I take that, may I come to that result\neven though I think the language really says exactly\nwhat your opponent says it says?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, if the language\nabsolutely unambiguously compels that reading, then I\nthink it would be a difficult position. But I don't\nthink it goes, goes to that degree.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought\nyour office had answered that question in countless\nbriefs where it tells us to be guided by the language of\nthe statute and not some unexpressed intent.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, that's why I said, if\nyou think that the statute unambiguously actually\ncompels that reading, then I don't know that we would\nhave a position.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you still have a\nChurch of the Holy Trinity team over there somewhere,\ndon't you?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why doesn't it -- why\ndoesn't absolutely compel it? Where is the ambiguity,\nyou say?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It says --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- the 5th percentile of\nsuch per-pupil expenditure. And that --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now how are you going to\nget that so it doesn't just say just list cards with\nper-pupil expenditure on it, different ones and take the\ntop five?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, well it's just the\nnumber of cards, ultimately, under your hypothetical,\nJustice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do you have a lot of cards\nthat have the same cards that have the same number? You\nhave a lot --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: They have the same cards,\nwe just have -- they have the numbers, exactly.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It's the same cards with\nthe same numbers. We just add more cards in order to\nreflect the extent to which each LEA contributes to the\noverall picture.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And why, why don't you take\nthe top five where we have 10 percent of the students,\nlet's take the second five and they happens to have the\nsame number on the card as the first five, and why don't\nthey fall in the first 5 percent?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I'm not sure I understand.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Forget it.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Sorry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you enlighten us a\nlittle bit about how this statute developed?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Sure.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: As far as I know it was\nthe same Secretary of Education when the statute came on\nthe books and when the regulation was kind of readopted,\nI think it was --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I think that's right,\nJustice Ginsburg.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there was a peculiar\nproposal to drop, it was the Secretary's proposal to\ndrop the bottom five. So it was a different proposal,\nand what was the reason for that? Why keep, keep the\n95th percentile but not the 5th?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, as we point out in a\nfootnote in our brief there was some education finance\nexperts that suggested there would be no reason to\nretain the exclusion at the bottom of the range, and I\nthink that's because when you have low per-pupil\nrevenues there is a reason not to exclude those figures.\nBut the important point is the material\nimportant part of the language, which is 95th percentile\nof such expenditures or revenues in the State, is\nexactly what the Secretary proposed and the Secretary of\ncourse wouldn't have curtailed his own discretion to\ncontinue the same methodology that he had long had in\nplace. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMr. Manasevit.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LEIGH M. MANASEVIT,\nON BEHALF OF STATE RESPONDENT\nMR. MANASEVIT: Mr. Chief Justice, may it\nplease the Court:\nI'd like to begin with Justice Ginsburg's\nquestion, because I think that that is very illuminating\nto where we are today. This statute began against a\nhistory, an 18-year history where the agency had been\ndelegated by Congress virtually carte blanche authority\nto devise equalization tests. That was the earlier\nstatute. The agency had three tests at the time. One\nwas the 25 percent disparity test that we see today and\nthere were two other tests.\nIn 1994, what happened was the Secretary\nproposed to the Congress and the Congress following the\nSecretary's lead eliminated the two other tests.\nThat's, that's what was happening. And Justice Scalia\nasked well, why would the Secretary tie his hands? What\nhappened was the Secretary no longer was satisfied or\nliked the other two tests and eliminated those and\nproposed the test that he had been using for 18 years to\nthe Congress. Congress adopted that test and that's the\ntest that we have today, the 25 percent disparity test.\nThe difference is that whereas the Secretary\nhad the free rein to develop that disparity test,\nhowever he wanted, previously, the Secretary -- the\nCongress now told the Secretary in disparity, do the\nfollowing things. First of all 25 percent is the\nmaximum disparity that we are going to allow you, number\none. And number two, take out the outliers in a range\nof 5 to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't it -- I'm\nsorry. Go ahead.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You know, I really don't\ncare what the Secretary thought he was doing. I mean,\nit seems to me we have to ask the question, what would a\nmember of Congress who voted on this thing have thought\nhe was voting for, who had, you know, didn't have this\nhistory you're giving us. And more importantly, what\nwould a citizen to whom this language is promulgated\nthink the language means? I don't care what the\nSecretary had in the back of his mind. Why should that\nmake any difference to us?\nMR. MANASEVIT: Fair question, Justice\nScalia, and that brings us back to the language of the\nstatute, where of course we begin, and we have to look\nprecisely to the language of the statute. The language\nof the statute, what Petitioners mistake is that the\nlanguage of the statute here has a two-part process. We\ndon't look at LEAs first. It doesn't say 5th percentile\nof LEAs. We have to first rank expenditures or revenues\nin the State. It's above 95th percentile or below 5th\npercentile of the expenditures.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of such expenditures or\nrevenues.\nMR. MANASEVIT: Of such.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you've got to find out\nwhat \"such\" refers to.\nMR. MANASEVIT: And \"such\" would refer just\nto the previous usage of that precise term, which is\ndisregard local education agencies with per-pupil\nexpenditures or revenues. So it's that \"with per-pupil\nrevenues\" that the \"such\" would refer back to, the most\nimmediate prior reference, so we're still looking at\nper-pupil revenues or expenditures in the State which we\nhave to rank first. We don't identify LEAs first. It\ndoesn't say 95th percentile of LEAs. It tells us rank\nper-pupil revenue. The only difference --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It says disregard LEAs; it\nthen identifies certain LEAs which are to be\ndisregarded. Nowhere does it say disregard pupils.\nMR. MANASEVIT: No. It says -- it says --\nwe are disregarding the LEAs. That's the end of the\nprocess. But we have to identify the range of value\nthat 5 percent and 95 percent applies to. The range --\nthe percentiles apply to a range of values. We have in\nNew Mexico, we have 89 amounts of per-pupil revenue per\ndistrict, we have 89 of those. But we also have 377,000\nper-pupil revenues, because a per-pupil revenue repeats\nfor every time that there's a student, and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. No. See,\nthat's my conceptual difficulty. It is only per pupil\nwhen you're dealing with an aggregation of the pupils.\nIf you're going to break it down pupil by pupil, which\nis what you do, you don't have a per-pupil number\nassociated with each pupil. You have a number. Nobody\nknows what it is because nobody knows how much you spend\non each individual. We know how much you give to this\ndistrict, and therefore, the district has a per-pupil\nnumber, and therefore, I would have thought a reference\nto per-pupil numbers suggests you're grouping according\nto district.\nMR. MANASEVIT: Mr. Chief Justice, we are\nnot saying that it can't. We're -- all we're saying is\nthat it equally carries both meanings. School finance\nis an extraordinarily technical area, which is precisely\nwhy Congress left this issue to the agency to work this\nout. When Congress -- when Congress used the terms 5\npercent and 10 percent, and again I'm not, I'm not\nreading Congress's mind to say that when Congress used\nthose terms, those percentiles, Congress must have\nintended some national uniformity. This is a national\nprogram and Congress expects these programs to be\napplied somewhat uniformly across -- across the country.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let me --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let me ask you the same\nquestion I asked -- I asked the Government. Why don't\nyou, if this is a natural reading, why don't you apply\nit to, to 2.A? You don't even think of doing that in\n2.A. In 2.A you just look at the individual agency, but\nit's the same language in 2.A.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: In 2.A, 2.A calls for a\ndifferent type of comparison. And I also note that in\n2.A it refers to percent instead of percentile, which\nrefers to two numbers being compared. Percentile refers\nto an entire ranking of value, so the processes are\nsomewhat different. Now we're not, I'm not contending\nthat this statute is absolutely clear and a model of\ndraftsmanship, but certainly the meaning of 95th\npercentile or 5th percentile of such expenditures or\nrevenues is a broad enough term.\nJUSTICE BREYER: To include the words\nper-pupil revenue for each pupil, is that what you're\nsaying?\nMR. MANASEVIT: Well, to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: How do you want to say it,\nper-pupil revenue attached to each pupil?\nMR. MANASEVIT: Well, I believe --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Or how do you want to say\nit then?\nMR. MANASEVIT: I believe simply that the\nword per-pupil revenue can mean the dollar amount per\neach agency 89 times, or it can mean repeated each time\na student generates --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is attached to each\npupil? You say the word such is broad enough to include\nper-pupil revenue as attached to each pupil?\nMR. MANASEVIT: Yes. Correct. Remember --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I don't know where to\nlook to discover if you're right or wrong.\nMR. MANASEVIT: Well, bear in mind -- bear\nin mind the nature of many education --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there any statistical\ntext that you could look at to see it that's the way\npeople use the words?\nMR. MANASEVIT: That answer I couldn't\nanswer, but I can tell you that typically in an\neducation statute, funding is distributed on the basis\nof numbers of pupils. So if the statute says $3,000 per\npupil shall go somewhere, the -- the statute means you\ntake that dollar amount and you --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that must not\nbe right, because otherwise we wouldn't have any\ndisparity to worry about equalization in the first\nplace. Right?\nMR. MANASEVIT: Well, we always -- we always\nwill have disparity in the real world and that -- and\nthat's because lots of things cause disparity. In this\ncase actually, local tax revenues are not the cause of\ndisparity because there are no significant local tax\nrevenues at issue here. But disparity happens -- in the\ntop three or four districts in New Mexico you have under\n100 students, or slightly over 100 students. In a\ndistrict that small, minor things, an insurance recovery\nfor example, a couple hundred thousand dollar insurance\nrecovery in a district of 87 students will generate\n$3,000 of revenue per member for that year. It's a\ndistorting figure. That's precisely what Congress is\ntrying to get rid of.\nBut when Congress says 5 percent, presumably\nCongress intends that 5 percent to have some uniform\napplicability across the country and not vary with a\nState like New Mexico where it would just eliminate five\ndistricts. Or in our -- in our neighboring State of\nMaryland, Montgomery County has the highest per-pupil\nrevenues in the State. It has 16 percent of the\npopulation. Under petitioners' view, that -- and it has\n24 districts, so that district would be eliminated under\npetitioners' view. It would completely be eliminated.\nYet under our view, the 10 percent would fall within\nthat and we would keep it in. So --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Don't you think\nCongress, if Congress is concerned about the, in this\nprovision, about the impact of the Federal presence, and\nyour reading prevents the money that Congress meant to\ngo to those particular districts from actually reaching\nthe districts, I mean, wouldn't we be inclined to read\nit the way that, let the money get where Congress meant\nit to go?\nMR. MANASEVIT: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, because that was on the list of things that I\nwanted to cover, and I'm sure that petitioners 'counsel\ninadvertently misspoke. Impact aid never ever gets\ndiverted from the district. Impact Aid goes from the\nFederal Government pursuant to a formula --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, sure, but then\nthe question is whether the State can consider it when\nthey're figuring out how much money to give it. So in\neffect it's diverted.\nMR. MANASEVIT: Well, remember, the State\nfigures a total cost of program for every district\nstarting from zero, number of students and dollars\nneeded to manage those number of students, and the State\nsupplies that amount of money. So where the district\ngets some of that necessary money from another source,\nthe State under equalization is allowed to just consider\nthat that amount of money, in addition to what the State\nis going to provide, will provide the entire amount.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. MANASEVIT: Thank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Van Amberg, you\nhave three minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD J. VAN AMBERG\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. VAN AMBERG: Mr. Chief Justice had a\nquestion as to whether or not the, an appendix is\nsomething different from a regulation or carries a\ndifferent weight, and I haven't found anything\ndeterminative. But I would refer the Court to Young\nversus Community Nutrition Institute where it identifies\nsomething similar to an appendix as an example, and the\nCourt says an example is just that, an example.\nAnd I don't think we need the argument to\nprevail, but we would submit that it is at best\nconfusion, it's confusing that the Secretary would take\nthe body of the methodology proposed by Congress, put it\nin his, in the body of his regulation, and then refer\nthe public to an appendix in order to, how to work the\nmethodology. And in this appendix, he then flips what\nCongress intended and what he had in the body of his own\nregulation.\nI would also suggest that Congress cannot be\npresumed even in this instance to not be, at least have\nsome input as to what was happening. In the Senate\nbill, my understanding is that there was a suggestion\nthat the disparity figure would only be 10 percent and\nnot 25 percent. That didn't make it through but the\nstatute as it was written, and I think lasted for about\na year or so, had the disparity amount going from 25\npercent to 20 percent. That was subsequently amended\nand kept back up at the 25 percent level. So the idea\nthat this was not a bill where Congress paid attention,\nI think, is not a warranted assumption.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Van Amberg, could a\nState get to the same result? Let's say your reading of\nthe statute is the only permissible one. By combining\nschool districts, it's no longer going to be the X\nschool district and the Y school district, it will be\nthe XY school district, and then the population would\nincrease. Still only one LEA.\nMR. VAN AMBERG: There is a provision,\nJustice Ginsburg, in the Impact Aid Act, and I think\nit's 7113, in which it basically says that if the\nSecretary of the Education perceives that a State is\nmanipulating its LEAs in a way in which to take\nadvantage of the, of this limited exception, it can\ndisregard that action. So I think there is built -- I\nthink Congress was one step ahead of us and recognized\nthat possibility and addressed it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Thank you.\nMR. VAN AMBERG: Thank you. With that,\nthank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
