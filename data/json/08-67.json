        "content": "(10:06 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument today in Yeager v. United States.\nMr. Buffone.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL J. BUFFONE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BUFFONE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWhen a jury's acquittal resolves an issue in\na defendant's favor, that determination is final and the\ngovernment may not seek an inconsistent determination of\nthat issue from a second jury. Unlike acquittals, hung\ncounts are not verdicts. They decide nothing, and\ntherefore a hung count cannot be inconsistent with an\nacquittal. A straightforward application of this\nCourt's decision in Ashe v. Swenson is all that is\ncalled for in this case. A new rule is not necessary.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Buffone, may I raise\none preliminary issue? And it's an issue which is --\ndoes not go to the reason we took the case, but I'd like\nyour response to it. Your argument, your Ashe v.\nSwenson argument, assumes, as you have said in the\nbrief, that the -- that the verdicts of acquittal\nessentially determined that your client did not possess\ninsider knowledge, and I question whether the verdicts\nof acquittal did necessarily establish that fact. I've\nlooked at the -- at the jury instructions, and I will be\ncandid to say I did not parse the whole jury\ninstruction, so you may very well correct me in the\nassumption that I'm going to make. But the point of the\n-- of the jury instruction that seemed to go to your\nargument is set out on page 105 of the Joint Appendix,\nand the judge is telling the jurists what they had to\nfind. And one of them was that your client made any\nuntrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state\na material fact necessary in order to make the\nstatements made, in the light of the circumstances under\nwhich they were made, not misleading as charged.\nIt seems to me that the jury under that\ninstruction could have come back with a verdict of\nacquittal simply on the assumption that your client had\nnot made affirmative statements at the -- at the meeting\nin question, therefore he had no obligation to correct\nany statements, because it is not clear from this\ninstruction that he had to correction the statements of\nother people who omitted material facts, and that\ntherefore the only thing that the verdict proves or the\nonly thing that the verdict may have assumed is that he\ndidn't speak up and say anything.\nIs that a possible analysis?\nMR. BUFFONE: I do not believe so, Your\nHonor, for two reasons. First, under the Ashe test as\ninterpreted by this Court in Dowling, the record as a\nwhole must be analyzed. And in Dowling the Court looked\nat admissions made by the defendant's attorney during\nthe course of the second proceeding that identification\nof his client was not an issue. Similarly here, looking\nat the entirety of the record, in its arguments closing\nand opening, and most importantly in its\ncross-examination of Mr. Yeager, the government made\nclear to the jury its theory of omissions. And that\ntheory of omission was that Mr. Yeager when he was at\nthe 2000 Analysts Conference had a duty to stand up and\ncorrect omissions if there were any misstatements made\nby others. They argued to the jury that he would be\nguilty of omissions if he did not affirmatively correct\nit.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, no, I agree that did\nseem to be the point of the cross-examination, and in\nfact I guess you set it out in one of the briefs. But\nis that enough? To my knowledge, we've never held that\nthat is enough to convert or, let's say, to -- for us to\nassume, despite a more protean jury instruction, that\nthe jury necessarily had to find a fact. And I guess\nmaybe my question boils down to is: Why should what\nperhaps consumed 60 or 80 seconds of cross-examination\nsuffice to tighten up a jury instruction which -- which\nbasically is open-ended?\nMR. BUFFONE: Well, Your Honor, first there\nwas more to the trial record than a snippet of\ncross-examination. Again, in opening statement the\ngovernment began by arguing to the jury that Mr. Yeager\nwas the man behind the screen, that he was --\nJUSTICE ALITO: That's the government's --\nthat's the government's argument. And in order to\nconvict for securities fraud based on an omission, isn't\nit necessary for there to be a duty to disclose? And\nwhat would prevent -- how can we be sure that the jury\nhere did not find that there was no securities fraud\nbecause, insofar as the government was proceeding on an\nomissions theory, your client didn't have a duty to\ndisclose, did not cause a material fact to be omitted.\nMR. BUFFONE: Your Honor, first, the\ninstructions permitted alternative ways to reach the\nfirst element of securities fraud, and one of the three\nalternatives was either misstatements or omissions. And\nI think the instruction, for all of its frailty, was\nclear that the jury could convict on an omissions\ntheory. Now, Your Honor's question --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I agree with that, but why\ncouldn't they find that there was no securities fraud\nbased on an omissions theory because there wasn't any\nduty on Mr. Yeager's part to disclose?\nMR. BUFFONE: Your Honor, the indictment was\nan integrated theory of fraud, that it charged that Mr.\nYeager and others had planned to make misrepresentations\nand material omissions for one purpose, and that purpose\nwas to enhance the price of Enron stock so that they\ncould later engage in insider trading to sell that\nstock. The omissions theory was grounded in the\nindictment. It was elucidated by the instructions, and\nit was clarified so that there could be no uncertainty\nby the cross-examination and arguments of counsel.\nThis jury -- under an Ashe analysis, the\nquestion is what did this jury believe and what did they\nrationally decide?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But Ashe is quite a\ndifferent case. Ashe is a seriatim prosecution. It was\none event, a robbery. There were six victims. Victim\nnumber one, the charge relating to victim number one,\nwas an acquittal. That necessarily decided that the\ndefendant was not among the robbers. So that is quite a\ndifferent situation from what we have here.\nMR. BUFFONE: Justice Ginsburg, first, it is\nmy belief that seriatim prosecutions raise no greater\nthreat to the core values of double jeopardy than was\nraised here. Those core values are, first of all, the\nfinality of acquittals; and the acquittal here was\noffended by any effort to retry an issue of fact\nnecessarily decided.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You're not contending\nthat double jeopardy itself was at issue? In other\nwords, claim preclusion. There would be no claim\npreclusion, so we're talking only about issue\npreclusion?\nMR. BUFFONE: Yes, Your Honor, I would like\nto --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That means it was\nnecessarily, the issue was necessarily decided?\nMR. BUFFONE: That's correct, Your Honor.\nWe do not argue claim preclusion here. Our argue is\nissue preclusion or previously known as collateral\nestoppel before clarification by this Court.\nYour Honor, to the question of seriatim\nprosecution, again, although Ashe was in a sense a\nseriatim prosecution, in all of the Ashe-type cases\ndecided by this Court jeopardy had not even attached,\nlet alone terminated.\nThe issue we believe should be addressed in\nterms of what was the finality of the judgment. The\nfinality of the judgment here were six acquittals.\nThose acquittals were final and were not subject to\nredetermination. The issue preclusive effect arises\nfrom the jury's acquittals, not from the hung counts,\nthe hung counts which were not final and which resolved\nnothing.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So the hung counts are\nequivalent, equivalent to an acquittal?\nMR. BUFFONE: No, Your Honor, I think\nprecisely the opposite. Hung counts have none of the\nforce of an acquittal. They have none of what this\nCourt has historically recognized as the powerful way\nthat a jury speaks when it acquits in cases such as\nMartin Linen, where the court recognized that. The hung\ncounts historically, as we set out in our brief, were\nnot even accepted at common law as an option for a jury.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But we said -- we said in\nAshe, didn't we, that you should take into account all\nthe circumstances in determining what was decided in the\nfirst acquittal, all the circumstances. How can -- how\ncan you close your eyes to the circumstance that is\nalleged here, that the -- the hung jury portion of the\njury's verdict is simply inconsistent with the acquittal\nportion, and therefore you should not count the\nacquittal for double jeopardy purposes? Isn't this part\nof the total circumstances?\nMR. BUFFONE: Justice Scalia, first, we\nbelieve that the -- I believe that the Ashe test relates\nto the total circumstances on the record. What is it\nfrom the record that the Court can derive meaning from?\nThe Court can derive meaning from all that was presented\nto the jury, and from all that the jury decided. In its\nhung counts, the jury did not speak with the unanimity\nand the finality that it did in its acquittals. As this\nCourt, speaking through -- in both the majority and the\nconcurring opinions, dissenting opinions in Sattazahn,\nrecognized, hung counts speak nothing.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But in a sense that's\nJustice Scalia's point, that the jury has in effect told\nus nothing, and in effect that argument hurts your case\nin one sense. Hung counts are meaningless.\nMR. BUFFONE: Justice Kennedy, I agree that\nthe hung counts are meaningless and that is my point,\nbut I believe that it does further our analysis and the\nproper analysis that this Court should engage in. And\nthat is, do the acquittals have finality, and is there\nanything inconsistent with the jury's inability to reach\na determination with the finality of its acquittals?\nThe jury did not speak unanimously in its acquittals.\nThere is no record way to determine why they failed to\nreach a determination, and they are therefore not\ninconsistent with the final determination --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It shows -- it shows that\n-- that the point on which they -- you assert they were\nunanimous and the point on which you say later\nprosecution should be disallowed was in fact a point on\nwhich the jury was confused, because they would have\ncome out the other way if indeed they were unanimous on\nthe counts that -- that acquitted. They should have\ncome out the same way on the -- on the hung counts.\nMR. BUFFONE: Your Honor, we simply don't\nknow that. The jury may have failed to reach a verdict\nfor any number of reasons. On the basis of this record,\nit's quite possible that the reason that the jury failed\nto reach a verdict was that it had 176 counts before it;\nthat the jury, as set out in our reply brief, had made\nknown to the district court that it was under severe\nfinancial stress. The jurors wanted the trial to be\nover so that they could get back to their full-time\nemployment, and one of the jurors actually asked to be\nremoved from the jury because of that financial\ndistress.\nIn the face of that, the court gave a very\nunusual Allen charge; that after the jury had sent out a\nnote saying that they were deadlocked, the court issued\nan Allen charge and 70 minutes later discharged the\njury. It -- the -- the point, Your Honor, is that we\nwill never know why this jury --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The point is that they were\ndeadlocked and would not have been deadlocked, assuming\nwe don't inquire into -- into the issue that Justice\nSouter raised -- they were deadlocked and would not have\nbeen deadlocked if indeed they made the -- the acquittal\nfinding that you're relying upon for double jeopardy.\nMR. BUFFONE: Your Honor, we know that they\nacquitted. That is a certainty. We have finality to\nthose acquittals. They were unanimous and are not\nsubject to question again. They cannot be subject to\nappeal, and they cannot be subject to overturning, even\nif they are egregiously erroneous.\nWhen we lay next to that the hung counts and\nthe way that hung counts have historically been looked\nat, first not tolerated by courts: Coercive means\napplied depriving jurors of food and drink and heat in\ncold climates until they reached a verdict; contemporary\nlaw where we permit Allen charges in a quest for\nunanimity to, wherever possible, have a jury speak its\nwill. We cannot equate, in the light of that history\nand the firm precedent of this Court, an inability to\nreach a decision with the finality and persuasion of an\nacquittal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if Powell\nextends to subsequent prosecutions -- I know you argue\nthat it doesn't, but if it does, isn't it unusual that\nthe defendant is in better shape if a jury hangs on the\nnon-acquitted count than if he is convicted on the non-\nacquitted count?\nMR. BUFFONE: Well, Your Honor, that's a --\na two-edged sword, Mr. Chief Justice. The defendant is\non the opposite horns of that dilemma. If the counts\nare not joined, then the effect of the acquittal would\nbe to bar them by res judicata. So by joinder, he's on\nthe other side of that fence. It's, as this Court\nrecognized, whose ox is being gored in Powell by either\nthe acquittals or the convictions. Well, this is a case\nof whose ox is being gored by the joinder, and it should\nnot be dispositive. Collateral estoppel effect should\napply to counts within an indictment just as res\njudicata would apply if they were separated.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's an obvious question, I\nguess. I would just like to hear your answer directly.\nCase 1, count 1, selling drugs; count 2, using the\ntelephone to sell the drugs. All right? The jury\nacquits of the first, convicts of the second. Logically\nimpossible, but permitted under the law, right?\nMR. BUFFONE: I agree, Your Honor. Under\nPowell --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Case 2 --\nMR. BUFFONE: -- there is no question. We\nhave conflicting verdicts, and we are not going to try\nto determine what the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Absolutely\nillogical. Case 2, there is no count 1. Case 2,\ntelephone count, hung jury; we retry it. Permitted,\nright?\nMR. BUFFONE: Now, Your Honor, that would\ndepend on what happened at the trial.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All that happened was that\nthey hung.\nMR. BUFFONE: Well, if they hung, Your\nHonor, yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Case 2, hung jury,\ntelephone count; we retry it. All right. So now why is\nit when we put them together and, case 3, count 1,\nsubstantive drugs, acquitted; count 2, telephone, hung\njury. Well, in case 2 we could get a retrial of the\ntelephone count. Why can't we get a retrial of the\ntelephone count now?\nMR. BUFFONE: Your Honor, it would depend.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All that happened is they\nare retrying it just as they did in case 2. Why does\nthe presence of count 1 there mean that they can't retry\nit?\nMR. BUFFONE: Your Honor, the presence of\ncount 1 in your hypothetical is not dispositive. An\nacquittal on count 1 says --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I -- I'm going too fast\nbecause you didn't take the cases in. Do you want me to\nrepeat them? Maybe it's too complicated.\nI'm just saying case 1, count 1, the\nsubstantive count, conviction. On count 2, telephone\ncount, acquittal. Everybody agrees that's permissible.\nCase 2 is only the telephone. That's all they indicted\nhim for. And if they have a hung jury, you can, can't\nyou, retry him?\nMR. BUFFONE: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, now, when we have case\n3, which is the same as case 1 except that, instead of\nconvicting him, they had a hung jury, why can't you\nretry him, just as you could in case 2?\nMR. BUFFONE: Because a hung jury resolves\nnothing, Your Honor. It doesn't --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, everybody agrees it\nresolves nothing, and that's why you could retry him in\n-- that's why you could retry him in case 2, because it\nresolves nothing. So if you could retry him in case 2,\nwhy can't you retry him in case 3? What does the\npresence of this other substantive count have to do with\nit. Since it never would have blocked the conviction on\ncount 2, why does it stop you from retrying count 2?\nIt would never have blocked the conviction\nof count 2. Why does it stop you from retrying it?\nDo you see -- do you see my --\nMR. BUFFONE: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's the logical point I\nthought the other side was making, and maybe they're not\nbecause it seems to be striking you as surprising or\nmaybe I'm not making it in a clear way. But what I\nwanted was a clear answer to it.\nMR. BUFFONE: Your Honor, I believe the --\nthe clear answer is that for collateral estoppel to\nattach, there must be a necessary determination of a\nfactual issue, and the necessary determination of that\nfactual issue can occur in your count 1 through an\nacquittal or a conviction. It cannot occur through a\nhung count because there is nothing to be resolved.\nThere is nothing that would be necessarily decided.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Buffone, you're --\nyou're going through a logical analysis. If I\nunderstand your position, the logical analysis is not\ngoing to win the case for you because, as I understand\nthe case that we've got in front of us, we have in\neffect two lines of authority, two models, that describe\nwhat the law might be in these circumstances.\nOne model, on -- on the assumption that -- that the\nacquittals determined what you say they did, on that\nmodel there -- there is -- there is an issue preclusion\nthat is raised.\nOn the second model, the model of what we do\nin the case of a hung jury, there is no -- of course, no\npreclusion, and there is no bar to a retrial. And we've\nsimply got both in the same case. The question is:\nWhich model do we follow? Do we say preclusion is the\nmost important issue here, or do we say the\nopen-endedness and uncertainty of the hung jury, the --\nthe failure to reach a verdict, is the model that --\nthat tells us what we ought to do? How do we choose\nbetween those two possibilities, each of which is open\nto us?\nMR. BUFFONE: Yes, Your Honor, I believe\nthat that is a clear choice, and the rationale for the\nclarity of that choice is that acquittals have long been\nrecognized as being important for finality purposes for\ndouble jeopardy law. So, for example --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Look, I know that, and --\nand by the same token, hung juries have long been\nrecognized as raising no bar to a further trial. And\nthe question is: Why are the values in the -- the\nacquittal case predominating, as you say they are, over\nthe values of the retrial possibilities? Why do I\nchoose one rather than another?\nMR. BUFFONE: Yes, Your Honor. The -- the\nPerez line that tells us that when there is manifest\nnecessity arising from a jury not reaching a verdict,\nthat retrial is appropriate following a hung count.\nThat line of cases stands in -- as I believe is the\nbasis of Your Honor's question, stands in sharp contrast\nto the line of cases that require that jury acquittals\nbe given final effect, cases like Foo Fong -- Fong Foo,\nexcuse me.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We have got both.\nMR. BUFFONE: All right, so what --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what is it -- and I\nwould almost suggest THAT it has to be something outside\nthe lines of authority, because the issue here is which\nline of authority are you going to pick. What is it\noutside the lines of authority that says we should -- we\nshould pick the acquittal model rather than the hung\njury model to determine what to do here?\nMR. BUFFONE: Your Honor, I think we should\ngo -- the Court should go to the history of its double\njeopardy jurisprudence, and that makes clear that the\ncore concepts underlying the Double Jeopardy Clause are:\nFirst finality of jury verdicts; and, second, to avoid\nall of the constitutional perils of successive trials,\nbecause successive trials --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you this about the\nfinality of jury verdicts? Is -- does the Constitution\nrequire either Federal or State law to permit the -- a\npartial verdict?\nMR. BUFFONE: Your Honor, I do not believe\nthat -- I am not aware of a constitutional underpinning\nfor that, but certainly the practices in the courts are\nto permit partial verdicts.\nJUSTICE ALITO: In every State?\nMR. BUFFONE: I do not know the answer to\nthat question.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if the Constitution\ndoesn't require that, then why does the Constitution, in\nyour view, require that issue preclusion occur when the\njury acquits on certain counts but hangs on other\ncounts? If -- if a partial verdict were not required,\nand if the jury came back and said, we -- we've reached\na verdict on some counts but not all counts, the remedy\nwould be a mistrial on all counts and a retrial on all\ncounts.\nWhy -- why is it does the Constitution\nrequire a different result if Federal law or State law\nchooses to allow the return of a partial verdict?\nMR. BUFFONE: Your Honor, I don't believe\nthat it would be a different result because I think in\nmost jurisdictions, as I understand it, the reaction to\nthat kind of a split verdict would be to try to get the\njury to reach a full and final verdict, to give some\nform of an Allen charge to encourage additional\ndeliberations, to seek unanimity in the jury's verdict.\nWhere we don't have that unanimity, the Court is forced\nfor collateral estoppel, for issue preclusion purposes,\nto Justice Ginsburg's point, not to claim preclusion\nissues.\nIf we set aside claim preclusion, the Perez\nline of cases tells us to do what we do with claim\npreclusion. For issue preclusion, the question is, is\nthere some finality to what the jury did, in your\nhypothetical its partial verdict that speaks to the\ncounts that it was not able to resolve. And if it\nspeaks, that after the Ashe analysis that there was an\nissue necessarily decided, then there is a bar under the\ndoctrine of issue preclusion to the re-litigation of\nthat question.\nIf there are no further questions, I would\nlike to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Dreeben.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nTwo separate lines of double jeopardy\nanalysis lead to the conclusion that the government can\nretry hung counts that occur in a verdict simultaneously\nwith acquittals. The first is the principle that the\ngovernment may, under the doctrine of continuing\njeopardy, try to obtain a verdict when a jury is hung.\nThe basic principle there is that the government is\nentitled to one full and fair opportunity to convict and\nthat the hung counts, when the jury cannot agree,\ninterrupt and prevent the government from achieving\nthat. Double jeopardy therefore does not bar the\ngovernment from completing its opportunity to obtain a\nverdict.\nThe second doctrinal line is that which\ngrows out of the Powell case. Collateral estoppel is\npremised on the idea that the jury has acted rationally.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You are asking us\nfor a pretty dramatic extension of Powell. Powell is\nnot a case involving subsequent prosecutions.\nMR. DREEBEN: No. Powell was a case in\nwhich the Court rejected the doctrine of collateral\nestoppel as a means of upsetting a mixed verdict of\nacquittals and convictions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's because\nin the same proceeding you have two different jury\nverdicts, one going the other way and one -- obviously,\none way and one the other way. So to protect the jury's\nconclusions, you couldn't give effect to one without\nundermining the other.\nIt's a very different case here. The only\njury determination you have is the acquittal. If you\ngive effect -- if you don't give effect to the findings\nin the acquittal, you are undermining the jury, the only\ndetermination by the jury.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I don't think that it\nundermines that determination, Mr. Chief Justice,\nbecause the acquittals will stand as acquittals, and\nthey will bar reprosecution on that offense. To the\nextent that there are determinations that are made by\nthe acquittals that are independent of any inconsistency\nwith the hung counts, that too can have collateral\nestoppel effect in a successive prosecution.\nBut I think the crucial thing here is that\nthis is not properly viewed as a successive prosecution\nfor double jeopardy purposes. Ashe v. Swenson and the\ncases --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, why not? It is a\nsuccessive prosecution.\nMR. DREEBEN: No, it is not in the sense, I\nthink, Justice Stevens that the Court used that in Ashe.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It is in the sense of an\nindictment that took place after the other acquittal.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, that indictment simply\nembodies non-jeopardy-barred counts that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't there a difference\nin the fact that in the first case where there was a\nconflicting simultaneous verdict, one can explain the\nacquittal on grounds of leniency or compromise or\nsomething like that, that says that, therefore, we will\ngive effect to the -- the conviction when they're\nsimultaneous because of the reasons why there may be\nirrationality in the conflict. But there is no reason\nto doubt the -- the validity of the acquittal in this\ncase.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, no, I think that there\nis, Justice Stevens, if on the theory that the\nPetitioner propounds the verdict on the acquittals is\ninconsistent with the mistrial. And that's the only way\nin which collateral estoppel could apply, only if the\njury had necessarily determined a fact on the acquittals\nthat should have led to acquittals on the insider\ntrading counts.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But if they had time. And\nwhen you have 150 counts, it's entirely possible they\njust didn't reach a decision on it.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I -- Petitioner's theory\nwould be identical if there were one insider trading\ncount. And I think that for purposes of this case, the\nCourt should not get too distracted by the number of\ncounts, because all of the insider trading counts turned\non a common core of fact. They were all resolved\nidentically --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: When you have a case in\nwhich there is no conflict between a guilty and an\ninnocent verdict, there isn't -- there is no reason to\ndoubt the integrity of the acquittal.\nMR. DREEBEN: We're not questioning the\nintegrity of the acquittal as far as it has direct\ndouble jeopardy application. The question is whether\nthe doctrine of collateral estoppel ought to be applied.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And why not? Because the\nanswer to my question was exactly what Justice Stevens\nsaid. Why is it that -- that if you could have the\ninconsistent verdicts in Powell, well, then, why can't,\nsince they hung, couldn't you try him again on the hung\ncount? And the answer is, because you're trying him\nagain.\nAnd that's why we have all the briefs that\nwe have, because the only way to answer this is to look\nand see if the policies that underlie the collateral\nestoppel part of double jeopardy apply here. And I\ncan't think of one that doesn't. I can't think of one\nsingle one that wouldn't apply.\nMaybe there are some. And I can't think of\nany reason for allowing the government to have a second\nbite at this apple. What is the reason?\nMR. DREEBEN: The reason, Justice Breyer, is\nthat the hung counts do not constitute a resolution in\nfavor of the defendant.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Of course they don't. Of\ncourse they don't. Suppose that they never brought up\nthat hung count. Then you wouldn't even have the first\nbite at the apple. So you would think it would be a\nfortiori you could go ahead. But that's the case; you\nclearly can't go ahead.\nMR. DREEBEN: But there's a reason for that,\nJustice Breyer, that is grounded in double jeopardy\npolicies. And I think it goes to the question that\nJustice Souter asked as well, why the Court should\nprefer the double jeopardy doctrine that allows the\ngovernment to retry the hung counts when they are all\nbrought together in the same proceeding? And that is\nthis -- and I think it's made most vivid by imagining\nAshe v. Swenson in a slightly different posture.\nAshe v. Swenson involved robbery of six\nindividuals at a poker game. The government indicted\neach one of them as a separate robbery and the\ngovernment tried one of them first. And in that one,\nthe jury's acquittal was understood to mean that the\ndefendant was not the robber. If the government could\ngo sequentially through and try the other five, it has\nthe opportunity to try to wear the defendant down or\nrefine its case or improve its case in a way that the\nCourt regarded as impermissible.\nBut suppose that in Ashe the government\nhadn't done that, it had brought all six robbery\nprosecutions together, and the jury returned one verdict\nof acquittal on one robber and on the other five it\nhung? In that situation I think -- which is the\nsituation we have here --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the reason for that is\nthere are doubts about the integrity of the acquittal.\nThey probably compromised, just to say not to be too\ntough on --\nMR. DREEBEN: But, Justice Stevens, that is\nidentical to this case. There is no difference to this\ncase --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, here you have\nsequential prosecutions, and there is no reason to\nquestion the integrity of the acquittal in this case.\nMR. DREEBEN: No. But, Justice Stevens, if\nyou would question the integrity of the acquittal, if\nthe jury acquits on one robber and hangs on five, that\nis this case. The only difference in this case is it's\na securities fraud case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I didn't think it had\nanything to do with integrity of anything. I thought\nwhat it had to do with is that they are being tried at\nthe same time. And to test that out in my mind, I\nimagine this. In February we try the individual for the\ndrug count, he's acquitted. In June we bring a\ntelephone count. Absolutely forbidden, right?\nMR. DREEBEN: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So why should the\ngovernment be one whit better off because, in addition\nto doing that, they happened to bring a telephone count\nin January along with the other?\nMR. DREEBEN: There are two reasons for\nthat, Justice Breyer. The first is that the Double\nJeopardy Clause is not aimed at preventing the\ngovernment from attempting to bring its -- all of its\ncharges in one indictment against the defendant. What\nthe collateral estoppel component is aimed at is the\ngovernment going sequentially, carving its prosecution\nup into pieces, and trying in different attempts.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But -- isn't -- isn't the\nreal problem that you raised by your answer the\nfollowing problem: That in this age in which there are,\nas Justice Breyer's hypo suggests, lots of overlapping\ncriminal statutes -- you can indict not only for drugs\nbut for telephones, and I don't know what other\noverlapping crimes there -- there may be. Therefore,\nthat gives the government by joining a lot of\noverlapping charges or lots of charges with common\nelements in either one indictment through various counts\nor simply by a series of indictments to be tried\ntogether -- it gives the government a bigger chance of\ngetting a hung jury or some irrational resolution on\nsome of those issues. And if the government can bring\nloads of counts, increase the likelihood of getting a\nhung jury on one issue or one indictment, the government\nin effect has a key to avoiding just what Justice\nBreyer's hypothetical suggested.\nIf they wait and bring the second count in\nJune, there's an issue preclusion. But if they bring it\ntogether, they've got an irrational verdict and there's\nno issue preclusion. Therefore, isn't the policy behind\nboth double jeopardy and the issue preclusion extension\na policy that argues in favor of saying don't let the\ngovernment have all these bites at the apple, because in\nfact it results or can result in seriatim prosecutions?\nWhat's -- what's your response to that argument?\nMR. DREEBEN: My response to that, Justice\nSouter, is that double jeopardy has always consisted of\na balance of values. There is of course the interest\nthat Your Honor has identified, but the countervailing\ninterest is that the government should have one full and\nfair opportunity to convict a defendant on charges that\nhave been preferred by a grand jury on a showing of\nprobable cause, and that does not occur when the hung\ncounts deprive the government of that one opportunity.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But does the -- does the\ngovernment ask for something more than one fair chance\nwhen it comes in with 117 counts? Maybe the fair chance\nconsists of a fair chance with a number of counts or a\nnumber of indictments that one can reasonably expect a\n-- a jury to handle without either getting totally\nconfused or totally exhausted.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, let me -- let me give\ntwo answers to that, Justice Souter. First of all, the\nposition for which Petitioner argues does not depend on\nthe number of counts. If there had been two counts in\nthe indictment --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's right, I'm making an\nargument that he did not make.\nMR. DREEBEN: -- it would be the same.\nBut more fundamentally, I think that the\nnumber of counts in this indictment should not lead the\nCourt to think that this was a case in which the\ngovernment overcharged in some nefarious effort. First\nof all, nefarious efforts like that tend to backfire on\nthe government, and that's why sound prosecution policy\ndictates against overcharging. Here I don't think it's\nfair to regard the number of counts as a proxy for\novercharging, and that is because they break up into\nlogically distinct units.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why not, when considering\nwhat the government did on its second chance? It\ntrimmed 5 -- if there were 20 insider trading, on the\nnew indictment, there were 5. There were 99 counts of\nlaundering, which were trimmed to 8, something within\nthe jury's ken. But isn't the most likely thing in this\ncase that the jury was simply exhausted?\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't think so, Justice\nGinsburg, because all of the insider trading counts turn\non the same fact: did Petitioner have inside\ninformation, did he know that the Enron broadband system\nthat he was integrally involved in, was the strategic\nmanager in charge of, wasn't working? If he had that\nknowledge and he traded, the number of counts is really\nirrelevant, and I think that the fact that the jury\nresolved all of the insider trading counts the same way\nand the money laundering counts just had to do with the\ndisposition of the proceeds, they're all resolved the\nsame way.\nThe jury obviously deadlocked on whether\nsome fact that the government needed to prove for those\ncounts was established. And the bizarre thing, I think,\nabout Petitioner's position is that he seeks to get\nthrough a legal doctrine, collateral estoppel, which is\na big extension from what the Double Jeopardy Clause\ntextually prohibits, exactly what the jury would not\ngive him. The jury --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the -- the\npoint about the big extension, you were rather coy in\nyour brief about what you think about Ashe v. Swenson.\nAre you asking us to revisit that?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't\nthink that the Court needs to revisit Ashe v. Swenson in\norder to resolve this case, but I think it's fair to say\nthat Ashe v. Swenson is a doctrine that transposed\ncertain civil policies that are -- are expressed through\nthe doctrine of issue preclusion into the double\njeopardy context in a way that was not supported by the\nhistory of the Fifth Amendment and is not supported by\nthe text of the Double Jeopardy Clause, which requires\nthe same events.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you're not\ngoing to talk about -- you're not going to talk about\nthe text of the Double Jeopardy Clause, are you?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If we rely on that\nthe case is pretty easy, isn't it?\nMR. DREEBEN: I think that it is because it\nsays that the same offense is what you're protected\nagainst for double jeopardy, and the offenses in this\ncase are distinct under Blockburger. But my point\nabout --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The person was in\njeopardy on the hung offense as well.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, this Court has made\nclear that the jeopardy continues until the government\nhas the opportunity to obtain a verdict. So the fact\nthat his jeopardy began is not what entitles him to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under this Court's\ndecisions, but not under the text of the Double Jeopardy\nClause.\nMR. DREEBEN: I think it then becomes a\nquestion of what is the meaning of jeopardy. But\ninsofar as the Court imported collateral estoppel into\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause, it should keep in mind in\ndeciding whether to extend that doctrine that in the\ncivil context a crucial predicate for collateral\nestoppel is the ability of the adversely affected party\nto appeal, and that is because before we rely on\ncollateral estoppel, we want to have some assurances\nthat there actually is integrity to the necessarily\ndetermined fact that is going to preclude litigation in\nanother case.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the key to your\nargument is the government is entitled to one full and\nfair opportunity to try its case. It had that\nopportunity the first time around.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I think that this\nCourt's decisions since --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If there were no separate\ncounts, that would have been -- that would have been a\nfair -- that would be the end of the matter.\nMR. DREEBEN: Since 1824 this Court has\ndefined the government's full and fair opportunity to\ninclude the right to retry if the jury hangs, and here\nwhat the defendant --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it has -- but it has\nthe right to retry in the same position as it would have\nbeen if it had not brought the first proceeding. And if\nit had not brought the first proceeding in this case, it\nwould have been barred.\nMR. DREEBEN: No, I don't -- I don't agree\nthat it's in the same position --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why not?\nMR. DREEBEN: -- as if it had not bought it.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Oh.\nMR. DREEBEN: It's -- it -- in this case\nwhat the government did was to bring all of its cases\ntogether. And I return to the hypothetical about\nAshe v. Swenson because I think it strikes everyone as\nvery strange to say that if the jury in Ashe v. Swenson\nhad been presented with all six robbers and had\nacquitted on only one and had a returned -- you know, an\ninability to reach a verdict --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's why we have the\nDunn doctrine, which itself is questionable. It\nbasically says there is a certain situation in which we\nwill tolerate what may be an irrational verdict, and the\nreason we tolerate it is that the acquittal itself may\nbe explained on other grounds. Namely --\nMR. DREEBEN: I'm not relying on Dunn in\nthis hypothetical. I'm presupposing that the jury hung\nwith respect to the other five robbers. And all the\ngovernment would come back and say is: For two separate\nreasons, we should be able to retry those counts against\nthe other five robbers. One is that when there is a\nhung jury it's settled double jeopardy law that the\ngovernment has an opportunity to retry; and the other is\nif you accept the proposition that the jury's action was\ninconsistent because one of the robbers earned an\nacquittal and the other five logically should have been\nthe same if the jury had found that the defendant wasn't\nthe robber, the jury was unable to return a verdict.\nCollateral estoppel depends on the idea that\nthere is a rational jury, and if the jury has acted\ninconsistently, we don't have that basis of rationality\nthat supports the policy justifications of collateral\nestoppel.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the whole -- whole\ndoctrine of inconsistent verdicts depends on the\nassumption that what appears to be an irrational\ninconsistency may have another explanation.\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, such as lenity for the\ndefendant. The government doesn't get the opportunity\nto appeal an acquittal. The government doesn't get the\nopportunity to go behind the acquittal and ask whether\nthe jury acted rationally. All of things -- those\nthings are true in civil cases where the doctrine of\nissue preclusion applies.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Start the other side, which\nI think Justice Stevens was suggesting. Assume that\nthere was only one trial on the substantive count in\nJanuary. Now each -- he's acquitted. Now you decide to\nindict him in July on the telephone count. You argue to\nthe judge: Judge, there shouldn't be double jeopardy\nhere because maybe the jury just acquitted him the first\ntime because they were lenient. Maybe they liked his\nlooks. Maybe they were distracted by a fly. Maybe they\nwere, maybe they were -- and we didn't even get an\nappeal. Are you going to win that case?\nMR. DREEBEN: Not under --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, not even a close.\nOkay. Not even close.\nNow, since you're going to lose that case, I\ngrant you there's thousands of case talking about your\nability to bring more cases if you have a hung jury. I\nconcede all those. None of them talks about double\njeopardy, to my knowledge.\nSo we're back to the hypothetical. You've\nlost your case. Now, all that you did to turn that case\ninto a winning case was you also indicted him on the\ntelephone count in January. Now, that was my question\nthe first time, and you began to have two answers. I\njust didn't see why the government should be any better\noff because they also indicted him in January. Given\nthe language \"double jeopardy,\" you might think the\ngovernment, if anything, should be worse off, but let's\nkeep them neutral.\nSo what is the reason that the government\nshould be worse off because they indicted him in January\non the telephone count as well as in June?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, the government should\nnot be worse off.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no -- better. I\nmisspoke.\nMR. DREEBEN: I think the reason is that\nwhen, Justice Breyer, you said double jeopardy is not\ninvolved in the cases involving the government's ability\nto retry on a hung count, that's not accurate. The\nCourt has regarded the doctrine of double jeopardy as a\nbalance of policies, and one of the fundamental policies\nis when the jury cannot agree, the government has the\nright to retry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think that's\nright, and your argument depends upon that interest\nbalancing against the interest in giving effect to the\nacquittal verdict.\nNow, what if I think, under the Seventh\nAmendment that's -- that what is important is protecting\njury verdicts? And the interest in the irrational case,\nwhen you have a conviction and acquittal, is that you\nhave two jury verdicts and you can't go one way or the\nother without undermining one of them. Here, however,\nyou can give full effect to the verdict of acquittal\nwithout undermining another jury verdict. You certainly\nundermine the government's interest in prosecuting after\na hung jury, but if I think what's important under the\nSeventh Amendment is the jury verdicts, then the case\ncomes out the other way, right?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I don't think so, Mr.\nChief Justice, because I think you still have to focus\non the intrinsic character of the doctrine of issue\npreclusion, which does depend on a rational jury. Let's\napply it to the facts of this case, because there is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you qualify it in\nyour statement of the facts. Is there any insider\ninformation with relation to the insider information\ncharges that is different in any respect from the\ninsider information in connection with the substantive\nchallenge?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, Justice Ginsburg, there is\nnot. The government's theory here was that on the\nsubstantive securities fraud count, which related to the\nJanuary 20th, 2000, analysts meeting, Mr. Yeager was\nintegrally involved in formulating the message and was\ntherefore accountable for misstatements to the\nmarketplace about Enron broadband communications\nefficacy and effectiveness and technological value. The\njury, if it rejected that, would acquit on those counts\n-- on that count, without reaching the question did Mr.\nYeager know factually that the statements that were made\nby others at that analysts conference and in the press\nreleases subsequently were inaccurate? If the answer to\nthat question is yes, he had the information, then he\ncould be liable for insider trading even though he is\nnot liable for substantive securities fraud because he\nhad nothing to do with creating the statements or\nmisstatements to the marketplace.\nAnd I think I do take issue with\nPetitioner's suggestion that the theory of this case was\nan omissions theory. The way that Mr. Yeager argued the\ncase to the jury was that I didn't have any involvement\nin preparing or making statements at that January 20th\nanalysts conference; you can't convict me of what other\npeople may have said. And the jury instructions advised\nthe jury that it had to find that he participated in the\nscheme and that he either made the statements or caused\nthe statements or omissions to be made. If it rejected\nthat, it easily acquits on the securities fraud. And as\na result even if this Court were inclined to apply\ncollateral estoppel across mixed counts in a verdict of\nacquittals and hung counts, which we submit it should\nnot do, the defendant still has to carry his burden of\nshowing necessarily that the jury resolved an issue of\nfact in his favor that would preclude the next\nprosecution.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, he -- he\ncarried that burden before the court of appeals.\nMR. DREEBEN: But the court of appeals\nrelied on the view that Mr. Yeager did not contest that\nhe participated in the planning and preparation and\nstatements that were made.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Revisiting of that\nissue was not included within the question presented.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I think it's included in\nour ability to defend the judgment. The District Court\nin this case made it quite clear that collateral\nestoppel did not apply because the acquittals could rest\non the basis that Mr. Yeager did not participate in the\nanalysts conference and in the press statements that\nwere the basis for the wire fraud and the securities\nfraud omissions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if we -- if we\nagree with you on that proposition, then the conflict\nthat we granted cert to resolve would still continue.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, you could resolve it. I\nwould hope that you would resolve it in a favor of a\ndisposition that doesn't require you to reach the\nfactual issue, but if the Court resolves the legal issue\nagainst us, I think it should revisit the analysis of\nthe court of appeals because government isn't defending\nthe precise way in which the court of appeals went about\nanalyzing the double jeopardy issue, and its question of\nwhat facts were necessarily determined was resolved\nincorrectly, I think, as a matter of clear error. I\ndon't even think Mr. Yeager will stand up on rebuttal\nand tell you that he didn't argue to the jury that his\nclient was not involved in -- in the creation of the\nstatements at that analyst meeting because he did make\nthat argument.\nAnd I do think that it's important that if\nthe Court is going to go down a track of allowing\ncollateral estoppel for mixed verdicts, that it\nencourage rigor in the way that courts determine whether\na fact was necessarily decided by the jury.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, on that first\ntheory, and your theory that a retrial on hung counts is\nalways permitted, I -- I take it there are no court of\nappeals opinions or decisions that agree with you on\nthat point, or am I incorrect?\nMR. DREEBEN: They have not reasoned it the\nway that the government reasons it, but I think that the\nFifth Circuit's result is equivalent to what the\ngovernment argued as well as the D.C. Circuit.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: A different question:\nSuppose you prevail. The hung counts are retried. And\nthe jury hangs again and the jury hangs a second time.\nIs there any point at which the district court can\nintervene in the exercise of its own authority and\ndiscretion just to dismiss the charges?\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't think so, Justice\nKennedy, because I think the interest that's being\nvindicated here is a balance of interests, and it's --\nas I responded to the Chief Justice and -- and referred\nto Justice Souter's question earlier, double jeopardy\nhas never been a jurisprudence of black and white. You\ncould you read the clause as saying one trial for a\ndefendant. If the defendant is -- doesn't get a\nconviction at that trial, game over. But the Court has\nnever done that because the double jeopardy clause has\nalways involved a balance of the society's very\nimportant interests in having the opportunity for a\ndecision up or down on whether a defendant is guilty.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Then the government can\ntry year after year to get a conviction and were the\ndefendant down? Nothing the Court can do so long as\nthere's a hung jury?\nMR. DREEBEN: If the -- if the jury hangs,\nthe government can retry, and there have been cases\nwhere --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that the rule in all of\nthe States? Don't some States give authority to the\njudges to say, enough is enough?\nMR. DREEBEN: I am not aware whether any\nStates do, but certainly as a matter of double jeopardy,\nthis Court has never suggested that there is. I think\nas a matter of common sense, prosecutors who are unable\nto achieve a verdict after a certain number of trials do\ntend to conclude that it's not in the interest of\nsociety to keep trying. But certainly one hung jury\nfollowed by a retrial is customary rather than an\nexception to the rule, and the reason why that's --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But one hung jury followed\nby a second when there has been an acquittal the first\ntime around is not customary.\nMR. DREEBEN: But the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So the difference is in\nthe -- in the first trial, you're not impugning the\nintegrity of the jury's verdict. You're following the\nacquittal, and that's true in the compromise cases, the\nDunn case and those cases, but that's not the case here\nbecause you're talking about two different juries.\nYou're saying the second jury should have an -- an\nopportunity to correct what the first jury did, even\nthough it would not have that opportunity if the first\njury had not faced the issue.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I -- I -- Justice\nStevens, all I can say is that if the first jury had\nreally believed that Mr. Yeager acted in good faith and\nwas completely innocent, it should have acquitted on all\ncounts.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It should have, but it\ndidn't. We know that. And we just know they did not\nreach a conclusion on this issue, but they did reach a\nconclusion on the count on which they acquitted.\nMR. DREEBEN: We should have -- we should\npresume that, as we do in other areas of the law, that\nthe jury followed the instructions that it was given,\nand the instructions that it was given --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you make the same\npresumption when there is an inconsistent verdict, but\nyou say even if it's irrational we'll go along with it\nbecause of the one jury, and they may have had non --\nunsound legal reasons for saying, well, we'll let the\nguy off on the one count.\nMR. DREEBEN: But I think that there is no\nreason for the fact that a jury takes irrational action\nto then be used for the jury's acquittal to block\ncomplete prosecution.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The jury did not take\nirrational action in this case. The only action --\nthat's relevant was the acquittal. The other they\ndidn't act.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, they acted irrationally\nin the sense that if a fact necessarily determined\nacquittals on the -- on the insider trading counts --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It would be irrational if\nthey had returned a verdict, but they said we can't\nagree for who knows why.\nMR. DREEBEN: But the point is they should\nhave agreed logically if they believed that Mr. Yeager\nnever had inside information or acted in good faith.\nAnd the jury is instructed to consider each count, count\nby count, it was given instructions at the Allen phase\nof the case that it should strive to achieve a verdict,\nthat Mr. Yeager is entitled to a verdict of not guilty\nif, in fact, the jury believes that he is not guilty and\nthat it should make every effort to reach the verdict.\nNow, the fact that it didn't, and it would\nhave been very easy for it to do, if it had determined\nlogically that he did not have inside information, is a\nreason for hesitating before extrapolating out from\nthose acquittals and blocking the government's\nopportunity to retry the hung counts.\nMr. Yeager's position logically --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It's not all that clear,\nbecause as you argue the court -- the district court was\ncorrect in analyzing the -- the estoppel issue. And\nit's obviously a very difficult issue because judges\nhave disagreed about it and the government and your\nopponent disagree on it. So, it's entirely possible\nthat the jury wasn't able to figure it all out.\nMR. DREEBEN: I -- I don't think it is that\ndifficult of an issue. I think the district court which\nwas closer to it, which had presided over the trial and\nwhich read the closing arguments, made findings that\nmake it quite clear what Mr. Yeager argued and how those\narguments were totally consistent --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The jury could not have\nbeen as confused as the court of appeals was.\nMR. DREEBEN: I'm not sure that --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DREEBEN: If the jury was confused and\nit acted in an irrational manner, that's a reason not to\napply collateral estoppel, not a reason to do it. What\nMr. Yeager's theory implies is that if the jury had come\nback and -- under the Federal Rules of Criminal\nProcedure it can return partial verdicts. If the jury\nhad come back and said we're struggling on some of the\ncounts, we have a partial verdict on others of them, and\nthe judge said, okay, we'll take the partial verdict;\nand the jury came in and said, we acquit on five counts,\nthat Mr. Yeager's theory would be that the judge should\nsay that's great, collateral estoppel now means you\ndon't get to finish the deliberations on the counts on\nwhich you said you can't agree. And that result makes\nno sense, neither does blocking retrial in this case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your -- your theory\ndepends upon viewing a hung jury as constituting some\naction by the jury. Now, obviously it does in some\nsense.\nBut if you view -- if you accept the\nproposition that juries only act by returning verdicts,\nand that's the reason you can retry, because with a hung\njury the jury hasn't really done anything in the way\njurors act, then the case comes out -- then the\ndefendant prevails, right?\nMR. DREEBEN: I assume I can answer your\nquestion, Mr. Chief Justice?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. DREEBEN: No, because the -- the logic\nof the situation here is that in order for collateral\nestoppel to apply, there needs to be a rational jury\nverdict. And Ashe versus Swenson tells us that in\nattempting to decide what the jury rationally resolved,\nwe look at all evidence in the record, not just some.\nSo it isn't necessary to treat the jury's\nhung counts as if they are verdicts of a sort. They\nsimply are data which show that if the jury had been\nrational and it had resolved a fact in favor of the\ndefendant that was necessary for the government to prove\non the other counts, it would have resolved those as\nacquittals as well. And once you take into account that\ntotal record, the doctrine of collateral estoppel with\nits premise of rationality cannot be applied.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Buffone, you have six minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL J. BUFFONE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BUFFONE: The Solicitor General has\nessentially asked this Court to take a metaphysical view\nof the Double Jeopardy Clause, but the teachings of this\nCourt from Sealfon through Ashe is that the important\nprotections of the Double Jeopardy Clause as applied to\nissue preclusion must be approached with reason, with\nrationality, with a non-hypertechnical view in order to\nprotect the public policies that underlie the Double\nJeopardy Clause. And that is quite simply that what\nhappened here should not occur. That a defendant should\nnot be forced to relitigate before a second jury an\nissue that was necessarily decided.\nI sat through and argued through\n13-and-a-half-week jury trial. A reasonable and\nrational explanation of what occurred there is that we\nhad a conscientious jury that followed its instructions,\nthat tried to reach through a complex 176-count\nindictment, and they simply were not able to. They\nspoke the community will, and they spoke it forcefully\nin their acquittals. Six of them.\nAnd the only conclusion that can be reached\nfrom those acquittals is that Mr. Yeager did not possess\ninsider information.\nAt the beginning of this trial we filed two\nmotions, the first challenging the specificity of the\nindictment, and the second seeking a Bill of\nParticulars. The district court answered both with the\nsame answer. The insider information that Mr. Yeager is\ncharged with possessing in the insider trader counts is\nthe false statements made by others at the 2000 Analysts\nConference.\nThe omissions theory was not as the\nSolicitor General submits, some afterthought. It was\ncore to the government's prosecution and it was core to\nthe case. The jury decided that the omissions theory\nwas not a basis to convict on the six counts that it\nacquitted. It determined that Mr. Yeager did not\npossess that information. And Mr. Yeager is entitled to\nthe benefits of those acquittals. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
