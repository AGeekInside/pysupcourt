        "content": "(11:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in No. 99-1786, Great-West Life & Annuity Insurance\nCompany v. Janette Knudson.\nMr. Jorden.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES F. JORDEN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. JORDEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nPetitioners' claim for injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief to enforce the terms of the\nreimbursement clause in the benefit plan at issue in this\ncase falls squarely within the language of ERISA, section\n502(a)(3)(A), which appears in full text at page 13 of our\nbrief, which provides for a civil action by a fiduciary to\nenjoin any act or practice which violates the terms of the\nplan.\nIn its first amended complaint, Great-West\nsought injunctive and declaratory relief prior to the time\nany of the funds were disbursed in this matter in the\nState court proceeding. It sought injunctive relief and\nother appropriate equitable relief to enforce the terms of\nthe employee benefit plan.\nQUESTION: Now, you say to enjoy any act or --\ndo you think that includes to enjoin your refusing to pay\nme money that you owe me? Because it doesn't just say to\nenjoin. It says, to enjoin any act or practice, or (B) to\nobtain other -- other -- appropriate equitable relief.\nSo, I -- you know, I take that to mean an injunction that\nis a normal equitable injunction, an injunction -- an\ninjunction that is equitable relief. And -- and that puts\nthe burden on you to -- to show that refusing to pay me\nmoney that you owe me can be enjoined in equity, which I\ndon't think it can.\nMR. JORDEN: Well, Your Honor, we believe that\nthe language and the structure and the purpose of ERISA\nsupport the proposition that section 502(a)(3)(A),\nspecifically in this case (a)(3)(A), to enjoin the\nKnudsons from disbursing funds as to which they had power\nto determine --\nQUESTION: Well, if you want to talk about\npurpose, I frankly don't see why it is in accord with the\npurpose to limit the relief to equitable relief.\nMR. JORDEN: Well, Your Honor, we believe it is\nequitable relief.\nQUESTION: You know, if the only way to get the\nrelief is at law, the purpose of the act would -- would\nallow you to get relief at -- at law. But -- but the act\nchose not to go that far. It just says, you know, to\nenjoin any act or to obtain other appropriate equitable\nrelief.\nSo, you don't think the injunction portion, to\nenjoin any act or practice, refers to normal equitable\ninjunction. It could be -- it's a type of injunction that\nwould not have been available in equity.\nMR. JORDEN: Well, Your Honor, two things.\nFirst, I believe in this case on these facts the\ninjunction was a typical injunction. Prior to the time\nactions were taken by the Knudsons to disburse any of the\nfunds from -- from Hyundai, an injunction was sought\nagainst them to prevent them from disbursing those funds\nuntil the Federal claim under 502(a)(3) --\nQUESTION: Why isn't that clearly wrong? I\nmean, if you have an adequate remedy at law, I don't think\nyou can issue an injunction. What's wrong with the\nperfectly adequate remedy, that you go bring a suit under\nState law? You attach the asset, and if you win, you get\nthe money. What's inadequate about that?\nMR. JORDEN: Two points on that, Your Honor.\nFirst -- first is that if you're assuming that there's an\nadequate remedy at law --\nQUESTION: I didn't assume it. I want you -- I\nsay why isn't it an adequate remedy at law. And if it is\nan adequate remedy at law, why isn't that the end of this\ncase?\nMR. JORDEN: Well, one would have to presume\nthat we were seeking money damages in this case.\nQUESTION: You could go into a court of equity\nin the year 1750 where they really knew equity --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: -- and I guess that they would have\nsaid, I'm not going to issue you the injunction that you\nhappened to get here because you have an adequate remedy\nat law. And -- and as I read this, I can't get over in my\nmind that there is an adequate remedy at law. That's why\nI asked you the question. I'm trying to get your answer.\nMR. JORDEN: In fact, Your Honor, the concept of\na constructive trust, which is -- which is employed by\nmany of the lower courts, the courts of appeals, to\nenforce these reimbursement causes --\nQUESTION: Well, I know many constructive -- I'm\ngoing to stop you because -- right where you're going.\nI've found many cases where you impose a constructive\ntrust on funds that go out of the trust and you trace\nthose funds. But I can't find the case -- and you may be\nable to get me one -- where you impose a constructive\ntrust on money that never originated from a trust that has\nnothing to do with this. Now, maybe if you -- so, in your\nanswer right now, maybe you can cite me that case.\nMR. JORDEN: Judge Posner -- Judge Posner in\nHealth Cost Controls, Your Honor, v. Washington held that\na constructive trust was a proper remedy in this context.\nAnd indeed, at common law, a -- in imposing a constructive\ntrust, courts of equity decided -- concluded, because\nafter all, a constructive trust was essentially imploding\nlegal remedies because the person attempting to -- to\nimpose the constructive trust did not have legal title to\nthe property, therefore courts of equity had to step in\nand impose an equitable remedy.\nQUESTION: What you -- what you sought here, Mr.\nJorden, was an injunction, I take it.\nMR. JORDEN: That is correct, Your Honor, and\nthat is precisely within the language --\nQUESTION: Yes, and I want to ask you some\ndetail about the injunction that was granted.\nWas it simply an injunction that required the\nrespondent here to hold onto the funds, or was it an -- an\ninjunction against their refusing to pay the funds to you?\nMR. JORDEN: We sought an -- an injunction at\nseveral levels, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Yes. Which one was finally issued?\nMR. JORDEN: None, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Well --\nMR. JORDEN: No injunction was issued. No\ninjunction was issued. The injunction was denied by the\ndistrict court.\nQUESTION: And -- excuse me.\nQUESTION: And what -- what were the terms of\nthe injunction which you sought?\nMR. JORDEN: We sought an injunction either to\n-- for the Federal court to enjoin the State court\nproceeding from -- from the second -- from enforcing that\nsettlement or to enjoin the Knudsons, the respondents in\nthis case, from disbursing the funds that were ultimately\npaid out in that settlement or from directing parties who\nreceived those funds from disbursing those funds.\nQUESTION: But you didn't seek an injunction\nagainst them for refusing to pay you the funds?\nMR. JORDEN: Well, as a part of the mandatory\ninjunction, the language of the mandatory injunction that\nwas sought, Your Honor, was to pay the plan the $411,000\nthat the Knudsons, unjustly enriched, owed back to the\nplan.\nQUESTION: Well, supposing that you have a claim\nagainst somebody for $1,000 because you painted their\nhouse, could you go into court and get an injunction\nagainst them refusing to pay the claim to you?\nMR. JORDEN: Well, Your Honor, the concept of\nspecific performance for the payment -- for the\nenforcement of an obligation is definitely an equitable\nconcept. And as this Court in Bowen determined, when you\nare seeking to enforce against someone that they -- that\nthey carry out the very obligation that, either under a\nstatute or under the terms of a plan, they're obliged to\ncarry out, as was the case in Bowen, the fact that money\nmight ultimately be paid does not make that money damages.\nThat's still specific relief.\nQUESTION: Okay. That doesn't -- that doesn't\nrule out equity.\nBut take the case -- I was going to ask you a\nquestion similar to the Chief Justice's. Let's assume\nsomeone has signed a promissory note, and on the date the\npromissory note becomes due, the individual is entitled to\nan inheritance under a probate court decree. Would equity\ngrant an injunction at the behest of the noteholder\nagainst using the inheritance for any purpose other than\npaying the note? I would have thought not. And that\nseems to be very similar to the situation that you're in\nhere.\nMR. JORDEN: It is not clear to me if equity\nwould have done that, Your Honor.\nBut I will say this. If Congress decided in\n502(a)(3) to permit fiduciaries to enforce the terms of a\nplan, they -- they cited in 502(a)(3)(A) the authority to\nseek injunctions to enforce the terms of the plan. It is\nclear that at common law injunctions were equitable in\nnature. The fact that in a later portion of 502(a)(3) it\nrefers to other appropriate equitable relief, it seems to\nus, simply reinforces the notion that fiduciaries -- first\nof all, fiduciaries have an obligation --\nQUESTION: So, you're, in effect, saying that\n(B) -- the reference to equity in (B) does not limit the\nbreadth of the authority in (A). That's your real\nargument, isn't it?\nMR. JORDEN: That's part of our argument, Your\nHonor. It is absolutely.\nSection 404(a) of ERISA obligates fiduciaries to\nenforce the terms of the plan. It's one of their\nobligations.\nQUESTION: And is -- is that --\nMR. JORDEN: It's hard to --\nQUESTION: Is that argument based on the\nassumption that if a legislature increases the injunctive\nauthority of a court by statute, that injunctive authority\nis still equitable?\nMR. JORDEN: Your Honor, since I understand --\nQUESTION: If you think it would -- I think you\nwould want to say --\nMR. JORDEN: -- that the Congress cannot --\ncannot simply grant injunctive authority and call it\nequitable. However, it is quite clear --\nQUESTION: Yes, but --\nMR. JORDEN: -- that enforcing the terms of a\ntrust are equitable.\nQUESTION: I -- I thought you would answer yes\nbecause it seems to me that helps you. I -- I --\nMR. JORDEN: Well, I think --\nQUESTION: I would assume that a legislature, if\nit's a State court -- or the Congress, if it's a Federal\ncourt -- can say the injunctive power extends beyond what\nwas traditionally equity to A, B, and C and that you could\nstill call it fairly equitable.\nMR. JORDEN: Oh, yes, Your Honor. That is true.\nAbsolutely.\nQUESTION: And -- and in this case it was in\nconjunction with declaratory relief I thought. Have we\never said that declaratory relief is equitable or --\nMR. JORDEN: Is equitable in nature? I don't\nknow, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Isn't it clear that declaratory\nrelief is neuter? That is, you can have a declaratory\nrelief, I -- X owes Y X amount of money. That's the\ndeclaration. A declaratory judgment can be either,\ndepending upon what else you ask for.\nMR. JORDEN: Well --\nQUESTION: What else you could ask for.\nMR. JORDEN: That's correct, Your Honor. A\ndeclaratory relief can be both. The declaratory relief\nhere clearly would be equitable in nature because it's\nenforcing the terms of a plan. The Congress --\nQUESTION: You talk about injunction and\nspecific performance. The one word that I haven't heard\nfrom you yet -- and I'm surprised I haven't -- is\nrestitution.\nMR. JORDEN: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: That this is what you're seeking is\nto get back, to recoup what's owed the plan from this\nlarger pot.\nMR. JORDEN: We are seeking restitution, which\nis clearly an equitable remedy, which was recognized by\nthis Court's decision in Mertens as an equitable remedy\nand -- and reconfirmed in the more recent decision --\nQUESTION: Mr. Jorden, may I ask --\nMR. JORDEN: -- of Harris Trust.\nQUESTION: -- a question not quite along these\nlines of whether you properly sought an injunction, but\nacknowledging that you did seek an injunction and it was\nrefused? And as I understand it, the Federal court, the\ndistrict court, refused in part because the petitioner,\nGreat-West, said that it only had a right to that part of\nthe settlement allocated to past medical expenses and that\nonly $13,828 was allocated to past medical expenses. That\nwas part of the reasoning in the denial.\nMR. JORDEN: That is correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And -- and as I understand it, Great-\nWest did not appeal from that. I mean, it just -- you've\naccepted that apparently.\nMR. JORDEN: No, Your Honor. Great-West --\nQUESTION: There was no appeal, was there?\nMR. JORDEN: Yes, Your Honor. There was --\nthere was a -- that case, the pending case -- a summary\njudgment motion was filed by Great-West seeking the\nFederal court, notwithstanding the judgment in the State\ncourt -- of course, Great-West was not a party to the\nState court proceeding, Your Honor. The Federal court\nproceeding -- the summary judgment motion was filed\nseeking the reimbursement claim, the restitution amount.\nThe district court denied that, and that case was appealed\nto the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit said we don't\nhave jurisdiction because you're seeking money.\nAnd -- and our position is, first, we were\nseeking an injunction. That gave the Federal district\ncourt jurisdiction. That gave -- that gave a cause of\naction which they could consider under 502(a)(3)(A). And\nbeyond that, we're seeking restitution for the balance of\nthe money that is owed the plan based on the unjust\nenrichment of the --\nQUESTION: Why was it that Great-West didn't\nintervene in the State suit? Certainly it knew about it.\nMR. JORDEN: Yes, it did.\nQUESTION: Or try to subrogate the claims some\nway?\nMR. JORDEN: Well, that goes to the question of\nwhether Great-West -- Great-West had no obligation to\nintervene. In -- in some cases, in fact, in Jefferson-\nPilot v. Krafka, which is -- which appears at page 29 of\nour -- of our brief, in the footnote 11 -- State courts\nhave no jurisdiction to construe the terms of an ERISA\nplan except under section 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA which\nallows a participant to bring a claim for benefits.\nNow, if the participant had wanted, as the\nCourt-appointed amicus brief argues that this should have\nall been decided in one court -- if the participant had\nwanted to have this decided in State court, they could\nhave brought Great-West in by alleging a claim under\n502(a)(1)(B).\nNow, the State court would have had concurrent\njurisdiction. That is the only place in ERISA which gives\nState courts jurisdiction to construe the terms of a plan.\nBearing that in mind, Justice O'Connor, if\nGreat-West were to intervene, it would be asking the State\ncourt to construe the terms of the plan to determine the\nstatus of its restitution rights.\nQUESTION: May I just interrupt you? I'm not\nquite clear on that. Why do you have to construe the\nplan? It seems to me the plan is perfectly clear. You're\nenforcing the plan. You're not construing it.\nMR. JORDEN: Well, I think, Your Honor, if you\nlook at the -- at the district court's decision, which --\nexcuse me -- the State court decision, joint appendix 143,\nthe State court makes very clear that it is in the process\nof making its decision reviewing -- it calls it the health\ninsurance policy. It's not really that -- reviewing the\nterms of the plan and construing the terms of the plan for\nthe purpose of determining what's the appropriate\nrestitution, what's the appropriate reimbursement.\nOur position is the State court had no\njurisdiction to do that unless they were doing so under a\nclaim brought by the respondents under 502(a)(1)(B), in\nwhich case, of course, we could have removed that to\nFederal court.\nNot having done so, we also don't have a right\nto go into State court and ask the State court to construe\nthat.\nNow, one of the reasons why 502(a)(3) has to\ngive us a right to enforce the terms of the plan is\nbecause we know the beneficiary has a right to do that.\nUnder 502(a)(1)(B), it can go into State court or Federal\ncourt and enforce the terms of a plan, including to get\nbenefits and money.\nSecond, we ought to be able to go into a Federal\ncourt and enforce the terms of the plan. And the fact\nthat we get money shouldn't preclude us from doing that.\nAnd finally, Congress requires us to go in and\nenforce the terms of a plan under 404. And indeed, courts\nhave uniformly said we're entitled to do that. For\nexample -- a very clear contract case -- if an employer\nfails to make the contributions to a plan, where is the\nfiduciary going to get the authority to go and sue the\nemployer? Under 502(a)(3)(A). That is where they go.\nSo, there is no reason why -- Congress clearly\nintended under 502(a)(3)(A), when you're enforcing the\nterms of a plan, unlike as in Mertens where you were not\nenforcing the terms of a plan, where you were not\nenforcing the terms of a specific provision of ERISA, here\nit is clear that we should be entitled to enforce the\nterms of a plan even if that means preserving -- returning\nmoney to the plan.\nQUESTION: But you --\nQUESTION: But it has -- it has to come within\nthe limits of -- of the equitable adjectives in -- in the\nsection you're talking about.\nMR. JORDEN: Well, Your Honor, if it's an\ninjunction, it doesn't -- our view is it -- it is\nequitable. By -- by definition, Congress has said it's\nequitable.\nQUESTION: Well, you -- well, you say then\nCongress, when it said you can grant an injunction, didn't\nmean an injunction of the kind that the courts of equity\ntraditionally grant, but just anything the court felt\nlike.\nMR. JORDEN: Well, we believe, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: Is that what -- is that what you're\narguing?\nMR. JORDEN: No, I would say not, Your Honor. I\nwould say that Congress -- as this Court has said, ERISA\nprinciples start from trust principles unless the\nlanguage, the structure, or the purpose of ERISA is to the\ncontrary with respect to the particular issue. There are\n-- trust principles apply in enforcing the terms of a\nplan. You can't enforce the terms of a plan unless you're\napplying trust principles. That means any injunction to\nenforce the terms of a plan by definition must be\nequitable in nature.\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I certainly don't follow\nthat at all. But you're certainly entitled to make the\nargument.\nQUESTION: You were making the argument that in\nany case restitution was an equitable remedy. Therefore,\neven if we leave injunction and specific performance out\nof it, what you're seeking --\nMR. JORDEN: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- is restitution --\nQUESTION: But it isn't equitable.\nMR. JORDEN: Restitution --\nQUESTION: My -- my book of restitution says\nsometimes it's equitable, sometimes it's legal.\nMR. JORDEN: That is true, Your Honor. And --\nand citing to Judge Posner again in -- in Health Cost\nControls, he says it's legal in a legal case and equitable\nin an equitable case.\nQUESTION: It's just what my book says.\nMR. JORDEN: And in that case -- in those cases\nwhere -- where a plan is seeking restitution, it's\nequitable in nature.\nIf I may reserve, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Jorden.\nMr. Wolfson, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL R.Q. WOLFSON\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. WOLFSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI'd like to start with the point that was being\nmade by my colleague, which is that this is the only\nmechanism by which a plan can enforce a term of the plan.\nThis is equitable relief under ERISA. It can be -- a\nnumber of kinds of equitable relief are available. If not\na mandatory injunction, then the classic forms of\nequitable relief, specific enforcement of the terms of a\nplan --\nQUESTION: I've looked up every one of those,\nand having looked up every one of them, our research so\nfar shows that there is no category, specific,\nrestitution, anything else, that this would count as\nequitable because in each instance, they would have said\nthat there is an adequate remedy at law and there is no\nbasis for a constructive trust, because this is not funds\nthat come out of the trust. Rather, it's exactly what\nJustice Souter said.\nMR. WOLFSON: Several points --\nQUESTION: That's the question I posed, and\nthat's what I would like --\nMR. WOLFSON: Several points, Justice Breyer.\nFirst of all, there is no adequate remedy -- there is no\nadequate or certain remedy at law in a situation like\nthis. ERISA itself does not provide for a claim of money\ndamages.\nAnd it's very important to remember we're\ntalking about whether a -- a term of the plan can be\nenforced. There is a strong Federal policy in favor of\nsome mechanism for enforcement of the term of the plan.\nNow, there's no -- Mertens teaches us there's no\nFederal action for damages based on a violation of the\nplan. There is no State law action for damages for a\nviolation of the plan because this -- this is governed\nexclusively by Federal law. It involves the construction\nof a term of the plan. And indeed, if the plan were -- if\nthe plan were to seek an action for damages or an\ninjunction under State law, that would be deemed\ncompletely preempted by Federal law under -- under this\nCourt's previous decisions. So -- excuse me.\nQUESTION: So, you say that -- that under this,\nsince it's exclusively Federal causes of action and since\nthe Federal statute does not provide for any legal remedy,\nthat any so-called equitable remedy is available because\nthere is no legal relief.\nMR. WOLFSON: My point, Justice Scalia, is --\nQUESTION: Is that -- is that your point? So,\nyou could bring an injunction -- if a plan provided that\nsomebody would pay a lump amount of cash to the plan on a\ncertain day, you could bring an injunction to prevent that\nperson from failing to pay the lump amount of cash.\nMR. WOLFSON: Well, if -- if the plan provided\n-- it's quite possible if the plan provided, for example,\nthat an employer would make a contribution to the plan, to\nensure that the plan was adequately funded, in the amount\nof $1,000 a month and then the employer refused to do so,\nit's difficult to believe Congress intended that there be\nabsolutely no remedy for enforcement of such a central\nterm of the plan which would be necessary to make sure\nthat the plan could continue in existence.\nQUESTION: Well, but -- okay. Why did -- why\ndid Congress limit the relief to the term equitable then?\nIt could have -- it could have given a much broader\ncharter, but our cases interpreting it have said it means\nequitable.\nMR. WOLFSON: Mr. Chief Justice --\nQUESTION: That is a real limitation.\nMR. WOLFSON: There are -- there are in -- this\nties to one of Justice Breyer's points. There are\nexamples under which courts of equity would enforce, by\nspecific enforcements, contracts to pay money. And these\nare -- we've cited to Pomeroy, and there's a lengthy\nfootnote in that page at Pomeroy we've cited in our brief.\nExamples, contracts to pay insurance, contracts to pay\nindemnity, contracts to hold harmless, all of which bear a\nstrong family resemblance to the kind of thing we're\ndiscussing --\nQUESTION: But the key to this is your statement\nthat there is no remedy in the State court because it's\ninterpreting the plan. If a beneficiary -- can a\nbeneficiary sue the plan in State court where\ninterpretation of something is required? Is there some\nkind of lawsuit where they can do that?\nMR. WOLFSON: A beneficiary could -- could sue\nthe plan under 502(a) --\nQUESTION: Okay. Now, that being so --\nMR. WOLFSON: Right.\nQUESTION: -- because -- follow me because it's\nquite important to me. Why then couldn't you say, but of\ncourse this isn't preempted, of course the right remedy is\nthe State court remedy for damages, and of course in that\nsituation Congress intended the plan to be able to sue to\nget their money back, and whatever interpretation is\nnecessary by the State judge is fine? Why can't you say\nthat?\nMR. WOLFSON: Well, first of all, even if the\nbeneficiary sued the plan under 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA,\nthat is a Federal law lawsuit. So, there's no question\nthat still Federal law governs. So, there's no question\nat all about resorting to a separate corpus of State law\nto interpret the plan.\nSecond, Congress for various reasons said that\nthe beneficiary could sue the plan in State -- in State\ncourt. It did not provide that the plan could sue the\nbeneficiary in State court. ERISA is quite clear that\nthat has to be in Federal court. There's exclusive --\nexclusive jurisdiction over a civil action brought to\nenforce an action brought by a fiduciary for -- for the\nvarious kinds of equitable relief set forth in section\n502(a)(3). So, for one, as is in the plan's shoes, it is\nequitable relief under ERISA or nothing. And that --\nQUESTION: So, we should have a Bivens cause of\naction.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WOLFSON: Well, it -- it did occur -- that\ndid occur to me in the last hour, Mr. Chief Justice.\nNow -- now, one other point. The complaint does\nsay for -- the complaint was framed when the money had not\nyet left Hyundai and was framed at that point in terms of\na prohibitory injunction. It did ask for such other\nequitable relief as might be available. And there are\nclassic forms of equitable relief that would be available,\nrestitution, a constructive trust, or an equitable lien,\nwhich might -- any number of which might be applied in\nthis case depending on who might be the appropriate\ndefendant or what -- what theory or where the money is and\nso forth.\nNow --\nQUESTION: But you're -- you're saying that\ngiven the timing of the suit, this falls literally\nsquarely within subsection (A).\nMR. WOLFSON: At the timing of the suit, I think\nthere would have been -- there would have been no problem.\nA prohibitory injunction would have very properly been\nissued by the district court to prevent the funds in the\nsettlement from being disbursed in violation of the plan,\nwhich is how (a)(3)(A) is framed.\nAnd there is a res, by the way. It may not be\nmoney that came -- it may not be the exact same dollars\nthat came from the plan, but the settlement check and the\namounts that are derived from it are a res over which a\nconstructive trust might properly issue.\nAnother point about money coming from the plan.\nIn Harris Trust, the case that the Court decided a couple\nof years ago, that was a claim -- an equitable claim for\nrestitution. And the Court had no difficulty with\nconcluding that such an equitable claim would lie.\nBut I don't think anybody thought that Salomon\nBrothers, which had participated in the fiduciary breach\n-- I don't think anybody thought they were still holding\nthe same dollars that they had obtained by participating\nin the breach of the fiduciary duty. I mean, it was -- it\nwas a question of replacing those dollars, and that's --\nand that's a proper application of the equitable remedy of\nrestitution.\nQUESTION: Mr. Wolfson, I -- I want to be clear\nabout the Government's position. The Government's\nposition is that if you're under (a)(3)(A), it must be a\nclassic equitable injunction that you're seeking?\nMR. WOLFSON: No.\nQUESTION: Or rather, it doesn't matter? in\nwhich case, I don't know why you're going into all of\nthis.\nIs the Government's position that under\n(a)(3)(A) you can enjoin any act that is in violation of\ncommitments made under the plan?\nMR. WOLFSON: I don't think it is limited by\n(a)(3)(B) that says appropriate equitable relief. I\nthink --\nQUESTION: Okay. So, whether -- whether it\nwould be an ordinary injunction that a court of equity\nwould give out or not, you -- or courts have the power to\nenjoin. Is that right?\nMR. WOLFSON: Well, Justice Scalia, I don't\nthink Congress can simply declare that black is white. I\nmean, Congress cannot simply declare that something is an\ninjunction which isn't really an injunction.\nBut there is a question as to whether (a)(3)(A)\nmight be limited to prohibitory injunctions as opposed to\nmandatory injunctions, but --\nQUESTION: Yes, because it says enjoin any act,\nnot -- not any failure to act.\nMR. WOLFSON: But -- but (3) -- but (3)(B)(ii)\nalso refers to enforcement of the term of the plan, and\nthat -- that is --\nQUESTION: Well, do you think -- do you think an\ninjunction can issue under (B)?\nMR. WOLFSON: (B) little -- (B)(ii), little\nRoman ii, refers to enforcement of the term of the plan I\nbelieve. And I think specific enforcement of a term of\nthe plan, which is again a remedy which was typically\navailable in a court of equity, would classically fall\nunder that situation and then not --\nQUESTION: Well, but can't -- don't you think\nyou can make an argument that since Congress has dealt\nwith injunctions in (A), (B) does not authorize\ninjunctions?\nMR. WOLFSON: Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I wouldn't\nslice it that -- you know, that closely. Enforcement of\nthe term of the plan very often might require an order in\nthe nature of specific enforcement of a plan that might\nnot fall -- if -- if (a)(3)(A) were limited to prohibitory\ninjunctions, I think (a)(3)(B) would be there to remain.\nAnd as the Court pointed out -- made clear in Harris\nTrust, all of (a)(3) is really kind of a catchall or a\nsafety net kind of remedy that's there to ensure that\nplans are enforced according to their terms. That is a\nfundamental --\nQUESTION: May I go back to --\nMR. WOLFSON: -- policy of ERISA. Excuse me.\nQUESTION: -- to Justice Scalia's question about\n(a)(3)(A)? Supposing the statute said to compel any party\nto do X, Y, or Z, and to -- in such a case they may call\nthe remedy an injunction, even though it wouldn't\notherwise, would that be -- does Congress have power to do\nthat? Compel the party to pay money, list all the things\nthat the plaintiff here is asking for, but not describe it\nas an injunction and then say, and they may call that an\ninjunction if that relief is granted. Why couldn't they\ndo that?\nMR. WOLFSON: Well, Congress could do it, but I\ndon't -- I mean, Congress could do it. But I think an\nordinary understanding of the term injunction -- it\ndoesn't have to be limited to a specific analog that a\ncourt of equity might have issued in 1685, and Congress\ncan expand the court's injunctive power. I don't think\nthat Congress was intending to say, well, it's really\ndamages, but we'll just call it -- call it an injunction.\nBut this is not --\nQUESTION: Thank you -- thank you, Mr. Wolfson.\nMr. Taranto, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD G. TARANTO\nAMICUS CURIAE, IN SUPPORT OF THE JUDGMENT BELOW\nMR. TARANTO: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI'd like to summarize the three points I want to\nmake for why petitioners' money suit does not request\nappropriate equitable relief and therefore is outside\n502(a)(3).\nMy first point --\nQUESTION: May I just be sure you cover it\nbefore you get through? What about it being within\n(a)(3)(A) and that (a)(3)(A) just gives the word enjoin a\nvery broad, non-historic meaning, according to my\nhypothetical a second ago? Why is that impossible?\nMR. TARANTO: I -- I think because of the word\nother in -- in the -- the provision. To -- to separate\nthe enjoin clause from the other appropriate equitable\nrelief I think does impossible violence to the\ncongressional specification that injunctions are a subset\nof the appropriate equitable relief.\nOne practical consequence I think that would\nfollow from wrenching those apart would be that a plan\ncould write a liquidated damages or some other damages\nprovision into the plan and then seek an injunction for\npayment of that money. I don't think that that --\nQUESTION: What would be so terrible about that?\nMR. TARANTO: Oh, I'm not sure that there would\nbe anything terrible, and I don't think there would be a\ncongressional -- I mean, I think Congress could call a\nremedy anything it wants, subject to constitutional\nconstraints, for example, Seventh Amendment constraints,\nand Seventh Amendment issues might well arise.\nQUESTION: How would you enforce a liquidated\ndamages provision, assuming a plan has one?\nMR. TARANTO: I don't think one is enforceable.\nQUESTION: So, there's a lot of stuff that's --\nthat's permissible under ERISA that is simply not\nenforceable in courts.\nMR. TARANTO: I don't know how much. Liquidated\ndamages -- I will make specific reference to another\nprovision of 502, which is 502(g). The question --\nCongress specifically dealt with the question of\ndelinquent contributions by enacting section 515. It\nlimited 515 to delinquent contributions from multi-\nemployer plans and plans adopted pursuant to collective\nbargaining agreements. And then it said there's a\nspecific remedy for that, 502(g)(2), which talks about\nlegal relief. That expanded the universe of relief\navailable for a particular kind of monetary issue which\nincludes liquidated damages.\nBut the limitations that Mertens I think\ncorrectly identified in 502(a)(3) -- namely, it's limited\nto equitable relief -- by its terms, carves out of the\nuniverse of remedies that our legal system has\ntraditionally thought necessary one particular or one --\none subset of that relief and says this is all that's\navailable.\nThere are other circumstances ERISA by virtue of\na broad but not universal preemption in which plan terms\nare not, in fact, remediable. When beneficiaries seek\nmedical treatment to which they're guaranteed under the\nterms of a plan and don't get it in time before it becomes\na moot point, those provisions become unenforceable. It's\nnot unheard of in ERISA.\nNow, I do want to say that I think that the\nparticular interest that we're talking about here, the\nplan's interest in recourse to recover money that ought to\ncome from somebody else -- namely Hyundai, the third-\nparty tortfeasor or alleged third-party tortfeasor -- I\nthink need not be viewed as unavailable. I think that\npreemption law does not go so far as to rule out, in\nparticular, the plan's suit as subrogee in State court, a\nplain, garden variety tort suit --\nQUESTION: Why -- why subrogee? Because this to\nme now I'm thinking, having listened to this, is a key\npoint to me. Why can't the plan simply bring an ordinary\ncontract action attaching the asset in State court?\nMR. TARANTO: That -- that --\nQUESTION: Why does it have to be a subrogee?\nMR. TARANTO: Well, I think that this Court's\npreemption decisions, as I read them, don't make that\nimpossible, but make it more difficult.\nQUESTION: All right. Now, are we dealing with\nlanguage in decisions that didn't focus on this\ncircumstance? Because it's very hard for me to believe\nthat Congress would not have wanted the plan to be able to\nsue people who owed them money including beneficiaries.\nAfter all, the purpose of ERISA is to protect the assets\nof the workers in plans. So, I'm -- I'm quite interested\nif you can say anything more about this point.\nMR. TARANTO: Well, I -- I do think that this\nCourt's preemption decisions, from Pilot Life and some of\nits successors, have language in them that, taken all by\nthemselves, might suggest that any contract cause of\naction on the same subject that is addressed in one of the\nERISA remedial provisions would be preempted. Each of\nthose cases, in fact, involved requests for greater relief\nthan was made available, and that might well be a problem\nfor the kind of contract action you're talking about here.\nIf that relief is legal relief and it's covered by\n502(a)(3) as a subject matter and Congress did not provide\nfor it, there is a fairly strong inference that that kind\nof relief was relief that Congress did not want provided.\nQUESTION: Now, which -- which would be the\neasier route? If I'm convinced that, of course, Congress\nwants the plan to be able to get its money back, legally\nnow is it more proper to say it's not preempted the State\ncourt action, ordinary contract with attaching the assets?\nOr is it more legally correct to say there is no State\ncourt action; therefore, there is no adequate remedy at\nlaw; therefore, an action close to restitution or specific\nperformance lies?\nMR. TARANTO: Well, I -- I don't think that it,\nin the end, works to say that anytime equitable relief --\nthat anytime there's no legal relief, then there must be\nequitable relief because then I think we've erased the\ndistinction Congress has meant -- has created.\nI do think the subrogation action presents a\nmuch easier case, indeed a case that ought to fall outside\npreemption law. It has not been the case under ERISA and\nit has not been the case under the Labor Management\nRelation Act section 301 provision that ERISA draws on\nthat, as petitioners' counsel said, every suit involving\ninterpretation of the plan is preempted, every State court\nsuit. This Court, for example, in the Lingle decision,\nwhich I did not cite in -- in my brief, but Lingle against\nMagic Chef at the very end says plan interpretation -- or\nI guess collective bargaining agreement interpretation in\nthe 301 context -- is something that State courts can do\nas an adjunct to a suit where the elements of liability\nand the duties are determined otherwise.\nQUESTION: Mr. Taranto, what about the presence\nof State subrogation laws where the State has a strong law\nreflecting its policy that there shouldn't be any\nsubrogation actions in the State court?\nMR. TARANTO: Well, I -- I think that I would\nagree with petitioners that the question of the plan's\nrights are matters of Federal law, and I don't think it is\npossible for a State to say an ERISA plan that does\nprovide in terms for subrogation, stepping into the shoes\nof the beneficiary's tort claim -- I don't think a State\ncould properly deprive the plan of -- of that right. I\nthink that would be a matter of -- of Federal law.\nBut once the plan --\nQUESTION: All other State restrictions on\ncontracting are overridden simply because it's an ERISA\ncontract?\nMR. TARANTO: I don't know about all -- all --\nQUESTION: Provisions for excessive punitive\ndamages? I mean, there are all sorts of State provisions\nfor contract law. They're -- they're all to be set aside\nonce -- once you have an ERISA contract?\nMR. TARANTO: Well, I -- I guess I -- I should\nsay, although I guess it's not my place to be doing a lot\nof conceding this morning, but I would be happy, of\ncourse, if -- if many State laws were not preempted.\nI think for purposes of this case in addressing\nthe -- the concern about whether plans have recourse, a\nvery narrow question is presented, and that is whether\nplan's tort suit against the alleged tortfeasor is\npreempted because not in determining whether the -- the\nthird-party alleged tortfeasor violated a tort duty and is\nliable, not in determining the amount of -- of overall\nharm caused, but rather, in deciding whether the plan can\nbe there as a plaintiff and what portion of any such\nrecovery would belong to the plan, those essentially\nancillary matters, which might require interpretation of\nthe plan -- those, it seems to me, don't get preempted.\nAnd as long as those don't get preempted --\nQUESTION: It's very odd that you'd have a -- a\nbody of Federal common law that can be applied only in\nState courts.\nMR. TARANTO: Well, I -- I don't think that this\nwould be only in -- in State courts because there could be\n-- I mean, the interpretation of -- of many plan\nprovisions is going to come through an (a)(1) action, the\nbeneficiary suing for -- for benefits. There may be\nspecific kinds of equitable relief that is -- that are\nrequested that would fall under 502(a)(3).\nMy -- my point is that there is no reason to\ndistort what I think is the natural meaning of equitable\nrelief based on an admittedly serious concern that a plan\nmight not have recourse for money because I think the plan\ndoes have recourse for money through bearing the burden of\npursuing that money against the tortfeasor, in which the\ninterpretation of the plan is ancillary and -- and\nincidental just like at the very end of the Lingle against\nMagic Chef decision, which was then quoted and picked up\nagain in the Livadas decision in 1994, in the labor\ncontract context. State courts are entitled, despite a\ngenerally very broad preemption of the labor contract\ninterpretation, to interpret labor contracts. So too with\nrespect to the plan for this limited role for subrogation.\nQUESTION: Mr. Taranto, you -- what you're\ntelling us then is that there would be no preemption in\nthis class of cases, that in this class of cases where the\nplan insurer is saying we want to get from this recovery\nthe amount that we advanced, that in this class of cases\nyou would have an entirely Federal law governed claim that\ncould only be brought in State court.\nI don't want to talk about the other claims that\nyou might have, but here where the plan insurance company\nsays, here's this tort recovery, we want our piece of it,\nwe want that restored, we want our advance restored to us,\nfor that category of case, you're telling us you have a\nclaim under Federal law that can be brought only in State\ncourts.\nMR. TARANTO: I -- I -- if I can say it slightly\n-- slightly differently. I think that the State tort law\nis the claim -- creates a claim for negligence and any\ndamages caused by that. What subrogation does, which I\nthink ought to be a matter of Federal common law which\nprobably just follows the terms of an ERISA plan, is say\nthat the plan can step into the shoes of the beneficiary's\nrights under State law. And I do think that that mode of\nproceeding to find essentially a -- to find a recovery out\nof money that in justice, according to petitioners, ought\nto come from the third-party tortfeasor is available in\nState court. And therefore, a principal worry about\nadhering to what I think is the natural meaning of\nequitable relief in (a)(2) -- in (a)(3) weakens\nsubstantially.\nQUESTION: I -- I see that except for one point.\nI don't see why you're going down the subrogation route,\nwhich at least one of the amicus briefs suggests would\ncause a lot of problems, rather than simply saying it's a\nstraight contract action under State court -- under State\nlaw. Why? What's the -- you have a reason for doing it.\nMR. TARANTO: The -- the reason that I --\nQUESTION: Is what?\nMR. TARANTO: -- that I have suggested is that\nthe contract action between the plan or its fiduciary,\nwhich the cases have not treated as identical, but the\ncontract action against the -- against the beneficiary to\n-- for a supposed violation of the terms of the plan feels\nan awful lot like the subject matter covered directly by\n(a)(3). And if, therefore, that contract action would be\nrequesting relief that could only really be legal relief,\nthere would be a much stronger preemption argument, a\nconflict preemption argument, that says Congress really\ndid say we want equitable relief, we don't want legal\nrelief, and that would be a stronger preemption --\nQUESTION: At which point you'd say that\nCongress certainly didn't mean they can't sue people to\nget money belonging to the plan. We have the -- am I\nright? I'm trying to -- it's a kind of circle, and I'm\ntrying to see if I have the -- all the parts.\nMR. TARANTO: I -- I think we're understanding\neach other, and I -- and I can see the way out of the --\nthe stronger preemption argument as to -- as to that. I\nthink the preemption argument as to the subrogation suit,\nthe ordinary tort suit, is much, much weaker to begin with\nand therefore doesn't require as -- as strong a -- a\nresponse.\nQUESTION: Mr. Taranto, can I ask you to respond\nto an argument that occurs to me? If -- going back to the\ntext of (a)(3), if you just had (a)(3)(A), I -- I think\nyou've agreed one could read that to just have a sort of a\nstatutory injunction that is divorced from prior equity\npractice and just includes doing anything that is\nnecessary to comply with the plan. But you respond to\nthat by saying, but (B) says other equitable relief, which\ntherefore has the effect of narrowing what otherwise might\nbe a permissible reading of (A). Am I correct that that's\nyour --\nMR. TARANTO: Yes.\nQUESTION: But my -- my -- the reason I'm\nconcerned about that response is it seems to me that (B)\nwas intended to broaden the remedies available rather than\nto narrow them, and you're necessarily construing it as a\nnarrowing construction.\nMR. TARANTO: Well, I -- I think I'm construing\nit in -- in two ways. Perhaps as narrowing, but more\nimportantly as clarifying what otherwise would, I think,\nbe the more reasonable reading of (A), the enjoin clause,\neven if there were nothing else. I think the more\nreasonable reading would be injunctions as equity made\nthem available.\nWhen I read -- what your first comment said, if\nall that was there was the enjoin language, I think that\nlanguage by itself might be taken to mean enjoin any\nviolation of the terms of the plan. I don't think that\nthat would be the better reading even without the language\nthat follows, but I think the language that follows\ncompels adoption of that because it characterizes as\nequitable relief the injunctions provided for in the first\nclause.\nQUESTION: Is there any legislative history\nindicating why Congress limited the relief which it\npermitted in this section to equitable relief?\nMR. TARANTO: I'm not aware of any. I -- I have\nreviewed the -- the legislative history, the collective\nthree-volume legislative history, and as I think some of\nthis Court's decisions have -- have indicated, some of the\nearlier bills contained broader relief provisions, legal\nor equitable relief, and that was cut back for reasons\nthat at least I don't recall having seen.\nIn -- in the one reference to -- which I cited\nin -- in my brief I think at page 27 -- in one of the\nSenate reports that discusses the immediate predecessor of\nthis provision, there's no general reference to any kind\nof relief that's necessary to -- to make plans protect all\nof their rights or vice versa. It's been principally a\nbeneficiary protection statute.\nAnd there's also no general reference to\nrestitution in the abstract. There's a reference to\ninjunctions and specifically to constructive trusts. So,\neven there, there isn't a general idea that anytime we're\ntalking about what sometimes are called direct damages or\ngeneral damages or contractual damages, and therefore\nmaking whole the loser of a particular sum of money that's\nbeen promised, that that action would somehow be\ntransformed into an equitable action when historically it\nvery plainly wasn't.\nQUESTION: Any more so --\nQUESTION: Well, couldn't you have historically\ngotten --\nQUESTION: Any more so than -- than the back pay\nunder title 7, which is money? Why isn't this really\ncomparable to that? I mean, Congress, one would assume,\ndidn't want compensatory damages or punitive damages, and\nthat's what they meant when they said appropriate\nequitable relief. But if back pay, which is fungible\nmoney, can be classified as equitable, why not this kind\nof restitution?\nMR. TARANTO: Let me -- let me try to answer\nthat -- that this way. This Court has never said that for\nthe important constitutional question, that back pay is\nindeed equitable relief for Seventh Amendment purposes.\nIt has several times said we are not deciding that and\nhave not decided that.\nThe courts of appeals have, for many years, in\nfact so held. But if you look back at the original\ndecisions that so held back in the 1960's, they all rested\non something that is suggested directly by the language of\ntitle 7, which is not that back pay standing alone is\nequitable and therefore outside the jury trial right, but\nthat equity always had the power to award money when\nincidental to and intertwined with traditional equitable\nrelief. In -- in the context of title 7, as in the\ncontext of the National Labor Relations Act on which title\n7 was based, back pay enters not as a separately\nauthorized remedy, but as reinstatement with or without\nback pay.\nQUESTION: But you could have under both -- I\nthink this is correct -- the Fair Labor Standards Act and\nunder title 7, a monetary remedy without any\nreinstatement.\nMR. TARANTO: And -- and I agree that the courts\nof appeals have, for a long time, treated that as outside\nthe jury trial right, but this Court has never said so.\nAnd perhaps more importantly as a matter of congressional\nintent, there's no reason to think that Congress in 1974,\nwhen writing the ERISA provision, was adopting any\nspecialized meaning of equitable relief that Congress may\nhave had in mind in -- in the title 7 context.\nQUESTION: Well, why wasn't there a reason given\n-- the limitations on the plan's ability to sue elsewhere?\nAnd as Justice Stevens and Justice Ginsburg's line of\nquestioning suggests, it seems to me that if (A) and (B)\nare both going to do some work in the statute, that to\ninsist that (A) simply embodies the historic definition of\nequity is -- is too narrow. And you can say that what\nCongress intended to do was to expand the injunctive power\nto analogs that are close to equitable actions here in\naccounting or instructions to a guardian or instructions\nto a trustee, it seems to me, is very close to historic\nequitable --\nMR. TARANTO: But (B) -- (B) does quite\ndefinitely, as Harris Trust indicates, expand beyond\ninjunctions the available relief. Because Harris Trust,\nafter all, was a classic form of restitution where the\nmoney that was being sought was traceable. It, of course,\ndoesn't have to be the very same money. It can be either\nmoney commingled with other funds or the product or\nprofits from it, which are exactly the three things that\nthis Court listed in -- in Harris Trust. That wouldn't,\nunder any circumstance, be an injunction, but it would be\na traditionally available form of equitable relief.\nBut that doesn't mean that the whole of\n502(a)(3), both (A) and (B), can reach beyond the limits\nthat equity made -- set on the relief that the court of\nchancery would -- would make available.\nQUESTION: No, but your --\nQUESTION: Even if Congress has directed\notherwise.\nMR. TARANTO: I'm sorry?\nQUESTION: The question is, hasn't Congress\ndirected otherwise necessarily in (A)?\nMR. TARANTO: I -- I don't think so because,\nagain, textually the two clauses are linked by the word\nother. And if it weren't the case, then again a plan\ncould write a damages provision into its -- into itself\nand effectively turn (a)(3) into an authorization to get\ndamages by saying we're just seeking, by enjoining the\npromised damages that you cause, an injunction.\nQUESTION: But you're -- you're using the word\nother as -- as implying in (A) a limitation of (A) to only\nthose instances in which a 1750 or whatever court of\nequity would have awarded an injunction.\nBut isn't there another way of -- of giving some\n-- some meaning to other here? And that is to say that\nother was referring back to injunctions which (A) refers\nto simply as a generic form of relief. Everybody would\nagree. What -- what's an injunction? A legal remedy or\nequitable remedy? Sure, it's an equitable remedy. And\nthe only thing that -- that other is referring to in (B)\nis the kinds of remedy. It doesn't necessarily imply that\nthat kind of remedy, when awarded under (A), was a -- was\na remedy only in those instances in which in the old law\nit could have been awarded.\nSo, why isn't the -- the generic remedy meaning\nof other a satisfactory construction which then leaves the\ncourts free to issue any kind of injunction under -- under\n(A) to enjoin a violation of the plan?\nMR. TARANTO: Well, I -- I guess I -- I find the\n-- the much more natural reading of this provision in the\ncontext of (a)(2) which talks about equitable and other\nremedial relief and (g)(2) which talks about legal and\nequitable relief to be that Congress in (a)(3) said we\nwant equitable relief available.\nAnd I -- I take it, at least, that a specific\nillustration of why it doesn't make much sense to separate\nthose -- those apart even aside from what I think is the\nmore natural textual point is that it would allow the plan\nagain to write damages provisions into their terms, the\nplan's, and then come into court and say, we want an\ninjunction for the beneficiary to pay us any damages that\nare caused by -- by some act because that's what --\nQUESTION: Yes, but -- presumably, under --\nunder (A), under any injunction practice, the -- the court\nwould require proof that there was need for an injunction\nin the first place. In other words, one couldn't simply\ncome in and say, gee, they might violate it, so give us an\ninjunction.\nBut if one could make out a -- a case in the\nfirst instance for their need -- of a need for the\ninjunction, that it seems to me would answer your concern\nthat it could be -- that (A) thereby could be turned, in\neffect, through a plan provision into a general legal\nremedy.\nMR. TARANTO: But I'm not sure, I guess, if --\nif a plan term said the beneficiary -- I mean, I think\nthis could go either way, but to take --\nQUESTION: You're going to take it one step\nfurther and say you can always get an injunction under any\ncircumstances saying pay over the money.\nMR. TARANTO: Right, right. And I -- and I\nthink that that's -- that that's just so far outside any\nrecognizable concept of -- of equitable relief --\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I agree but I think it's\nalso pretty likely outside anything that Congress might\nhave been thinking about too. Isn't it? In other words,\nthe -- the very fact that Congress perhaps didn't --\ndidn't have that in mind, because it is so far-fetched, is\na -- is a good reason to read (A) as -- as broadly as I'm\nsuggesting.\nMR. TARANTO: Well, I -- I guess I -- I would\nsay that it's -- it is a better reason either to let\nCongress alter the statute if unanticipated problems have\n-- have arisen or, more immediately, to make sure that\npreemption law isn't taken to an extreme that precludes\nwhat I think is the more -- is the preferable solution\nanyway, which is that there is -- by the very terms of the\nplan, there's an intrinsic reference of this interest, of\nthis right, to an underlying State court suit. It is\npreferable from a systemic point of view, from the point\nof view of avoiding the extra costs of duplicative\nlitigation, of avoiding the potential conflict between\nFederal and State courts on either the very same or\nclosely related questions for there to be a single,\nconsolidated proceeding in which the entire question gets\nwrapped up who is supposed to get the single pot of money.\nThere may be special reasons, as there was in\nthis case, where the State court is probably uniquely\nentitled to create the special needs trust. There are\ngood reasons for that consolidated State court proceeding\nto be the forum where the plan protects this interest, and\npreemption law I think very readily allows the plan to do\nthat.\nAs long as there is that outlet, perhaps even\nunder Mertens, if there isn't that outlet, but as long as\nthere is that outlet, then I think the more natural\nreading of 502(a)(3) should be respected.\nQUESTION: Mr. Taranto, I think there's some\ntension between the argument you're making now, which is\ncertainly a persuasive argument, and the cases you cite on\npage 38 of your brief that talk about the gap between\nFederal law and State law.\nMR. TARANTO: Well, those -- I -- I agree that\nthere is -- that there are certain gaps between Federal\nand State law that, in the beneficiary context, have\nbecome all but commonplace because there is an inference,\nwhich no court has yet figured a way to -- to supersede,\nthe way Justice Breyer was talking about, that when\nbeneficiary relief under (a)(1) is limited to benefits,\nit's not that Congress has, in effect, determined that\ndamages that flow from violation of term plans to -- to\nprovide necessary medical services are not available.\nIf the Court has no further questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nTaranto.\n"
