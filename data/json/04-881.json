WOLFMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nSection 207 of the Social Security Act contains\na broad ban on the attachment of Social Security benefits\nthat may be overridden if, in doing so, Congress expressly\nrefers to Section 207. Our basic position is that the\neffect of an express reference to Section 207 can go no\nfurther than the authority that is granted in the statute\nthat includes the express reference. Therefore, here, the\nDebt Collection Act, the statute that contains that\nexpress reference, prohibits offsets to collect claims\nthat have been outstanding for more than 10 years.\nTherefore, the Government lacks offset authority to\ncollect Mr. Lockhart's older debts.\nThe Debt Collections Act's 10-year bar on the\nright of the Government to offset debt from governmental\npayments owing to debtors was enacted in 1982. But, at\nthat time, the Government did not have authority to offset\nSocial Security benefits at all. The Government's claim\nthat there's no 10-year bar here relies entirely on a\nprovision of the Higher Education technical amendments\nthat overrode statutes of limitations for collecting\nstudent debts. But that was passed in 1991, 5 years\nbefore the -- before -- the Government had authority to\noffset Social Security benefits at all. That authority,\nas I've referred to, came only in 1996, in the Debt\nCollection Improvement Act, which did expressly refer to\nthe Social Security Act's anti-attachment provision. But\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did -- are -- just as an\ninitial matter, are you sure that one Congress can bind a\nfuture Congress that way, that Congress can pass a law\nthat says, you know, \"In the future, no statute shall have\nX effect unless it says\" -- and then it writes in a phrase\nthat has to be said?\nMR. WOLFMAN: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And then you have a future\nCongress that makes its intent entirely clear in a statute\nthat does not use the magic words. I thought our cases\nheld that, in such a situation, the will of the future\nCongress prevails --\nMR. WOLFMAN: That --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- so long as it's clearly\nexpressed.\nMR. WOLFMAN: I will say that that is something\nthat we've considered. It's not briefed here, but I think\nthe issue is not presented here. And here's why: because\nin -- what occurred in 1996 comported with the express-\nreference requirement. The problem here is that -- so, it\nsaid that they can offset Social Security benefits. But\nit is contained in a statute that includes the 10-year\nbar. So, even if the anti-attachment provision did not\nexclude the express-reference provision, it still --\nwhatever allowed the attachment has to be, in our view,\ncoincident with the statute in which the express reference\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: It didn't contain the bar at\nthe time that they said, \"You can collect it.\" In the\nlater statute, which said, \"You now can collect out of\nSocial Security,\" when they passed that, did it contain a\n10-year bar?\nMR. WOLFMAN: Yes, it did.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought the Higher Education\nAct said -- as of what year did the Higher Education Act\nsay, \"No statute of limitations applies to us\"?\nMR. WOLFMAN: That was 1991.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fine. In --\nMR. WOLFMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- 1991, it said, \"No statute\nof limitations applies to us.\" Then, in what year did the\nstatute -- was passed which said, \"And you can collect\nmoney out of Social Security payments for higher\neducation\"?\nMR. WOLFMAN: That occurred in 1996. But, as I\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Why isn't that the\nend of it? So --\nMR. WOLFMAN: The reason that's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- so there was no -- there was\nno statute of limitations applying to the Social Security\nAct; and then, in 1996, they say, \"And now go get them.\"\nMR. WOLFMAN: Because --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What can we do about that?\nMR. WOLFMAN: Because, with respect, that's not\nwhat Congress said in 1996.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What did they say?\nMR. WOLFMAN: They didn't say, \"Go get them.\"\nWhat they did is, as an amendment to the Debt Collection\nAct, in the Debt Collection Improvement Act, they inserted\npermission to go -- to offset Social Security benefits in\na statute that has a 10-year bar. So --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It has a 10-year bar. But the\nearlier 1991 Act says, \"That doesn't apply to us.\"\nMR. WOLFMAN: Yes, but -- but, again, getting\nback -- and I think this takes us back to Justice Scalia's\nquestion -- that -- the -- there is a broad anti-\nattachment provision. There is an express-reference\nrequirement. Our view is that the -- that -- those\nrequirements can go no -- the abrogation of the -- of the\nbar to offset Social Security benefits, or to attach\nSocial Security benefits in any way, can go no further\nthan the statute in which that abrogation occurs. And\nthis statute has a 10-year bar.\nSo, if I can explain further, the Debt\nCollection Improvement Act, and the Debt Collection Act\nbefore it, has a 10-year bar. It's not merely a statute\nof limitations. It says that the Government has no\nauthority to offset after the 10-year period, after the\nclaim has been outstanding for more than 10 years. That's\nthe statute that includes the abrogation of the offset of\nSocial Security benefits.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, in other words, you're\nsaying that that provision of the later statute that says,\n\"Go get them on Social Security,\" implicitly reads into it\nthe 10-year bar that's in a different part of the statute.\nMR. WOLFMAN: Well, I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, it's as if it said, \"Go get\nthem on Social Security, under 407, which is gone now, but\nonly for 10 years.\"\nMR. WOLFMAN: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that what your -- I'm trying\nto understand this.\nMR. WOLFMAN: That is our argument.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. WOLFMAN: That is our argument.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMR. WOLFMAN: But I would only qualify it --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The only problem is, it\ndoesn't say that.\nMR. WOLFMAN: No, I would disagree, Your Honor.\nI would say that my only quarrel with your question is\nthat it's not implicit, it is explicit. The statute --\nthe Debt Collection Improvement Act, as the Debt\nCollection Act before it, contains a 10-year bar on the\nauthority of the Government to offset. This is not a mere\nstatute-of-limitations defense that can be waived. This\nis a complete lack of authority to the -- in the\nGovernment to offset. That's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are --\nMR. WOLFMAN: -- the statute --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you saying that this has a\npurpose other than barring stable -- stale claims? It's\nsimply designed to limit the offset provisions in order to\nallow other Federal programs to proceed and -- I'm looking\nfor some way for you to describe (e) as being something\nother than a limitations provision.\nMR. WOLFMAN: Well, what it says --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Because I think that would help\nyou.\nMR. WOLFMAN: Yes, and I think -- that's exactly\nmy point. What (e) says is that this Act does not apply\n-- and I'm quoting now -- \"This Act does not apply when\nthe claim has been outstanding for more than 10 years.\"\nThat strikes us -- you can call it \"limitations\" if you\nwant, but it strikes us as a very powerful one. Because\nit restricts the Government's ability to bring such a case\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if --\nMR. WOLFMAN: -- for offset.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- if we call it\n\"limitations,\" you have a much harder case, because of the\n1991 Act.\nMR. WOLFMAN: Well, I -- with respect, I don't\nthink that the actual nomenclature matters that much, but\nI will distinguish it from what the law normally calls a\nlimitations period, because a limitations period is one\nthat is raised as an affirmative defense and may be\nwaived. This provision, where it says, \"This Act does not\napply\" --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well --\nMR. WOLFMAN: -- does not apply.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- can you give me a reason\nfor the Government's adopting (e), the 10-year -- the 10-\nyear bar, other than for stale claims or --\nMR. WOLFMAN: Oh, I don't know that there is\none, but my point, again, is simply that the Government\nhas no authority to proceed. So, then we look -- we look\nat that statute, and we say, \"What did the -- what did the\nCongress do in 1996?\" What the Congress did in 1996 was\namend that very statute by saying, \"Within the confines of\nthis statute, you may now offset.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right, but that's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I understand that, but I'm\njust -- I'm just saying, if you could give me an\nexplanation, a characterization, a description, a\nstatement of purpose that's other than the bar on stale\nclaims, I think you'd have a stronger case. But it seems\nto me just like a stale-claims statute, so I go back and\nlook for other limitations period, and I find it in\n1091(a).\nMR. WOLFMAN: You know, again, if -- it is not\n-- the purposes of the bar are not stated in any of the\nlegislative materials, and we can assume that at least one\nof the principal purposes was to not allow the litigation,\nthe contesting of stale claims, or to give the individuals\nrepose, which is a purpose of time bars.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You can call it any purpose you\nwant, but there is an earlier word in 9- -- 1091(a), just\nwhat Justice Kennedy said. The earlier word says\nlimitations don't apply to the higher-education debt. And\nso, if this later statute, the words you're talking about,\nthe words of \"10 years,\" the words that limit when you can\ndo it, if those words, which are in subsection (e), are a\n\"limitation,\" then I guess the earlier statute says they\ndon't apply to the higher-education debt. And so, I don't\nsee how you get out of that. I mean -- I mean, this is a\nrather harsh result. I understand why you'd like to get\nout of it. But I don't understand how we do get out of\nit.\nMR. WOLFMAN: Well, I think there are -- there\nare -- I -- there are several answers. And, if I might,\nfirst of all, if you must characterize what -- and we are\nhappy to do so -- was in the 1996 Act as either a time\nbar or a limitations period, this is clearly the former,\nbecause this -- because the limitations periods in the law\nare ones which have to be raised by affirmative defense.\nFor instance, the Rules of Civil Procedure say limitations\nperiods are raised by affirmative defense, and the case\nlaw is unanimous that they can be waived. That is not\nwhat this provision does. This provision restricts the\nauthority, in the first instance, for the Government to\nbring the case.\nThe second thing I would say, though, Your Honor\n-- and I think it does not matter, ultimately -- that can\nbe our principal submission here, and it is, but it does\nnot matter -- I think, ultimately, the nomenclature\ndoesn't matter, because -- again, because the Act\nrestricts the authority of the Government to bring a case\nthat is beyond the 10-year period. And that is the\nstatute that contains the express reference. That is the\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, part of the problem\nis that 1091(a)(2), the \"notwithstanding\" clause, talks\nalso specifically about offsets, which is what this is, I\ntake it.\nMR. WOLFMAN: No, I understand that, Your Honor.\nI mean --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, if it had said \"no\" --\nMR. WOLFMAN: -- I understand that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- \"no limitations period,\"\nthen I might -- this specifically talks about an offset.\nMR. WOLFMAN: Well, that's right. The -- and I\n-- I don't think that undercuts our argument at all,\nbecause, after all, there's no question that, prior to\n1996, there was offset authority in the Government to\noffset -- to collect debt against other types of income,\nother than Social Security. So, I don't think that\nundercuts our argument at all.\nBut let me, if I might, go back to your question\none more time, because I think there's yet a third answer,\nwhich is -- which is the chronological answer that -- made\nin our briefs that, in 1991, the Congress could not have\nhad the intent to get at Social Security benefits at all,\nbecause, of course, there -- and it's -- this point is\nconceded -- the Government had no authority whatsoever to\noffset Social Security benefits.\nIf I might, in the -- let me go --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I pursue that point for a\nsecond --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- more? I -- it seems to me\nthat you would have a much stronger argument on that point\nif, in 1996, the Act provided that, suddenly, Social\nSecurity benefits -- some Social Security benefits would\nbe -- would be subject to administrative offset, but only\nthose when the Government -- imposed when the Government\nis trying to collect educational loans. We would then\nhave what seems to -- would seem to me to be a really\nhead-to-head conflict between the two statutes. The\ntrouble is that, in 1996, the extension of the\nadministrative setoff authority covered Social Security\nbenefits to be -- for which there would be a setoff for\nany purpose -- not just educational loans; for any\npurpose. So that, in fact, it is possible for us to read\nthe 1996 Act as having an effect -- there's a 10-year\nlimit, generally -- at the same time that we read the\nearlier -- I forget what the -- '91, I guess it is --\nMR. WOLFMAN: The HETA law, yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- which says, with respect to\neducational loan collections, including by setoff, there's\nno limitation at all. So, we can have both statutes\nwithout rendering either one of them nugatory. And isn't\nthat the preferred way to read statutes?\nMR. WOLFMAN: Well, but I -- but I -- with all\nrespect, I think our interpretation certainly does not\nrender HETA nugatory, because HETA would still override\nlimitations periods for other forms of collection with\nrespect to other types --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But with --\nMR. WOLFMAN: of debts.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- with respect to Social\nSecurity setoffs, of course, it would.\nMR. WOLFMAN: Well, it -- I'm not sure I\nunderstand that question.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Social Security -- Social\nSecurity said it would be -- it would be a -- it would --\na flat head-to-head contradiction, no matter how you read\nit, on Social Security setoffs for educational loans.\nMR. WOLFMAN: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And if that's the only thing\nthat the 1996 Act covered, we would say, \"Boy, there is\njust an absolute conflict here. We can't have both\nstatutes.\" But, in fact, we can have both statutes most of\nthe time. We read the 1996 10-year limitation as covering\neverything except setoffs against Social Security for\neducational loans. And, with respect to the educational\nloans, we give respect to the -- to the earlier decision\nthat there be no limitation at all. You just have a\nweaker argument than you would have if the 1996 Act only\ncovered this case.\nMR. WOLFMAN: Well, that may be, but let me,\nagain, if I -- if I might, respond to that -- to this --\nto this point, because I think it is true that the\nproportion of times under our argument that the 10-year\nbar would apply would -- is greater under our position,\nbut it is, nevertheless, true that HETA still applies to\nmany situations, under our reading, and the 10-year bar\napplies to somewhat more. But let me -- I think there's\nanother answer to your point, which is, it still does not\nundercut our basic submission that the Congress could not\nhave formed this specific intent. And it's very unlike\nthe -- the intent being to get to the Government the --\nthe result it seeks here. And the reason for that is --\nis, they could not have focused on this problem, because\nin -- it wasn't for another 5 years that Social Security\nwas even on the radar screen at all. And this brings me\nback, I think, to Justice Breyer's --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but --\nMR. WOLFMAN: -- initial question.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- may I ask this question?\nThat's a very -- that's a very interesting statutory\nconstruction case, I must say, by the way. But the -- in\n1996, when they made the offset available against Social\nSecurity payments, they didn't enact a 10-year statute of\nlimitations; they changed subsection, I think, (b) to (d)\nand said the 10-year provision is retained. And when the\n10-year provision was first put in -- I mean, when the\nexception for student loans was made, in 1991, you had a\nstatute that had a 10-year period for everything except\nstudent loan recovery. And it seems to me that if you\nlook at the 1996 statute as saying, \"We're going to allow\noffsets against Social Security,\" under the same scheme\nthat was enacted in 1991, because we had just amended the\n10-year provision to preserve it -- they preserved the 10-\nyear provision -- that they seem to me to be preserving it\nin a statute that made this distinction between student\nloans and all other offsets. Is --\nMR. WOLFMAN: I --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It isn't as though they\nenacted, for the first time, an authority to offset Social\nSecurity and, in that statute, said, \"And -- but, by the\nway, there's a 10-year period of limitations here.\"\nMR. WOLFMAN: Well, that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Rather, they amended the 1991\nAct.\nMR. WOLFMAN: -- that is correct. And I think\nthat -- but with a caveat, which I'll get to -- but -- I\nthink that is correct, but it is a -- it is a consequence\nof the situation that Congress found itself in, in 1996.\nIn other words, it already had a statute, the offset\nstatute, which had a 10-year bar. And so --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it also had the exception\nfor student loans. It's -- it was --\nMR. WOLFMAN: Well --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- side by side with the rest\nof the 10-year bar.\nMR. WOLFMAN: I'm not sure what you mean in that\n-- I'm not sure what you mean by the exception for student\nloans. There --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it's 1091(a).\nMR. WOLFMAN: Well, 1091 was in a different\nstatutory provision, in a different part of the code. But\nyes, what I'm saying is, they --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it was in the 1991\nstatute.\nMR. WOLFMAN: Right. It was in a 1991 statute\nthat was a freestanding statute that dealt with Social\nSecurity benefits, generally. Then what you had in 1996\nwas a focus on offsets, specifically, and on Social\nSecurity, specifically. And the only point --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the '91 Act mentions\noffsets, specifically, as well.\nMR. WOLFMAN: That's right. And -- but it\nmentions a lot of -- many meanings of \"collection,\" that\nis correct. And -- but I think it's not quite fair to say\nthat they merely reenacted the 10-year bar. We think\nthat's sufficient for us to prevail. But, you know, the\nCongress, in 1996, did a pretty comprehensive overall --\noverhaul of the Debt Collection Act. It appears to have\ngone through every section. It strengthened some of the\nnotice provisions. It focused specifically on Social\nSecurity and said that you can now offset them by making\nthe express reference. And then it turned to -- what had\nbeen subsection (c) then became subsection (e). It\namended one of the paragraphs, but retained the paragraph\nthat has the 10-year bar. So, I think it's fair to say\nthat Congress looked at all the sections carefully. Now\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If you say that -- let me just\nthrow this thought out, so you can comment on it.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me that there is a\nreasonable basis for assuming Congress might have thought\nthat student loans should not have a 10-year bar if you're\ngoing to collect from Social Security, because most Social\nSecurity payments won't accrue until many, many years --\nmuch more than 10 years after the student-loan default.\nMR. WOLFMAN: Well, that -- the Government\ncertainly makes that submission in its brief, but, as we\nnote in our reply brief, the statistics the Government\ncites don't really back that up. I -- but we do -- we do\nacknowledge that, with respect to Social Security\nretirement benefits, there will be many people who are\nbeyond the 10-year bar. With respect to people who get\nother sorts of Social Security benefits, that's not clear\nat all, actually. There are survivors --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but there is a --\nMR. WOLFMAN: -- and there are disability --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Retirement benefits are a\npretty big part --\nMR. WOLFMAN: Are a --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- of the whole package.\nMR. WOLFMAN: -- larger number, that is true.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. WOLFMAN: But, again, I don't think that --\nthere's no -- there's no suggestion in -- the problem --\nthe ultimate problem with that point for the Government,\nJustice Stevens, is that it requires us to believe that\nCongress formed that intent in 1991, which is an\nimpossibility, because --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, I understand that.\nMR. WOLFMAN: -- in 1991, Social Security\nbenefits were just, sort of, off the table. They weren't\non the radar screen at all. And that's the ultimate\nproblem with the Government's --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. --\nMR. WOLFMAN: -- theory there.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- Wolfman, are there\nprovisions by regulation in the Department of Education\nfor discharge of debts like this on a showing of total and\npermanent disability?\nMR. WOLFMAN: There are, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And your client doesn't\nqualify, or --\nMR. WOLFMAN: Well, the record is completely\nsilent on that question. I don't know the answer to that.\nHe was certainly disabled. I will only point out that\nthe standards for total and permanent disability under the\nDepartment of Education regs are much more stringent than\nthose for Social Security, because that only requires a\n12-month period of disability. But I don't know the\nanswer as to him.\nI do want to get to one other point\nbefore I sit down, and -- which is to address one of the\nGovernment's arguments -- is that to -- to get around a --\nthe problem that the DCIA reenacted the 10-year bar, the\nGovernment relies on the \"notwithstanding\" clause of the\n1991 Education Act, arguing that it wipes away any time\nbar, regardless of when the time bar was enacted, and no\nmatter what type of collection is at issue. But, as we\nnote in our reply brief extensively, those\n\"notwithstanding\" clauses are not as all-powerful as the\nGovernment suggests they are. And what the case law --\nthe lower-court case law suggests is that you need to\nlook, as we have done in our submission, at the\nlegislative history and the legislative motive surrounding\nboth Acts, the previous Act and the subsequent Act. And,\nhere, what you have -- and I don't want to beat a dead\nhorse, but I will repeat once again that the problem here\nis -- for the Government -- is that we have this very\npowerful anti-attachment provision with its express-\nreference requirement. And the only place in these\nstatutory materials where the express reference occurs is\nin a -- the very Act that includes the 10-year bar. And\nto accept the Government's argument, you would have to\naccept the notion that the -- an express reference in an\nact can go beyond the authority that's granted by that\nvery act.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, it -- I mean, you -- it's\n-- it probably comes up a lot. You have -- you have the\nearlier act that imposes -- suppose you have some --\nEndangered Species Act and -- at an earlier time -- and it\nsays all provisions of a certain kind will have this\neffect in respect to endangered species. And then you\nhave some laters act -- later acts. And, in those later\nacts, there are certain things about how to treat certain\nanimals and so forth. And the question would be, \"Well,\ndoes that earlier thing, telling you how to treat an\nendangered species, apply now to the animals in this later\nact insofar as they're endangered?\" And the answer would\nbe, \"Of course it does\" --\nMR. WOLFMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- unless there's some special\nreason --\nMR. WOLFMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- for thinking that it\ndoesn't. And so, what's the special reason --\nMR. WOLFMAN: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- here? You have an earlier\nact that says, when you see those words, \"10-year\nlimitations,\" forget them where student loans in effect.\nNow we have a later act, and it has the word \"10-year\nlimitations,\" and you're giving some reasons why --\nMR. WOLFMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- it is special and --\nMR. WOLFMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- so forth. And --\nMR. WOLFMAN: And I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- I don't know --\nMR. WOLFMAN: -- but I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- if they're --\nMR. WOLFMAN: -- but I think that that's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- strong enough --\nMR. WOLFMAN: -- that's the nub of the case --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Uh-huh. Yes, that is the nub.\nMR. WOLFMAN: -- the special reasons. But --\nbut I -- but I -- let me -- let me -- let me answer your\nquestion --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But, I mean, they don't have\nthat big burden to show. They have to just --\nMR. WOLFMAN: I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- show it's normal.\nMR. WOLFMAN: That's where I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And you have to show it's\nspecial.\nMR. WOLFMAN: I think, on these legislative\nmaterials, they have quite a burden. And let me explain\nwhy. Your -- the -- Justice Breyer, the hypothetical you\nposit is one with which I can agree. We are not saying --\nI don't want to be mistaken -- that -- we are not saying\nthat previous legislation can't have effect on future\nevents, or even future legislation. We're not saying that\nall. But the nub of our argument is this express-\nreference requirement, and I think it's -- it seems very,\nvery odd to us that when you have a statute that has an --\nwhere the express reference appears, and that has a 10-\nyear bar on the authority --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. --\nMR. WOLFMAN: -- to collect --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- Wolfman, couldn't you say\nthe question could be phrased in this way? Do we view the\nnotwithstanding language in 1091(a) as enacted in 1091 and\ngoverning the future, or do we view the 1996 amendment as,\nin effect, an amendment to that stat which -- which\nreenacted the provisions that were already there? And if\nit's a reenactment in 1996, then it's just an exception\nfrom the 10-year bar.\nMR. WOLFMAN: Right. I think that -- that is a\nfair characterization of one our arguments here --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. WOLFMAN: -- which -- one of our arguments\nhere is, given the various indicia of intent, both in '91\nand '96, that the '96 Act, with respect to a small sliver\nof collections, is effectively an amendment of the '91\nAct. However, that is not our only, or even our principal\nsubmission. Our principal submission has to do with the\npowerful anti-attachment --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right.\nMR. WOLFMAN: -- provision.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I understand.\nMR. WOLFMAN: Okay? And, again, the\nGovernment's position -- and I will rest after this,\nbecause I've repeated this already -- but the -- the\nGovernment's position is, in effect, that you can use the\nanti-attachment position in the express-reference\nrequirement in a statute to allow authority beyond that\nvery statute. And we submit that that is -- that is not\npermissible under section 407.\nUnless the Court has further questions, I'll\nreserve the rest of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Wolfman.\nMs. Blatt.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nIn sweeping and unqualified language, the Higher\nEducation Act provides that, notwithstanding any other\nprovision of law, no limitations as to time shall apply to\nthe collection of student-loan debt by offset. Therefore,\nnotwithstanding the general 10-year limit that applies to\nthe offset of all Federal payments, including Social\nSecurity payments, no time limit applies.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it didn't include Social\nSecurity payments when it was enacted.\nMS. BLATT: That's right. In 1982, Congress\nauthorized --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Or 1991. Either one.\nMS. BLATT: Right. In 1982, Federal payments\nwere subject to offsets such as Federal grants or\ncontracts or pension. And, in 1991, Congress passed a law\nthat said there's no -- going to be no time limit for the\nGovernment to collect student-loan debt by offset.\nTherefore, there has always been a student-loan exception\nto the Government's ability to offset for only up to 10\nyears. So, we can't offset Federal pension payments or\ncontract payments beyond 10 years unless it's for student\nloans.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but then -- but then, in\n-- you know, you know what's coming. You -- the provision\nyou rely on is 3116, and it's stuck into the middle of\nthis -- of a provision which requires written notice,\nopportunity to inspect records, and so forth. All those\napply. But you have to say that (e) doesn't apply.\nMS. BLATT: Well, (e) is a limitations period,\nand it is a provision of law, and the Higher Education Act\nsays, notwithstanding any other provision of law, there's\nno time limit for offsetting -- for collection by offset\nwhen it's to collect student-loan debt. What happened in\n1996 is, Congress authorized Social Security benefits as\nanother source of Federal payment. But it's critical to\nunderstand that Congress left completely undisturbed and\nintact that pre-existing 10-year limit and the pre-\nexisting student-loan exception --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But Mr. Wolfman tells us, Ms.\nBlatt, that this clause is not quite as sweeping as you\nsuggest, the clause in the 1991 Act, and points\nspecifically to provisions that say, \"no other provision\nof law enacted before, on, or after.\" The picture we're\ngiven of the 1991 Act is that up until 1991, whatever\nexists up until 1991, there's no time limitation, but that\nthis 1991 statute does not speak to subsequently enacted\nstatutes.\nMS. BLATT: Yes, well, it is unqualified, on its\nface, Justice Ginsburg. It doesn't say \"notwithstanding\nany other provision of existing law.\" It says \"any law.\"\nAnd it would be a rather bizarre and novel statute if\nCongress had to keep amending every time Congress\nredesignated a limitation provision, which is all that's\nhappened here. Every time Congress had a limitation\nprovision that changed from subsection (e) to (a), or was\ngiven a different section number, Congress would have to\ngo back and say -- I guess, reenact the Higher Education\nAct every time it amended the statute of limitations.\nBut, even if you think that it only applied to pre-\nexisting limitations period, this 10-year limit predated\nthe Higher Education Act. It was passed in 1982, and had\n-- and has appeared in identical language since 1983.\nNothing happened in 1996 to statutes of limitations. All\nthat happened was that Congress, in essence, put Social\nSecurity benefits on par, equal footing, with all other\nFederal payments.\nAnd let me just say, imposing a 10-year limit\nwould largely nullify Social Security offsets to collect\nstudent-loan debt.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The point that Justice\nStevens made --\nMS. BLATT: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- before.\nMS. BLATT: Ninety percent of all student-loan\ndebtors who default do so before age 55. And, therefore,\na 10-year time limit will have expired before the debtor\nreaches full retirement age, at age 65. And it's relevant\nnot so much what Congress what was thinking in '91, but\nit's relevant for what Congress was thinking in 1996. In\n1996, Congress made Social Security benefits subject to\noffset. And it's completely rational to think that\nCongress of course understood there would be a general 10-\nyear limit that's always been applied to offsets of all\nFederal payments, including the Federal contract payments\nor pension payments, and now Social Security payments,\nbut, yes, there's another provision of the U.S. code that\ncontains an express and, we think, extraordinary\nexception. It says time limits are intolerable when it\ncomes to the collection of student-loan debt.\nNow, at the same time, Social Security\nrecipients are protected from any undue burden. The -- if\nyou are disabled under the Department's regulations, you\ncan obtain a complete discharge, a total walk-away-from-\nthe-debt-forever, if you have a disability that prevents\nyou from earning income. You also -- the amount of the\nSocial Security offset is limited to the lesser of 15\npercent of the benefit payment or the amount by which the\nbenefit payment exceeds $750. And any debtor can enter\ninto a repayment agreement that will take their total --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Those are -- those are\nregulatory provisions, right?\nMS. BLATT: The caps, Mr. Chief Justice, are in\nthe statute, and further limited by the regulations. But,\nactually, the repayment agreements are mandated provisions\nunder the Higher Education Act. It mandates the Secretary\nof Education to allow debtors to enter in repayment\nagreements that are contingent on their income, and that\nwill allow them to repay their debt under reasonable and\naffordable terms. That's also in the statute.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, is the statute -- I saw\nsomething here, that a person who's going to get this\noffset, and he has Social Security, you exempt $9,000 of\nthe Social Security, and then you limit it to 15 percent\nof the remainder or whatever is reasonable, whichever is\nless.\nMS. BLATT: It's the lesser of -- it's the\nlesser of the 15 percent or the amount by which the\nbenefit payment exceeds 750. So, in this case, when the\noriginal Social Security check was, I think, like, $874,\n15 percent would have been a higher number. You have to\nleave the recipient with 750, so I think only $94 was\ntaken out. And I may have my math a little off. But you\n-- the -- you give the recipient the benefit.\nNow, the only thing that's in the regulations,\nMr. Chief Justice, are the disability, that that is just a\n-- it's a walkaway on the loan. Even if you win the\nlottery the next day, if you can show that you can't work\nbecause of a disability, the Secretary of Education will\ndischarge your loan.\nNow, the principal argument on the other side is\nsection 207 of the Social Security Act. Now, that statute\nrequires an explicit reference before Social Security\nbenefits can be subject to a legal process. But it\ndoesn't require an explicit reference when the only\nquestion is the statute of limitations that are applicable\nto a legal process that is already otherwise expressly\nauthorized. The Debt Collection Act is the actual statute\nthat authorizes the offset of Social Security benefits.\nThe Higher Education Act just lifts limitations periods\nwhen there's another statute that establishes a collection\nmechanism. And the Debt Collection Act contains the\nexpress reference. It provides, in 3716, that, \"We're\nmaking our clear statement, we want Social Security\nbenefits to be subject to offset.\" And, like I said, it\njust -- it plugged the Social Security system into this\npre-existing --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it is -- it is true that\nthe 1996 statute, which is the first time the express\nreference appears, does contain the 10-year statute by the\nindirect reference, and does not expressly refer to the --\ncite the 1091(a).\nMS. BLATT: That's right. It makes the express\nreference to 207, and it has this general limitations\nperiod that applies to all offsets. But, Justice Stevens,\njust --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And it says -- and it says\n\"offsets under this section.\"\nMS. BLATT: That's right. And that takes you\ndown to the subsection (e), which imposes a 10-year limit.\nBut just as today Congress certainly is free to say,\n\"From now on, Social Security benefits and all offsets\nwill be subject to an 11-year limitations period,\" it\ndoesn't have to expressly reference 207 to amend the Debt\nCollection Act. The Debt Collection Act is what's being,\nin effect, amended or an exception. And the Debt\nCollection Act doesn't contain its own express-reference\nrequirement before it can be amended. Congress didn't\nsay, \"We're forever binding ourselves,\" or, \"We want some\ndifferent canon of interpretation here.\" And so, you have\na very extraordinary provision in the Higher Education Act\nthat says, \"Notwithstanding any other provision of law,\nthere's not going to be a time limit to offset in order to\ncollect student loan\" --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But -- yeah, I think he's --\none argument that they're emphasizing, anyway, is that --\nyou look at the Debt Collection Act, and suppose it had\nsaid the following, \"Section 207 is amended, or changed,\nas follows. We refer specially now -- we can collect,\nthrough offset, but only for 10 years. I mean, only to\nclaims that are more than 10 years old. So, we are\nchanging what 207 says for debts over 10 year -- under 10\nyears old, and we can offset those.\" Now, suppose it had\nsaid that.\nMS. BLATT: It would still -- the express\nreference would be completely overtaken, because it says\nthe \"notwithstanding section 207.\" It would authorize\noffset for --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And you'd say it's the same.\nMS. BLATT: For up to 10 years.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. If that's the same,\nlet's imagine this statute. The statute says, \"We bestow\nupon the Social Security agency a very limited power.\"\nAnd it says, \"This is the limited power. The Social\nSecurity Agency may, despite 207, levy offsets on under-\n10-year-old debts.\" That's what they say, right in the\nAct.\nMS. BLATT: Right. It would -- the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And then, indeed, the whole\npoint of it -- it's entitled \"Limited Offset Ability,\"\nparenthesis -- \"Limited Offset Ability (Extending Only to\nDebts of Less than Ten Years),\" end parenthesis. That's\nthe title of the Act, and then it says just what I say,\nrepeating that.\nMS. BLATT: Yes. Well, our position is that the\nSocial Security Act only requires an express reference to\ncreate authorization to offset.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But you're not going to treat\nthat --\nMS. BLATT: And --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- one the same. You see, what\nthey're saying here is -- they want to say that what I've\njust said is what Congress wrote in this Act. And --\nMS. BLATT: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- I'm making it harder and\nharder for you to accept that saying --\nMS. BLATT: Yes. Well, our --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- automatically.\nMS. BLATT: -- fundamental position --\n-- I'll be clear on this -- is that\nthe Higher Education Act applies unless it's been\nrepealed. And there's just nothing in the Higher\nEducation Act that comes close to repealing -- in, excuse\nme, the Debt Collection Act -- that comes close to\nrepealing the Higher Education Act, because it doesn't\naddress the subject of student loans. It just speaks to\nthe ability to offset Social Security benefits, as well as\nall other Federal payments that have been subject to\noffset.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Blatt, can I ask --\nthere's no discussion -- legislative history in the briefs\nthat I -- because I -- that I recall. Is it true that the\npeople voting on the bill in 1996 had nothing but the\namendment before them? Did they have a committee report\non it explaining that it still applied to the -- that the\n-- that the \"notwithstanding\" clause in 1091(a) would\nstill be in effect?\nMS. BLATT: No, I know of no statement to that\neffect. But I know of no statement -- any discussion\nabout limitations period. There's no discussion of the\n10-year limit either.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Because it seems to me that,\nconceivably, a legislator looking at the bill all by\nitself, not getting out the earlier provisions of the\ncode, might well think, \"Well, this includes a 10-year\nlimit.\"\nMS. BLATT: Maybe they did, maybe they didn't.\nMaybe the knew that a court would actually apply the U.S.\ncode, as written --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMS. BLATT: -- and just because it -- the\nlimitation period was in one section -- but, now, here's\nwhere I think the policy does come into play. A\nlegislature would think that a 10-year limit would never\ncome in to offset Social Security benefits on student\nloan, except in a rare case of an old debtor who -- and\nalso defaults close in time to age 65. And, like I said,\n90 percent of all the student-loan defaults are by debtors\nwho are under age 55, and over -- about 83 or 84 percent\nof all Social Security payments are under the retirement\nsystem, not the disability system. And if a person is\ndisabled, there's no reason to think that they can't get a\ndischarge of that loan.\nSo, all we're talking about is basically\nrendering a dead letter Social Security offsets to collect\nstudent-loan debt, if Petitioner's position were to\nprevail.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why can he get a discharge if\nhe's disabled?\nMS. BLATT: You can get a discharge of your loan\nif you have a disability of indefinite duration that\nprevents you from working. The rationale is, sort of, a\nchanged-circumstances rationale. If you took out a loan,\nyou signed a promissory note, you intend to pay it back.\nBut if you later become disabled, and that disability is\ngoing to prevent you from ever working, they'll discharge\nit. Now, about 30 percent of all people who do apply for\nthis disability discharge do get it, and about 80 percent\nget a conditional discharge, what gives them -- it gives\nthem a 3-year grace period. And the only difference\nbetween -- I mean, there are some small differences, but\nthe main difference between a Social Security disability\ndetermination and an Education Department disability\ndetermination is the Department of Education wants you to\nbe disabled of an indefinite duration, and not just 12\nmonths, because it's a complete and total walkaway from\nthe loan. And Social Security will actually do a lookback\nafter 12 months. But Education will never go back and ask\nfor the money. Once they've discharged it, it's a\npermanent discharge.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Blatt, it -- was this\nstatute -- I'm just really kind of curious that something\nthis important, we're first putting this burden on Social\nSecurity -- it's a fairly important change. Was this part\nof one of these omnibus bills that covered 99 different\nsubjects at once?\nMS. BLATT: Yes. I --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That --\nMS. BLATT: -- I remember trying to find it on\nWestlaw. It's, like, 3,000 pages. It's --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMS. BLATT: -- huge. And it covers many, many\ndifferent subjects.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And they did not have a\nseparate committee proceeding on each separate part of\nthat monster bill --\nMS. BLATT: That --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- as I remember.\nMS. BLATT: That, I don't recall. But I can say\nthe overall thrust -- and it's in their statement of\npurpose -- was to improve the Government's debt-collection\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMS. BLATT: -- efforts. And what it did was,\nfor the first time -- and this was a very significant\ndevelopment -- establish a centralized offset. Before\n1996, there was no ability to cross-check a debt from one\nagency to a payment to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right.\nMS. BLATT: -- another agency, such that one\nDepartment had no idea what another Department was doing.\nAnd now it is a massive program involving over $1\ntrillion of Federal payables, $255 billion of certified\ndebt, and 33 billion of that is education loan debt. And\nso, that -- this was to -- an enormous undertaking to\nstart that, in 1996. And one of the things that Congress\ndid in setting up this massive program was, made Social\nSecurity benefits part of the offset program. There's\nabout $480 or $490 billion in Social Security benefits,\nso -- which -- it was a huge source of revenue, although\nCongress obviously limited it substantially with the caveat.\nAnd if there are no further questions, we would\nask that the Court of Appeals judgment be affirmed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms. Blatt.\nMr. Wolfman, you have three and a half minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN WOLFMAN\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. WOLFMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI want to address, first, a point that the\nGovernment makes, that -- and it's about Section 207 of\nthe Social Security Act, the anti-attachment provision.\nOpposing counsel says that it doesn't really matter that\nthe 10-year bar was not addressed in 1996, because all\nthat's necessary under the express-reference provision is\nto refer to the law, in general, that it doesn't apply to\nlimitations periods. But that simply cannot be the case\nhere, because, again, this statute that we are talking\nabout, the Debt Collection Improvement Act, and the Debt\nCollection Act before, is a bar on the authority of the\nGovernment to collect after 10 years.\nAnd let me pick up on the language that Justice\nKennedy pointed to from the Debt Collection Act. It says,\nin the very subsection in which Social Security first was\nput on the radar screen, was first dealt with,\n(c)(3)(a)(i) -- it says that you can now go after Social\nSecurity benefits, because they are subject to offset\nunder this section, meaning 3716. Then, if you turn to\nanother subsection of that section, it says -- and this is\nthe 10-year bar -- this section, quote, \"does not apply,\"\nend quote, to a claim under this subchapter that has been\noutstanding for more than 10 years.\nNow, I don't see any reason to say that 207, the\nrequirement of an express reference, is, sort of, a\nhalfway requirement. In other words, \"You only have to\nrefer to Social Security benefits. We don't care what the\nextent of that authority is in the very section that you\nuse that express reference.\" Here, the entire authority\nis circumscribed by the 10-year bar. That is our\nessential submission.\nI have one other point, which is that the --\nbecause there was a number of questions on it. We think\nit doesn't go to the congressional intent here, but I do\nwant to clarify. There is a substantial difference\nbetween being disabled and being eligible to get the\ndischarge. Discharge requires permanent disability --\nforever, you cannot -- you are not capable of working. In\nSocial Security law, you have to be incapable of working\nfor a period of 12 months.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\n"
