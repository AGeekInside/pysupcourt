        "content": "(10:09 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear\nargument this morning in Case 09-475, Monsanto\nCompany v. Geertson Seed Farms, et al.\nMr. Garre.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nBiotech crops have produced enormous\nbenefits for the nation's farmers and consumers. The\ndistrict court in this case issued a broad-based\ninjunction against the planting of a highly beneficial,\ngenetically engineered alfalfa crop. In entering and\nsustaining that injunction, the courts below erred in\ntwo fundamental respects.\nFirst, they short-circuited the requisite\ninquiry into the likelihood of reparable -- irreparable\nharm, because they reasoned that the agency was going to\nget into this anyway in the course of preparing its\nenvironmental impact statement. And --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Garre, the Respondents\nargue that we should dismiss the writ here as\nimprovidently granted, and I wonder if you could explain\nwhy that isn't the preferred course of conduct. They\ncontend that when this was before the Ninth Circuit,\nyour firm could have but did not contest the -- the\nvacatur of the APHIS deregulation order. It's argued\nthat an environmental impact statement is likely to be\nissued very soon, or fairly soon. Maybe the Solicitor\nGeneral could give us an estimate.\nIf we agree with your argument that the\nNinth Circuit applied the wrong preliminary injunction\nstandard and remand for them to apply the right\npreliminary injunction standard, the case may be moot by\nthe time they do that. And the alternative is for us to\nplow into the extremely fact-bound question whether\napplying what you contend to be the correct preliminary\ninjunction standard of relief would be warranted on this\nrecord.\nIn light of all that, why shouldn't we take\ntheir suggestion?\nMR. GARRE: The Court shouldn't, Justice\nAlito. First as to the vacatur, we appealed the\njudgment that contains the vacatur and the injunction.\nAnd our notice of appeal, which is on page 59 and 61 of\nthe excerpts of record in the Ninth Circuit, makes clear\nthat we explicitly appealed the vacatur as well.\nAnd let me explain that a little bit more,\nbut first I want to say as to the environmental impact\nstatement, the government can address that more, but my\nunderstanding is that we're probably about a year away\nfrom the environmental impact statement. This case\npresents important legal issues concerning the entry of\ninjunctive relief.\nWe think the Court properly granted\ncertiorari and should decide those issues. We think\nthat, although the record is large, that this Court can\ndecide, as it did in Winter, that as a matter of law\nthis record does not support a finding of irreparable\nharm.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But Winter didn't involve\nsomething -- as I understand, the -- the decision\nvacated the deregulation order. You are not challenging\nthat. Well, it seems to me if there's no deregulation\ndecision in place, then we're back to the Plant\nProtection Act, and there's no authorization for the\nplanting of these crops. So as long as you haven't\nchallenged the vacation of the deregulation decision, I\ndon't see how there's anything for us to deal with.\nMR. GARRE: We did appeal the vacatur as\nwell as the injunction which is contained as part of the\nsame judgment. We know that the district --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: However, you haven't in\nyour brief. Didn't you say you weren't challenging the\nvacating order? You keep saying -- I know you appealed\nit originally, but the point is that you didn't seek\ncertiorari on that ground.\nMR. GARRE: Well, we -- our argument all\nalong, Justice Sotomayor has been that the court, the\ndistrict court, erred in not adopting the government's\nproposed judgment. If you look on page 184 of the\npetition appendix, that proposed judgment makes clear\nthat it's intended to replace the district court's\njudgment, including the vacatur. So all along the whole\nargument about --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You agree that those\nare two different things, then, right? The vacatur is\none thing and the injunction is another, right?\nMR. GARRE: They are part and parcel of the\nsame judgment. It's true, a vacatur is different than\nan injunction. But here --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And under the\nvacatur, the normal APA remedy is a remand to the agency.\nIn fact, there are some courts that say you can't get\nanything else. But whether you can or can't, it's clear\nthat the burden is on you to get something short of\ncomplete remand. The burden is on your friends to\nget -- establish the injunction.\nThe problem with combining the two, it seems\nto me, is that you are imposing on them the burden to\nmeet the injunction standard simply to get a remand to\nwhich they are entitled under the APA.\nMR. GARRE: Well, the district court could\nhave vacated the order in its entirety and send it back\nto the agency. It didn't do that. It not only went\nahead and enjoined the planting of RRA, Roundup Ready\nalfalfa, but --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the vacatur does\nthat. You can't plant once the deregulation order is\nvacated.\nMR. GARRE: The vacatur was in part. We\nknow that because the district court's judgment allowed\nthe continued planting and harvesting of Roundup Ready\nalfalfa, the planting before 2007. But --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you would say\nthat the injunction is limited only to a decision the\nagency might make to allow partial planting?\nMR. GARRE: Well -- and importantly, the district\ncourt's judgment -- and it's on page 108 of the petition\nappendix --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMR. GARRE: -- not only enjoined the planting\nof Roundup Ready alfalfa, it enjoined the agency from taking\ninterim measures. It --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMR. GARRE: We --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. Why\ndid it do that? I mean, the way the APA works, this is\nsent back to the agency. If the agency wants to\npartially deregulate, it can do it. And then you can\nchallenge it under the normal APA procedures.\nMR. GARRE: And that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's very odd to get\nan injunction to an agency telling them they can't do\nsomething under the APA.\nMR. GARRE: Well, I'm not going to disagree\nwith you on that. It is important that they enjoined\nthe agency from implementing the very proposed measures\nthat we're now finding -- fighting --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm looking at --\nMR. GARRE: -- in the context of an\ninjunction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm looking at page 58a.\nMaybe that -- you referred to what as the district\ncourt's --\nMR. GARRE: 108a. It's 108a of the petition\nappendix.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Because I thought that\nthe only purpose of this injunctive provision was to\nspare the people who had already purchased seeds,\nallowing those to be planted until March 30, 2007.\nMR. GARRE: Planting was allowed until\nMarch 30, 2007, and then that alfalfa could be continued\nto be harvested; seeds would be harvested and maintained\nseparately.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And is it your position that\nthat gives you the hook, the entry point, for saying,\nwell, now the district judge didn't just replicate in\nall respects the universe without the regulation; it had\nsome specific injunctive relief, and it didn't go far\nenough? That's --\nMR. GARRE: Absolutely. That in combination\nwith the fact that it actually enjoined the agency from\nwhat it could have done, otherwise done, under --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But whose --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What authority do\nyou have for the proposition that when a court vacates\nan administrative order, it has the authority to tailor\nan injunction rather than simply remand the matter to\nthe agency?\nMR. GARRE: Well, I think this Court's\ndecision in Weinberger involved at least an analogous\nsituation, where the court found a statutory violation\nof the Clean Water Act. It doesn't involve the vacatur\nof a decision, but the court then went on to add an\ninjunction on top of that. So you had the statutory\nviolation that arguably prohibited the conduct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess --\nWeinberger, of course, involved a statute. I mean, the\nconcern is that the authority to determine how far to go\nin deregulating or partial deregulating is for the\nagency to make. And once there has been a violation of\nthe APA, it goes back to the agency. What the district\ncourt did here was assume that responsibility itself.\nMR. GARRE: And we at the outset at the\ndistrict court stage, if the -- if the district court had\ndone that, that would have been fine. It could have gone\nback. The agency could have adopted the very proposed\nmeasures that we're now talking about in the context of\nan injunction. The district court did not do that. It\nentered the injunction not only as to the sale of RRA,\nbut as to the agency taking --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, then --\nMR. GARRE: -- those interim steps.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Garre, I'm looking at\nthe injunction, and it says that the deregulation decision\nis vacated and Roundup Ready alfalfa is once again a\nregulated article. We could simply say as far as it goes,\nthat's all right; anything else is surplusage. We take it\nto be the judgment that Roundup Ready alfalfa is once again\na regulated article, period.\nMR. GARRE: And we know the district court\ndidn't mean that literally, because its own judgment\nallows the continued planting and harvesting of RRA\nplanted before --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, but I thought --\nMR. GARRE: -- March 2007.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that was just a\ndispensation to people who had already bought the seeds.\nThat was recognizing that they had incurred an expense,\nthat they were all ready to plant. That -- that was the\nonly exception. It goes back to the status of a regulated\narticle with this one exception.\nMR. GARRE: Well, if it's a regulated\narticle, then there's no use of it allowed at all unless\nthe agency is granting exceptions. So the district\ncourt's grant of that exception was an exercise of\nits equitable authority in the context of considering\nRespondents' injunction.\nRespondents have litigated this all along as\nthough the injunction provided something in addition to\nthe vacatur, and this Court's cases establish that the\ninjunction is an extraordinary and drastic remedy that\ndoes. It allows people to go into court to enforce it.\nIt provides an opportunity for contempt sanctions.\nIf I could just -- if I could address the\nissue of irreparable harm, there are two key things the\nCourt -- we hope the Court will understand in\nadjudicating the question of irreparable harm.\nFirst is you need to separate out hay\nproduction and seed production. There's absolutely no\nevidence in this record whatsoever of any\ncross-pollination from RRA hay fields to another hay\nfield. So the district court's injunction applies\nbroad-based to hay production and seed production. But\nat a minimum, we think you have to take seed production\nout.\nThe next thing is that, when it comes to the\nrisk of harm --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Hay production out.\nMR. GARRE: When alfalfa is grown for hay, for\nforage, as opposed to grown for seeds which can then be\nplanted.\nThe next thing to know is what we're talking\nabout here is the risk that -- and Roundup Ready alfalfa\nwill appear in a conventional or organic alfalfa field.\nWe're not talking about transforming a single alfalfa\nplant in the country. It's the risk that an existing\nalfalfa plant will produce a seed, which will then\nproduce another alfalfa plant which would be a Roundup\nReady alfalfa plant. So not a single alfalfa plant\nin this country is going to be harmed by the addition of\nRoundup Ready alfalfa.\nThe district court found, on page 43 of the\npetition appendix, that Roundup Ready alfalfa provides no\nharm the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me what's\nthe legal error? You started by identifying the first\none, which was short-circuiting the irreparable harm.\nThis seems more like factual correction which you're\ngetting into. Put it into a legal box for me. What are\nyour legal claims?\nMR. GARRE: Sure. There's three legal\narguments we have, Justice Sotomayor. The first is the\ndistrict court short-circuited the whole analysis by\nassuming up front that, since this was going to go to\nenvironmental impact statement, it didn't have to\nseriously get into the likelihood of irreparable harm.\nAnd we think that that's clear error under this Court's\nAmoco decision. And, in fact, if you look at --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you explain,\nMr. Garre, why that's so, because I thought that the\nFederal law is before the agency engages in an action\nthat requires an EIS, it has to do the EIS? So this\nunit of the Department of Agriculture violated Federal\nlaw by deregulating prior to the completion of an EIS.\nMR. GARRE: Federal law and the regulation\nat 40 C.F.R. 1506.1(a) allows action to go forward where\nthere's not an adverse environmental impact. The\nagency has explained in great detail in declarations\nthat allowing the very limited use of RRA under the\nrestricted conditions of the proposed injunctions would\nnot result in any environmental impact.\nIf I could reserve the remainder of my time\nfor rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Garre.\nMr. Stewart.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART,\nON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESPONDENTS,\nSUPPORTING PETITIONERS\nMR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI'd like first to address briefly\nJustice Alito's question about the length of time that\nthe agency anticipates the EIS will take. The agency\nnow anticipates that its best estimate is that the EIS\nwill be ready approximately a year from now. A draft\nEIS has been submitted for public comment. The public\ncomment period was extended until early March of 2010.\nThe agency has received on the order of 145,000 public\ncomments.\nAnd, so, in addition to parsing through\nthose and seeing which of them need to be responded to,\nthe agency wants to consult with other Federal agencies.\nAnd, so this process is going to take longer than APHIS\nhad anticipated at the outset.\nNow, we said in our brief in opposition that\nthe fact that the EIS process was ongoing was a reason\nfor this Court to deny certiorari. I think regardless\nof how good an argument that was at the cert stage, the\nCourt has granted cert, and we think that the Court\nshould decide the case. There's no realistic prospect\nthat the case will become moot before this Court's\ndecision is rendered.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you go to the\nsecond part of Justice Alito's question, which was the\nissue of standing, both yours and the Petitioners'.\nWhat is it exactly that we're being asked to review?\nObviously, you're going ahead with the EIS. You\nhaven't sought a stay of that.\nMR. STEWART: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So what's the\nbasis of the challenge to the injunction?\nMR. STEWART: When the district court issued\nits summary judgment ruling, it asked the parties to\npropose their own forms of a judgment. And APHIS might\nhave done what the Chief Justice suggested ought to have\nbeen done; that is, it might have indicated that the\ncourt -- that either it should simply issue a\ndeclaratory judgment or that it should vacate the\nderegulation order, and the matter would have been\nremanded to the agency to decide what to do next.\nAnd if that had happened, the agency could\nthen have issued an administrative order that embodied\nthe same proposed conditions that were embodied in the\ninjunction. Presumably, the plaintiffs would have\nchallenged that, and we would have had a new lawsuit.\nNow, what APHIS tried to do, in essence, was\nto streamline the process by combining into one steps\nthat could otherwise have been taken separately. And it\nproposed an injunction that said the deregulation\ndecision is vacated and replaced by the following\nprotective conditions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have the burden\nto establish your entitlement to those conditions that\nare short of a remand, correct?\nMR. STEWART: I don't think it would have\nbeen our burden; that is, if the -- if the order had\nsimply been -- the deregulation order had simply been\nvacated and remanded to the agency, and the agency had\nthen performed the analysis that's reflected in the\nHoffman declarations and said we are putting in place a\ncomplete deregulation --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure, sure.\nAgencies can do that.\nMR. STEWART: Agencies can do that. And it --\non review of that, it would not have been our burden to\nestablish that those --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, sure, because\n-- but here the question is whether the court can do\nthat. The court is stepping into the shoes of the\nagency. And I would say it's -- I mean, there's\nauthority that you can't do that at all, but certainly\nyou'd have the burden to establish that those\nreliefs short of remand, that you are entitled to that.\nMR. STEWART: I think in the ordinary\ncourse, you're absolutely correct. And in the usual\ncase, it's an important principle to us that the court\nshould not usurp the agency's role.\nHere I think, in fairness to the district\ncourt, if the court had issued the injunction we\nproposed with the protective measures that were\nreflected in the government's proposed judgment, the\ncourt would not have been usurping the agency's role,\nbecause it would have been adopting the very protective\nmeasures that the agency identified as appropriate. So\nwe think that the district --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you're\nshort-circuiting notice and comment or whatever else is\nrequired, the reason we send this to an agency, because\nthey are expert and all that. The agency is acting\nwithout the benefit of any input on the partial\nderegulation.\nMR. STEWART: Well, it is certainly acting\nwith the benefit of whatever information it received in\nthe form of public comment in its original environmental\nassessment for the complete deregulation. And in\naddition, the district court, in deciding whether the\nagency's proposed conditions would have been appropriate\ncould have entertained comments from obviously the\nRespondents and from anyone else who wanted to\nintervene.\nBut to go back to Justice Sotomayor's --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you have -- let's\njust -- if this had -- if the order had vacated the\nderegulation and sent it back to you, what would you\nhave -- the agency have had to do to issue temporary\nregulations consistent with the ones you proposed to the\ndistrict court?\nMR. STEWART: Our view is that, first, that\nwe would not have had to go through public notice and\ncomment, because, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(2), there is an\nexception for good cause, and here the relatively\nlimited timeframe that we were talking about in our view\nwould have constituted good cause. Obviously, the\nplaintiffs might have challenged that.\nNow, we would have had to perform some sort\nof environmental analysis to comply with our NEPA\nobligations in order to feel sufficient confident --\nconfidence that implementation of our proposed measures\nwould not cause significant environmental impacts. It\nwouldn't have had to be an EIS; that is, NEPA provides,\nin appropriate circumstances --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can -- when you -- can\nyou stop right there, because I thought the law was,\ngovernment agency, before you engage on a major\nactivity, EIS first, and then you can have a\nderegulation order?\nMR. STEWART: I think that's -- it is\ncorrect to say that, as a matter of the statute and the\nregulations, an agency cannot decide to prepare an EIS on\na particular act, decision, and then implement that very\ndecision during the pendency of the EIS.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, that's what I\nthought.\nMR. STEWART: But our -- our core point here\nis that what we were proposing for the interim, that is\nallowing continued planting subject to various\nprotective measures, was fundamentally different from\nthe action on which the EIS was being prepared. That\nis --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But as far as the court\nis concerned, it's conceded that NEPA was violated, an\nEIS was required. And then the district court vacates\nthe deregulation decision. I thought that, under the APA,\nat that point, the court is obliged to say, well, the\nagency engaged in conduct that was not in accord with\nlaw, and so we send it back.\nMR. STEWART: You are correct. And we are\nnot asserting the right to implement the deregulation\ndecision; that is, the decision removing all Federal\nconstraints from the planting and harvesting of RRA.\nWe're not asserting the right to do that during the\npendency of the EIS process.\nThe CEQ regulations speak to this question,\nand they don't say while an EIS is ongoing, no activity\nrelated to the action for which the EIS is being\nprepared may go forward. They say in the interim the\nagency can't do things that will have an adverse\nenvironmental impact or will foreclose reasonable\nalternatives.\nSo, what the agency might have done at the\noutset was say: We need to do an EIS before implementing\na complete deregulation decision. The effects of doing\nthat are at least potentially sufficiently great that an\nEIS is being prepared. However, we feel confident that\ninterim planting during this limited period, subject to\nthese proposed protective measures, will not have\nadverse environmental impact --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you -- do you\nagree that when you're talking about the elements of\nthe injunction that are short of remand to the agency,\nthat the Respondents do not have the obligation to meet\nthe injunction standards with respect to those? In\nother words, it's part of the judgment. It's not an\ninjunction, and you have the burden if you want the\ncourt to do anything other than send it back.\nMR. STEWART: I hope I didn't misunderstand\nthe question. If you're referring to the types of\nactivities that would have been prohibited even under\nour proposed injunction; that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I'm talking to\nthe -- about the types of activities that would be\nprohibited if the court just remanded it back, vacated\nit, which is everything -- you can't plant.\nMR. STEWART: No, I think in order for\nthe -- the plaintiffs to get an injunction against\nthose, they would have had to meet --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess my point is\nthey don't need an injunction. The thing that's\nbothering me is you've got two different things, the\nvacatur and the injunction. And it seems to me by melding\nthem together, you're trying to impose the burden on\nthe plaintiffs to meet the injunction standard to get\nthe benefit of the vacatur.\nMR. STEWART: Well, I think if this had\nhappened through the alternative events -- course of\nevents that I discussed previously; that is, if the\nmatter had been remanded back to the agency and the\nagency had issued an administrative order that embodied\nthese proposed protective conditions, then the\nplaintiffs would presumably have either filed a new\nlawsuit or challenged this within the confines of this\nsuit. The burden would have been on them to show both\nthat those protective measures were --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you short-circuited\nthat. Isn't this more akin to you seeking a stay of the\nvacating order?\nMR. STEWART: Well, I think --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The district court\nvacated the deregulation. No one can plant. You and\nthe Petitioners go into court and say to the court:\nStay that deregulation with respect to this kind of\nplanting. Aren't you the one seeking the stay? And if\nso, isn't it your burden to show that you're entitled to\nwhatever it is you seek?\nMR. STEWART: Well, all that the court had\ndecided up to the point when we submitted our proposed\njudgment was that an EIS was needed before the agency\ncould implement complete deregulation. And I think in\nthis respect the case is similar to Winter; that is, in\nWinter in the district court -- the district court\ninitially imposed six restrictive measures on the Navy,\nand the Navy elected not to challenge four of them but\nchallenged the other two. I suppose that the Navy could\nhave asked for, in a sense, vacatur of its proposed\naction and then announced a new action that consisted of\ncompliance with the four unchallenged restrictive\nmeasures and noncompliance with the other two.\nFrom our perspective, rather than\nshort-circuiting the process, as I say, we were trying\nto streamline it; that is, the court could have sent it\nback to us, we could have told it what protective\nmeasures were appropriate, and then some months later we\nwould have been back in court to review the adequacy of\nthose, particularly because we thought of the -- any\ninjunction as being something that would stay in effect\nonly for the relatively limited period of time while the\nEIS was being prepared.\nWe tried to speed up the process by telling\nthe court in advance these are the protective measures\nwe think are appropriate without the need for a remand.\nAnd the court's fundamental error was in equating what\nwe had proposed with the complete deregulation that was\nthe subject of the lawsuit. I think that the -- the\nagency's declarations explained why the protective\nmeasures that were embodied in the government's proposed\ninjunction would have been fully sufficient to prevent\nirreparable harm to the plaintiffs during the pendency\nof the EIS.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So that's the legal\nerror you identify?\nMR. STEWART: That's the legal error we\nidentify. We also think that the district court did,\nwithout quite using these words, announce a presumption\nin favor of injunctive relief; that is, the district\ncourt said, wrongly in our view, that it couldn't assess\nthe adequacy of the proposed protective measures because\nthat would duplicate the analysis that was going on in\nthe EIS. We think that was --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you agree -- would\nyou agree that if the district court had just said the\nderegulating decision is vacated and Roundup Ready\nalfalfa is once again a regulated article, period, that\nwould be okay? And you would have no basis to prevent\nthis from going straight back to the agency?\nMR. STEWART: I think the district court\ncould have done that and, as I say, if -- if the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And all, it seems to me,\nthat the district court did do in addition to that is to\nsay that alfalfa seeds may be planted -- alfalfa seeds\nthat are -- that have already been purchased may be\nplanted prior to March 30, 2007.\nMR. STEWART: If it --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's the only exception.\nMR. STEWART: It didn't just say that. In\nits judgment, which I believe is at page 108a of the\npetition appendix -- and Mr. Garre referred to this\npreviously -- it said in addition that the agency is\nenjoined from deregulating even in part genetically\nengineered alfalfa.\nSo the district court didn't simply vacate\nthe -- the deregulation order and send it back to the\nagency to decide whether some interim protective\nmeasures would be appropriate. It said the agency can't\ndo anything while the EIS is being prepared to allow the\nplanting or harvesting of RRA except to the limited\nextent that the district court was authorizing with\nrespect to already planted alfalfa.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And in your view the\ncorrectness of that ruling has been preserved in the\nquestions presented to this Court?\nMR. STEWART: Yes, I think -- yes, I think\nabsolutely. Because the fundamental controversy both in\nthe court of appeals and in this Court has been not\nwhether an injunction should have been entered at all.\nFor better or for worse, I think both the Petitioners\nand the government have acquiesced in the entry of some\nform of injunction. The controversy has been, should\nthe district court have entered the government's proposed\ninjunction instead of the one that it actually entered?\nAnd clearly if the proposed injunction had been entered\ninstead, the Petitioners would have been better off\nbecause there would have been a continued market for\ntheir seed to planters who wanted to grow RRA in\ncompliance with the proposed protective measures.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's a little\ndifferent than answering Justice Kennedy's question,\nwhich is: Did you preserve the issue that the district\ncourt exceeded its jurisdiction in stopping you from\nfurther deregulation? That's a different question than\nwhether or not it should have granted your further\ninjunction which is, according to you, a further\nderegulation. But it's a different question.\nMR. STEWART: I'm not sure to what extent\nthe Petitioners or -- or the government, frankly, have\nfocused precisely on that particular language of the\ndistrict court's judgment. But it has certainly been\nkind of the fundamental basis for our appeal to the\ncourt of appeals and for Petitioners' appeal and\ncertiorari petition that what they are complaining about\nwas the fact that a complete injunction was put in\nplace, instead of an injunction that embodied the\ngovernment's proposed protective measures, and we were\nfocusing on the choice between two injunctions.\nWe didn't focus specifically on the\nalternative course of action in which the matter might\nhave been sent back to the agency and the agency would\nthen have embodied those proposed protective measures in\nan administrative order. But I think the issue whether\nthose protective measures would have been sufficient to\nprevent irreparable harm to the plaintiffs has been\npreserved throughout.\nJust to say one more thing about the CEQ\nregulations, this Court has held in the past that those\nare entitled to deference, and, again, they don't preclude\nall action during the pendency of the EIS.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Stewart.\nMr. Robbins.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE S. ROBBINS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. ROBBINS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nIn our view, Petitioners lack standing to\nbring this case to this Court. By failing to challenge\nthe lawfulness of the deregulation vacatur either in the\nNinth Circuit or in this Court, Petitioners have an\ninsurmountable redressability problem. They cannot get\nthe practical relief they seek even in the event that\nthis Court vacates or narrows the injunction, and that\nis because the vacatur about which they said not one\nsingle sentence in the Ninth Circuit or in their opening\nbrief or in their questions presented -- that is because\nthe vacatur, which they never have challenged, had the\nunambiguous effect of reregulating RRA.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if the injunction\ndoesn't do anything, why are you bothering to defend it?\nMR. ROBBINS: Well, we're -- we're\ndefending it on the alternative ground,\nMr. Chief Justice, that we have not persuaded you on our\nthreshold question that there -- that there is a lack of\nstanding. If, for -- I mean, they've made various\narguments as to why they have standing, and I'm going to\naddress them in a minute. But, you know, there's always\na chance we're going to lose on that question --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ROBBINS: -- and -- and although I don't\nthink we ought to, we thought it would be prudent to say\nsomething about the merits.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Robbins, can I ask you\nabout your clients' standing? What individual plaintiff\nhere stood to be harmed by what the agency had done? Which\none of them was -- was within, what, 5 miles of any --\nany field of the genetically engineered alfalfa?\nMR. ROBBINS: Well, the answer is that there\nare a great many plaintiffs who put in declarations,\nlitigated this issue, and prevailed, and there was no\nappeal from it. For example, in the courtroom today,\nMr. Pat Trask from western South Dakota, a hay and -- a\nconventional hay and seed farmer, who alleged, put in\nproof, that he stood -- if the deregulation went forward\nwithout any injunction, he stood to -- a risk of\ncross-pollination and contamination.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What? From what? From\nwhat? From --\nMR. ROBBINS: From --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: From somebody within 5\nmiles, 10 miles, 20 miles?\nMR. ROBBINS: Well, we have to be clear,\nYour Honor. What -- what -- what was enjoined was the\nfuture proliferation of this product, where the\npresident of the company told the district court: If\nyou let us continue to \"introduce,\" in the words of the\nstatute, this product, we're already at 220,000 acres;\nwe will become a million acres, a fivefold increase. And\nthat was on the assumption that the EIS would take only\n2 years. It's since been 3 years, and now I hear it's\ngoing to be a fourth year.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you want the Court to\nassume that somebody is going to be planting a field of\nthe genetically engineered alfalfa within, what, 5 miles\nof --\nMR. ROBBINS: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- one of your named\nplaintiffs?\nMR. ROBBINS: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The fact is there isn't a\nsingle named plaintiff who -- who has -- has any claim\nthat within the utmost limits of -- of risk, he is at\nrisk currently.\nMR. ROBBINS: Well, let me be clear. We\nhave organizational clients who have -- whose members --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that. But you\nhave to bring in a member from that organization --\nMR. ROBBINS: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- who is concretely\nharmed.\nMR. ROBBINS: And we've put in declarations\nin the district court, multiple declarations from those\nmembers and from Mr. Geertson, the seed -- conventional\nseed farmer from Idaho, and Mr. Trask from South Dakota.\nBut, Your Honor, let me -- let me, without begging the\nquestion -- I actually think -- I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Am I factually correct\nthat the harm is that from some seed-grown alfalfa, a bee\nor the wind is going to take the pollen and put it into\na conventional field?\nMR. ROBBINS: That is one of the risks. But\nwhat makes this case --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But is that -- am I\nright?\nMR. ROBBINS: Yes. One of the risks is\ncross-pollination.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How many States grow\nalfalfa to seed as opposed to letting it just grow into\nhay?\nMR. ROBBINS: Most of the seed production is\nin the -- is in the Pacific Northwest and the West.\nThere's a handful of States.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So that handful of\nStates --\nMR. ROBBINS: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- is that where the\nrisk exists?\nMR. ROBBINS: No. Oh, no, no. The risk\nwas demonstrated at different levels and to different\ndegrees both in the hay-producing States and in the\nseed-producing States.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You just said the word\n\"different levels and different degrees,\" but this is an\nall-size-fit injunction.\nMR. ROBBINS: Yes. Because, as I --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how is that\nreasonable when the risk is different depending on the\nplace and type of growth?\nMR. ROBBINS: Well, there are different\nkinds of risks. And I am happy to turn to the\nirreparable harm point, Your Honor, of the proposition\nthat the risk must be sufficiently likely, which by the\nway, does not mean more likely than not, a suggestion\nmade in the reply brief. No court has ever said so.\n\"Sufficiently likely\" talks in terms of the nature of\nthe harm.\nHere, whether you are growing hay or whether\nyou are growing alfalfa for seed, there is a\nsufficiently likely risk not only of cross-pollination\nor all the other ways that contamination happens --\nthrough dropping seeds, through seed mixing, through\ncustom cutting, through missing ends of fields --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I ask you\nsomething? Is that because your farmers -- I understood\nfarmers of hay had huge tracts of land. Do they rent\nequipment from someone else to do it?\nMR. ROBBINS: They often do. There's\ncustom cutting where you can't -- you know, you don't\nown the equipment. You hire a custom cutter who may be\ncutting an RRA field today and your field tomorrow. And\nthe -- the risk -- and this is all in the record -- the\nrisk of a seed contaminating another seed or getting\ninto a hay field is easily sufficiently likely to not\nconstitute an abuse of discretion.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you don't think the\nfree market would produce companies that advertise: We\nonly cut natural seed fields?\nMR. ROBBINS: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't think that\nwould happen? I am sure it would happen.\nMR. ROBBINS: Well, the -- well, the record,\nJustice Scalia, before the district court does not tell\nus one way or the other, but the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Robbins, is it -- is\nit relevant to that, that in the case of other\ngenetically engineered crops -- sugar beets, for\nexample, soybeans -- that the plantings became\noverwhelmingly the genetically engineered, rather than\nthe organic or natural?\nMR. ROBBINS: Well, I think it's relevant to\none of the categories of harms that we think is\ncognizable for purposes of an injunction, and that is\nthe effect on consumer choice and producer choice to be\nin a non-GMO business. And --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I mean, in response to\nJustice Scalia's point of how many now, how many at this\nmoment? But you projected that there would be an\nenormous increase, and that was not just pulled out of\nthin air. I assume it had something to do with what\nhappened to other crops.\nMR. ROBBINS: Oh, it's -- it's -- not only,\nJustice Ginsburg, is it not pulled out of thin air, we're\ntaking their word for it. Their president, FGI's\npresident, said: We anticipate a fivefold increase from\n220,000 acres to a million. And that was on the premise\nthat the EIS was --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just -- I'm sorry to\ninterrupt. Just from the seeds blowing in the wind?\nMR. ROBBINS: No, from a range of\ncontaminating sources. It's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I am really losing you now.\nI thought he was referring to the number of farmers who\nwould be planting and harvesting genetically engineered\nalfalfa. Isn't that -- farmers who wanted to do it. He\nwas saying: We now have 200,000; we are going to have a\nmillion.\nMR. ROBBINS: Well, no; I'm talking about\nacreage, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right. Acreage, whatever.\nHe's talking about acreage of farmers who plant and want to\nplant --\nMR. ROBBINS: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- genetically engineered seed.\nMR. ROBBINS: Correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He's not talking about how\nmany unwilling farmers are going to have infected\nfields.\nMR. ROBBINS: No, I -- I understand.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. ROBBINS: But the -- but the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I'm not sure\nwe understood.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ROBBINS: But I took -- I took\nJustice Ginsburg's question to be asking: What was\nthe -- the relevant risk that the district court had to\nconsider for purposes of irreparable harm? And\ncertainly one factor which powerfully distinguishes this\ncase from the Court's decision in Winter is that,\nwhereas the Navy had been running these exercises for\nsome 40 years and there was a well-developed track\nrecord as a consequence, here this is a new technology\nthat was about to spread at least fivefold over 2 years.\nBut I -- I do want to get back to the -- to\nwhat I think is the insurmountable problem that the --\nthat the Petitioners have on the issue of standing, because\nI heard Mr. Garre say this morning in answer to one of the\nCourt's questions that the -- that the notice of appeal\nrecited the vacatur as part of the notice of appeal.\nThat is true. That is because the notice of appeal,\nlike most notices of appeal that lawyers file, simply\nquoted the judgment.\nBut when you get to the papers -- the\nbriefs, the questions presented, the argument, the oral\nargument, the questions presented in this Court, the\nopening brief, there is not a single word saying that\nthe vacatur was wrong. And that's important because,\nas I believe the Chief Justice was adverting before, the\nvacatur does not -- is not governed by the same\ninjunctive standards.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that -- there's\na flip side of that that is not so good for you, because\none of the things you want from the injunction is a\nprohibition on the agency partially deregulating. Well,\nyou're not entitled to that, because the vacatur sends\nit -- should send it back to the agency and they can\ndecide. And if they decide to partially deregulate, you\nhave the APA challenges available to you.\nMR. ROBBINS: I -- I think,\nMr. Chief Justice, there is some considerable force to\nthe point that the injunction in that respect exceeded\nthe scope of the vacatur. And it may be -- it may be\nthat they have standing only to challenge so much of the\ninjunction as exceeds the scope of the vacatur, but\nthat's not what they want. What they want is to do all\nthe planting that the vacatur says they may not.\nAnd so I --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your argument is\nthat the district court judge made a mistake in mixing\nup the vacatur and the injunction?\nMR. ROBBINS: I would put it slightly\ndifferently.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ROBBINS: I would say that the mistake\nthat was made was in not appreciating, though it was\ncalled to his attention by the lawyers I -- by the party\nI represent, that the vacatur did have this effect.\nI do think that the injunction was sort of\nallowed to be litigated. There were many reasons why\nthey litigated the injunction. We, for example, wanted\na more demanding injunction --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But isn't one of the\nreasons that they litigated the injunction was that by\nits terms and because of its issuance the agency on\nremand could not have adopted some partial measures to\nallow controlled planting?\nMR. ROBBINS: Yes. That is a reason why my\nclients sought the injunction. They sought -- they\nsought other things in the injunction as well, but --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- no, but isn't\nthat -- isn't that the reason that the manufacturers,\nMonsanto, contested the injunction? They said --\nbecause once the injunction is issued, as the\ngovernment has told us today, they cannot issue some\npartial regulatory scheme with -- with safeguards.\nMR. ROBBINS: There is -- that's doubtless\none reason why they litigated the injunction, but it is\nnot a reason, Justice Kennedy, that they have standing,\nbecause vacating the current injunction will give them\nnothing that they -- that they -- that isn't already\nprohibited by the vacatur, except -- and I grant you\nthis -- it will allow them to go back to the agency,\nseek a partial deregulation, which Mr. Stewart told --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that -- but that is\nsubstantial. It takes time, and the district court\ninjunction that's now in effect prohibits that. And\nthey have standing to challenge that.\nMR. ROBBINS: Well, I'm not --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Or at least that's their\nargument.\nMR. ROBBINS: That is their argument, but it\nisn't right, and here's why: One of the standing\nrequirements is imminence, that it must be an actual\nharm or an imminent harm. Now, here are the things that\nwould have to happen for that scenario to come to pass:\nIt would have to be remanded to the agency. Mr. Stewart\ntold us this morning there would have to be at least an\nenvironmental -- an EA prepared, that may or may not\ncome out in favor of a partial deregulation. There\nwould then be --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't mean to\ninterrupt your answer, but they've already done an EA\nin support of total deregulation, presumably, and they\nfound no adverse -- presumably, that would be a fortiori\nfor partial.\nMR. ROBBINS: Well, we don't know. I heard\nMr. Stewart, who speaks for the government, tell us that\nit would require additional steps. But this Court's\nimminence cases, you know, can't -- do not accommodate\nthis many if's.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me pretty\ndoggone imminent if the agency has come before the court\nand said: This kind of partial deregulation ought to be\nallowed, and we're in favor of it. I mean, you are not\nsending it back to an agency that's a blank slate. You\nknow that the agency favors this degree of deregulation.\nMR. ROBBINS: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean -- I'd -- you\nknow, I -- boy, I'd take a remand to the agency any\nday.\nMR. ROBBINS: Well, I can -- I can tell you,\nYour Honor, maybe the best authority I could give you on\nhow imminent this is, how -- whether it really meets this\nCourt's standings tests, here's what Petitioners said\nabout this exact scenario when they were in the court of\nappeals: They said that the prospect of a future grant\nof partial deregulation is, quote, \"a hypothetical NEPA\ncontroversy,\" end quote, that, quote, \"rests upon\ncontingent future events that may not occur as\nanticipated or, indeed, may not occur at all.\"\nI take that to be the very definition of\nwhat is not imminent for purposes of this Court's\nstanding cases.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could I go back to\nsomething you said a while ago, that \"likely\" does not\nmean more likely than not?\nMR. ROBBINS: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's -- I thought\nthat would be obvious. If I say your friends are likely\nto win, that means they are more likely than you.\nMR. ROBBINS: Well, I -- I -- you know, I\nthink the -- the answer is contextual, but in this\ncontext, \"likely\" for purposes of an injunction,\nMr. Chief Justice, has I think never been understood to\nmean more likely than not.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have -- I --\nI was surprised that this apparently hasn't been decided\nover the however many years we've had this standard.\nIs there a case that says \"likely\" does not mean more\nlikely than not?\nMR. ROBBINS: No. But there are cases -- I\nmean, the issue has not been addressed by this Court one\nway or the other. I would say City of Los Angeles v.\nLyons and the Amoco case both used the phrase\n\"sufficiently likely,\" and the lower courts have\nunderstood that to mean sufficiently likely in light of\nthe nature of the harm.\nConsider, if we were talking about the\nprobability of the contamination of the water supply of\nNew York City, would anybody suppose that the -- if the\nprobability were 10 percent rather than 50.9 percent,\nthat no one could go into court and get an injunction?\nNeither the private litigants -- you know, put them to\none side. The government's own authority to obtain\ninjunctive relief would be critically hampered if such\nan order came about, and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This isn't contamination of\nthe New York City water supply. It's the creation of\nplants of -- of genetically engineered alfalfa which\nspring up that otherwise wouldn't exist. It doesn't\neven destroy the current plantings of non-genetically\nengineered alfalfa. This is not the end of the world.\nIt really isn't.\nThe most it does is make it difficult for\nthose farmers who want to cater to the European market,\nwhich will not accept genetically engineered alfalfa.\nIt makes it more difficult for them to have a field of\n100 percent non-genetically engineered. But that's not\nthe end of the world, Mr. Robbins.\nMR. ROBBINS: I don't think we bore the\nburden, an end-of-the-world burden, Justice Scalia.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ROBBINS: We bore the burden to show\nsufficient evidence of irreparable harm such that, on an\nabuse of discretion standard, it was appropriate. But\nlet me --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you were\ncomparing it to New York City dying --\nMR. ROBBINS: No. No, I was --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- from poisoned water?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ROBBINS: I -- I thought -- I -- it had\nbeen my -- my -- it had been my purpose to simply try to\nsuggest that it does not make sense to adopt a \"more\nlikely than not\" standard for likelihood of success or\nlikelihood of irreparable harm.\nBut I do -- if I could come to Your Honor's\nquestion about what the harm really is, there are three\ntypes of harms. There is the contamination of products,\nand we've talked about that. But there are two things\nwe've not talked about. One of them is the choice to be\nin a line of business that farmers and businessmen across\nthis country have chosen to be in. Some of them are in\nthis courtroom today. They have chosen organics or\nconventional farming that is GMO-free. They have chosen\nto sell natural beef. And they have chosen this in a\nrapidly growing, large business with dollars -- billions\nof dollars at stake.\nYou mention, for example, Justice Scalia,\nthe European market. That is just the tip of the\niceberg. The Japanese will not take -- which take, by\nthe way, 75 percent of our alfalfa exports -- will not --\ndespite their formal government policy, will not take\nGMO products.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Robbins, but if, as\nis likely -- I think the government told us that the EIS\nis about a year away, but that the EIS is going to say\nderegulate --\nMR. ROBBINS: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- is going to recommend\na deregulation decision. So we're talking about the --\nwhatever the farmers of organic or conventional --\nthey're only a year away from, so they will have to\naccept that there are other planters who want to do the\ngenetically engineered crop.\nMR. ROBBINS: Well, I think history remains\nto be written about what will happen in response to that\ndraft EIS that's a year away. We'll see how it comes\nout. But --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I think you yourself\ntold us how it came out with other crops, that the\ngenetically engineered crop was very popular and took\nover.\nMR. ROBBINS: Yes, it's very popular, but\nit's also -- you know, past is prologue. We've seen what\nhappened with genetically engineered corn. You can ask\nTaco Bell --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that's a\ndecision for the government to decide, APHIS, and their\nlawyer, Mr. Stewart, who is in the courtroom told us\nwhat the APHIS view is.\nMR. ROBBINS: Yes. I understand.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me, could you tell\nme, just to clarify one factual matter, the popularity\nof corn and the other genetically engineered crops, is\nthat from contamination or is it just from -- from\nconsumer choice; i.e., that that's what farmers like\nbecause it's easy to grow?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And what happened with corn?\nYou -- you -- you said -- gee, I was unaware -- I've\nbeen eating corn all this time.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ROBBINS: Well, there's -- there was\nthe so-called --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What happened with it?\nMR. ROBBINS: There was the so-called\nStarLink controversy in which there was genetic\ncontamination of corn. There was genetic contamination\nof organic soybeans and organic canola in Canada. There\nwas .06 percent contamination of -- of -- of rice from\ngenetically engineered rice that nearly -- that -- that\ncost the rice industry, as the rice growers' brief makes\nclear -- the amicus brief makes clear.\nThe fact is the judge had before him\nall of this evidence, and he said it is sufficiently\nlikely to -- to constitute irreparable harm.\nNow, Justice Ginsburg, it is correct that\nthe draft EIS says this is coming. So, in a year,\n6 months, whenever it is, people may have to get ready\nfor a brave -- for a -- for a different world if not a\nbrave new world. But it's worth looking at that draft\nEIS, because it is very candid about how different the\nworld will look.\nIt tells us we know this is going to shut\ndown the -- the export market. We know that the\nJapanese and the Koreans and the Europeans won't buy your\nproducts. We know this will hasten the consolidation of\nfarming. We know it will hasten the -- it will\nhasten the demise of organic farming, a rapidly\ndeveloping business in this country --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All arguments you\ncan make before HP -- APHIS and which presumably were\nmade before APHIS --\nMR. ROBBINS: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and can be made\nbefore APHIS if this is remanded.\nMR. ROBBINS: Indeed --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't entitle\nyou to an order saying APHIS can't do anything in the\nmeantime.\nMR. ROBBINS: I -- I agree that there is a\nrespect in which the injunction goes beyond the vacatur,\nand I think, you know, there are arguments why the\ndistrict court took that additional measure.\nBut I -- I think the upshot is that if that\nis the only respect that the injunction exceeds the\nlimit of the vacatur, I don't understand how the\nPetitioners can possibly have standing to argue all the\nthings that they argue, which is: We want to plant\ntomorrow. We want to plant the next day. We don't want\nto have to go back before the agency and let them do\nanother EA. We don't want to have more litigation over a\npartial deregulation. We want to plant now. That's\ntheir argument before this Court.\nAnd that is precisely what the vacatur tells\nthem independently they may not do, and they didn't\nchallenge that. They didn't and they haven't. They\ndidn't say a word until we brought it up in our\nbottom-side brief. Then we heard about it.\nAnd, Justice Kennedy, this is precisely the\nsituation that was before this Court in Renne v. -- the\nCalifornia constitutional provision --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.\nMR. ROBBINS: -- in which Your Honor\nwrote the opinion for the Court. Where there are\noverlapping provisions, or for -- you know, two pieces\nof law that have overlapping effect, and you challenge\none but not the other, you have a fatal redressability\nproblem. That's where we are today.\nAnd I have not heard -- I mean, I understand\nthat the vacatur was perhaps only in part because the\njudge in his discretion grandfathered certain\npre-March 30 growers -- fine. Maybe it was there for a\npartial vacatur. But whatever form of the vacatur it\nwas, they didn't challenge it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's kind of\nartificial to separate the two out. I mean, it's one\njudgment, and they say they're intertwined. The\ninjunction is based on the vacatur. And so if they\nchallenge the injunction, you can't say, well, they're\nnot challenging the vacatur.\nMR. ROBBINS: Well, I -- I'm not sure that\nit's fair to say that the injunction is based on the\nvacatur. But I do want to -- I do think, though, Mr.\nChief Justice, that every appeal is from a judgment. I\nmean, that's more or less -- excepting unusual\ncircumstances, that's the only thing you can appeal.\nBut if I were, for example, appealing a\ncriminal conviction, a judgment of conviction entered and\nsentence, and I raised only evidentiary arguments, and I\nfail to raise the sufficiency of the evidence, I -- I\ncan't get a dismissal in the court of appeals, because I\nhave -- I've failed to raise an issue. And it will not avail\nme one whit to tell the court of appeals, well, gosh, I\nappealed the judgment, and the sufficiency of the\nevidence is embedded in the judgment.\nNo. The way we appeal things in this\ncountry is we write sentences in our briefs about -- we\nwrite questions presented; we present questions to this\nCourt. And I will say that, although all manner of\narguments have been smuggled under the tent through the\ncamel's nose in this case, when I look at the questions\npresented in this case, you've got to really squint to\nfind even some of the arguments they have made, much\nless this one, which they have not made.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but we have to\ndecide -- for you to prevail on that, we have to decide\nthat the injunction does no more than the vacatur.\nMR. ROBBINS: No. I think what we -- I\nthink the question is whether the relief that they are\nseeking is separately prohibited by the vacatur and\nwhether that excess, which may arguably go beyond the\nvacatur, is sufficiently imminent to meet this Court's\nstanding cases.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so the\ndistrict judge was wrong. He should have -- if you say\nthe injunction adds nothing to the vacatur, he should\nhave ended by saying it's vacated.\nMR. ROBBINS: I think that was an available\noption. I think the reason he didn't is that, among\nother things, the -- the parties were arguing about\nwhether the -- the injunction should be broader than the\nvacatur. And, of course, he had the authority, as the\ngovernment has told us in its brief, to decline to\nvacate at all.\nSo it's not as if the remedy phase had no\npoint. It had a point. It's was all up for grabs. But\nin the end he issued a judgment with multiple parts,\nonly a subset of which Petitioners elected to appeal.\nThat was their choice. But now having made that choice,\nit seems to me surpassingly odd to draw this Court into\na close reading -- and this goes back to one of the\nfirst questions of this morning, from Justice Alito --\nthe question about digging into this, what the district\ncourt appropriately called the voluminous record of --\nof -- of declarations and evidence. That's an --\njust a -- I think a passingly -- a passing strange use\nof this Court's resources, to dig into those materials,\nwhen in point of fact --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We -- we don't necessarily\nhave to do that. We just have to decide whether the\nlower courts did it.\nMR. ROBBINS: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, if we concluded\nthat they didn't do it, that would -- that would be enough,\nwouldn't it? We wouldn't have to do it ourselves.\nMR. ROBBINS: Respectfully, Justice Scalia,\nI think the only way you can say they didn't do it is\nby doing it yourself; because they said they did it. You\nlook at pages --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They also said stuff which\nsuggests that they didn't do it.\nMR. ROBBINS: Well, I -- I won't -- and I am\nnot here defending every particular line in some of the\nopinions, but there is no question that at 69a through\n71a of the petition appendix, the district court\narticulated the standard four-part injunction test. The\ncourt of appeals articulated it as well, said that the\nevidence was sufficient. And, indeed, in this record,\nthere is sufficient evidence to warrant a finding of a\nlikelihood of irreparable harm, reviewable under an\nabuse of discretion standard. Your --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you're -- if you\nare right that the injunction does nothing, they don't\nhave standing because of that, we should throw the\ninjunction out.\nMR. ROBBINS: Well, I -- I -- I think, given\nthat standing is a threshold question, I don't see how\nthe Court could do that. I think the Court could say:\nWe conclude that the vacatur prohibits exactly the same\nthings as the Petitioners are demanding from this Court.\nThey didn't challenge it; they have a redressability\nproblem, case dismissed --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We don't have to\nworry --\nMR. ROBBINS: -- or dismissed as improvidently\ngranted.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The government doesn't\nhave to worry about standing, does it?\nMR. ROBBINS: Well, the government -- well,\nthe government I think has the same vacatur problem, but\nI don't think that's a burden I have to meet, because\nunder -- I think it's Diamond v. Charles, the -- the\nstanding has to be by the party that called upon this\nCourt's jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In deciding irreparable\nharm, what weight if any should be given to the\nproposition that there was an environmental impact\nregulation violation, as opposed to just a regular suit\nbetween, say, two farmers over a nuisance? What weight\ndo we give to the fact that -- let's assume -- there's a --\na violation of the rule requiring an environmental\nimpact statement?\nMR. ROBBINS: Well, it -- it --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That is not alone a\nsufficient harm to justify an injunction, is it?\nMR. ROBBINS: No. And no -- no one is\nclaiming that an EIS violation standing alone gives\nrise to an injunction, but it carries some important\nweight. And if I could just answer the question\nnotwithstanding the red light, the answer to the\nquestion is the fact that they violated the EIS\nrequirement tells us at a minimum that this was a\nsignificant -- a major Federal program that had a\nsignificant impact on the environment.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. ROBBINS: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Garre, you have\n3 minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nJustice Kennedy, to answer your question,\nthis Court in Amoco held that you don't give special\nweight to that; that you apply the traditional equitable\nfactors.\nYour Honors, we absolutely did challenge the\nvacatur below. That's spelled out in note 1 of our\nreply brief. The whole fight in this case going forward\nsince the district court has been over whether or not\nthe court erred in not adopting the government's\nproposed measures. On page 184 of the petition appendix,\nit makes clear that the government's opposed measures\nwere intended to replace the deregulation order. So the\nvacatur and the proposed measures are one and the same.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I have a real problem if\nthe whole appeal is over whether or not the district\ncourt should have accepted the agency's views. The\nagency has told us that it has side-stepped going\nthrough all of the regular -- all of the administrative\nsteps it was required to. It may not have needed to\ngive notice, but it needed to do some form of an EA and\nget comments and do other things. And it didn't do\nthat.\nMR. GARRE: Well, it --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how can we say that\nthe district court acted improperly, when it's the\ngovernment who is asking the district court to forgive\nit from doing something it's legally required to do?\nMR. GARRE: The district court at least\nacted improperly in enjoining the agency from doing that\non remand. And if that's all the Court thinks it did\nimproperly --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no. My problem is I\ndon't see that argument either in your brief or theirs.\nMR. GARRE: Well, it's part --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I see only the argument\nthat it erred by not accepting something that the\ngovernment had no power to do outside of the regulatory\nscheme.\nMR. GARRE: It's -- our view is it's part\nand parcel of the vacatur order. The district court\nlooked at this in the context of the injunction and\nposed those traditional factors in examining the scope\nof relief.\nJUSTICE ALITO: How do you answer\nMr. Robbins's --\nMR. GARRE: I mean, it's important for this\nCourt to put aside --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I'm sorry to interrupt. How\ndo you answer Mr. Robbins's imminence argument?\nMR. GARRE: In terms of going back for the\nimminence, we're operating under this injunction which is\nunlawful. It's preventing -- it's causing real harm to\nthe nation's farmers today. There couldn't be more\nimminence in terms of the harm that we suffer because of\nthis erroneous injunction. With respect, it's -- it's\nthe farmers that are challenging this --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But wouldn't it be the\nsame problem for the farmers if we had only the\nderegulation decision vacated? They can't do anything\nuntil the agency then gives them permission to do\nsomething.\nMR. GARRE: If you go back, the agency\ncould allow those measures to be implemented and that\nwould solve --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And that's going to take\ntime.\nMR. GARRE: -- our problem.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I mean, it's going to take\ntime, and you have the EIS on track within a year. So are\nyou going to do this other operation in 6 months?\nMR. GARRE: Not necessarily,\nJustice Ginsburg, but, with respect, we've been\noperating under this erroneous injunction for 3 years.\nThis Court should say it's erroneous. There are\nother cases that are repeating this pattern. It's\nimportant for the Court to correct this error.\nAnd briefly on the question of harm: There\nare no instances in this record of any cross-pollination\nwith hay, only a couple of -- a few isolated with\nrespect to seed, and their harm really boils down to the\nquestion of their psychological objection to genetically\nengineered alfalfa. That harm is not cognizable under\nMetropolitan Edison or anything else.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
