        "content": "(10:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in Antonio Dwayne Halbert v. Michigan.\nMr. Moran.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. MORAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. MORAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThe issue in this case is whether, 42 years\nafter this Court decided in Douglas v. California that\nindigent defendants have the right to the assistance of\ncounsel for a first-tier direct felony appeal --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, now, Douglas didn't\ninvolve a guilty plea, I guess.\nMR. MORAN: It did not, Your Honor. It was a\ntrial case.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And did the Court say\nanything about the effect of having it be a guilty plea?\nI guess it didn't.\nMR. MORAN: It did not. None of this Court's\ncases in the Douglas line have turned on whether the\nconviction was by trial or by plea.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Does that make a difference\nor could it?\nMR. MORAN: I don't believe it does, Your Honor,\nbecause as Mr. Halbert's case demonstrates, all sorts of\ndifficult, technical issues can arise in a guilty plea.\nOf course, certain issues are waived. Trial issues are\nwaived by the effect of a guilty plea, but many other\nissues remain. And as Mr. Halbert's case demonstrates,\nespecially in the guilty plea cases -- this Court well\nknows the effect of the Federal sentencing guidelines --\nvery complicated issues of sentencing law arise. And now\nMichigan has a sentencing guideline system that is perhaps\nmore complicated than the Federal system that's been in\neffect since the 1980's.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Did -- did your client waive\nany right to appeal here in connection with the\nproceedings of the plea?\nMR. MORAN: He did not waive a right to file an\napplication for leave to appeal. Because of the --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: What did he waive?\nMR. MORAN: He waived the right to have a -- to\nhave what is called in Michigan an automatic appeal, in\nother words, the right to automatically have full briefing\nand oral argument. So what he agreed to by pleading was\nto go through the application for leave to appeal\nprocedure which involves a preliminary determination of\nmerit as to whether the appeal should proceed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why didn't he waive the right\nto have counsel for that -- for that purpose since that\nwas the law in Michigan?\nMR. MORAN: Well, he did not -- first of all, as\na matter of fact, he did not. He was never told at any\npoint during the plea proceedings that he would be giving\nup his right to counsel.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, he was told what -- what\nright to counsel he would have and it didn't include this.\nMR. MORAN: He was told that under certain\ncircumstances the judge would appoint counsel.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. MORAN: But the judge never said, under any\nother circumstances, I will not appoint counsel.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, isn't that a\nperfectly natural inference if you're told you get A and\nB, that C and D might have been -- that C and D will not\nbe given?\nMR. MORAN: It might be a natural inference for\nsomebody with a level of sophistication, but Mr. Halbert\nis a special education student, functionally illiterate.\nAnd nobody explained to him that he wouldn't be given his\nright to counsel.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, did we take this case on\nthe ground that he wasn't adequately advised or did we\ntake the case on the ground that even if he were advised,\nhe'd still have his right?\nMR. MORAN: I hope the latter, Justice Kennedy,\nbecause this is a case in which the State is making a\nwaiver argument. And, of course, the waiver argument is\nnot part of -- is not the intent of the statute. What the\nstatute does is it tacks on and, by the way, the defendant\nshould be advised at the time of the plea that they won't\nbe getting counsel.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I take it you would\nchallenge the validity of the waiver even if he were\nadvised?\nMR. MORAN: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And even if he said, I hereby\nwaive?\nMR. MORAN: Absolutely, we would because that is\na waiver that is designed to extract only from the poor.\nThat waiver has no effect whatsoever on those with money\nbecause, in fact, a money defendant is not even eligible\nfor appointed counsel on appeal. So that waiver has no\neffect whatsoever on --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, wouldn't -- I'm -- I'm\nsorry.\nMR. MORAN: It would have no effect whatsoever\non money defendants I'm saying.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Wouldn't your position be\ndifferent if he had been advised that he had exactly the\nright that you claim he has, and the court said, however,\nin Michigan you may not enter the -- the plea unless you\nwaive that right? If -- if you don't want to waive that\nright, which I've just explained to you, we'll -- we'll\nhave a trial. Would -- would your answer still be that --\nthat waiver would be as a matter of law impossible?\nMR. MORAN: The waiver would be unconstitutional\nunder those conditions because it is a discriminatory\nwaiver. To show how breathtaking the State's argument --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: How -- why is that prejudicial\nto him? He says, okay, I can't plead guilty. I really\ndid it but I can't plead guilty. Go ahead.\nMR. MORAN: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why doesn't he just have a\ntrial? He says, I'm not going to contest the trial.\nMR. MORAN: Well, as this Court has long\nrecognized, a trial provides very substantial benefit. I\nmean, excuse me. A guilty plea provides very substantial\nbenefits. And so the effect of the Michigan statute then\nwould be only the money defendant can receive the benefits\nof a guilty plea and then have sentencing errors\ncorrected.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, is that what you were going\nto say to Justice Souter, before I interrupted, that it's --\nthat it's far-reaching.\nMR. MORAN: Yes. Well, not only that, if the\nState's waiver argument is correct, then presumably the\nState could extract a waiver saying you can't have free\ntranscripts. You can't have the waiver of the filing\nfees. In fact, the State could extract a waiver saying\nyou can't have counsel at sentencing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: These are all disparate impact\narguments. There's -- there's -- you're not making any\nargument that the State intentionally discriminates\nagainst the poor. You're just saying the effect of this\nis harder on the poor than it is on the rich. But I\nthought our -- our equal protection cases have -- have\nsaid that disparate impact doesn't -- doesn't hack it as\nfar as equal protection is concerned.\nMR. MORAN: Well, Justice Scalia, I actually\nhave two responses to that. First, this is intentionally\naimed at the poor. Looking at 770.3a, the statute under\n-- in question here, it is clearly aimed at the indigent.\nIt refers to the indigent. So this is a statute that on\nits face is -- is taking away the right of the indigent\nand only the indigent to have -- have an attorney. So I\ndon't agree that is is a -- simply a disparate impact\ncase.\nBut in the context of appellate counsel for a\nfirst-tier felony appeal, this Court's cases have -- have\nnot applied the same line of analysis that this Court has\napplied in other contexts, and I think that's quite clear\nmost recently in the MLB case --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In any event, you pointed out\nthat on the face there is the distinction on the face of\nit --\nMR. MORAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- it is not a disparate\nimpact case at all --\nMR. MORAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- because it affects only\nindigents.\nMR. MORAN: Yes. There is no question that this\nstatute was enacted for and specifically applies only to\nthe indigent. It has -- it has no impact whatsoever on\nthe wealthy, and it's aimed at the -- at the indigent\nonly. So I do -- I do not agree that this --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Whenever a State has -- has\ninitially given a broad benefit to the poor, whenever it\ncuts back on poor -- on part of that benefit, it is\ndenying equal protection to the poor? That -- that seems\nto be an extraordinary proposition. The State isn't\npicking on the poor. It's just saying that -- that the --\nthe free counsel we have agreed to provide in the past\nwe're no longer going to provide in this -- in this one\ninstance of guilty pleas. And -- and you say that -- that\nis intentional discrimination against the poor?\nMR. MORAN: It's not a -- a disparate impact\nclaim I say, because it is intentionally aimed at the\npoor. The statute was designed to take away counsel from\nthe poor and only from the poor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So any cutback on benefits that\nis given -- on benefits that are given to the poor is\nintentional discrimination against the poor.\nMR. MORAN: I'm not saying any, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Just this one because that's\nyour case.\nMR. MORAN: This case certainly is.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You're saying this is case\nlike Douglas which was equal protection, like a free\ntranscript, like a filing fee for an appeal.\nMR. MORAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You're bracketing --\nMR. MORAN: This case -- in many ways the\nrestrictions that are placed on the indigent's ability to\nappeal in Michigan, as a result of this statute, are worse\nthan those that were struck down in Douglas because at\nleast in Douglas the court, the appellate court, would\nreview the entire transcript, looking for arguable issues.\nWe don't even have that here.\nAll we have here is the indigent forced to shift\nfor himself, forced to try and determine whether there are\nany issues, forced to order his own transcript. Under the\nMichigan statute, the indigent has to figure out how to\nobtain his or her docket entries, his or her transcripts,\nhis or her prisoner account statements, all the documents\nnecessary for filing a first appeal that would ordinarily\nbe done by counsel. And so --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I just understand one\npoint that Justice Scalia's question raises for me? In\nyour view, is the provision of counsel for the indigent\nfor appellate purposes purely a matter of grace, or was\nthere some underlying obligation to provide counsel?\nMR. MORAN: Oh, it's my -- it's certainly my\ncontention, Justice Stevens, that Michigan is required to\nafford appellate counsel in this situation for a first-\ntier direct felony appeal on the merits.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So that ultimately your case\nrests not on equal protection but due process.\nMR. MORAN: It's a merger of both principles, as\nthis Court said --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it's one as much as the\nother, isn't it?\nMR. MORAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, you're -- we're saying\nif you're going to provide a first appeal of right, one\nincident of that is, as a matter of due process, you've\ngot to provide counsel.\nMR. MORAN: Yes, Justice Souter.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you're -- you're retracting\nthe pure equal protection claim? I don't think you want\nto do that. I mean, you would say that even if there were\nnot a due process right, you would still regard this as --\nas directed against the poor.\nMR. MORAN: It is directed --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or not?\nMR. MORAN: It is directed against the poor,\nwhich is why there is an equal protection component to\nthis argument, but this Court's cases --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you say that component\nwouldn't exist unless you begin with a due process right\nto have counsel on appeal.\nMR. MORAN: I believe that's right. It's --\nit's difficult -- I have to confess, Your Honor, it's\ndifficult sometimes to separate out the due process and\nequal protection strands from the Griffin and Douglas line,\nand this Court most recently in MLB said that there is a\ncertain merger. Also, I believe in Smith v. Robbins this\nCourt reiterated that there is a certain merger of the\nlines in these cases. But --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You're -- you're saying that\nthe due process is what gets you beyond the stage of\nmerely providing counsel as a matter of grace. That's\nwhat due process does for you. Because they have to\nprovide counsel not merely as a matter of grace, you have\na very clear equal protection case which you would not\notherwise have. Isn't -- isn't that the way the two work\ntogether?\nMR. MORAN: I think that's right, Justice\nSouter. I think I agree with that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can -- in your view, can the\nState require a waiver of the right to appeal for\neveryone?\nMR. MORAN: That's a question this Court hasn't\ndecided, and I don't have a position on that. But that's\nfar different from this case because that would not be\ndiscriminatory.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not so sure. It\ncertainly goes to the importance or the significance of\nthe underlying right. My understanding is -- correct me\nif I'm wrong -- that in the Federal system, we require\nwaivers of the right to appeal frequently, even waiver of\nthe right to appeal the sentence even before the sentence\nis calculated, as I understand it.\nMR. MORAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And do you question the\nlawfulness of that?\nMR. MORAN: I don't. And that -- that case has\nnot come before this Court yet, and so I don't know how\nthis Court would decide that case if it comes. I know\nsome of the Federal circuits have upheld such appellate\nwaivers as a part of a negotiated guilty plea.\nOne thing the Michigan statute is -- does is it\ntakes away the right to appeal effectively for indigents\nwithout negotiation. It's -- it's the baseline.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But, Mr. Moran, if -- if you're\n-- if you're tying your equal protection claim to a due\nprocess claim and if it is not a violation of due process\nto require people to waive their -- I mean, you can waive\nentirely the right to appeal. Surely you can waive the\nright to counsel on appeal. If that's not a violation of\ndue process, then your equal protection claim dissolves.\nMR. MORAN: But, Your Honor, the problem is --\nis that the statute requires only the poor, imposes a\nforced waiver on only the poor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's an equal protection\nclaim.\nMR. MORAN: That's an equal protection claim.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you've -- you've said your\nequal protection claim hinges on the due process claim.\nIf the due process claim, in turn, hinges upon waiver,\nthen apart from the -- from the dispute in this case as to\nwhether waiver occurred or not, if waiver does occur,\nthere's no due process claim, and then there's no equal\nprotection claim.\nMR. MORAN: I'm really not sure that you can\nseparate out the two strands of the Fourteenth Amendment\nagain, and I know this Court didn't try in MLB, and I know\nthis Court didn't try in Smith v. Robbins, so that there\nis -- there is a component of both. And it's precisely\nbecause of these sorts of questions that I think you have\nto view them as an integrated whole for purposes of the\nGriffin/Douglas line.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In any case --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Where -- where do we find the\nwaiver here? Is it in the joint appendix?\nMR. MORAN: Well, it's my position there was no\nwaiver, but the --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But you referred to something\nthat was waived.\nMR. MORAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Where would we find that?\nMR. MORAN: Well, the plea proceeding. It's the\nplea proceeding. And it's --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, don't take your time to\nlook it up. Maybe counsel for respondent can find it for\nus.\nMR. MORAN: It's -- it's in the joint\nappendix --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: All right.\nMR. MORAN: -- beginning on page 19.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's their argument anyway.\nLet them --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm missing something on\nwaiver, but I would have thought a person can waive a -- a\nright to have a counsel on appeal. He can waive a trial.\nHe can waive a jury trial. But before he has to -- before\nhe decides, he has to know that he has the constitutional\nright to a jury trial.\nMR. MORAN: That's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And why wouldn't he also have\nto have the -- to know that he has the constitutional\nright to a lawyer to represent him?\nMR. MORAN: Well, that's my position Justice\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. That has nothing to\ndo with equal protection. It has to do simply with a very\ncommon sense rule that we apply in every case, jury trial,\net cetera. So all we'd have to say is, of course, he has\na right to a lawyer.\nNow, if he wants to go back and waive that\nright, fine.\nMR. MORAN: That's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's all. That's the end of\nit.\nMR. MORAN: That's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what's all this complicated\nthing about?\nMR. MORAN: If an indigent, after being\nsentenced, decided for whatever reason I would prefer to\ngo on appeal by myself, which is actually a -- a right\nthis Court rejected in Martinez, that you have a right to\nrepresent yourself on appeal, but in Michigan an indigent\nis allowed to -- would be allowed to represent himself or\nherself on appeal if they chose to do so. The problem\nhere is that the statute purports to take away the right,\nand it's our position that this is a --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. You'd have to say the\nstatute is wrong in taking away the right.\nMR. MORAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But he can waive it if he wants\nto, knowing that he has the right.\nMR. MORAN: That's right. We have no problem\nwith a voluntary waiver. We certainly have a problem with\na forced waiver saying that you cannot enter a plea which\nproduces tremendous benefits in Michigan, as everywhere\nelse, unless -- unless you agree to waiver --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, but -- but that happens all\nthe time. I mean, the waiver -- waiver of appeal in -- in\nguilty -- in guilty pleas. That's -- that's not\npermissible either?\nMR. MORAN: I take no position on that. It may\nor may not permissible.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you have to if you're\ngoing to make the argument you just made.\nMR. MORAN: But it's far different because\nthat's something that can be obtained in negotiation. But\nwhat we would have --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, Mr. Moran, here on page\n22 of the joint appendix, the court is speaking to the\ndefendant and says, you understand if I accept your plea,\nyou are giving up or waiving any claim of an appeal as of\nright.\nMR. MORAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And you think that was not\neffective?\nMR. MORAN: No. That was effective. That --\nthat's referring to the automatic appeal that he would\nhave if he went to trial where he would have full briefing\nand oral argument. The Michigan --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, I -- it doesn't say\nthat.\nMR. MORAN: No, it doesn't. This was a -- this\nwas a pretty poor waiver proceeding in a number of -- of\nrespects, but it --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, he does --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: I'm --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- he does go on to say that\n-- that he can appoint a lawyer for -- in certain\ninstances. He doesn't complete the explanation by saying\nthere are other instances and when I will not appoint one.\nThat he leaves out, although this a represented defendant.\nMR. MORAN: Yes, he was.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: He had a counsel at the plea hearing.\nMR. MORAN: He did.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm mixed up again. What is\nthe answer to this? I -- I would have thought that even\nif those words that Justice O'Connor read referred\ndirectly to the kind of appeal that we have in front of us\n-- in other words, the one that's at issue -- that still\nhe'd have to know he has a right to a lawyer on that\nappeal before he could waive it.\nMR. MORAN: Yes, Justice Breyer, I agree.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And does anybody dispute that?\nMR. MORAN: I believe --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that at issue here?\nMR. MORAN: I -- I believe the State might\ndispute that. I'm not sure.\nWhat the Michigan constitution does, Justice\nO'Connor, if I may come back to your question, is it says\nthat for somebody who pleads guilty or nolo contendere,\nthey are giving up the right to the automatic appeal, and\nthey have -- they then have to proceed by the application\nfor leave to appeal. And so the Michigan constitution\nexplicitly still provides a right to appeal, but it\nchanges the method. And so Michigan's appeal, after a\nguilty plea now, is like the first appeal in several other\nStates, Virginia, West Virginia, and -- and several other\nStates have guilty plea appeals.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's a strange terminology.\nIt doesn't provide a right to appeal. It -- it provides a\nright to apply for an appeal, a right to ask for an\nappeal. A right to ask for an appeal is not a right to\nget an appeal.\nMR. MORAN: It's framed in terms of a -- of a\nright. Page 2 of the brief --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you have an absolute right\nto ask for an appeal.\nMR. MORAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that's not a right to\nappeal. It's a right to request an appeal, which can be\ngranted or denied.\nMR. MORAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. MORAN: But it's a -- it's -- what Michigan\nhas done is it has changed the method of the appeal. And\nso Virginia, for example, has first-tier appeals by\npetition. West Virginia has a first-tier by petition\nand --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's done more than\nchange the method. It's changed the entitlement. The\ncourt can simply say we're not interested in your appeal.\nIt doesn't raise a significant legal issue.\nMR. MORAN: Yes, Justice Scalia, but that's not\nhow the -- the Michigan Court of Appeals works. The\nMichigan Court of Appeals is an error-correcting court.\nAnd so in Mr. Halbert's case, the Michigan Court of\nAppeals denied his appeal, after his futile attempt to --\nto identify his issues, with an order saying that there\nwas a lack of merit in the grounds presented. That is a\npreclusive decision on the merits of his case. That --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's just -- but that's\njust boiler plate, isn't it? That's what they say in all\nthese cases.\nMR. MORAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And I think Michigan cites a\nMichigan Supreme Court decision that says it's not on the\nmerits.\nMR. MORAN: That --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's People v. Berry?\nMR. MORAN: Yes. That was a decision of the\nMichigan Supreme Court referring to its own orders denying\napplications for leave to appeal which are not on the\nmerits. The Michigan Supreme Court denies the\napplications for saying -- by saying, we are not persuaded\nthat we should hear the questions presented.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, why wouldn't it be the\nsame if the -- if it's a discretionary appeal at the\nintermediate appellate level?\nMR. MORAN: Because the Michigan Court of\nAppeals, unlike the Michigan Supreme Court, is an error-\ncorrecting court. And so it issues orders saying denied\nfor lack of merit. And the Michigan Court of Appeals\ndozens and dozens of times in the last 25 years has said,\nwithout exception, that is a decision on the merits that\nprecludes relitigation under the law of the case doctrine.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Didn't -- didn't the supreme\ncourt in the Bulger case -- was that the name of it?\nMR. MORAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Didn't it say that the -- that\nthe intermediate court's denial of -- of appeals was a\ndiscretionary judgment?\nMR. MORAN: It called it a discretionary appeal,\nJustice Scalia, without ever explaining why, and the --\nthe dissent in Bulger pointed out the Michigan Court of\nAppeals is an error-correcting court. And in fact, the\nvery author of the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That was a dissent, though.\nMR. MORAN: That's right, but the very author of\nthe opinion in Bulger, Chief Justice Corrigan, just 1 year\nlater or 2 years later describes the effect of -- of an\norder denying leave to appeal in the Michigan Court of\nAppeals, and says it clearly shows they considered and\nrejected the merits.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So, in effect, it's\ndiscretionary in the sense that it's discretionary as to\nwhether to give it full-dress treatment, but the bottom\nline, whether they give it full dress or -- or merely\ndiscretionary denial is -- is an implication on the\nmerits.\nMR. MORAN: Yes, exactly as in Virginia. In\nJackson v. Virginia, the Court recognized that the -- the\nVirginia situation is exactly the same, that there is a\npetition to appeal to the Virginia Court of Appeals, and\nthat each petition is considered on the merits, and a\ndenial of the petition is seen as a decision on the merits\nthat precludes relitigation under the law of the case\ndoctrine. And so Michigan's appeal after a guilt plea now\nis exactly like the one in Virginia.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that something the\nintermediate appellate court has said? Have they said\nthat, that -- we have a -- a discretionary appeal, but\nevery -- in every case it's a merits decision? We don't\nhave any decisions that say we are exercising our\ndiscretion not to review.\nMR. MORAN: If a -- if a appeal or an\napplication to the Michigan Court of Appeals is filed in\nthe wrong form or is untimely or has some other defect,\nthen the court will occasionally issue an order denying\nthe application for that reason. But for any properly\nfiled application for leave to appeal, the longstanding\npractice of the Michigan Court of Appeals is to say it is\ndenied for lack of merit in the grounds presented.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This means, I would presume,\nthat -- that we would -- we would have to give -- our\nFederal courts on habeas would have to give deference to\nall decisions of the intermediate court since they're all\non the merits.\nMR. MORAN: And they do.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Federal courts do?\nMR. MORAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They assume that all factual\nand legal arguments have been decided against the -- the\nperson applying for a discretionary appeal?\nMR. MORAN: Yes. After Abela v. Martin in the\nSixth Circuit. And there is a -- a whole host of Federal\ndistrict court decisions in the Eastern and Western\nDistrict of Michigan all saying that when an order is\ndenied for lack of merit in the grounds presented, the\nAEDPA standard of review applies.\nAnd so the State obtains tremendous benefits\nfrom this procedure. They obtain deference on habeas\ncorpus review. They prevent the indigent, if the indigent\nwere to ever get a lawyer at some later stage, from\nbeginning relitigation on State collateral review. And so\nthe State very happily argues for all of those purposes\nthat this is a decision on the merits, but then they come\nbefore this Court and they say, oh, no, it's not a\ndecision on the merits. It's really discretionary despite\nwhat it says because they are hoping that this Court will\nconclude that it is a discretionary appeal.\nIn fact, the State --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Moran.\nMR. MORAN: -- has made an even more radical\nargument in its brief. The State maintains that the\nappeal to the Michigan Court of Appeals is a second-tier\nappeal, and that is plainly contrary to the -- to the\nactual function of that court because there is a provision\nthat if trial counsel suddenly realizes in a plea case,\nafter sentencing, that there are issues that she should\nhave raised, it allows her to do that. And so the State\nnow argues that that's really the first-tier appeal, and\nthen the application that follows after that to the\nMichigan Court of Appeals is a second-tier appeal.\nI'll just point out that even the State's amicus\ndoesn't agree with that, and -- and rightfully so in light\nof Swenson v. Bosler, which has rejected an attempt to\nreorganize by labeling how one's appeals go.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Moran, before your --\nyour time is up, I did want to know what is your position\non -- let's say that there is -- you prevail and there is\na right to counsel for these applications to appeal. And\nif counsel looks at the case and determines that there is\nno tenable ground for an appeal, could counsel file the\nequivalent of an Anders brief?\nMR. MORAN: Yes. Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and in\nfact, I have done that personally. Before I became an\nacademic, I worked at the State Appellate Defender Office\nin Detroit and was appointed to represent indigents on\nplea appeals. And in a significant percentage of the\ncases -- I can't quote you the numbers off the top of my\nhead -- after reviewing the case, the appellate counsel\nthen concludes that there is no merit, that there are no\ngrounds to proceed, that the defendant in fact got\nwhatever it was she bargained for in the plea bargaining,\nat which point then either a motion to withdraw may be\nfiled or -- or the equivalent, the Michigan equivalent, of\nan Anders brief. And so that is done in a number of\ncases.\nIt is our position that that procedure actually\nhelps improve the appellate process in Michigan because\nwithout that process, all you have are indigents like Mr.\nHalbert, a special education student with mental\ndisabilities, trying to identify his own issues and fall\n-- and filing, in -- in his case, with the help of a\nfellow prisoner because he could not have done it himself\n-- the help of a fellow prisoner, an application that is\ncompletely incoherent, misses several issues that are\nright on the face of the record, correctly asserts that\nhis sentencing guidelines were misscored but -- but\nwithout explaining why, without even identifying which\nsentencing guidelines were misscored.\nAnd in fact, he received a minimum sentence that\nwas approximately three times too high under the\nsentencing guidelines. The State concedes that one of the\nsentencing guidelines was scored in the State's favor\nerroneously. We concede one of the -- one of the\nsentencing guidelines was scored in Mr. Halbert's favor\nerroneously. But then there were two others, and the most\nimportant ones, the OV, Offense Variable, 13. That was\nscored for 25 points in both cases. And so Mr. -- Mr.\nHalbert, in fact, received a sentence that was much too\nhigh.\nMichigan requires -- Michigan is one of the few\nStates that requires that ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claims be raised on direct appeal or they're lost.\nAnd so at that point, Mr. Halbert had to figure out a way\nto raise an ineffective assistance of counsel hearing,\nwhich requires an evidentiary hearing at which trial\ncounsel must be called, assuming trial counsel is still\navailable to be called, all from prison, and there was no\npossible way he could do that. So it's not very\nsurprising that even with the help of a fellow inmate,\nthat his application for leave to appeal was completely\nincoherent.\nThe fellow inmate actually did write the -- the\ntrial judge and say we need to have an evidentiary hearing\non ineffective assistance of counsel. But under the\nstatute, the judge had no discretion to grant that motion.\nUnder the statute, only if there was already an upward\ndeparture from the sentencing guidelines, only then would\nthe judge be required to appoint counsel, and of course,\nthe guidelines, as misscored without objection from\ndefense counsel -- there was no upward departure at that\npoint.\nIf the Court has no further questions, I'd like\nto reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Mr. Moran.\nMr. Restuccia.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BERNARD E. RESTUCCIA\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. RESTUCCIA: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI want to start with the factual claim regarding\nthe waiver that the Court identified, pages 22 and 23 from\nthe joint appendix, being the point at which Mr. Halbert,\nin fact, waived his right to the appointment of appellate\ncounsel. I think Justice Scalia is right in noting that\nhe was told specifically it's under these conditions\nyou'll be appointed a counsel; under these conditions, you\nmight be appointed counsel. From context it's unambiguous\nthat he would otherwise not receive counsel.\nAnd what's important is at the joint appendix on\npage 45, the trial court, in fact, made a factual finding\non this point. So in order for this Court to conclude\nthat Mr. Halbert did not waive his right to appellate\ncounsel under the particular circumstances, you would have\n-- you would have to conclude that the trial court was\nclearly erroneous in its factual finding.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I mean, wouldn't we have\nto conclude that if we're going to apply the same\nstandards here that we usually do in -- in the plea waiver\nsituation? I mean, we -- the -- the classic point of it\nall is the knowing -- the -- the intelligent, voluntary\nwaiver of a known right. And leaving aside the equal\nprotection problem here, even if we didn't have that, I\ndon't see that there would be -- have been an adequate\nwaiver here because he was never told that he had the\nright that he now claims as a matter of due process. You\nindeed, dispute it.\nMR. RESTUCCIA: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But unless he were told that,\nthe -- the waiver that -- that depends upon parsing the\ndifference between must and may in the two paragraphs of\nexplanation certainly wouldn't be taken as the predicate\nfor a waiver of a known right.\nMR. RESTUCCIA: I -- I think that the colloquy\nmakes clear that he does not -- he's not going to have an\nappeal as of right, and then when told that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the -- the appeal of his\nright -- the appeal as of right point, as I understand it,\nis a different point. What they're getting at there is it\nwill be discretionary with the reviewing court whether\nyour case is reviewed on the merits on some point if you\nask for it. We're here dealing with the right to counsel,\nand it seems to me unless he were told that he had the\nright to counsel that he claims and he then waived it,\nthat there wouldn't be a -- an -- an adequate waiver under\nBoykin.\nMR. RESTUCCIA: I think in -- in context when\ntold that only under these circumstances you're going to\nreceive counsel in bringing discretionary application,\nthat it's clear that he is waiving in his decision to go\nforward with the -- his plea --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Look, the -- imagine -- I'm\njust repeating what Justice Souter said. There must be --\nit's so obvious that there must be an obvious answer, but\nI haven't heard the answer.\nHe knows Michigan law or his lawyer does. The\nMichigan lawyer looks at the statute. It says a defendant\nwho pleads guilty shall not have appellate counsel\nappointed for review with some exceptions, which they\nclaim are inadequate. So he thinks the law is shall not.\nI have no right. So he doesn't not only -- not only is he\nnot waiving a known right, there's nothing for him to\nwaive. He has no such right.\nNow, obviously, when there's nothing for him to\nwaive, how could he waive anything? And obviously, a\nperson who's told, hey, you don't have a right to appeal\nno matter what and then he says, okay, I waive my right to\nappeal, I mean, really.\nMR. RESTUCCIA: I think that the -- the -- for\nthe two questions that are asked, he explains -- the court\nexplained to him he didn't have appeal as of right but\nthen said --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay, that's the end of it.\nRight?\nMR. RESTUCCIA: But then -- and then the --\nthe --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But he had an appeal of right\nuntil he pleaded guilty.\nMR. RESTUCCIA: That's right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that's where -- that's what\nthe waiver consists of. To say he didn't have an appeal\nof right, no. That's -- he had an appeal of right up\nuntil the point where he pleads guilty, and that's what --\nand that's what the judge is asking.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Precisely.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you want to -- do you want\nto plead guilty, even though if you plead guilty, you'll\nget -- you'll get a lawyer only under these circumstances.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Precisely.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The court didn't say only --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that's what we're deciding\nis --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's the problem.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's exactly the issue in\nfront of us. Is it constitutional or not constitutional?\nAnd waiver has nothing to do with it.\nMR. RESTUCCIA: I think that -- I also want to\nmake the point, of course, that there was a factual\nfinding, so if this Court did conclude, it would have to\nfind the trial court was clearly erroneous.\nThe --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Restuccia, the -- we are\ndealing here, as is not uncommon, with someone who is\nlearning disabled, mentally impaired, and the trial court\ndid not say if you plead, you relinquish your right to\ncounsel in seeking leave to appeal. It said only when --\nif this exists, I must, and if that exists, I must, but\ndid not say if you plead, you relinquish your right to\ncounsel in seeking leave to appeal.\nAnd I was curious as a matter of what is going\non in Michigan trial courts now. Do judges routinely tell\ndefendants who plead guilty -- tell them not only when the\ncourt must give them counsel, but if you plead, you\nrelinquish your right to counsel in seeking leave to\nappeal? Because that --\nMR. RESTUCCIA: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that was never imparted in\nthis case.\nMR. RESTUCCIA: The advice concerning right to\nappeal, the one that was used in the trial court here, was\na form from 2000. The -- the 2004 form is available from\nthe Michigan Supreme Court web site, and it has been\nmodified now that -- because the trial court -- it seems\napparent that he was reading from the advice concerning\nright of -- to appeal. The way it reads now is it will\nsay you are not entitled to have a lawyer appointed at\npublic expense to assist you in filing an application for\nleave to appeal. So this -- this -- the colloquy now\nwould happen differently, but I think that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, your case is a\nlittle stronger than -- than the court just asked -- just\nsaying I must appoint counsel in this circumstance and I\nmust appoint counsel in another circumstance. That might\nhave left open the implication that you could appoint\ncounsel in other circumstances, but the court went on and\nto say I might appoint counsel in this circumstance and I\nmight appoint counsel in the other circumstance. So if\nthere's any implication from it, the implication is not\njust that I have -- I have listed all the areas in which I\nmust, but it's also I have listed all the areas in which I\neither must or even may, if there's an implication.\nMR. RESTUCCIA: I think -- I think that's right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, apparently the people\nwho -- who redid the model instructions thought that this\nwould be a clearer one, to tell him up front you don't get\ncounsel if you don't fit under these exceptions.\nMR. RESTUCCIA: That's right. And they -- they\ndid -- they did modify the form.\nSo on the question of the underlying\nconstitutionality, I want to -- I want to make a few\npoints, that the -- the threshold question really is\nwhether there's an appeal as of right in Michigan for a\nplea-based conviction. Michigan law is clear that there\nis no appeal by right. It's an application process and\nit's a discretionary review. The Michigan Court of\nAppeals has no obligation to correct errors in these\ncases, has no obligation to review the merits.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you agree with your\nopponent that for AEDPA purposes, they treat the\nintermediate decision as a decision on the merits?\nMR. RESTUCCIA: No. The law in the Sixth\nCircuit is in fact in conflict with a case -- an earlier\ncase, McKenzie v. Smith -- had determined that the -- a\ndecision with that language, that virtually identical\nlanguage, is not -- is not entitled to deference.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So your opponent has\nmisrepresented Michigan law.\nMR. RESTUCCIA: No. I didn't say -- I wasn't\nsuggesting that. Abela is one case stating one position.\nMcKenzie, an earlier case, stated another position.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But he says there are dozens\nof cases at the district court level that apply AEDPA in\nthe way he described. Is that wrong?\nMR. RESTUCCIA: Well, he didn't cite those\ncases. I --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, he didn't, but do you\nthink he's wrong?\nMR. RESTUCCIA: I -- I know that our office\nhandles all the habeas -- habeas corpus --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think he's wrong?\nMR. RESTUCCIA: I think he is wrong. The --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Are you going on -- on record\nas saying that Michigan does not and will not, in the\nUnited States courts, claim any AEDPA deference as a\nresult of one of these determinations?\nMR. RESTUCCIA: The Solicitor General made that\nposition clear before the argument -- before this Court in\nTesmer v. Kowalski. So we have not been advancing that\nclaim. In fact, we've been advancing a claim --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And you have not been -- and --\nand Michigan lawyers have not been advancing that claim in\nthe district courts?\nMR. RESTUCCIA: The -- all the habeas petitions\nare run through the office of the Attorney General, so\nthat the -- when the Solicitor General from the State of\nMichigan instructed our staff not to advance that claim,\nthat means all habeas cases in Michigan essentially there\nwill be -- that argument will not be advanced.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So, so far as you can tell,\nthat's the way it's been.\nMR. RESTUCCIA: That's right. That's right.\nAnd because there is no appeal as of right under\nMichigan law, this -- the Douglas case doesn't govern the\ndisposition. Ultimately the -- the controlling is Ross.\nAnd the issue then is whether Michigan provides a\nmeaningful access to an indigent defendant who wants to\nbring an application for leave. That's really the -- I\nthink the heart of the constitutional issue.\nThere are three distinct characteristics of the\nMichigan system. The -- the nature of the review is\ndiscretionary, and I think comparable to the kind of\nreview in Ross that was described by this Court for the\nNorth Carolina Supreme Court.\nMr. Moran makes a claim that the Michigan Court\nof Appeals is an error-correcting court. With regard to\napplications for leave where there is no right to have the\nmerits reviewed, it is not an error-correcting court. In\nfact, one of the reasons for the legislation in Michigan,\nthe reason the Michigan constitution was changed was\nbecause of the heavy volume that the Michigan Court of\nAppeals was facing. There are 28 judges in the Michigan\nCourt of Appeals, and they produce --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Do they all sit\ntogether?\nMR. RESTUCCIA: No. They're panels of three.\nThey issue about 4,000 opinions each year. So each judge\nis responsible for authoring --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But it's just one\ncourt.\nMR. RESTUCCIA: One court. That's right. So\neach judge is responsible for authoring between 130-140\nopinions, having to join in another 280. So resource\nallocation is one of the pressing concerns in the Michigan\nCourt of Appeals.\nThe situations in which the court of appeals\nwill grant leave on application are rare. It's -- it's\nreluctant to grant leave in these cases in part because of\nthe --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then why -- if it's just\ndenying -- or not granting appeal, why does it use the\nboiler plate, for lack of merit in the grounds presented?\nMR. RESTUCCIA: It's used that standard order\nfor the last 20 years or longer. The only Michigan Court\nof Appeals case in -- only published case in an\napplication for leave setting is the Bobenal case cited by\nthe people in our -- the State of Michigan in its brief,\nin which the Michigan Court of Appeals said there is no --\nthis is not a determination on the merits.\nThe only published case for Michigan in which\nthere was an application for leave from a plea-based\nconviction is People v. Berry in which the Michigan Court\nof Appeals, after initially having denied leave, then in a\ncollateral attack granted leave on the very same issue and\nsaid that its original --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why -- sorry. Finish. I just\nhad a -- I wanted to go back to something you said, but I\nwant you to be finished.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could I ask about grounds\npresented before we get off this? Is it conceivable that\nthe lack of merit in the grounds presented means lack of\nmerit in the -- in the grounds of application? Is -- is\nthe applicant required to state why this particular appeal\nis worthy of being entertained?\nMR. RESTUCCIA: They're supposed to raise those\narguments. I think that's exactly right, that merits can\nhave different meanings, and it can -- it can relate to\nwhether it would justify the resources of the court to\nexamine the underlying merits of the claim. I think\nthat's right.\nThat's one understanding of the -- of the order\nthat's consistent with the way it's been treated by the\ncourt of appeals and also, most importantly, by the\nMichigan constitution, when the people of the State of\nMichigan said trial-based convictions, there's an appeal\nas of right. For all other convictions, for plea-based\nconvictions, it would be by leave. The Michigan's Supreme\nCourt, in examining this very question about the nature of\nreview, said that it was discretionary.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What of Mr. -- Mr. Moran's\npoint that this -- whatever the merits are, it counts as\nlaw of the case and it's -- it conclusively determines the\nissues presented?\nMR. RESTUCCIA: That's not what happened in --\nin People -- in the Bobenal case, which was a court of\nappeals published decision where the order read virtually\nidentical -- identically to this one, and the court of\nappeals said it could -- would not be bound by its\noriginal denial of leave for the lack of merits on the\ngrounds presented and reached the merits of the claim.\nThe same thing happened in -- in the Berry case\nin which --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that was the same court,\nthough, wasn't it?\nMR. RESTUCCIA: Right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But what -- what about\npreclusion on other courts?\nMR. RESTUCCIA: The --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In litigation in other courts.\nThey -- did -- did they ever say there is no claim or\nissue preclusion in other courts as a result of -- of our\ndenials?\nMR. RESTUCCIA: The court of appeals was only\nexamining its effect on itself, and wasn't examining on\nsubsequent courts.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And any -- any court, I mean,\nin -- in theory, can -- can revise its own -- its own\nopinions. But the -- I mean, we look to preclusion really\non -- on the effect of the judgment in another court, and\nI take it they have not ruled on that.\nMR. RESTUCCIA: Well, but both -- both opinions,\nin Bobenal and Berry, the court said it was not a ruling\non the merits. In other words, if a subsequent court then\nsaid it was a merits determination, it would be\ninconsistent with the holding from Bobenal and it would be\ninconsistent with Berry with saying the merits have not\nbeen reached.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And they have said the same,\nyou tell us, as to Federal courts.\nMR. RESTUCCIA: Right. The Federal courts\nhave --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, that's another court,\nand -- and they are not asserting that they've decided on\nthe merits in Federal court.\nMR. RESTUCCIA: The Federal courts have been\nambiguous. In other words, the Abela case -- they said --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not talking about what the\nFederal courts have said. I'm talking about what -- what\nMichigan has said and -- and what the court of -- has the\ncourt of appeals spoken on that subject?\nMR. RESTUCCIA: Yes. The court of appeals in\nthe Bobenal case said, in fact, examining virtually the\nidentical language of the issue raised here, that this was\nnot a decision on the merits and that it was not itself\nbound as law of the case because the merits had not been\nresolved.\nI think the Bulger case is kind of the paramount\ncase because it is the Michigan Supreme Court conferring\nthe proper legal understanding of the applications for\nleave, and it said that the nature of the leave is\ndiscretionary. I think that fits with common sense\nunderstanding because there is no right to have the merits\nreviewed. Otherwise, it wouldn't make sense to say the\napplication were discretionary if a defendant would have a\nclaim to have any error corrected. Otherwise, he would\nhave a claim on the court of appeals. The court of\nappeals has full authority to make the determination that\neven if everything alleged is true, it's not going to\ncorrect the error.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Look, this is what I'm -- I'm\ninterested in. It seems like Michigan is unique here.\nWhy not do, if you're worried about resources, what other\nStates have done? You just say, okay, of course, you have\na right to an appeal and, of course, you have a lawyer.\nWe'll give it to you if you're poor. But, by the way, if\nyou want to plead guilty, we're not entering into that\ndeal unless you waive it.\nMR. RESTUCCIA: Well, I think that, in a way,\nMichigan provides a -- a greater protection by enabling\nitself. What the court of appeals is essentially doing\nwith its review is for the -- for a case where there's a\n-- an -- an egregious set of facts, it can reach in and\ngrant an application and review it on the merits. It's a\n-- it's -- it's a kind of a determination about resource\nallocation, making kind of the hard choices about policy\ndecisions that States have to make.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is this a case where it would\nmeet the standard for granting leave to appeal?\nMR. RESTUCCIA: No. This -- for -- for Mr.\nHalbert --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Because of the error in\nscoring?\nMR. RESTUCCIA: In fact, anyone who's very\nfamiliar with the Michigan guideline system would\nrecognize that Mr. Halbert, if anything, received a break\nin the scoring of the guidelines. That -- that ultimately\nthe Offense Variable 13 is a very easy answer to why it\nwas properly scored.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: You take the position that in\nfact there was no error in scoring.\nMR. RESTUCCIA: No. The -- there was no error\nin scoring. The Offense Variable 13 claim relates to\nthree -- whether the defendant had committed three --\nthree offenses against a person within the -- within 5\nyears. Michigan allows a determination based on\npreponderance even if there was no conviction entered.\nMr. Halbert was a serial child molester who\nadmitted to having sexually assaulted his 14-year-old\nstepdaughter, a 10-year-old girl, a 6-year-old girl. All\nthat information was in the presentence investigation\nreport. There was no objection to the scoring of Offense\nVariable 13 because he admitted to the sexual assaults.\nThere was -- it was never raised --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I thought at page 36 of your\nbrief that you agreed that he made a correct -- that there\nwas an error in -- of application.\nMR. RESTUCCIA: Right. The Offense Variable 9\nwas -- there was an error with respect to that, but it\nwouldn't affect the ultimate position he would be placed\nin the -- in the brackets. In fact, the only error that\ndid occur that would have affected the scoring was one in\nhis favor, which would have put him -- put him in a higher\nbracket. So he in fact --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So there were at least two\nerrors. How they balance out I guess is your view they\ndidn't hurt him at all.\nMR. RESTUCCIA: Well, in fact, if anything,\nhelped him. But on a more basic level --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is that correct? There were\ntwo errors in the --\nMR. RESTUCCIA: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- at least.\nMR. RESTUCCIA: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And he contends there were two\nmore, and that hasn't been resolved.\nMR. RESTUCCIA: That's -- that's right, but I --\nI think those claims are --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So at -- at least we have to\nassume that it was not an error-free sentencing\nproceeding.\nMR. RESTUCCIA: Yes.\nWell, more importantly, the kinds of issues at\nplay for the sentencing cases are all like this. They --\nthey relate to the minimum sentencing. Michigan systems\nthen determine from a maximum -- from a minimum to a\nmaximum which will get a -- a range of time. All the --\nthese sentencing guideline cases relate to the minimum\nsentence.\nFor Mr. Halbert as a sex offender, this is\nreally a question about when he will be eligible for\nrelease from the Department of Corrections. He's going to\nbe facing 30 years because all the sentences in Michigan\nare set by the statute. So these oral arguments relating\nlesser liberty --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask another question?\nAm I correct in assuming from the order entered on page 43\nof the joint appendix that even though there were lots of\nerrors there, the fact that they were not raised until\nafter December 11th would have precluded review at the\ntrial court level?\nMR. RESTUCCIA: No. His -- the point of the\ntrial court there was that the defendant, if he wanted to\nwithdraw his plea, should have raised that before the\nsentencing itself because the court has discretion before\nsentencing to let him out of his plea. After sentencing,\nhe has to show that the plea was invalid. So his time --\nhe was untimely trying to withdraw his plea because he was\nconcerned about consecutive as against concurrent\nsentences.\nIn -- in summary, the -- the Michigan system --\nthe -- with the limited date to the review and the kinds\nof issues from plea-based convictions that are at issue\nare not -- are lesser liberty interest questions because\nthey have to do with amount of punishment. The Michigan\nsystem extends the relationship of trial counsel to the\ndefendant and asks the trial counsel to raise the motions\nregarding post-conviction motions which will enable him to\nhave a factual record from which to advance his claims.\nHe's not left to shift for himself, that there is a\ncounsel appointed to identify those meritorious claims --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But if the counsel happens to\nbe incompetent, that's the end of the ball game.\nMR. RESTUCCIA: And that's always the\ncircumstance for a defendant who's bringing a\ndiscretionary application where his prior counsel was\nineffective, that he can be left to identify the\nmeritorious claims on his own and to make the argument of\nineffective assistance of counsel.\nThat's true in Ross as well where your first --\nwhere your first appeal as of right, your -- your\nappellate counsel is incompetent. You're going to be left\nto identify those meritorious claims, raise the issue of\nineffective assistance of counsel, and to try to avoid\nprocedural bars that you'll be facing.\nEvery system is going to have to draw that line\nand to say that at some point you're not going to get\nappointed another attorney. Just because there's access\nto the system doesn't mean there always has to be another\nattorney appointed. Otherwise, the point is that you\nwould have to have two attorneys make a review on your\ncase, whereas there is no right to an appeal here that\nthis Court has recognized that ultimately where there --\nsince there is no right to appeal, that he had an\nopportunity to have a trial counsel --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But, of course, if he had had\npaid counsel, he would not have had these handicaps.\nMR. RESTUCCIA: That's right, that the -- there\nis some advantage, but that's not the ultimate answer.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Competent paid counsel.\nMR. RESTUCCIA: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nRestuccia.\nMr. Schaerr, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GENE C. SCHAERR\nON BEHALF OF LOUISIANA, ET AL.,\nAS AMICI CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMR. SCHAERR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nLike the Sixth Circuit's invalidation of this\nMichigan statute in the Tesmer case, petitioner's attempt\nto invalidate that statute here runs counter to this\nCourt's longstanding tradition of deference to the people\nof the individual States and to their legislatures in the\ndesign and implementation of their criminal justice\nsystems. As the Court said in Coleman v. Thompson, a case\nlike this is a case about federalism because it involves\nthe respect that Federal courts must pay to States and the\nStates' procedural rules.\nRespect for the State's choices is especially\nimportant here because, as the Court put it in Medina v.\nCalifornia, preventing and dealing with crime is much more\nthe business of the States than it is of the Federal\nGovernment. And therefore, the Court said we should not\nlightly construe the Constitution so as to intrude upon\nthe administration of justice by the individual States.\nAnd -- and as to the question of -- of when to\nprovide State-paid counsel, as Justice O'Connor reminded\nus in Murray v. Giarratano, that's a choice that should be\none of legislative choice, especially since it involves\ndifficult policy considerations and the allocation of\nscarce legal resources.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, I take it that the basic\nrule that we've followed -- and this is what people are\narguing about -- could be a criminal trial or proceeding,\nplea, something in a trial court.\nMR. SCHAERR: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It emerges with a judgment, and\nthen there is going to be the first review. Call it a\nleave to appeal, call it an appeal, call it whatever you\nwant, but it is the first review. And in those two\ninstances, State, if the defendant is poor, give him a\nlawyer. That's simple. That's clear. Everybody could\nunderstand it. They may not even have a lot of legal\narguments.\nNow, what significant -- what does that prevent\na State from doing that it's reasonably important for a\nState to want to do?\nMR. SCHAERR: Well, again, Justice Breyer, it's\na question of allocating scarce legal resources. If you\n-- and this case is a perfect example of that. This case\nis not -- does not involve an appeal as of right. It\ninvolves a discretionary appeal, and -- and that's the\nvast bulk of -- of appeals that are addressed by the -- by\nthe Michigan Court of Appeals. So if you impose here on\nthe State of Michigan an obligation to provide counsel in\nall of those cases, you are, in essence, forcing the\npeople of Michigan to reallocate their legal resources\naway from other cases or you're requiring the legislature\nto increase taxes to pay for that -- to pay for that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there any other State that's\ndone it the way Michigan has?\nMR. SCHAERR: I don't believe there's another\nState that's done it exactly the same way. But I -- but I\nwould point out -- and I think this is important, Justice\nBreyer -- that -- that at least according to the Michigan\nSupreme Court in the Bulger case, the majority of States\ndon't allow any appeal at all from a plea-based\nconviction. 21 of them rule it out entirely and\nexpressly, and another 17 effectively rule out appeals\nfrom plea-based convictions by -- by allowing prosecutors\nto impose that -- impose a waiver as a condition of\nentering into a plea. So -- so the relevant universe for\ncomparison is quite small here. It's really 12 States at\nmost, and -- and Michigan sort of fits within the middle\nof those States in terms of the amount of resources that\nit provides and opportunities that it provides.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Are you saying -- I just want\nto be clear -- that even if this defendant had had paid\ncounsel, he would not have had any right to appeal to the\nintermediate court?\nMR. SCHAERR: That's correct. It -- it's\ndiscretionary, and that's clear not just -- not just from\nanalysis of the -- of the Michigan courts' opinions, but\nfrom the provision of the -- of -- but from the\nconstitutional provision that -- that created this entire\ncontroversy, which was added in 1994. It's article I,\nsection 20. And that constitutional provision itself\ndraws a sharp distinction between appeals of right and\nappeals by leave of court. So even if the Michigan courts\nwanted to have a system of -- of mandatory appeals,\nthey're now precluded by the Michigan constitution from\ndoing that.\nAnd so -- and so clearly, if this Court adheres\nto the sharp distinction and -- which I think is equally\nsharp and clear, that this Court has made between --\nbetween appeals of right and discretionary appeals --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's not that -- it's not\nthat sharp because it was -- in Ross, it was the second\nappeal. So here we have one factor that is like Douglas,\nGriffin, and one factor that's like Ross. You can't say\nthat it falls in one camp more than the other. This is\nthe first-tier appeal.\nMR. SCHAERR: I -- I understand, Justice\nGinsburg, but -- but that's not the distinction that I\nunderstand this Court's decisions draw. Several times\nsince Douglas and Ross, this Court has said that the right\nto paid counsel addressed in Douglas extends only to the\nfirst appeal of right and no further. And that's --\nthat's Coleman and -- and Finley, among others.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, the question is\nwhether the words, of right, were essential to that\nstatement.\nMR. SCHAERR: I -- I'm assuming that the Court\nwas being careful in its -- in its choice of words, and I\nbelieve it was because that -- that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Because then it wouldn't have\nneeded to include the word first.\nMR. SCHAERR: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But then the word first was\nredundant, not the words, of right.\nMR. SCHAERR: No, I don't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You can have two appeals of\nright --\nMR. SCHAERR: That's right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- I suppose if you wanted to.\nMR. SCHAERR: That's right.\nNow, so -- so the real question here, with\nregard to the right to paid counsel, is does it make sense\nto extend what the Court did in Douglas to this new\nsituation. We think it does not. This Court's decisions,\nRoss and Justice Kennedy's concurrence in -- in Murray, as\nI recall, draw -- draw a distinction between the removal\nof barriers that the State imposes to the exercise of\nlitigation rights on the one hand and, on the other hand,\nsubsidizing, affirmatively subsidizing litigation rights\nAnd -- and I think this Court's care in\ndistinguishing between appeals of right and discretionary\nappeals reflects a desire to cabin Douglas and -- and to\navoid any further excursions into the area of subsidies.\nAnd we think that's a -- we think that's -- we think\nthat's good as a matter of policy for the Court to do\nthat, for one thing --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May -- may I ask you one thing\nlest we forget it? Is -- is your argument premised on the\nassumption that a refusal to hear an appeal is -- is not\nregarded as a determination on the merits and thus\npreclusive?\nMR. SCHAERR: No, I don't think so. I -- I\nthink that helps the argument. But in fact, there are\nlots of discretionary appeals or discretionary appellate\nproceedings that -- that do result in decisions on the\nmerits. This Court, for example, sometimes summarily\naffirms or reverses on cert, and the fact that the Court\ndoes that doesn't create --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we accept cert before we\ndo that. I thought the question was that the denial of an\napplication for appeal does not have any merits\nconsequence. Wasn't that the question?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does the denial of an\napplication for appeal have any merits consequence?\nMR. SCHAERR: Well, as -- if -- if that's the\nquestion, I -- I would defer to -- to Michigan counsel --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. But I'm asking whether\nthat's a premise of your argument because the consequences\nof your argument are going to be very different depending\non whether that is the premise or whether it isn't,\nwhether that premise is true or whether it isn't.\nMR. SCHAERR: I -- I think the distinction is --\nis not necessarily whether the decisions are on the merits\nor not. I think the distinction is between appeals of\nright and -- and appeals that are discretionary.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If it's always on the merits,\nit's an -- it's an appeal of right, it seems to me. How\ncan you have a -- a discretionary appeal which always\ndecides the merits of the case?\nMR. SCHAERR: Well, I -- in -- in fact, I don't\nthink that's what happens in Michigan, and -- and I think\nthe --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So your -- the assumption of\nyour argument is that it is not on the merits. I.e., it\nis not a merits determination if there's a denial and\nhence there is no preclusion.\nMR. SCHAERR: I -- I think that's true. Whether\nit's an assumption of the argument, I'm not -- I'm not so\nsure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're talking about a piece of\npaper, that first piece of paper saying to the appeals\ncourt, appeals court, please hear my appeal.\nMR. SCHAERR: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And then it lists a whole lot\nof reasons like a cert petition.\nMR. SCHAERR: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And those are likely to do with\nthe merits of the case. I mean, they'll tell all the\nhorrible things that went on. And the question is, is he\ngoing to have a lawyer to help him with that piece of\npaper or not?\nMR. SCHAERR: That's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now -- now, it\nsounds to me just the kind of thing you'd write if you had\nan appeal on the merits too. No. It's even harder. Even\nharder. You've got to convince them to take it.\nMR. SCHAERR: It -- it is more difficult, but --\nbut the disparity between --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So why draw that distinction?\nThe piece of paper is the same, even harder to write,\nneeds the lawyer as much, first chance he gets after the\ntrial court. Why draw that distinction?\nMR. SCHAERR: Well, again, because -- because if\nyou -- if you broaden the right to State-paid counsel, as\n-- as in Douglas, you're going to require States to -- to\nreallocate resources to that priority and away from other\npriorities.\nAlso, if you -- if you subsidize litigation in\nthe name of providing adequate access to courts or\nmeaningful access to courts, then there's going to be a\nlot of litigation in the lower Federal courts about\nexactly how much of a subsidy is necessary to reach that\nstandard.\nAnd also, if -- and this is particularly\nimportant here I think. If you require States to\nsubsidize the exercise of a right that they're not\nrequired to provide in the first place, like the right to\nseek review of a -- of a plea-based conviction, then you\ngive the States a strong incentive to cut back on or\neliminate that right altogether. And -- and, you know,\nwho knows? But perhaps that's what's going on in the --\nin the trend in the States away from providing this right.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nSchaerr.\nMr. Moran, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. MORAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. MORAN: Thank you.\nI have to begin by correcting several\nmisstatements of fact and of Michigan law. First of all,\nMr. Schaerr just said that only a dozen States, I believe,\nallow for appeals from guilty pleas. That's not correct.\nEvery State in the United States currently allows for\nappeals from guilty plea -- pleas.\nThe Bulger case did say that. They cited a --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Appeals as of right?\nMR. MORAN: Not necessarily. As I cited in my\nbrief, a number of States allow for applications or\npetitions from guilty pleas, but every State has a first-\ntier direct appeal from guilty pleas. The Bulger -- the\nMichigan Supreme Court in Bulger cited a -- an article\nfrom an Arizona Attorney magazine that was simply\nincorrect on that.\nSecondly, on the issue of what is the effect of\na order denying leave to appeal for lack of merit on the\ngrounds presented, the State continues to rely on McKenzie\nv. Smith, an earlier Sixth Circuit opinion, People v.\nBerry, and Bobenal v. Saginaw Investment. None of those\ncases uses the phrase, lack of merit on the grounds\npresented. That phrase does not appear in any of those\nthree cases.\nThe Berry and the Bobenal cases, those are\nMichigan Court of Appeals cases before 1981. Beginning in\n1981, in a series of three cases, People v. Douglas,\nPeople v. Hayden, and People v. Wiley, the Michigan Court\nof Appeals held unambiguously that our orders denying\napplications or remand orders, in that case, for lack of\nmerit on the grounds presented, was law of the case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's the effect of the\nconstitutional provision then?\nMR. MORAN: I'm sorry? I -- I don't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If that's so, what is the\neffect of the constitutional provision that Mr. Schaerr\nread?\nMR. MORAN: The Michigan constitutional\nprovision? It changes the way in which guilty plea\nappeals proceed. Before 1994, there were other types of\nappeals that had to proceed by application for leave to\nappeal, primarily late appeals. If the appeal was filed\ntoo late, it had to proceed by application for leave to\nappeal.\nIn 1994, as a result of the constitutional\namendment, guilt plea appeals now have to proceed by\napplication for leave to appeal. That's constitutional.\nWe have no problem with that, and that is the method by\nwhich the caseload management problems have been solved.\nThey have been solved.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I -- you -- you have the\nwrong one. I meant the one that said that applications to\nthe court of appeals are -- are -- require leave to\nappeal. What's the effect of that?\nMR. MORAN: The -- I assume you're still\nreferring to article I, section 20 of the Michigan\nconstitution.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. It says that for the\ncourt of appeals, you need leave to appeal. I thought\nthey were doing something there. What were they doing?\nMR. MORAN: They were saying that first-tier\nfelony appeals in Michigan following pleas require leave\nof the court, require an application for leave to appeal,\nlike late appeals from trial cases do. But all of those\nappeals are still decided on the merits with preclusive\neffect for law of the case purposes. And the Sixth\nCircuit specifically dealt with that in -- in the Abela\ncase. McKenzie v. Smith never -- never mentions anything\nabout the lack of merit in the grounds presented.\nThe resource allocations point is simply that\nnot all of these guilty plea appeals are -- lead to full\nargument and full briefing, and that's fine. Michigan can\ndo that. But what Michigan cannot do, as a result of\nEllis and Douglas, is for that first gatekeeping part of\nthe appeal, which is where the court has to decide is\nthere merit in this case, to make the indigent shift for\nhimself. And so in -- in Smith v. Robbins, this Court,\nspecifically referring back to the Ellis case, said that\nthe problem that the Court identified in Ellis and that\nbecame part of the constitutional minimum in Douglas, was\nthat the old California procedure did not require -- I see\nmy time is up.\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Moran.\n"
