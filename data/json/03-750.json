        "content": "(10:01 a.m.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Boas, the Court will hear\nargument in Small against the United States.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. BOAS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BOAS: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThis case presents the issue of whether, when\ndeciding the meaning of a statute, we will focus, as the\nGovernment suggests, on two words only, any court, or\nwhether we will look at the statute as a whole, whether we\nwill consider the statute as a symmetrical and coherent\nregulatory scheme and decide the meaning of the statute by\nappreciating how sections relate to one another.\nIn this particular case, 922(g)(1) of 18 U.S.\nCode is a -- represents a merger of two old sections,\ntitle IV and title VII, that were passed in 1968 in the\nOmnibus Crime Control Act. In -- in those -- in that\nstatute, we had two redundant and overlapping sections,\nand one talked about prohibiting persons who have been\nconvicted in any court of a crime punishable by more than\na year. One, title VII, talked about prohibiting persons\nconvicted in any court of the United States or a State of\na felony. There were different penalties, slightly\ndifferent classes of people. Title IV focused more on the\nreceiver; title VII more on the possessor. But nothing --\nnothing about the -- these two titles, about the\nlegislative history suggests that Congress at any time\nmeant something different from the term, any court, in\ntitle IV and any court of the United States in title VII.\nAnd when these two were merged in 1986 in the\nFirearms Owners' Protection Act, again, nothing suggests,\nnothing in the comments, nothing in the statute, that\nthese two terms -- that the elimination of the language,\nany court of the United States, was --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, I guess we have held,\nthough, several times that Congress meant to define very\nbroadly when it enacted felon in possession of firearm\nstatutes. Did we not?\nMR. BOAS: That's -- that's correct, Justice\nO'Connor. However --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: So it makes it a tougher case\nwhen you use the word any because we've given the -- the\nword any generally a broad definition.\nMR. BOAS: Well, earlier this year in the Nixon\ncase, this Court said that when we look at any -- and that\nwas a case dealing with the meaning of any entity. Did it\nmean any entity, public or private, or any private entity?\nThe Court said any can and does mean different things\ndepending upon the setting, and the Court said when using\nit broadly would lead to strange and indeterminate\nresults, we'll give it a more narrow reading, which the\nCourt did.\nNow, you're right, Justice O'Connor. This Court\nhas said that the purpose of the felon in possession\nstatute was to be broad and sweeping, but the Government\nreiterates that view, citing repeatedly three cases,\nScarborough, Bass, and Lewis, and all three of those cases\nin which the Court referred to Congress' comments and this\nCourt's own comments about the broad sweep of the statute\nwere 1202(a) cases. And so notwithstanding the fact that\nthe Court said this is a broad statute, each one of those\ncases, Lewis, Bass, and Scarborough, were cases where by\ndefinition the prohibition was against persons convicted\nin any court of the United States or a State. So that\nlanguage doesn't help the Government at all because those\nwere 1202(a) cases which limited specifically the Court to\nany court of the United States.\nSo to take the -- and I -- and -- the simplistic\nview that as the -- as the Fourth and Sixth Circuit did\nand as the Government does here, that any means any,\nwithout regard to the rest of the statute, is simply -- is\n-- is too narrow a focus.\nLet's look at the statute. It's true that the\nword -- the term, the two words, any court, is not\ndefined. But if we look in the definitions section, the\nterm, crime punishable by more than a year, is defined.\nAnd so what we should really be focusing on is the phrase,\nconvicted in any court of a crime punishable by more than\na year. And that definition says the term, crime\npunishable by more than a year, excludes any State or\nFederal antitrust or business regulatory offense.\nNow, if we exclude from the definition of crime\npunishable by more than a year and the Government's -- if\nwe exclude from that any State or Federal antitrust law\nand the Government's interpretation is adopted, then we're\nleft with the anomalous result that if a person is\nconvicted of an antitrust offense in this country, they're\nallowed to possess a firearm. If they're convicted of one\nin France or England, they can't.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Are there any such cases? I\nmean, I never heard actually --\nMR. BOAS: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- when people -- no. I mean,\nare there any cases in which France or England has\nconvicted people of an antitrust violation punishable by\nimprisonment for more than a year? I -- I didn't know\nthat their antitrust laws had a criminal aspect, though I\nhaven't looked it up.\nMR. BOAS: Nor have I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fine. Well, I -- I've never\nheard if anyone in any foreign country, other than ours,\nthough I gather my law clerk found that in Japan, in fact,\nJapan does have a criminal antitrust law. They may be the\nonly ones outside the United States, and I don't know that\nanyone has ever been convicted under it because they're\nnot too -- or they didn't used to be too fierce on\nantitrust enforcement.\nMR. BOAS: Well, 921(20) or --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm just wondering how\nanomalous or your anomaly is.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BOAS: Well, the -- the limitation not only\nexcludes antitrust offenses, it excludes any business\nregulatory offense.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And are there such?\nMR. BOAS: Of course. I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, maybe.\nMR. BOAS: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't -- I don't -- but I\njust -- are we sure that there -- that, you know, that\nthis anomaly exists?\nMR. BOAS: I'm certain that there are\nbusiness regulatory crimes throughout the world.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why did they say any State or\nFederal? I mean, in -- in a way this provision -- you --\nyou may say that the -- that the substantive effect of the\nprovision supports your interpretation, but the text of\nthe provision supports the Government's --\nMR. BOAS: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- because if any only means\nState or Federal, there was no need to say State or\nFederal in this provision. You could have simply said any\nin this provision, just as you said it elsewhere. So one\nwould think that they said State or Federal because they\nwanted to exclude foreign antitrust matters.\nMR. BOAS: Well, this same limitation, Justice\nScalia, existed as a limitation under 1202(a) where any\ncourt said any State or Federal court and the exclusion\nsaid any State or Federal court. It's consistent --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't care how it got\nthere. I'm just saying there -- there -- if -- if any\nmeans what you said it means, namely State or Federal,\nthere would have been no need to limit this other\nprovision to State or Federal because the whole statute\nwould only cover State or Federal.\nMR. BOAS: Well, but at some point in the\nstatute, Congress has to give an indication of their\nintent, and this is where it is.\nFor example, there's another limitation\nimmediately following it which says it shall also not\ninclude any State offense which is described as a\nmisdemeanor in the State and carries no more than 2 years.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No. Well, but -- but Justice\nScalia's point -- and I -- I think he's correct -- is that\nthis cuts at least as much in favor of the Government as\nyou and probably more because you would make Federal and\nState unnecessary surplus.\nMR. BOAS: Well, there has to be some\nindication --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You don't -- you don't set\nforth the main qualification to the main definition in a\n-- in a later subsection.\nMR. BOAS: Well, if we go further with 921(20),\nthere's another limitation that again clearly deals with\nStates, and that's the restoration of civil rights\nprovision. The Government concedes in their brief -- and\nthat was an effort to essentially statutorily reverse the\nDickerson v. Banner Institute case -- that that applies to\nState situations. The idea that if a person receives a\nState pardon or his record is expunged, that wouldn't be a\ndisqualifying factor. And they talk about the law of the\nforeign state being what determines whether it's a\nconviction or not. Now, clearly we're not looking at\ngoing to some pardon process in Germany or Uruguay to\ndecide whether a person still has a conviction.\nAnother part of the statute that's very clear,\n924(e)(1). That's the armed career criminal section.\nThat section says that if a person's who's convicted under\n922(g)(1), our statute, and has three prior serious drug\nconvictions in a court described in 922(g)(1), then they\nget 15 years. Now, that definition of serious drug\nconviction is a State or Federal conviction.\nNow, let's flip over to 21 U.S.C. 802(44), the\ndrug statute where you have a similar recidivist type of\nstatute where you go from a 5-year mandatory to a 10-year\nmandatory if you have a prior drug conviction. There in\n802(44), a serious drug offense is defined as a State,\nFederal, or foreign drug offense. So we see that Congress\ncan differentiate when it wants to.\nNow, they're --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would -- would you concede\nthat -- that this is at least sloppy drafting? Because\nthey said any in one place, they said State or Federal in\nother places. Shouldn't they be -- be consistent in their\nterminology?\nMR. BOAS: Well, perhaps they should be more\nconsistent, Justice Ginsburg, but the overall -- I mean,\nif you go down the list of the prohibitions in 922(g)(1),\nyou can see that the thrust of this is -- is to deal with\ndomestic situations. There's one that says you can't own\na firearm if you're a -- a fugitive from law -- a fugitive\nfrom justice. That's specifically defined as a fugitive\nfrom another State within the United States.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Boas, I think you make a\nstrong argument that Congress probably didn't think of\nthis particular problem. Do you suppose if at the\nhearings before the committee, the process of the\nlegislation, some witness came in and said, do you realize\nthis language is so broad it will cover the person who is\nconvicted of a felony in Japan, as well as person who's\nconvicted of a felony in Illinois, do you think they would\nhave modified the statute?\nMR. BOAS: I think they would have. I think\nthat -- I don't concede that there was really a need to,\nbut I think they would have because they would have said\nit's --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, there would have been a\nneed to under your view now.\nMR. BOAS: That's right. But they would have\nhistorically going back to '68 and before, we always\nintended this to just cover domestic situations.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But I suppose somebody on the\ncommittee might have said, well, we don't want this kind\nof person to have a gun, and the fact he's convicted in\nJapan rather than in Brooklyn really doesn't make any\ndifference with regard to the purpose of the statute.\nMR. BOAS: If the individual is convicted in\nJapan, Justice Stevens, then he would not be under our\nimmigration laws allowed to come to this country, and if\nhe did come --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but this person --\nMR. BOAS: -- he'd be an illegal alien.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the defendant in this case\nwas convicted in Japan and he somehow got to the United\nStates.\nMR. BOAS: Well, because he's an American\ncitizen.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well --\nMR. BOAS: So -- but Congress can't cure every\nproblem that exists in the world, and this statute is\nfairly comprehensive.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Are people really not allowed\nto come in if they've been convicted of any crime?\nMR. BOAS: Any crime that carries more than a\nyear basically. It's pretty --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose it was a crime like not\nwearing a veil if you're a woman in a country that --\nsuppose it was a crime like criticizing the government if\nyou were in Soviet Russia. Suppose it was a crime like --\nyou know, there are all kinds of crimes that we -- we\nwould never consider crimes --\nMR. BOAS: Well, that's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and in other countries there\nare -- we don't let anyone in if they've done any of those\nthings?\nMR. BOAS: No. Well, those people will probably\nbe seeking political asylum. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn --\nunder the Government's interpretation, Nobel Prize winners\nwould be precluded from -- Solzhenitsyn did 8 years in a\nSoviet prison because he said nasty things about Joseph\nStalin. Two American women in Afghanistan, before the\nfall of the Taliban regime, were arrested and convicted\nbecause they possessed Bibles. Now, the Government says,\nwell, these are anomalies. These don't occur often. But\nCongress had to be aware of the possibility of tinhorn\ndictatorships all over the world having court systems that\nwere so devoid of due process that we have to take a look\nat whether we want to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the -- the court of\nappeals here said what it would -- it read in a check. It\nsaid it wouldn't read it to really mean any conviction.\nIt had to be in a system that was fundamentally fair.\nWasn't that what the court of appeals said?\nMR. BOAS: That's what they said, but -- but\nwhen and how do we decide that? There's another offense\nunder 922(g) -- or under 922 that makes it a crime to\ngive a false answer on a -- a firearms questionnaire when\nyou go to buy the gun -- buy the gun. Now, what does the\nindividual do? Does he say to the firearms dealer, do you\nhave a list of countries where our Government has decided\nit's a fair enough system that I can say no -- yes, I have\na conviction in view of the list that it's an unfair\nsystem so I can say yes, I have no -- or no, I have no\nconvictions?\nI mean, it -- one of the reasons where we\nemploy, for example, the rule of lenity, is -- is a person\nput on notice of what it is that's criminal and what is\nnot. When does it come up that the system isn't fair\nenough to count?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I think -- let -- let's\nput, you know, the worst for you. If it were put to\nCongress, which would you prefer, that -- that\nSolzhenitsyn not be able to have a gun or that the worst\nkind of violent criminal convicted and imprisoned and\nescaped from a foreign country who manages to get into\nthis country can go in and buy a gun? Which -- which of\nthese two would you prefer? And I think I'd say, well,\nyou know, it's tough on Solzhenitsyn he can't own a gun,\nbut he'll probably get over it.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BOAS: Well, what I'd prefer and what the\nstatute means aren't necessarily the same thing, Your\nHonor. I'd prefer violent criminals who are dangerous\nnot to have guns. But again, that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose you put the question to\nCongress, which would you prefer? Would you prefer the\noccasional person who's been convicted of a foreign court,\ncomes over here, that this statute doesn't apply to him,\nor would you prefer that all the refugees from Eastern\nEurope and people who come from Arab countries and people\nwho come from countries that have quite different systems\nin places all over the world discover that suddenly\nthey're felons because of things they never would have\ndreamt of because they were perhaps convicted of selling\ngasoline on the open market or perhaps they were convicted\nof any of these religious crimes we've talked about,\nselling a Bible? Suppose you put that question to\nCongress.\nMR. BOAS: I think Congress would say the perils\nand problems that exist by a blanket inclusion without any\nmethod of determining which count and which don't count of\nforeign convictions are too great. Now --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if it's a -- if it's a\nmatter of notice and -- then that's a separate issue.\nPlus the Government, it seems to me, should put on its\nform that this includes foreign conviction, and that\nsolves that problem.\nMR. BOAS: Well, but what if it's a foreign\nconviction where there's no due process? Is there a\nchecklist that in that foreign conviction, did you have a\njury, did you have the right to confront your accuser, did\nyou have the right to remain silent? I mean, we all seem\nto realize that the Government's position that any\nconviction anywhere is too stark a place. And again --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May -- may we go back to the\n-- the choice that you were given by Justice Scalia first\nand then Justice Breyer? I thought that someone who comes\nin here illegally and possesses a gun commits an offense.\nMR. BOAS: That's right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- so there's not\n-- Congress would say to that hypothetical, we've got a\nthird choice, much more sensible. Anybody who sneaks in\nhere without permission and has a gun --\nMR. BOAS: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- commits a crime.\nMR. BOAS: That's one of the subsections of\n922(g)(5). Anybody who's an illegal alien here illegally\ncan't have a gun. Anyone --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't cover Americans,\nof course --\nMR. BOAS: No. It doesn't cover --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- who go -- go and commit\ncrimes abroad, are convicted abroad, and -- and come back\nto home sweet home and then get a gun. I mean, that seems\nto me extraordinary.\nMR. BOAS: That -- I didn't hear your --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That seems to me extraordinary.\nI don't think Congress would have wanted that.\nMR. BOAS: Well, I don't think Congress can be\nsaid to have intended or envisioned that they would cure\nevery problem in the world. It's a very, very narrow\ncategory of American citizens convicted abroad who come\nback here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think if there was a problem\nthat -- that they were going to leave unsolved, it is less\nlikely the problem of having an American citizen killed by\na gun toted by somebody who has been convicted of a crime\nabroad than it is the problem of somebody having been\nconvicted abroad of some silly crime like wearing a veil\nor not wearing a veil or something else. If -- if it's\neither of those two problems that they meant to leave\noverlooked, I would say it's the latter. They might well\nhave said, well, the courts will take care of that.\nMR. BOAS: Well, Your Honor, it's unclear what\n-- what their thought process was in this matter. But I\ncan say this, that the narrow category that escapes the\ncoverage of this statute -- there's nothing to indicate\nanywhere in any of the debates, in the language of the\nstatute that that's what Congress intended.\nAnd again, if you look at the overall view here,\nI mean, fugitive from justice. It's limited to someone\nfrom the State. Person -- let's look at 922(g)(9). Very\nclear, incapable of misunderstanding. The same prefatory\nlanguage. A person convicted in any court -- exactly the\nsame, and it ends with the same language -- cannot ship,\npossess, receive. And what does it say? Instead of\nsaying convicted of a crime punishable by more than a\nyear, it says convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic\nviolence. And that's defined as a State or Federal\nmisdemeanor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where is that defined?\nMR. BOAS: That's defined in 921(a)(33), Your\nHonor. It's specifically limited.\nNow, here we are. A person who beats his wife\nin England can have a gun in this country, but a person\nwho commits a business regulatory offense in Germany\ncan't. It makes no sense. The -- it -- it's a very clear\nstatement by Congress that a misdemeanor crime of domestic\nviolence -- they're only intending it to be a State or\nFederal crime.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Once again, that -- that cuts\nboth ways. Why would they -- if the text reads the way\nyou say it reads, why did they have to say is a\nmisdemeanor under Federal or State law? Because it\nwouldn't have mattered. The only courts -- the only\nconvictions that would be covered would be Federal or\nState convictions. They would not need that -- that\nqualification.\nMR. BOAS: At -- at some point a person has to\nbe told what Congress was intending. This language goes\nback to '68 where the language in the exclusion limiting\nit to State -- excluding Federal and State convictions\nmatched the language in the term, any court, in 1202(a),\nwhich was title VII. They were -- they were complementing\neach other.\nAnd -- and if you look at even as far back as\nthe Batchelder decision in the '70's from this Court, the\nCourt talked about these two being redundant, overlapping,\nthe only difference being that one uses the term felony,\none uses the term crime punishable by more than a year.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Boas, when they combined\nthese two --\nMR. BOAS: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and ones -- the 1202 did\nsay Federal or State -- they made other changes,\nharmonizations. In the explanation of their consolidation\nof the two sections, to what extent did they discuss\nchanges and the reasons for them?\nMR. BOAS: The -- they made no discussion of the\nreason for taking out the language, of the United States\nor of any State, and what they -- the only language was\nthat we're intending to merge these into one statute --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But they did -- they did\nexplain other things --\nMR. BOAS: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- other changes, but this\none -- there's silence --\nMR. BOAS: Exactly.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- as far as I understand.\nMR. BOAS: And -- and by keeping in the\nexclusions, by -- by looking at 924(e)(1) where it --\nwhat's very important to me is that 924(e)(1) says if you\nhave three prior drug -- serious drug offenses in a court\nreferred to in 922(g)(1), you get 15 years. Those three\nprior three drug offenses in a court referred to in\n922(g)(1) are State or Federal drug offenses by\ndefinition. It seems to me that it really couldn't be any\nmore clear.\nAnd frankly, to the extent it's not totally\nclear and it could go either way, I think then the rule of\nlenity requires that it be decided with a more narrow\nconstruction, that is, that any court meant any court of\nthe State or of the United States.\nI believe it was in the -- in the '90's when\nthis Court's opinion, authored by Justice Thomas in I\nthink it was called Alvarez-Sanchez, dealt with a statute,\n3105 dealing with the admissibility of confessions in\nFederal cases and that they won't be inadmissible if\nthey're taken by any law enforcement official more than 6\nhours after the arrest. And the issue what does any mean\nin terms of any law enforcement official. And the Court\nsaid it means any State or Federal law enforcement\nofficial. Now, it didn't have to reach the issue of\nwhether it included foreign law enforcement officials, but\ncertain things are obvious without an -- an explanation.\nAnd you're right. There was some sloppy\ndrafting here and it could have been more clear, but when\nwe look at the statute as a whole and try to harmonize the\nvarious parts of that statute, it would be almost absurd\nto think, when we look -- and -- and maybe these anomalies\nwon't occur all the time, as you point out, Justice\nBreyer, but it would almost be absurd to think that with\nall of these limitations, exclusions, when we run down the\nlist under 922(g)(1), that Congress was talking about any\ncourt in the world. Now --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let me -- let me ask you the\nquestion the -- the Chief Justice would ask, were he here,\nbecause he always asked this kind of a question. What --\nif you had to pick your best case of ours which\ninterpreted the word any in the way that you would like us\nto interpret here, what's -- what's the best case you\nhave?\nMR. BOAS: I'd say -- that's -- there's a\nquestion --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's a good question. He asks\ngood questions.\nMR. BOAS: It's a good question.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BOAS: I'd say the Nixon case decided this\nyear which said that any can and does mean different\nthings depending upon the setting and whether it works\nstrange and indeterminate results would be one of my best\ncases. There's -- when I sit down, I'll probably think of\na better one, but --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Maybe you can think --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How -- how about --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Maybe you can think of a\nunanimous case.\nMR. BOAS: Well --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And this is one I'm -- I'm\nsurprised that you didn't cite, but it -- I don't think\nyou did -- EEOC against Arabian American Oil Company,\nwhere the wording of the statute was anyplace outside the\nUnited States, title VII coverage, and this Court held\nthat anyplace outside the United States did not mean that\na U.S. employer operating abroad had to abide by the anti-\ndiscrimination norms with respect to hiring in some place\nabroad because Congress was thinking in terms of the\ninter-State sitting -- setting and not\ninternational.\nMR. BOAS: Well, I -- I'm not familiar with that\ncase.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That -- that was a decision\nby the Chief. So --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BOAS: That's a good one -- that's a good one\ntoo, Judge -- Justice.\nI -- I -- there's -- there's another case that\nI'd refer to which is the -- the Gonzales case, which is\ncited by the Government. Gonzales is interesting because\nit deals with 924(c)(1), which is the section that says\nyou get 5 consecutive years if you're convicted of -- 5\nyears consecutive to any other sentence if you're\nconvicted of possessing a firearm during the course of a\nserious drug offense. And in that case, the Court\nconcluded that any other sentence meant any State or\nFederal sentence, not just a Federal sentence.\nNow, the Government might argue that that helps\nthem because the -- the defendant in that case wanted it\nto be limited to any Federal sentence because he was\nserving a State sentence, and the question was would the 5\nyears for the 924 violation be consecutive or concurrent,\nas the trial court gave it.\nBut it -- what the Court did was say any depends\non the context of the rest of the statute. And here, we\nthink it means State and Federal. They didn't talk about\nforeign convictions.\nYou know, it's interesting. It's ironic that --\nthat while we're debating how American citizens should be\nimpacted by foreign convictions, the administration is\nunwilling to sign the treaty that would make American\ncitizens subject to the International Criminal Court\nbecause there's concern about what would happen to\nAmericans abroad, even in that court, not in a court in --\nin Uruguay or in North Korea, but in the International\nCriminal Court.\nIn fact, in the preliminary findings of the FOPA\nstatute, the -- the Congress said -- and this Court\ndoesn't have to decide and I'm not asking the Court to\ndecide the Second Amendment issue, but Congress found the\nSecond Amendment was a fundamental constitutional right.\nAnd the name of the statute is the Firearms Owners'\nProtection Act. Congress had in mind protecting the\nowners of firearms when necessary, and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You call that FOPA? That's the\nname of the statute?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's an unfortunate acronym,\nisn't it?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BOAS: That's right. The spelling is a\nlittle bit different, Justice Scalia.\nBut Congress -- the -- the name of the statute\ntells you something about Congress' intent. The otherwise\nlicit and blameless activity of possessing a firearm isn't\nthe equivalent of selling drugs. Now, maybe if you have a\nprior drug offense and you're a drug dealer, under 802 of\n21, Congress said you get your sentence doubled whether\nit's a State, Federal, or foreign conviction, but under\n924(e) for a conviction under a court defined in\n922(g)(1), the prior only ups your sentence if it's a\nState or Federal conviction. We can't ignore the overall\nstatutory scheme here, which time and time again refers to\ndomestic matters.\nThe Government in their brief says foreign\nconvictions are used all the time, and they give three\nexamples. They say we recognize them for the purpose of\nextraditing American citizens. They say we recognize them\nbecause if you're convicted of a -- a sex offense in\ncertain foreign countries, you have to register here. And\nthey say we recognize them -- I forget what their third\nreason is. But there's no example that they gave or that\nthey can give where a foreign conviction is ever used\nanywhere else in this country as an element of the crime.\nI mean, it's used for recidivist purposes and State courts\nhave debated back and forth whether we're going to double\nsomebody's sentence because of a foreign conviction, but\nit's never used anywhere else as an element of the crime.\nThis -- this would be a first, and it's pretty\nsignificant.\nTo me it's ironic that the Sentencing Commission\nsaid you can't use a foreign conviction simply to up\nsomebody a few months in the guidelines. But the\nGovernment here argues that we can use it to satisfy an\nelement of the crime --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Recidivism is an element of the\ncrime. If -- if you have a crime of, you know, repeated\nfelony, recidivism is an element.\nMR. BOAS: Well, that -- that's correct, Your\nHonor. Of course, the -- it's an exception under Apprendi\nthat the -- the prior crime. But what -- what I'm saying\nis it's -- it's a slightly different situation in terms of\nit being -- I know we have Blakely and the whole\nsentencing factor issue. But it -- it's a slightly\ndifferent use of a prior and making -- in other -- in all\nthose cases, the -- it's a crime whether or not you have a\nfelony. The felony might make it a more serious crime.\nIn our case, this isn't a crime without this\nfelony. That's the thing that makes it a crime. And what\nI'm saying is the only situation we have where something\nthat's otherwise blameless conduct becomes a crime is the\nuse of a felony. There's no other situation where a\nforeign felony is employed or has been employed in that\nsituation.\nIf there's no other questions, I'd like to, if\nit would please the Court, reserve the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm sorry. You've exhausted\nyour time.\nMR. BOAS: I have. Well, thank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Millett.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. MILLETT: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nJustice Scalia, you asked about what case we\nwould want to adopt and be our strongest case on the\nmeaning of the word any in the statute, and my answer to\nthat question, although I take the liberty of answering\nit, though you didn't ask me --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You can ask it as well --\n(Laughter.)\nMS. MILLETT: -- is the Gonzales case where this\nCourt said that the word any in the gun control law, in\nthis context, in this framework means, read naturally --\nI'm quoting here. Read naturally, the word any has an\nexpansive meaning, that is, one or some indiscriminately\nof whatever kind.\nThis is not, Justice Ginsburg, a statute where\nCongress wrote sloppily. In fact, in Barrett and\nHuddleston, this Court specifically said and noted that\nexcruciating care with which Congress wrote title IV,\nsection --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There is -- there's an\noverarching concern and I'll -- I'd like to put it to you\nright from the beginning. When a legislature legislates,\nbe it the State or Federal Government, it is generally\nthinking in terms of its own domain, its own bailiwick.\nWhen Congress legislates, it's thinking about the United\nStates. Sometimes it's thinking about abroad, but most of\nthe time when it is, it says so.\nAnd we have a number of cases, not just the\nArabian American Oil Company. I mean, that -- the\nlanguage of title VII was between a State and anyplace\noutside thereof, anyplace outside thereof. And in that\nvery case, the Chief made the point that I'm putting to\nyou now, that Congress thinks about the United States, our\ncountry, and if it means to say something that will take\nin other places in the world, it says so clearly. And we\ndon't make the assumption that Congress was intending to\nhave any extraterritorial flip to its law unless it tells\nus that.\nThat's my overall concern about the Government's\nposition in this case.\nMS. MILLETT: Justice Ginsburg, this is not an\nextraterritorial application of a statute. This regulates\na threat to American public safety within the United\nStates by someone within the United States based on their\nconduct, possession of a firearm by a dangerous person\nwithin the United States. That is not extraterritorial\napplication of the law.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but --\nMS. MILLETT: That's no more --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- but let me just interrupt\non your -- your best case suggestion. I don't think the\ntest is when has the word any been used in different ways,\nbut has the word any court ever been used by Congress to\ninclude foreign courts.\nMS. MILLETT: The -- the phrase convicted in any\ncourt --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No. I'm asking about just the\nwords, any court. What's your best case for the\nproposition that that would normally be construed by\nCongress to include foreign courts?\nMS. MILLETT: I don't -- I don't have a case\nthat specifically talks about --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You don't have a case.\nMS. MILLETT: -- that yet, but if I can -- if I\ncan explain why the phrase convicted in any court --\nbecause any court -- the -- the problem is you're not\n-- there's not a case for that. The word, any court, that\n-- those two words appear in a lot of places in the United\nStates Code.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And do they ever refer to\nforeign courts? That's the question.\nMS. MILLETT: The -- not -- not that I'm aware\nof, but -- but they don't -- it -- it doesn't address it\none way or the other. Most of the times, the vast\nmajority of the times that you see any court in the United\nStates, it -- in the United States Code, it's followed by\nqualifying terms.\nWhat's very important here is that the phrase\nconvicted in any court without qualification. There's\nlots of any courts in the United States --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the reason you often need\nqualification is there's -- there's sort of a basic\nquestion, does this include State courts as well as -- as\nwell as Federal, and it's often necessary to spell it out\none way or the other. But I don't -- I'm not aware of any\nprecedent for trying to decide whether it also embraces\nforeign courts.\nMS. MILLETT: Justice Stevens, if I could make\ntwo points. Again, convicted in any court is rarely\nemployed by Congress. Rarely. And we've cited in our\nbrief on the occasions it has been employed, the context\nand structure are wholly consistent with including foreign\njudgments. The PATRIOT Act created a ban on the\npossession of biological agents or toxins, and it -- it\npicked up this same phrase and put it in there, and I\nthink it is -- would -- and that is also a statute that in\na separate provision has extraterritorial application.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How many times have you used\nthis statute to go after people who were convicted in a\nforeign court?\nMS. MILLETT: It -- it's -- I can't give you an\nexact number because we --\nJUSTICE BREYER: About, approximate.\nMS. MILLETT: -- we don't know about the ones\nthat we never hear about.\nJUSTICE BREYER: More like 100, more like 50,\nmore like 10, more like 5? About how many?\nMS. MILLETT: It's -- it's not that -- I would\n-- I would say there's probably 10 to a dozen, but I -- I\nhave to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: 10 to a dozen over how long a\nperiod of time? 20 years, 18 years?\nMS. MILLETT: Since 1968. It's been on the\nbooks since 1968.\nJUSTICE BREYER: '68. Now -- so 35-40 years.\nNow -- now, how many times do you think that\npeople -- I mean, the -- the -- if you've used it only a\ndozen times or so in about 40 years, then it doesn't sound\nlike a major threat. What I'm weighing against that is\nthe possibility that people are really convicted abroad of\nselling Bibles. That really does happen, and there really\nwere economic crimes in 1968 in all the Eastern European\ncountries, and these aren't fanciful examples I've been\ngiving you.\nAnd so if you were in Congress -- or -- or why\ndo you think that Congress would have wanted to get the\ncourts into the mess of trying to decide why wouldn't\nthose crimes be covered and were the procedures fair? And\nwe start distinguishing one country from another. And\nwhat are the procedures in the Ukraine or Kazakhstan\nanyway? I mean, my goodness, what a mess for the sake of\na dozen cases in 40 years.\nMS. MILLETT: Justice Breyer -- and Justice\nStevens, I do want to get back because I do have a lower\ncourt case that interprets any court in the way you\ndiscussed. I want to get back to that.\nBut Justice Breyer, I understand this being a\nvery important concern, and -- and there are no doubt\nparticular applications that could seem unappealing, just\nas in Lewis v. United States where this Court held that an\ninvalid, a patently unconstitutional State conviction\ncounts for section 922(g)(1). The reason that the -- the\nconvictions are covered here is Congress was not --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Which was it? Just -- what\nwas the case you just mentioned?\nMS. MILLETT: Lewis v. United States, and that\nis -- that's really our favorite case, although we like\nthe word of -- definition Gonzales has for any. But in\nLewis v. United States, this Court addressed the question\nwhether the ban on possession of firearms by someone\nconvicted of, I'll say, a felony, a term of imprisonment\nof more than 1 year, applies to -- to convictions that are\nallegedly unconstitutional under State law or may, in\nfact, be unconstitutionally entered. They could have been\nthe product of a coerced confession. The allegation there\nwas lack of representation of counsel.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that -- that example,\nwhich you gave in your brief, gave me this concern. The\nproblem that you've just been describing, the State\nconvictions that may be invalid but is being used under\n922, I regard that as a kind of a venue question because\nyou can go back to the State that rendered the conviction\nand say, State, I was convicted in violation of the\nConstitution, give me my good habeas writ that I get --\ncan get from the State. Then I wipe out that conviction\nand I don't have it anymore.\nBut the person who's been convicted, say, in\nwhatever examples -- take -- Zimbabwe would be another\nexample. Libya. To go back to that system and get a\nconviction expunged. That's why you can't use a case\nwithin the U.S. system where it's a question of where do\nyou go to wipe out your prior conviction. And for someone\nabroad, there isn't that option.\nMS. MILLETT: Justice Ginsburg, in Daniels v.\nUnited States, which dealt with 924, the sentencing\nenhancement provision, but it has a -- the parallel and\nincorporates 922(g)(1) convictions, this Court held -- a\nplurality of this Court held in divided opinions that -- in\nfact, that the -- the bar -- or that you still count an\nunconstitutional or allegedly unconstitutional State\nconviction, even if it was never appealed and that -- and\nthere is no more opportunity for appeal. The time has\npassed. And under 922(g)(1), we also count.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's -- that's a\nquestion of waiver or forfeiture. Those are the ordinary\nrules that apply.\nMS. MILLETT: Yes, but that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- but there's a basic\nrule in civil as well as criminal procedure, that if you\nwant to attack a judgment, you go where that judgment was\nrendered. And of course, you should abide by the timing\nrules of that, but that's just a very sensible thing\nwithin a federal union. If you're -- if you're attacking\nwhat State A does, go to State A, don't tell State C.\nMS. MILLETT: And --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that -- that doesn't\noperate internationally.\nMS. MILLETT: Well, it does certainly in this\ncase. He could have appealed his conviction in Japan and\nhe did not. So he had a forum to do that in. But --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but you're not building\nthat into your interpretation of the statute at all\nbecause you have said in your brief -- and correct me if\nI've got you wrong -- you don't like what the Third\nCircuit did. You say just the fact of the conviction\ncounts. Don't investigate, court, whether it was a fair\nsystem that comports with fundamental notions of due\nprocess. Just see if there's a conviction anyplace in the\nworld. And so what -- what you're telling me is that it\ndoesn't matter that you didn't appeal because even if he\nwere precluded from appealing for some reason that we\nwould consider totally unfair, it doesn't matter on your\nview of this statute.\nMS. MILLETT: That -- that's right, Justice\nGinsburg, and that is -- you know, the -- the statute also\nbars receipt of firearms by anyone who's under indictment.\nAnd that application applies even though you can't appeal,\nexcept for exceptional circumstances. You can't appeal an\nindictment. And the 922(g)(1) bar, this Court's decision\nin Lewis made clear, is that it still applies unless and\nuntil your conviction is overturned. So you don't have to\nhave had a -- a conviction vetted through the appellate\nprocess before the bar attaches.\nIn -- in the immigration context --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's -- that's standard\nfor judgments anyway. When the judgment is final, it\nmeans you've gotten through the first -- it has preclusive\neffect. Almost always, when a judgment is overturned on\nappeal, then you go back to State 2 and say, look, it's\nbeen overturned on appeal, and at least in the civil side,\nalmost always State 2 will say, okay, we'll give you post-\njudgment relief because what we were relying on as our\nsister State judgment is no longer on the books. I can't\nimagine that in our criminal system it doesn't work the\nsame way.\nMS. MILLETT: Well, certainly in immigration and\nextradition, you don't get to appeal the validity of your\nforeign conviction or the -- the processes that led to it.\nSo this is not an alien concept.\nAnd it's very important to understand what\nCongress was doing here. This isn't --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm asking if it's alien in\nour criminal justice system, not in deportation, not in --\nextradition is somebody who did somebody -- something\nabroad, and we don't send people just to anyplace. Don't\nwe have to have a treaty?\nMS. MILLETT: Right. We have treaties with more\nthan 100 countries and we don't -- and -- and the courts\ndo not examine the fairness of the proceedings or --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Because the person is going\nto be tried in that other system, and we have bound --\nwithin our international system, we say we're part of a\nworld community and we want Japan to extradite people who\nhave done bad things here to the United States, and so\nsimilarly, we will extradite to Japan. We don't want them\nto look at our system and judge it. We're sending\nsomebody to be tried there. So extradition is -- is\nsomething entirely different than --\nMS. MILLETT: Although we -- we do also\nextradite, just to serve sentences, where there may have\nalready been a trial that could be as flawed as anyone\ncould conceive or articulate. So --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, we have the check\nalready that these are -- these are places with whom we want\nto do criminal justice business together. So --\nMS. MILLETT: Well, what we have is the check\nthat the political branches have decided that it's\nimportant to attach significance to foreign court --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And then we have the -- we\nhave the document where it's very clear we want to have\nextradition with the UK, with Japan. Here, you're relying\non the word court, and you don't have it all spelled out\nlike you do in an extradition treaty. And that's the\nproblem here. Sure, if Congress had said we mean foreign\ncourt, then that would be it, but it hasn't said that and\nwe have to determine does it mean the same thing as it\nmeans in the extradition context or the deportation\ncontext where you have a clear statement that Congress\nmeans a tribunal abroad.\nMS. MILLETT: In fact, in 8 U.S.C. 1182(a) which\n-- which -- admissibility criterion for aliens,\nconvictions of moral turpitude, there's no reference to\nwhether it's a conviction by a foreign court or a domestic\ncourt.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if somebody is coming\ninto the country, somebody is asking to come in, any\nconviction that you're talking about, of course, refers to\nsomeplace abroad.\nMS. MILLETT: No. No, it doesn't, Justice\nGinsburg, because frequently and throughout that same\nstatute, it refers to convictions in the United States. A\nlot of times the reason for inadmissibility, including the\nMariel Cubans cases this Court heard last month, is -- is\nconvictions committed in the United States.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May -- may I interrupt this --\nMS. MILLETT: Now, surely the context --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- this colloquy to raise\nanother question, if I may? Would you concede that there\nare some tribunals in the world that are comparable to\nwhat you might call a kangaroo court that Congress would\nnot have intended to include within the term court?\nMS. MILLETT: Yes, Justice Stevens. And I think\nthat's an important thing here. There has been no\ncontest, for obvious reasons -- we're dealing with Japan\n-- as to what Congress meant by court. And sometimes if\nit's Saddam Hussein's --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And how are we to decide\nwhether such tribunal should be treated as a court within\nthe meaning of the statute when there is no statutory\ndefinition of the term court?\nMS. MILLETT: Through traditional rules of\nstatutory construction. I think that would involve\nlooking at the other -- the -- the background that\nCongress would have enacted the statute against, first of\nall, and that -- that may well have -- it may not have\nbeen courts of just the United States because, as we know,\nCongress twice deleted that limitation from the statute.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But if you concede that there\nare some tribunals that are not courts within the meaning\nof the statute, are you not conceding that the word court\nis inherently ambiguous?\nMS. MILLETT: I -- I am -- I am conceding that\n-- that it has to be given meaning. I don't know that I\nwould call it ambiguous, if we have to figure out. But I\n-- what I will say is that the phrase --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it's something less than\nthe all-inclusive term, any court, in a literal sense.\nMS. MILLETT: Any -- it has to be -- it has to\nbe a court capable of entering convictions. I don't -- I\ndon't think it's ambiguous in a sense --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I mean, it doesn't --\nit's -- it's not a tennis court or an inner court.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. MILLETT: Right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If -- if somebody asked where\nthis man was convicted, they'd say in a Japanese court.\nMS. MILLETT: Right. And -- and I think, in\naddition, we don't decide that a word is ambiguous just at\nlooking at that word. We would look at the overall\nstructure of the statute, and we would decide that it has\nto be a governmental entity capable of entering\nconvictions.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You didn't really have a\nchance --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I assume that there's some\nprosecutorial discretion in the application of this\nstatute. I mean, have you --\nMS. MILLETT: Absolutely, Justice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- have you prosecuted any --\nany woman who tried to buy a firearm because she had been\nconvicted of wearing -- not -- not wearing a veil?\nMS. MILLETT: No, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think any United States\nattorney would do that?\nMS. MILLETT: I would hope not, Justice Scalia.\nI think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or -- or somebody who was\nconvicted of treason in Cuba? You -- you think that --\nthat that would be a -- a case that would be prosecuted\nvigorously by a United States attorney?\nMS. MILLETT: I -- I wouldn't think so. I\nthink --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you know any cases in which\nwe've construed a statute narrowly on the ground that\nwe're confident the prosecutor won't bring any such cases?\nMS. MILLETT: That -- well, again, just last --\nthis isn't -- this isn't quite the same context. But just\nthis -- just last term in the Cheney case, this Court\nrecognized the limitations on prosecutors.\nAnd in Atwater v. City of Lago Vista, in\ndetermining the scope of the Fourth Amendment and the\ncapacity to arrest for misdemeanors, this Court recognized\nthat not all checks have to come from the courts. They\ncan come from the political process here.\nAnd it's very important to keep in mind that\nthese hypothesized problems, bad applications, are that.\nPurely hypothesized. This has been on the books for\nalmost 40 years.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it's -- it's been on the\nbooks for so long with very, very few prosecutions. So\nit's one -- it's not exactly an urgent question. But it\ndoes seem to me if this -- this problem had been brought\nto the attention of Congress, they would have defined the\nterm court, and I don't -- they haven't done that but\nprobably because they didn't think of the problem. And\nyou can argue, well, they surely would have wanted to have\nthis particular person prosecuted, but would they have\nwanted everyone with every foreign court all over the\nworld. That's the question.\nMS. MILLETT: And in Beecham v. United States,\nin Justice O'Connor's opinion for the Court, this Court\nrecognized there -- it was dealing with another issue,\nwhether the jurisdiction that restores civil rights is\ndifferent from the convicting jurisdiction. It said we\ndon't have any way of knowing whether Congress thought\nabout that. That's not the question.\nCongress passed a statute here. It passed a\nstatute that's been written very carefully. It's passed a\nstatute where the definition of the word any in the\nstatute has already been defined. And the -- what the\nstatute has been used for is to prosecute exactly the\npeople that Congress wanted to capture. It's\ninternational gun smugglers --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. --\nMS. MILLETT: -- violent assailants --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, Ms. -- Ms. Millett, my --\nmy problem with that argument and I guess my basic problem\nwith -- with the case is Congress did not just sort of\nstop when it got to the point that would support your\nLewis argument. It went a step -- it went several steps\nfurther. But one of the steps further that it went to was\n-- was in -- in a certain fussiness about the definition\nof crime, and it said, well, we want to make sure that --\nthat no State or -- or Federal business criminals are --\nare put at a disadvantage by this. It then accepted\nanything that a State might call a misdemeanor if it\ncarried no more than 2 years. And it just seems very odd\nto me that Congress would have been that careful in\nputting these limitations on State and Federal crimes and\nwould totally have ignored any category of crime under\nforeign law, any conviction under foreign law in -- in\nlight of some of the hypotheses that have been thrown out\nthis morning. It just seems strange that it would have\nignored foreign law and foreign courts if it thought they\nwere included.\nMS. MILLETT: I don't think it's strange at all,\nJustice Souter, and that is because that the business\nexception, if I can call it that, is a carve-out. What\nyou have here, in this Court's word, is a sweeping\nprophylaxis against the misuse of firearms. That's what\nthis Court called it in Lewis, a sweeping prophylaxis.\nAnd what Congress did was back out --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it called it that, but it\ndidn't -- it didn't have this issue in front of it.\nMS. MILLETT: That's -- that's right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I realize you've got the\nlanguage, but it -- it wasn't addressing this issue.\nMS. MILLETT: Right, and -- and the language\nshould be what counts most. But beyond that, you're\ntalking about Congress --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I was talking about our\nlanguage.\nMS. MILLETT: Right. You --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But -- and I think that ought\nto count for a lot too.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, not too much.\nMS. MILLETT: But what Congress was doing there\nwas backing out. It was making an exception, and it was\ndoing this against a backdrop of a lot of violence with\nguns. And so it makes sense that Congress would proceed\ncarefully and deal with matters with which it was familiar\nand not want to carve out things that it wasn't familiar\nwith.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but how -- how familiar an\nexample is it that price-fixers would -- would be placed\nin -- in a terrible position if they couldn't carry guns?\nI mean, that was not a pressing problem, so far as I know.\nAnd yet, Congress dealt with it.\nMS. MILLETT: Well, the problem --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And if it can deal with a\nproblem that is as little pressing as that, it seems odd\nthat it would not have averted in any way to equally non-\npressing problems under -- under foreign convictions if\nthat's what they had in mind.\nMS. MILLETT: It dealt with that. I mean,\nspecifically at the legislative history level, it dealt --\nit enacted that statutory exception because some States\nhad made these types of business crimes punishable by more\nthan a year. So that's what it was responding to.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. What -- what --\nMS. MILLETT: I can't -- I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. I -- finish your answer.\nMS. MILLETT: I can't -- I'm not going to stand\nhere and tell you that Congress specifically thought about\nthis.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, there's no --\nMS. MILLETT: Right, but --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We both know there's no --\nMS. MILLETT: But -- but what Congress did here\n-- and it's very important to understand -- it was\nthrowing a broad net --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Millett.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Millett, there are many\nlawyers in Congress and at least the law students of my\ngeneration -- some of them are of that elder age. We\nlearned in law school one country doesn't enforce the\npenal judgments of another. This is a kind of enforcement\nof a penal judgment of another, not exactly, but something\nlike it. Another reason why I would expect a Congress,\nknowing that background norm, would say, when it meant\nforeign, foreign. Unlike the context of the immigration,\nyes, there are some people who left and came back, but\nmany -- and -- and we have all this whole line of cases.\nIs adultery a crime of moral turpitude, and you know,\nthose go back to the '20's.\nBut this, which came about only because of the\nmerger of two statutes, one saying Federal and State, the\nother not, and no explanation at all, in light of all\nthese anomalies that have been brought out. Shouldn't we\nsay to Congress maybe that's what you meant, but if you\ndid, you have an opportunity to say so before we read in\nforeign?\nMS. MILLETT: Two answers, Justice Ginsburg.\nFirst, this was the second time in 1986 that Congress\nrefused to include that limitation on courts. The prior\nlaw, before the 1968 act, specifically referred to courts\nof the United States, States, and territories. It did not\npick up that language in title IV in 1968, and they took\nit out --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But neither did it give any\nexplanation for not carrying it forward.\nMS. MILLETT: No, but I don't -- that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It's -- it's the silence at the\n-- at the time it -- it apparently departed from the\npractice of predecessor statutes that -- that seems to be\na problem for your argument.\nMS. MILLETT: But -- but again, I don't think\nthis Court has ever characterized as silence Congress'\ntwice deletion of language from a statute in 1968 and\nagain in 1986. It had it. It looked at it. It took it\nout. And in 1986 in the Senate report that you were\nreferring to, Justice Ginsburg, earlier, Congress said\nthey -- the conference report said we are rejecting the\nSenate's definition of felony.\nThe other thing to keep in mind is when Congress\nenacted this statute in 1968, it also enacted an\nadministrative mechanism for relief that would deal with\nexactly the uncomfortable situations that have been\nidentified. 925(c) allows an administrative waiver in\ncases where an individual comes and says I don't want\nto --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You know, this is a very\ninteresting case because there are three ways to answer\nthe question of what is a court. You can leave it up to\nus to do it, and that would be judicial legislation to\nfill in a hole in the statute. You can have the executive\ndo it, decide what case -- what cases to prosecute, or if\nwe should knock out this -- interpret the statute in the\n-- in a different way than you urge, Congress would then\ndo it. Now, which of the three is the better lawmaker on\ndeciding which is the -- what should the meaning of the\nword court be? The executive, the legislature, or the\njudiciary?\nMS. MILLETT: I think -- it's, of course, the\nlegislature and the President's signature. I'd like to\nput a plug in for the executive in -- in that reference,\nbut --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That would save us a lot of\nwork. We --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- we could just invalidate\nall statutes that we don't understand.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. MILLETT: But, Justice Kennedy and Justice\nStevens, the important thing to keep in mind here is we\ndon't just have a statute that appeared out of nowhere.\nIt's been on the books for a long time and there was a\nlegislative --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but it is pretty clear\nthat Congress didn't really think about this problem.\nMS. MILLETT: No, but it thought -- it --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And it is also clear on your\nside that they would like to prevent this guy from having\na gun.\nMS. MILLETT: Exactly, and --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So there are two competing\nconsiderations, both of which are very powerful.\nMS. MILLETT: Well, if nothing else -- and this\nguy is squarely within what Congress wanted to capture.\nIf nothing else, you don't have to decide anything more in\nthis case than that it covers persons like this whose\nconvictions are fundamentally fair and it's not contested\nand could leave for another day -- but let's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can I -- I want to get you.\nNow, I have a new question.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would -- would you finish --\nwould you finish please --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I have a new --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- telling us about the\nadministrative waiver proceeding? You were in the middle\nof it and I never heard the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's exactly what I wanted to\nknow.\nMS. MILLETT: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I -- can I -- that's\nexactly what I wanted to know. When a person comes in to\nget a gun -- because I hadn't focused on this, and it\nactually to me it's relevant. Suppose one of these people\nhas been convicted in a foreign court and he doesn't have\na clue, you know, that this means he can't buy a gun over\nhere. So he comes over here. He goes into a -- a gun\nstore. Now, does he get notice that that -- this\nconviction over in Japan or Lithuania or wherever it was\nmeans that he can't buy the gun?\nMS. MILLETT: Well, he got -- in this case, he\ngot -- and this is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. I'm asking -- I'm asking\nin general.\nMS. MILLETT: You -- you go and you fill out a\nform that says, as this case did -- and it's on page 4 of\nour brief --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMS. MILLETT: -- asked him, have you been\nconvicted in any court of --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So it just says any court.\nMS. MILLETT: In any court. And I think when\nsomeone --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well --\nMS. MILLETT: No. But when someone has a\nconviction, when you have a felony conviction, you're on\nsome notice of inquiry.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It'll work for -- yes. It'll\n-- it'll work for this one, but -- but what I'm worried\nabout -- and really what led the Sentencing Commission to\nexclude all this stuff even though clearly recidivists\nshould get a higher sentence, but we still excluded it\nbecause it's just a nightmare. There are notice problems.\nThere are fairness problems. There are procedural\nproblems. There are problems of crimes that aren't crimes\nhere.\nMS. MILLETT: Justice --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And -- and all those come up,\nand that's what I'm worried about. So I see this as a\npossible out.\nMS. MILLETT: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The one -- the procedure you\njust talked about might help.\nMS. MILLETT: And it's in 925(c), which is on --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That he knows about it.\nMS. MILLETT: -- page 65a of our brief. But let\nme -- let me be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And it provides judicial review\nof the Attorney General's failure to give the waiver.\nMS. MILLETT: It does, and -- but let me be\ncandid up front. Congress stopped funding this\nadministrative mechanism in 1992, and that -- this Court\naddressed that in the Bean case. It -- it doesn't exist\nnow, but that was 25 years after Congress wrote this\nlanguage and put it in the statute, and the fact that they\nstopped funding it 25 years later doesn't mean the statute\ndoesn't mean what it said.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know why?\nMS. MILLETT: And Congress --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know why they stopped\nfunding it? Why did -- because I think that's been\nreenacted every year. No money for this. Why -- why did\nCongress stop funding it?\nMS. MILLETT: Because some of -- some of the\npeople who were getting waivers were going out and\ncommitting crimes again. Congress here is very concerned\nabout public safety.\nAnd this is not -- there was, you know, the\nquestion, is there ever an element where you treat this\nlike an element of foreign crime. There aren't -- there\naren't crimes normally where you treat indictments or\nsomeone being under a restraining order this way. This is\nnot punishing you for your foreign crime. This is a\nglobal categorical, class-wide judgment that as a class\npersons who have committed crimes overseas are more\ndangerous and may pose exactly the public safety risk we\nwanted to grab and stop. As a class, they do that. In a\nparticular case, it may not. In a particular case, an\nindictment might not. Congress was speaking globally. It\ndid so. It threw a broad net. It did so at the time it\nhad an administrative check to deal with these problems.\nYes, that's gone. That doesn't retroactively change what\nthe statutory language meant.\nThis Court has said time and time again that\nthis statutory language in 922 was written, in Beecham and\nHuddleston, with such care that Congress was focused on\nthe difference between the present perfect and the past\ntense, this Court said in Barrett. This is not sloppy\nwriting. When Congress put any court in and did not carry\nforward a limitation to the courts of the United States\nand took that out in another part of the statute in 1986,\nwe have to assume that Congress knew what it was doing.\nIf there are problems here, there is a\npolitical process to deal with it. The political process\nhas taken away the administrative waiver. But there has\nnot been -- this hypothesis of bad applications has not\narisen. It's hypothesized. And what this statute has --\nhas been used to do is capture exactly the people Congress\nwanted to capture. It got exactly the ones who should be\ndisarmed.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you know anybody in the\nJustice Department you might talk to to amend this form so\nthat the form says this includes convictions in foreign\ncountries?\nMS. MILLETT: I -- I am confident that the ATF\nwould be happy to do that. As of now, the ATF has a\nregulation on the books for someone to look at and see\nthat includes foreign convictions in this definition. And\nI think when someone has been convicted, they're on\nnotice.\nThank you, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you.\n"
