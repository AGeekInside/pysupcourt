        "content": "(11:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument next\nin Carey versus Musladin. Mr. Ott.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY A. OTT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. OTT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the\nCourt:\nThis Court has never addressed the\nconstitutionality of photo buttons worn by spectators\nduring a criminal trial. The two closest decisions of\nthis Court, Estelle v. Williams and Holbrook v. Flynn\nestablished only a general rule that some courtroom\npractices may be so inherently prejudicial that they\nviolate the defendant's right to a fair trial. Neither\nFlynn nor Williams --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it went a little bit beyond\nthat. I mean, the -- Justice Marshall announced not\nmerely the possibility of inherent prejudice, but he\nspoke in terms of practices that raised a risk that\nimproper factors would come into play in the jury\ndecision. Isn't that the criterion?\nMR. OTT: An unacceptable risk, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's the criterion.\nMR. OTT: Well, the test has been formulated\ndifferent ways --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's the way he formulated it.\nThat's the way the Court in Flynn formulated it.\nMR. OTT: In Flynn, it did, but it also, just a\nparagraph or so earlier said that the only question we\nneed to answer is whether this practice, and there the\ncourtroom uniformed guards, is so inherently prejudicial\nthat it violates the defendant's right to a fair trial.\nWe don't believe that those are material --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That was the end point that they\nwere reaching, and then he elaborated on that by\nreferring to the unacceptable risk that improper\nconsiderations would come into play. And it seems to me\nthat if you're going to talk about the criterion of the\ntest or the standard, however you want to describe it in\nFlynn, you've got to get that latter point about\nunacceptable risk of improper factors.\nMR. OTT: That certainly was a formulation of the\ntest. It's been -- we can accept it as the formulation\nof the test. And it was accepted by the California\ncourts below. They attempted to apply that test. They\nannounced the proper -- the correct clearly established\nlaw of this Court, and then proceeded to analyze the\nissue.\nBelow, however, on Federal habeas review, the\ncircuit court of appeals used its own circuit case to\ndefine clearly established law under AEDPA. Instead of\nassessing the state court's application of the general\nrule, the circuit court narrowed this Court's general\nrule into one that specifically condemned buttons.\nInstead of granting the state court wide leeway to\napply this Court's general rule, it -- the circuit court\ncreated a narrow rule that would seemingly prohibit\nbuttons in any case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I suppose if the court of\nappeals had case A, and it said, we interpret the Supreme\nCourt rule to be as follows, it could then later say in\ncase B, this is how we've interpreted the Supreme Court\nrule, and we're bound by case A. This is the elaboration\nwe've given to it. And we have to find that the state\ncourt, of course, isn't bound by what we do, but we're\nbound by what we do when we review what the state court\nhas decided.\nMR. OTT: Well, Your Honor makes a distinction\nbetween a post-AEDPA case and pre-AEDPA cases. In a\npost-AEDPA setting, it is -- the circuit court of appeals\nis looking at its own post-AEDPA case -- post A-E-D-P-A,\nAEDPA case which has said that this set of facts\nconstitutes an unreasonable application of clearly\nestablished law.\nWe don't disagree that stare decisis might come\ninto play there. It doesn't mean that that first\ndecision was correct, but we don't -- what happened here\nin contrast was a pre-AEDPA decision that was used to\ndefine the clearly established law of this Court, give it\nmore detail such that the circumstances here fell outside\nof it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: To apply an opinion of this Court\nto particular circumstances, and find that in the view of\nthe court of appeals, it produces a certain result is not\nnecessarily to say that that is clearly established\nSupreme Court law. It just means that it is their best\nguess as to how it comes out, right?\nMR. OTT: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, they're forced to decide\nit one way or the other, the Supreme Court opinion either\nmeans this or that. They're not applying a clearly\nestablished test to the Supreme Court, are they?\nMR. OTT: Not by doing that. However, the circuit\ncourt of appeals here expressly stated it was looking to\nits own circuit authority to define the law that is\nclearly established. It specifically stated that this\ncase, that the state's decision was unreasonable in light\nof Norris. It specifically stated that the state court's\ndecision could not reasonably be distinguished from\nNorris.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We're looking under AEDPA\nat an unreasonable application of Supreme Court law.\nWhat do you do in a situation where you think the state\ncourt has incorrectly articulated Supreme Court law, but\nnonetheless reached the correct result? In other words,\ncorrect understanding of the established Supreme Court\nlaw would have led to the same result as their incorrect\narticulation of it.\nMR. OTT: Mr. Chief Justice, at first, the -- the\nfirst thing to do would be to look at the fair import, as\nthis Court stated in Wilford v. Biscotti. Look at the\nfair import of the decision.\nNow, I don't know if you are referring to the\nissue about the arguable misarticulation of the text at\nthe end of the state court's decision here, but the first\nquestion is to look at the fair import. And if the fair\nimport is that the correct test was applied, then habeas\nrelief does not lie.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. My hypothetical,\nand we'll debate later whether it is this case or not, is\nlet's say that the state court wrongly articulates\nSupreme Court law. But under the correct articulation,\nit leads to the same result. What happens in that case\nunder AEDPA?\nMR. OTT: I believe that the habeas relief should\nnot lie. Now, I have seen circuit courts treat it\ndifferent ways. Some courts will decline to give\ndeference and review it de novo, but I don't think\nCongress intended, in enacting AEDPA, the A-E-D-P-A, that\na state habeas -- a state conviction should be overturned\nsimply because of an accident in a statement or\nformulation of the test, but the conviction is otherwise\nconstitutionally balanced --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You are actually saying the\nanswer to the Chief Justice's question is that you would\nthen review it de novo. But on de novo review, you would\nsustain the conviction if it came to the right result.\nMR. OTT: Yes. I believe so. If I understood you\ncorrectly -- the question correctly, yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You would not affirm -- you\nwould not sustain the conviction relying on AEDPA. You\nwould say AEDPA authorizes review, but on review, we\nconclude the conviction was correct. That's what I\nunderstand the AEDPA to be.\nMR. OTT: Yes, with the caveat that we're assuming\nthat the hypothetical is that the state court has\nmisapplied, that the fair import has -- they have\nmisapplied the holdings of this Court.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It misarticulated them. I\nguess the question of application is -- I mean, I assumed\nthey reached what we would regard as the correct result\nunder the correct standard, they just articulated the\nwrong standard.\nYour answer, I take it, is that it would then be\nreviewed without AEDPA deference?\nMR. OTT: No, Your Honor. Then I misunderstood\nthe question. The deference would still apply if you\ncould look at the decision as a whole and see that the\ncorrect standard was applied. If they have erroneously\nstated the standard -- if the state court erroneously\nstated the standard, but you can look to the decision as\na whole, and see that the correct standard was\nnevertheless applied, deference is still due.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: We're concerned here with the\ncourt of -- the role, if any, that a circuit court, that\nopinions of courts other than this Court have in\ndetermining whether law is clearly established.\nDo you exclude entirely from the province of what\nis proper for the Federal court to consider any court of\nappeals, Federal court of appeals decisions?\nMR. OTT: Yes, we do, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So that the only thing -- your\nargument is the only thing that is proper to look to are\ndecisions of this Court, and that if you don't have a\ncase on all fours, as we have no buttons case, then\nthat's the end of it?\nMR. OTT: No, Your Honor. We -- our position is\nthat a Federal habeas court may not look at all to state\nor circuit authority on the question of what is clearly\nestablished, only the holdings of this Court, and what\nappears on their face.\nIf there's a general rule, such as here, the\nquestion moves to the reasonable application prong.\nAnd under that prong, because the rule is general, as\nthis Court stated in Yarborough versus Alvarado, the more\ngeneral the rule, the more leeway there is. Relief can\nstill lie under certain circumstances, but it's -- it\nmoves into a question of objective reasonableness of the\nstate court's decision.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose all of the -- suppose\nthere are five circuits. They're the only ones that\nlooked at the issue. And they all say, we think the\ngeneral rule of the Supreme Court is as follows, isn't\nthat entitled to some weight? You're not supposed to\ncite that when you go to the Sixth Circuit court or you\ngo to the state court?\nMR. OTT: If Your Honor is speaking only to the\nclearly established prong, my answer would be no. If a\ncircuit court says Jackson v. Virginia is clearly\nestablished law on the sufficiency of the evidence, we\nhave no dispute with that. But to redefine or shape this\nCourt's holdings beyond the face of those holdings, our\nposition is that cannot be done with state or circuit\nlaw.\nCircuit law and state law may be relevant to the\nquestion of reasonable application, but not on the first\nprong. If a Federal habeas court looks to circuit or\nstate authority on the first prong of 2254(d)(1), the\nreasonableness becomes a foregone conclusion. The\ntwo -- the two sections of the statute collapse into what\nis essentially de novo review, as what happened here.\nOnce, for instance, the habeas court here decided that\nits own circuit authority required -- or prohibited\nbuttons, reasonableness was a foregone conclusion, even\nthough it was addressed by the circuit.\nBut in further response to your question, Your\nHonor, our position is that on the reasonable application\nprong, a Federal habeas court may look to state and\ncircuit cases. They are of varying relevance, but they\nshould look to state and Federal circuit cases equally,\nbut not all those cases have the same relevance. We have\n-- there is a distinction between pre-AEDPA and\npost-AEDPA cases, and the distinction between whether\nthose cases support or contradict the state court's\nopinion.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So would there be any\ndifference if this had been a post-AEDPA -- if the\ncircuit precedent had been post-AEDPA.\nMR. OTT: There would be a difference, Your Honor.\nThe -- depending on the prong we're looking at, under --\nour argument would still be the same under -- on the\nclearly established prong of 2254(d)(1), that even if\nNorris was a post-AEDPA case, that the circuit court\ncould not look to Norris to define this Court's holdings.\nBut Norris, if it were a post-AEDPA case would\nhave more relevance on the reasonable application prong.\nThere, stare decisis might come into play. It doesn't\nmean Norris is correct. It doesn't mean that the result\nreached by the circuit court of appeals in this case\nwould be correct, but it would certainly be more\nrelevant.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell us -- let's assume\nfor a minute that this case were on direct review, that\nwe don't have AEDPA. What is the standard that should\ncontrol? Whether there is an impermissible -- an\nunacceptable risk that impermissible factors will be\ntaken into account by the jury? Is that the test?\nMR. OTT: That is a test, the test, one of the\nformulations of it. I don't believe it materially\ndiffers from -- our position is it doesn't materially\ndiffer from the general due process, fair trial standard\nthat applies in all cases.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but you should make it\nmore specific for us. You say general due process. How\ndoes that work in this case? I want to know whether or\nnot I can order or must order someone to remove a sign, a\nbutton, a piece of clothing. What's the test that I use?\nMR. OTT: Your Honor, it is an assessment of all\nthe circumstances, that if you're a trial judge --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That -- unless you want to go\non, that doesn't help me. We just tell all the judges in\nthe country to assess all the circumstances, we say no\nmore?\nMR. OTT: No, Your Honor. Let's take the\nimpermissible factor test. The state court judge should\nlook at the circumstances before him and determine\nwhether he believes that there is an unacceptable risk of\nimpermissible factors coming into play.\nWhether the practice at issue, whether it be\nbuttons or ribbons or what have you, is so likely to\nprejudice this defendant or violate or infringe on his\nfundamental rights that we need to order them removed.\nNot just as a matter of supervisory power, but as a\nconstitutional requirement.\nSo it is a spectrum test, Your Honor. And it's\nessentially a totality test of the circumstances of the\nbuttons, let's say, and there can't be a bright line\nrule. The circumstances --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why couldn't there be here? I\nmean, at some point, at some point, seeing every judge in\nthis case say this is a thoroughly -- no, let me not\nexaggerate. But they say wearing buttons is a bad idea.\nFor obvious reasons.\nNow, at some point, if enough judges say that,\neach time they say, well, it is a bad idea, but we can't\nsay in this case that it was so prejudicial, there's that\ninherent risk that it's unconstitutional. But if some\npoint, if people begin enough is enough to say, this is\nquite a bad idea to have buttons being worn in a\ncourtroom, which is not a place for demonstration, does\nit not become pretty clear, irrespective of exactly what\nopinions say what, that this is just very unfair and\nunconstitutional?\nMR. OTT: Your Honor, my answer is no. As a\nsupervisory matter, a state court can do whatever it\nwishes. Under the state constitution, state statutes,\nstate rules of court, can do many things under its\nsupervisory power or even state constitutional power.\nThat is different altogether, however, from saying\nthat all buttons violate the Constitution, which is\ndifferent in turn from saying all buttons require habeas\nrelief.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What about banners? What would\nyou do with banners?\nMR. OTT: I beg your pardon?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What would you do with banners?\nWould it make sense to say all banners are banned from\nthe courtroom? I thought you would think that would make\na lot of sense.\nMR. OTT: Banners?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. Signs, placards.\nMR. OTT: Your Honor, I haven't seen a case\ninvolving banners. I imagine that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I think I know why. Because it\naffects the atmospherics of the trial.\nMR. OTT: And likewise, we don't see all the\nbutton cases where the buttons have been precluded.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you also don't allow people\nto come into most courtrooms in tank shirts, and we don't\nallow people to, you know, to wear beany hats.\nEverything that is inappropriate for a courtroom is not\nnecessarily inappropriate because it would prejudice the\ntrial; isn't that right?\nMR. OTT: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe that's why we don't allow\nbanners, because a courtroom is not the place for\nbanners.\nMR. OTT: That's correct, Your Honor. Decorum\nshould not be confused with --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Absolutely right. Suppose you\nthink in this Federal court, which we are, that banners,\nposters, and buttons are a thoroughly bad idea.\nNow, why? Not just because of decorum. But\nbecause they introduce an extraneous factor into the\njudgment of the jury.\nAnd suppose I also think -- I'm not saying I do,\nI'm trying this out -- but it is pretty hard to draw\nlines among buttons. It is pretty hard to draw lines\namong banners. And the only way to guarantee fair trials\nin whole -- is to have a wholesale rule on this. No\nbuttons, no banners, no petitions, no posters.\nHow would you explain -- you just say the law\njust doesn't permit that.\nMR. OTT: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What do you want to say about\nthat? Because that is a concern I have.\nMR. OTT: I understand, Your Honor. And this\nCourt obviously has the power to enact a prophylactic\nrule that -- but a prophylactic rule covers many\nunconstitutional as well as constitutional practices.\nAnd that a prophylactic rule requires -- the prophylactic\nrule that might be enacted would require preclusion of\nbuttons does not mean that all the buttons that might\ncome up are necessarily prejudicial.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not so sure. You think that\nwe could just say we're going to exercise our best\njudgment, not necessarily amend the Constitution, just\nbecause it is a good idea, banners and buttons are hereby\nbanned forever? Do we have the authority to just say\nthat?\nMR. OTT: Well, Your Honor, in this case, this\ncase has -- this Court granted certiorari on the question\nof application of the AEDPA. So we are not asking --\ncertainly not asking for that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: We're exploring initially what\nthe rule ought to be.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question?\nSupposing we all thought that this practice in this\nparticular case deprived the defendant of a fair trial,\nbut we also agreed with you that AEDPA prevents us from\nannouncing such a judgment. What if we wrote an opinion\nsaying it is perfectly clear there was a constitutional\nviolation here, but Congress has taken away our power to\nreverse it.\nThen a year from now, the same case arises. Could\nwe follow -- could the district court follow our dicta or\ncould it -- would it be constrained to say we don't know\nwhat the Supreme Court might do?\nMR. OTT: It could not follow this Court's dicta\nunder this Court's statement in Williams v. Taylor that\nonly the holdings, not the dicta, of this Court establish\nclearly -- clearly establish Supreme Court authority.\nI believe that the rule, if there's going to be\none, should be the rule that was applied here. A general\nrule of fundamental fairness considering the totality of\nthe circumstances before the trial court. I think the\nrule works. And it worked in this case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't need to\nestablish that rule, do you? You just need to establish\nthat what the Supreme Court determined was not an\nunreasonable application of this Court's law?\nMR. OTT: That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.\nWe're not asking for a new rule applicable to buttons.\nThe reason we're here is because of the circuit court's\nmethod in addressing this case and granting habeas\nrelief.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What if the button had said --\nthe three buttons had said \"Hang Musladin,\" would you say\nthat there was not -- there was not sufficiently clear\nlaw from this Court to find that practice\nunconstitutional under Justice Marshall's formulation.\nMR. OTT: Your Honor, it wouldn't change the\nclearly established prong. We still have the general\nrule, but I think that your instance is one that all\njudges would agree is so egregious that it falls within\nthe ambit of that, and would require habeas relief.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Falls within the ambit of what?\nOf a mob-dominated atmosphere or -- your answer to\nJustice Souter was AEDPA would -- was that this would\nrequire reversal even under AEDPA; is that your answer?\nMR. OTT: I can concede that, yes, Your Honor,\nthat --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We both want to know why you say\nthat.\nMR. OTT: Well, the question is objective\nreasonableness. And we don't dispute that some\ncircumstances may present such a situation that no one,\nno judge is going to disagree that the situation, at the\nstate court, if it denied the relief on the three buttons\nyou posed was unreasonable.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but what are the --\ngetting into the formulation, what are the impermissible\nfactors as to which a risk is raised by wearing the \"Hang\nMusladin\" button? What are those factors?\nMR. OTT: The \"Hang Musladin\" button, the\nimpermissible factor first is the explicit message.\n\"Hang Musladin.\" \"Convict him.\" It's urging the jury to\nconvict him and that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what's wrong with that?\nThe prosecutor is going to get up and urge the jury to\nconvict him. What is wrong with it on the button? What\nrisk does the button raise that the prosecutor's argument\ndoes not? That's what we're getting at.\nMR. OTT: It is an outside influence, Your Honor.\nIt is an influence coming from --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How different is it from\nthe victim's family sitting in the second row behind the\nprosecution every day of the trial? And I mean, I'm --\nthe hypothetical correctly focuses on the question, at\nleast for me, of whether or not you can have specific\napplications of general rules that are clearly\nestablished. I'm just not sure your agreement with it is\nadvisable because it seems to me that simply having --\nhow many people have to wear these buttons? One person\nshows up with a \"Hang Musladin\" button, does that mean it\nis a mob-dominated trial?\nMR. OTT: No, Your Honor. My -- what I -- the\npoint I meant to make was that we're not urging that\nrelief can never lie because there's a general rule of\napplication.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right.\nMR. OTT: It's a spectrum. And I would -- I'm not\nconceding that the example necessarily requires habeas\nrelief, because there are a whole host of circumstances\nthat we wouldn't know about it, for instance, whether it\nwas ever seen, in cases that people don't see the button,\nor what have you.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What about simply the facts that\nwe have in this case, which I thought I was doing, maybe\nI wasn't clear about it, but the button is different.\nInstead of putting a picture of the victim, it's got the\nstatement, \"Hang Musladin.\" It's worn every day by three\nmembers of his family who sit behind the prosecution\ntable within the sight of the jury. Assume those facts.\nWould habeas relief be required under the\ngeneral rule?\nMR. OTT: I don't think it would be required. I\nthink it would be reasonable to say that habeas relief\nmust lie. There are many -- there are much fewer\ninferences that could be drawn there.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is that a way of saying that it's\nrequired? Should -- look, should a court grant habeas\nrelief on my facts?\nMR. OTT: Not necessarily, Your Honor. It --\nthere are --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why?\nMR. OTT: Well, as Mr. Chief Justice pointed out,\nthree family members of the victim sitting in the front\nrow, buttons or not, the buttons don't add -- add little,\nif anything, to the three victim's family members sitting\nthere grieving through a trial. They add very little,\nfor instance, in this case --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I don't know whether they are\ngrieving or not, but I certainly know the sentiment that\nthey are trying to convey to the jury if they wear a\nbutton that says \"Hang Musladin.\"\nMR. OTT: Your Honor, I submit that the sentiment\nis obvious to the jury.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Pardon?\nMR. OTT: I would submit that that sentiment is\nobvious to the jury, that a juror --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: They may not want him hung. They\nmay not believe in the death penalty.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I wish you hadn't said that.\nBecause I had thought that one of the things that made\nthis case leaning in your direction is the fact that\nmerely having a picture of their loved one on the button\ndoesn't convey the message, you know, hang the defendant,\nor even convict the defendant. It just conveys, at most,\nto the jury, you know, this is -- we have been deprived\nof someone we love, you should take this matter very\nseriously and consider the case carefully. It is an\nimportant matter to us. And therefore, you ought to\ndeliberate carefully. I don't know that it means\nanything more than that.\nMR. OTT: Your Honor, I did not intend at all to\nsuggest that that was a message from those buttons. What\nI meant to say was the buttons add very little. Because\nI think a juror understands what a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You said, you know, convict\nwhat's -- or hang What's His Name. That's quite --\nyou're equating that with the buttons in this case. And\nI don't think the buttons in this case say hang so and\nso, or even convict so and so. They just say we have\nbeen deprived of a loved one. This is a terrible matter.\nPlease, jury, consider this case carefully. That's all\nit necessarily says.\nMR. OTT: That's, if any message, what the buttons\nconveyed in this case. I was only speaking to the\ndifference between the buttons that Justice Souter posed\nas putting forth a more explicit message.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, assuming that explicit\nmessage, could habeas relief be granted in my\nhypothetical case?\nMR. OTT: Not necessarily, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why?\nMR. OTT: Because in your case, I don't think that\nthat message necessarily -- I think it is reasonable for\na state court to conclude that those buttons did not add\nmuch to, if anything, to the presence of --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is it reasonable for a state\ncourt to say that three family members sitting in a\ncourtroom within sight of the jury for whatever number of\ndays the trial ran, saying at the guilt stage, hang so\nand so, is exposing the jury to a proper influence, that\nit should, and may consider in deciding guilt or\ninnocence?\nMR. OTT: Your Honor, we could concede that for\nthis case.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Why don't you concede that\nof course that would be exposing the jury to an improper\ninfluence, in the \"Hang Musladin\" case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought some states require\nthat the relatives of the victim be allowed to make their\ncase to the jury for harsh penalty. I don't know that\nthat's necessarily inappropriate to know that the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's at sentencing after\nconviction.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: My hypo is at the guilt stage,\nnot the sentencing stage.\nMR. OTT: At the guilt stage, that's right.\nCalifornia statutes do require that victims' families be\nable to make a statement at sentencing. They also\nrequire that the victim's family, if the victim is not\nalive, be present at the guilt phase of the trial, during\nthe guilt phase of the trial.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But at the guilt stage, is there\nany, is there any question in your mind that allowing the\nfamily members to display this message to a jury\nthroughout the trial at the guilt stage is raising a\nrisk, an unacceptable risk, that the jury will consider\nimproper influences in reaching its verdict?\nIs there any question?\nMR. OTT: Your Honor, your -- your buttons might\nraise an impermissible risk.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's my hypothetical. My\nbuttons, \"Hang Musladin,\" is there any question about the\nrisk of improper influence on my hypothetical? Not this\ncase, my hypothetical.\nMR. OTT: They do, but it might still be\nreasonable for a state court to conclude otherwise. And\nit was certainly reasonable for the state court here to\nconclude that three simple buttons bearing only a photo\ndid not convey any message of blame, guilt, anything\nother than grief of this family.\nIf I may reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Ott.\nMR. OTT: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Fermino?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. FERMINO\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. FERMINO: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the\nCourt:\nI want to direct this Court's attention to the\nstate court opinion which appears at 55A to 78A of the\nappendix to the petition for writ of certiorari in this\ncase. I want Your Honors to take a look at that opinion.\nIt is 25 pages in length, but the portion of the opinion\ndealing with the buttons issue is two pages in length.\nOf those two pages, all but a few sentences deal\ndirectly with the Norris case. I believe it is at\nroughly page 72A in their -- 73A of the appendix. All\nbut three sentences deal with the Norris case.\nThe Attorney General has said in its briefing that\nthe court below teased out the particular reference to\nthe buttons, that it carefully parsed the opinion, that\nit gave a tendentious analysis. This is the description\nof the Attorney General. Nothing could be further from\naccuracy.\nThese two pages discuss Norris head on. It is the\nelephant in the room, if you will. The court below could\nnot have -- it would have been impossible for the court\nbelow to write this opinion without addressing the Norris\ncase head on.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought the key sentence in\nthis is he says the simple photograph of Tom Studer on a\nbutton which -- I don't know what the size is. Nobody\nhas told them what the button is about. Nobody has put\nfor the judge a picture of it. Nobody showed him what\nthe button is. So he says a simple photograph of Tom\nStuder was unlikely to have been taken as anything other\nthan the normal grief occasioned by the loss of a family\nmember. Period. Now, what else is there to say? That's\nthe court's conclusion.\nAnd it is pretty hard for me -- I looked for the\nbutton. I couldn't even find the button in the record.\nI didn't even know what this looks like. It is a button,\nsomebody later must have said two inches to four inches.\nI don't know who said that. I don't know how the judge\ncould have known that. The button isn't in the record.\nSo why isn't it just a normal sign of grief unlikely to\ninfluence anybody? That's what they say.\nMR. FERMINO: Justice Breyer, I think that the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: In this case.\nMR. FERMINO: That's correct. And I think that\nthe court -- it is correct that the record before the\nstate court of appeals was inadequate to address -- to\nanswer the question. But I think what -- where the court\nerred is in adding and grafting on an additional element.\nIt goes beyond that sentence that, Justice Breyer, you\nfocused on. I think it is that the -- it is the element\nof branding. It's that this wearing of the buttons in a\nsense branded the defendant in the eyes of the jurors.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It goes on frequently in an\nopinion. I have been known to do that myself. And I say\nthis court over here says it's a da-da-da, and I say\n\"sure isn't that.\" Well, what is it?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And that language came from one\nof our opinions, didn't it? The branding language?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That was quoting Holbrook and\nFlynn.\nMR. FERMINO: That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.\nThat's right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So you can't fault the court\nfor just saying it isn't that. Mr. Ott says it isn't\nthat.\nMR. FERMINO: That's correct. But I believe that\nit is not part of the test. It was that the branding\nlanguage, as in Justice Brennan's -- in Justice Brennan's\ndissent was not part of the text articulated by --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Repeated later in opinions for\nthe majority, I think.\nMR. FERMINO: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In later cases, so I mean --\nMR. FERMINO: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Don't just put it in Brennan's\ndissent.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't understand your\npoint about the state court focusing on Norris. The\nquestion under AEDPA is still whether or not it is an\nunreasonable application of Supreme Court law.\nMR. FERMINO: Well, in this instance, much has\nbeen said about the opinion and the carefully written\nopinion of the state court. But the portion of the\nopinion that focuses on this issue is, as I said, roughly\ntwo pages in length and deals almost entirely with\nNorris. Norris was the contrast case for the court of\nappeals.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But in here it -- you agree\nthat the California court has as much authority to say\nwhat Federal law is as the Ninth Circuit, right? They\nare on a par. Ninth Circuit decisions in no way binds\nthe Supreme Court of California. Isn't that so?\nMR. FERMINO: That is correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So that this state court of\nappeals chose to be respectful to the Ninth Circuit to\nconsider what it had said, doesn't sound to me like a\nvery strong argument.\nMR. FERMINO: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I would\nrespectfully disagree. I think that the -- were this\ndiscussion of Norris to be a much longer discussion -- or\nexcuse me, part of a much longer discussion, that might\nbe true. But its entire focus was Norris. It used\nNorris by way of negative explication to show that the\nfacts before it didn't fall within the rule as derived\nfrom Williams and Flynn. And I think that goes beyond\nrespect to the Ninth Circuit.\nI think it took the case, it grappled with it, it\ndecided that it was different than Norris. And I think\nthat there would have been no way for the court below to\nhave looked at the facts of this case without addressing\nNorris --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what was the -- what in\nyour opinion -- this is why -- as you can see, I'm\nconcerned about buttons. I think they're probably a\nproblem. I think all judges are concerned about them.\nBut then I think about this particular case. And I look\nat that single sentence: \"It was unlikely to be taken as\na sign of anything other than normal grief.\"\nI mean, suppose this had been a different case.\nSuppose the defense in this case was the defendant Smith\ndidn't pull the trigger. It was an unknown person called\nJones. Then if I were on the jury, I would look out, see\nthe buttons, and I'd say, hmmm, the family thinks it was\nSmith. Otherwise they wouldn't be here with those\nbuttons. I could think that.\nBut this isn't that case. This is a case where\neveryone thinks your client pulled the trigger. The only\nquestion is whether the family's son came at him with a\nmachete. So when I look at the buttons, I'd think sure,\nthey don't think the son came at him with -- I mean, they\ndon't think that. He's their son. What would you expect\nthem to think?\nSo that's why I thought that they are saying that\nsentence, in this case. In this case, it would be taken\nas sign of grief and nothing more.\nMR. FERMINO: Well, Justice Breyer, that is\ncertainly a plausible reading of the state court opinion.\nHowever, I think you've also identified one -- the\nproblem with this. It is the risk, not the reality. And\nthat's why we have to look beyond the facts of this case\nand look to the rule as derived from the Williams and\nFlynn case, as I think the court below properly did.\nAnd in doing so, in applying it to this case, I\nthink you have to do away with this kind of courtroom\nbehavior. It is simply not acceptable. It is not\nacceptable to wear --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To wear any buttons? It\nsays, \"Fair Trial.\"\nMR. FERMINO: Any courtroom practice that causes\nan impermissible risk that the jury's -- that the jury\nwould come to a conclusion based on a factor not\nintroduced at trial is entirely prejudicial --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, most -- I don't\nthink -- a typical jury will understand that the victim\nis going to have a family, and they're going to be sorry\nthat he's dead, and they might be there at his trial.\nAnd they may not like the person accused of murdering\ntheir son. That is not -- that is sort of like in every\ncase. That's not -- the buttons don't seem to add much\nto what the jury will derive from seeing the family\nseated behind the prosecution bench.\nMR. FERMINO: I agree with Mr. Chief Justice up\nunto the point of it's not different wearing the buttons.\nI think that you add the buttons, and you are creating --\nyou are doing essentially what the rule derived from both\nWilliams and Flynn teaches us is wrong.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But in Williams and Flynn and\nall of the cases that we have had, whatever way they\nwent, it was always the government requiring a defendant\nto do something, wear prison clothes, appear in court\nwith shackles. And in the case that went for the\ngovernment, the extra officers in the courtroom.\nWe haven't had a case, have we, where it is\nspectator conduct as opposed to government conduct that's\nbeing attacked?\nMR. FERMINO: That is correct, Justice Ginsburg.\nThere isn't a case that is, that -- where the state\naction element, if you will, is not present. However, I\nwould posit that in this case, where you have a judge, a\ntrial judge who denies a lawyer's motion, that you have\nimplicit in that state action, that the court has\nendorsed the practice of --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That certainly goes beyond\nwhere our precedent leaves off. That is, we are dealing\nwith direct impositions by government in a way that poses\nan unacceptable risk of prejudice to the defendant.\nMR. FERMINO: That's correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. And you're having the\njudge say that you can't wear certain signs, you can't\nmake certain demonstrations. If the family were there\nand they -- and one of the members of the family was\nsobbing, with tears coming out of her eyes, I -- that --\nMR. FERMINO: Justice --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- much, it has much more impact\nthan a button.\nMR. FERMINO: It -- and it might. But that kind\nof behavior by a courtroom spectator can be controlled by\na trial judge if -- when it occurs. If it is\nspontaneous, it can be controlled. A rule that\nspectators aren't allowed to emote would be implausible,\nor would be impractical. We are not talking here today\nabout controlling the emotions of spectators. We are\ntalking about an impermissible factor like a message or\nthe risk of a message.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, but there is a First\nAmendment problem when you're dealing with activities of\npeople other than the prosecution, people other than the\nstate, who is bringing this prosecution.\nMR. FERMINO: There is no question that there is a\nFirst Amendment issue here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So that makes it a different\ncase. It makes it very hard to say, well, the Supreme\nCourt's already decided this matter.\nMR. FERMINO: Well, in the First Amendment\ncontext, though, there's a balancing test that needs to\nbe employed, and it --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Sure, it may come out the way --\nit may come out the way you want, but it's hard to say\nthat the Supreme Court, any Supreme Court case bears upon\nit, when we haven't had a case that involves weighing the\nFirst Amendment right of the people in the courtroom to\nwear buttons or cry or --\nMR. FERMINO: I believe that Mr. Cohen in New\nHampshire wearing his sign regarding the draft --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but that cuts against you.\nMR. FERMINO: I understand that, but --\nJUSTICE BREYER: This reason -- suppose,\nhypothetically, I would think -- well, the rule should be\nno buttons. No buttons, no signs, no banners. A\ncourtroom is a place of fair trial, not a place for a\ndemonstration of any kind. Now, if I were to think that,\nand I also were to think it's just too difficult to\nfigure out case by case whether there is or is not an\nimproper influence, suppose I thought both of those\nthings.\nNow, you've heard, quite rightly, the other side\nsays: One, you're supposed to decide whether this was\nclear in the law. Two, if you're worried about the\nfuture, you can't lay down a rule that's clear in the law\neither because of A, AEDPA, and B, the case that was\ncited, which said it's holdings that count, not dicta.\nAll right. You write for me the words I'm\nsupposed to put on paper to achieve your position.\nMR. FERMINO: Justice Breyer, I think that the\nrule derived from the Williams and Flynn cases is that\ncourtroom -- courtroom behavior that creates an\nunacceptable risk that impermissible factors have -- or\nhave caused a jury's verdict to be based not solely on\nevidence introduced at trial is inherently prejudicial.\nAnd unless it advances some important state\ninterest, some compelling state interest like the concern\nthat I believe Justice Ginsburg raised about the forcing\na defendant to appear in prison garb or the shackling\ncases, that rule I think allows the opinion in this case\nof the court below to not violate the prescriptions of\nthe AEDPA. I think that's clear. I think what the court\nbelow did was essentially apply the rule that I just\ndiscussed. And I think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what about -- what if\nthe issue was mourning? The trial is being held and the\nfamilies appear and they're all in black because they're\nstill in mourning. Does that violate this clearly\nestablished rule?\nMR. FERMINO: I think you're getting -- Mr. Chief\nJustice, I think the hypothetical gets closer to it as\nwell. I think a defendant's -- excuse me, a victim's\nfamily wearing, appearing in court every day wearing\nblack gets closer to the kind of message import -- again,\nthe risk, not the reality -- that this case is -- that\nthe court below was concerned with.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, my question is under\nAEDPA, if the state court said, you know, I'm not going\nto keep the family out even in mourning, that would\nviolate the clearly established rule that you've just\narticulated?\nMR. FERMINO: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Even if it didn't, though, I\nsuppose you could draw a line between people who were\ndoing what they naturally do, and some people do wear\nmourning, and some people will come into a courtroom and\nbe reminded of the person who died and sob. But in this\ncase, they're going out of their way to do something that\npeople in mourning do not normally do.\nMR. FERMINO: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And so you've got -- I think\nyou've got a stronger argument.\nThe problem that I have in this case is that,\nnumber one, I view the wearing of the buttons, as I just\ndescribed it, as something that is abnormal and something\nthat is intended to presumably get the jury's attention.\nI don't know why otherwise they would be doing it.\nAnd from whatever source, we do know that the\nbutton was at least two inches wide and maybe larger.\nSo it's reasonable to suppose that the jury saw it and\nunderstood perfectly that these were people who were\nraising, in effect, an issue of sympathy. I can\nunderstand that, and under the general rule out of\nWilliams and Flynn, it seems to me there's a pretty darn\ngood argument for saying, yes, an unacceptable risk has\nbeen raised of emotionalism in the jury's deliberations\nas opposed to dispassionate consideration of courtroom\nevidence.\nWhat, however, do I make of the fact that not one\nsingle court has ever reached that conclusion and -- you\nknow, as a constitutional matter? Am I in the position\nof sort of being Jim, and they're all out of step with\nJim? I'm raising a question about my own judgment\nin relation to the fact that no other court seems to have\ncome to that conclusion. What do you think I should make\nof that?\nMR. FERMINO: I think it is a factor to consider\nin the Court's analysis. However, I think the facts of\nthis case are unique precisely because this typically\ndoesn't -- we don't get this far because most trial\njudges don't allow this kind of conduct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there have been -- haven't\nthere been court decisions that have held that buttons\ndidn't compromise a fair trial right?\nMR. FERMINO: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So in assessing the\nreasonableness of the California Supreme Court's\ndecision, how could we say Federal law was clearly\nestablished when other courts considering our precedent\nhave gone the other way?\nMR. FERMINO: Because I think that under -- I\nthink that this Court looking at the \"contrary to\" prong\nof the analysis would -- can come to a conclusion that\nthe state court's decision wasn't -- I'm getting ahead of\nmyself.\nI think the Court can properly, in looking at it\nfrom a \"contrary to\" analysis, come to the conclusion\nthat, even with that body of case law, that the state\ncourt got it wrong, that it misapplied the clearly\nestablished law of this Court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't want to put your\n-- hang your hat on the \"contrary to\" prong, though, do\nyou? Your argument, I thought, was an unreasonable\napplication argument.\nMR. FERMINO: I think it's both, Mr. Chief\nJustice. I think it's both. I think -- I don't need to\nhang my hat on the \"contrary to\" because I think under\neither prong --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but, as Justice\nGinsburg pointed out, we've never even had a case\ninvolving spectators. So it's not contrary to clearly\nestablished law. We have cases stating the general\nprinciple on which it relies, so maybe it's an\nunreasonable application. But \"contrary to\" seems an\nawful stretch.\nMR. FERMINO: I wouldn't go -- Mr. Chief Justice,\nI would not go as far as \"an awful stretch,\" but I would\nthink that we, under the unreasonable application prong,\nwe certainly win. I think that there is also an argument\nunder the \"contrary to.\"\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The record is confusing, at\nleast as I read it -- please correct me if I'm wrong --\non the showing of how many days these buttons were worn.\nA, is it clear from the record how many days the buttons\nwere worn?\nMR. FERMINO: It is not. It is not clear at all\nfrom the record how many days.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So it may have been for just one\nday of the trial?\nMR. FERMINO: It may have been. But according to\nthe declarations that were submitted in the petition for\ncollateral review, those are petitions -- those are\ndeclarations of the trial counsel and of respondent's\nmother -- it is that they were worn on multiple days by\nseveral members of the family, and that the buttons were\nanywhere from two to four inches in diameter. And that's\nin the record.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Where does it say that?\nMR. FERMINO: Those declarations appear --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: These are in the joint appendix.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: These were declarations filed\nwith the United States district court in habeas?\nMR. FERMINO: They were filed actually as part of\nthe state collateral review proceedings. They were filed\nwith the habeas. And it appears that they are at the JA\n6 and 8.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Where does it say in there that\nthe buttons were worn every day?\nMR. FERMINO: If I did -- I'm sorry, that question\n--\nJUDGE ALITO: It says that the family members were\nthere every day, or for many days. It doesn't say they\nwore the buttons every day, unless I'm missing --\nMR. FERMINO: No, Justice Alito, if I said that, I\nmisspoke. I was trying to say that the record is not\nclear as to the frequency.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was a time when the trial\njudge said stop. Was there not? He initially denied the\nmotion.\nMR. FERMINO: Correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought that there was a\ntime in the course of the trial when he told the family\nmembers to stop wearing the buttons.\nMR. FERMINO: I don't believe so, Justice\nGinsburg. I think that they were never admonished not to\nwear them, but that the original ruling of the trial\njudge stood as far as the wearing of the buttons was\nconcerned.\nJUSTICE ALITO: In his opinion on denial of\nrehearing, Judge Kleinfeld on the Ninth Circuit made the\npoint that at criminal trials -- and I suppose at other\ntrials -- it is an accepted feature of the proceeding\nthat there are going to be spectators who identify with\none or the other party. And there may be relatives of\nthe defendant in a criminal case. There may be relatives\nof the victims. And it's apparent from their behavior\nwhat they think about the case and which side should win.\nAnd that's sort of a baseline that has to be\naccepted in judging, not whether wearing buttons is good\nas a -- whether we think it would be good if we were\nannouncing a court rule, but whether there's a violation\nof due process. Do you accept that?\nMR. FERMINO: Justice Alito, I do, as far as it\ngoes, accept that as a baseline. I think Judge Bea in a\nseparate dissent likened it to a family wedding, that we\nall know who is here for which party. That we have no\nquarrel with.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So what is it about these\nparticular buttons that's reflected in the record that\nshows that it goes significantly beyond what would be\ninferred just from that rather common feature of trials?\nMR. FERMINO: I think in looking at the rule again\nderived from Williams and Flynn, we don't have to go\nthere. It's the risk, not the reality. I don't know\nwhat could be inferred, and we don't know what was in the\njurors' minds as they saw those buttons. But the point\nis that it could affect the outcome. It is an\nimpermissible factor that causes the possibility that the\njurors' verdict is based on something other than the\nevidence.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why is there a greater risk? Why\ndo the buttons convey -- involve a greater risk than the\nkind of behavior that Judge Kleinfeld was referring to?\nMR. FERMINO: Because you can imagine as a juror\n-- jurors are very attentive during trials -- that they\nlook out into the audience and see in the jury box -- I\nmean, out in the audience, a group of people wearing\nbuttons. What are those buttons? What's on there?\nWhat's the point of -- there's a degree of scrutiny\nthat's naturally going to occur by an attentive juror.\nThat's really the issue.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let's assume -- risk of what?\nThat's what I'm puzzled by. Let's assume that the\nbuttons were big enough that they could recognize that\nthe buttons were the face of the deceased for whose\nmurder the trial was about. Let's assume all that. What\nrisk is that?\nYou know, during sentencing I can understand, oh,\nhe caused so much grief to so many people, once we found\nhim guilty, we should sock him with a stiff sentence.\nBut during the guilt trial? I mean, I see, gee, the\nvictim's family loved him a lot. This guy must be\nguilty. That doesn't follow at all.\nIn the guilt phase, I don't see how that can\nhave any effect on the jury.\nMR. FERMINO: Well, Justice Scalia, I think it's a\nrisk of a factor that is not subjected to adversarial\ntesting. It is the possibility that it could have an\nimpact.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see the possibility. You\ntell me that --\nMR. FERMINO: Here you have --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is there a real possibility that\na jury is going to say, since this man's -- this victim's\nfamily loved him so much, this guy must be guilty?\nMR. FERMINO: But that's only one possible message\nof this button. And again, that's where I'm contrasting\nthe risk versus the reality. It's that it could be any\nmessage that's sent.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do you have to depend on there\nbeing a message? Isn't it enough if there is an\ninfluence that is conveyed? I mean, what I thought the\nproblem was, was that there was as a result of the\nobtrusive wearing of the button, that it created a risk\nsimply of an emotional approach to the determination of\nguilt or innocence.\nThe jurors are more likely to feel sorry for the\nfamily members sitting there a few feet away from them.\nPerhaps they may be more likely to feel sorry for the\nvictim, but certainly for the family members. And it\nwould be that improper influence of emotionalism as\nopposed to a particular message that is the problem here,\nisn't it?\nMR. FERMINO: I don't disagree with that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do you accept that?\nMR. FERMINO: I do accept that, and I don't need\nto rely on a message. I would agree with the argument\nthat you've advanced.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. FERMINO: The -- I think it is important here\nto look at the fact that no party in this case -- that\nthe state has not advanced that this is a practice that\nshould be endorsed or adopted. It is clear that everyone\ninvolved has had a concern with the wearing of buttons or\nany other kind of introduction into the proceeding that\nwould otherwise not be subject to meaningful adversarial\ntesting, and I think that's the problem in this case.\nAnd I do believe if you look closely at the state\ncourt opinion in this case, you will see that the court\nbelow's opinion was correct, that they did not tease out\nof the opinion or parse or apply any kind of tendentious\nreading, when you look at exactly what the state court\ndecided.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's just because we\nhaven't had a First Amendment case yet. I mean, we just\nhave parties arguing in the context of the criminal trial\nfor the defendant, for the state. Let's wait until the\nACLU brings a case about people who want to wear buttons\nin court. Then you're going to have people arguing,\npeople ought to be able to wear buttons, just as they can\nwear a shirt that says \"Blip the Draft.\"\nMR. FERMINO: But this Court, I think, could craft\nan opinion that addresses that concern without the need\nfor simply awaiting that day.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Counsel, I'm not sure you're\nright that nobody was concerned about -- everybody\nthought the factors were wrong. I don't think the trial\njudge did. The trial judge said he saw no possibility of\nprejudice.\nMR. FERMINO: And I misspoke. You're correct,\nJustice Stevens. The trial judge did reach that\nconclusion.\nIf there are no other questions, I would --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Fermino.\nMR.
