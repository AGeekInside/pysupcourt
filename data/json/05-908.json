KORRELL\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. KORRELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court.\nIn an effort to achieve its desired racial\nbalance in its popular high schools, the Seattle school\ndistrict denied over 300 children, both white and\nminority children, admission to their chosen schools\nsolely because of their race and without any\nindividualized consideration. This strikes at the heart\nof the Equal Protection Clause which commands that\nGovernment treat people as individuals, not simply as\nmembers of a racial class.\nThis fundamental equal protection principle\nwas reiterated in Grutter and in Gratz. The central\nquestion in this case is not, as the school district and\nmany of its allies suggest, whether integration is\nimportant or whether desegregation is compelling. The\ncentral question in this case is whether outside of the\nremedial context, diversity defined as the school\ndistrict does, as a white/non-white racial balance, can\nbe a compelling interest that justifies the use of race\ndiscrimination in high school admissions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Korrell --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you disagree in general\nwith the Solicitor General's brief? Do you agree in\ngeneral with the brief submitted by the Government or do\nyou have differences with it in its approach?\nMR. KORRELL: Justice Kennedy, we -- we\nagree mostly with the Solicitor General's brief. I\nbelieve the Solicitor General might take a different\nposition on whether race neutral mechanisms can be used\nto accomplish race specific purposes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I can --\nMR. KORRELL: But that's not an issue the\ncourt needs to reach in this case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it, it is a point\nthat I, I'd like both him and you to discuss at some\npoint during your argument. If -- can you use race for\nsite selection? When you have, you need to build a new\nschool. There are three sites. One of them would be\nall one race. Site two would be all the other race.\nSite three would be a diversity of races. Can the\nschool board with, with the intent to have diversity\npick site number 3?\nMR. KORRELL: Justice Kennedy, I think the\nanswer turns on the reason that the schools have the\nracial compositions that they do.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It -- there's -- well, we\ncan have all kinds of different hypotheticals, but\nthere's residential housing segregation, and it wants,\nit wants, the board wants to have diversity.\nMR. KORRELL: Your Honor, our position is\nthat if, if the resulting -- if the racial composition\nof those schools is not the result of past de jure\nsegregation --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No. It is a new school.\nIt's a new school.\nMR. KORRELL: In that case, Your Honor,\nParents' position is that the Government can't be in the\nposition of deciding what right racial mix is.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So it'd have to take the\nthree sites, all of them in the hypothetical, all of\nthem equal, and just flip a coin, because otherwise it\nwould be using a --\nMR. KORRELL: Your Honor, obviously it is\nnot the facts of the Seattle case. In the hypothetical\nYour Honor posits, perhaps the right analogy is\nsomething similar to the, a redistricting cases. Where\na court could look at see whether the racial motive was\na predominant factor as opposed to -- JUSTICE KENNEDY:\nNo, no. The school board says we want, right up front,\nwe want racial diversity in our new schools. Illicit\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment in your case?\nMR. KORRELL: Your Honor, school districts\ncan do many, many things through race neutral means that\nthey could not do with race discrimination.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But can they have a race\nconscious objective? I think that that's the question\nthat Justice Kennedy is asking you, and I don't get a\nclear answer. You say you can't use a racial means.\nBut can you have a racial objective? That is, you want\nto achieve balance in the schools.\nMR. KORRELL: Justice Ginsburg, our position\nis that that is prohibited by the Constitution\nabsent past discrimination.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You would object, then, to\nmagnet schools? You would object to any system that is\ndesigned to try to cause people voluntarily to go into a\nsystem that is more racially mixed?\nMR. KORRELL: Justice Scalia, our objection\nto the Seattle program is that it is not a race neutral\nmeans.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, I understand. But I'm\ntrying to find what, you know, the outer limits of your\ncontentions are. It doesn't seem to me that your briefs\nindicated that you would object to something like magnet\nschools. The -- even if one of the purposes of those\nschools is to try to cause more white students to go to\nschools that are predominantly non-white. It's just\nvoluntary, I mean, but the object is to achieve a\ngreater racial mix.\nMR. KORRELL: Your Honor, we object to\nthe -- if that's the sole goal of a school district\nabsent past discrimination, we object. But that kind of\nhypothetical situation isn't even necessary for the\nCourt to reach.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it may not be\nnecessary for you but it might be necessary for us when\nwe write the case. We're not writing just on a very\nfact-specific issue. Of course, the follow-up question,\nand the Solicitor General can address it too, is this:\nAssuming some race-conscious measures are permissible to\nhave diversity, isn't it odd to say you can't use race\nas a means? I mean, that's the next question. That\nmay, in fact, be why you give the -- seem to give the\nanswer that you do. You just don't want to embrace that\ncontradiction.\nMR. KORRELL: Your Honor, it is certainly\ndifficult if race -- if racial balance can be a goal of\ngovernment, then it is more difficult to defend a racial\nbalancing plan as unconstitutional, or to attack one as\nconstitutional.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That is true.\nMR. KORRELL: And this Court has said\nrepeatedly that racial balancing is unconstitutional.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, we have said it\nrepeatedly in contexts different from this. I mean, the\nparadigm context in which we made remarks to that\neffect, stated that, are affirmative action cases. The\npoint of the affirmative action case is that some\ncriterion which otherwise would be the appropriate\ncriterion of selection is being displaced by a racial\nmix criterion. That is not what is happening here.\nThis is not an affirmative action case.\nSo why should the statements that have been\nmade in these entirely different contexts necessarily\ndecide this case?\nMR. KORRELL: Justice Souter, we disagree\nthat the analysis in the Grutter and Gratz cases is\nentirely different from the analysis in this case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But don't you agree that\nthose cases left someone out of the picture entirely\nbecause we were talking about a selection of one person\nor another? The word \"sorting\" has been used in this\ncontext because everybody gets to go to school. Indeed,\nthey are required to go to school. So no one gets left\nout of the system, and I think there have been Court of\nAppeals judges who have noted. We have never had that\ncase before, not like the affirmative action cases.\nMR. KORRELL: Your Honor, I agree that this\nCourt has not had a case like this before. I disagree,\nhowever, that it's not like the Grutter or Gratz\ndecision. The plaintiff in Gratz, as the Court is\naware, attended the University of Michigan at Dearborn.\nHe got into a school. He didn't get into the school\nthat he wanted to go to. Similarly, in our case, with\nthe plaintiffs, they wanted to go to their preferred\nschools, schools that the school district acknowledges\nprovided different educational opportunities, produced\ndifferent educational outcomes, and they were preferable\nto the parents and children who wanted to go.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you agree that this\nis not an affirmative action case? Is it not? Wherein\ndoes it differ? I thought that the school district was\nselecting some people because they wanted a certain\nracial mix in the schools, and were taking the\naffirmative action of giving a preference to students of\na certain race. Why isn't -- why doesn't that qualify\nas affirmative action?\nMR. KORRELL: If that's what affirmative\naction is, Your Honor, then --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't know what\nelse it is. What do you think it is that causes you to\nseemingly accept the characterization that this is not\nit?\nMR. KORRELL: Your Honor, perhaps I\nmisspoke. I didn't mean to accept the characterization\nthat this case is not at all --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let me help you out by\ntaking you back to my question. One of the\ncharacteristics of the affirmative action cases was the\ndisplacement of some other otherwise generally\nacknowledged relevant criterion such as ability as shown\nin test scores, grade point averages, things like that;\nand that was a characteristic of those cases.\nIt is not a characteristic of this case, as\nI understand it.\nMR. KORRELL: I'm not sure that's exactly\nright, Your Honor. In this case, the school district\nadmitted in the response to request for admissions that\nhad the identified children been of a different race,\nthey would have been admitted into the schools.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought there was a\ncriterion here, and that is, you can go to whatever\nschool you want. You are allowed to go to a certain\nchoice of school. The criterion was your choice.\nMR. KORRELL: Justice Scalia, you're right.\nAnd there's another criterion which I think is getting\nto Justice --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, when you state\nJustice Scalia is right, you are assuming, I think as\nyour brief assumed, that the definition of the benefit\nto be received here is the active choice, not the\nprovision of an education.\nNow the active choice may be of value. I do\nnot suggest that it is not. Clearly the school district\nthinks it does or it wouldn't provide choice. But it is\nnot the entire benefit that is being provided, and the\nprincipal benefit is the education, not the choice of\nschools. Isn't that correct?\nMR. KORRELL: Your Honor, they are both\nbenefits. I would point Your Honor back to this Court's\ndecision in Gratz, where the same analysis would apply.\nAnd if Your Honor's analysis is correct, that would\nmean, I think, that the Gratz case would have been\ndecided differently.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I think that the point\nthat Justice Souter is trying to make, as I understand\nit, is of course there are similarities to Gratz, they\ncan choose, but there's a big difference. The\nsimilarity in Grutter, or the difference in Grutter and\nGratz is that you had to prod a school that was supposed\nto be better than others, that the members of that\nschool, the faculty and the administration tried to make\nit better than others. It was an elite merit selection\nacademy. And if you put the black person in, the white\nperson can't get the benefit of that.\nHere we have no merit selection system.\nMerit is not an issue. The object of the people who run\nthis place is not to create a school better than others,\nit is to equalize the schools. That's in principle and\nin practice, if you look at the numbers, you see that\nthe six schools that were at the top, their position\nwould shift radically from year to year, preferences was\nabout equal among them. They have the same curriculum,\nthey have similar faculties, and I don't think anyone\ncan say either in theory or in practice, that one of\nthese schools happened to be like that prize of\nUniversity of Michigan, a merit selection system. That,\nI think, was a major difference that he was getting at,\nwhy is this not the same kind of thing? That was at\nissue in Grutter and Gratz. Now what is your response\nto that?\nMR. KORRELL: Your Honor, we have several\nresponses. The first is that the premise of Your\nHonor's question is that the schools are in essence\nfungible for purposes of providing a high school\neducation. And I would direct Your Honor to the\nDistrict Court judge's decision, a footnote in the\ndecision in which she acknowledged that the schools were\nnot of equal quality, that they provided different\nlevels of education.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course they're not.\nThat's why some of them were oversubscribed. That's why\nothers were undersubscribed.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I didn't say that they\nwere. What I said was that the object of the school\nboard and the administering authority was to make them\nroughly equal. I said that in terms of curriculum and\nfaculty, they're about roughly equal. And in terms of\nchoice, what you see is a wide variation in choice by\nthose who want to go as to which is their preference\namong six schools over a period of five years.\nAnd that suggests a rough effort to create\nthe equality, not an effort as in Michigan, to run a\nmerit selection system.\nMR. KORRELL: I agree with Your Honor that\nthere's not a merit selection system in --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fine. Now the question is,\nwhy doesn't that fact that this is not a merit selection\nsystem put a different kind of thing, a sorting system\nor a system designed to maintain a degree of\nintegration, why doesn't that difference make a\ndifference?\nMR. KORRELL: Your Honor, I think that the\nfundamental command of the Equal Protection Clause is\nthat government treats as individuals, not as members of\na racial group. And that command I don't think is\nsuspended because of the nature of a school's admissions\nprocess. That right is still possessed by the\nindividual students, and if a student is entitled to be\ntreated as an individual as opposed to a member of a\nracial group at a university level, it's Parents'\nposition they are entitled to that same protection at\nthe high school level.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Korrell, before your\ntime runs out, I did want to clarify something about the\nstanding of the plaintiffs here.\nDo I understand correctly that none of the\nparents who originally brought this lawsuit have\nchildren who are now pre-ninth grade, but that\nnewcomers, people who recently joined, do have children\nof pre-ninth grade age?\nMR. KORRELL: Your Honor, that is mostly\ncorrect. There is also a family that joined the parents\nassociation back in 2000 that has a child in seventh\ngrade, that will be approaching high school by the time\nthis Court decides the case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the lawsuit was\noriginally brought by a corporate entity, correct?\nMR. KORRELL: That's correct, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not by individual\nparents.\nMR. KORRELL: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you don't dispute\nthat membership, for standing purposes, the membership\nis what counts, not the association but the members?\nMR. KORRELL: Your Honor, my understanding\nof the Court's jurisprudence on associational standing\nis as long as a member of the association has standing,\nthen the association has it. We submit that that has\nbeen established by the complaint, the interrogatory\nresponses, and --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, if it is a member,\njurisdictional questions generally, don't we go by what\nthe membership was when the complaint was filed and not\nwhat it has become in the course of the litigation?\nMR. KORRELL: I don't think that's right,\nYour Honor. We cited to the Court the Pannell case, the\nAssociated General Contractors case, and Roe versus\nWade, all of which look at post-filing factors to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but the transaction\ncase situation is different.\nMR. KORRELL: You're right, Your Honor, none\nof those were class action cases. Pannell and\nAssociated General Contractors were association cases\nmuch like this one. Roe, of course, was individual\nplaintiffs.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I have a question. Does\nthe record tell us, the 300 people who have failed to\nget into the schools they wanted, the racial composition\nof that group?\nMR. KORRELL: It does, Justice Stevens. The\nrecord shows that 100, roughly 100 students who were\ndenied admission to their preferred schools were\nnon-white and roughly 200 who were denied admission were\nwhite students.\nIf there are no further questions, Mr. Chief\nJustice, I will reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nGeneral Clement.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nRespondents assert an interest in addressing\nthe most racially isolated schools in the district, yet\ntheir plan does not address the two most racially\nconcentrated high schools in their district. They\nlikewise have certain interests in diversity, yet their\nplan does not directly address diversity other than pure\nracial diversity, and they do nothing to assemble the\nkind of critical mass that was at issue in the Grutter\ncase.\nIn fact, if you look at the program and how\nit operates in practice, the triggering critical mass\nfor the use of the racial tie breaker is when a\nstudent -- when a school has less than 25 percent white\nstudents or when it has less than 45 percent non-white\nstudents. There is nothing in the record or in social\nscience that suggests that there's a radical difference\nin the critical mass based on the race of the students.\nOf course what explains that difference in\nthe triggering critical mass of white students versus\nnon-white students, the answer to that does not lie in\neducational theory, the answer lies in the demographics\nof the district. The district happens to have 25\npercent more non-white students than white students, so\nthey trigger the race tie breaker at a different point\nunder those circumstances.\nWith all respect to respondents, the answer\nto how this program works lies not in diversity but in\ndemographics. They are clearly working backwards from\nthe overall demographics of the school district rather\nthan working forward to any clearly articulated\npedagogical role.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if I could\nget back to Justice Kennedy's question earlier, how do\nyou distinguish decisions like citing magnet schools,\nclustering, from the consideration of race in this case?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I\nthink that those decisions are different primarily\nbecause the resulting decision is not a racial\nclassification. And if you think about it, when you had\nan overt racial classification, like you clearly do in\nthese cases, then you naturally ask the strict scrutiny\nquestions and look for a compelling interest. If\ninstead you start with a race-neutral government action\nthat doesn't classify people directly based on race,\nthen I suppose you could try to do some kind of\nArlington Heights-Washington Davis type analysis.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what would you do\nwith strategic site selection in order to create racial\ndiversity?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Kennedy, I\nthink --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, that's expressed\nand principal purpose. You know the hypothetical.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Okay. And Justice\nKennedy, I will answer the hypo, but let me say it's\neasy for purposes of the hypo to say the sole reason was\nfor race. In the real world, in fact I can't imagine\nthat a site decision won't be based at least in part on\nconcerns about the overall educational benefits. And I\nthink that's important. The reason I start with that\npreface is because when you have mixed motives and a\nvariety of factors I think you'd be unlikely to strike\ndown that kind of motive.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you suggesting there\nwas no consideration of overall educational benefits in\nthis plan?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, Justice Stevens. I'm\nsaying you start at a different departure point when you\nhave an express racial classification. I think I'm\ntrying to answer Justice Kennedy's question about what\nif you have a sort of a race-conscious goal at some\nlevel and that's why you select a particular site or you\ndecide that you're going to invest in magnet schools and\nwant to put a magnet school in a particular school\ndistrict. My humble point is simply that in the real\nworld I think you're unlikely to have the pure racial\nmotive type objective. I would say that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose it was faculty,\nand the school district makes a deliberate effort to\nhave members of the white race and members of other\nraces represented in -- on the faculty of every school,\nso you won't have one school with all white teachers, so\nthat you'll have a mix, and that's quite explicit.\nThat's their objective and they're using a racial\ncriterion criterion to get there.\nWould that be impermissible, to have a mix\nof teachers in all the schools?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I\nthink if what they wanted to do is have an mix of\nteachers that might be okay. If they're going to start\nassigning teachers to particular schools and have sort\nof racial quotas for the faculty at various schools, I\nthink that crosses a line.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what would be okay?\nHow would you get there other than having -- the point\nI'm trying to make has been made by others. Let me read\nfrom Judge Boudin's decision. He says: \"The choice is\nbetween openly using race as a criterion or concealing\nit through some clumsy or proxy device.\"\nIf you want to have an integrated school and\nyou site the schools deliberately to achieve that\nobjective, it's very hard for me to see how you can have\na racial objective but a nonracial means to get there.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, with respect,\nJustice Ginsburg, I think there's a fundamental\ndifference between how the same intent with two\nprograms, there's a fundamental difference if one of\nthem necessarily classifies people on the basis of their\nskin color and the other does not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: General Clement, is there\nanything unconstitutional about desiring a mingling of\nthe races and establishing policies which achieve that\nresult but which do not single out individuals and\ndisqualify them for certain things because of their\nrace? Is there anything wrong with a policy of wanting\nto have racial mix?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Scalia, we would\ntake the position that there's not and that there's a\nfundamental difference between whether or not the policy\nmanages to avoid classifying people on the basis of\ntheir race.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: At page 7 of your brief\nyou say: \"School districts have an unquestioned\ninterest in reducing minority isolation.\" If I put a\nperiod in there, then I would get to my strategic site\nselection, and I still haven't got your answer on that.\nYou don't put a period there. You say: \". .have an\nunquestioned interest in reducing minority isolation\nthrough race-neutral means.\" And this brings up this\nsame question Justice Ginsburg had. Isn't it odd\njurisprudence where we have an objective that we state\nin one set of terms but a means for achieving it in\nanother set of terms, unless your answer is that\nindividual classification by race is, is impermissible,\nbut other, more broad measures based on, with a racial\npurpose are all right?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think that's ultimately\nthe answer, Justice Kennedy, which is there's a\nfundamental difference between classifying people and\nhaving the real world effect. I mean, in this case\ndon't forget that there were 89 minority students that\nwanted to attend Franklin High School. They could not\nsolely because of their race. At the same time, every\nwhite student who applied to Franklin High School was\nallowed in solely base would on their race.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And what is the answer to\nmy strategic site selection hypothetical?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: We would say that's fine.\nWe would say that that is permissible, for the school to\npursue that.\nJust to get back, though, again, we say that\nthat avoiding racial isolation is -- I just want to make\nthe point, we say that racial isolation is an important\ngovernment interest. I think if you put this plan up\nagainst that objective, it solely fails, because there\nare two high schools that I think you would look at as\nbeing racially isolated. They're Cleveland n Rainier\nBeach, and this plan does nothing to directly address\nthose high schools.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: My question is really Judge\nBoudin's question. You are in effect saying that by\nsiting the school they can achieve exactly the objective\nthey are seeking here. It's a question of do the -- the\nquestion comes down to whether they can do it candidly\nor do it by clumsier. That is, it seems to me, an\nunacceptable basis to draw a constitutional line.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: With respect,\nJustice Souter, first of all I think the kind of\ninterests we're talking about, avoiding racial isolation\nand the like, do not lend themselves to absolutely\ntargeted, it has to be 15 percent, it has to be 50, it\nhas to be 25, it has to be 45. I would actually suggest\nthat the danger is in the opposite direction.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That isn't what they said\nhere. I mean, they were dealing with a zone within\nwhich they operated, and it was only when the numbers\ngot to the outer limits that they said, okay, we're\ngoing to use a racial criterion to prevent anything\nmore, any more extreme disparity.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I mean, in the\nsecond stage --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's what they do when\nthey site the school. They said, you know, we'll get a\nrough whatever it is, 40-60 mix.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think in the\nsecond case you'll see that, you know, the same logic\nthat leads to this leads itself to stricter bands. But\nlet me say, I would have thought the analysis would run\nthe exact opposite way, and I would think that if you\ngot to the point, which the Ninth Circuit did on page\n58-A of its opinion, where it says, you know, with this\nobjective that we've allowed, the most narrowly tailored\nway to get there is to expressly use race. I would have\nthought that might have suggested there was something\nwrong with the compelling interest, if that's the way --\nJUSTICE BREYER: While you're talking about\nthe way, let me ask a practical question. 35 years ago\nin Swann, this Court said that a school board,\nparticularly an elected one -- it didn't say that\n-- \"could well conclude that to prepare students to live\nin a pluralistic society each school should have a\nprescribed ratio of Negro to white students reflecting\nthe proportion of the district as a whole.\" Far more\nradical than anything that's at issue here.\nThen it adds: \"To do this as an educational\npolicy is within the broad discretionary powers of\nschool authorities.\" That's what this Court said 35\nyears ago. Thousands of school districts across the\ncountry, we're told, have relied on that statement in an\nopinion to try to bring about a degree of integration.\nYou can answer this in the next case if you want. So\nthink about it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can answer in\nthis case, General.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: My question, of course, is\nsimply this. When you have thousands of school\ndistricts relying on this to get a degree of integration\nin the United States of America, what are you telling\nthis Court is going to happen when we start suddenly\nmaking -- departing from the case? Do you want us to\noverrule it? Why? Why practically?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: General?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: If I could answer the\nquestion, I think that the fact that you point to the\nspecific language of Swann is helpful, because the Court\nthere in dictum -- I think everybody would agrees that\nwas dictum -- said that you could achieve a prescribed\nratio. And that's exactly where the logic of the other\nside, of the Ninth Circuit, of Judge Boudin, with all\nrespect, that's where it takes you.\nAnd I think anybody that relied on that\nlanguage in the wake of cases like Crosson, in the wake\nof Freeman against Pitts, that said achieving a racial\nbalance for its own sake is not constitutional, and\nBakke and Grutter against Gratz, that all said that\nracial balancing is verboten, I think those school\ndistricts would have been misguided in relying on that\nlanguage. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\nMr. Madden.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL F. MADDEN\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS\nMR. MADDEN: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nWhen Seattle was last before this Court you\nstruck down a State law that prevented bussing for\nintegration purposes because that law prevented the\nschool board from seeking to provide the educational\nbenefits of integrated schools. At that time you said\nit was clear enough that all children benefit from\nexposure to ethnic and racial diversity in the classroom\nby preparing them for citizenship in our pluralistic\nsociety and teaching them to live in harmony and mutual\nrespect.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Madden, that's\ncertainly an admirable goal. Could a local unit, a\nmunicipality, or even a State have another goal? Let's\nsay what used to be great about the United States was\nthe presence of various ethnic groups. I mean, there\nwere the Pennsylvania Dutch, there were the Amish, there\nwere Little Italy's, there were Chinatowns, and these\nthings are beginning to disappear. And we think that we\nshould encourage the continuation of that diversity, as\nthe Federal Government has done with respect to American\nIndian tribes.\nAnd therefore, we're going to use public\nfunds for such things as street festivals, a Chinatown\nstreet festival, an Italian street festival. We're\ngoing to encourage those organizations that maintain\nthat separateness.\nIs there anything unconstitutional about\nthat objective?\nMR. MADDEN: Providing funding for street\nfestivals?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: About the objective? I\nmean, think we should foster separateness? Is there\nanything wrong --\nMR. MADDEN: I think that in the context\nthat you've described it that would be constitutionally\nvery problematic.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Fine -- it would be\nproblematic?\nMR. MADDEN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why?\nMR. MADDEN: Because I can conceive that\nit's not -- unlike education, where the goal is to\neducate the entire community and to help to prepare the\ncommunity, the students to live in that community, it's\nnot a traditional role of government --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well then, let me change\nJustice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Please let me finish the\nline of questioning.\nAssume with me that it is not an\nunconstitutional objective, which I am sure it's not.\nCould the -- could the government achieve that objective\nby barring people from moving into Little Italy or\ngiving a preference to some people to buy real estate in\nLittle Italy if they are of Italian ancestry? Could it\ndo that? Absolutely not, right?\nMR. MADDEN: I would agree with you.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So it would appear that\neven if the objective is okay, you cannot achieve it by\nany means whatever. And the mere fact that the\nobjective of achieving a diverse balanced society is\nperfectly all right, although certainly not the only\nobjective in the world. The mere fact that it's okay\ndoesn't mean you can achieve it by any means whatever?\nMR. MADDEN: I would submit that there's a\nfundamental difference between the circumstances you've\ndescribed and a school system which takes all comers and\nis tasked to educate them by preparing them to live in a\npluralistic society.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, my slight\nmodification of Justice Scalia's hypothetical -- and it\nproceeds on the same theory -- is suppose there's a huge\ndemand for housing. A developer has a plan to build 500\nunits. Can the city say, we'll grant you the permit on\nthe ground, on the condition that 30 percent of all the\nhouses go to minorities? That means people will live\ntogether. Then we can have a school, a school that can\nbe diverse.\nMR. MADDEN: I would say not, because\nhousing decisions are inherently private, unlike public\neducation. And there's no way to know how those\nbenefits are being distributed, if they're going to be\ncomparable. I would say no, it is not comparable to the\nschools.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, your system is the\none that gives a choice to the individuals.\nMR. MADDEN: It does, and when there are\nmore choices than there are seats available.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does that make a\ndifference? What if you adopted a plan that insisted on\na more or less rigid 60-40 ratio at every school and\nassignments were made on that basis. It was not a\nfollow-on to a choice system.\nMR. MADDEN: Well, I think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would that be\nunconstitutional?\nMR. MADDEN: Excuse me, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI'm sorry to interrupt.\nI think in each circumstance it depends on\nthe status of the school system.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The same -- the\nfacts are otherwise the same, except you conclude that\nprivate choice contributes to further division rather\nthan integration and so the assignments are made on a\n60-40 basis.\nMR. MADDEN: I think that is roughly the\ncircumstance that existed in the first Seattle case,\nMr. Chief Justice. And additionally, I think that you\nthen have to move into the realm of what's\nconstitutionally permissible and can in a\nconstitutionally permissible use of race a school system\naccommodate other values like choice and neighborhood\nties and family connections to the school system.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I still don't have\nyour answer.\nIs strict assignment 60-40 without regard to\nchoice constitutional or not?\nMR. MADDEN: I -- I would want to know more\nabout the system because I think strictly if there's\nnothing else and there's no flexibility, I think it\npresents narrow tailoring problems.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And how does this\nnot present narrow tailoring problems if -- if the --\nwhen you get to the fact of choice, the sole criteria at\nthat level is the same as would be the case in a 60-40\nassignment.\nMR. MADDEN: Well, we have accommodated\nchoice to the extent there are seats available. And\nthen we go to family connections. And then we -- in\noperation, admit everyone who lives close to the school.\nAnd then as to those that live further away, we look to\nsee what's the school's racial demographic. Is it\nsignificantly different than the community's? These\nschools we have talked about have been the objects of\nsignificantly more aggressive segregation efforts, and\nthe board wanted to preserve those.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One of the, one of\nthe factors our prior cases looked to was whether the\nplan has a logical end point. What is the logical end\npoint in this plan?\nMR. MADDEN: Well, the board actually at\nevery turn reflected in the record discussed whether it\nwas necessary to continue the use of race, whether to\nnarrow it, and eventually to end it. And I think it is\nin the joint appendix at 408, the superintendent's\ntestimony of the, simultaneously the measures that the\nboard was implementing in terms of resource allocation,\nimplementation of new programs, because they realized\nthat by diversifying choice, they could hopefully\nachieve some of these same ends, not as quickly, not as\nefficiently, but that they could achieve them. That's\nbeen indeed the entire trajectory of Seattle's\nintegration efforts since the first Seattle plan.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But in Grutter we said, to\nshorten it just a little bit, at page 329-330 of the\nU.S. Reports, 539, \"the law school's interest is not\nsimply to assure within its student body some specified\npercentage of a particular group because of race ...\nthat would amount to outright racial balancing which is\npatently unconstitutional.\" And that seems to be what\nyou have here.\nMR. MADDEN: I think that the term racial\nbalancing has two significant meanings. One is a plan\nthat does not foster a compelling interest. And second,\na plan that is too rigid, a quota, for instance, that\nmight not pass narrow tailoring given the context.\nIn this case we're not after a rigid set of\nnumbers, and certainly not after a rigid set of numbers\nfor their own sake. The purpose was to have schools\nthat had become diverse through integration efforts not\nstray too far from the community's demographic because\nwe're trying to prepare students to live in those\ncommunities.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The problem is that unlike\nstrategic siting, magnet schools, special resources,\nspecial programs in some schools, you're characterizing\neach student by reason of the color of his or her skin.\nThat is quite a different means. And it\nseems to me that that should only be, if ever allowed,\nallowed as a last resort.\nMR. MADDEN: The board here was trying to\ndistribute, sort out seats that were available at these\npopular schools; and so it devised a system whereby\nevery student had the opportunity to be assigned to at\nleast one of those popular schools; and as far as the\nrecord shows in plaintiffs' briefing, there's no\nmaterial differences between those -- those popular\nschools.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have quotas for, for\nracial hiring of your faculty in these schools?\nMR. MADDEN: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why not?\nMR. MADDEN: I don't think the board has\never found that necessary to, to achieve diversity in\nthe faculty.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Justice Kennedy's question,\nI think, was is this basically a kind of last report?\nOr how close to a has resort is it? What's the history\nof this? I thought the history involved a lawsuit to\ndesegregate the schools, a much more rigid system of\nracial -- abuse of race. Ultimately you come to this.\nNow you stop this. And what happened after you stopped\nit?\nMR. MADDEN: What happened is that, that it\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what is the history\nbasically? Am I right?\nMR. MADDEN: The history is that the board\nhad both narrowed the use of the integration tie breaker\nin '99 and 2000 and then continued it for the 2001\nschool year. We were -- in 2000-2001 school year, we\nwere enjoined in 2001 to use it in that year, which was\nconsiderably disruptive. But the board was also, the\nmeasures that it had implemented, implementing magnet\nschools at Rainier Beach and Chief South high schools in\nthe South End, implementing it in --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But that's not what I'm\nthinking.\nMR. MADDEN: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean I'm thinking that, I\nthought as I read this, and you have to correct me\nbecause you have a better knowledge, originally the\nschools were highly segregated in fact. People brought\na lawsuit. Then to stop that Seattle engaged in a plan\nthat really bused people around on the basis of race.\nThat led to white flight. That was bad for the schools.\nThey then tried a voluntary choice plan. This is part\nof that plan. Then when they abandon this plan, they\ndiscover more segregation. Is that basically right or\nnot?\nMR. MADDEN: When, when this plan has --\nthis -- the description is yes, basically right.\nWhen this plan was suspended in, after the\nCourt of Appeals enjoined it, the board had, as I said,\nexperienced some considerable disruption in the\nassignments because of the timing of the injunction.\nBut the board was also looking at the effect of the\nrace-neutral, if you will, program measures that it had\nimplemented.\nSuch that now, Ingram high school in the\nnorth end of Seattle is much more popular. Nathan Hale\nis no longer over-subscribed. There's less demand for\nBallard, but there have been --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you think your, do you\nthink your schools as they are operated now are\nsegregated?\nMR. MADDEN: We have some change of\nconditions, but the basic conditions remain, the trends\nhas not been positive. For example, and I think that\nthe petitioner picked --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: To say segregated,\nsegregated -- you refer to some of the schools as\nsegregated. And I, that's not what I understand by\nsegregated.\nMR. MADDEN: Not, not in the sense --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you know, if you\nbelong to a country club that, that -- that has 15\npercent black members, I would not consider that a\nsegregated country club. So what you are complaining\nabout is, is not segregation in any, in any reasonable\nsense of the word. You're complaining about a lack of\nracial balance.\nMR. MADDEN: We are not complaining about\nsegregation resulting from purposeful discrimination.\nThat's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's the only meaning of\nsegregation.\nMR. MADDEN: I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're talking about racial\nbalance.\nMR. MADDEN: Talking about schools that are\non the one end racially isolated. The Solicitor General\nmentioned two of those. And talking on the other end\nabout preserving the diversity that we had achieved\nthrough these years of effort in these north end\nschools.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I think you're also\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Justice Alito and Justice\nBreyer and I myself am interested: Can you tell us what\nhas happened since the plan's been enjoined?\nMR. MADDEN: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, have you gone back\nto square one? And it's just, there's no diversity at\nall? Or is there substantially more diversity? Can you\ntell us about that? Because it's important. It may\nmean that you don't need to identify students by the\ncolor of their skin in assignment.\nMR. MADDEN: It, it may mean the board\nconfronted with the circumstances might well make that\ndecision independent of this litigation. But let me\nanswer the specific.\nLet's take Franklin High School to begin\nwith. In, in 2000, that school was -- had 25 percent\nwhite enrollment. In 2005, it had 10 percent white\nenrollment. In the ninth grade, which is really the,\nthe level at which we see the effect of the segregation\ntie breaker, in 2000, the white enrollment was 21\npercent; it was 8 percent in 2005.\nGo to Ballard High School on the other end.\nBallard was 56 percent white students in 2000; it's 62\npercent in 2005. The ninth grade class has moved from\n46 percent white students to 58 percent white students.\nKeeping in mind that that school is now significantly\nless popular than it was, I think those effects would\nprobably be, be more extreme.\nBut the plan -- I want to emphasize, the\nplan was to try to disperse demand and to foster choices\nthat would result in diversity, not to compel it. We do\nnot --\nJUSTICE ALITO: How do, how do you square\nyour objective of achieving racial balance with your\ndisinterest in the situation at Cleveland and Rainier\nBeach? Those are the most unbalanced schools under your\ndefinition, and yet those are not affected at all by\nthis plan. Why, why are you not concerned about that?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, they are affected by\nthe plan in this in this way, that in the past the\ndistrict had used mandatory measures, busing students\nacross town, to try to integrate those schools. And the\nboard decided after many years of effort that it would\nno longer do that, but it was also of the firm\nconviction that it would allow students who wanted the\nopportunity to opt out of those schools to do so.\nAt the same time, it implemented magnet\nschools at Rainier Beach, there's a new building under\nconstruction at Cleveland. And so --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Are the students who are\nattending those schools getting the benefits of\nattending a school that's racially balanced? And if\nthey're not, why are you not concerned about that, if\nthat's an important objective of your program?\nMR. MADDEN: We, we are concerned about\nimproving the quality of education in all the schools.\nWe do not mandate that a student attend a school for\nintegration purposes as we once did.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why?\nMR. MADDEN: Because it, it's important to\nthe credibility and functionality of the school system\nto have a system that is accepted by the public, by our\nconstituents. And so people like choice; they also like\nneighborhood schools; they also like diverse schools.\nAnd the board recognized when it set about to develop\nthis plan that accommodating all of those values would\nrequire some trade-offs. And the board, familiar with\nthe local conditions, familiar with the history, did\njust that in what I submit was a narrowly tailored and\nappropriate way.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I go back to the\nCleveland school that Justice Alito mentioned? An I\ncorrect that there were 16 percent whites under the\nplan? And I'm just wondering what happened to it during\nthe last couple of years?\nMR. MADDEN: Cleveland is now about 8\npercent.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And it was -- about half\nas many whites as there were under the plan.\nMR. MADDEN: I don't remember the precise\nnumber in 2000, but that sounds about right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Madden, there was a\nquestion raised about your categories, that is, you have\nwhite and then everything else. And it was suggested\nthat if you are looking for diversity, what was -- the\nschools that you just mentioned had a large percentage\nof Asian-Americans, but they don't count.\nWhat is your response to that?\nMR. MADDEN: Well, the -- the problem that\nthe board was addressing was principally a, a problem of\nthe distribution of white and non-white students. The\n-- as a generality, 75 percent of all non-white students\nin the district lived in South Seattle. And that was\ntrue for all the ethnic groups except Native Americans,\nwho are a very small --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why is that a problem?\nSuppose you have a school in which 60 percent of the\nstudents are either of Asian ancestry or Latino\nancestry, and 40 percent are white as you classify\npeople. And there are no African-American students at\nall. You would consider that to be a racially balanced\nschool, would you not?\nMR. MADDEN: I would say if that\ncircumstance occurred, that that would be something that\nthe board would have to pay attention to and consider.\nBut the fact of the matter is that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Nothing under the\nplan requires that, does it?\nMR. MADDEN: No, because the numbers in\nterms of the distribution of ethnic groups, separate\nethnic groups and the benefits or impacts of the plan\nwere spread proportionately --\nJUSTICE ALITO: And what is the theory\nbehind that? Is, the theory is it that the white\nstudents there or the Asian students or the Latino\nstudents would not benefit from having African-American\nclassmates? It is enough if they have either Asian\nclassmates or Latino classmates or white classmates?\nHow do you -- how do square that with your, your\nobjective of providing benefits that flow from racial\nbalance?\nMR. MADDEN: I may, I may have confused the\nanswer to the hypothetical with the, with rationale on\nthe ground, which was that we did not have that kind of\nsingle minority ethnic group disparity existing in any\nschool. I was saying, however, that if that existed, I\nthink that would be something the board would have to be\nmindful of. As a practical matter, because our\nnon-white ethnic neighborhoods in South Seattle are\nthemselves quite integrated, that the movement under\nthis plan did not produce disparities for or against any\nparticular ethnic group. And so I think in the end it\nmight have been more divisive to have individual\ntiebreakers for the separate minority ethnic groups.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What criteria of race does\nthe school, just out of curiosity, does the school\ndistrict use? I mean, what if a particular child's\ngrandfather was white? Would he qualify as a white or\nnon-white.\nMR. MADDEN: I would say -- well, the answer\nis --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, there must be some\ncriterion. There are many people of mixed blood.\nMR. MADDEN: The district has no criteria\nitself. The district uses classifications that are\ndeveloped by the Federal Government but allows parents\nto self identify children.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It allows parents to say\nI'm white, no matter what?\nMR. MADDEN: That allows the parents to self\nidentify, and the record in this case through the\ntestimony of petitioner's president is they were aware\nof no abuse of that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Seems like a big loophole.\nMR. MADDEN: It seems like one but according\nto the record, it's not an issue. I'd like to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't defend the\nchoice policy on the basis that the schools offer\neducation to everyone of the same quality, do you?\nMR. MADDEN: Oh, yes. Yes. They offer --\nthe popular schools to which everyone had access under\nthis plan who wanted access, I think it's -- there is no\ndispute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is that\ndifferent from the separate but equal argument? In\nother words, it doesn't matter that they're being\nassigned on the basis of their race because they're\ngetting the same type of education.\nMR. MADDEN: Well, because the schools are\nnot racially separate. The goal is to maintain the\ndiversity that existed within a broad range in order to\ntry to obtain the benefits that the educational research\nshow flow from an integrated education.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though in the\nindividual cases the students, including minority\nstudents, and I gather 89 to 100 of the cases are being\ndenied admission on the basis of their race?\nMR. MADDEN: They're not being denied\nadmission. They're being -- seats are being distributed\nto them. This is not like --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They are being\ndenied admission to the school of their choice?\nMR. MADDEN: Yes. But this is not like\nbeing denied admission to a state's flagship university.\nI think for that proposition, I would cite Justice\nPowell's opinion in the Bakke case where he was at some\npains to point out that a school integration plan is\nwholly dissimilar to a selective university admissions\nplan.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If we look at the things\nthat Parents are concerned about when they're\nconsidering where their children are going to high\nschool, we look at things like SAT scores, for example,\nor performance on statewide tests, would we see that,\nthe oversubscribed schools and the undersubscribed\nschools have similar test scores?\nMR. MADDEN: It depends on what school\nyou're talking about, Justice Alito. In this case, I\nthink the most important point to start with is that\nthere was no contention that there was any material\ndifference in quality between the five popular high\nschools.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if we looked at\nGarfield and Cleveland, what would we find?\nMR. MADDEN: You would find a reasonable\nbasis to perceive a quality difference between those two\nschools, but this plan didn't assign any students to\nCleveland.\nI want to take a moment, if I can, to turn\nto the issue of individualized consideration, because so\nmuch emphasis has been placed on it in the earlier\ndiscussion.\nIt seems to us, first of all, that this\nCourt in Grutter said that not all uses of race trigger\nthe same objections and that the Court must be mindful\nof the context. This is not, as I've said, a selective\nor merit-based system where we adjudge one student to be\nbetter than the other. We do consider individual\nfactors before we get to race, starting with choice and\nfamily connection, and how close you live to the school.\nBut ultimately, this is a distributive\nsystem which, as Justice Powell -- as I noted, Justice\nPowell said in the Bakke case, is quite wholly\ndissimilar to a merit or selective-based system. What\nit seems to us is being suggested by the United States\nand by the petitioner is a system that would force an\nindividualized merit-based review on any kind of race\nconscious program, specifically an assignment to public\nschools.\nThat rule allows the means to define the\nends; and it ends up, I think, defeating the purpose\nthat the Court had of not stigmatizing --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the reason that\nour prior tests have focused on individual determination\nis that the purpose of the Equal Protection Clause is to\nensure that people are treated as individuals rather\nthan based on the color of their skin. So saying that\nthis doesn't involve individualized determinations\nsimply highlights the fact that the decision to\ndistribute, as you put it, was based on skin color and\nnot any other factor.\nMR. MADDEN: Mr. Chief Justice, in Grutter\nyou said specifically that individualized review was\nrequired in the context of university admissions. In\nthis context, the kind of review, the specific kind of\nreview that I understand the United States to urge and\nthe petitioner to urge, serves no purpose, and it may\nitself be stigmatizing in the context of public schools\nwhere everyone gets a seat.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You're saying that\nindividual treatment makes no sense in terms of the\nobjective here. I thought that's what you were saying.\nMR. MADDEN: Justice Ginsburg, that is\ncorrect. I am saying, however, that this plan,\nconsistent with narrow tailoring, provided consideration\nof individual circumstances, including an appeal on\nhardship grounds for someone who felt that they had been\ndenied a school that they needed to be in.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the emphasis on the\nfact that everybody gets into a school, it seems to me\nis misplaced, but the question is whether or not you can\nget into the school that you really prefer. And that in\nsome cases depends solely on skin color. You know, it's\nlike saying everybody can have a meal but only people\nwith separate skin can get the dessert.\nMR. MADDEN: Well, like the Michigan cases,\nsometimes student in the end of the day have an\nassignment determined by race. Just like in the\nuniversity cases, at some point race will be a tipping\nfactor. It's different, though, when we put someone in\na basically comparable school.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you're saying\nevery -- I mean, everyone got a seat in Brown as well;\nbut because they were assigned to those seats on the\nbasis of race, it violated equal protection. How is\nyour argument that there's no problem here because\neverybody gets a seat distinguishable?\nMR. MADDEN: Because segregation is harmful.\nIntegration, this Court has recognized in Swann, in the\nfirst Seattle case, has benefits. The district was --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it seems to me you're\nsaying you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs.\nCan you think of any area of the law in which we say\nwhatever it takes, so long as there's a real need,\nwhatever it takes -- I mean, if we have a lot of crime\nout there and the only way to get rid of it is to use\nwarrantless searches, you know, fudge on some of the\nprotections of the Bill of Rights, whatever it takes,\nwe've got to do it?\nIs there any area of the law that doesn't\nhave some absolute restrictions?\nMR. MADDEN: There are many areas of the\nlaw, certainly in the First Amendment and the Fourth\nAmendment, that have considerable flexibility.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But what about the\nFourteenth? I thought that was one of the absolute\nrestrictions, that you cannot judge and classify people\non the basis of their race. You can pursue the\nobjectives that your school board is pursuing, but at\nsome point you come against an absolute, and aren't you\njust denying that?\nMR. MADDEN: I think that in Grutter and\nGratz, this Court rejected the absolute and instead\ndescribed discretely, which we feel we need, and which\nis why we are not urging an absolute position. We say\nthat we indeed comply with the requirements of narrow\ntailoring, and that the plan therefore should be upheld.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the question of\nintegration, whether there was any use of a racial\ncriterion, whether integration, using racial integration\nis the same as segregation, it seems to me is pretty far\nfrom the kind of headlines that attended the Brown\ndecision. They were, at last, white and black children\ntogether on the same school bench. That seems to be\nworlds apart from saying we'll separate them.\nMR. MADDEN: We certainly agree,\nJustice Ginsburg. We'd go one step further and note\nthat in Brown, this Court said that the effects of\nsegregated schools are worse.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's no effort\nhere on the part of the school to separate students on\nthe basis of race. It's an assignment on the basis of\nrace, correct?\nMR. MADDEN: And it is in effect to bring\nstudents together in a mix that is not too far from\ntheir community.\nI see that my time has expired. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Madden.\nMr. Korrell, you have four minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY J.F. KORRELL\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. KORRELL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nThere were some questions of my friend Mr. Madden about\nthe record and the statistics about enrollment, and I'd\nlike to draw the Court's attention, particularly\nJustice Breyer and Justice Stevens' questions about what\nthe schools look like now.\nIf the Court looks at pages 6 and 7 of our\nreply brief, we provided the enrollment data. The\ninformation on page 7 comes from the school district\nwebsite that provides enrollment data at the individual\nschools. In 2005 and 2006, enrollment at the\noversubscribed schools is now 54 percent non-white,\nwhich is greater than it was under the district's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: This is the -- as I gather,\nthe plan where race is used, has to do only with the\nninth grade. And therefore, what you would like to note\nis when you look at the ninth grade after they stopped\nusing any racial criteria at all, what happened to those\nninth grade classes. Did they become more heavily\nseparated or did they retain their diversity? Are the\nnumbers that you are about to read us, which I have in\nfront of me, going to do that? Tell us that? I think\nthey're about the whole school.\nMR. KORRELL: They are, Your Honor, but\nthey're about the whole school after four years of\noperating without the race preference. So each of the\nfour years they're represented in the aggregate shows\nthe effect that I think Your Honor was asking about.\nSo, the record in this case shows the\nSeattle schools are richly diverse. It's very important\nin our view that the Court not lose site of that. We've\ntalked about integration and segregation, but I urge the\nCourt to take a look at the data the petitioners submit\nregarding the actual enrollment in those schools.\nA couple of other record citations I'd like\nto bring to the Court's attention. Justice Kennedy, I\nthink, asked about considering race at a last resort.\nIt's simply not the case that the school district looked\nat race as a last resort. And I would draw the Court's\nattention to the superintendent's testimony at joint\nappendix 224 and 25, where he said in essence, the\nreason we didn't consider race neutral plans is because\nwe were interested in racial diversity.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The numbers I have here,\nFranklin went from 25 percent white to 12.7 percent.\nRoosevelt, which was basically a white school, jumped up\nfrom about 51 to 59. Ballard jumped up from about 56 to\n62. Then Garfield went down some, more mixed. But\nthose were the worst ones; am I right on that?\nMR. KORRELL: Your Honor, I think the\nnumbers that you're reading are from the difference\nbetween the 2000 and -- '99 and the 2000 enrollments.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMR. KORRELL: The numbers I was trying to\nbring to the Court's attention were the difference\nbetween the enrollment under the race-based plan and the\nenrollment in 2005 and 2006, which shows significant and\ncontinued racial diversity in Seattle's high schools.\nCounsel suggested also that there is no\nmaterial difference among the five oversubscribed\nschools. And I would draw the Court's attention to the\ntestimony of the board president at joint appendix 261\nto 274, where she discusses in detail the programmatic\ndifferences. It is true that those five schools were\noversubscribed and they were popular, but they all\nprovide unique programs, some of which as we indicated\nin our briefs, required children to meet certain\nprerequisites to be able to attend.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was the board\nsimultaneously trying to introduce similar programs or\nattractive programs in the undersubscribed schools?\nMR. KORRELL: Your Honor, I'm perhaps not\nthe best person to answer that. I believe the board has\nbeen trying to introduce programs at all of its schools\nthat would make each school unique, and I think that\nincludes the undersubscribed schools as well.\nJustice Breyer asked a question about the --\nabout the process of this litigation, and my\nunderstanding is there was never a lawsuit against\nSeattle to compel desegregation, that they were always\nfollowing a plan.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
