BLACKMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. BLACKMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nJ.D.B. was only 13 years old when he was\ntaken out of his middle school classroom and escorted to\na closed door interrogation conducted by outside law\nenforcement regarding a matter that did not take place\non school property. He was isolated from his family who\nhad already demonstrated an interest in this\ninvestigation and sought to shield him from the police.\nHe was not advised that he was free to leave or free not\nto answer questions until he had already incriminated\nhimself.\nThe restrictions on J.D.B.'s freedom of\nmovement which existed because of his youth were\nheightened by the manner in which this officer chose to\nconduct this interrogation and the expected deference to\nauthority figures categorically characteristic of\nchildren were taken advantage of by the manner in which\nthis officer chose to conduct the interrogation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Blackman, I'm -- I'm --\nI'm not clear on what you are proposing. Is there to be\none different Miranda requirement rule for all minors,\nor is there to be one for, what, 20-year-olds,\n19-year-olds, 18-year-olds, 17, 16? This one is 13, do\nwe calibrate it that finely -\nMS. BLACKMAN: Justice -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- or do we just say, you\nknow, what would a minor -- I don't know, a general\nminor regard as restrictions upon his departure?\nMS. BLACKMAN: Justice Scalia, what we are\nproposing is that the test be a court may consider age\nin determining whether a reasonable person in the\njuvenile -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that.\nMS. BLACKMAN: So we are not -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you mean 15, 14, 13,\n13 1/2? Right?\nMS. BLACKMAN: We did not suggest that it be\ncalibrated by age, although in State court jurisdictions\nmany of them are and are not finding that a difficult\ntest to perform.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not -- if not\ncalibrated by age, how is it to be calibrated?\nMS. BLACKMAN: It is to be the exercise of\nreasonable judgment by the judge taking into account\ncommon sense -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Common sense?\nMS. BLACKMAN: -- community experience is\none.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and -- and how -\nhow is the law enforcement officer going into the\nconfrontation going to know whether a judge is going to\nbe applying a 15-year-old rule, a 13-year-old rule, or\nwhatever?\nMS. BLACKMAN: Clearly in the jurisdiction\nin which he practices he should be aware of the fact\nthat a court utilizes that type of -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think that's clear?\nMS. BLACKMAN: But we're not suggesting that\nthat be done. What a court is examining is -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why isn't this all\nsubsumed under the voluntariness rule?\nMS. BLACKMAN: As this Court has frequently\nrecognized, the voluntariness inquiry is more difficult\nfor courts to perform than the Miranda custody one. And\nyou have also recognized that the court -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, at least it's the\ncourt performing it, not the interrogating officer, as\nJustice Scalia's questions point out.\nMS. BLACKMAN: The police officer plays a\nrole in the voluntariness, also. And the police officer\nmust be assessing whether the circumstances may be\ngiving rise to an involuntary confession. Age -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about mental\ndeficiency, if -- if age should be one of the factors,\ndeciding whether the individual regarded himself as in\ncustody or not, why shouldn't mental deficiency be so as\nwell? Is there any -- any basis in principle for not --\nI mean, once you do this, don't you, in effect, say that\nit is a subjective inquiry whether the particular\nindividual regarded him or herself as being in custody;\nisn't that the -- the basis of what you're arguing?\nMS. BLACKMAN: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No? Why is age different\nfrom mental deficiency, for example?\nMS. BLACKMAN: Age is different because,\nnumber one, it involves restrictions on freedom of\nmovement, so the circumstances of the interrogation are\ngoing to be understood and interpreted differently by a\nchild than it would be by an adult.\nSecondly, we're talking about cognitive\ndifferences which exist between children and adults\nwhich affects their perception and understanding.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You could say both of those\nthings about the mentally deficient. They may regard\nthemselves as -- as unfree to leave, and they have\ncognitive deficiencies.\nMS. BLACKMAN: As far as I know, there\nhasn't been the recognition in the law that there is, as\nto children, that proves such as the mentally\nhandicapped are unable to -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what about this test\nwhich comes from three cases, the first being Berkemer,\nthe second Stansbury, and the third I'll tell you in a\nsecond? It is that those -- what are -- in considering\na reasonable person for this purpose and avoiding\nsubjective states of mind, you would look at objective\ncircumstances, known to both the officer and the suspect\nthat are likely relevant to the way a person would\nunderstand his situation. All right?\nSo both would be both mental illness and age\nand -- I don't know, whether you speak English, and a\nlot of other things would be relevant, provided they are\nthings that are relevant to how a person would\nunderstand his situation and are known to both the\nofficer and the individual.\nThe third case, of course, is my dissent in\nAlvarez.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: But nothing in the majority\nconflicts with that, that I can see, except the holding.\nI thought I lost the case, but apparently it's up again,\nso I don't see why that isn't a perfectly good test.\nBut if you're not going to support it, then I've got no\nsupport.\nMS. BLACKMAN: Well, we're simply making the\npoint that there's not necessarily going to be a\nfloodgate opening. And we haven't seen that -\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, but I mean what\nJustice Scalia was really asking is, do you favor\nsomething like this test that I read, which is open as\nto circumstance? Anything could fit in that blank, as\nlong as both policemen and the -- and the individual\nknow it and it is relevant as to how he understands the\ncircumstance, whether he's likely free to go or not.\nMS. BLACKMAN: Conceptually absolutely.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Thank you. Yes, that's\nright.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even -- even if you said\nno, you're pushing us there, because there's no basis\nfor treating a childhood any differently from these\nother factors. So basically you're saying Justice\nBreyer would call it objective circumstances. You know,\nwhether you're mentally deficient, I would call that the\nsubjective condition of the -- of the person being held\nin custody. And I think, I don't think that's what we\nmeant by the phrase \"objective circumstances.\"\nBut you want objective circumstances to\ninclude the character of the person being held in\ncustody, whether he's mentally deficient, whether he's\nschizophrenic, known to the police, you know, whatever\nfactors, right? Those are all objective circumstances?\nMS. BLACKMAN: Your Honor, what we are\ntalking about are a complex of characteristics which are\nunique to children, and that's what we are examining in\nthis case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Blackman, what is\ncomplex about a juvenile investigator? That's what this\npolice officer was. So he's investigating a juvenile\nfor juvenile justice purposes, and I think there's\nhardly anything more objective than that. This case has\nchild written all over it. It's investigator who deals\nwith children. The first proceedings is going to be a\njuvenile proceeding.\nHow can you not take that into account,\nwhatever -- whatever these other factors may involve?\nBut here it seems to me so rampant because this police\nofficer dealt only with juveniles, and he investigated\njuveniles.\nMS. BLACKMAN: I agree completely. This\nofficer was assigned the case because it had already\nbeen determined that a juvenile was involved. This is\nthe population that he deals with on a daily basis. He\ncertainly has a basis on which to assess how J.D.B.'s\nyouth was factoring into this interrogation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And then is it your point\nthat he has to do something more than the read the\nstandard Miranda warning? Suppose he read the standard\nMiranda warning? End of case as far as you're\nconcerned?\nMS. BLACKMAN: Obviously his age would\nfactor into whether there was a valid waiver. But, yes,\nhe has got to Mirandize or otherwise J.D.B. -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but doesn't it\nfollow from there that we have to have a -- we have to\nchange the warning?\nMS. BLACKMAN: Not necessarily. I mean,\nsome children will not understand Miranda warnings, just\nas some adults don't understand Miranda warnings. But\nchildren are nonetheless -- have to be given the\nopportunity to be told of their rights, so that they can\nat least have the opportunity to make an informed\ndecision.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Are you asking trial judges\nto make -- to do something that is realistic? Do you\nthink -- let's take a hypothetical trial judge who,\nlet's say, is 60 years old and has an IQ of -- that's at\nleast an average IQ. And now you're asking this trial\njudge to decide whether under particular circumstances,\nlet's say, a 14-year-old with an IQ of 85 would\nappreciate under particular circumstances that he or she\nwas free to leave?\nMS. BLACKMAN: Your Honor -\nJUSTICE ALITO: You think a trial judge can\nreally do that?\nMS. BLACKMAN: State courts have been\nperforming this analysis now for several decades, and\nthey haven't indicated that they have difficulty doing\nso. And to the extent that your -\nJUSTICE ALITO: They must have greater\nimaginative powers then.\nMS. BLACKMAN: What?\nJUSTICE ALITO: They must have greater\nimaginative powers than I think I would have under those\ncircumstances.\nMS. BLACKMAN: Part of your question -\nJUSTICE ALITO: When you take a particular\nset of circumstances, and the judge would say, if I were\n13, I would not understand that I could go. However, if\nI were 15, I would understand I could go.\nMS. BLACKMAN: Your Honor -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Can you slice it like that?\nMS. BLACKMAN: What we are talking about\nhere is relative youngness and relative oldness. I\nmean, the empirical data demonstrates to us that the\nolder a child is to an adult, the more adult-like they\nare. The younger, the farther away they are from that\nadult standard -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We need empirical data for\nthat?\nMS. BLACKMAN: Excuse me?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We need empirical data for\nthat?\nMS. BLACKMAN: Empirical data does exist.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: To show that -\nMS. BLACKMAN: I'm simply pointing that out.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- the closer to adulthood\na child is, the more like an adult he is?\n(Laughter.)\nMS. BLACKMAN: I'm simply pointing out that\nthe empirical data supports that. There are bases of\nknowledge from which -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Do we need either\nimaginative powers or empirical data to know that when a\n13-year-old is brought into a room in his school, taken\nout of class, four people are there, two are police\nofficers, one is assistant principal, threatened with\ncustody, that that person is not going to feel free to\ntake off and leave?\nMS. BLACKMAN: We do not. I'm simply\npointing out that there is a basis of knowledge from\nwhich courts as well as police officers can make the\nrequired assessment. It is so clear in this case,\nhowever -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, sympathetic cases can\nmake bad law. So take the same set of facts and let's\nhypothesize that this is a 15-year-old. Would the\n15-year-old appreciate that he could go? Or make him\n16. Or make him a street-wise 17-year-old.\nMS. BLACKMAN: A judge should be able to\nconsider that, and under the clear circumstances of this\ncase, it is unlikely that a -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: When the policeman sees\nhim, he's dressed in baggy jeans, you know, down around\nhis thighs, and when the judge sees him he's wearing a\nBuster Brown jumper suit. You don't really think that\nit's going to be equivalent?\nMS. BLACKMAN: I'm not sure I understood the\nquestion.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The whole point -\nMS. BLACKMAN: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The whole point of\nthe Miranda rule, I thought, was to provide clear,\nobjective guidelines about what the police are supposed\nto do. And it seems to me that one of the difficulties\nwith your rule, however clear it may seem in this case,\nbut it does have to apply more broadly, is that that's\noff the table, and now they're not only going to have to\nknow, does this person understand it, but they're going\nto have to know, it's not every one of these situations\nthat's going to be in school. They're going to have to\nguess how old the person is.\nAnd there are differences. Some\n15-year-olds know a lot more than some 17-year-olds, and\nso on. And -- and the facts that you're concerned about\nall go into the voluntariness inquiry, which is still\npertinent after Miranda. Why don't we just put those\nfacts into that inquiry and say, look, we've got one\nstrict rule; everybody knows it, you hear it on TV all\nthe time, people are given Miranda warnings; that part\nof it is done?\nMS. BLACKMAN: It doesn't change the rule\nitself. I mean, the rule itself remains: All objective\ncircumstances relevant to the custody determination must\nbe considered.\nWhat it's doing is taking this out of the\nreasonable adult standard, which by default is the only\none, then, that can be used, and so it's not going to be\nmuddying the waters in the sense that it is something\nneeded in order to promote accurate fact-finding.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would it be -- is it\nenough if the officers in this situation said, look,\nyou're free to leave, you know, whenever you want,\nbut -- and then goes on -- or do they have to think -\nnow, maybe -- maybe a 13-year-old really doesn't think\nthat's true, or maybe a 13-year-old really doesn't feel\nthat he can leave if he's got the vice principal there\nand they want to talk.\nMS. BLACKMAN: I mean, that is an objective\ncircumstance that occurs in the course of an\ninterrogation which is very weighty in determining if\ncustody occurs. Here -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm thinking it\nwould not even be enough if they told the 13-year-old,\nlook, you can leave, but I want to ask you some\nquestions. And the principal is there, and he thinks,\nwell, you know -- maybe the 13-year-old is thinking,\nmaybe I'm going to get in trouble if I leave.\nMS. BLACKMAN: It involves all of the\ncircumstances which are arising during the course of\nthese interrogations, but certainly advising someone\nthat they are free to leave and advising them that they\nare free not to answer questions is almost half of the\nMiranda warning, and it is giving the child -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if the parent tells\nthem not to leave? What if the parent says, you go and\ntalk to this police officer? If you did something\nwrong, I want them to know about it; talk to the\nofficer.\nMS. BLACKMAN: Whether that would factor in\ndepends, I think, upon whether they're acting as an\nagent of the police, because what we're looking at is -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, no. They're not an\nagent; they're acting as a parent.\nMS. BLACKMAN: Oh. What we're examining is\nwhether we've got a police-dominated environment and\ncoercion in the situation and circumstances under which\nthe child evaluates the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are you answering my\nquestion?\nMS. BLACKMAN: No, I'm not. Obviously, the\nspecific factors that occur in the course of any\ninterrogation will be considered, but our focus here is\nupon what the police officer must do.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would be one relevant\nfactor that would be considered was that nobody called\nthe parents?\nMS. BLACKMAN: It is relevant in this\nsituation, because -- by North Carolina law. Because a\ncustodial interrogation was occurring, there was a\nrequirement that a parent or guardian be present.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is that relevant\nto the Miranda inquiry? It might be relevant to the\nvoluntariness inquiry, but I don't see whether you call\nthe parents or not. Part of his Miranda -- your Miranda\nright is not to have your parents called.\nMS. BLACKMAN: What I understood the\nquestion was: Was it relevant that a parent was not\ncontacted? In this particular situation, yes, because\nthat was going to create an independent basis on which\nthe statement wasn't going to be admitted, and is than\nadditional reason why -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Independent of what?\nMS. BLACKMAN: Independent of Miranda.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, right. That's\nmy whole point.\nMS. BLACKMAN: But that is an additional\nreason why police officers need to be aware of what the\nage is of a child that they are interrogating because of\nindependent obligations arising out of State statutes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So is your answer to\nJustice Ginsburg that, no, the fact that a parent was\nnot notified is not relevant to the Miranda question?\nIt may be relevant to the voluntariness question.\nMS. BLACKMAN: No, I believe it remains\nrelevant to the Miranda question, because -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The question really is if\nhe is in custody. And maybe there's something different\nabout being in the room with a juvenile police\ninvestigator and the assistant principal and being in\nthat same room with your parents there.\nMS. BLACKMAN: That is correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, so it's not just\nthat they have to call the parent; they have to wait for\nthe parent to show up?\nMS. BLACKMAN: Because of State statutory\nrequirements, here they were. Obviously, not every\nState has that kind of requirement. In this particular\nsituation, there was a requirement of parental presence.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not -- that's\nnot pertinent to the Federal law question on the Miranda\nwarnings.\nMS. BLACKMAN: I understand that, but I'm\njust explaining that independent bases may arise for\nwhich an officer has to be aware of the age. And given\nthat, we're not imposing additional burdens. These are\nthings that police officers have to be considering.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if the age of the\nperson being questioned is unclear?\nMS. BLACKMAN: If the interrogation is\noccurring under circumstances where the officer should\nhave known, then I think the burden remains with the\nofficer to consider this, and that could arise from -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Suppose -- suppose the\nperson shows an ID and it shows the person is 19 years\nold, and the officer looks at him and says, he looks\nlike a pretty young 19-year-old?\nMS. BLACKMAN: If there is no way to verify\nthe information that the child is giving, then the\nofficer accepts the ID as being the age of the person he\nis interrogating.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if -- I mean, under my\nexample, what if the child -- what if the person looks\nlike a minor but has an adult ID?\nMS. BLACKMAN: I think that if -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Does the officer have an\nobligation to look behind that?\nMS. BLACKMAN: Um -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Or the other way around?\nThe person says, I'm 15, and the officer sees that this\nperson has a pretty heavy beard and -\nMS. BLACKMAN: The officer has to proceed on\nthe basis of his observations. I mean, objective\ncircumstances are things that are readily apparent.\nThere can be circumstances which tell the officer that,\nin fact, he is dealing with a child, either the setting,\nthe appearance, the contact of parents, and so on.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is there a good faith -\nMS. BLACKMAN: But if there -- if there is\nno reasonable basis upon which the officer could discern\nthat this is a child, if he has no reason to know, then\nthe rule that we are asking to be put into effect would\nnot apply.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does a good faith mistake\nmake it okay? If, you know, the officer, in good faith,\nbelieves that it's not a minor and -- and proceeds\naccordingly?\nMS. BLACKMAN: Yes. I mean, what we would\nbe assessing is: Are the circumstances clear such that\nthe officer should have known? And if they simply could\nnot ascertain it, then the rule that we're asking for\nwould not apply.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The way you phrase the\nquestion, you say, may the trial -- whether trial courts\nmay consider the juvenile's age in Miranda to make the\nin-custody Miranda determination.\nDid you really mean \"may,\" so it's\ndiscretionary with each judge, whether a juvenile's age\nis relevant to the in-custody analysis?\nMS. BLACKMAN: No, it is must. As with any\nobjective circumstance, the court has to take it into\naccount, and we can't be relegating some to a\ndiscretionary review and others to mandatory review.\nSo, yes, if a child is involved in the case, then a\ncourt must take that into account -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So -\nMS. BLACKMAN: -- in determining if there's\ncustody.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- are you saying, going\nback to the hypotheticals that some of my colleagues\nposed, police officer comes across an individual, looks\nolder or looks younger, doesn't know, and just engages\nthat person and says come over here and let's talk for a\nsecond. Is the officer required to ask the age?\nMS. BLACKMAN: It's a simple enough matter,\nbut no. But I think if the person -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So if they're not\nrequired -\nMS. BLACKMAN: -- as a Terry stop, where\nMiranda is not coming into play at all -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Perhaps not, but it's -\nif it's outside a school, school corner. No reasonable\nsuspicion, just says come over here, kid. Is he\nsupposed to ask the age to see if he's 19 or 18 or 17?\nMS. BLACKMAN: We're not in a custodial\ninterrogation setting, I think in your question, and so\nMiranda is not coming into play at all, but I mean, this\nis a matter -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It is, because it's a\nstop with no reasonable suspicion. And the kid comes\nover, and the officer stands him there and continues to\ntalk to him for half an hour.\nMS. BLACKMAN: If there is a custodial -- if\nwe have restraint on freedom of movement which is rising\nto the degree of a formal arrest, it's a simple enough\nmatter to ask.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why don't we go back\nto the test that Justice Breyer suggested, which would\nanswer many of the hypotheticals here, that the\nobjective fact is what is known to both?\nMS. BLACKMAN: What is known to both.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That way you don't get\ninto what the 13-year-old is thinking inside himself or\nnot, because that then becomes subjective; you don't go\nback to what others might think are special\ncharacteristics or subjective characteristics. You go\nto what's known, what's an objective factor known to\nboth.\nMS. BLACKMAN: Yes. But I think that we\ncan't be encouraging willful blindness, either; and so,\nyou know, if an officer encounters someone at a facility\nwhere only children would be, for example, like an\nelementary school or a juvenile detention facility -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I think that's clear,\nbut that's different. I mean, you can tell the\ndifference between a 9-year-old, I think, and an adult\ngenerally.\nMS. BLACKMAN: Indeed.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And I'm hard pressed to\nthink that anyone would believe that if you took a\n9-year-old out of his classroom and the assistant\nprincipal walked him into a room and said these guys\nwant to talk to you, that that 9-year-old would think\nhe's free to leave.\nMS. BLACKMAN: I agree.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Right. So objectively\nthat's a fact known to everyone, that it's a 9-year-old.\nMS. BLACKMAN: Correct. Correct. I did -\nthere have been a lot of questions that sort of\npresupposed that we are doing a subjective inquiry, and\nI think nothing could be farther from the case. What we\nare not doing -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I guess part of my problem\nis it's just in some respects hard to put the Miranda in\nthe context of a -- let's say a 13-year-old alone. It\nmay be that Miranda warnings, \"You have a right to\nremain silent, anything you say can be used against you\"\n-- might terrify the kid just to hear about it. I'm\njust wondering how the Miranda warning works here\nanyway. The school is in loco parentis, it has certain\n-- it has obligations and privileges with respect to the\nstudent.\nMS. BLACKMAN: Well, Miranda is the only\nprocedure to date that anyone uses, and constitutionally\nthey are -- everyone is entitled to some advisement so\nthat they can make an informed choice. I mean, whether\nthere should be a more simplified or different Miranda\nwarning for children is an issue for another day, but we\ncan't simply say we're not going to do anything. We are\nnot going to tell these children that they don't have to\ncooperate with the State in building a case against\nthemselves.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could I go back to an\nearlier question? Is it your argument that age is the\nonly objective individual characteristic of the person\nbeing questioned that must be taken into account, or are\nthere other objective characteristics of people being\nquestioned who -- that fall into the same category?\nMS. BLACKMAN: I think that one's status as\nan inmate, for example, can be characterized as\nobjective, and certainly that has been taken into\naccount because inmates share that same baseline\nrestriction on freedom of movement that children do, and\nso this court in -- Shafter -- for example,\ncharacterized it as what would the reasonable person in\nthe inmate's position have understood as to his freedom\nof movement. So, yes, I mean, there can be other\nobjective circumstances individual to the person, but\nwe're still not answering a subjective -\nJUSTICE ALITO: But what are they? I don't\nwant to use up your rebuttal time, but what -- what are\nthey in addition to age? For people who are not\ninstitutionalized or in school or in an environment like\nthat? What falls into the same category as age?\nMS. BLACKMAN: I think that's for other\nlitigants to press upon this Court upon proper records\nwith input from experts as to whether it relates to the\nspecial susceptibilities of children, how cognitively\ndifferent they are which is affecting their perception\nand judgment of what's going on about them, and those\nare questions for another day.\nIf there are no other questions, I would\nlike to reserve my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nGeneral Cooper.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ROY COOPER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. COOPER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn determining custody for Miranda purposes,\nthis Court has considered only the external surrounding\ncircumstances of the question and not the attributes\nthat affect the mental processes of the person being\nquestioned. Age fundamentally changes the reasonable\nperson test, makes it complex, makes it more illogical,\nwith no logical stopping point for adding other\ncharacteristics, as Justice Breyer -\nJUSTICE BREYER: You would add none? No\nothers? No other characteristics?\nMR. COOPER: This Court has not said -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I mean here.\nMR. COOPER: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There's a big sign jail\ncell, the door is unlocked. When you want to leave,\nleave. Is he in custody?\nMR. COOPER: Well, Your Honor, I think you\nhave to look at the obvious circumstances.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is he in custody? It's a\njail cell, but a big sign, \"Go ahead, leave, go when you\nwant.\" Is he free to leave?\nMR. COOPER: I think he may be, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, so do I.\nMR. COOPER: If that's how you want -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'll just tell you one\nother circumstance.\nMR. COOPER: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: He only speaks Spanish.\nMR. COOPER: Well, Your Honor, I think it\naffects -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Ukrainian is the only thing\nhe speaks. Now are you willing to take that into\naccount?\nMR. COOPER: Your Honor, I am willing to\ntake that into account.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Thank you. Now, I'll say\nanother fact. Exactly the same, except there are very\nsteep steps and he's in a wheelchair. Are you willing\nto take that into account?\nMR. COOPER: I am willing to take that into\naccount.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Then why aren't you\nwilling to take into account an ambiguous situation as\nwas true in Alvarado, a tough situation where it's\npretty unclear; he was brought there by his parents and\nthere are all these things around that might suggest to\na 20-year-old, yeah, you could leave, but to a\n12-year-old, \"no.\" If the judge can take into account\nwhether he's in a wheelchair, whether he just speaks\nUkrainian, whether in fact a thing -- you have to swim\nthrough a pool and he doesn't know how to swim -- I\nmean, all kinds of things like that; why can't he take\ninto account in a proper situation before he thinks he's\nin custody or not, things they both know including\nwhether he's 8 years old or 22?\nMR. COOPER: Your Honor, because those are\nobvious circumstances that everyone agrees -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And it's obvious whether\nhe's 8-year-old or 2 2, too. I'll tell you that.\nMR. COOPER: The problem is, Your Honor, you\nhave to think like an 8-year-old or think like a\n15-year-old in order to determine the situation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right. And you have to\nthink like a Ukrainian speaker or think like a -- a -- a\n-- like a person who knows he's in a wheelchair before\nyou know he can't get up those steep steps.\nMR. COOPER: I think the difference -\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is exactly the -- the\ndifference?\nMR. COOPER: The difference is with the\nUkrainian is that you look at whether the knowledge was\nactually acquired. And if he speaks Ukrainian, then\neveryone knows that the -- that the knowledge was not\nacquired. People understand that someone who has a\nseeing eye dog, if you take him out of the room, then\nyou have exerted coercion over the situation. I think\nthat's different from requiring the officer to get into\nthe mind of the reasonable 15-year-old or 16-year-old.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I haven't said that. What\nthe opinion said, which unfortunately may mean nothing\nunless it's promoted to the status of majority, is you\nlook to those factors that are relevant to, known to\nboth policeman and the suspect, and are known to be\nrelevant to the likelihood that a person -- a likely\nperson, not him -- that are known likely relevant to an\nordinary person's belief -- this kind of a person -\nthat he thinks he's free to go.\nMR. COOPER: I think -\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's all. What's wrong\nwith that?\nMR. COOPER: I think that's right, Your\nHonor, and age -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, if it's right, then\nyou -\nMR. COOPER: Well, no, age is an objective\nfact, but what -- what they're asking us to do is to use\nage in a way where you're having to figure out what a -\nwhat that person would think. And they're using age as\nan overgeneralization for compliance. There are lots of\ngroups that would be naturally more compliant. Mentally\nchallenged people, seniors in rest homes, there are all\nkinds of people who would be more compliant, but\ncompliance doesn't necessarily equal coercion.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You know the sentence I'm\nreferring to in my dissent, presumably? We hope. When\nI have set forth the test which was not accepted.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Some people don't -- some\npeople don't read the sentence. He may not have read\nit.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm -- I live always in\nhope.\nMR. COOPER: I'm aware of it. It was a very\nwell worded dissent.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I mean, the thing\nabout known to both and relevant to a likely belief as\nto whether he's in custody or not. Now, are you willing\nto accept that as a proper statement of the law?\nMR. COOPER: I'm willing to accept that,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fine.\nMR. COOPER: I am.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, then, perfect.\nMR. COOPER: But I don't think it includes\nage in the way they want to use it in this particular\nsituation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What do you mean by use\nit in this situation? This is a middle -- middle\nschool. This is an officer who deals only with\nchildren. I can't imagine any setting where age isn't\nmore apparent than when dealing with an assistant\nprincipal, a juvenile investigator, going -- deciding -\nthe juvenile investigator deciding the place where he\nwants to conduct this is in a middle school. I mean,\njust as a matter of common sense, how can you say that\nwe're going to have the same test for this 8-year-old as\nwe would for the 30-year-old?\nMR. COOPER: Well, Your Honor, the officer\nmay not know the age, but if he does, in this situation\nhe did, and -- and if the officer is in a middle school,\nthere is still a problem with having to figure out what\nhis actions and how they -- what they are and how they\naffect a juvenile of a particular age.\nIn the situation of the 8-year-old it may\nseem intuitively wrong, but the issue is, is you have to\nget into the mind of the 8-year-old, makes it very\ndifficult as a practical matter. The officer's going to\nhave voluntariness problems. If the officer would read\nMiranda, the officer is going to have waiver problems.\nOfficers have, in those situations,\nincentive to read Miranda, to get a parent. In -- in -\nin this type of situation the officer went there, it -\nit was a familiar location to this juvenile, it was a\nsituation where he knew three of the people in the room,\nthe officer asked him if he wanted to answer questions,\nand he said yes, the interview was relatively short.\nThe juvenile left at the end of the\ninterview, which is -- which is relevant, and I think in\nthis situation if -- if you -- if you look at it\nbroadly, it's very difficult for officers to tell age\nand to tell how age affects the situation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He probably couldn't leave\nthe classroom, either, could he, the classroom where he\nwas studying?\nMR. COOPER: Your Honor, he probably could\nnot.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So the -- the additional\ncoercive effect of not being able to leave probably\ndidn't make a whole lot of difference. He knew he was\nstuck where his parents had put him, in the school. And\nif the school sent him to a classroom, he had to be in\nthe classroom; and if the school sent him to a place\nwhere he could, if he wished, voluntarily speak to the\npolice officers, he had to be there.\nMR. COOPER: Well, I think that's right,\nYour Honor. I think you look at the school setting and\nI think you look at -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And we look at what is\nthe normal school setting just like we looked at the\nnormal business settings, he's in class, all the\nchildren are around him. This seventh grader was\nmarched by the school security officer, taken away from\nhis peers, from his class in -- put in a room with a\nclosed door with the assistant principal. That is not a\nnormal part of the school day. That's not where he is\nrequired to be. This is -\nMR. COOPER: Well, Your Honor, I think\nfeeling free to leave somewhere is not the entire test\nfor custody. There has to be a restraint on freedom to\nthe degree associated with the arrest, and I think\nthat's pretty clear from the Berkemer case -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you say associated\nwith a reasonable man, and when we construct the\nreasonable man, you're asking me to think of a\n25-year-old sitting in a seventh grade social -- social\nstudies class.\nMR. COOPER: Well, Your Honor, I think a\nreasonable -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's a little hard for\nme to imagine.\nMR. COOPER: Well, a -- a reasonable person\nis one of ordinary reason and intelligence who knows\nwhat custody looks like, essentially, and is informed by\n45 years of case law. If you have someone who is very\nyoung, but if you have someone without any other kind of\ndisability, the voluntariness test is there. It -- it\nconsiders age significantly in determining whether a\nstatement -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me, haven't we\nrepeatedly said that it's going to be very difficult for\na defendant to show that his confession wasn't\ninvoluntary if there was no Miranda violation? Isn't\nthe entire purpose of Miranda and its requirement\nbecause there was a belief that it wasn't -- that\nvoluntariness wasn't enough -- was not good enough\nbecause it was such a high bar, to secure the privilege\nagainst self-incrimination?\nMR. COOPER: Well, Your Honor, I agree with\nthat, but the voluntariness test was complex because you\ndid consider so many factors. So the Court lifted the\nMiranda test out of the voluntariness test, made it an\nobjective test, a prophylactic one, clearly a different\ntest -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That doesn't answer my\nquestion. If we've said if you're not in custody, it's\ngoing to be nearly impossible for you to show that your\nstatement was involuntary, are you now accepting that\nwith respect to age a 9-year-old may not feel free to\nleave as opposed to a 13 or 14-year-old, that somehow we\nshould instruct the courts that age really needs to be\nstepped up in the voluntariness test?\nMR. COOPER: Well, Your Honor, in -- in\nvoluntariness, you don't necessarily have to have\ncustody to prove that a statement is involuntary, and of\nchildren who are particularly young, that will come into\nplay significantly. I think you don't have to get into\nturning Miranda upside down in order -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So are you happy with\nthe rule that says, no, not in the objective Miranda\ntest, but, yes, age should be elevated as a prime\nconsideration in the voluntariness test?\nMR. COOPER: Justice Sotomayor, I think it\nis already a significant factor in the voluntariness\ntest, and I think particularly for young children, I\nthink you're going to see that continue to occur.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: General Cooper, I'm not sure\nhow I understand or that I understand how this would be\nturning Miranda upside down. Miranda is already an\nincredibly complicated test about when those warnings\nneed to be given, all right. So there are all manner of\ncircumstances which go into the determination of whether\na person would feel free to learn -- leave, whether a\nperson would feel as though he were in custody, a\nthousand things, how many people are in the room, how\nlong the interrogation is, where the interrogation is,\nthe particular circumstances of the interrogation.\nSo, this is not a bright line test, and all\nthat we would be doing here would be adding an\nadditional objective factor to an already multifaceted\ninquiry.\nMR. COOPER: Justice Kagan, admittedly\nsometimes Miranda has gray areas, because you do look at\na combination of factors, but it's informed with 45\nyears of case law. And officers now have a pretty good\nidea as to what combination of factors constitute\ncustody for Miranda purposes.\nWhat age does is now we're going to have to\ngo back in and reassess all of those combination of\nfactors through the eyes of a 13, 14, 15-year-old,\n16-year-old, it's going to be case law that's going to\ntake -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why? Why is that? We've\nseen two cases that seem like blue moon, once in a blue\nmoon. Alvarado is a odd set of circumstances. And what\nis the terrible thing, the awful thing that has to\nhappen if the officer isn't sure whether this individual\nthinks he's in custody or not? Suppose the officer just\nisn't sure. What terrible thing happens?\nMR. COOPER: Well, Your Honor -\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is the answer to that\nquestion?\nMR. COOPER: You over Mirandize. You\nMirandize when it's not necessary.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, well, you over\nMirandize. The terrible thing that happens is you have\nto give them a Miranda warning.\nNow -- now, that is the terrible thing.\nNow -- now -- now, why is that a burden on the criminal\njustice system that sometimes in ambiguous circumstances\nor because this kid is very young, he might not\nunderstand it quite as well, and the officer sees that,\nthe kid sees it, and so the officer has to give him a\nMiranda warning.\nMR. COOPER: Your Honor -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, what happens to\ndestroy the criminal justice system? You can see from\nmy overstatement, I tend to suspect nothing, but you\ntell me.\nMR. COOPER: A lot. School resource\nofficers, there are thousands of them, they are -- they\nare licensed, but police officers -- uniform police\nofficers who often counsel kids as well as protect the\nschool. Under the Petitioner's theory, a school\nresource officer who is going to take a juvenile into a\nroom to talk about a stolen cell phone or bullying, the\nfirst thing that he's got to say is you have the right\nto remain silent.\nNow, that, in my opinion, disrupts the\ncommunication.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why not the first thing,\nhey, kid, we're here talking, but you want to leave,\njust open the door and leave. Go. Nobody's keeping you\nhere. Why isn't that the first thing, if he's really\nfree to go?\nMR. COOPER: Well, he may not want him to\ngo, number one.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, oh, oh, I see, I see.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. COOPER: Well, you know, you want to\ntalk -- you want to talk to the kid. If you have a\ntraffic stop, you don't want to immediately tell the\n15-year-old driver, you're free to leave, because he's\nnot. It's just like Berkemer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: He's not free to leave?\nOkay. Well, then, why not warn him?\nMR. COOPER: Well, no, because that's a\nBerkemer situation, a traffic stop. And it didn't -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: For search purposes, is\nage consciousness required? Remember, a part of this is\nthe police officer then goes to the boy's home. The\npolice officer is trained to deal with juveniles. And\nhe says to the boy, you can't consent to the search\nbecause you're a seventh-grader. I will have to get a\nwarrant. So please stay here until I get a warrant.\nIf he can't -- if he's not treated like an\nadult for purposes of the search, if you get the\nwarrant, if the police need a warrant because they're\ndealing with a seventh-grader, why should it be\ndifferent for in custody for Miranda purposes?\nMR. COOPER: Well, Your Honor, I think when\nyou're dealing with voluntariness, when you're dealing\nwith consent to search, when you're dealing with waiver,\nyou're looking at the particular juvenile. You're\nlooking at all of the circumstances. The courts have\nsaid that the Miranda test is different -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought all the police\nofficer was looking at when he said \"I have to get a\nwarrant\" is that he's dealing with a seventh-grader, not\nall the circumstances. Very simple: Age.\nMR. COOPER: Well, it might -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: He's under the age of\nconsent.\nMR. COOPER: It might have been, in this\ncircumstance, that he didn't own the house. It was the\ngrandmother who actually owned the house as to why he\nneeded -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: He can't consent to a\ncontract. He -\nMR. COOPER: And, Your Honor, you are right.\nThere are other categorical prohibitions on age across\nthe board in our law, but here what we're doing is\nasking officers to assess each situation based on the\nparticular age of a juvenile, which makes it all the\nmore difficult for the officer.\nYou know, say for example that you're at a\nTerry stop and there are a number of juvenile-looking\npeople there. Let's say they're 15 to 19, but the\nofficer doesn't know it. He's at the Terry stop. He's\ngoing to be faced with, potentially, Mirandizing some of\nthe people there and not -- not others. That's going to\nput law enforcement in an untenable situation and make\nit very complex for them as to when they read Miranda\nand they don't. And I think in addition to -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Counsel, do you agree with\nthe solicitor general's view that a blind person should\nbe treated as a blind person for -- for these purposes?\nMR. COOPER: I think I do, Your Honor,\nbecause -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And a deaf person should be\ntreated as a deaf person for these purposes?\nMR. COOPER: It's an obvious external\ncircumstance.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: As is youth. As is youth,\nan obvious external circumstance that this boy was 13\nyears old.\nMR. COOPER: But you don't have to get into\nthe mind of the blind person or the deaf person. The\nonly issue is whether they have acquired the knowledge\nin order to be able to put it into the -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: You know, I don't agree with\nthat. You are trying to understand this situation as\nthe blind person would have seen it or as the deaf\nperson would have seen it or as the 13-year-old would\nhave seen it, and I don't understand why it's different.\nMR. COOPER: Well, Your Honor, I think it's\ndifferent because it has to do with something that is\nobvious. It is not necessarily obvious how a 13- or\n14-year-old would view the situation. And just in\nthe -- the Alvarado opinion, the opinion says that\nsometimes the permissible objective facts and\nimpermissible subjective opinions sometimes merge.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The blind person doesn't\nhave a different mind.\nMR. COOPER: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The deaf person doesn't\nhave a different mind. He just has less data, and it's\neasy to take account of less data; easier to take\naccount of less data than it is to take account of how\ndifferent one's mind is because he's 16 instead of 13 or\nwhatever. That's the difference between the blind and\nthe deaf, isn't it?\nMR. COOPER: I think you're absolutely -\nabsolutely right, and yes, too, Your Honor. I think\nit's important to know that we have already started\ngoing down the slippery slope in a number of states.\nThere have been 11 states, contrary to Petitioner's\nbrief, that are considering other characteristics in\nMiranda, such as sophistication, such as education, such\nas intelligence. That makes it so much more difficult.\nAnd this Court has not hesitated -- it did\nnot hesitate in Alvarado; it did not hesitate in\nBerkemer -- to correct lower courts, to say we've got to\nmake sure that Miranda is complete, that Miranda stays\nclear and objective, and that we don't blur the lines.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If the law goes down that\nroute, then one of the chief advantages of the Miranda\nrule, which is that it's a relatively simple objective\ntest, is eliminated, and the law of Miranda begins to\nresemble the law of voluntariness. And maybe at that\npoint, there is no longer a strong argument in favor of\nMiranda, and the voluntariness test will be the sole\ntest.\nMR. COOPER: We support Miranda, Your Honor.\nWe support Miranda in its current form. We think it's\nappropriate, but I think clearly, by adding age into the\ncircumstance, it makes it more complicated.\nYour Honor, I would -- Justices, I would\nrequest that the North Carolina Supreme Court decision\nbe upheld.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Feigin.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN,\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMR. FEIGIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThere are three primary reasons why age\nshould not be a factor in the Miranda custody test. I\nthink the most important one is this: The only\nstatements that are going to be suppressed under\nPetitioner's rule that wouldn't already be suppressed by\nexisting doctrine are statements that, first of all, the\nprosecution has -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm sorry. I just -- the\nonly statements that could be suppressed -- I just\ndidn't hear.\nMR. FEIGIN: The only statements that are\ngoing to be suppressed under Petitioner's rule that\nwould take age into account that aren't already going to\nbe suppressed under existing constitutional doctrines\nare statements that, first of all, the prosecution has\ncarried its burden to prove are voluntary under a\nvoluntariness test that already takes age into account,\nand second of all, are given under circumstances that\ndon't otherwise meet the definition of custody; that is,\nformal arrest or its functional equivalent.\nI think that's a relatively small and not a\nparticularly problematic category of statements, and I\ndon't think it's worth complicating the Miranda rule in\norder to make sure that those statements are suppressed.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why? Maybe you can explain\nthis to me, too.\nYou have a blind person there. Everyone -\nyou don't know how blind. He's somewhat blind. A deaf\nperson. How hard of hearing? We're not sure. So the\npoliceman goes a little overboard. You are free to\nleave, or shows it to him, or makes sure he gets it in.\nOkay? Why is that so tough to do where you also have a\n12-year-old? If he really is free to leave, just make\nclear that he knows it.\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, I think the\ncritical difference between blindness, deafness, and\nother sensory disabilities and age is what Justice\nScalia said a few minutes ago, which is, in the case of\na blind or deaf person, you can try to figure out what\nthe circumstances surrounding the interrogation that are\nobservable to that person are, and then -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But that's all we're doing\nwith the young person. And in fact, most of us, many of\nus, have a great deal more experience understanding the\nworld through the eyes of a young person or children,\nperhaps, than understanding the eyes -- the world\nthrough the eyes of a severely sensory deprived person.\nWe're asking the exact same thing in both\ncontexts: What is this person -- what is this -- what\ndo the objective circumstances appear to a person in\nthis situation?\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, I don't think\nyou're doing the same thing, and I think it's easier to\nput yourself in the mindset of a person with a sensory\ndeprivation than a person of a particular age, and let\nme explain why.\nFor a person with a sensory deprivation,\nlike in Justice Breyer's example, the sign that someone\ncan't read, I think it's very common and easy for\nofficers and courts to figure out how they would react\nto the situation if the sign simply weren't there.\nWith age, what you're asking perhaps a\n45-year-old officer to do, in Justice Alito's example,\nor a 60-year-old judge to do, is to put them into the\nframe of mind of a person that they haven't been for 32\nyears or 45 years, and I don't think that's a very easy\ninquiry to ask officers or courts to make.\nI think this is really going to complicate\nthe Miranda rule by asking them, A, to do that, and, B,\nbecause there are going to be many cases, unlike this\ncase, where it's not going to be apparent to the officer\nwhat age the suspect is.\nOne thing that comes up fairly commonly in\nmany jurisdictions is that an officer will stop someone\non a -- do a traffic stop of someone on the road; the\nperson will claim not to have their ID, and it will turn\nout the person is 14 and they will give the name and\nbirth date of an older sibling. And there is simply no\nway for an officer in those circumstances to know what\nthe age of the suspect is.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Limit it to when the age\nis known. If we limit it to, this is an officer who not\nonly knows he's dealing with a seventh-grader but he\ndecides the venue for the questioning is going to be a\nroom in the school, that's -- it's not a mystery. It's\nnot a guess. He knows he's dealing with a\nseventh-grader. He sets it up.\nAre we to ignore what the investigating\nofficer knows? The investigating officer knows he's\ndealing with a child.\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, I think there\nare sort of two parts to your question. Let me deal\nfirst with the rule that would only apply when officers\nknow the identity, know the age of the suspect. I think\nthat rule would be easier to apply than the rule the\nPetitioners are suggesting and would mitigate some of\nthe damage, but first of all it doesn't solve the\ncritical problem of asking officers who aren't\nthemselves 13 to think like someone who is 13; and\nsecond of all, I think for reasons that I think were\napparent during the argument by my friend on the other\nside, that rule might easily devolve into a \"should have\nknown\" test, and officers simply aren't going to be able\nto deal with that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The officer doesn't have to\nthink like a 13-year-old, he has to think the way a\n60-year-old judge would think a 13-year-old thought,\nright?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FEIGIN: That's right, Your Honor, and\nit may depend what -- which particular 60-year-old\njudge -\nJUSTICE BREYER: But that isn't -- to me,\nanyway, that is not the question. I don't think anybody\nis asking anybody to think like anything else. All it\nis, when you face a younger child, and he is free to go,\nand you mean he's free to go, you just sort of err a\nlittle bit on the safe side and make sure he understands\nit. That's all. Nobody has to think like anybody. All\nthey have to think is let's err somewhat on the safe\nside. Now why is that tough?\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, I think that\nthe main problem here is that it's going to create more\nconfusion for officers because it's another factor they\nhave to put into the test, and it's -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What's the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why don't we require\nMiranda always?\nMR. FEIGIN: The courts -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is there any harm in\nrequiring it always? It's always easy to do. Why don't\nwe require it all the time? Can you tell us why it\nmakes a difference?\nMR. FEIGIN: I think it's very unrealistic\nthat every time an officer opens their mouth they have\nto give Miranda warnings, and I think it would\nfundamentally change the nature of police interactions\nwith the public. The Court -- and the other reason the\nCourt has never required it is that voluntary\nstatements, the Court made clear in two cases last term\nagain, Maryland v. Jasper, and Berkeley v. Thompkins,\nare a good thing, and there -- voluntary confessions are\na good thing, they're very helpful for law enforcement.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Feigin -\nMR. FEIGIN: And there's no reason to -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I'm sorry.\nMR. FEIGIN: Please.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Do you think that a 00 a\nperson with Down's syndrome, that that should be taken\ninto account in this inquiry?\nMR. FEIGIN: I'm not sure how that would be\ntaken into account, Your Honor. To the extent that\nsomeone with Down's syndrome thinks differently from\nsomeone who doesn't have Down's syndrome, I think that\nwould be very relevant to the voluntariness test but\nwould not be relevant to the custody test. Because it's\n-- again it's going to be very difficult to ask an\nofficer to put themselves in the mindset of someone who\nhas Down's syndrome. I think the -- the third\nproblem -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how is that different\nthan blindness or hearing? A person with Down's\nsyndrome, many -- some don't -- show characteristics\nthat they're not capable of comprehension, or not\ncapable of absorbing information.\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They barely look at you,\nthey barely -- you know, there are characteristics that\nshow you a lack of absorption of information.\nMR. FEIGIN: Your Honor, I may have\ndifficulty dealing with this particular hypothetical\nbecause of my lack of knowledge of the particular\nsymptoms of Down's syndrome; but if you're dealing with\na suspect who simply can't absorb information about the\nworld, then that's going to be a sensory deprivation\nthat's going to be taken into account, because it's\ngoing to subtract circumstances away that that suspect\ncan't perceive. But if you're asking about the mindset\nof someone that has a particular sensory disability,\nthen no, I don't think that would be taken into account\nbecause it's asking too much of officers to try to put\nthemselves in that mindset.\nAnd the third problem, I think, with\nfactoring age into the custody test is that -- and as I\nthink Petitioners effectively conceded, it creates a\nslippery slope problem. There really isn't a clear\ndistinction between age and other things such as mental\ndisorders or cultural background, that defendants also\nargue change whether they believe that they've been\nsubject to a formal arrest or its functional equivalent.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We don't want Miranda\nwarnings to be given where they are unnecessary because\nthey are only necessary to prevent coercion, and where\nthere's no coercion, we want confessions, don't we? And\nthe Miranda warnings deter confessions.\nMR. FEIGIN: That's right, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that the basic\nreason?\nMR. FEIGIN: That's right, Your Honor,\nand -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So it's not cost-free to\nrequire Miranda warnings.\nMR. FEIGIN: That's right -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's a good thing to have\nthe bad guys confess that they're bad guys, right?\nMR. FEIGIN: That's right, Your Honor,\nthat's what I was trying to say earlier.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Before you -- you are so\nquick to answer that's right, isn't it so that the\nmanual that this very officer was given to use said\nbefore you question a child, give Miranda warnings?\nMR. FEIGIN: Yes, it did, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Apparently the people who\ntrain these juvenile officers think it's a good thing,\nnot a bad thing to give a Miranda warning.\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, one reason they may think\nit's a good thing and one reason I think the Court\ndoesn't need to accept Petitioner's rule here, is that\nofficers often will give Miranda warnings, for precisely\nthe reasons Justice Sotomayor was suggesting earlier,\nwhich is that when officers do give Miranda warnings,\nit's going to be -- and those Miranda -- the Miranda\nprocedures are all validly followed, there's not going\nto be a real robust voluntariness inquiry because in\nmost cases where the Miranda procedures are followed,\nthe statements are going to be found to be voluntary\nunder the voluntariness test.\nAnd if I could actually add answer an answer\nto Justice Scalia's earlier question, Miranda isn't\nsimply concerned with coercion. The Court made very\nclear in Oregon v. Mathiason that Miranda isn't\nattempting capture every quote, unquote, \"coercive\nenvironment.\" What Miranda is directed at is a specific\nenvironment -- thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish your\nsentence.\nMR. FEIGIN: Specific environment, namely\ncustody, which is defined as a formal arrest or its\nfunctional equivalent. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Blackman, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA S. BLACKMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. BLACKMAN: I think what's very odd in\nthis case is that the only party that didn't consider\nJ.D.B.'s age was the courts. I mean, it was clearly\nbeing taken into account by Officer DiCostanzo, and\nJ.D.B. was fully aware of his own age. And under\nThompson v. Keohane, what a reviewing court is supposed\nto be doing is immersing itself in the actual\ncircumstances of the case; and without this\nconsideration of age, then the courts are examining\nhypothetical, because -- hypothetical interrogations and\nnot the one that was actually occurring in the case.\nOfficers have to make judgments about every\nobjective circumstance that arises, and asking them to\nmake objective determinations on juvenile status is no\ndifferent and is not going to muddy the water. I think\nas Justice Kagan pointed out, custody is a very\ndifficult issue. It's not subject to bright line rules.\nBut we can't be defining it in such a way where we are\nrequiring these children to be someone that they never\ncould be, and that is, reasonable adults.\nIf our goal here is to ensure reliability of\nfactfinding, reliability of statements, if we want to\nreduce the coercion, to which our citizens are entitled,\nthen this rule needs to be put into play, and we ask\nthat the North Carolina Supreme Court decision be\nreversed. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
