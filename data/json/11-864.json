        "content": "(10:05 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Case 11-864, Comcast\nCorporation v. Behrend.\nMr. Estrada.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL ESTRADA\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. ESTRADA: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe Third Circuit held in this case that the\nassessment of the adequacy of expert evidence offered in\nsupport of class certification is a merits question that\nhas no place in the class certification inquiry.\nAccording to the Third Circuit and to the\nplaintiffs in this Court, what is sufficient is for the\nproponents of class certification to point to some\nabstract methodology, such as econometrics or regression\nanalysis, that conceivably might be applied to the\nproblem at hand in a way in which, in the fullness of\ntime, will evolve into admissible evidence by the time\nof the class trial.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Estrada, you are\nlimiting your argument to the determination of damages,\nas I understand it.\nMR. ESTRADA: I think you limited my\nargument to determination of damages, Justice Ginsburg.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Because the -- because\nthe Third Circuit agreed that, as far as any antitrust\nimpact --\nMR. ESTRADA: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that could be\nestablished on a class basis.\nMR. ESTRADA: We -- we, obviously -- as is\nobvious from our cert petition, we do not agree with\nthat. For purposes of inquiring into the damages\nquestion in this Court, I think we have to assume that\nthat is so. I think it doesn't change the\noutcome with --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But why -- why not?\nBecause, generally -- and at least it's my impression --\nthat in class certifications, if the liability question\ncan be adjudicated on a class basis, then the damages\nquestion may be adjudicated individually.\nTake a -- take a Title VII case. A\nliability -- a pattern of practice of discrimination,\ntherefore, liability, but damages can be assessed on an\nindividual basis. So why isn't bifurcation possible\nhere?\nMR. ESTRADA: Well, let me make two points\nin response to that question, Justice Ginsburg: One\nabout what the legal standards are, and -- you know, the\nsecond one, which is as important, about what the record\nin this case is.\nWith respect to the first point, what the\nrule asks us to look at is not questions of damages\nversus liability, but whether the common questions\npredominate over those that are individual to the class\nmembers.\nI don't disagree, and it is not my position\ntoday that there may be cases in which individual\ndamages questions are consistent with class\ncertification. But as the lower courts have recognized,\nit is not the case that all damages questions may -- may\nremain individual consistently with class certification.\nIndeed, the 1966 advisory notes expressly\nsay that questions of damages with respect to class\nmembers may or may not predominate in cases like this;\ni.e., antitrust class actions. Let --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Estrada, doesn't\nJustice Ginsburg's question actually point out that\nthe -- the law that both district court and the\ncircuit court used in this case was actually quite\nfavorable to you?\nUnlike some courts, both the district court\nand the circuit court said that the plaintiffs needed to\nshow that there was a class-wide measurement of damages.\nAnd then in addition, both courts said, really, it\nwas -- the burden was on the plaintiffs to demonstrate\nthat that class-wide measure of damages existed.\nNow, I understand that you have problems\nwith the way in which the plaintiffs met that burden.\nYou say that they didn't meet that burden. But it seems\nto me that the legal standard that was used was exactly\nthe legal standard that you wanted, that the plaintiffs\nhad to come in and show, by a preponderance, that they\nhad a class-wide way to measure damages in this case.\nMR. ESTRADA: I don't think that's right,\nJustice Kagan. I think we can have a healthy debate\nabout whether the district court did what you just\nfinished saying. I think there can be no debate that\nthe court of appeals did so because, repeatedly,\nthroughout its opinion, said that the questions as to\nthe adequacy of whether they had complied with the\nHydrogen Peroxide Standard was a merits question that\nwas for later adjudication in this case.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, here's what the\ndistrict court said. \"The experts' opinions raise\nsubstantial issues of fact and credibility that we are\nrequired to resolve to decide the pending motion.\" That\nis the motion for class certification.\n\"Having rigorously analyzed the experts'\nreports, we conclude that the class has met its burden\nto demonstrate that the element of antitrust impact is\ncapable of proof at trial through evidence that is\ncommon to the class and that there is a common\nmethodology available to measure and quantify damages on\na class-wide basis.\"\nSo that seems to me exactly what you say\nthey should have done. Now, you disagree with their\nultimate determination, but not with the statement of\nthe law.\nMR. ESTRADA: Well, I think that it is true\nthat our position in the district court was that\nHydrogen Peroxide controlled and that the district court\ncorrectly stated the holding of the Third Circuit ruling\nin that case.\nBeyond that, I don't think that we do agree,\nbecause, in the Third Circuit, once the case got there,\nwe got a rule of law saying that, although this court\nprescribed the rule amendment, 23(f), precisely to\nenable courts of appeals to review whether the district\ncourt got it right for important policy questions, that\nthe job of the court of appeals under 23(f) can be fully\ndischarged by saying that providence will provide; we'll\nthink about it in the morning. And that is not\nconsistent with the proposition that the correct law was\napplied in the lower courts.\nFurthermore, although the district court did\nenounce the correct standard in reflecting the holding\nof Hydrogen Peroxide, it is far from apparent -- and\nthis is part of our point to the Third Circuit -- excuse\nme -- to the Third Circuit -- which was not actually\nheard on the merits, that what he did was different from\nsimply saying that econometrics and regression analysis\nare well-established methodologies for dealing with\nproblems of this kind.\nAnd I will ask you to -- to look at the top\nof page 145 of the Pet. App., where you can look at\ndiscussions -- no, I'm sorry, it's 131, in footnote\n24 -- where the district court made clear that his\nunderstanding of the capable class-wide proof involved\nthe inquiry whether the plaintiffs actually had evidence\nthat reflected the methodologies that had been used in\nthis case -- in these kinds of cases.\nHe says, \"It is undisputed that multiple\nregression analysis is an acceptable and widely\nrecognized statistical tool for cases of this kind.\"\nSo at a very general level, I don't have a\ndisagreement with you that, in many cases where there is\nerror, the district court started out with the right\nfoot. I don't agree with you that the correct standard\neither was applied by the district court or was even\nattempted by the court of appeals.\nNow, if we were to go to the merits of the\nquestion -- and to answer -- you know, the second part\nof the question that I started out with\nJustice Ginsburg -- keep in mind that, even on the\nassumption that the district court accepted that there\nwas common class proof of antitrust impact, that is not\nthe same as accepting -- and I don't think the district\ncourt accepted -- that there was common class-wide proof\nthat the impact for every individual was the same.\nAnd that is a key point about what the\ntheory of impact here was.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It doesn't have to be the\nsame for every member of the class. As the dissenting\njudge pointed out, you can have subclasses.\nMR. ESTRADA: Well -- and I'm happy to also\ndeal with that question. There are cases, indeed, in\nwhich -- you know, the variances of the classes can be\ndealt with, with subclasses. No one on the plaintiffs'\nside has actually asserted here that the record would\nallow this. And Mr. Jordan pointed out there is\nconsiderable basis for skepticism in thinking that that\ncould ever be accomplished because we are talking about\n649 franchise areas with different competitive\nconditions.\nBut if you go back to -- to the theory of\nimpact -- and the theory of impact was that RCN, this\nputative overbuilder, was -- you know, the little engine\nthat could, that it was going to radiate out to the\nentire DMA area and completely overbuild the area. So\nthe theory of impact was, if you drop a stone in the\nwater, you are going to have ripples all the way out, so\nyou have ripples as to every member of the class. It\ndoesn't mean that every ripple is the same.\nSo -- so that the key question for the\ndamages issue in front of you now is whether what\nMcClave came up with was an adequate methodology for\nmeasuring the size of the ripple --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I did -- are there cases\nin the -- in the ordinary course of class actions -- I\nknow they are all different -- where the district court\ncan find that common questions do predominate, without\naddressing the question whether damages can be proven on\na class-wide basis? Or are they always interlinked?\nMR. ESTRADA: No, I think the text of\n(b)(20) -- of (b)(3) expressly requires that questions,\nwhether they be damages or liability that are common to\nthe class, predominate over those that are individual as\nto class members. And I -- I fully accept -- and I am\nnot arguing -- that the mere fact that there may be\nindividual damages questions precludes class\ncertification.\nI am actually arguing for the flip side of\nthat issue, which is that just because it -- it may not\nbe preclusive in certain cases doesn't mean that it is\npreclusive in no case.\nI would refer the Court to the Fifth\nCircuit's opinion by Judge Garwood in the Bell v. AT&T\ncase, which was, like this, an antitrust case, where the\nFifth Circuit acknowledged that, in many of these cases,\nit's almost hornbook law that there may be individual\nissues that would not preclude class cert, but that\nthere are certain cases in which -- you know, the theory\nof injury and -- and the proof that would be needed to\nmake it out is so sui generous and individualized --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I completely agree\nwith hornbook law. Three pipe manufacturers get\ntogether and, in January, fix their prices, all right?\nMR. ESTRADA: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fourteen wholesalers want\nto show that, and each has different damages because\nthey bought different amounts of pipe.\nMR. ESTRADA: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Hornbook law: Certify the\nclass and leave the damages issues for later.\nMR. ESTRADA: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: This case, this case,\nhornbook law: Section 2 forbids monopolization. It is\nabsolutely clear Comcast has that power. That's why\nthey're -- that's why they're regulated. And, indeed,\nthey engage in things that show that they did not\nachieve that through skill, foresight, and industry.\nWhat things? And now, we have a list of\nfour. And the district court says exactly what? If we\nprove monopolization, which is relevant to all these\npeople in the class, then what we do is we later look\ninto how much that monopolization raised the prices\nabove competitive levels. And I offer a model to look\nat the competitive levels and look at what happened over\nhere, and there we are, it will help. Okay?\nNow, hornbook law, whether that's so or not\nso is a matter for later, but see first if there is\nliability. Okay. That's their argument. What's the\nanswer?\nMR. ESTRADA: Well, I mean, the answer is --\nI will take your first example, and, in fact, I was\ngoing to give -- you know, the example of a case that I\nhad that was similar where -- you know, three plastic\ncup manufacturers met in -- you know, some airport and\nfixed -- you know, the prices.\nNow, this is like saying you fixing -- you\nknow, the price of widgets. There is a preexisting\nbut-for world, and the question as to who bought what\nwhen is not really a question of adjudication, but of\ncomputation. And those are the types of cases where the\ncourts say that the individual damages questions really\ndo not preclude a -- a certification.\nNow, your second example may or may not be\nsuitable for class treatment.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, here, since what they\nare saying is they have two theories, Section 1, the\nagreements to keep other people out of this area are\nunlawful in themselves. Question 2 is whether they\ncontribute to monopolization. Okay?\nMR. ESTRADA: No, but -- but the question --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, that's the legal issue\nof liability. Now, if they're right, why isn't the\nmeasure of damages just what you said? We look to the\npeople who are subject to the monopoly power, and we\nwork out how much above the competitive level they had\nto pay.\nMR. ESTRADA: But the legal --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Some paid some; some paid\nanother. We have some experts in to try to make that\ncomputation. Sounds the same to me.\nMR. ESTRADA: No, but it isn't because one\nkey point that is missing from the hypothetical,\nJustice Breyer, is exactly what the theory of liability\nthat is present in this case is, as the case comes to\nthe Court. They had four theories of possible --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I saw the four theories,\nand it seems to me that we are now on the theory of\nthe -- one of the pieces of exclusionary conduct was\nagreement through various mergers, et cetera, that\npotential competitors would not come in and compete.\nNow, I don't know why the judge struck out\nthe other one, the number 2. But number 3 and Number 4,\nI can see it. But on monopolization theory, that's not\nrelevant to damages. Throughout, we assume that the\nregulator is doing a terrible job; otherwise, the prices\nwouldn't be so high in the first place.\nBut what's the difference in this case? I\njust didn't hear it, and I put that to show you how it\nseemed to me there is very similar. The difference --\nMR. ESTRADA: No. I mean, I think -- you\nknow, the key point that you are missing in your\nhypothetical --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is?\nMR. ESTRADA: -- basically starts with the\nactual point of antitrust law, whether these people\nare -- actually are potential competitors. It's not\nactually relevant to the class certifications that we\nface today.\nBut I don't accept, for present purposes or\nfor later, that these people that already have different\nclusters of cable service that were simply aggregated in\nthese transactions actually were actual potential\ncompetitors. They were not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's -- I mean, that's\nliability.\nMR. ESTRADA: Well, you are right --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You have the right to prove\nthat they weren't, fine.\nMR. ESTRADA: I just said that. But the\npoint is that, as the case comes to the -- to the Court,\nthe question is whether the class that was certified by\nthe district court and validated in its own way by the\ncourt of appeals is one that is consistent and fits\nreliably with the legal theory that the plaintiffs are\nallowed to pursue --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And this does, too -\nMR. ESTRADA: -- in this case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- because if they prove\ntheir case, the question on damages is to what extent\ndid the absence of competition from the overbuilders --\nand it should have been DBS too, from reading this, but\nnonetheless, let me express no view on that.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: But on -- on -- to what\nextent did the failure of competition from those people\nraise price above the competitive level?\nMR. ESTRADA: I mean, I hate --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if --\nMR. ESTRADA: Justice Breyer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- how is it different from\nthe pipes --\nMR. ESTRADA: -- I mean, I really hate to be\nso prosaic.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, you shouldn't.\nMR. ESTRADA: And you mentioned something --\nsomething so contrary to the facts, but the fact is that\nthe fundamental question here is that there is one\ntheory they are permitted to pursue. It is that this\noverbuilder, RCN, would have radiator -- radiated out\nthrough the DMA area.\nNow, you may think that they should have\nbeen allowed to pursue some other different theory.\nIt's not the case that you have in front of you. And\nthe fact is that -- that -- that as the case comes to\nthe Court, the theory that remains is based on the\nproposition that RCN was going to be the overbuilder\nthat -- that was going to impact prices. Well, two --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. --\nMR. ESTRADA: If I could just finish?\nTwo things follow from that. You know, the\nfirst one which is directly pertinent to the issue here\nis that the McClave model purported to compute damages\nthat were not limited to overbuilding and that, in fact,\nexpressly measured overbuilding only as to 5 out of the\n16 counties. The damage model just does not fit the\nlegal theory that stays in the case.\nThe second aspect of it is that, as a\nquestion of the factual fit with the record in the case,\nthe transactions that added the largest number of\nsubscribers here occurred in 2000 and very early 2001.\nThe record in this case includes public announcements by\nRCN, repeated by the FCC in its competition review, that\nthey were not going to franchise any new franchises. So\nthere is a basic question of lack of fit between the ipse\ndixit of the expert and -- you know, the record in this case.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Estrada, as -- as the\ncase comes to the Court, I guess I wonder why any of\nthis is relevant. You mentioned earlier -- you\nmentioned earlier that we reformulated the question\npresented in this case. And we reformulated in a way\nwhich said that what we wanted to talk about was whether\na district court at a class certification stage has to\nconduct a Daubert inquiry, in other words, has to decide\non the admissibility of expert testimony relating to\nclass-wide damages.\nAnd -- you know, it would not be crazy to\nsurmise that we reformulated the question because we\nwanted to present -- we wanted to decide a legal\nquestion, rather than a question about who was right as\nto this particular expert's report and how strong it\nwas. And it turns out that, as to that legal question,\nyour clients waived their -- their argument that this\nwas inadmissible evidence.\nSo -- so what do we do in that circumstance?\nMR. ESTRADA: Well, I don't agree with you\nthat we waived. And -- you know, we covered this in, I\nthink, three or pages in the reply brief, with all of\nthe citations as to how we challenged the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you challenged the\nprobity, Mr. Estrada. You said Comcast said it had no\nobjection to McClave's qualification as an expert. So\nwhat you were talking about was the probity of this\nreport, not the admissibility.\nMR. ESTRADA: No, that is not right, Justice\nGinsburg. Daubert and its progeny really encompasses\nthree distinct prongs. One of them is, of course, the\nqualifications of the expert. The second one is the --\nthe -- the reliability of the methodology. And the\nthird is fit.\nAnd all we said at the -- at the class\nhearing is that we had no objection to the proposition\nthat these people have Ph.D.'s, which indeed they do.\nBut the issue still was, both in the district court and\nin the court of appeals, one that we urged that the\nmethodology was not relevant and did not --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: The district court,\nMr. Estrada, clearly understood you to be making an\nargument about weight and not about admissibility. And\nindeed, the district court in open court -- and -- and\nit's in the transcript -- suggests that it's doing\nsomething different from holding a Daubert hearing,\nexplains how it's different from holding a Daubert\nhearing, and both lawyers agree to that statement.\nMR. ESTRADA: Well, but I think we -- we\nagree that he needed to conduct more than a Daubert\nhearing because we agree with the holding of the Seventh\nCircuit in American Honda, that the question at the\nclass cert hearing is not solely one of whether the\nevidence would be admissible, but also one of -- of\nwhether the district judge himself is persuaded that\nthis is class-wide proof that has not been impeached in\nhis own mind.\nAnd so -- you know, the mere fact that we\nall understood that what should have been ruled on at\nthe class cert hearing encompassed more than pure\nDaubert admissibility, is actually part of our complaint\nhere.\nI mean, I think, if you read what the\ndistrict court did, he basically looked at his job as\nlooking at whether the model was capable, as in\nliterally capable, of -- of -- of establishing -- you\nknow, the facts that the plaintiffs say it establishes,\nwithout really weighing in his own mind whether it had\nbeen shown to be fit and -- you know, reliable.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Estrada, it seems like a\nremarkable proposition, honestly, especially with a\nclient like yours that is well-lawyered. It seems like\na remarkable proposition that somebody -- a party can\nsay, we have objections about the weight of this\nevidence.\nWe don't think -- we don't think it's a\nstrong expert report, and that -- and that we -- and\nthat the Court should then infer that there is an\nobjection to admissibility of evidence, as opposed,\nagain, to the weight and strength of evidence.\nI mean, surely, a district court confronted\nwith an argument about the weight and strength of\nevidence does not have to say, oh, I better go hold a\nDaubert hearing to rule on admissibility even though\nnobody's asked me --\nMR. ESTRADA: But, Justice Kagan --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- to rule on admissibility.\nMR. ESTRADA: But, Justice Kagan, I mean, I\nthink we could go through chapter and verse to\neverything that we put in the reply brief. But I think,\nin fairness, I have to point out to you that we never\nsaid that our objection was to the weight and not to the\nadmissibility.\nWe agree that these people have properly\nscholarly credentials. And after that, as we say in the\nreply brief with citations to the record, we said, this\nmodel is so unreliable that it is just not usable,\nperiod, full stop. We went to the Third Circuit and\nsaid, this is not evidence of any kind, much less --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Did you -- did you ever file\na motion to strike the expert report?\nMR. ESTRADA: No, we did not, and we\nactually don't think that that's needed because it would\nactually be sort of silly to engage in a motion to\nstrike the evidence that we are asking the district\njudge to consider, in order to decide whether it\nactually is reliable.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Estrada, could you\npronounce for me or give me the legal rule as you want\nus to articulate it? Let me get you out of Daubert,\nokay? Because I think you really can't deny that you\nnever raised the word \"Daubert\" below until the very\nend. Your fight before the district court was on the\nprobity of the model, not on a Daubert issue, correct?\nMR. ESTRADA: I don't think that's fair\nbecause I think --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Did you use the word\n\"Daubert\" before the district court?\nMR. ESTRADA: We cited Daubert cases in the\ncourt of appeals. We did say to the district court that\nthe model was not usable.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Okay. So you didn't use\n\"Daubert\" below --\nMR. ESTRADA: I think that's fair.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- so let's get out of\nthe Daubert language, okay?\nTell me how and what rule we announce, so\nthat district courts find an expert's evidence\nprobative, the other side argues it's not, and when does\nthe district court let the jury decide between the two?\nMR. ESTRADA: There --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Where is the line that\nthe district court draws between class certification and\nmerits adjudication, so that, at some point, it goes to\nthe jury?\nMR. ESTRADA: There are two things that the\ndistrict court has to do, and both involve an assessment\nof the validity or, as you would put it, probity of the\nexpert evidence -- you know, the first one keeps in mind\nthat the focus of the class certification hearing is to\ndecide whether the -- this case should be tried as a\nclass.\nAnd therefore, the first question that the\ndistrict court has to ask is, even if I think that this\nis not ready now, do they have a methodology that\nsufficiently fits the facts and is reliably based on a\nscientific method, so that these people will be capable\nof proving class-wide this issue at trial. That's not\nenough.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We must have thought that,\nI suppose, or else, we wouldn't have reformulated the\nquestion this way, right?\nMR. ESTRADA: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's the way you put the\nquestion initially, and we reformulated it to be a\nDaubert question.\nMR. ESTRADA: I was -- I was going to point\nout, by reference to one of your opinions,\nJustice Scalia, that there is a question sort of based\non the Williams case, 504 U.S., as to -- you know, the\nextent to which these issues are open to the Respondent\nto challenge as well.\nBecause by the time we framed the cert\npetition -- even though we framed it in terms of\nDaubert, it was abundantly clear, as we pointed out in\nthe reply brief, that we were challenging the fit and\nthe reliability of the methodology. And there was nary\na word in the -- in the brief in opposition that\nactually took issue with that.\nOn the faith of that, you reformulated the\nquestion. Your ruling in Williams would say that that\nissue is now over and that we move to the consideration\nof the merits.\nAnd I would like to reserve the remainder of\nmy time for rebuttal.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Barnett.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BARRY BARNETT\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. BARNETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nJustice Ginsburg and Justice Kagan, you are\nexactly right. The petition for certiorari was framed\nnot, as counsel just misspoke, in terms of Daubert, but\nit was framed in terms of whether you have to go into --\nwhether the district court and the court of appeals have\nto deal with merits issues, and that question was what\nwas reformulated.\nAnd to get a sense of how profoundly\nuninterested Comcast was in Daubert and in arguing\nweight and probativeness, as opposed to admissibility,\nwhich is the question before this Court, they never,\never cited Daubert. They didn't cite it in the district\ncourt. They didn't cite it in the court of appeals.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: One of my -- one of my\nquestions in the case is this: There was a question to\nMr. Estrada with reference to a jury trial. But\nthere's -- there's -- the judge doesn't really have a\ngate -- what do you call it -- a gatekeeper function\nhere. There is no -- there's no jury.\nAnd if the judge admits the evidence and if\nit turns out that that doesn't meet the standard of\nreliability, then he can exclude it. I don't -- I don't\nsee why the judge has to say, all right, now, first, I'm\ngoing to do Daubert, and next, I'm going to do whether\nthis is reliable.\nThis is just a magic words approach, it\nseems to me.\nMR. BARNETT: I don't think it is a magic\nword approach at all, Your Honor, because it has\ntremendous significance to people who are actually\nlitigating the case. It's -- I submit that it is\ndisrespectful to a district judge not to object on\nDaubert grounds and then complain that what he did was\ncompletely unusable in the court.\nThey cited Daubert and Rule 702, 50 -- I\nquit counting at 50, but it was only after the -- the\nquestion was reframed not to deal with merits questions,\nbut to deal with Daubert specifically.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I take it there\nis no argument over whether or not the expert is\nqualified.\nMR. BARNETT: Indeed, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The question is just\nwhether his -- his theory makes any sense.\nMR. BARNETT: That's true.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And the -- and the\nPetitioner says it doesn't.\nMR. BARNETT: But, Justice Kennedy, it's\nalso the case that the judge saying, do you have any\nobjections to this witness as an expert, that's about as\nbig an invitation you can get that, if you have got a\nDaubert objection, you better make it now -- you need to\nmake it now.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, Mr. Barnett, I -- I\ncan think of -- my initial reaction -- it has been an\nawful long time since I have been in the courtroom --\nis -- is that that's whether or not this man is -- is\nqualified to give an opinion.\nMR. BARNETT: That was --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Step one. The next\nthing is does this opinion make any sense?\nMR. BARNETT: The second step is using\nthe -- the Court's opinions in Daubert, as well as in\nCarmichael, as well as in Joiner, which the Court has\nheld applies to all kinds of expert testimony in Federal\ncourt. The district judge has an obligation to serve as\na gatekeeper, whether there is a jury in the box or not.\nOn a preliminary injunction, the court, if\nthere is a proper Daubert objection, must make the\nobjection at that time.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. Do you\nthink -- that -- that's why I am trying to get away from\nthe magic words. Why do you disagree with the simple\nproposition that a district court, by whatever magic\nwords it uses, has to come to the conclusion that the\nexpert's testimony is persuasive? And isn't that, at\nbottom line, a judgment that it's reliable and\nprobative?\nMR. BARNETT: I completely agree, Justice\nSotomayor. And we -- we embrace whatever Daubert\nstandard anybody wants to apply retroactively. But the\nmain point is Judge Padova --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you are not\ndisagreeing with your adversary on a legal standard.\nEvery judge on a -- this is the simple way I formulate\nthe rule -- every judge before he certifies -- he or she\ncertifies a class, has to decide whether the methods\nbeing used are probative and relevant, sufficient to\nprove common -- common questions of damages.\nMR. BARNETT: Justice Sotomayor, I agree\nwith that proposition if there is a proper objection\nmade, such that the district court is put on notice that\nhe or she needs to do the work.\nJudge Padova had a 4-day hearing, heard a\nday and a half of Dr. McClave, and then had a separate\nhearing to ask specific questions about, what about,\nwell, there is one of the four mechanisms that the\nanticompetitive conduct translated into sky high prices\nthroughout the Philadelphia DMA.\nJUSTICE ALITO: In this case, why doesn't\nthe question of probative value subsume the Daubert\nquestion?\nMR. BARNETT: I don't think it does, Your\nHonor. And, again, it's not magic words. Trial\nlawyers -- and I have been on this case for almost 10\nyears now -- once you say Daubert or once you say 702 or\nonce you say, I object, it's not reliable, at the time,\ncontemporaneously, the district judge has an opportunity\nto fix whatever the problem is. And the other side has\na chance to fix whatever the problem is, too.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But if the problem is -- let\nme ask my question in a different way. If the problem\nis that the model that is being -- that was used by the\nexpert does not fit the theory of liability that remains\nin the case, would that -- what is the difference in\ndetermining probative value there and determining\nwhether it comes in under Daubert? I don't understand\nit.\nMR. BARNETT: Well, it -- it certainly is\nnot an admissibility question. So, I mean, that's what\nthe question is before the Court. That is definitely\nnot an admissibility question. It's a question of\nprobativeness. And you can analyze it however you want\nto under a clearly erroneous test, which is what applies\nboth under a Daubert standard, as well as a class\ncertification, where the judge is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're -- you are saying\nit's inadmissible if it's inadequately probative, right?\nMR. BARNETT: It --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So the two questions boil\ndown to the same, don't they? If it's inadequately\nprobative, it's inadmissible, isn't that right.\nMR. BARNETT: If -- if you are talking about\nat the hearing for the class certification --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, whenever.\nMR. BARNETT: -- as opposed to a trial.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm talking about what --\nwhat is the criterion for Daubert?\nMR. BARNETT: Daubert --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is it adequately probative?\nIf not, it's inadmissible, so.\nMR. BARNETT: If it is unreliable, then it\nis not admissible.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you want to say -\nMR. BARNETT: It is not adequately or\ninadequately --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You say unreliable. I say\ninadequately probative. It's -- it is unreliable\nbecause it is inadequately probative.\nMR. BARNETT: It's -- okay, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There --\nMR. BARNETT: I am not going to quibble with\nyou about that. But this case -- Comcast, at the heart\nof this appeal, it's Comcast --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Barnett, it's always\ntrue, isn't it, that evidence that is inadequately\nprobative is inadmissible?\nMR. BARNETT: Is it always the case?\nJUSTICE KAGAN: It's always been true,\nright, if evidence is not probative?\nMR. BARNETT: If there is an objection -- if\nthere is an objection, there is a lot of authority --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that's the thing. I\nmean, but have we ever said that -- that without an\nobjection, somebody can say, look, we -- we argued about\nthis evidence, and that should be just good enough, even\nthough we didn't -- we didn't make an objection to\nexclude it?\nMR. BARNETT: I -- I am unaware of any time\nthis Court has said it's okay not to object.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We are -- we are\nhaving an elaborate discussion, and you did in -- in the\nbriefs, about whether or not this was a claim that was\nwaived below. No court has addressed that yet. We're a\ncourt of review, not first view.\nSo it seems to me that one option for the\nCourt, since we did reformulate the question, is to\nanswer the question and then send it back for the court\nto determine whether or not the parties adequately\npreserved that option or not -- that objection or not.\nMR. BARNETT: Your Honor, I agree that\nthat's one of the options that Your Honor has. But of\ncourse, it goes back with all the scuffs and scars and\nmess-ups that preceded it up until today.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, fine. I mean,\nand the district court, presumably, can decide based on\nthe proceedings and all that below, all the scars and\nmess-ups, whether or not it was adequately preserved or\nnot.\nMR. BARNETT: I agree, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI -- I do --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The strongest argument I\nthink for that point of view would be simply this: The\nSmith Company makes widgets. The plaintiff says they\nmonopolize the widget business. That business has\nmonopolized because they achieved the power to raise\nprice above the competitive level through exclusionary\npractices. For example, United Fruit used to pour\ngarbage on the ships of its competitors.\nNow, we have here a class of people who have\nbeen injured by their monopoly power -- and here they\nare, and you give a list. The judge says to the other\nside, how do you know that's the right list? Well, we\nknow; here's how we know. We have an expert here who\nhas used a model to pick out the right people who were\ninjured by the monopoly power -- its exercise. And the\nother side says, no, that model is no good.\nWell, if it genuinely is no good and really\nworthless, then I guess you haven't shown these are the\nright people for the class. And I think that's what\nthey're saying. And so the response to that is, to\nanswer this question, do we have to go look at the\nmodel? I mean, on its face, it seems okay. I don't\nknow. I haven't looked at the record. And --\nMR. BARNETT: I would love to talk about the\nmodel.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Could you talk about that a\nlittle bit, please?\nMR. BARNETT: Yes, I -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Did I get my analysis\nright?\nMR. BARNETT: I would love to talk about\nthis model. This --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. That isn't what I\nwant to really know.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: I want to know -- if you\nthink of the examples I just -- do you, as the\nplaintiff, when you draw up your list of class members,\nhave to have on that list people who really were hurt by\nthe -- or plausibly were hurt by the exercise of market\npower? And you have to have some way of picking them\nout, and you have chosen this model as a way. So I\nguess they could object on the ground that model is\nworthless.\nIs this analysis right? And you would have\nto show, no, it isn't worthless.\nMR. BARNETT: Yes, Your Honor. We do have\nto show that this is a fantastic model, which it is. It\nis --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You don't have to show that\nmuch. I think you only have to show it's a plausible\nmodel.\nMR. BARNETT: All right. I -- I agree. I\nam not going to put the -- I am happy with whatever test\nyou all want to apply is what I'm saying.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BARNETT: This is a good model. And two\nof the basic misconceptions that this case comes into\nthis Court with is, first, that there -- that\nDr. McClave was talking about a causal connection\nbetween the anticompetitive conduct and the damages.\nHe was estimating, whatever the -- whatever\nthe anticompetitive conduct is, whatever the judge or\njury finds is the anticompetitive conduct that accounts\nfor the sky-high prices throughout the Philadelphia\narea -- whatever it is, this is an accurate reflection\nof the damages on a class-wide basis aggregated across\nthe class. The -- Comcast --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He didn't say what --\nthere -- there were four possibilities that he took into\naccount, right, as to what the anticompetitive conduct\nwas?\nMR. BARNETT: And, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And as it turns out, only\none of those was found to -- to be in the game.\nMR. BARNETT: I do want to make sure I -- I\nmake the connection. Dr. Williams was the one who\ntalked about this -- not Dr. McClave. Dr. Williams was\nthe one who said this is the anticompetitive conduct,\nand this is what caused there to be less competition.\nIt was Dr. McClave's job to figure out, well, what's the\nharm to the class as a result of that chain of events?\nYou are right, Your Honor, that --\nJustice Scalia, that Judge -- Judge Padova excluded\nthree of the four mechanisms that Dr. Williams talked\nabout as having a causal connection. And it turns out\nDr. Williams --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That was the basis for the\nclaims.\nMR. BARNETT: It was not, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It was not the basis? His\nwas based only on the one that the court accepted?\nWhere -- where in the record is -- is that?\nMR. BARNETT: His -- his model was agnostic\nabout what the anticompetitive conduct was.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You can't be agnostic about\nwhat the anticompetitive conduct is, if you are going to\ndo -- if you're going to do an analysis of what are the\nconsequences of the -- of the anticompetitive conduct,\nyou have to know the anticompetitive conduct you are\ntalking about.\nMR. BARNETT: Again, I want to make sure I\nam being precise about this, Justice Scalia. There is\nno question that the conduct that caused the harm is the\nclustering behavior that Comcast engaged in over a\ndecade's time.\nWhat is not clear -- was not clear, but is\nnow, because Judge Padova has told us, which of the\nmechanisms that Dr. Williams formulated as possible\ncauses of the -- the possible engines that resulted in\nthe prices going way up.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I guess, in a\nmonopolization case, it is not the case that you have to\ntrace the damages to the exclusionary conduct.\nMR. BARNETT: Exactly.\nJUSTICE BREYER: In a classical class\nof -- Section 2 case, the damages are caused by the\nmonopolization, which lacks skill, foresight, and\nindustry justification. So the fact that he omitted\nthree, but kept one has nothing to do with damages in\na classical Section 2 case, is that right?\nMR. BARNETT: Exactly right, Justice Breyer.\nAnd maybe, if you think of it as the possibility of -- I\nthink of in terms of engines. There is an engine that\nis causing something. Maybe it's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But here is the difficulty\nthat I am having, a little technical, but -- but it --\nthis is a regulated industry.\nMR. BARNETT: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And because it's a\nregulated industry, the regulator, in your view, is\ndoing one of the worst jobs in history. They are\nwilling to come in and overbuild and everything, so he\nmust be letting prices -- all right. Suppose the judge\nor lawyer were to find, that's okay, it doesn't matter,\nall we're interested in is what Justice Scalia says.\nThen, if that were true, from looking at the\nfootnote on this, I guess you'd take this model, and you\nwould simply subtract or add to the base, which is\nsupposed to be the competitively priced districts.\nMR. BARNETT: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The districts that also\nhave satellite.\nMR. BARNETT: Indeed.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that shouldn't be tough\nto do, but I don't know if it's tough to do, and I don't\nsee how we're ever going to find out.\nMR. BARNETT: The record says it can be\ndone. In fact --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't know. How would\nyou answer such a question?\nMR. BARNETT: I would -- would cite you\nto -- let's see if I can find it.\nIt's in -- actually in the court of appeals\nrecord AO 01533 through 34, it is stated there that you\ncan take off of the DBS -- if you don't like the DBS\npenetration screen, then you can turn it off, and\ndamages are still, as we have established since -- when\nComcast -- when they finally did file a Daubert motion,\nwould be something like $550 million on a class-wide\nbasis.\nSo that is in the record, as well as there\nis ample evidence, Exhibit 82, which shows 23 different\niterations of the damages models, including damages\nmodels that Dr. Chipty on the Comcast side put together,\nslicing and dicing all of this data to show that, no\nmatter how you slice it and dice it, almost, if you did\nit in any kind of a fair way that the Federal Judicial\nCenter recognizes as a reliable type of methodology, you\nare going to have significant damages across the class\nfor each class member throughout the time period.\nThe other thing I would like --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Barnett -- I'm sorry.\nGo ahead.\nMR. BARNETT: No, Your Honor. I was about\nto change that subject.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. Then I will.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I am still in search of a\nlegal question that anybody disagrees about here.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KAGAN: You know, I read before the\ndistrict court statement of the standard, now all points\nof the circuit court statement of the standard, where\nthe circuit court says, \"The inquiry for a district\ncourt at the class certification stage is whether the\nplaintiffs have demonstrated\" -- burden is on you -- \"by\na preponderance of the evidence that they will be able\nto measure damages on a class-wide basis using common\nproof.\"\nThe parties both agree with that statement\nof the standard. It seems to me that the parties also\nboth agree -- and this goes back to Justice Sotomayor's\nquestion -- that if the Daubert question had not been\nwaived, that if -- if Comcast had objected to the\nadmissibility of this expert report, that, indeed, the\ncourt would -- should have held a hearing on the\nadmissibility of the expert report.\nSo this is a case where it seems to me that,\nexcept for the question of how good the expert report\nis, none of the parties have any adversarial difference\nas to the appropriate legal standard. And -- you know,\nusually, we decide cases based on disagreements about\nlaw. And here, I can't find one.\nIs there any? Do you disagree with\nMr. Estrada on any statement of the legal standard?\nMR. BARNETT: I -- I do not, Your Honor, and\nI think Justice -- Judge Padova got it exactly right.\nYou read the -- the standard that he applied. In fact,\nif anything, it's a tougher standard than should be the\ntest. But we're -- we embrace that test and we are\nhappy about it, and we don't disagree with Mr. Estrada.\nAnd this is what I was about to change\nsubject to a little bit, the two misconceptions that\nfundamentally affect Comcast's view of the world --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, before you do that,\nlet me ask a question related to what Justice Kagan just\nasked. If we were to answer the question presented as\nreformulated, I take it your answer would be that a\ndistrict court under those circumstances may not certify\na class action; is that right?\nMR. BARNETT: If there is a proper\nobjection, properly and timely presented, it's preserved\nup through the appellate courts and all the things that\nyou need to do in order to be fair to the judge, as well\nas make sure you get it -- give it as good a chance to\nbe right as possible, the answer would be yes. But\nthat's a lot of caveats before you get -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, then the only\nremaining question is whether the issue was in the case\nas a factual -- as a matter of the record here; isn't\nthat right?\nMR. BARNETT: Well, if the issue of\nadmissibility is in the case, I don't think it is. If\nevidence comes in -- again, this is -- this was not a\nbunch of expert reports that were just piled up on\nthe -- in chambers, and Judge Padova went through them.\nHe actually, at their request, had a four-day hearing,\nand then a fifth day, where he posed a series -- I think\nit was a four-page letter where the judge says, I'm\nconcerned about this, I'm concerned about that, y'all\ncome back and tell me why it's okay.\nAnd what --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, could this report be\nprobative if it did not satisfy Daubert?\nMR. BARNETT: The answer, Your Honor -- and\nmy source is Section 274 of Trial and Corpus Juris\nSecundum, well-recognized in this Court, no doubt. It\nsays that, if it's in the record, if it comes in\nunobjected to, it has whatever probative value the\ncourt -- the trier-of-fact chooses to place on it.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That the court as the\ntrier-of-fact chooses to -- that the -- not reserved to\ncases where there's a jury? Is that --\nMR. BARNETT: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that, as I\nindicated before, that the whole question of weight and\nadmissibility is somewhat less important when the trial\njudge is not the gatekeeper. The trial judge, at the\nend of the day, can hear the testimony and say, you\nknow, I admitted this testimony, but it doesn't make any\nsense, it doesn't work.\nMR. BARNETT: What's happening, Your Honor,\nis you have got to satisfy -- Rule 23(b)(3) says the\njudge has to make findings. That's one of the few\nparts of Rule 23 that talks about findings.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, he does what I said,\nbut then he has 100 pages of findings.\nMR. BARNETT: Yes, Your Honor. But he's --\nhe's acting as a gatekeeper, and what he's doing -- or\nshe's doing is projecting, what's this trial going to\nlook like, based on the evidence in front of me?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, I think that's where\nwe disagree. The judge has to make a determination\nthat, in his view, the -- the class can be certified.\nMR. BARNETT: Absolutely. He does. And\nif --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that includes some\nfactual inquiries as -- as to the damages alleged and\nthe cause of the injury and whether or not there is a\ncommon -- whether or not there's a commonality.\nMR. BARNETT: The -- Justice Kennedy, the\ndistrict judge asks, prove to me -- to the plaintiff,\nthat you can prove it at trial, prove to me now that, at\ntrial, you will be able to submit a damages model that\npasses muster, under Daubert or whatever test there is,\ndepending on what the objections are.\nSo the judge is acting in a gatekeeper role,\nright then, kind of projecting into the future about\nwhat am I going to do when the jury's in the box --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's not -- I'll\nthink about it, but that's not my understanding. I\nthought the judge has to make a determination that, in\nthe next case we are going to hear this morning, that\nthe representation is material or it affects the market.\nThe judge has to make that conclusion, make that\nfinding.\nMR. BARNETT: And the finding that the judge\nmakes, based on preponderance of the evidence,\nplaintiffs have shown to me that, more likely than not,\nat trial, plaintiffs will be able to show, on a\nclass-wide basis, some evidence, enough to get a verdict\nthat could be upheld, enough that satisfies to some\nevidence or whatever the test is at trial, that shows\ndamages on a class-wide basis.\nSo the judge isn't saying, this is it, you\ncan't fix it, you can't change it, you can't modify it,\nyou can't enhance it between now and trial. He says\nthat you can do it. You have shown to me -- to my\nsatisfaction, that, more likely than not, that the\nevidence that you will present to the jury at trial is\ngoing to be admissible, and it's going to be\nsufficiently persuasive if the jury chooses to accept\nit.\nAnd this is where -- I really want to get to\nthis about the merits. This -- I think there is a great\ndeal of confusion about what Judge Aldisert meant in the\nThird Circuit when he talked about the merits.\nComcast, each time construes, when he uses\nthe word \"merits,\" talk about incantation of magic\nwords, that that means whether it's good or bad, that\nthat is what Judge Aldisert was talking about. That is\nnot what he was talking about at all. He was talking\nabout trial on the merits. He was saying that, right\nnow, we don't have to decide whether this model is\nperfect. It's enough.\nThe test -- this issue isn't before us\nbecause it's been waived, Daubert and all that, but if\nyou want to know what our observation would be, if this\nwere presented in a proper case, then observation is it\ndoesn't have to be perfect, and it can be enhanced\nbetween now -- which is supposed to happen at an early,\npracticable time -- and trial, so that the jury can see\nit.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, tell me -- you\narticulate for me what you think -- what the district\ncourt found when it accepted your expert's theory as\nadequate.\nMR. BARNETT: What Judge --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What do you think that\nmeans, legally?\nMR. BARNETT: What Judge Padova found was\nthat the McClave damages model is persuasive to him --\nsufficiently persuasive to him, that it could be used at\ntrial to prove damages on a class-wide basis.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so what does\n\"sufficiently persuasive\" mean?\nMR. BARNETT: That more likely than not --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It sounds nice, but more\nlikely than not --\nMR. BARNETT: More likely than not that it\nwill be admissible at trial, and it will meet the\nstandard that's required to get to a verdict. Not that\nit's I'm convinced that you're right. And that's what\nJudge Aldisert was talking about.\nHe said, it's not time for us to say Comcast\nwins or plaintiffs win, based on all this evidence. The\nonly thing that's really before the court is whether,\nmore likely than not, the plaintiffs have presented a\nmodel -- we're talking about a model in this case. It\ncould be a different issue in a different case. In the\nthe Amgen case that's coming up, it could be a different\nissue.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Barnett, this is on a\ndifferent issue, but you had originally suggested that\nyou had -- that the motion -- that the settlement that's\nlooming was a reason that this Court ought not to decide\nthis case. But do you now agree that, given the\ndistrict court's denial of your motion to enforce the\nsettlement, that the proposed settlement has no bearing\non this Court's consideration of the case?\nMR. BARNETT: At this time, Your Honor, I\nthink -- I think it has no bearing on what this Court\ndoes or does not do in this case. It is something that\nwe would have the right to appeal at an appropriate\ntime, but we're not doing that now.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, it -- it\nseems to me that your answer to Justice Sotomayor, which\nis whether it's more likely than not that this will be\nsomething that can be used at trial, one way to capture\nthat is whether or not this evidence is usable, right?\nMR. BARNETT: I would not say that. And\npartly --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: More likely than not\nwhether it can be used at trial, that sounds like, is it\nusable?\nMR. BARNETT: Well, the reason I'm\nhesitating is because --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I know the\nreason you're hesitating.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BARNETT: Well -- and also, it's because\nit's something you don't know. When that word was used,\n\"unusable,\" in court, they were talking about common\nimpact. That's what that was about. That was what that\ndiscussion was about. It wasn't about this model.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, there\nmatters for the trier of fact to determine at the merits\nstage, but under -- under Daubert and under Rule 702,\nthe judge has to say that the evidence is relevant to\nthe task at hand, and it has a reliable foundation. I\ncan see a judge saying, well, now, this theory that\nyou're using, this theory works, I think it's accepted\nin academia. Then he hears all the testimony, and he\nsays, It just doesn't work here.\nMR. BARNETT: And Judge Padova could have\ndone that, but he didn't do that. I think he was\npersuaded by the evidence that Dr. McClave put on, and\nhe rejected -- because we know from his 81-page opinion\nthat he rejected an awful lot of what Comcast's experts\nsaid.\nSo he -- he could have made that\ndetermination. And this is why it's an -- if we're\ntalking -- if we're not dealing just with an\nadmissibility issue that's been forfeited away, we're\ndealing with abuse of discretion and clearly erroneous.\nAnd this is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm -- I'm not sure what I\njust described is not Daubert.\nMR. BARNETT: Your Honor, if you're in a\ntrial court and somebody says Daubert or somebody says\nRule 702 or somebody says I object to this expert's\ntestimony, that has profound significance. And, again,\nI think it's -- it's almost disrespectful to the\ndistrict court to say, it's okay, although this -- this\nquestion wasn't on the test that you had when you were\ntrying to decide the case, we're going to add the\nquestion to the test, and by the way, you flunked it.\nThat's not fair.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, the bottom line\nis can a district court ever say that it's persuaded by\nunreliable or not probative evidence. That's really the\nbottom line question.\nMR. BARNETT: I --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does it commit legal\nerror when it finds something that's unreliable and\nunpersuasive -- or unprobative?\nMR. BARNETT: Well, Your Honor, I agree.\nAnd of course, that's not the issue in the case because\nJudge Padova was convinced it was reliable. And there's\nplenty of proof that there was.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I think that's a\nfair reading of what he said --\nMR. BARNETT: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- but if we're\nanswering a legal question.\nMR. BARNETT: We're talking about the -- the\nedges and all the -- where everything is done properly\nbelow. If it doesn't pass muster under Daubert --\nwhatever the test is, let's not reformulate it here -- I\nsuppose, yes, then it's not admissible.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The problem everyone's\nhaving is -- I think -- that why do you need Daubert to\npoint out that something is not probative or unreliable?\nWhy -- whether it's an expert or a lay witness\ntestifying, wouldn't you apply that same standard to\nanybody's testimony?\nMR. BARNETT: Justice Sotomayor, let me --\nlet me just give you an example. There were a bunch of\nissues that the dissenting judge raised, including the\noverbuilding screen, a particular kind of market screen,\nmathematical averages. If -- in the DBS penetration\nscreen, if he had raised any of those, if there had been\na whisper of a hint of a suggestion, of a thought, of\nthose things in the district court, we'd have been\nall over that. And we would have proved that it was\nfalse, that those -- that those statements are untrue.\nAnd we know that's accurate because, as I\njust read to you from the -- the court of appeals\nrecord, the DBS screen can, in fact, be taken off,\neliminated from the sample, and you still have\n$550 million worth of damages on a class-wide basis.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. --\nMR. BARNETT: And the reason we got to that\nis because they finally did when -- on the eve of trial,\nfile an actual Daubert motion, and that was our\nresponse. And they cited footnote 323 of their brief.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Barnett, suppose -\nsuppose we held that where -- where there's a bench\ntrial, it doesn't make any difference what -- what --\nwhether the judge excludes the evidence under Daubert --\nI never know how to say it. Is it Daubert or Daubert?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BARNETT: It depends on the time of day,\nYour Honor.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I think you're right.\nIt doesn't make a dime's worth of difference whether the\njudge excludes it under -- under Daubert or proceeds to\nfind it simply unreliable -- unreliable. Suppose --\nsuppose we held that. What -- what difference would it\nmake in the world?\nMR. BARNETT: I would --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So the trial judge could\nsay, yes, I have a Daubert motion, but -- but I'm going\nto defer that. I'm just going to -- going to proceed to\nsee whether this evidence is reliable.\nMR. BARNETT: Justice Scalia, I would say\nwhat you're doing is what I suggest the Court ought to\ndo. Everybody knows that district judges have broad\ndiscretion in a lot of different things that they do.\nYou just made it this much bigger as a result of saying,\nwe're not even going to bother with the Daubert thing,\nwe're going to trust that the district judge is not\ngoing to be persuaded by phony evidence, and we're going\nto trust-- if he gets it nearly close, right, that he\ngot it right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Estrada, you have five minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL ESTRADA\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. ESTRADA: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nLet me -- let me start with the proposition\nwhich I continue to find startling, that a damages model\ncan stand up to examination on the theory that it is not\nlinked to any theory of anticompetitive conduct. Now,\nthe theory seems to be that what the McClave model is\nintended to do is to isolate competitive markets\nelsewhere that are competitive in some sense, come to\nthe conclusion that the Philadelphia DMA is somehow less\ncompetitive, and charge whatever the expert says is the\ndifference to Comcast.\nBut that has a fundamental failure, as a\nmatter of substantive antitrust law, because we know\nfrom cases from this Court and the court of appeals\ngoing back to Story Parchment, that the one requirement\nis that causation link of the damages -- you know, it\nhas to be certainly linked to illegal conduct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that right? Is that\nwhat Learned Hand said? Is -- is that what Alcoa holds?\nIs that United Fruit holds when they bomb their\ncompetitor's ship and achieve monopolization? That the\nonly people who can get damages are the people who run\nthe ship and were bombed --\nMR. ESTRADA: No, I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- who bought those\nbananas? I didn't know that. But besides, if you're\nright, which I tend to doubt, but I'll look it up, if\nyou're right --\nMR. ESTRADA: Story Parchment.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, all right. Fine.\nI'll look that up. If you're right and as they pointed\nout, it's still one of the easiest things in the world\nto simply change the base for this model. Instead of\nthe base being those businesses or homeowners who\nreceived their service at competitive prices, we say --\nwe modify it by including those who received services\nwhere DBS was involved, and that'll be a higher price,\nand we subtract that price from the price they paid\nwhere there was overbuilding threatened.\nNow, that'll be a new number. They say it\nwas a new number. And I think anybody running a model\ncould do that, but I promise you, I don't know. And to\nknow whether you're right on that, or they're right, I\nwill have to get into the model-building business, where\nI am not an expert.\nMR. ESTRADA: Well, no. I think all you\nhave to do is whether the proponent -- is to ask whether\nthe proponent of class certification has discharged his\nduty under this Court's cases, to come forward with\nevidence that is persuasive under the point whether the\ncase as a whole can be tried as a class. You don't have\nto become an econometrician. You have to know enough to\nassess whether the record that has been proffered is\nprobative on the question before the Court.\nHere, it isn't. And one of the reasons it\nisn't is because they came to the hearing in class\ncertification in the fall of 2009 after full merits\ndiscovery. The papers -- we said to them, we have full\nmerits discovery, this model does not work. We had\nvariants of not usable. Every word -- I can read it\nall, Justice Kagan, if it's worth taking the time. You\nknow, the flaws preclude its use, it's not to be\naccepted, it's not usable, it does not result in a valid\nmethodology that can be used.\nAnd so, having said all of that, we said,\nthis model is bunk. You have full class merits\ndiscovery. You have plenty of opportunity to come up\nwith a better model. Nothing.\nWe go to the court of appeals. It is\naffirmed. Then it goes back to the -- to the district\ncourt for further trial proceedings. The district\ncourt, having read the court of appeals' opinion,\ninvites them to submit the evolutionary model that the\ncourt of appeals had in mind. Nothing. We are still\nsticking with our story, McClave's the guy.\nAnd so they have had every conceivable\nopportunity to develop a model. Why haven't they done\nthat, Justice Breyer? Oh, maybe because there is a\nproblem in the record. You can take all of the maps in\nthe record, which are part of the field supplemental\nappendix, and you can see the different areas of\npenetration for DBS -- you know, has different rates of\npenetration all over the class area.\nSame thing for RCN and FiOS. And you can\nlook at what -- what the market penetration is in each\nfranchise area. Consider that each of them is a\ndifferent licensing authority, that the overbuilding\nwould have to go to franchise by franchise and radiate\nout in the fullness of time. And I don't know if there\nis an econometrician that can combine all of that into a\nsingle class or subclasses.\nThey haven't identified one. And the key\npoint for the resolution of the case in front of you,\nJustice Kagan, is that the question that comes here is\nwhether a class that is more expansive than the one that\nyou -- that you certified in Wal-Mart can possibly be\ncertified where there is no evidence that is tied to the\nrecord in the case that is reliably probative that a\nclass would exist.\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
