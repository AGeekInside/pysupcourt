        "content": "(11:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear\nargument next in Ledbetter versus Goodyear Tire &\nRubber Company.\nMr. Russell.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL,\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. RUSSELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court.\nA jury found that at the time petitioner\nfiled for charge of discrimination with the EEOC,\nrespondent was paying her less for each week's work\nthan it paid similarly situated male employees and\nthat it did so because of her sex. The question for\nthe Court is whether that present act of disparate\ntreatment because of sex constituted a present\nviolation of Title VII. This Court has already\nanswered that question.\nConsistent with the law's traditional\ntreatment of pay as arising from recurring\ntransactions and giving rise to recurring causes of\naction, and consistent with the paycheck accrual rule\neveryone agrees Congress adopted for the Equal Pay\nAct, this Court in Bazemore versus Friday held under\nTitle VII, each week's paycheck that offers less to\nan employee because of her race or sex --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But are you saying that\nthe rule for paycheck decisions is different than the\nrule for other sorts of decisions?\nMR. RUSSELL: It -- it is. For example,\nthe respondents give the example of promotion\ndecisions but we think that there are analytical and\nwell as practical and historical distinctions that\nCongress, that led Congress to treat pay differently.\nAs a practical matter, while it's always the case or\nalmost always the case that somebody knows they have\nbeen subject to disparate treatment in a promotion\ncase -- they know that they didn't get the promotion\nand somebody else did -- -it is frequently possible\nfor an employee to be subject to disparate pay\nwithout ever knowing that she has been treated\ndifferently than anybody else. And certainly --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That seems to me to work\nthe other way around, just like the case we've just\nheard argued in the last hour. It's a question of\nspecificity here. If the, if the employee, he\nalleges that promotions were based on experience and\nthe employee didn't have the experience because of\npast discrimination, why is that different than the\npaycheck rule? I take it indicates that you would\nnot allow the, a cause of action unless the\ndiscrimination was within the statute of limitations\nperiod?\nMR. RUSSELL: Yes. Yes. A promotion --\ndiscrimination in promotion is different analytically\nthan with discrimination with respect to pay\ndecisions themselves. Because in a promotion\ndecision the employee is deprived of the opportunity\nto take on added responsibilities and therefore earn\nmore pay, but in, but the pay itself is not\ndiscriminatory in the sense of treating people doing\nthe same work differently.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't really see a vast\ndifference between a promotion and being elevated to\na higher pay grade. I mean, there may be no\ndifferent responsibilities but it's a single act of\ndiscrimination: \"No, you're not going to move up to\nthe next pay level.\" I don't see why that's\ndifferent from \"no, you're not going to move up to\nthe next job.\"\nMR. RUSSELL: Because, I think the\ndifference is that when somebody is denied a\npromotion for discriminatory reasons the paychecks\nthemselves are not discriminatory. They treat\nsimilarly situated workers differently.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Russell, I thought\nthat your argument was that yes, you know that you\nhaven't got the promotion, you know you haven't got\nthe transfer, but the spread in the pay is an\nincremental thing. You may think the first year you\ndidn't get a raise, \"well, so be it.\" But you have,\nyou have no reason to think that there is going to be\nthis inequality. I mean she started out getting the\nsame pay, right?\nMR. RUSSELL: Yes, and that practical\ndistinction I think does support Congress's decision\nunder the Equal Pay Act as well as under Title VII to\nchoose a paycheck accrual rule because it's\nfrequently that even if an employee knows she has\nbeen subject to disparate pay, it's frequently very\ndifficult for her to have a good faith belief that\nthat pay is intentionally discriminatory without more\ninformation.\nSo for example, if you look at that chart\non page 174 of the joint appendix, which summarizes\nthe pay decisions for one of the years at issue here,\nif petitioner knew only the pay raise that she got\nthat year, she would know that she got a 5.28 percent\nraise which is not - which is not suspicious. If she\nknew what Mr. Conte had gotten, she would know that\nin fact that pay raise decision decreased the\ndisparity between her pay and Mr. Conte's pay. If\nshe knew what also happened with respect to Mr. Bice\nshe would see he got a higher absolute raise than he\ndid, but she got a bigger one than Todd. It's only\nif petitioner had all of the information in this\nchart, that she would know that that pay raise\ndecision increased the overall disparity between her\nwages and the average wages of men doing the same\njob. And even then the amount of that disparity,\nstanding alone wouldn't provide a sufficient reason\nto go claim intentional discrimination to the EEOC.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How does, how does time\nsolve that difficulty?\nMR. RUSSELL: It's only after -- one would\nexpect in a merit system that there would be some\nlevel of variation in the area and that would work\nout over time. It's only when it doesn't, when the\ndisparity persists, when the different treatment\naccrues again and again and the overall disparity in\nthe wages increases, that the employee has some\nreasonable basis to think that it's not natural\nvariation in the pay decisions but actually\nintentional discrimination.\nIn the paycheck accrual rule that's been\napplied by the lower courts for more than 20 years\nwithout incident, adequately balances the interest of\nemployees and being able to come forward once they\nfind out that there is a reason to suspect\ndiscrimination, with an employer's reasonable\ninterest in avoiding having to defend stale claims.\nI think it's important to note that the\nEqual Pay Act, which everybody agrees has a paycheck\naccrual rule, imposes all of the same burdens on\nemployers that respondents allege would have led\nCongress to never impose a paycheck accrual under\nTitle VII.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What happened to the\nEqual Pay Act claim? You started out with a Title\nVII claim and an equal pay claim and somewhere along\nthe way the equal pay claim dropped out.\nMR. RUSSELL: It did. The magistrate\njudge initially recommended dismissing both the Title\nVII and equal pay claims on the grounds that there\nwas a nondiscriminatory reason for the disparity.\nThe District Courts held that there were fact\ndisputes that precluded that conclusion, but for some\nreason only reinstated the Title VII claim.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why didn't you ask for\nthe equal pay claim? As I understand the magistrate\njudge he said, yes, you had made it across the first\nhurdle, you had a prima facie case. You showed that\nyou're a woman, and you're getting this and all the\nmen are getting much higher. But the employer has\ncome forward with any other factor other than sex and\nthe other factor is that, your inadequate\nperformance.\nMR. RUSSELL: We should have objected to\nthe failure to reinstate the Equal Pay Act claim. We\ndidn't; we didn't think it was that important and the\ntime because we still had the Title VII claim.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Because in the Title\nVII case assuming you're right, that you get across\nthe same threshold, you're faced with the same\ndefense. Right?\nMR. RUSSELL: Yes. It's essentially the\nsame case kind of case in each instance. Although\nthe jury has to find intentional discrimination in\nthe Title VII case; under the Equal Pay Act the jury\nhas to determine whether the employer has shown that\nthe present disparity is the result of some factor\nother than sex. And so in both cases, the jury\nalways has to consider the basis of prior decisions\nthat are the cause of the present disparity.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you have to show that\nat the time when a particular paycheck in question is\nissued, there was an intent to discriminate?\nMR. RUSSELL: No. The execution of a\nprior discriminatory decision constitutes a present\nviolation of Title VII. It's frequently --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if the situation is\nthat when the particular paycheck is cut, the\ncompany, the employer, whoever it is, has no intent\nwhatsoever to discriminate? They think that they are\nissuing this pay on a totally nondiscriminatory\nbasis?\nMR. RUSSELL: It still constitutes a\nviolation because they are executing a present\ndisparity that is because of sex within the meaning\nof the statute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if 15 years\nearlier a discriminatory decision was made to give a\npay raise of 4 percent rather than 5 percent, and\nthat over the 15 years became the basis with other\nraises, you think you can challenge the\ndiscrimination 15 years later and say well, this was\ndiscriminatory because 15 years ago I didn't get a\nraise and that, carried forward, had a ripple effect\ninto the current 180-day period.\nMR. RUSSELL: Yes. That kind of claim\nwould be timely under Section 706. The employer\nwould have an awfully good laches defense.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would that be true if\nthere were a change in ownership of the company, so\nthe discrimination originally occurred under owner A,\nthen the company is purchased by owner B, completely\nunrelated, and the, the disparity is used for\nbonuses, etcetera?\nMR. RUSSELL: That would depend on the\ngeneral rules for attributing a liability from a\nsuccessful --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, under the, under\nthe answer that you gave to the Chief Justice and the\nrule you propose, what of the case of differing\nownership?\nMR. RUSSELL: I would think that they are\nstill responsible in the same way that they are\nresponsible for other actions that the prior company\ntook.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that, but that would\nnot be the result if the reason for the disparity\nbetween 4 percent and 5 percent was not a, a denial\nof a pay increase to a higher pay level, but rather\ndenial of a promotion to another job.\nMR. RICHARDS: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If that were the case,\nthen it washes out and you have to challenge it right\naway.\nMR. RUSSELL: That is correct. And we\nthink --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does that make any sense?\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, I think that it does\nfor the reason that I said before, that that kind of\nconsequence is a secondary effect of the prior\nunlawful employment practice, but under Evans, which\nthat kind of problem goes to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you could call it a\nsecondary effect but the only reason you want to get\npromoted to another job is to get more money. I\nthink it's a primary effect.\nMR. RUSSELL: Well even if the Court\ndidn't think that this is a completely satisfactory\nanalytical line to draw, as I said before there are\ngood practical reasons for drawing it, and every\nreason to think that Congress did draw it, because\nCongress enacted this statute against the background\nlegal principle that pay, that the pay aspects of the\nemployment relationship arise out of recurring\ntransactions and give rise to recurring causes of\naction. And that's the rule that everybody\nacknowledges Congress adopted under the Equal Pay\nAct. And to hold that there is a different rule\nunder Title VII would for example lead to the\nanomalous proposition that Congress intended to\npermit women, a white woman in 1967 to challenge the\npresent disparity in her pay, but not a black man\nunder Title VII because the discrimination there was\nracial. We don't think that Congress intended the\ntwo acts to perform in such dramatically different\nways. In fact --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Congress\ncould have specifically provided for the Equal Pay\nAct rule under Title VII, but it didn't do that.\nMR. RUSSELL: No, it didn't have the same\nelements, but there's no reason to think that the\ndifference in the elements --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It didn't have the same\ndefenses because the Bennett amendment makes the\ndefenses under the Equal Pay Act applicable under\nTitle VII, right?\nMR. RUSSELL: That's right. And as a\nresult the claims and the process of adjudicating\nboth kinds of claims are not significantly different.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose you go back to\nthe 15 year old action which led to disparity that\ncontinues up to today, and suppose at the beginning\nor in July of 2006 the woman discovers it and brings\nher claim and suppose she wins. Now, is it the case\n-- and here I'm uncertain. I thought there was some\nrule in respect to getting damages that you could\nonly go back 2 years?\nMR. RUSSELL: There is a provision of\nTitle VII that limits back pay to at most 2 years.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And in that case would it\nmean that in this case where it happened 15 years ago\nand she won, but she didn't bring her act until\nAugust of 2006, that she could only then collect the\nextra money for the preceding 2 years?\nMR. RUSSELL: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So it isn't going to open\nup tremendous liability for 15 or 20 years ago.\nMR. RUSSELL: That's absolutely right, and\nin fact there's no reason to think that such claims\nare particularly common. This has been the rule in\neffect for 20 years in the lower courts and\nrespondent is unable to show any actual evidence that\nthese kinds of claims are common. But much more\ncommon are instances in which an employee has no\nreasonable basis for filing a charge of\ndiscrimination within 180 days of the disparity.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose all\nthey'd have to do is allege that sometime over the\npast -- I mean, it doesn't have to be 15 years. It\ncould be 40 years, right -- that there was a\ndiscriminatory act, in one of the semi-annual pay\nreviews I was denied this, a raise that I should have\ngotten. It may have been 20 years ago. It may have\nbeen 40 years ago.\nMR. RUSSELL: They can certainly make that\nallegation, but the employer is left open to avail\nitself of the equitable defenses and they'll have a\nvery easy time of showing that there's been undue\ndelay.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where does it say --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is that if\nthey just discovered it? I just learned about what\nhappened 30 years ago at this company and it's -- I\nfiled right away. There's no laches.\nMR. RUSSELL: In that case --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But then they have\nto go back and litigate what happened 30 years ago.\nMR. RUSSELL: I do acknowledge that a\ntraditional laches defense would be more difficult\nthan those --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought your answer\nbefore was that this is not -- if she's going to\nbring a case I got a 2 percent raise, he got a 3\npercent raise, her chances are very slim, but if this\nbuilds up year by year to the point where see is\nsaying, I'm being denied equal pay, it's a\nrequirement of the anti-discrimination law that I get\nequal pay, so today I'm not getting equal pay, I\nthought -- I mean, the chance that she could win when\nshe gets a salary review and she gets a little less\nthan the other person are nil.\nMR. RUSSELL: Yes, and it's only after\nthat same kind of decision has been repeated over a\nnumber of years that you actually have a case that\nyou can bring to the EEOC. But under respondent's\nview by that time it's too late.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not your\ntheory. I mean, if it happened once 20 years ago you\nhave a case that you can bring, isn't it?\nMR. RUSSELL: That's true, but the\npractical --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You've got a memo\nthat says we're going to pay, 20 years ago, we're\ngoing to pay males this much and we're going to pay\nfemales this much, and she says that obviously\naffected my pay over the ensuing 15, 20 years.\nMR. RUSSELL: That's true, but the\npaycheck accrual rule also serves the function of the\nmuch more common case in which somebody doesn't\nderive notice of the potential discrimination until\nthe discrimination has been repeated over time.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But isn't your position\nthat an employer violates Title VII unless the\nemployer periodically reviews the entire pay record\nof every employee to make sure that there has never\nbeen an uncomplained of act of discrimination at any\npoint in the past that would have a continuing\npresent effect on the amount of money that the\nemployee is paid?\nMR. RUSSELL: No. They certainly have an\nincentive to do that under both the Equal Pay Act,\nwhich everybody acknowledges puts the employer\nsubject to liability for any present disparity based\non any prior decision that can't be justified as\nbased on some factor other than sex, and that\nincentive has been around for a very long time and\nrespondents aren't able to show that that's been an\nunmanageable burden. But employers as a matter of\nbasic agency law know from the very beginning whether\nor not they've been paying the plaintiff less because\nof her sex.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: How do they know that?\n10 years ago the employee got a particular, got a\nparticular job evaluation and that dictated the\namount of pay that that employee was going to get for\nthat period and all, all subsequent pay built on that\nbase, and then it turns out many years later that\nthere was discrimination in the way the employee was\nevaluated way back when, even though there was no\ncomplaint about it; then under your theory that would\nbe a present Title VII violation, to cut a paycheck\nthat built, that was based on pay that was built on\nthis act of discrimination that occurred long ago?\nMR. RUSSELL: Because this Court made\nclear as recently Faragher that when an employer\ndelegates pay-setting authority to a supervisor the\ndiscrimination undertaken by that supervisor is\nimputed to the employer as a matter of agency law\nprinciples.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, yeah, but that\nassumed a present discrimination, and it seems to me\nthe problem that we've got is the problem of\nconnecting a past discrimination with what may in\nfact be an apparently neutral act 15 or 20 years\nlater.\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, I don't think that the\nproof that the act is discriminatory is any more\ndifficult or any more difficult in concept when it\nhappened several years ago than when it happened 180\ndays ago. It's still the employer -- the employee\nstill has to show that the present disparity is\nbecause of sex. And the fact that it may be more\ndifficult as a practical matter is something that the\ncourt can take into account under a laches defense.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does he have to know\nthat the present decision to continue the pay\nstructure is discriminatory?\nMR. RUSSELL: No. It's enough that the\nemployer knows as a matter of basic agency law that\nthe petitioner is being paid less because of her sex,\nbecause of prior discriminatory decisions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- as I remember\nthe facts of this case, wasn't it in 1995 that she\ngot a substantial raise and the reason, according to\nher supervisor, was that he noticed that her pay was\nbelow the minimum of the appropriate range for her\njob?\nMR. RUSSELL: That's true. She did get a\nhigher raise that year and that was his testimony.\nHe also testified that he had told her differently,\nthat she had done a very good job that year and\nthat's why she had gotten it, and the jury was\nentitled to believe that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I didn't understand one\nof your answers. Supposing that today the management\ndoes not know of the prior discrimination. Just,\nrecords that have been lost, it happened a long time\nago. But there was evidence that there was a firm\npolicy that women get 20 percent less than men\nforever and it's still -- that policy has continued\nup to date, but that these people making the decision\ntoday did not know that. Would there be liability or\nnot?\nMR. RUSSELL: There would.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I thought you said the\nother. That's why I was --\nMR. RUSSELL: I apologize if I was unclear\nabout that. There would be liability, and basic\nagency law principles impute to the employer those\nprior decisions. So it's not possible for Goodyear\nas a matter of law to claim that it did not know\nabout those decisions when they occurred, and I'm not\naware of any principle of agency law --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the question is\nwhether or not there was a discriminatory act and if\nthe employer, let's say it's an employer that has\njust purchased a business, thinks that it's a neutral\ncriterion to base wages or bonuses or increase on a\nprior pay scale and he doesn't know about the prior\ndiscrimination, why isn't that a defense?\nMR. RUSSELL: It may be a defense. I'm\nnot quite certain how agency law principles apply in\nthat circumstance when there's been a change of\nownership. But certainly when there hasn't been it's\nnot unfair to the employer to say that so long as you\nbase present pay on long past decisions it's your\nresponsibility to make sure that that present pay is\nnot discriminatory.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it's not\nenough presumably for somebody to come in and even up\neverybody? I mean, if you see that the women are\nmaking 20 percent less than the men you don't escape\nliability by paying everybody the same going forward,\nbecause perhaps if nondiscriminatory decisions had\nbeen made the women would have making 20 percent more\nthan the men. You have to go back and revisit every\npay decision or you're exposed to liability for\ncurrent pay.\nMR. RUSSELL: That's true, that they have\nan incentive to do so. They also have that incentive\nconcededly under the Equal Pay Act and nothing in\nthis Court's decision in this case is going to remove\nthat incentive or that burden. And the fact that\nCongress didn't find that burden inappropriate under\nthe Equal Pay Act is good reason to think that\nCongress wouldn't have thought it was inappropriate\nhere.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what is your burden\nto prove? You've talked about their burden to go\nback when -- do I understand it that your view is\nthat the only thing you have to prove is that in this\ncase a woman was being paid at a rate which is\ndifferent from the rate of a man doing a comparable\njob?\nMR. RUSSELL: No, that's not our position.\nWe have to prove in addition that that disparity is\nbecause of sex, which necessarily --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you too then have to\ngo, unless you can find a present policy to\ndiscriminate on sex, you too in your proof have to go\nback whatever it may be, you know, the 15 or 20\nyears?\nMR. RUSSELL: Yes, and the longer that an\nemployee waits the longer it is for her to sustain\nher burden of proof on that score. And in fact --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is that true?\nI mean, it depends. I suppose it may be harder for\nthe company to mount a defense over time, so it may\nbe to her advantage to wait.\nMR. RUSSELL: But if the employer can show\nin fact that there is a disadvantage, that there is\nprejudice, it can ask the court to limit the scope of\nthe claim or eliminate it entirely under an equitable\ndefense such as laches.\nI think it's important to keep in mind\nthat this is not the first time that this Court has\nstruggled with this question when does the unlawful\nemployment practice occur in a disparate pay case.\nThis Court confronted precisely that question in\nBazemore and held that -- and rejected the Fourth\nCircuit's interpretation in that case that the\npresent payment of a disparate wage was simply a\nconsequence and not in itself a present violation of\nTitle VII?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What do you say of the\nexplanation that was given in Bazemore? I forget the\nsubsequent case. It was in footnote 6. You know\nwhat I mean. Which referred to Bazemore as a case\nthat involved a present discrimination which, which\nis inconsistent with your theory. What do you say\nabout footnote 6?\nMR. RUSSELL: I don't think it's\ninconsistent. There was present discrimination.\nThere was, people were being paid less and it was\nbecause of their race. It just so happened that the\nbecause of their race was based on a decision that\nwas made before the effective date of the act. I\ndon't think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the policy -- I\nthought the assumption was that the policy was in\nfact a policy which, which was sort of currently\nhonored and intended to be honored by the company,\nwhereas the case that we're concerned about is the\ncase in which there was a discriminatory act, you\nknow, 5, 10, 15 years ago. Nobody remembers the\ndiscrimination now. It's just that it continues to\nhave these ripple effect consequences. I would have\nthought that the subsequent explanation in Bazemore\nwould have been inconsistent with your position with\nrespect to the current ripple effect.\nMR. RUSSELL: No, I don't think that's an\naccurate description of what was going on in\nBazemore. Recall, for example, that there were\nplaintiffs in Bazemore --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do you take -- I'm\nsorry, I can't think of the name of the case. You\nknow the case that I'm talking about with the\nfootnote?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Lorance?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I guess. Do you think\nthat the Court in the footnote misstated Bazemore and\nthat therefore we should trust to Bazemore and not\nthe subsequent explanation?\nMR. RUSSELL: No. I thought -- I'd take\nthe footnote in Lorance, if that's what you're\nreferring to, to simply say that, like a facially\ndiscriminatory pay policy which discriminates every\ntime it's implemented, a facially discriminatory\nseniority policy that discriminates every time it's\nimplemented, the Court was -- considered in Bazemore\na similar kind of recurring violation because, just\nlike a facially discriminatory policy, a\ndiscriminatory pay structure or pay decision treats\ndifferently -- similarly situated people differently\nevery time it's implemented.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that assumes that the\ncompany in effect says, we have a pay structure and\nour pay structure as it is now treats people\ndifferently depending on sex, race, or whatever. And\nthat's not the kind -- that's something very\ndifferent from the ripple effect argument.\nMR. RUSSELL: I don't think that it is.\nFor example, remember that in Bazemore there were\nplaintiffs, workers who were hired after the merger,\nafter 1965, and when they were hired they were paid\nthe same rate as the white employees, and the\ndisparity in their wages in 1972 arose solely because\nof the discriminatory application of a merit-based\npay raise decision, system, which is exactly the same\nkind of claim that we're making in this case. But\nthis Court nonetheless held that continuing to pay\nworkers, those workers, less than similarly situated\nwhites because of that discrimination that occurred\nbefore the effective date of the act was still a\npresent violation of Title VII.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask this\nquestion. Supposing in the annual review before a\npromotion is concerned the officer making the\nrecommendation was instructed not only to decide what\nincrease would be appropriate but also to review past\nhistory and decide whether or not the employee was\nbeing paid fairly in a nondiscriminatory basis and\nthat was part of the assignment. Would you have a\ncase if that were the case?\nMR. RUSSELL: The plaintiff would be\nrequired to show that that de novo decision was\nintentionally discriminatory.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You couldn't rely on the\npast history in that situation?\nMR. RUSSELL: That's right.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Because I think that's\nsort of what Justice -- Judge Jofla thought was going\non here.\nMR. RUSSELL: I don't think that he -- he\ncouldn't have thought that because the facts are\nabsolutely clear and Goodyear acknowledges in this\nCourt that the pay system that they had in place\nsimply made an annual decision whether to make a\nmarginal increase into the raise and took the prior\nsalary as given.\nIf I could, before I sit down, I'd like to\nmake the point that to the extent the Court doesn't\nthink Bazemore decides this case, and doesn't think\nthat the statute is clear on this question, it should\ndefer to the expert opinion of the EEOC on this\nquestion in which they have particular expertise\nbecause they see thousands of these claims every\nyear. They know better than anybody else whether the\npaycheck accrual rule is unworkable in practice, or\nthat the pay decision accrual rule will lead to the\nelimination of many claims that Congress would have\nintended to preserve. If I could reserve the\nremainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you counsel.\nMr. Nager, we'll hear now from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GLEN D. NAGER\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMR. NAGER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThis Court has repeatedly said that a\nclaim of intentional discrimination is timely and\nactionable only if it concerns intentionally\ndiscriminatory acts taken during Title VII's charge\nfiling period.\nAnd the question presented in this case\nasks the Court to hold that a disparity in pay states\na timely actionable claim for intentional\ndiscrimination if it is merely the result of\nallegedly discriminatory actions taken outside of the\ncharge filing period. The question presented is\ninconsistent with holding after holding of this\nCourt. When Goodyear issued paychecks during the\ncharge filing period, it did not commit intentionally\ndiscriminatory acts. No one at Goodyear took\nMiss Ledbetter's sex into account during the charge\nfiling period in deciding what to pay her.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Nager, can I test\nyour theory with a hypothetical question? Supposing\n20 years ago, there was an actual written policy\nstatement, we pay women 20 percent less than men.\nAnd that was written up and everybody knew it. And\nthen nothing changed for the next 20 years, and the\nperson then sued today. Would she be -- and there\nwas no intent to do anything, this is just the way\nit's always been. Would she have a cause of action?\nMR. NAGER: The answer to that, I think,\nis no, if I understand your hypothetical, if the\nemployer was not intending to classify on the basis\nof gender.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If present intent was\nmerely to do what we have always done, you have to go\nback 20 years to find out that what we have always\ndone is the result of a policy decision made 20 years\nago that we can hire women at a less expense than men\nso we will continue to pay the same rate. Would the\nper paycheck rule apply to that case?\nMR. NAGER: I think the answer is it\nclearly would be untimely insofar as the allegation\nis that there is discrimination today merely because\nthere was discrimination yesterday. Whether or not\nthere is discrimination going on during the charge\nfiling period, whether or not women are intentionally\nbeing treated differently than men, I think the\nanswer, based upon your hypothetical, is no, given\nwhat you've said.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If the employer had a\npolicy of paying women, all women, 20 percent less\nthan men, and it continued that policy, surely it\nwould know in the present day when it issued those\npaychecks that it was paying women less than men. So\nit would be intentionally discriminating at this\ntime, wouldn't it?\nMR. NAGER: Justice Alito, that's why I\nqualified my answer to Justice Stevens, because I\nthink that the question his hypothetical raises, like\nyour question, goes to the sufficiency of evidence\nnecessary to prove intent during the charge filing\nperiod. And I don't want in any way to be heard that\nthere is anything in our position in this case that\ntries to answer that question.\nThe reason I'm not trying to answer that\nquestion in this case is because that question is not\nbefore the Court except with one small respect. If\nthe only thing that the plaintiff is relying upon is\ndiscrimination outside of the charge filing period,\nthat is legally insufficient under this Court's cases\nin Evans, Ricks, Lorance and Machinists before it.\nWhat Bazemore dealt with was a case very\nmuch like your hypothetical, Justice Alito, of an\nallegation of an ongoing racial classification during\nthe actionable time period. And it was because of\nthat allegation of ongoing actionable racial\nclassification and pay that there was both a timely\nclaim, and according to Justice Brennan's opinion for\nall nine members of the Court of that -- in that\ncase, a very serious potential error by the district\ncourt in that case as to whether or not it had been\nclearly erroneous in holding that the United States\nhad failed its proof of proving an ongoing\nintentional race discrimination case --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Nager, why did it\nmake any sense to treat this area any different from\nthe Equal Pay Act.\nMR. NAGER: Because they are two different\nstatutes and the elements of the plaintiff's claims\nare fundamentally different. That's the fundamental\nflaw in the petitioner's claim in this case. Let me\nexplain, if I may, Justice Scalia.\nIn a Title VII case, in an intentional\ndiscrimination case, the question is whether or not\nthere is an act that is motivated by gender during\nthe charge filing period. That is not an element of\nthe plaintiff's cause of action in an Equal Pay Act\ncase.\nIn an Equal Pay Act case, all the\nplaintiff has to do is allege they are performing\nequal work to a male, and that they are paid\ndifferently. And it's that cause of action that\ntriggers the statute of limitations in an Equal Pay\nAct case. That's fundamentally different. As Chief\nJustice Roberts said --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is it different if\nthe one further statement was made. And the employer\nknew that every woman is being paid less than every\nman. Why isn't that sufficient under Title VII, and\nif you want evidence, your own supervisor said, oh,\nwe saw one year that she was outside the range\nappropriate for this job.\nMR. NAGER: Well, knowledge is a necessary\ncondition, but it's not a sufficient condition,\nJustice Ginsburg. In Evans, the employer knew it\npreviously had a sexual -- a gender-based\ndiscriminatory policy about whether or not female\nflight attendants could work after they got married.\nBut that prior knowledge of prior discrimination by\nthe employer wasn't sufficient to make the neutral\naction taken --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Evans involved a factor\nthat simply is not present here. I mean, Evans\ninvolved a seniority system. And if this person who\nhad been off the job were to come back two years\nlater, and bump people who had been there every day,\nwell, certainly that's a different case than this\none, where she is saying, I should have been paid\nequally. I wasn't. And I know I can go back only\ntwo years. That's quite a bit different than the\nEvans situation.\nMR. NAGER: Justice Ginsburg, Title VII\nallows proof of dissimilar treatment as evidence of\npresent intentional discrimination, but it's not the\nelements of the claim. As Chief Justice Roberts was\npointing out, Title VII would prohibit paying a woman\nthe same amount as a male if the employer would have\npaid the female more because she had a -- more\ndegrees or other criteria that the employer\nordinarily took into account.\nThe elements of those two claims are\nfundamentally different. What makes this case\nuntimely and unactionable is that there is no claim\nand there can be no claim because it's the law of the\ncase that Goodyear took Miss Ledbetter's sex into\naccount during the charge filing period.\nWhat Goodyear did was the same kind of\nneutral rule as in Evans. What Goodyear did was it\nsaid, we are looking at the pay rate contained in our\npayroll system, and applying those rates as they are\nmandated for all of our employees, male or female.\nAnd what Goodyear did at the beginning of each\nevaluation period was say, we are starting this\npayroll period with the pay rates that were paid in\nthe last period for all of our employees, male or\nfemale, no matter what their prior causes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If only the 180 day\nperiod counts, and she can complain only about\ndiscrimination in that period, then how do you\naccount for her being able to go back not 180 days,\nbut two years for her remedy?\nMR. NAGER: The two-year rule is only a\ndamages rule that applies only in Title VII cases.\nAnd it's triggered in cases such as where there has\nbeen equitable tolling or equitable estoppel, because\nthe employer -- it was a promotion case or a pay case\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought it was the\nlid on the amount of compensation you could get in\nTitle VII cases. You can't go back more than two\nyears for damages. But it would seem that doesn't\nfit at all whether you can go back only 180 days.\nMR. NAGER: No. What the 180 days is for\nis determining the time period during which the\nallegedly illegal act must occur. That period can be\ntolled using a tolling rule. It can tolled for three\nyears possibly. The back pay rule says, even if you\ntolled the statute of limitations for more than the\ntwo-year back pay period, you can only get back pay\nfor two years. What is going on, of course, in this\ncase, is they are trying to use allegedly\ndiscriminatory acts that occurred 10, 15, 20 years\nago, both to make neutral acts actionable, and to get\ncompensatory and punitive damages.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is she claiming\nthat in 1995, a supervisor recognized that my pay was\nway out of line. Isn't that what the supervisor\ntestified?\nMR. NAGER: He did. And he said he raised\nher pay up the maximum amount he was entitled to that\nyear. And she didn't file a charge of discrimination\nin 1995.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Maybe she thought that,\nwell, they are on the right track. Next year, they\nare going to raise me up to the equal pay level.\nMR. NAGER: And what the purpose of the\ncharge filing requirement under Title VII, as this\nCourt has repeatedly said, is to require that\nemployee to come forward promptly within 180 days of\nthe date that the alleged unlawful employment action\nis communicated to her, and bring that claim or lose\nit, that the purpose of Section 706 was to create\nrepose.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The question that I\nasked Mr. Nager that I think is really important, and\nthat is, where do you put these pay cases? Do you\nput it in the box with the hostile environment that\nbuilds up over time, and as long as the environment\nis hostile at the time you bring your complaint, then\nit doesn't matter that it started 20 years ago. This\nnotion of one year, it's 2 percent, and the other\nperson got 3 percent, you really don't have an\neffective claim unless it builds up to the point\nwhere there is a noticeable disparity.\nMR. NAGER: Justice Ginsburg, the\npetitioner in this case has agreed with us that this\nis the kind of discrete employment action that\ntriggers the 180-day period. It is not like a sexual\nharassment claim.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where is that\nagreement?\nMR. NAGER: It's in their brief. They\nrepeatedly quote the portion of Morgan which\ndescribed pay claims as discrete acts subject to the\ndiscrete trigger rule in the Morgan opinion. And\nthat, of course, is an obvious concession that they\nhad to make in this case, because Mr. Russell would\nnot concede when Justice Scalia asked that that first\npay rate decision was not an identifiable act, that\nit wasn't an actionable -- immediately actionable\nclaim.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that the\nMorgan decision quotes Bazemore for saying, under\nTitle VII, each week's paycheck that delivered less\nto a black than to a similarly situated white is a\nwrong, actionable under Title VII.\nMR. NAGER: And that's in the portion of\nthe opinion that's dealing with discrete employment\naction. It's not in the portion of the opinion\ndealing with sexual harassment claims. I'm trying to\nanswer your question about which portion of Morgan\npay claims fall into.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Whatever portion it's\nin, it says each week's paycheck that delivered less\nto a black than to a similarly situated white is a\nwrong, actionable --\nMR. NAGER: Because Justice Thomas'\nopinion was accurately describing the holding in\nBazemore on the facts of Bazemore, because in\nBazemore there was a claim, in contrast to this case,\nof ongoing intentional race discrimination in\nclassifying employees on the basis of their race and\npaying the black employees less than the whites. If\nthe Court would look at the remand order in the\nBazemore case, they'll see that the Court did not\nremand with instructions that judgment be entered for\nthe United States merely because there was a\ndisparity in salaries.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Justice Brennan's opinion\nsounds to me, part one, as if he is saying what the\nmistake was that the company made here is that they\ndidn't really eradicate the effects of the past bad\nact, and they were trying to eradicate it.\nMR. NAGER: Well, actually, the United\nStates' allegations in the case were trying --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's another part of\nthe case that's part two and part three about the\nevidence that came in. In fact, there are about six\nother parts. I'm just talking about part one.\nMR. NAGER: That's part one.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. All right. So I\nread that. Now, this is my this is my cost/benefit\nanalysis here. If we follow the other side's rule,\nit's very simple, we just said Bazemore applies,\nwhether there's a practice or whether it was a\ndiscrete thing, or whatever, so it's simple. But we\ndo have to distinguish pay from the other kinds of\nthings. And we have heard them explain why there is\na distinction. I'd rather get to your side and then\nyou can attack both, or whatever.\nYour side of it, it seems to me, if I\nagree to you, I now have to create in the law some\nkind of thing that sounds very complicated about\nwhether that old bad thing was somehow a pattern or a\npractice that, as a pattern or a practice, didn't get\neradicated within the last few years, or was a\ntotally discrete act, and therefore, had no\nimplication as a pattern or practice that didn't get\neradicated. That sounds hard.\nAnd the second thing I guess I'd have to\ndo is to create a lot of tolling law because there\nwill be probably a significant number of\ncircumstances where a woman is being paid less, and\nall she does is for the last six months get her\npaychecks and she doesn't really know it because pay\nis a complicated thing, and through no fault of her\nown, it takes about eight or nine months or even a\nyear for her to find out. And we are going to have\nto toll, aren't we?\nSo I have, legally speaking, a complicated\ntolling system that I have to graft on to this, your\ncase. I also have to start distinguishing Bazemore\nwhich is pretty hard to do. But on the other side,\nthey are just saying, go with the flow. Nobody is\nreally hurt, because the employer has to worry about\nall this stuff anyway under the Equal Pay Act. I'm\ngiving you that summary so you can just shoot it\ndown.\nMR. NAGER: Well, it was a compound\nquestion, but I'll try to answer each of its parts.\nThe first point I would make is that\nBazemore came after Evans and Hazelwood and Ricks,\nand it did not distinguish Evans or Hazelwood or\nRicks on the grounds that Bazemore is a pay case and\nHazelwood and Evans were not pay cases. It\ndistinguished them on the grounds of whether or not\nthe alleged discrimination was taking place in the\ncharge filing period. So this notion that Bazemore\nstands as a proposition that Evans and Lorance and\nthat line of cases doesn't apply because they don't\napply to pay cases was not the opinion of the Court\nin Bazemore.\nSecondly, we are not asking you, and I\ndon't think it takes any difficulty to apply the rule\nthat we are proposing in this case. We are proposing\nthe same rule that's set forth in Justice Stevens'\nopinion for the Court in Evans, the same rule that's\nset forth in Justice Powell's opinion in Ricks, the\nsame rule that's set forward in Justice Scalia's\nopinion for the Court in Lorance.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But there is a slight\ndifference in that you're focused on whether\ndiscrimination occurred within the 180-day period.\nAnd if I understand you correctly, discrimination\nwould have occurred during the 180-day period if the\nemployer knew of the policy that I described, because\nthen he would be knowingly paying less.\nMR. NAGER: No. Not if he had knowledge\nof --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I thought your answer to\nJustice Alito made that point.\nMR. NAGER: Well, what I said to Justice\nAlito was, if the employer knew that it previously\nhad a policy and if it knew and intended that its\npresent pay would be done for gender-related reasons\nor racially-related reasons, it would constitute --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the question of\nwhether just knowing that that's a source of the\npolicy would be a gender-related reason.\nMR. NAGER: Well, the question is whether\nthere was a present policy. That's the point the\nSolicitor General makes in its brief and the point we\nmake in our brief.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, in my hypothetical\nthere was a policy established 20 years ago, a 20\npercent differential, never been changed. And the\nonly question that would differ, in some cases the\nemployer knows about it and in some others he\ndoesn't.\nMR. NAGER: And if the employer is\npresently applying, and knowingly and intentionally\ndoing so, a 20 percent differential for male and\nfemale employees for no reason other than the gender\nof the employees, that's a present violation.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, what his reason\nis, this is always the way we did it. That's his\nreason.\nMR. NAGER: Well, if what he's saying is,\nthe way we have always done it is engage in gender\ndiscrimination, then doing it in the present time\nperiod would state a present claim.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But suppose he has no\nintent to discriminate as a present matter, but he\nalso knows that his decision is necessarily based on\na policy that was discriminatory some years ago.\nWhat result?\nMR. NAGER: I think if I understood the\nquestion, Justice Kennedy, I think no present claim,\nbecause the only thing you said that he knew is that\nthey previously engaged in discriminatory actions.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: He knows it, but his\npresent decision is necessarily based on some prior\ndecision that was discriminatory.\nMR. NAGER: That in and of itself is not\nsufficient. That's the point that, the seniority\nsystem in Lorance was necessarily based upon an\nearlier decision that the employer --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: How is that -- how is\nthat consistent with the statement in Bazemore that\nthe employer has a duty to eradicate past\ndiscrimination?\nMR. NAGER: Well, the duty was to\neradicate the alleged ongoing facially discriminatory\npay practices that preceded the enactment of Title\nVII and were alleged to have been maintained for\nracially purposeful reasons after Title VII became\neffective to a public employer. There is no\ncontemplation in that case that that duty would\nrequire an employer to investigate discrete\nemployment decisions made in years gone by that\nweren't made the subject of a timely charge. What\nthis Court has said repeatedly is when the charge\nfiling period passes and no charge is brought, the\nemployer is entitled to treat that past act as if it\nwas a lawful act. That's what Justice Thomas'\nopinion in Morgan says. That's what, the opinion\nthat Justice Stevens wrote for the Court in Evans.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is that so even if they\nknow it was in fact originally an unlawful act?\nMR. NAGER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You draw a line between\npresent purposeful discrimination and present\nknowledge of past discrimination which is knowingly\ncarried forward.\nMR. NAGER: That's correct. Because the\npurpose of Section 706(e) is to give repose for those\npast decisions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you describe\ndealing with a case like Manhart where they were\ncomplaining about a pension plan that had been\ninstituted, oh, way longer than 180 days, years and\nyears before?\nMR. NAGER: That plan was facially\ndiscriminatory. It included on the face of the plan\ngender-based mortality tables. And as Justice\nScalia's opinion for the Court in Lorance and the\nfootnote that Justice Souter pointed out to, a\nfacially discriminatory policy necessarily evidences\npresent intent each time it is applied, and that is\nthe important distinction. On the one hand you have\ncases that are both timely and as a matter of law\nshow present intent because they are facially\ndiscriminatory. On the other end of the continuum\nyou have cases that are only about past\ndiscrimination and do not involve any present\nactionable claim of intentional discrimination, and\nthey are both untimely and legally insufficient. And\nthen you have the cases in the middle which concern\npresent allegations of discriminatory practices so\nobnoxious, as alleged in Bazemore, that the Court\nheld that district court may have been clearly\nerroneous in its conclusion that there was no present\nintentional discrimination.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Nager. Mr. Gornstein?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. NAGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nTitle VII gives employees like petitioner\n180 days to challenge an individual pay decision such\nas a denial of a pay raise. Employees who allow the\n180-day period to pass may not years later and even\nat the end of their careers challenge their current\npaychecks on the grounds that they are the result of\na number of discrete individually discriminatory pay\ndecisions that occurred long ago.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This would be a good\nEqual Pay Act case, wouldn't it?\nMR. NAGER: If it met the requirements of\nthe Equal Pay Act, which is that it has to be the\nsame knowledge, skills and responsibilities and\neffort for the job, then every time that you have a\nfailure to deliver equal pay for equal work there is\na violation of the act. But Title VII is not an\nequal pay for equal work statute, it is a\nnondiscrimination statute, and so that you have to\nshow intentional discrimination in pay, not just the\nabsence of equal pay.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why doesn't it become\nintentional, at least after 1995, when the supervisor\nrecognizes that he's got an employee that is out of\nthe appropriate range for her job, whether she does\nit badly or well?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Justice Ginsburg, if an\nemployee brought a claim within 180 days of the\ndecision made then, that is to not, to not equalize\nthe pay further --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why would she bring it\nthen? They gave her a big raise that year.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Well, because I think what\nyou're suggesting is they didn't give her a big\nenough raise, because there was still intentional\ndiscrimination from prior years that were not, that\nwere unchallenged.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Didn't she have every\nreason to expect, well, they finally noticed it, so\nnext year I'm going to get that same size raise, but\nthat it doesn't happen the next year?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: And if it doesn't happen\nthat next year, then that employee has 180 days to\nchallenge that pay decision on the ground that it's\nintentionally discriminatory. If she does not do\nthat, she cannot come back 15 years later and say\nthat a decision that was made 15 years ago and 14\nyears ago were based on my gender, and they --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: She is not talking\nabout a decision made 15 or 14 in this case. She\nstarts out even, and it builds up over time.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Well, I think in some, in\nsome cases that, pay cases, it will build up over\ntime. In some cases it will happen immediately. But\nin either case, what Title VII says is that you have\n180 days to challenge a discrete pay decision. If\nyou do not do that, you cannot come back later, years\nlater, four years later, six years later, or here at\nthe end of her career, and challenge every pay\ndecision that's been made up until then on the\ngrounds that intent, it was intentionally\ndiscriminatory and continues to have ongoing effects.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you could if the\nperson making the decision was aware of the\ndiscriminatory policy.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Knowledge of prior\nunlawful acts is relevant evidence in deciding\nwhether it's present day intentional discrimination.\nBut just as in a case where there's a promotion and\nI'm aware that there was a prior discrimination in a\npromotion and that was not timely challenged, and the\nperson comes to me today and says I want my promotion\nnow. If I'm aware that she was denied that promotion\nfor discriminatory reason but she did not timely\nchallenge it, my decision not to give her that\npromotion is not automatically discriminatory.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you're changing the\nhypothetical. My hypothetical was simply a pay case.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: I understand that, and I'm\nsaying the same rule applies in a pay case that\napplies in a promotion case.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You're saying, I think\ncontrary to your colleague if I remember correctly,\nthat even if the employer knew of the 20 percent\ndifferential policy established 20 years ago, it\ncould still carry it into effect today.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: What I'm saying with\nrespect to a policy is if you have an ongoing policy\nthat is still being applied in the limitations\nperiod, and that your current policy is to pay less\nto women than to men, then of course you can sue.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let's say it's the\nsame person who made the decision. You know, five\nyears ago he said I'm giving a 6 percent raise to\nmen, I'm giving a 3 percent raise to women, and then\nhe decides that's illegal, and so from now on\neverybody is going to get a 4 percent raise every\nyear if you meet certain standards. Is that ongoing\ndiscrimination or is that a neutral thing, that he\ndoesn't have to take into account the past\ndiscrimination?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: That's a neutral discrete\nact that was made at the time. It was not\nchallenged.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though he\nknows that it carries forward the illegal\ndiscrimination?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Even when the employer --\nyou can have an inference from knowledge of past\nillegal conduct that your present intent is to carry\nforward that differential based on the person's sex,\nbut it is not an automatic inference. You can also,\nthe employer could say look, that was a decision that\noccurred a while ago. A lot of people did this.\nThere were decisions made that affected a lot of\nother people --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you're talking\nabout --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: -- and I didn't correct\nthose either, and that's a neutral policy.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's a defense.\nAnd you're talking about, yes, you might draw that\ninference but that inference would be wrong because I\nhave a defense. The defense is poor performance\nexplains it, not sex discrimination.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: But under Title VII, poor\nperformance isn't a defense. It is negating\nintentional discrimination. It's the employer's\nemployee's burden --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought at least in\nthis area, the defenses were the same as under the\nEqual Pay Act.\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, there are -- there is\nan additional layer of defense, but still the\nemployee has to prove an additional element in a\nTitle VII claim, not just the absence of equal pay\nfor equal work, it has to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Gornstein, why should\nwe listen to the Solicitor General rather than the\nEEOC? I mean, they have taken a different position\nfrom the one that you're urging upon us.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: The EEOC has taken a\ndifferent position but that decision that the EEOC\nhas taken has been based on its reading of this\nCourt's decision in Bazemore, and this Court does not\ngive deference to the EEOC under Skidmore or under\nany other standard.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So why don't we at\nleast hear from the EEOC? That has happened in other\ncases where the Department of Justice and the EEOC\ntake different positions, at least the EEOC filed a\nbrief even though it wasn't the Government's brief.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: That has occasionally\nhappened in the past. It has not happened as a\nregular matter, or to my knowledge it does not\nordinarily occur. The EEOC --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If the EEOC is upheld in\nthe Court of Appeals and review is sought here, will\nthe Government confess error?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: I'm sorry, Justice Souter?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If the EEOC decision is\nupheld by one of the Courts of Appeals and there is\nan attempt to bring the case here on cert, will the\nGovernment confess error?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: If the Court rules in the\nGovernment's favor in this case, then that case would\nhave to be vacated and remanded for reconsideration\nin light of this Court's decision today. The EEOC's\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I'm asking a\nsimpler question. Let's assume that somehow we fudge\nit. If -- if there is a clear cut case in which the\nEEOC takes a position different from the one the\nGovernment is now espousing, and a Court of Appeals\nupholds it, and cert is sought here, will the\nSolicitor General say please remand, or simply\nconfess judgment?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Justice Souter, I would\nlike to answer that question today but of course if\nthe Court doesn't resolve the question today that's\nbeen decided today, but issues a new decision,\nanything we would have to do would have to look at\nthat new decision and make a judgment about what the\nlaw is at that time. And so my -- my point is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I think I got your point.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Touche.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: To go on, there are three\ndecisions of this Court that control the result here,\nEvans, Ricks and Lorance, each of which says that the\nemployee cannot circumvent the limitations period by\nchallenging conduct within the limitations period on\nthe grounds that it is the result of a prior act of\nintentional discrimination that was not timely\nchallenged.\nA second reason to reject petitioner's\nrule is that petitioner's rule, as petitioner admits,\ncreates a special rule for pay cases when there is\nnothing in the language of Title VII that would\njustify a special rule. Title VII has the same\nmandate of nondiscrimination for pay as for any other\npractice. It has the same 180-day period for pay\nclaims as any other claim.\nAnd the third reason to reject\npetitioner's view is that it would undo the statute\nof limitations in pay cases, because the result would\nbe, what you have here is that an employee could wait\nuntil the end of their career, or at least a very\nsubstantial number of years, and then challenge\ncurrent pay on the basis of past acts that took place\na long time ago. And Justice Breyer, you talked\nabout it being limited to just back pay during the\ntwo-year period. The courts that have looked at this\nhave not decided whether it's the 180-day period or\nthe two-year period if you buy petitioner's theory, I\ndon't think he has either. But the important\nadditional point of order is you're still hinging\nliability on past acts long ago and you're adding the\npossibility of compensatory relief and punitive\ndamages, so it's not the limited damage award that\nyou're contemplating necessarily.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What would you do on the\nother side of this? It if you win on this, then\ndon't you have to have a fairly relaxed standard of\nallowing the woman, tolling or something, when she\njust gets some paychecks that would take her a while\nto figure out that these are really reflecting some\nold discrimination and she doesn't know. It's\ndifferent in that respect from the promotion itself.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Well in some -- if she's\ndenied a pay raise and she's aware that other people\nare getting substantial pay raises -- I don't think\nit's that much different than somebody else getting\nthe promotion and me not getting that promotion.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, she knows this.\nShe knows that, all these boxes on her paychecks and\nshe's not quite sure what they mean. All right, your\nanswer is not much different.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Well, to the extent that\nyou want to address equitable tolling. That's the\nquestion, should there be equitable tolling until\nsuch time as she's aware of the disparity. But what\npetitioner's theory does is says even after the\nemployee is aware of the disparity she can wait 15\nmore years and then sue.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\ncounsel.\nMr. Russell, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. RUSSELL: I think the fundamental\ndisagreement in this case comes down to what is the\nunlawful employment practice Congress was referring\nto when it prohibited discrimination with respect to\ncompensation. If it is under our view, in our view,\nthe payment of an intentionally disparate wage, then\nthere's no question that under Bazemore the violation\noccurred during the limitations period. The fact\nthat the intent was formed outside the limitations\nperiod doesn't make the present payment of a\ndisparate wage because of sex any less intentionally\ndiscriminatory. But the difference in the\nconceptions, which frankly isn't answered by the\nplain text of this statute itself, should be resolved\nin light of the practical consequences of the\ndifferences in the rules.\nThe Solicitor General acknowledges that a\npaycheck accrual rule applies at least in a case of a\npolicy of discrimination, but that's a very difficult\nrule to administer for the EEOC, which must make a\ndetermination of timeliness before it even has\nauthority to investigate a claim. It shouldn't be\nleft to the EEOC to figure out whether there's an\nunwritten practice or an unwritten policy which would\nrequire an extensive investigation not only of the\npetitioner's pay but of everybody else's. You recall\nthat in Bazemore they had to conduct a multiple\nregression analysis to establish a pattern of\ndiscrimination there.\nOur rule is simple to administer and has\nbeen administered for decades in the lower courts and\nit's the rule that the EEOC itself has chosen in\nconstruing this ambiguous aspect of the statute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you agree that their\naction is just based on Bazemore or their reading of\nBazemore?\nMR. RUSSELL: No, that's incorrect. I\nmean, the EEOC has taken this position that you can\nchallenge present pay disparities even before the\nCourt's decision in Bazemore and it continued to\nadhere to it afterward. The fact that they cited to\nBazemore shouldn't disentitle them to the kind of\ndeference that they're ordinarily entitled to when\nthey construe a statute that's given to them, and\nthis is precisely the kind of question Congress would\nhave entitled them to exercise their expertise on.\nFinally, I would like to raise the point\nthat under respondent's rule the Extension Service\nwould have been permitted to pay blacks less than\nwhite in perpetuity in Bazemore so long as it did so\nbecause of cost and not because it wanted to continue\nto discriminate on the basis of race. And similarly,\nunder the Solicitor General's view an employer who\nhad intentionally discriminated through discrete\ndecisions against some of its employees prior to the\nact would be allowed to continue to do so after the\nact because the decision would have been the\npotentially unlawful act in that case and that\nwouldn't have been actionable.\nWe respectfully suggest that Congress\nintended nothing than a complete --\nJUSTICE ALITO: How could cost justify a\ndual pay scale?\nMR. RUSSELL: It could -- the Extension\nService --\nJUSTICE ALITO: You'd have to have another\nfactor in the decision, which was that you didn't\nwant to change pay. But cost alone couldn't justify\nthat.\nMR. RUSSELL: It would be a\nnondiscriminatory reason. They would -- they would\nsay that, the reason we didn't immediately equalize\nsalaries is because it cost too much, it would have\nrequired -- we'd be required to cut down on our\nprograms. And under respondent's view that is not\nintentionally pay-maintaining discrimination.\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, you'd have to say, we\ndon't want to spend any more and we also don't want\nto equalize pay. You have to say the second too.\nMR. RUSSELL: They would say, we don't\nwant to equalize pay because it costs too much, and\nthat's not a discriminatory reason for maintaining\nthe prior disparity. But ultimately --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If you say you're not\ngoing to equalize pay, you're saying you're going to\ndiscriminate on the basis of race.\nMR. RUSSELL: Which is what happened here.\nGoodyear continued to discriminate on the basis of\nsex, knowing as a matter of agency law that it had\ndone, it had set her pay for discriminatory reasons\nin the past.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can equalize\npay by lowering others. You don't -- raising the\ndiscriminated-against class is not the only way to\nequalize pay. So I don't see how cost is a\njustification for continuing the disparity.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Not under the Equal Pay\nAct. You can only equalize up, not down.\nMR. RUSSELL: That's true.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under Title VII\nyou can equalize either way, right?\nMR. RUSSELL: It would, but if they chose\nnot to equalize at all because they don't want to\nspend the money the money that would be a\nnondiscriminatory reason.\nJUSTICE ALITO: You'd certainly have a\nvery happy work force if you equalized one way.\nMR. RUSSELL: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\ncounsel.\n"
