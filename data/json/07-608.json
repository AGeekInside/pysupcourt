        "content": "(10:53 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Case 07-608, United States v. Hayes.\nMs. Saharsky.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. SAHARSKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nRespondent's conviction for battering his\nwife is a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\nprimarily for two reasons: First, the statutory text is\nmost naturally read that way. Second, a contrary\nreading would defeat Congress's purposes.\nNine courts of appeals have determined that the text\ndoes not require a domestic relationship to be an\nelement to the predicate offense. That's because the\nstatute's text uses only one element, using the singular\nword \"element,\" which relates to mode of aggression. It\nthen introduces a new concept related to domestic\nrelationship, using a comma and the word \"committed.\"\nThe word \"committed\" naturally modifies the word\n\"offense.\" In common usage, a person commits an\noffense; he doesn't commit a use or attempted use of\nphysical force.\nUnder Respondent's reading of the statute, when it was\nenacted it would have become immediately a dead letter\nin two-thirds of the States, and it wouldn't have any\napplication to the Federal Government. And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, Respondent says that\nmay be because a lot of people in Congress wanted it to\nbe a dead letter. They would have wanted the whole\nthing to be a dead letter. There are a lot of people\nwho didn't like this statute because it was a gun\ncontrol statute.\nMS. SAHARSKY: But Congress did act this\nstatute, and this Court presumes two things: First --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if it's a compromise\nwith the people who wanted no statute at all and you\ncome out with a statute that covers one-third of the\nStates anyway, I mean that's, you know -- that's the\ndeal.\nMS. SAHARSKY: There was a compromise made,\nbut it wasn't with respect to whether there needed to be\na domestic relationship element. It was with respect to\nhow violent the offense had to be.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How do we know -- how do we\nknow that?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, if you look at the\nstatute's drafting history, there were two versions\nconsidered. One used the term \"crime of violence\" to\ndiscuss how violent the statute had to be, and then the\nsecond substituted in the new language: \"...has as an\nelement the use or attempted use of physical force or\nthreatened use of a deadly weapon.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it also substituted\nthis structure that we are -- that we are discussing\ntoday. Didn't that come in at the same time?\nMS. SAHARSKY: The --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, why -- why say it's\nonly the former provision that was the compromise and\nnot the addition of this later language?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Both the original structure\nand the statute as enacted had the same structure in\nthat they had a \"committed by\" clause that modified the\nword \"offense.\"\nNow, it's true that the use -- \"has as an\nelement language\" that came in added some additional\nstructure in terms of the Romanette (i) and the\nRomanette (ii), but that all came in because there was a\ndiscussion about how violent the offense had to be, both\n-- in the original statute that was considered, you have\nan offense committed by a certain person, an offense of\na certain type committed by a certain person, and in the\nstatute that was enacted you have an offense of a\ncertain type committed by a certain person. Now,\nCongress put more detail in, in terms of what that\ncertain type of offense is. This has as an \"element\"\nlanguage, but it just didn't go to domestic\nrelationship.\nAnd to get back to one of the earlier points\nin your question, you know, this Court presumes when\nCongress passes a statute two things are true: First,\nit knows the legal backdrop on which it enacts the law;\nand second, that it's presumed that its law is going to\nhave effect. And that should be especially true here\nwhere Congress was dealing with a serious nationwide\nproblem of domestic violence using firearms. Congress\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The suggestion was that\nCongress may have wanted to give an incentive to States\nto have special domestic violence statutes instead of\npunishing domestic abusers under a generic battery\nstatute.\nMS. SAHARSKY: I don't think that makes\nsense for two reasons: First, because when Congress\nwants to do that, it uses its spending power to give the\nStates incentives to do things like that, and it did\nthat in the VAWA enactment in 1994 and in VAWA\nre-authorization in 2005.\nAnd, second, because if you believe what\nRespondents suggest, you would have to think that a\nCongress that was very concerned about the powder keg\nsituation of a domestic offender with a gun would want\nto exempt domestic offenders who have proven that they\nare willing to hurt family members in two-thirds of the\nStates, a Congress that was presumed -- that was\nconcerned with the problem of domestic violence would\nenact a statute that would apply so infrequently, to at\nmost these 17 States, and wouldn't apply at all to\nFederal offenses, making that \"misdemeanor under Federal\nlaw\" language superfluous.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I\nunderstand your objection to the reading that your\nfriend would have us adopt, but you have the same sort\nof problem. I mean, you've got a -- if it reads the way\nyou would have it, then the word \"that\" after \"an\noffense that\" doesn't quite work, and have you to add\n\"is\" before \"is committed,\" if you're going to keep the\n\"that.\" So it seems to me that this doesn't work\ngrammatically either way.\nMS. SAHARSKY: I don't think that that's\nright, with respect, Your Honor, because you have an\noffense that is of a certain character committed by a\ncertain person.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you've changed\nthe word. You read it as if it says \"an offense that\ncommitted.\" So either the \"that\" is out or you've got\nto add the word \"is.\"\nMS. SAHARSKY: I think that the word\n\"offense\" is twice modified. There is an offense that\nis of a certain character and there is an offense\ncommitted by a certain --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. You use the\nword \"that\" in the first example, but you skip the word\n\"that\" in the second. \"That\" appears in the line and\nthen comes (i) and (ii). In other words, that modifies\nboth of them, and you're reading it that it's an offense\ncommitted, and yet under the statute it has to be an\n\"offense that committed.\" So you've either got to leave\n\"that\" out the second time but not the first or you've\ngot to add the word \"is\" as it appears in (i).\nMS. SAHARSKY: What I'm suggesting, Your\nHonor, is that the \"that\" refers to everything that is\nin Romanette (i) and (ii) up to the break with\n\"committed by.\" So that it is an offense that is a\nmisdemeanor and has as an element \"committed by.\" You\nknow, these -- these two different clauses both modify\n\"offense,\" just as a grammatical matter, not looking at\nthis Romanette (i) and (ii), but just looking at that\nsentence.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Romanette?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Oh, little Roman numeral.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I've never heard\nthat before. That's -- Romanette.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. SAHARSKY: If you just look at this as a\nsentence, you have \"an offense that is a misdemeanor and\nhas as an element committed by.\" Now, that \"committed\nby\" clause, it could have come after \"offense\" or it\ncould be in the place where it is now. There are just\nthese two different ways that offenses qualify.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You can't. I mean, you\nhave the \"that,\" and the \"that\" applies to both (i) and\n(ii), and this is part of (ii). I think you've got to\neither say \"that committed\" or -- or put in an \"is\" --\n\"that is committed.\" It just doesn't parse, and that\nlack of parsing is much worse than the one that you --\nyou point to in the other side's reading. Yes, it's not\nusual to talk about committing a use of force, but it\nhappens sometimes. It's -- it's not the most elegant\nlanguage, but there are many examples of such usage that\nhave been brought forth by the other side and by some of\nthe amici. So they have something that -- it's not\nelegant, but people have spoken that way. Nobody speaks\nthe way you want us to speak: \"An offense that\ncommitted by a person or an offense that\" -- \"committed\nby a current or former...\" Nobody talks that way.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Two responses.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Nobody.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Two responses, Your Honor.\nFirst, the \"committed by\" language refers back to\n\"offense\" and the \"that\" is just part of this -- this\nfirst clause, but -- and we believe that the\nGovernment's reading is the most logical reading. And\nthink of it this way: You know, Respondent agrees that\nif there were a hard return before the \"committed by\"\nlanguage, that it's clear -- that it would be more clear\nthat the Government's reading is correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I wouldn't agree with that.\nYou'd still have the \"that\" up above. You would have to\nhave a hard return and take out the \"that\" or -- or that\n(A) is a misdemeanor, \"has as an element\" and then a\nhard return, and you have to add \"and is committed.\"\nYou still have to add language besides the hard return.\nMS. SAHARSKY: With respect, Your Honor, we\nthink this can be read as all one sentence. But just to\nmake my second point, which is: I think that it would\ndo much more violence, Respondent's reading of the\nstatute, than you suggest because you're talking about\ntreating the singular word \"element\" as plural. You're\ntalking about ignoring the comma that separates the \"has\nas an element\" section from the \"committed by\" section,\nand then you're talking about taking what even the\nlinguists who filed a brief in this case essentially in\nsupport of Respondents say is a very weird usage of\n\"committed.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do you -- I'm\nsorry. I'm not following why \"element\" is singular.\nThe argument on the other side, I understood, is that\nthe element is the use of physical force committed by a\ncurrent or former spouse. So \"element\" is still\nsingular. I -- maybe I'm missing something. What\nchange would you have to make to the word \"element\" to\nadopt their reading?\nMS. SAHARSKY: We think that you'd say --\nyou'd have to say \"has as its elements\" to suggest that\nyou would take two very diverse concepts and make them\nboth required elements of the underlying offense.\nThere are two concepts here: One is how\nviolent the offense has to be, and then there's the\nsecond concept, which is a class of defendants, and\nthat's a very different concept. But if you just see\nthe singular \"element,\" \"has as an element,\" and then\nyou see, oh, okay, it has to be violent.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but I thought\nthe whole point of this was to get at violence committed\nby a family member, and if that's the critical element,\nyou don't have to have two different elements,\n\"violence\" and then \"committed.\" It's violence\ncommitted by a family member.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, with respect, Your\nHonor, we think that because Congress broke these up\ninto these two different clauses -- one that relates to\nviolence and then a separate clause that's introduced by\n\"committed by\" where \"committed\" naturally modifies\n\"offense\" -- that it was treating -- that these were two\nseparate requirements. And you're right that Congress\nwas trying to get at the problem of violent domestic\noffense, and if it was doing that it would make no sense\nat all for Congress to -- to have enacted a statute that\nwould such extremely limited application. And, of\ncourse, Respondent's reading would make the \"is a\nmisdemeanor under Federal law\" superfluous.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If we think that\nthere are two awkward readings, yours and your friend's,\nand both of them require surgery, don't we resolve that\nunder the rule of lenity?\nMS. SAHARSKY: No. The rule of lenity says\nthat there needs to be a grievous ambiguity after this\nCourt seizes aid -- any aid which can be derived from\nthe tools of statutory interpretation. So even though\nwe think that the text here is most naturally read in\nthe Government's way, every other indicia of meaning\nhere points in favor of the Government's interpretation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what -- what's\nbeen the underlying rationale for the rule of lenity,\nwhich is a rule I think we should apply with great\ncaution? But if we think -- what's the reason for the\nrule of lenity?\nMS. SAHARSKY: I think one of the -- the\nmain concerns is providing fair notice of what's\nillegal.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Fair notice. It -- it --\nit seems to me that if I were counsel practicing\ncriminal law in the private sector, and I negotiated a\nplea for simple assault, but there was a spouse that was\ninvolved, and then I walked down the courthouse step\nwith my clients, said we got a good deal, and\nincidentally, all guns in your house must immediately be\nsurrendered to other people, you must take them all out,\nyou may never hunt, you may never possess a gun.\nAnd under your view, if I don't say that I'm\nguilty of, it seems to me, serious malpractice. I just\ndon't see that there is notice to the legal profession.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well certainly, Your Honor,\nwe think that the statutory text is clear, and that's\nbecause people are presumed to know the law. Certainly\na person who has beaten his wife knows that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but the rule --\nMS. SAHARSKY: -- the assault he was\nconvicted of is one against his wife.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No. Where the context is,\nwe are asking why the rule of lenity and the rule of\nlenity is to ensure notice. And it seems to me this is\na classic case where there has to be notice. You could\ncome back and say that even if the statute had been\nwritten as to apply specifically to domestic crimes, a\nlot of attorneys wouldn't have had notice on it when it\nwas an omnibus budget bill added at the last minute.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Your Honor, it was at the\ntime that this statute was enacted the case that very\nfew States had statutes with a domestic relationship\nrequirement, only 17. And to be clear, in those 17\nStates those all covered more domestic relationships\nthan the Federal statute. They covered things like\ndating relationships, violence involving grandparents,\netcetera. So that even from the face of your State\nconviction, you wouldn't be able to just match it right\nup with this Federal offense. And the fact that those\n17 States -- A, that there was such a small number; and\nB, that those States cover a different range of domestic\noffenses --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There was a small, a\nsmall number. Were they populous States?\nMS. SAHARSKY: I think it was a range of\nStates. I don't think I could say it was all the most\npopulous or all the least populous States.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: California, New\nYork?\nMS. SAHARSKY: You know, I'd have to look at\nthe list. I think that California came in later -- no,\nCalifornia did have one statute; New York did not.\nBut you know, one thing that's worth\nnoticing in this case is that you know, the Senator,\nSenator Lautenberg, who was the sponsor of this\nlegislation, was from New Jersey; and other Respondent's\nreading of this statute it wouldn't have even applied to\noffenses committed in New Jersey. And that seems like\nan odd thing to believe. And of course, it wouldn't\nhave applied to Federal offenses despite the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask -- may I ask, to\nmake sure I understand the alternate reading. Is it\nyour view that the statute does mean the same as if,\nafter the words \"deadly weapon,\" there had been inserted\na parenthetical (iii), closed paren, \"is committed by\"?\nIf -- now there is the element of \"attempted use of\nforce\" is one, is the second requirement; and the third\nrequirement is that it be committed by a current or\nformer spouse.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Yes. I think --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So your -- your reading --\nI'm just following up on the Chief Justice's question --\nrequires us to assume that Congress really intended\nthere to be a triple \"i\" as well as a double \"i\", and\nthe triple \"i\" would have begun with the verb \"is.\"\nMS. SAHARSKY: I think that that's one way\nof doing it, but I don't think that you have to do that,\nbecause if you look at the structure of this sentence --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it is true, is it not,\nthat if you did do it that way, it would have been a lot\nclearer than it is now?\nMS. SAHARSKY: There are ways that Congress\ncould have made its manifest intent even more clear. It\ncould have added that Romanette (iii); it could put a\nhard return before \"committed by.\" But if you look at\nthe effect that the statute would have, if you read it\nRespondent's way, I don't think that we can reasonably\nexpect that Congress -- a Congress that wanted to get at\nthe serious nationwide problem of domestic violence\nusing firearms, would have wanted to enact a statute\nthat would have such limited effect.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I want to follow up on\nJustice Kennedy's inquiry about the rule of lenity.\nDon't you think the rule of lenity is particularly\nimportant when you're dealing with conduct that is not\nmalum in se? I mean, to say that, well, we are not\ngoing to apply the rule of lenity to a statute that\nposits an increased sentence for kneecapping or for some\nviolent conduct, the person knows he shouldn't be doing\nthat stuff anyway. But this imposes a -- a -- a penalty\nfor conduct that no one would think is unlawful.\nThis fellow is -- wasn't it his father's gun\nhe was taking to sell at a gun show or something?\nMS. SAHARSKY: There were five firearms.\nThere was one found in his home, three that he\ntransferred and one that he sold.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, he could have ten,\ncouldn't he?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, we would hope that he\nwouldn't in this situation. But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Because he has been convicted\nof a serious violent offense, and I think that's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but for this\nlanguage that you say makes his owning of a firearm\nunlawful, it wouldn't be unlawful at all, would it? He\nwould have no reason to think he couldn't have a\nfirearm.\nMS. SAHARSKY: I think that a person who has\nbeen committed of a violent offense should be on notice\nthat their procession of firearms --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Should be. Is that right?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A misdemeanor -- a\nmisdemeanor offense. And -- and -- and he should\nsuspect that because he committed a misdemeanor, he\ncannot have a firearm?\nMS. SAHARSKY: When --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think anybody would\nassume that. Indeed, there are some who assume that\nyou -- you cannot prevent the owning of a firearm for a\nmere misdemeanor, as opposed to a felony.\nMS. SAHARSKY: I understand that concern.\nWe are not talking about mere misdemeanors here. We are\ntalking about a specific category of violent\nmisdemeanors, Section 929(g)(9); specifically --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Make it clear.\nMake it clear, so that when -- when his\nlawyer pleads to the offense, he doesn't have to read in\na little (iii) where there is not a little (iii). And\nhe -- well, you did not plead guilty or you are not\naccused of the offense of using violence against a\nfamily member. You're just -- just accused of -- of\nusing violence, a misdemeanor.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Two thoughts on that, Your\nHonor. The first is, you know, at the time that this\nstatute was enacted almost all of the States except for\nthis small number prosecuted offenses that were domestic\ndisturbance offenses like the one in this case under\ngeneral assault and battery statutes, and even the 17\nStates that have those with the domestic relations,\noffenses with the domestic relationship requirement,\nstill prosecute them routinely as assault and battery\nunder those general statutes.\nSo I think a person -- A, an attorney who\nhandles those kind of cases would have knowledge of that\nlaw; and B, a person who has committed a serious violent\noffense like Respondent's previous offense in this case\nshould be on notice that his possession of firearms\nmight be regulated.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- a serious violent\noffense. Are there -- is there felony assault and\nbattery?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And this was misdemeanor\nassault and battery, wasn't it?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Yes, that's right. I mean, I\nreally --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So it's not that serious an\noffense. That's why we call it a misdemeanor.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, I mean, certainly the\noffense is this particular case was serious. The\ncharging document reflects that Respondent hit his wife\nall around the face until it swelled out, kicked her all\naround her body, kicked here in the ribs --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Then he should have been\ncharged with a felony, but he wasn't. He was charged\nwith a misdemeanor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Wasn't the -- wasn't the\nstatute responding to just that problem, that domestic\nabuse tended to be charged as misdemeanors rather than\nfelonies? And it was that fact that the Senator was\nresponding to when he included misdemeanor. The whole\npurpose of this was to make a misdemeanor battery count\nfor the statute's purpose.\nMS. SAHARSKY: That's exactly right, Justice\nGinsburg. All of the discussion of this in Congress\nsaid we need to have a zero tolerance towards people --\nzero tolerance policy towards people who are -- have\nproven that they are willing to commit violent acts\nagainst family members; and we already have a statute\nthat prohibits felons from possessing firearms, but we\nknow that sometimes these domestic offenses get charged\nas misdemeanors. And Senator Lautenberg specifically\nsaid in the legislative record they are often charged as\noffenses like assault and battery, and we need to get at\nthese offenses because these people should not have\nfirearms. They should not put their families in that\ntype of powder keg situation, and they -- we should not\nbe putting police in that type of situation, where\npolice who respond to a domestic disturbance call like\nthe 911 call in this case are put in a dangerous\nsituation with a person -- an emotionally charged\nsituation -- who would have a firearm.\nOne other point that I wanted to make with\nrespect to your question, Justice Scalia -- and this is\nnot with respect to how this case should be resolved,\nbut just as a practical matter -- that the VAWA 2005\namendments do require States, for a condition of their\ngrant funding, to have a judicial policy that gives\nnotice for offenses like assault and battery that a\nperson would not be able to possess a firearm.\nAnd the reason that they are doing that is\nnot because, you know, as a constitutional matter we\nthink that they need to, but because they really --\nCongress just really wants to keep firearms away from\npeople who have shown that they are willing to hurt\nfamily members in this way.\nNow, I talked a little bit in the beginning\nof argument about how really every -- every indicia of\nmeaning in this case -- and we do look to -- to each of\nthose different interpretive tools before we would\ninvoke the rule of lenity -- points in favor of the\nGovernment's construction. First of all, you've got the\ntext, and I think we've -- we've covered those\narguments. But just as a practical matter, this statute\nwould have an extremely limited effect if it didn't --\nif it were interpreted as Respondent suggests.\nThe language with respect to Federal\nmisdemeanors would be superfluous because the way that\nFederal offenses like domestic assaults on Army bases\nare charged is under a general Federal assault statute.\nThere isn't one that's specific to domestic violence.\nSo Congress would have put this \"misdemeanor under\nFederal law\" language in there, and it -- it would have\nimmediately had no effect either. You know, the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it seems there\nis no Federal misdemeanor that covers this particular\ntype of assault, in other words?\nMS. SAHARSKY: There is -- there is a\ngeneral Federal assault statute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMS. SAHARSKY: But it doesn't have a\ndomestic relationship requirement, and that's the\nproblem. You know, we also look to the drafting history\njust a bit, and I -- I think that, you know, every\nindicia -- every indication in the drafting history,\nboth if you compare the first version of the bill with\nthe statute that was enacted and the discussion relating\nto it, shows that this language \"has as an element,\"\nwhich really only intended to get at how violent an\noffense had to be, it -- it was never intended to get at\nany kind of domestic relationship requirement. And, of\ncourse, the -- the sponsor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think -- I think that\npeople are governed by the law that is passed, not by\nthe law that Congress intended to pass.\nMS. SAHARSKY: That's exactly right, Justice\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, really, if a lawyer\nreading this would not think that it applied, I don't\ncare what Congress intended. If -- if the law doesn't\nsay that, the person is not governed by it. You think a\nperson could be governed by it despite the fact that it\ndoesn't say that because Congress intended it?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Of course not, Justice\nScalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course.\nMS. SAHARSKY: We look to the text first,\nbut we also look to other indicia -- many of us also\nlook to other indicia of Congress's intent. And some of\nthose indicia include things like a comparison of the\ndrafting history and Senator Lautenberg's statement,\nwhich is directly on point here, which says that\noffenses like assault and battery would be covered.\nThis is a -- a powerful tool.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how does that\nrelate to the rule of lenity? I suppose, to get back to\nJustice Kennedy's point, you're saying that the lawyer\nwould not only be obligated to read this, but in\nadvising his client would be obligated to go back and\nread the drafting history and the legislative history.\nDo we really use those types of materials to trump the\n-- the rule of lenity?\nMS. SAHARSKY: This Court has in -- in\nmultiple cases looked to the fact that the statute, for\nexample, would have such a narrow, limited purpose, in\naddition to the statute's text, to say, you know, we\ncan't believe Congress would expect that purpose --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the lawyer\nadvising his client in the typical assault case is\nsupposed to know at the time that only 17 States had\nthis type of provision?\nMS. SAHARSKY: I think it was well known at\nthe time that these offenses, even in the 17 States that\nhad the domestic relationship element, were commonly\nprosecuted as assault and battery offenses. And this\nCourt has -- for example, let's consider the Taylor\ncase, where this Court was considering the example of\nburglary and trying to define: Should we pick this\nnarrow, common-law definition of \"burglary,\" or a more\nexpansive definition of \"burglary\"?\nAnd, aside from looking at the legislative\nhistory, there is a separate section of the Court's\nopinion where you said: Look, if we took this narrow,\ncommon law definition of \"burglary,\" it would apply\nbasically nowhere and we just can't think that Congress\nintended that.\nAnd you didn't go right to the rule of\nlenity there. You looked at, for example, how that\nfrustration of congressional purpose would occur and the\nproblem that that would cause.\nIf there are no further questions, I'd like\nto reserve the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Giatras.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF TROY N. GIATRAS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. GIATRAS: Mr. Chief Justice, may it\nplease the Court:\nThe fundamental flaw in the Government's\nargument is that it describes a statute that Congress\nconsidered but did not pass. In the statute's final\nversion Congress defined the \"misdemeanor crime of\ndomestic violence\" to require that the predicate offense\nhave as an element a domestic relationship between the\noffender and the victim.\nAnd the Government's reading ignores the\nlegislative compromise that led to the contested\nlanguage; and, if adopted by this Court, would rewrite\nthe statute and hand one side the legislative victory\nthat they were unable to achieve in Congress.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait. You say that\nthat was the compromise. I don't know that you have any\nevidence to -- to show that that was an intentional --\nan intentional alteration made in the House of\nRepresentatives. Do you? I mean --\nMR. GIATRAS: There is nothing that speaks\nto the words in the House of Representatives in the\nCongressional Record, Your Honor, but their inaction and\nthe lack of words speak very loudly. And it was -- from\nMarch of 1996, when the legislation was introduced, and\nthen it went over to the House after passing\nsignificantly in the Senate, it was stalled, and it was\nstymied, and it did not move.\nAs a matter of fact, it had to at one time\nbe taken from a -- and put into the stalking bill and\nthen removed from the stalking bill and replaced back in\nthen to a postal bill, which was then modified into the\nappropriations bill.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the other side says\nthat the reason that was the case was that they objected\nto the fact that -- what was its language -- the -- the\nold version did not say a \"misdemeanor crime of domestic\nviolence.\" It was -- it was broader.\nMR. GIATRAS: It certainly was broader, but\nthere was nothing -- and there was no one that spoke in\nthe House of Representatives on that matter. And there\nwas only one -- the principal author of the legislation,\nthe sponsor, spoke in the Senate. And it was not until\nthe eleventh hour on September 28th of 1996 that this\nentire change was made.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought it was that the\nuse of force -- to make it clear is a misdemeanor -- had\nto involve a use of force, and that wasn't clear before,\nright?\nMR. GIATRAS: The --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where is the\nearlier version? Do we have the earlier version\nanywhere --\nMR. GIATRAS: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- in the materials in\nfront of us?\nMR. GIATRAS: Appendix B, page 5a of the red\nbrief -- I'm sorry. It's page 4a of the red brief.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Thank you.\nMR. GIATRAS: I apologize.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: While we pause, can I just\nask you one question to make sure I understand the two\n-- two different positions? Your view of the subsection\nii is that the meaning you attributed to it is -- would\nbe exactly the same if you left out the word\n\"committed\"? In other words, it seems to me under your\nview the word -- either the word \"committed\" or the\nwords \"committed by\" is superfluous?\nMR. GIATRAS: No. That is part of the\nelement -- the one element that is required.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why would you need that in\nthere if the statute means -- if the element is the use\nof force by a family member? Why do you have to put in\nanother verb, \"committed\"?\nMR. GIATRAS: Well, because that's who --\nthat's who it would -- that's who it would address to.\nAnd that would be with respect to -- when you look at\nthe definition that's set forth, it was to change from\nthe original -- original --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I'm not interested\nin changes. I'm just interested in the text before us.\nAnd it seems to me that your reading of the statute is\nexactly what the statute would say if it did not include\nthe word \"committed.\"\nMR. GIATRAS: I -- I don't know, Justice. I\ndon't believe so, though.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I agree with\nJustice Stevens. Read it without the word \"committed.\"\nIt not only has the same effect, but it's more natural,\nbecause it's \"use of force by a current or former\nspouse,\" as opposed to \"use of force committed by.\"\nMR. GIATRAS: It would still include -- it\nwould still include both attributes into the one element\neven if the word \"committed\" were removed from double\nii, yes. I'm -- I'm sorry about that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: As I read this old one --\nas I read the first one, Senator Lautenberg put in the\nlanguage, and his language in the first one was to say\nI'll tell you a group of people who shouldn't have guns.\nThe people who commit a crime of domestic violence.\nNow what's that? In the statute he says it\nis a misdemeanor crime of violence committed by a person\nin a family relation with the victim.\nThen he says after, I changed that language\na little. I'll tell you why. Because somebody told me\nmisdemeanor crime of violence is too broad. It could\ninclude cutting up a credit card. So I'll define it\nmore specifically.\nAnd he defines if more specifically to say\nthat it is a crime that has as an element the use or\nattempted use of physical force or threatening people\nwith a weapon. End of the matter.\nThey substitute those words and they did\nanother thing the drafter as he breaks out the thing it\nsays: It is a crime that is a misdemeanor and, you see,\nand that's where the problem is, because if you put in a\n\"that,\" then you have to have an \"is.\" So he left out\nthe \"is.\" Okay.\nSo I say what did Senator Lautenberg want\nwith these words? I see. How did he change it? I see.\nI can't find a word that supports the reason\nthat you have. Now, maybe they are there. That's what\nyou'll tell me.\nAnd then I say it's the fine language\nconsistent with what he wanted. It requires putting in\nan \"is.\" I don't find that too awful. Okay. That's\nyour argument against you. What is it? Your argument\nto rebut that.\nMR. GIATRAS: The legislation that the\nSenator introduced was not the legislation that was\npassed by Congress. And, Justice Breyer, it is very\nclear from the statutory and legislative history in this\ncase from -- you just take up through September 28th of\n1996, that the sponsor of the legislation decries with\nrespect to the staunch opposition that was in the House,\nand the fact that his bill was going nowhere. This may\nhave been his intended purpose with respect to what was\nintroduced, but it was then the will of Congress with\nchanging --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's the conclusion.\nYou're reaching that conclusion. What I need from you\nis something that would tell me, no, Congress didn't\njust want to clarify in the way Lautenberg said. What\nthey wanted to do was, in fact, restrict the scope of\nthis so it only applied in 17 states. Okay. I'm open\nto that argument. It could be a good argument. Just\npoint me to the things that suggest that that is what\nCongress wanted to do, rather than by what Senator\nLautenberg said.\nMR. GIATRAS: By take -- by taking a look at\nthe final passed legislation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I've got the words. If\nthe best you can do is point me to the words of the\nstatute, I'll take that into account. I'm asking the\nquestion to see if there is anything at all more?\nMR. GIATRAS: Other than the fact that the\nstructure of the statute also changed, and the structure\nof the statute changed --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't want the text. I\nwant something for my purposes.\nMR. GIATRAS: What we have --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMR. GIATRAS: And what is problematic here,\nJustice, is that the legislative history does not speak\non this particular matter. It is silent on this.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did this structure come\nfrom Senator Lautenberg?\nMR. GIATRAS: No, it did not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where did it come from?\nMR. GIATRAS: It is -- it has to be presumed\nthat it came from -- we don't know exactly where, but it\ncame out of the House, and the House of Representatives\non September 28th --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It came out of the House\nversion. The House version had this which was different\nfrom the Senate version that Lautenberg was responsible\nfor?\nMR. GIATRAS: No. This was a version that\nwas passed in the Senate as the \"as introduced\"\nlanguage. It then went and it was sat -- it sat in the\nHouse of Representatives for a long period of time.\nIt was not until September 28th, prior --\nright prior to the time that the budget bill had to have\nbeen sent back to -- to the Senate to be voted on and\nthen proved by the President to continue the government\nto run. And this bill was changed then in the House of\nRepresentatives on -- at the 11th hour --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So this language came from\nthe House?\nMR. GIATRAS: Yes, it did.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me, Senator\nLautenberg would not have been the drafter of this\nlanguage.\nMR. GIATRAS: The -- Senator Lautenberg does\nnot disagree that he came to an agreement on this\nlanguage.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm sorry. Are you saying\nthat Senator Lautenberg did not change the words\n\"misdemeanor crime of violence\" to the words \"use of\nphysical force\" or \"threatened use of deadly weapon\"?\nThat's what he got up on the floor of the Senate and\nsaid that he wanted to change.\nMR. GIATRAS: Justice, as this Court has\narticulated in Allapattah, that sometimes there can be a\nstrategic manipulation to secure results.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not -- we're in -- the\nquestion specifically is where did the words come from?\nI thought that the words came from Senator Lautenberg.\nThe reason I thought that is because he got up on the\nfloor of the Senate and said that's what he did.\nNow, if you're telling me they came from a\ndifferent place, what is there in anywhere? I'm open to\nhearing it, but I couldn't find anything that said they\nhad come from a different place.\nMR. GIATRAS: They would have come from the\nHouse of Representatives.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What do you mean would\nhave? Did it language come over to the Senate from the\nHouse or not?\nMR. GIATRAS: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So the -- the -- the\nlanguage on physical force came from the House? That's\nwhat you're saying? I'm just trying to be clear.\nMR. GIATRAS: Threatened use of --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It might have. I'm not\ncriticizing. I want to know.\nMR. GIATRAS: The use or attempted use of\nphysical force or the threatened use of a deadly weapon\nlanguage, including the words \"misdemeanor crime of\ndomestic violence\" came over from the House.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This very form that was\nultimately enacted was the form that came over from the\nHouse to the Senate?\nMR. GIATRAS: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Making progress. And\nyou're saying that in the House there were some people\nwho didn't want it to extend to beyond 17 States?\nMR. GIATRAS: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And how do we know that?\nMR. GIATRAS: Well, by the mere fact that\nthey -- we don't have them speaking to it, because there\nwas no actual congressional record of them speaking to\nit or someone taking to the floor in the House of\nRepresentatives. It's absolutely silent.\nWe have to, instead, go back to what Senator\nLautenberg was saying on the floor of the Senate during\nthis period of time, where he made very clear that what\nwas occurring to his bill that it was dying, that it was\nbeing killed and it was being gutted in September of --\nearly to late September of 1996, the author says that\nhis bill is being gutted and it's dying, and that there\nare significant staunch opposition from certain forces\nin order to limit the bill.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Other than a desire to\nweaken this bill as much as possible, can you think of\nany reason why Congress would have drawn the distinction\nthat you're drawing between States that have specific\nstatutes relating to domestic violence misdemeanor\nstatutes and those that don't?\nMR. GIATRAS: I don't think we can speak why\ncertain States did or did not or why Congress would only\nwant there to be 17. But, certainly, there is\nnothing -- and there is nothing in the legislative\nhistory to express other than the fact that it was the\neffect of a judicial -- of a legislative compromise.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What sense would it make\nfor Congress to say take two abusers? The conduct is\nidentical. And in state A there is one consequence to\nbar on the possession of guns, and state B there isn't\nfor the identical conduct, why would Congress want these\ntwo different results?\nMR. GIATRAS: It was -- the language that\nwas ultimately agreed upon by the entire Congress, Your\nHonor, was as a result of a compromise. And -- that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose it gives greater\nassurance of what exactly the prior conviction was. If\nthere is just a prior conviction of misdemeanor\nviolence, you have to go back, I suppose, and look at\nthe conviction, look at the testimony to find out\nwhether indeed it was domestic violence. It was just a\ngeneral -- general assault statute. You don't know it\nwas committed in the home or not.\nWhereas if you're -- if you're convicted of\nthe crime, the misdemeanor of violence against a spouse\nor a relative like this, you know exactly what the --\nwhat the crime is?\nMR. GIATRAS: You will know that.\nCertainly. And by even the -- the text of the statute,\nit changes from a crime of violence to the definition of\nmisdemeanor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that -- that\nwhen someone purchases a firearm, they have to affirm,\ncheck a box, I have been convicted of a crime of\ndomestic violence. Is that how it reads? And that goes\nto, you know, to the Federal Government and they check\nthe records of convictions.\nHow -- how would your client check that? I\nhave been -- I have been convicted of a crime of\ndomestic violence, if he had been convicted of assault\nand the assault happened to be domestic assault would --\nwould he be perjuring himself if he said no?\nMR. GIATRAS: There are -- there are cases\nthat are prosecuted in that manner where also lying on\nthe form gives charge -- gives rise to a Federal\noffense. And the ATF regulation is -- reads the statute\nslightly -- reads the statute -- it reads the statute\nsignificantly different and puts in parentheticals such\nas assault and/or battery and also puts in\nparentheticals how -- they use the word \"was committed\"\nin a -- in a third subparagraph.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does -- does it make clear\nwhether the offense has to be domestic -- a domestic\nviolence offense or whether an ordinary assault offense\nwill qualify if as a matter of fact it was domestic?\nMR. GIATRAS: Well, it -- it -- the ATF\nregulation denotes that you should even put it down if\nit's going to be an assault and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand what\nyou've said.\nMR. GIATRAS: The ATF regulation is in\nappendix F to your red brief, page 12 A.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, and it's drafted the\nway the statute should have been drafted. Isn't that\ninteresting.\nIn other words, it breaks out the \"was\ncommitted by a current or former spouse\" and makes that\na separate provision, rather than a part of the element\n\"use of attempted force against a family member.\"\nMR. GIATRAS: That is correct, Your Honor,\nbut that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's drafted the way\nit should have been if your friends are correct.\nMR. GIATRAS: That -- it's drafted the\nway -- it's drafted the way the original sponsor of the\nlegislation would have wanted it to pass Congress, Your\nHonor -- or Chief Justice.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The -- the -- the statute\nuses the word element in the term singular. It seems to\nme that although this statute is a mess anyway --\n(Laughter).\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that that -- that that\ndoesn't particularly help you. Elements usually refer\nto each component of the actus reus -- you entered a\ndwelling with a weapon. You would say \"elements\" for\nthat, wouldn't you?\nAnd it seems to me under your interpretation\nthe statute should say \"elements.\"\nMR. GIATRAS: Well, I think that the -- the\nbest advice is to take that of judge Sentelle's\ndissenting opinion in Barnes where element or elements\nis insignificant, the plural of it. Instead it's what\nis the element as opposed to how many elements there\nare.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I mean when we are\ngasping for straws I'm not sure anything is\ninsignificant.\nMR. GIATRAS: Well -- and in this particular\nmatter, when in seeking -- if after seizing everything\nfrom which the aid can or may be derived, I think we can\nonly guess as to Congress's intent.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But suppose this statute,\nthe one that was enacted, had the word \"if\" before\n\"committed.\" Would that then convey the meaning that\nthe Government is urging? Has as an element use of\nforce, comma, \"if\" committed.\nMR. GIATRAS: Well, that may make it\nslightly even more vague, Justice, because then it's\nwhether or not it's even part or parcel or whether it is\nor isn't part of it. Here at least what they --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: \"If committed\" would\nbreak from \"use of force.\" The element is the use of\nforce, but then the crime would have to have been\ncommitted by a current or former spouse; so wouldn't an\n\"if\" separate what is the element, that is, use of\nforce?\nMR. GIATRAS: I don't believe that to\nuse the word \"if\" changes our position, Justice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, sure it would. Just\nas an \"is\" --\nMR. GIATRAS: Well, \"was,\" if --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, if you want to add\nwords you can add \"if,\" you can add \"as is,\" you could\nrewrite the statute a lot of ways.\nMR. GIATRAS: Well -- and one way is that\nthis statute denotes that there is a part (c), of which\nthere is no part (c). This statute also lacks -- even\nthough it's very insignificant in and of itself, by\nitself -- it lacks a period at the very end of double i.\nAgain, no one particular point can be --\nwould say that we would allow that punctuation to\novercome the purpose, or overcome the text, but when\ntaken as a whole, when you have the text and an\ninartfully drafted statute that references sections that\ndon't exist, that has grammatical errors in it and that\nleaves things up to the reader to have to decide whether\nsomething is involved or not involved; and you also then\nhave a lack of sufficient congressional record, then I\nbelieve that it certainly is favored to look at the rule\nof lenity in this case. I do want to also --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you really think there is\na notice problem here? If you had been advising\nMr. Hayes after he was convicted of this misdemeanor,\nand you read this, would you say well, you know, you're\n-- it's a good thing that you were convicted of this in\nWest Virginia, where there isn't a specific statute\ntargeting domestic violence, because it doesn't cover\nyou. If you had been convicted in another State under a\nspecific domestic violence statute then you wouldn't be\nable to possess firearms but you're home free because of\nthe nature of the statute in your State?\nMR. GIATRAS: I believe it would have\nbeen -- in 1993, '94 time period, it would have been\nvery difficult -- it would have been, it should have\nbeen very easy to -- to advise Mr. Hayes with respect to\nthat issue. Certainly. That he would not have lost his\nrights at that point.\nThereafter when Congress passed this\nstatute, then I believe that -- does it become a little\nmurky? It probably does become a little murky. After\nyou have the hindsight of being able to one, take a look\nat the legislative record if that's the necessary,\nand/or consider that, and/or if you take a look at the\nATF regulation, the only problem is the ATF regulation\ntakes it -- takes us back in time to what they would\nhave -- what would have been or what they would have\nliked it to have been as opposed to what was actually\nlegislated.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if -- counsel\nadvising Mr. Hayes surely would have looked at what was\nthe uniform position in all the circuits. All the\ncircuits that had this question before the floor read it\nthe way the Government is urging. So counsel I think\nwould have been highly irresponsible to advise Mr. Hayes\nthat he would be home free, simply because his own State\ndidn't have a separate domestic violence statute.\nMR. GIATRAS: And Justice Ginsburg, the only\nreason I say that in this particular case, is because\nMr. Hayes was in 1993 -- and was pled in 1994, which was\nprior to enactment of this statute and/or any of the\ncircuit court opinions. So that was my -- that was the\nreason for my answer that in Mr. Hayes' case it would\nhave been very simple and no one would have looked to\nthose issues because those didn't exist.\nTo bring to the -- to answer one of the\nquestions from the Chief Justice with respect to what\nStates may have had these laws in 1996, on page 24 of\nthe Government's merits brief, the footnote number 9\ndenotes -- footnote number 9 denotes the States, which\ninclude Alabama, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Maine,\nNorth Carolina and the like. Kansas, and Mississippi.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Is that\nthe right list? That's -- that's statutes passed after\n1996.\nMR. GIATRAS: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I looked at the\namicus brief filed by the National Network, page 18\nfootnote 53, and I see California, Illinois, Michigan,\nOhio. Which is the right list?\nMR. GIATRAS: And that is the right list,\nChief Justice, and that includes West Virginia in the\n1996, that was passed. And that is there on footnote\nnumber 53, just so it's correct.\nOur reading of the statute is more\nreasonable than the Government's. Certainly with\nrespect to the variances of the grammatical errors and\nthe grammatical leaps that the Government must take in\norder to substantiate its reading of the statute, we\nbelieve that ours is more reasonable.\nLikewise, the legislative history in this\nparticular case is very weak, and if this Court even\nconsiders it, then I think you can take a look with\nrespect to the text, the structure, the purpose and the\nhistory and determine --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me be sure I\nunderstand the legislative history correctly in a broad\nsense. The text of the bill as originally introduced in\nthe Senate favors the Government. Is that correct?\nMR. GIATRAS: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And there was a change\nmade in the House in the form of an amendment to that\nbill? Or was it a separate bill introduced in the\nHouse?\nMR. GIATRAS: It was not a separate bill.\nThere was -- there no committee -- there was no\ncommittee substitute, there was no committee hearings.\nIt just --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They enacted a different\ntext.\nMR. GIATRAS: Yes, they did.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And then -- without\nexplanation. And then the bill went back to the Senate.\nAs I understand it, it was approved in the form enacted\nby the House without -- with only that one comment.\nMR. GIATRAS: That is with only -- yes. And\nthat -- and that comment did not speak -- the comment of\nthe sponsor did not speak with respect to the domestic\nviolence, the domestic relationships element.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But he did say that he\nagreed to the change.\nMR. GIATRAS: He did say that he agreed with\nthe change, and that he also said, though, that the he\n-- that the bill, the new bill made it more precise and\nbroader. Which was a -- which was a quote from the\nsponsor.\nIf there are no further questions --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me be sure. But under\nyour view, it actually made it narrower?\nMR. GIATRAS: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. GIATRAS: If there are no further\nquestions, Respondent asks that the Court affirm the\njudgment of the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Under anybody's\nview, it made it narrow. Under Lautenberg's view, it\nmade it narrow.\nMR. GIATRAS: Other than he said the words\nthat it made it more precise and broader.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How did it make it broader?\nI mean, it used to cover cutting -- cutting a credit\ncard. Now, it no longer does.\nMR. GIATRAS: The text of the statute as\nenacted makes it more narrow.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course it does.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. GIATRAS: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Saharsky, six\nminutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. SAHARSKY: Thank you. In this case, the\nCourt has a choice between either reading the statute in\na way that uses the words very unnaturally and unusually\n-- \"committed by\" to modify \"use\" and \"element\" --\ntreating a singular as plural, and the word \"committed\"\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if I could\nstop you there. The very first sentence in the United\nStates Code, 1 U.S.C. section 1, says the singular\nincludes the plural.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Right, and this Court has\nsaid that you do that only when two things are true:\nWhen it makes sense in context, and we think it doesn't\nbecause of the word \"committed,\" which Respondent wants\nto read right out of the statute, and also because you\ndo it when it's necessary to fulfill the evident\npurposes of the statute. And here, for the reasons we\nexplained, treating the singular as plural would be\ncontrary to the purposes of the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know, but\nbasically what you're saying is we don't follow 1 U.S.C.\nsection 1 because our reading is correct. If they said,\nwell, it doesn't -- you know, in context it doesn't\nfulfill the purposes and therefore we read \"element\" as\nsingular only rather than according to section 1 of the\nUnited States Code.\nMS. SAHARSKY: It's because the element --\nthe singular \"element\" has other indicia meaning it\ninvolves the word \"committed\" and then also this -- the\nfact that Congress's objective would be stymied if you\ntook Respondent's reading.\nSo you've got a choice between just using\nthe words unnaturally -- \"committed by,\" taking\n\"committed\" and just making it superfluous, as in\nRespondent's view, or treating the singular \"element\" as\nplural, or you can give, as the Government is\nsuggesting, a natural and logical reading that you're\ntalking about an offense of this certain violent\ncharacter committed by these certain people. And, yes,\nthat involves looking slightly past Romanette (i) and\n(ii) structure to look at this being two clauses that\nboth modify the word \"offense.\" You --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You have to add words. It\nis unavoidable. To come to your reading, you must add\nwords to the statute. To adopt the reading of the other\nside on the other hand, you need not add a single word.\nYou just have to resign yourself to the -- to the usage\nthat is unusual but not unheard of, that a particular\nuse was committed. And the other side gives a number of\nexamples, as does the brief by -- by linguists, a number\nof examples where that appears.\nSo it's an unusual usage but not an unheard\nof usage. They don't have to add a single word or a\nsingle hard break in the text. You have to, to get to\nyour construction.\nMS. SAHARSKY: With respect, Justice Scalia,\nwe don't agree with that, and I'll give you two\nillustrations that hopefully would help establish that\npoint: One, if you just read this all as a sentence\nwithout respect to the Romanettes (i) and (ii), you have\nan offense that is as a misdemeanor and has, as an\nelement, committed by a certain group of persons. That\nreads as a sentence. There is an offense of a certain\ntype committed by a certain group of persons.\nJUSTICE BREYER: For that, you'd have to\nassume that the GS-12 who drafted this, or whoever the\nequivalent was in the Senate, put the \"that\" in the\nwrong place. If he had put the \"that\" after the (i)\nwhen he broke it down, it would all read as a sentence.\nThe \"that\" would be for the first part, and you'd say\n\"felony committed\" for the part that interests us. Does\nthat work?\nMS. SAHARSKY: I think it would read better\nthat way. I think that it would --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You'd would have to put a\n\"that\" --\nMS. SAHARSKY: It would read --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You'd have to put a \"that\"\nat the beginning of (ii) as well, wouldn't you?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Again, I think if you just --\nI don't think you need to. I think you can just read\nthrough this all as one sentence. And we looked at that\nprevious -- while were you talking with Respondent's\ncounsel, you looked at that previous version of the bill\nCongress considered, and it just had it all as one\nsentence. It said \"an offense of this certain character\ncommitted by this certain group of persons.\" And that\nsame structure is in the statute as enacted, and that\nshows that the \"committed by\" refers back to \"offense.\"\nAnd to get back to the point I opened with,\nthe way that you choose between the two constructions in\nthis case is to look at what Congress would achieve\nunder Respondent's construction of the statute, which is\na statute that applies only in 17 States, not --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And, again, not to\nbeat a dead horse, but it's footnote 8 of your brief on\npage 23 that lists the 17 States. They include\nCalifornia, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Virginia. That\nwouldn't be a useless act by Congress to cover everybody\nin those States.\nMS. SAHARSKY: No, but it wouldn't be\nconsistent with what Congress was intending, which is to\nsolve the nationwide problem that every person who\nproved that they were willing to hurt their family\nmembers should not be able to possess a firearm, whether\nthey're a felon or whether they were convicted of a\nmisdemeanor. And that was the problem that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know, but you\npoint was this doesn't do any good because it's only 17\nStates. Those are -- there are a lot of people in those\nStates.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Right, but some persons in\nthose States who commit the same types of offenses, as\nJustice Ginsburg pointed out -- you know, they commit\nthe same violent acts against family members. Some of\nthem would be prosecuted under the regular -- under a\nspecific domestic violence statute, but some would be\nprosecuted under regular assault and battery statutes.\nAnd it doesn't make any sense, in those same States, to\ntreat some people as being subject to the possession ban\nand some people as not being subject to that possession\nban.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It makes it easier to\nidentify it. You don't have to go back and look to see\nwhether this particular assault conviction was an\nassault on a family member or not. It's there on the\nface of the indictment. Pretty important, it seems to\nme.\nMS. SAHARSKY: With respect, Justice Scalia,\nyou can't just tell from the face of the State\nindictment whether you would not be able to possess a\nfirearm under Federal law, because the domestic\nrelationship covered by the State offenses, it is a\nbroader universe in each of those 17 States. More\ndomestic relationships are covered than are covered by\nthe Federal statute. So you could have been convicted\nin one of those 17 States of a specific domestic\nviolence offense, and still that would not necessarily\nbe the case that you couldn't possess a firearm under\nFederal law, because they cover, for example, dating\nrelationships.\nI understand that the notice concerns you've\nraised but just to get back to one other point that came\nup with Respondent's counsel, when a person wants to buy\na firearm, he fills out this particular form, Form 4473,\nand that form specifically says on that offenses like\nassault and battery are covered. The ATF regulation\nthat has been in place since this statute was enacted\nsays that those -- that offenses such as assault and\nbattery are covered. In fact, all the courts of appeals\nup until recently, nine of them had this settled\nunderstanding. Aside from the ATF having it, Congress\nrelied upon it. And we think that it makes sense.\nYou should reverse the judgment below.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
