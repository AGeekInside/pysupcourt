        "content": "(10:09 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in No. 01-631, the United States v. Christopher\nDrayton and Clifton Brown.\nMr. Thompson.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LARRY D. THOMPSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. THOMPSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis Court has held in several decisions that\nthe police questioning of individuals is a legitimate and,\nindeed, vital law enforcement technique. The decision\nbelow ignores this Court's teachings as to when a police-\ncitizen encounter on a bus may violate the Fourth\nAmendment and may constitute the seizure of the passenger.\nPolice-citizen encounters have proven to be\neffective law enforcement techniques in the area of drug\nand weapon interdiction. These encounters are also\nimportant in today's environment with respect to the\nprotection of passengers in the Nation's public\ntransportation system.\nThis case is controlled by this Court's decision\nin Bostick and the court below incorrectly applied the\nBostick test to these facts.\nQUESTION: Mr. Thompson, isn't it so that in\nBostick the police did inform the passengers that they had\na right to refuse consent?\nMR. THOMPSON: That is correct, Your Honor, but\nalso in Bostick this Court clearly pointed out, on remand\nto the Florida Supreme Court, the factors that the Court\nshould evaluate in terms of determining whether or not the\nencounter was coercive or otherwise inappropriate. And\ntwo of those factors are important here that would put\ninto context what the court below considered.\nFor example, this Court pointed out to the\nFlorida Supreme Court whether or not there were guns\npointed and noted that there were no guns pointed in a --\nin the Bostick case. This Court also pointed out to the\nFlorida Supreme Court that -- whether or not there was the\nexistence of threatening language, and none of that\nexisted in the case below.\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I suppose that the advice\nthat you have a right to decline the request applies --\nand I -- I take it you could read Bostick this way;\nperhaps you disagree -- to whether or not the -- the\nconsent was actually given as opposed to whether there was\na coercive environment.\nMR. THOMPSON: That's correct, Your Honor, and\nas the Bostick Court pointed out with respect to the test\nto be applied is whether or not, under all the\ncircumstances, the police conduct communicated to a\nreasonable person -- and that presupposes a reasonably --\na reasonable innocent person -- whether or not the\npassenger could have refused the officer's request to\nconsent or otherwise have terminated the -- terminated the\nencounter.\nThere is really nothing remarkable about the\nfacts of this case when you look at this Court's decision\nin Bostick and compare Bostick with this Court's decision\nin Robinette which clearly pointed --\nQUESTION: My question, Mr. Thompson, was your\nopening statement was that the Eleventh Circuit had ruled\nin direct conflict with this Court's precedent. If we're\napplying a totality of the circumstances test, that's one\ncircumstance that was present there, is not present here.\nSo, whether the Eleventh Circuit erred is for us to\ndetermine today, but I do think it's a bit much to say\nthat they -- they just disregarded this Court's precedent.\nMR. THOMPSON: Your Honor, the Eleventh Circuit\nconsidered factors that were unlike the factors that this\nCourt in Bostick believed were important in determining\nwhether the police conduct at issue was coercive. And\nmoreover, Your Honor, the Eleventh Circuit incorrectly\napplied the legal principles that this Court formulated\nwith respect to the facts of this case.\nFor example, the Eleventh Circuit noted the\nimportance of Officer Hoover at the front of the bus and\npointed out that his presence might lead a -- a passenger\nto believe that he or she could not leave the bus. Well,\nthis Court in Bostick clearly pointed out that the -- in a\n-- in the context of a bus interdiction effort, whether or\nnot the passenger could leave the bus was the wrong\nquestion. The question was whether or not the passenger\n-- whether or not the police conduct communicated to the\npassenger whether or not they could refuse the consent\nrequested or whether or not they could just terminate the\nquestioning of the police officer.\nQUESTION: Well, it's -- it's true that the --\nthe issue of whether someone could leave the bus or not is\n-- is not really an issue that -- that focuses the\nquestion, and we said so in Bostick. But it doesn't\nfollow from that that it was irrelevant in Bostick or that\nit's irrelevant here that there was an officer stationed\nat the front of the bus. If we're going to have a\ntotality of the circumstances test, wouldn't you agree\nthat that is one relevant fact to consider in trying to\nreconstruct the atmosphere and decide whether or not it\nsignaled to the -- to the person searched the -- the\npossibility of just ending the encounter?\nMR. THOMPSON: Yes, Your Honor. That -- it is\none relevant fact to be taken into consideration with the\nother factors, but here the officer stationed at the front\nof the bus -- at the front of the bus really did not\ncommunicate, nor did Officer Lang who was doing the\nquestioning -- did not communicate that -- to any\npassenger that he or she could not terminate the\nquestioning.\nQUESTION: He did -- nobody said, you can't\nleave the bus. But isn't it a fact that a passenger would\ntake into some consideration that there was an officer\nstationed at the front of the bus?\nMR. THOMPSON: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: He wasn't keeping people out,\napparently.\nMR. THOMPSON: Excuse me.\nQUESTION: It's -- it's a relevant fact in\ndetermining the coerciveness of the atmosphere, is it not?\nMR. THOMPSON: Your Honor, not in this case.\nThe court below and the Eleventh Circuit acknowledged in\n-- in their findings, if you will, that the -- the aisle\nwas not blocked, the exit was not blocked. In fact,\nevery --\nQUESTION: Let me -- let me try a -- a different\nsuggestion. The fact that the officer at the front of the\nbus was kneeling in the driver's seat was one graphic\nreminder of another fact in this case, and that is, that\nthe driver was gone. The driver had left the bus. The\nonly people exercising any kind of official capacity in\nthat bus were three police officers. One of them was\noccupying the driver's seat. Isn't that a signal that\nnobody is going to be going anywhere on this bus? This\nbus isn't going to be going anywhere until the officers\nare satisfied.\nNow, that may or may not be dispositive of\nanything, but it is a relevant fact on the question of\ncoercion and voluntariness. Isn't it?\nMR. THOMPSON: Your Honor, the presence of the\nofficer at the front of the bus is a factor, but in the\ncontext of these facts and if -- in the context of this\nCourt's decision in Delgado where you had armed agents\nsurrounding the factory, and this Court held that simply\nbecause the factory workers could not leave without\npassing those agents --\nQUESTION: I agree with you. You're -- you're\nabsolutely right there. The -- the point that I'm making\nis that you can't go through this kind of analysis and\nsay, well, this fact is irrelevant. This shouldn't have\nbeen considered by the court. That fact was irrelevant.\nThat shouldn't have been considered. It was a relevant\nfact. What it all adds up to, as you suggest by the\nDelgado reference, is a different question, but it's a\nrelevant fact, isn't it?\nMR. THOMPSON: It's a relevant fact, but the\nfactors to be considered and the factors that this Court\nclearly announced in -- in the Bostick case were factors\nthat were threatening, factors that were otherwise\ncoercive, like pointing a gun. In this particular case,\nYour Honor, the Eleventh Circuit even noted that there was\nno evidence that any of the passengers saw that this\nofficer was armed. The officers were --\nQUESTION: Mr. Thompson, did they know that he\nwas an officer? Was it clear that he was an officer?\nMR. THOMPSON: The officer was conducting\nindividual passenger-specific questioning.\nQUESTION: The -- the other two officers were I\nknow, but was there -- was it clear that the person\nkneeling in the driver's seat was an officer?\nMR. THOMPSON: He was casually dressed, Your\nHonor, and it's not clear from the record as to whether or\nnot he was a police officer.\nQUESTION: Did he have his badge? The other two\nshowed their badges. Did the one in the front show --\nMR. THOMPSON: I don't believe the record is\nclear as to where the badge was located with respect to\nthe officer at the front of the bus.\nQUESTION: Did he enter with the other two?\nMR. THOMPSON: Yes. They all entered as\npassengers, all casually dressed.\nAnd with respect to the conduct of this -- of\nthis search --\nQUESTION: Well, I mean, I -- what -- I don't\nknow what that -- why should that make a difference. If\nsomebody shows me a badge and he's casually dressed, I\nknow he's got a gun, or he's going to be fired. An\nofficer is fired if he doesn't carry his gun. Everybody\nknows that.\nLet me -- let me ask you this. Would it be\nappropriate in your view for this Court to write an\nopinion in which we say that citizens have certain\nobligations to know their rights and to assert their\nrights? That's what makes for a strong democracy. The\nlaw lives in the consciousness of the people. And people\nhave a certain obligation to assert their rights. If they\ndon't want to be searched, they say I don't want to be\nsearched. Should we write that in an opinion?\nMR. THOMPSON: Well, that follows on with the --\nthe clear test that this Court announced in Bostick, and\nthe test was, Your Honor, whether or not the police\nconduct commuted anything -- communicated anything to the\ncitizens and these passengers as to --\nQUESTION: What about the proposition as I -- as\nI've stated it? Because if you say yes -- and I think\nthere's a good answer for it -- then I'd just say, well,\nwe have to distinguish Miranda at least. Miranda is based\non a contrary assumption. That's what's running through\nmy mind as I'm asking the question.\nMR. THOMPSON: Well, here -- here the -- the\ncitizens -- some citizens did refuse Officer Lang's\nrequest, and what -- what you posit is -- is really the\nguts of what is going on here. As Officer Lang testified,\nYour Honor, many of the citizens -- most citizens went\nalong with the police questioning in -- in this particular\n-- these particular bus interdictions, and they -- and\nthey were happy to do so. Officer Lang testified that\nmany of the bus passengers appreciated his efforts in\ncoming onto the bus. They -- it made them feel a sense of\n-- of safety.\nAnd here citizens generally do know their\nrights, and here the police did not communicate anything\nto these passengers that would indicate that they had to\nanswer, that they were required or otherwise compelled to\nanswer Officer Lang's questions.\nQUESTION: Did any other case that we considered\ninvolve a body pat-down, not just a request to look at\nluggage? This -- in this case the -- the luggage didn't\nturn up anything of interest to the police, but the pat-\ndown did.\nAnd the image of let's take what is -- Mr.\nDrayton is sitting next to a man who has just been hauled\noff the bus, handcuffed. I imagine he would feel some\nintimidation at that point when the police then turned to\nhim and said, okay, we'd like to search you too.\nMR. THOMPSON: Well, the -- the Bostick test\npresupposes a reasonable, innocent person. In this\nparticular case, Mr. -- Mr. Brown's consent was\nunambiguous. He opened his coat. He -- in response to\nthe question, he said, sure. He opened his coat. He took\nout a cell phone.\nQUESTION: But Drayton said nothing throughout\nthe whole encounter.\nMR. THOMPSON: Drayton's -- Drayton's consent,\nas the district court found, was clear and unambiguous.\nHe raised his hands off of his thighs, Your Honor. There\nwas nothing that Officer Lang said to Mr. -- or said to\nMr. Drayton or had said to Mr. Brown that would have\nindicated that Mr. Drayton could not have terminated the\nquestioning or that he could have refused consent.\nAnd as this Court noted -- as this Court noted\nin Bostick, the fact that a lawbreaker knows that the\nsearch is going to uncover contraband or is -- knows that\nthe search is going to uncover drugs does not make the\nconsent involuntary.\nQUESTION: Well, it doesn't make it involuntary,\nbut it -- it does suggest perhaps that there is an\nambiguity here as -- as against your claim that there was\nnone in Brown's consent because -- and correct me if I'm\nwrong on the facts, but I -- I think the first request to\nBrown was -- or maybe to the two of them together -- can I\nlook at your -- your luggage, your bag, whatever they had\npointed to, and they said, sure. And I presume they said\nsure because they knew there was nothing in it that was\ngoing to be incriminating. So, the officer looked in the\n-- in the luggage and he found nothing.\nThen he turned to Brown and said, mind if I do a\npat-down, or whatever the phrase was. Well, that's the\nsearch that's in question here, and I would have thought\nthat at that point Brown was in the situation in which the\nreasonable citizen would have thought I'm damned if I do\nand I'm damned if I don't. If he pats me down and he's --\nhe's thorough about it, he's going to find the -- the\ndrugs. If I say you can't pat me down, having just given\npermission to him to -- to look in the -- in the bag, he's\ngoing to know that there must be something on me that\nwasn't on the bag. And -- and, therefore, it seems to me\nthat the -- that Brown at that point was by no means in a\nposition in which he had a kind of free choice to say yes\nor no. So, it sounds to me as though it is ambiguous.\nHave I got the facts wrong?\nMR. THOMPSON: You have the facts, but your\nconclusion, Your Honor, I would differ with because in --\nin the situation both individuals pointed to the bag.\nThere was nothing in Officer Lang's request to Mr. Brown\nthat would -- that would -- that -- that would send or\ncommunicate to Mr. Brown that he could not have refused\nthe request. There was nothing in Officer Lang's question\nthat would indicate to Mr. Brown that he could not have\notherwise terminated the questioning. Why some of the --\nQUESTION: Well, you don't agree, I hope, with\nthe -- with the proposition that there would be no reason\nto decline the pat-down search except the reason that he\nhad something incriminating on him. I mean, the mere fact\nthat you've -- you've acceded to the luggage search, which\nis a much less intrusive search, does not show that --\nthat you have something to hide when you -- when you\ndecline to -- to have a pat-down. Don't -- don't you\nagree that a consent to a luggage search is a lot less\ndifficult to obtain than consent to a pat-down?\nMR. THOMPSON: The nature -- the nature of the\nsearch is not necessary to the Bostick inquiry.\nQUESTION: Well, I think you're -- I think\nyou're missing my point. Justice Souter was suggesting\nthat having acceded to the luggage search, the only\nplausible reason for objecting to the pat-down would be\nthat I have something on me that is incriminating. And I\n-- I acceded to the luggage search because I knew there\nwas nothing incriminating. But don't you think that an\ninnocent citizen could agree to a -- a policeman's search\nof luggage but not agree to a pat-down?\nMR. THOMPSON: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And -- and, of course, I would\nagree --\nQUESTION: You know, let's be reasonable here.\nQUESTION: Yes. But don't -- don't you think\nthe most probable inference is the inference I gave you?\nMR. THOMPSON: No, Your Honor. You have --\nagain, you have to understand this Court's holding in\nBostick and that is the --\nQUESTION: The holding in Bostick, if I remember\nit, was that the Florida Supreme Court was wrong in\nadopting a per se rule and left open the question of\nwhether there was a seizure in that case. Isn't that\nright?\nMR. THOMPSON: Yes, Your Honor. But in this\nparticular case, the reasonable person, as this Court\nsaid, presupposes a reasonable, innocent person.\nLawbreakers sometimes agree to be -- agree to be searched,\nknowing that the drugs are in their luggage or on their\nperson, for a number of reasons, sometimes as -- as these\ngentlemen did. They want to be cooperative. They do not\nwant to send some kind of message that they indeed have\nthe items in question. They want to appear innocent.\nThey do this for any number of reasons, hoping that the\npolice officer will not search them and go away.\nQUESTION: Mr. Thompson, you --\nMR. THOMPSON: It has nothing to do with --\nQUESTION: -- you were about to say --\nMR. THOMPSON: -- compulsion. Excuse me.\nQUESTION: -- that the police -- you were about\nto say when the police go over the line. I think you said\nhere they did nothing that would imply that consent or\nthat -- that the search was required of the citizen. What\n-- can -- can you give a description of when the police\nwould step over the line? Is it -- must the police give\nwords of command, get up, I want to search you? Is that\n-- does it take that?\nMR. THOMPSON: The -- if -- if the police would\ncommunicate to the citizen somehow that the citizen's\nresponse was compelled. For example, in -- in Bostick\nthis Court noted that pointing guns, drawn guns would lead\nto that -- that kind of compulsion or coercion. For\nexample, if the police used threatening language. If the\npolice communicated to the reasonable person that he or\nshe could not refuse the request for consent or could not\notherwise terminate the questioning.\nQUESTION: And that explains Miranda, of course,\nto the extent anything explains it.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: That -- that was a custodial\ninterrogation, wasn't it?\nMR. THOMPSON: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And the -- the physical custody would\nhave had that -- that effect of -- of causing the person\nto believe that he had no choice.\nMR. THOMPSON: Absolutely. Here you have\nunstructured, rapidly developing police-citizen\nencounters, and what is important here --\nQUESTION: And you have a request and a\nresponse. And the response is that there is no objection\nto the search. And it seems to me that that is an\nobjective consideration of the highest importance.\nMR. THOMPSON: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: May I ask, Mr. Thompson, do you\nregard this primarily as a seizure case or a search case?\nMR. THOMPSON: This is a seizure case, Your\nHonor. That's the -- the court below decided this case\nunder the -- under the Bostick test. Both parties before\nthe Eleventh Circuit urged the Bostick test, and this is\n-- I would submit that this is a seizure case.\nQUESTION: Do you think it always would follow\nif you concluded that there was no seizure, that there was\nnecessarily voluntary consent to the search?\nMR. THOMPSON: If there was no seizure?\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. THOMPSON: It -- in this Court's test in\nBostick, the Court merged the voluntary issue and the\nvoluntariness in with the -- in with the Bostick seizure\nanalysis. So, I would say that -- that the two are merged\ntogether and are related.\nQUESTION: It doesn't seem to me that\nanalytically they have to be. It seems to me you could\nhave a case in which you could -- the officer could say to\nthe man, you're perfectly free to get off the bus anytime\nyou want to, but I'd like to -- to search you first, and\nmay I do so? And then the question would be whether the\nsearch was voluntary even if there had been no seizure.\nIt seems to me that could be a scenario that would make\nsense.\nMR. THOMPSON: It's -- it's hard to -- in the\ncontext of these bus -- police-citizen encounters on a\nbus, it's hard to really see the distinction between the\nvoluntariness test and the seizure test.\nQUESTION: But it does seem to me the passenger\nmight have two different thoughts. One, I better not get\noff the bus. I want to get to Columbus or Cleveland or\nwherever we're going. So, I -- that -- maybe I can get\noff the bus, but it just doesn't make any sense. But\nthat's one inquiry. The second inquiry is, do I want to\nlet this fellow search me? It seems to me they are really\ntwo separate questions.\nMR. THOMPSON: I don't know, Your Honor, but I\n-- I would posit here that we do not really need in this\nparticular case to -- to understand the full extent of the\nscope of the voluntariness test because the court below\nclearly decided this case under Bostick and as a seizure\ncase.\nQUESTION: A seizure of the person or seizure of\nthe contraband?\nMR. THOMPSON: The person, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: If we were writing on a blank slate\nand other cases weren't there, what would be the\nDepartment's objections to a rule of law that said when\nyou're on a bus, only 11 inches of an aisle, three people\nget on. One is sitting in the back looking over the\ncrowd. The other two systematically work their way to the\nfront. What would be the objection to saying, policeman,\nof course, you can ask citizens to cooperate? Certainly\nthat's a very desirable thing. But in those closed,\ncramped quarters where you have three, just say you don't\nhave to answer if you don't want to. You don't have to be\nsearched if you don't want to, making clear that you're\neliciting voluntary cooperation and nobody is under\ncompulsion. What would be the objection to that?\nMR. THOMPSON: Well, as this Court noted in\nBostick, Your Honor, just because the police-citizen\nencounter happens on a bus, there's no reason to establish\nsome kind of per se rule.\nQUESTION: Well, I assume Congress could enact a\nstatute like that, couldn't it, for Federal officers?\nCouldn't Congress prescribe that whenever Federal drug\nagents enter a bus, they -- and to conduct a -- a search,\nthey shall make such a statement?\nMR. THOMPSON: I -- I don't know --\nQUESTION: You would have no problem with\nCongress doing that, would you?\nMR. THOMPSON: I would -- I would say, Your\nHonor, here that --\nQUESTION: It might. It might be bad policy.\nAnd my question was are there policy objections to -- I'm\nnot saying what the constitutional rule is. I understand\nthose arguments. I'm just, for my own benefit, trying to\nfind out if that would cause a practical problem or not.\nMR. THOMPSON: I can think of three reasons.\nYour Honor, this Court has consistently held that we --\nyou do not want to saddle law enforcement officers with\nsome kind of bright line test in Fourth Amendment cases.\nThat's very important here when I would submit that\nBostick is an appropriate vehicle to determine the\nvalidity of consent.\nIn these particular cases, it's -- it's very\ndifficult. You have an unstructured, rapidly evolving and\ndeveloping situation, and warnings would not be --\nQUESTION: And one of the difficulties with --\nwith a warning is, you know, Miranda was supposed to be a\nbright line test where, you know, we didn't have to argue\nabout anything. Well, we had at least 60 or 70 cases here\ndeciding whether somebody introduced -- was interrogating\nand that sort of thing. So, if you have some sort of a\nrequirement like that, it's just another layer of\nlitigation.\nMR. THOMPSON: Absolutely, Your Honor, and I\nwould direct the Court's attention to a case that was\ncited in the Government's brief, United States v.\nStephens, where there was some appropriate warning, and\nthe court -- the Ninth Circuit in that particular case\nsaid that the warning confused the passengers, intimidated\nthe passengers. But --\nQUESTION: Well, I assume the other policy\nobjection is, the underlying premise of Justice Breyer's\nsuggestion is the Government has some obligation to teach\neverybody about their rights. And that's a -- that's a\nsweeping proposition.\nMR. THOMPSON: I would agree.\nQUESTION: Especially when it's not required by\nthe Constitution.\nMR. THOMPSON: I would agree, Justice --\nQUESTION: May I ask you what significance, if\nany -- I don't know if it's significant or not -- do you\nattach to the fact that, as I understand it from the court\nof appeals opinion, that this officer had made similar\nrequests several hundred times and only five or six people\nhad ever said no? Is that relevant at all?\nMR. THOMPSON: It is not relevant, Your Honor.\nSome people did say no. Most people --\nQUESTION: You don't think that suggests that\nperhaps most people thought they had an obligation to\nanswer?\nMR. THOMPSON: Well, Your Honor, as this Court\n-- as this Court held in Delgado, simply because most\ncitizens cooperate and most citizens agree with the\nofficer's request, that's no indication that the consent\nat issue is involuntary.\nIf there are no further questions, I would like\nto reserve the remainder of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Thompson.\nMs. Spivey, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GWENDOLYN SPIVEY\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMS. SPIVEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis Court should reaffirm Bostick in its\nentirety. We are not arguing that advice should be\nrequired. Rather, we think that Bostick got it entirely\nright with the language that advice is a factor\nparticularly worth noting. If Bostick is revised, we\nwould ask the Court to remand to the court of appeals, as\nit did in Bostick, so that it can reconsider.\nI believe the key to this test -- and I don't\nmean to sound presumptuous. Having thought long and hard,\nI think the key is that the Eleventh Circuit really was\ntrying to give voice to the seizure or -- and the consent\ntest, as set out in Bostick. In Bostick at U.S. 437, the\nCourt wrote -- it focused on what the police conduct --\nconduct would have communicated to a reasonable person.\nAnd in Washington at 1357 and Guapi at 1395,\nwhat the Eleventh Circuit focused on -- it said, it is\nenough that the circumstances themselves would indicate\nthat the search can proceed only if consent is given. So,\nI believe that the Eleventh Circuit parallels Bostick's\nuse of the word -- that focused on what does it\ncommunicate with their use of the word indicate. And\nindicate necessarily refers back to -- it expressly refers\nback to the circumstances, which is the totality.\nAnd while courts tend to focus most commonly on\nwhether or not advice was given or not given, I think\nthere are any number of acts or omissions that focus on\nthe police conduct --\nQUESTION: That -- that I think is true, but\ncould -- if their point is that if -- if you were to take\nyour case, this case before us, and say under the present\nlaw and the test that you're enunciating, that you do have\nto tell the passengers what I suggested earlier -- tell\nthem they don't have to answer or respond -- well, then\nyou'd have to in every case. So, why don't you give me an\nexample of one where they wouldn't.\nMS. SPIVEY: Yes, sir. I would -- I would posit\na -- a -- I could posit a scenario, and the best one I\nthought of is that that we've all flown on airplanes and\n--\nQUESTION: No. On a bus. Could you possibly do\n-- because actually oddly enough Bostick is about buses.\nMS. SPIVEY: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: And -- and there -- it's about buses.\nMS. SPIVEY: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: And the buses are stopped and\nsomebody comes on. All right. So, what is -- can you\nthink of any example in those circumstances where they\nwouldn't have to make that announcement?\nMS. SPIVEY: Yes, sir. In a -- besides\nreferring to the specific factors here and suggesting that\nthe police conduct ratchet down the coerciveness of any\nfactor, I would suggest that if the police did not delay\nthe -- the departure of the bus, did not engage in bag-\nmatching, and did not do any more than a -- a flight\nattendant does standing in the aisle and talking\nindividually to the passenger and does not use language\nthat would communicate to a reasonable, innocent person\nthat cooperation is required -- for example, using\nlanguage that it's voluntary. They could use language\nthat it's voluntary. They could say, are you willing,\nwith your permission.\nOr specifically in this case, relating to Mr.\nDrayton, they could engage in acts. For example, when you\nask --\nQUESTION: Didn't they use language like that in\nthis case? Did they say, you know, open your coat, I want\nto pat you down?\nMS. SPIVEY: They used --\nQUESTION: Didn't they make it clear that they\nwere asking permission which suggests that the person has\nthe ability to deny permission?\nMS. SPIVEY: Respectfully, Justice Scalia, I\ndon't believe so. I think it was very clear that what\nthey were asking for was cooperation.\nQUESTION: What -- what words did they use in --\nin particular?\nMS. SPIVEY: They immediately approached each\nindividual passenger --\nQUESTION: Right.\nMS. SPIVEY: -- and said, I'm Officer so and so.\nI'm doing this.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMS. SPIVEY: Do you have a bag on the bus?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. SPIVEY: I believe that point right there\ndenied the Bostick right to refuse to engage with the\nofficer.\nQUESTION: Wait. And -- and that's all they\nasked, and when the person said yes, they immediately\nsearched the bag?\nQUESTION: No.\nMS. SPIVEY: No.\nQUESTION: Surely, surely they required more.\nMS. SPIVEY: Then they asked another question.\nQUESTION: What was the other question that they\nasked?\nQUESTION: On page 4 of the Government's\nbrief --\nMS. SPIVEY: Do you mind --\nQUESTION: -- it says, do you mind if I check\nit?\nMS. SPIVEY: Do you mind if I check it?\nQUESTION: Does -- does that not suggest exactly\nwhat you want them to suggest, that the person has the\nability to withhold that consent?\nMS. SPIVEY: No, Justice Scalia. In Schneckloth\nat U.S. 229, this Court referred to the, quote, subtly\ncoercive police questions. And I think one really does\nhave to look at the nuances of the questions and how a\nreasonable, innocent person would take them.\nQUESTION: Well, what is the nuance of a\nquestion, do you mind if I inspect it?\nMS. SPIVEY: Because I think no matter how a\nreasonable, innocent person answers it, Mr. Chief Justice,\nthe police can construe it as consent. If they say --\nQUESTION: But -- well, is there any doubt that\nthis person answered it in a way that indicated consent?\nMS. SPIVEY: Mr. Chief Justice, I believe there\nis doubt because I believe -- not as to the bag, but as to\nthe question, do you mind if I check your person. I do\nbelieve there's definitely doubt because of the indirect\nquestion and also because of his --\nQUESTION: Well, what's -- what's indirect? Do\nyou mind if I check your person?\nMS. SPIVEY: Because no matter whether you\nanswer it yes or no, it's not may I check your person. If\nyou say no, it means no. Yes means yes. But if you say,\ndo you mind if I, if the person says yes --\nQUESTION: So, it -- it turns on that sort of a\nsubtle distinction?\nMS. SPIVEY: I think it can, Your Honor. I\nthink it's one factor --\nQUESTION: But if we do, then don't we have to\nfollow the district court? I mean, the district court\nthere concluded in the facts that everything was\ncooperative, there was nothing coercive, there was nothing\nconfrontational.\nMS. SPIVEY: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: And he heard the officer and he heard\nthe tone of voice. So, how -- how could we possibly get\naround that?\nMS. SPIVEY: Well, Justice Breyer, the district\ncourt applied the wrong test. It applied the free-to-\nleave test. That -- that's at the joint appendix at 132,\nand that's specifically what this Court rejected in\nBostick the Florida Supreme Court had done.\nHe also -- I disagree with the Government's\nrepresentation that he said that Mr. Drayton was clear or\nunambiguous. He did not address -- he did not make any\nfactual findings as to the actual encounter. And --\nQUESTION: The freedom-to-leave test actually is\n-- is more beneficial for your client. Everybody knows\nyou're not free to leave the bus. You'll miss the bus.\nmean, that's -- that's what we said in Bostick. So, it\nseems to me that the district court applied a higher\nstandard than -- than was necessary and still found\nvoluntary search.\nMS. SPIVEY: Well, Justice Kennedy, from my\nperspective, the important point is that he applied the\nwrong test, the test this Court has rejected.\nAnd also, he made two other legal --\nQUESTION: Do you want us to reverse because\nthere was a test that's too favorable to your client? I\ndon't understand that.\nMS. SPIVEY: No. I -- I have no -- I have no\nobjection with the Bostick test, either the test for\nseizure at U.S. 437 or the test for consent at U.S. 438.\nI think that the court of appeals then applied the correct\ntest and overturned the -- the legal conclusion which the\ndistrict court reached.\nThe district court said that -- he made a global\nconclusion. He said, quote, their consent leads me to\nbelieve there was no violation. Well, I think that, with\nall respect, is a tautology. Just because they consent,\nit doesn't mean there's no violation. And I think that --\nhe said --\nQUESTION: Surely he meant their consent in\nthose circumstances. Didn't he recite in the opinion all\nof the circumstances involved?\nMS. SPIVEY: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Don't you think it's a little unfair\nto -- to read that after -- after he describes the whole\nsituation as simply saying, well, since they consented, it\nmust be okay?\nMS. SPIVEY: Justice Scalia --\nQUESTION: I mean, you can say, you know, I'm\ngoing to torture you if you don't let me look at it.\nOkay, okay, okay, look at it.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Surely nobody is going to say his\nconsent shows that it was voluntary.\nMS. SPIVEY: No, Justice Scalia, I don't agree\nwith the first part of the question because the district\ncourt made no findings whatsoever regarding the specifics\nof the actual encounter or exchange between the -- the\ndefendants and the -- or the police officers and\nindividual passengers.\nQUESTION: Did you ask for findings -- did you\nask for findings that were that detailed?\nMS. SPIVEY: The trial -- neither trial counsel\nfor the Government nor the defense did, Your Honor.\nBut the district court then said there's nothing\ncoercive about this encounter, and I believe that's an\nultimate legal conclusion which, when the court of appeals\napplied the correct test from Bostick, reached the correct\nresult.\nQUESTION: As far as Drayton is concerned,\nthere's nothing in the record other than that he lifted\nhis hands from his lap. Is there -- he didn't utter any\nwords, and so his consent rides on that gesture and what\nit meant.\nMS. SPIVEY: Yes. Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that\nis correct. And I think it's clear under Schneckloth and\nBumper that mere acquiescence -- and that was -- is not\nsufficient. And that's why I was saying I think that the\npolice conduct can be either acts or -- and/or omissions.\nAnd I think the omission here or the act here was simply\nnot waiting on an answer.\nQUESTION: Excuse me. When -- when you're asked\na question, do you mind if I conduct a pat-down, and you\nraise up your arms like that, what -- what does that\nnaturally convey?\nMS. SPIVEY: I think that's a classic example,\nYour Honor -- after you've just watched the other\npassenger arrested and hauled across the top of you,\nthat's a classic example of mere acquiescence to a show of\nauthority.\nQUESTION: Mere acquiescence.\nQUESTION: That's apparently the opposite --\nQUESTION: Acquiescence would be just to sit\nthere, it seems to me.\nQUESTION: I mean, isn't that the opposite of\nwhat the district court thought --\nMS. SPIVEY: The district --\nQUESTION: -- who saw all this? I mean, the\ndistrict court heard the witnesses. He heard the tone of\nvoice. I mean, I don't see how to get very far with this\nnotion of the question.\nWhat about the other two things? Was this a\ncase where the passengers knew that the bags were being\nmatched?\nMS. SPIVEY: Justice Breyer, in response to your\nfirst question, the district court never addressed the\nspecifics of Mr. Drayton's nonverbal response --\nQUESTION: All right. I -- I see it.\nWhat about -- but was this a case where the --\nwhere -- was this a case where the passengers knew that\nthe bags were being matched?\nMS. SPIVEY: I think it was very clear. I don't\nthink a reasonable person sitting in that bus, unless they\nwere deaf, could not have known that the bags -- they were\nasking every person, do you -- as the first question. Do\nyou have a bag? If they did, may I check it. In fact,\nOfficer Lang --\nQUESTION: Well, I don't know what you meant\nthen by bags being matched. I thought you meant that they\nwent outside or did something. I --\nMS. SPIVEY: No, Your Honor. The carry-on\nluggage, which this Court, you know, focused on in Bond,\nthe privacy of that carry-on luggage. I believe that the\nGovernment -- the officer used that as a means of\nbasically forcing an encounter by asking a person, do you\nhave a bag.\nAnd Stephens pointed out the Hobson's choice\nthat a passenger faces. They don't -- it -- it denies\ntheir right to ignore the officer because if they say\nnothing, the bag is construed as abandoned. You have to\nrespond to the officer. So, I think Bostick gives you the\nright to ignore --\nQUESTION: An American citizen has to protect\nhis rights once in a while. That's -- that's a very bad\nthing?\nMS. SPIVEY: I think the Bostick, Justice\nKennedy, gave citizens, bus passengers, the right to\nignore officers.\nQUESTION: Of course. The right to say,\nofficer, don't bother me.\nMS. SPIVEY: But that's not ignoring them, Your\nHonor. That's having to engage with them, and I think\nthat's part of the technique that's used, is getting a\nperson -- if you can get them to --\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I don't read Bostick that\nway.\nNow, this -- this argument that because the\nfirst person is arrested, the second person feels coerced,\nthat seems to me it goes the other way around. The second\nperson now knows the consequences of giving consent.\nUnder your theory, the first person is arrested and the\nsecond person says, oh, I -- I'd like to be arrested too.\nCome and search me.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. SPIVEY: I don't think --\nQUESTION: That -- that doesn't make sense.\nMS. SPIVEY: I don't think a reasonable,\ninnocent person would take what happened to -- to a\npassenger sitting next to him as anything but a classic\nexample of a show of authority.\nIn -- in response to your question, Justice\nKennedy, to the Government earlier, I think that putting\nthe burden on the citizen shifts the -- the burden is on\nthe Government in every case to prove that the encounter\nis consensual and that any consent given is voluntary and\nis uncoerced. And I think --\nQUESTION: The question is whether or not the\nGovernment also has the burden to educate citizens as to\ntheir rights in every encounter, whether or not there\nisn't some obligation on the part of the citizen to know\nand to exercise his rights or her rights.\nMS. SPIVEY: Justice Kennedy, I believe that\nthat ignores the demographic realities of the reasonable\nbus passenger. The Government acknowledged below that\nmost bus passengers are economically disadvantaged, and\nthey don't know who their Congressman is or the Governor.\nThey don't -- that was not acknowledged below. I don't\nmean --\nQUESTION: So, you want people to travel on\nbuses where people might have weapons and drugs and can't\nbe searched. You think that's better for passengers.\nMS. SPIVEY: Certainly not, Your Honor.\nCertainly not, but I think there is a limit to the\nimposition on millions of innocent people for the purpose\nof ferreting out ordinary criminal wrongdoing. And to the\nextent that the -- the departure of this bus was delayed,\nI think this case is right on point with the Edmund case.\nTo the extent they delayed the forward movement of that\nbus, I believe every passenger on it was seized even\nthough I disagree that the court below addressed the\nseizure issue.\nQUESTION: Ms. Spivey, is there anything in the\nrecord that -- that indicates whether the police knew that\nthese two people were traveling together?\nMS. SPIVEY: They knew that they were seated\nnext to each other in a seat. There was no testimony\nwhatsoever -- there was testimony that the officer had\nseen the respondents in -- depending on which transcript\nwe're looking at. There is testimony in the joint\nappendix that the officer had seen them boarding the bus,\nand that is at J.A. 105. In response to questioning by\nthe court, he indicated he had seen them boarding the bus,\nbut there was no testimony in this record that he ever saw\nthem together before he saw them seated next to each other\nin the seat.\nAnd the other point I wanted to make, going to\nthat question, if I might, is that --\nQUESTION: Well, the -- he did associate the two\nof them because of the fact that they were both wearing\nheavy, baggy clothes, although the weather wasn't that\ncold in Tallahassee at the time.\nMS. SPIVEY: Yes, sir. But he never said that\nthey were traveling together.\nQUESTION: Okay, but they're sitting next to\neach other, and unlike the other passengers in the bus,\nthey're all -- they're both wearing heavy, baggy clothes.\nI'm not sure that -- that the major result of\nthe first -- of the first seizure wouldn't really have\nbeen to give the police probable cause anyway to -- to\nsearch the second passenger, even without his consent.\nMS. SPIVEY: Well --\nQUESTION: You see -- you see two guys dressed\nextravagantly sitting next to each other. You search the\nfirst one and find drugs on him. You think you're not\ngoing to search the second?\nMS. SPIVEY: I think that if they had looked at\nthe -- at the passengers' tickets, they would have had\nreasonable suspicion, but I do not think there are any\nfacts in this case -- and the police officer -- they're\nthe best ones to judge -- and the prosecutor at trial all\nagreed there was no reasonable suspicion here.\nQUESTION: I would have searched the second one.\nI would have thought I had probable cause having two guys\nboth dressed in baggy clothes in warm weather, I find\ndrugs on the first, they're sitting next to each other.\nthink I would have probable cause to search the second.\nMS. SPIVEY: Yes, Justice Scalia, I think the\nrecord adequately points out reasons why all of those\nfactors could have been -- could have been determined to\nbe totally innocent. The innocent people could have been\ndoing that same thing. Baggy pants are very popular these\ndays. One can look anywhere and see them. There were\nreasons why they would have had their coats on.\nQUESTION: Not in Tallahassee in the summertime.\nMS. SPIVEY: It was February 4th, 1999, Your\nHonor, which is not --\nQUESTION: You -- you think that the police\nshould have asked them -- told the people in the bus\nyou're free to leave. That's basically -- would that make\nit all right in your opinion?\nMS. SPIVEY: No, Your Honor, because I --\nQUESTION: No. What -- what -- is it that the\npolice in your opinion can't search anyone in the bus?\nPeriod? What -- what is your view on that?\nMS. SPIVEY: I -- I don't believe that either.\nI think that -- I clearly agree with Bostick that on-bus\nsearches, consensual --\nQUESTION: No, no. I'm trying to -- I'm sorry.\nI misspoke. Your -- your view is that they should have\ntold the passengers explicitly in a strong way you do not\nhave to cooperate if you don't want to. Is that -- is\nthat your view?\nMS. SPIVEY: My view is that in a case like\nthis, which is at the margins, where a court of appeals\nlooks at it and feels that it's so coercive that there are\nvarious acts or omissions that the police can do to\nratchet down the coerciveness of the environment, or they\ncan choose to counter it, which the most -- the typical\nexample we see is the giving or -- or withholding of\nadvice. And certainly that's been determinative in some\nof the Court's cases or appears to have been outcome-\ndeterminative. But I think there are other things the\npolice can do.\nQUESTION: So, we -- we should accept the feel,\nas you describe it, of the court of appeals in this case?\nMS. SPIVEY: Well, Your Honor, I think that was\none of the main -- there were two main points of Arvizu.\nOne was to reject the divide and conquer approach of the\nGovernment that, well, because this -- this factor didn't\nweigh heavily, we shouldn't even look at it.\nBut the other was that it recognized the\nimportance of a court of appeals in a totality test,\nemploying de novo review, to unify precedent and to\nprovide guidance to district courts --\nQUESTION: What -- I'm trying to look at what to\ndo. I'm -- I'm not -- suppose I think for argument's sake\nin many circumstances where policemen come up and question\npeople, even if they say politely, are you willing to\nanswer my questions or be searched, the person feels\ncoerced. But the law still tries to draw a line even if\nthat's fictional in reality. Very well. What's the right\nline? I mean, are buses special? What is it that's\nsupposed to be done? That's what I'm trying to elicit\nfrom you.\nMS. SPIVEY: Justice Breyer, I don't believe I\ncan give this Court a bright line test because of the\ntotality of the circumstances. I think it's the nature of\nthe totality test that, under the right circumstances, any\nfactor can -- can serve to tip the balance in the right\ncircumstances. And so, I -- I don't think I can give a\nbright -- I don't think a bright line test can be devised\nwhen the totality of the circumstances --\nQUESTION: May I ask you a question that I keep\n-- perhaps this is sort of strange. But if the police\nmade it perfectly clear to everyone that they -- in the\nbus that there will be no adverse consequences whatsoever\nif you refuse to let me search your -- your luggage, why\nwould anyone let them search? Why --\nMS. SPIVEY: Well --\nQUESTION: In other words, I want to look\nthrough your luggage. Why would you say yes? If you know\nthere can be no adverse consequences, it seems to me they\nwould never be able to search anybody.\nMS. SPIVEY: Unless they had an overwhelming\ndesire to cooperate and have their personal stuff gone\nthrough.\nQUESTION: Well, what is the cooperation? We're\ngoing to let you find out that I don't have guns and drugs\nin my -- I know I don't have guns and drugs in my luggage.\nSo, why should -- don't -- don't bother me. I don't want\nyou to search me. I don't see why anyone would ever\nconsent if they knew it was totally risk-free.\nMS. SPIVEY: I agree, Justice Stevens.\nQUESTION: I don't agree. I -- I know it's\nrisk-free, and I would certainly give my consent. I think\nit's a good thing for the police to do.\nMS. SPIVEY: Well, Justice Scalia, I would\ncertainly never consent to them checking my person for\nanything. But I'm a lawyer and I know that --\nQUESTION: If I was dressed like that, I would.\nIf I was dressed like that on a hot day, I'd be\nprobably --\nQUESTION: On a hot day in February.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: I'm -- I'm only using the record,\nChief Justice. The record -- the record says it was\nunusually hot.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. SPIVEY: I would like to address the\nGovernment's argument that there is a per se rule in this\ncase. And one of the points they make is -- in their\nreply brief at 4, they argue that because we have not\nidentified one case in which the Eleventh Circuit has\nruled in favor of the Government in an on-bus case -- I\nhave been able to identify three unpublished decisions,\nwhich I'd like to cite to the Court. And at Mr. Souter's\ndirection, I will lodge them with the Clerk after\nargument. They are: the McLean case, which is case number\n01-10678, dated July 6th, 2001, after Washington; the\nReese case, 00-11291, dated March 15th, 2001; and the\nGarrett case, dated -- case number 97-2202, dated November\n19th, 1997.\nQUESTION: Does the Eleventh Circuit have any\nrule about using its unpublished opinions for any purpose\nother than preclusion in a particular case?\nMS. SPIVEY: It's considered persuasive\nauthority but not binding authority.\nBut my point was simply that if they had -- if\nthey had a de facto per se rule, then it would be outcome\n-- the presence or absence of rights would be outcome --\noutcome-determinative in every case. But in those three\ncases, which were on-bus searches, there was either no\nadvice or no mention of it in the opinion. And of course,\nthese unpublished opinions are very hard to get, but the\nGovernment gave me an incentive to find them.\nQUESTION: The -- the briefs make a big deal\nabout the fact that they didn't announce that everybody on\nthe bus first -- a general announcement what was going to\nhappen. I -- I -- it seems to me that if we go down that\nroad and it'd be like our cases, where one case says they\ndidn't look at the officer, and the next case said they\ndidn't look at the -- I -- I just think that's equivocal.\nI think you can argue that either way.\nAnd you go on for 15 pages in -- in your brief\nabout the -- the police chose the -- the locus, the bus\nlocus, the fact that they were close to the passengers,\nwhich they obviously had to be in the bus, and -- and\ntalked individually to each passenger, the officer's\nappearance and demeanor, they constructively blocked the\naisle, they presented their badges, but they didn't show\nthe gun.\nIt -- it seems to me this world you're creating\nfor us is -- is not strong for the Constitution. It seems\nto me a strong world is when officers respect people's\nrights and -- and people know what their rights are and --\nand assert their rights. I don't want to be searched.\nMS. SPIVEY: Well, Justice Kennedy --\nQUESTION: I don't want to be searched. Leave\nme alone.\nMS. SPIVEY: I agree that would be an ideal\nworld if all our citizens took civics or took law and knew\ntheir rights, but I don't believe they do.\nAnd I think the fact that we go through the\nfactors is simply a product of the totality test. That's\nnecessary to look at all the relevant factors in that\ntotality test. But I don't think there is any defining\npoint at which one -- a person can say I think it's up to\nthe court in every case, is this too coercive, does it go\ntoo far?\nI would note that in Bostick, Bostick did -- did\nset out the seizure test at 437, the consent test at 438.\nThe one thing it really in my mind didn't really clearly\nfocus on was the test that the Eleventh Circuit was\nlooking at. The question they looked at is whether the\ncircumstances here were so coercive that no reasonable\nperson could have given a consent that would have been\ndetermined to be voluntary. And I think that's why in the\ncourt's opinion, the court of appeals opinion -- this is\n-- excuse me -- footnote 4 at page 6a of the petition to\nthe appendix. That is why they then used the language --\nI'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's footnote 6 at page 8a. They\nthen used the language, quoting Bostick, but whether a\nreasonable person would have felt free to decline the\nofficer's request.\nAnd I think that is -- was their attempt to go\nto the element of was this -- was this a coercive\nenvironment. It distinguishes it from the seizure test\nwhich focuses on the police conduct and what it would have\ncommunicated and I -- and then the consent test, which is\nat 438, which focuses -- under Schneckloth includes a\nfocus on the personal factors, factors personal to the\ndefendant. And I think that's why the Court here said\nthat those factors personal to the defendant were not\ndeterminative because we're looking at a little higher\nlevel of analysis as to whether this environment was so\ncoercive.\nI do agree that in the context of your average\nbus case, it's a very short encounter, very brief. The\ntestimony was that in 15 to 20 minutes, the officer could\nengage with two to three people. So, you're looking maybe\n5 to 10 minutes per person. And I think that the test --\nthat the factors relating to seizure and the factors\nrelating to the -- the consent tend to be conflated, and\nso it is sometimes sort of hard to sort out. And a lot of\nthe factors will apply to both of those tests.\nQUESTION: Why -- why is it that the most\nimmediate expression of the police officers does not\ncounteract whatever other indications of compulsion might\nexist under the circumstances? I mean, if the policeman\ncomes up and says, you know, lean up against the wall,\nspread your legs, I'm going to pat you down, you're under\ncompulsion. But if he comes up and says, do you mind if I\nsearch your person, you know, I don't care what other --\nthere's a policeman in the front of the bus. Who cares?\nHe -- he has made it very clear that he's asking for your\npermission. What -- what more need he do than that? Do\nyou mind if I search your person?\nMS. SPIVEY: I believe, Justice Scalia, if the\nCourt ruled that, it would be a bright line test as\nopposed to a totality test. And I think one has to --\nwhen one applies a reasonable person -- reasonable,\ninnocent person test, one of necessity puts themselves in\nthe seat of that bus passenger. How do they feel? And\nthat's why, Justice Breyer, I tried to give the -- the\nlittle example of the airplane because --\nQUESTION: My problem, of course, is I think if\nyou go with an all-facts test, you've got to go with the\ndistrict court. He saw it and the court of appeals\ndidn't. And that's why I've been wondering if maybe\nthere's something inherently coercive about the bus\nenvironment that suggests a -- a need for a warning. But\nyou don't agree with that and -- and therefore I'm sort of\nstuck. And there we are.\nQUESTION: Why -- why don't you agree with that?\nI mean, it seemed that was almost the question that I -- I\nasked when -- when you were responding to Justice Stevens\nand you said, well, ultimately sure, anybody who gets\nthese warnings, with a teaspoonful of brains, is going to\nsay no, I -- I'm not going to let you search.\nAnd -- and it seemed to me that maybe the -- the\nanswer to the problem is there are some situations in\nwhich if you don't give the warning, it does get to the\npoint of -- or is virtually a -- a coercive situation per\nse, and it may be that there's no easy answer in those\ncircumstances.\nIf you don't let them know that they have a\nright to refuse, there's inherent coercion. If you do let\nthem know, most people are going to say, no, you can't\nsearch. But you resist that. You -- you don't regard it\nas inherently coercive. And I -- I guess I'm not sure why\nyou -- you resist it. Why isn't it?\nMS. SPIVEY: Justice Souter, personally yes, I\ndo agree with you. I think it is an inherently coercive\nenvironment. But I simply didn't take that position\nbecause I didn't think that was a position that I could --\nQUESTION: Sell.\nMS. SPIVEY: -- prevail upon.\nQUESTION: Sell to the Court?\n(Laughter.)\nMS. SPIVEY: Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I -- I did\nnot because of it being sort of a bright line.\nBut I guess my feel about it is that there seems\nto be some contradiction between when we talk about in\nMiranda, we're talking about a coercive -- we're talking\nabout someone who's suspected of a crime. There's\nprobable cause, and so we're going to give them some\nwarnings. But yet, a reasonable, innocent person,\nmillions of bus passengers -- they don't get anything.\nAnd there just -- I don't know -- it seems to me something\nwrong with that --\nQUESTION: Ms. Spivey, is there anything in the\nrecord about what the innocent people actually felt when\nthe police officers came on the bus?\nMS. SPIVEY: There's nothing but the testimony\nof the officer as to what he thinks they felt. There is\nno testimony of the passengers.\nQUESTION: So, we really don't know how the\ninnocent passengers felt.\nMS. SPIVEY: No, sir, we don't. We just have to\ntry to put ourselves in their shoes and how would we feel.\nNot being lawyers --\nQUESTION: The only testimony was -- Officer\nLang was the only one. He was one of the three. He was\none of the two questioners. He's the only one who\ntestified in the district court. Is that right?\nMS. SPIVEY: Yes, Justice Ginsburg.\nQUESTION: Do you think -- you haven't said\nanything about the difference between, say, a bus terminal\nor a street where when the police say whatever -- you --\nyou are in a large space. There is something different\nabout a bus and -- or the airplane cabin where you -- you\nare rather confined compared to being stopped in the\nstreet.\nMS. SPIVEY: I think that is the primary point\nthat goes to Justice Souter's question about why it is\ninherently coercive. It sort of goes back to a Royer's\nsituation where you had a person in a small, enclosed\nroom. But I personally -- if you're sitting in a seat and\nthat's why I said if -- if the person like a stewardess\nwould just stand there and not come right in your face,\nbut a person gets in your face, you can't move over, you\ncan't back up, I don't see how you could possibly get out\nof the seat without -- even if you wanted to. But that's\nnot the test.\nQUESTION: I thought the testimony showed that\nthe officer leaned over from the back, not in your face.\nMS. SPIVEY: The -- the district court\ncharacterized his style as sort of in your face. He\nclearly stood. His testimony was he was standing in the\naisle, but I guess behind -- he didn't say this. This is\nhow I understand it -- behind the arm -- behind the\narmrest so that a person could theoretically get their\nlegs out. My -- but he was very clearly leaning over 12\nto 18 inches from Mr. Drayton's face, holding his badge\nup.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Spivey.\nMS. SPIVEY: Thank you very much.\nQUESTION: Mr. Thompson, you have 4 minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LARRY D. THOMPSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. THOMPSON: Your Honor, I have a couple\npoints.\nThere was nothing in -- in the record that would\nindicate that the bus was in fact delayed.\nOn the -- on the consent point, the district\ncourt specifically held that the defendants consented\nafter hearing the evidence at the -- at the suppression\nhearing. And the respondents were not naive individuals\nor unable to understand or assert their -- their rights.\nRespondent Drayton was 26. He was employed for 6 of the\nlast 8 years, and he had experience in dealing with\nprevious drug charges. Respondent Brown was 29 and had\nbeen a -- a corrections officer.\nAnd the point with respect to Justice Breyer's\nquestion. Your Honor, buses, as -- as the Government\npointed out in its reply brief, buses today in today's\nenvironment are vulnerable. They are vulnerable to\nspecific public safety concerns, and the Government would\nsubmit that bus passengers are entitled to the kind of\nefficient, effective, and fair bus interdiction efforts\nthat are -- that characterize --\nQUESTION: Do passengers on the buses go through\nthe same kind of check that we do on airlines?\nMR. THOMPSON: No, they do not, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: That's -- that's what I was wondering\nbecause today people might think if you're on a airport\nand you don't go through the detector, you don't fly.\nWell, they might think that if you don't answer the\nquestions, you don't go --\nMR. THOMPSON: We do not --\nQUESTION: -- on the bus. And -- and -- so\nmaybe there's more need now for something.\nMR. THOMPSON: We -- we do not have that\nspecific kind of program, and certainly that was not the\n-- the reason relied upon for the consent in -- in the\nrecord below. But in this particular case, Your Honor,\nOfficer Lang testified that not only did most of the\npassengers that he encountered consent, but of them\nappreciated what he was doing. It gave them a sense of\ncomfort. It made them feel that their bus travel was\nsafe. And that would be the point that I would like to\nmake here.\nAnd unless the Court has any further questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nThompson.\n"
