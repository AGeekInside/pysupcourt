        "content": "(11:07 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument next this morning in Case 08-1191, Morrison v.\nNational Australia Bank.\nMr. Dubbs.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS A. DUBBS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. DUBBS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nGiven that the issue of subject matter\njurisdiction appears not to be in dispute, the issues\nbefore the Court today are:\nFirst, the scope of section 10(b) of the\n1934 Exchange Act when applied to alleged fraudulent\nconduct with respect to financial information that is to\nbe sent to Australia for incorporation into the\nfinancial statements of the Respondent, National\nAustralia Bank.\nAnd second, the reasonableness of the\napplication of the statute under these circumstances and\nthe norms of enforcement pursuant to the private cause\nof action or otherwise.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I guess there's also the\nissue of whether, if everybody is agreed that it is not\na jurisdictional question, that's the end of the case.\nI mean, as I recall, the other side says we shouldn't\nget to the merits.\nMR. DUBBS: Your Honor, it's our view that\nthat -- that is a possible outcome, which of course as I\nunderstand it would leave -- leave the decision below\nstanding. We have urged in the supplemental brief that\nit may want to remand for consideration of the change of\nposition of the Securities and Exchange Commission with\nrespect to the tests that they have -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you are not -- you are\nnot pressing that?\nMR. DUBBS: No, we still believe that the\nbest way to handle the case is to remand; but we leave\nthat for the Court's discretion.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why wouldn't that simply\nbe going through the motions? The Second Circuit put\nthe wrong label on it, but everything it said could have\nbeen plugged into: Our decision is under Rule 12(b)(6)\nrather than 12(b)(1)?\nMR. DUBBS: Well, Your Honor, the question\nand the issue is inherently somewhat speculative as to\nwhat the Second Circuit would do, but we would rely not\nnecessarily only on the subject matter jurisdiction\nissues being addressed -- and Your Honor is quite right\nthat they may say, well, the label's changed, but\neverything else stays the same. What we particularly\nthought might be instructive for this Court is to hear\nwhat the Second Circuit that sits in our nation's\nfinancial capital thought of a new fact, and that new\nfact is that for the first time the Securities and\nExchange Commission has come in and said as a matter of\nadministrative deference the Court should defer to our\ntest in cases like that.\nSure, they have submitted amicus briefs in\nthe past. They have done lots of things. But this is\nthe first time they have said: We as the agency\nresponsible for the statute have said this is how courts\nshould handle the case. That's what's new and\ndifferent, but if Your Honors don't wish to proceed\nalong that line we are prepared to go forward on -- on\nthe merits here today.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it seems to me that\nisn't worth anything, right? I mean, that's -- they\nhaven't conducted a rulemaking or anything.\nMR. DUBBS: Well, they haven't conducted -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They just -- just appeared\nin court.\nMR. DUBBS: Well, they haven't conducted a\nfull rulemaking that would be entitled to Chevron\ndeference.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. DUBBS: But they have done something\nless than that. And whether it's entitled to deference,\nSkidmore deference, or something lesser than that is an\nopen point. But so we leave it to the Court's decision\nas to whether it is just -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Except that they don't come\nout on your side anyway, do they?\nMR. DUBBS: Well, Your Honor, they come out\non our side except for that last turn they make at the\nend, where they -- they bring in the intervening clause\nat the end of the last act. Other than that -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How could they come down\non your side if they say there is no private right of\naction?\nMR. DUBBS: Well, they didn't say there was\nno private right of action. What they said was there\nwas no private right of action in this case because of\ntheir application of the intervening clause test, which\nwe submit was error and clear error in light of the\nfactors that have to go into the intervening -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We are only talking about\nthis case. I mean -\nMR. DUBBS: Sorry?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We are only talking about\nthis case, right? If we send it back, we send it back\nto have this case decided and they'd come out against\nyou in this case.\nMR. DUBBS: They -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So what could -- and that\nis going to change the Second Circuit's view of things,\nthe fact that, in addition to their initial opinion, it\nhas been reconfirmed, although on different grounds,\nby -- by the government?\nMR. DUBBS: Your Honor -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There is no reason to send\nit back.\nMR. DUBBS: Well, Your Honor, it's -- it's\nup to the Court. I mean, it's your -- you're basically\neducating -- making an educated guess as to whether the\nSecond Circuit would pay attention to the SEC. In the\npast, they have. They may not now.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dubbs, you said\nsomething that I thought quite revealing in this -- in\nyour brief. I mean, this case is Australian plaintiff,\nAustralian defendant, shares purchased in Australia. It\nhas \"Australia\" written all over it. And in your reply\nbrief you said: \"If the Plaintiff is a foreign\nsecurities purchaser as this one is, Sinochem makes it\nclear that forum non conveniens may dictate dismissal of\nan action brought in the U.S.\"\nAnd taking that, why not -- of the\napplicable laws to this transaction, to this alleged\nfraud, isn't the most appropriate choice the law of\nAustralia rather than the law of the United States?\nMR. DUBBS: No -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Not just a question of\nproper forum, but the proper law?\nMR. DUBBS: No, Your Honor. We think that,\ngiven the scope of section 10(b), American law can and\nshould be applied here. And we respectfully disagree\nwith the observation that this case has \"Australia\"\nwritten all over it. Indeed, from our point of view it\nhas \"Florida\" written all over it because Florida is\nwhere the numbers were doctored, Florida is where the\nfraudulent conduct in putting the phony assumptions into\nthe valuation portfolio were done. Everything\nhappened -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If all that were done and\nit were never communicated, there wouldn't be any\nviolation.\nMR. DUBBS: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the communication was\ndone in Australia by the Australian bank.\nMR. DUBBS: The communication was done\nbetween Florida and -- and Australia, and the senior\nmanagement of HomeSide in Florida created those numbers\nwith the expectation and the knowledge that those would\ngo into the financial statement. So that means there is\nsubstantial conduct in Florida in terms of the fraud.\nThey made the misrepresentation pursuant to what \"make\"\nmeans, pursuant to the 1934 dictionary.\nThey engaged in hard-core fraudulent conduct\nby doctoring the books, by putting the phony assumptions\ninto the computer model. Without that there wouldn't\nhave been a phony number. In one sense it's a one-issue\ncase, or a one-number case, which is the mortgage\nservicing rights number that appears on -- on the\nbalance sheet at page 11 -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Let's -- let's go back to\nthe question that I asked you about the appropriate\nforum. You -- you seem to give this very case -- the\nplaintiff is a foreign securities purchaser. When the\nplaintiff's choice is not -- is not its home forum, the\npresumption in the plaintiff's favor applies with less\nforce, et cetera. But you have an Australian plaintiff\nsuing in the United States based on shares purchased in\nAustralia and the lead defendant is the Australian bank.\nSo what -- what did you mean when you were\nreferring to Sinochem and forum non conveniens?\nMR. DUBBS: We meant two things, Your Honor.\nThe first thing we meant was that, in addition to the\nother tests that are proposed, putting Sinochem at the\nbeginning of the train would sort out some of these\nquestions in general. That's in general.\nAs to our particular case, we believe we\nwould win a forum non conveniens argument, though one\nwas never made and that was not explored by any district\njudge. And we would win that because the statute\nspecifically provides in section 10(b) that fraud can be\ncaused in any number of ways -- three ways, including\nthrough the mails, through foreign or interstate\ncommerce, or over an exchange. And that fraud was\ncaused in Florida and the mails were used and it was in\nforeign or interstate commerce.\nAnd the people who committed the fraud on a\nnuts-and-bolts level are the senior management who are\ndefendants from HomeSide bank in Florida, so to that\nextent it is a Florida case. And we also think that any\ndistrict judge in looking at a forum non motion would\nalso look at the various interests of National Australia\nBank in HomeSide in the United States to judge the\noverall fairness of letting the suit proceed against\nthem and to counter the issue that this is really all\nabout Australia.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, wouldn't your clients\nhave an adequate remedy under Australian law in\nAustralia, in the Australian court system?\nMR. DUBBS: We might or we might not. But\nthat is not determinative.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, let's assume that -\nthat they do not. Let's assume that on the facts of\nthis case they could not prevail under Australian law in\nthe Australian court system. Then what United States\ninterest is there -\nMR. DUBBS: There -\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- that should override\nthat?\nMR. DUBBS: There is a strong United States\ninterest. It's on two levels. The first strong United\nStates -- United States interest deals with the conduct\nat issue here, namely the conduct in Florida by\nHomeSide. This was the sixth largest mortgage service\nprovider in the United States.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If we had only HomeSide's\nconduct, nothing else, there wouldn't be any violation\nof 10(b); is that right?\nMR. DUBBS: We do not agree with that, Your\nHonor. We believe that they made a representation by\ncreating the false numbers, or otherwise it's within the\nscope of the statute. What they did is create a\ndeceptive device -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But nothing has happened.\nSuppose it had been caught by the Australian bank, and\nthey didn't act on it?\nMR. DUBBS: Your -- Your Honor, that goes to\na different element of the cause of action. That\ndoesn't go to the scope of the statute. That goes to\nhow the private cause of action is enforced.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, I concede your\nargument that a big component of this fraud was what\nwent on in Florida, but it needed to be disclosed to the\npublic. It needed to be put out there. And that wasn't\ndone in Florida by the Florida defendants.\nMR. DUBBS: It was done in Australia and we\ncan prove that. And -- the point is we are not -- all\nwe are proving through doing that is the effects of the\nfraud in Florida. To use Professor Beale's example,\nwhere you have poison candy in one jurisdiction, that\npoison candy is sent to another jurisdiction, and in the\nfirst jurisdiction there is a law that says \"thou shalt\nnot make poison candy;\" through the exercise of\nlegislative jurisdiction that statute in the first\njurisdiction is appropriate, and both jurisdictions have\nan interest in that.\nNow, if we are in the poison candy\njurisdiction and we are bringing a case about poison\ncandy, if the statute in addition says, \"you have to\nshow some harm from the poison candy,\" indeed you might\nas a matter of proof have to show effects from that\nother forum. But that's different than regulating\nconduct in the second forum or anything else in the\nsecond forum. That is simply looking at the statute or\nthe legal prescription against making poison candy. And\nwe say section 10(b) is like the poison candy statute.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Which of your standards -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, that's -- I would like\nyou to follow that up specifically. That is, in my mind\nthe difficult issue in this case is not the\njurisdictional issue under principles of international\nlaw. It's the question of the scope of the statute.\nAnd there the things against you are three. One is\nProfessor Sachs's argument, which I would like to know\nyour answer to. The second is in Judge Friendly's two\nopinions.\nThe first opinion -- the second one, rather,\nBersch, he says if you had a foreign exchange and\nforeign plaintiffs as -- and there was no foreign\nplaintiff, the security issued over a foreign exchange,\neven if that fraud takes place totally in the United\nStates, the statute wouldn't cover it. That's Friendly,\nwhich started this.\nAnd the third thing is what he says in\nLeasco. He says: We cannot see any sound reason for\nnot taking your position, at least for the plaintiffs\nwho are Americans. Okay?\nNow, France, Britain and Australia have\nfiled briefs in this case giving what they consider very\nsound reasons, which are reasons that Judge Friendly\nnever considered. And those three reasons, as we know,\nis they point to a number of conflicts, that if you win,\nhow that will interfere with their efforts to regulate\ntheir own securities markets, right?\nThat's all one question: Professor Sachs,\nFriendly in Bersch, and Friendly in Leasco. But that's\nwhat I'd like to hear your answer to.\nMR. DUBBS: I will try to keep the subparts\nin mind. Why don't we start from the end and try to\nwork backwards. Perhaps one of the most important parts\nof the record is the Solicitor General's view that as a\ngeneral matter -- and I will get to the specifics; I'm\nnot ducking that. But as a general matter the\nenforcement of the securities laws, unlike the antitrust\nlaws, has not historically and today they do not believe\nruns -- raises a substantial risk of interstate\nconflict.\nNow, as to the specific briefs that Your\nHonor referenced, if we look at those briefs and we look\nat those compared to what happened in Hartford Fire,\nthose briefs -- and let's focus on Australia's for the\nmoment because that's the country we are talking about.\nAustralia's brief essentially says they have a\nregulatory system that may -- that we may or may not\nhave been able to litigate this cause of action in\nAustralia, but let's assume that we could.\nThey are not saying -- they did not say in\nthat brief that there was some fundamental conflict,\nlike the plurality found in Hartford Fire; nor did they\nsay that there was the kind of conflict that comes up in\nthe application of 403(h) of the Restatement, which\nJustice Scalia looked to in his opinion in Hartford\nFire. So there is not the kind of conflict that leads\nnecessarily -- necessarily -- to not reasonably applying\nthe statute.\nThe reason there's not is that because, one,\nthere is not a rule in Australia that one has to abide\nby and a rule in the United States that one has to abide\nby that are contradictory. At most, what you have is\nyou have a clear rule in the United States that says\nthou shalt not commit fraud in Florida through either\nthe Florida through either -- for or in interstate\ncommerce, the mails or through an exchange. And on the\nother side of the equation what you have is maybe they\ncould have brought suit over here and we have a robust\nregulatory system and a robust litigation system; more\npower to them.\nBut that doesn't mean -- saying that, that\ndoesn't mean that the first State where the poison candy\nwas made suddenly has no interest in that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but -- but Australia\nsays: Look, it's up to us to decide whether there has\nbeen a misrepresentation, point one; and whether it's\nbeen relied upon by the -- by the plaintiffs, point two.\nAnd we should be able to decide that and we don't want\nit decided by a foreign court.\nYou are talking about a misrepresentation,\nif there was one in this case, made in Australia to\nAustralian purchasers; it ought to be up to us to decide\nthat issue; and here you are dragging the American\ncourts into it.\nMR. DUBBS: Well, let me deal with the\ndragging in part in a minute, because that's\nsubliminally very important to the case.\nBut let me address the direct question. He\nAustralians may believe that, but the question is was\nthere a misrepresentation both in the United States and\npossibly in Australia? If there was in Australia,\nthat's for the Australians. That's dealing with the\neffects of eating the poison candy. But we say a\nmisrepresentation was made in the United States -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not to these plaintiffs.\nMR. DUBBS: Sir -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you have to join the\nmisrepresentation to the plaintiff.\nMR. DUBBS: We have joined -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The only misrepresentation\nto these plaintiffs was made in Australia by an\nAustralian company.\nMR. DUBBS: There are two ways to connect\nthe fraud to the plaintiffs. The one is the \"in\nconnection with\" requirement that deals with conduct,\nwhich we meet, and this Court has construed very broadly\nin Dabit, in Zandford and any other number of cases.\nThat's number one.\nNumber two, assuming that the scope of the\nstatute is broad enough to cover the conduct in Florida,\nwe then get to the second question, which is the\nreasonableness of the application of the statute, and\nwithout a conflict, we would then look at -- to the\ninterest of the United States and compare them to the\nAustralians. And the Australians can say, we can -- you\nknow, we can go after eating that poison candy. And we\nsay, fine, if you want to, that's great. But that\ndoesn't mean we can't go after the act of poisoning the\ncandy in Florida.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that -- that isn't the\nissue. The -- the -- the issue for the Australians is:\nWe want to determine whether there has been a\nmisrepresentation or not.\nMR. DUBBS: They -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We don't want the\ndetermination of whether there has been a\nmisrepresentation on the Australian exchange and whether\nAustralian purchasers relied upon that misrepresentation\nto be determined by an American court.\nMR. DUBBS: And we say more power to you,\nyou can decide that question. The question -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Not if it's decided here,\nunless you want to say, the Australian court to say, the\nUnited States taking this case is so outrageous that we\nwill not respect its judgment. And that's a factor,\ntoo. It's -- what conflict of laws is all about is you\nhave two jurisdictions, both with an interest in\napplying their own law, but sometimes one defers to the\nother.\nMR. DUBBS: That's correct, Your Honor. And\nthe question is should there be deferral in this case.\nAnd we say if you apply the standards of -- of Hartford\nFire or the standards of the Restatement, you don't end\nup in deferral. You end up in prosecution of the\nSection 10(b) cause of action in Florida. And you do\nthat for a couple of different reasons.\nFirst, you look at the magnitude of the\nconduct in Florida, the size of this. This is a\n$1.75 billion writedown in a portfolio. You have a\nportfolio of $187 billion worth of mortgages sitting\ndown in Jacksonville, Florida. Those are all mortgages\non American homes, 2 million American homes. So, this\nis not just Australia, Australia, Australia. That's\nwhat's in the portfolio and that's what's being\nmisrepresented. And when they doctor the numbers and\nsend them to Australia, it's a misrepresentation of\nthat.\nIn addition, you have the overarching\nconsideration of is it appropriate to sue National\nAustralia Bank in the United States at -- at a -- at a\nmore abstract level? And the answer to that, we submit,\nis yes. They have invested -- if you care to look, it's\non the SA-11 and SA-41 of the supplemental appendix,\nthey have invest -- they have $25 billion worth of\nassets here. They own a bank in Michigan, they have a\nhuge trading operation on Park Avenue that trades\nbillions of dollars in derivatives every day. This is\nnot the situation -- this is not the stereotype of a\ngotcha where you have -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Those derivatives\nare not at issue here, right?\nMR. DUBBS: Well, they are only -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I presume -- I'm\nsorry, go ahead.\nMR. DUBBS: They are only at issue in the\nfollowing sense, which is that the position on the\nmortgage servicing rights was hedged in New York. When\nthe hedge came undone, there were losses in New York on\nthe other side of the hedge. That goes to the point of\nwere there any affects in the United States, because\nthere seems to be some confusion on that. There were\nsome effects here from the hedge. There were some\neffects on -- in the ADR market, but we are not -- we\nare not -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought Morrison -\nMR. DUBBS: -- disputing that most of the\neffects were over there.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dubbs, Morrison, the\nfirst-named plaintiff, was a derivative holder.\nMR. DUBBS: No, Your Honor. He was the\nholder of an ADR. The derivatives come in because they\nare the activity in New York that is the other side of\nthe transaction. HomeSide -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But do you have -- you\nhave two classes of plaintiffs, one the Australians, who\nbought their shares in Australia; then you have\nMorrison, who has an ADR, and who is dismissed because\nhe wasn't able to show damages.\nMR. DUBBS: That's true. There -- there are\nno Americans left. This is strictly Australians.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So what U.S. investor was\nharmed?\nMR. DUBBS: The -- the question is, were\nthere effects on the U.S. market? There were U.S.\ninvestors who were, in all likelihood, harmed but none\nhave stepped forward with respect to ADR holders. But\nif the question in the abstract is were there economic\neffects from this transaction in the United States, the\nanswer is -- is yes, there were fallout from -- on -- on\nthe derivative side, which is the other side -- which\nwas the other side, in effect, the short side of what\nthe long position was, which was $187 billion worth of\nmortgages in Florida that what is -- what the portfolio\nconsisted of.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What do you -- do you want\nto finish?\nMR. DUBBS: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then -- I mean, I can see.\nI will give you all that. That isn't what is bothering\nme. I think you are right so far as what you have\nargued. But the part that I think is most difficult is\nwhy I -- I shorthand referred to Professor Sachs'\narticle.\nMR. DUBBS: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because what Australia is\nactually saying is what we don't like about -- about the\nAmerican system, you know, their -- their common\ncriticisms of class actions. We say, first of all, the\nAmerican rule means even if our companies here are\nright, that they are going to have to pay their legal\nfees. We don't like punitive damages. We don't like\nthat we have the opt-out. And these are all our\ncitizens, and we don't want to subject our companies on\nour exchange to that stuff.\nNow, fine, they have a reason on their side.\nThen Professor Sachs says: Read the statute, because\nthey argue -- it was never intended to cover that kind\nof stuff. Now, that's what I would like you to address\nspecifically.\nMR. DUBBS: Well, it was -- there are two\nissues. The statute was intended to cover that kind of\nstuff if the antecedent of \"stuff\" is fraud in Florida.\nNow, that's a separate question from how we deal with\nthe private right of action in these circumstances.\nNow, let's back up. The general criticism\nof these cases is that they are gotcha cases. You put\nin a little bit and all of a sudden the private bar\ncomes and attacks you. I mean, that's the stereotype.\nWell, the stereotype is wrong and it's important to\nunderstand why the stereotype is wrong. Because if all\nyou have is a very modest investment in the ADR market,\n1 percent like my friends from NAB, those cases get\nbounced at the beginning on personal jurisdiction as\nthey did in the district of New Jersey in SCORS and the\nNovagold case. We are not aware of any case where if\nall you've got is that little toehold that you stay in.\nYou get bounced by -- on personal jurisdiction.\nAnd to pick up on the discussion that I was\nhaving with Justice Ginsburg, we thought that in\naddition to that, if the Court wanted to send signals\nwith respect to these kinds of cases, if you put, as you\ncan, Sinochem at the beginning of the train, even more\nof these cases if they are fallacious are going to be\nscreened out of the system.\nSo, the point is that we can all tell our\nAustralian friends that there are very rigid safeguards\nin place so that this horror story in reality doesn't\nhappen and it has not been proven to happen. It is an\nattractive myth, but it hasn't happened. Those cases go\nout and they go out early.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure that it\nhappens in advance of considerable discovery. I -- I --\nI would agree that the judge can confine discovery to\nforum non conveniens or for personal jurisdiction, but\nin -- in these cases one of the things we are really\ntalking about is the burden of discovery. That's the\ncost of litigation. You know that.\nMR. DUBBS: I do know that and let me answer\nbriefly, because I want to reserve my time for rebuttal.\nI disagree with your fundamental observation, Justice\nKennedy. These cases are paid attention to by the\ndistrict judges and they go out early. They go out\nearly on personal jurisdiction; there is not a lot of\ndiscovery on that. They go out early -- if Sinochem\ngets applied faithfully, it would go out early on that\nif there is a close question. And then you go to the\n12(b)(6).\nAnd pursuant to the Private Securities\nLitigation Reform Act, one of the purposes of that is no\ndiscovery, no discovery until after the motion to\ndismiss is decided.\nSo it is not true that there is a lot of\ndiscovery, there is a lot of transaction costs, before\nwe know the answer to one of the threshold questions,\nwhich is: Should this case be in our system or not?\nThat can be handled and it is being handled on a daily\nbasis, notwithstanding, you know, some stereotypes.\nNow, my final point with respect to\nProfessor Sachs' articles and some of the other articles\nis they in effect -- if they advocate a rule, which many\nof them do, which it should be limited to exchanges,\nthat goes back to my threshold point of the scope of the\nstatute. And it takes an eraser to the statute and it\nsays: It's only exchanges; it's not in connection with\nforeign or interstate commerce or through the mails;\nit's limited, contrary to the express words of the\nstatute, in a way that the statutory construction we\ndon't believe can stand it.\nNow, there are other legitimate ways of\ncabining the private cause of action. But that -- if\nyou are faithful to the statute, we submit that is not\none of them.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Dubbs.\nMr. Conway.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE T. CONWAY, III,\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. CONWAY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe judgment of the court of appeals should\nbe affirmed for two reasons.\nFirst, Petitioners have identified nothing\nin the text of section 10(b) that overcomes the\npresumption against extraterritoriality or the Charming\nBetsy Rule. The statutes should thus be construed not\nto apply to transactions and shares of foreign issuers\non foreign exchanges.\nSecond, unlike the rights of action that\nthis Court has addressed in other extraterritoriality\ncases, the section 10(b) right is purely implied.\nCongress didn't intend for this right of action to exist\neven domestically, let alone extraterritorially.\nGiven the threat that the section 10(b}\nimplied right presents to the sovereign authority of\nother nations, as reflected in the amicus briefs of\nAustralia, the United Kingdom, France, and the\ndiplomatic note from the Swiss government, the Court\nshould construe the implied right not to extend to\nclaims of purchasers and sellers of securities of\nforeign issuers on foreign markets.\nThe two clear statement rules are,\nobviously, the presumption against extraterritoriality\nand the Charming Betsy Rule require that the Congress.\nBoth require an affirmative intention of the Congress\nclearly expressed before the statute can be applied to\napply to foreign transactions or to, you know, matters\nthat it infringes on the sovereign authority on other\nnations.\nMy friends don't identify anything in the\nstatute that comets even close to a clear statement.\nThey principally rely on the definition of \"interstate\ncommerce,\" but as this court said in Aramco, that kind\nof boilerplate simply doesn't suffice to overcome the\npresumption against extraterritoriality.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what is your test for\nwhether -- whether it's being applied internationally or\nnot?\nMR. CONWAY: Well, our test is that, at a\nminimum, section 10b should be held not to apply to\ntransactions involving shares of foreign issues on\nforeign exchanges, because that presents the greatest\ndanger of conflict of foreign law, particularly in the\ncontext of the modern section 10b implied right, which\nhas the fraud on the market presumption and holds\nissuers liable, as here for example, for two and a half\nyears of trading, all on an Australian exchange. That\nis massive transfer of wealth that the Petitioners here\nare seeking an American court to effect, and that is -\nbasically, it's a direct form of market regulation that\nAustralia has not seen fit to impose upon itself.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you on that\npoint: Supposing the class of plaintiffs included a\ngroup of Americans who were shareholders of the\nAustralian bank and who -- but who purchased their stock\nover the Australian exchange.\nMR. CONWAY: We would -- well, we would\nsubmit that that rule should be the same. That they\nshould -- they should not also, they should not be\nallowed to sue under section 10b. They -- they -- you\nknow, those people chose to purchase on the Australian\nexchange. And in terms of the threat to international\ncomity, I think it would be probably take -- I don't\nthink other countries would take nicely to a -- to a\nrule of law that would allow Americans, essentially, to\nbring their rules, their law, their remedies, fraud, on\nthe market, what have you to foreign countries -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Give me reasons for it.\nThe strongest one for it, the strongest example against\nyou it seems to me, is Judge Friendly's example.\nSchmidt, a citizen of Germany, flies to New York and\nmeets Jones in the hotel. And Jones says, I have a\nbridge I want to sell you. Look out the window. Say,\nDo you own the Brooklyn Bridge? Yes. And that's a lie.\nHere's what you do. You invest in buying\nshares of my company sold on the German exchange. Okay?\nMR. CONWAY: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Conduct took place in the\nUnited States, a terrible fraud. This is contrary to\nfraud and, says, I think, Judge Friendly and others, it\nshould apply at least where Schmidt is an American\ncitizen and Professor Sachs says no, not even then.\nWhat do you do with that case? The fraud\ntook place totally here.\nMR. CONWAY: Well, I disagree with that,\nYour Honor, I think the fraud is carried out when the\ntransaction occurs in a foreign country. But I do agree\nthat Professor Sachs is absolutely right -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Sign the paper here in New\nYork.\nMR. CONWAY: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Sign the paper, right here,\nand give me the money, because I have an urgent\nappointment.\nMR. CONWAY: Yes, sir.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. CONWAY: That's a much different case,\nobviously, than the fraud in the market case that we\nhave here. But Your Honor, yes, that is a stronger\ncircumstance.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but your position and\nhers is: That's no more a valid claim than this one or\nany other one we dream up. That's why it's a pure\nexample, and I want to know how you feel about it.\nAnd -\nMR. CONWAY: Well, I think that -- I think\nthe problem is, in order to have that conduct swept\nwithin the statute, you have to ignore the language and\nthe presumption against extraterritoriality.\nIf you go to petition appendix 78, that has\nits text in section 10b, and section 10b refers to the\nuse or employment of any manipulative device or\ncontrivance, and it's in connection with the purchase or\nsale of any security registered on a national securities\nexchange. And that's -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Or any other. Or -- read\nthe next word.\nMR. CONWAY: That's correct. Any security\nnot so registered. And this Court has held -- it has\nheld in cases like Aramco, American Banana, Moritson,\nthat the words \"any\" and \"every,\" words of universal\nscope, do not -- do not mean that these -- that\nsomething referred to is anything, anywhere else in the\nworld. And for example, the Court is small against the\nUnited States. In the case where the presumption of\nextraterritoriality didn't really apply the court held\nthat in a statute, you normally assume that things being\nreferred to are thing in the United States. Now -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the government going to\ntell us that its test, which differs from the foreign\nexchange test, is based on considerations like those\nsuggested in Justice Breyer's Brooklyn Bridge\nhypothetical?\nMR. CONWAY: I think they do. I think they\nlook to -- I think their view is that the statute is\nvague and you have to do essentially what Judge Friendly\ndid and the Seventh Circuit did for many years, is you\nhave to make do and decide what the best rule is. And\nwith respect to the government, that is essentially\ndoing what this Court has said under the presumption\nagainst extraterritoriality the Court shouldn't do.\nThat's essentially legislating, trying to figure out\nwhat Congress would have done, had \"a particular\nproblem\" -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would the limitations on\ndiscovery give you substantial protection were we to\nadopt the government's test or say the foreign exchange\ntest with the subset exceptions for the -- that takes\naccount of the government's test?\nMR. CONWAY: Your Honor, I think the problem\nwith the government's test and with the Second Circuit's\ntest, is that it would still allow the application of\nU.S. law in a manner that would infringe the sovereign\nauthority of other nations.\nAnd I can give an example. There was a case\nover the summer that the Petitioners attached to their\nfirst supplemental brief on the petition for certiorari.\nAnd it's a case called PC shifts. And it's an\ninteresting case because it involved a Canadian company\nwith headquarters in Britain and most of whose shares\ntraded on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\nAnd what happened there was that the\nCEO spent time in Florida -- it was a shipping company.\nWe spent time in, Miami running the show from Miami.\nAnd the court of appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, in a\nruling that it held was consistent with the Second\nCircuit decision in this case held that nonetheless, the\napplication of U.S. law could be applied to transactions\nof -- of foreign plaintiffs on the Toronto Stock\nExchange.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it a consideration that\nthis discovery alone would be an offense to foreign -\nMR. CONWAY: Yes, discovery alone. Yes,\nYour Honor. Discovery alone. I think the French brief,\nfor example, points that out. I think a number of the\nbrief -- there have been blocking statutes that have\nbeen enacted by various countries because of the -- what\nthey deem to be the offensive scope of discovery. In\nFrance, you are really only allowed to obtain evidence\nthat is actually admissible in trial.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure how you\ninterpret the language that you -- that you just read,\nwhen you say to use or employ in connection with the\npurchase or sale of any security registered on the\nNational Security Exchange or any security not so\nregistered.\nNow, is it your point that in order to avoid\nan international extension of it, it should apply only\nto securities? What?\nMR. CONWAY: It should only be applied -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Securities purchased and\nsold in the United States? Is that it?\nMR. CONWAY: That -- that's correct, Your\nHonor. I think that's a fair reading of the statute.\nAnd this Court is required, under both the presumption\nagainst extraterritoriality under its decision and the\nCharming Betsy Rule to interpret a statute, take the\npermissible construction of the statute that is least\nlikely to result in an extraterritorial of the law.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Purchased -- purchased or\nsold?\nMR. CONWAY: Purposed or sold, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if it's not -- what if\nit -- what if the fraud produces neither a purchase or a\nsale but induces somebody to hold on to stock that\notherwise the person would dispose of?\nMR. CONWAY: Well, I -- I don't know that\nthat would state a claim, a private claim under Blue\nChip Stamps. And any -- and if the share or the\nsecurities are held abroad, if it's a foreign security,\nand I think the liability in that hypothetical -- I'm\nassuming that if it's a foreign security held by a\nforeigner -- that really would be something that would\nbe subject to foreign law, whether or not Australia\nwants to represent -- recognize holder claims of the\nsort that this Court rejected in Blue Chip Stamps.\nThat's a question for Australia to decide.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under these same\nfacts if you had -- altering according to the\nhypothetical, you had U.S. plaintiffs who purchased\nNational Australia Bank ADRs on the New York exchange,\nyou don't doubt that they can sue, do you?\nMR. CONWAY: No, and in fact, we told the\ndistrict court, we did not move to defense on\nextraterritoriality grounds the claims of Mr. Morrison,\nwho inexplicably is still here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMR. CONWAY: We argued that Mr. Morrison's\nclaims should be defeated on the grounds that he had no\ndamages, which was an absolutely ironclad calculation\nbest based on a -- on a provision of the PSLRA, and we\nalso argued that all of the claims should be dismissed\nfor failure to plead fraud with the requisite\nparticularity of the PSLRA.\nBut we certainly do not dispute that when a\ncompany like ours registers shares on -- registers\nshares with the SEC, ADRs with its SEC and lists them on\na New York stock exchange, it's subjecting itself to New\nYork -- I mean, U.S. law for purposes of those -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And presumably that\nwould impose the same discovery on the bank as the\nSudanese case.\nMR. CONWAY: It could, Your Honor, that's\nabsolutely true. But on the other hand, I mean, a lot\nof the other aspects of -- of this litigation, which\nthis Court has, you know, noted that is potentially\nhighly vexatious, I mean, that is only 1.1 percent of\nthe flow -- of the total equity securities of the -- the\nNational Australia Bank. So the dangers of -- of a\nthreat of -- of coerced settlements is much, much less.\nIt's a much, much easier case to deal with\nif -- if -- if you are only dealing with the ADRs. Now\nif another company decides to list half its equity on\nthe New York Stock Exchange, well, it can -- it makes\nthe determination for itself, how much of this kind of\nlitigation it wants to subject itself to.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose there were\nlitigation with substantial allegations of wire fraud\nviolations as predicate for RICO violations, and the\ncase begins to proceed, and then there is a second cause\nof action under the securities law. Would -- would the\nfact that there is going to be discovery and substantial\nlitigation in the -- in the United States courts be a\nfactor in retaining the -- the securities violation in\nthis suit? Or would the test be just the same in your\nview?\nMR. CONWAY: I think the -- I think you have\nto take each statute separately. You have to look at\nwhat the language of the statute says, whether it -- it\nadmits fault in an extraterritorial reading, and whether\nthat -- frankly whether that extraterritorial reading is\nrequired or compelled. If there is any other possible\nconstruction, as the Court said in -- in Charming Betsy,\nthe court is required to accept that construction,\naccept the construction that doesn't result in\nextraterritorial application or doesn't result in -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: On the -- on the\nextraterritorial presumption against it, your colleague\non the other side tells us that in all the cases where\nthe presumption applied, all of the conduct was\nsomeplace else, and they give the Aramco case and say\nthat was an employee hired in -- was it Saudi Arabia -\nMR. CONWAY: That -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and everything\nhappened outside the country.\nMR. CONWAY: Well, my -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Here, I mean, you have to\nconcede that a component of the alleged fraud occurred\nin Florida.\nMR. CONWAY: We do concede that some of the\nconduct that ultimately, you know, led -- in a but-for\ncausal relationship to what happened in the Australia\noccurred in the United States, but that's true in a lot\nof other cases. For example, Aramco, Mr. Boureslan was\nhired in Houston. So was the cook in Foley Brothers v.\nFilardo. And in Microsoft v. AT&T, basically all of the\nconduct, the relevant conduct was in the United States,\nbecause what the -- what section 271(f) proscribed in\nMicrosoft was the shipment -- the supply in or from the\nUnited States of a component of a patented invention.\nAnd what this Court held in Microsoft was\nthat notwithstanding AT&T's argument that, \"Hey, the\npresumption against extraterritoriality doesn't really\napply because this is just regulating the supply in and\nfrom the United States,\" this Court held that the\npresumption against extraterritoriality applied because\nwhat would happen is, a single act of supply would\nresult in a springboard for liability each time a -- a\ndisk was put into a computer abroad.\nAnd that is exactly analogous to the\ncircumstances in this case, where what we -- what\nhappened was some -- some allegedly false information\nwas transmitted to Australia; it was then republished in\nannual reports, print, print, print; sent out to the -\nsent out to the Australian market, and resulted in -\nallegedly, as they would have it -- resulted in\nliability every single time somebody purchased -\npurchased a share of stock of the National Australia\nBank on the Australian securities exchange. And so that\nis exactly analogous to -- to Microsoft v. AT&T.\nAgain, another point I think that's relevant\nis the, section 30 of the Exchange Act. Congress did\nnot make a clear statement in section 10. It did make\nclear statements in section 30. Section 30(a) addresses\ntransactions on foreign exchanges. Section 30 as a\nwhole is entitled Foreign Exchanges, and section 30(a)\nmakes it -- makes -- gives the SEC power to promulgate\nregulations that -- that apply to brokers and dealers\nwho effect transactions of securities on foreign\nexchanges, if those transactions are transactions of\nshares of shares of U.S. issuers.\nAnd that's at -- for reference, the text of\nsection 30 is at page 19 of the law professors' brief.\nAnd section 30(b) also, it says that the SEC can\nregulate the -- regulate businesses in securities of -\nof businesses -- securities that are abroad, but only to\nthe extent the SEC finds it necessary to prevent evasion\nof the Act domestically.\nAnd so Congress made two clear statements in\nsection 30. It did not make any clear statement in\nsection 10.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, is that your only\npoint? Or is your point also that you wouldn't need\nsection 30 if -- if 10(b) were -\nMR. CONWAY: That's -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- were read as broadly.\nMR. CONWAY: That's absolutely right. The\nreading -- my friend's reading of section 30 would\nrender section 10(b) -- I mean the reading of section\n10(b) would render section 30 superfluous. And there\nare other provisions of -- that are in the Exchange Act\nwhere Congress has made clear statements to show that it\ncan make clear statements. Section 30A which\nimmediately follows section 30, is the Foreign Corrupt\nPractices Act.\nSo Congress -- if Congress -- if there is a\nloophole, and that's what this Court said in Microsoft\nv. AT&T; if there is some kind of loophole that presents\nsome kind of a problem, that Congress needs to fix,\nCongress can do it. Congress can do it with a clear\nstatement.\nIn sum, Your Honors, countries -- nations of\nthe world do things differently. They -- they -- they\nhave different rules of liability. We see in the amicus\nbriefs different rules of materiality, different rules\nof disclosure. And some rely on -- on public\nenforcement more than others.\nThe French rely on l'action publique, as\nthey say; and some nations approach ours in their\ngenerosity to plaintiffs. Australia allows opt-out\nclass actions; so does Canada. Canada allows opt-out\nclass actions; it dispenses with, for example, the proof\nof reliance, it dispenses with scienter in some cases.\nYet it -- it does all that, but it restricts liability\nto $1 million or 5 percent of a -- of a company's -\nJUSTICE BREYER: How does it hurt the other\ncountries if what we would say on their reading of this\nis, Congress has said, \"Look, if some terribly bad\nconduct happens in the United States; they lie through\ntheir teeth; and you, whoever you are in the world, who\nbuys some shares and as a result you are hurt, we will\ngive you a remedy. Come to us\" -- now, how does that\nhurt Australia?\nMR. CONWAY: Well, it hurts Australia -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Or France or England or any\nof these others?\nMR. CONWAY: Exactly the same way this Court\nsaid it hurts in Empagran. In Empagran this Court noted\nthat -- that a reading of the rule that would allow -- a\nreading of the FTAIA that would have allowed foreign\nplaintiffs to come and sue for -- for foreign vitamins\ntransaction in a foreign country would essentially allow\nplaintiffs to avoid the -- the narrower rules of the\nliability and the narrower remedies that other nations\nprovide. And that is exactly true here, where, you\nknow, for example, Australia does not permit\nfraud-on-the-market class actions. It doesn't allow -\nit doesn't recognize the fraud-on-the-market\npresumption.\nAnd as I said, for example, Canada restricts\nthese actions, it has generous liability rules and\nallows opt-out class actions, but it says -- it caps\ndamages at 5 percent of an issuer's market\ncapitalization or $1 million, whichever is greater.\nAnd so that's the -- that is the problem.\nIt's not just substance but it's remedy. Other nations\nwant to do things in different ways; they should be\nallowed to. What is going on here is essentially a --\nBrandeising -- experiment a global scale. And that's a\ngood thing.\nIt's a good thing because it enables\ncountries to judge for themselves what kind of rules\nthey want to have for people who buy shares on their own\nexchanges. And to apply section 10(b) it cases like\nthis would cut that experiment short. It would amount\nto exactly the soft of legal imperialism that this Court\nrejected, rightly, in Empagran. The Court should reject\nit here as well and it should affirm the judgment of the\ncourt of appeals.\nI thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Conway.\nMr. Roberts.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS,\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. ROBERTS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case presents two distinct questions:\nFirst whether the fraud alleged by Petitioners violated\nSection 10b; and second, whether Petitioners may bring a\nprivate action.\nIn our view, the alleged fraud violated\nSection 10b, because significant conduct material to the\nfraud's success occurred in the United States.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There are -- there\nare a lot of moving parts in that test. You know,\nsignificant conduct, material, you require it to have a\ndirect causal relationship. Doesn't the complication of\nthat kind of defeat the whole purpose?\nMR. ROBERTS: No, Your Honor, we don't think\nso. In terms of the -- of the direct cause part, which\nit will be -- the significant limit on private actions,\nas this case illustrates, the district courts even\naccepting the allegations in the plaintiff's complaint\nwill often be able to dismiss the suit on the pleading\nfor its failure to satisfy that test. It's not a\ndifficult test -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's only for the\nprivate companies?\nMR. ROBERTS: That's right. And in terms of\nthe other test, again, I don't think it's that\ncomplicated. The -- the significance part of it is\nessentially trying to assess the amount of the conduct\nof -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what if -\nwhat if significant elements of the fraud occur in four\ndifferent countries?\nMR. ROBERTS: If -- if -- the critical\nquestion is whether there's significant conduct here\nthat's material to the broad success. And the reason\nfor that is if Section 10b didn't cover that kind of\nconduct, then that would risk allowing the United States\nto become a base for orchestrating securities frauds for\nexport. It would allow thing like masterminds in the\nUnited States engineering international boiler room\nschemes in which they direct agents in foreign countries\nto make fraudulent representations that victimize\ninvestors.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So it's not as easy to\napply this, you think? Now, on your theory, I guess\nSchmidt is in Germany and we have our Brooklyn Bridge.\nOkay, now wait. What happens is he calls Schmidt on the\ntelephone, Jones, and he says I own the Brooklyn Bridge.\nActual, right, direct? Under your test, correct?\nMR. ROBERTS: Schmidt is in Germany?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Schmidt is in Germany. He\ncalls him up.\nMR. ROBERTS: The defrauder is in Germany?\nJUSTICE BREYER: All -- everything -- you\nhave to assume he's going to buy the thing on the\nexchange in Germany but the fraud is in Brooklyn. He is\nlying about -- he doesn't really own the Brooklyn\nBridge. So he calls Schmidt. I am interested in -- he\ncalls Schmidt. Causation, that's what your last pages\nof your brief, focus on that. He calls him and he lies\nto him. Actual. In your theory -\nMR. ROBERTS: I'm sorry, Your Honor, can I\nask you if everybody is in Germany?\nJUSTICE BREYER: No.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: Go back to my Brooklyn\nBridge example. Everything is hatched in your boiler\nroom.\nMR. ROBERTS: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And they communicate the\nlie by calling Schmidt in Berlin on the telephone,\ndirectly.\nMR. ROBERTS: Okay.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Schmidt is the German.\nHe's in Germany.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ROBERTS: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm looking -\nMR. ROBERTS: The question is, is there\nsignificant conduct in the United States -\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm focusing on the\nlast pages of your brief. Where you turn this whole\nthing on the directness of the causation.\nMR. ROBERTS: That's right. And the SEC\nwould be able to take action if there is significant\nconduct in the United States -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm accepting that for the\nmoment. What's bothering me, taking off from what the\nChief Justice said, is the feasibility of your test.\nYour test, it seems to me on causation, would say that\nwhen you phone Schmidt and lie to him, he can sue. But\nwhen you phone your parent company, knowing that they\nwill put it in the prospectus and Schmidt will read it,\nyou can't sue.\nAnd then what occurs to me is suppose you\nphoned a reporter, or suppose you phoned your parent\ncompany and you knew they would tell a reporter. I'm\nfocusing on the practicality of your causation test.\nMR. ROBERTS: If the conduct is directed or\ncontrolled from the United States -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Correct.\nMR. ROBERTS: -- then it would -- then the\ndirect causation test would be -- would be met. The\ncritical question is, is the conduct in the United\nStates have a close enough -\nJUSTICE BREYER: You think that's the\nquestion here? You think the question is whether this\nreally took place in Florida? I didn't think that was\nthe question.\nMR. ROBERTS: In terms of a private\nplaintiff suing, in our view, the question is whether\nthe United States' conduct has a close enough connection\nto their -- to -- to their injury -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Let's skip -- skip my\nquestion because other people may ask.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If the plaintiffs in this\ncase had clearly alleged in their complaint that nobody\nin Australia reviewed the numbers that were sent from\nFlorida to any degree, they just directly copied them,\nsome low-level clerk directly copied them, would the\ndirect cause test be met?\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes, if the action was just\nministerial over overseas, it would -- it would be met.\nAgain, the critical question, in our view, under the\ndirect cause test is, was there culpable conduct in the\nUnited States that is directly responsible for the\nplaintiff's injury?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Roberts -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then you give no\nweight to the fact that it was on the Australian\nexchange?\nMR. ROBERTS: The -- the fact that the\ntransaction happens on the Australian exchange is not\ndispositive, because if -- if somebody in the United\nStates is directly -- is -- is executing the fraud -- if\nit turned on just a transaction on the Australian\nexchange, then a domestic investor could be injured by a\nfraud that is hatched entirely here that is executed\nentirely here, and he is tricked into executing a\ntransaction on an overseas exchange.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Roberts, because your\ntime is running out, there is a basic question here.\nYou are asking us to make a distinction between what the\nSEC can sue for and what a private party can sue for.\nCongress did that with respect to aiders and abettors.\nIs there any other instance in which we have\nmade a distinction, yes, the SEC has a claim but the\nprivate litigant doesn't?\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes, the -- the -- the private\nlitigants are -- have numerous elements that they have\nto show that the SEC doesn't have to show: Reliance,\nloss, loss causation. All of those go to the causal\nlink between the injury and -- and the fraud. And we\nthink that the direct injury requirement is an\nappropriate application of those more general causation\nrequirements in the context of transnational fraud.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I am frankly less concerned\nwith your -- your test for the private cause of action,\nthe direct cause test -- I -- I guess I could work with\nthat -- than I am with your test for -- for the\njurisdiction of the -- of the SEC, which is sort of a\ntotality of the circumstances test. It doesn't seem to\nme that's an appropriate test for a jurisdictional\nquestion. You don't want to spend time litigating the\ntotality of the circumstances.\nMR. ROBERTS: We don't think it's a -- a\njurisdictional question in the sense of the subject\nmatter jurisdiction, Your Honor. It's a -- a test about\nthe scope of the statutory coverage.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, okay.\nMR. ROBERTS: And it's true that bright line\nrules -- it's true that bright line rules are easier to\nadminister, but the -- there is a danger in bright line\nrules for fraud prohibitions because they can provide a\nroad map for evasion of the statute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have any\nindication that our friends around the world are\ncomfortable with your test?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, the briefs that have\nbeen filed by Australia and United Kingdom and France\nare limited to the private right of action. They base\ntheir -- what they want to do is to limit the private\nrights. And I think the United Kingdom brief\nspecifically says that -- it thinks that SEC action\ncould be appropriate here, and that's a reason why, if\nthe Court adopts the -- a limit on the private actions,\nthat it need not -- it need not be concerned about the\npossibility that -- that fraud would be launched in the\nUnited States or directed in the United States and it\ncouldn't be addressed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I guess we don't have to\nsay anything about -- about what the government can do,\ndo we?\nMR. ROBERTS: No, Your Honor. And we would\ncertainly prefer that you decided the case solely on the\nprivate right of action if the alternative for a holding\nsubstantive prohibitions didn't apply here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Roberts, you\nurge deference to the SEC's interpretation in\nadministrative adjudications?\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have anything\nother than those two proceedings over the last 35 years?\nMR. ROBERTS: Those are the two\nadministrative adjudications. The SEC's administrative\nadjudicatory authority is limited to people involved in\nthe securities industry, and a lot of these frauds that\nhappen are -- don't involve people that are registered\nbroker/dealers and the like. There are numerous Civil\nActions that the SEC has brought where it has taken the\nsame approach. The SEC v. Berger case that we cite in\nour brief is one of them.\nI can name some others. There is\nSEC v. Wolfson, which is a case that's in the district\ncourt in Utah, and SEC v. Shay in -- in the southern\ndistrict of New York. SEC v. Banger in the northern\ndistrict of Illinois. Those involve international\nboiler-room schemes of the kind I was alluding to\nbefore, where masterminds in the United States basically\ndirect agents that they have got in countries like\nThailand or Spain to -- to make false statements and\nengage in high-pressure selling to target investors in\nother countries. Sometimes they induce them to engage\nin transactions in still other countries. So -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Roberts.\nMr. Dubbs, you have three minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS A. DUBBS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. DUBBS: Thank you, Your Honor. Let me\nbegin with Justice Alito's question, and I promise to\nget back to Judge Friendly and the Brooklyn Bridge.\nAs to -- we have alleged that in -- that\neffectively, ministerial activities did occur here. The\nSecond Circuit held, interpreting our complaint, that\nthe numbers were mechanically incorporated. That's as\nclose to ministerial as you get.\nWe used, in the complaint, the were\n\"adopted.\" We said that they were asleep at the wheel.\nThe meaning is the same, but the -- there were no\ncheckpoints. The checkpoints are illusory. If there\nwas a checkpoint, the guard was asleep at the\ncheckpoint, and the MSR number went right through the\ncheckpoint. Those are the allegations, and we should be\nable to stick with the allegations.\nNow, turning to the statute, my colleague\nindicated that the language with respect to foreign and\ninterstate commerce and so on, based on the Aramco\ndecision, was boilerplate. That's wrong. In this\nstatute, those specific statutory approaches towards\nstopping fraud are in the substance of the statute.\nThey are not in the jurisdictional statute. That's\nimportant. That's why that's different.\nAs to the Leasco example and Bersch example,\nwhat Leasco shows is a long chain of causation, because\nLeasco involved an American, not a foreigner, which was\nvery important under Judge Friendly's typology. And in\nLeasco, you have this extended line of causation\nbeginning with representations in the United States\nabout a friendly, tender offer. Then there was a phone\ncall, maybe in London, maybe in the United States, and\nthen there was a command by Saul Steinberg to his\ninvestment bankers: Go into the London Stock Exchange\nand start to buy.\nThat extended line of causation would not\npass muster under the direct cause test. The direct\ncause test as this Court is using it in the RICO area\nunder cases like Hemi, that would not pass muster. What\nthat shows, and Judge Friendly said that if you have a\nforeign Plaintiff, the direct cause is appropriate, that\nshows that the direct cause test is narrower, it's a\nscreening device, and it limits the possibilities when\nyou have a foreign Plaintiff.\nNow, that is a proper way to cabin the\nprivate cause of action. Taking an eraser to the\nstatute and saying: The only words that count are on an\nexchange, doesn't do it if you are going to keep a\nlinkage between the private cause of action and the\nexpressed words of the statute. If that can't do it,\nwhat are the other tools? And the other tools are the\ndirect cause test, and this Court has been very ably\nworking through some of these difficult fact patterns in\nthe RICO area.\nNow, in this case, there is not the problem\nthat there is in Hemi; there is not the intervening\ncause. You have a related party, NAB, that may or may\nnot be involved that allegedly is broken -- breaking the\nchain of causation. It is -- has to be, under that\ndoctrine, a totally third party, as it was in Hemi,\nwhere you have the State of New York, the City of New\nYork and had all these bouncing balls going back and\nforth. This is a straight shot between that MSR being\nfabricated in Florida and going on to the financial\nstatements. There is no intervening cause.\nAnd even if we assume that in some senses,\nit was normal to look at those financial statements,\nthat in and of -- of itself has failed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
