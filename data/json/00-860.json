        "content": "(10:05 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in No. 00-860, Correctional Services Corporation v.\nJohn Malesko.\nMr. Phillips.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe issue in this case is whether an action for\ndamages under Bivens should be applied to a private\ncorporation acting under color of Federal law.\nLike many cases, where you come out on a case\nlike this, I think in many ways depends on where you\nbegin, and the parties have put forward to this Court\nfundamentally conflicting paradigms with respect to the\nbest way to analyze Bivens based on this Court's prior\ndecisions.\nThe respondent and the court below essentially\nconcluded that Bivens is a ubiquitous remedy that ought,\ngenerally, to be available in order to maximize recoveries\nand to maximize, or at least optimize, deterrent values,\nand that it is our burden essentially to try to ascertain\nwhether there might be some conflicting or some exception\nto the Bivens doctrine that would get us out from under\nliability in the -- in this particular case. The --\nQUESTION: Mr. Phillips, do you -- this -- this\ninvolves only an action against the corporation not\nagainst its employees.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's correct, Justice O'Connor.\nQUESTION: Would -- if the action were brought\nas a Bivens action against the employees, do you concede\nthat there would be a Bivens action against them?\nMR. PHILLIPS: We have always assumed, from the\nfirst day of this litigation, that a Bivens action would\nlie against the individual employees.\nQUESTION: Well, there's a difference between\nassuming it arguendo and conceding it.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, for purposes of this\nlitigation and for purposes of my client, there's no\nquestion we would concede that an action would have\nlegitimately been -- been raised against them. To say in\na future case whether or not a private employee might\nraise an argument as to whether Bivens should be extended\nis a separate question.\nQUESTION: Now, if that's -- if that's true and\nthat concession holds, if the employee is sued for a\nwrongful act, under State law would it be permissible in\nyour view, just under standard principles of derivative\nliability, to hold the corporation for that tort, for the\ntort of its own employee?\nMR. PHILLIPS: You mean under a theory of\nrespondeat superior.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. PHILLIPS: As a matter of State law, it's\ngoing to depend on the State. Most States I think do\nrecognize respondeat superior liability.\nQUESTION: So, State courts -- State courts\ncould do that without interference with any Federal policy\nor -- or without any superseding Federal law to the\ncontrary.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, obviously, there's going to\nbe at least the potential argument raised with respect to\nBoyle and whether or not the -- the decision to hold the\nindividual liable under those circumstances is preempted\nunder Boyle. But I think the argument here is slightly\nweaker than it was in Boyle, and it probably depends to a\ncertain extent on -- on the -- on whether or not the\nFederal Government in fact is dictating what both the --\nwhat the employer and the employee are doing with respect\nto --\nQUESTION: Well, if that's true, the employer, I\nassume, would routinely be named in the suit. So, you're\nnot doing a whole lot by saying that the employer is\nindependently liable for its own -- for its own\nparticipation in the -- or alleged participation in the\ntort.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think you're doing an\nextraordinary amount, Justice Kennedy. And the\nGovernment's brief, I think quite rightly, points out at\npage 20 in footnote 10, that the availability of a\ncorporate defendant significantly changes the mix with\nrespect to any kind of litigation. And actually, if you\nlook at the three cases that postdate this Court's\ndecision in FDIC v. Meyer, all of those are cases in which\nthe only defendant who was named happened to be the\ncorporation. The individuals were not named under any of\nthose circumstances.\nQUESTION: But Mr. -- Mr. Phillips, if the -- if\nthe proper way of looking at this is the principal agency\nrelationship, when you're dealing with the Federal\nGovernment, the Federal Government is the principal, the\nagent is the officer. Here, when the Government\ncontracts, the principal agency relationship exists with\nthe corporation. So, I don't see why it doesn't follow\nthat the agent -- the agent in this case is the\ncorporation -- why the agency liability doesn't carry\nover.\nMR. PHILLIPS: The -- the premise of your\nquestion, Justice Ginsburg, I think is where the -- where\nthe mistake lies in the final outcome of the decision.\nThis Court made quite clear in FDIC v. Meyer that it's not\na principal agency relationship because there's no\nquestion that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\nwas the agent of the United States Government for purposes\nof what it did in that particular context. The Court said\nthat's not the right analysis.\nThe right analysis is to go back and look at the\nBivens action and make a judgment with respect to whether\nor not the litigation, as it comes to this Court,\nadequately serves the two primary purposes of Bivens; that\nis, that there is relief available and that there is an\neffective deterrent in place.\nIf those -- if those are satisfied, then the\nissue of whether you should extend Bivens to a new\ncategory of defendants, this Court said, should be\nanswered in the negative, saying that there is no reason\nto add additional defendants under those circumstances.\nQUESTION: Mr. Phillips, I wish somebody here\nwere arguing on behalf of the employee. It's -- it's\ncertainly in your interest to say, well, of course,\nthere's liability on the part of the employee. And it's\n-- it's in the interest of -- of your opponent to -- to\nsay the same. I'm not -- I can see us deciding this case\non, you know, well, after all, there's a suit against the\nemployee. Shouldn't we face that in a -- in a case in\nwhich somebody is -- is arguing that the employee is not\nliable?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, Justice --\nQUESTION: And there are arguments to that\neffect. I mean, after all, the -- the employee you say is\nan agent of the United States, but if -- if he's acting\nunder color of Federal law as an agent of the United\nStates, he's only an agent of the United States because\nhe's -- he's an agent of -- of your client. So, he's sort\nof an agent of an agent. It would seem very strange to me\nto hold -- to hold the employee and not to hold your\ncorporation.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, the question ultimately\ncomes down to this, Your Honor, is that does it make any\nmore sense in this context to resolve this issue at this\npoint in time than it did to decide the FDIC v. Meyer case\nat that point in time. Because, again, we didn't have the\nemployee involved in the litigation as it came to this\nCourt. He had fallen out in that litigation, just as the\nemployee had fallen out in this litigation. And what the\nCourt said was, we should analyze and, indeed, have to\nresolve the conflict as to whether a private corporate\ndefendant ought to be liable under these circumstances.\nSo, that issue needs to be resolved.\nAnd, what's more, if the Court puts off for\nanother day deciding the liability of the employee, it\ndoesn't affect whether my client ought to be held not\nresponsible in a Bivens action because either one of two\nthings will happen. Either you will conclude that private\nemployees are, in fact, susceptible to an action under\nBivens, in which case the adequacy of the remedy and the\nadequacy of the deterrent by having that direct lawsuit\nmeans that there's no reason to extend Bivens to my\nclient. Or you'll conclude that the distinction is\nbetween public and private actors and that we have special\nreasons giving us hesitation and caution into extending\nthe Bivens action, since it's an implied cause of action\nand not a congressionally adopted one, into the sphere\nwhere the private actors are acting under color of Federal\nright.\nQUESTION: Strictly speaking, Mr. Phillips, for\nyou to say that you're making a concession that the\nemployee -- I mean, that's like a lawyer representing A\nsaying he concedes B would be liable.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I was only --\nQUESTION: I mean, it's not much of a\nconcession.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I was simply answering Justice\nKennedy and Justice O'Connor's question. They phrased it\nin the form of a concession, to be sure.\nQUESTION: I know they did.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm not giving up much in that\nregard.\nBut as I say, the important element here, at\nleast in my judgment, about how all this plays out is that\nif the Court decides that employees are amenable to suit,\nthere's no reason to sue the corporation. If they decide\nthey are not amenable to suit, it's going to be because of\nthe public/private distinction. And again, under that\ntheory, we're not amenable to suit.\nQUESTION: Mr. Phillips --\nQUESTION: Well, it could be on -- on the basis\nthat they're an agent of an agent, that we're not going to\ntrack it that far down. I mean, you -- it's your\ncorporation that has been hired directly by the\nGovernment, not the individual employees of your\ncorporation. I mean, that's certainly another basis on\nwhich one could draw --\nMR. PHILLIPS: That would be an argument, but in\norder to do that, Justice Scalia, you would then have to\nabandon what was one of the principal legs of Bivens in\nthe first instance, which is that the litigation against\nthe private individual and the deterrent value of\nlitigation against the private individual is the most\nsignificant way to achieve the overall objectives --\nQUESTION: Well, I don't know that we would have\nto abandon that because the -- the concern, as I\nunderstand it, that the action against the individual has\na more significant deterrent effect than the action\nagainst the agency, was a concern that was expressed in\nthe context of dealing with a public agency.\nHere we're dealing, in the case of your client,\nwith a private corporation. And I would suppose that the\ndeterrent effect of holding the private corporation liable\nfor the acts of its employee would be very significant. I\nassume that a private corporation like yours is going to\nbe very careful about employees who, in effect, saddle it\nwith significant liability. So, on the deterrence theory,\nit seems to me you -- you would lose the argument.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think the flaw in your analysis\nof the deterrence theory, Justice Souter, is that you're\nlooking to figure out what is sort of the optimal answer\nfor deterrence. And the way I read this Court's decision\nin FDIC v. Meyer is that what we satisfy ourselves about\nis, is there an effective deterrent and an effective\ndamages remedy in place and available to the individual\nplaintiff in a particular instance. And that -- it seems\nto me that's the gap-filler role that Bivens calls on the\nCourt to -- to provide.\nWhen you go beyond -- I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: I'm sorry. You finish.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But when you go beyond that, it\nseems to me you then assume much more of a legislative\nrole. Then you're trying to balance the relative optimal\ndeterrence values. Then you have to take into account the\neffect on the Federal fisc or the relationship between the\n-- the Federal contractor and the Federal Government. And\nthat's a series of questions, I submit to Your Honors, you\nought to leave to Congress.\nAnd that's exactly what the Court said in Meyer.\nIt analyzed and said, questions of optimal deterrence,\nquestions of effect on the Federal treasury, those are\nissues that we think are better dealt with by Congress as\nlong as we have an adequate --\nQUESTION: Yes, but if you carry -- if the carry\nthe logic of that argument far enough, then there would be\nno liability at all because we know that if we hold, for\nexample, the individual liable, there is going to be a\ntendency there to shift that liability either by insurance\nor by respondeat superior and insurance, ultimately to the\ncost of contracting. And we know, even in the\ngovernmental situation, if you hold the individual liable,\nchances are there is going to be some kind of liability\nmitigating mechanism, whether it be insurance or whatnot,\nthat ultimately is going to find its way into the wage\nstructure. So, if -- if we start getting too fussy about\nthat, we better call the whole thing off and -- and\noverrule Bivens.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well -- obviously, we don't ask\nthe Court to overrule Bivens. At least, we make that\nargument in the brief.\nBut the -- I think the answer to that is there\nare two components of Bivens. One is, is there in place\nthe gap-filler adequate remedy? Is there a damages remedy\nand a deterrent effect from that damages remedy? Is that\nin place? Then sometimes, even though that's in place,\nthere will be a serious question as to whether or not,\nnevertheless, special circumstances suggest that there\nought to be caution. And it's frankly the -- the\nrespondents burden to satisfy both elements of that.\nWhat I'm suggesting to you in this context is\nyou don't have to look at what the impact would be on the\nFederal Government at the end of the day. What you have\nto look at is whether there is an adequate remedy in\nplace, and if you didn't have that, I think there would be\na serious --\nQUESTION: How is this adequate remedy? The --\nas far as deterrence is concerned, I thought Richardson\nexplains why the deterrence considerations with the\nprivate company work perfectly, but they don't work at all\nwhere the principal is the Federal agency. And that's\nwhat I think Justice Souter was pointing out.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nQUESTION: As far as alternative remedy is\nconcerned, which alternative remedy? If you mean would\nthere be a remedy under State law, that of course exists\nin Bivens too. If you mean that you could sue the private\nperson under Bivens but not the company, if that's what\nyou mean, the individual but not the company --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Correct.\nQUESTION: -- well, the next case the\nindividual, if we say you can sue the company, would say\nthe same thing. So, I mean, you see it's six of one, half\na dozen of the other. The private person would say you\nhave an adequate -- do you see my point?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, you made two -- you made\ntwo points, Justice Breyer.\nQUESTION: The private person -- you -- you\ncould have -- if -- if you're going to allow corporations,\nthey say, oh, no, you have a private remedy against the\nindividual, which I'm sure you conceded for that reason.\nThe individual would say, oh, no, you have a perfectly\nadequate remedy against the corporation.\nQUESTION: I concede that you have a perfectly\nvalid remedy, yes.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: What?\nQUESTION: He would say, I concede that you have\na perfectly --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Exactly. That's right.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Indeed, I may be making the\nargument --\nQUESTION: So, why then, given that conundrum,\ndeterrence: Richardson. Adequate remedy: the problem we\nstated. Conclusion: make it a parallel to 1983.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, now you've made three\npoints, Justice Breyer. And let me try to take them up in\n-- in turn.\nFirst of all, with -- with respect to\nRichardson, I mean, that's an immunity case, and the Court\nis in a world where it has to resolve optimization in the\nimmunity context. That's a judge-made set of rules, and\nthis Court is obliged to resolve it in the best way that\nit can under those circumstances. It's a fundamentally\ndifferent question about whether you hold the defendant\nliable in the first instance in a private -- privately\nimplied cause of action derived directly under the\nConstitution.\nWe could differ and disagree about what's the\nright method of -- of achieving optimization, but I don't\nthink you can read Richardson as saying categorically that\nyou will -- you will lose all your deterrent effect. To\nsay that is I think to both abandon what you said in\nBivens and clearly abandon what you said in Meyer.\nWith respect to the ability of the private\nperson to come in and argue the next time around, his\nargument I think, frankly, is going to be a tough one\nbecause what he's got to say is even though you have now\nheld the corporation not to be liable -- I'm assuming for\npurposes of the moment that I win here -- that -- that we,\nnevertheless, also ought not to be liable. And, again, as\nI said earlier, I think the distinction there is between\nthe -- having a remedy in place that is in any meaningful\nway effect or not, and therefore it is a tougher argument\nfor the private employee under those circumstances to make\nthat particular argument.\nAnd then your last point with respect to section\n1983 simply disregards what I perceive to be the\nfundamental difference between having a congressional\nenactment that comprehensively regulates a particular area\nprovide liability against any person and sets up a set of\nrules in -- in order to effectuate that particular remedy\nand the situation we face in Bivens where, heretofore, we\nhave never imposed -- this Court has never --\nQUESTION: And -- and --\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: -- in 1983, too, in Monell we\nrejected the idea there could be any sort of respondeat\nsuperior liability. You had to show that the -- there was\na policy maker involved and that sort of thing.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's absolutely correct, Mr.\nChief Justice.\nQUESTION: Is that not present here, Mr.\nPhillips? Because the policy of saying people who live\nabove -- below the fifth floor, that's a policy set by the\nemployer. So, this is a case where it's not an assault by\na guard. This is a case of policies set by the\ncorporation itself.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, there are two answers to\nthat, Justice Ginsburg.\nFirst of all, no policy gets set by a\ncorporation as such. All -- all policies, just like all\nactions of corporations, have to be undertaken by\nindividuals. Somebody had to have adopted that policy.\nBut second of all, I don't read the respondent's\ncomplaint here to have alleged any policy of the\ncorporation was at fault here. The -- the complaint\nitself specifically says there was an exception made for\nthe respondent so that he could take the elevator. A\nspecific employee who was named as a defendant --\nQUESTION: Not in -- not in the written policy.\nIt wasn't written down and that's why this guard didn't\nget it. But anyway, at this stage, we have to construe\nthe complaint most favorably to the plaintiff. Is that\nnot so?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I -- you can construe it\nmost favorably to the plaintiff, but not necessarily to\nembrace a complete different theory of the case that is\nfar from clear.\nAnd this is -- and remember, this was written by\ncounsel. This is not a pro se complaint we're talking\nabout. This was counsel's complaint. I think if they had\nmeant for this to be a policy or practice case, they would\nhave said so.\nBut I think the more fundamental point here is\n-- is that -- is that there has to be a policy maker. If\nthat policy was unconstitutional, then it's still\navailable to the plaintiff in a Bivens action to sue that\npolicy maker directly for having adopted the\nunconstitutional policy and to sue the employee for having\nimplemented the policy in an unconstitutional fashion.\nSo, there are adequate remedies, which means that the\nremedy against us is inappropriate.\nIf there are no further questions, I'd reserve\nthe balance of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Phillips.\nMr. Lamken, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. LAMKEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWhen an inmate in a federally operated facility\nis subjected to a constitutional deprivation, that inmate\nhas a remedy against the individual Federal officers who\ncommitted the constitutional deprivation. There is no\nindication that that Federal remedy is inadequate for --\nQUESTION: Are you making that as arguendo, or\nare you conceding that? Now, your brief seems to make a\nconcession to that effect.\nMR. LAMKEN: In the first instance, we think it\nshould be assumed arguendo because if there's a reason not\nto subject the individuals, the private individuals, to\nliability under Bivens, it would be that private\nindividuals have so few immunities and so few defenses,\ncompared to their governmental counterparts, that there's\nno reason to infer a Federal cause of action. If it's\ntrue with respect to them, then it's a fortiori true with\nrespect to the corporation as well.\nQUESTION: Why couldn't you say the same about\njoint tortfeasors?\nMR. LAMKEN: Pardon? Oh.\nQUESTION: Why couldn't you make the same kind\nof argument about joint tortfeasors? You'd say there's no\nreason to hold two. We have one.\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, in fact, with respect to\njoint tortfeasors, you have two separate actions. They're\nboth liable for their --\nQUESTION: Why wouldn't the second -- you'd say\nwe'd only give you one, whoever you sue first, because\nit's adequate.\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, you need to deter both of the\njoint -- the actions by the joint tortfeasors.\nQUESTION: And here we have to deter the\npolicies of the corporation.\nMR. LAMKEN: Yes, but the corporation is an\nunusual tortfeasor in this sense, in that it cannot act\nexcept through other individuals, through its employees.\nSo long as you deter --\nQUESTION: But that's true across the whole law\nof torts. I mean, I've been lumbering along for half a\ncentury under respondeat superior. I thought this -- this\nwas a deterrent to the employer if the employer is liable\nfor the employee's wrong. Why is it suddenly different?\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, if this were a common law\ncourt or a legislature, I could certainly see adopting the\ncommon law rule. But the Court -- this is not a common\nlaw court, and what -- Congress has the principal role of\nestablishing causes of actions, Federal cause of action,\nfor damages. So, the role of the Court is not to\nestablish --\nQUESTION: It just rings -- it just doesn't ring\ntrue to me that there's no deterrence by holding the\ncorporation liable. I -- I thought the whole law of torts\nwas based on a contrary assumption.\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, in fact, Your Honor, if you\nlook at, for example, the fifth edition of Prosser &\nKeeton on Torts, William Prosser tells us that that\nargument is makeweight, and that the real reason for\nholding the corporation liable under respondeat superior\nis to ensure that the costs of accidents are incorporated\ninto the price of products and, therefore, spread to\nsociety at large.\nIn a context like this one, where you have one\npurchaser, the Government, and the cause of action is\nunique to where the Government is the purchaser of the\nservice, that type of rationale can't hold water. This\nCourt is generally very cautious about imposing liability\nfor the purpose of distributing money --\nQUESTION: Except that one purchaser gets its\nmoney from everybody. I -- I think nobody can spread --\ncan spread the cost as well as the Government.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. LAMKEN: Yes, Your Honor. But it is\ntypically -- this Court is typically most cautious about\nestablishing rules that would have the effect of taking\nmoney from the treasury, which is under Congress' control\nand to be spent for the public good and spending it\naccording to --\nQUESTION: That's -- that's a different argument\nwhich -- which you make, that we shouldn't --\nQUESTION: May I ask you --\nMR. LAMKEN: That -- that --\nQUESTION: It would be, in effect, the same as\nholding the Government liable.\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, in this case, where you have\na uniquely governmental purchaser and a uniquely\ngovernmental cause of action, it does tend to have that\neffect, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: May I ask you a hypothetical that Mr.\nPhillips' last argument suggested to me? Supposing you\nhave a case in which an executive sets the policy that\neverybody has to climb the -- the six flights of stairs\nevery day. Then the executive quits. Five years later,\nan employee is compelled to climb the steps because that\npolicy is in place. Whom can he sue?\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, Your Honor, when -- when\nprisoners in public institutions, federally operated\ninstitutions, encounter precisely that situation --\nQUESTION: No. I'm assuming, of course, there's\na corporation involved here.\nMR. LAMKEN: But it shows that this -- that type\nof situation is hardly unique to a private corporation.\nIt -- it occurs all the time in Federal institutions. And\nhe would be able to sue first any employee who enforced\nthe -- the policy.\nQUESTION: All the employee is doing is carrying\nout his instructions.\nMR. LAMKEN: Right, but there is under Bivens no\nNuremberg defense. Each -- one of the teachings of Bivens\nis that the responsibility for respecting constitutional\nrights is personal and individual, and therefore,\nliability for violating constitutional rights is also\npersonal and individual. It ill-serves that notion of\npersonal responsibility to shift the liability from the --\nfrom individual -- individuals who violate constitutional\nrights to some other source of money such as the\nshareholders or the Government.\nQUESTION: Supposing the policy also said any\nemployee who fails to carry out this policy gets fired\nforthwith.\nMR. LAMKEN: That would be the same thing if a\n-- if an individual Bureau of Prisons employee --\nQUESTION: -- the individual liable for --\nMR. LAMKEN: Individually liable. Plus you also\nget to sue the policy maker and anybody who exhibited\ndeliberate indifference in carrying on that policy. It's\nprecisely the same rule that exists in the Federal context\nwhen you have a -- a Bureau of Prisons-run facility.\nQUESTION: Why does it make a large difference\nwhether you sue the CEO or the corporation itself?\nPractically in terms of your interest as the Government\nmoney, if the corporation is going to pick up the tab, why\ndoes the Government care?\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think the\nrub is in the question, if the corporation is going to\npick up the tab. The corporation will not necessarily\npick up the tab. The Government, for example, does not\nroutinely indemnify its employees before a judgment or\neven necessarily after judgment. On occasion, we both\ndecline to indemnify them. Sometimes we decline to\nrepresent them. Sometimes we criminally prosecute them\nourselves. The point of the matter is to avoid moral\nhazard, to ensure that there is that deterrent effect,\nboth corporations and the Government alike are wise not to\nindemnify their employees in advance and refer only to\nindemnify in those circumstances where it's both in the\ncorporate interest and in the interest of ensuring that\nthe corporation or the individuals --\nQUESTION: You also may get larger judgments\nagainst the corporation than -- than against Jack\nArmstrong personally. No?\nMR. LAMKEN: That is one of the difficulties and\nthat is one of the reasons why there is concern that\nindividuals, if given the opportunity, will choose to sue\nonly the corporation and not the individuals. And as Mr.\nPhillips pointed out, in the three post-Meyer cases where\nthis issue has come up, in each of them, the individual\nchose to sue only the corporation and not the individual.\nAnd, therefore, the direct deterrent effect on the\nindividual, the direct deterrent effect that exists and\noperates within the Federal Government, would be absent in\nthe other context if the Court were to recognize a Bivens\nagainst corporations as well as the individuals who\nviolate --\nQUESTION: If -- if the Government --\nQUESTION: If we reject your position and impose\nBivens liability on the corporation, I assume Congress\ncan't do anything about that absent some supplemental\nscheme that's equally effective?\nMR. LAMKEN: Your Honor, it's not clear the\ndegree to which Congress can replace Bivens liability. I\nwould believe that Congress would have the ability to\neither -- if this Court were to decide not to have\ncorporate liability, Congress could act to establish that\nliability, or if the Court were to say that there is --\nQUESTION: The other way around.\nMR. LAMKEN: The other way around is a more\ndifficult question. I don't believe this Court's cases\nare clear. However, if Congress does establish an\nalternative remedy, I believe the Court would be very\nlikely to respect it unless it is clearly inadequate for\nthe purposes.\nQUESTION: I don't understand that. If Congress\nestablished an alternative remedy, we might say that the\nConstitution no longer requires the Bivens -- the Bivens\nremedy.\nMR. LAMKEN: No, Your Honor. As I read\nBivens --\nQUESTION: But if Congress just -- just decides\nthat we're wrong in saying that there's a Bivens remedy\nhere, what could -- what could Congress possibly do about\nit? I mean, if -- if there is a Bivens remedy here, it's\none that's demanded by the Constitution. Right?\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, Your Honor, it depends on how\nyou read Bivens. Bivens itself doesn't purport to be\ncompelled by the Constitution, that the Constitution\nrequires it. It very much relied on cases like J.I. v.\nBorak where the Court felt that it was in a position to\nsort of assist in the vindication of constitutional\nrights, even if it were not mandated or compelled by the\nConstitution.\nWhere the Court -- where the Court uses its\ndiscretion to do that, however, the Court must be\nparticularly cautious about it so that it does not usurp\nthe role of Congress as the principal creator of -- of\ncauses of action for damages under the Constitution.\nIf there are no further questions.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Lamken.\nMr. Pasternak, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN PASTERNAK\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. PASTERNAK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe question before the Court today is whether\nthe Bivens cause of action is applicable to a for-profit\ncorporation carrying out a core function of the Federal\nGovernment. There's no dispute that in operating the Le\nMarquis Prison, CSC was performing a core governmental\nfunction.\nThere's an important distinction, both as a\nmatter of history, constitutional law, and common sense,\nbetween Government and private corporations, between the\nGovernment way of doing things or the Government model and\nthe private market model. The Solicitor General so\nrecognized 4 years ago in the oral argument in Richardson\nv. McKnight. And the distinction exists due to the\ndifferences in accountability, its mission, and the degree\nof control that exists over the employees.\nAs far as accountability, the Bureau of Prisons,\nas a Federal Government agent, is accountable to Congress\nand to the public, as opposed to a private for-profit\ncorporation, like CSC, which is responsible to its\nshareholders. It has no one appointed onto its board from\neither Congress or the President.\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. Pasternak, if Bivens\nremedies are available against the employees of the\ncorporation, why isn't that enough?\nMR. PASTERNAK: Because of the mentality that\nexists as far as the corporation, Your Honor. It's the\ncorporation that has a direct relationship with the\nFederal Government. It's the one that has the contract.\nQUESTION: Yes, but the corporation can only act\nthrough its employees, and if those employees are subject\nto Bivens liability, if they are, why isn't that enough to\ndeter any unconstitutional conduct?\nMR. PASTERNAK: It wouldn't be sufficient\nbecause the employees are at-will employees. Their job is\non the line. Their promotions are on the line. They're\nfollowing the directions as far as the corporation in\norder to get ahead. While the --\nQUESTION: How can you generalize that the\nemployees are at-will employees? I mean, that would vary\nperhaps from case to case.\nMR. PASTERNAK: In the State of New York,\nthey're at-will employees.\nQUESTION: But we're deciding a case not just on\nthe basis of the State of New York, but maybe in some\nother States, they have a 3-year contract.\nMR. PASTERNAK: It may vary from State to State.\nIt may vary from individual to individual, but the focus\nstill has to be that it's the corporation that has the\ncontrol, and to determine whether or not there's a breach\nas far as the employee's contract or whatever, it's the\none that's setting the policies that the individuals have\nbeen following.\nQUESTION: Mr. Pasternak, do you think running a\nmunicipally owned utility is a core governmental function?\nMR. PASTERNAK: It's possible that it may be.\nQUESTION: May be.\nWhat about running a national park or a public\npark? Is that a core governmental function?\nMR. PASTERNAK: Getting further removed. I\nthink it might be, but again, it's not a prison situation.\nQUESTION: We're going to develop a whole new\narea of constitutional or quasi-constitutional law\ndeciding case by case what is a core governmental function\nand what isn't a core government -- you assert that only\n-- only those corporations that are performing core\ngovernmental functions would -- would be subject to Bivens\nliability, not all corporations who are under contract\nwith the Government.\nMR. PASTERNAK: If I may respond. As far as the\n1983 analysis or under the Federal Tort Claims Act, the\nsame type of analysis has to be done to determine whether\nor not you have a Government actor and then whether or not\nthere was a violation that takes place.\nIn our fact pattern here, there's no real\nquestion that in operating the prison, it is a core\ngovernmental function. They are authorized to act because\nthe -- the Government has contracted with the corporation\nand has embodied it with the power, in order to act and to\nrun that facility.\nQUESTION: Have -- is there a whole line of\ncases under section 1983 dealing with this subject of what\nis a core governmental function?\nMR. PASTERNAK: There's not a whole line of\ncases, but there is -- there are cases, Your Honor, that\nhave to be addressed as far as either a Federal Tort\nClaims Act case or a section 1983 as to the issue of\nwhether or not Amtrak, for instance -- whether it would be\nacting as a Government agent or not.\nQUESTION: Does it have to do with whether it's\nperforming a core governmental function or not? It has to\ndo with whether it's a Federal agency or not. That's\nquite a different question from whether it's performing a\ncore governmental function. I'm talking about a\nconcededly private corporation, and -- and you want us to\ndecide case by case when -- when you hire a private\ncorporation to manage concessions at a -- at a national\npark, whether that is a core governmental function or not.\nMR. PASTERNAK: I think anytime you're dealing\nwith a corporation as opposed to a Government agency,\nthere are different things that come into play as far as\nwhat their motives are.\nQUESTION: I thought you just wanted us to\ndecide a case involving prisons, which can be run by a\nState, by the Federal Government, or can be contracted out\nby either.\nMR. PASTERNAK: That is what our fact pattern\nis.\nQUESTION: And this is a substitute for a\nFederal prison just as sometimes Federal prisoners are\nhoused in State prisons.\nMR. PASTERNAK: That's correct.\nQUESTION: And would there be liability in that\nsituation? Suppose this halfway house had been run by the\nState of New York.\nMR. PASTERNAK: Then there would be liability\nfor the violation of the Federal Constitution, and there\nwould be no difference. In fact, this particular facility\nhoused both State and Federal prisoners --\nQUESTION: And as to the -- so, if -- if Mr.\nMalesko had been a State prisoner?\nMR. PASTERNAK: Then he would have his claim.\nWe would literally have to be checking the dog tags of the\nindividual housed at this particular facility under the\nsame fact pattern to determine, under the CSC's argument,\nwhether or not there would be liability. And we submit\nthat that's the wrong analysis to make, that a Federal\nprisoner should certainly have equal, the same rights as a\nState prisoner.\nQUESTION: May I clarify a point that I raised\nto Mr. Phillips? Is your complaint one of a pattern or\npractice attributable to the corporation as distinguished\nfrom the action of the individual guard? He said that you\ndid not plead any kind of policy on behalf of the\ncorporation.\nMR. PASTERNAK: There are different elements as\nfar as what was pleading in the complaint. There was\ninitially a pro se complaint that was filed. The only\nsubstitution that really took place at the time of the\npleading was to name the individual guard. That was ruled\nto be untimely by the court because Mr. Malesko should\nhave known -- arguably should have known or should have\nbeen trying to find out who that individual was.\nThe problem that exists, obviously, is trying to\nidentify who the individuals are that set the corporate\npolicy.\nAs far as the specific policy, there was the\npolicy of putting Mr. Malesko up on the firth floor, as\nopposed to a lower floor.\nQUESTION: Was that pleaded as a policy?\nMR. PASTERNAK: Not pleaded directly as a\npolicy, no.\nQUESTION: You say not pleaded directly as a\npolicy. What do you mean by that?\nMR. PASTERNAK: Well, again, we're going back to\nthe language of the pro se complaint.\nQUESTION: Yes. And that's what I was asking\nyou about. What did the pro se complaint say about it?\nMR. PASTERNAK: He did not allege it as a policy\nper se. He alleged it that it was improper as far as the\nhousing. We have the situation where you have him\nhoused --\nQUESTION: In fact, he did allege that he was\npermitted to use the elevator usually, didn't he?\nMR. PASTERNAK: He did.\nQUESTION: Yes. So, he couldn't have been\ncomplaining about the policy then.\nMR. PASTERNAK: Well, there's still a complaint\nthat would exist -- I mean, there is a possible claim as\nfar as the ADA and just the general logic of housing\nsomebody with a known heart condition on the fifth floor\nwhere he would be susceptible to being ill in the event of\na fire. I mean, it doesn't make any sense, as they\nacknowledged in discovery, in order to have someone housed\non that higher floor if there's a danger that exists. It\njust doesn't make any sense.\nQUESTION: I thought his heart attack made it\nhard to climb stairs, but going down stairs might be\ndifferent.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: I would like to hear directly your --\nyour response. The Chief Justice had a point I hadn't\nthought of, which is true, that in Monell, there isn't\ndirect respondeat superior liability in a case involving\nan entity that does not have sovereign immunity, namely\nthe municipality.\nAll right. How -- how does that play out here?\nMR. PASTERNAK: Here --\nQUESTION: What is that -- should there be\nrespondeat superior? Is it necessary to parallel the\nMonell? What's your opinion?\nMR. PASTERNAK: I would argue that under either\nsituation, we would satisfy the requirement. Under the\nrespondeat superior, we would certainly satisfy it. Under\nthe Monell standard, it's the failure to adequately train\nand supervise the guards.\nQUESTION: All right. So, you can go either\nway. But what in your opinion is the correct rule of law?\nMR. PASTERNAK: If we're looking for parallelism\nbetween the two, then it would make sense to have the\nMonell standard, but it not necessarily has to follow\nbecause under common law, we would have the respondeat\nsuperior. I would argue for the respondeat superior and\nto have it as a normal liability as you do in normal\ncases.\nQUESTION: Well, we rejected parallelism in\nRichardson. Parallelism -- symmetry is very difficult to\nachieve in this area as of this point, no matter what we\ndo.\nMR. PASTERNAK: It was rejected and symmetry is\ndifficult to achieve. However, we are seeking symmetry in\nthe sense that a private corporation should be held\naccountable the same way it is acting under a contract\nwith the Government and the same way a State prisoner\nwould have the same remedy against the corporation --\nQUESTION: Well, you're arguing the so-called\nparallelism with section 1983 actions. But it's been\npointed out that was a congressional enactment, and there\nis no parallel enactment for Bivens type claims. That was\na Court-created doctrine and it's been rather limited.\nMR. PASTERNAK: It has been limited. It is\nCourt-created, in order to address deterrence, but it has\nbeen applied to the situation of a nongovernmental -\nnongovernment or to a nongovernment agency.\nIn this situation, the question that arises is\nwhere does a private for-profit corporation fall on the\nspectrum. Is it more akin to a Government agency which\nhas to be responsible to Congress, to the President, and\nto the public, or is it more akin to a regular Federal\nemployee? We would submit that it's closer to a Federal\nemployee, only it has certain negatives worse than a\nFederal employee in the sense that it has a duty, a\nfiduciary duty, to try and maximize profits, a factor that\nwould not normally enter into the situation of a Federal\nemployee who's just going along and doing his job and\nfulfilling his requirements. But here you have a specific\nfiduciary duty to maximize the profits.\nThey also -- the person who were in control.\nThere, the corporation is the one that controls its\nemployees and sends the directives as far as hiring,\nfiring, promotions, benefits. It is the one that has the\ncontrol and can send the signals on to each individual\nemployee. So, as far as where it falls in the scheme, we\nwould submit it is more akin to a Federal employee, only\nthere are greater dangers which would warrant the\nimposition of the Bivens liability in order to have the\nproper deterrence.\nQUESTION: Why shouldn't we leave this to the\nFederal Government, to the Congress, to determine, rather\nthan doing it ourselves?\nMR. PASTERNAK: For the same --\nQUESTION: I mean, we can say this is a totally\ndifferent situation from what Bivens, whether it was right\nor wrong, decided. That decided a case where you have a\nFederal officer acting. These are not technically Federal\nofficers. If there is going to be a cause of action,\nCongress can create it. If Congress hasn't created it,\nthere's no cause of action, which is the usual situation\nin the world, isn't it?\nMR. PASTERNAK: Oftentimes. However, the issue\nhere is the Federal employee under Bivens is acting\nbecause the Government has delegated that responsibility\nto him to act. In a sense it's a contract. He's been\nhired to act. So too, you have the corporation who has\nbeen hired by the Federal Government pursuant to the\ncontract in order to act and to satisfy what the\nrequirements are.\nQUESTION: It may be logical to extend it. It\nmay well be. And if it's logical, presumably Congress\nwill do it.\nQUESTION: And also, there -- there is\nundoubtedly a State law cause of action in negligence that\nwould lie against both the employee and the employer under\nrespondeat superior.\nMR. PASTERNAK: There would be a common law\ncause of action. However, that would not necessarily\naddress the separate constitutional violation that\noccurred that needs its own deterrence.\nQUESTION: Would there have been a State cause\nof action against Federal agents acting under -- under\nFederal law?\nMR. PASTERNAK: You would have the issue as far\nas normally you would have the immunity that would be\ngranted under the State law, and you would have the\nproblems in that direction. But we do not have --\nQUESTION: Which means that there's a special\nreason for the court to invent a cause of action that does\nnot appear anywhere in the Constitution or in a statute\nfor Federal agents who perhaps can't be sued under State\nlaw. But when you're not talking about Federal agents --\nyou're talking about private employees -- normal tort law\nundoubtedly applies. And why -- why can't we leave it\nthere? And -- and if Congress wants to extend an\nadditional cause of action, let -- let Congress do it.\nMR. PASTERNAK: Since we are dealing with a\nviolation of the Federal Constitution, we would submit\nthat there should be one uniform body of decisions coming\nout as far as what that Federal law should be and how it\nshould be interpreted, that we should not be subjected to\nthe vagaries of the differences in the various States as\nto their rules as far as procedure, discovery, but there\nshould be one -- one body of law encompassing, from the\nFederal side, a violation of a Federal constitutional\nright. It's not sufficient to just leave it to the\nStates.\nQUESTION: Well, is it clear that the employee\nwould be liable under State law in light of Boyle v.\nUnited Technologies?\nMR. PASTERNAK: In McKnight, the argument --\nrejected the argument of Boyle, as far as a corporation\nbeing -- not being liable and a danger as far as the\npublic fisc. In this type of a situation, we would submit\nthat it would be appropriate to find the corporation\nliable and that the dangers to the public fisc are\nminimal, certainly more minimal than you would have in the\nnormal Bivens case, we would submit.\nQUESTION: Well, of course, McKnight rejected\nparallelism, and -- and you -- you want it. McKnight is\nnot your best precedent.\nMR. PASTERNAK: Not entirely, but we are seeking\nto have the parallelism also as far as a -- rights of a\nFederal prisoner and a State prisoner, to both be able to\ngo and sue the corporation that is --\nQUESTION: But you have an anomaly either way\nbecause why shouldn't the symmetry be between someone who\nis a Federal prisoner in the Federal prison and someone\nwho's a Federal prisoner in a private prison? You\nrecognize that there would be no action against the Bureau\nof Prisons if the Bureau of Prisons had been the jailer.\nSo, why should it be -- why shouldn't that be the\nsymmetry?\nMR. PASTERNAK: Because the Correctional\nServices Corporation is not the Government. It operates\nunder a different set of rules and regulations.\nQUESTION: But you want it to be like the State\ngovernment, because if it were a State -- if a State were\nrunning this prison, then there would be liability.\nMR. PASTERNAK: Yes, but what I'm looking for is\nit for not -- for it to be recognized by this Court that\nthe private corporation, just like the State, is not the\nFederal Government. There is no Federal Government\nimmunity that applies. That's the reason we can sue the\nStates if there's a violation. So too, we should\ncertainly be able to sue a private corporation, a private\ncorporation which is operating under a different set of\nrules and regulations than is the norm for the Federal\nGovernment and for a Federal agency.\nQUESTION: With respect to the adequacy of a\nremedy in the State court, is it not so that the liability\nwould be greater as to a private employee because the\nprivate employee would not have a defense of qualified\nimmunity that would be available to a Federal officer?\nMR. PASTERNAK: There would be less defenses\nraised as far as a private individual. That's correct.\nQUESTION: And that would tend to make the State\nlaw remedy more adequate?\nMR. PASTERNAK: Possibly more adequate but still\ninadequate in order to address a Federal constitutional\nviolation.\nQUESTION: Well, you're saying that -- I think\nyou're saying the State law remedy simply doesn't address\nthe constitutional violation. The State law remedy may be\na State tort remedy, but it's not an Eighth Amendment\nremedy. Is that you're --\nMR. PASTERNAK: That is correct.\nQUESTION: You know, there's one puzzling thing\nabout this case. You don't really cite the Eighth\nAmendment in your complaint, as I read it, do you? That\nis, it isn't an Eighth Amendment claim where you're\nclaiming deliberate indifference on behalf of the prison\nofficials? Is that the nature?\nMR. PASTERNAK: It does -- it is an Eighth\nAmendment, but it is not cited.\nQUESTION: And then, therefore, your burden in\nthe Federal claim under the Eighth Amendment is heavier\nthan an ordinary negligence case, isn't it? So, by going\ninto Federal court, you -- you've assumed a higher burden\nthan if you brought a negligence case. Am I correct in\nthat?\nMR. PASTERNAK: Well, both theories would be\napplicable as far as being -- bringing the suit. There\nwould be a higher standard in the Federal court as far as\nthe deliberate in difference --\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. PASTERNAK: -- a standard which we submit we\nwould -- my client, in filing the suit pro se, satisfied.\nHe would also be satisfying a lower standard as far as the\nnegligence as well.\nQUESTION: Was this complaint ever amended since\nyour client gained representation, or are we still\noperating under the pro se complaint?\nMR. PASTERNAK: It was amended only for the\npurposes of -- of attempting to name Mr. Urena as a\ndefendant, and then there was a proposed second amended\ncomplaint which would be naming additional defendants,\nwhich -- and I believe also different causes of actions,\nbut that was denied at that time.\nQUESTION: At -- at -- it's puzzling why there\nwasn't enough time to identify that individual, that Mr.\nUrena. I could understand the pro se litigant having a\nlimited ability, but once lawyers came into it, why wasn't\n-- why was it so hard to find out who was John Doe I?\nMR. PASTERNAK: My appearance came after the\ntime period. Mr. Malesko had the case, and there was a\nmotion that was initially made to dismiss the case. It\nwas only after that case, that that motion was denied,\nthat my -- that I came into the case. So, he had the case\npro se for the entire time period where he would have had\nto identify who the John Doe was and would have had to\nknow how to conduct the discovery in order to ascertain\nwho the John Does were and the difficulty that he would\nhave, as far as the corporation's responsiveness to\nidentifying who Mr. Urena was, who set the policy as far\nas the elevator, who set the policy as far as the\nmedication, who set all of the policies.\nIt's not an easy burden for someone to try and\nidentify who the specific person is that would have to be\nsued, which is why the suing of the corporation is a more\nmanageable one from the plaintiff's point of view.\nIt would also be a more manageable one from the\ndefendant's point of view, we would submit, also because\nit would allow the corporation to be the one who's\ncontrolling the litigation.\nIt would be avoiding potential conflicts that\nexist by naming the individual employees and having them\ngo out and retain their own counsel. It would limit the\n-- it would reduce the cost of the litigation for the\ndefendant because you're ultimately looking at the\ncorporation, and it would only have to have one set of\nattorneys as opposed to a multiple set of attorneys. So,\nthe cost to defend would go down as far as the\ncorporation.\nIf we're also operating under a claim under\nFederal law, then the rules of the game, as far as the\ndiscovery, as far as the motion practice and general\nprocedure, would also be under the Federal law as opposed\nto the State law, so that it would be easier for the\ncorporations to control their costs because they would\nknow how to be defending this type of an action.\nAnd in fact, hopefully, these types of actions\nwould be decreasing as the liability would be there.\nThere are certain programs that would be going into place\nby the companies to make certain that everybody has the\nproper training in order to avoid these types of\nconstitutional violations.\nIndeed, that's one of the reasons that we submit\nthat there would really be no danger to the public fisc.\nIn the normal situation, you have a suit against a\nGovernment employee where the Government afterwards comes\nin and it either has provided counsel and will also pay\nany judgment that exists.\nQUESTION: Mr. Lamken said that's not\nnecessarily so, that the Government would pay.\nMR. PASTERNAK: Not necessarily so, but it is\nusually the case that happens.\nSo too, you have a situation where CSC has\nacknowledged that it normally does indemnify its\nemployees. And in our situation, there's a contract that\nexists between the Bureau of Prisons, which is a Federal\nagency here, and the private for-profit corporation, CSC,\nwhich required CSC to indemnify the Bureau of Prisons.\nIn addition, it required CSC to have insurance.\nSo, before any danger could take place to the public fisc,\nthe first thing that would happen, as far as a judgment\nwhich would be rendered, is that it would be coming from\nthe insurance company.\nThe insurance company would then have to make a\ndetermination, is this something that would justify an\nincrease in premiums or can it be more properly addressed\nsolely by the implementation of special programs and\ntrainings and seminars to the individual employees?\nIf it were to increase its premiums, then the\ncorporation would have to make a determination whether or\nnot to pay it or to seek other insurance to get a better\nrate. Only if that rate is increased, then the\ncorporation would then have to turn around and say, well,\nis this a cost that we should be absorbing or to try and\npass it along to the Federal Government?\nQUESTION: All insurance companies are going to\nincrease rates if the corporation -- if they know that the\ncorporations are going to be liable.\nMR. PASTERNAK: Well, right now, respectfully --\nQUESTION: I mean, you know, they're -- they're\nnot dumb and they're competitive. If corporations are not\nliable, the rates are going to be lower. If corporations\nare liable, the rates of all the insurance companies are\ngoing to be higher. That's going to be passed on to the\nUnited States Government. I mean, you know, that has to\nbe -- that has to be the outcome.\nMR. PASTERNAK: But no one is -- respectfully,\nno one is arguing that there could not be a theory for CSC\nto be liable under common law, respondeat superior, or\nunder the ADA or any other theory for the corporation to\nbe liable. It's only a question under what theory the\ncorporation would become liable. So, that the damages, or\nthe claims against the private corporation, would still\nexist. They would still have to be defending the claims.\nThey would still ultimately, we would submit, be found\nliable for it.\nQUESTION: You can't have it both ways. You're\nnow telling me that you don't really need these cause of\naction -- causes of action because there -- there are\nother ways to get relief out there, which the insurance\ncompanies are already taking into account.\nI mean, there's either a substantial difference\nin what you're urging this Court to adopt or not. If\nthere's a substantial difference, it's going to come out\nof the Government's pocket. If there isn't a substantial\ndifference, why should -- why do we have to create a cause\nof action that does not appear in the Constitution or in a\nstatute?\nMR. PASTERNAK: If I may, I don't think that it\nnecessarily comes out of the Government, because, A, you\nhave the insurance, and B, if the rates get increased to\nthe company, then the company then has to turn around and\nbid it out to the Federal Government, and the Federal\nGovernment can turn around and go through a different\ncontractor. So, you have a different situation as far as\nthe ability to pass it along, as opposed to the Federal\nGovernment where it comes in and indemnifies the\nemployees --\nQUESTION: This other contractor that it would\npass it on to would not be subject to the same law that --\nthat we hold today?\nMR. PASTERNAK: He would be subject to the same\nlaw.\nQUESTION: And therefore, his rates would be\nhigher too, wouldn't it?\nMR. PASTERNAK: Well, we would also -- anytime\nan insurance company is setting rates, they're going to be\nlooking to the past history of the individual applicant to\nascertain what the potential is and what programs are in\nplace in order to try and control what those potential\ndangers are.\nQUESTION: Mr. Pasternak, compare for a moment,\nif you will, the elements of damages you would be seeking\nunder the kind of claim you have in mind and the elements\nof damages you might be seeking under a State -- State law\nnegligence action as -- as to amounts, amounts of money.\nAre there elements that you could recover for under the\nFederal claim that you couldn't recover for under a State\nnegligence claim?\nMR. PASTERNAK: As far as amounts, it's\ndifficult to quantify as to what it is. As far as the\nFederal claim, we would have the claim of violation of the\nFederal Constitution.\nQUESTION: Yes, but what you want as a result of\nthe claimed violation is money damages, I take it.\nMR. PASTERNAK: That is correct.\nQUESTION: And I'm -- I'm asking you would the\nmoney damages be any different under -- under a theory of\nnegligence as opposed to the theory you're proposing.\nCould some element of damages be permitted under one and\nnot under the other, or would they be the same?\nMR. PASTERNAK: I think it would depend on how a\njury viewed the elements --\nQUESTION: Well, but I -- I mean -- I realize\none jury can give you one result and one another. But\nlet's suppose it's the same jury. Or just -- just -- I\nmean, the testimony as -- as to physical suffering and\nthat sort of thing, it would be pretty much the same,\nwouldn't it?\nMR. PASTERNAK: That would be.\nQUESTION: Except you might have punitive\ndamages under State law, mightn't you, if -- if indeed it\nwas -- it was gross negligence or indeed virtually -- an\nintentional harming of -- of the prisoner? Under many\nState laws, you'd be able to get punitive damages,\nwouldn't you?\nMR. PASTERNAK: There would be a potential under\ncertain situations under State law to obtain punitive\ndamages.\nQUESTION: And you can't -- as far as I know, we\nhaven't held that punitive damages are available under\nBivens, have we?\nMR. PASTERNAK: That's correct.\nQUESTION: A State cause of action -- could --\ncould a State just incorporate the Eighth Amendment\nstandard as a matter of State tort law?\nMR. PASTERNAK: I'm sorry. I didn't --\nQUESTION: Could the State, as part of a State\ncause of action, simply incorporate the Eighth Amendment\nas part of a State tort standard? There could be no\nreckless indifference or you're -- you're liable under\nState law.\nMR. PASTERNAK: It could. The States would have\nthe power to do whatever it pleased. Each State would\nhave its own decision making.\nQUESTION: So, then you don't need the Bivens\ncause of action even for the Eighth Amendment because\nStates are free to enact it if they choose.\nMR. PASTERNAK: But that would leave to each\nindividual State to ascertain and decide whether or not\nthere should be a remedy that exists as far as a Federal\nconstitutional violation, which is a separate and distinct\nharm that needs to be addressed.\nQUESTION: Is the same thing true about other\nBivens actions?\nMR. PASTERNAK: This Court -- yes, it is. And\nthis Court has routinely held that just the fact that\nthere is a common law claim that might exist is not\nsufficient in order to find that there should not also be\nBivens liability.\nQUESTION: Well, you have no authority to say\nthat a State can create a cause of action against a\nFederal officer.\nMR. PASTERNAK: Not as to a Federal officer,\ncorrect.\nIn here, though, where we have a private\ncorporation, who is operating pursuant to its contract\nwith the Government, where it has a separate motive, a\nfiduciary duty in order to maximize its profits, and there\nthe danger to the Federal fisc is less, we submit, or\ncertainly no greater than if there were an additional\nBivens situation, we would submit that the greatest\ndeterrence that could exist is to go and permit the suit\nagainst the corporation and not impose the duty in order\nto try and ascertain which employee would it be, whether\nor not it's a former employee who set a policy who's no\nlonger there, but to permit it because it is the\ncorporation who has control of its individual employees\nbased on the relationship, whether it be for a limited\ncontract and what contract terms are or whether it be an\nat-will employee, and also based on respondeat superior,\nthat we need to recognize that we are dealing with a\nprivate corporation. We are not dealing with the FDIC or\nthe Government or a Government agency. In light of the\nfact that there's a direct relationship of contract that\nexists between the Government and the corporation, which\nis allowing it to act, that this Court should find that\nthere is Bivens liability and the case should be permitted\nto proceed on that basis.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Pasternak.\nMr. Phillips, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI'd like to address what I think are sort of two\npivotal points here.\nOne, derive -- I derive from Justice Kennedy's\nquestion asking Mr. Pasternak about the effect of the\nRichardson decision because it seems to me the Court,\nobviously, should be concerned about what its prior\nprecedents tell us about the appropriate way to proceed.\nHe concedes, too, that Richardson, a case on which he\nrelied very heavily in his brief, frankly does not provide\nhim with much comfort.\nI would have asked him, in -- in turn, the\nextent to which he derives comfort from the FDIC v. Meyer\ndecision in which this Court, it seems to me, essentially\naddressed the same issue we have here and told litigants\ngoing forward look to the private employee, look to the\nemployees as the primary source to obtain remedies and to\nobtain maximum deterrence. And once you satisfy that,\nthen you're done with the inquiry because the Court\nspecifically addressed in Meyer the -- the question of do\nyou -- do you extend Bivens to a new category of\ndefendants.\nAnd that takes me to the second point I think is\nworth keeping in mind, and that was the question that\nJustice Scalia asked, which is why don't we simply leave\nthis to Congress to resolve at the end of the day. And it\nseems to me a -- an intricate debate about questions of\nindemnification, where we don't know what the final answer\nis about who has what rights of indemnification, questions\nof respondeat superior where we don't even know specifics\nabout what -- what causes of action may or may not be\navailable, questions of the availability of punitive\ndamages, all of these questions are left on the table\ncompletely unknown at this point.\nIt seems to me, in the context of that kind of a\ncircumstance, the Court was correct in Meyer in saying\nthat we should leave these questions to Congress, and if\nCongress acts, then you can seek out the kind of\nparallelism between 1983 and a Federal cause of action, or\nif you don't, presumably Congress will have explained to\nyou why there are disparities between the various\napproaches. It seems to me that the best solution for\nthis Court is to recognize that a hands-off approach is\nthe final answer.\nQUESTION: Mr. Phillips, can I ask one quick\nquestion? Do you concede, for purpose of -- of review of\nthe case and based on your question presented, that the\ncomplaint states a cause of action?\nMR. PHILLIPS: For purposes of where the case is\nright at the moment, yes.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think on remand, obviously we\nwould fight -- if -- if the case were to go forward, we\nwould continue to fight that issue.\nQUESTION: Mr. Phillips, is it, -- is it correct\n-- and some of the questions, including my own, have\nassumed that you can't sue a Federal offer in State -- you\ncan't sue a Federal officer for a tort committed in the\ncourse of his official duties. I'm not sure that's right.\nYou can't sue him in State -- or you can sue him in State\ncourt, but it is removable to Federal court.\nMR. PHILLIPS: It's immediately removable.\nQUESTION: But there's -- there's no Federal\nprohibition against the suit, is there?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, there will be a preemption\nissue that's going to immediately arise as to whether or\nnot he's immune -- whether he's immune. And -- you know,\nif it's within the scope of his responsibilities, then\nhe'll have -- he'll have an immunity --\nQUESTION: Qualified immunity, but -- but you --\nif it's not, you -- you can sue him and -- and the only\nprohibition is, if he wants, he can remove it to Federal\ncourt.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nPhillips.\n"
