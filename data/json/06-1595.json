        "content": "(12:59 p.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Case 06-1595, Crawford v. The Metropolitan\nGovernment of Nashville and Davidson County, Tennessee.\nMr. Schnapper.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nWhen Vicky Crawford reported to city\nofficials that she had been repeatedly harassed by the\nboard's director of employee relations, her conduct was\nprotected by section 704(a) of Title VII. It is\nprotected first by the first clause of section 704(a),\nwhich is known as the opposition clause. The opposition\nclause has three elements that must be proven. Only one\nof them is at issue here. But just to set the context,\nfirst a plaintiff will have to prove that the employer\nacted with a retaliatory motive. Second, the employee's\nstatement or conduct must relate to action that was\nunlawful under Title VII. It might be something that\nhappened in the past. It might be a concern about\nsomething that might happen in the future.\nAnd third, the conduct must be in the nature\nof opposition, and that's the question in dispute in\nthis particular case.\nIt is our view that the -- it is sufficient\nto establish that element if a reasonable person would\nconclude from the employee's statement or conduct that\nthe employee disapproved of or objected to the\nemployment practice in question.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So a co-worker of your\nclient says: You know, the boss really was guilty of\nsexual harassment and the co-worker says: Gee, that's\nterrible.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Yes, yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's enough? That's\nopposition?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Yes. Yes, it is. In fact,\nthere are cases involving --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if it's just,\nsexual harassment is terrible?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: That would be covered. If\nan employee wore a button --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if there's no\nlink, there's no link to the person that the original --\nthe complainant says was engaged in that activity?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: The opposition doesn't have\nto be directed at a particular event.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about, violating the\nlaw is terrible?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: I think if there's no\nreference to Title VII that wouldn't suffice.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. But if she said that\nin response to the remark by the co-worker that she had\nbeen subjected to sexual harassment and then the remark\nwas \"Violating the law is terrible,\" that's opposition?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: I think a trier of fact\ncould conclude she was referring to what the co-worker\nhad just said.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if Mr. Jones, the\nperson, did that, that's terrible.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's actionable as\nopposition to the practices?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: It is protected. If the\nemployer comes in and fires her for having said that.\nThe case --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Schnapper --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I was going to say in part\nit seems to me that in isolation it seems harmless,\nalmost trivial, but the whole point is that the employer\ndoesn't think it is trivial. The employer uses it, by\nhypothesis, as a basis to retaliate.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Right. That's why the\nelements are important. If the employer fires a worker\nfor that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that doesn't solve the\nproblem of having too broad an entry into this thing.\nYou get to the jury by just showing that she said \"Oh,\nif he did that, it's terrible,\" and then it's up to the\njury all of a sudden whether that is the reason that the\nemployer fired this person or not. I mean, that just\nleaves -- lays the employer open to a lot of jury\ndeterminations that he shouldn't be subject to, it seems\nto me.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: With all deference, Your\nHonor, the plaintiff must have sufficient evidence to\nget to the jury on all three elements. Retaliation\nclaims are routinely dismissed on the causation element.\nThere's not usually a dispute about whether the conduct\nwas protected, and this case in that regard is unusual.\nBut the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do you believe, as I\nunderstood you to suggest a moment ago, that you could\nprove causation if the statement \"It is terrible\" or\n\"Sexual harassment is terrible\" had been uttered in\neffect in the abstract without reference to particular\nbehavior or a charge of particular behavior on the part\nof a co-worker or an employer? In other words, if A\nsays \"Sexual harassment is terrible\" and elsewhere in\nthe company sexual harassment is going on and A is then\nfired, would it be your view that A would at least state\na claim if A said, I had expressed disapproval of sexual\nharassment, it turns out there was sexual harassment\nbeing gone -- taking place elsewhere; and I was fired\nfor that reason. Would that at least state a claim that\nwould get a harassment case into court?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Up --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What I'm getting at,\ndoesn't the statement \"It's terrible\" or whatever the\nopposition may be have to be made in relation to some\nspecific activity?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: No, Your Honor. No, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then what is the limit? It\nseems to me you've got a cause of action in effect under\nthe statute that would be virtually unlimited. Anybody\nwho thinks sexual harassment is bad and later gets fired\ncan claim retaliation under the statute if it turns out\njust as a matter of good luck that somebody was being\nsexually harassed unbeknownst to the speaker.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: That's at least two\nquestions. Let me try to answer them both. With regard\nto what would constitute protected activity, it is our\nview -- and I think this is consistent with the lower\ncourts and the view of the government -- that there\ndoesn't have to actually be a violation. If a worker\nwalks into the office with a button saying \"Violations\nof Title VII are bad and I'm against them,\" she can\nbe -- and fired for that, that's illegal even though\nnothing was going wrong.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But why are we -- why are\nwe spending so much time on hypotheticals that are so\nfar from this case? This was a person who appeared at\nan internal proceeding, she gave testimony, very\nspecific testimony. She wasn't saying: I'm against\nharassment. She said: This boss harassed me. It is\nabout as specific as you get. So we're dealing with a\nparticular case of somebody who was a witness in an\ninternal investigation. Why do we have to reach the\nouter boundaries of this claim in this case?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: You do not, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but, you know,\nthat's why we ask hypotheticals that aren't related to\nthe specific facts, because we're interested in how\nbroadly the proposition you're asking for goes. I'd\nstill like to find out where you draw the limit. What\nif the person says: Mr. Jones would never do anything\nlike that, but if he did that would be terrible. Now,\nis that actionable as opposition?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Yes. Expressing\ndisagreement with conduct that violates the law is what\nthe opposition clause protects. It doesn't have to be\nabout a specific instance, although it emphatically is\nso here. It doesn't have to reference the statute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And there does not have to\nhave been sexual harassment in the employment unit.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: That's right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So this is a law directed\nagainst expressive activity.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Yes. Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are those laws good? I\nthought we had a First Amendment.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: No, no. It is a law that\nprotect expressive activity and those laws are\nexcellent. It protects the activity.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if the employee just\nmade -- reports factual information: Supervisor did\nsuch and such; doesn't express opposition to it. Or\nwhat if the employee goes further and says: Supervisor\ndid such and such, but I know he was just kidding; or I\nhope you don't take any action against that person.\nWould that be opposition?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Not necessarily. Again, it\ndepends on the question that was asked and the answer\nthat was given. If I might, for example, in this case\nthe question was did Mr. Hughes engage in inappropriate\nactivity. That was a request -- I think a trier of fact\ncould understand that that was a request for a\ndescription of something that the witness objected to.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Let me ask this. Suppose\nthe employer conducts an investigation because it\nbelieves that the supervisor has engaged in improper\nactivity. So what they are trying to do is substantiate\ngrounds for dismissal or some other sanction. And then\nan employee provides information that's exculpatory.\nCan -- is that protected? Is that -- is that\ninformation protected.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: It's our view that that is\nnot protected by the opposition clause. It is our view\nit would be protected by the participation clause.\nIf I might get back to the question --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't it strange when there\nare many situations in which testimony or the reporting\nof information is protected, but when it's done, isn't\nit usually done both ways, as it is under the\nparticipation clause? So that the testimony is --\ncannot be the subject of retaliation or the reporting of\ninformation cannot be the subject of retaliation, but\nnot it's protected only if it goes in one direction?\nIsn't that a very odd approach to that situation?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: That's why we're advancing\nthe view that the participation clause here provides as\nwell, so that it's clear that exculpatory witnesses are\nprotected. It is not unimaginable that an exculpatory\nwitness would anger someone.\nBut going back to the question you asked\nearlier, it's possible that in response to a question an\nanswer might be given which a reasonable person would\nnot conclude reflected disapproval such as, well, he\ntold that joke, and I thought it was funny.\nAnd, indeed, in the Harris v. Forklift case\nthere were witnesses like that who -- who confirmed that\nthe owner of Harris Forklift had made the jokes in\nquestion but said they didn't mind. That that would not\nbe our position at --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Wouldn't that be very\nstrange? Suppose that this -- the factual situation\nactually is very severe and is enough to -- to establish\nliability on the employer's part, but this particular\nreporting employee doesn't think so. So then the\nemployer might well be very annoyed that this\ninformation which can be the -- the basis for liability\nhas been brought out against the employer, and the\nemployer might want to retaliate.\nWhy would that be unprotected just because\nthis employee adds his or her opinion that it isn't\nserious?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: We think it is protected by\nthe participation clause.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why don't you follow what\nthe EEOC says? I mean, the EEOC, as I understand it,\nhas said the very fact the employer has initiated an\ninvestigation of an alleged discrimination is sufficient\nto demonstrate the reasonableness of the employee's\nbelief that by providing information relevant to the\ninquiry she is opposing an employment practice made\nunlawful by Title VII.\nAnd then they go on. To be absolutely clear\nabout it, they say an employee who assists her or her\nemployer in the endeavor, i.e., you go and testify; so\nthe sun was shining on that day; you are assisting your\nemployee by telling the truth-- is by definition -- is\nopposing practices made unlawful by Title VII.\nSo here we have a difficult question, quite\nan interstitial question, defining precisely \"opposing,\"\nand here we have the EEOC doing it. So why don't we\njust follow what they say?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Well, I -- that would --\nthat would certainly be fine with us.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It wouldn't be fine with\nme.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: We get to the same place --\nwe get to the same place by a different route.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what if I am\nindeed very much in favor of sexual harassment? I am a\nworld class sexual harasser, but I'm also not a liar,\nand I'm -- I am subpoenaed or called up by the employer\nin connection with this internal investigation and asked\nwhether so-and-so harassed a particular worker. And I'd\nsay, yes, as a matter of fact, he did, and a good thing\ntoo.\nIs that expressing opposition?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: No. We believe it is\ncovered by the participation clause. We think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Covered by the\nparticipation clause?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Because our view is that the\nemployer's internal processes for detecting and rooting\nout sexual harassment, for example, is a -- is a process\n-- is a process that's under this title within the\nmeaning of --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is this a real problem? I\nmean, let's suppose the opposition clause protects\neverybody in the internal investigation who could be at\nall interpreted as favorable to the complainant. It\nalso protects everybody who could possibly be viewed as\nneutral.\nThen you have a problem about what about a\nperson who loves sexual harassment? This is the\nhypothetical: he comes in, testifies: I love sexual\nharassment; it's wonderful, and they fire him. Now is\nthis a real problem?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: It -- it is not, Your Honor.\nBut -- but as the -- as the Chief Justice pointed out,\nI'm -- you know, I'm here to answer hypothetical\nquestions, and I'm going to do so.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought that --\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought that the --\nreal case -- the real case that we're dealing with is\nsomebody who appeared in an internal investigation, and\nI thought that what was the debate between the two\nsides; anyone who made a charge, testified, assisted, or\nparticipated in any manner in the investigation, I\nthought that the other side's position was, well, this\nis not an \"investigation\" within the meaning of the\nstatute. That what goes on internally doesn't qualify.\n\"Investigation,\" \"proceeding,\" or \"hearing\"\nunder Title VII requires first that there be a Title VII\ncharge. I thought that that's what the controversy\nwe're talking about today is about: Is this a\nqualifying investigation?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Your Honor, there actually\nare two distinct questions here. One of them is whether\nthe conduct is protected by the opposition clause and\nwhether it constitutes opposition.\nThe second question is whether this conduct\nis protected by the participation clause and would be an\ninvestigation under Title VII. We are asserting\narguments under both claims, and -- and the Respondents\ndisagree with us on both.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And those are\noverlapping but not whatever it -- concurring --\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Redundant.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- positions. You\ncan oppose without participating. You can participate\nwithout opposing.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Right. Right. This case is\nboth. But -- but there are circumstances which are only\none or the other.\nAnd this is -- this is a statute that --\nthat is deliberately written with overlapping provisions\nto be sure nothing is missed.\nIn the phrase in the Fort Stewart case, I\nthink, Justice Scalia, it is ex abundante cotilla, out\nof an abundance of caution, or in modern terms boots --\nbelt and suspenders. So these are deliberately\noverlapping provisions to -- to assure that --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What is the test for\ndetermining whether an investigation has been done, and\nthe person has testified? What degree of formality, if\nanything, is necessary?\nIf -- if somebody in -- in the company\nsimply goes to the office of an employee or the\nworkplace of an employee or encounters the employee in\nthe hallway or someplace and asks a question, is that\nenough? Does it have to be --\nMR. SCHNAPPER: No.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- a sort of a formal\nproceeding in -- in some sense?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: It -- it -- in our view, it\ndoesn't have to be formal, but there are two essential\nelements to an investigation or a proceeding or anything\nother internal being under this title. The first is\nthat the employer must have a rule or policy forbidding\nthe type of discrimination in question which is similar\nto the requirements in section 706(c) for State and\nlocal agencies.\nSecond, the individual -- the official who\ndid whatever you describe has to have been specifically\nauthorized by the employer to play that role. Vicarious\nhere wouldn't cover it.\nIf I could reserve the balance.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Blatt.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court.\nWe think this case is best resolved under\nthe opposition clause, and that clause does not require\nemployees to utter magic words of opposition or to\ninitiate the interview in which they express opposition\nto unlawful conduct. Rather, the clause is satisfied\nwhen a reasonable person would understand that the\nemployee has objected to sexual harassment in the\nworkplace.\nAnd when an employee discloses or reports\nthat she has been subject to unlawful sexual harassment,\na reasonable person could certainly infer that the\nemployee opposes a practice made unlawful by the\nstatute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In that case,\ndoesn't the opposing employee herself have a direct\ncause of action under Title VII? Given what\nMs. Crawford described, you know, \"that happened to me,\ntoo,\" she could proceed under Title VII herself.\nMS. BLATT: Right. She has got timing\nrequirements. So if she hasn't complained to the EEOC\nwithin the relevant time, she wouldn't have a cause of\naction for discrimination. But once she has\nretaliated -- an adverse action is taken against her\nbecause of what she has reported, then she has timing\nrequirements on when she has to sue for the retaliation,\nand she did that here.\nAnd this is a case where the Sixth Circuit\ntossed the case out on summary judgment, and it erred in\ndoing so because the facts alleged in this case were\nmore than ample to survive summary judgment on the\nquestion of whether she opposed what the Director of\nEmployee Relations did to her.\nShe alleged that in the context of a sexual\nharassment investigation in which she was asked to\ndisclose inappropriate behavior by the director, she\nreported repeated instances of offensive, objectionable,\nand unwelcome conduct by him. For instance, she said\nthat she had her head pulled into his lap and that in\nresponse she threw him out of the office, thereby\nindicating that she did not like this conduct.\nThe jury could easily infer from those facts\nthat she opposed the director's conduct. Now, that\ntiming would --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would you go as far\nas Mr. Schnapper in determining what constitutes\n\"opposition\"? I mean, do you agree with him that a case\nwhere somebody says, \"oh, Mr. Jones would never do that,\nand if he did, I think that would be awful\" -- is that\n\"opposition\"?\nMS. BLATT: If you -- yes, if a reasonable\nperson could infer that. I think that we are similar.\nBut if you just are a reporter of unlawful\nconduct, that's enough. But this case is easier, much\neasier. She was a victim.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, yes, I know,\nbut -- I know, but --\nMS. BLATT: I understand that. And if --\nyou can either decide the broader question or the\nquestion of the Petitioner here, which she reported that\nshe was subject, and it makes it all the more evident,\nand certainly a jury could have found that she opposed\nthe conduct.\nBut we do think that at least a reasonable\ninference could be drawn -- when you report facts that\nwould constitute unlawful activity, the reasonable\ninference is that you have objected.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Facts that would\nconstitute unlawful activity. What about facts that --\nI mean, many of these cases, of course, are\nhe-said/she-said cases, and what about the facts that\nyou are reporting confirm one side or the other? They\njust ask you, look -- and, you know, the person says,\n\"Well, every day at three o'clock he came in and do\nthis,\" and you're outside. And he says, \"No, I wasn't\nthere.\"\nMS. BLATT: Right. If you just have a --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you opposing it\nif you say -- you know, you are asked, \"Well, you know,\nyou sit outside the office; did he come in there or\nnot?\" And you say, \"Yes, he did.\"\nMS. BLATT: I think this is where we have\nnot embraced the position of the EEOC, that we don't\nthink that expresses opposition if all you do is say,\n\"here's what a person's job duties were and he was in\ntown on that day\" or \"I had lunch with him on that day,\"\nand that would verify -- it may verify a victim's\nstatement or corroborate it and thereby be the essential\nevidence in the case, but it wouldn't come within the\nstatutory language of opposing.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even you knew that\nthat was the critical fact in resolving the complaint?\nMS. BLATT: If a reasonable -- well, if a\nreasonable person knew from all the circumstances, then\nmaybe. If this -- unfortunately, if you don't like jury\ntrials, this is a jury question whether you oppose the\npractice or not, and it would have to go to a jury based\non the totality of the evidence.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, since this is a case\nwhere the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that the\nparticipation clause is the line of least resistance. I\nunderstand we have to say what a hearing is and so\nforth. Are you asking us to resolve on the opposition\nclause because that will give more guidance to the\nsystem or --\nMS. BLATT: No. When you said \"least\nresistance,\" it certainly is the most sweeping and broad\ncoverage. In that sense, you cover all witnesses and\nparticipants in the process, and we think Congress\nintended to do so here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The opposition\nclause is?\nMS. BLATT: The participation clause is much\nbroader coverage. It could -- it would cover anyone who\nparticipates in the investigation, whether or not they\noppose the practice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it depends how\nyou define the investigation --\nMS. BLATT: Opposition.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the inquiry, and\nthat's kind of a tough issue, it seems to me.\nMS. BLATT: If this were before the EEOC,\neverybody who testifies in that proceeding or\nparticipates in the investigation would be covered. It\ndoesn't matter whether you oppose a practice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMS. BLATT: So in that sense, it's broader.\nThe reason why this case is easier for you, under the\nopposition clause, is it's a narrow holding and it\ndoesn't get you into the question of whether just an\nemployer investigation is an investigation --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess the\nquestion I was asking earlier, you have overlapping but\nnot concentric categories, so the \"opposing\" may be\nbroader than the \"participating in\" depending upon how\nwe define either one.\nMS. BLATT: That's exactly right, but at a\nminimum when you have a victim of sexual harassment who\nreports it to her employer in the context of an\ninvestigation where she's asked was there anything\ninappropriate and she recounts here, it's so clearly\nopposition. It so clearly should not have been thrown\nout on summary judgment. And it so clearly can force --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You think -- you think the\nconduct in this case is also covered by the\nparticipation clause?\nMS. BLATT: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You do?\nMS. BLATT: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The problem with that is\nthat I -- while I have the EEOC with me, say, on --\nassuming your thing -- on, from what I read, on the\nopposition clause, when I looked into what the EEOC\nactually said here on the participation clause, I don't\nthink I can characterize it, except for their litigation\nposition.\nMS. BLATT: But that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I can't characterize what\nthey've said in their compliance manual as being with\nyou on that.\nMS. BLATT: That's correct. We don't and\nneither does the EEOC interpret their compliance manual\nas --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And they could easily\nchange it. They could easily change it.\nMS. BLATT: Yes, it is true that it's in a\nbrief, it's on their Website, it's on home page, on\ntheir Website.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. It's not in their\nmanual.\nMS. BLATT: It's not in their compliance\nmanual; it's in our amicus brief, but it is the EEOC's\nposition. And, again, that's why I think it's an easier\ncase for you under the opposition clause.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Can you think of any other\nsituation in which the law says that a person who\ntestifies or provides information is protected against\nretaliation only if that person gives testimony of a\nparticular type or gives a statement of a particular\ntype?\nMS. BLATT: No, but you have to remember\nthere are two separate clauses. The statute under the\nopposition clause just says \"oppose a practice made\nunlawful.\" If you didn't oppose a practice, you're not\ncovered under that. You would be covered under -- in\nthe proceeding, why there is such broad coverage. Once\nyou're under the participation clause, no matter what\nthe substance of your testimony is, it's covered. It\nprotects the process itself, regardless of whether it\nwas -- it was determined true.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I understand that, but\nI'm -- what I'm asking is, is the reason to doubt\nwhether Congress intended in the opposition clause to\nprovide protection only for people who testify or\nprovide information that goes in a particular direction?\nMS. BLATT: I think --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If the purpose is to -- is\nto elicit information and protect the people who come\nforward with the information, then why don't you provide\nthe protection irrespective of what the person says?\nMS. BLATT: I think that position is\nconsistent with the EEOC, and I don't think we would\noppose that position in the sense that it would give the\ngreatest and broadest protection.\nAnd what is so upsetting about this case is\nthe gaping hole in statutory coverage that the Sixth\nCircuit left. It is an inexplicable gap that a\ncomplaining witness in an employer investigation would\nbe unprotected from retaliation. The statute simply\ncan't function, as intended by Congress, as intended by\nthis Court, if there are all these incentives for\nemployees to investigate unlawful activity, witnesses\ncome forward and report that they, in fact, have been\nsubjected to sexual harassment, and employers are free\nto retaliate. They --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I think that's a very\nstrong argument for the participation clause.\nMS. BLATT: It is. It is, but it's all the\nmore reason that she has to be covered under one of them\nif not both of them. Witnesses simply are going to be\nafraid to fully cooperate if they're not given\nprotection.\nAnd if there are no questions, we'd ask that\nthe Sixth Circuit be --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the other side\nsays this is not an investigation. There was no charge\nfiled. She's filed no charge. So this is not a\nqualifying investigation. What is the government's\nposition on that?\nMS. BLATT: Well, I mean, we think that is\nborder-line absurd, although all courts that have\nreached the issue have held that. And it just -- it\nmakes no sense, and it -- I'm not even --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Have\nheld what?\nMS. BLATT: Have held that -- that the\ninternal investigation is covered as long as somebody\nhas filed a charge. It's not clear who or that it has\nto be related to the subject matter. And that would\nmean if the investigation is conducted on the day a\ncharge is filed at noon, all the witnesses who came in,\nin the morning, are unprotected; yet all the witnesses\nwho came in, in the afternoon, would be protected. Yet\nnobody even knows that a charge has been filed. And\nthat's just not something that Congress possibly could\nhave intended and wanted to leave the morning witnesses\nunprotected from retaliation.\nSo I don't think the current state of the\nlaw under the participation clause is supported by the\ntext, and it's certainly not supported by any policy\nunder Title VII.\nNo questions?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Young.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANCIS H. YOUNG\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. YOUNG: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nTitle VII was the result of a congressional\ncompromise which struck a balance between protecting the\ninterests of employees and employers.\nIn relation to the anti-retaliation\nprovisions of section 704, that balance was struck to\nprotect the rights of employees to report allegedly\ndiscriminatory activity, as well as employers' rights to\nmanage their workplaces. The participation clause\ncovers activity or conduct in the course of an\ninvestigation, proceeding, or hearing under Title VII.\nThe opposition clause -- the actual words of\nthe opposition clause protect an employee who has\nopposed a particular unlawful practice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what more\ncould Ms. Crawford do to make it clear that she opposes\nwhat was alleged in this case?\nMR. YOUNG: She could have -- she could have\ninitiated making contact with the government official to\nregister a complaint or an objection.\nInstead, she made a disclosure or she\ncooperated in the investigation, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how can the\nfact that what led to the statement change the\ncharacterization of the statement? She can initiate it,\ngo in and say, \"I oppose what's going on,\" or if\nsomebody just asks her, you know, \"how do you feel about\nwhat's going on,\" she says she opposes it. It seems to\nme in either case you look at the statement and not what\nled to the statement.\nMR. YOUNG: Congress chose to use the word\n\"oppose,\" Your Honor. That's why the short --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's why my\nhypothetical uses the word \"oppose.\" In the first case,\nshe goes in of own volition and says, \"I oppose\"; in the\nsecond case, she says \"I oppose\" in response to a\nquestion. Congress used the word \"oppose,\" and my\nhypothetical in both cases used the word \"oppose.\"\nMR. YOUNG: If she's not taking the\ninitiative, then she has to report it and request that\nsomething be done about it. Does the word -- if she\nuses the word \"oppose,\" as in your hypothetical, that\nwould not be the facts of this case, but that would\nprobably nudge it to the line of opposition conduct\nbecause she's using the word \"oppose.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. Well, is it\nreal a magic word? She comes in and says, \"you won't\nbelieve\" -- you know -- \"you think that's bad, wait till\nI tell you what he did to me,\" and goes on tells -- it's\nquite obvious from the context that she opposes it.\nMR. YOUNG: Well, that's why we advocate a\nreasonableness standard, Your Honor, in the ears of the\nperson receiving the information, but under the facts of\nthis case, that standard was not met.\nThe true opposition activity -- it's called\nthe opposition clause, not the disclosure clause, not\nthe cooperation clause. There's an element -- and all\nthe parties have provided the Court with a dictionary --\nthe various dictionary definitions of the word \"oppose,\"\nall of which contain the common theme of resistance,\ncoming up against something, communicating resistance.\nWhen the -- when what Mrs. Crawford said to\nthe human resources investigator in response to\nquestioning is actually examined, it is making a\ndisclosure. There's no request that anything be done\nabout it. The time lag between the end of the alleged\nharassment and the actual reporting is over two months.\nMrs. Crawford had multiple opportunities to report to\nher supervisor, her supervisor's supervisor, the\ndirector of employee --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You mean if she had made\ncomplaints after she had answered the questions in --\nand given the information at issue here, that would\nconvert her prior statements into opposition?\nMR. YOUNG: That would -- the fact that Your\nHonor chose the term \"complaint\" would be a different\nsituation from what we had here. A subsequent --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm asking you. You're in\neffect saying there has got to be some kind of what you\ncall active opposition; and I took it from what you said\na moment ago that if she had given the evidence in\nquestion here, and then in the period, subsequent period\nof two months, made some sort of complaint, that that\ncomplaint would have qualified her original evidence as\nopposition.\nIs that your position?\nMR. YOUNG: That complaint would undoubtedly\nbe opposition. Would it reach back --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You're taking about --\nMR. YOUNG: Would it retroactively imbue the\ninitial disclosure with an opposition quality? Yes.\nYes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It would? Why? It doesn't\nseem so to me. I mean, it either was or wasn't. You're\nmaking the argument, essentially, that \"oppose\" has two\nquite different meanings. You can ask somebody, you\nknow, do you oppose the war in Iraq? And all you're\nasking is what is your opinion of the war in Iraq. Do\nyou think it is good or bad?\nBut \"oppose\" is also used in a quite\ndifferent sense. He -- you say somebody opposed the war\nin Iraq, you mean he went out and -- and paraded against\nit and so forth.\nAnd your assertion is that in this\nlegislation, it has the latter meaning. It just doesn't\nask for your opinion about whether sexual harassment is\ngood or bad. It asks whether you were actively --\nactively opposing it.\nNow, once you adopt that position, I don't\nsee how the fact that you -- that something that was not\nactive opposition can be converted into active\nopposition by something that occurred later.\nI mean, if you want to abandon your other\nargument, that's fine with me, but --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. YOUNG: Your Honor, I'm uncomfortable\nwith the concept that subsequent -- a subsequent\ncomplaint can imbue a prior statement with that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would that uncomfortable?\nSay it doesn't. I mean, I -- I don't care if you're\nuncomfortable with it. Does it or doesn't it?\nMR. YOUNG: Perhaps yes. But if it does --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Then I don't understand\nyour case.\nMR. YOUNG: Well, Your Honor, I -- I don't\nsee that distinction as being relevant. Because if --\nif a subsequent complaint is made a month, two months\nafter the initial disclosing conduct, then we're -- then\nwe're traveling on that subsequent complaint.\nAnd the fact that a disclosure was made a\nmonth or two prior doesn't become a relevant watershed\ndate in terms of when the protections of the statute\narise.\nThe -- the -- the concept is something more\nthan disclosure, something more than mere cooperation.\nThe language of the statute is he or she has opposed a\nspecific practice, not just opposition to the war in\nIraq in general; not just opposition to sexual\nharassment in general; but that a specific --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It isn't just a specific --\nagain, if I don't understand your case, it isn't just a\nmatter of the specific practice.\nYour point is it is not asking your opinion.\nIt is asking whether you are actively trying to\neliminate it.\nI think even if -- if you were asked your\nopinion, you know, do you -- do you oppose what, you\nknow, what this supervisor did? And -- and you said\nyes, I don't favor it, I think it's bad, I think it's a\nbad idea, I -- as I understand your case, that's not\nopposition.\nMR. YOUNG: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And I don't see how that is\nchanged at all when you put it in the context of a\nspecific act of harassment as opposed to putting it in\nthe context of harassment in general.\nYou -- you -- if you're hiding behind the --\nthe defenses you've built up, it seems to me those\ndefenses require something more than an expression of\nyour opinion of whether it's good or bad.\nYour opinion is whether it's good or bad is\nnot opposition.\nMR. YOUNG: I agree with that, Your Honor.\nI used the term \"practice\" inartfully. Our argument is\nthere is a specific act that the employee considers to\nbe unlawful, and that's what the employee is opposing.\nSo that is what needs to be communicated to a reasonable\nperson within the government or within --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If the -- if the employee\nin response to the inquiry that's being made says yes, I\nsaw my employer do \"X\" and it happened -- and I think\nit's terrible, that is certainly specific to the act.\nMR. YOUNG: It's specific to the act, Your\nHonor, but I -- I would argue that does not cross the\nline into \"and I oppose it.\"\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the reason -- but the\nreason it doesn't cross the line is you are, in effect,\nsaying that \"oppose\" within the meaning of the statute\nhas got to be read more narrowly than the -- than the\nnotion of oppose as we commonly use that word in common\nspeech.\nAnd I don't know why -- I don't know what\nyour -- what your authority is for saying that \"oppose\"\nwas not used in its commonsense everyday connotation.\nMR. YOUNG: Well, I think the word \"oppose\"\ncan be used in a specific sense in common everyday\nspeech and can be used in a general sense, Your Honor.\nAnd I think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But in my hypothetical,\nwe're not talking about a general sense. In my\nhypothetical we were talking about a reference to a very\nspecific act. So the generality problem doesn't arise.\nAnd yet despite the specificity, you say, and despite\nthe fact that in common speech a -- a specific statement\nlike that would be taken as opposition, you say it\nshouldn't be under the statute.\nAnd the statute doesn't have any definition\nthat narrows it. Common speech wouldn't narrow it your\nway.\nWhy should it be narrowed your way?\nMR. YOUNG: The -- Your Honor's hypothetical\nof saying something is terrible would -- would -- would\nnot be commonly understood to communicate opposition\nto --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Young, even under your\ndefinition, why is not the statement that's made in this\ncase, \"get the hell out of my office,\" wouldn't that be\nopposition even under your statement, under your\ndefinition? She's opposing his advance to her. That's\nan active opposition it seems.\nMR. YOUNG: Her statement to him to get out\nof my office would --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Get the hell out of my\noffice.\nMR. YOUNG: Yes, Your Honor.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why isn't that opposition\nunder your statement -- under your definition?\nMR. YOUNG: Well, the -- because the -- in\nthe context of anti-retaliation provisions, making a\nstatement to an alleged harasser to stop the harassment\nor get out of my office does not rise to opposition\nconduct, because the -- the -- the essence of the\nopposition clause is somehow putting the employer on\nnotice.\nIf every employee who was a victim of sexual\nharassment and says stop, if that -- if that constitutes\nopposition conduct under the retaliation clause,\nsuddenly that employee has two causes of action, one for\nsexual harassment and one for retaliation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that isn't even --\nlook, the best way to oppose a crime is to cooperate\nwith the police when they investigate individual\ninstances.\nThe best way to oppose sexual discrimination\nin the workplace is to cooperate with the employer when,\nin fact, he investigates individual instances.\nIs what I've just said English? Does it\nmake sense? And indeed, I'm just quoting the EEOC's own\ndefinition.\nMR. YOUNG: Yes, it was in English. Yes, it\nmakes sense, Your Honor, but I would beg to differ,\nrespectfully. The best way to oppose sexual harassment\nis to go and make a complaint about it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It is your opinion. The\nEEOC's opinion is, as they state, the best way to oppose\nis to cooperate.\nNow, what are we to do with, at\nleast ambiguity, giving you that, I'll give you\nambiguity. But we have the agency charged with the\nenforcement of this taking the side of it that is the\nopposite side that you are taking.\nMR. YOUNG: Yes, Your Honor. There is --\nthere are enough contradictory statements in the\ncompliance manual itself that any deference that this\nCourt is inclined to give to the EEOC's compliance\nmanual should be tempered by the fact that even the EEOC\nrecognizes the importance of employees taking initiative\nto report harassment and not --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Please\nfinish your answer.\nMR. YOUNG: -- and not sitting back and\nwaiting for the investigation to come to them.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The investigation is not\nof her. She's testifying as a witness.\nMR. YOUNG: She's offering a statement in an\ninterview, Your Honor, as a witness, yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And this is an act that's\nmeant to protect people against discrimination in the\nworkplace, including harassment.\nMR. YOUNG: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This is a woman who\ntestified truthfully -- we have to assume that because\nthis was tossed out at the very threshold, so we have to\nassume that everything she alleged in her complaint is\ntrue, right?\nMR. YOUNG: It is not up -- it is not before\nthis Court on a Rule 12 standard of assuming all the\nallegations are true, Your Honor; but it comes to the\nCourt on summary judgment.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There is no -- no dis --\nthen there has to be no genuine dispute as to any\nmaterial fact. That means we must take her allegations\nof fact as true at this point.\nBut in any case this is a statute that's\nmeant to govern the workplace with all of its realities.\nOne of them was when they asked, well, why\ndidn't you make a complaint, use whatever internal\nremedies are there are? She said, because the person in\nthis outfit who is charged with receiving complaints is\nthe harasser.\nMR. YOUNG: That isn't -- that was her\ncontention. That's not necessarily true.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But we have to --\neverything -- for you to prevail, since there has been\nno trial on the facts, we have to take the facts as she\nalleges them.\nMR. YOUNG: There are multiple places to\nreport sexual harassment, Your Honor. She -- she didn't\neven report it to her boss. She didn't report it to her\nboss's boss, and she didn't report it to the Director of\nHuman Resources.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I suppose your point\nwould be it doesn't matter what the reason was that she\ndidn't report it. In order to recover here she has to\nhave taken a public stand; and whatever the reason why\nshe didn't, the fact is that she didn't.\nWhy do you get into, you know, the reason\nthat she didn't?\nMR. YOUNG: I agree with you, Your Honor.\nThe reasons why she didn't make a report are immaterial.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and I suppose that\nyou -- you would require the -- the opposition to be\nsomehow a public -- a public expression of opposition.\nNo?\nMR. YOUNG: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, if one political\ncandidate says that the other one opposed the war in\nIraq, do you think the other candidate could say, that's\na lie? I'm sorry, that the charge would be held to be\ncorrect if, in fact, the other candidate had never said\nanything about the war in Iraq, although deep in his\nheart he thought it was probably a bad idea.\nWould you say that he opposed the war in\nIraq? I don't think so.\nMR. YOUNG: Your Honor, even when --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The implication is --\nMR. YOUNG: Even when --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The implication is that he\ncame out with some public position opposing it, and\nthat's your position as to the meaning of --\nMR. YOUNG: Yes, Your Honor. And even the\nEEOC in its own compliance manual as set forth on page\n38 of the red brief, the examples of opposition cited by\nthe EEOC are threatening to file a charge, complaining,\nprotesting, picketing. These are active verbs.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why wouldn't this fall\nwithin the participation clause? There was an\ninvestigation, and -- and you described the people who\nprovided information as \"witnesses.\"\nMR. YOUNG: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So why doesn't it fall under\nthe participation clause?\nMR. YOUNG: An -- an employer's internal\nsexual harassment investigation is not an investigation\nunder this title.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Never, even after -- even\nafter a charge has been filed with the EEOC?\nMR. YOUNG: Well, the five circuits that\nhave squarely considered the issue have held that that's\nthe trigger that brings the internal investigation under\nthe rubric of the participation clause here, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And what's your argument?\nMR. YOUNG: I'll -- I'll take that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And how about taking our\ndecisions in the Faragher and Ellerth case which in a\nsense made the employer's internal investigation part of\nthe EEO process because it says to the employer, if you\ndon't have that find of effective internal complaint and\ninvestigation procedure, then you're going to be stuck\non respondeat superior liability. If you do, then you\nwill be shielded.\nSo this Court's decision in those two cases\nseemed to me to say to every employer, as part of your\nEEO compliance you had better have this internal\ncomplaint procedure and investigation.\nMR. YOUNG: I agree. Faragher and Ellerth\nput the carrot on the stick in front of the employers\nand say, here's an affirmative defense that will be\navailable to you in certain harassment cases if you\nadopt a -- an anti-harassment policy which includes an\ninvestigation mechanism. However, such a policy and\nsuch a mechanism is not made mandatory by Faragher and\nEllerth. The argument of --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you say it's not made\nmandatory. Any employer who doesn't go through it is\ncrazy. And I don't see how this Court, having imposed\nin practical terms the requirement that Justice Ginsburg\njust described, can then say, oh, but we're going to\nconstrue this indefinite term of \"investigation\"\nto exclude this kind of employer activity which our\nconstruction of the statute has virtually mandated.\nSo that if in fact the employer's\ninvestigation succeeds in ending the problem and there\nis no EEOC complaint, those who participated in the\ninvestigation are absolutely helpless against\nretaliation. That would be a bizarre way to interpret a\n-- a statute in which we have any -- any opportunity to\ninterpret \"investigation\" to include this kind of\ninvestigation.\nWhat do you say to that?\nMR. YOUNG: The fact that Faragher and\nEllerth create an incentive to employers to develop\nthese policies with investigate -- which include\ninvestigations, does not elevate such investigations to\nfall under the statutory requirement of being --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. But I'm -- I'm giving\nyou an argument as to why we should construe it to\nelevate it, and -- and the argument is that we, in\neffect, in what I think were correct decisions -- you\nagree, you said a moment ago, were correct decisions --\nhave in practical terms mandated this kind of an\ninquiry.\nWhy then would it be reasonable for us, if\nwe have any option in construing the term\n\"investigation,\" to construe it to exclude this kind of\ninvestigation and exclude coverage of the people who\nunder our decisions are supposed to come forward and --\nand answer questions? Why would that be a reasonable\nconstruction?\nMR. YOUNG: Because at some point, Your\nHonor, the construction departs so far from what can\nreasonably be supported by the language of the statute\nitself that it --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, why isn't it -- why\nisn't an investigation by the employer an\n\"investigation\"? That's the language of the statute.\nMR. YOUNG: It -- it is an \"investigation.\"\nOur contention is it does not fall under the category of\nan \"investigation\" under this title even despite\nFaragher and Ellerth.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought Faragher\nand Ellerth --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why couldn't he -- I'm\nsorry, Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought Faragher\nand Ellerth were limited to the hostile work environment\ncases.\nMR. YOUNG: Of supervisory harassment,\nthat's true, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well -- well, that's\na different question. Is the defense we recognized in\nEllerth and Faragher in the hostile work environment\ncase or in the specific action case as well?\nMR. YOUNG: My understanding of Faragher and\nEllerth is that it -- it applies in the hostile work\nenvironment case involving harassment by a supervisor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you were going to\nanswer Justice Souter with the assertion that if indeed\nthe Court wants employers to conduct these\ninvestigations, it does not want to reduce the incentive\nto do so.\nAnd the rule that is urged by the other side\nmeans whenever the -- whenever the employer conducts\nsuch an investigation, any employee who is smart enough\nto come in and testify against -- against sexual\nharassment has a guaranteed job. It is almost like --\nalmost like being a Federal judge.\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You can't be fired after\nthat, or the employer can't fire her without opening\nhimself up to a lawsuit under -- under this provision.\nAnd he might win the lawsuit, but it's going to cost\nmoney. So why -- maybe an employer would rather say,\nyou know, I'd rather roll the dice and -- and not\nconduct an investigation and insulate all of my hostile\nemployees from -- from employment actions.\nMR. YOUNG: That would be the -- that would\nbe the employer's interest. The disincentive that the\nemployers would have to comply with these -- with this\nCourt's directives or strong suggestions in Faragher and\nEllerth is employers would stop conducting these\ninvestigations if everyone they interviewed was going to\nbe a potential retaliation claim.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And instead they would\nsubstitute the -- the response to an EEOC investigation\nin which they would not have the leg to stand on in\nopposing respondeat superior. I suppose that would be\nan inducement for them to go ahead with the\ninvestigation; wouldn't you?\nMR. YOUNG: Their -- they would lose the\nprotections of Faragher and Ellerth. We would be back\nto respondeat superior liability. It sounds illogical,\nbut I -- I submit to the Court that if -- that if it is\ngoing to be a Hobson's choice and it -- it would be a\nsituation in which employers would have an incentive to\nchoose not to -- would choose to abandon their policies\nand take their chances.\nIf they have to interview 20 people in a --\nin a retaliation -- in a sexual harassment case, there's\n20 potential plaintiffs because they all participated.\nIt doesn't even matter if the employer knows what the\nemployees said. If -- if some type of discipline or\nadverse action is imposed by the employer on any of\nthose employees, there is an instant retaliation claim.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: By the way, I take it in --\nin this case, although this is not the issue before us,\nthat if you -- if you lose on the issues before us, it\nis still your position that ultimately you should win\nthis case, because you have good evidence, you say in\nyour briefs, to indicate that the reason for firing had\nnothing to do with retaliation.\nThat's true, isn't it?\nMR. YOUNG: I have two arguments left in my\nquiver on summary judgment, Your Honor, that the trial\ncourt didn't even consider. So if this case goes back\ndown, that's what I'm going to ask the trial court to\nconsider.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What are the other\narguments on summary judgment.\nMR. YOUNG: The lack of causation, the lack\nof knowledge between whatever told the investigator in\nthis confidential interview as to which confidentiality\nwas promised and delivered, the lack of any knowledge --\n-- the lack of any evidence that the decision-makers\nregarding Ms. Crawford and her job, that they knew what\nshe said in this interview. The lack of causation is my\nfirst ground and the lack of pretext is my second ground\nthat has yet to be considered. Because of the abundant\nevidence of misconduct which was discovered regarding\nhow Ms. Crawford was not running her office.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: When you say it's not\nthat the employer is stuck because there's a potential\nretaliation claim, if the employer is certain of its\ngrounds, that this discharge had nothing to do with her\ntestimony, then go ahead and discharge her.\nMR. YOUNG: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you get your litigation\nfees if you win? If the plaintiff here loses, does she\npay all the attorneys' fees that this employer has\nincurred on this litigation?\nMR. YOUNG: It is very difficult for a\nvictorious defendant to recover attorneys' fees under\nsection 1988, Your Honor. The threshold is very high.\nI've never recovered the fees in my 14 years working for\nthis office in a section 1983 case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So even when you win you\nlose.\nMR. YOUNG: Yes. In that sense, yes, Your\nHonor. Or a Title VII case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: On the other side, that\nattorney, there's a large disincentive. He hasn't got a\ngood case. He's not going to be paid any retainer as\nyou might be. And he's not going to get any counsel\nfees. Why should such -- why should it -- counsel be\navailable to a person who obviously was discharged for\nhaving her hand in the till and not because she was\nharassed?\nMR. YOUNG: First of all, there is no\nallegation that Ms. Crawford embezzled or took money.\nThere is no allegation, and she was not disciplined.\nShe was not discharged based on any allegation she was\nstealing money. That's simply not a factor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No. I meant that as a\nhypothetical.\nMR. YOUNG: Oh, I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the reason that\nshe was -- what was the employer's reason for\ndischarging her?\nMR. YOUNG: Multiple -- she was the payroll\ncoordinator and her office -- all these checks were\nsitting in her office and they were not being processed.\nSome of them were six, eight, ten months old. Her\noffice was in complete disarray. And this came to light\nas a result of this sexual harassment investigation when\nher subordinates were interviewed and they provided\ntestimony regarding how she was running her office, and\nthat eventually got to the finance department of the\ngovernment, which hired an outside auditor which went in\nand generated all this evidence at great expense to the\nmetropolitan government to hire this outside auditor.\nThat's where the evidence was developed to\nterminate Ms. Crawford six months after the statement to\nthe investigators. So that's -- those were the facts on\nhow it happened.\nI forgot Your Honor's original question, or\nmaybe I answered it. I don't know.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I said if you have a\nreally strong case of having discharged this person for\ncause that has nothing at all to do with harassment, you\nare going to win the lawsuit and it would be hard for\nthe plaintiff to get a decent lawyer to represent her\nside of the case because she's going to lose.\nMR. YOUNG: In theory, yes; but the burdens\nof litigation, which is part of the congressional\ncompromise -- back in 1964 in order to gain passage of\nthe Civil Rights Act, employer's interests were deemed\nto be of equal magnitude as employees'.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're not going to\nwin -- you're not going to win this case; you're going\nto settle if you lose up here, right?\nMR. YOUNG: If I lose up here, first I've\ngot two more shots at summary judgment, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You don't have to answer\nthat. We'll be glad to see you again.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. YOUNG: I hope I'm not --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My point is simply\nthat the incentive system is skewed because if you lose\nyou pay not only your attorneys' fees but the\ncomplainants'. If you win, you have to incur yours.\nMR. YOUNG: In civil rights cases the\nincentives, that incentive fee, that incentive system,\nis skewed against the defendants because of the public\npolicy reason favoring --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not saying it\nshouldn't be. But in terms of the pressures towards\nsettlement, it is a very strong incentive.\nMR. YOUNG: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is bringing frivolous\ncases cost-free for the plaintiffs? There are certain\ncosts.\nMR. YOUNG: Well, Your Honor, many of these\ntypes of cases are taken on a contingent fee basis\nexcept for hard costs.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It is a mix. I mean, you\nknow, a lot of plaintiffs might be afraid to bring these\ncases because they'll be accused of doing all kinds of\nbad things. They don't want their reputations ruined.\nThey have lawyers who take contingent fees because they\nhave to pay for it. Oh the other hand, you have\nproblems with your costs and you have problems\ndismissing people who should be dismissed. Everybody\nhas problems in this area. That's why we have law and\nlawyers. They try to minimize it. This doesn't seem\nfruitful to me.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't it true that\nfinancially it is always cost-free for the plaintiff\nbecause she has an attorney who is taking it on a\ncontingent basis? Now, you could say it's not cost-free\nto the lawyer; but even that's not always true because\nif the lawyer has nothing else to do he may as well be\ndoing this, you know, whatever the odds are.\nMR. YOUNG: I agree with that, Your Honor.\nAnd if the Court has no more questions,\nthank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Schnapper, you have four minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Thank you, Your Honor, may\nit please the Court:\nProtecting witnesses from being fired\nbecause they provide information in internal\ninvestigates is not going to interfere with the conduct\nof those investigations or deter them. We know that\nfrom experience. Until the decision in this case, no\none had questioned the applicability of the opposition\nclause to a witness in an investigation who complains\nabout sexual harassment. It was simply not in dispute.\nThe compliance manual in this regard was entirely clear\nsince 2000 because the Commission took the position\nwitnesses who complained were protected by the\nopposition clause. None of the problems Mr. Young\nexpressed concern about had happened.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, Ms. Blatt\nsaid the government would prefer a decision under the\nopposition ground as opposed to the participation. Do\nyou have a preference?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: I think she said she thought\nit was easier. We don't have a preference. But I'd\nlike to address briefly the participation clause. The\nparticipation clause does have the singular value, as\nJustice Alito suggested, that it is evenhanded, that it\nwill protect witnesses for both sides. And the\nintegrity of the process is certainly strengthened if\nboth witnesses, witnesses on both sides, know they're\nprotected from retaliation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the only question --\n-the participation is not in doubt. The only question\nis whether it's an investigation under this subtitle.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: But the question is under\nthis title. That language its certainly broad enough,\nas Justice Souter suggested, to encompass the sort of\nprocess that's at issue here. As Justice Ginsburg\npointed out, this Court's decisions in Faragher\nvirtually mandate these decisions.\nIn response to the Chief Justice's point --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You think the language\n\"investigation under this title\" is the equivalent of\n\"investigation with respect to an alleged offense under\nthis title\"? That doesn't strike me as self-evident at\nall. It seems to me \"investigation under this title\" to\nme means an investigation under this title, which is not\nan investigation by the employer.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: I think the words under this\ntitle are elastic enough to support either meaning. The\ncontext of the statute and the way this Court has\nrepeatedly construed it give meaning to it. In response\nto the concern that the Chief Justice raised, Faragher\nand Ellerth are not the only decisions that provide an\nincentive for these investigations. The Court's\ndecision in Kolstad makes the existence of this sort of\nprocess essential to avoid awards of punitive damages.\nSo even in non-harassment cases that same incentive has\nbeen created by the courts.\nIn a situation involving harassment, the\ncontours of the investigation are fact largely shaped by\nFederal law, not only policy guidance which the EEOC has\nissued helping employers figure out what to do, but a\nlarge and growing body of case law under Faragher and\nEllerth elucidating what those requirements are.\nParticularly importantly here, the victims of sexual\nharassment are virtually required by the court to use\nthese processes. Ms. Crawford had to speak up at some\npoint or she had had no claim.\nAnd last, as a practical matter, if sexual\nharassment is going to be stopped, it's mostly going to\nhappen through these internal processes. By the time\nmost of these controversies about sexual harassment get\nto the EEOC or the courts, the victims have left their\njobs. In this Court's decision in Pollard, the\nindividual had been fired. In Souter she had been\ndriven from her job. In Faragher and Ellerth and\nHarris, those had quit. If you look at the array of\nlower court decisions involving sexual harassment, by\nthe time a case gets to the Commission in most of those\ncases the victim has give up and left.\nSo it's exceptionally important that these\nprocesses be effective and evenhanded.\nNo further questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
