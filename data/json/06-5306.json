        "content": "(11:06a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Case 06-5306, Bowles versus Russell.\nMr. Mancino.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL MANCINO, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. MANCINO: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nPetitioner is before this Court because he\nfollowed an order of the district court. He filed his\nnotice of appeal within the time authorized by the\ndistrict court. It was only when the matter came before\nthe court of appeals was it raised that the district\ncourt apparently had no authority to grant a 17-day\nextension, although it specified a specific date rather\nthan the 14 days in connection with the case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, it was authorized by\nthe district court in the sense the district court put\nit on a piece of paper. It wasn't authorized because\nthe district court had no authority to extend that.\nMR. MANCINO: The district court put it on\nthere. When you look at the actual entry itself, it's a\nhandwritten entry. There's no way of telling from the\nhandwritten entry whether that entry was even entered on\nthe docket on the same date because all you have is the\nhandwritten entry, February 10, file your appeal by\nFebruary 27, which is unusual in a civil case because\nnormally in a civil case you get a judgment; you don't\nget a directive from the Court that you have 30 days to\nfile a notice of appeal or anything in connection with\nthis. So I don't think it's unreasonable to rely upon a\ndirective from a court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you knew that 14\ndays was the maximum because the motion asking for it\ncited and quoted from the rule.\nMR. MANCINO: Well, that -- we did cite from\nthe rule. That is correct. When the order came out --\nwell, first of all, we were glad to get the order to\nallow time to appeal; but looking at the order, or just\nlooking at the date, something had to be done. And Of\ncourse, we filed on one day before the end date --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if, what if the\nDistrict Court gave you an extra month? Would your\nargument still be the same, that that -- because the\ncourt set it, that trumps the limitation in the rule?\nMR. MANCINO: Well, then you get into\ncertain time limits, whether it's reasonable under the\ncircumstances, would a reasonable attorney or litigant\nrely upon a, you know, expansive period of time that the\ncourt gave to it. But here certainly this order is not\nunreasonable. It's certainly within the confines. And\nyou have a specific end date, do your notice of appeal\nby this date.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But wouldn't a reasonable\nlawyer have said see, I referred to the rule, when I\nmade this motion for extension of time. The rule said\n14 days; this judge obviously made a slip. He\nmiscalculated.\nWouldn't a lawyer faced with what the rule\nclearly says and an inconsistency scribbled on an order,\nsay the judge probably made a mistake? So I better, if\nI want to protect my client, do what the rule says?\nMR. MANCINO: Well, looking back, that is\nprobably correct. But looking at the order, and the way\nit came out, and the fact that you know, the -- the rule\nallowed for a reopening of the appeal, just looking at\nthe end date of the order, make sure the notice of\nappeal is filed by that date, it would seem to me that\nthe party who is adversely affected by it may object on\nthat basis, saying Judge, you have no authority to do\nthis, what are you doing in connection with --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why isn't -- this is\njust a notice of appeal. Why would you -- why not file\nit the same day? In terms of looking at it from some\nequitable sense, I don't understand why you wait toward\nthe end of the period assuming you hadn't focused on the\ndifference between the 14 days and the days allowed.\nWhat -- why, why would you delay filing the\nnotice of appeal?\nMR. MANCINO: Well, the only reason for\ndelaying it is obviously workload. And you don't want\nto get all briefs due within a short period of time,\nonce you get your notice of appeal filed in a particular\ncase, because you have time limits for getting the\nrecord, your briefing, and you know, there's a number of\nappeals going out -- not in this Court, but you know\nthere were a number of appeals going on.\nAnd my normal practice is you know, file\nyour notice of appeal near the end of the applicable\nappeals time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it make -- does\nit a difference that we're dealing with the safety valve\nprovision? In other words, you've got the 30 days to\nfile; and then this rule allows you to -- it's a safety\nvalve, if you didn't get the notice or whatever, you've\ngot a certain procedure that can give you the extra 14\ndays. And now it seems to me that you're asking for a\nsafety valve on top of a safety valve.\nAnd I wonder if there's some point where you\ncut off the -- allowing an out for missing the deadline.\nMR. MANCINO: Well, I suppose at some point,\nsomeone may say well, if the court gave you 180 days to\ndo the act, someone may say well, that appears to be\nunreasonable in connection with that. I think the safer\nthing is just to put the order down, say application,\nreopen the appeal time, granted.\nAnd then it would cause someone to go you\nknow, go back, look at the rule, see how much time is\nallotted under the rule in connection with the case.\nBut I don't think it's unreasonable; in these\ncircumstances we're only talking about three days to do\nan act. The act was done in two days.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but as soon as\nyou start talking about an exception from the provision\nin the rules, then you're going to get a lot of\napplications and there are going to be a lot of\ndifferent reasons for why it wasn't filed on the last\nday. Once that -- it seems to me, you open it up for an\nindeterminate ruling.\nMR. MANCINO: Well, this is an equitable\nrule in itself. Because it allows something where an\nappeal time has expired, can you come in and show the\ncircumstances, one, you were not notified, which\nobviously the court did. The other side's prejudiced --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well it is an equitable\nrule conditioned upon compliance with time limits.\nMR. MANCINO: Well, that's -- that's once\nit's granted. It's not, the time limit is 180 days or\nthe seven day after you received or became aware actual\nnotice --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but\nJustice Kennedy's point I think is critical. In other\nwords, the drafters of the rule obviously wanted to\nprovide a safety valve. But they also appreciated that\nyou can't have it open-ended. So they did impose limits\non the -- if you want to call it equitable exception to\nthe 30-day rule. And it seems to me that you sort of\nrestrike the balance the drafters of the rule struck if\nyou allow further equitable departures from their, their\nrule.\nMR. MANCINO: Well, I think in past cases\nthe Court has always recognized there are deadlines but\nthere are exceptions to deadlines. And the most\ncompelling exemption is where a court says do the act at\nthis particular time. And you know, it's coming from a\njudicial officer, it's not coming from someone\nmiscalculating on the calendar, calculating the time\nwhen it's 30 days run, when is 14 days run, when it's 10\ndays run in connection with the case. Because in civil\nlitigation you are not given any specific time to do an\nact. Criminal cases are a little bit different. You\nare told about an appeal, when an appeal has to be filed\nin connection with a case. You do not have in civil,\nwhen you get your final order -- you know you have 30\ndays to do it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Mancino, your position\nhere is that this rule is not jurisdictional.\nNow, what -- what are the consequences of\nthat? I take it that that would mean that the court of\nappeals has no obligation to inquire on its own whether\nthe matter has been filed too late?\nMR. MANCINO: Well, I believe --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right? If the parties\ndon't make anything of it, the court of appeals can --\ncan take a late, a late filing?\nMR. MANCINO: Well, I think when the court\nof appeals does that, I think in all fairness, they\nshould advise the parties in advance that they we're\nconsidering this on our own, that the appeal was out of\ntime, and would you like to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, but I'm asking\nwhether a court of appeals has to even worry about that?\nIf the parties don't make anything of it, the court of\nappeals can just assume it's okay and go ahead, right?\nMR. MANCINO: Correct. Because I think\nthey've waived any -- the other side obviously has\nwaived or forfeited any right to object to the -- you\nknow, to the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you need an objection\nor else it's, it will be okay?\nMR. MANCINO: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you need an objection\nor else it will be all right?\nMR. MANCINO: Yes. The objection in this\ncase came -- you know, in the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That means that a rule --\nthat -- 14 days is really a rule left to the discretion\nof the district judge. If the district judge feels like\ngiving a little more, this would be no control, unless\nthe opposing side objects; is that right?\nMR. MANCINO: Well, I -- I believe it does\ncall for a timely objection by somebody to say\nsomething, rather than to just sit back and let it\nexpire, knowing that someone did something that they\nshould not do in connection with --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose you have problems\nat home. I don't know, you have an illness at home.\nAnd you ask counsel for the other side, you know, I know\nit's a 14-day limit, but would you give me 20 days?\nRight? And opposing counsel being as friendly as they\nare nowadays --\n(Some laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- the other, the other\nside would say sure, take 20 days. Okay? So you\nprepare a paper for signature by the judge and he signs\noff on it, gives you 20 days. That's okay then, right?\nMR. MANCINO: Well I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Because the other side's\nagreed. He won't object on the court of appeals. And\nsuddenly, suddenly, you've got 20 days even though the\nrule says 14.\nMR. MANCINO: Well, there you have somewhat\nadvance knowledge that you're doing something possibly\ncontrary to a rule. But then you have the issue of once\nyou do it, are you forfeiting your right to object and\nclaim a deficiency in the process.\nHere you're only -- what you're doing --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I mean, that -- that\nmay, that may be true of this stage; but\nJustice Scalia's question points up the problem of what\ndo we do if we write this case? How do we formulate\nthis rule? And if we say that it's not jurisdictional,\nnot binding, then going forward, it seems to me to allow\nthe hypothetical that he puts to you.\nMR. MANCINO: Well, I believe you can come\nup with all sorts of scenarios. What I think is the\nthing --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's why we're wondering\nhow to write the opinion.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MANCINO: And where did the litigant\nreasonably rely upon an order of the court, which\napparently the court had authority to issue, regardless\nof the court making a mistake or doing something\nintentionally --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And the person who did the\nreliance was you, I guess?\nMR. MANCINO: Yes, that's correct.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And is it correct that --\nwho -- was this litigant represented by counsel during\nthe period when he didn't get the notice of the\nSeptember 9 order?\nMR. MANCINO: Yes. I filed the habeas\npetition. I did anything in connection with the case.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So neither the, neither\nthe prisoner nor you received any notice of the first\ngoof up?\nMR. MANCINO: Well, the first -- well, we\nreceived notice of the judgment on the merits. Then we\nfiled a motion to alter judgment or for a new trial. It\nwas not, the order overruling the motion to alter or\namend judgment or the motion for a new trial date was\nnot received. And the clerk's docket showed it wasn't\nmailed out.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I see.\nMR. MANCINO: But in the, in that court,\nthere was a transitioning to this electronic filing,\nwhich not everybody was set up at that particular time;\nso apparently the order may have only gone to -- on the\nelectronic filing system to those who were set up, and\nwe were not set up on that thing. But the court still\nhad the obligation to send it out. The court found that\nthe clerk did not send it out. The clerk found that, or\nthe court found that we did not have notification. And\nthe court found that the other side is not prejudiced by\nany application.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would your -- would\nyour proposed exception, does it work the other day? I\nmean, let's say the district court entered this order\nand set a date certain for you to file the notice of\nappeal, and only gave you seven days on his count rather\nthan 14, and you filed it on the ninth day, in other\nwords within the 14 days given under the rule.\nWould you be out of luck because of what the\ndistrict court set out in its order as what's binding,\nas opposed to what the resume says? Or could you rely\non the fact the rule says you get 14 days?\nMR. MANCINO: Well I would believe you could\nthen argue that the rule says that, the judge was wrong\nin -- you know -- in truncating your appeal time to file\nthe appeal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why wouldn't the\nsame approach work the other way? The rule says 14 and\nthe judge was wrong to give you more?\nMR. MANCINO: Well, because the exceptions\nto all of these time deadlines, you have cases from this\nCourt where people untimely file a motion for a new\ntrial. A new trial motion by rule has to be timely\nfiled in order to toll your time. And there have been\ncases where the motion for new trial has been untimely\nfiled. The other side didn't say anything. And then\nwhen the ruling is made, the appeal is filed within the\nappropriate time.\nAnd this Court has sanctioned that procedure\nin connection. I see no difference here, where a\nlitigant before a court, the court issues an order, you\nlook at the order. And you abide by the order in\nconnection with the case.\nThey do have a reasonable reliance in the\ncase. And in looking back later on, in connection with\nthe -- the issue, in connection with the case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You know sometimes,\nsometimes district courts take jurisdiction over a case\nthat they -- that they shouldn't have jurisdiction over.\nMR. MANCINO: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And sometimes in reliance\non that, you go through a whole trial and it comes up to\nthe court of appeals and we say huh, there was no\njurisdiction here; too bad.\nMR. MANCINO: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even though the court said\nit and you went through a whole trial in reliance on the\ndistrict judge. District judges make mistakes.\nMR. MANCINO: Well, that's a whole -- I\nbelieve that's a whole different scenario than presented\nhere. That goes to the subject matter --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's even worse, it seems\nto me. I mean, you've wasted weeks, you know, in trial\nand so forth.\nMR. MANCINO: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But if it's jurisdictional,\nwe have to say, you know, too bad. Yes, you were misled\nby the judge. In reliance on the district judge, you\nexpended a lot of time and money, but there was no\njurisdiction. And that's the end of the matter.\nMR. MANCINO: Well, the rule I always\nremember from law school is that parties cannot\nvoluntarily confer jurisdiction on a court that does not\nhave it. And the court, at any point, if they do not\nhave subject matter jurisdiction, is free to dismiss the\ncase whether it's at trial level, the appeal level, or\nwhatever.\nThis is not that situation. Obviously, the\ncourt by the rule could look into this matter. The\ncourt by the rule could grant relief in connection with\nthis matter. It's a question whether the three days --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I know I could find this\nout by looking at a calendar. Do you remember what day\nof the week February 24th was, or 26th?\nMR. MANCINO: I believe --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We don't have a weekend\nproblem, do we?\nMR. MANCINO: I believe it was not -- I\ndon't believe it was a weekend, no.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I looked at this. There's\na time start. And I think it might be the time stamp\nwhen this document was entered on the ultimate appeal.\nBut -- but something you said at the outset\nprompts this question, that -- Did you think that -- the\ntime runs from $14 days after the date when the district\ncourt's order is entered.\nMR. MANCINO: When it's entered. That's\ncorrect.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And was there a submission\nor an implication in your remarks that you thought that\nthe order was not entered until three days later?\nMR. MANCINO: No.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there an entry -- is\nthere a time entry on the dock -- on court's order?\nMR. MANCINO: No. It's a handwritten one\nthat doesn't say anything --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I know that it's a\nhandwritten one. But that that -- that shows how long\nhe has to appeal. is there a date when the order was\nput on the docket? Does that show on this sheet?\nMR. MANCINO: No. There's nothing from the\nclerk indicating -- on the docket there is, but nothing\non the document that was sent, because the document only\nwas sent -- it was just handwritten over the -- on top\nof the motion, so there was no way of telling when it\nwas entered. Because you look back at the history of\nthis case, when the court dismissed the original\npetition, the court had a date on it. It was only 18\ndays later that it was actually entered by the clerk,\nand of course that triggered the time for asking for\nreconsideration.\nSo -- but --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about the weekends? I\nmean, maybe the judge -- I -- it looks from my\ncalendar -- I wondered what day of the week it was. You\ndon't remember. 2/10, February 10, 2004, what day of\nthe week was it?\nMR. MANCINO: That I cannot answer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It looks like it was the\nmiddle of the week. So maybe there were one or two\nweekends. So maybe what the judge's mistake was, he\ndidn't know how to count the weekend rule.\nMR. MANCINO: Well, what I think was done --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Which may not be\njurisdictional, the weekend rule.\nMR. MANCINO: What I believe is that this\nwas sent out by mail. So they had, you know, the\nthree-day mail rule, and that's how you came to the 14\ndays in connection with the -- put in the 17-day limit\non --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe Arabic numerals\naren't jurisdictional either.\nJUSTICE BREYER: They're not. A numeral is\nnot jurisdictional.\nWhat's -- what's -- what's the three-day\nmail rule?\nMR. MANCINO: Well, normally if you are\nallowed to do an act by mail, you have three days, you\ncan serve a party and then you have three days to file\nwith the court as part of the Civil Rules. I sort of\nthink that's what the judge -- because this was going\nout by mail -- he probably didn't get -- I wish I would\nhave saved the envelope, but I don't have the envelope,\nbut it probably didn't get to my office for three days\nanyway.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Speaking of the three-day\nmail rule, maybe the judge's intent when he signed this\nwas that it actually was entered, took effect as of\nthree days later.\nMR. MANCINO: Well, there's really no --\nlooking at the document, there's no way of telling that.\nThat is correct. There's no way of telling that, and I\nbelieve that was probably the reasoning of the court\nthat, you know, it took three days to get mail because\nyou didn't get -- it wasn't sent out last time,\nobviously you did not get the mail the last time, so he\nadded the three days, and then you have the 14 days to,\nyou know, perfect or file your notice of appeal to get\nit to the court in this case.\nSo --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All of that might\nhave -- all those things might have been going on in the\njudge's mind, but you don't contest that the 14-day\nperiod was not complied with? You don't have an\nargument that you complied with the 14-day period?\nMR. MANCINO: No, I do not. We're relying\nto the exceptions, and there's a number exceptions on\ndeadlines that have come out. We have the equitable\ntolling, we have the waiver, forfeiture issue. And, you\nknow, in this case, specific assurance by a court which\nin a past opinion seemed to control the date, where a\njudge gave you a specific assurance that you could do\nsomething in connection with the case.\nThe old Harris Truck case is where the\nlawyer was on vacation. The judge said well, I'll give\nyou some extra time. Even though they knew of the\njudgment, they knew the time would run, he said I'll\ngive you extra time to file the appeal because you want\nto contact the lawyer who was on vacation. The court of\nappeals then said well, the rule didn't apply because\nyou knew of the order, so -- but that was overlooked\neven though by time calculation, everybody was out of\ntime.\nThe Eberhart case, they were out of time\nbecause the motion for new trial was filed untimely,\nwhich under the rule required a timely filing of a\nmotion for a new trial in order to toll your appeal\ntime.\nSo this, obviously the motion to reopen was\ntimely filed, was filed within the 180 days required by\nthe rule. The other side was served. The other side\nhad no objection to it and didn't oppose it. The real\nissue when you look at an equitable -- sort of an\nequitable rule like this, is the other side prejudiced,\nand obviously they are not prejudiced.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One of the things I\nthink the drafters of the rule wanted to assure is that\nthere would be a point at which the prevailing party in\nthe district court could know with certainty there\nwasn't going to be further proceedings in the case, and\nthat's the purpose of the 180-day period and all that.\nIt's not open-ended.\nUnder your rule where the actual time for\nfiling could be at some indefinite point, they'd never\nreally quite have that assurance, would they?\nMR. MANCINO: Well, unless the court\nspecifically granted to the litigant a specific period\nof time, and you know, normally litigants and lawyers do\nnot ignore what the court says.\nAt least I think as, you know, anyone -- if\nthis court said that, you have a right to reasonably\nrely on what the court said. And it certainly wasn't an\nunreasonable period of time that the court was giving in\nthe case. It wasn't --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what would be\nan unreasonable period of time if the two or three days\nis not? Would another 10 days?\nMR. MANCINO: Well, if you go back to the\nrules, you're going into the six months, 180 days, and\nthen, you know, you would say something. Or if the\ncourt, you know, gave you a year or something by\nmistake, you know, it would -- you know, that something\ndoes not sound right here. And then you would look at\nit. At least if that were the case, you could probably\ngo in and get the court to reconsider, bring it to the\nattention of the court. Your Honor, we did not have all\nof this time. Did you make a mistake? You can always\ncorrect mistakes. But that was not done here, it was\nnot done by the respondent in this case because they\ndidn't -- the respondent did not object to the\napplication to reopen the appeal, did not say anything\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the respondent said\nhe had no reason at that time to believe that you\nwouldn't follow the rule and file within the 14 days.\nSo if they made an objection, the moment the judge put\ndown a date that's 17 days later, the judge might say\nthat's premature.\nMR. MANCINO: Well then, the judge may have\nsaid well, I don't -- look at the rule. I don't have\nit. I'm going to redraft the order, vacate my order and\nput a proper order on in connection with the case. It\nwould seem to me that at some point in the appellate\nprocess, because when you look at the history that the\nSixth Circuit in this case -- at least when the court\nthen granted a certificate of appealability, you would\nthink the respondent would -- what are -- why are you\ngranting a certificate of appealability when you told us\nwe have no jurisdiction over this case, or at least from\nthe two orders anyway, they said they had jurisdiction\nover the February 10th order that -- on the appeal. And\nthe -- then the certificate of appealability was denied,\nand normally that would end the case.\nThe court granted the -- my motion for\nreconsideration, and then granted certain issues that\ncould be briefed on the merits. But once the court\ngranted the certificate of appealability, it seemed to\nme that the other side, well, what is happening here?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Mancino, I take it that\nwhat you are really proposing is sort of a rule that if\n-- if counsel could reasonably be misled to overlook the\nmistake by the court, that your reliance upon the\ncourt's mistake should -- should, in fact, be respected.\nIt's kind of a rule of reasonably misleading; is that\nabout right?\nMR. MANCINO: I believe so.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, that's how we\ndistinguish your case on your view from the case in\nwhich you get 180 days instead of 14?\nMR. MANCINO: Right. Sort of, you know,\nreasonably reliant, is it fair.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You think we should\nhave a rule of reason rather than a per se rule.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MANCINO: That's the prior case, because\nthey made that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask this question:\nIs the order on page 151 of the joint appendix, just\nthose three lines, that's the entire order that the\njudge entered? It just says granted, and motion --\nMR. MANCINO: That is what's handwritten on\nthe original documents. That's it.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: He did not make the\nfindings that the rule requires?\nMR. MANCINO: No. But presumably you would\nassume that those findings are subsumed within the rule\nbecause the judge found in our favor. The judge denied\nthe motion to vacate part of it but granted the\nreopening to vacate, and of course on the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Because the motion\nrequires --\nMR. MANCINO: -- motion to vacate, you have\n30 days to appeal.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The rule requires that he\nmake three specific findings which he did not make.\nMR. MANCINO: He did not make it, but you\nassume that the judge did by granting the motion, and\nnobody else said anything about it anyway.\nI reserve the time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Marshall?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM P. MARSHALL\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. MARSHALL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe petitioner's failure to meet the 14-day\nstatutory deadline for filing his notice of appeal is\nfatal to his case for three reasons.\nFirst, the 14-day period is mandatory and\njurisdictional, and Federal district courts do not have\nthe power to enlarge this time period.\nSecond, the 14-day rule was not forfeited by\nthe state of Ohio and may be raised by the court sua\nsponte in any event.\nThird, even if there could be some sort of\nlimited equitable exception to the 14-day time\nrequirement, the petitioner here falls far short of\ndemonstrating why he is entitled to such extraordinary\nrelief.\nLet me explain why. The petitioner's claim\nthat notice of appeal time requirements are not\njurisdictional contradicts 150 years of practice,\ncountless lower court decisions, settled congressional\nunderstanding as to the meaning of its governing --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What type of jurisdiction\nare you speaking of? It's certainly not Federal\njurisdiction in the sense of subject matter\njurisdiction, like a specific case arising under Federal\nlaw. What kind of jurisdiction do you have in mind?\nMR. MARSHALL: Your Honor, I think it is its\nown form of subject matter jurisdiction in the same way\nthat final judgments on appeals are subject matter\njurisdiction. And the reason why is that notice of\nappeals are classically jurisdictional in that sense, in\nthat they transfer the locus of the case from one court\nto another. In the appellate system, there's actually a\nchanging of the jurisdiction, and the notice of appeal\nis that triggering mechanism. And in that sense, it is\nclassically jurisdictional and different from the other\nkinds of time limits that this Court addressed in\nKontrick, in versus Eberhart because those took place\nwithin a particular court system, the district court\nsystem, where here there was a transfer of jurisdiction\ntriggered by the notice of appeal from one court to the\nother.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that just a word game?\nIt's jurisdictional because it transfers jurisdiction\nfrom one court to the other. Why should that be -- why\ndoes that make it jurisdictional?\nMR. MARSHALL: Well, I think, Your Honor,\nthe same way that final judgments are. I mean, final\njudgments are a jurisdictional prerequisite to transfer\nfrom one case to another.\nThe second reason, Your Honor, by the way,\nis congressional, is the congressional reenactment of\nthe notice of appeal time deadlines, which\nalso indicates that Congress treats these --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Can you think of anything\nthat's enacted by Congress as jurisdictional?\nMR. MARSHALL: No, Your Honor, but when\nthere is a background, as there is in this case, of 150\nyears of practice where Congress has enacted against\nthat background, it is presumed to be jurisdictional.\nAnd I'd also point out that with respect to this Court's\njurisdiction, the Court has treated petitions for\ncertiorari as jurisdictional in civil cases because\nthere is a statutory underpinning, but has not treated\nthem as jurisdictional in criminal cases in part because\nthere is not a statutory underpinning.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Doesn't the latter suggest\nthat a rule that concerns the transfer of a case from\none court to another is not necessarily jurisdictional?\nMR. MARSHALL: Your Honor, I think the\nlatter recognizes the fact that it doesn't necessarily\nhave to be. That is correct.\nHowever, that Congress and this Court can\ntreat such a thing because it is in a -- because it is\na -- because it does transfer the case from one to\nanother. I think that the criminal -- that in the\ncertiorari case, with respect to criminal, it might be\nan indication there that there might be some relation.\nBut I would also suggest that with respect to certiorari\npractice, you've already -- you're already in the\nappellate mode and you're not dividing the jurisdiction\nbetween trial courts and appellate courts.\nBut the quick answer is yes, Your Honor, I\ndon't think it has to be jurisdictional, but certainly\nit can be jurisdictional. And for 150 years, this Court\nand Congress has treated this particular division as\njurisdictional.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, it seems to me that's\nwhat we're back to, that it's long been treated as\njurisdictional. But you just said that it's not\nsufficient that it's been enacted by Congress and it's\nnot sufficient that it transfers the case from one court\nto another.\nSo we're back just to history, right?\nMR. MARSHALL: Well, Your Honor, it's more\nthan just history, because I think Congress reenacting\n2107 against this background for 150 years, that this\nissue has been treated as jurisdictional, puts Congress\nbehind this as well. But here it's also, 150 years is\nnot a matter of --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The provision of, is it\n2107?\nMR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where does that appear in\nthe judicial code? Does it appear under the provisions\nconcerning jurisdiction?\nMR. MARSHALL: No, Your Honor. 2107 does\nnot itself mention jurisdiction. However, that is also\ntrue with 2101 in respect to this Court's certiorari\njurisdiction in civil cases. The word jurisdiction is\nnot mentioned specifically but it --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it is under the\nheading procedure, court procedure, right?\nMR. MARSHALL: It's time for appeal to\ncourt to proceed.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but that's under a\nchapter that deals with procedures, as opposed to\njurisdiction.\nMR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor. But this\nCourt in Barnhart suggested that in determining whether\nsomething is jurisdictional or not, one looks at the\ncontext of the particular location. Here this Rule 21\n-- excuse me. Here this statute, 2107, has been enacted\nand reenacted against the background of this Court\nconsistently saying it's jurisdictional and treating\nthis rule as jurisdictional, and that's since cases as\nfar along as Edmondson.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You know there have been\na spate of cases that said the word \"jurisdiction\" has\nbeen vastly overused, it's a word of many meanings. And\nyou are telling me that the meaning of these statutes is\nsubject matter jurisdiction, just like it's diversity,\nis there a federal question?\nMR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor, in the same\nway that amount in controversies are also subject\nmatter.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But amount in controversy\nis in 1332. Congress putting it right there together.\nIt says diversity of citizenship plus amount in\ncontroversy, all in 1332. Here the limit appears in a\nstatute, a rule of procedure, not jurisdiction.\nMR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor. But that\nstatute has been enacted against, as I keep\nreemphasizing, 150 years of practice, including the\nEdmondson case in 1869, where the Court on its own\nmotion raised the matter as being jurisdictional and\nbecause the time period had not been complied with\ndismissed the appeal.\nThe question essentially isn't whether we're\ngoing to call it jurisdictional or not. The question is\nthe effect of the particular rule. Some of the lower\ncourts call its indications of jurisdiction or a\nprerequisite to jurisdiction. The question is what the\ntreatment of this particular requirement is and the\ntreatment of this particular requirement consistently\nfor over 150 years has been that it is mandatory,\njurisdictional, non-forfeitable, it can be raised by the\ncourt sua sponte.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What characteristics are\nyou asserting follow from calling it jurisdictional in\nthis case?\nMR. MARSHALL: Your Honor, the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Number one, it can't be\nwaived, right?\nMR. MARSHALL: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Number two --\nMR. MARSHALL: It's non-forfeitable.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The court of appeals has to\ninquire on its own, right?\nMR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Anything else?\nMR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor. There's no\nequitable exception to it. There is no equitable\nexception to it as well if it's jurisdictional. So all\nof those three attach to the term \"jurisdictional.\" But\nI also think they could equally attach to the notion\nthat, even if we don't want to call it jurisdictional,\nif we don't view it as fitting easily within this\ncategory of subject matter jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Except at least as to the\nsecond, at least as to the second, I don't know of any\nmatter that a court has to inquire into sua sponte which\nis not jurisdictional. That's the one of the three\ncharacteristics that I think we have always attached the\nword \"jurisdictional\" to, I think.\nMR. MARSHALL: Well, Your Honor, in Day\nversus McDonough in dealing with a habeas, with a habeas\nstatute of limitations, this Court approved the court of\nappeals raising that issue sua sponte, although they --\nalthough in that case the Court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It may.\nMR. MARSHALL: It may.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But not must.\nMR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not must. And truly with\nthings we have called jurisdictional, you must, right?\nMR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor. However, if\nthe lower courts wanted to play with the language a\nlittle bit and call it necessary for the invocation of\njurisdiction or a prerequisite --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We could call it\n\"quasi-jurisdictional.\" You wouldn't object to that?\nMR. MARSHALL: No, Your Honor. As\nShakespeare might say, it's not the name. We are\ninterested in the effect, and the effect here has been\ntraditionally enforced over 150 years of court practice.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what do you think is\nthe --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How far do you take it?\nSuppose this ^ slip is not noticed in the court of\nappeals, and then there's a petition for cert, and some\nclever law clerk notices that the notice of appeal was\nfiled in 16 days instead of in 14 days. Would the court\nthen have to dismiss for want of jurisdiction?\nMR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor. I think it\napplies in the same way that lack of diversity would\napply or lack of a Federal question could apply, as in\nthe Mottley case. Even if it was in front of this\nCourt, if it was recognized in front of this Court, at\nthat time it would -- it must be dismissed.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let's take it a step\nfurther. Let's assume it isn't recognized. Assume he\ngets his habeas relief, and three years later some eager\nbeaver is culling through the records and says, this guy\nnever should have been in court. Do they rearrest him\nand put him into prison?\nMR. MARSHALL: Your Honor, collateral\nattacks for lack of subject matter jurisdiction are not\nnormally sustained, if that's what the -- if I\nunderstand your question correctly. So that, for\nexample, in a diversity case, if two years or three\nyears after it proceeds to final judgment somebody\nrealizes that both parties were from the same State, the\ncollateral attack would normally not allow to change\nthat, to change that result. And I would think that the\nsame thing would happen here. If the case had proceeded\nto final judgment, if there were an error of this type,\nas with other types of errors in subject matter\njurisdiction, there would not be an opening for\ncollateral attack.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about something here I\nhadn't run across, called the unique circumstances\ndoctrine. This Court in Osterneck said this: Where a\nparty has performed a act which if properly done would\npostpone the deadline for filing his appeal -- and\nindeed that's what happened here; he postponed the\ndeadline for filing his appeal -- and has received\nspecific assurance by a judicial officer that this act\nhas been properly done -- and here he did receive\nspecific assurance by a judicial officer that the act\nwas properly done -- in those circumstances, you can\nmake a little exception in the interests of justice.\nMR. MARSHALL: Well, Your Honor, the unique\ncircumstances doctrine doesn't apply here because there\nwasn't an act which if requested could have been\nproperly done.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, yes, the act was that\nhe filed a motion to reopen, which motion to reopen\npostponed the time of appeal. And two things have to\nhappen with that act. One is you have to get the\ndistrict judge to agree; and second, you have to file\nthe paper.\nSo that's the act which if properly done\nwould, in fact, have led to the appeal.\nMR. MARSHALL: Your Honor, I think that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I agree there were two\nparts to it or two acts, if you want.\nMR. MARSHALL: But, Justice Breyer, in this\ncase I think that what would have had to happen is that\nthe Petitioner would have had to move for 17 days in\norder for the act to be properly done. He moved for 14\ndays.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought what we were\ntalking about was that if the order had said 14 days\ninstead of 17, then the act would have been properly\ndone. That is, the only reason that -- the 16 days,\naccording to Mr. Mancino the only reason he took 16 days\nwas the judge authorized that. If the judge hadn't\nauthorized that, the rule wouldn't have been discarded\nand he would have filed in 14 days.\nMR. MARSHALL: Well, Your Honor, the judge\n-- our argument is in part that the judge had no power\nto authorize it. If I understand your question, with\nrespect to the unique circumstances doctrine, this\ndoesn't fit in because in the unique circumstances\ndoctrine the litigant actually has to seek a particular\ntype of relief and get granted that relief. The\nPetitioner here did not seek leave to file his motion of\nappeal within 17 days. The Petitioner here sought,\nwhich is the only thing he could do under the rules, is\nseek to reopen for 14 days.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So he hasn't\nreceived, just quoting from Osterneck, he hasn't\nreceived assurance that the act has been properly done?\nMR. MARSHALL: That's right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, if\nhe came back and said, was my notice of appeal timely or\nsomething, and the judge at that point ruled, then it\nmight come under that provision. But this is just --\nprospectively, he could have filed this timely even\nafter the judge issued the order. In other words, he\ncould have filed it on the 14th day. He didn't have to\nwait until the 17th day.\nMR. MARSHALL: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why does that matter? I\nmean, also Osterneck I happened to guess involved a case\nthat took place on Tuesday. This case took place on\nThursday. I mean, I grant you the language literally\nyou could say doesn't quite fit it, but so what? The\npurpose of this Osterneck I take it is to have a very\nnarrow exception where a judge tells you basically what\nto do, and you follow what the judge said, and then, lo\nand behold, they hit you with this jurisdictional thing\nand you didn't get it right.\nNow, that seems to be its purpose, and the\nlanguage is very close, so why not follow it?\nMR. MARSHALL: Your Honor, the purpose of\nthe unique circumstances doctrine is not to give a\nlicense to litigants to rely on district court errors.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That would be the\nvery narrow circumstances doctrine, not the unique\ncircumstances doctrine.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: I notice the court applied\nit twice, so it couldn't quite be the unique\ncircumstances.\nMR. MARSHALL: That's right, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question.\nSupposing there was a dispute as to whether the order\nhad been entered on February 10 or February 12. Say his\nhandwriting was illegible. Would that be a dispute that\nwould remain open throughout the appellate process?\nMR. MARSHALL: Your Honor, the question is\nwhen the clerk of court would have entered for the entry\nof judgment.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If he'd entered this order\non February 12 or 13 -- I forget which day it was -- the\nappeal would have been timely?\nMR. MARSHALL: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And I'm just -- and the\norder was defective because it didn't make findings\nrequired by the rule. And I'm just wondering, supposing\nit was ambiguous as to the date it was actually entered.\nWould the party then be entitled to rely on the date,\nFebruary 27th, set in the order, or would he have a duty\nto investigate and find out exactly when the judge\nsigned the order?\nMR. MARSHALL: I think the key question,\nYour Honor, I think is when the -- when the order is\nentered into the docket, which is done by the clerk of\ncourse. I think that is the triggering time.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: My question is what if\nthat's somewhat ambiguous? A busy court, he handed it\nto the clerk and the clerk didn't enter it into the\ndocket. You're not sure, there's a fact dispute about\nthat.\nMR. MARSHALL: Your Honor, that's a\ndifferent case. The beginning time period is a\nbeginning case, if there was some ambiguity there.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I understand. I'm just\nwondering what your view is, how should courts resolve\nthat kind of dispute? Should that be a dispute that\nremains open throughout the appellate process/ There's\na factual dispute as to when the judge signed order.\nMR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor. Again, the\nfactual dispute is when the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If he had written here,\ninstead of \"2-10,\" he had written down \"2-12,\" then the\nprosecutor 3 days later realized he had written down the\nwrong date, would that have made the appeal untimely?\nMR. MARSHALL: Your Honor, I think the\nquestion at that point is what is the time period\nentered into the formal docket, and what is the actual\njudgment.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And that's ambiguous, I'm\nsaying. That's ambiguous.\nMR. MARSHALL: If for some reason the court\nrecords are jumbled for some reason or another and\nnobody can determine when that entry of order is, that's\na different case.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In that case, you then\nrely on the February 27 date in the order? Then it must\nbe permissible to rely on appeal to be filed by 2-27?\nIn such a case it would be okay.\nMR. MARSHALL: Again, Your Honor, the\ncritical thing with the rule period is the time period\nfrom the entry of judgment.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I know, and I say it's\nhard to figure out when the order was actually written\ndown in the docket.\nMR. MARSHALL: I think that the question\nthat would be required then was for whoever was filing\nthe notice of appeal to determine when the entry of the\ndocket is. If that's ambiguous, I think it's obligatory\non the litigant to err on the side of caution, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And not rely on the 2-27\ndate.\nMR. MARSHALL: I would certainly suggest\nthat a litigant argue on -- err on the side of caution\nif at all.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Justice Breyer quoted\nfrom the Osterneck case. There was another statement of\nthe rule which goes like this: There is a sharply honed\nexception covering cases in which the trial judge has\nmisled a party who could have and probably would have\ntaken timely action as a trial judge conveyed correct\nrather than incorrect information. This case fits right\ninto that description, doesn't it?\nPLAINTIFF'S COUNSEL: No, Your Honor. The\ncase that they're citing to is Thompson, and in Thompson\nwhat occurred in that case is that the litigant in that\ncase --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The case that I'm reading\nfrom is the concurring opinion in Carlisle against\nUnited States. It does cite Thompson.\nMR. MARSHALL: Thompson is the case,\nThompson -- this Court has not relied on the unique\ncircumstances doctrine in 40 years. Buy in Thompson\nwhat occurred was the Petitioner requested a new trial\nuntimely, but was told by the court that they had timely\nrequested a new trial. Because they were informed that\nthey were entitled to a new trial, they did not do\nsomething else, which was file the notice of appeal. So\nthe court basically sent them down the wrong avenue.\nHere there was no wrong avenue that the court -- that\nthe litigant was being sent down.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But they would have filed\nthat notice of appeal earlier if the judge had said,\nyour motion for a new trial is untimely. It seems to me\nthe same as in this case. The judge said: Your motion\nis timely, so you're going to have the trigger so much\nlater. Fine. If the judge had said, your motion is\nuntimely and you know you've got to get your notice of\nappeal in sooner rather than later. Similarly, here the\njudge said, well, you've got until 17 days later.\nIf the judge had done right and said the\n14-day period, then surely Mr. Mancino would have filed\nwithin that period.\nMR. MARSHALL: But, Your Honor, there is\nnothing that the court did that prevented the litigant\nhere from filing on time. There was nothing that would\nhave prevented the litigation here from filing within\nthe 14-day period.\nAnd when --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was nothing in\nThompson that prevented filing the notice of appeal.\nMR. MARSHALL: Except in Thompson, Your\nHonor, he was told that he had the right to proceed on a\nmotion for new trial. If he had -- Your Honor, I see\nthat my time is up.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can finish your\nanswer.\nMR. MARSHALL: In Thompson, Your Honor, the\ndifference is that -- that the litigant was sent down a\ndifferent road which was inconsistent with his filing a\nnotice of appeal. Here there is nothing inconsistent\nabout filing a notice within 14 days as opposed to 17\ndays.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Marshall.\nMR. MARSHALL: Thank you, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: We'll hear from Mr. Stewart.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART,\nON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING RESPONDENT\nMR. STEWART: Thank you Mr. Chief Justice\nand may it please the Court.\nFor four basic reasons the deadline for\nfiling a notice of appeal in a civil case should be\ntreated as jurisdictional and therefore as nonwaivable.\nFirst, the time limit sent forth in Section 2107\ndirectly implicates the concerns that underlie the\nspecial treatment of jurisdictional issues. It's a\nfundamental precept of our legal system that Federal\ncourts should take special care to avoid adjudicating\ncases where Congress has not authorized them to do so.\nOr to put it another way, our legal system has\npresupposed that the unauthorized exercise of\njurisdiction is an error different in kind from the\nmisapplication of law in cases that a court is\nauthorized to adjudicate.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Stewart, do you think\nthis is subject -- that question is subject matter\njurisdiction?\nMR. STEWART: We would -- we would\ncharacterize it as a species of appellate jurisdiction.\nThat is, this Court has often said that it's the\nfundamental duty of this Court when doubt is -- when\ndoubt is apparent, to inquire into its own jurisdiction\nand that of the court from which the record comes. And\nthat division presupposes that there are cases over\nwhich the lower court had subject matter jurisdiction,\nover which this Court would not have appellate\njurisdiction.\nFor example, situations sometimes arise,\nparticularly in cases that are adjudicated by\nthree-judge district courts, in which there is a dispute\nas to whether a particular district court order is\ndirectly appealable to this Court or should go instead\nto the court of appeals. And if somebody comes to this\nCourt and this Court determines that the appeal should\nhave gone to the court of appeals instead, the error is\ncharacterized as one of appellate jurisdiction. This\nCourt lacks jurisdiction to review the ruling even\nthough there's nothing to suggest that the case as a\nwhole fell outside the subject matter jurisdiction of\nthe district court.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Stewart, that's one\nthose interesting examples. We lack jurisdiction of the\ncase but we have power to order it refiled, to vacate\nthe order and have it refiled, don't we?\nMR. STEWART: That is an anomaly. The Court\nhas said on occasion that because it lacks appellate\njurisdiction it has no power to do anything with the\ncase except to vacate the order. And I think that's a\ncourt that I'm not going to try to explain.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. STEWART: But I think Mr. Marshall has\nidentified the second example, namely the final decision\nrequirement of 28 USC 1291. That is, that's universally\nconceded to be a jurisdictional rule, even though it has\nnothing to do with whether the district court had\nsubject matter jurisdiction over the case. It is simply\nwhether this particular decision over -- for which\nreview is sought falls within the appellate jurisdiction\nof the court of appeals. And our point --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Stewart, should we\nrepudiate the unique circumstances doctrine?\nMR. STEWART: I don't think you need to -- I\nthink you should repudiate any conception that Federal\ncourts have freewheeling authority to excuse\nnoncompliance with statutory time limits for taking\nappeals.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the unique\ncircumstances doctrine is one circumstance in which\ncourts, say yeah, you can excuse it.\nMR. STEWART: Well, I -- I think actually\nboth Harris and Thompson are explicable on other\ngrounds. And may even be correct in more limited ways.\nFor example, Harris --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But on the grounds for\nwhich they have been taken as authority, is it your view\nthat we should repudiate those grounds?\nMR. STEWART: Yes. With respect to civil\ncases for which the time for taking an appeal is\nspecified by statute, it's our view to the extent that\nHarris and Thompson would otherwise support the\nproposition that district courts may excuse\nnoncompliance with the time limits, those cases should\nbe repudiated.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well -- in criminal.\nMR. STEWART: In criminal cases the time for\ntaking an appeal is not specified by statute. It's\nimposed by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b).\nBut there's no statutory basis for it. There was up\nuntil 1988 a provision of Title 18 of the U.S. Code,\nSection 3772, that specifically authorized this Court to\npromulgate rules that would establish the time for\nfiling a notice of appeal --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But in -- though of course,\nyou'd have to confine it very narrowly, I take that\ndoctrine, if there weren't a statute, you read it into\nthe rule. So there is a statute and you read the\nstatute as saying well there could be very some very\nnarrow circumstances that Congress would have been\nwilling to make an exception. For example it is a\ncouple of days and the judge tells you, \"do it\" or lets\nyou do it. It's roughly the same thing, isn't it?\nMR. STEWART: Well I think it makes a\nfundamental difference that there is a statute in place.\nAnd certainly with respect to circuit certiorari\npetitions coming from the court of appeals to this\nCourt, this Court has recognized that distinction to be\nfundamental.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're sure habeas\ncases are classified for this purpose as civil rather\nthan criminal?\nMR. STEWART: Yes, there's no -- no dispute\nabout that. And indeed if the -- if this case were\nclassified as civil for purposes of -- I mean, as\ncriminal for purposes of the time limit for taking an\nappeal, it would have been far out of time under Federal\nRule of Appellate Procedure 4(b). Indeed the authority\nof the district court to have granted the reopening\nperiod 180 days later wouldn't have been present in the\ncriminal context.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Looking at the rule,\nit does require these findings. Has that been\ninterpreted to require that they be written on the\nrecord or is that simply something that's supposed to\nguide the district court?\nMR. STEWART: I think the courts of appeals\nhave not required that they be written on the record but\nhave required that there be a basis appearing in the\nrecord for those findings. So, for instance, if\nPetitioner's counsel had filed a document asking to\nreopen in the time, but had not represented that he had\nnot been informed of the judgment, then I think that if\nthe court had granted the reopening, that could be set\naside on appeal on the ground that there was no support\nin the record for such a finding. But I don't believe\nthe courts of appeals have required there be explicit\nfindings as opposed to findings that are implicit in the\ngrant of the reopening.\nThe point I was going to make about the\ncertiorari petitions is that this Court's Rule 13.1\nimposes a 90-day limit for filing a cert petition in all\ncases. It is not divided between civil and criminal.\nBut this Court has recognized that the 90-day limit has\na very different status is criminal cases than in civil\ncases. That is Rule 13.2 of the rules of this Court\nstates that when a cert petition is jurisdictionally out\nof time, the clerk is directed not to file it. And Rule\n13.2 cites USC 21.01(c).\nSo the clear implication is that the Court\nrecognizes the time limit imposed by statute in civil\ncases to be a jurisdictional limit. And the crucial\npoint of Rule 13.2 is not simply that it uses the word\njurisdictionally. It's that it gives an instruction to\nthe clerk not to file the petition regardless of whether\nany other party objects. It's the very type of thing\nthat a court will do as to matters of its jurisdiction,\nas to matters over which it has an obligation to take\ncognizance, regardless of the other party's objection.\nIn criminal cases by contrast the 90-day\nrule applies under the rules, but the Court has\nrecognized that it retains the authority to grant\npetitions that are untimely filed even in cases where\nthe other party objects.\nThe other thing I would say about 2107(a)\nand it's -- part of it is reprinted at page 16 of the\nGovernment's brief. In the last full paragraph of page\n16, it says, the basic time limit for appeals in similar\ncases is set by 28 U.S.C 2107(a), which states that --\nand then the part we haven't reproduced says except as\notherwise provided in this section.\nAnd then it goes on to say no appeal shall\nbring any judgment order or decree in an action, suit or\nproceeding of a civil nature before a court of appeals\nfor review unless notice of appeal is filed within 30\ndays.\nAnd the significance of this provision, this\nlanguage, is it doesn't simply say a notice of appeal\nmust be filed within 30 days. Language like that would\nconceivably leave open the question of what happens if\nthe notice of appeal is untimely filed. This language\nactually says if a notice of appeal is not filed within\n30 days, the appeal will not bring the judgment --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it begins with the\nexception as provided in subparagraph (c).\nMR. STEWART: That's correct. So we're not\nsaying that the 30-day limit is absolute --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yeah.\nMR. STEWART: -- but we're saying that the\nrule specifies that if the various time restrictions are\nnot complied with, the appeal will not bring -- I'm\nsorry, the appeal shall not bring the judgment, order,\nor decree before the court of appeals. This is\nspecifically framed as a limitation on the authority of\nthe reviewing court.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What do you think, if we\ndid go to Thompson and looked at that, this would be a\nfortiori from Thompson, as described in Osterneck, was a\ncase in which the judge simply said from the bench look,\nyour -- your -- the new trial motion is timely, though\nit wasn't; it was out of by two days. While here, we\nhave a formal court order, it is a formal order entered\nwith a -- you know, stamp of the judge, and it says you\nhave till the 27th to file.\nMR. STEWART: Well, are two things we would\nsay about Thompson. The first is that as this Court\nexplained in its recent decision in Hibbs versus Winn,\nit's long been recognized that a timely motion for\nreconsideration will suspend the finality of the\njudgment and toll the time for taking an appeal. And\nthe Court in Hibbs versus Winn further explained that\nunder certain circumstances, even an untimely motion for\nreconsideration will have that effect, if the judge\nappropriately considers it on the merits.\nAnd Thompson can be explained as holding\nsimply that where the Government does not object and the\ndistrict court evinces an intent to treat the motion as\ntimely and consider it on the merits, it will suspend\nthe finality of the judgment I don't think Thompson has\nto read -- has to be read to stand for a broader\nequitable principle.\nThe other thing I'd say about Thompson is\nthat for better or for worse, the Government's brief in\nopposition in Thompson, and the case was decided on the\ncert papers, didn't cite 28 U.S.C. 2107; it relied\nexclusively on the time limit that was stated in the\nFederal Rule of Appellate Procedure. Therefore the\nCourt in Thompson was not required to grapple with\ncongressionally imposed limits.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nStewart.\nMr. Mancino, you have four minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL MANCINO, JR.,\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. MANCINO: If this were a case where\nsomeone just missed the 30-day deadline, I don't think\nwe would be talking. We are talking about a case where\na judge properly found, properly ruled that notice was\nnot given and had the authority to reopen the case. And\nwe talk about mandatory and jurisdiction of the case.\nAll that were involved in this case is how is the case\nmoved from one court to another.\nAnd the -- was it moved properly in this\ncase? The unique circumstances, I think you cannot find\na more compelling case for unique circumstances.\nDid the party rely upon the court? Here you\nhave a handwritten notation from the court, signed by\nthe judge --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Mancino, does the\nrecord tell us how you got notice of that order?\nMR. MANCINO: No, it doesn't. But I mean, I\ndid get notice of it. It came in the mail, but it\ndoesn't --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You, you got that order in\nthe mail?\nMR. MANCINO: In the mail, correct. And\nthat's why I believe the three days was added, thinking\nof the mail rule that we have three additional days to\ndo it in connection with the case. And that's how I\nbelieve the, how the 17 days came up.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I asked this once\nbefore: Did the document you received show the dates\nthat it was entered on the docket, so you knew when the\n14 days was running from?\nMR. MANCINO: No, the only information it\nhad was the printed -- the printed date by the judge.\nDid not show it was entered that same day.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, but in the -- in this\nthing, it says entered on February 10.\nMR. MANCINO: Yeah, that's correct. The\ndocket does show that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But how did you find out\nit had been entered on February 10? Because you did\nknow that at the time you filed your notice of appeal.\nMR. MANCINO: Well, I just went off what the\ndate on the -- the handwritten date on the pleading we\nreceived from the court. It said February 10, so we\njust put it in there. Didn't go to the actual docket to\nsee if, in fact, it was entered. As you can see, orders\nwere not -- in this case were not entered on date that\nthe judge signified anyway.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This is, this is all at\nthe top of page 151 of the joint appendix, right?\nThat's the that entire thing.\nMR. MANCINO: That is the -- well, it is\nprinted on that. But I mean, if you look at the\noriginal document --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. It was\nhandwritten --\nMR. MANCINO: It's a handwritten --\nhandwritten by the judge in, in the case. So --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But it says when it was\nsigned by the judge. It doesn't say when it was entered\non the docket, when it was entered by the clerk.\nMR. MANCINO: No. It says when the judge\nsigned it. That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But it says it in the\nindex, it says -- it says docket entries. 2-10, it says\nentered 2-10, on page 11. On page 11.\nMR. MANCINO: Yeah, that's correct. But\nthat's from the docket --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Received. So-\nMR. MANCINO: But the document we received\nfrom the Court just has -- you know -- the handwritten\nnotation on it, file your appeal by --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What would you, what would\nyou have had to have done to find out when it was\nentered on the docket? Could you have accessed that\nelectronically? Or would you have to go to the court,\nto --\nMR. MANCINO: Well, probably I could not\nhave -- at that time, I mean I could do it now, but at\nthat time you'd have to go over to the courthouse, just\nlike we walked on orders of appeal over to the\ncourthouse, had it stamped by the clerk there, and\nfigured that was the end of it and we were on our way to\nthe Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati. Thanks.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n"
