        "content": "(11:10 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Mohawk Industries v. Williams.\nMr. Phillips.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThis case involves the somewhat murky concept\nof an association-in-fact enterprise within the meaning\nof section 1961(4) of title 18, which is the RICO\nstatute, and actually the specific language in this\ncase, which is reproduced in the Petitioner's brief at\npage 2, is a group of individuals associated in fact.\nIn this case, there are two fairly obvious\nenterprises that one might have expected a plaintiff to\nidentify in this -- in its -- in their complaint. The\nfirst one is Mohawk Industries, which is their\nemployer. That is a corporation, clearly eligible to\nserve as an enterprise. But, of course, the problem is\nif you identify Mohawk as the -- as the enterprise, you\nthen cannot sue Mohawk as the person under this Court's\ndecision in Kushner. And so Mohawk was an unattractive\nenterprise under -- on that -- because of that reason.\nSecond, there are the recruiting and\ntemporary agencies which are likely corporations and\ncertainly are legal entities and, again, are eligible\nto be enterprises within the meaning of the statute.\nBut, again, here the problem is that there is no\nindication that Mohawk in any way directs or conducts\nthe affairs of those agencies, and therefore, under\nthis Court's explicit holding in Reves, there would no\n-- there would be no basis for liability.\nAnd so the plaintiffs have attempted to sort\nof move around those two substantial obstacles to\nstating a claim by laying the claim to what is called\nan association-in-fact enterprise. Their complaint at\nparagraph 76, which is on page 23 of the joint\nappendix, states this fairly broadly. Mohawk has\nparticipated in an association-in-fact enterprise with\nthird party employment agencies and other recruiters.\nThe question is what is this enterprise and\ndoes it have legs for purposes of bringing a RICO\naction. In analyzing that question, it seems to me\nthere are two subissues within that.\nThe first one is whether or not the language\nof section 1961(4) precludes using the corporation as\npart of an association-in-fact enterprise because\n1961(4) explicitly -- or specifically refers to\nindividuals, and everyone has recognized, including I\nthink the Respondents and the United States, that if --\nif it were clear that association-in-fact enterprises\nor that enterprises limited to individuals under these\ncircumstances, given the structure of the statute, the\ncorporation would not be permissibly brought in on this\nparticular theory. So you have to get past whether or\nnot that is a limiting principle under this definition.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If we were --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Before you get to your\nsecond point, why is that first point before us? You\n-- you didn't raise it in the courts below. You didn't\nraise it in your petition here. Your question\npresented it -- I'd like to stretch to reach it, but I\ndon't even find it necessarily included within the\nquestion presented. The question presented is whether\na defendant corporation and its agents engaged in\nordinary, arms-length dealings can constitute an\nenterprise in light of the settled rule that a RICO\ndefendant must conduct or participate in the affairs of\nsome distinct enterprise and not just its own affairs.\nIt seems to me it's only question two you put before\nus.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Scalia, the -- the\nanswer -- a couple answers.\nFirst of all, obviously, we could not have\nraised this before the -- either the district court or\nthe court of appeals because the law was absolutely\nsettled in the Eleventh Circuit.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: As it is in nine other\ncircuits.\nMR. PHILLIPS: As it is in nine other\ncircuits.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And all circuits against\nyou.\nMR. PHILLIPS: To be sure.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And we would have been\nunlikely to accept cert on -- on point one alone I\nthink.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nBut the second -- but the question is not --\nthe question is whether or not that issue is fairly\nsubsumed within the question that was actually\npresented, and that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I think it's -- it's a\nlittle more difficult in your case because you're\npursuing an interlocutory appeal, which you were\nallowed to do only because you've got double\ncertification and you got certification on the\nquestions that the district court addressed. You can't\nexpand a 1292(b) order to include things that were not\ndecided below.\nMR. PHILLIPS: The -- the question presented\nin this case -- and it's the same question that was\npresented below -- is whether the defendant corporation\nand its agents under these circumstances can constitute\nan enterprise.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In light of the settled rule\nthat a defendant must conduct or participate in the\naffairs of some distinct enterprise and not just its\nown affairs.\nMR. PHILLIPS: To be sure. But the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If you hadn't included that\nlast part, in light of, but it seems to me you're\nfocusing on the -- on the particular claim that you're\nmaking.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But, Justice Scalia, the in\nlight of certainly raises the secondary issue, but it's\nstill -- I mean, the rule is whether it's fairly\nsubsumed within the question. And it is a logically\nprior question whether or not the statute extends to\nthis particular situation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is logically prior, and I\nhate to go through all the trouble of figuring out this\ncase if, indeed, corporations are ineligible anyway. I\nmean, you know, we're -- we're answering a totally\nhypothetical, nonexistent question.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But the situation that's\npresented here is identical to the situation that\nexisted in McNally v. United States, Justice Scalia.\nIn that case, the question was whether or not an\nintangible rights theory of mail fraud could be\nextended to include nongovernment officials. That was\nthe specific question presented in that case, and\nthat's the -- the question the Court granted. And\nevery court of appeals had interpreted that statute to\nsay that intangible rights theories are valid under\nthat statute. And -- and that issue was not adverted\nto in the petition, and it was briefed in this Court --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And they weren't --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- and it was regarded as\nfairly subsumed just as --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- they weren't --\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- they weren't -- your\nproblem is you don't have a final judgment. The only\nway that you can get even to the court of appeals is on\nthat 1292(b) order. And I thought that the function of\n1292(b) was to say specify the questions that are so\nimportant that they have to be decided and appealed\nbefore there's a final judgment. And whatever there\nmight have -- whatever one might read into a question\npresented, I don't think that 1292(b) orders have ever\nbeen treated that way.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I -- I don't have any specific\nauthority to the contrary, although the other side\ndidn't argue 1292(b) as in some sense a limitation\nhere. And I don't see anything in this Court's rules\nwhich broadly authorize the Court to grant certiorari\nto any question that's fairly subsumed within the\nquestion presented. And it is a totally artificial\ninquiry to sit here and say, you know, how are we going\nto analyze what is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose we get through that.\nI see the artificial part. Just what is it? Piling\nPelion on something or other. Mountains that you pile\none on top of the other.\nBut your opponents have cited in your brief\n-- in the brief on page 12 that counsel for Mohawk said\nto the court, specifically, Mohawk agrees that a\ncorporation can be both a RICO person and part of an\nassociation-in-fact enterprise. Now, if we can\novercome all these other problems --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- what do we do about that\nparticular concession?\nMR. PHILLIPS: The -- the clause that\nintroduces that is under current law, and that's\nabsolutely true in the Eleventh Circuit. Under current\nlaw, as it existed in the Eleventh Circuit when we\nwrote that, there was no question that a corporation\ncan be included within an association-in-fact\nenterprise. Therefore, all we were doing was conceding\nwhat the state of the law was in the Eleventh Circuit\nand not questioning that, as -- as, candidly, we had no\nability to do that. It would have been an utterly\nfutile gesture to have raised this issue at any point\nprior to.\nWe could have raised it in the petition for\ncertiorari, to be sure. We -- we think it is fairly\nsubsumed within the question presented, and we also\nthink it would be an -- an utterly artificial exercise\nto try to analyze what is an association-in-fact\nenterprise without first deciding whether or not a\ncorporation could be included in the first instance\nbecause, as Justice Scalia says, if they can't, then it\nseems to me this is a substantially easier question,\nand also it is an extraordinarily important one.\nIt is true that the courts of appeals have\nlined up consistently on the other side of this issue,\nbut it is equally true that none of them has analyzed\nthis issue with anything near the kind of care that\nwould at least give me comfort that they've finally and\nfully resolved the issue. And we're not going to get a\nmore thorough vetting of it at this point because the\ncircuits are -- are at this -- at this stage\nessentially lined up. So the right time and\nopportunity for the Court is here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, unless somebody\nraises it. Unless somebody raises it below to preserve\nit for the rehearing en banc or -- or some other way.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But all of those courts are\ngoing to say the same thing, which is that this issue\nhas been resolved. It's possible, presumably, you\nmight get an en banc review on it, but again, you don't\nhave the question -- you don't have a split anywhere\nother than some district court decisions that have --\nthat have recognized our interpretation.\nThe issue is squarely posed here at this\npoint. It's been fully briefed for this Court.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what -- what sense\nwould it make on the merits to get your interpretation\non the merits, which would mean, I guess, that five\nindividuals could be an enterprise because that's a\ngroup of individuals.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, that's true.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Five labor unions couldn't.\nFive corporations couldn't. One individual and four\nlabor unions couldn't. One individual and four\ncorporations couldn't. One individual and three\npartnerships couldn't. And -- but what -- what sense\nwould that make?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Because all of those various\ncombinations can still be attacked under the theory of\nRICO by just simply structuring your -- your enterprise\nin the proper way. It is true you can't broaden it.\nYou can't expand the enterprise definition in order to\ninclude a variety of different elements, but there's no\nway -- I mean, in this case, for instance, they could\nhave named Mohawk as the enterprise. They could have\nnamed the -- the recruiting agencies as the enterprise.\nThey could have named the corporate officers as the\nenterprise, and they could have dealt with all of them\nas a conspiracy. And all of those are ways to get at\nprecisely the issues that you identify, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If -- if --\nMR. PHILLIPS: And the answer --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- if Mohawk were a\npartnership instead of a corporation --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the partnership is an\nassociation of individuals.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, a partnership is\nidentified specifically under the statute as a -- as a\n-- as an enterprise -- as eligible for an enterprise.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So if the answer is yes,\nif Mohawk had been a partnership, you would not have\nthis particular objection.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's correct. That wouldn't\nbe this particular --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So it's only the corporate\nform.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, no. If we were a\npartnership, it couldn't be in an enterprise with --\nwith an association of individuals. The question is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- does -- can you have an\nassociational enterprise that extends beyond\nindividuals, that gets -- that goes beyond the gangs\nand their family.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that's why I'm\nasking you about the partnership because it is an\nassociation of individuals. So I'm not clear on what\nyour answer is. No partnership could be treated just\nlike a corporation. They're not an individual? Or\npartnerships are okay because there's not a separate\nentity. It's a -- it's a association of individuals.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, let me be clear on this,\nthat if -- if you just bring an action against the\npartnership qua partnership you could clearly do that\nbecause that's defined as a -- as a legal entity --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No. Would the --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- for purposes -- if you're\ntrying to take the partnership and tag it to another\ngroup of rag-tag individuals, that would not be an\nenterprise in fact because that's not an -- an\nassociation of individuals. It's a partnership which\nhas an entity apart from the individuals.\nNow, if you disaggregated all of the\nindividuals within the partnership and called them\nindividuals and said that they group with another group\nof individuals, then, yes. I think if you could\ndemonstrate that there is the loose organization,\ncommon purpose, and all of the requirements for having\nan association-in-fact available, sure, that wouldn't\nbe any problem.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If this provision is\nexclusive, as you claim it is -- it's intended to be an\nexclusive definition, why -- why would they include\nunion, just union and individuals? What's magic about\na union that --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Because --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that is not equally magic\nabout a partnership or a corporation?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No. Well, because what they\nhave -- you have to go back to the original list. The\nlist starts off with individuals, corporations,\npartnerships, associations, and other legal entities,\nunions, which is in addition to that because it's not a\nlegal entity, or at least there was case law at the\ntime --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I see.\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- that it's not a legal\nentity. And then other associations.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This refers to a union that\nis not -- is not an association.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. This is just a union.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or any legal entity.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A union that is not --\nMR. PHILLIPS: It's just an additional item\nin the list.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- not a legal entity. I\nsee.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But why would they use\nincludes in that provision and means in other\nprovisions?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Because I think they viewed\nthose as absolutely synonymous, Justice Alito, and --\nand the reason I think that is because we know that in\nsome instances they use including but not limited to,\nwhich reflects that Congress recognized that includes\nin some contexts is an exhaustive listing, and I think\nthey thought in some contexts, meaning 1961(4), that it\nwas an exhaustive listing.\nAnd also, it's important to look at the other\ndefinitions of 1961(4), and I think this is the most\nimportant element of the other side's submission in\nthis case because they do no business with any of the\nother definitions. The Attorney General, the\ndefinition of property for forfeiture purposes, those\nare unquestionably exhaustive lists. At least, that's\nthe way I -- we argued it. They didn't respond to\nthat. And yet, those are introduced with the term\nincludes.\nSo it strikes me that the best contextual\nevidence of what Congress intended here was that\nincludes would be used exhaustively and that the use of\nindividuals of associated in fact would be used as a\nlimiting principle, not as part of an exhaustive\nprinciple that expands the scope of this beyond --\nbeyond -- into a realm where it becomes nothing but a\nmere conspiracy statute, which is what it is today\nunder this -- under this particular theory.\nThat's -- unless there are further questions\nabout the straight statutory interpretation question,\nthen I would go to the second issue, which is assuming\nthat corporations can, nevertheless, be involved in\nassociation-in-fact enterprises, does this state such a\nthing.\nAnd here, you have to go back to the Court's\nopinion in Reves, and in Reves, what the Court held is\nthat liability depends on showing that the defendants\nconducted or participated in the conduct of the\nenterprise's affairs, not just their own affairs.\nOkay? So it is an element of RICO liability that you\nhave to distinguish the -- the corporate defendant's\naffairs in that case and -- and the affairs of the --\nof the enterprise in this case.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And don't they do that by --\ndon't the allegations do that here by claiming that the\ncorporation was manufacturing or providing false Social\nSecurity cards and was giving aid to the immigrants if\nthe -- the law got too close to them? I mean, that is\nnot merely the conduct by a corporation of the normal\nbusiness of hiring and employing people. Isn't that\nthe sort of extra that is alleged that takes this out\nsimply of the -- of the category of the -- of the\ncorporation conducting its own affairs?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Souter, that is the\nonly allegation that comes remotely close to suggesting\nanything along those lines, but I -- my submission to\nyou is that it doesn't get you there because what it\nsays is that the recruiters are sometimes assisted --\nit does say the recruiters -- by Mohawk employees who\ncarry Social Security cards which they use for\nprospective or existing employees' needs to assume a\nnew identity. That's when they come to Mohawk as\napplicants or as employees, Mohawk provides them with\nthis identification. That's the allegation. That's\nsimply Mohawk conducting its own affairs. That's not\nconducting or directing the affairs.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, maybe I misunderstood\nthe thrust of the allegation. I thought the thrust of\nthe allegation was that Mohawk was acting illegally in\nproviding phony Social Security cards.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I don't doubt that\nthere's a claim that -- that there's illegality. All\nof this is permeated with claims of illegality.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Doesn't -- doesn't that get\nthem at least to -- through the motion to dismiss, and\ndoesn't it at least get them to summary judgment?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I don't think so because even\nin Reves, the -- Ernst & Young had been found to have\nengaged in illegality, that there was -- that there was\nsecurities fraud involved there. So that's -- that\ndoesn't distinguish it. The fact of illegality would\nmake it a conspiracy, but it doesn't demonstrate either\nwhat the -- what the association-in-fact enterprise is\nand what are its affairs that are distinguished from\nthe affairs of the corporation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But in -- in Reves -- and if\n-- and -- and you -- you may well correct me on this\nbecause I'm -- I'm -- my memory is not precise. But I\nthought in Reves, in effect, what they did was to lie\nin the course of doing the sort of the thing that they\nnormally do. Here, the allegation is that they were\ndoing something, providing phony ID's, that employers\ndon't normally do. Isn't -- and, you know, maybe\nthat's a fine line, but is -- is it not a fine enough\nline to get it out of Reves and get it beyond the\nmotion to dismiss?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I don't think so, Justice\nSouter, because -- because the -- it's a question I\nthink of abstraction. What we normally do is hire\nemployees and review their applications. Now, in that\nprocess, we've been alleged to engage in illegal acts\nby providing them with false identifications. But I\ndon't see how that's any different from the Reves\nsituation where the claim is that you're providing\nordinary auditing advice, but in the process you're\nlying. You're engaged in illegal activities. It seems\nto me it is precisely the same problem in both\nsituations.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, there is -- there is a\ncommon element of illegality, but the distinction is\nthat in Reves, you're supposed to be providing these\nservices, making out statements, et cetera, and you put\nthe wrong numbers in them.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Intentionally.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Whereas in -- in this case,\nan employer does not normally go about providing phony\nID's or any ID's for the people it hires. It says, who\nare you? What's your Social Security number? And --\nand there's -- there's an affirmative act here.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. Justice Souter, I\ndon't doubt that, but the question is what is the legal\nstandard in Reves. And Reves doesn't say, did you\nengage in illegality, and Reves doesn't say, can we\nmake out a claim of conspiracy. Reves says what you\nhave to demonstrate is that you are conducting or\ndirecting the operations or affairs of some entity,\napart from yourself. And here, all we're doing is\ngiving ID cards to our either actual or potential\nemployees.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In -- in -- yes, but you're\ndoing it in connection with a -- a joint recruitment\nactivity. In other words, the -- the agencies that you\nhire to get the workers up to the door are not going to\nsucceed very well if -- if all the workers are going to\narrive without any papers and without any -- any\nindication like a Social Security card and so on that\nthey can be part of -- of the legal work force. So\nthere's -- there's something extra being done both by\nthe -- the recruiters and by you, and the extra, in\neffect, is a -- a scheme to provide phony ID's that\nsuggest that these people are -- are lawful rather than\n-- than unlawful immigrants.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But that still doesn't seem to\nme, Justice Souter, to satisfy the Reves standard,\nwhich is not just that there has to be something more\nthan conducting your own affairs immediately, although\nthat's important, and I don't think that -- I don't\nthink you can show that -- either that we went beyond\nconducting our affairs or that the recruiters went\nbeyond conducting their affairs. All of these\nallegations break out that way.\nBut what Reves says you have to do is\ndemonstrate that you conducted or directed the affairs\nof whatever this association-in-fact entity is.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so that if you\ncharged --\nMR. PHILLIPS: And that's the part that's\nmissing. I'm sorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that if you\ncharged the workers, you know, $10 for their fake ID\ncards, you think that would be a different case.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, I don't think either of\nthose --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because there, that's\n-- there, you -- you -- there's a separate enterprise\nbasically selling ID cards, and that's not part of\nMohawk's business. But if you're just hiring them the\nway you hire other employees, illegally as it's\nalleged, that's Mohawk's enterprise if there's some\nseparate illegal activity?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, see, under those\ncircumstances, I wouldn't have any problem calling\nMohawk the enterprise. I mean, that's the whole point\nof this. The -- the logical enterprise here is the\ncorporation. The question is do you go beyond that to\ncreate these completely artificial entities. I mean,\nyou know, this -- this associational enterprise doesn't\nexist except in the minds of the plaintiffs.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Phillips, I -- I tend to\nagree with that, but I -- I just hate to get the lower\ncourts into this business of determining when a\ncorporation is going beyond its business. Your -- your\ndiscussion with Justice Souter I think indicates how --\nhow hard that is, or some of the examples that the\nGovernment brings up, such as a drug company that --\nthat sells drugs illegally, violating the drug laws.\nIs that part of its business or not part of its\nbusiness? I -- I really don't -- don't want to buy\ninto that.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think it's a little\nlate in the day, Justice Scalia, because that is\nprecisely the standard the Court articulated in Reves.\nIt said the question is not do you -- are you -- are\nyou conducting the affairs of your own operation,\nhowever that's defined. But I'm not sure whether you\nneed to -- you need to define.\nI mean, you know, in some ways, this also\ngoes to why it -- it's a mistake to get into this in\nthe first place because if you just said it has to be\nindividuals associated in fact, you don't have to get\ninto any of this inquiry. You could obviate the need\nto evaluate all of these problems in one fell swoop.\nBut even assuming that you still want to live\nin this world, you still -- it seems to me you've got\nto identify what it is -- what -- what is the nature,\nwhat is the loose organization of this separate\nenterprise, and then what are its functions. And then\nyou have to evaluate how it is that the defendant is,\nin fact, operating or conducting or directing the\naffairs of that enterprise.\nAnd that's what's missing, Justice Souter, in\n-- in footnote -- or excuse me -- in paragraph 76\nbecause while it goes to -- you know, it says we paid\nfor illegal aliens to be employed. Okay, well, that --\nthat's clearly hiring. That's the first one.\nThe second one is they have temp agencies and\nthey pool their employees and they loan them to us for\na fee. Well, that's the business of temp agencies.\nThat's what they do. They transport employees to -- so\nthey'll have them available in their pool. That's not\n-- we don't direct any of that. We -- we are their --\nwe are -- it's an arms-length deal.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but I still think\nsooner or later we have to come back to something that\nyou and I went over a moment ago, and that is the --\none function, maybe the function, of -- of the -- of\nthe -- the entity claimed here is -- is providing cover\nfor the illegal status of the aliens. And it seems to\nme that there is at least a bare claim here that Mohawk\nis directing the affairs or the business of -- of this\nthird entity --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, the -- the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- by -- by the way that it\nis -- allegedly provides phony Social Security cards.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, according to the\nallegation in paragraph 77, it just says obtaining\nillegal workers. It doesn't say anything about\nproviding them with cover, that the common purpose of\nthis enterprise --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Where -- where do we --\nyou're going to have to help me out then. Where --\nwhere in the -- the pleadings or the -- the papers do\nwe get into the Social -- do we get the allegations of\nthe Social Security card?\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's paragraph 76.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. PHILLIPS: And that's a factual\nallegation. But -- but it -- but all I'm saying is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't that factual\nallegation, as a bare matter, sufficient to satisfy the\nobjection that you raise, that something more than\nmerely the activity -- the conduct of -- of their\nseparate business is going on?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, because what you still\nneed -- there's still a higher -- it's not just the\nhigher threshold that it's got to be something that\nmoves beyond what the corporation does. It has to\ninvolve the direction or the conduct of the operation\nof a separate entity.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if -- if, in fact, it\nis the case that Mohawk is -- is providing the Social\nSecurity cards, isn't it directing the means by which\nthe third -- the third entity is, in effect, illegally\n-- or supplying illegal workers in -- in this -- this\njoint enterprise?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, obviously, we're going\nto disagree about this I think, but at the end of the\nday, I think the bottom line is what we're doing is\nwhen the applicant shows up at our doorstep or when\nthey have, in fact, been hired, if for -- and this is\nthe allegation. Obviously, none of this is true. But\nthis is the allegation. That we then -- we then supply\nthose employees -- our employees and our applicants\nwith these false ID's. That's part of the process of\nour own hiring.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is it reasonable -- is it\nreasonable to suppose, on the basis reading the\nallegations as they have to be read at this stage of\nthe proceeding -- is it reasonable to infer that --\nfrom the allegation that there is an understanding\nbetween Mohawk and the employment agencies that Mohawk\nwill provide this documentation and therefore make the\nscheme work?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, it -- the allegation\ncertainly doesn't say that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It doesn't say that in any\n-- any black letter statement.\nMR. PHILLIPS: There is only one sentence in\nthe allegation that even remotely says anything about\nthis. And again, Justice Souter, the -- the fundamental\nassumption here is that if there's something that goes\nanywhere beyond our affairs, that that by itself is\nsufficient to take you out of Reves. And what I would\nargue strenuously is that what Reves says is you have\nto be conducting or directing the operations of the\nother entity's affairs. And providing this doesn't\nconduct or direct anything. It may -- it may be a\nconspiracy. It may satisfy some interrelationship, but\nI don't see how it gets you to the point of an existing\nenterprise.\nIf there are no further questions, I'd\nreserve the balance of my time, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nPhillips.\nMr. Foster.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD W. FOSTER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. FOSTER: Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nAs Mr. Phillips makes quite clear, Mohawk\ndoes not like the way the plaintiffs have written their\ncomplaint in this case. He would prefer -- they would\nprefer that the enterprise be Mohawk Industries and\ncertain individuals within the corporation be named\nas the RICO persons. But the plaintiffs write their\ncomplaint and the plaintiffs are the master of their\ncomplaint, and at this stage, as far as the case has\nproceeded, which is only up to a motion to dismiss,\nthat's what we are to deal with, whether this states a\ncause of action under RICO.\nThere seems to be no dispute in the lower\ncourts that corporations can form associations of fact\nwith other entities and that a corporation can be a\nperson conducting the affairs of such an entity. We\nhave alleged that here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There may be no\ndispute about it, but it does seem kind of strange to\nencompass them under the term individuals when the same\nstatute uses individuals and corporations separately.\nMR. FOSTER: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. But\nactually the term -- the definition of enterprise in\nRICO starts with the word includes and it also states\nany union or group of individuals associated in fact,\nthough not a legal entity.\nThe word union is not defined. According to\nMohawk, union should be interpreted to mean a labor\nunion, but that makes no sense structurally because the\nfirst part of that definition includes legal entities,\nand if reference were being made by Congress to a labor\nunion, then the union would have been inserted in that\npart of it because at the time RICO was written in\n1970, Congress had already enacted the Labor Management\nRelations Act of 1946, which made labor unions suable\nentities.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, do you agree that\nthat's an exhaustive list in subsection (4)?\nMR. FOSTER: I don't think it's an exhaustive\nlist, Justice Alito. It -- the Court has held in\nprevious cases that RICO used concepts and terms of\nbreadth. This would appear to be that, as the Court\nsaid in both H.J. v. Northwestern, Russello, and\nTurkette.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, would you agree that\nincludes is meant to be exhaustive in many of the other\n-- in a number of the other subsections of this\ndefinitional provision?\nMR. FOSTER: I -- I don't think so. I\nbelieve that the way includes is actually used, for\nexample, in the definition of Attorney General, opens a\nlong definition which is itself exhaustive, but leaves\nroom for change. Attorney General was written in a way\nthat allowed any official to be designated by the\nAttorney General to fall within that description.\nThere's room for designations and there's room for\nchange in the Justice Department as it occurs over\ntime.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see how your point\nregarding union helps you any because if -- if you --\nif you win the point that union doesn't mean a labor\nunion, you still have, as -- as the end of this\ndefinition, any union or group of individuals.\nMR. FOSTER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A union of individuals or a\ngroup of individuals. You're still stuck with\nindividuals.\nMR. FOSTER: Well, I think union is -- it\nsays union or group of individuals. I think union is\nsomething --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Either union means labor\nunion or it means a union or group of individuals.\nMR. FOSTER: I would -- Justice Scalia, I\ndon't believe that union means labor union because --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. FOSTER: -- if it meant a labor union\nthere --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'll give you that. Then --\nthen it means a union or group of individuals.\nMR. FOSTER: A union or group of individuals.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right. So, you know, you're\njust as bad off.\nMR. FOSTER: Well, the word individual is not\ndefined in the statute either, and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's not\ndefined in the statute, but the prior list in the same\nsentence says individual, partnership, corporation. So\nyou'd assume whatever an individual is it's different\nthan a corporation or they wouldn't have had to say\ncorporation again.\nMR. FOSTER: The enterprise alleged here, Mr.\nChief Justice, is actually not a single corporation.\nThat first list would not encompass a group of\ncorporations. A group of corporations is actually not\na single legal entity. It's a group of legal entities\nthat have combined to commit a pattern of racketeering\nactivity. It doesn't neatly fit into the first\ndefinition, which seems to encompass only single\nentities.\nAnd so every single circuit court in the --\nin the country to examine this question has held that\nCongress didn't expect, anticipate, or intend to\nexclude groups of legal entities from being -- being a\n-- a RICO enterprise. They were captured by the second\npart of the definition.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Still, it -- it -- you\nknow, we usually talk about person can mean a\ncorporation. This says individual. A person is\ndefined in -- in sub (3) just above it. A person\nincludes any individual or entity. Then the next thing\nsays individual. So it's not a -- it doesn't sound\nlike a corporation.\nMR. FOSTER: Well, the use of the word union\nor group of individuals seems to broaden it. The word\nincludes at the beginning of the definitional section\nbroadens it even further. As this Court held in\nfootnote 14 of the -- in the Sedima decision, the use\nof the word requires in that definitional section was\nkey to understanding what it meant, and it said\nrequires, in terms of pattern, meant more than simply\ntwo predicate acts. The word requires had to mean\nmore, and it had to be read in context. We think that\nthis should be read in context.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought your position\nwas it shouldn't be read at all because --\nMR. FOSTER: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- this -- this Court is a\ncourt of review, and to take a question that was never\ncertified, even to the court of appeals, to have this\nCourt address it seems to me very strange. It seems to\nme to erode rather starkly the final judgment rule,\nwhich we don't have here.\nMR. FOSTER: Well, I agree with that, Justice\nGinsburg. I don't think the Court should entertain the\nquestion at all. And --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what we're reviewing\nis a ruling, not a question. You certify a ruling.\nNow, it's usually set out for the court of appeals so\nthey know what the question is.\nMR. FOSTER: We are reviewing a ruling --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What you're reviewing here\nis a ruling.\nMR. FOSTER: It's a ruling. We're not\nreviewing a final judgment. All it is is a ruling. It\ncame to this Court and the question that this Court\naccepted for certiorari has actually been -- all but\nabandoned.\nMr. Phillips hardly used the word agent at\nall, if at all. He doesn't argue why his rule about\ndistinctness should be applied here. There is no\nallegation or he doesn't make any legal argument that\nthe members of this association-in-fact enterprise\nshould be deemed to be agents of Mohawk. That's not\nalleged in the complaint. That's not the way the\ncomplaint was written. They're all alleged to be\nseparate legal entities. They're -- for the motion to\ndismiss stage, that is enough to satisfy this Court's\nrequirement in Cedric Kushner that the members of an\nenterprise be distinct from --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is there\ndifferent about your proceeding to treat this as a RICO\nenterprise that isn't covered by normal corporate\ncriminal conspiracy law? What does RICO add here?\nMR. FOSTER: RICO does add more. It can't be\na mere criminal conspiracy to commit a single crime.\nThere needs to be an association of entities that\nassociate over a considerable period of time to meet\neither closed-ended continuity or open-ended and commit\na pattern of criminal acts that are related to each\nother, that go on for --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So they hire more\nthan one person.\nMR. FOSTER: They hired -- and the\nassociation itself, Mr. Chief Justice, would have to\nexist over a -- a significant period of time. There\nwould have to be -- there's this durational element --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is that different\nthan a normal contractual relationship that a\ncorporation is going to have with any number of\nsuppliers, vendors, agents?\nMR. FOSTER: Yes. Normal contractual\nrelationship is not to commit a felony, and if --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but I'm trying to\nsee what RICO adds to the normal conspiracy law --\nMR. FOSTER: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that would\notherwise be applicable. So we're assuming that the\narrangement is there and that they're engaging in\nillegal activity.\nMR. FOSTER: All right. And then we have the pattern\nand the durational aspect of it. And it has to affect\ninterstate commerce -- the enterprise does -- and in\norder to have a civil cause of action --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But Congress didn't\n-- to be fair, Congress did not enact RICO because it\nwas concerned that criminal conspiracy law, applied to\ncorporations, didn't adequately touch interstate\ncommerce. The whole point is that they had something\nsignificantly different in mind, and your allegations\nin the complaint seem to be fully met by application of\ncriminal conspiracy law.\nMR. FOSTER: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, a RICO\nenterprise among -- is a conspiracy to commit crime,\nbut it's conspiracy plus. The plus is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't -- isn't the plus\nsimply more than one act?\nMR. FOSTER: The plus is more than one act.\nThere has to be a pattern.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so -- no, but I mean\nliterally. As -- as long as -- as two illegal workers\nare going to be hired, isn't that sufficient to convert\n-- to go from conspiracy to -- to RICO on your\nanalysis?\nMR. FOSTER: There would have to be at least\ntwo, and there would -- it would have to go on to meet\nthe Court's pattern requirement. Two generally is held\nnot to be enough if it's a closed period of time that's\nover. But this complaint alleges an open period, and\ntwo would be enough, coupled with the allegation that\nthis is the normal way for the company to conduct its\nbusiness.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm trying to give\nyou a chance to explain why this looks like RICO rather\nthan just criminal conspiracy. And you've come up\nyou said interstate commerce. There's got to be more\nthan one. Well, none of that really suggests a\ndistinction. What -- what is it that makes this a RICO\ncase rather than just a criminal conspiracy case?\nMR. FOSTER: It's because we have a joint\nventure of entities operating over a long period of\ntime that have victimized a large number of people, and\nthere's a pattern of racketeering activity. And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's a pattern\nbecause they hired more than one.\nMR. FOSTER: They hired more than one. In\nfact, the statute requires 10 in a 12-month period.\nSo there would actually have to be 10 for at least 2\nyears. So that would mean at least 20 illegal aliens\nhave to have been hired under the 1324 section that's\nalleged in this complaint. And probably for more than\n2 years or an ongoing pattern of racketeering activity,\nand a person has to have been proximately harmed by a\npredicate act in order to assert a civil cause of\naction. Beyond that, there is the -- of course, the\nrequirement of Reves that the person -- and here the\ncorporation is participating in the affairs or\nconducting the affairs of an enterprise. And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but Reves demonstrates\nthat -- that your statement earlier that since it was\nfraudulent action, it couldn't have been the business\nof the corporation is simply false. We -- we haven't\nheld that whenever a corporation violates the law, it\ngoes beyond its business, although in a sense it does.\nIn Reves, we -- we said it didn't.\nMR. FOSTER: Here, Justice Scalia, there is,\nas was pointed out earlier in the dialogue with Justice\nSouter, a very close cooperation among Mohawk and these\nthird parties to get workers, to bring them from --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that, but\nthat's -- we have to get into that is my point. We\ncan't just say since providing them with -- with phony\nID's is unlawful, it can't be the business of the\ncorporation.\nMR. FOSTER: Yes, I agree. And I would\ncontend that there is enough factual detail and a\ndescription of the claim asserted in this complaint to\nsatisfy rule 8 to state a claim.\nAnd the type of factual inquiry that Mohawk\nhas suggested, that Mr. Phillips has suggested, saying,\nfor example, their test that Mohawk cannot be\nparticipating in the affairs of an enterprise that\ninvolves hiring because it itself involves hiring would\ndramatically change the interpretation of RICO. It\nwould mean that, for example, a drug dealer could not\nparticipate in a drug enterprise because he does what\nthe enterprise does.\nSince all corporations are engaged in hiring\nactivities, therefore, then no corporation or other\nbusiness entity could ever be prosecuted or sued under\nRICO because that -- there is overlap between what they\ndo and what an enterprise does, the -- if the\nenterprise is devoted to recruiting illegal workers for\na business. That just can't be what Congress had in\nmind, and it's not consistent with what this Court held\nin Turkette that a common purpose is required for there\nto be a RICO enterprise.\nIn conclusion, I do not believe that the\nCourt should address Mohawk's first point. I thought\nit was startling to return to that issue, that Mr.\nPhillips stated the reason that it was not raised below\nwas because he knew that they would lose and the Eleventh\nCircuit would rule against them. But, nevertheless, he\nwishes it to be addressed by this Court and simply\nbypass the court of appeal in the Eleventh Circuit. If\nthere's no split below, then the question would not\nhave been accepted for cert presumably, as has been\npointed out, and it should not be entertained now.\nFor the reasons stated, I believe that the\njudgment of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals\nshould be affirmed. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nAnd Mr. Stewart.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. STEWART: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nRespondents' complaint alleges that\nPetitioner has entered into a long-term, collaborative\nventure with outside recruiters in order to perpetrate\nhundreds, if not thousands of violations of Federal\nimmigration law. That sort of concerted, ongoing\nracketeering activity alleged in the complaint is\nencompassed by the text of 18 U.S.C. 1962(c) and it\ndirectly implicates section 1962(c)'s core purpose.\nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be\naffirmed.\nNow, with respect to the textual question,\nour argument is not that the collaborative venture\nalleged in this complaint falls within the terms of\nsection 1961(4). Our argument is that it falls within\nthe usual background understanding of the term\nenterprise and that it's not excluded from the statute\nby operation of 1961(4).\nTo take the first point first, if Congress\nhad not defined the term enterprise at all, but had\nused the term enterprise in section 1962(c), this --\nthe courts construing the provision would have had to\ndetermine whether the term enterprise was naturally\nencompassed -- was naturally construed to encompass not\nsimply discrete legal entities but collaborations between\ndiscrete actors. And I think it's pretty clear that\nthe term would have been construed to include such\nventures.\nThat is, the -- RICO was enacted against the\nbackdrop of the Travel Act which prevented the use of\nbusiness enterprises to perpetrate particular crimes\nand it was well established that a business enterprise\nmeant not simply a corporation or similar discrete\nlegal entity --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why shouldn't includes here\nbe read to mean means when that seems to be the way\nit's used in other subsections of this provision and\nwhen the only thing that seems to be -- if this is not\nan exhaustive list, the only thing that seems possibly\nto be omitted from the list is what's involved here,\nwhich is a group consisting of a corporation or other\nlegal -- other legal entity and -- and natural persons.\nMR. STEWART: I think there are several\nreasons.\nFirst, this Court's decisions make clear that\nwhile includes may be construed as exclusive, if it\nappears alone, when Congress employs the means/includes\nstructures -- structure and introduces some definitions\nwith the word means and others with the word includes,\nthat choice of verb should be taken as advertent, and\nthe Court shouldn't likely conclude that Congress\nsimply used the terms as interchangeable.\nSecond --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do -- do any of those cases\nthat you allude to that have means in some sections,\nincludes in others -- do any of them have in third\nsections, includes, comma, without limitation, comma?\nMR. STEWART: No, but the -- the includes --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I think that's a big\ndifference.\nMR. STEWART: I think it would be a big\ndifference if the phrase, including but not limited to,\nappeared in another provision of 1961, but that's not\nwhere the phrase appears. The phrase appears in, I\nbelieve it's, 1964(c) which deals with the -- the civil\nremedies provision, and where --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Close enough.\nMR. STEWART: -- where the word includes\nstood alone within that section, it was natural for\nCongress to use what we call a -- a belt and suspenders\napproach, making it clear that the word includes\nshouldn't be taken as exclusive.\nThe second point I'd make is that the last of\n-- I believe it's the last provision of 1961(4) is the\ndefinition of pattern of racketeering activity. And\nthat definition is introduced by the word requires.\nThe term pattern of racketeering activity requires at\nleast two racketeering acts committed not more than 10\nyears apart. And this Court in Sedima and then in H.J.,\nIncorporated has attached significance to that choice\nof verbs and has explained that Congress' use of the\nword requires, rather than the verb means, implies that\ntwo are necessary but not necessarily sufficient. So\nwhen we're construing a provision in which the Court\nhas already recognized that, at least in some\ninstances, Congress' use of varying verbs to introduce\nthe different subsections will be taken as significant\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but if we're trying to\nthink of what they were getting at, it's possible that\nCongress was worried about organized crime taking over\nthe pizza parlor or taking over a trades union or\ntaking over a similar kind of enterprise. So that's\nwhat they're thinking about.\nNow, if we're thinking about that, they put\nin the word groups of individuals because they\nunderstand that organized crime could take over a group\nof individuals. Now, once you do that, you RICO-ize\nvast amounts of conspiracy law.\nMR. STEWART: Well, I don't think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But -- but they had no\nreason whatsoever for doing the same thing for what we\nhave are associations of trade unions with each other\nor associations of -- of corporations with each other.\nAnd to do that, adding that in when it doesn't say\nthat, would RICO-ize, with its treble damages and\nprivate plaintiffs and everything, vast amounts of\nordinary commercial activity, not ordinary only in\nthat, but importantly, a certain amount of criminal\nactivity like passing bad checks or fraudulent behavior\nis involved. But Congress wouldn't have wanted to --\nthat has not to do with organized crime. That does not\nhave to do with taking over legitimate enterprises.\nSo read this, I think he's saying, to mean\nwhat it says most naturally. They're worried about\ngroups of individuals. They're not worried about\ngroups of corporations or groups of trade unions\ninteracting with each other.\nAnd I'm trying to put the argument the other\nway, and I wanted see what you respond.\nMR. STEWART: I mean, in terms of speculation\nabout Congress's motive, I think you're very likely\nright that the reason Congress added a specific\nreference to groups of individuals was that they were\nthinking in terms of mob families or syndicates,\ncriminal gangs that had no discrete status as a legal\nentity. They're not incorporated, but they function as\nunit. And they had those in mind, and they intended --\nthey wanted to make sure those were covered even though\nthey were not discrete legal entities.\nAnd I think you're likely right that the\nreason they didn't specifically include groups of\ncorporations is that they didn't have them in mind as\nlikely sources of trouble at the time. But that\ndoesn't answer the question whether they intended to\nexclude the coverage of those alliances if they would\notherwise be encompassed by the normal meaning of the\nterm enterprise. And if it came to cause the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're -- you're willing to\ngo this far with them. You say take those words,\ngroups of individuals, and throw them away. And you're\nsaying after we throw them away, they're still covered,\nand the reason that they're still covered is even\nthough the word enterprise includes any individual,\npartnership, corporation, the word enterprise also\nincludes groups of legal entities, groups of trades\nunions, groups of associations, even without that word\ngroup of individuals.\nMR. STEWART: Exactly. If -- if the term\nenterprise appeared in 1962(c) but were an undefined\nterm --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, is there\nany indication in the legislative history or anywhere\nelse in the statute that this meaning of the word\nenterprise is what is intended, that is, that this\nmeaning of the word enterprise went beyond what it says\nhere, excluding group of individuals?\nMR. STEWART: There -- there is in the\nlegislative history. That is, the legislative history\ndescribes the coverage of the term enterprise as\nencompassing any associative group.\nNow, we don't contend from that stray\nreference that Congress specifically had in mind\nalliances between corporations and specifically\nintended to include them. What we do contend is that\nthat legislative history is inconsistent with the\nhypothesis that Congress anticipated the problem of\nalliances of corporations and carefully --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Stewart, this -- this\nthing is at least -- at least -- ambiguous. Why\nshouldn't we apply the rule that we normally apply with\nregard to criminal statutes that where there is an\nambiguity, the rule of lenity applies and we shouldn't\ngive the -- the Government license to -- to ride closer\nherd than -- than is clear in the statute? Why isn't\n-- why isn't that an easy way to --\nMR. STEWART: First, I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- resolve this question?\nMR. STEWART: -- I don't think that at the\nend of the day, after all the tools of statutory\nconstruction are applied, there is a genuine and\ncertainly not a grievous ambiguity. That is, there --\nthere are two potential sources of ambiguity. One\ncould simply be there's uncertainty about whether the\nword enterprise, taken alone, would typically be\nconstrued -- nobody is contending --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's irrelevant because\nit's not taken alone. It is defined. So the only --\nthe only question is what this -- what this definition\nmeans. Is it exclusive or not exclusive? That's\nreally the only issue.\nMR. STEWART: The -- the only question is\nwhether this list should be taken to exclude things\nthat are not on the list even though they would\notherwise be encompassed by the normal meaning of the\nword enterprise. And this Court in many decisions has\ngiven Congress a template. It said if you use the\nmeans/includes dichotomy, we will take that choice to\nbe advertent and we will assume that when you use means\nthat's intended to be exclusive; when you use includes,\nthat's intended to be not exclusive.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even -- even when it's\nabsolutely clear and -- and as pointed out by -- by\nyour friend, you -- you did not refute the point that\nin other sections where it says includes, it is\nunquestionable that it is exclusive.\nMR. STEWART: That -- that was part of\nJustice Alito's question, and I think there are two\ndifferent senses in which a statutory list could be\nconsidered exclusive or comprehensive. That is, one\nwould be legal exclusivity. For instance, the\ndefinition of racketeering activity says racketeering\nactivity means acts indictable under the following\nstatutes. That definition is legally exclusive in the\nsense that if -- if Congress enacted a new statute and\nit prohibited conduct that was classic mob activity,\nbut it wasn't on the list of RICO predicates, we would\nsay that's out, it's not racketeering within the\nmeaning of the statute even though it would be\nracketeering activity within a common understanding.\nI think with the definition of Attorney\nGeneral, what we have is a different sort of\ncomprehensiveness. That is, it may well be that the\ndefinition of Attorney General is comprehensive in the\nsense of actually listing all the people who could\notherwise plausibly be regarded as standing in the\nshoes of the Attorney General. It may be that\nCongress, when it promulgated the list, got everything\nthat would have been covered anyway. It's not legally\ncomprehensive or legally exclusive in the sense of\ndirecting courts that even an official who would\notherwise be regarded as an appropriate surrogate for\nthe Attorney General is not to be so regarded if he's\noff -- off the list.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, a State attorney -- a\nState attorney general wouldn't fall within subsection\n10. Would -- would that be the case?\nMR. STEWART: I -- I agree with that, but I\ndon't think that in the context of a Federal statute\nreferring to the Attorney General, a State attorney\ngeneral would typically be encompassed within the\nmeaning of that provision even if the provision were\nundefined, whereas I think because executive power is\n-- is generally deemed to be delegable, subordinate\nofficials standing in the shoes of a cabinet officer\nwould usually be thought to be encompassed by the\nreference to the cabinet officer alone.\nThe other thing we would say, of course, on\nthe -- the statutory point is that there have -- there\nhas been a unanimous pattern of court of appeals\ndecisions in this area. Congress has not acted to\ncontract the definition of enterprise, but instead has\nadded new predicate acts.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's the best court of\nappeals opinion, the most thoroughly considered? I\nhaven't read any of them. Tell me -- tell me the best\none. I'd like to read it.\nMR. STEWART: I've looked at them and -- I\nwould agree with Mr. Phillips that the analysis doesn't\ntend to be lengthy, but I think Feldman would be one.\nBy and large, the -- the courts adopt the -- the\nreasoning that we've adopted here, namely that because\nthe word includes signals an intent to be nonexhaustive\nor to admit of other things being covered even if\nthey're not on the list, then they should be covered.\nThe --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Are there any dissents in\nany of those cases?\nMR. STEWART: I don't recall any dissents at\nleast on the point. I -- I don't want to represent\nthat there have never been any. I don't recall any\ndissents at least on the -- the pure question of\nwhether an association in fact comprised in part of\nartificial legal entities can ever be covered.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do any of the court of\nappeals opinions deal specifically with the peculiarity\nof this definition in which, although it starts out\nwith the word includes, then follows a -- a listing, A,\nB, C, and D, and then it repeats one, but only one, of\nthe items on the list and says groups of these items,\ni.e., individuals, are included? That's the\npeculiarity of the definition. Do any of the courts of\nappeals come to grips with that?\nMR. STEWART: I don't know of any court of\nappeals opinion that really focus on that -- focuses on\nthat aspect of the question.\nBut -- but, again, we can accept kind of the\nfactual premises about what led Congress to draft the\nlegislation as it did, namely that it anticipated the\nproblem of groups of individuals banding together to\ncommit criminal acts and didn't anticipate the problem\nof groups of corporations banding together for like\npurposes.\nBut I think the whole point of having a\ntemplate, having an established rule that means and\nincludes, when they're used in the same statutory\nprovision will be taken as meaning different things, as\nto give Congress a clue that if you've tried to list\neverything but you're not sure that you've got it all,\nhere's the way that you can ensure that some new\narrangement that would otherwise fall within the\ndefined term is not going to be knocked out, and if you\nwant it to be knocked out, use the words means.\nWith respect to the second argument, that the\n-- the core of Petitioner's position is that it can't\nbe held liable under RICO because it's simply\nconducting its own business, and I think that's wrong\nfor two reasons.\nFirst, there's no rule that says a\ncorporation can't simultaneously in a single act be\nconducting its own business and the business of a\nseparate enterprise, and I think H.J., Incorporated is\nan example of that. The allegation in that case was\nthat a utility corporation and its officers had engaged\nin a systematic pattern of bribing the members of a\npublic utility commission to allow the corporation to\ncharge higher rates. And the suit was allowed to go\nforward on the theory that through the pattern of\nbribery, the utility was, in practical terms,\nparticipating in the conduct of the public utility\ncommission's affairs.\nNow, clearly in attempting to bribe the\nutility commission members, the utility was, in a\nsense, conducting its own business. That is, viewed at\na high level of generality, efforts to persuade rate-\nsetting bodies to allow a utility to charge higher\nrates are an integral part of the utility's own\nbusiness. That didn't prevent it from simultaneously\nbeing a means of participating in the conduct of a\ndifferent entity's business.\nAnd second, there's more alleged in this\ncomplaint, and I think some of the questions brought\nthis out. May I finish my sentence?\nThere's more alleged in the complaint than\nsimply the unlawful hiring of illegal aliens. There\nare hiring inducement and transporting offenses that\nwould constitute separate violations that are\nantecedent to but not part of Mohawk's business.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Phillips, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nJustice Ginsburg, let me -- let me try to\njustify having this issue before the Court. First of\nall, 1292(b) has never been as narrowly confined as you\nsuggest, and indeed, in this case, you know, what\nyou're entitled to do is to bring up any issues related\nto the challenged order. And in this case we not only\nraised the RICO issue, but we also raise State law\nissues in the -- in the Eleventh Circuit which were not\nwithin the specific grant and were entertained by the\nEleventh Circuit because that's the standard.\nAnd then once you get past that, Justice\nKennedy is absolutely right. The issue is whether\nthere's an order to be reviewed. There is no final\njudgment rule on claims coming out of the Federal\ncourts of appeals, and therefore, it's -- it's\nabsolutely fair game. And the issue is I -- I submit,\nfairly subsumed within the question presented.\nJustice Souter, you know, with respect to the\nID cards, I think it's very important to recognize that\nfor us to do our business, we have to have an ID card\nin order to fill out the forms necessary to satisfy the\nimmigration laws. So that -- you know, those ID cards\nadd nothing to the -- to the conduct of our business.\nAnd, you know, Mr. Stewart just suggested\nthat, well, but you know, we do go beyond that and that\nH.J. allows some a -- a different analysis of this\nparticular point. But H.J. preceded Reves. This Court\nheld in Reves that you have to distinguish between the\nactivities of the enterprise and the activities of the\ndefendant and -- and they've never made any effort to\ndo that. All they do is suggest we've engaged in\nwrongdoing, that our third party recruiters engaged in\nwrongdoing, and that we're a conspiracy. There's\nnothing in there that remotely suggests that there is\nan existing enterprise.\nWith respect to the question of how to\ninterpret this particular statute, Justice Scalia is\nabsolutely correct that at the end of the day, this is\nat most an ambiguous provision, and if it's an\nambiguous provision, we ought to be entitled to the\nrule of lenity. I didn't hear any adequate answer to\nJustice Kennedy's specific question about why do they\nuse person in the subsection just ahead of it, if they\nreally meant to embrace everything here.\nAnd it's no answer to say, well, enterprise\nis a term that could be -- that has a general\nbackground. Enterprise is the linchpin of this\nstatute. The notion that Congress didn't mean to very\nspecifically and explicitly define enterprise here is\nabsurd. Of course, it defined it, and it provided a\nvery specific and detailed definition. And it's not\nfree for the Government or for anyone else then to come\nhere and shunt aside that definition and say, well,\nwe're just going to deal with background principles.\nThe truth is they're trying to write out of\nit groups of individuals acting in association. That\nlanguage is there. It was put there for a reason. The\nGovernment concedes that it didn't -- that it never --\nthat Congress never had this issue in mind. How it can\nbe then that this is not at least sufficiently\nambiguous that you should construe it in our favor\nstrikes me as -- as very difficult to understand.\nAnd finally, I don't -- I've never heard the\nexpression RICO-ize before, Justice Breyer, but I -- I\nembrace it wholeheartedly because that is precisely\nwhat we're talking about here. These are enormous\npenalties that are imposed, and it's a statute that\nthis Court has recognized in the past, even on its own\nterms, is very broad. Certainly there is no reason to\ntake those terms and RICO-ize the -- the breadth of\ncorporate activity that the plaintiffs' complaint in\nthis case would -- would allow. The Court should\nreverse the decision below and dismiss this complaint,\njust as the Seventh Circuit did.\nIf there are no further questions, thank you,\nYour Honors.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nPhillips.\n"
