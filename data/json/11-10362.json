        "content": "(10:25 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Case 11-10362, Millbrook v. United\nStates.\nMr. Paolella.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. PAOLELLA,\nFOR PETITIONER, APPOINTED BY THIS COURT\nMR. PAOLELLA: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe plain language of Section 2680(h) is law\nenforcement provides a waiver of sovereign immunity in\nclear, precise and unambiguous terms. It extends the\nwaiver to any claim for one of the six enumerated torts\ncommitted by a Federal investigative or law enforcement\nofficer acting within the scope of his or her\nemployment.\nAnd it defines investigative or law\nenforcement officer as any officer of the United States\nwho is quote, \"empowered by law,\" unquote, to carry out\nsearches, seizures or arrests.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would that include, say,\na meat -- a meat inspector? There is a wide range of\nFederal employees that have arrest or search or\nseizure --\nMR. PAOLELLA: The proviso doesn't any\nemployee of the United States who is authorized to carry\nout a search, seizure, or arrest. It used the term \"any\nofficer of the United States.\" And I believe that the\nterm \"officer\" carries some water here. If we look at a\nspectrum of individuals who have powers -- for example,\nto carry out searches -- we can envision on the one hand\nvery traditional core of law enforcement officers.\nLet's take a DEA officer who can carry out\narrests, do searches and seizures, is authorized to use\nforce. At the other end of the spectrum, we have\nsomething like a meat inspector or an OSHA inspector,\nwho may have a limited ability to carry out searches,\nbut these are searches that are in really a law\nenforcement capacity -- an administrative capacity as\nopposed to a core law enforcement capacity.\nSo the government raises the argument, and\nwe think it's a plausible interpretation, that by using\nthe term \"officer\" rather than any employee of the\nUnited States, that there was some limiting factor\nimported into the statute, thereby the statute's plain\nlanguage.\nAnd I would trust my colleague from the\nSolicitor General's office to map the boundaries of\nthat. I would say that in any case, a correctional\nofficer, who are the individuals who are involved here\nin committing the complained-of acts, certainly falls\nmuch closer to core law enforcement on that spectrum\nthan to the administrative side.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: As a general matter, first\nin the States and then in the Federal Government, is a\ncorrectional officer or prison guard usually deemed to\nbe a peace officer?\nMR. PAOLELLA: The -- yes. In many States\nthat use the term \"peace officer\" in the statutes\ndefining a peace officer for things -- for example,\nauthorizing the use of force or authorizing the carriage\nof weapons -- many States -- it's not uniform, but many\nStates include correctional officers within that ambit.\nThe Federal Government typically does not\nuse the term \"peace officer\" in its statutes, but if you\nlook at Federal statutes that use the term \"law\nenforcement officer,\" which is the very term that's used\nin subsection (h), many -- many of those other statutory\nschemes expressly include correctional officers. So,\nfor example, for purposes of civil service pay, for\npurposes of death benefits, of retirement benefits.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't prove that\nthey're officers. I mean, that's -- that's not the test\nfor an officer, how much you're paid. The test is\nwhether you exercise significant authority under the\nlaws of the United States. That's a pretty fuzzy line,\nbut I'm not sure that a prison guard exercises\nsignificant authority under the laws of the United\nStates.\nMR. PAOLELLA: I would think in the context\nof the prison, it's hard to imagine how a prison guard\ncould exercise any more authority than they do. In\naddition to their correctional function, prison\ncorrectional officers are essentially the police force\nfor the prison.\nThey are charged with maintaining order, and\nthey're charged with enforcing the laws of the United\nStates within the confines of the prison, and indeed in\nsome specified cases, outside the prison walls. For\nexample, they are explicitly authorized under Section\n3050 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code not just to carry out\narrests in prison for violations of Federal law, both by\nprisoners and visitors, but to carry out arrests outside\nthe prison walls to prevent prisoner escapes or to\nprevent assaults on other law enforcement officers. So\nthere's quite expressly an arrest authority granted to\ncorrectional officers. In addition, they have the power\nto search for contraband, both in the context of\nvisitors to prison and prisoners themselves.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, you've argued\nsomething slightly different than I took from your\nbriefs. Earlier, in response I think to\nJustice Ginsburg, you were queueing closer to the\nSolicitor General's position that this has to be limited\nin some way. And you said you'll let them establish the\nboundaries. I don't want to let them establish the\nboundaries.\nI want you to tell me, is it criminal law\nenforcement agents, is it law enforcement agents with --\nacting -- as the Ninth Circuit says -- acting within a\nlaw enforcement activity? Because I am finding it hard\nto figure out why we shouldn't permit tort liability on\nan OSHA inspector, who, in inspecting whatever he or she\nis inspecting punches someone or does some intentional\nassaultive act, why they should be permitted to do that.\nAssuming it falls within the definition of a law\nenforcement activity.\nMR. PAOLELLA: Justice Sotomayor, let me\nbegin answering that question by making a distinction\nwhich I think is an important distinction here, between\nthe definition of status and the definition of the\nconduct that's implied here. Because I think this is a\ncrucial difference between the amicus's argument on one\nhand and the Solicitor General's office on the other\nhand.\nThe amicus would limit the type of conduct\nthat's covered by the statute. They would limit it to\nactions that occur in a law enforcement capacity. So\nI'm not sure exactly what that means. I think that gets\npassed along with ---\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I think they're saying\nis arrests, search and seizure, and whatever the third\nwas.\nMR. PAOLELLA: Or some other similar\nactivities, which, again, I'm not sure addresses the\ntopic --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But let's define it more\nbroadly. Let's assume I was willing to define it to\ninclude all of the activities that a law enforcement\nagent would engage in, including protective services,\nsecurity services, like your officers.\nMR. PAOLELLA: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's assume that we've\ndefined it more broadly. What's the problem with their\nposition?\nMR. PAOLELLA: The problem with their\nposition is -- with the amicus --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And of -- yes, with\namicus's or the government's, meaning, instead of\nlimiting it to criminal activity, limited to law\nenforcement activities broadly defined.\nMR. PAOLELLA: The problem with amicus's\nrequirement is that it has no textual basis in the\nstatute. The statute is very precise.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I will give you --\nI'll give you a textual basis. Why is it if all the\nstatute is concerned about is the status of being a law\nenforcement -- investigative or law enforcement\nofficer -- why is it that the exception it makes does\nnot eliminate the exemption for libel, slander,\nmisrepresentation, deceit or interference with contract\nrights?\nThere is excepted from the provisions of the\nTort Claims Act any claim arising out of assault,\nbattery, false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious\nprosecution, abusive process, libel, slander,\nmisrepresentation, deceit or interference with contract\nrights.\nHowever, for -- for purposes of this\nexemption from the exemption -- the exception from the\nexemption, they leave out the latter part. Why did they\nonly put in the others? I think the reason they only\nput in the others is that those are the kind of torts\nthat would be conducted in the course of conducting a --\nwhat's the words -- investigative or law enforcement\nactivity.\nMR. PAOLELLA: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The others would not --\nwould not occur.\nMR. PAOLELLA: I think that that is a\nlimiting factor that is not just implicit but explicit\nin the statutory text.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but it's -- it's a\nlimiting factor that -- that shows, that displays an\nintent to limit the -- the activities of investigative\nor law enforcement officers to those activities\nconducted in the course of investigating or enforcing\nthe law.\nMR. PAOLELLA: Well, the fact that Congress\nwas so explicit about categorizing precisely the kind of\ntorts that are covered here -- that sort of conduct --\nand the fact that Congress was so precise about\ncross-referencing Section 1346(b), which incorporates of\nthe scope of employment requirement, suggests to me that\nwhen Congress wanted to confine the capacity in which\nthe acts occurred, it could do so, and it did in fact do\nso.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I understand --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why would it leave out\nthose other ones? That's what I'm asking you. What\npossible reason is there to leave out libel, slander,\nmisrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract\nrights?\nMR. PAOLELLA: That was the policy judgment\nthat Congress made, that it would not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I didn't deny that\nit's the judgment. What reason could there be for that\njudgment?\nMR. PAOLELLA: That it didn't think that\nthose sorts of torts in this context -- and I think we\nall agree this is a law enforcement-oriented provision.\nIt's called the law enforcement proviso.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I give you a reason.\nMR. PAOLELLA: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The reason -- the reason\nthey left it out is that they don't think those torts\nwould be committed in the course of investigating or\nenforcing the law.\nMR. PAOLELLA: I think that's right,\nYour Honor, but that doesn't mean that from that we\nought to draw an entirely extra-textual additional\nlimitation that goes beyond the specific line that\nCongress did, in fact, draw here.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Your view is that the\nlimitation is scope of employment.\nMR. PAOLELLA: That's right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The scope of employment\nis, and you don't add on anything else to that. You\ndon't add arrest, search and seizure.\nBut does this whole issue have an academic\nflavor, because how in the world could the conduct\ninvolved in this case qualify as within the scope of\nemployment?\nMR. PAOLELLA: First of all, Your Honor, I\nthink that the question of scope of employment was\nsomething that was conceded below. It was never\nlitigated. It was never briefed before the Respondents'\nbrief. And from my reading of the question presented as\nthis Court formulated it, it was excluded from the\nquestion presented. So I don't think this Court needs\nto address it. It's more properly addressed on remand\nif it's important.\nBut here I think that there is an argument\nthat's within the scope of employment. And if you look\nat cases, for example the Mary M. case out of the\nCalifornia Supreme Court, there the California Supreme\nCourt held that a sexual assault by a law enforcement\nofficer of an individual who was subject to that\nofficer's authority could be held to be within the scope\nof employment, because an officer is vested with\nauthority and it is reasonably foreseeable that that\nauthority can sometimes be abused if it happens when the\nofficer is in uniform, on job hours, dealing with\nsomeone who that individual is authorized to use\nappropriate force against.\nAnd even in Pennsylvania, you see cases\nwhere people do outrageous things, like a private\ndetective shooting a picketing protester, where the\nPennsylvania courts have held that that's within the\nscope of employment.\nIt's a complicated issue. It's an issue of\nState law and it will be different in every State, which\nis why I would suggest it's more appropriate for this to\nbe handled on remand rather than have a ruling by this\nCourt on a narrow issue of Pennsylvania State law. But\nI think it is hardly implausible that Pennsylvania\ncourts would find this within the scope of employment.\nYour Honor, if there's no further questions,\nI will reserve the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Yang.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG,\nFOR RESPONDENT, SUPPORTING REVERSAL AND REMAND\nMR. YANG: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe text and structure of the law\nenforcement proviso in the Federal Tort Claims Act more\ngenerally make clear that the proviso unambiguously\nwaives sovereign immunity for claims arising under the\nsix intentional torts listed for acts or omissions of\npersons qualifying as Federal law enforcement officers\nwhile acting within their scope of employment.\nNothing in the statute supports amicus's\nadditional limit, which would require such officers to\nbe acting in a law enforcement capacity or by exercising\nlaw enforcement authority, neither of which phrase\noccurs within the statute itself. Quite the contrary --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: What are the kinds of\nthings, Mr. Yang, that would be within the scope of\nemployment, but would not be acting within a law\nenforcement capacity for a law enforcement officer?\nWhat's the difference between those two standards for a\nlaw enforcement officer?\nMR. YANG: Well, this is complicated by the\nfact that for the Federal Tort Claims Act, scope of\nemployment is a question that turns on State law. As a\nresult it will vary. Some States have a rather broad\nunderstanding of scope of employment and sometimes in\nfact will encompass within the scope of employment\nrather egregious intentional torts. It's not\nnecessarily what the Court might think of as within the\nscope of one's Federal law enforcement authority.\nSo with respect to law enforcement\nauthority, I mean, this -- that makes the question a\nlittle more difficult because that is not something that\nactually appears in the statute and it's not something\nthat the United States embraces as a test because it is\na creation of the amicus.\nWhat the statute here does, the only term --\nthe only place that it uses law enforcement is in the\ndefined term \"investigative or law enforcement officer\"\nand then what it does in defining that term --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But you can't give me just a\ncouple of examples of how the difference would matter,\nyou know, in some States, where something would be --\nwould meet the scope of employment test, but not meet\nthe acting as a law enforcement officer test, for a law\nenforcement officer again.\nMR. YANG: Again, acting as a law\nenforcement officer test is not something that appears\nin the statute and it's not something that even amicus\nhas tried to meet the limitations of. It could mean\nvarious things. It could mean, for instance, something\nas limited as executing a search, seizing evidence or\nmaking an arrest. That would be the Pooler type of\nrationale.\nIt could be something incident to that,\nwriting a report, as amicus suggests. It could be other\nthings. Law enforcement officers often aren't doing the\nvery things that we're talking about. They go on\npatrol, they talk to kids in schools. There are all\ntypes of things that law enforcement officers might do\nthat don't fall within what might thing -- what one\nmight think of as what, you know, you see on television\nwhen officers are making contact with the public in\nrather high stakes incidents.\nSo it's difficult both because we have a\nState law term that varies and a term that doesn't even\nappear in the statute and that we don't embrace. So\nagain, it's difficult to provide examples in any\ndefinitive way because both of the comparators shift\ndepending on what we're talking about.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Yang, even if --\nif -- it depends on State law, that's clear. But does\nthe United States sometimes concede scope of authority\nso it can represent -- it can be the sole defendant in\nthe case, the individual officer is off the hook, so\nthat the United States could make the argument: It\nnever happened; the officer didn't do what the plaintiff\ncharged?\nMR. YANG: I believe, if I understand your\nquestion correctly, the answer is yes, but let me\nqualify that. This came up in a case called\nOsborne v. Haley. And the question about scope of\nemployment for purposes of the Westfall Act turns on\nwhether at the time of the alleged incident the officer,\nor employee in many cases, was acting within the scope\nof his or her employment.\nNow, when the United States investigates,\nthis is authority that is delegated to the Attorney\nGeneral, which is in turn redelegated to the U.S.\nAttorney's offices, investigates the relevant\ncircumstances and determines that the allegations are\njust false, not correct at all, in fact it never\nhappened, the employee was sitting at his or her desk\nbeavering away at important Federal matters, in that\ninstance, the Government will say that the employee was\nin fact acting within the scope of his or her employment\nand can explain that the reason for that is the\nGovernment rejects the underlying factual assertion.\nThat's something that then is litigated if\nthe Plaintiff seeks to challenge the scope\ndetermination. And the Court's decision in Osborne\nexplains that this is how the situation will play out,\nis that then the merits of the case ultimately condense\ninto a challenge to the scope certification of the\nAttorney General.\nSo, no, we don't simply say they were within\nscope for no reason. We determine whether they were\nwithin scope by evaluating the circumstances at issue\nand if the alleged circumstances did not occur and the\nemployee was acting within the scope properly, we will\ncertify that the employee was acting within the scope.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you go back and\ntell me, yet again -- you give a limiting principle, but\nI'm not sure how it applies. You seem to be saying --\ndo you agree with your -- with the Petitioner that law\nenforcement officer includes correction officers?\nMR. YANG: It does.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And why? Because they\nhave all of those other powers, so how is that different\nfrom those in the civil area who have similar powers to\narrest, search and seize, to --\nMR. YANG: Well, I guess there are two\nelements to the definition of investigative or law\nenforcement officer within the statute. First, they\nhave to be an officer of the United States. And the\nterm \"officer\" when we are talking about Federal\nofficers, the dictionary definition that most commonly\nand comfortably applies here, are ones that we're\ntalking about like sheriffs, constables, bailiffs,\npeople who have normal Federal criminal law enforcement\n-- well, not Federal but criminal law enforcement\nresponsibilities.\nThat -- you know, when you back out to the\nsecond criteria, we think that reinforces --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How about Customs\nagents?\nMR. YANG: Customs agents? I don't know if\nthey have criminal -- I believe if we assume that they\nare simply doing a civil function, Custom agents would\nnot fall within the term \"officer\" as normally applied.\nLet me give you an example that the amicus\nraises, Federal forest employees -- Forest Service\nemployees. Forest Service employees, the clerks that\nwork in D.C. are not what one would normally think of as\nan officer, particularly when we are talking about the\nphrase \"law enforcement officer.\"\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: My problem is park\nemployees I think of as officers when you meet them at\nthe parks. They are guarding the parks.\nMR. YANG: Some, some --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or they may also be\ngiving tours. They are usually doing sort of a mixture\nof --\nMR. YANG: Actually, I don't think that\nis --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- duties.\nMR. YANG: -- that's correct, Your Honor.\nThe Forest Service, as other park -- the Park Service,\nhas different roles for various individuals within their\nemploy. And there are, in fact, law enforcement\nofficers in the Park Service, and there are law\nenforcement officers in the Forest Service, and their\nduties are what one would traditionally think of as law\nenforcement.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Yang, the United States\ndidn't take this position below, right?\nMR. YANG: That is correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This is a change of heart.\nHow long ago was it that the United States took the\nopposite position, the position argued by amicus here?\nMR. YANG: Well, this is the Orsay position,\nwhich is not the Pooler position I believe the Court is\ntalking about. Pooler, the Government has not taken the\nview that the Third Circuit was correct and Pooler, as\nfar as I can tell, except within the Third Circuit, is\nbinding precedent.\nNow, when we take a step back and abandon\nPooler's limited approach and apply a more amorphous law\nenforcement capacity, law enforcement authority, the\nGovernment has done that in a number of lower cases,\nincluding several courts of appeals --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So it couldn't be that\nobvious, I guess?\nMR. YANG: Well, I think in those cases the\nGovernment took a position that never was a position\nthat made it to the Solicitor General's office. And\nwhen we took this -- both in the Reynolds case when\nthere was an adverse decision to the United States and\nin this case, we determined that the position was not\none that could be -- was not correct under the text.\nAnd I think, as amicus's -- amicus does, I\nthink, a valiant job of trying to defend that position,\nbut at the end of the day, there simply is not a textual\nargument to get to that outcome.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I think it is true that\nthere is a strong textual argument for your position.\nBut let me ask this: Are there any studies or any\nstatistics we can look at to see as a predictive matter\nhow many prison suits against the government this ruling\nthat you propose would -- would cause? It seems to me\nwe have close to 200,000 Federal prisoners, I think, and\nthis prison work, there is a lot of shoving, guards have\nto break up fights.\nSo there is going to be any number of\ninstances where the question is did the guard overreach.\nAnd if I make the assumption, and it's just an\nassumption because I haven't looked at any statistics,\nbut there is -- this is going to vastly expand the\nnumber of cases in which the Government is the\ndefendant. Doesn't that bear on the likelihood of the\ncongressional intent to adopt your position?\nMR. YANG: I guess there is a few parts to\nthat question. On the statistics, I am not aware of any\nstatistics that we would be able to reliably extrapolate\nto see what this would mean. I think there may well be\nsome additional cases. However, there are other tools,\nas we explain in our reply brief, including the Prison\nLitigation Reform Act, which requires the prisoners both\npay their filing fees and if they obtain three strikes,\nmust in fact -- they lose IFP status and must pay that\nfiling fee in advance, and it's a substantial amount of\nmoney for many prisoners, given what they earn.\nSo we think that it's not a reason to ignore\nwhat we think is the plain text, particularly where\nCongress here has in the proviso specifically referenced\nSection 1346(b). Section 1346(b) makes clear that the\nwaiver of sovereign immunity applies to acts or\nomissions committed within the scope of employment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can you suggest why\nCongress might have left out libel, slander,\nmisrepresentation?\nMR. YANG: Yes. I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why would they leave\nthat out if they are only looking at the office and not\nat the function that the person is performing?\nMR. YANG: Well, I think that those torts\nserve as a rough approximation of what Congress\nanticipated would be the areas where it thought the\nUnited States should be liable, when we are talking\nabout Federal law enforcement officers. And I think in\nfact --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right. I mean, that's the\npoint. So what you are saying is that it suggests that\nthey mean Federal law enforcement officers engaged in\nlaw enforcement.\nMR. YANG: Well, not -- I don't know that\nthat is the case, Justice Scalia. Certainly there is\nsome correlation between those torts and how we should,\nfor instance, understand \"officer of the United States,\"\nthings like false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious\nprosecution. All evoke Federal criminal law employment\nideas. However, when we look at the text that Congress\nused to implement the statute, the text is not like any\nof the other instances within the Federal Tort Claims\nAct, where Congress has limited the waiver to particular\ntypes of activities or carved out certain activities.\nIn fact, what Congress did was reference\nback to the general waiver provision which explains that\nthe waiver applies to acts within the scope of\nemployment.\nIf Congress had wanted, for instance, to say\nonly within law enforcement capacity, it would have used\nvery different language. The language of sections --\nthe other provisions in Sections 2680, for instance,\nsubsections (a), (b), and (c), which limit -- which\ncarve out the execution of a statute or regulation,\nexercise of discretionary functions, the laws of\nmiscarriage or negligent transmission of postal matter,\nassessment or collection of taxes or customs duties, (f)\nspecifically directs -- carves out the imposition or\nestablishment of a quarantine, (j) carves out the\ncombatant activities of military forces. If Congress\nwanted to use similar language like law enforcement\nactivities of a law enforcement officer, it would have\ndone that.\nAnd the United States -- I don't want to\nbang the drums too loudly here. We did take a contrary\nposition previously, but when our office reviewed the\ncase, we simply determined that the position could not\nbe one that would square to the test.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's assume we adopted\nthe definition Justice Scalia just proposed, law\nenforcement officer engaged in law enforcement\nactivities. Would correction officers be engaged in law\nenforcement activities?\nMR. YANG: Well, yes -- maybe yes, maybe no.\nWhat we are talking about is an undefined term and the\nterm does not even -- does not appear in the statute.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you can look at it\nboth ways. Are correction officers as officers who are\nprotecting or securing prisoners, are they acting in a\nlaw enforcement capacity in your -- forget about what\nact, what tort they commit, but do they function --\nMR. YANG: There could be many answers to\nthat question.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Okay.\nMR. YANG: You could, as the amicus or as\nthe Petitioner suggests, say that the enforcement of a\ncriminal sentence is part of law enforcement capacity,\nso anything that they do is law enforcement.\nYou could think of law enforcement capacity\nas more like arrests, you know, searches for violations\nof Federal criminal law, and that sort of thing. Those\nmight be exercises that the Court would have to engage\nin if Congress had actually used text directing the\nCourt to look at that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. YANG: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Bucholtz.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY S. BUCHOLTZ,\nFOR AMICUS CURIAE, IN SUPPORT OF THE JUDGMENT BELOW,\nAPPOINTED BY THIS COURT\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nI hope to convince the Court of two things\ntoday. First is about our reading of the law\nenforcement proviso as limited to conduct of\ninvestigative or law enforcement officers acting as\nsuch. The first is that that reading is textually\nplausible. It is a reasonable reading of what Congress\nenacted in light of the structure of the statute and in\nlight of ordinary English usage.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask, in light of\nyour opening statement, are you then abandoning your\nposition that it must be either arrest, search or\nseizure? You have used the Ninth Circuit formula.\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: Well, Justice Ginsburg, it's\nnot really clear how different the Ninth Circuit and the\nThird Circuit are from each other, because there haven't\nbeen cases that have arisen that have really tested the\nproposition that the Third Circuit meant only, literally\nonly, the execution of a search, the seizure of\nevidence, or the making of an arrest, and that would\nexclude conduct very closely incident to one of those\nthings. Those cases just haven't arisen.\nSo the courts have used different\nformulations. They appear to mean slightly different\nthings by them, but I wouldn't want to exaggerate the\ndifferences between the Third Circuit and the Ninth\nCircuit. Both are trying to capture what Congress was\ngetting at here, which was the law enforcement proviso\nwas about law enforcement activity. It was about\ncovering the United States under the FTCA for abuses of\nlaw enforcement authority like had occurred in\nCollinsville, which was the national scandal that\nprompted the enactment of the proviso.\nSo I think the answer to, Justice Ginsburg,\nto your question, is: We think that if you take the\nThird Circuit's language in Pooler, which of course is\nnot this case, but if you take the Pooler language\nliterally and you say that the only conduct covered is\nconduct in the course of -- that's language the Court\nused a few times in Pooler -- in the course of a search,\nan arrest, or a seizure of evidence, that's problematic\nbecause it's clear that Congress was trying to cover\nabuses of law enforcement authority, including malicious\nprosecution and abuse of process, which we know because\nCongress included those torts in the exception to the\nexception. And if you had a situation where an officer\nconducted a search and then wrote a false report about\nthe search that he had conducted, the writing of the\nreport wouldn't literally be in the course of the\nsearch. So if you take those words in Pooler literally,\nthat would be excluded. That can't be right.\nSo to that extent we agree with the Ninth\nCircuit position rather than the Third Circuit position.\nBut again I'm not really sure that it's fair to\nattribute that extreme position to the Third Circuit.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Bucholtz, the statute\nitself has a kind of conduct-based limitation in it. It\nsays law enforcement officers acting within the scope of\ntheir employment.\nSo I guess my question is, given that there\nis that conduct-based limitation in the statute, why one\nwould substitute for it law enforcement officers acting\nas law enforcement officers? Why wouldn't one use just\nthe conduct-based limitation that's already there?\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: Justice Kagan, I don't think\nit's a substitution. I think it's an addition if it's\nanything. But really the reason is that under ordinary\nEnglish usage, when there's a reference to somebody\ndefined by their status, it's fair to assume that the\nreference to the person defined by their status is\nreally just intended to cover things they do in that\nrelevant status and not things they do in some other\ncapacity.\nWhat we're asking the Court to do here is\nexactly what the Court did in Lane v. Pena. In Lane v.\nPena, the statute at issue was the Rehabilitation Act.\nIt waived sovereign immunity and provided a damages\nremedy against Federal providers of funding. The\nDepartment of Transportation clearly was a Federal\nprovider of funding. It gave out all sorts of funding\nto all sorts of recipients.\nBut that's not what the case was about. The\ncase was about the Merchant Marine Academy and somebody\nwho was dismissed from it. And what the Court said is\nthe reference to Federal funding providers like the\nDepartment of Transportation had to be read as limited\nto Federal funding providers acting as such. Those were\nthe Court's words, \"acting as such.\"\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay. And then -- then\ntake that theory and track through the statute to show\nme how that theory works, which is what your opening\nargument was going to do?\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: Justice Kennedy, in the first\nsentence of the proviso, the operative provision,\nCongress referred to acts or omissions of investigative\nor law enforcement officers of the United States.\nCongress didn't say any acts or omissions of\ninvestigative or law enforcement officers were covered.\nIt didn't say all were covered. It just said acts or\nomissions of law enforcement officers in the same way\nthat the statute at issue in Lane referred to conduct of\na Federal funding provider.\nAnd so what this Court should do, we submit,\nis construe acts or omissions of investigative or law\nenforcement officers of the United States as limited to\nacts or omissions of those defined -- that defined class\nof persons in the relevant capacity, when they're acting\nas law enforcement officers.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But again, it's not just any\nacts of law enforcement officers. It's acts of law\nenforcement officers acting within the scope of their\nauthority. And now you're saying acting as a law\nenforcement officer. I mean, one question I suppose I\nhave, which is the same question that I gave to Mr.\nYang, is what's the difference between those two things?\nAnd I guess the second question is: Why would we\nsubstitute one phrase about how they have to be acting\nfor the phrase that Congress actually used?\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: Congress didn't, in the\nproviso, Justice Kagan, Congress did not actually use\nthe phrase \"scope of employment.\" It did not actually\nincorporate scope of employment as a limitation\nexplicitly in the proviso. It -- it incorporated\n1346(b), which contains the scope requirement. But the\nproviso -- in the proviso, Congress did not actually\nspeak in terms of scope of employment as the operative\nlimitation. So I don't think we'd be substituting the\nacting as such limitation for anything that actually\nappears in the proviso.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it a limitation? Is\nscope a limitation? I thought that you -- you didn't\nquestion that, that scope is a limitation on the conduct\nthat's covered, right?\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: Justice Ginsburg, we\ncertainly agree that -- that the conduct that's covered\nhas to be within the scope of the Federal officer's\nemployment. The only point I was trying to make a\nmoment ago in response to Justice Kagan is that\nrequirement exists in 1346, not in the proviso by its\nterms. We certainly agree with that, and as we've\nargued in our brief, we think that one way the Court\ncould affirm the judgment below is to hold that the\nofficers here were not acting within the scope of their\nemployment, taking the allegations as true, as they have\nto be at this stage of the case.\nBut to return to Justice Kagan, to your\nquestion about why Congress would have wanted to -- the\nCourt to -- to interpret \"acts or omissions of law\nenforcement officers\" as acting as such, it's because --\nin part the answer is because scope turns on State law.\nSo Congress doesn't know when it enacts the proviso\nwhat's going to be covered if the only limitation is\nscope, because that turns on 50 different States' laws.\nAnd -- and I think that it's fair to say that there are\nactual meaningful differences between different States'\nlaws as to scope as we -- as we point out in our brief.\nBut the other past of the answer is the --\nis the second part of this Court's analysis in Lane v.\nPena, which is it's entirely possible literally to read\nthe Rehabilitation Act in Lane, and I would grant that\nit's possible literally to read the words in the\nproviso, as covering everything that a defined law\nenforcement officer does within the scope of employment.\nBut the Court said in Lane: We can't read the statute\nthat way, because we're talking about a waiver of\nimmunity, and waivers of immunity, even if you don't\nhave to put a heavy thumb on the scales and even if you\ndon't have to require that it be unequivocal -- we're\nnot going that far here -- you can't interpret it more\nbroadly than there's any reason to think Congress meant.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What does it leave out?\nWhat does it leave out, your theory? A policeman's a\nlaw enforcement officer. What does he do on his job\nthat isn't in a law enforcement role?\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: Well, there may be certain\ntypes of law enforcement officers, Justice Breyer, who\ngenerally aren't engaged in law enforcement activity\nwhen they're within the scope of employment. But that's\nnot the case with respect to correctional officers like\nare at issue here.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, I see.\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: And the reason for that is --\nand other types of officers, which hopefully I'll be\nable to get to, but correctional officers first since\nthat's what this case is about. 18 U.S.C. 3050 is what\nmakes correctional officers fall within the second\nsentence of the proviso, the definition that Congress\nprovided of investigative or law enforcement officers.\nIt's what gives them the authority to execute --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So your idea here is a park\npoliceman who is engaged in law enforcement some of the\ntime, but engaged in giving tours the rest of the time.\nYou're saying what you would do is say when he's engaged\nin the law enforcement he's covered, but not when he's\nengaged in the tour.\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: That's right, because he\nmeets the status-based definition that Congress\nprovided, but there's no reason to think Congress\nintended that he be covered when he's not engaged in law\nenforcement activity.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. What -- what\nis it about a corrections officer other than the act\nthat was committed here, which was an alleged sexual act\nwhich nobody could, except by some definition of State\nlaw, think that that ever happens naturally in the\ncourse. But that's an intentional assault. The very\ndefinition of the crimes that are covered assumes that\nit's not an act that's licensed. So, why isn't the\ncorrection officer acting in a law enforcement capacity\nwhen he's restraining people and securing them?\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: Because the correctional\nofficer essentially has two capacities. 18 U.S.C.\n3050, which is the only source of law that anyone has\npointed to, to make correctional officers fall within\nthe definition of law enforcement officers in the first\nplace, it has nothing to do with correctional officers'\ndaily interaction with already incarcerated prisoners.\nIt authorizes correctional officers to arrest escaped\ninmates and to arrest visitors to prisons. It has no\napplication to their daily interaction with\nprisoners who are already incarcerated.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the takedown\nthat occurred here and I -- it's not uncommon. The --\nyour definition includes three things, arrest, search,\nseizure. And correctional officers do engage in\nsearches of cells for contraband, and they do engage in\nseizures. Those are not -- this isn't like arrest,\nwhich you point out the arrest is unusual; it's an\nescapee or a visitor. But that's not true of search and\nseizure.\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: Justice Ginsburg,\ncorrectional officers do search prisoners' cells on a\nroutine basis as part of their duty to maintain order\nand security within the prisons. That responsibility\ncomes not from 18 U.S.C. 3050, but from 18 U.S.C. 4001\nand following, which is an entirely different set of\nlegal authorities that has to do with the Attorney\nGeneral's management of the Bureau of Prisons under his\nsupervision and correctional officers -- and 28 C.F.R.\nPart 552, which is where the correctional officers get\ntheir authority from to search prisoner cells, et\ncetera.\nWe think that when -- when correctional\nofficers are engaged in that kind of activity, they're\nacting in a security capacity to maintain order and\nsecurity within the prison. They're not acting in their\nvery narrow law enforcement capacity conferred by 18\nU.S.C. 3050. This case doesn't have --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, what happens --\nwhat happens in the police precinct when police officers\nare holding pretrial detainees? Are they acting as\npolice officers or as security people? Or even when a\nprisoner comes back to court for a court appearance and\nthere are U.S. marshals who guard them rather than\ncorrection officers, what are they serving as in your\nmind?\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: Well, as I said before,\nJustice Sotomayor, I think there are certain types of\nlaw enforcement officers who generally when they're\nacting within the scope of employment are engaged in law\nenforcement activity. And deputy U.S. marshals would\nprobably fall within that. But the important point\nabout this case is it doesn't, Justice Ginsburg, involve\nan allegation about a search. So whatever the Court\nmight think the right way to look at correctional\nofficers when they're engaged in searches might be, this\ncase isn't about a search.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why isn't this -- why\nisn't what the prison guard does law enforcement? I\nmean, the law says these people are going to be locked\nup and he's enforcing that.\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: The law is already --\nJUSTICE BREYER: He's going to be in prison\nunder these da, da, da, da, da. You know, all that da,\nda, da means the conditions of the prison, et cetera,\nthey're all regulations, rules, statutes. He's\nenforcing them, why not?\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: Justice Breyer, I think we\ncan tell from the definition in the proviso what\nCongress was focused on when it -- when it referred to\nlaw enforcement officers. We can tell what Congress --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, so now you're saying\nwhat those three things could provide the definition?\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: And -- and -- and other\nconduct that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And are you saying that?\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: -- I used before is yes, with\nthe caveat, and I think it's an important one, that it's\nnot just those three things, only what occurs in the\ncourse of those three things the way Pooler could\npossibly be read, but also conduct that's closely\nincident to those things.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you don't think the\nEPA is engaged in law enforcement when it enforces\nstatutes and regulations, do you?\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: It depends, Justice Scalia,\nit depends --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would an officer of the EPA\nbe a law enforcement officer when he writes a letter to\na company saying, You know, you are violating section\nsuch-and-such of the statute? Is that a law enforcement\nofficer?\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: Well, the person who writes\nthe letter may qualify as a law enforcement officer\nunder the definition, but that's a different question, I\nwould submit, than whether that -- whether that act\nconstitutes law enforcement activity.\nI think the answer to that question,\nJustice Scalia, is probably no, but the important\nfollow-up is if that person meets the definition of law\nenforcement officer because he's an EPA agent, and after\nthe letter he follows up and goes to the premises of the\nrecipient of the letter, knocks down the door and\nconducts an illegal search, that's what Congress was\ntrying to cover.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, but EPA is not what\nI'm thinking of, I don't think they are. I am thinking\nof police. Okay. Now, one basic job of a policeman is\nto patrol, but not arresting people, not searching and\nnot seizing evidence. They are on patrol. That's\nbasically what they do. All right? Is that a law\nenforcement activity?\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: If it's an FBI agent?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I\nmean in places -- it's Federal, I understand. So I'm\nsure we can find analogies in the Federal situation to\nordinary policemen.\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: Justice Breyer, the answer --\nthe answer -- well, it might not be so easy to find an\nanalogy to an ordinary policeman --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. But FBI agents,\nwho are the federal police, they're people on Federal\nenclaves, for example, there are -- they are on Federal\nenclaves, they act like policemen, okay.\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: Sure. And when they are\nengaged in patrols, I think it's fair to say that's\nprobably law enforcement activity --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. That's fair. I\nmean, what I'm thinking of is either you can have a\nbroad definition or one that's going to get into trouble\nwhen we consider real policemen. So if you have a broad\none, then I don't see how prison guards get out of it.\nIf you have a narrow one, my guess is we could find lots\nof Federal policemen who really are policemen who aren't\ndoing what falls -- who are doing what falls outside\nyour narrow definition. I wish I could think of better\nexamples, but I came up with the ones I did.\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: Then maybe I should try to\nreturn to some of the examples that other Justices have\ngiven. So there was talk earlier about an OSHA\ninspector. The Government's position -- and I think\nthis is an important difference between our position and\nthe Government's -- the Government would say that\nbecause OSHA isn't a criminal law in the traditional\nsense and an OSHA inspector or an OSHA agent isn't\nenforcing criminal law in the colloquial sense, that\nthat shouldn't be covered.\nBut if the OSHA inspector knocks down your\ndoor and conducts an illegal search and batters you, why\nshouldn't that be covered? We know that's a law\nenforcement abuse, and we know that law enforcement\nabuse is exactly what Congress is trying to get at. The\nGovernment, it's like it's trying to relitigate Marshall\nagainst Barlows where this Court held that OSHA\ninspectors have to have a warrant even though you could\nthink of OSHA as being administrative or civil as\nopposed to criminal. That's the argument that the\nGovernment made there a generation ago and they lost.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So how does that argument\nhelp your case?\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: Because, Justice Kennedy, the\npoint in this case is that we agree that correctional\nofficers fall within the plain language of the\ndefinition that Congress provided. Again, the structure\nof the proviso is there are two sentences, an operative\nprovision and the definition.\nWe are trying to get the Court to construe\nthe operative provision, the first sentence, in the same\nway the Court did in Lane against Pena. The Government\nis trying to get the Court to construe the definition,\nthe second sentence. What Congress said in the\ndefinition, what the term means, the Court has much less\nscope to construe that in some way other than the\nliteral language that Congress provided where Congress\nsaid what the term means.\nSo we agree under the plain language of the\ndefinition that correctional officers are investigative\nor law enforcement officers because of 18 U.S.C. 3050,\nwhich gives them the power under limited, and\ninapplicable here, circumstances to arrest.\nWe think that if you look at correctional\nofficers under 18 U.S.C. 3050 or under the different\nauthorities under 18 U.S.C. 4001 and following and the\nregulations, that they wear two hats. Sometimes they\nact in a law enforcement capacity, but not usually,\nbecause that only applies in the narrow context of\nescapes or visitors. When they are dealing with already\nincarcerated prisoners, like in the allegations here,\nthey are really not acting in that capacity at all.\nThey are wearing a different hat.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You are saying that the\nGovernment is trying to minimize the consequences of\ncoming out its way by providing a definition of the\nofficers covered, which will not hold. You think it\ndoes cover a broader category of officers including OSHA\ninspectors, but it does not cover them when they are not\nengaged in law enforcement activities.\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: Justice Scalia, you have\nabsolutely perfectly encapsulated our position. Thank\nyou.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: The reason why we think that\nthat difference between our position and the\nGovernment's is important is that the Government's\nposition would render the proviso severely\nunderinclusive. We know Congress was trying to get at\nlaw enforcement abuses and provide a remedy. And\nCongress -- the Government would say that if it's not a\ntraditional law enforcement officer in the colloquial\nsense of like a constable, that it's not covered. But\nall sorts of agents of the United States from OSHA to\nFDA to all sorts of other agencies, to EPA, engage in\nlaw enforcement activity like the three things we know\nCongress was focused like a laser beam on: Executing\nsearches, seizing evidence, making arrests for\nviolations of Federal law. And I don't see any basis\nconsistent with the text or our understanding of what\nCongress intended, to the extent it's different from the\ntext, to say that that's not covered.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: One other advantage of\nyour definition is that it takes us out of workplace\nfights between two employees, because presumably the\nofficers who punch each other out, if that incident\noccurs, aren't acting in a law enforcement capacity. I\nam assuming that is part of your argument as well.\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: That's part of it, that's\nright.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. Then it goes\nback to the question I asked one of your adversaries,\nwhich is all of this depends on how broadly or narrowly\nwe define law enforcement activities.\nIf we take it as broadly as the Government\nis suggesting, at moments, it would -- we could very\nwell say, you are right, it's a law enforcement\nactivity, but not as narrowly as some would have it be.\nIt would include securing or detaining people, or\nsecuring or detaining people. And it would include the\nPark Service person who stops a visitor and punches them\nout. It would include the military personnel who stops\nsomeone and does an intentional tort against them, even\nthough they may just be walking on the grounds rather\nthan serving as security that particular day.\nSo the point is, why should we give it the\nnarrow reading you are giving, and not the broader\nreading the Government seems to be suggesting?\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: Well, two parts to the\nanswer, Justice Sotomayor. The first is the Government\nis trying to give the first sentence the broader\nreading, which it recognizes then creates a problem that\nit tries to solve by narrowing the second sentence in a\nway that we think won't hold.\nBut the other part of the answer,\nJustice Sotomayor, is it's about congressional intent.\nJustice Kennedy asked earlier about whether the\nGovernment's interpretation or the Petitioner's\ninterpretation would unleash a flood of suits by\nprisoners and whether it's fair to think that Congress\nwould have intended that. If you look at the\nlegislative history of the proviso, there is absolutely\nno indication that anyone in Congress contemplated that\nthe proviso would or could or should apply in the prison\nsituation. All Congress was focused on was providing a\nremedy for the kinds of raids that had occurred in\nCollinsville.\nAnd so I think when somebody has two hats,\nlike a prison guard has, because, again, there is two\ndifferent sources of legal authority that they are\nexercising, 18 U.S.C. 3050 versus 4001, or a military\npoliceman who has two hats, in the cases of Holian that\nwe describe in our briefs where the Government made the\nargument that where a military policeman is engaged in a\nmilitary function, not a law enforcement function, that\nthey are not covered.\nWe think where somebody who meets the\ndefinition that Congress provided of an investigative or\nlaw enforcement officer has two distinct hats, two\ndistinct capacities. When they are not acting in the\nlaw enforcement one, they are not covered. There is no\nreason to think that Congress intended that military\npolice or prison guards be covered when they are\nmaintaining order on a military base or within a prison.\nThat's not what Congress was trying to get at.\nAnd we think again a severe disadvantage of\nthe Government's position, they are trying to solve --\nin a sense they are trying to solve the same problem\nthat we are with our acting as such interpretation, but\nthey are trying to solve it through the wrong part of\nthe statute and in a way that -- in a way ends up with\nthe worst of both worlds.\nYou end up with broader coverage of the kind\nof conduct that's covered, broader than there is any\nreason to think Congress intended, conduct that doesn't\ninvolve law enforcement activity at all, but a narrower\nclass of people whose conduct is covered. Where that\nexcludes people like OSHA inspectors, FDA agents, EPA\nagents and in the rare circumstance where the Forest\nService employee is acting as a law enforcement officer\nrather than as a botanist or an entomologist or\nsomething like that, we think Congress intended to cover\nthem.\nWe know from the definition that there were\nthree exercises of law enforcement authority that\nCongress was focused like a laser beam on: Executing\nsearches, seizing evidence and making arrests. Where\nsomebody meets the definition of law enforcement officer\nand they are doing one of those three things, there is\nno basis not to say that they are covered.\nWe think it's better to interpret the first\nsentence of the proviso the same way the Court did in\nLane against Pena as limited to acts or omissions of\ninvestigative or law enforcement officers acting as\nsuch, and keep the definition that Congress provided the\nway Congress provided it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then scope becomes kind\nof a surplusage.\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: Not surpluses necessarily,\nJustice Ginsburg, because it varies among States. There\ncould be States where scope is narrower or broader, and\nthere could always be situations where State law is such\nthat the easiest way to resolve a case is under scope,\nand not under the concept of acting as a law enforcement\nofficer.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It has to be a law\nenforcement function. Give -- give me an example of a\ncase where -- where scope would also be relevant, would\nalso be applicable -- if you -- if there is a law\nenforcement function, then it fits. So what does scope\nadd?\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: Well, if an officer is\nexecuting a search but he's doing so because of a\npersonal vendetta against the person whose premises he's\nsearching, and he's -- and he's not -- under whatever\nthe State -- State's law that is applicable, if there is\na relatively narrow conception of scope so that you have\nto be trying to serve your employer, which is the\ntraditional rule, and not just sort of on the job in a\nloose sense, which is what the D.C. rule has come to be,\nan officer who is engaged in a search or making --\nmaking an arrest for a completely inappropriate reason,\nnot trying to serve the employer, not in any way that's\nauthorized by the employer, might not be within the\nscope, but might be engaged in one of the three law\nenforcement activities that Congress specified. And the\nother --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: A prisoner -- a prisoner\nis supposed to be back in his cell block at 6:00 in the\nevening, he isn't, he's on the recreation yard, he's\nsomewhat recalcitrant, and two guards carry him back to\nthe cell block. Is that an arrest?\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: No, Justice Kennedy, it's not\nan arrest, for, among other reasons, the reason that\nprison guards don't have any legal authority to make an\narrest in that circumstance.\nThe prisoner's already been arrested.\nThat's how he got to jail in the first place.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, he's violating the\nprison regulations.\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: Yes. And 28 CFR part 552\nsets out the authorities that prison guards have to\nenforce prison regulations to maintain security and\norder within the prison, like in that circumstance.\nThat's not making an arrest. The prison guards have the\nauthority --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's not a law\nenforcement function as contemplated by the statute, in\nyour view?\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: That's correct,\nJustice Kennedy. That -- that may involve the use of\nforce and I -- you know, you can make an argument that\n-- that when you pick somebody up like in your\nhypothetical, that that's like an arrest at common law.\nThere's no reason to think Congress was getting at that,\nwas trying to cover that in the proviso.\nWhere somebody has two different distinct\ncapacities as a matter of law, the way Bureau of Prisons\nguards do, and they're acting in the one and not the\nother, then I think that's the simple answer, is that --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's the difference\nbetween the officer who punches the prisoner to get him\non the ground and pick him up? Would it apply to the\nofficer who files an arrest complaint against the\nprisoner, and not to the security officer who just\nmerely carries him back to his cell?\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: Justice Sotomayor, the\nhypothetical is --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or does some physical\ninjury that's substantial. So the intentional assault\ngets treated as an exception to this only when the\nsecurity officer actually files an arrest complaint? Or\nwould it at all?\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: Are you talking about a\nBureau of Prison guard filing the arrest complaint?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes.\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: Well, I think -- one thing to\npoint out is the government informs the Court in its\nreply brief that in a situation where there has been a\nviolation of prison rules that may also be a violation\nof Federal law that may also be a crime, such that, you\nknow, in ordinary English usage, you could refer to the\nprison guard as conducting an investigation for\nviolation of a Federal crime.\nWhat happens is the BOP guards don't do that\nthemselves. They call in the FBI. That's what the\ngovernment says in its reply brief. So I think that\nitself is an indication of the distinction between\nprison guards who are law enforcement officers as\nCongress has defined the term, but who are not\ntraditional law enforcement officers, as the government\nseeks to define -- redefine the term, and in that\ncapacity are not acting as law enforcement officers.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Bucholtz, I'm sure you\nhave done this already, so I apologize, but could you\njust state your definition of what it means to be acting\nas a law enforcement officer? What activities other\nthan the three listed get included?\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: Well, Justice Kagan, it's\nhard to give a simple comprehensive answer that applies\nto all different types of law enforcement officers. Let\nme start by saying that the three things that have to be\nincluded are the three things that Congress specified,\nand that's one of the problems with the government's\ndefinition, is that it reads out cases involves those\nthree activities, involving, in the government's view --\nkinds of officers.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But you don't have your own\n-- so what else gets in the mix? How would you define\nit generally?\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: So -- in a case that involves\none of those three things but also something else that's\nincident to or related to those three things, we think\nit would probably be artificial. And you can imagine\nall sorts of hypos, but it might well be artificial to\nseparate the writing of the -- of the report about the\narrest and the arrest itself. So conduct incident to\none of these three specified activities we think is\nprobably covered. We also think that maybe when you are\ntalking about a type of law enforcement officer like an\nFBI agent who is wearing his law enforcement hat all the\ntime, doesn't have a second distinct capacity as a\nmatter of law, like a military policeman or correctional\nofficer, that maybe a broader definition is appropriate,\nthat maybe the FBI agent who is --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Maybe? I mean, yes or no or\nwhen or --\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: Well, I mean, Justice Kagan,\nin fairness, this case doesn't present that question,\nbecause it doesn't involve any law enforcement activity.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But if we're going to adopt\nyour definition, we have to have some understanding of\nwhere it's taking us.\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: Of course. Of course. And\nwhere I think it would be taking the Court is that as\nalways, there could be hard cases that could arise that\nthe lower courts would have to grapple with, but I think\nthe important concept is, that where somebody has two\nhats, a law enforcement capacity and some other\ncapacity, then it's easy to draw that line, in concept.\nAgain, there could be hard cases, but as a concept, it's\neasy to draw that line.\nWhere somebody doesn't have two hats, they\nonly have one hat, like an FBI agent, and they are on\nthe job and they are engaged in what normal people would\nthink of as law enforcement activity, maybe that's\ncovered. I don't really have a -- have a problem with\nthat.\nI think -- I think that's probably\nconsistent with what Congress was getting at. And maybe\nthe way to think about it is, Congress defined \"law\nenforcement officer\" with reference to the three\nspecified kinds of exercises of law enforcement\nauthority, but when the FBI agent is interviewing a\nwitness or potential suspect but hasn't yet gotten to\nthe point of arresting a person or conducting a search,\nyou can think of that as preliminary to an exercise of\none of the three specified authorities, because after\nall, that's what the FBI agent has the authority to do,\nit's what his job entails.\nAnd depending on how the initial questioning\ngoes, that might be the next step. And so it's never\nfar from the scene, when an FBI agent is engaged in what\nyou would normally think of as law enforcement activity,\nthat one of the three specified law enforcement\nactivities could be in the offing.\nThat's very different when you're talking\nabout Forest Service employees who technically meet the\ndefinition but usually are not doing anything within a\nmillion miles of what normal people would think of as\nlaw enforcement activity.\nSo I think it's important to distinguish\nbetween different kinds of people who fall within the\ndefinition. And -- I understand the Court wants to try\nto figure out what the implications of this\ninterpretation would be. I think that in the prison\ncontext, the answer is clear, because there are two\ndistinct capacities. And that's a hugely important\ncontext as a practical matter, given the point that\nJustice Kennedy made about the likelihood of an enormous\nnumber of claims that Congress probably didn't intend.\nIn the military police context, where there\nare also two distinct capacities, it's probably pretty\neasy to draw the line. In other cases, it will be\ncase-by-case whether something that the Plaintiff\nalleges should be thought of as law enforcement activity\nor law enforcement officer acting as such. We don't\nhave a problem with the broad interpretation of law\nenforcement activity acting as such, dealing with the\ntraditional law enforcement officer in a context that\nit's clear Congress intended.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. BUCHOLTZ: Thank you very much, Your\nHonor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Paolella, you\nhave 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. PAOLELLA,\nFOR PETITIONER, APPOINTED BY THIS COURT\nMR. PAOLELLA: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nLet me begin by addressing Justice Kennedy's\npoint, his question regarding the possibility of a flood\nof lawsuits from prisoners. I think it's important to\nkeep in mind that right now, Pooler and Orsay are the\nminority rules. Most Federal courts have adopted a\nbroad interpretation of the law enforcement proviso.\nSo if adopting a broader interpretation here\nwould open the flood gates, the flood gates are already\nopen, and they have been for 40 years in most of the\ncountry. And we haven't seen a flood of FTCA suits\nbrought by prisoners, especially since the passage of\nthe PLRA --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Have they also adopted the\ngovernment's view of what counts as an officer, or have\nthey not?\nMR. PAOLELLA: I -- I don't think that the\nissue has really been litigated in the Federal courts.\nIt simply hasn't come up. And I think that that's an\nindication that it's -- it's a workable test. It's --\nit's not something -- that there are many, many cases,\nthe vast majority of cases, involve individuals who will\nbe by any reasonable definition core law enforcement\nofficers. As far as I am aware, every Federal court to\naddress the issue has defined correctional officers as\nlaw enforcement officers. You know -- as officers, as\nthat term is used.\nSo I think that these things are really\nultimately noncontroversial.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you support the\ngovernment's position on who's an officer, right? So it\nwouldn't include EPA. Is that --\nMR. PAOLELLA: I think that the word\n\"officer\" carries some water in this statute, and it\nmeans something other than \"employee.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that a yes or a no?\nMR. PAOLELLA: Yes.\nJustice Scalia, let me return to your\nearlier point about inferring congressional intent from,\nfor example, from the list of enumerated torts. And I\nthink it's important to keep in mind that the best\nevidence of Congress's intent is the text of the\nstatute. And the fundamental problem with amicus's\nposition is that he very ably uses tools for construing\nambiguous statutes to construe a statute that at its\ncore is not ambiguous, it's precise and it's definite.\nNow, the coverage that is created by the\nliteral words of the statute may be debatable as a\npolicy matter. Maybe it makes sense to include\ncorrectional officers, maybe it doesn't. But it's not\nabsurd. And this Court's rule is when you were\nconstruing a non-ambiguous statute, Congress gets to\ndraw that policy line, not the Court, as long as the\nresult is not absurd.\nAnd we would argue that Congress drew that\npolicy line here. It very specifically provided that\nany claim based on enumerated tort by a federal law\nenforcement officer acting within the scope of his or\nher employment, is where it drew that line, that's what\nthe statute literally says. There is no argument about\nthat. And I think that all of the results, the parade\nof horribles that amicus has raised, again, may be\ndebatable as a policy matter, but not one of them is an\nabsurd exercise of Congress's responsibility. And as a\nresult, we would urge the Court to reverse.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Bucholtz, this Court appointed you as an\namicus curiae to brief and argue the case in support of\nthe judgment below, and you have ably discharged that\nresponsibility for which the Court is grateful.\n"
