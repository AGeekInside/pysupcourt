        "content": "[10:02 a.m.]\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst today in Unitherm Food Systems versus Swift-Eckrich.\nMr. Bailey.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BURCK BAILEY\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. BAILEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn 1947, this Court stated, in Cone versus West\nVirginia Pulp & Paper Company, 330 U.S. at 216, quote,\n\"Determination of whether a new trial should be granted,\nor a judgment entered under Rule 50(b), calls for the\njudgment in the first instance of the judge who saw and\nheard the witnesses and has the feel of the case, which no\nappellate printed transcript can impart.\" That language\nwas repeated verbatim the following year in Globe Liquor\nversus San Roman. And, in the year after that, both Cone\nand Globe Liquor were cited for the same proposition in\nFountain versus Filson. And, in 1952, in Johnson versus\nNew York Railway, this Court again reiterated the\nrequirement -- is the word the Court used -- of submitting\na post-verdict motion, or JNOV, to preserve sufficiency of\nthe evidence for appellate review.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, was there a Rule 59\nmotion made here after the verdict?\nMR. BAILEY: No, Your Honor. There was a motion\nfor a remittitur --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Right.\nMR. WOLFMAN: -- of damages.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Had a Rule 59 motion been\nmade, would it preserve a sufficiency-of-the-evidence\nargument in connection with the motion for new trial?\nMR. BAILEY: Not a sufficiency-of-the-evidence\nargument, Your Honor. And that -- this Court spoke to\nthat in footnote 9 of the Weisgram opinion. But a Rule 59\nmotion contesting the weight of the evidence would have\nbeen appropriate. No such motion was filed.\nEight of the Circuit Courts of Appeals have held\nthat in the absence of a post-verdict Rule 50(b) motion,\nthe appellate court cannot review for sufficiency of the\nevidence. And that language is in black letter law in the\nstandard treatises on Federal practice, in Moore's and in\nWright & Miller, that it is absolutely required. Here --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do any of those circuits allow\nan exception for plain error?\nMR. BAILEY: Several of them do --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. BAILEY: -- Your Honor. Some do not, but\nmost, I think it would be accurate to say, do. And, Your\nHonor, we feel that those cases are mistakenly decided,\nbecause the court's ruling on a 50(a) motion -- that is, a\npre-verdict motion -- is always interlocutory. I mean,\nindeed, the trial court is encouraged to deny that motion,\npending the jury verdict, because if the jury comes back,\nobviously, with a defendant's verdict, that's the end of\nthe case. And if the Court, on the other hand, grants\nit, and the appellate court concludes that there was a\njury question, then it has to go back for a whole new\ntrial. So --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Just while I have you, I'm --\njust while I have you here -- it's not --\nMR. BAILEY: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- probably, directly relevant\nto this case. On that one point, when I was in practice,\nit used to irritate me sometimes that the judge should\ngrant the motion and then he'd just sit on it. But I see\nthe wisdom for the rule now, and the judge reserving it,\nin the event the jury comes out the right -- the, quote,\n\"right way,\" anyway. What if there's a very long trial?\nWhat if, after the plaintiff rests, there's a good grounds\nfor granting the motion for judgment as a matter of law,\nthe judge doesn't do it, and then there's a 3-month trial?\nDo the judges ever take that into account?\nMR. BAILEY: Your --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Three more months for the\ndefense to --\nMR. BAILEY: Yes. Your Honor, I think my answer\nto that is, not infrequently holes in the plaintiff's case\nare filled when the defendant's case is put on. That\nhappens, as I say, rather frequently, through cross-\nexamination and -- and it's just extremely iffy to say\nthat won't occur. And, in any event, Your Honor, it\nraises the specter of this problem that we've just talked\nabout, that that long trial that you -- that you\nenvisioned in your hypothetical would have to -- if the\nappellate court finds that there is a jury question there\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.\nMR. BAILEY: -- has to try it all over again.\nNot a -- not a very good consequence.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: On the issue that's before us\nnow, I can understand why, if the, what we used to call,\nJNOV is not requested after the jury verdict, the\nappellate court could not then enter judgment -- direct\nthe entry of judgment as a matter of law. But I don't see\nwhy it couldn't say, just as we would be reluctant to\naffirm a decision when there was no claim for relief, so,\nif there's insufficient evidence, we can remand for a new\ntrial. But you would say that that is not possible\neither.\nMR. BAILEY: I would, Your Honor. That's not\nauthorized. There's no way to ask for a new trial in a\n50(a) motion. I mean, it doesn't provide for that. The\ntrial is still going on. By definition, you can't seek a\nnew trial until the trial is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But --\nMR. BAILEY: -- concluded.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- you haven't asked for it,\nbut the appellate court said, \"We don't want to affirm a\njudgment when there was insufficient evidence, so we are\ngoing to\" -- there was -- the judge was tipped off by the\n-- by the directed-verdict motion, that the -- who turned\nout to be -- the one who turned out to be the verdict\nloser thinks the evidence is insufficient. That's enough\nat least to say that the Court of Appeals could grant a\nnew trial.\nMR. BAILEY: Your Honor, it's our position that\nyou can never ask for -- move for a new trial for -- on\nthe ground that the evidence is against -- the weight --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No, I'm not --\nMR. BAILEY: -- of the evidence --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- talking about \"against the\nweight,\" because a trial judge would rarely be -- if it --\nif a trial judge said, \"It's against the weight of the\nevidence,\" it would go back for a new trial, and you\ncouldn't raise that issue, at least not til you go through\nthe whole second trial. But why isn't it like -- I think\nthere are decisions that say there was a judgment, but\nthe Court of Appeals determines there was never a claim\nfor relief to begin with, even though a motion wasn't made\nto that effect. The idea of a court affirming a judgment\nthat is without sufficient legal basis is troubling.\nMR. BAILEY: Well, Your Honor, I -- my response\nto that is that these matters, pursuant to this Court's\njurisprudence in Cone and Johnson and other cases, simply\nmandates that the trial court be asked to pass in the\nfirst instance on this issue of sufficiency of the\nevidence.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But, it -- but it was asked\nby the -- by the pre-verdict motion. What -- the only\nthing that wasn't done is, it -- the request wasn't\nrepeated after the verdict. I can see your point if there\nhad never been a motion for directed verdict at the close\nof all of the evidence. But there was that. And so, all\nthat we're missing is a repetition of the same words after\nthe jury comes in.\nMR. BAILEY: Well, Your Honor, the -- if I may,\nthe standard of review is radically different. I mean, if\nmotion for a JNOV is asked for and granted/denied, the\nreview is de novo. The issue about a new trial, under 59,\nis an abuse of discretion.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that's -- the new trial\ncomes in, by the courts that have said this, only --\nthey'd say, \"We would direct the entry of judgment for the\nverdict loser, but we're powerless to do that.\" And that\nis all wrapped up in the Seventh Amendment. So, the next\nbest thing is, we grant a new trial.\nMR. BAILEY: Well, that's certainly what the\nTenth Circuit jurisprudence provides, Your Honor. And the\nFederal Circuit adopted that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. BAILEY: And we think that that's totally at\nodds with this Court's rule in Cone and Johnson, that it\nis out of step with the law in eight Federal Circuits,\nthat it simply is illogical to say, someone who never\nasked for a new trial -- Your Honor, if they had -- if\nConAgra had sought a new trial on sufficiency of the\nevidence in Federal Circuit, presumably, the Federal\nCircuit said, \"You didn't ask for that below. It's gone.\nIt's waived. What's your next argument?\" By not asking,\nthey say, in effect, \"Since you didn't ask for it, that's\nwhat we're going to give you.\" And that simply is, Your\nHonor --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, couldn't one regard a\nnew trial as, sort of, subsumed under the request for\njudgment as a matter of law? That is, that's the larger\nthing, but at least a new trial. Don't let -- the\njudgment as a matter of law says, \"Don't let this verdict\nstand.\" So, one could say, \"We won't give you a judgment,\nbut we will order a new trial.\"\nMR. BAILEY: And, Your Honor, I -- my response\nis simply that those are two very different motions and\ncall for two very different standards of review, and it\ncannot, I respectfully submit, logically be administered,\nwhen there's been no request for a new trial. There's no\nauthority to request a new trial in a 50(a) motion. It\nleads to the kind of confusion that, I submit --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would you refresh my\nrecollection? In the cases you cited at the outset of\nyour argument, where the judgments were reversed, am I\nwrong in thinking, in those cases, there was, in fact, a\nnew trial afterwards?\nMR. BAILEY: There -- Your Honor, they had moved\nfor a new trial in those cases. That is, the defendant\nmoved for a new trial. And that -- and this Court --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the judgment of this Court\nwas simply reverse, wasn't it?\nMR. BAILEY: It was reverse.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: There were --\nMR. BAILEY: Of the appellate court --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. WOLFMAN: -- of the Eighth Circuit. Yes,\nYour Honor, that's right. It was -- this Court simply\nreversed, in Cone and Johnson. Those cases went back for\nretrial. Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't understand your\nresponse to me about vastly different standards of review.\nI would think it would be harder for a verdict loser to\nget judgment as a matter of law than to get a new trial.\nMR. BAILEY: At the trial or the appellate\nlevel, either one --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. BAILEY: -- Your Honor? Yes. Well, one\nwould -- I quite agree.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's why --\nMR. BAILEY: But --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- I'm suggesting --\nMR. BAILEY: -- but the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that one is kind of a\nlesser included.\nMR. BAILEY: Yes, Your Honor. And the response\nI have to make is that the reviewing court would determine\nthe issue of new trial on an abuse-of-discretion standard,\nnot on a de novo review of sufficiency of the evidence.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They go to different\nthings, don't they? I mean, if you -- you get a new trial\nwhen there are -- you know, evidence is admitted that\nshouldn't have been admitted, or something like that. I\nmean, they're -- they're, sort of, different grounds.\nThey're not overlapping, are they?\nMR. BAILEY: They -- very different grounds most\n-- most commonly, Your Honor. That is, you can -- there\ncan be completely sufficient evidence to support the jury\nwinner's verdict --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well --\nMR. BAILEY: -- but the Court can still --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- this is a --\nMR. BAILEY: -- grant a new trial.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. I meant -- I'm\nnot sure. I mean, is it a -- is insufficient evidence a\ntypical ground for asking for a new trial?\nMR. BAILEY: Well, not insufficient evidence,\nbut the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No.\nMR. BAILEY: -- the verdict is against the\nweight of the evidence. That is the distinction that this\nCourt pointed out in footnote 9 of Weisgram, that if\nyou're talking about the weight of the evidence -- the\nverdict is against the weight of the evidence; very\nsubjective proposition, but that it is -- then you proceed\nunder Rule 59.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that determination of what\nwas the weight of the evidence is typically left to the\ntrial judge, rather than to the Court of Appeals. It\nwould be --\nMR. BAILEY: Well, you can --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- somewhat novel for the Court\nof Appeals to be reviewing a trial judge on the basis of\nwhat it thought the weight of the evidence was. It's one\nthing to say, \"If he's denied or granted a motion for a\nnew trial on that basis, we'll look for abuse of\ndiscretion,\" but for the appellate court to do that de\nnovo and assess the weight of the evidence, it seems, to\nme, quite unusual.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's --\nMR. BAILEY: I --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't think any appellate\ncourt has claimed that authority. We're talking about a\nnew trial in lieu of J- -- a judgment as a matter of law.\nAnd the -- one of the whole rationales in Cone and Globe\nand all of the others were saying you should make the\npost-verdict motion -- is that then the trial judge would\nhave the option. The trial judge might think, \"Well,\ntechnically, you deserve JMOL, but maybe there was a\nwitness who was out to sea, so I want to exercise my\ndiscretion to grant a new trial.\" Those two are closely\nlinked. I mean, lawyers usually, as a -- just a matter of\n-- just automatically ask for JNOV or, in the alternative,\na new trial.\nMR. BAILEY: Your Honor, I think it shows\nrespect to the trial judge to require that the trial judge\nbe required, in the first instance, to review this\nevidence that the trial judge saw, heard, and has the same\nopportunity, as this Court has observed in cases going\nback over a century, to see, just like the jurors saw, and\nprovides a perspective on it that is available to the\ntrial judge, alone.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well --\nMR. BAILEY: Your Honors, if --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- it seems --\nMR. BAILEY: -- I may, I'd --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- it seems to me that if the\nCourt of Appeals is going to grant a new trial, it must\nsay one of two things. It must say either, number one,\n\"There was not sufficient evidence to go to the jury, but\nthe conclusion of that determination ought to be -- and,\ntherefore, you know, the case is over\"; but to say that\nand then say, \"And, therefore, we give a new trial,\" it\nseems very strange. Or else, the Court of Appeals has to\nsay, you know, \"The weight of the evidence was not in the\nplaintiff's favor.\" And if it says that, it's making the\nkind of a determination that I find unusual for a Court of\nAppeals.\nMR. BAILEY: Yes, Your Honor. But circumventing\nthe application to the trial judge --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But --\nMR. BAILEY: -- in the first instance --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- in fact, that's not what\nthe Courts of Appeals have said. They have all said, \"We\nwould grant judgment as a matter of law, but we're\npowerless to do that under this case -- Court's case law.\nWe think the evidence is insufficient, not that it's\nagainst the weight of the evidence. We think it's\ninsufficient. If we had the power to do it, we would\ndirect the entry of judgment. We can't do that, so we do\nthe next best thing.\"\nBut in all of the -- including the Tenth\nCircuit, whose law is relevant here -- the Court of\nAppeals is saying, \"We think the judgment -- there was\ninsufficient evidence to support that judgment. And if we\nhad the power, we would instruct the entry of judgment.\nWe don't have that power.\"\nMR. BAILEY: That's exactly what they said, Your\nHonor. And we say they had no authority to do that. In\nthe absence of taking it in the first instance before the\ntrial court. May I reserve --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose they could make the\nsame -- if -- I mean, if that follows, they should be able\nto do the same thing when there has been no motion made,\nneither before nor after, right? They could say, \"Well,\nthere's no motion made. We really have no authority to\nreverse this judgment.\"\nMR. BAILEY: That's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: \"But\" --\nMR. BAILEY: -- that's certainly --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- you know, \"we certainly\nthink there was not enough evidence, and, therefore, we\ngrant a new trial.\" Does any court do that?\nMR. BAILEY: I may have missed, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where no motion has been made\n--\nMR. BAILEY: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- neither before the verdict\nnor after the verdict, does any appellate court say,\n\"Since no motion was made, we have -- we have no power to\nreverse the judgment here, but our examination of the case\nindicates that there was really not sufficient evidence to\ngo to the jury. And, therefore, we will do the lesser\nthing and grant a new trial\"? Does any court of --\nappellate court do that?\nMR. BAILEY: Your Honor, I know of no case where\nan appellate court would do such a thing when there's no\nmotion of any kind that's ever been made contesting the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but the trial court could\ndo that, pursuant to Rule 59(d), couldn't it?\nMR. BAILEY: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I say, the trial court could\nhave done that pursuant to Rule 59(d) without a motion\nbeing filed.\nMR. BAILEY: I quite agree, Your Honor. Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you --\nMR. BAILEY: May I reserve the rest of my time?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Bailey.\nMr. Stewart.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART\nFOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nIN SUPPORT OF PETITIONER\nMR. STEWART: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nIt's a well established principle of Federal\nappellate practice that the litigant must adequately\npreserve a claim in the trial court in order to raise it\non appeal. The disputed issue in this case is whether a\nclaim of insufficient evidence is adequately preserved for\nappeal through the filing of a pre-verdict Rule 50(a)\nmotion or whether a renewed post-verdict motion under Rule\n50(b) must be filed, as well. The text of Rule 50, the\npractical considerations that underlie contemporaneous\nobjection rules, and this Court's decisions construing\nRule 50 all indicate that a post-verdict motion is\nnecessary for adequate preservation of the claim.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think it may be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is the usual practice with\nregard to the pre-verdict motions? Are -- is the initial\none made at the close of the plaintiff's case --\nMR. STEWART: It often is. It can be made --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- and then renewed at the --\nat the end of all of the evidence?\nMR. STEWART: I think that's a very typical\npractice.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. STEWART: It doesn't -- it doesn't have to\nbe made at the close of the plaintiff case, but it can be\nmade at any time after the opposing party has had an\nadequate opportunity to be heard. And so --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But they're really different\nthings to be reviewed at those two times. I mean, at the\nend of all the evidence, there may be some matter that the\ndefendant inadvertently puts in that makes up the\ndeficiency in the plaintiff's case. So, it's really a\ndifferent motion, isn't it?\nMR. STEWART: It is requesting the same sort of\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of relief.\nMR. STEWART: -- relief, but it -- different\nconsiderations would affect the trial judge's decision\nwhether to grant the motion. And I think -- in a sense,\nthis goes to Justice Kennedy's question -- that is, one of\nthe reasons that, at least with respect to the motion\nthat's filed at the conclusion of all the evidence, that\nthese motions are almost uniformly not granted, the case\nis almost always submitted to the jury, because the\nthought is, very little is lost by submitting the case to\nthe jury, because the suit has been tried already, and\nthere may be substantial gains in efficiency from pursuing\nthat course. I think if a motion was made at the\nconclusion of the plaintiff's case, and the judge thought\nit clearly had merit and thought that a substantial\nsavings in cost and time would ensue from granting the\nmotion, the trial judge could take that into account in\ndeciding whether the motion should be granted or not. But\nI think -- I think it's important to look at the text of\nRule 50. And it's reprinted, among other places, at page\n57(a) of the appendix to the certiorari petition. And in\n-- at the beginning of Rule 50(a)(1), it says, \"If, during\na trial by jury, a party has been fully heard on an issue\nand there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a\nreasonable jury to find for that party on that issue, the\nCourt may determine the issue against that party.\" Again,\nthe word \"may\" is permissive.\nSo, while the judge may take into account\npotential savings in time and expense, the judge is never\nrequired to grant a Rule 50(a) motion, even if the judge\nis firmly persuaded that the evidence on the other side is\ninsufficient.\nAnd then, at the very bottom of the page, the\nfirst sentence of Rule 50(b) says, \"If, for any reason,\nthe Court does not grant a motion for judgment as a matter\nof law made at the close of all the evidence, the Court is\nconsidered to have submitted the action to the jury,\nsubject to the Court's later deciding the legal questions\nraised by the motion.\"\nAnd the significance of that sentence is that it\nsays, \"No matter what stated rationale the District Court\ngives\" -- whether the District Court simply says, \"I'm\nreserving the motion,\" or says, \"I'm denying it, because\nthe evidence is, in my view, clearly sufficient\" --\n\"whatever stated rationale the Court gives, the action\nwill be treated as a reservation of the legal questions.\"\nAnd I think one of the reasons that it would be\ninappropriate to allow appeal of a sufficiency claim\nwithout a renewed post-verdict motion is that in order to\nattain reversal on appeal, regardless of whether the\nremedy is entry of judgment or a new trial, the Court of\nAppeals has to be able to point to an erroneous ruling by\nthe District Court. And the reservation of a ruling on\nthe 50(a) motion, by its nature, can't be erroneous. That\nis, the judge is specifically authorized to submit the\ncase to the jury --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. Stewart, just let me\nclear up one thing of confusion. Is it not true that if\nthe District judge denies the motion before submitting the\ncase to the jury, within 10 days after the jury verdict,\nif no further motion is made, he would still -- the judge\nwould still have authority to change his mind and grant\nthe motion?\nMR. STEWART: We don't believe that that's the\ncase. That is, at this point, the rule has been amended\nso that the time for filing a post-verdict motion is 10\ndays after entry of judgment, rather than 10 days after\nverdict, as it used to be. But this Court said, in\nJohnson, that, in the absence of a renewed verdict post-\n-- a renewed motion post-verdict, neither the District\nCourt nor the Court of Appeals may order entry of judgment\nin the favor of the verdict loser. And I think that the\ntext of Rule 50(b) bears that out. If you look farther\ndown that paragraph, on page 58(a), the rule says,\n\"Submission of the case to the jury is to be treated -- or\nconsidered to be a reservation of the legal question.\"\nAnd then it said, \"The movant may renew the request.\" And\nthen that sentence says, \"In ruling on a renewed motion,\nthe Court may, if a verdict was returned, allow the\njudgment to stand or grant a new trial or order entry of\njudgment.\" And I think that phrase, \"in ruling on a new\n-- renewed motion,\" is significant, because the only\nexpress authority that the District Court has, post-\nverdict, to grant judgment as a matter of law is that the\ncourt may do so in ruling on a renewed motion. The rule\ndoesn't contemplate a situation --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So, you're saying that if the\njudge wants to do what I -- what I hypothesized, the judge\nshould say to the losing party, \"Renew your motion, and\nI'll grant it.\"\nMR. STEWART: That's correct. And the judge\ncould do that, either pre- or post-verdict. That is, pre-\nverdict, the judge could say, \"I think your motion may\nvery well have merit, but, in the interest of overall\nefficiency, I'm going to submit the case to the jury.\nBut, in the event that the jury comes back against you, I\nwould encourage you to renew that motion.\" There's\nnothing wrong with the judge encouraging the litigant to\nfile something like that, or signaling that the judge has\ndoubts about the sufficiency of the evidence. But the\nrule makes the renewed post-verdict motion a prerequisite\nto entry of judgment as a matter of law, post-verdict.\nAnd it --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me, if we adopt\nyour position, what should a trial court do if he,\nalternatively, would grant a new trial? Should he go\nahead and make that determination? He grants judgment\nNOV. And then he really is thinking, \"Well, I would have\ngranted a new trial.\" Should he go ahead and cover\nhimself against reversal by granting the new trial in the\nalternative, or --\nMR. STEWART: He should. And, indeed, this\nCourt, in -- as early as Montgomery Ward, have said that\nwas the better practice, and that requirement has since\nbeen codified in what is now Rule 50(c), which says that\nif the Court grants the motion for judgment as -- the\nrenewed motion for judgment as a matter of law, and there\nis also an alternative motion for a new trial, the judge\nshould rule on that, as well, and should basically say,\n\"In the event that my ruling on the JNOV -- or the JMOL\"\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: \"Shall.\" It does say \"shall.\nMR. STEWART: Yes, \"shall.\"\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It says \"shall.\" Thank you.\nMR. STEWART: So, \"In the event that my ruling\non the sufficiency question is reversed on appeal, the\nCourt of Appeals will know how I would have ruled on the\nnew-trial motion, and the processing of the case can be\nexpedited.\"\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's a -- it's a conditional\nruling on the new-trial motion.\nMR. STEWART: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Because if it were a ruling\non the new-trial motion, you would never get up to the\nCourt of Appeals.\nMR. STEWART: That's correct. But the Court --\nthis Court, in Montgomery Ward, noted that there may be\ninefficiencies if the District Court rules on the JNOV\nmotion, but doesn't rule on the conditional motion for new\ntrial, because if the JNOV -- if the ruling on the JNOV\nmotion is reversed on appeal, then there's a need for\nremand for further proceedings, and it's inefficient.\nBut to return to the point about taking an\nappeal from a Rule 50(a) motion, I think it would put a\nDistrict Court in an untenable position to say, \"You can\nreserve ruling on the 50(a) motion, even if you think the\nevidence is insufficient,\" and, indeed, it's usually the\nbetter practice to do so, but, if you do that, and the\njury comes back against the movant, the movant can take an\nimmediate appeal, and you can be reversed on the ground\nthat your ruling on the Rule 50(a) motion was erroneous.\nThere's simply no -- by its -- by the terms of the rule\nitself, the submission of the case to the jury, in the\nface of a Rule 50(a) motion, is considered to be a\nreservation of the sufficiency question.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, well, I don't know that\nyou have to read it that way. I mean, you can say that\nthe -- when the -- when the rule says that it -- that it\nis deemed to have been reserved, it also implies that the\nquestion that was reserved is implicitly resolved when the\ncourt does not -- does, later, not act. It's an implicit\ndenial. Why can't you read the rule that way?\nMR. STEWART: I mean, conceivably you could have\nread the rule that way at the time of Johnson, but first\nwe have this Court's decision in Johnson, which says the\nsubmission of a post-verdict Rule 50(b) motion is an\nessential prerequisite even for the District Court to act\non the motion. And, therefore, if the motion is not\nrenewed, the District Court is entitled to treat it as\nabandoned. And, second, the rule, in its current form,\nlimits the authority of the District Court to enter a\njudgment as a matter of law post-verdict to the situation\nwhere the court is ruling on a renewed motion. The rule\ndoesn't contemplate a situation in which the motion is not\nrenewed and yet the District Court purports to rule on the\n50(a) motion that was left hanging by the submission of\nthe case to the jury.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the plain-\nerror question?\nMR. STEWART: I think we would say, for some of\nthe same reasons that Mr. Bailey has identified, that\nplain-error review would be inappropriate, because in\norder to have plain error, there has to be error. And if\nthe gravamen of the appeal is that denial of the pre-\nverdict Rule 50(a) motion was plain error, it can't be\nright, because the pre-verdict -- the submission of the\ncase to the jury is treated, as a matter of law, as a\nreservation of the legal questions, and it can't be plain\nerror to reserve those questions for later decisions.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you Mr. Stewart.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- I understood. Sorry. Just\n-- I'm not sure I understood. Did you say that even when\nit's reserved, the judge cannot go back to the reserved\nmotion and grant it unless the motion is renewed?\nMR. STEWART: That's correct. That was -- that\nwas the fact in Johnson, that the District Court expressly\nreserved its ruling, and the court, nevertheless, held\nrenewal as essential.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Stewart.\nMr. Schroeder.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. SCHROEDER\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMR. SCHROEDER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nBefore getting to some of these questions that\nhave been discussed this morning, I think it's helpful to\nground ourselves a little bit in the fundamental decision\nmade by the Federal Circuit that is not within this\nCourt's grant of certiorari, and, therefore, is the\nfoundation from which we proceed. And, rather succinctly,\nthe Federal Circuit said, \"Unitherm never presented any\nevidence that could possibly support critical factual\nelements of its claim. In particular, Unitherm failed to\npresent any facts that could allow a reasonable jury to\naccept either its proposed market definition or its\ndemonstration of antitrust injury.\"\nBuilding on that foundation, Unitherm wants a\njudgment entered in its favor for $19 million for the\ninjury that they have never proven. And, to get there,\nthey have to accomplish each of three things. First --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I just stop you with that\npoint? Because one of the things that Unitherm said about\nthat argument -- which, as you prefaced, is not before us\n-- is, the Court of Appeals was looking to a truncated\nrecord to see whether there was sufficient evidence that,\nin fact, the record was much larger than the piece of it\nthat the Federal Circuit examined, so that the Federal\nCircuit, when it says there was no evidence, was looking\nto the appendix that was before us, but that was not the\nwhole picture.\nMR. SCHROEDER: Your Honor, in the Federal\nCircuit, each party had the -- had the ability to put any\npart of the record, or the entire record, before the\ncourt, and, under the Federal Circuit's own rule, they\nwere also entitled to go back to the District Court\nrecord, whether it was in the appendix or not. So, the\nentire record --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but if they had\nbeen on --\nMR. SCHROEDER: -- was --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- if they had been on\nnotice that insufficiency of the evidence was going to be\nan issue, they might have put more in the record about the\nsufficiency of the evidence.\nMR. SCHROEDER: When the case was appealed to\nthe Federal Circuit, Your Honor, insufficiency of the\nevidence was presented as an issue at that time. And so,\nthat was --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But under this Federal\nCircuit's own law, it could not be, because there had not\nbeen the post-verdict motion.\nMR. SCHROEDER: Well, that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The Federal Circuit is\nborrowing Tenth Circuit's law for this purpose, but the\nTenth Circuit's law, as I understand it, has -- is the\nposition that was just presented to us by Mr. Stewart.\nThat is, if you don't make what used to be called the\nJNOV, even if you made the directed verdict, you can't\nraise the sufficiency on appeal.\nMR. SCHROEDER: Well, Your Honor, going to the\nFederal Circuit, of course, the meaning of Rule 50 was in\ndispute. And it was certainly, at that point, ConAgra's\nposition that the evidence was sufficient -- was\ninsufficient, and that was the issue before --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't --\nMR. SCHROEDER: -- the court.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that the Federal Circuit's\nown rule? It -- it was, I thought, pretty clear what it\ntold us in that footnote, that if we were ruling -- making\nthe ruling -- the Federal Circuit law is, if you don't\nmake the 50(b) motion, you cannot get a reversal on appeal\nfor insufficient evidence.\nMR. SCHROEDER: That is the Federal Circuit rule\nin patent infringement cases. It was not the rule that\nthe Federal Circuit would apply in this case, because the\nFederal Circuit would apply --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Borrow --\nMR. SCHROEDER: -- apply the rule of --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the Tenth Circuit rule.\nMR. SCHROEDER: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. But that's -- in\nrespect to the Chief Justice's question, the -- Unitherm\ncould have thought, \"Well, the Federal Circuit is not\ngoing to deal with sufficiency; therefore, I don't have to\nbeef up\" --\nMR. SCHROEDER: Well --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- \"what I put in the\nappendix.\"\nMR. SCHROEDER: -- certainly, they did have to\ndeal with that, Your Honor, because one of the grounds for\nappeal was that there as no antitrust standing. So, this\nissue was before the Federal Circuit, no matter how you\nview the question. But I think in addition to that,\ncertainly everyone knew, when this case went to the\nFederal Circuit, that it was ConAgra's position that Tenth\nCircuit law applied, and that the evidence should be\nreviewed for its sufficiency --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but the -- the antitrust\nstanding issue is not the same as the relevant market\nissue that was decided, is it?\nMR. SCHROEDER: No, it's not, but it certainly\nis the same with respect to antitrust injury, and the\nFederal Circuit found there was no evidence of antitrust\ninjury. So, there, the entire record should have been\nbefore the Federal Circuit. And, in fact, it was. And\nso, when they made the determination that there was no\nevidence of antitrust injury, they did that in the\npresence of a full record on that issue. There was no way\nthat anyone could have thought that that issue was not\nbefore the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or as much of the record as the\nother side wanted to produce.\nMR. SCHROEDER: Well, we have to assume they\ncovered their bases, Your Honor, yes.\nNow, let me talk a little bit about some of\nthese issues that have come up.\nFirst, with respect to the motion for a new\ntrial, there was a motion for a new trial, under Rule 59,\nfiled in this case. The grounds for that motion were not\nsufficiency of the evidence; but, under Rule 59, when a\nmotion is made for a new trial, on any grounds, it is\nbefore the District Court on all grounds.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm looking at the motion\nthat you made, which was not in the first instance for a\nnew trial; it was for a remittitur. This is on page 34(a)\nof the joint appendix. And you made a motion, in the\nalternative, for a new trial on antitrust damages, not\nliability. So, I was really struck by the statement in\nyour brief that you had, indeed, made a motion for a new\ntrial. You made it a motion for a remittitur and, in the\nalternative, a new trial, limited to damages. You said\nnothing about a new trial on liability.\nMR. SCHROEDER: That's correct, Your Honor. I'm\nmerely pointing out that, under Rule 59, once a motion for\na new trial is made, all issues relating to a new trial\nare before the court.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: A new trial on damages --\nthat's all you asked for -- not a new trial on liability.\nMR. SCHROEDER: That's correct, Your Honor. But\nI certainly would refer the Court to the Cone case, which\nI think is very similar to this case, procedurally. In\nCone, there was a Rule 59 motion. There was no Rule 50(b)\n-- excuse me, a Rule 50(a) motion, no Rule 50(b) motion.\nThere was a motion for a new trial on the grounds of newly\ndiscovered evidence. Nevertheless, in the Cone case, the\nCourt remanded the case for further proceedings, and the\n-- and the court below considered the question. And, in\nthe end -- the published opinions indicate, that case went\nback to the Fourth Circuit, and --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It --\nMR. SCHROEDER: -- in the end --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- it was -- the new trial\nrequest had to do with liability --\nMR. SCHROEDER: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- whether it was for newly\ndiscovered evidence or something else. But you -- your\nmotion was limited to damages. And I really don't think\nthat you can get where you want to go from a motion that\nis limited to damages, when you didn't need to. You could\nhave made a motion for a new trial on the whole case.\nMR. SCHROEDER: Well, of course, Your Honor, if\nthere were no proof of damages, the whole antitrust claim\nwould fail. But I would also say that it seems to me that\nwhen a motion is made under Rule 50(a) for judgment as a\nmatter of law, that certainly permits the District Court\nto grant a new trial, because it's a lesser remedy. And\nwe see situations all the time --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why -- it's -- why\nis that a lesser remedy? It's just different. I mean,\nremittitur is a lesser remedy, too, but you don't say,\n\"Well, if you've made a motion for a new trial, and then\nthat falls by the wayside, you -- the court can do\nremittitur.\" The approach seems to be, \"Something's wrong\nhere, and we have to do something, so what is it that we\ncan do?\" And you look around, \"Well, maybe we can give\nthem a new trial, or maybe we can have a remittitur.\" But\nthere are different motions for all these different\nthings, and, if they haven't been made, they seem to be\noff the board.\nMR. SCHROEDER: Well, certainly, Your Honor --\nlet's take another example. Suppose a litigant asks, as\nsanctions, that the case be dismissed. Well, the District\nCourt certainly could say, \"Well, you have a point,\nsanctions are in order. But I'm not going to dismiss the\ncase, I'm going to give you something else.\" There are\nmany situations like that, where a particular remedy --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the problem there is\nstill the same. Whatever it is that gave rise to the\nmotion to dismiss as a sanction -- the misconduct by\ncounsel -- you're still addressing that same problem. But\na new trial addresses different issues than a judgment as\na matter of law, and remittitur addresses different issues\nthan a new trial.\nMR. SCHROEDER: Well, it seems to me that it is\nthe principal point of the trilogy that when a motion is\nmade for entry of judgment based on insufficiency of the\nevidence, that raises the question of whether there ought\nto be a new trial. That was the principal point discussed\nin the trilogy, that you really can't have one without the\nother.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The principal point was that\nthe Court of Appeals could not enter -- direct the entry\nof judgment as a matter of law if a 50(b) motion had not\nbeen made. That's what those three cases --\nMR. SCHROEDER: That's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- invoke.\nMR. SCHROEDER: -- absolutely correct, Your\nHonor, the trilogy stands for that proposition. But in\nall three cases of the trilogy, even though there was no\nRule 50(b) motion, those cases were all remanded. In no\ncase was the verdict winner who had insufficient evidence\nallowed to prevail. They just remanded the cases. So,\nthe Solicitor General relies on stare decisis, but he's\nasking the Court to do something radically different from\nwhat happened in any of those cases of the trilogy.\nThey're asking that judgment be entered for the party that\nfailed to --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Had Rule 59 motions been made\nin those cases?\nMR. SCHROEDER: It's not clear from the record,\nI don't believe, as to all of the cases, Your Honor, but\ncertainly it is clear in the first case, the Cone case,\nthat there was a motion for a new trial, but it was\nbased on different grounds. It was based on newly\ndiscovered evidence.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So far, you're halfway into\nyour argument. I thought the basic question here was,\nfirst, whether a Court of Appeals, or anybody, can grant a\nJ- -- what used to be called a JNOV without your making\nits -- whatever it's called now -- and without somebody\nmaking it a motion. And from your not opposing that, I\nguess the answer to the question is, of course not. Of\ncourse you have to make a motion. You have to make a\nmotion for everything. The judge is not a genius. He\ncan't -- is not a mindreader. And if you don't make a\nmotion, you lose. Okay? Now, is there any argument\nagainst that?\nMR. SCHROEDER: When you say \"that,\" Your Honor,\nyou mean with respect to the -- to the new trial or with\nrespect --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I -- I mean, I thought --\nthere are two parts to this. Question one is, Can you\npossibly get a judgment -- what used to be called a JNOV\nor a JMOL or whatever -- from the Court of Appeals, when\nyou didn't make a motion for it, after the jury came in,\nin the District Court?\nMR. SCHROEDER: The --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They say, \"Of course you have\nto make a motion.\" And, so far, I've heard no response\nwhatsoever to what I'd think is a fairly basic question in\nthis case. And I'm assuming: of course you have to make a\nmotion.\nMR. SCHROEDER: Yes, Your Honor. I'm glad you\nraised that point, because it is the fundamental point of\nthe case. Rule 50(a) provides that a motion for judgment\nas a matter of law can be made, and specifically says that\nthe judge can grant that motion. And then the rule goes\non to say that that motion is deemed to continue to be\npending. There is nothing in Rule --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, it doesn't say it -- it is\ndeemed to continue to be pending. The issue is deemed to\nbe reserved.\nMR. SCHROEDER: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Which is a very different\nissue. In other words, it's not waived and over with at\nthat point, but it says nothing whatsoever, in express\nterms, about pending motions.\nMR. SCHROEDER: Oh, I agree, Your Honor. I\nparaphrased the rule. But the point is that the motion is\nstill pending. In --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, the issue is reserved. The\nmotion has been ruled upon. The judge says, \"No, I'm not\ngoing to grant this motion before submitting the issue to\nthe jury.\" That's the end of the motion. The issue isn't\nover with, because it can be raised again after the\nverdict. Isn't that what the rule provides?\nMR. SCHROEDER: That's certainly not the way I\nwould read it, Your Honor, because in this case --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How about a --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: That's the way this Court has\nread it. That's the problem.\nMR. SCHROEDER: I don't believe so, Your Honor,\nbecause if the Court -- if the rule says that the Rule\n50(a) motion can be granted; conversely, it can be denied.\nIf it can be granted or denied, those decisions are\nappealable under section 2106, which is the general\nprovision that orders of the court can be appealed. I do\nnot see anything in Rule 50 that says that denial of the\n50(a) motion is not appealable. What Rule 50(b) does is\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it can't -- it can't be\n-- it would be interlocutory at that stage. It couldn't\nbe raised until final judgment is entered.\nMR. SCHROEDER: Well, Your Honor, I think that\nwould be a most peculiar rule. Entering judgment in a\ncase is one of the most fundamental and important things\nthat a court does.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but you don't go up on\nappeal with a final judgment rule, a firm final judgment\nrule, as there is in the Federal system, from the denial\nor refusal to act on a 50(a) motion.\nMR. SCHROEDER: Well --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The trial isn't over. There\nis no judgment. You can't appeal til you have a final\njudgment.\nMR. SCHROEDER: That's certainly correct, Your\nHonor, there can be no appeal without a final judgment.\nBut what I'm saying is that an interpretation of Rule 50,\nas a whole, which says to the trial court judge that a\njudgment should be entered without resolving the question\nof whether there is sufficient evidence, and then take\nthat up later, under Rule 50(b), isn't a very good way to\nproceed.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, there is, you know -- I\nmean, this truly is a case where a page of history is\nworth much more than logic. The reason for that somewhat\nstrange language is, at common law, it was thought, once\nthe jury came in with a verdict, that was it, the judge\nhad no power to overturn it, because of the Seventh\nAmendment's Reexamination Clause, \"no fact tried by a\njury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any court of the\nUnited States, than according to the rules of common law.\"\nAnd the rule of common law that is embodied in this\nsomewhat strange language in Rule 50 is that there could\nbe a reserved question so that after the jury comes in\nwith the verdict, the judge would be deciding the pre-\nverdict question by this post-verdict motion. I mean,\nthere's -- none of this is in doubt, where this language\nin 50 comes from. It comes from a need to adjust to the\nReexamination Clause of the Seventh Amendment. Isn't that\nso?\nMR. SCHROEDER: Yes, that's all correct, Your\nHonor. But if there were no provision of the rule that\nreserved decision under 50(a), I would still say that the\ndenial of the 50(a) motion should be appealable when the\njudgment is entered, because the -- all of the prior\norders of the court merge into that judgment when it's\nentered.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you don't get it out of\nthat language, because that language is there for the\nspecific purposes of allowing a judge, after their\nverdict, to enter judgment NOV.\nMR. SCHROEDER: Yes, Your Honor. It certainly\nis there for that purpose. But the rule doesn't mandate\nthat the court -- that the case proceed by that route.\nWhat I'm saying is that once the 50(a) motion is made and\ndenied, the stage is set for an appeal pursuant to section\n2106. The Rule 50(b) route is merely there to allow a\nlitigant, who does not believe that the issue has been\nfully heard, briefed, considered by the court, to raise\nthe issue again, but not to put us in the position where,\nin the normal course, the judge follows the usual\nprocedure of submitting the case to the jury, because the\njury may resolve the problem by deciding the case in favor\nof the party that should win on the evidence, but then, at\nthat point, the judge merely has to enter -- has to enter\njudgment in order to trigger the 50(b) motion. That\ndoesn't seem to be a good way to proceed, and I don't\nbelieve that's what's contemplated by the rule. And, in\nfact, it is a common practice among --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: He doesn't enter judgment to\ntrigger the 50(b) motion. The 50(b) motion is made in\nbetween the verdict and the entry of judgment.\nMR. SCHROEDER: Well, Your Honor, the rule says\nthat it can be made up to 10 days --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Right.\nMR. SCHROEDER: -- after the entry of judgment.\nSo, from the point of view of the District Court, if the\ncourt ever wants to get to the end, wants to put a time\nlimit on this, the only way to do it is to enter judgment.\nThat forces the moving party to get a 50(b) motion --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I don't --\nMR. SCHROEDER: -- on account of the defendant.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- I don't follow that,\nbecause you -- you know, I'm sure, that it's almost\nroutine that -- yes, you have the 10 days, the extra 10\ndays, under the rules -- but isn't it almost routine, at a\ntrial, that the verdict loser will say, \"Judge, please\ngive me JNOV, or, if not, a new trial\"? They don't wait\ntil after the judgment is made -- entered. They could.\nBut it's just -- well, in the trials I've seen, it's\nalmost by rote that lawyers who lose, where the jury comes\nin for the other side, will renew the judgment-as-a-\nmatter-of-law motion and ask, in the alternative, for a\nnew trial. Isn't that the common practice?\nMR. SCHROEDER: Well, I think it's a common\npractice in those circuits which have indicated that a\n50(b) motion is required to preserve all rights to\nappellate review. Whether or not it is the common\npractice in other circuits where that is not required, I'm\nnot sure. Certainly --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it's not a question of\nwhat is required or what is permissive, but isn't it to\nthe lawyer's advantage, to the client's advantage, to say\nto the judge, sooner rather than later, \"Look don't enter\njudgment. Give me -- give me judgment NOV or at least a\nnew trial\"?\nMR. SCHROEDER: Well, Your Honor, this case may\nbe a little different from some, in that the precise issue\nthat was presented to the Federal Circuit, the failure of\nproof, was something that was identified very early in the\ncase. And it was presented numerous times to the District\nCourt by a way of a summary judgment motion, by way of the\npretrial briefs. And the issue had not changed. And, in\nfact, when the 50(a) motion was made, at the end of the\ntrial, the Court may have noticed that it was made in a\nrather peculiar way, an attorney attempting to persuade\nthe court that that motion should be granted wouldn't\nbegin the motion by saying, \"For the record.\" But that's\nwhat happened here. It was known, at that point, that the\njudge had made up her mind as to this issue, and wasn't\ngoing to change it, and, in fact, declined, on several\noccasions, to even listen to argument on the point. So,\nthe filing of a 50(b) motion would seem to be contrary to\nthe generally accepted practice that attorneys are not --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, if -- should we\ndisagree with you, Mr. Schroeder, on that, you seem to\nfall back, at the end of the day, on a plain-error notion.\nIs --\nMR. SCHROEDER: Well --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- that right?\nMR. SCHROEDER: -- there are several things that\nwe would fall back on, Your Honor. When you say \"fall\nback,\" I assume that that means if the Court were not to\nfollow the precedent of the trilogy --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: If we don't agree with you on\nthe --\nMR. SCHROEDER: On the meaning of --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- need for a --\nMR. SCHROEDER: -- the trilogy.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- 50(b) motion.\nMR. SCHROEDER: Okay. Under those\ncircumstances, there were two questions. One is, of\ncourse, plain error, and the other is retroactivity.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Have we ever said that plain\nerror would preserve this, in the civil context?\nMR. SCHROEDER: No, Your Honor. We have found\nno case, either way --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: No, I --\nMR. SCHROEDER: -- on that.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- haven't either.\nMR. SCHROEDER: It's -- there's no precedent\nthat --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But even if there were, how\ncould this kind of error ever be plain?\nMR. SCHROEDER: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Ever?\nMR. SCHROEDER: Your Honor, I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If there's no evidence at all.\nYou have a patent, and a patent is a monopoly. And so,\nwhat -- obviously, it monopolizes a market, it monopolizes\nthe market of the patent. And you'd have to be a genius in\nantitrust law to know something's wrong with that\nargument. And so, how could it all be plain?\nMR. SCHROEDER: Well, Your Honor, there was\nanother claim in this case on which Unitherm did recover,\nwhich is not before this Court, which was a claim for --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That has nothing to do with my\nquestion.\nMR. SCHROEDER: Sure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You were saying that the\nmistake was that there was not sufficient evidence that\nthere was injury of an antitrust kind, and that there was\na market. So, I'm saying a person who knows a little, but\nnot a lot, of antitrust law would think, \"Obviously,\nthere's a market here. There's the market covered by the\npatent.\"\nMR. SCHROEDER: Well, there's not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Obviously, there's injury,\nbecause a patent allows you to raise the price. End of\nthe matter. Now, that's naive, but somebody who doesn't\nknow antitrust law thoroughly couldn't possibly think that\nthere is plain error here. What's the response to that?\nMR. SCHROEDER: Well, I think, Your Honor, first\nof all, in determining plain error, it's necessary to put\nit in the context of this case, where that very issue had\nbeen raised repeatedly and had, in fact, been ruled on by\nthe court in denying the summary judgment motion. So, we\nweren't dealing with someone who was naive in this\nrespect. We were dealing with someone who had faced this\nprecise issue, and the very closely related issue of\nantitrust standing, which focuses on antitrust injury.\nSo, we got to this point in the trial. We had a great\ndeal of history --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What I'm worried about, to put\nall my cards on the table -- if we were to say there is\neven a possibility of plain error in this case, the plain-\nerror exception in the rules would become a monster,\nwherein complex cases, people who hadn't made the proper\nmotions would all be arguing plain error just as if they\nhad.\nMR. SCHROEDER: Well, certainly the plain-error\nargument is always, in a sense, available, Your Honor.\nBut I do think this is an extreme case, and I think that's\nreflected by what the Federal Circuit said, that I read at\nthe beginning of my argument. But that's extremely\nstrong.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's an extreme case,\nbecause there's insufficient evidence?\nMR. SCHROEDER: It's an extreme case for a\nnumber of reasons, and that's certainly one of them.\nThere isn't just insufficient --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's --\nMR. SCHROEDER: -- evidence, but --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- not going to be plain\nerror in every insufficient-evidence case.\nMR. SCHROEDER: No, but in -- this is a -- an --\na case in which the insufficiency of the evidence was\nextremely apparent. These parties --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right, let's assume it's\nextremely apparent. Isn't -- and assume, just for the\nsake of argument, that we have a simple case, not a\ncomplex case, so it's easy to see that, in fact, the\nevidence falls short. It's still the case that this Court\nhas discouraged, or has certainly -- has either\ndiscouraged the granting of motions at the close of the\nplaintiff's case, or at the close of all the evidence --\nin any event, has put its imprimatur on denying those\nmotions, subject to renewal after verdict. How can we\npossibly find that there is plain error when a court does\nexactly what we have encouraged them to do in order not to\nwaste a lot of trial time and jury time? How could we\never find there is plain error, except with respect to the\nrenewed motion after the verdict?\nMR. SCHROEDER: Well, Your Honor, certainly\nwhere the motion has been made and has, in fact, been\nbriefed, and has been considered by the court, and where\nyou have a situation in which --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And we have said, \"Don't grant\nit.\"\nMR. SCHROEDER: I'm sorry, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And we have said, \"Don't grant\nit.\"\nMR. SCHROEDER: Well, Your Honor, I guess we'd\ngo back to the proposition that -- I believe that the\nDistrict Court could grant the 50(a) motion later; it did\nnot have to wait for a 50(b) motion. And, in fact, it is a\nvery common practice --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It could do that even after it\nhad ruled upon it and had denied it?\nMR. SCHROEDER: Well, certainly in situations\nwhere the Court simply enters judgment and doesn't deny\nthe motion first, that would be true --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I --\nMR. SCHROEDER: -- would be true. But --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- I --\nMR. SCHROEDER: -- even here --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- I will -- I will grant you\nthat, were it not for our cases, textually, the argument\nyou make is possible. But I don't see how you can make\nthat argument without our overruling a lot of law.\nMR. SCHROEDER: Well, Your Honor, I -- when it\ncomes to \"overruling a lot of law,\" I think that the\nfundamental fact here is that, in the trilogy, the case\nwas always sent back for a new trial. Never was judgment\nentered in favor of the party that had failed to prove its\ncase. So --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Sent back to -- for a new\ntrial because the Court of Appeals ordered a new trial, or\nsent back to the trial court for that court to decide as a\nmatter of that court's discretion, whether to order --\nMR. SCHROEDER: That's correct. Sent back --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- a new trial? The latter.\nMR. SCHROEDER: -- to the District --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it --\nMR. SCHROEDER: -- Court.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- it was not -- but, here,\nyou're asking us to affirm something that a Court of\nAppeals did.\nMR. SCHROEDER: Well, the -- the Court of\nAppeals ruled that the case should go back to the District\nCourt. We are asking this Court to affirm that and send\nthe case back to the District Court, as a Federal Circuit\nruled.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not even sure your argument\nis so strong on the text, frankly. I don't know why 50(b)\nsays -- it sets forth what can be done when the renewed\nmotion is made. You can, if a verdict was returned, allow\nit to stand, order a new trial, direct entry of judgment.\nIf no verdict was returned, order a new trial, direct --\nWhy does the rule only say, \"In ruling on a renewed\nmotion, the Court may\"?\nMR. SCHROEDER: Well, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't it say, \"In ruling\non a renewed motion or in acting upon the motion\npreviously reserved,\" comma, \"the Court may\"?\nMR. SCHROEDER: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, where --\nMR. SCHROEDER: -- I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- and where does it get the\npower to do these things, in ruling on a motion previously\nreserved, if it's not set forth there?\nMR. SCHROEDER: If you look at 50(a), Your\nHonor, it specifically says that the 50(a) motion can be\ngranted. Now, that would be inconsistent with a view of\nthe rule that says that the only remedies available are\nset forth in section (b) and triggered by the renewal of\nthe motion.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, I'm talking about the only\nremedy available after the motion has been reserved, after\n--\nMR. SCHROEDER: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- the court has declined to\nrule on it once.\nMR. SCHROEDER: Well, if the motion is reserved,\nand the court has declined to rule on it, then the -- it\nwould seem to me that it follows that the court can grant\nthat motion.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that's all.\nMR. SCHROEDER: Well, it can also enter\njudgment, which constitutes another denial --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can it order a new trial?\nMR. SCHROEDER: Yes. Most certainly. Because\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where does he get that power,\nunder (a)?\nMR. SCHROEDER: It is a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Unless --\nMR. SCHROEDER: It is a lesser remedy --\nthan the one requested, that was --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, well, then it shouldn't\nhave been set forth in (b). You didn't have to say it.\nYou could have just said, you know, \"Allow\" --\nMR. SCHROEDER: Well, Rule 50(a) doesn't\nliterally say that the motion can be denied. It simply\nsays that it can be granted. But I think we have to infer\nfrom that, that it can be denied. And I would equally\ninfer that a lesser remedy is possible once the 50(a)\nmotion is made. But I don't think it's possible to read\nthe rule as saying that the only way these remedies are\navailable is through a 50(b) motion, because that's\ninconsistent with the provision that the motion can be\ngranted under 50(a).\nThe -- it, further, seems to me that if the --\nif the motion is -- if decision on the motion is deemed to\nbe had -- to have been deferred, then that motion is still\nbefore the court, even if the court has denied it. And\nthe court can grant it later on --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but the --\nMR. SCHROEDER: -- instead of interjecting --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- rule doesn't deem it to have\nbeen deferred. A judge may, in fact, not rule on it,\nalthough he does not grant it. But the rule does not say\nthat the motion is deemed to be deferred. The rule talks\nabout the issue being reserved, which is a different\nthing. And the issue may be reserved whether the judge\nrules on the motion or simply says, \"I will take it under\nadvisement and you can renew it after the verdict if you\nwant to.\" Isn't that correct?\nMR. SCHROEDER: Well, I would have stopped\nsooner, Your Honor. I would have said, \"I will take it\nunder advisement.\" That is really the essence of the\nrule, that the Court has this under advisement. And it is\na very common --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that may be, but it's\nstill the case that the rule does not deem the -- this\nrule does not deem, in my terms, the ruling on the pre-\nverdict motion to have been deferred.\nMR. SCHROEDER: Well, Your Honor, it is\ncertainly a common practice that, while the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm asking you about what this\nrule says. Did I just get the rule wrong?\nMR. SCHROEDER: Well, Your Honor, I think that\nif ruling on that motion --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If you don't --\nMR. SCHROEDER: -- had been inferred --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- want to answer the question,\njust say so.\nMR. SCHROEDER: No, I'm -- I'm very pleased to\nanswer the question, Your Honor. I believe that the rule\npermits the judge to decide the 50(a) motion at any time\nprior to entering judgment. And the judge can change his\nor her mind on that at any time, because the issue is\nstill before the court.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can a judge grant a new trial\non a 50(a) motion?\nMR. SCHROEDER: Yes, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMR. SCHROEDER: Thank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Bailey, you have 1\nminute remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BURCK BAILEY\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. BAILEY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you agree on the answer --\nwith the answer to the last question I asked? Can -- on a\n50(a) motion, can a judge grant a new trial instead of\ngranting judgment?\nMR. BAILEY: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't.\nMR. BAILEY: The result ConAgra contends for\nhere, may it please the Court, leads to some really bad\nresults. It requires the rejection of longstanding\nprecedent by this Court. It overrules the jurisprudence\nof eight circuits. It offends the special competency of\nthe trial court. It deprives the appellate court of the\ntrial court's evaluation, an impartial evaluation of the\nsufficiency of the evidence, so the appellate court is\nleft to sift through the record, an entire record,\nsearching for points that have never been joined below.\nAnd it creates confusion, subjectivity, and differing\nlegal standards nationwide.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Bailey.\n"
