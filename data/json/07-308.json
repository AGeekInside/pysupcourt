        "content": "(10:41 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Case 07-308, United States versus Clintwood\nElkhorn Mining Company.\nMr. Jay.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. JAY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nRespondent sought and received a full refund\nof the tax they paid on exported coal for the full\nthree-year period permitted them by the tax-refund\nstatute. What the court of appeals' decision permitted\nthem to do was to bring an additional action for\nindistinguishable relief, but for a three-year period\nbeyond what the tax-refund statute permits.\nWe submit that that decision was erroneous\nfor two principal reasons: First, the plaintiff --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It might help if you\nraise that lectern a bit.\nMR. JAY: Hang on.\nIs that better, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, thank you.\nMR. JAY: Thank you.\nThe plain and unabiguous terms of the\ntax-refund statute, section 7422(a), expressly provide\nthat any claimant who alleges that a tax has been\nillegally assessed, no matter the reason, must before\nproceeding to court file a refund claim with the\nInternal Revenue Service within three years after filing\nthe tax return on which the illegal tax was paid.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Jay, is the government\nrunning with the fox and chasing with the hounds? You\nwant us to apply the provisions governing the Internal\nRevenue Code with regard to whether the statute has\nexpired, but when it comes to interest you say oh, no,\nno, no, that doesn't apply. Why? Why shouldn't the two\ngo pari passu, as we say?\nMR. JAY: Well, we think, Your Honor, that\nthe interest provision is in fact a key part of the\ntax-refund statute and so Respondent's attempt to invoke\nthe tax-refund judgment interest provision is\ninconsistent with their theory, that they're proceeding\noutside the scope of the tax ---\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, yes, they make the same\nmistake, but that doesn't justify your making the same,\nthe same mistake.\nMR. JAY: Well, we think, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it's either, you\nknow, they're both in one pot or they're both in the\nother pot. And both sides want to -- want to split them\nup, but why don't they go together?\nMR. JAY: Well, we think the whole case is\nin the Title 26 pot, Your Honor, that the whole case\nshould proceed under the provisions of Title 26, meaning\nthat Respondents have already received the full tax\nrefund to which they are entitled. And to be sure, they\nreceived interest on that refund. And had they to sue\nfor it, they would have received interest under section\n2411. But because they are -- because they are no\nlonger able to proceed under the exclusive tax-refund\nprocedure, of course we think that they -- that they\ncan't plead around that by claiming constitutional\ndamages instead.\nBut if the Court were to agree with them and\nagree that they could pursue damages for a violation of\nthe Export Clause, section 2411 does not apply to such a\nclaim because it's not a claim for an overpayment of\ntax. The term \"overpayment\" in the interest statute\nties back to the section 6402, which is the linchpin of\nthe tax-refund statute. And the -- when a taxpayer has\nmade an overpayment, that triggers the obligation of the\nIRS to provide a tax refund if one is timely sought, and\nif one isn't timely sought, as this Court recognized in\nthe Brockamp case, the Congress has provided an\nunusually emphatic limitation on the Commissioner's\nability to refund.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can you explain one thing\nto me? I take it that they -- everybody says they went\nthrough all the right IRS hoops to get back three years'\nworth of damages, i.e., they get their payments back and\nthey get interest.\nMR. JAY: That's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, what they want is they\nwant three years before that.\nMR. JAY: That's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And they're too late under\nTitle 26. So what you're saying is, one, you can't get\nany interest and, two, you can't get your money back at\nall.\nMR. JAY: Well, on the interest, Your Honor,\nwe're saying that they were entitled to the interest on\nthe three years.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm saying for three years\nthey're home-free. They get their payment back and they\nget their interest. Now let's go to the three preceding\nyears. I'm a little confused about that because I can't\nwork out -- I suppose that the government is saying:\nYou get nothing, you don't get your money back, and you\ndon't get your interest. Or is the government saying:\nYou get your money back; you just don't get the\ninterest? Which is it? And I don't see how it could be\nthe latter.\nMR. JAY: It is the former, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMR. JAY: -- because we're saying that\nbecause Respondents waited for 21 years while paying the\ntax without -- without filing a refund claim, that\nthey're limited to the three years immediately preceding\nthe refund claim --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right. I thought you were\nmaking a second argument, that even if they were\nentitled to it despite the statute, they wouldn't be\nentitled to interest. You don't make that claim?\nMR. JAY: No. If they were entitled to sue,\nnot under the tax -- under the tax code at all, but on\nthe theory countenanced by the court of appeals, that\nthis is not a suit for a tax refund at all, but a suit\nfor damages arising directly under the Constitution --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I see.\nMR. JAY: -- then there is no provision in\nTitle 28 or anywhere else that provides the required\nexpress provision --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. JAY: -- of interest that's necessary to\naward interest against the government.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right. Right. Okay.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But why shouldn't it be a\nsuit contesting the constitutionality? I mean, in the\nusual case where you seek a refund, there are\nadjustments that have to be made. But here, if the only\nquestion is the constitutionality of the tax, then what\nis the point of going through any kind of administrative\nprocess of the refund route?\nMR. JAY: In the context of the coal tax,\nYour Honor, and the Export Clause claim, the purpose of\nrequiring exhaustion, requiring Respondents to proceed\nbefore the IRS, is that the coal tax is exempt from\ntaxation under the Constitution only if the coal at the\nmoment the tax is imposed, which in this case is when\nit's first sold by the manufacturer, the mining company,\nif at that moment, the coal was in the stream of export.\nAnd in the context of the coal industry that can be a\nfairly fact-specific question, and the IRS technical\nadvice memorandum that we've cited on page 11 of our\nreply brief explains that to some degree. So it's\npossible for a timely refund claim to allow the IRS to\nexamine the facts and circumstances of the transaction\nand determine whether in fact the coal was in the stream\nof export at all.\nFurther, the IRS -- if it has only an excise\ntax return from the taxpayer, IRS has no idea what\npercentage of that coal was exported. Well over 90\npercent of the coal mined in the United States remains\nin the United States and there's nothing on Form 720,\nthe excite tax return, that specifies how much of that\ncoal is exported. So effectively by filing the two-page\nrefund claim the taxpayer puts the IRS on notice of what\npercentage of coal in the given years was in fact in the\nstream of export when it was sold, whether in fact the\nbroker or whoever purchased it actually purchased it,\nactually exported it from the country, and also how --\nwhat the dollar amount of tax refund is being sought.\nSo all of those, we think, are perfectly\nvalid purposes for requiring a short but reasonable time\nto proceed before the IRS. And if the IRS denies the\nclaim, then of course Respondents could have proceeded\ndirectly to court.\nThe IRS did not in fact deny their claim,\nand the IRS has issued a notice of acquiescence\nspecifying that the coal tax -- coal taxpayers who paid\nthis coal tax and filed timely refund claims will\nreceive a refund to the full extent that Congress has\npermitted the IRS to grant refunds.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Plus interest.\nMR. JAY: Plus interest, that's right, Your\nHonor. Under section 6611, interest is fully available\non refunds. And again, if the -- if the IRS had denied\nthe claims and Respondents had been forced to go to\ncourt, they would have received interest accounting for\nthat time delay as well.\nSo we think that Section 7422 is the\nexclusive means of bringing a claim that a tax was\nillegally or erroneously assessed or collected. The\nterms of the statute are clear; they're unambiguous; and\nthey're exclusive. 7422(a) simply is the only way of\nbringing this claim.\nAnd we think that whether Respondents\ndenominate their claim as a statutory-refund claim or a\nconstitutional claim, the terms of section 7244(a)\nplainly cover it. So we think that the Court need not\nnecessarily answer the question of whether the Export\nClause creates a self-enforcing cause of action at all.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could the IRS say\nthat the statute -- or Congress, I guess, say the\nstatute of limitations is one month?\nMR. JAY: To file a timely refund claim,\nYour Honor?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, and anything\nafter that, any constitutional violation after that, is\njust not remediable?\nMR. JAY: Well, the constitutional violation\nwould have taken place before in Your Honor's\nhypothetical.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Five weeks before.\nMR. JAY: In the McKesson case, Your Honor,\nthe Court outlined a number of the options that taxing\nauthorities have to respect their strong fiscal interest\nin the stability of their tax revenues while providing\nappropriate relief. And the Court listed as one way in\nwhich States can -- States and other taxing authorities\ncan protect that by providing a short statute of\nlimitations. The Court also suggested that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We're talking about\n-- we're talking about the Constitution here. And in\neffect -- I mean, I assume I could run through the usual\nroutine. I mean, you wouldn't say they could have a\nstatute of limitations of two days, right?\nMR. JAY: Well, Your Honor, in McKesson the\nCourt pointed to another alternative, which is requiring\nthat the tax be paid under protest. And that\neffectively is a statute of limitations of zero days, in\nthat when -- you know, that when the tax is paid, the\ntaxpayer has to identify the basis of the constitutional\nchallenge and the amount being paid under protest.\nAnd under -- and before the Tucker Act, and\nindeed in the early years of the Tucker Act, taxes had\nto be paid under protest or the taxpayer was out, was\nout the remedy against the collector. And Congress has\nsince provided that in general taxpayers don't have to\npay their taxes under protest. Instead, they can bring\na refund claim within three years afterwards. But that\nthree-year limitation period, while relatively generous,\nis absolute.\nAnd the Court held in the Brockamp case that\nthe three years can't be extended, not even for an\nindividual taxpayer suffering from senile dementia for\nthe entire time period.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you think there are any\ncircumstances in which a taxpayer can bring a claim\nunder the Tucker Act for the refund of an\nunconstitutional tax?\nMR. JAY: Well, we think -- I want to\nclarify, Your Honor, that any lawsuit, whether it's on\nRespondent's theory or on our theory, any lawsuit that's\nfiled is in fact under the Tucker Act.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, any situation in which\nsuch a suit can be brought without having filed a claim\npreviously with the IRS?\nMR. JAY: If the only -- if the only basis\nfor the taxpayers' recovery is that the taxpayer has\npaid a tax and the tax was illegally or erroneously\nassessed because it was unconstitutional, we think that\nsection 7422(a) and the associated time limits provide\nthe procedure for recovering under the Tucker Act.\nSection 2501, which is what Respondents\ncontend is the only procedure that applies to the claims\nthat they have brought, section 2501, as the Court\nrecognized --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Just to be clear, so your\nargument is not limited to the Export Clause. It\ndoesn't matter what provision of the Constitution the\ntax violates. The same rule would apply?\nMR. JAY: Well, the Congress has made no\ndistinction in the statute between one type of\nconstitutional claim and another, or indeed one type of\nillegality or another. And we've cited some -- some\nexamples in our opening brief of numerous constitutional\nprovisions that taxpayers may bring challenges under.\nAnd there are at least five clauses in the original\nConstitution that regulate the Federal Government's\ntaxing authority. There are at least four more that\nregulate the States, and, you know, not to mention the\nBill of Rights.\nSo constitutional claims are commonly\nbrought by taxpayers against Federal taxes, and the\ntax-refund procedure provides a full -- a fully\neffective, fully adequate way of vindicating that right.\nThe only requirement is that it be submitted in writing\nto the IRS within three years after filing the tax\nreturn in question.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you know, what happened\nbefore the Tucker Act with inverse condemnation claims?\nThe government violates the Fifth Amendment Takings\nClause or the Fourteenth Amendment Takings Clause\napplied to the Fifth by inverse condemnation, and there\nis no Tucker Act. Was there a constitutional cause of\naction for damages?\nMR. JAY: Before there was the Tucker Act,\nYour Honor, when the government took property and was\nobliged to pay compensation, the claim was presented to\nCongress; and Congress could legislative relief by a\nprivate bill.\nEventually, Congress created the Court of\nClaims purely as an Article I tribunal. There was no\njudicial review because the decisions were always\nsubject to revision by Congress. And eventually\nCongress, having tired of adjudicating all these claims\nin a legislative manner, gave the Court of Claims\nindependent status with its decisions reviewable in\nArticle III courts. And so, by enacting the Tucker Act,\ntakings claims became brought in the Court of Federal\nClaims.\nSo, because we think Section 7422(a) is a\ncompletely adequate remedy for any constitutional claim\nthat Respondents might bring, we submit that this\nCourt's Bivens cases and this Court's unlawful-tax cases\nshow that there is no warrant to create a new cause of\naction directly under the Constitution in circumstances\nlike this where the taxpayer has a fully effective\nremedy, allows that remedy to become time-barred, but\ninstead brings a claim, purportedly under the\nConstitution, against the identical defendant, in the\nidentical forum seeking the identical relief. Under\nthose circumstances, this Court has never fashioned a\nBivens-type implied cause of action for a violation of\nthe Constitution.\nIndeed, in Bush versus Lucas, Schweiker\nversus Chilicky, and other cases, the Court has\nrecognized that when Congress has legislated a remedial\nscheme, it doesn't -- this Court will still stay its\nhand before creating a new Bivens action, even if that\nremedial scheme has very short time limits, such as the\n30-day time limit, the civil service remedies that were\nat issue in Bush, or the exhaustion requirement of Title\nVII which substitutes for an equal-protection claim for\nFederal employees.\nEven in those circumstances, and even if the\nremedies that are available are equitable and not money\ndamages, even in those circumstances this Court will not\ncreate a new cause of action for money damages. And in\nthis case, if Respondents had filed in a timely way in\nthis -- referring to the relief that they're seeking in\nthis case, they're seeking relief for 1994, 1995 and\n1996. If they had filed by April 30th, 1997, by which\npoint Cyprus Amex Coal Company was already vigorously\nlitigating the constitutionality of the Cole excise tax\nin the Court of Federal Claims, if they had filed by\nthat time, they could have received full relief.\nSo their failure to assert their rights in a\ntimely way certainly didn't give the court of appeals\nwarrant to create a new Bivens-type implied right of\naction.\nIf the Court has no further questions at\nthis time, I'll reserve.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. JAY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Millett.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis is a question of statutory construction\nand the problem, as this Court's precedent has made\nclear in Enochs versus Williams Packing, is that if\ngovernment -- if the government wants to enjoy the\nspecial, extraordinary protections of the tax-refund\nscheme, it has to assert a plausible basis for tax\nliability. It hasn't done that here. There was never\nany claim that they have any legitimate right to this\nrevenue as a source, as a basis, for taxes; that they\nhave any legitimate tax regulatory power over this\nexport process; or that they have any legitimate basis\nfor defending the statute as constitutional under any\ncircumstances of the law --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Millett, if it was --\nif it was that obvious, why did it take so long for the\ncoal companies to realize that the government owed them\nmoney?\nMS. MILLETT: Justice Stevens, that's\nbecause my clients are not Fortune 100 companies, and I\ndon't think the Constitution or the Congress imposes a\ntax or tax code that require that sort of level of\nscrutiny.\nI've got -- we've clients here that are\nsmall. They have no in-house lawyers and they had\naccountants who paid the taxes. And so the short answer\nis they didn't notice.\nIt's not that they looked at it and thought\nit was constitutional. One thing that is clear is that\nas soon as anybody looked at this statute, as soon as\nanybody -- the courts, the government that collected the\ntax for 20 years and did have a constitutional duty to\nlook at the Constitution, as soon as anyone looked at\nit, there was no defense offered. This is an\nextraordinary case, where the government made no effort\nto defend this tax whatsoever in district court.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Were there any other cases\nwhere they said, well, it's not in the stream of\ncommerce yet, and there was an intermediate broker, or\nanything like that? Are there any complexities like\nthat?\nMS. MILLETT: Justice Kennedy, there is a\nstatutory definition, 26 U.S.C. 1421, that deals with\nstream of commerce and it mirrors this Court's decision\nin the A.G. Spalding case, which says that either the\ndirect sales or if your manufacturer doesn't sell\ndirectly to the exporter or it has the broker, so one or\ntwo steps, is stream of commerce, and after that it's\nnot going to be. That's the same thing this Court did\nin A.G. Spaulding.\nIf someone wanted to fight about that\nstatutory application, they wouldn't be raising a\nconstitutional claim like we are here. What happened --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But in none of these cases\ndid they have those sorts of problems?\nMS. MILLETT: Not in these cases. My\nclients -- I think almost in all of the claims they\ndirectly exported it themselves. There was no dispute\nwhatsoever.\nIf there's a debate, factually or legally,\nabout whether this is the stream -- if it's not in the\nexport stream. If it's not in the export stream, it's\nnot an export or a violation. If there is a factual\ndebate, it wouldn't fall within the Enochs versus\nWilliams Packing exception. There was no factual\ndebate. There is a stipulated judgment in this case.\nWhat Enochs tells us, again, is that the\ngovernment can't have a tax be a tax solely for the\npurpose of curtailing constitutional recovery. That's\nthe only way that this was a legitimate tax in their\nview, not to collect revenue.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If 7422(a) had said\nany -- any Internal Revenue tax, including a tax imposed\nin alleged violation of the Export Clause, that would\ncut -- cut out the six-year statute of limitations,\nright? If it said the refund procedure applies to any\nInternal Revenue tax including one imposed in alleged\nviolation of the Export Clause?\nMS. MILLETT: I think it would clear up an\nawful lot. If I could just clarify, though. What this\ncourt held in Enochs versus William Packing is that the\nphrase \"any tax\" only applies if the government is at\nleast willing to assert a plausible defense for the tax.\nAnd so it would depend on whether any tax would still\ninclude that limitation in your scenario, if they are\nwilling to assert a plausible Export Clause.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Nothing different from\nwhat it is now, but just Congress makes clear that a tax\nand alleged violation of the Export Clause falls within\nthe term \"any Internal Revenue tax\"?\nMS. MILLETT: Then I think my position would\nbe that it does not, because this Court has held for\nhalf a century without Congress changing it that any tax\nmeans a tax that the government asserts is valid. It\ndoesn't have to be correct. It has to assert that it's\nvalid. Otherwise it's in the guise of a tax and it\ndoesn't fall --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not certain it was\nvalid if this coal was not shipped overseas. You're\nputting an awful burden on the government to know when\nthe coal is severed and shipped. You're saying if they\nmistake a shipment as being only for domestic use rather\nthan for shipment abroad, they don't have any basis\nwhatever for the tax claim. I'm not sure I agree with.\nMS. MILLETT: The problem in this case,\nJustice Scalia, is that there were two statutes. There\nwas a statute imposing the coal tax, 26 U.S.C. 4121 --\nthis is all on the first page of our brief -- and then\nthere was an amendment to the exemption for exports in\n26 U.S.C. 4221 that specifically said the general tax\nexemption for exports does not apply to this coal tax,\nand that provision captured nothing but exports of coal.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Your point is that you\ndon't have to go through the refund requirements of 7422\nif the government was -- although it did ask for the\nmoney as a tax, they are really out to lunch? I mean,\nthe trouble -- is there any authority for an argument\nlike that? I mean, the trouble I guess that I would\nhave that argument is, one is linguistic, because it\ngoes on to say \"or of any sum alleged to have been\nexcessive or in any manner wrongfully collected.\"\nAnd then the other thing is just common\nsense: Suppose you have an insane tax collector. You\nknow, I mean, that could happen. And the insane tax\ncollector they discover some years later has been\nassessing all these penalties for no reason and people\nhave been paying some of them because, terrible tragedy,\nterrible thing. But I guess they'd be stuck, I'd always\nthought, with the three-year statute of limitations, so\neven those it's really nuts.\nNow, is there -- is there any authority for\nus making a distinction between an insane -- to get an\nextreme, an insane assessment of a tax and just a\nwrongful assessment of a tax?\nMS. MILLETT: The authority is this Court's\nunanimous opinion in Enochs versus Williams --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMS. MILLETT: -- which said that if -- we\nare dealing with the same language -- no suit shall be\nmaintained for any tax in any court. And it said in\nthat, that statutory language, \"any tax\" means something\nthat the government can plausibly defend as a tax.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about the \"any sum,\"\n\"in any manner\"? You know, what about that language?\nMS. MILLETT: Again, the key language --\nJUSTICE BREYER: \"Any sum in any manner\nwrongfully collected.\"\nMS. MILLETT: Right. This Court dealt with\nthat, I think it's in -- I think in Dalm, and sometimes\nit has its own rules in the taxing, but this is -- the\nquestion is any tax, and any tax doesn't mean something\nthat's just in the guise of tax, whether the guy is\ninsane or Congress just forgot to read the Export\nClause. But as soon as we look, everyone knows this is\nunconstitutional, then understand what the impact of\nthat is. That means the only way this is a legitimate\ntax under the government's rule, the only legitimate tax\nfunction that this serves is to cut off constitutional\nremedies. That's its only role.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. No. Their argument\nis, I'm terribly sorry, that if the way you're hurt is\nyou paid a tax you shouldn't pay and you want to get a\nrefund, go through the administrative procedure.\nMS. MILLETT: This Court said in Enochs that\nyou don't -- that tax -- the whole point of the Tax\nExemption Act is to funnel everybody in for tax refund\nprocedure. And this court said you don't have to go if\nit is not a tax. And what they mean by not a tax, is\nthat it can't plausibly be defended by the government as\na tax. This doesn't happen often. This is an\nextraordinary exception. But this is the case where it\ndid. And if the government --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So why do you -- I\ntake it, though, that you concede the six-year statute\nof limitations under the Tucker Act, right? I mean,\nyour brief says this is an unbending and unqualified\nprohibition on the use of exports except up to -- if\nit's before six years and one day. You are taking an\nadamant position with respect to three years but you\ngive up six years.\nMS. MILLETT: No. It's unbending and wrong\nwhether it's within six years or ten years. But we\nagree that a constitutional right can have a statute of\nlimitation -- if there is a constitutional right that\ndoesn't have any statute of limitations, I don't know\nwhat it is and it's not this one. The question is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why aren't three years\nenough?\nMS. MILLETT: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why aren't three years\nenough?\nMS. MILLETT: Because it's a question of\nstatutory construction. And Congress determined what\nthe right statute of limitation is for a constitutional\nclaim, and that's six years. If Congress had a\nthree-year statute of limitations under the Tucker Act\nfor all constitutional claims, we wouldn't be here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so, the\nrhetoric in your brief how this is a constitutionally\nbased prohibition is not pertinent? You're saying if\nthe statute was clear and it said three years, that\nwould be fine, even though it's a claim under the Export\nClause?\nMS. MILLETT: We don't -- to the Export\nClause, right, distinguishes between three years and six\nyears in its own right. What the Export Clause does,\nthough, there is the statutory construction argument and\nwe have the Enochs argument, but we also think there are\nsubstantial constitutional concerns here. And the\nExport Clause makes it most imperative for this Court to\ncontinue to adhere to its definition of any tax, and\nthat's because --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why is the Export Clause\nso, so significant? The only other self-executing\nconstitutional clause that provides for damages\nautomatically that comes to mind is the Takings Clause.\nAnd we have allowed the states to require claimants to\njump through innumerable hoops. They have to exhaust\nall their administrative remedies before they can bring\na suit here. Why -- why is the Export Clause any -- any\nmore sacrosanct?\nMS. MILLETT: Because we don't -- under the\nConstitution the government hasn't done anything wrong\nunless -- until -- unless and until it actually effects\na taking and doesn't pay for it through process. Those\nprocesses are how we determine -- get to the point where\nthere has been an actual constitutional violation here.\nNo administrative process is necessary to\nhave -- to know that tax has been posed on exports. And\nwhat's distinct about the Export Clause, to get back to\nChief Justice Roberts' question, is that it is -- this\nCourt said unanimously in U.S. Shoe, a simple, direct,\nunqualified prohibition on congressional tax power in\nterms, and it disallows any effort to raise revenue\nthrough the Tax Power Act.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Volenti non fit injuria.\nIf indeed the taxpayer pays out the money for an\nunconstitutional export tax, it seems to me that person\nhas no claim until he complies with the administrative\nprocedures that render that tax unconstitutional. But\nup until the point where he is paying it voluntarily, it\nseems to me there is no constitutional violation.\nMS. MILLETT: Congress eliminated in the\nearly 1920s any prepayment protest requirement under the\ntax law. And the tax law -- the Internal Revenue Code\napplies sweepingly to Americans across this country,\nvast majority of whom are not equipped with tax lawyers\nat their side to make protests at the moment they pay\ntheir taxes. That's never been required.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not saying it has to be\nmade at the moment they pay their taxes. I'm just\nsaying until it's made there is no unconstitutional,\nunconstitutional export tax.\nMS. MILLETT: That's right. Until the tax\n-- well, it would be an unconstitutional statute on the\nbooks. No one has been injured by it or affected by it\nuntil somebody actually pays it or is required by the\ngovernment to pay it. I don't dispute that, but keep in\nmind we're dealing with a tax refund scheme. The tax\nrefund scheme is an extraordinary creature in the law\nfor many good reasons but that -- that reverses the\norder of everything. It makes you pay before any\nentitlement has been shown to that money by the\ngovernment.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought you didn't have\nto pay --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Here there was a payment.\nHere there was a payment.\nMS. MILLETT: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's different than if you\ntry to enjoin the collection at the outset.\nMS. MILLETT: It's only --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So that argument doesn't\nwork.\nMS. MILLETT: It's only different in the\nsense that government's interests are less, and the\ngovernment's interests are most acute in having people\npointed to the tax-refund scheme, this Court has said\ntime and again, before -- to pay first and fight later.\nAnd as a result -- I mean, if it's most acute --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what about the\ndeficiency procedure? And I don't know if that applies\nwith excise taxes, but suppose they didn't pay this tax\nand they get a notice of deficiency. Where would they\ngo?\nMS. MILLETT: There -- there's nowhere for\nthem to go for this particular tax. You can't go to tax\ncourt.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why not?\nMS. MILLETT: Because tax court doesn't\napply to excise taxes for the most part. There may be a\nfew exceptions. It essentially applies to income gift\nand estate taxes, and it certainly didn't apply to this\nprovision here. They could have -- they could have\ngotten the assessment and gotten on the phone with an\nIRS. Otherwise they'd have to wait for a lien or levy.\nNow, the government, by the way, has --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but if we -- if we\naccept your view in this case, they can go in a district\ncourt and enjoin them. It's not a tax. The Tax\nInjunction Act doesn't apply.\nMS. MILLETT: The -- the\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- which is just what\nJustice Ginsburg's questions point out. And earlier I\nhad indicated that in this case they did pay the tax.\nMS. MILLETT: I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So it seems to me there is\na distinction. It may be that you would prevail in your\nargument.\nMS. MILLETT: I know. We couldn't have --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If they tried -- if they\ntried -- do you think they could enjoin the collection\nof a tax refund?\nMS. MILLETT: No, they couldn't because in\naddition to showing the government's imposition of the\ntax is legally indefensible, you still have to show\nentitlement to an injunction, and unless you can\nestablish irreparable harm just by paying money, which\nI'm not aware of any coal company that could have, you\ncould have gotten an injunction. And --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But, I mean, in your\nargument you say it is absolutely -- that it doesn't\napply. Just get an injunction.\nMS. MILLETT: You can't get an injunction\njust because something is unlawful. That's never been\nallowed under equity. You also have to show irreparable\nharm.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then we'll invent\nthe hypothetical company that is going to go broke and\nall that stuff.\nMS. MILLETT: But I mean, it's not a\nquestion of inventing. This Court dealt with exactly\nthat question in Enochs, where -- Enochs versus Williams\nPacking, and later again in South Carolina versus Regan,\nand Commissioner versus Shapiro -- that you can't just\ncome in and say it's unlawful, that you actually have to\nthen establish irreparable harm. Everything in the tax\nscheme points to taxpayers with enormous penalties and\nenormous risks to pay first, fight later. And when a\ntaxpayer does that, it's also --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you can't have it both\nways. You're saying it isn't a tax for your purposes,\nand then in my hypothetical case you say you have to go\nthrough the tax law.\nMS. MILLETT: It's the government that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And the same with your\nanswer, what I thought was your answer to Justice\nGinsburg's question.\nMS. MILLETT: It's the government that wants\nto have it both ways. It wants to say it is a tax just\nfor purposes of making it a nonconstitutional case under\nthe Tucker Act and to make it the tax scheme, but in no\nway is this defensible as a tax.\nJUSTICE BREYER: In looking at your\nargument, I see it now, I think, if I'm right. You're\n-- that it would have very broad reach. It would reach\n-- it doesn't just concern the constitutional claim; it\nconcerns any claim you'd have against the IRS. And\nthere's authority that says if the IRS' position is too\nfar out, you can go get an injunction. That's what\nyou're pointing to. And then you're argument is,\nbecause of that authority, that kind of an exception for\nthe far out IRS claim also applies to the statute of\nlimitation and administrative requirement. And your\nproblem is the latter has never been held. And the\nreason that that's a problem, I take it, is because when\nyou're talking about injunctions, you're talking about\nbasic equity, but when you're talking about later on\nadministrative requirements, there's really no reason\nthey couldn't have filed the claim. And if we were to\naccept an argument on the -- to the contrary and\nanalogize it, it's going to cut through rules,\nregulations, statutes, constitutional claims,\neverything, really making a hash of their provision\nthere -- of the administrative provision. So, what is\nyour response to that thought which --\nMS. MILLETT: I have two responses: One,\nit's going to have far less effect on this situation, in\nthe post-payment situation, than it did in Enochs, where\nit wasn't limited to the Export Clause. This situation\nis only going to work where you not only establish the\ngovernment has no basis for this tax, a hard thing to\ndo, but that you have a money-mandating constitutional\nprovision. There aren't many of them. If you don't\nhave a money-mandating position, you've got nowhere else\nto go but the tax scheme.\nSo it's extremely limited, but I want to get\nback -- this is not about an equity rule. This Court\nwas specific in Enochs versus Williams Packing, when it\nsaid, our prior decision under Miller versus Standard\nNut, in which you had done a more generous view of this\nget around the Tax Injunction Act, was wrong, because\nthe Tax Injunction Act is not an equitable rule. Enochs\nwas a statutory construction rule. Pages 6, 7, and 8 of\nthat decision make it plain in terms -- you talk about\nwhat the act requires, and the language of this Court is\nconstruing is the phrase \"any tax.\" And if it has no\nlegitimate basis, then it's in the guise of a tax.\nThat same language has been on the books for\nalmost half a century. Congress went back from the Tax\nInjunction Act eight times without changing it in\nresponse to this Court's decisions. Enochs has been\nreaffirmed by this Court five times. Congress enacted\nan entirely new Internal Revenue Code in 1986 that used\nthat \"any tax\" language in 7422, with this Court's five\ndecisions on the book and kept that language. And it\nmakes sense. Congress doesn't -- doesn't enact a tax\nwhere it's only tax function --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What do you want to do\nabout your argument, as I hear it, has nothing to do\nwith the nature of the claim that you're asserting to\nget the money back. It has to do with the nature of the\nIRS's defense and -- well, can you do it that way? Can\nyou say the word \"any tax\" or \"any claim\" -- I can't\nremember that other. What was it? It was any -- \"any\nsum\" -- \"any sum\" or \"any tax.\" Can you say, well, it\nmeans one thing if they are saying that the reason they\nwant it back is that it violates the Constitution, and\nthose words mean a different thing if the reason that\nyou want it back is it violates an IRS reg; it violates\nan IRS statute.\nMS. MILLETT: I'm not saying that \"any tax\"\nmeans anything different. I'm just pointing out that if\nyou succeed --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, if it doesn't mean\nanything different and then if the very far-out claim to\na tax is so far out it isn't a tax, that would be true\nin the regulation context, in the statutory context as\nwell as the constitutional context. Am I missing\nsomething?\nMS. MILLETT: No, because you have to have a\nmoney-mandating claim under the Constitution to fall\nwithin the Tucker Act. The -- this Court said, the\nTucker Act for purposes of the statutory claims under\nthe Internal Revenue Code, as this court said in\nKreider, takes three years to the statute of\nlimitations. So I don't think, after Kreider, that you\nwould still have a six-year statute of limitations under\nthe Tucker Act for a statutory tax claim.\nThe difference is constitutional\nenforcement, and this is fundamentally a constitutional\nright that's being enforced. And the question is, would\nCongress had thought -- this is all a question of\nstatutory construction -- would Congress have thought\nthis is more a constitutional claim or a tax claim? And\nthey've made the sensible decision, at least as this\nCourt construed it in Enochs, in South Carolina versus\nRegan -- addressed it in Janis and Bob Jones University\nand the Americans United case, all of which are in our\nbrief --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you're saying it's\nboth. You're not saying it's \"either/or\" because for\nthree years you did use the refund procedure. So you\nused the refund procedure for the years that were within\nthe three-year period, and then for the years that were\noutside the three-year period, you have this other\ntheory. So you're not saying this is not for refund.\nThat route is closed. The only route is this\nconstitutional -- this claim directly under the Export\nClause. But your own conduct seems to have been it's\nour option. We can treat it as a refund claim or we can\ntreat it as a constitutional claim.\nMS. MILLETT: One can get -- there is\nnothing in the tax administrative scheme where one when\nshows up to file a tax refund where you say if I go by\nthis route, I'm waiving all others. It's not like I'm\nagreeing to go go through arbitration and forgoing my\nrights to go through a court procedure. Congress has --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In other words, what were\nyou just telling us is that this is not a refund claim;\nthis is a constitutional claim. But you are now saying,\nI think, that it's both; it's whatever the taxpayer or\nthe plaintiff wants it to be.\nMS. MILLETT: It's a constitutional claim to\nget your tax money back. That's right. And the\nadministrative scheme is fully amenable to that. That's\ncertainly the government's position, and we don't\ndisagree. The question is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Plus you get\ninterest.\nMS. MILLETT: Yes. Absolutely. We could\nget it on both grounds, but you get --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You're saying you get\ninterest too in either way. You're saying -- I thought\nyou said for the three years that are within the\nthree-year refund limit, you get interest and then\nyou're also saying, going back six years, you also get\ninterest. You're not saying that if you -- if you're\noutside the refund procedure you don't get interest.\nMS. MILLETT: Right. But that's because\nwe're -- I mean, there's a -- there's a separate\ninterest provision in the tax code for the\nadministrative refund procedure. They don't really an\n28 U.S.C. 2411. I think it's 26 U.S.C. 6511. But\nthere's a specific administrative brief on tax -- I'm\nsorry, interest provision for the administrative refund\nscheme. And so, under that, when you're in the\nadministrative scheme, you get what the administrative\nscheme's interest provision gives you. We don't dispute\nthat.\nAnd then the question is, once you've gone\nto court, the relevant interest provision is the one in\n28 U.S.C., not in the tax code, by the way, but in 28\nU.S.C., providing them -- providing for interest when\nyou've recovered an overpayment of taxes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the interest the same\nin amount in either case?\nMS. MILLETT: Yes, because in 2411 it\ncross-references the -- well, let me clarify. There is\none potential wrinkle, but generally speaking 2411 if\nyou look at it, and it's at the end of the\ncross-references --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: 2411 -- 2411 is what you\nuse in the court when you have a straight tax refund\nclaim. It's not as though 2411 is there for some other\nclaim. It's what you get when you go to court and\nyou're suing for a refund. That's 2411. That's\napplicable if you get a judgment for an overpayment in\nrespect of any Internal Revenue tax. That's what --\nit's in Title 28, but that's what it's for. It's for an\noverpayment in respect of any Internal Revenue tax.\nMS. MILLETT: This is all on page 4a of the\nGovernment's brief if you want to see where it\ncross-references the Internal Revenue interest\nprovisions.\nNo, there's nothing there that says you have\nto have gone through the administrative scheme. All you\nhave to have is an overpayment. If you have an\noverpayment, under Bonwit Teller --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- the use of any\nInternal Revenue tax, and your whole argument is this\nisn't an Internal Revenue tax. So it's clearly not an\nInternal Revenue tax that you have a constitutional\nclaim directly under the Constitution, so how does it\nbecome for purposes of 2411 an Internal Revenue tax?\nMS. MILLETT: I'm sorry, I misunderstood\nyour question, Justice Ginsburg. But I want to make\nclear that you don't have to go through the refund\nscheme to get this. This interest would apply in Bonwit\nTeller for accounts stated, in the Rosenman case for\ndeposit on taxes. That's how we read it.\nYour second point, yes, that if we say this\nis not a plausible tax under Enochs versus Williams,\nthat I think, and if this Court agrees, that this is not\na tax under Enochs versus Williams, so that we're not\nbound by 7422, then I agree that our interest argument\nbecomes harder at that point textually.\nI will tell you that I still think the fact\nthat they say \"in respect of any Internal Revenue tax\"\ngives us room to say that where the government has at\nleast treated it and collected the money as though it\nwere an Internal Revenue tax, that might be a way to get\ninterest. If this Court agrees, though, that it's\nnot --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you don't agree in\nyour basic claim that if the government is treating it\nas an Internal Revenue tax, which it certainly didn't,\nyou'd say that works only for the interest, not --\nMS. MILLETT: Only -- I'm sorry. Only\nbecause we have the \"in respect of language.\" That's\nthe only -- but if this Court disagrees with that, and\nwe recognize it's harder if this Court agreed, we have a\nseparate constitutional argument that the Export Clause,\njust like the Just Compensation Clause requires interest\npaid in its own right. And so that's the alternative\nbasis.\nAnd this Court, of course, can affirm the\njudgment on any basis supported by the record.\nBut I want to get back. Very clearly that\nthere is, the bottom -- I mean, Justice Scalia, you\ntalked about, you know, which pot you want to put this\nin. The rarity of this case and what's unique about it\nis that the government came in agreeing up front,\nstipulated judgment, no fact dispute, no law disputes,\nthis is in the pot of no legitimate status of the tax.\nNo claim whatsoever. The government couldn't think of\nanything.\nBut for purposes of limiting your\nconstitutional relief, then it's in the pot of a\nlegitimate. Tax and we think they can't have it both,\nways and particularly as a matter of statutory\nconstruction. This is ultimately a question of which\nscheme is better fitted to vindicating the Constitution.\nAnd Congress said any tax, just like it said in the Tax\nInjunction Act. This court has said what any tax means.\nIt said it five times after Enochs. And Congress has\nnot reacted to it.\nStare decisis applies most powerfully in the\nstatutory construction Congress -- context, and if\nCongress thought there were a problem with what -- with\nhow this Court defined any tax, it would have said so.\nIt could have done so. It's had half a century to do\nsomething.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You give all of this\nup when it comes to the statute of limitations. I mean,\nthe government's argument could be just as implausible\nas you suggested it is here. But if it involves a claim\nsix years and one day out, it's just too bad. It\ndoesn't matter that it's a constitutional claim. It\ndoesn't matter how erroneous the government's position\nwas, because the government can impose limitations like\nthat even on the assertion of constitutional claims.\nThat's all they are doing here.\nMS. MILLETT: But the Tucker Act doesn't use\nthe \"word any tax\" in defining the statute of\nlimitations. It's a statute of limitations for\nconstitutional claims.\nOur argument is what the word \"any tax\"\nmeans in 7422 and does it force us to go through the tax\nrefund scheme. Our argument is, as this Court said\nunanimously in Enochs -- the decision has never been\nquestioned by any justice of this court -- that any tax\ndoes not apply if it had no tax status for any other\npurpose. It can't be just to limit --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We say just as\nunanimously a couple of things last year on -- term as\nwell in Jencks and certainly the Federal circuit's\ndecision wouldn't have come out the same if they had had\nHinck's term of trust on the books.\nMS. MILLETT: I'm not sure -- I'm not sure\nit would have come out differently. Maybe they would\nhave explained things differently. But this Court said\nin most cases the question is which statutory scheme is\nbetter fitted. And at two levels we think the Tucker\nAct is better fitted for this claim.\nOne, because any tax only applies when there\nis asserted legitimate basis for the tax; and two, the\nExport Clause is a unique limitation, specifically\ndenies the government any authority to use exports as a\nsource of revenue. And you have a refund scheme here\nthat has been designed over the years specifically to\nprotect revenue interest, to make you pay the revenue\nfirst and have them hold it.\nIt's not just holding them for six months.\nThey had to pay every two weeks. But, of course, the\ngovernment didn't treat that as paid for purposes of\ninterest until the end of the quarter when a return was\nfiled. That's one way why the interest calculation\nmight be different under the Tucker Act than it would be\nunder the refund scheme, just the timing of whether it's\nthe deposit or the actual return.\nJustice Kennedy, I forgot to get back to you\non that.\nBut the question here is whether the Export\nClause can be fully enforced by -- which it's -- it's\nnot a suggestion and it doesn't say when you're doing\nyour tax stuff, it's okay if you slop on on exports a\nlittle bit. Exports are completely off limits to the\ntax power. And Congress using its tax power to create a\ntax scheme that specifically preserves and protects\nrevenue and is not a revenue neutral system is not the\nbest scheme for vindicating the Export Clause. It's not\nbetter for that. It is at cross purposes with the\nExport Clause.\nBut the bottom is this Court doesn't need to\nget to that constitutional question. We think it\ncertainly informs the analysis. It certainly is enough\nof a constitutional concern or doubt to conclude that\nEnochs still applies any tax in the tax injunction --\nany tax in any court. No suit shall be maintained for\nany tax in any court means the same thing in 7422 that\nit means in the Tax Injunction Act. If Congress thought\nit meant something different, it has had half -- almost\nhalf a century to tell us.\nIt hasn't done that, and the Export Clause\ncan't serve its unique historical function of keeping\ngovernment's tax regulatory hands off -- hands off the\ntax export process and the revenue out of the Federal\nFiske unless this is treated as a constitutional claim.\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMs. Millett. Mr. Jay, you have 15 minutes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Jay, I hope in the 15\nminutes, you will state what the government's position\nis on this Enochs case that's been mentioned at least a\ndozen times.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. JAY: I'll be glad to, Your Honor.\nEnochs case construed not Section 7422, but Section\n7421, the Injunction Act provision of the tax code. And\nthe question in Enochs was whether the taxpayer simply\nby alleging that the tax was so -- so invalidly applied\nthat it was only in the guise of the tax could avoid\npaying the tax and bring an injunctive claim.\nThe court in Enochs held that it could not\nbecause the taxpayer had not, in fact, satisfied the\nbasic requirement of all claims for injunctive relief as\nirreparable injury. And the court also held that\nwhether a tax is defensible for purposes of this very\nnarrow exception is to be determined on the basis of the\ninformation to the government at the time of suit. So\nin this --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wait what very narrow\nexception? It didn't apply the exception.\nMR. JAY: As the Court was preserving, I\nthink, in Dick, though, because -- because the Court\nultimately denied the exception in that case and in each\ncase since, preserving the holding in Standard Nut and\nMargarine, a case from the 1920's. Justice Breyer\nalluded to this when he asked my friend, Ms. Millett,\nabout whether this exception is geared primarily to\nfactual issues or to legal issues. In Standard Nut and\nMargarine the government had decided to attempt to\nimpose a tax meant for oleomargarine on a product made\nentirely from nuts. And this Court, you know, without\nconstruing the tax-injunctive provision, simply\nreferring to principles of equity, this Court held that\nthe government's theory of assessing the tax was simply\nin the guise of a tax and it permitted the injunctive\nclaim to proceed.\nIn Williams Packing the government's -- the\ngovernment had a collateral basis for assessing the tax,\nand so the taxpayer was remitted to the same remedy that\nany taxpayer who wants to challenge a tax as having been\nunlawfully assessed or collected is subject to; that is,\nto pay the tax, file a refund claim, and if the refund\nclaim is upheld either by the IRS or subsequently in\ncourt, to receive a full refund with interest.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Don't the two go together?\nIf you could bring an injunction action, surely you\ndon't have to pay the tax.\nMR. JAY: Well, if you can satisfy the\nrequirements for injunctive relief -- and Williams\nPacking, the taxpayer, couldn't; and in the cases since\nthe taxpayer couldn't -- then the court can enjoin the\ncollection of the taxes applied to you.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's what she is\nsaying. She is saying that those conditions exist here.\nThat this is not -- not a plausible tax; and, therefore,\nshe could have gotten an injunction; and, therefore, by\na parity of reasoning, she doesn't have to go through\nthe tax provisions.\nMR. JAY: I think I have three responses to\nthat.\nOne is that we don't think that a -- an\nexception to the -- to 7421 should carry over into\nSection 7422. But even in the circumstances of this\ncase, this is a facially constitutional tax. The tax is\nimposed on coal mined in the United States. And if no\n-- if none of the coal that is subject to the tax is\never in the stream of export when the tax is imposed,\nthen the tax is perfectly constitutional. And that is\nwhy Section 4121 remains on the books today.\nThe tax is unconstitutional only in certain\nnarrow circumstances when the coal actually is is in the\nstream of export. As I explained --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you could say the\nsame about the tax on oleomargarine. It is a perfectly\nvalid tax but not when you impose it on nuts. And here\nthe tax on coal is a perfectly valid tax, but not when\nyou impose it on coal that's in the stream of export.\nMR. JAY: But if one of these coal companies\nhad sought to enjoin the tax, the government would have\npointed to the provision in Williams Packing that says\nthat whether the tax is defensible is to be determined\non the basis of the information available to the\ngovernment at the time of suit until the taxpayer\ndemonstrates that the coal is actually in the stream of\nexport, which is precisely what's done during the refund\nprocess that the taxpayers used in this case to show\nthat their coal was in the stream of export when they\nobtained the refund. That's what -- that's how they\nobtained a full -- full relief.\nBut, in any event, the history of this\nlitigation shows that this is not -- this is not a claim\nabout the facial unconstitutionality of the tax because\nthe tax continued to be collected without protest in the\ncase of the Respondents here for 21 consecutive years.\nAnd by the time they filed for a refund this\nCourt had decided IBM. It had decided U.S. shoe. The\ndistrict court had decided Ranger Fuel, and the\ngovernment had announced that it would not appeal the\ndecision in Ranger Fuel striking down the coal tax.\nBut that doesn't mean that for that -- for\nthat entire time the government had no basis on which to\ndefend the tax. I mean the government had colorful\narguments to defend the tax at issue in U.S. Shoe in\nJune 1996. Shoe was in 1996. And it had colorful\narguments to defend the harbor maintenance tax in U.S.\nShoe. I may have misspoke. IBM in 1996, and U.S. Shoe\nin 1998.\nSo to say that during the period at issue in\nthis case, 1994 through 1996, the tax was so facially\ninvalid that the narrow Williams Packing exception to\nanother statutory provision justifies Respondents'\nattempt to circumvent the tax refund statute, we just\nthink is not correct.\nIn the case of a taxpayer who -- who can\nsatisfy the exception, you know, the Tax Code does,\nindeed, put that taxpayer to the choice. It gives them\na fully effective post- payment refund remedy where they\ncan avoid any penalties and interest by paying the tax\nand litigating for a full refund.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right. Is the government's\nview that the money that they are seeking here, if you\nlook at 7422, that it falls within the language of any\nInternal Revenue tax alleged to be erroneously or\nillegally assessed or the language \"any sum alleged to\nhave been in any manner wrongfully collected,\" or both?\nMR. JAY: I don't think that we need to go\nbeyond the first clause, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So when I decide this case,\nI should forget the words \"any sum\"?\nMR. JAY: I mean the Court construed a\nsimilar provision in Flora versus United States in 1960,\nwhich explained that \"any sum\" is a cumulative\nprovision. So that if something is within the scope of\nan Internal Revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously\nor illegally collected or assessed, that's as far as you\nneed to go.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But it means that if, in\nfact, it is not within the scope of the word \"tax,\" then\nit is not within \"any sum\"?\nMR. JAY: No. To the contrary, Your Honor.\nI think that the holding in Flora is that if it's not\nwithin the scope of the first provision, then you would\nneed to look at the second -- actually the third\nprovision, the \"any sum\" language.\nJUSTICE BREYER: In Enochs -- she is quite\nright, your opposing lawyer -- it says the exaction is\nmerely in the guise of a tax. And when it says it is\nwithin the guise of a tax, then it doesn't fall within\nthe Tax Injunction Act.\nAnd there it says if it is clear that under\nno circumstances could the government ultimately\nprevail, the central purpose of the Tax Injunction Act\nis inapplicable. And then it's just in the guise of a\ntax. And that, she says, is the test we should apply\nhere. So that's where I think Justice Ginsburg began.\nWhat is your specific response to that?\nMR. JAY: Well, my specific response, Your\nHonor, first is that in this case the tax simply was not\nin the guise of a tax. But even if, you know, today, if\nthe taxpayer were -- if a taxpayer were alleging that\nthe coal tax were in the guise of a tax and that it,\ntherefore, could bring a prepayment -- a prepayment\naction, it does not then follow that the taxpayer could\nstill after the fact, if it opted not to bring that\nprepayment action, the taxpayer could then escape the\nthree-year, nontollable, unusually emphatic limitation\nperiod that applies to a claim for a postpayment remedy,\nwhich is the exclusive means of obtaining a postpayment\nremedy.\nAnd, you know, the courts recognized time\nand again that taxing authorities have a strong interest\nin fiscal stability, and it effectively closes the books\non a particular tax year. So that taxpayers, after the\ntax is paid, if they want to protest the tax, they have\nthree years in which to put the government on notice.\nThat, you know, even if the claim is this tax is so\nbeyond the pale that it can't be defended, they have to\nput the government on notice of that claim.\nAnd if they do, then the IRS considers it;\nand if the IRS turns them down, then they can proceed to\ndistrict court or to the Court of Federal Claims.\nIn addition, I think I just wanted to\nclarify one point about the availability of prepayment\nremedies in this case. I think, Justice Ginsburg, my\nfriend, Miss Millett, was correct about the fact that\nthis excise tax does not -- is not susceptible to the\ndeficiency proceeding in tax court.\nAnd we have cited in footnote 7 of our reply\nbrief at page 16 the possibility that there may be\nanother route if the taxpayer feels strongly about the\nunconstitutionality of the tax and is willing to take\nthe chance that if the taxpayer's position is rejected,\nthat the taxpayer may be liable for penalties and\ninterest for not paying the tax.\nI mean, of course, the general rule is that\nthe taxpayer is expected to pay the tax and proceed\npostpayment by putting the IRS on notice of the claim.\nBut Congress, in Section 6330(c)(2)(B) of Title 26, has\nprovided some limited ability, if a taxpayer has not\npreviously been able to litigate the merits of the tax,\nthe taxpayer has a limited opportunity to do so first\nbefore the IRS, then in Tax Court, and then before the\nCourt of Appeals.\nAnd, again, on Miss Millett's supposition\nthat this is a completely, clearly unconstitutional tax,\nthen the taxpayer would have the option of doing that.\nAgain, the refund scheme is set up so that if the\ntaxpayer doesn't want to take the chance that its\nargument will not be accepted, the taxpayer has a\nsimple, open remedy: To file a refund claim at any\npoint within three years.\nThat's exactly what Respondents did not do\nfor the 21 consecutive years that they paid this tax\nwithout complaint.\nIf the Court has no further questions?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
