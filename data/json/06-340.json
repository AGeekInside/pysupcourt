        "content": "(10:18 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst today in 06-340, National Association of Home\nBuilders versus Defenders of Wildlife, and 06-549,\nEnvironmental Protection Agency versus Defenders of\nWildlife.\nMr. Kneedler.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nSection 402(b) of the Clean Water Act\nprovides that the Environmental Protection Agency shall\napprove an application by a State to administer its own\nNPDES program unless EPA finds that the state's program\ndoes not satisfy nine criteria that are addressed to\nwhether the State has the legal authority under State\nlaw to carry forward with the program.\nThere's no dispute in this case that\nArizona's program satisfies those criteria. The Ninth\nCircuit nonetheless set aside EPA's approval of\nArizona's program. The Ninth Circuit held that EPA\ncould not approve Arizona's application unless it first\ninsured that there would be in place under Arizona's\nadministration protections equivalent to those that\nwould be applicable under Section 7 of the Endangered\nSpecies Act when EPA itself issues permits. That\nholding is inconsistent not only with Section 402(b)'s\nmandatory directive, it's also inconsistent with Section\n7 of the ESA itself.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do we take the case and --\nI'll ask the same question to your colleagues from the\nother side -- on the assumption that if the nine -- the\nfactors in the statutes are met, that EPA has no\ndiscretion to withhold the transfer?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. That is our position,\nand that I think is clear from Section 402(b). It says\nthat the administrator shall approve unless he finds\nthat the state legal authority criteria are not\nsatisfied. I should also point out that that's\nreinforced by 33 U.S.C. 1251(b), which expresses a\nstrong preference for State protection of waters and in\nparticular states that it's the policy of Congress that\nthe states administer the NPDES program.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: How long has that been the\ngovernment's -- the EPA position? How long has that\nbeen the EPA's interpretation of the statute?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, until 1993 when the\nvast majority -- by the time -- by that time the vast\nmajority of transfers or approvals had already taken\nplace. There had never been consultation, at least that\nwe're aware of under Section 7 of the Endangered Species\nAct. EPA did consult with the wildlife agencies on six\nprograms but after the Fifth Circuit -- from then until\n-- until this one, but after the Fifth Circuit's\ndecision in the American Forestry case, EPA never tried\nto impose any obligations on a State under Section 7 of\nthe Endangered Species Act.\nWhat it did is, EPA and the Fish and\nWildlife Service worked out between themselves certain\narrangements by which EPA would look at endangered\nspecies considerations, but it never conditioned the\napproval of a State program after the Louisiana program\nstruck down in the American Forestry decision in 1998,\non the states having in place certain protections. And\nin fact, I think EPA would not characterize what it did\neven in the Louisiana programs as the sort of condition\nthat the Fifth Circuit understood.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Has that always been the\nEPA's position? Because there's an allegation in one of\nthe briefs that you changed your position in this Court,\nto change the position you took even in the lower courts\nat issue. Is that --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I'm -- there may be two\ndifferent things that, referring to it. Section 7\nimposes an obligation on Federal agencies in their own\nactions not to jeopardize -- or to ensure that their\nactions are not likely to jeopardize a species.\nAncillary to that, there is an obligation on Federal\nagencies to consult with the fish and wildlife agencies.\nAs to the consultation obligation, as I mentioned, EPA\nhas engaged in consultation from 1993 until --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But your position was they\ndidn't have to?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Our position now is that it\ndid not have to, but -- and more fundamentally our\nposition is that because the transfer or the approval of\nthe State application is mandatory if these nine legal\nauthority criteria are satisfied, EPA could not withhold\napproval of --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your position is\nthe consultation is a waste of time?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Basically, yes. If in the\nend EPA could not disapprove the State's application,\nand since consultation is ancillary to the substantive\nobligation not to jeopardize --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't there a difference\nbetween denying the application because the Endangered\nSpecies Act hasn't been attended to adequately, and\nsaying you meet the nine criteria, you're going to get\nyour application. But then, so it's not just automatic\nthat the thing becomes the State's domain rather than\nthe Federal. But isn't there something rather detailed\ncalled a memorandum of agreement that's worked out, and\ncouldn't the Endangered Species Act concerns be\naccommodated that way instead of saying one statute is\nout the window, even though EPA in a number of states\nhas made an accommodation.\nWhy couldn't the Endangered Species Act\nconcerns be reflected in that memorandum of agreement?\nMR. KNEEDLER: The memorandum, the\nmemorandum of agreement, is called for under EPA's\nregulations as really a procedural mechanism for the EPA\nand the State agency to work out the practicalities of\nthe State's administering the program. They typically\naddress such things as how the State agency will furnish\nEPA draft permits and that sort of thing, time\nlimitations for EPA to look at, who to contact at the\nState agency.\nIt's essentially procedural in order to\nfacilitate EPA's continuing oversight role. It's not a\nvehicle for EPA to impose substantive obligations coming\nfrom other statutes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the point is why\ncan't it be?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Because we think that would\nbeen consistent with Section 402(b), which requires,\nwhich requires the EPA to approve the transfer.\nNow, if a State agency chooses to cooperate\nwith Fish and Wildlife Service or NOAA in the Department\nof Commerce with respect to species under its\njurisdiction, that is all fine. And I should point\nout --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Doesn't the ESA require\nsomething more than voluntary cooperation? I mean, you\nquite rightly emphasize the mandatory nature of the\napproval under the Clean Water Act. But the Endangered\nSpecies Act mandate seems equally unconditional.\nMR. KNEEDLER: It's unconditional with\nrespect in our view to actions that are within the\nagency's discretion or consequences that the agency will\ncause. But more fundamentally in response to your\nquestion, Section 7 imposes obligations only on Federal\nagencies, not on State agencies. Like 402(b), it is a\nfederalism-sensitive --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I realize that that's your\npoint. But doesn't that sort of beg the question?\nBecause it's not that anyone is suggesting here, I\nthink, that under the Endangered Species Act the Federal\nGovernment can keep control or that the Federal\nGovernment can in effect provide guarantees of what may\nhappen in response to some future development proposal.\nWhat I think they're arguing is that when,\nwhen, when the agency gives the approval, it should\nrequire that there be some kind of procedure in place on\nthe part of the State so that when problems arise the\nStates will probably respond to them with the same\nvalues in mind that the feds would.\nAnd the question is why cannot the\nEndangered Species Act be enforced in that way, to\nrequire, in effect, an advanced mechanism before, in\neffect, the whole business is turned over to the States?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, as to the latter, we\ndon't believe that EPA can condition the transfer. But\nlet me point out that in 2001 --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I know you say you don't\nthink they can do it. But the problem is we've got two\nstatutes each of which is mandatory. And your response\nseems to be, well, we'll give full effect to one and we\nwill ignore the other. And I don't see how that is a\ntie breaker. And why do you not have an obligation to\ndo what you can with respect to the Endangered Species\nAct?\nMR. KNEEDLER: First of all, with respect to\nthe Endangered Species Act, the memorandum of agreement\nthat was entered into in 2001 between EPA and the two\nFederal wildlife services does furnish a way in which\nafter the transfer EPA can take into account endangered\nspecies considerations within the scope of its --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: At which point EPA doesn't\nhave any authority left under the Clean Water Act.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, that's not correct.\nUnder Section 402(d) EPA has the authority to object to\na State permit. And if the -- but to do so on, based on\na determination that the State permit would not satisfy\nthe guidelines and requirements of the Clean Water Act.\nSo if --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That begs the question\nbecause the concern is the enforcement of the Endangered\nSpecies Act.\nMR. KNEEDLER: With respect to water quality\nissues that might affect an endangered species, EPA\ntakes the position -- and I think it's correct -- that\nEPA can object to a State permit where that permit would\nnot comply with State water quality standards that are\nnecessary to protect the endangered species.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why don't they get that in\nthe memorandum of agreement up front?\nMR. KNEEDLER: EPA doesn't need the State's\nagreement to object to a State permit. That is\nauthority --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe it doesn't, but isn't\nit the case that if it's in the agreement up front the\nodds are better that the State will address it, as\nopposed to the State ignoring the problem, requiring EPA\nthen to take affirmative action to object?\nMR. KNEEDLER: And I wanted to get to the\nfurther mechanisms that are in place under EPA\nregulations and the memorandum of agreement.\nJUSTICE SOUR TER: No, but would you answer\nmy question first? Isn't it likely that the States are\ngoing to respond or deal with the problem if they have\nan obligation in the memorandum of agreement right up\nfront?\nI suppose. But let me, let me, let me\nexplain what is in place. EPA's regulations require\nthat a State furnish its draft permits to the public,\nbut also specifically to the Federal wildlife agencies.\nThat gives Fish and Wildlife Service an\nopportunity to comment about endangered species concerns\nthat may be raised by the draft permit.\nThe regulations also require the State\nagency to take into account the comments that are\nsubmitted by anyone, including the Fish and Wildlife\nService and NOAA. Those provisions built in allow the\nFederal agencies to bring their concerns to the State\nagency, and I think there is every reason to believe\nthat the State agencies will --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is there an obligation on\nthe part of the State agency to take reasonable action\nin response to them, or can the State agency simply sit\nthere, listen with a tin ear and then do whatever it\nwants to?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Those regulations do not\nbecause they are procedural. Then what happens if the\nState agency does not respond to the concerns raised or\ndoes not remedy the concerns raised by Fish and Wildlife\nService or NOAA, EPA is notified and EPA can then try to\nwork it out with the State agency, or, failing that, EPA\ncan object to the State permit if it does not satisfy\nthe Clean Water Act standards.\nAnd again with respect to water quality,\nthose standards are set at a level that is necessary to\nprotect endangered species. So as far as water quality\nimpacts are concerned, EPA retains complete control\nunder its ability to object to the permit.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You are in effect saying\nthat the, that the, that the enforcement of water\nquality standards is, in effect, the indirect answer to\nthe problem that the other side raises? That's the way\nit's done?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It is. EPA --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Except to the extent that a\nproject may be endangering a species, not by reason of\nchange in water quality but, for example, by destroying\nhabitat, constructing a dam or that sort of thing.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Upland habitat, if it's water\nhabitat, water quality standards. EPA has to approve\nState water quality standards. It consults with Fish\nand Wildlife Service and NOAA in doing so to make sure\nendangered species would be protected by the water\nquality standards. And then each individual State\npermit is measured against those water quality standards\nto make sure they comply.\nSo therefore, with respect to water quality,\nFish and Wildlife Service agreed that the mechanisms I\nhave just described would take care of any Endangered\nSpecies Act concerns.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you referring to, in\nwhat you just described about the cooperation among the\nFederal agencies, to what has been called in their\nbrief, it's referred to as a coordination agreement?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, the 2001, February 22,\n2001, agreement between EPA and --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And that agreement, I\ntake it from what you just said, is in full force? EPA\nhasn't retreated from that agreement and it will\ncontinue to --\nMR. KNEEDLER: That is correct. And some of\nthe things I described were embodied in EPA regulations\naside from the agreement, including an agreement that\nState agencies furnish draft permits to Fish and\nWildlife Service and take into account comments that are\nreceived in return.\nJustice Scalia is correct that, that the\nimpacts that would not be covered by this would be\nnon-water quality-related impacts on upland habitat.\nBut in our view that simply reflects the nature of the\nClean Water Act and under 402(b) it is a Clean Water\nAct. It deals with water quality, and we do not believe\nthat EPA is authorized to withhold the approval or\ncondition the approval of a transfer of permitting\nauthority to a State on the basis of what the State will\ndo with respect to upland, upland habitat.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Which is the -- the later\nact is the Endangered Species Act?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Essentially, the Endangered\nSpecies -- there was a subsequent amendment to 402(b),\nbut for these purposes -- but --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why doesn't that control?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Because it is -- we do not\nthink it repeals -- it's essentially a repeal by\nimplication question.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you can just as\nwell say that if it does not control then there is an\nexception by implication, the exception being based on\nthe prior act. Neither of them is particularly\nsatisfactory, but neither answer gives you a reason to\nignore the problem.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Beyond that, Section 7 of the\nESA is a generally applicable statute, whereas Section\n402(b) speaks specifically and comprehensively to the\nquestion of Federal approval of State programs. We also\nthink this would be a particularly unlikely candidate\nfor an exception to that because EPA's approval of the\nState program does not result in any immediate\non-the-ground consequences. That would only happen --\nor in-the-water consequences. That would only happen if\nafter the transfer the State agency actually issued,\nissued a permit. So what we're talking about is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but by that very\nreasoning you could say that if assurance are required\nthat the Endangered Species Act is going to be honored,\nthat does not in and of itself prevent any development\nprogram. Each, in effect, is a kind of mechanism for\ndealing with something that may happen in the future.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, if I could go back to\nthe point I was making earlier, that we think that the\ncentral thrust of the court of appeals' opinion and\nRespondent's position here is that EPA could not\ntransfer the authority unless it and the State together\nreplicated the sort of protections that were in place\nwhen EPA itself administered the Endangered Species Act.\nAnd as I said, that's inconsistent not only with 402(b),\nbut with Congress's federalism-sensitive judgment, to\nimpose the sort of substantive and procedural\nadministrative requirements in Section 7 of the ESA only\non Federal agencies, not on State agencies.\nAnd let me also stress that this does not\nmean that the rest of the ESA is inapplicable once a\npermitting program of the State is approved. The\ncentral provision of the ESA, the prohibition against\ntaking endangered species act and other provisions\nagainst trading in them and importing, exporting, all\nthose remain applicable. Those are the generally\napplicable provisions that prohibit the taking\nof endangered species.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I understand very well your\nargument that if the EPA is going to transfer this, they\ntransfer it to Arizona and the first thing they say is,\nwe look at Arizona's laws and they protect everything.\nAnd now we look at our own authority and if they get --\nstart mucking around with this, we can refuse the\npermit. And besides that, we have a memorandum of\nunderstanding and the memorandum of understanding or\nwhatever it is, agreement or something, is going to be\nthey're going to pay as much attention as we are. So\nthey'll pay attention to this, too, and if they don't we\nhave an enforcement mechanism. So no problem; we are\nnot putting any species in jeopardy. We satisfy the\nstandard. I've got that part of the argument. I think\nI paraphrased it pretty well.\nThe part I don't get is then you say,\nanyway, we don't have to do any of this because it says\n\"shall transfer,\" therefore, it's not discretionary,\nit's mandatory. That part I don't get because there are\nnine standards there and it seems to me to say that is\nrather like saying, well, the ICC used to say you shall\nlet the railroad build a spur, provided it's in the\npublic interest, convenience, and necessity.\nI mean, are you suddenly saying every\nstatute that uses the word \"shall\" is not subject to the\nESA?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I think it would\nrequire a statute by statute evaluation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right, fine.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But we think this one is\nparticularly clear.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, my problem with saying\nit's clear is that they have nine criteria. One of the\ncriteria is you look to five other statutes, which they\nhave their own criteria and one of those criteria is you\nhave to be certain that the State will assure the\nprotection and propagation of a balanced population of\nshellfish, fish, and wildlife.\nAnd by the time you get through those nine\ncriteria, I don't think you'd have to be too imaginative\na lawyer to figure out ways that they involve everything\nthe ESA involves. So if there ever was an act prefaced\nby the word \"shall\" where the ESA would apply, you would\nthink it would this be this one, which has to do with\nwater, environmental protection, nine criteria, many\nvague, and they use words like \"wildlife,\" \"shellfish,\"\net cetera.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Several, several responses to\nthat. Those cross-references -- first of all, 402(b)\nlooks only to whether the State has the legal report\nunder State it law. Among other things, it requires a\ncertification or determination by the attorney general\nof the State to establish that the State actually has\nthe authority to administer.\nAnd the references to, cross-references to\nfish and wildlife that come from incorporating other\nprovisions have to do with the setting of the standards\nor setting -- under section 302, which EPA has never\ninvoked, setting certain supplementary effluent\nstandards to protect fish and wildlife. Those are the\nstandards. EPA does not evaluate the state's water\nquality standards in deciding whether the State has the\nlegal authority under 402(b) to administer the program.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Of the states to whom a\ntransfer has been made how many have agreed to comply\nwith this provision of the Endangered Species Act?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I'm not sure. I don't think\n--\nJUSTICE ALITO: In the memorandum of\nagreement with the states to whom transfers have been\nmade, in some of them, is there not language in which\nthe State has agreed that we'll consult with Fish and\nWildlife --\nMR. KNEEDLER: There was, there was in the\nLouisiana memorandum of agreement that was involved in\nthe Fifth Circuit's American Forestry decision, and it\nwas that provision that the Fifth Circuit held was\nunlawful on two grounds. That, that memorandum of\nagreement basically said we're trying to do something\nanalogous to Section 7 of the ESA when the State is\nadministering the program; and the Fifth Circuit said\nthat went beyond EPA's authority by conditioning the\napproval on the State putting in place a compensation\narrangement.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You mentioned a whole\nstring of states, I think, Texas, Florida, Maine were\nmentioned as states that -- in connection with the\ntransfer of the permitting authority had conditions that\nmade the Endangered Species Act applicable.\nMR. KNEEDLER: That's not correct,\nJustice -- Justice Ginsburg. What, after the Fifth\nCircuit's decision, EPA never tried to impose on a State\nan obligation to go forward in the same way that EPA, or\neven in a similar way that EPA would under Section 7 of\nthe Endangered Species Act.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So what was done in\nTexas, Florida and Maine?\nMR. KNEEDLER: They all provided what I've\ndescribed to Justice Souter, that -- that the\npre-existing ESA, EPA regulations require that draft\npermits be furnished to the, to Fish and Wildlife and to\nNOAA, and that they take into account the comments by\nFish and Wildlife and NOAA. That doesn't come from the\nmemorandum of agreement or -- or -- or EPA's memorandum\nof agreement with the states. That's something that\ncomes from the regulations. Everything else --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So that, would that apply\nin this case? Would that apply to Arizona?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. And, and the\nbiological, the memorandum of agreement in this case\napplies to all State-administered programs including\nthose that were approved by EPA before 1993. This is a\nnationwide memorandum of agreement.\nAnd the basis --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Kneedler, may I ask a\nquestion about the memorandum of agreement? That's kind\nof a new concept that I have a little difficulty\nfollowing.\nIs there -- is that, is one of the nine\nconditions of approval that the State enter into a\nmemorandum of agreement?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, it is -- no it is not.\nThe memorandum of --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is there not a regulation\nthat issues, that requires the states --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. There, there's --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What's the statutory\nauthority for the regulation?\nMR. KNEEDLER: 33 U.S.C. 1314(i) allows --\nprovides -- excuse me -- for EPA to establish\nguidelines, basic guidelines, minimum standards for\nState programs and -- part of that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What if -- what if the\nState just refused to enter into a memorandum of\nagreement? Would that, could that be a ground for\nrefusing to transfer decision?\nMR. KNEEDLER: If, if the, if its refusal\nwas based on an objection to things that are within the,\nwithin the legitimate scope of a memorandum of\nagreement. I think that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Just says don't want -- it\njust says we don't want to enter into a memorandum of\nagreement, period.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yeah. I -- I think -- I\ndon't think EPA has ever confronted that. But I think\nit probably, it probably could be denied, but the\nregulations do not -- as I recall -- specifically\ncondition the approval of the program on the memorandum\nof agreement.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- that require the making\nof a memorandum of agreement.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. I would, I would\nhesitate to say that EPA could not -- could not insist\non that, but it's important again to come back to the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But how can that be\nconsistent with your shall argument?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Because there's a separate\nauthority for the, for the, for EPA to issue guidelines\nfor minimum, minimum standards for State programs, but\nthose have to do with -- with communications with EPA\nand sort of running a program. And it's not a vehicle\nas I said before for EPA to impose new substantive\nrequirements outside the Clean Water Act on the State.\nAnd that's why if -- that's why if EPA insisted that a\nState enter into a memorandum of understanding that\nbasically said we will, we will act like EPA does under\nSection 7 of the Endangered Species Act under the\nadministration of the program, I think the, I think the\nState agency would be entitled to decline to enter into\nthat agreement. And again that's essentially what the\nFifth Circuit held in the American Forestry case, and to\nwhat extent we agree with the American Forestry\ndecision.\nIf I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of\nmy time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Kneedler.\nMr. Glitzenstein?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC R. GLITZENSTEIN,\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court.\nI particularly start off with the memorandum\nof agreement that was just being discussed, and to, I\nthink, at least try to clarify an answer, I think, to\nJustice Ginsburg's question about compliance with that\nmemorandum of agreement. If you look at page 260 of the\nNAHB appendix that was filed along with the petition,\none of the elements of that memorandum of agreement is\nthat there would be compliance with Section 7 of the\nEndangered Species Act when there were transfer\ndecisions being made by the EPA. And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where is this? Would you\n--\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: This is page 260.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of --\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: Of the NAHB appendix,\nwhich is -- there are two volumes of that appendix,\nJustice Scalia. Volume one was pages 1 to 317, which is\nthe white cover volume, and I can quote from the\nparagraph that I was referring to. And it's the first\nfull paragraph and it reads --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: 270 you say?\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: 260, I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: 260.\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: 260, around.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I got it.\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: And it's the first full\nparagraph and it says: \"EPA's current practice is to\nconsult with the Services where EPA determines that\napproval of a State's or a Tribe's application to\nadminister the NPDES program may affect federally listed\nspecies.\" And they actually complied with that\nmemorandum of agreement in this case when they consulted\nin response to the Arizona application.\nNow, this memorandum of agreement which\nMr. Kneedler just represented to the Court is continuing\nto be complied with, specifically provides the\nmechanisms by which the Clean Water Act and the\nEndangered Species Act will be reconciled and will be\nharmonized. This language was adopted after notice and\ncomment proceedings. It is reflected not only in the\napplication and the final decision made in this case,\nwhere once again the EPA said point blank, we are\nrequired to comply with Section 7 of the Endangered\nSpecies Act; but essentially the same understanding of\nthe Agency's legal duties and how they would be\nreconciled was set forth in all these past consultation\ndecisions that are described in the decisions below and\nour brief.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can that be read just to\napply to any, any State permits that -- that violate\nClean Water requirements? As opposed to upland habitat\nwhich -- which might be affected?\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: There's certainly there's\nnothing in the memorandum of agreement that says that.\nBut can I just add a critical point on that,\nJustice Scalia? The Government's position now is that\nit doesn't matter. Their new position in response to\nJustice Stevens's question about the change in position,\nbefore the Government came to this Court, they never\npreviously suggested what they're now saying, which is\nthat Section 7(A)(2) consultation obligations and the\nno-jeopardy prohibition don't apply at all to these\ntransfer decisions.\nSo this distinction between aquatic species\nand upland species, which may be an interesting one to\nexplore, we would submit on remand, is not the current\nreflection of their position. Their position now is we\ncould have something causing the extinction of aquatic\nspecies as a result of a pollution impact but we are\nunder no obligation to even take a look at that under\nthe seemingly mandatory requirement of Section 7.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, how do you feel --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not quite\nright. They would look at that in the context of\nreviewing the permits that are issued by the State\nagencies.\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: Your Honor, and I think\nthat's where we seem to have a little bit of a\ndisconnect. The assumption that Mr. Kneedler seems to\nbe making is the end of the consultation process that\nSection 7 requires, not the beginning of it. The\npurpose of the consultation process is to avoid\nconflicts with other statutory obligations, note to\ncreate them, and indeed as that memorandum of agreement\nlanguage suggests, the consultation process has been\nused precisely --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, what he's\nsuggesting is there isn't going to be any impact on any\nendangered species until a particular permit is issued\nby the State agency, and that those permits are\nsubmitted to the Fish and Wildlife Service for their\nreview.\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: That's correct, Your\nHonor. But to go back to the suggestion that I think\nJustice Souter made, what the agencies have done in the\npast, and this is a situation where we don't have to\nspeculate about whether the agencies can comply with\nthose statutes. They have done it. They've worked\nthese problems out. And what they have done when\nthey've consulted, if you go back and look at the\nunderlying consultation documents, they've spelled out\nexactly what Your Honor just suggested should be the\napproach. They've said, all right, when we issue these\npermits under Section 402 -- under 402(b) and do we\nexercise our oversight responsibilities under 402(d),\nhere are the species we are going to pay special\nattention to. For example, in the Maine delegation, one\nof the principal species of concern was the Atlantic\nsalmon, which they were concerned about because of\nimpacts from the aquaculture industry. What they did in\nthe biological opinion prepared as a consequence of that\nconsultation was not say, we're not going to let this\ntransfer go through. They said we have this oversight\nability. We're going to work out with the Fish and\nWildlife Service the mechanism by when those permits\ncome to our attention, as they must under section\n402(d), we will discuss the circumstances and criteria\nfor objecting to those, we will go to the State under\nthe following circumstances, and say we think this\npermit is going to cause the jeopardy of the species --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What does that have\nto do with the -- I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that those are in\nplace. As I understood Mr. Kneedler to say that that's\nexactly what they, what they continue to do.\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: Your Honor, and again --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that has nothing to do,\nas the Chief was about to say before I interrupted him,\nthat has nothing to do with, with whether they have to\nissue the NPDES authorization.\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: And I guess the point I'm\ntrying to make, Your Honor, is that the Court's\nfundamental obligation when it has two statutes that\nhave shall provisions, is to see if there's a way they\ncan be reconciled and worked out. And What I'm saying\nis that the consultation process has been and should be\nprecisely the process where those kinds of issues will\nbe reconciled and that's exactly how this process is\nworking. So for the Government to come in and say let's\nnot use the process that 7(a)(2) calls for, in order to\ntry to avoid the problems, is to really put the cart\nbefore the horse in the most, I think, obvious way\nimaginable.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could I get back to the\nmemorandum of agreement that you've called our attention\nto on page 260? I read that paragraph, and I don't see\nanything in it that imposes any obligation whatever on\nthe State. It is just a description of what -- what EPA\nis, is going to do.\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The same kind of\nconsultation with Fish and Wildlife that, that\nMr. Kneedler described to us.\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: I think, Your Honor, and\nI think that's critical. I think we're making some\nassumptions here that, at least on our side, we're not\nmaking. We're not assuming that the outcome of the\nconsultation process has to be to impose new conditions\non the State. One of the outcomes of the prior\nconsultation process with Maine, with Texas, for\nexample, was to spell out how the Service and EPA would\naddress their post-transfer concerns.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But this is talking about\nconsultation when the permit is -- the permit\napplication is issued. Not consultation at the, at the\nstage of approving the State plan.\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: With all deference, Your\nHonor, it says: \"The current practice to consult with\nthe Services where EPA determines that approval of a\nState's or Tribe's application to administer the\nprogram. And I think there is concession by the other\nside that that in fact was a reflection of what the\npractice was. They were consulting on the actual\ntransfer of the programs, and the reason they were doing\nthat, Chief Justice Roberts, was to do exactly what Your\nHonor is suggesting, that is to work out a mechanism\nbeforehand, so that when the State permits are being\nissued, the agencies would know how to address their\nconcerns.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the point -- the\npoint is that it's the issuance of a permit under the\nprogram, whether administered by the Federal Government\nor the State government that has the potential for\njeopardizing endangered species. It is not the\nadministration of the program. And EPA has in place the\nprocedures to allow them to review the particular\npermits, which what is what might jeopardize an\nendangered species. And they don't need to leverage\ntheir limited authority, their non-discretionary\nauthority to approve a transfer, to have that authority\nto review the actual act that might jeopardize an\nendangered species.\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: That's true, Your Honor,\nbut again I think what the Court may be doing is\nassuming that this consultation process is somewhat more\ndraconian than it frequently turns out to be. If the\nonly outcome of the consultation process under Section\n7(a)(2) is for the Fish and Wildlife Service to reach\nsome understanding with EPA, it says when these permits\nare issued by the states, here are the circumstances\nunder which you're going to lodge objections, because\nwe're the expert agency on species. And I think this\nrecord shows what we're talking about.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you -- are you saying\nthat the consultation does beyond the nine factors that\nare listed in the statute?\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: No, Your Honor. I think\nwhat we're saying is that consultation goes to the\nseparate obligation under 7(a)(2) of the Endangered\nSpecies Act to address the impacts on a listed species.\nAnd if I could --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But isn't that beyond the\nnine factors?\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: I don't think -- I think\nwhat it is is an effort, as there's been discussion\nhere, to reconcile two obligations, both of which\nCongress felt were important. And that's exactly what\nthe agency has done in other circumstances.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I understand that.\nBut when they sit down and they have the consultation,\nis it proper for the EPA to say now, we're consulting\nwith you, but only with respect to the nine factors, as\nto permits that are issued by the states afterwards, but\nthen that's something else.\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: Well, and Your Honor,\njust on that point, I found the Government's reply brief\na little bit odd, because I think consistent with the\nquestioning from Justice Breyer, it acknowledges for the\nfirst time that these factors do encompass some\nconsideration of wildlife impacts. But putting that to\none side, I think it's very important to compare what\nthey're arguing now with how they dealt with other\ncross-cutting legal obligations. If you look, for\nexample, at how they dealt with the Indian trust\nresponsibility -- I'm only bringing this up by way of\nanalogy, because I think the government's position is,\noh, we're trying to elevate the Endangered Species Act\nto some exalted status, and in fact all we're saying on\nthis administrative record is that's the same status\nthat they accorded to other cross-cutting legal\nobligations.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But what is your position\nas to the propriety of the EPA's saying what I've said\nin my hypothetical instance? If they -- they say we're\ngoing to consult with you but we want to make it clear\nwe're only talking about the nine factors.\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: I think that my argument\nis that the Endangered Species Act on its face says that\nit prohibits jeopardy or the result of habitat\ndestruction, critical habitat destruction, for any\nagency action that is authorized, funded or carried out.\nOur view is that they should first look to the Clean\nWater Act criteria and factors. We think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think you are at\nissue with the government on that point.\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: We are, Your Honor. What\nI will say to you, with all respect, Justice Kennedy,\nand the reason I bring up their other legal obligations,\nand I think it also reinforces the value of a remand in\nthis case, so some of the issues raised by the\ngovernment's new position would be flushed out in the\nadministrative process. If you look at joint appendix,\npage 203, when Native American tribes wrote to the\nagency and said we are concerned about the impact of\nthis transfer on Native American historic properties and\ncultural and religious attributes, the EPA did not write\nback and say well, we're sorry, Native American tribes,\nthat doesn't fall within the nine criteria.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what is -- is\nthere any limitation? Let's say that EPA says we're all\nset to approve this transfer, except OSHA sent us a\nletter and they don't like the occupational safety rules\nyou have at the State environmental agency; so until you\nchange those rules, or enter a memorandum of agreement\nthat you're going to change those rules, we're not going\nto approve the transfer.\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: I think the line, Your\nHonor, is whether you've got another crosscutting\nobligation --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, like the OSHA\nact. It says, you know, the states should do this, and\nthey're not doing it. So EPA can leverage their\napproval into any area of law?\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: Again, Your Honor, I\nthink the first problem is, with that question is that,\nI don't mean to be evasive, but I think the problem is\nyou're assuming the outcome of the analysis, which is\nthat they'll have to impose some new condition on the\nState. With the Native American tribes, they didn't do\nthat. They didn't impose any condition on the State.\nThey said we'll have an agreement with the Native\nAmerican tribes that when we exercise our oversight\nauthority, we will look at the impact upon --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But sometimes states\nsay no. So if they say no, presumably they're going to\nhave to impose the obligation as a condition of\napproval.\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: Yeah. And what I will\nsay, Your Honor, is we think that in the past they have\nbeen able to work these problems out. But if they\ncan't, I think it's important to recognize that Congress\ncreated a mechanism precisely for the very\nrare situation where there is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That isn't the -- what I'm\ntrying to figure out with Justice Kennedy's questions\nand your answers is, is there really an issue here? And\nI'm beginning to see maybe there is an issue when you\nsaid what are they talking about. Can you -- it's a\ncactus. They're kidnapping cactus, as apparently\nhappens. And if in fact this cactus, if the thing is\ntransferred to the State, that cactus is going to\ndisappear. Now that isn't fish. It isn't wildlife. It\nisn't water. It's a cactus.\nSo can you take that into account? Is that\ntheoretical? I think they're trying to raise this\nquestion of, suppose you know the IRS, that if you mail\na refund check at the time, the person who gets it is\ngoing to use the $500 to destroy the last salamander in\nthe world. Okay? Now there we are, endangered species.\nDoes the Act apply to the IRS? I would have thought the\nanswer's no.\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: The answer is no, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And then I would have\nthought the same reasoning is true here, but what the\nAct tells you to do is read your existing authority, but\nread it in light of informed by the endangered species\nobjectives language, et cetera.\nAnd now I wonder if with that approach, is\nit possible that even the cactus could fall within the\nnine criteria? You're not going to depart from them but\nyou're going to read them generously in light of the\nobjective of the Endangered Species Act, which is itself\nan environmental objective. Now how does that work?\nCan you do that? You're an imaginative lawyer. Can you\ndo it?\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: Well, I think you can.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. The answer is\nyou can. Then are you satisfied with this result in\nthis Court? One, it can be read that way. They're not\ngoing to agree with that. It can be read that way, and\ntherefore, it applies. The ESA, the Endangered --\nTwo, that means they consult.\nBut three, the result of the consultation\nhere which has been done means there's no real objection\nto the transfer, because it's virtually inconceivable\ngiven the weapon that the EPA has, withdrawing permits,\ngiven a memorandum of agreement, given the possibility\nof supervision, given the fact that the wildlife service\nwill object, writing them a letter or a phone call\nimmediately, given all that stuff, there's simply no\nreason to believe that Arizona will fail to protect\nendangered species.\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: I think that's a good\nsummary of what has happened with these consultations,\nand on the cactus --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what's your view of an\nopinion that roughly wrote what I just said?\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: Well, I think the concern\nI would have is that I think it goes beyond what's\nnecessary here because we're not dealing, everybody\nagrees, with some purely ministerial situation like that\none.\nI think the other critical factor here, Your\nHonor, that we haven't talked about, is the funding of\nthis program. And it's very interesting when the\ngovernment points out, if I can just get across to the\nCourt I think a critical citation, because the\ngovernment says funding is not before us. And the\nreason they say that is because it didn't need to be\nbefore us when they took the position that authorization\nof the program was sufficient to trigger their\nconsultation duties. And in a footnote in their reply\nbrief, they say pay no attention to funding, which is of\ncourse a discretionary activity, because that's\ncompletely separate from the decision to authorize. If\nyou look at 40 C.F.R. Section 123.23(3), and I\napologize -- this is a response to their reply brief\npoint so there's not any appendix before the Court --\nbut it specifically provides that funding opportunities\nare part and parcel of the decision to authorize the\nprogram.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what you're\ntalking about. Funding of what?\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: Funding of the NPDES\nprogram carried out by Arizona that had to be approved\nin order to allow --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How does the government\nfund it?\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: They have to -- there's a\n-- Section 106 of the Clean Water Act provides the EPA\nwith an opportunity, and it's certainly not mandatory,\nto provide funding to a State. And this is 40\npercent Federal -- we're not talking about de minimis\nfunding. So it's one thing for the State to say well,\nit should get the program. It's another thing to say\nfunding. And just to be clear about this, this is an\nargument we're making to reinforce the propriety of\nremand in this case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you -- you have\nother -- let's assume that I disagree with you on\nwhether they could withhold approval of the NPDES\ntransfer. Even so, I think you -- the point you're\nmaking now is that apart from that approval, there were\nother discretionary actions taken here, one of which is\nthis funding; and another one of which, I believe, is\nwhether -- never mind the MOAs, but -- I have it written\ndown here, one of the other ones. Oh, whether existing\npermits would be transferred to State authority or not.\nAnd that is apparently discretionary and can be -- what\ndo we do about that?\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: Well, we suggest, Your\nHonor -- and I think this goes back to Justice Stevens's\nquestion about the change in position. I think we're in\nan odd position in this Court quite frankly because we\nhave an administrative record where the administrator\nconceded a duty to comply with Section 7 of the\nEndangered Species Act. We have a new position here\nsaying they don't. And we think funding and the other\nexample you came up with is a good reason why a common\nsense result in this case is to say we have a change in\nposition, there are new issues brought to the fore. As\na consequence of that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question\nabout changing position? Have you agreed and conceded\nthat the nine statutory criteria are satisfied?\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: We have --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You shift back and forth\non that point.\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: Your Honor, let me be\nclear about that. We never conceded that. What\nhappened --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What is your view now?\nAre they or are they not?\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: I think that there are\nactually arguments that, especially with regard to the\nwildlife related parts of the criteria, that are not\nsatisfied. Let me -- let me try to explain why we\ndidn't feel it necessary to argue that in the court of\nappeals.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Before you say why you\ndidn't argue it, it's exactly that point I sort of\nexpected you might agree when I though maybe you have\nhooks to hang the NSA, the Endangered Species Act on.\nBut it was the other half, which I think is what\nJustice Stevens is saying now. I read through this\nrecord, not completely but pretty well, and I couldn't\nfind a single thing that would suggest that Arizona\npresents any risk to you. And so, what is the risk to\nan endangered species that you're actually worried about\nthere? And you rather -- I didn't think you'd like to\nagree with that, but I want to press you to find out\nwhat actually is the problem.\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: If I can give Your Honor\nsome citations to the record, I think it will help\nanswer that. On page 54 of the joint appendix, the Fish\nand Wildlife Service biologists, the expert agency\nemployees, said that there would be significant effects\nto survival and recovery of listed species through a\ndestruction, degradation and fragmentation of habitats.\nThey specifically pinpointed the flycatcher, the\nsouthwestern willow flycatcher is a species that could\nbe devastated. That's at page --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And how would that happen?\nHow would it happen that they would get rid of the\nflycatcher in Arizona, considering the fact that they\nhave laws themselves that protect endangered species,\nand that's a bird, and a bird is wildlife; and so if\nthey decide they want to kill all their flycatchers,\nwhich I would doubt, you could intervene at EPA and stop\nthem. So how is that actually a problem?\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: Your Honor, the concern\nthat they had was that the mechanism that had been used\nto protect these wildlife species, and particularly\nplant species, which I want to get to in a moment,\nbecause I think actually the concern is even greater\nwith plants, was that the consultation on federally\nissued permits had in effect been used, and this was not\nconjectural, they had been used to safeguard\nconsiderable habitat for these species. And if I could\nturn actually to the water level, which is I think\nactually our best example, and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, that's not enough.\nWhy wouldn't -- what would lead you to believe that it\nwouldn't -- that the same would not happen when the\nState issued the permits? I mean, you have to show some\nreason why we don't trust Arizona to do what the Federal\ngovernment's doing.\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: Your Honor, it is not a\nquestion of trusting them. I think part of the outcome\nof the consultation --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well then, you have to\nestablish jeopardy. You have to establish jeopardy.\nAnd the mere fact that you're giving it to a State which\nCongress has been willing to trust with implementing\nthis law is not enough to show that there's jeopardy.\nPrima facie, we would expect Arizona to do the right\nthing.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Just as a technical matter,\ndon't they have to show there's no jeopardy?\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: Yes, Your Honor. The\nburden is on the Agency in the consultation process.\nAnd it's at, as TVA versus Hill makes clear, the benefit\nof the doubt is accorded to the species. But, could I\ntry to answer that question?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: We're not saying we don't\ntrust the State. And In fact, one of the outcomes of\none these prior consultation processes has been where\nit's appropriate, the service works had an agreement\nwith the State where it says here are our concerns where\nthe expert Federal agency, we listed these species, you\ndidn't. Part of it's expertise, not trust. And in\nfact, if the State comes back and says we understand,\nwe'll deal with that problem, that is one aspect of a\nconsultation process that the government is now saying\nwe should never have to go through.\nOn the plants however, Your Honor, there is\na very serious concern. In this respect the service\nbiologists said we have protected these plants' habitats\nthrough the Section 7 mechanism. The State of Arizona\nacknowledges that it has no law or regulation which\nforbids the destruction of federally listed plant\nspecies.\nSection 9 of the Endangered Species Act,\nwhich Mr. Kneedler brought up and said it was the most\nimportant provision, and I would beg to differ. I think\nSweet Home, both the majority and dissenting opinions\nagree that Section 7 -- and Hill -- that Section 7 is\nthe most important provision. But plant species are not\nprotected generally by Section 9 of the Endangered\nSpecies Act, the take provision, except when they're on\nFederal lands.\nSo we have a situation where the service\nbiologists were saying, and this is how I read the\nrecord, and if I can give a couple more citations, page\n128 and 139 of the joint appendix. On one plant\nspecies, joint appendix page 436. On the water on both,\nthey were essentially predicting jeopardy, unless\nadditional protections could be worked out in this\nprocess.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Jeopardy from the\nissuance of a prospective future issuance of a permit by\nArizona if they get the delegated authority. And that\nissuance of the permit would be subject to objection and\nreview by EPA and the Fish and Wildlife Service.\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: With regard to the plant,\nYour Honor, EPA's position to date has been that they do\nnot have the authority to protect that plant species\nunder their Clean Water Act authorities. Now we may\ndisagree with that, but that is the position they've\ntaken so far.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The position that\nEPA has taken.\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: That's correct, Your\nHonor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under their\nauthority.\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: Under their Clean Water\nAct authority, which is what informs their oversight\nactivities.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So how does it\nmatter whether they have it or if it's transferred to\nArizona?\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: Because again, what the\nconsultation process is designed to accomplish, either\nthrough the funding, discretionary decision that was\nmade, other mechanisms that can come into play, the idea\nbehind the consultation on the transfer -- and I think\nthis is critical to our position -- is to say if we're\nnot going to be able to protect the species through the\nState issuance of the permits and the other authorities\nwe have, what understanding can we come to, consistent\nwith our --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand --\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: -- other obligations to\nprotect the plant species.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that\nanswer. The Chief Justice is asking, if EPA cannot do\nit itself, how is it creating any jeopardy in\ntransferring the authority to somebody else who can't do\nit?\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: Your Honor, what the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, if you assume that\nEPA can't protect these plant species under its\nlegislation, what harm is there in transferring the\nauthority to somebody else who can't protect it?\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: Well, I should just first\nsay that we disagree with the premise of that question.\nIn terms of EPA's position, we happen to think that EPA\ncan protect those kind of plant species, and I think\nthat's one of the additional bases s for a remand.\nBut I think the more important answer to\nYour Honor's question is that the Fish and Wildlife\nService biologist said in this administrative record\nthat the loss of those protections was an indirect\neffect of the transfer, that because we have used these\nprotections when we've issued Federal permits to prevent\nspecies like these plant species from going extinction\n-- and this was not speculative --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If the EPA can protect the\nplants when the permit is under its own jurisdiction,\nwhy can't it use that same basis for objecting when it's\nunder the State's jurisdiction?\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: Your Honor, that's an\nawfully good question. And in fact we believe that\nshould have been one of the outcomes of the\nconsultations.\nOn the transfer. If one of the results of\nthe transfer -- and I think this was -- I think what's\nhappening is that the government has basically assumed\nthe answer to the consultation before we've gotten to\nthat point. They've assumed --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What's the difference\nbetween Arizona's situation and all the other States\nthat can issue permits? Are they under legal obligation\nto consult?\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: I believe that --\nJUSTICE ALITO: And where is --\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: It's not the State's\nobligation to consult, Your Honor. Just to be clear,\nSection 67 imposes no obligation on the State. We\ncompletely agree with that. It imposes an obligation on\na Federal agency.\nJUSTICE ALITO: You say it imposes an\nobligation on EPA to require the States to consult.\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: We don't disagree with\nthat either, Your Honor. We believe that there are\nmechanisms that have been used in past consultations,\nespecially after the Louisiana decision that came down,\nwhich involve the State not at all, which involve only\nthe Fish and Wildlife Service and the EPA recognizing\nhow they would exercise their --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I still don't understand the\ndifference between what you think is going to happen in\nArizona and what is happening in all the other States\nthat issue permits.\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: Your Honor, we're not\nsaying that -- particularly with regard to Texas,\nFlorida, Oklahoma, Louisiana and other States that have\ngone through the consultation process, we're not saying\nthat anything different should happen. We're saying go\nthrough a full consultation process, agree on mechanisms\nthat can protect these species.\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, in the issuance of a\npermit in any of these States, pick any State you like,\nwhat is the difference between what you envision would\nhappen in Arizona, if Arizona can issue permits, and\nwhat's happening in these other States?\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: Again, with regard to\nconsultation with Arizona, all we're asking for and all\nwe've ever asked for in this case, and this was what the\nservice biologist said, was use the consultation process\nto agree on measures that can be put in place\npost-transfer that will prevent the species from going\nextinct. That's what happened --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I ask you to follow up\non that? A few minutes -- I guess your time is getting\nshort and I'd like to get away from some of the\nspecifics and back to the general. A minute ago,\nJustice Breyer in effect offered you an opinion and he\nspelled it out and he said, if I put that in writing is\nthat what you want? You said, well, it's really more\nthan we need.\nWould you please at this point summarize as\nsuccinctly as you can what you need to win this case?\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: Well, the narrowest thing\nwe need is simply a decision that the government changed\nits position and the case should be remanded.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, tell me substantively,\nwhat do you want? What substantively do you want at the\nend of this case?\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: Your Honor, what we would\nlike is a ruling that says that 7(a)(2) imposes\nobligations on Federal agencies just like the Clean\nWater Act does, that the agency should make a good faith\n-- and this is the words of Congress -- \"a good faith\neffort to use the consultation process provided by\n7(a)(2) to devise mechanisms to protect species.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And how will they put those\nmechanisms in legal form?\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: They would put those\nmechanisms in legal form either through memorandum of\nagreement, which is what's been used in the past,\nseparate agreements between EPA and the Fish and\nWildlife Service --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: By coercing, by coercing\nthe States to sign those agreements on pain of not\ngetting NPDES authority?\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: No, Your Honor. In fact\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What do they do then? They\njust whistle and this comes forth? States don't sign\nstuff just, just for the sake of it.\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: Your Honor, I think part\nof this, these agreements, wouldn't have to be signed by\nthe State at all.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Justice Scalia's got a fair\npoint. What if the States say, we don't want a\nmemorandum of agreement? What does the Federal\nGovernment do at that point? Doesn't the Federal\nGovernment at that point say, okay, we're not going to\nissue the transfer under Clean Water because we have an\nindependent obligation under Endangered Species and\nthere's got to be both or there will be neither? Isn't\nthat the Federal Government's position?\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: At the end of the day I\nthink it is. And there is an endangered species\ncommittee. Once again --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's your position, not the\nFederal Government's position. It's your position of\nwhat the Federal Government's position ought to be,\nright?\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: What I was trying to\nsuggest was -- I think if in the end of the day you look\nat all of these opportunities to protect species and you\nsay there's nothing we can do about it and the State\nrefuses to cooperate, you have what's called jeopardy or\ndestruction of critical habitat, and Congress said that\nthe mechanism for working out the conflict with another\nlaw is the endangered species committee, which we have\nnot talked about very much. That was Congress's answer.\nBut what I was trying to suggest was, long\nbefore you get to that point and without imposing a\nsingle obligation on the State, simply using the\nauthority under 402(d) of the Clean Water Act, which\nprovides for this oversight opportunity, the service and\nthe EPA can come to their own understanding as to how\nEPA will in fact carry out its post-transfer review of\nthese. And we think that is, that is an acceptable\nanswer to the question.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. GLITZENSTEIN: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Kneedler, you\nhave four minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice:\nFirst, with respect, stepping back and\nlooking at the legal theory, we think that this case is\nreally on all fours with the Public Citizen case. In\nfact, the court of appeals recognized that the operative\nregulation here, the definition of \"indirect effect,\"\nmeaning something caused by the agency, is just like the\none in Public Citizen. In Public Citizen this Court\nheld that where an agency has a mandatory duty and does\nnot have the ability to control subsequent events, that\nthe agency cannot be regarded as the legal cause of\nwhatever effects happen. That is exactly the case here.\nSection 402(b) mandates that EPA approve the\nState's application. EPA therefore, EPA's decision\ntherefore is not the legal cause of any effects that\nmight happen with respect to endangered species.\nI should point out that in this Court's\ndecision in Sweet Home this Court in footnotes 9 and 13\nread the other principal provision of the ESA, the take\nprovision, to incorporation a proximate cause\nlimitation. We think it follows that the jeopardize\nprohibition in Section 7 also incorporates a proximate\ncause or here legal cause restriction.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Kneedler, I hate to eat\nup any of your rebuttal time, but would you state\nbriefly what -- how you would treat these other matters\nthat were resolved by the agency and that were not\nmandatory, its decision to transfer prior certificate\nauthority to the States, for example, and the other\ninstance raised by opposing counsel? What if I agree\nwith you on whether you can deny the NPDES permit, but\nI'm concerned about these other actions by the agency\nthat were discretionary?\nMR. KNEEDLER: There has been no challenge\nto that, so I'm not in a position to give a definitive\nanswer. But I believe to the extent it would be\ndiscretionary that Section 7 may well kick in.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Should we remand?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, because there was no\nchallenge to that. There was no challenge to that\naspect of it. This was a challenge to the transfer of\nauthority, not ancillary matters addressed under the\nagreement.\nAlso, footnote 18 of the court of appeals\nopinion makes clear that Respondents did not challenge\nanything to do with funding, which is an entirely\nseparate administrative determination that there's a\nregulatory set of criteria for how funding gets\ndistributed, it is not dependent on whether the State\nhas NPDES authority. Section 106 of the Clean Water Act\nhas a separate funding mechanism for Clean Water Act\nauthority generally. So funding is simply not, it's\nsimply not in the case.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And it's in your\ndiscretion -- your distinction to the snail darter case\nis that the decision to built the dam is discretionary,\nnot mandatory?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, and in fact this Court's\ndecision in Hill can't be understood in any other day\nbecause the Court went out of its way to say that, while\nCongress committee reports indicated, for the\nappropriations bills, indicated an expectation that the\ndam would be built, the Court emphasized the fact that\nthere was no mandate in the appropriations statute\nitself. That would have been --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you mean the executive\ncan ignore earmarks?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. That part of the\nCourt's decision would have been unnecessary.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's a mandatory\ndecision? No, what's a discretionary decision? I mean,\nin the sense you're using it. I've never heard of an\nagency that could just give out money to whoever they\nwant, like you or me. There are always criteria. Write\na \"shall\"; there are always criteria.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But there are few statutes\nlike this, that say the agency shall unless certain\nthings happen.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You mean is it the word\n\"unless,\" because here we have nine and they're broad.\nProbably with funding we have 32. Maybe with some\nothers we have 14. But I can't get my mind around --\nMR. KNEEDLER: There may be particular\napplications of the standard, but that did not deter\nthis Court in Public Citizen, where the Court applied\nthe same principle and said where the agency has a\nmandatory duty and no discretion it is not the legal\ncause. That's the general principle. If there are\nother cases where that general principle has to be\napplied, there will be time enough for that\nconsideration to arise.\nAnother important aspect of Hill is this\nCourt quoted Representative Dingell, the sponsor of it,\nsaying that agencies are to take actions within their\npower, which suggest that -- and we think it's clear\nthrough the history, as we recite in our brief at pages\n27 and 28, from the text of the Act and from the\nevolution of Section 7, it was always understood to\napply to situations where the agencies had the existing\nauthority to take action, not to require them to\ncountermand statutory directives the way the Department\nof Transportation could not countermand statutory\ndirectives in Public Citizen.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
