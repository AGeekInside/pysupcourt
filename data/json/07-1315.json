        "content": "(1:01 p.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument this afternoon in Case 07-1315, Knowles v.\nMirzayance.\nMr. Mercer.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN E. MERCER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. MERCER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nUnder the deferential review required by the\nADPA, Mr. Mirzayance was not entitled to Federal habeas\ncorpus relief on his ineffective counsel claim because\nthe State court adjudication of that claim was not\ncontrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, the\nclearly established Strickland test. And because the\nStrickland rule is a general one, the California Supreme\nCourt had wide latitude in resolving that claim.\nIn this case, the Ninth Circuit applied\nsomething different from Strickland, finding that Wager\nwas duty-bound to present a State law affirmative\ndefense because no other defenses were said to be\navailable at that time and because it merely might have\nworked. But even the Ninth Circuit conceded that this\nCourt has never announced such a test. And as in --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: At some point during the\noral argument, and perhaps at the beginning because it\nis the beginning inquiry: When there is an evidentiary\nhearing, how does the standard for the court of appeals\ndiffer than when there has been no evidentiary hearing?\nMR. MERCER: Well, I think it depends on\nwhether the Federal habeas court is doing a section\n2254(d) analysis. The fact is that section 2254(d), for\nexample, doesn't speak to denying a claim on the merits,\neven if it's unexhausted. So, in theory, a Federal\nhabeas court could perhaps accept new evidence that the\nState court never had before it in order to deny relief.\nBut we cannot envision a situation where it would ever\nbe efficacious to hold a hearing in light of --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let me put it --\nMR. MERCER: -- a --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me put it this way:\nWe're the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, let's\nassume. What effect do we give to what the district\ncourt did, and how would that -- how would the case be\ndifferent than if we were simply reviewing the same\nsituation and it came from the State court? What's the\ndifference?\nMR. MERCER: Well, there shouldn't be a\ndifference.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: We just pretend the\nhearing didn't happen?\nMR. MERCER: Well, I would say that in\nvirtually every case it, in fact, is a meaningless\ndistraction from what the State court did based on the\nrecord presented it, and here's why. Because if the\nState court made a reasonable adjudication of the merits\nof the claim based on the State court record, then even\nholding a hearing wouldn't make any difference because\nrelief would still be precluded under 2254(d).\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do we look to the Federal\ncourt evidentiary hearing as part of the analysis to\ndetermine whether what the State court did was\nreasonable? And you -- and you have -- you have thought\nabout this, and obviously the problem is, since the\nCalifornia appellate courts didn't see the hearing, this\nis an artificial exercise, and you know the problem.\nMR. MERCER: Well, I think, again, the only\nquestion that matters is the 2254(d) question that says\nthat relief shall not be granted unless that State court\nadjudication based on the State court record presented\nwas unreasonable, and here is why.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I guess it could be\n-- it could be if we have an opinion that makes it clear\nthat you -- you must grant an evidentiary hearing in --\nin certain cases. And if the State court did not grant\nan evidentiary hearing, I guess you could say that that\nwas contrary to established Supreme Court law, couldn't\nyou?\nMR. MERCER: Perhaps, and -- and under\nextremely rare cases that may --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But unless -- unless there\nis a Supreme Court requirement that there be an\nevidentiary hearing, I don't see how holding an\nevidentiary hearing could show that the State court\ndecision, which was legitimately held without an\nevidentiary hearing, was contrary to our opinions. I\ndon't see how you can do that.\nMR. MERCER: Well, I agree, Justice Scalia,\nand this Court said in Holland v. Jackson that the\npertinent question is what the State court had in front\nof it. And the reason here is simple: That it is\nunfair to find that the State courts made an\nunreasonable application of law based on facts that they\ndidn't have. So --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Did at any point -- did\nthe State at any point challenge the correctness, the\npropriety, of holding the Federal evidentiary hearing?\nMR. MERCER: Yes, Justice Kennedy. Mr.\nMirzayance raised --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And if so, is that before\nus?\nMR. MERCER: I don't think so. We -- we\ndisagreed that there should have been an evidentiary\nhearing in the first place, and we argued that below.\nIt's our position that there should not have been an\nevidentiary hearing in the first place.\nIt's our position that, frankly, this was a\nstraightforward, routine Strickland case that was\nuncomplicated, properly adjudicated by the district\ncourt when they first reached it in 2001 without a\nhearing, and that the Ninth Circuit has come at this\nmatter with a -- a chestful of monkey wrenches in the\nsense that they should not have ordered the evidentiary\nhearing in the first place, and then when they did, they\nshould not have disregarded the very factfinding that\nthey ordered be done.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- so then -- so then\nwe do look at the facts. I don't want to take up your\nor the Court's time on this any more, but I remain\npuzzled, I have to tell you, about what to do with this\nhearing. I went through it at great length. It's very\ncareful factfinding, really.\nMR. MERCER: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I -- I just don't know\nhow to fit that with the standard when I look at the --\nthe reasonableness of the -- of the State court\ndecision.\nMR. MERCER: Well, I don't think it changed\nthe standard because 2254 simply requires an\nadjudication on the merits, and we have that here.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, would you -- would\nyou agree just as a general rule that unless we find --\nunless there is some rule under which we can conclude\nthat the State court should have held a hearing, that\nthere is no occasion to have a Federal evidentiary\nhearing?\nMR. MERCER: Yes, I would agree with that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That would be the general\nproposition.\nMR. MERCER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. MERCER: And I think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would that -- would\nthat principle have to be clearly established by one of\nour decisions?\nMR. MERCER: I think that question is\nunclear, Mr. Chief Justice, because this Court did\nrecently say in Landrigan that the decision to hold an\nevidentiary hearing remains within the sound discretion\nof the district court, but in the same sentence said\nthat that discretion was circumscribed by the ADPA.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why should we hold a\nhearing ourselves in the -- in the hypothetical\nsituation that Justice Souter mentioned? Why shouldn't\nwe just reverse the State courts for not having held an\nevidentiary hearing? Remand it to them, let them hold\nit, and let -- let them make the factual determination\non the basis of that, after which we would -- we would\napply the rather strict 2254 standard to -- to the\nresult of that hearing?\nMR. MERCER: Well, if a petitioner or a\nState prisoner was somehow precluded from developing\nfacts in the State court and should have had an\nevidentiary hearing under this Court's clearly\nestablished law, then that would be the correct\nsolution.\nHere, however, we have a fully developed\nState court record.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, I understand that. So\nyour -- your answer to Justice Souter would -- would not\nbe that -- that you can conduct a hearing if the State\nshould have conducted a hearing? What you should do if\nthe State should have conducted a hearing is send it\nback for the hearing.\nMR. MERCER: That is correct. The point\nhere under the ADPA -- and I think it is Congress's\nclear intent -- is that all of these claims are to be\nfunneled through the State courts first. And Congress\nhas entrusted the State courts to be the primary and\nfirst interpreters and enforcers of Federal\nconstitutional law for State prisoners' claims. And as\nthis Court has said many times, including in Sawyer v.\nSmith, they're co-equals to the Federal courts in doing\nso.\nSo what should have happened in this case we\ncontend is what the district court first did when\nconfronted with the claim in 2001. And that is you\nassess the facts and claims as presented to the State\ncourt and then decide whether it would be reasonable to\nreject the claim under either prong of Strickland. And\nas this Court said in Strickland itself, the easiest and\nmost direct way to answer that question is through the\nprejudice prong here.\nWe have to remember the reality of this case\nthat for an affirmative defense of insanity, or NGI\nunder California law, Attorney Wager bore the burden of\nproving by a preponderance of the evidence that his\nclient did not know the difference between right and\nwrong when he committed this crime.\nAnd every bit of Mirzayance's own deeds and\nwords show that he did. Before the killing itself, he\nclosed the curtains and waited until he was alone with\nthe victim before entering her room with a gun in his\npocket and the silent weapon drawn. He struck with the\nsilent weapon, delivering fatal blows, resorting to the\ngun only when she screamed and struggled, and then\nimmediately collected the shell casings, turned off the\nlights, collected the knife, went back to his apartment\nwhere he showered, disposed of the bloody clothes,\nconcocted a false alibi message on the machine -- excuse\nme -- and then, overcome with guilt at the wrongfulness\nof his conduct, he calls his friend and says: \"I messed\nup big-time.\" And that's at page 120 of the State\nreporter's transcript.\nAnd then, further acknowledging both the\nlegal and moral wrongfulness of his actions, he turns\nhimself in to the police. He says: \"I did a murder.\"\nWhen they asked him how he felt about it, he said: \"I\nfelt very guilty, very bad for what I've done. That's\nwhy I turned myself in.\"\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Was -- was -- is all of\nthis factual material in the -- in the documents\nsubmitted with the habeas, with the State habeas and the\nresponse to the State habeas?\nMR. MERCER: All of this was in the State\ntrial transcript, so, yes, Justice Souter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what did they do?\nDid they submit the trial transcript with the -- in --\nwith the response to the habeas petition at the State?\nIn other words, how did it get in front of the State\ncourt, is all I want to know.\nMR. MERCER: It was a direct appeal to the\nCalifornia Court of Appeals with a concurrently filed\nhabeas petition.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Ah, okay.\nMR. MERCER: Yes, okay.\nSo he was faced with that. And then on the\nflip side, there was not a shred of evidence that Mr.\nMirzayance ever thought that doing what he did was\nlegally or morally right. So given all that, given the\nextensive effort to cover his tracks and his own\nadmissions about the wrongfulness of his conduct, it was\nnot reasonably probable under Strickland for this jury\nto believe that he somehow did not know.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How about getting another\njury? That was -- one of the reasons that counsel gave\nwhy he, counsel, was withdrawing the NGI plea was the\njury had just found -- rejected the second-degree murder\ncharge and found that he had acted deliberately with\npremeditation. But couldn't -- because the first jury\nhad -- in the guilt phase, couldn't the attorney have\nrequested a brand new jury to hear the NGI plea?\nMR. MERCER: Mr. Wager did not believe that\nhe had grounds to do so in this case. And the district\ncourt first addressed that opinion at the petition\nappendix H in a footnote -- I believe it was footnote\n21, but I don't have that in front of me right now --\nwhere the district court talked about the standards for\ngetting a new jury and that under Penal Code, California\nPenal Code 1026, you had to show some cause to the trial\ncourt why this jury could not fairly address the claim.\nWager felt that he had no basis to do that at this time.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Mercer -- Mr. Mercer, I\nguess we could resolve the case by saying if there was\nany error it was harmless, but we didn't take the case\nfor that. That wouldn't be very helpful to the bar,\nwould it? I mean, I thought that the important issue\nhere is -- is the one you've been discussing, whether --\nwhether, in fact, you're bound to stick with the facts\nthat were -- were adjudicated by the State.\nMR. MERCER: I agree with you, Justice\nScalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So let's not do that, then.\nLet's -- let's decide something.\nMR. MERCER: Okay.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Good.\nMR. MERCER: Well, I'm confident that, you\nknow, as this Court addressed in Strickland itself, the\nclaim fails for lack of --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if -- if the\nProfitt -- the Fifth Circuit -- Profitt, the Fifth\nCircuit case, applies in the Ninth, Ninth Circuit, and I\nwould think it would, just as the magistrate judge\nthought that it would, then that would be -- present a\nvery close case and it would probably require reversal\nof the State court, wouldn't you think, if the Profitt\nrule applied? What is it, the \"all or\" -- not \"all or\nnothing\" --\nMR. MERCER: \"Nothing to lose.\"\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: \"Nothing to lose.\"\nMR. MERCER: Well, if -- we agree that\nnothing to lose, in fact, was what happened here, as in\nProfitt. The dissent recognized it, the District Court\nrecognized it, and I think you're right that this case\nsmacks of application of something like a \"nothing to\nlose\" type rule. And perhaps it's announced in Profitt,\nbut it surely has not been clearly established by this\nCourt in any decision, and that pre-AEDPA Profitt\ndecision from the Fifth Circuit certainly did not compel\nthe California court or any other State court to apply a\n\"nothing to lose\" rule on Strickland performance.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, isn't that --\nthe fundamental question is what level of generality you\nlook to determine what law has been clearly established?\nCertainly Strickland is clearly established.\nMR. MERCER: Certainly.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But as far as I can\ntell, the \"nothing to lose\" issue has not been addressed\nby us and is not clearly established. So why do we look\nat it at the latter level of generality as opposed to\nthe former?\nMR. MERCER: Well, certainly this Court\ncould indeed take a more narrow view of what is clearly\nestablished law. We agree that Strickland here covers\nthe vast majority of ineffectiveness cases. But\ncertainly, this Court has never squarely addressed such\nan issue before, and certainly, this Court has never\nannounced that test to bind the States to resolve this\nclaim.\nI think that the fallback position is,\nabsent a clear answer from this Court, as stated in Van\nPatten, absent a clear answer, the State courts are left\nwith a very general Strickland principle, and as this\nCourt stated in Yarborough v. Alvarado, the more general\nthe rule, the more leeway the States have in deciding\ncases on a case-by-case basis.\nSo certainly we feel that Wager's decision\nwas patently reasonable under a traditional Strickland\nanalysis. We're not asking for anything different.\nNow --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think -- I\nguess it's not open to us to issue a decision on the\n\"nothing to lose\" question or we don't have to. It's\nthe only -- the way we have to decide the case is to\ndetermine whether the Ninth Circuit's determination on\nthe \"nothing to lose\" question was clearly established\nby one of our cases.\nMR. MERCER: That's correct, Mr. Chief\nJustice. And I think this comes back to our original\npoint, that the only dispositive question here that\nreally matters is where -- when the State court\nadjudicates --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you this\nquestion. Supposing we were convinced, and I'm not\nsuggesting we should be on the record, but supposing we\nwere convinced that only the dumbest, untrained lawyer\nin the world could have failed to advance this defense,\nand that therefore I would have no doubt about it as an\noriginal proposition that he was incompetent under\nStrickland -- under the general Strickland standard.\nWould we be permitted to say that in the case, or would\nwe have to say, well, this particular kind of attorney\nerror has never been addressed before, and therefore, we\ncan't look at it?\nMR. MERCER: Well, I think that because this\nCourt has never even addressed conduct anything like\nthis by an attorney --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't it true that\nthere's a whole host of counsel errors that could\nviolate Strickland? But do you have to find one that we\nhave addressed before before a Federal court can apply\nand say Strickland was violated?\nMR. MERCER: I don't think you need one on\nall fours, exact fact patterns. That would be\nunworkable. What you do need to do is give the courts a\nclear answer to the question, and generally --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would it be -- wouldn't it\nbe a clear answer in this case to say this was a\nterrible lawyer, and therefore Strickland -- Strickland\napplies? Or could you say, we don't care how bad the\nlawyer was, Strickland -- we haven't adjudicated this\nprecise set of facts before, so that's the end of the\nball game?\nMR. MERCER: This Court could say you\nhaven't adjudicated this --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is that what you're asking\nus to do?\nMR. MERCER: We're not asking you to say\nthat a decision like this could never be unreasonable.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Oh, okay.\nMR. MERCER: Okay? We're asking that this\nCourt continue its Strickland jurisprudence that says\nthe Constitution makes one general requirement and, as\nstated in Roe v. Flores-Ortega, that requirement is that\ncounsel make reasonable choices.\nSo certainly, there could be a situation\nwhere counsel flipped a coin or made an arbitrary\ndecision or made an unreasonable decision --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why is it, then -- if we\nsay that and if Profitt is inconsistent with that, do we\nthen remand or do we say on this record clearly it was\nreasonable? Obviously you want us to do the latter, I\ntake it?\nMR. MERCER: Well, I don't frankly think\nthis case necessarily should be remanded back to the\nNinth Circuit. They've had it three times already. But\nI think that the writ needs to be denied under a\ntraditional Strickland analysis, and --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Don't we have to go --\ndon't we have to say that this was reasonable?\nMR. MERCER: No. I think what this Court\nsimply needs to say is that it was not objectively\nunreasonable --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course.\nMR. MERCER: -- for the California courts to\ncome out the other way.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't understand\nwhy you keep talking about Strickland. We sent this\ncase back to the Ninth Circuit for further consideration\nin light of Carey v. Musladin. In that case we said\nthat the grant of relief was unreasonable because of the\nlack of holdings from this Court regarding the\npotentially prejudicial effect of spectators' courtroom\nconduct of the kind involved here, which seems to me a\nmuch narrower focus on the level of generality than\nStrickland.\nI would have thought you would have said --\nmaybe you are saying -- that because we don't have a\nprecedent from this Court rejecting the \"nothing to\nlose\" case, that that should be the end of it.\nMR. MERCER: Well, I did not make such an\naggressive argument to this Court that a decision like\nthis could never be unreasonable, but certainly there is\nno case from this Court that has announced such a\nstandard. So --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. The issue is\nnot whether it's unreasonable or not. The issue is\nwhether it's an unreasonable application of -- of\nclearly established Supreme Court law.\nMR. MERCER: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Reasonableness or\nunreasonableness is out of the question. You -- you\nfirst just have to look to Supreme Court law and say, is\nit conceivably an unreasonable application of that. And\nthe -- and the answer to that is we -- we haven't\ndecided the question of whether this is reasonable or\nunreasonable, and therefore, it cannot possibly be an\nunreasonable application of Supreme Court law.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's his argument, not\nthe one you've been making.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's right. That seems\nto me --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You say the standard is\nStrickland.\nMR. MERCER: Well, what I say is that this\nCourt has held that Strickland generally applies to\nalmost all ineffective counsel cases. And certainly\nthis Court has stated it applies in specific type issues\nof conduct. For example, counsel has a duty to conduct\na reasonable investigation; counsel has a duty to\nconsult his client about filing an appeal. But Justice\nScalia is absolutely right, this Court has never said\nanything remotely like the rule applied by the Ninth\nCircuit here.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, they didn't. But\nwhat we're going to discover, I suspect, when we\nactually dig into this record, which is pretty\nextensive, are two things. The first is the California\nCourt of Appeals does not seem to have dealt with the\nparticular issue in front of us. They talked about a\ndue process issue at the end of their paragraph, they\nhave talked about things that are close to it, but they\nnowhere say expressly how they are deciding the question\nof whether there was ineffective assistance of counsel\nfor the reason that he didn't put on this insanity\ndefense. That's going to be our first problem.\nThen I looked to see, I got the record out\nto see, if he raised it, and he didn't. So we have the\nfact that they didn't talk about it, and then we have\nthe fact that of course the Supreme Court of California\nsays just one word, \"Denied.\"\nThen when we discover round two in the Ninth\nCircuit, we are going to discover some language which\nsays: We are not relying on this rule, there is no such\nrule, as a rule of you have to make a defense as a last\nresort. Here's what they say. Instead of that we say,\nforget about that, we were wrong the first time, we\nassume. \"Where the State court has provided an\nadjudication on the merits, that is, it did say denied,\nbut has not explained its underlying reasoning or held\nan evidentiary hearing, we conduct an independent review\nof the record to determine the State court's final\nresolution of the case, whether it was reasonable or\nunreasonable.\"\nSo they say: We did conduct that record\nindependent review. And our conclusion is that it was\nunreasonable, okay? Nothing to do with any special rule\nhere or anything. We just think it was unreasonable.\nAll right; now, what are we supposed to do\nwith this?\nMR. MERCER: I think this Court needs to\ngive full deference to the adjudication of the State\ncourts.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is that deference\ngoing to be? I take it what it would be is that the\nperson, the defendant, would have in his petition --\nwhich we don't actually have -- would have said the\nfacts are thus and so, and since they had no hearing,\nthey would have to take those facts as being thus and\nso.\nMR. MERCER: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And then we would have to\nsay, was it unreasonable of them on the facts as they\nmight have taken them most favorable to the defendant.\nIs that what we're supposed to do? Is it unreasonable\nof them to conclude for the State's favor in light of\nreading these facts as most possible favorable for the\ndefendant? Is that what we should do?\nMR. MERCER: Correct, yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. MERCER: And that's the situation and\nthe circumstance outlined by the California Supreme\nCourt in People v. Duvall, and it's a case and a\nprocedure designed for judicial economy --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then we have to reach this\nhearing issue because we have to say, insofar as the\nhearing reached a different result, we should ignore it\nfor the reason that the statute tells us to consider the\nreasonableness of the State court's decision in light of\nthe facts on the record before it.\nMR. MERCER: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So we have to reach a huge\nnumber of issues which we've never decided.\nMR. MERCER: I actually think that that\nissue is not really properly before this Court.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, then how are we\nsupposed to do it? That's why I raised it.\nMR. MERCER: Based on the State court\nadjudication, a straightforward analysis under 2254(d)\nof the California Supreme Court's legal resolution of\nthis claim.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: We should treat the\ndistrict court proceeding as though it had never\nhappened on the ground that the Ninth Circuit never\nshould have remanded it to the district court, and we\njust take it as though we had a 2254 petition from the\nState supreme court in the district court. And then the\ndistrict court doesn't conduct any hearing; it just\napplies the standard. So that the whole thing about\nclearly erroneous at the district court, that -- that\nshould be out of the case.\nMR. MERCER: That is our primary contention,\nyes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then if we get to that\npoint, I think your argument is as follows. I'm not\nsure. I want you to tell me.\nIf the State court adjudication was -- was\ncontrary to what Justice Stevens' hypo suggested might\nbe the \"total fool\" rule, in other words no one but a\ncomplete nincompoop would have failed to -- to press\nforward with this defense, then we can decide the case\nsimply under Strickland, because Strickland\nunreasonableness is certainly going to cover the total\nfool case.\nBut if we have something less egregious than\nthe total fool case, then we've got to look for more\nprecise Supreme Court precedent, and that's what gets us\ninto the Musladin or Musladin rule.\nMR. MERCER: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And if we get to the\nMusladin sort of level of generality, we do not have any\ndetermination from this Court, any clearly established\nlaw from this Court, that would indicate that the State\ncourt's adjudication or determination was unreasonable\nhere.\nMR. MERCER: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is that your road map?\nMR. MERCER: Yes, it is.\nAnd if there are no further questions, I\nwould like to reserve the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Sevilla.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES M. SEVILLA\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. SEVILLA: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI would like to begin by addressing the\nso-called \"nothing to lose\" rule, which is a fiction\nattributed to Profitt v. Waldron, which -- it does not\nsay that in Profitt v. Waldron. It's a fiction\nattributed to the Ninth Circuit, because the Ninth\nCircuit not only did not say that; they rejected the\nidea that they were relying on a \"nothing to lose\" rule.\nThe Ninth Circuit applied -- well, I might also add that\nin a case called Lowery v. Lewis, which is cited at the\nPetitioner's appendix for cert 94, the Ninth Circuit\nspecifically and in no uncertain terms said it rejected\na \"nothing to lose\" rule.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you reject it as\nwell, I take it --\nMR. SEVILLA: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS -- and concede it is\nan improper -- it is not a basis for ineffective\nassistance that somebody did not pursue a \"nothing to\nlose\" case argument?\nMR. SEVILLA: It -- essentially, because\nit's an irrelevant concern because the decision has to\nbe made on whether counsel's decision, as he faced the\ntrial facts, was objectively reasonable.\nNow, in that calculus if there is nothing to\nlose by going forward, if there is a great benefit to\nachieve by going forward, if he's got a credible\ndefense, as it was determined by the district court at\nthe evidentiary hearing on insanity, then it's\nobjectively unreasonable on the morning of trial on the\nway to court, to, out of a sense of despair or\nhopelessness, subjectively speaking, to decide that:\nI'm going to jettison this defense that's been prepared\nover the year. There was --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well I -- I don't\nunder -- I didn't follow that answer. You're saying if\nhe does have nothing to lose, it is objectively\nunreasonable for him not to go ahead with it?\nMR. SEVILLA: I'm saying that's one of the\nfactors. I'm not saying that's the sole factor,\nbecause, as the case that I cited, Lowery, there was a\nmotion to suppress which attorneys were making in this\ncase. They all lost, and his -- the client in that case\nargued, well, there was nothing to lose in presenting\nthis motion to suppress, and the Ninth Circuit said:\nThat's not the rule; it's under the circumstances\nwhether the performance is objectively unreasonable, so\nwe need to take into consideration the compete --\ncompeting factors.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we have to look\nat this counsel's performance under Strickland, I guess,\nand determine whether it was objectively unreasonable in\nlight of Strickland filtered through Yarborough?\nMR. SEVILLA: Correct. And in -- in that\nregard, the State has argued --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that precisely what we\nhave to decide? Or wouldn't it be whether it would be\nunreasonable for the State court not to come to that\nconclusion, which is one step removed?\nMR. SEVILLA: It would be one step removed\nwere it not for the fact that there was an evidentiary\nhearing which resolved facts that should have been\nresolved in the State court. Appellant filed a separate\npetition in the court of appeal in California, filed the\nsame petition in the California Supreme Court, asked --\nfirst argued up front that this was unreasonable\nperformance under Strickland, and then said if the court\ndisagrees, then it ought to be remanded to a referee for\nfact development.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So -- so the usual test\nthat the State court has to be affirmed unless it's\nunreasonable application of Supreme Court law is altered\nwhen the State court has not had an evidentiary hearing\nthat the Federal habeas court believes should have been\nheld?\nMR. SEVILLA: And holds it. But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How do you get that out of\nthe statute? I don't understand it; it makes no --\nMR. SEVILLA: Well, there's a hole in the\nstatute, there's no question about it, under 2254(d)(1).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. SEVILLA: When you have the -- the\nstatute requiring the application of, or nonapplication\nof law contrary to the United States Supreme Court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. SEVILLA: -- or an unreasonable\napplication thereof, what happens when that issue really\ncannot be decided without an evidentiary hearing under\nStrickland?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you're saying --\nthe need for the evidentiary hearing, as I understand\nit, was raised by you in the following way. You said to\nthe California Supreme Court: There is on the face of\nthe papers filed here a violation of Strickland and a --\nor a misapplication of Strickland in -- in the way the\nCalifornia trial court came out; but if you do not find\na facial violation of Strickland based on these papers,\nthen you should remand for an evidentiary hearing. And\nit doesn't seem to me that that follows at all.\nIf there's no Strickland error, that seems\nto me a -- a -- an odd premise to say you ought to\nremand for a hearing. Aren't you under an obligation to\nspecify factual issues that -- specifically that need to\nbe developed, before you would make out a case for\nsaying they were in error in not holding the evidentiary\nhearing?\nMR. SEVILLA: Well, we argued that because\nMr. Wager, defense counsel, presented a declaration\nwhich was contradicted by other declarations as to the\nreason he gave up this defense, we argued it was\nobjectively unreasonable if the court -- the State court\ntook all of the intendants in favor of our declaration\nand Mr. Wager did not really address the reasons for\ngiving up the defense, he just said, I felt it was\nhopeless.\nIt took the evidentiary hearing to determine\nwhy he felt it was hopeless. So we argued that on the\nface of it it is Strickland error. If the court\ndisagrees, then we're entitled to an evidentiary hearing\nto determine --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you're saying that you\nspecified the evidentiary issues that you wanted to\ndevelop?\nMR. SEVILLA: What we specified is why his\nrationale was unreasonable.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, with that, I'm just\nasking you --\nMR. SEVILLA: And we --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm asking you -- I'm\nthrowing you a softball.\nMR. SEVILLA: Right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Are you saying that that\nwas, in effect, an adequate way to tell the California\nSupreme Court that these are the issues that we want to\ndevelop in an evidentiary hearing that aren't\nsufficiently developed in the documents? Is that your\nposition?\nMR. SEVILLA: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But there is no hole in the\nstatute. What it says to do, quite explicitly, is it\nsays that you have to see whether the State court\ndecision was unreasonable in light of the evidence\npresented in the State court. So it tells us what to\ndo. It says, look at the evidence in the State court,\nand like any other instance where there is no hearing,\nevery day of the week, judges refuse to give a hearing.\nNow, when they do that, they have to assume the facts in\nfavor of the losing party. So the question is, assuming\nthe facts in favor of your client, was the decision that\nhe loses unreasonable?\nMR. SEVILLA: We argued yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And you said yes. Is there\nany finding on that in the Federal court? No.\nMR. SEVILLA: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, that's --\nthat's why I don't know how to proceed because it seems\nto me to decide that question just as I said it. When I\nsaid it, I don't think what I said is clear in the law\nof this statute. There are two sides to it. We just\nhad a case where there were many briefs on this\nquestion. So I'm slightly uncertain what to do.\nMR. SEVILLA: Was that Bell v. Kelly?\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's a good one.\nMR. SEVILLA: I think it was, and the Court\ndismissed as improvidently granted, and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. What do you\nrely on for the proposition that if -- if you deny a\nhearing, all of the facts for which the hearing was\ndemanded have to be assumed in favor of the party who\nasked for the hearing?\nMR. SEVILLA: That's California law.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's the law of the\nFederal Government, I would have thought.\nMR. SEVILLA: That is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's summary judgment law.\nMR. SEVILLA: In order to deny relief, one\nhas to -- the court has to presume the adequacy of the\nshowing, or the truth of the showing made by the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, but that can't be.\nWhat if I deny the hearing because there are ample facts\nthat show what the situation was, and a hearing would in\nmy view be absolutely redundant? And therefore all of\nthe facts that support the other side have to be washed\nout simply because I've denied a hearing?\nMR. SEVILLA: No. We're not making any\nclaim that there has to be a hearing in every Federal\ncase when there is an argument that could be deemed on\nits face cumulative evidence.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I wasn't addressing that.\nI was addressing the proposition that when you deny a\nhearing, all of the facts for which you demanded the\nhearing have to be assumed in your favor. I -- it seems\nto be --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's my fault. I'm\nreferring by shorthand to a Rule 56 summary judgment\ntype standard. All those facts are assumed on your side\nin which they're material, and there has to be in the\nevidence a reasonable basis for dispute.\nMR. SEVILLA: I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's my mistaken refusal\nto -- I should have said Rule 56.\nMR. SEVILLA: Well, it's -- it also is\nCalifornia law, and I believe it is habeas corpus law,\nthat when the petitioner files a petition and attaches\ndeclarations, in order to deny those, assuming that the\ntruth of those declarations is presumed in order to\nevaluate the prima facie case -- for example, in this\ncase, in Strickland, that if that can't be resolved\nwithout a hearing, the hearing should be held. And the\ncourt of appeal on the first go-around held exactly\nthat. The court said there are competing reasons here\nwhy the defense counsel waived this defense on the\nmorning --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, talking\nabout -- in Strickland -- right here. In Strickland, we\nsaid that if a decision by counsel is made upon, quote,\n\"thorough investigation,\" it is, quote, \"virtually\nunchallengeable.\" Now, which of these facts in the\nPetitioner's brief is wrong: That Wager retained eight\nexpert doctors to evaluate Mirzayance's mental health;\nhe retained jury consultants; he conducted a mock trial\nin which he presented mental health defenses to two\njuries; he hired a private investigator to interview\nfriends and associates; he consulted with Mirzayance's\nparents and their attorneys; he discussed the case with\na retained expert doctor after decision and his\nco-counsel?\nNow, that sounds like pretty thorough\ninvestigation of the defense you say he should have\nraised.\nMR. SEVILLA: Well, there are a couple of\nproblems with -- all of that is true. I might quibble\nwith one, but what -- Mr. Wager was operating under a\nfundamental misunderstanding of California law. All of\nthat was ready to go, to present. He had a great not-\nguilty-by-reason-of-insanity case supported by lay\ntestimony, childhood history, and these psychiatric\nopinions of very formidable experts. But he had a\nfundamental error that was only revealed at the\nevidentiary hearing in the understanding of California\nlaw. He said -- and he said this six times at the\nevidentiary hearing -- he said that when a jury has\nfound the defendant has maturely and meaningfully\ndeliberated, that that means they found the equivalent\nof wrongfulness. That is absolutely wrong. He was\nquoting from a statute that was repealed in 1982, when\nCalifornia had a major revision of its statutes and\nmoved mental health concepts --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So all the points\nthat your friend began with, which shows his conscious\ndeliberation, his knowledge not only about how to go\nabout killing somebody, but also guilt, the recognition\nof the wrongfulness of what he had done -- all that\nunder California law doesn't enter into a consideration\nof insanity?\nMR. SEVILLA: Surely it enters into the\nconsideration, and every one of the experts considered\nprecisely that evidence, which was for the most part\nafter-the-fact evidence. And as the State's doctor --\nand, again, this came out at the evidentiary hearing\nbecause it's certainly not discovered in the State\ndoctor's report that was submitted. The State doctor,\nDr. Anderson, stated at the trial in Federal court that,\nyes, he was aware of the consciousness-of-guilt evidence\nthat came about mostly after the event, but that did not\nspeak to his intent, his mental state at the time of the\noffense. And he stated, which was a great surprise in\nthe Federal evidentiary hearing, that he believed Mr.\nMirzayance was, because of the psychosis, feeling that\nhe was justified --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand that,\nbut counsel here at the time retained eight expert\ndoctors to evaluate his mental health. He conducted the\nmock jury trial. He interviewed the parents. He hired\nan investigator to interview friends. What you're\nsaying is, well, here's -- if he had hired a ninth\nexpert, he might have come out differently. That sounds\nlike a thorough investigation under Strickland.\nMR. SEVILLA: It was a thorough\ninvestigation. But this case -- this Court has said, in\nTerry Williams, counsel has a duty to investigate and\nproffer mitigation evidence in a capital case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So isn't that --\naren't you back to the \"nothing to lose\" argument? He\nconducted this investigation, which under Strickland we\nsaid makes the decision virtually unchallengeable, and\nyou're saying, well, he has an obligation to proffer it.\nMR. SEVILLA: He had an obligation to\nproffer it because he was operating on a fundamental\nmisunderstanding of California law.\nJUSTICE ALITO: You say that repeatedly, but\nwhat is there to show that he misunderstood, that he\nmisunderstood California law, as opposed to making a\npractical calculation about how juries would look at\nthis evidence, having found -- having heard the evidence\nof premeditation and having found premeditation, even\nthough that doesn't decide the NGI issue, as a matter of\nlaw. As a practical matter, it makes it quite unlikely\nthat they're going to accept the NGI defense. Where --\nand you say that repeatedly.\nMR. SEVILLA: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Where in the record does it\nshow that he misunderstood the law, as opposed to making\na practical evaluation of what the jury was likely to\ndo?\nMR. SEVILLA: Well, I will -- I could rattle\noff page numbers from where he said that the jury\nfinding of premeditation and deliberation was the\nfunctional equivalent of a finding of sanity. That is\nabsolutely not true. Here's the quote --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: He didn't use the word\n\"functional equivalent\" in the portions I read. Maybe\nyou can correct me if I'm wrong about that.\nMR. SEVILLA: He did not say \"the functional\nequivalent.\" He said --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And he told the trial\njudge, \"I've got an uphill\" --\nMR. SEVILLA: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- almost perpendicular.\nAnd he had -- each and every one of those experts in\ntheir affidavits, in their reports, had said that he\ndidn't have deliberation or premeditation. They were\ngetting ready for that. And he felt that this would be\ndevastating cross-examination material because the jury\nhad already found the opposite -- they had already\ndisbelieved the expert on this point.\nNow, it's true, it's true, that knowledge of\nwrongfulness is probably slightly more extensive than\npremeditation. But based on the defense that he was\ngoing to present -- he didn't know what he was doing at\nthis time -- he had a very, very difficult obstacle to\novercome.\nMR. SEVILLA: Well, that -- that's a\nchallenge that faces every criminal defense attorney in\n-- a case when you have a -- a credible defense like\nthis. There -- there are going to be challenges to that\nby vigorous, trained prosecutors.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't there something on\nthe other side? You seem to present this as a case, but\ncounsel did a careful job, and then he lost faith. He\nlost hope, and so he acted irrationally.\nBut wasn't there on the other side\nconsideration of the sentence that he was going to get,\nand might not a -- a lawyer perfectly rationally think:\nIf I give up this defense, it is just going to waste\neverybody's time. The judge is going to give me the\nbenefit of -- of having done that in the sentence, in\ngiving a lower sentence, in giving -- making the\nsentences on the multiple offenses concurrent rather\nthan consecutive.\nMR. SEVILLA: Well, if there had been a\ntactical purpose such as that, that would have been an\ninteresting fact to add to the calculus here, but he\nabsolutely denied there was any benefit.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, maybe -- maybe he\ndid, but when we come to judge prejudice, don't we have\nto judge prejudice by considering exactly what Justice\nGinsburg just said? In other words, our standard, the\n-- the standard -- No. 1, the standard for Strickland\nprejudice is -- is an objective -- I mean the standard\nfor -- for -- of -- of performance is an objective\nstandard. And the standard for prejudice has got to be\nan objective standard, too.\nAnd even though he said, I didn't do this\nfor tactical reasons, if a -- if a sound lawyer would\nhave entertained exactly the tactical reason that\nJustice Ginsburg just outlined, isn't that crucial to\nthe determination of prejudice?\nMR. SEVILLA: Well, it -- it may well be if\nthere was a --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, shouldn't that be?\nMR. SEVILLA: -- if there was a possibility\nthat there could be any difference whatsoever at\nsentencing. But he testified, well, what was going to\nhappen to Mr. Mirzayance if he were to -- he was going\nto get 25 or 29 to life, which is exactly what happened.\nSo there was no --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: How did he know that?\nMR. SEVILLA: How did he know that? Because\nif you -- he had already been convicted of first-degree\nmurder, which --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but the judge hadn't\nsentenced him yet.\nMR. SEVILLA: Correct, but under California\nlaw there is a mandatory prison sentence for the use of\na gun, so -- and the sentence for first-degree murder is\n25 to life.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So you are saying the\njudge had no discretion whatsoever?\nMR. SEVILLA: That is correct. So,\ntherefore --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Twenty-five -- 25, 26, 27,\n28, he has 25 years worth of discretion, doesn't he?\nMR. SEVILLA: No, no. It's a minimum\nmandatory 25 to life.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But couldn't he also give\nlife. He could also give the maximum, which was life,\ncouldn't he, or am I wrong?\nMR. SEVILLA: He -- he could give 25 to --\nthe -- the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You are saying the terms of\nthe sentence had to be 25 to life?\nMR. SEVILLA: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So there was no discretion\non the trial judge's part.\nMR. SEVILLA: Correct. Correct. And this\n-- the defense counsel said as much when answering the\nquestion as to whether there was any possible benefit.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So he's got nothing\nto lose?\nMR. SEVILLA: He's got nothing to lose and\nsomething to gain. There was no benefit in taking the\n-- the action that he took in waiving this defense,\nwhich was credible. He was prepared to present it until\nthe --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess that gets me\nback to what -- what I thought the case was postured in,\nwhich is whether or not a case from this Court clearly\nestablishes when you have nothing to lose, you've got to\ngo ahead and present the defense, or it's a violation of\nStrickland. And what case is that?\nMR. SEVILLA: There is no case that this\nCourt has so pronounced. And we are not arguing for\nthat standard, nor should we have to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I -- I\nunderstood your responses to the various questions here\nto, in effect, be arguing for that standard. You are\nsaying, look, he was going to get the same sentence\nanyway. You know, all -- all your answers sound to me\nlike nothing to lose.\nMR. SEVILLA: Well, they're all part of the\ncalculus of reasonable performance. Certainly, the fact\nthat there is nothing to lose, that he is going to get\nan automatic 25-year minimum sentence, that he is -- on\nthe other hand, he's got a credible defense for which\nthere is absolutely no benefit in giving up, and -- and\nthen he decides for reasons --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He made a\ndetermination -- he made a determination after a\nthorough investigation of the various points I went\nthrough with you earlier that it was not a credible\ndefense. Now, maybe that was reasonable or\nunreasonable, but it doesn't seem to me to be -- under\nStrickland we said it is virtually unchallengeable, and\nit doesn't seem to me to be objectively unreasonable in\nlight of clearly established law from this Court.\nMR. SEVILLA: Well, the -- the -- this Court\nhas said that errors of misunderstanding -- well, the\nCourt has said that failure to fact-investigate can be a\nbasis for objectively unreasonable performance. The\nsame is true with failure to legally investigate what's\nthe law governing your case.\nAnd he stated on six occasions that the fact\nthat the jury, quote, \"had already found Mirzayance\nguilty of first-degree murder,\" and, whether they knew\nit or not, under the facts of this case legally sane,\nwell, then, the question is: Well, how do you make that\ndetermination? By the way, he said the equivalent of\nthat six times during the year.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't -- I didn't take\nthat to mean under California law, since the jury found\nthe one, it has to find the other. He wasn't making\nthat argument. He was saying any jury that found that\nthis was done intentionally, that this was done, you\nknow, with -- with planning, with -- with cover-up and\nwhat not, that jury is not going to find that he was\ncrazy. That's all he was saying, and -- and that seems\nto me entirely reasonable.\nMR. SEVILLA: Well -- well, I -- that might\nbe the case if he did not misunderstand California law.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's hard for me to\nbelieve that he didn't. He -- he has tried a hundred\ncases. He had moot or mock -- mock trials where he was\nasking the experts these questions with the co-counsel.\nAnd you want us to say that he didn't understand the\nlaw? And there is no -- there is no finding to that\neffect. There's no finding to that effect: That he did\nnot understand the law by the magistrate.\nMR. SEVILLA: Well, the circuit --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: By the magistrate, there\nwas no finding to that effect.\nMR. SEVILLA: That's correct, because the\nmagistrate did really not make a finding on prong one.\nThe -- the magistrate misapprehended the intention of\nthe circuit's first remand by thinking that it had\nmandated a nothing-to-lose rule. And if there was\nnothing to lose, it was prong one ineffectiveness, so\nthere was no need to make a finding. So we're left\nwithout a finding.\nBut the circuit on -- on its second and\nthird opinion noted that his concept of premeditation\nand deliberation as having mental-health concepts was\nwrong because of the 1982 amendment to the statutes,\nwhich removed many of the mental-health concepts and --\nand put them over into the insanity phase. And so when\nhe said to the court at the hearing, Mr. Mirzayance --\nafter the jury found him maturely and meaningfully\ndeliberated, that's language that was eliminated in --\nin 1982, and that is the mental-health concept.\nAnd -- and this point is very important to\nthis argument. When he was arguing to the jury, he said\nhe can't premeditate and deliberate because he's\nmentally ill. He's mentally diseased. And he was cut\noff by the prosecutor and the court who gave an\ninstruction that said -- 853 of the trial transcript,\nsaying the fact that Mr. Mirzayance may have deliberated\nfor irrational reasons brought on by mental disease is\nnot a defense to this case. His reasons can be\nirrational in deliberating.\nAnd that should have tipped him off that\nthis jury was precluded from taking the psychiatric\ntestimony -- the psychological testimony of the one\nwitness at the guilt phase and -- and deeming that a\nnegation of any ability to win on a wrongfulness\nstandard. And -- and I might also add --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But they didn't -- they\ndidn't strike the experts' testimony. The experts\ntestified at some length, the -- the psychiatrist.\nMR. SEVILLA: He did.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So that was relevant to\npremeditation and deliberation, and the jury did\nconsider what the mental health expert said.\nMR. SEVILLA: They did consider what he\nsaid, but they were precluded from channeling that into\na defense to premedication and deliberation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what about -- what do\nyou do with the last sentence of the supreme -- of the\nCalifornia Court of Appeals' opinion? \"None of the\nexculpatory evidence defendant recites, including\nevidence of his mental disorder, was reasonably likely\nto persuade a jury that defendant did not premeditate\nand deliberate the killing.\" And from that they\nconclude that there is no reasonable probability that,\nbut for the errors, a different verdict would have been\nreached, i.e., that it does not satisfy the second part\nof Strickland.\nMR. SEVILLA: And -- and you were reading\nfrom the California Court of Appeals --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I was just reading from the\nCalifornia court of Appeals. Because I look at that. I\nthink when I go back and see what was the evidence in\nfront of them, I am going to find all of these -- all of\nthese things. Not the last part by the way, not -- not\nthe part about the counsel admitting he was wrong or\nwhatever this argument we are having. We won't find\nthat, but we'll find everything else there.\nAnd so they're using that as the basis to\nsay there was no prejudice, and now I guess that the\nNinth Circuit and the Federal courts would have to defer\nto that finding on prejudice. Now, what's your response\nto that?\nMR. SEVILLA: Well, the California Court of\nAppeals did not have before them the evidence that came\nin by way of petition, which was all of the psychiatric\nopinions of the forensic psychiatrists who gave\ndeclarations saying that Mr. Mirzayance was insane at\nthe time of the homicide. That is not within the court\nof appeal opinion because the court of appeal opinion is\non the four corners of the record, and this was\ncollateral to that.\nSo any statement along those lines did not\nencompass the most powerful evidence that was presented,\nwhich would have been all of the psychiatric opinion\ntestimony about his mental state at the time of the\noffense.\nAnd then, of course, we know that at the\nfederal evidentiary hearing, this defense was found\ncredible, and one of the state doctors came over to the\ndefense side and testified that Mirzayance did not\nunderstand wrongfulness at the time of the homicide\nbecause of the psychosis. And this doctor made an\nerror, and its clear from the record at the evidentiary\nhearing, he had an error in his understanding of the NGI\ntest in California. He thought if you met prong one you\nunderstood the nature and quality of the act, you were\nsane, and he never went to wrongfulness.\nBut when he was asked by the State at this\nhearing, well, what about his ability to understand\nwrongfulness, and the doctor said he didn't understand\nwrongfulness.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Please correct me if I'm\nwrong, but as a general rule psychiatrists don't --\ndon't testify as to the ultimate standard. They testify\nas to the condition and -- and the symptoms of -- of the\ndefendant, and then the jury makes that conclusion.\nMR. SEVILLA: In California in 1982, there\nwas a statutory amendment which prohibited forensic\nexperts from testifying to opinions at the guilt phase,\nso that -- on legal issues like premeditation,\ndeliberation, so they could not, Dr. Satz could not\ntestify at the guilt phase on premeditation and\ndeliberation. At the insanity phase, they absolutely\ncan testify as to whether he was sane or not.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Had Wager ever\nrepresented a defendant who pled NGI?\nMR. SEVILLA: No. He testified this was his\nfirst NGI defense.\nSpeaking to -- I think, Justice Kennedy, you\nraised the issue about couldn't these -- in the\nprejudice calculus, couldn't these psychiatrists have\nbeen impeached with the fact that they found no\npremeditation and deliberation? Well, California\nstatute under Penal Code section 28 prohibits their\nopinion on premeditation and deliberation at the guilt\nphase where the issue is premeditation and deliberation.\nSo, I can't understand how a court would let in their\nopinions on premeditation and deliberation when there's\na totally separate issue of insanity at the insanity\nphase.\nIt's -- if it's irrelevant or prohibited at\nthe guilt phase, where premeditation is the issue, it's\nsurely going to be irrelevant at the NGI phase, where\nit's not an issue, and we have a totally different\nstandard. As the courts of California have said, one\ncan be guilty of first degree murder and be insane.\nThat's -- that's clear.\nSo, in this case, we have an attorney who,\nfor whatever reasons, based on a subjective sense of\nhopelessness, gave up his client's only and best\ndefense, a defense that was found credible at the\nfederal evidentiary hearing. Once -- once that defense\nis found credible, that bespeaks of the unreasonableness\nof counsel giving it up. It's a credible defense, it's\nthe only defense available to him, and counsel gave it\nup for no tactical benefit.\nThere was no upside to this. There was a\nclear downside to it, because it consigned his client to\n29 years to life as opposed to the possibility of\ntreatment in a mental hospital, and potentially, upon\nthe restoration of sanity, potential relief -- release\nif he could prove his restoration.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Has he served his time so\nfar in a regular institution?\nMR. SEVILLA: Yes, he has. He is in Mule\nCreek State Prison just south of Stockton, California,\nand --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that the special -- he\nmade a request for a particular prison. Is that the\none?\nMR. SEVILLA: I don't think so. I don't\nbelieve -- I think at the sentencing hearing, the trial\njudge did not do anything special except sentence him to\nprison? Although both -- in terms of the bona fides of\nhis disease, both the prosecutor and the judge at the\ntime of the sentencing said he was clearly a mentally\ndiseased person. So that -- this -- this bespeaks back\nto the credibility of the defense which was established\nby the mental disease evidence which stemmed from\nchildhood.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. SEVILLA: Thank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Mercer, you have\nfour minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN E. MERCER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. MERCER: Just a couple of points I would\nlike to make briefly to clarify a couple things.\nFirst off, there was no finding that\nAttorney Wager misunderstood California law or somehow\nwas under the impression that a finding of first degree\nmurder was legally precluded a finding of NGI. He\nargued at the State trial that there's no question that\nan insane person can deliberate, and surely while the\njury's verdict was as devastating under the facts of\nthis case, he didn't close up his books and go home.\nHe told the trial judge, we need to reassess\nthis, I need to decide who I'm going to call, I need to\nconsult with my doctors and my co-counsel and decide\nwhat we're going to do.\nAnd as the district court found here, and as\nWager stated in the State court declaration, there was\nno final decision made until the morning of trial when\nthe parents expressed a profound reluctance to assist\ntheir son. And this was, in fact, his first NGI\ndefense, but as Mirzayance's family attorney stated in\nhis State court declaration, Attorney Wager was a\nten-year expert on mental health and sanity issues with\nthe Los Angeles District Attorney's Office. He had\ntried more than a hundred trials. He was the expert.\nHe had done his homework here. He knew what he had to\npresent. He did not make a rash decision. He consulted\nwith co-counsel, and concluded reasonably under his\nprofessional valuation that the defense could not meet\nits affirmative burden of proof here.\nThe second thing I would like to clarify on\nJustice Ginsburg's point, there was some sentencing\ndiscretion left here. It's correct that Wager in\nhindsight said, well, perhaps there was nothing to lose.\nBut he argued to the sentencing judge the very fact that\nhis client knew the wrongfulness of his actions and was\nso remorseful should entitle him to a lesser sentence on\nthe weapons enhancement.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What discretion did the\njudge have?\nMR. MERCER: The -- that the -- the\nsentencing judge could have imposed a high, middle or\nlow-term for the weapons enhancement. The underlying\nsentence was 25 to life, my friend is correct, it's set\nby statute. But he had discretion on sentence\nenhancement, and he was convinced that Mirzayance was\nremorseful, and gave him a mid-term instead of a\nhigh-term, despite the fact.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there was also\nsomething about the revocation? There were three\nrevocations involved, I thought, two years on each.\nMR. MERCER: I don't believe that's correct.\nI think it was a straightforward 25 years to life\nsentence plus a weapons enhancement of four years added\non.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You keep saying 29 years.\nIs it 29 years or is that just a misprint --\nMR. MERCER: It's -- the aggregate sentence\nis 25 -- excuse me. The aggregate sentence is 29 years\nto life. It's 25 years to life for the first degree\nmurder, plus four years for the weapons enhancement in\nthis term, a mid-term, because Wager successfully argued\nthat his client was remorseful.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What would he have\ngotten in the high term?\nMR. MERCER: I believe that it was -- I\nbelieve that it was six years as opposed to four. It\nmay have been eight as opposed to four. I don't know.\nThat's not discussed in the State court record.\nAnd finally, Mr. Mirzayance concedes that\n\"nothing to lose\" would be an inappropriate new rule by\nthis Court. He no longer calls it that. He doesn't --\nhe disagrees with the dissent view on this. What he\ncalls it is this: This is the rule, in his own\ndescription, at page 30 of his brief, how the Ninth\nCircuit granted relief here. Excuse me, I see my time\nis expired.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why don't you --\nMR. MERCER: That the decision fairly read\nstates only that counsel has a duty to present\nsubstantial viable defense where there was an objective\nprospect for success and no strategic or other benefit\nabandoning it. This Court has never held such a rule to\nbind the states.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
