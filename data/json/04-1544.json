        "content": "(11:13 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in 04-1544, Vickie Lynn Marshall v. E. Pierce\nMarshall.\nMr. Richland.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. RICHLAND\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. RICHLAND: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis is a bankruptcy case, but it is a\nbankruptcy case in which the Ninth Circuit has made --\ncome to the extraordinary conclusion that the Federal\nbankruptcy court has no jurisdiction over the chief\nassets of the bankruptcy estate. That asset, a -- a\ntort cause of action, was to be the main source of the\npayment to the creditors. And the Ninth Circuit came\nto this conclusion because it gave a very broad\ninterpretation of the so-called probate exception to\nFederal jurisdiction.\nAs I will explain, the Federal bankruptcy\njurisdiction statutes are incompatible with the concept\nof having adopted a probate exception to Federal\njurisdiction, particularly to Federal bankruptcy\njurisdiction.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Any exception whatever.\nMR. RICHLAND: That's correct, Your Honor.\nThere is no exception to that. The -- the statute\nitself is structured in such a way that its\njurisdiction of the bankruptcy court depends on the\nrelationship of the matter to the bankruptcy estate.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So if -- if the contention\nin the -- in the bankruptcy proceeding is that the will\nwhich has been probated by the State probate court is,\nin fact, not the true will and that under the true\nwill, the bankruptcy estate would get money, you think\nthe bankruptcy court would -- would have jurisdiction\nto probate the will.\nMR. RICHLAND: Yes, Your Honor. Now, the\nquestion is, of course, that's an attack on a probated\nwill, I believe, and I think that this Court's\njurisprudence also supports the notion that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right. Well, I'm\nwilling to -- to move it back. I mean, that's --\nthat's even harder for you. But let's assume that the\nwill is in probate but has not yet been probated. Do\nyou think the bankruptcy court has jurisdiction to\ndecide which will is the true will?\nMR. RICHLAND: Well, the -- the bankruptcy\njurisdiction statute states that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes or no.\nMR. RICHLAND: The answer is yes, it does--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right.\nMR. RICHLAND: -- and it must have that power\nto be able to do so because the bankruptcy jurisdiction\nstatute states that the court has jurisdiction, in rem\njurisdiction, exclusive in rem jurisdiction --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What if the rem --\nMR. RICHLAND: -- over all assets of the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- what if the rem is in\nanother court before the bankruptcy begins? What if\nthe res is within -- is in another court?\nMR. RICHLAND: Yes, yes, Justice Ginsburg.\n28 U.S.C., section 1334(e) states the bankruptcy court\nshall have exclusive jurisdiction, in rem jurisdiction,\nover the bankruptcy estate, and that has been\ninterpreted by the courts as meaning that it has\nparamount jurisdiction in the sense that the normal in\ncustodia legis doctrine does not apply where it is a\nbankruptcy court case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So even -- even if\nproperty is in the custody of another court in the\nprobate proceeding and the bankruptcy proceeding comes\nlater, the bankruptcy proceeding would sweep whatever\nassets are before the probate court into the\nbankruptcy.\nMR. RICHLAND: That -- that is correct, Your\nHonor, and there have been courts that have held that\nwith respect --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you want to stand on this\nposition, Mr. Richland, or do you have a lesser\nposition --\nMR. RICHLAND: Well, it's certainly not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that -- that might cause\nyou to win? Because --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. RICHLAND: Well, it certainly is not\nnecessary, of course, to -- to -- for us to prevail in\nthis case. However, I think it is an important\nprinciple to interpret the -- the bankruptcy\njurisdiction statute, look at the language of that\nstatute, and determine what Congress intended from\nthat. And -- and I think it also is a dangerous thing\nto get into, implying exceptions into that statute.\nBut -- but let me state this. Obviously, in\nthis case we have an action, the -- the in rem\njurisdiction of the bankruptcy court over the chosen\naction, that is -- is miles away from the probate of --\nof a will. The particular cause of action involved\nhere was an interference with an inter vivos gift. And\nI think it's important to realize that that was\nintended to be a gift that would be complete during the\nlifetime of the decedent. That fact means that this\ncase really has almost nothing to do with probate or\nprobate jurisdiction.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you did file a\nchallenge to the probate of the will, didn't you, in\nTexas?\nMR. RICHLAND: There was a challenge filed to\nthe probate of the will originally by the -- the\nbrother of the respondent in this case, and eventually\nyes, our client did join that some years later after it\nwas first filed. So that would have been an\nalternative.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And wasn't the ground\nfor that that it would be inconsistent with the inter\nvivos trust that you are asserting in the bankruptcy\ncourt proceeding?\nMR. RICHLAND: No, that was not the case,\nYour Honor. The -- the grounds for that was the belief\nthat there had been undue influence with respect to the\nwill. But the inter vivos gift claim -- a tortious\ninterference with inter vivos gift claim -- that was\nadded only many years later in the year 2000. That was\n3 years, 3 and a half years after that same action was\npending in the bankruptcy court. And the only reason\nit was raised at that time was that respondent went to\nthe Federal court and said -- and interposed the\nprobate exception and argued at that time there is no\njurisdiction here. Therefore, out of an excess of\ncaution, our client went to the Texas probate court and\nsaid, well, I will -- I will make this -- this claim\nhere.\nIn fact, once there was success in the\nbankruptcy court and the bankruptcy court said, now I\nhave made a determination on that claim, our client did\ndismiss that claim and dismissed all affirmative claims\nwith respect to the probate estate.\nI think the important thing to realize here,\nwith respect to both this particular claim and with\nrespect to the bankruptcy jurisdiction statute in\nparticular, is that the -- that the breadth of the --\nwhat that statute does is, it -- it announces that\nrather than having jurisdictional preclusions, there\nwill be preclusions based on abstention. It has broad\nabstention provisions in section 1334(c), and indeed\nsection 1334(c)(2), which is the mandatory abstention\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: You like this -- apparently\nyou like this argument, although you say you're miles\naway from probate. Well, if you want to get into that\nargument, I guess the strongest argument against\nkeeping it -- for keeping it is bankruptcy\njurisdictional statutes shouldn't be interpreted\ndifferently than diversity jurisdiction or any other\nstatute, and Markham at least recognizes that there is\nsuch a thing as the probate exception and that Congress\nimplicitly adopted it, just as they did the domestic\nrelations exception. Therefore, if we are going to\nfind for you on this ground, we'd have to go back and\noverrule that case and a lot of other water that's\nflowed over -- under the bridge or wherever the water\nflows.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: And we ought to take what's\ngiven as given, whatever the true meaning of\necclesiastical courts having jurisdiction over certain\nprobate matters or not in the 18th century.\nMR. RICHLAND: Well, of course, if one looks\nat 1334(c)(2), one sees that Congress itself\ncontemplated that there would bankruptcy jurisdiction\nunder circumstances where there was no diversity\njurisdiction and when there was no Federal question\njurisdiction. So it -- it certainly is true that\nrolled into the whole notion of mandatory abstention is\nthe possibility that the bankruptcy court will have\nbefore it matters over which there would be no\ndiversity jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you could say the same\nthing about diversity jurisdiction, that Congress\ncontemplated that there would be diversity jurisdiction\nwhere there was no bankruptcy jurisdiction and no\nFederal question jurisdiction. I mean, I don't see\nwhat that proves.\nMR. RICHLAND: Well, excuse me, Justice\nScalia, but what I think it does prove is that when\nCongress enacted in 1978 the rather comprehensive\nchange that it made to the bankruptcy statutes, that it\nintended to exercise as broad a jurisdiction as\npossible so that the bankruptcy courts would be able to\ncontrol the bankruptcy estate and make determinations\nas to how the creditors could best be protected.\nLet me -- let -- yes. I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm just saying no more so\nthan -- than when Congress enacted diversity\njurisdiction. It intended it to apply, you know,\nuniformly.\nMR. RICHLAND: To -- to apply very broadly\naccording to its terms.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. RICHLAND: And, of course, this Court in\n-- first in Lear v. Armstrong said, yes, this applies\nvery broadly. However, there is an exception and the\nexception is purely the probate of a will -- the\nprobate of a will and that alone. And this Court has\nreally hewn very closely to that very narrow limitation\nsince that point in time.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's true.\nMR. RICHLAND: I do think that it's\nimportant, however, to realize that if one examines\nthis Court's probate exception jurisdiction over the\nyears, it has consistently determined that the -- the\nnarrowness of that exception must be confirmed, and as\nlate as the Markham case, this Court has held that --\nthat Federal courts have jurisdiction to decide all\nkinds of issues with respect to wills, all kinds of\nissues with respect to trusts. Certainly this Court\nhas said that it can determine questions such as how to\ninterpret the provision of a will. It has even held\nthat Federal courts can determine whether a will is\ninvalid. It can make that determination if the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But none -- none of this has\nto be done for you to win this case, does it?\nMR. RICHLAND: You are absolutely correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then I -- I wish we'd stick\nto this case.\nMR. RICHLAND: Well, I'm happy to do that,\nYour Honor. This case is an outlier. I believe that\nis true. This case is so far from the potential of any\nprobate exception that, although I felt that it was\nimportant to be able to explicate the -- the principles\ninvolved here, I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You want to look moderate.\nMR. RICHLAND: Oh --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Does this case involve\nanything more than the enforcement of an in personam\ntort judgment if you are to win?\nMR. RICHLAND: It -- it would not. That is\nall that's involved.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it did involve, at\nleast the bankruptcy court thought, the judgment\ninvalidating the inter vivos trust. Was that necessary\nto the decision? Or am I -- correct me if I'm --\nMR. RICHLAND: I -- I don't believe --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- correct me if I'm wrong\nabout that.\nMR. RICHLAND: That is -- that is incorrect,\nJustice Kennedy. It did not invalidate the inter vivos\ntrust. What it held was that as part of the evidence\nthat it was considering, in terms of the intent, the\ndonative intent, that one portion of that inter vivos\ntrust, an amendment to it, had been forged, but it did\nnot invalidate it. In fact, it -- it expressly held\nthat the -- the inter vivos trust is valid, and that\nwas a basis for its conclusion that, indeed, this\nparticular claim was also valid. This claim was a\ncause of action for interference with an inter vivos\ngift.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I guess what you're going to\nhear in 5-10 minutes --\nMR. RICHLAND: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- you might as well deal\nwith it now --\nMR. RICHLAND: Yes. Why not?\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- is that the inter vivos\n-- a -- a claim for a -- the Texas tort of interference\nwith inter vivos gift, according to Texas law, must be\nbrought at the time of the probate proceeding. And for\nthat reason, it is bound up with probate, and for that\nreason, they didn't have jurisdiction.\nMR. RICHLAND: Well, A -- A, we do not\ninterpret Texas law as so providing.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, let's\nsuppose you're --\nMR. RICHLAND: But -- but assuming --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- suppose they're right\nabout their interpretation.\nMR. RICHLAND: Assuming that they're right\nfor that -- by their interpretation, this Court has\nrepeatedly said that it -- that a -- a State court\ncannot -- by simply assigning matters that otherwise\nwould be heard by Federal courts to the probate court,\nthat it can, in effect, shield those --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the strongest case for\nyou on that is?\nMR. RICHLAND: Oh, I think Hess --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You said this Court has\nrepeatedly said. So what --\nMR. RICHLAND: Said it over and over, but\nHess v. Reynolds from 1885, which says that merely the\nconvenience of a -- a State court to, you know, assign\nmatters to -- to its probate court. That was a case in\nwhich a debt --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But -- but this case\ninvolves a lot more than convenience. It involves a\nsubstantial amount of assets that is either going to\npass to one person under probate or is not going to be\navailable for passing to that person because of the\ninter vivos gift. That seems to be more closely\nrelated to the core probate matters.\nMR. RICHLAND: Well in fact, Chief Justice\nRoberts, I don't believe that's the case. Nothing\npassed by way of probate in this case. The -- there\nwere no assets in the probate. What happened here was\nthat all of the assets -- and the record shows this,\nand I don't believe it's -- that there is any dispute\nhere. All of the assets had passed to the respondent\nin this case before the will and the trust were\nactually submitted to the probate court.\nOnce again, this is a tort claim and it's a\ntort claim only for an interference. If those assets\nhad never gone to respondent in this case, there would,\nnevertheless, still be a good tort claim. If, for\nexample, those assets had been passed to respondent's\nchild or to another brother, the interference itself --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Richland --\nMR. RICHLAND: Excuse me, Justice --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- what seems to me to be\ninvolved here is what is not uncommon in our Federal\nsystem, that is, two proceedings, both dealing with the\nsame or closely related subject matter. It is not\ninfrequent that you have parallel proceedings in\nFederal court and State court, and then the one that\ngets finished first -- that judgment is binding on the\nother. And as I understand it, the probate proceeding\nconcluded first before the district judge reviewed the\nbankruptcy judge's opinion.\nMR. RICHLAND: Justice Ginsburg, you're quite\ncorrect that issues -- that -- that the principles of\npreclusion ordinarily would deal with the kinds of\nissues here, and -- and we think that that -- those --\nthat should be what governs this case.\nBut I don't believe that it is correct to say\nthat the probate court judgment preceded that of the\nbankruptcy court. The bankruptcy court judgment came\nfirst. A year later the probate court judgment then --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I'm -- I'm assuming\n-- and correct me if I'm wrong about this -- that the\nbankruptcy court makes a proposed opinion. It doesn't\nbecome a binding opinion until it's affirmed by the\ndistrict court.\nMR. RICHLAND: Unless it's a core matter.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. RICHLAND: And here we claim that it is a\ncore matter.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, if it isn't a core\nmatter. I think you lost on that in the district\ncourt.\nMR. RICHLAND: If it isn't a core matter,\nthen in any event the district court here held that\nthere was no preclusion, and it held it for a number of\nreasons.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was not reviewed\nby the Ninth Circuit.\nMR. RICHLAND: That's correct. That was not\nreviewed by the Ninth Circuit. But that would be the\n-- the appropriate manner of review.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That would -- that would\nbe the -- if you -- if you're correct about the limits\nof the probate exception, that issue would be open for\nreview by the Ninth Circuit.\nMR. RICHLAND: It certainly would, Justice\nGinsburg. We agree with that.\nAnd if I may reserve the rest of my time for\nrebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. RICHLAND: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Maynard.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMS. MAYNARD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nTwo independent principles require reversal\nof the Ninth Circuit's decision.\nFirst, the probate exception to Federal\njurisdiction is a will-specific rule and it does not\napply beyond the context of wills to other types of\nwill substitutes like inter vivos trusts.\nSecond, even with respect to wills, it is a\nvery narrow exception that is no bar to deciding the\nrights to a decedent's estate, construing a will, or\ndetermining the testator's intent.\nThere are only three things under this\nCourt's precedent that a Federal court cannot do. The\nfirst is to probate a will, that is, to determine the\nformal key requisites of the validity of a will;\nsecond, to annul an already probated will; and three,\nto take in rem jurisdiction over a res over which a\nState court has already taken in rem jurisdiction. But\nthat is it, and none of those are applicable here.\nThe justifications for the probate exception\ndo not apply to will substitutes. The -- the probate\nexception is based on the peculiar nature of a will,\nthat is, that unlike inter vivos trusts, unlike the\ncurrent modern will substitutes, a will is not valid --\nit has no legal effect. This Court's opinions have\nsaid that on several occasions -- unless it is\nprobated. Therefore, a will must be probated even if\nthere is no dispute about its validity before any title\ncan pass. Not so with trusts. In fact, that is the\nwhole point that people engage in the modern world\nsubstitutes is to avoid the necessity to go to the\nprobate court in order to have their assets passed to\ntheir heirs.\nThe second ground for this Court's probate\nexception is a historical one based on the Court's\nunderstanding of the limits of the equity courts in\nEngland. Whatever the merit of that historical\nanalysis, it has no application to trusts, which have\nalways been the problems of equity.\nThe Federal Government has a strong interest\nin the Court not expanding the Federal exception -- the\n-- the probate exception to Federal jurisdiction,\nparticularly in the sweeping manner that the Ninth\nCircuit has done. It is not uncommon for the tax\nconsequences of an estate planning instrument, such as\na trust, to turn on whether or not the trust is valid\nor invalid. And the Congress has provided Federal\njurisdiction to the United States to bring its -- most\nof its disputes in the Federal court system.\nSecondly, more generally, Congress has\ndetermined what types of disputes should be in the\nFederal courts and has passed broad statutes providing\nthe courts with Federal jurisdiction that the courts\nhave an obligation to exercise, if it exists.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Except if it's a will\n-- will-specific. In other words, you -- it seems to\nme you're in for a penny and in for a pound. You\nrecognize the existence of this exception in certain\ncases, and then you argue against it by saying, well,\nCongress wrote the statutes broadly. The latter\nargument disproves your first point.\nMS. MAYNARD: I don't believe it does, and\nperhaps I'm -- I'm -- I wasn't making clear what my\nargument is. The Court has adopted a very narrow\nprobate exception with respect to the probating of the\nwill and annulling a probated will, but that is it.\nAnd that analysis was based on a -- the historical --\nthe Court's view of the historical limits of courts of\nequity and therefore was an interpretation of the\nFederal diversity statute. Under the logic of\nAnkenbrandt, one can assume -- one may -- the Court may\nassume that's carried forward.\nBut certainly that -- for the reasons I've\nsaid, that rationale, those justifications, for that\nnarrow will rule do not apply to trusts, which have\nalways been the province of equity, and especially\ngiven the questionable historical underpinnings of the\nexception, even the narrow exception that does appear\nto exist, there's no justification for expanding that\nbeyond its current confines.\nAs this Court recognized in Ankenbrandt, the\nlower courts had taken the -- the so-called domestic\nrelations exception beyond this Court's very narrow\nlimits, and this Court brought -- brought it back to\nits origins. And -- and the Federal Government\nbelieves that -- that the same would be appropriate\nhere with respect to the probate exception.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Maynard, it's my\nunderstanding that a lot of this law developed out of\nthe dicta in the Markham case. Do you think the dicta\nin the Markham case was an accurate description of the\nprior history?\nMS. MAYNARD: It was probably not a very\nprecise history, Justice Stevens. I do think one can\nread Markham, however, especially if one reads it in\nthe context of the cases it cites for its principles,\nto hold what we are saying now, which is that Federal\ncourts have no jurisdiction over pure probate matters,\nthat is, no jurisdiction to probate a will. And its\ninterference language, I believe, was its statement of\nthe in rem v. in rem jurisdiction principle, which in\nfact isn't really a probate jurisdiction principle at\nall.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What do you mean by no\njurisdiction to probate a will? Could -- could -- does\nthat exclude the possibility of a bankruptcy court\ndeciding for itself where there are contested wills\nthat in its in view the -- the right -- the valid will\nis a certain one and that, therefore, the bankruptcy\nestate includes this fund or doesn't include this fund?\nIs that probating the will?\nMS. MAYNARD: The -- the United States hasn't\ntaken a position on the broader argument about whether\nor not the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if that isn't\nprobating a will, the exception for probating a will\ndoesn't -- doesn't amount to a hill of beans, does it?\nMS. MAYNARD: If -- if the question you're\nasking me is what does it mean to probate a will --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMS. MAYNARD: -- the -- the probate of a will\nrequires determining that it has the appropriate formal\nprerequisites, which in most States is appropriate\nnumber of signatures that the testator was coherent,\ncompetent to make a will and that there was no undue\ninfluence.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, and that this is --\nthat this is the -- the last will and testament and\nthat there is not some other one.\nMS. MAYNARD: That's true, yes, that there's\nno competing will.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. Now, can -- can the\nbankruptcy court determine that, that the -- that the\nproper will and testament of this decedent is this one?\nWe're not probating it. No, no.\nMS. MAYNARD: The --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We don't pretend to probate\nit. We're just saying that this happens to be the true\nwill and testament.\nMS. MAYNARD: It's conceivable that if that\ndetermination went to a -- an element of, for example,\na tort claim and that the person were not -- were not\nseeking to take under the will, it is possible. This\nCourt's precedent doesn't address that precise\nquestion. The United States hasn't taken a position on\nwhether or not bankruptcy jurisdiction, ala the logic\nin Ankenbrandt, encompasses the narrow probate\nexception that we concede exists because it's not\nnecessary to decide this case. The -- the petitioner's\nclaim is far beyond anything that the probate exception\nhas ever applied to.\nThe respondent suggests that States have an\noverriding interest in having one forum resolve all\nprobate-related disputes. This Court has repeatedly,\nfor over 150 years, rejected that exact proposition --\nJustice Breyer, Payne v. Hook, Hess v. Reynolds,\nMcClellan v. Carland, which this Court cited last term\nin Exxon Mobil -- and it was the basis of Markham's\nreversal of the Ninth Circuit decision that the Federal\njurisdiction is not determined by the scope and extent\nof the State's decisions with respect to where to send\nits own citizens with respect to disputes that don't\notherwise have a basis for Federal jurisdiction. The\nonly place in this --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Maynard, you said at\none point it's not necessary for you to decide this,\nbut there is vast confusion in the lower courts about\nthe extent of the probate exception. And so I take it\nthat your -- what you began -- what you began with is\n-- I wrote them down. That's it?\nMS. MAYNARD: That's what the United States\nbelieves the limit of the exception is, and the -- let\nme be clear. The United States has a strong interest\nin having this Court clarify the exception. That is\nwhere the confusion lies in the court of appeals. That\nis where the United States feels like its interests are\nat risk. So although the petitioner's claim is well\noutside the exception, the United States' interests lie\nin having the Court clear up the confusion and reject\nthe sweeping and expansive view of the probate\nexception that the Ninth Circuit has announced.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And in addition to\nMarkham, what other case of this Court do you think\nspells out the proper bounds?\nMS. MAYNARD: I -- I think the -- Waterman\nhas a -- has a good summary of the -- of the limits. I\nthink even the two cases on which the respondent\nprincipally rely, Sutton and O'Callaghan, lay out the\nproper scope of the rule. Those -- both of those cases\ninvolved a claim that depended on having a will that\nhad been probated declared invalid, and that is within\nthe narrow confines of the exception. But it is a\nwill-specific rule.\nThe -- and, Justice Stevens, back to your\nquestion. The one thing about Markham is that there's\nno general interference principle, and that's where the\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You know there are a lot of\nscholars who think that Markham is the source of most\nof the confusion, and so that's why I was asking\nwhether you think we should -- to clear up, which\nyou're suggesting we should do, we should reexamine\nsome of that dicta or we should just stick to the\nholding.\nMS. MAYNARD: I would -- I would -- you can\n-- it would be helpful to -- to clarify what the Court\nmeant in Markham. I think the holding in Markham is\ncorrect.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: With -- with new\ndicta of our own?\n(Laughter.)\nMS. MAYNARD: It will probably be necessary,\nto -- to rule on the case, to make some holding about\nwhat the scope of the exception is, Your Honor. And\nthe -- the -- but, Justice Stevens, the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We could just say whatever\nits scope is it ain't this. I mean, couldn't we do\nthat?\nMS. MAYNARD: The Court certainly could\nresolve it that way, Your Honor.\nBut, Justice Stevens, the -- the -- Markham,\nI do think, makes clear what interference is and is not\nby its holding. And on page 494 of Markham, it says,\nwhere the final judgment does not undertake to\ninterfere with the State court's possession, save to\nthe extent that the State court is bound by the\njudgment to recognize the right adjudicated by the\nFederal court. So that is not the type of interference\nthat runs afoul of the rule.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.\nMaynard.\nMr. Brunstad.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF G. ERIC BRUNSTAD, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe probate exception exists precisely to\nprevent what happened in this case, a Federal court\nenjoining ongoing probate proceedings in the middle of\na probate trial, a Federal court determining that the\ndecedent's estate plan was invalid, a Federal court's\nreallocation through a damage claim of the decedent's\nassets, contrary to the value of the estate plan, a\nFederal court's creation of a novel cause of action --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, is it -- is it\ncorrect -- I just want to be sure I follow you -- that\nthey determined that the estate plan was invalid?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Correct, Justice Stevens. At\npetition appendix 123 to 126, the district court\ndetermined that the -- that J. Howard's living trust\nwas a forgery, that there were pages that were\nsubstituted --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But this is all -- this has\nnothing -- I mean, I -- you have the total differently\n-- different understanding than I do of this case, and\nI did read Judge Carter's opinion. I thought that case\nsimply held that because your clients had interfered\nwith an effort by J. Howard to give quite a few\nmillions of dollars to Vickie Marshall -- because of\nthat interference, they had committed the tort of inter\nvivos interference with a gift, and they had to pay\ndamages.\nNow, they said a lot of things by way of what\nthe evidence was. Indeed, they did say, as you point\nout, that your clients forged three pages of the will.\nBut that was simply evidence of their bad intent, and\nit did not invalidate anything in the probate\nproceeding, as I read it.\nNow, what have I said that's not right?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Breyer, the answer to\nyour question, I think, depends upon the fact that\nopposing counsel has studiously avoided actually\nrevealing what his claim is. I think we have to focus\non the -- her exact claim. As a matter of fact and as\na matter of law, she did not prevail --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not interested in what\nhe said. I'm interested in what Judge Carter said --\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- because that, it seems to\nme, is -- and what is it that Judge Carter did that was\nwrong in this respect?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Judge -- Judge Carter\nunderstood quite clearly that in order for her claim to\nproceed as a matter of fact and as a matter of law, he\nhad to invalidate her living trust. And let me explain\nwhy that was so.\nThat was so because her claim is that J.\nHoward intended to give her a catchall trust. The\nargument is that Pierce blocked the catchall trust from\nbeing funded by rendering the living trust irrevocable\nin July of 1994. Judge Carter found that the catchall\ntrust was drafted in December of 1994.\nShe can only have a claim -- now, all of J.\nHoward's assets were in the living trust. She can only\nhave a claim -- the catchall trust could only have been\nfunded or prevented from being funded if the living\ntrust was, in fact, validly rendered irrevocable. To\nprevent -- to -- to counter that, she says, no, the\nliving trust was invalid. As a matter of fact, she can\nhave no claim unless the living trust is rendered\ninvalid. Judge Carter understood that and he expressly\nconcluded that it was a forgery.\nNow rendering--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't -- isn't it the case\nthat she can have her claim and she can prove her\nclaim, but she may not be able to collect the judgment\nunless the living trust is invalid? But that's not\nwhat we're litigating here, is it?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Your Honor, as a matter of\nlaw, she cannot have her claim because the two cases we\nrely on, Neill v. Yett and Thompson v. Deloitte, the\ntwo Texas cases, establish as a predicate to any\ntortious interference claim, she must demonstrate that\nthe estate plan, the living trust, was invalid as a\nmatter of Texas law. And that is exclusively under\nTexas law for the Texas probate court to decide.\nNow --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why does she have to show\nthat is invalid as distinct from showing that another\ntrust, favorable to her, was not created and it was not\ncreated because of the tortious conduct of your client?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Because, Justice Souter, under\nTexas law when the -- the probate court determines the\nvalidity of an estate plan, it forecloses, as a matter\nof law, all expectancies contrary to those that are\npart of the estate plan.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let me -- let me stop\nyou there because this is something I didn't understand\nin the brief. You speak of the Texas probate court\ndetermining the validity of an estate plan.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I take it the Texas probate\ncourt determined the validity of a will here.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It determined the validity\nof -- of a pourover trust. Is that correct?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Your Honor, it did.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: The living trust.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right.\nIsn't it the case that the two Texas\ndeterminations can be respected and still, in the\nFederal court, enter a judgment for tort liability\nagainst your client?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: No, Justice Souter, and the\nreason why is because her cause of action is a State\nlaw cause of action, and under Texas law, putting aside\nthe fact that no Texas court has ever recognized a\ncause of action for tortious interference --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's in -- you may be\nright on that, but that's not what -- what we're here\nfor.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Correct. Putting that aside,\nunder Texas law -- and the Deloitte case and the Neill\nv. Yett case conclusively established this, and there's\nno contrary decisions in Texas -- that once the probate\ncourt determines an estate plan is valid, it\nconclusively determines the universe of persons with\nlegitimate expectancies.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But when you speak of estate\nplan, you are -- you seem to be talking in global\nterms; i.e., that there could have been no other\ndisposition of assets by the decedent or on behalf of\nthe decedent except those which the Texas court is\nrecognizing, the trust, the will. Is that what the\nTexas court does, or does the Texas court say, the will\nis good, the trust is good?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: The Texas courts have\nconveniently described for us Justice -- Justice Souter\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, is it\npreclusive of everything else? That's what I'm getting\nat.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, exactly so, Justice\nSouter. And in the Thompson case itself, the -- the\nTexas court says, when the probate court admitted the\n1989 will to probate, it necessarily found that Mr.\nThompson signed the will with testamentary capacity and\nthat it reflected his intent, was not the result of\ncoercion or under influence, and was valid. And the\ncourt continued, as a matter of law, the final probate\ncourt judgment bars any claim that appellees tortiously\ninterfered with any inheritance--\nJUSTICE BREYER: That -- that sounds to\nme like a matter of preemption, but -- but -- or not\npreemption but, you know, res judicata.\nBut just out of curiosity or -- because I\nthink it is relevant, did the Texas probate court have\nin front of it the documents among the lawyers that the\ndistrict judge, Judge Carter, relied upon in showing\nthat there was an intent to create the catchall trust?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Breyer. Everything\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: It had all those documents.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Breyer.\nEverything the district court had and more was examined,\nadjudicated in the 5-and-a-half-month jury trial in the\nTexas probate court exhaustively.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So why isn't that, as\nJustice Breyer prefaced his question, an issue of\npreclusion rather than, as you frame it, an issue of\njurisdiction?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Chief Justice Roberts, the\nprobate exception has always been jurisdictional, and\nthe reason why it can't be subsumed by res judicata or\ncollateral estoppel -- we believe we win on those\ngrounds, but the reason why the probate exception can't\nbe subsumed within those doctrines is because it\napplies even before you have a State court judgment.\nIt prevents a Federal court from determining an estate\nplan from being invalidated --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why should it? The\nprobate exception is court-created. Congress passed no\nlaw that said it. Congress gave the Federal courts\njurisdiction in certain categories of cases and\nexpected them to exercise that jurisdiction. Since our\njurisdiction is statutory and the probate exception was\nmade up by the courts, shouldn't we interpret it as\nnarrowly as possible, perhaps even do away with it\nbecause it lacks any statutory basis?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Ginsburg, the probate\nexception, like the domestic relations exception, is\nbest conceived as a presumption that when Congress\nestablishes a font of Federal jurisdiction, it does not\nintend that jurisdiction to be extended to interfere\nwith probate proceedings. That is properly a\njurisdictional doctrine in this case because it is\nnever appropriate for a bankruptcy court to invalidate\nor validate a will and -- or an estate plan. And that\nis a necessary element of Vickie's claim.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you say -- you say an\n-- an estate plan. Most people would think insurance\npolicies are part of their estate plan, and if it's\nalleged that there was a fraudulent alteration of the\nbeneficiary designation in the insurance policies, is\nthat within the Texas probate court jurisdiction?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Kennedy, no. Here we\nhave -- when I say estate plan, I mean the living trust\nand the will operating together.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, there's -- there's a\nfurther irony here in that revocable trusts are always\npromoted on the grounds that it keeps us out of\nprobate. And now you're -- you're insisting that it\nhas to be in probate.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Well, Justice Kennedy, the\nliving trust here did two things that a will does. It\nprovided for the succession of J. Howard's property\nupon his death, and it provided for the payment of his\nlast -- last illness expenses and his -- his debts. It\nis quintessentially a will substitute in the sense that\nit also provides for the succession of his property.\nIn this case --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it isn't probated.\nThat's -- it is, indeed, a will substitute. The whole\npurpose of doing it is to avoid probate.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But in this case, Justice\nScalia, the will and the -- the living trust acted\ntogether. The probate court had exclusive jurisdiction\nover both of them and the challenges to them. Vickie\nchallenged the living trust, even before J. Howard\ndied. Those proceedings continued on in the probate\ncourt, and --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but as Justice Breyer\nindicated, can't you just, for purposes of\nunderstanding the cause of action as asserted by Vickie\nMarshall here, just say, we will assume the trust is\nvalid, we will assume the will is valid? All we're\nsaying was that there's a tort and he's going to be\nliable to us in tort.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Because, Justice Kennedy,\nagain, a critical element of her cause of action is\nthe invalidity of the trust as a matter of fact and\nlaw.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why? Why? Why? That is to\nsay, what the finding is, is that there was a different\nmatter, a catchall trust, and he told the lawyers, go\ndraw it up so I can give gifts to her, the increase in\nthe value of my property during the 13 months we're\nmarried, do it, and they never did it. Now, that seems\nto have nothing whatsoever to do with the GRAT trust or\nwith the will. It just happens that those are\nevidentiary, what went on there, of what likely\nhappened with the catchall trust.\nSo I don't see why those are necessary. I\ndon't see why they're more than evidentiary, and I\ndon't see whether or not those are barred, those\nparticular facts have anything to do with this, as far\nas jurisdiction is concerned.\nNow, explain to me why I'm wrong.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Certainly, Justice Breyer.\nFirst of all, Texas has the right to prescribe the\nelements of its own causes of action, and under Texas\nlaw, her cause of action depends upon two critical\nthings, a legitimate expectancy J. Howard intended to\ndo this for her, and the second, tortious conduct of\nsome kind. Her claim -- she tries to meet those two\ncritical elements by showing two things. One, that J.\nHoward intended to give me this -- this gift in the\nform of this -- this trust, and that it was tortiously\ninterfered with because the living trust was rendered\nirrevocable.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's just one of the\nthings.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But it's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Among other things that went\non were they hired private detectives to go after\nher, to keep her from the bed. I mean, you've read that\nopinion and there are like about 30 things in there. And\nI grant you that one of those things is the fact that\nthree pages of the living trust, according to the judge,\nwere created after the event of that trust and slipped\nin without his knowledge. I mean, it's quite a story.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Of course, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And -- and so I -- but as I\nread it, there were many, many, many things involved\nhere, and this is just one of them. So how can Texas\nsay that you have to prove this particular one as -- as\nopposed to proving a lot of others?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Breyer, of course, as\nan aside, we went to great pains in the Ninth Circuit\nto demonstrate why all those findings were clearly\nerroneous and not based on the evidence.\nBut assuming them to be so, which we dispute,\nagain, looking at her claim, that is the critical\nelement of her claim. If, in fact, there -- if, in\nfact, the living trust was made revocable, then at any\npoint in time, he could have funded, if -- if he had it\nas revocable until his death, he could have funded her\ngift that she alleges and she would have no damage\nclaim. It is because of the trust becoming irrevocable\nthat he was prevented from doing it. That is her\nclaim.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but her claim is assume\nit's been made irrevocable. I just want some money\nfrom this guy.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's all she's saying, as\nI understand it. She -- she can -- as I understand her\ncause of action, it can proceed on the assumption the\nwill is valid, the -- the trust is valid. Just give me\nthe money that I would have had.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Souter, as a matter of\nTexas law, she cannot establish a legitimate\nexpectancy. Again, once the probate court -- and the\nprobate court alone has the right to determine the\nvalidity of an estate plan. Once the probate court has\ndetermined that as a matter of Texas law, all claims\nabout expectancies contrary to those provided in the --\nin the plan are foreclosed. That's the Thompson case\nand the Neill case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You're arguing a\npreclusion question, and if the Ninth Circuit thought\nit had jurisdiction, it could have tested what you say\nabout Texas law. There's no finding in this record of\nwhat Texas law is other than what you have just told\nus, and perhaps you're right and perhaps you're not.\nBut the Ninth Circuit said the Federal door is closed\nto this probate exception, and that's what we're here\nto decide.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Ginsburg, preclusion\nwill also not work. Res judicata and collateral\nestoppel will also not work because the parties in the\nFederal proceeding are merely a subset of the parties\nin the probate court. The probate court's judgment is\nunique because it has a binding-against-the-world\neffect. Federal courts cannot pull chunks of the\ncritical issues into the Federal court because doing\nso creates an inconsistency of judgments potentially.\nWhere the Federal court only has part of the parties\nbefore it, the Federal court has all -- the probate\ncourt has all the parties before it. The probate\ncourt's judgment is binding against the world --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I think it -- it may be\nthat there's another side to that story. For example,\nI think the bankruptcy court was heard from first.\nArguably, that's binding on the Texas court. Whether\nthe bankruptcy court was right or wrong, it would get\nfull faith and credit. That's one argument.\nAnother is perhaps you can explain to me how\nthis all started because I thought that it was a claim\nmade against her in the bankruptcy court for\ndefamation. Then the claim that she asserts is a\ncompulsory counterclaim. She has to make it there or\nshe'll lose it.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: No, Justice Ginsburg, the\nclaim was not a compulsory counterclaim. The action\nwhich was -- that Pierce commenced in the -- in the\nbankruptcy court was merely to ask the bankruptcy court\nto decide that if he had a debt against -- if he had a\nclaim against her she owed him money, it would be\nnondischargeable in bankruptcy. She then used that\nopportunity to pursue this tortious interference claim\nagainst Pierce that she was already pursuing in the\nprobate court. So because there was a prior pending\nproceeding where she had made the claim --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I -- I didn't understand\nthe pleading to say if I have a claim, it would be\nnondischargeable. I thought he made a claim. He made\n-- filed a claim for defamation in the bankruptcy\nproceeding.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Ginsburg, Pierce did\nnot ask the bankruptcy court to decide the claim. He\nonly -- he only asked for the bankruptcy court to\ndecide whether it was nondischargeable or not.\nBut even so -- even so, I think it's\nimportant to recognize --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: He would have to say I\nhave a claim because the bankruptcy court is not going\nto decide a hypothetical if he has a claim. He has to\nat least assert I have a claim.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But bankruptcy judges do that,\nJustice Ginsburg. They decide only the\nnondischargeability aspect of claims rather than the\nclaims themselves.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It has to be a real claim.\nIt can't be if I have a claim.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: No, Justice Ginsburg, because\nthe nondischargeability jurisdiction in bankruptcy is\nunique. You allow the claim to be determined in a\nproper court of competent jurisdiction, and then the\nbankruptcy court decides whether it's nondischargeable\nor not. That's how it should proceed particularly\nwhere, as here, her claim requires, as -- in order for\nit to -- to be valid, to determine the validity or\nnonvalidity of J. Howard's estate plan.\nNow, the United States --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I don't -- I\ndon't see how the interference with the probate court\nthat you're articulating is any greater than the\ninterference in Markham. In Markham, it was a decision\nby a Federal court that these claimants were not\ngoing to claim under the will. Why is -- isn't that\neven greater than the interference you're complaining\nof?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: No, Chief Justice Roberts.\nYou can readily divide the Court's precedents into two\ncategories, those where there was impermissible\ninterference and therefore no jurisdiction, and those\nwhere there isn't. On the impermissible interference\nside, you have a case like Federal court cannot\ndetermine the validity of an estate plan, Armstrong,\nGaines v. Chew. A Federal -- a Federal court cannot\ndetermine --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was it an estate plan or a\nwill?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: In Sutton --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you -- you -- you're\nstretching the probate concept from determining whether\nthe will is valid or invalid and who inherits under the\nwill to also determining what goes into the probate\nestate, that is, the insurance policies, the trust, and\nso forth. That to me is -- is something quite\ndifferent from probating a will.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Scalia, the probate\nexception protects the integrity of the succession\nprocess. If the documents you're looking at deal with\nthe succession of the property, as the living trust and\nwill do in this case, it is encompassed within the\nprobate exception in the Sutton case --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, I don't -- I don't see\nyour -- your logic there. Of course, it protects the\nsuccession process, but it does not follow that\neverything that implicates a succession process falls\nwithin the probate exception.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Correct. Correct, Justice\nSouter. But here the succession was determined under\nthe living trust, and in Sutton v. English, that's\nexactly the same scenario. Moses Hubbard left a --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If -- if there had been a\njoint bank account, the succession would have been\ndetermined based on the validity of the joint bank\naccount, and that certainly wouldn't have fallen within\nthe probate exception.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Because the joint -- where you\nhave the equivalent of tenancies in the entirety, I'd\nsay that's a separate issue.\nHere, however, the living trust performed all\nthe functions of a traditional will, unlike a joint\nbank account. In the Sutton case, you had both a will\nand a trust, just like in this case. There, Moses\nHubbard left a will and a trust. Mary Jane Hubbard\nenjoyed the benefits of the trust for her life.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Does -- does Texas law\nprovide that a -- a living trust must be executed and\nadministered with the formalities of a will?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Not quite the same, Justice\nSouter. Not quite the same.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then -- then you have to get\nbeyond our probate exception cases to cover the living\ntrust.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But in Sutton v. English,\nthere was both a will and a trust, exactly the same as\nhere. The plaintiffs were just going after the\nproperty. We just want the assets. We're saying we're\nnot touching the trust and the will. This Court held\n-- this Court held, wait a minute. Only the Texas\nprobate courts may determine whether these instruments\nare valid or not.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but she's not --\nshe's not even going after the assets in this case.\nShe's asserting an in personam claim against the\nindividual. Correct?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: She is, but that's exactly the\nsame as Broderick's Will, Chief Justice Roberts, an in\npersonam claim against the beneficiaries of the\nallegedly invalid estate plan to impose a constructive\ntrust on them to get the money. No matter how you dice\nit or slice it in this case, she is doing an end run\naround the probate proceeding.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't think they're going\nto impose a constructive trust, are they? All -- all\nthey're going to say is pay her the money.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But why are they going to say\npay her the money?\nJUSTICE BREYER: They're going to say it\nbecause they make a finding that through a whole\nvariety of various devices, all of which were listed,\nthat J. Howard, who wanted to give her money through\nsomething called the catchall trust was prevented in\nabout 15 ways. And even if you're right that there's a\nTexas finding that those three pages weren't slipped\nin, well, how do we know? Maybe it was a valid GRAT\ntrust, but if only they hadn't tried to isolate J.\nHoward from contact with her, J. Howard would have\nfigured out what had happened before he died and he\nwould have told his lawyers, hey, cut this out. Do\nwhat I want. Revoke it. But all that is just\nhypothetical. I'm just using that to show you why I\nthink this is evidentiary not a matter of what the\nelements of the crime are -- or the elements of the\ntort are.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: What's not evidentiary,\nJustice Breyer, is the fact that in order to prove a\nlegitimate expectancy, she must establish that the\nvalidated estate plan is in fact invalid. And under\nTexas law, that can only be done in the probate court.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's the cite on that that\nI -- that I need for --\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Well, in our brief we cite to\nmany, many cases, Your Honor. I would -- I would\nspecifically refer you to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're saying you can't\nbring an inter vivos trust -- an inter vivos --\ninterference with an inter vivos gift action in Texas\nunless you show that a will, for example, is invalid.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: That's correct, Your Honor,\nand those are the Neill v. Yett and the Thompson --\nThompson v. Deloitte cases, which I was reading to\nbefore. And the Court said as a matter of law, the\nfinal probate court judgment bars any claim that\nappellees tortiously interfered with any inheritance\nexpectancy because, in light of the final invalid\nprobate court judgment, appellant has --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that -- but that's res\njudicata. I mean, that -- that isn't necessarily a --\nan application of -- of any probate exception.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Scalia, it is not res\njudicata for the following reason. Not only may a\nFederal court not determine the validity or invalidity\nafter the probate court, it may not do so before the\nprobate court has had a chance --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You say that, but that case\ndoesn't say that.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: That case doesn't say that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what case do you\nhave that says that?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: The cases -- there is no\nspecific case where someone has tried to litigate a\ntortious interference claim in Federal court before the\nprobate court has had -- has had its say.\nUnder Texas law, however, because of the\npreclusive effect of that determination, Vickie would\nbe able to come to the probate court and say, look, J.\nHoward intended to give me this. It's a finding of\nintent. That's preclusive on the probate court. The\nprobate court would be perhaps prohibited from saying,\noh, I can't determine under -- that the valid estate\nplan gives the intent to somebody else.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the mere fact that you\nhave jurisdiction to say something does not mean that\nif -- if some other court says the same thing first,\nyou won't be bound by that.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: The problem, though, Justice\nScalia, is that the probate court is supposed to make\nthat finding in a judgment good against the world. But\nall of a sudden, part of the world who has done an end\nrun around the probate proceeding has now gone to some\nother court for a critical determination of fact that\nthe probate court must decide and always must decide in\ndetermining the validity of an estate plan --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- you are suggesting\nan extraordinary setup with a State court being able to\npreclude other courts from dealing with related, not\nidentical matters, and that's just not the way our\nsystem works. You can bring duplicative proceedings in\ndifferent courts. One will finish first and that will\nbind the others. But I -- I never heard of a State\ncourt being able to say, because we are a probate\ncourt, that you -- you couldn't bring a tort case\nsomeplace else.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Ginsburg --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The -- the only court\nI've heard of that can do that is the Federal\nbankruptcy court.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Just as a Federal bankruptcy\ncourt is in rem and executes and enters some judgments\ngood against the world with respect to some issues, a\nprobate court does the same thing. You have exactly\nthe same reason why the probate court does it as in the\nbankruptcy court.\nNow, this Court has recognized in Tilt v.\nKelsey, for example, that the State has a sovereign\ninterest in deciding the scope of its probate procedure\nthat the State may, this Court said in Broderick's\nWill, provide for the probate court to enter a judgment\ngood against the world, whether the person was a party\nto the proceeding or not. If a -- if a Federal court\ncan predetermine --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's the definition of\nan in rem judgment, but she's suing for an in personam\njudgment an individual, not an estate, just for a plain\nold money judgment.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But in a race to judgment,\nYour Honor, if the Federal court gets to decide this\ncritical issue of intent before the probate court, it\npreempts the probate court from doing its core probate\nfunction of validating or invalidating an estate plan.\nThat would render our probate system unworkable. That\nis why --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Brunstad --\nMR. BRUNSTAD: -- this is a jurisdictional\ndoctrine.\nYes, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you two\nquestions? First, if there were no such animal as the\nprobate exception, would there have been bankruptcy\ncourt jurisdiction over your claim?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: We argue no, Justice Stevens,\nbecause as we argued in the Ninth Circuit, there was\nnot even bankruptcy jurisdiction because the other side\nnever responded to our argument that the outcome of\nthis case would not result in any money going to\ncreditors of her estate.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So your -- you would\nprevail even if there were no probate exception in your\nview.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: That's our argument. The\nNinth Circuit did not address that ground, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And my -- my second\nquestion is I noticed you quoted from a Minnesota Law\nReview about 250 cases, and the -- your opponent\npointed out that the -- the next sentence of the\narticle said the holdings don't support the\ngeneralization. And I would just like to ask you,\napart from the Markham case, what is the case -- what\nholding of a case lends the greatest support to your\nprobate exception argument.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Stevens, I think that\nthe Sutton case is the closest. The next closest is\nBroderick's Will. Sutton again involved both a trust\nand a will and was a construction of Texas law, which\nwe say the Court has already decided in Sutton, and\nTexas law, which is undisputed, has the effects which\nwe say it has in the brief. They did not contest,\nJustice Ginsburg, our construction or interpretation of\nTexas law.\nI think also that the Court's decisions in\nTarver and Fouvergne and also Ellis and O'Callaghan --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not asking you to rank\nthem. I don't want a list of cases that have a lot of\ndicta because some of these cases went off on laches,\nsome went off a lot of different grounds than purely --\nthan -- some of them don't even mention probate.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Stevens, I think that\nit's -- it would be helpful if I could give you a\nthumbnail sketch breaking down, what I was trying to do\nearlier, between those where there's impermissible\ninterference and those where there's not impermissible\ninterference. The United States' characterization I\nthink is incorrect.\nFor example, again, this Court has determined\nthere's no jurisdiction for a Federal court to\ndetermine the validity of an instrument. That's the\nfirst case in Armstrong v. Lear and also Gaines v.\nChew.\nAlso, this Court has determined there's no\nFederal jurisdiction to determine the invalidity of an\nestate plan. That's Tarver, Fouvergne, and\nO'Callaghan, Broderick's Will, Sutton, and Ellis.\nThis Court has determined that Federal courts\ndo not have jurisdiction to administer the probate\nestate. That's Byers v. McAuley.\nThis Court has determined that there is no\nFederal jurisdiction to take possession of the assets\nin the probate court. That is also Broderick's Will.\nI'm sorry. That is Byers v. McAuley.\nThis Court has determined one may not impose\na constructive trust on the beneficiaries as, in\nessence, a way to get property to them. That's\nBroderick's Will and Sutton.\nThis Court has determined there's no\njurisdiction to recover property from the beneficiary\nbecause of an alleged invalidity of a will. That's --\nthat's the Ellis case.\nThis Court has determined there's no\njurisdiction for the Federal court to direct an\naccounting from the administrator. That's the Waterman\ncase.\nThis Court has determined there's no\njurisdiction to interfere with the State court's\npossession of the assets, again Waterman, Williams,\nYonley, and Borer.\nNow, no jurisdiction. It's always been a\njurisdictional doctrine.\nAnd for the same reasons this Court refused\nto recharacterize the -- the domestic relations\nexception as a abstention doctrine, the Court should\nalso decline to do so here under the probate exception.\nNow, the other side of the schema is, when is\nit permissible for a Federal court to undertake a\nprobate-related matter? Well, if the State allows the\nclaim, particular claim, to be brought outside its\nexclusive probate system, then Federal courts may\nentertain jurisdiction as well.\nJUSTICE BREYER: By the way, in Texas if you\nhave to go through all this probate stuff and\neverything, and they want to claim 15 years ago my\nmother gave a ring to my cousin who stole it, is that\nprecluded to bring that tort action when the person\nwho, you know, was supposed to get it finds out about\nit?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Breyer, all claims of\nincomplete gift, which Vickie's claim is here, compete\nwith an estate plan.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So -- so, in other words, if\nit -- when the guy is 2 years -- 15 years old, he gives\na ring to somebody, and now he dies at age 93, and when\nthey find out about that incomplete gift at age 15,\nnobody can bring a lawsuit anymore. You have to go to\nthe probate court.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: If in fact the ring passed\nunder his valid estate plan, yes. Because the ring\npassed under the valid estate plan, you have to\noverturn the estate plan before you say the property\ngoes somewhere else.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Thank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Richland, you\nhave 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. RICHLAND\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. RICHLAND: Thank you, Your Honor.\nJustice Breyer, to answer your question about\nwhether the Texas court had all of the material before\nit that was before the bankruptcy court, the answer to\nthat can be seen at page 45 of the appendix where the\ndistrict court judge says that there were 400 boxes of\ndocuments.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but did those documents\n-- did those boxes contain the key documents --\nMR. RICHLAND: They did.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- about the catchall trust?\nMR. RICHLAND: They did. They contained the\n-- perhaps the most key documents, which were the\nbilling records that showed that that trust was\nactually drafted. The trust, of course, never saw the\nlight of day, but those billing records reflected that.\nAnd none of that was in front of the Texas probate\ncourt.\nIn addition, Justice Breyer, you mentioned\nthat there were a number of other instances of tortious\nmisconduct that were found by Justice Carter, in\naddition to the forging of the -- of the irrevocability\npoint. Indeed, Justice Carter found that there were\nmassive transfers of J. Howard's assets to Pierce\nMarshall in his last days, and those asset transfers\nwere made in exchange for notes that were payable years\nin the future. This was after J. Howard had been\ndiagnosed with terminal cancer, after he had had a\nheart attack. Annuities were used to pay for those as\nwell. So that he was essentially stripped of all of\nhis assets by the time he was dead. There was -- there\nwere no assets in the probate estate at that time.\nJustice Ginsburg, I would refer you to\nappendix page 42 where the -- the district court\nindicates that both a proof of claim and an adversary\ncomplaint were first filed by Pierce Marshall in the\nbankruptcy court, and that is, indeed, what caused,\nseveral months later, the compulsory counterclaim to be\nfiled in a response.\nMr. Brunstad indicated that what happened\nhere was that while the claim was pending in Texas, it\nwas then brought to the bankruptcy court presumably\nbecause there was some dissatisfaction on Ms.\nMarshall's part as to how the Texas probate court was\ngoing. In fact, page 1 of our reply brief details very\nspecifically the fact that the first time that the\ntortious interference with gift claim was made was in\nthe bankruptcy court as the compulsory counterclaim.\nAnd I would just conclude by stating that the\ncause of action that was at issue here was really a\nvery common one. It's the -- not in and of itself, but\nit's common to make a claim against the estate in debt\nor that a gift was given, and that may, indeed,\ndiminish the estate that is eventually passed. But\nthat doesn't invalidate any of the estate planning\ndocuments. It simply means that something that might\notherwise have been within the estate was not included\nin the estate.\nThat's really all that happened here. The\nclaim was for tortious interference with gift. That,\nindeed, may have diminished the amount or may not have\nsince J. Howard was actually quite an active man at the\ntime that he made this -- this gift or intended to make\nthe gift, and was still doing business deals. He may\nhave increased his -- his assets enormously at that\npoint in time.\nBut in any event, what it certainly does not\ndo is, it does not invalidate an estate plan. It does\nnot invalidate a will, and it certainly didn't\ninvalidate the trust or the will in this case.\nIf there are any further questions, I'd be\nhappy to answer them.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. RICHLAND: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The case is\nsubmitted.\n(Whereupon, at 12:14 p.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n"
