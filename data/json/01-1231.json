        "content": "(11:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in Number 10-1 -- 1231, the Connecticut Department of\nPublic Safety versus John Doe.\nGeneral Blumenthal.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD BLUMENTHAL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. BLUMENTHAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThis case, like Alaska's, is about fully\naccurate, concededly true public record information about\nconvicted sex offenders that citizens of Connecticut and\nthe 50 other States need and deserve -- indeed, they\ndemand be made available and accessible -- so they can\nmake choices about how to protect themselves, their\nfamilies, and their children.\nAnd each of the convicted sex offenders on this\nregistry has received a hearing, a full and fair hearing,\nmany of them a trial, all of them the full panoply of due\nprocess rights and have been found guilty beyond a\nreasonable doubt.\nQUESTION: In this case, General Blumenthal,\nwe're not talking about ex post facto. We're just talking\nabout due process of some sort because the Second Circuit\nsaid this couldn't be applied whether it was done\nafterwards or before.\nMR. BLUMENTHAL: We are, indeed, Mr. Chief\nJustice, talking only about the due process issue and only\nabout whether, first, the listing on this registry is\ndefamatory and, second, whether the defamation, if, in\nfact, it exists -- and we say it doesn't -- is a violation\nof the Due Process Clause in the way that it is imposed\nhere, that is, under Paul v. Davis, whether there is a\nloss or alteration of right or status as a result of that\ndefamation --\nQUESTION: It's a procedural due process claim,\nnot substantive due process.\nMR. BLUMENTHAL: The -- the claim has been a\nprocedural due process claim, although the United States\nas amicus has raised -- and we welcome that it has\nraised -- the substantive due process issue. But --\nQUESTION: We don't normally address issues\nraised by amici, do we?\nMR. BLUMENTHAL: I don't know whether the Court\nis more hospitable to claims that may be raised by amici\nfrom the United States Government, but it certainly is a\nrelevant issue to be addressed here because many of the\nclaims raised under the guise of due process really\ninvolve line drawing and categories. For example, the\nquestion of which offenses should be listed on the\nregistry really is a legislative determination.\nQUESTION: Well, the Second Circuit's position\nputs us -- decision puts us in a somewhat difficult\nposition. It's a procedural due process opinion, and we\nhave to say, procedural due process to protect what right?\nSo we have to go back and find out what the basic right\nthey're talking about is, and I suppose the narrow way to\ndo it is to look just to whether or not there's -- there's\na Paul versus Virginia type of claim with this -- with\nthis -- with a stigma --\nMR. BLUMENTHAL: Certainly that is the way\nthe -- the case comes to the Court, raising that issue,\nand it's one that we believe merits reversal of the Second\nCircuit.\nagree so far as the issue of stigma is concerned -- that\nthe implication as reached by the Second Circuit is\ncorrect, that is, that every person on this list is more\nlikely than the average person to be currently dangerous.\nWe think that implication is true. Every bit of\ninformation on this registry, in fact, is concededly true.\nAnd there is differentiation among the different\nregistrants. The differentiation occurs by the offense;\nthat is, the information that is listed as to when the\noffense occurred, the nature of the offense, the number of\noffenses enables the public, having this information\naccessible and available, to make judgments about whether\nthat individual in fact may be dangerous. And of\ncourse --\nQUESTION: May I ask you a question about your\nsystem? Last year we had a case that came, I think, from\nKansas, McKune, involving whether a person had to -- could\nbe, in effect, compelled to go into a sex offender\nprogram. Does your -- and that -- presumably the -- those\ntreatment programs do some good in preventing recidivism.\nDoes -- does your reporting system give the convicted\noffender a chance to differentiate between whether he went\nthrough such a program and one who did not?\nMR. BLUMENTHAL: There is --\nQUESTION:\nthose two?\nMR. BLUMENTHAL: Justice Stevens, there is no\ncategory of information on the registration, as it's made\navailable to the public, about whether there has been\ntreatment. The information provided is very simply\naddress, identifying factors --\nQUESTION: So they treat one who had treatment\nand one who had no treatment exactly the same.\nMR. BLUMENTHAL: That is correct, so far as the\ninformation provided to the public is concerned. And the\nreason, if I may presume to say it, may be that the\neffectiveness of treatment may be problematic, and the\nsame is true with hearings on dangerousness. The\nunreliability of these hearings has been a very, very\nsubstantial problem, and the kind of information that may\ncome to the public from such hearings or from information\nabout treatment may be as misleading as it is accurate in\nmany instances.\nQUESTION: Would you -- would you agree that\nthere is at least some subclass of cases here in which the\nnon-dangerousness could be shown in a way that probably\nwas highly accurate and did not involve the -- the\ndifficulties that you raise?\nWhat I've got in mind is this. The -- the\ncategories of individuals who are listed under the\nConnecticut statute include young men who as teenagers had\nintercourse with younger teenage girls. No one, by normal\nstandards of English usage, would say at the age of 25\nthat -- that a -- a young man like that is dangerous in\nany sense that we would associate dangerousness with --\nviolent sex acts and things of that sort. So there seems\nto be a -- a category, not merely a set of individuals who\nmay prove they're not dangerous, but a category that is\npresumptively not dangerous in the sense that the others\nare. And yet, there is no way for them, in effect, to --\nto get themselves declared ineligible for the -- for the\nstigmatization that -- that goes on.\nWhy isn't there a due process problem that is\nlegitimately raised as at least to a category like that?\nMR. BLUMENTHAL: There -- there is, in fact,\nJustice Souter, a category of the registrants who are\nexcepted for the -- a -- a category of convicted offenders\nwho are excepted from the registry if, for example, they\nare 18 or younger and they commit statutory rape, if the\nvictim is 13 to 16 years old. There are exceptions for\nmaking accessible to the public information --\nQUESTION: What do -- what do they have to do to\nget the exception?\nMR. BLUMENTHAL: At the time of sentencing, that\nfinding is made by the sentencing court, or later, that\nthat kind of registration is not required by public\nsafety.\nQUESTION: What about the ones who have already\nbeen sentenced? In other words, the -- the -- sort of the\ncarryover class that you pick up the minute the statute\ngoes into effect? I mean, these -- these are the ones who\nare the -- raising in -- in the prior case, the ones who\nare raising the ex post facto kind of claim. What do you\ndo about them?\nMR. BLUMENTHAL: The -- the legislature has made\na determination that certain -- under certain\ncircumstances, the crime is not registrable, that is,\nthere is no requirement for registration. In certain\ninstances unquestionably, Justice Souter --\nQUESTION: Well, but take -- take -- simply take\nthe case as an example. The 19-year-old boy the --\nwhatever it is -- 14-year-old girl have intercourse.\nIs -- is that person, if convicted prior to the date of\nthe statute, subject to exception from the listing, and --\nand how --\nMR. BLUMENTHAL: They -- they could go back to\nthe sentencing court. There is a provision --\nQUESTION: I see.\nMR. BLUMENTHAL: -- that someone who would fit\nthe exceptions can go back to the sentencing court.\nQUESTION: Does this -- does this category fit?\nLet's take -- those ages will do fine, 19 and 14. Does\nthat fit within an excepted category?\nMR. BLUMENTHAL: I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg.\nI'm -- I'm not sure that I followed the -- the specific\nclass that Justice Souter was referencing.\nQUESTION: You said that there are certain\ncategories of people who can be exempted from that, and I\nasked if the hypothetical that Justice Souter raised --\nthat particular hypothetical -- fits within that exempted\nor excepted class.\nMR. BLUMENTHAL: I believe that it could.\nQUESTION: It doesn't on my list here. What it\nsays here -- I mean, maybe I'm wrong in the statute which\nmy law clerk looked up. She's usually right. And it's\nthat you -- you get into the exception to go back to the\nsentencing court if you committed the sexual intercourse\nwhen you were under the age of 19 with a victim between 13\nto 16 and you were 2 years older.\nSo I think that -- that Justice Souter's\nhypothetical was purposely created --\nQUESTION: Nineteen.\nQUESTION: -- so they didn't fit within that\nexception. And -- and I -- I suspect that we can find a\nlarge number of people who would be convicted of statutory\nrape who don't fit within this exception and who are,\ntherefore, thrown in. And I think the point of his\nquestion -- it would -- certainly would be mine -- is what\nabout those people.\nMR. BLUMENTHAL: And -- and that question really\nis the more fundamental issue about legislative line\ndrawing and unquestionably --\nQUESTION: Well, before we get to line drawing,\nI misunderstood your response to me I guess. What is the\nanswer? Are those people in my hypothetical exempted or\ndo they have a process by which they can be exempted or\nnot?\nMR. BLUMENTHAL: Maybe I should --\nQUESTION: Justice Breyer understands that they\nwould not be exempted from listing. And I -- I guess --\nIs he right or isn't he?\nMR. BLUMENTHAL: I -- I believe that probably\nthey would not be exempted, although they could go back to\nthe sentencing court, and determine whether the\ncircumstances of that hypothetical and -- and -- I'm\nnot --\nQUESTION: But what is the category?\nMR. BLUMENTHAL: But I had in mind all --\nQUESTION: What is the category, General\nBlumenthal, in which such a person might go back? There\nseem to be rather precise categories that are excepted\nwith an age range, and if you fall outside that age range,\nthere doesn't seem to be built into this scheme any\ndiscretionary exercises.\nMR. BLUMENTHAL: That is correct, Justice\nGinsburg. And someone who was not within the exemption --\nand -- the hypothetical may put that person outside it --\ncould not go back. The -- the legislature has drawn that\nline, and it's done so because it has to draw lines\nsomewhere and has imposed that classification because it's\njudged it to be in the public interest to do so.\nQUESTION: Let's assume -- you know, we accept\nthe fact that line drawing has to be done and so do the\npeople on the other side of the case. Their claim is that\nthe fact is we've got at least some category which we can\nidentify on a categorical basis which is being stigmatized\nas dangerous for a period of -- I guess, a minimum of 10\nyears. And all they're asking for is a way out. They're\nnot even claiming that you affirmatively have got to make\na proof of dangerousness in the first instance with\nrespect to those. They are saying, as a matter of\nprocedural due process, there ought to be a way out and\nthere is none. That's not to contest line drawing. That\nis to contest the fact that the State could let them have\nthe burden of getting out, and the State still won't do\nit.\nWhat is the justification?\nMR. BLUMENTHAL: The justification is that the\ninformation that is put on the registry is accurate. The\nstigma, if there is any stigma, results from the\nconviction of that offense, and --\nQUESTION: No. That is not -- I don't think\nthat's their argument. Their argument is not that they\nare -- are being subject to a stigma for 10 years because\nthey were convicted. They are being subject to a stigma\nfor 10 years because the State of Connecticut is saying\nthrough the Internet in -- in effect, that they are\ncurrently dangerous. That's the stigma, not the\nconviction, the current state of dangerousness which is\nstigmatizing.\nMR. BLUMENTHAL: With all due respect, Justice\nSouter, the court of appeals did not find that the fact of\nbeing on the registry means that every individual is\nsubject to that stigma.\nQUESTION: No. What it means is what you have\njust -- to begin with, what you just stipulated, that in\nfact there is a higher probability, a -- a greater risk\nof -- of dangerousness. But if, in fact, there is no\nmeans of differentiation for any one person on the\nregister, then that probability judgment is going to be\napplied in the public mind, naturally, to every person on\nthat unless there is a way to establish an exemption.\nMR. BLUMENTHAL: There is differentiation\ninsofar as the crime itself is listed.\nQUESTION: There is, and yet the very fact that\nthe State chooses to list that crime is a clear indication\nthat the State thinks that people in that category of\ncrime deserve to be listed with others who are potentially\ndangerous. So the State's very categorical treatment, in\neffect, has said to the public, you can't draw any clear\ndistinctions based on the particular crimes that we'll\nalso inform you of. You've already made the categorical\njudgment.\nQUESTION: Mr. Blumenthal, may I ask you whether\nthis statute has helped in any way in reducing sex crimes\nin Connecticut?\nMR. BLUMENTHAL: We -- we can't really say,\nJustice O'Connor, at this point because the Internet\navailability has been suspended by order of the court.\nAll of this information --\nQUESTION: How long was it in effect?\nMR. BLUMENTHAL: It was in effect for a couple\nof years, and even then it was too early to make a\njudgment as to whether or not it was having any\ndiscernible effect statistically, and there's nothing in\nthe record on that point.\nI -- I should report that there are now about\n3,000 registrants and some 500 approximately have been\nconvicted again of a registrable offense.\nThe point here is, though, that all of this\ninformation is public record information. The requirement\nand the obligation for registration existed before 1998.\nIn fact, it began in 1994. So no status or right was\naltered. And the registration requirement really is\nseparate from how the information is made available to the\npublic, and that goes to the Paul v. Davis issue.\nAnd with your permission, Mr. Chief Justice, I'd\nlike to reserve the balance of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, General Blumenthal.\nMr. -- General Olson, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nGeneral Blumenthal conveyed three very important\naspects of this case in his opening sentence. In essence,\nhe said the people of Connecticut seek access to\nconcededly truthful, public record and otherwise public\navailable information concerning convicted sex offenders.\nThese individuals have no constitutional right to conceal\nthese public truths from interested public citizens.\nThe Second Circuit examined the registry and\nsaid not only is the information about every individual\nconcededly true, but the registry -- and this is set out\nverbatim in page 6 of Connecticut's -- the blue brief.\nThe Department of Public Safety has not considered or\nassessed the specific risk of re-offense of any individual\nprior to his or her inclusion within this registry and has\nmade no determination that any individual included in the\nregistry is currently dangerous.\nQUESTION: That's what it says on the registry\nor on the Internet?\nMR. OLSON: Exactly.\nQUESTION: But you could skip that entirely.\nYou get -- this is on the -- it's not listed -- I can go\nto the Internet and go directly to the person. This\ninformation -- this disclaimer -- is not associated with\nthe individual offender listing. It's -- it's stuck in\nthe middle of a bunch of stuff before.\nMR. OLSON: Well, that's true, Justice Ginsburg.\nIt is not repeated for every name in the registry, but\nit's clearly set forth in the registry itself. It's put\nin italics.\nAnd the -- and the State goes on to say,\nindividuals included within the registry are included\nsolely by virtue of their conviction record and State law.\nThe main purpose of providing the -- this data on the\nInternet is to make the information more easily accessible\nand available, not to warn about any specific\nindividual --\nQUESTION: Well, except for the fact that --\nthat the -- the State has made a judgment and it doesn't\ndeny it, that individuals who have been convicted of\ncrimes in the categories subject to the law, are as a\ncategorical matter more likely to commit them in the\nfuture. They are more likely to be dangerous than the\ngeneral population. And so it's true. The State does\nnot, in its register, say, and by the way, this John Doe\nis especially dangerous. But the State can't deny that\nit's saying this John Doe is part of the category that we\nthink dangerous enough to list through the Internet.\nMR. OLSON: Well, what they do say is that the\npublic is entitled to and should make specific judgments\nabout specific individuals.\nQUESTION: But it can't. I mean, it cannot do\nthat on the -- on the basis of what the State puts out\nbecause all it knows, from what the State puts out, is the\ncategory the person falls into.\nMR. OLSON: Precisely.\nwere making earlier, Justice Souter, is that there are\ndifferent types of crimes that may be of interest to\ndifferent individuals. If you have small --\nQUESTION: All -- all of which, however, are\nregarded as being within some -- above some threshold of\ndangerousness or they wouldn't be listed on the Internet.\nMR. OLSON: Because they are -- they are\nresponding to the people's request in 50 States -- and the\npeople of the United States through the Congress -- to\nmake information available to us about people who have\nbeen convicted of sex crimes.\nQUESTION: I'll grant you that, but have the\npeople of the 50 States also said, and we don't want there\nto be any way out for someone who can prove that he is\neither non-dangerous or -- or in a category which is\nhighly -- which is much less likely to be dangerous?\nMR. OLSON: Well --\nQUESTION: I mean, if the people said there's no\nescape?\nMR. OLSON: If -- if -- there -- that's -- the\nFederal statute allows the State to exercise judgment with\nrespect to the use of its resources with respect to this\npublic record, truthful information.\nNow, the State of Connecticut -- the question\nthat you're raising, it seems to me, falls squarely within\nthe concept of a substantive due process challenge, not\na --\nQUESTION: Well, but isn't it -- it's also\nsquarely within procedural due process. The -- the State\nis saying you're putting a label on me, and that's okay if\nyou give me a way to get out of it.\nMR. OLSON: But the State --\nQUESTION: That's a procedural due process\nchallenge.\nMR. OLSON: The label that the State is putting\non is that you have been convicted of a sex crime and that\nthe -- and you must draw -- we have not decided that you\nare dangerous.\nQUESTION: No, but that's where -- I mean, I\nthink that's where the -- the -- we're not sort of meeting\neach other in the argument. The State does say that much.\nNo question about it. But by this categorized treatment,\nthe State is saying something further. The State is\nsaying people in these categories are likely to be more\ndangerous. It's a -- it's the second statement that is\nthe gravamen of the problem that we've got here, not the\ntruthful first statement.\nMR. OLSON: Well, the -- the Court has said\nrepeatedly that the -- this Court will examine challenges\nwith respect to the -- the -- in that category on a\nsubstantive due process basis if the classification is\nreasonable --\nQUESTION: Well, that's -- that's right there,\nbut that is not the challenge that's being made. There's\nno challenge being made here that the State cannot have a\nregister -- or a register that is -- is structured by\ncategory. The challenge that's being made here is that if\nyou do that, there should be a due -- there should be a\nprocedural mechanism for somebody who can show that he's\nnot dangerous to get out. That isn't substantive due\nprocess.\nMR. OLSON: Well, and -- and our submission is\nthat the determination -- and this Court has stated it as\nrecently -- recently as a year ago that sex offenders are\nmore likely to be recidivists than other categories of\nindividuals, but that that does not mean, Connecticut goes\non to say, that any individual is necessarily dangerous.\nThat classification is rational.\nNow, it is also rational for Connecticut to have\ndetermined, as it did, that we'll accord opportunities for\npeople to address in -- in certain circumstances the\nnature of their conviction. But it's also rational for --\nQUESTION: General Olson, can I ask you a\nbroader question? Do you think it would be permissible\nfor Connecticut to require every person in the category to\nwear a badge that recited the information that goes on the\nInternet?\nMR. OLSON: We think that that would be a very\ndifficult situation, Justice Stevens, in that -- the --\nand -- and I would be concerned about that. But --\nQUESTION: Why? What's wrong with that?\nMR. OLSON: Well, because that requires the\nindividual to carry that notification himself to convey\nthe government's message.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. OLSON: It also requires that message to be\nbrought into every situation that the individual is\ninvolved in. The Internet is a reasonable and relative --\nminimally intrusive way of responding to a question that a\ncitizen may ask of a State and to which the citizen is\nentitled to an answer. The citizen here has to ask the\nquestion. It isn't carried around with the individual\neverywhere the individual goes.\nAnd this is public record information. As one\nof the questions in the earlier argument implied, if a\nprivate citizen -- Cox Broadcasting, for example --\ndecided to make this information available to the public,\nit would be -- have an absolute constitutional right to do\nso. It seems anomalous to suggest that the State of\nConnecticut cannot impart to its citizens the same\ninformation that Cox Broadcasting would have an absolute\nconstitutional right to do so. It seems to us --\nQUESTION: But nobody is -- nobody is saying it\ncan't. Nobody is saying Connecticut can't do this. All\nthey're saying is if Connecticut does it, they've got to\ngive us an -- an escape hatch.\nMR. OLSON: Well, it seems to me, Justice\nSouter, that that conflicts directly with what the Court\nsaid in Paul versus Davis, that in the first place, there\nis not defamation here because it's a truthful imparting\nof information.\nQUESTION: If -- if there is no potential for a\ndefamatory or stigmatizing statement, then there is no\ncase. I agree with you. But simply to say there's no\ndefamation here is -- is, with respect, it seems to me, to\ntry to avoid the question.\nMR. OLSON: Well, I don't think it is, but --\nbut even if it were defamation, it is not -- there is no\nstigma plus, as this Court required in Paul versus Davis.\nThere's no confinement of liberty. There's no denial of\nany individual on this list of a right to a job --\nQUESTION: Is there stigma plus in Justice\nStevens' hypothetical, wearing the badge?\nMR. OLSON: There may well be.\nQUESTION:\ncreating a -- in effect, a subclass of citizens who have\ngot to go through quarterly registration possibly for the\nrest of their lives?\nMR. OLSON: It -- it -- we submit that that is a\nminimal, reasonable way for the State to keep track of\npeople who have committed crimes and then --\nQUESTION: But, General Olson, suppose you look\nat it as a stigma minus. What about the hypothetical I\nasked earlier about somebody who took -- a convicted felon\nwho took the -- the treatment program and survived it and\none who did not? They're treated alike in this system.\nMR. OLSON: Yes, they are because the State has\nmade a determination, as have 49 other States and\nCongress, that the people are entitled to certain public\nrecord information. That does not apply --\nQUESTION: But it's -- it's incomplete\ninformation as to some.\nMR. OLSON: It's -- well, it is -- it is\nincomplete information as to everyone, we submit. But it\ndoes -- it is complete information with respect to whether\nindividuals have been convicted of a sex crime. That is\npublic information. That is information to which the\ncitizens are entitled.\nThank you.\nQUESTION:\nMs. Sadin, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SHELLEY R. SADIN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMS. SADIN: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the\nCourt:\nIn the eyes of a concerned public, every person\nposted on Connecticut's Megan's Law list poses a serious\nthreat to the public, particularly to children. The\npublic knows that Megan's Law is named for --\nQUESTION: You -- you state that as a fact,\nMs. Sadin. What is the -- what is the record support for\nthat statement?\nMS. SADIN: Petitioners themselves have\nstated --\nQUESTION: I'm asking you -- Ms. Sadin, I'm\nasking you what is the record support for the statement\nyou just made?\nMS. SADIN: That -- that the public knows this\nis a Megan's Law list?\nQUESTION: That -- that the public knows that --\nwhat -- that they're -- that they're dangerous.\nMS. SADIN: The -- the message of dangerousness\ncomes from a number of sources, Your Honor. The first is\nthat the purpose of this law, the declared purpose of this\nlaw, repeated by petitioners and repeated by the lawmakers\nwho passed it, is to protect the public from recidivist\nsex offenders, and particularly to protect the children\nfrom such offenders.\nThe law is administered and the registry is both\nput together and published by the State police. The State\npolice on the website state that it is their mission to\nprevent crime and protect the public.\nQUESTION: But they also say that it -- it --\nthey're not saying that anyone is dangerous on that same\nwebsite, don't they?\nMS. SADIN: They don't actually. The disclaimer\ndoes not say that everybody is not dangerous. What the\ndisclaimer says is that no dangerousness assessment is\nmade with respect to any individual.\nQUESTION: Well, why isn't that good enough?\nMS. SADIN: It isn't good enough because all it\nsays is what we already know, which is that nobody has\nbeen assessed for dangerous or not. And it's contradicted\nby the repeatedly emphasized message to the public, which\npetitioners themselves stressed so urgently below, that\nthe purpose of this law is to publish current, monitored\ninformation taken from offenders so that it can be posted\non the Internet so the public will know what they look\nlike and where they live at all times. That sends a very\ncompelling message.\nQUESTION: But that's not -- that's not -- I\nthink what I took the Chief Justice is asking -- I took --\nand I'd have a similar question, that -- that their\nresponse I think to the point that I was trying to make\nwith Justice Souter, that maybe this is overly broad\nbecause let's imagine the 19-year-old who simply had\nintercourse once with a much younger woman and obviously\nis no danger. Their response is, first, it says to the\npublic, consider every case on the merits. We're not\nsaying whether it's dangerous or not.\nSecond, when the people in the neighborhood to\nwhich the individual has moved look him up on the Net,\nthey'll see what he did, and people aren't idiots.\nThey'll understand that this is there because he fell\nwithin the law.\nAnd besides that, they say, it's too difficult\nfor us to draw finer lines. At least the legislature\nreasonably so could conclude.\nSo the question I had is, is there any objective\nevidence that people do cause mistake -- the significance\nof this 19- or 20-year-old boy having his name there? Are\nwe just doing that because we all know -- in quotes -- or\nis there evidence of it?\nMS. SADIN: There were -- the -- the court --\nthe district court's decision and the court of appeals\ndecision that affirmed it were based on rule 9(c)\nstatements, undisputed facts on summary judgment, and they\nincluded the fact that this is commonly known as a Megan's\nLaw. There's no disputing that. Everybody in this\ncountry knows that Megan's Law was passed in response to\nthe rape and murder of a child victim. That is the\ngenesis of these laws, and it's undisputed that that's how\nthe public understands them.\nAlso not in dispute is that it is the\ndepartment --\nQUESTION: Well, the public also understands\nthat official records have to be interpreted in different\nways. We've said that in -- in prior decisions of this\nCourt. When there's a notice on the police bulletin board\nand the press publishes it, it says what it says.\nMS. SADIN: Except that these --\nQUESTION: This -- if -- if you have sort of a\nFirst Amendment argument you're concerned with here, it --\nit seems to me that you're arguing at cross purposes to\nour precedents.\nMS. SADIN: As I understand your question, if --\nthe problem is that it is not just truthful, already\npublic information. The list does not just include\nsomeone's conviction. It also includes a current\nphotograph and a current address --\nQUESTION: Is that not truthful?\nMS. SADIN: The current photograph and the\ncurrent -- it is not because the message that it conveys\nis that this is a person who is being watched and\nmonitored, who must, at risk of felony conviction --\nQUESTION: Well, what is the constitutional\nbasis for your argument? Could we move to that? I mean,\nyou're here on a constitutional claim, and I'm not sure\nwhat it is, to tell you the truth.\nMS. SADIN: It is that there is an established\nliberty interest in -- in a government impose -- in\navoiding a government-imposed stigma, which is not just\ngovernment name-calling.\nQUESTION: Well, how does some liberty interest\nand reputation survive the Paul versus Davis case?\nMS. SADIN: But it is more than a liberty\ninterest and reputation. This is a government-imposed\nstigma which is -- it's part and parcel of the regulations\nthat are imposed on people. The information posted on the\nregistry is extracted from registrants. On pain of felony\nconviction, they must --\nQUESTION: Can -- can a truthful statement be\nstigmatizing?\nMS. SADIN: This is not a truthful statement.\nQUESTION:\ntruthful statement cannot be stigmatizing?\nMS. SADIN: No. A truthful statement can also\nbe stigmatizing, but -- but it's not --\nQUESTION: Is that consistent with Paul versus\nDavis?\nMS. SADIN: I think Paul versus Davis requires\nthat there be a -- as there is in this case, a false\nstigma.\nAnd I think we have to go back to the\nunderstanding and the basis of this law. This is a law\nwhich was designed to -- and the public knows it was\ndesigned to -- protect the public from dangerous,\nrecidivist offenders, and that is not true with respect to\nmany of the people, perhaps most of the people -- we don't\nknow -- who are on this list. Not only --\nQUESTION: A danger -- potentially dangerous.\nI mean, the government doesn't have to make a -- a rock-\nsolid assessment that these people are dangerous. Why\nisn't it enough for the government to say this is a\ncategory of people who may be dangerous?\nMS. SADIN: The government says --\nQUESTION: And is that true? It is perfectly\ntrue. Can the public act on it? If it wants to, it can;\nif it doesn't want to, it doesn't have to. It may make\nfurther assessment of whether, indeed, the may is -- is\nclose enough or -- or -- but -- I don't know why you\ninsist on saying that the -- that the State has said these\npeople are dangerous. It seems to me, even without the\ndisclaimer, the most the State has said is that these\npeople may be dangerous.\nMS. SADIN: The State says -- with respect, the\nState says more, but even if it said that these -- that\nthese people may be more dangerous than other people, that\ntoo reduces people in the eyes -- in the eyes of the\npublic. It causes people to, as any injury to reputation\nwould, not want to hire them, not -- want to avoid them,\nnot want to live in the same neighborhoods with them.\nAnd this Court, with respect to whether or not\nthere are statistics which show that this -- that some\nsubgroup of sex offenders are more likely to recidivate,\nthis Court has never relied just on statistical\ninformation to make dangerousness assessments about\nindividuals, even in the context --\nQUESTION: Suppose this -- this same information\nwas on the -- on the Internet through some private service\nand I got into the Internet, and I said I don't want to\nlive next to -- to this person. That is my judgment that\nI can make --\nMS. SADIN: Well, there are two points --\nQUESTION:\nMS. SADIN: There are two points with respect to\nthat, Your Honor. First of all, a private citizen would\nnot have the power, as the government does, to obtain\ncurrent -- to require people to register current\nphotographs and current addresses for posting, and there\nis not the same government-imposed imprimatur. These are\npeople who are being watched. We are requiring them to\nprovide this information to us on a regular basis. We\nadvertise on the website that we keep this information as\nupdated as possible in -- in furtherance of the Department\nof Public Safety's declared mission of protecting the\npublic and preventing crime. All -- the entire context of\nthis registry and the purpose of the law sends the\nineluctable message that the people who are posted pose a\npresent threat to the public.\nQUESTION: Let -- let me give you that. What's\nbothering me -- and it may be I'm just missing something,\nbut if I am, I've missed it for a long, long time.\nWhat has this to do with the procedural due\nprocess claim? I'll -- I'll say that my reason for\ndoubting that it does is first there is -- there are some\nlaws that are so basic that they're not written anywhere,\nnot even in our cases. What I used to say was one of them\nis you don't ever have to have a hearing if there's\nnothing to have a hearing about.\nto have a hearing about as far as the statute is\nconcerned. These people concede they were convicted of\nsexually violent offenses.\nTo make the same point differently, give your\nclients all the procedures they want, every procedure in\nthe world, and let's suppose they prove they're absolutely\nnot dangerous. Still, they were convicted of a sexually\nviolent offense. So it wasn't the lack of procedure that\ncaused the problem. It was the fact that in your view the\nConstitution of the United States does not permit the\nState of Connecticut to turn these consequences upon being\na sexually violent offender. That's a different argument,\nand the only kind of clause I've ever seen that would make\nthat constitutionally impermissible is the Due Process\nClause in its substantive sense.\nAnd my point is not simply a technical point,\nfor if you had focused on the argument, there would be a\nrecord that would answer questions like the Chief\nJustice's. You would have been forced to create a record\nthat would have gone into all the State's reasons and what\nempirical data there was, whether this was justified or\nnot.\nThat's a long question. But I'd -- it's at the\nroot of what's bothering me.\nMS. SADIN:\nthink -- let me see if I can respond to it sufficiently.\nWe are not asking -- first of all, let me begin\nby saying the reason we don't consider it to be a\nsubstantive due process analysis is that we're not trying\nto expand the scope of the due process law to -- to\nrecognize some liberty that is not already recognized.\nThere is an interest in reputation if it is coupled with\nthe kinds of restrictions that are imposed by this law.\nPeople cannot -- literally cannot -- remain at liberty if\nthey do not report what they look like and where they live\nto the State. They will be prosecuted for a felony. They\ncannot move without advising the State that they are doing\nso. They cannot even leave the State for temporary\nperiods, if they're of -- of a substantial period of time,\nwithout telling the State. They literally cannot remain\nat liberty without performing these functions which are\nnot required of any other citizen.\nQUESTION: -- in finding a liberty interest\nhere. After all, he has to give DNA. He has to give his\nfingerprints. That isn't my problem. I'll give you all\nthe liberty interest you want.\nMy -- I don't want to repeat what I said. You\ntook it in all right. Right?\nMS. SADIN: I think so.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMS. SADIN: And let -- let me try to address it\nnow if I haven't done it yet.\nEven if there were -- now, as I understand, Your\nHonor, you're saying that -- that even if there were\nnarrower categories, if we were to limit this to people\nwho were more dangerous and isn't overbroad, there weren't\nthat -- that kind of issue, there still is the problem\nbecause it is a procedural due process issue whether a\nparticular person poses a present threat. That isn't\nsomething --\nQUESTION: I don't think that's the issue.\nI think the issue is the State says here's a list of\npeople who were convicted of sex offenses. Period.\nYou're telling us that this particular person is no longer\ndangerous. We say that's not relevant to our scheme.\nThere's only one thing that's relevant: was he or she\nconvicted? If he or she was convicted, you have nothing\nunder our scheme to be heard about because the only due\nprocess conviction -- the only due process hearing that\ncounts is the one that led up to the conviction.\nThat's -- that's the point, that you're saying my person\nis no longer dangerous. The State's answer is, under our\nscheme that's totally irrelevant. The only question is,\nwas this person convicted of a sex offense?\nMS. SADIN:\nwith that, Your Honor, is that the list does not just say\nthat the person was convicted of a sex offense.\nQUESTION: So now suppose -- that's -- what I'm\ntrying to find out what is your real argument. Suppose\nthe list said, not sex offender register, but register of\npersons convicted -- convicted sex offender list. It said\nthat. And then it put the disclaimer that we are making\nno judgment about this person's dangerousness right on\nthat web page with the picture, right on the page with the\nindividual's picture, and then it gave the offense of\nconviction, the date, the time served, and that's what was\npresented -- with that legend in bold face -- every time a\nuser goes to get a picture sees that warning of what the\nState's purpose is -- would you still have a procedural\ndue process claim?\nMS. SADIN: I would if -- I would if the current\nappearances and whereabouts of those people were also\nmonitored for the purpose of posting them on a list whose\nstated purpose is to protect the public. I would not have\na problem if it is simply an Internet version of\nconviction records. There is a fundamental difference\nbetween public records of conviction and the\ninformation --\nQUESTION: But then I don't get the link with\nthe hearing that you're asking for.\nhas -- anytime somebody's address is -- his current\naddress or place of employment -- is it a government\nrecord? They have a right to get that out? I'm not --\nI'm not sure I'm following what is the hearing that you're\nentitled to because the government supplies your current\naddress.\nMS. SADIN: The hearing that we're entitled\nto -- and it isn't -- it really is more than just current\naddress, although that is one aspect of it. Monitoring\naddress and photographs and posting it for the purpose of\nprotecting the public does send a message that they're\ndangerous.\nBut even if there -- if there were to be a -- a\nlist that simply reflected past conviction records, that\nwould not pose a problem. It isn't just the current\naddress. It is the combination of all of these things.\nIt is the context. This is a Megan's Law designed to\nprotect the public from recidivist child molesters. It\nis -- it posts people whose current appearances and\nwhereabouts are monitored, and the State tells the public\nthat they are monitored on the website itself. It says\nthat we provide this information and we keep it as current\nas -- as possible. It is the Department of Public Safety,\nthe State police, who post the information beneath their\nprominently displayed mission statement that it is their\njob in life to protect the public from -- from crime.\nQUESTION: Well, Ms. Sadin, I don't know if the\nFBI does it anymore. I think they used to put out a 10\nMost Wanted list of the most dangerous offenders. Now,\ncould one of the people on that list have demanded a\nhearing to say he didn't belong on it?\n(Laughter.)\nMS. SADIN: There's a fundamental distinction\nbetween them because -- think about it, Your Honor.\nThe -- the 10 Most Wanted list is the result of an\ninvestigation that focuses on a particular individual and\nthere are exigent circumstances. It's not just a roundup\nof -- of the usual suspects. It does focus on a\nparticular person. And that person does not have, by the\nway, the 10-year to life continued reporting requirements\nbased on past conduct. It will be processed --\nQUESTION: Well, no, but he -- he's going to\nhave to be on the watch for police.\nMS. SADIN: Well, he may be but -- but consider\nwhen that person, even if he committed a violent crime,\nis -- is arrested and when a bond hearing is heard, the\nrecidivism statistics for this kind of crime, this\nperson's past conviction record even, will not be the sole\ndeterminants and determine what -- what allows him to be\nreleased. It will be --\nQUESTION: Well, he hasn't -- he hasn't even\nbeen convicted of a crime. Somebody who's on that list.\nI mean, it seems to me he's in a much better position\nthan -- than your clients. As far as anybody knows, he's\ntotally innocent, and the FBI puts him up there as the\nmost wanted without a hearing. Your clients have had a\nhearing. They've been found to -- to be guilty.\nThey're -- it seems to me they're in much worse shape than\nsomebody on the FBI list.\nMS. SADIN: The person on the FBI list has yet\nto have a hearing on whether or not he was the person who\ncommitted the crime, and presumably, Your Honor, if he\nwere not and if there were false information that -- that\nled to his arrest, he would have a claim for -- for false\narrest.\nQUESTION: Exactly. But just putting him --\nputting his face out there tells the public, does it not,\nthis is a dangerous person you ought to be on the lookout\nfor. He hasn't had any hearing on that.\nMS. SADIN: Yes, but he will. And there is at\nleast some individual assessment, an individual\ninvestigation. That hasn't happened with respect to the\npeople on my list.\nQUESTION: Why do you have to have an\nindividual -- I would -- if you were arguing the\nsubstantive due process argument, which it's clear by now\nis what I think the right category is --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: -- you'd have the person who was in\nJustice Souter's example and he would come in and say, it\nviolates the Constitution to apply this statute to me. At\nleast give me a hearing.\nBut that's not who you're representing. You're\nrepresenting a class of people, including the -- the 19\nmost dangerous sexual offenders in all of Connecticut.\nAnd you're saying as to them the Constitution requires a\nhearing and the State responds, what are you talking\nabout? First, they're very dangerous. Second, they've\nall been convicted of crimes. Third, a hearing will be a\nwaste of time as to them and simply delay the\nimplementation of the statute and a lot of other arguments\nbesides. And anyway -- all right. I'm just making up all\ntheir arguments, but what is your response as to them?\nMS. SADIN: Yes. Yes. Your Honor has asked an\neven longer question, so let me try again.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. SADIN: It -- even -- first of all, this is\na very broad statute. It does not cover just the most\ndangerous offenders. Obviously it covers people who have\nbeen convicted of nonviolent crimes, been sentenced to\nprobation, been sentenced to unconditional release. It\ncovers the teenagers about which there has been some\ndiscussion. And by the way, some of those teenagers can\nget off and some of them --\nQUESTION: I'm not being clear. I know that.\nI'm saying that if they were arguing substance, those\npeople could make the argument on their own. Don't we\nhave to consider you in terms of the 19 worst?\nMS. SADIN: Even with respect to -- even with\nrespect to the 19 worst, it still remains an individual\ndetermination whether a person poses a threat. That\nperson could have a --\nQUESTION: No, but excuse me. Are you claiming\nthat there's got to be a determination in advance before\nthe person can be put on the register, or are you claiming\nthat a person who is on the register who claims to be non-\ndangerous should be allowed a hearing to get off it?\nMS. SADIN: I'm saying -- well, this is a -- the\nregistry is systematic. It's not as though it's any\nsurprise --\nQUESTION: Never mind -- what is your position?\nMS. SADIN: It is a --\nQUESTION: Has there got to be a hearing in\nadvance before the name goes on?\nMS. SADIN:\nnot before the person registers, but before the person is\npublicly -- yes, before the person is publicly posted.\nAnd that is true even with respect --\nQUESTION: With the burden on the government\nto -- I want to get the full dimensions of your position.\nThe registry is all right, I gather. There was no\ninjunction against the registry. The registry remains in\nplace. So you're attacking only the notification.\nMS. SADIN: Yes.\nQUESTION: And your position on the notification\nis not simply that a person should have an opportunity to\nshow that he or she should escape from this list, but that\nthe government has the burden before it puts -- posts\nanybody to show that that person is currently dangerous.\nIs that your position?\nMS. SADIN: No. I am saying that there has to\nbe notice that you will be posted and an opportunity to be\nheard on whether or not you belong to the very small class\nof people who deserve to be posted. And again, we're\nnot -- the reason --\nQUESTION: Well, let's take the category of\nviolent sex offenders. They're on the registry. You\ndon't dispute that. They're there. Everyone is on the\nregistry. Can that person, the most violent,\nautomatically be posted?\nMS. SADIN: No. And even under the Federal\nMegan's Law -- let me point out that even under the\nFederal Megan's Law -- that small category of people,\nsexually violent predators, are not allowed to -- must --\nmust have process before the government is allowed to\nmonitor them every 90 days, as everyone on Connecticut's\nregistry is done. There has to be a court finding that,\nin fact, those sexually violent predators fit within that\ncategory. And even with respect --\nQUESTION: So no one -- no one could be put\non --\nQUESTION: So what is the finding? That they\nhave to be likely to -- to offend again?\nMS. SADIN: The -- the finding is that they fit\nthe definition of -- there -- there are a number of\ncriteria and there are expert -- expert testimony is\nrequired, and so there are criteria.\nQUESTION: Those people could be confined under\nHendricks, and then the law serves no -- no purpose at\nall.\nMS. SADIN: But those -- there is not that kind\nof confinement law in Connecticut, but there certainly\nis -- there would have to be procedure in connection with\nthat. There was procedure in connection with Hendricks.\nThere has to be procedure in connection with the sexually\nviolent predators who are -- who are regulated in that way\nunder the -- under the Federal Megan's Law.\nAnd the point is this: Even with respect to\nthose people who have committed violent crimes, there are\ntreatment mechanisms. This Court recognized in McKune\nagainst Lile that -- that recidivism rates are\ndramatically reduced by people who receive treatment.\nIt is not difficult to provide these hearings.\nThere are dangerousness hearings done in every court in\nevery State. In Connecticut as well, there are\ndangerousness assessments conducted even within the\ncontext of this Megan's Law, Connecticut's Megan's Law, in\nconnection with exceptions and exemptions to registration.\nQUESTION: Maybe the people of Connecticut don't\ntrust those dangerousness hearings. Maybe the people of\nConnecticut say, I don't want to have to rely upon -- upon\nthe guesses of some psychiatrist. I do not want to live\nnext to somebody who has been convicted of a sexual --\nsexually predatory offense, and I don't care what the\npsychiatrists say. Now, can -- can the State of\nConnecticut accede to the wishes of the public who feel\nthat way about it?\nMS. SADIN: The State of Connecticut can accede\nto the wishes of the public to have conviction\ninformation.\nname. He can be looked up. The neighbor can see whether\nor not he has a prior conviction and can move if it\nwishes.\nBut the State of Connecticut does not have the\nright, without providing some individual process, some\nnotice and an opportunity to be heard, to tell the\nneighbor this is a person who is dangerous. We have the\nState police monitoring this person. He must report to us\nevery 90 days. If he does not return his address\nnotification, he will be arrested. This is somebody we\nare watching. This is somebody with respect to whom we\nare giving you this information.\nQUESTION: Well, what if -- what if it were a\nconviction, Ms. Sadin, he had been convicted, and instead\nof this program, it specified that he would be on parole\nfor 15 years with much the same restrictions? Would that\nmake it any different?\nMS. SADIN: It presents a different question.\nI mean, I don't know whether or not the --\nQUESTION: But I -- I know it's a different\nquestion or I wouldn't have asked you. But what --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: But what I -- what I want to know is,\nwould you treat it differently or would it be the same?\nMS. SADIN:\nconnection with the parole determination, the answer is\nno. That's the fundamental point. Even with respect\nto -- this Court, again, has never used statistics even\nthat -- even that apply to some subset to determine that\nan individual poses a present threat, the kind of serious\nthreat that the State of Connecticut repeatedly has said\nthat is posed by the people on this list. At -- at oral\nargument below, General Blumenthal argued that this was\ncrucial information which was necessary to protect the\npublic from -- from the kinds of dangers that -- that\noccurred in the Megan Kanka case.\nThis is not just a -- this is not a system of\ngovernment name-calling. It is a system of government-\nimposed stigma with requirements which preclude someone\nfrom remaining at liberty if they do not comply and if the\ninformation that -- and the information that they then\ngive up to the State, otherwise private, personal\ninformation, is posted on the Internet for the repeatedly-\ndeclared purpose of protecting the public from the people\nwho are posted.\nAnd again, the Federal Wetterling Act requires\nonly that relevant information be released that is\nnecessary to protect the public from a particular person.\nThat is why this is an individual --\nQUESTION:\nsomebody who changes his name?\nMS. SADIN: Excuse me?\nQUESTION: How does the statute work with\nsomeone who changes his name?\nMS. SADIN: If you change your address, if you\nchange your name, you must -- you must report to the\nState.\nQUESTION: If you change your address.\nMS. SADIN: If you change your address.\nQUESTION: But what if you change your name?\nMS. SADIN: You -- you -- I think you would have\nto report that too. I don't remember whether there's a\nparticular provision, but there -- there are provisions\nthat you must -- you must update your current address and\ninformation, and I -- I presume name is -- is the same.\nQUESTION: And I -- but if you change your\nappearance by shaving off your beard or something like\nthat, do they require reporting of that?\nMS. SADIN: It does actually, and you are\nrequired to submit to photographs whenever and wherever\nthe State tells you to and at least every 5 years. The\nanswer is yes. You cannot even leave the State for --\nfor, you know, any -- any substantial period of time\nwithout reporting -- without reporting that. And all of\nthis is on pain of felony conviction.\nthe underlying conviction which requires you to report\nwere a misdemeanor.\nAnd one more -- one final point. The hearings\nthat are -- about which the Attorney General says there is\nno reliability, not only are they conducted under the\nFederal Wetterling Act and in connection with the\nexemptions and exceptions under Connecticut's act, but\nthere are a number of States with already streamlined,\nwell-positioned systems who conduct these kinds of\nhearings and who provide process. There has been no\ncomplaint that those are unworkable systems. They are\nperformed -- the -- the -- less than half the States in\nthis country have categorical notification systems like\nConnecticut's.\nQUESTION: Citizens may not trust them.\nCitizens have seen too many of these hearings that result\nin the release of people who turn out to be dangerous.\nWhy -- why do you insist that the State must tell\ncitizens, we're not going to give you this information\nbecause we have determined that the person is -- is not\ndangerous and therefore you don't have to worry about it?\nMS. SADIN: But it isn't a question of just\ngiving the public truthful information. The issue is\ntelling the public that these are people who need to be\nmonitored.\ndangerous and they -- and you may not, but they are. That\nis why we are doing this to them. That's why we need to\nknow what they look like and where they live at all times,\nand you need to know what they look like and where they\nlive at all times. That sends -- that sends a very\ndifferent message from they may be or they may not be.\nThat says that they are.\nQUESTION: May I ask you to turn a little\nattention to what is the plus? Because it's hard for me\nto understand when you take the registry, you say is the\nplus, and yet, you don't challenge the registry and the\ndistrict court doesn't require any change whatever in the\nregistry. So how can something that you say you're not\nseeking to disturb or at least you're not challenging the\ndistrict court for not disturbing it is the plus?\nMS. SADIN: Because they are integrally related.\nRemember, my understanding of the stigma plus test is that\nit was meant to distinguish just plain defamation cases\nfrom those which really were Fourteenth Amendment claims\nbased on something the government was doing to you. The\nplus here is that the government requires you, on pain of\nfelony conviction, to provide the personal information\nthat then is published. It is an integral system. It\ncreates a new class of citizen, a second class of citizen,\nwhich has different obligations from other citizens and\nfrom which information, personal and otherwise private\ninformation, is extracted and then posted. Private\ncitizens do not have to tell the State where they live at\nall times. They don't have to tell the State when they\nare leaving. They don't have to provide photographs\nrepeatedly.\nQUESTION: Suppose we didn't have the posting,\nwe just had the register, and you had to tell those things\nthat you ordinarily wouldn't have to tell the State.\nMS. SADIN: It would be a different argument.\nThat -- that's the plus.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Sadin.\nGeneral Blumenthal, you have 4 minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD BLUMENTHAL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. BLUMENTHAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nFollowing Justice Ginsburg's question, there\nreally is no plus here. The point is the registry has not\nbeen challenged. The registry existed before the posting,\nthe publication, making this information available. It\nexists now. If the order were not in effect, even without\nthe requirement in the law that there be Internet\npublication, an ordinary citizen could do what The\nHartford Courant did and file an information -- Freedom of\nInformation request. The Internet requirement is like a\nFreedom of Information form of law, and it is unrelated in\nthe way that Paul v. Davis says it must be related to the\nsupposed stigma.\nEven if this Court were to find there's a\ndefamation -- and by the way, Connecticut law has never\nrecognized defamation by implication. But even if there\nwere, Paul v. Davis says that as a result of the action\ncomplained of, a right or status recognized previously\nunder State law must be distinctly altered or\nextinguished.\nIn this instance, there was no pre-existing\nright not to register. In fact, individuals -- sex\noffenders were required to register, and that obligation\ncontinues to exist afterward. And so what this Court\nwould do by accepting the Second Circuit's decision is, in\neffect, to constitutionalize tort law in the way that it\nhas declined to do in Paul v. Davis, Siegert v. Gilley,\nwhere again it insisted on some causal link between the\ndefamation and the supposed loss of right and status. And\nthat is utterly lacking here.\nThe supposed harms -- there's nothing in the\nrecord about housing, employment, any other harm that\nresults from this supposed stigma, and the stigma itself,\nto go to the Chief Justice's question, has to be false in\norder to constitute defamation. This Court said so in\nCodd v. Velger, and that is plainly not true here because\nall of this information, particularly as to the convicted\noffense, is absolutely truthful and leaves to\nConnecticut's citizens to make the judgment about whether\nor not it indicates dangerousness.\nThe disclaimer -- to clear one other point --\nvery specifically says not only that no assessment has\nbeen made, but also that the publication or inclusion of\nthis individual on the website and on the registry is not\nto be deemed a judgment or a conclusion that this person\nis dangerous. There's a specific disclaimer as to\ndangerousness.\nBut even without it, we would contend there's no\nstigma because all of this information is very simply\npublic record information, and under Siegert v. Gilley\nparticularly, there is no sufficient link between the\nsupposed stigma and any loss of right or status. There\nsimply is no plus here as this Court has interpreted it to\nexist and must exist under the standard that this Court\nhas set forth.\nWe would respectfully submit that at the very\nleast, the plus, or the loss of right or change of status\nmust arise out of the same action or flow from it in some\nway.\naccurately and truthfully on the registry does not in any\nway cause the registration. It does not result from the\nregistration. The registration continues to exist now and\nwould continue to exist even after the Internet is taken\noff -- is -- come down because of the court order.\nSo we respectfully submit that the court should\nbe reversed. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, General\nBlumenthal.\n"
