        "content": "(10:03 a.m.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We'll now hear argument in\nAlaska against the United States.\nMr. Franklin.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. FRANKLIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF\nMR. FRANKLIN: Justice Stevens, and may it\nplease the Court:\nBecause title to lands underlying navigable\nwaters is an inseparable attribute of State sovereignty,\nthis Court has long held that there is a strong\npresumption that each State receives title to such lands\nat statehood. Under the Court's precedents, the United\nStates cannot defeat the State's title unless Congress has\ndefinitely declared an intention to do so or has otherwise\nmade that intention very plain.\nTurning to the Glacier Bay claim in this case,\nthe United States asserts that it received title to the\nsubmerged lands underlying the bay at statehood, but there\nis no express statement, an unambiguous statement by\nCongress evidencing an intent to defeat Alaska's title.\nTo the contrary, the proviso to section 6(e) of\nthe Alaska Statehood Act, which is the only statute the\nUnited States identifies as ratifying the purported\nreservation of the bay, in fact shows that title remains\nwith Alaska. Under the plain language of the statute, the\nproviso applies only to a subset of the lands that would\notherwise have been transferred to the State under the\nmain clause. And this is important. In this case it is\nundisputed by both of the parties and by the Special\nMaster that the Glacier Bay Monument was not included\nwithin the main clause. The submerged lands, therefore,\ndid not --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, counsel, you --\napparently you agree that the U.S. retained title to the\nuplands in Glacier Bay National Monument under section\n5 --\nMR. FRANKLIN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- of the statehood act.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And why was Federal title to\nthe monument not sufficient to retain title to the\nsubmerged lands as well without reference to section 6(e)\nat all?\nMR. FRANKLIN: Because of section 6(m), Your\nHonor. Section 5 of the Alaska Statehood Act provides\nthat the Federal Government retained all of the property\nit previously possessed with one important exception,\nexcept as provided in section 6. Section 6 has two\nexceptions within it that are potentially relevant here.\nSection 6(m) incorporates the Submerged Lands Act and\nthereby provides that Alaska was to receive title to all\nthe submerged lands underlying its navigable waters, plus\nthose 3 miles seaward from the coastline, in order to put\nAlaska on the same equal footing with the rest of the\nStates.\nSection 6(e) dealt with an entirely different\nset of properties. What section 6(e) did was to transfer\nto the State a very specific and narrowly defined class of\nproperty, property that was used for the purposes or\nsolely -- for the sole purpose of -- of fish and wildlife\nconservation under three designated statutes. Those are\nthe State -- local-State fish and wildlife conservation\nstatutes.\nAgain, here it was -- it is undisputed that\nGlacier Bay is not included within the main clause.\nTherefore, the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- problem, as -- you just\nsaid that -- that the main clause is very, very narrow,\nand we're told by the Government that no wildlife\nreservation would come within that main clause, so that\nthere would be nothing to retain under the second clause.\nMR. FRANKLIN: The Government is incorrect, Your\nHonor. We have identified two wildlife refuges, the Kenai\nmoose range and the Kodiak bear refuge, that were\notherwise encompassed by the main clause but saved by the\nproviso.\nAnd here's why the United States is correct on\nthat. They argue in their brief that those properties\nwere not included in the main clause because they were\ncreated under the Alaska Game Law of 1925 rather than the\nAlaska Game Law of 1943. In fact, Your Honors, those are\nthe exact same statute. The '43 Alaska Game Law simply\nrestated the 1925 law with certain amendments. What that\nmeans is that at statehood the Kenai moose range and the\nKodiak bear refuge were, in fact, being used for the\npurposes under the Alaska Game Law of '43, which was the\nthen-existing version. These refuges were created in 1941\nprior to the restatement and amendment of the statute. So\nthose are two properties.\nAnd -- and actually the legislative history --\nwe don't think the Court needs to go to the legislative\nhistory because the statute is plain and also because\nthere's a clear statement rule. But the legislative\nhistory does indicate that Congress was specifically\nconcerned about those two very large refuges. The Kenai\nand the Kodiak together comprise an area that is\napproximately the same size as the State of Connecticut.\nAnd Congress' concern or, more specifically, the concern\nof the Fish and Wildlife Service was that Alaska might not\nbe able adequately to manage those properties. But there\nwas no such concern expressed with the monument that's at\nissue here because it was never going to be transferred to\nthe State under the main clause.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Why -- why shouldn't we look\nto the tests set out in the Idaho case here?\nMR. FRANKLIN: We are advocating the tests set\nout in the Idaho case, Your Honor. That test is a two-\npronged test.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Right.\nMR. FRANKLIN: First, you have to look and see\nif there is a --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Whether Congress has notice\nof the inclusion of the lands and a Federal reservation,\nwhich it certainly did for Glacier, did it not?\nMR. FRANKLIN: That's -- that's relevant to the\nfirst prong, Your Honor.\nThe second prong --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And second, whether the\ntransfer to the State would undermine the purpose of that\nreservation. Should we look to that?\nMR. FRANKLIN: If the Court were examining the\n-- the first prong, Your Honor, I think those factors\nmight be relevant. Here, though, the test is set out in\nnot only the Idaho case but also the Alaska case, and that\nis that there has to be an explicit action by Congress.\nAnd Idaho applies that. Idaho looked very carefully for\nsome action by Congress ratifying the reservation in that\ncase.\nHere, we need an action by Congress. The United\nStates has identified what they contend is the action of\nCongress, that is, the proviso to section 6(e) of the\nAlaska Statehood Act. That proviso, though, just does not\ncover these lands.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why do you say explicit? I --\nI thought it said you have to make it plain, which really\nmight matter.\nMR. FRANKLIN: In --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What it says -- the language I\nthink is -- or definitely declared or otherwise made very\nplain.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Yes. In the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that right? There's nothing\nthat says explicit. Right?\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well, Your Honor, in the Alaska\ncase -- and here I refer the Court to page 44 of the 1997\nAlaska case. There the Court said that Congress must,\nquote, explicitly recognize or that Congress had\nexplicitly recognized the resignation in that case. So\nthe -- the Court --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But doesn't that simply mean\nthat if it explicitly recognizes, it has made it plain.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it doesn't mean that it\nmust be explicit in every case. Isn't that correct?\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well, I -- I think explicit --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You don't have to be explicit\nto make it plain. It's a great way to do it, but that's\n-- it's not the only way.\nMR. FRANKLIN: It has to be definitely --\nJustice Breyer, you're correct. It has to be --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right.\nMR. FRANKLIN: -- definitely clear or otherwise\nmade plain. Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If I'm correct, then -- if I'm\ncorrect, then I guess the main argument I thought is here\nwe have a national park and we want to keep the national\nparks as the United States, which you'd expect. It's a\nnational park. And of course, they want to keep the whole\nthing. I mean, it's obvious. You don't have to write\neverything that's obvious. They no more want to give all\nthe water in the park to Alaska than they'd want to give\nthe gamekeeper's part to Alaska. A house, or maybe\nthere's a swimming pool somewhere they don't mention\neither, but it's just obvious that unless there's\nsomething very special about the water, that the water in\nthe park is part of the park.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well, there is something special\nabout the water, Your Honor, and that's what the Court has\nrecognized. The water is a State -- an essential\nattribute of State sovereignty, and just to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I understand that. But I mean,\nit's like saying we're keeping Yellowstone, but we're\ngiving you the geysers. I mean, that's water too. It's\neven underground water. But I mean, what the argument I\nthink is -- would be is this like that, and the argument\nthat it is like that is that, well, of course, you need\nthis water in order to study the glaciers because there\nare forests that go down to the edge, because the flora\nand fauna can't be protected without it. And so though it\nisn't as strong a case as the geysers in Yellowstone, it's\ngood enough. Now, what's your reply?\nMR. FRANKLIN: First of all, the geysers are not\nincluded because we're talking about navigable --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I understand that. I'm using a\nfunny example to --\nMR. FRANKLIN: Yes. Navigable waters.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FRANKLIN: But let me -- let me just assure\nthe Court. There is nothing at all unusual about State-\nowned submerged lands within national monuments. The\nreason is simple. The Antiquities Act, which allows the\nPresident to designate national monuments, was enacted in\n1906. At that time there were 45 States already in the\nUnion. Therefore, any national monument created in those\n45 States would necessarily have included State-owned\nsubmerged lands unless there had been some conveyance.\nAnd let -- let me give Your Honors a -- a\nconcrete example. In the 1978 California decision decided\nby this Court, the Court recognized that the Channel\nIslands National Monument, which is an offshore national\nmonument off the coast of California, included State-\nowned submerged lands because even though the reservation\norder was asserted to have included those lands, there was\nno congressional statement of an intent to defeat the\nState's title.\nAnother --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Like in Yellowstone. There is\na river I think. Who owns that?\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well, Yellowstone was created\nbefore the State of Wyoming and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. But I mean, does the State\nor the Feds own the -- the river that goes through it?\nMR. FRANKLIN: One would need to examine the\nparticular reservations and statutes there.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about in Yosemite? I\nthink there's a river down there too. Is the river in\nYosemite owned by California or by the -- the Feds?\nMR. FRANKLIN: I'm not familiar with that, but I\nwill give you an example that I am familiar with.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Before you do that, Mr.\nFranklin, is -- is the rule that -- that we're operating\nunder that Congress had to have made it clear --\nMR. FRANKLIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that it reserved, or is the\nrule that it is clear that Congress ought to have reserved\nit?\nMR. FRANKLIN: No. It's the former rule, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's the former.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So the mere fact that it\ndoesn't make any sense not to have reserved it does not\nmake it clear that Congress reserved it, does it?\nMR. FRANKLIN: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right, but normally you assume,\nI guess, that Congress does what is -- tries to avoid\nthings that are ridiculous. So if they say keep the park,\nI guess the question would be is that included. I mean --\nMR. FRANKLIN: It's not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- can you read it this way? I\n-- I think it would be relevant, wouldn't it?\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well, first of all, this is not\nthe ordinary -- in this case we presumed the -- the\nopposite. In fact, there's a strong presumption.\nBut let me give you the other example that I was\ngoing to refer to you.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. FRANKLIN: There's something called the\nCalifornia Coastal National Monument. That extends the\nentire length of California and goes out 12 miles to sea.\nIn that monument, the -- the lands, the submerged lands,\nare both State-owned and Federal-owned, and they are\nmanaged cooperatively.\nAnd that's what we are seeking to do here. And\nimportantly, the fact --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Franklin, are -- are these\nsubmerged lands covered by navigable waters?\nMR. FRANKLIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is it that the Government\ncould do, if they owned the submerged lands, by way of\nprotecting wildlife and doing all the good stuff they want\nto do, that they cannot do simply by -- by reason of -- of\nhaving jurisdiction over the navigable waters?\nMR. FRANKLIN: There are a few things,\npresumably very localized activities that the State would\nhave the exclusive authority in. Importantly though, the\nFederal Government, even though the State owns title here,\nwill retain all of its constitutional authority under the\nInterstate Commerce Clause to regulate activities that\naffect interstate commerce that --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, but just as a practical\nmatter, tell us what you're arguing about. What does\nAlaska think it can do if it prevails in the Glacier\nMonument area by virtue of prevailing, as a practical\nmatter?\nMR. FRANKLIN: As -- as a practical matter,\nthere are issues relating to local subsistence fishing\nthat are important to the State. There are issues\nrelating to local uses of the bay. But more\nimportantly --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, could -- could you be\nconcrete? I mean, there -- I don't know what you mean.\nWhat are the issues? Can you give me an explicit example?\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well, one explicit example is I\nthink the State would prefer to have more local\nsubsistence fishing in the bay. And the Court -- to -- to\nmove out a bit, the --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: So the State would permit\nmore fishing than the U.S. would allow --\nMR. FRANKLIN: I think --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- as a practical matter.\nMR. FRANKLIN: As a practical matter. And --\nand there -- there --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But couldn't Congress forbid\nthat under -- by reason of its control of the navigable\nwaters --\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well, if --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- if it really wanted to?\nMR. FRANKLIN: If Congress really wanted to,\nCongress could -- could affect activities relating to\ninterstate commerce.\nBut importantly, what Alaska seeks here really\nis a seat at the table. Right now Alaska has no say over\nanything that happens in its navigable waters which are\nits sovereign State lands. What it seeks really is to\nhave its views being considered.\nRight now -- and I'll give you a concrete\nexample that goes to the enclaves that are issue in the --\nin the next count that I'll discuss. For some time cruise\nships were going out into the middle of these enclaves and\ndumping their untreated sewage because that was outside --\nor asserted by the Government to be outside the scope of\nAlaska's pollution laws and not within the scope of\nFederal laws. That was fixed, but it took an act of\nCongress to do that. There had to be an act of Congress\nto prohibit those cruise ships from dumping their sludge\nout in these, what they used to call, donut holes. Alaska\nfinds it unacceptable to have to go petition Congress\nevery time something comes up on its navigable waters that\nit believes ought to be regulated or dealt with.\nNow, if Congress decides to preempt the State\nunder its interstate commerce power, it has the right to\ndo that.\nI think we also need to keep in mind what waters\nwe're talking about. This is southeast Alaska. The\nwaters of southeast Alaska quite literally define the\nregion. They are central to the economy, the history, the\nsociety, and the culture of all the Alaskans who live\nthere and who travel there.\nJust to take an example, there are still today\nvery few roads anywhere in southeast Alaska, and the --\nthe towns and the cities like the -- the State capital of\nJuneau historically were accessible only by the water.\nThis is an area -- the water in particular is an area that\nis of great importance to Alaska. And they are seeking to\nconfirm that that area does belong to Alaska. And I think\nwe have set forth in quite detail why --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, there -- there are big\ndifferences between the -- the analysis concerning the\nbays that you assert and Glacier Monument. I think\nthey're quite different.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well, the -- the tests are\ndifferent. The Glacier Bay test involves -- needs to have\nan explicit reservation -- explicit ratification by\nCongress of a reservation and --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: You're lumping them all\ntogether, but I think the tests are quite different.\nMR. FRANKLIN: The tests are different.\nWhat I was trying to explain is, in answer to\nYour Honor's question, why this matters to Alaska. It\nmatters quite a deal.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But in -- in respect to Glacier\nBay --\nMR. FRANKLIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- I -- I mean, is the only --\nyou said, for example -- is the only dispute about the use\nof the water that's in the middle of the Glacier Bay park\nwhether there should be more or less fishing, or are there\nother things that Alaska wants to do with that water in\nthe park that they can't do if the United States owns it?\nMR. FRANKLIN: There are two issues. I think\nit's fishing and also to allow more local people to visit\nthe area that would otherwise be prohibited by the Park\nService. There was -- but just to assure Your Honors --\nJUSTICE BREYER: How could they do that? You\nmean they would go into a boat in the middle of the water\nthere, but they couldn't get off the boat?\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well, that's normally what --\nwhat people do is they just visit the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I see.\nMR. FRANKLIN: -- by boats.\nBut to assure Your Honor, there -- for example,\nthere are no mineral interests here anywhere in the\npicture.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So if -- if\nthe normal way of visiting the park is to go into a boat\nand to go up along the waterway and to look at the\nglaciers on the shore, then it surely is odd that the\nUnited States intended to give that waterway to Alaska,\nfor under those circumstances, there would be nothing left\nof the park. I mean, it would be like -- you see, if it's\nessential to it.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well, that's not true, Your\nHonor. 80 percent of the park, even if one assumes it\nincluded the submerged lands, is uplands. But it's no\nmore unusual --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. I understand that, but I\nmean, it's the way of visiting the park.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Yes, but I just mentioned, for\nexample, the two monuments in California. The Channel\nIslands National Monument this Court held included the --\nthe submerged lands were State-owned. There's no other\nway to get to the Channel Islands Monument but to traverse\nState-owned submerged lands. In fact, I think there are\nfew national parks in this country you can't get to\nwithout going across State lands.\nI think there's another important point here and\nthat is the Property Clause of the Constitution would also\nallow the Federal Government to regulate activities on\nlands that abut national parks to the extent that they\nmight affect park activities.\nBut here what we need is an expressed statement\nby Congress ratifying the purported reservation of the bay.\nWithout that, Your Honors -- and the -- the precedents are\nclear. Without that, the presumption is -- in fact, the\nstrong presumption is -- that these are State-owned lands.\nAnd again, there is absolutely nothing unusual. That is\npart of our Federal system. It's the way that these\nmonument properties have been managed since 1906 when the\nPresident first got the authority. It's the way that\nGlacier Bay will continue to be managed. We expect, we\nintend to work cooperatively with the Federal Government\nto resolve any issues that might remain.\nWhat we're seeking here, again, is a seat at the\ntable. We just are seeking to have Alaska's views dealt\nwith because they are the owner.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In the -- in the '97 case,\nwas the area at issue within the first part of 6(e)?\nBecause this --\nMR. FRANKLIN: Yes. The -- the Court expressly\nstated that it was at pages 60 to 61, and that was in the\nabsence of any contrary argument.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It -- it made an assumption.\nMR. FRANKLIN: The Court made an assumption, but\nin fact --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But was it in fact?\nMR. FRANKLIN: I think there would have been a\nsubstantial -- had that -- had that issue been litigated,\nthere would have been a substantial argument that it was\nnot within the main clause. But again, there was no\nargument on that point before the Court. The Court at\npages 60 to 61 expressly stated -- again, it was an\nassumption, but the Court expressly stated that the lands\nwere within the main clause. Apparently the Court was\nconsidering the fact that the application for ANWR did, in\nfact, reference the purposes that were set forth in the\nmain clause, the Alaska Game Law.\nThe important point of that case for this case,\nthough, Your Honors, is that the Court embraced the\nconstruction of section 6(e) that we are advocating here,\nnamely that the proviso exempts and saves for the Federal\nGovernment a subset of the properties that would otherwise\nhave been transferred to the State under the main clause.\nThere simply was no need for Congress to have expressed an\nintent --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought we had left that\nopen. I thought we --\nMR. FRANKLIN: I think what I said is that the\nCourt embraced that position, and it was actually an\nessential attribute of the -- essential premise for the\nCourt's holding. At 60 to 61 and again at page 48 of the\n-- the decision, what the Court made clear is it was\nconcerned that unless the lands were saved by the proviso,\nall of them, the submerged lands and the uplands, would\nhave passed to Alaska under the main clause, and that was\none of the reasons the Court, I think, held that it was\ncovered by the proviso. No such concern is present here.\nI'd like at this point briefly to turn, if I\nmight, to the count I, which is the historic waters count.\nThere the United States asserts that at statehood the\nwaters of southeast Alaska were riddled with isolated\nenclaves of international high seas that were wholly\nsurrounded by U.S. territorial waters. The historical\nrecord, though, belies that contention.\nAt least from 1903 until 1971, the United States\ntook what this Court has described in the Mississippi\nSound case, the Alabama and Mississippi Boundary Case, as\nthe publicly stated policy that the waters of the\narchipelago were inland and that the political boundary\nran along the outside edge. Thereafter, the United States\ntook -- consistently based a discriminatory enforcement\nregime, fisheries enforcement, on that position. What I\nmean by discriminatory is that the United States allowed\nU.S. fishing but prohibited foreign fishing in that area.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the argument on the other\nside, as I understand it, is that the -- the assertion of\nauthority to regulate fishing really is -- is relevant.\nIt has no necessary implication for the historic waters\ndoctrine. What -- what is your answer to that?\nMR. FRANKLIN: That's the assertion. My answer\nis that the Court announced to the contrary in the 1975\ndecision, the Cook Inlet case, there at page 201 and 202,\nand this is quoted at page 28 of the blue brief. What the\nCourt said there is it examined an incident in which a\nJapanese fishing vessel had been caught in the general\narea, and the Court said -- and I quote -- that incident\ndeserves scrutiny because the seizure of a foreign vessel\nmore than 3 miles from shore manifests an assertion of\nsovereignty to exclude foreign vessels altogether and,\nquote, must be viewed as an exercise of authority over the\nwaters in question.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what page was that?\nMR. FRANKLIN: I'm sorry. That's 201 to 202 --\n201 and 202 of the Cook Inlet case, and that's at 28 of\nthe blue brief.\nWhat the law was at statehood is that the United\nStates had no authority, after 3 miles out, to enforce\ndiscriminatory fishing regulations against foreign\nvessels.\nNow, importantly there's a caveat here, and that\nis that the law has changed. The law has changed since\n1971. Beginning in 1976, the United States asserted a\n200-mile -- what's known as an exclusive economic zone\nthat allows the United States to enforce discriminatory\nfishing, and in 1982 international law embraced that.\nBut -- and we have quoted a UN study. In fact,\nthe UN study that we have quoted -- and that is noted at\npage 29 of the blue brief. That is the study that's\ncalled the Juridical Regime Study. It's the study that\nthis Court itself, in all of its historic waters cases,\nhas used as the authoritative statement of the law. That\nstudy quite clearly states that if a -- if a country\nenforced discriminatory fishing rules against foreign\nvessels outside -- that that manifests an assertion of an\nhistoric inland waters claim. And what we have here --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: On -- on this point, it seems\nto me there -- unlike the first point you were discussing\nwhere I think the Federal Government can work its will\nanyway, on this point there is really a significant\nFederal interest involved. That is to say, if the United\nStates takes the position that these are, indeed, inland\nwaters, it's going to have to acknowledge similar rights\nin foreign countries with similar archipelagos.\nMR. FRANKLIN: No. Your Honor, they assert\nthat, but they don't provide any specific examples. And\nthe reason they can't provide a specific example of any\ninstance abroad where it would affect their position is\nthat each historic waters inquiry is decided on its own\nfacts. The fact that something is an archipelago does not\nrender it historic waters.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but you say a\ndeterminative fact, a conclusive fact is simply -- is\nsimply enforcing discriminatory fishing regulations.\nMR. FRANKLIN: It is a claim to the -- to the\nwaters, which was made in 1903, accompanied with\ndiscriminatory fishing enforcement, accompanied with other\nstatements in this case, including the California brief to\nthis Court. There has to be an -- excuse me --\nan examination of all of the facts and circumstances before\none can conclude that waters are historic waters. These\nones are. Other waters would not be. The United States\nhas not identified any waters abroad that have precisely\nthese constellation of facts. So its -- its position is\nbasically: we say it, therefore it must be so. I --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's not the United\nStates that will be making the judgment about what areas\nare controlled. It would be the country abroad. And I --\nI think the argument was, what the United States does\nother nations will copy.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And they will decide what\nlooks like the Alaska --\nMR. FRANKLIN: Right.\nWhat the United States does, Your Honor, is\nfollow the well-settled international law on historic bays\n-- historic waters. Those are set forth in the\nconvention. Each state will have the same authority where\nits facts and circumstances dictate it. If there has been\na continuous claim asserted by a nation with the\nacquiescence of foreign nations, then it will qualify as\nhistoric waters. But it has to be done based on a -- an\nexamination of the particular facts of the case.\nAnd one thing else -- one thing other that is\nworth noting, if you have an archipelago like this, a\nnation can always close it off using article 4 straight\nbaselines. That is permitted under the convention. The\nU.S. has decided not to do that, but other states are\nfully able to do that.\nI think that if the United States is going to be\narguing that there is some international precedent here\nthat's going to hurt it adversely, it needs to identify a\nparticular body water abroad that it believes this case is\ngoing to affect.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why should it make that\nsuggestion? It would certainly not be in the interest of\nthe United States.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well, it -- it needs to explain\nmore specifically then, other than just stating we think\nit might affect our position. The -- the facts and\ncircumstances -- the Court, for example, applied the\nhistoric bay question in Mississippi Sound, in the\nMississippi Sound case. I am aware of no instance in\nwhich that precedent was ever used adversely and the\nUnited States has not identified any -- any instance.\nBut more importantly, what this Court did in the\nMississippi Sound case is it looked at the evidence and it\nsaid is this a historic bay or is it not. The Court\nconcluded that it was and that was the inquiry that the\nCourt follows.\nAt this point, I'd like to reserve the remaining\ntime for rebuttal.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, Mr. Franklin.\nMr. Minear.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR\nON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT\nMR. MINEAR: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may\nit please the Court:\nI would like to begin with the focal point of\nAlaska's argument, namely Glacier Bay National Park.\nAlaska's core contention is that section 6(e) of the\nstatehood act does not provide an adequate showing that\nthe United States intended to retain the submerged lands\nin Glacier Bay. For this --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could -- before you go into\nthat, could you tell me how 6(e) begins?\nMR. MINEAR: Yes. In fact, I think it's very\nhelpful. It's listed at page 7a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, (e) --\nMR. MINEAR: -- of our -- of the gray brief.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but the -- well -- well,\nthe -- the introduction to it is -- is not listed, is it?\nI mean --\nMR. MINEAR: That may -- that may be so.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it's incomplete. It --\nit just says all real and -- what about all real and\npersonal property? Is there an intro that says there is\nhereby -- there is hereby granted to the United -- to\nAlaska?\nMR. MINEAR: Well, 6(e) I think begins stating\nthat this -- these are exceptions to section 5 which is\nthe retention -- the general retention provision of the\nUnited -- for United States lands.\nBut if we look at 6(e) itself, it's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you say they're\nexceptions. How -- how are the exceptions introduced? I\nmean, it's incomplete to just read (e) that says all --\nwhat about all real and personal property of the United\nStates? There has to be some introductory language. What\nis it?\nMR. MINEAR: No. Actually there doesn't, Your\nHonor, because if you go on, it says all real and personal\nproperty -- then you skip down, about halfway down --\nshall be transferred and conveyed to the State of Alaska\nby the appropriate Federal agency. So it is -- so this is\ncomplete in terms of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. Okay. You're right.\nMR. MINEAR: But if I could walk you through\nthose provisions because I think they're quite important.\nThe first provision says, as you say, all real and\npersonal property which is specifically used for the sole\npurpose of conservation and protection of wildlife shall\nbe transferred to the United States.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. MINEAR: It's followed by another provision\nhere.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: To -- to Alaska.\nMR. MINEAR: To -- to Alaska. Excuse me.\nAnd it's followed by another proviso which says\nthat the United States will continue to control fish and\ngame matters in Alaska until the Secretary of Interior has\ncertified that Alaska is ready to do so. Clearly that\nproviso is not a subset --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Minear, before you get too\nfar, I also would like to ask a preliminary question that\nwas raised by Justice O'Connor before. Do you agree that\nsection 5 itself, the second part of it that says the\nUnited States retains title to its own property, that the\nresponse to that is adequately provided in the Submerged\nLands Act referred to in subparagraph (m)?\nMR. MINEAR: No, I don't. I don't believe --\nlet me frame the -- your -- your question, if I may, for\nyou. Section 5 indicates the United States would retain\nall of the lands that it presently holds. Section 6(m)\nthen makes the Submerged Lands Act applicable to the -- to\nthe -- to Alaska. In doing so, it recognizes that there\nare some lands the United States would continue to retain,\nprovided it meets the requirements of the Submerged Lands\nAct.\nThe particular exception we're concerned about\nhere is the expressly retained exception, in other words,\nif lands are retained by the United States. This Court\nsaid in the Arctic Coast case that that provision adopts\nthe general law that applied before the Submerged Lands\nAct, that it had to be made plain that the United States\nwould be holding onto these lands. It doesn't require an\nexpress statement. It simply requires that it be made\nplain.\nNow, our view is that these lands would be\nretained by the United States, quite apart from 6 -- the\n6(e) exception we're arguing about here on summary\njudgment. And if you denied our motion for summary\njudgment, we'd go back and talk about the other exceptions\nthat are applicable.\nBut in this case we're simply focusing on 6(e)\nand we're focusing on that because the Court's Arctic\nCoast decision made clear that 6(e) -- and I quote --\nreflects the very clear intent to retain title, unquote,\nto submerged lands, quote, so long as those submerged\nlands were among those set apart as refuges or wildlife --\nor reservations for the protection of wildlife.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we didn't have this issue\nbefore us. Let -- let me --\nMR. MINEAR: Yes, we did.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- let me -- why don't you go\nback to your argument? You said that the first proviso on\nits face is simply not a subset of the first part of (e).\nMR. MINEAR: Yes. It's an example how provisos\ndo not need to be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that's not the proviso at\nissue here.\nMR. MINEAR: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The proviso at issue here is\nthe second proviso which begins provided that such\ntransfer shall not include lands. Such transfer. Now,\nthis is -- the word such refers you back to something.\nWhat -- what possible transfer could it mean except the\nend of the introduction, which says shall be transferred\nand conveyed to the State of Alaska?\nMR. MINEAR: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, anybody reading that\nwould -- would think that proviso refers to that transfer\nor at least it is not clear that it provides to -- that it\napplies to every transfer in -- in the whole act.\nMR. MINEAR: I disagree with you, Justice\nScalia, for these reasons.\nFirst of all, the such transfer simply tells you\nwhat's not included. That language tells you -- this is\noutside. It doesn't mean that whatever follows\nnecessarily was within the main clause. What Congress was\ndoing here, by making clear that these lands were not\ntransferred --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What does the such refer to?\nMR. MINEAR: It does refer to the transfer\nbefore. But what follows here, refuges and reservations\nfor the protection of wildlife, they do not fit within\nthat -- that main clause. It's obvious they don't because\nthe only things that fit within the main clause are those\nlands and real property specifically used for the sole\npurpose of conservation and protection of wildlife.\nWhat we're talking about here -- wildlife\nreservations are multiple purpose lands. They're not used\nsolely for -- for the purpose of conservation. The\npurpose of the first provision here was to transfer\nvehicles, fish hatcheries, other equipment that the State\nwould need to enforce Alaska game laws. That was the\npoint of -- of that first provision. But Secretary\nChapman who drafted this made clear in the legislative\nhistory that what he was doing was drawing a line between\nthose -- those facilities and equipment that are used by a\nState in its traditional game management and drawing a\ncontrast with the matters that would be retained by the\nUnited States.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Where is the language that says\nthat the submerged land that fits the proviso is retained\nby the United States?\nMR. MINEAR: We do not need --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What the proviso says is just\nwhat Justice Scalia said.\nMR. MINEAR: We do not need express language\nthat expresses --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, but where is the\nimplication in that?\nMR. MINEAR: The implication is that we are\nretaining all of the reservation. And this is what the\nCourt said in the Arctic Coast decision. It saw that this\nwas --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's -- that's -- it -- I\nmean, in -- in -- I take it in the Alaska case we were\nconsidering a transfer that did fall within the main\nsentence of (e).\nMR. MINEAR: Justice Breyer, neither party made\nthat argument. This issue came up in a letter that was\nwritten after. The -- the language --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Were we or weren't we?\nMR. MINEAR: You were not considering that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: We weren't.\nMR. MINEAR: That -- that was -- simply neither\nparty suggested that ANWR fell within the first provision.\nAnd it doesn't. It's clear that it doesn't. It was not\nland that was specifically used solely for conservation of\nwildlife under these three listed statutes. The ANWR\nreservation at that time was set apart. It was BLM land.\nIt was also used for mining and other activities.\nLikewise, the other matters --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the Court did assume --\nthe Court did assume that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. MINEAR: It made that assumption with no\nbriefing, but it did that with regard to the second issue\nthat was presented there. The issue that people were\nfighting about in the Arctic Coast decision was was this\nland properly set apart or not for purposes of the\nproviso. And that's where this discussion takes place.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then --\nMR. MINEAR: It's an afterthought that simply\nreinforces.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then at best Alaska\nis a neutral. Because we didn't think it, we're operating\nas a mistake. It's a neutral. Okay.\nNow, what's bothering me about the case is just\nwhat Justice Scalia said, that -- that why I -- if I sell\nyou all my clothing and then I put, but not my camping\ngear, I mean, I can absolutely see you don't get my\ncamping clothing, but you want to say that's a reservation\nof mess kits from some other transfer? I mean, it has\nnothing to do with mess kits.\nMR. MINEAR: Your Honor, but that's -- it's\nclear that what this is -- this is more along the lines if\nsomeone said that I will sell you my house, provided that\ntransfer shall not include the detached garage.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fine, and then it doesn't go in\nthat.\nMR. MINEAR: In that case --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But it doesn't mean that the\nnext --\nMR. MINEAR: Yes, but it was not a part of the\nhouse.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. MINEAR: You know, that's -- it's just\nproviding clarification, just that one of the purposes of\nthe proviso is to provide clarification.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: This is an abundance of\ncaution?\nMR. MINEAR: In other -- that is exactly right.\nAnd we can tell that from --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. If it's an\nabundance of caution, where's the other language that\nalmost reserves it so we need the caution?\nMR. MINEAR: That would be section 5. It\nindicates the general retention for lands of this sort.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But 5 is subject to the\nSubmerged Lands Act and the Submerged Lands Act brings you\nback to the reservation has to be explicit. And then --\nsee, that's --\nMR. MINEAR: Well, Justice Breyer, again, if I\ncan just complete the point --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's why I was talking about\nYellowstone.\nMR. MINEAR: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I was looking for something\nthat would be obvious that they wouldn't have meant to\ntransfer. He comes back and says, well, very often States\ndo control the water.\nMR. MINEAR: Your Honor, I just need to make a\npoint. I think it's very important for you to understand\nthis point. First of all, that at page 57 of the Arctic\nCoast decision, this Court was clearly reading this\nlanguage, the 6(e) proviso, as sufficient to provide a\nclear indication of transfer of title, and in doing so, it\nwas recognizing what is clear in the proviso itself, that\nthese particular items that are discussed there are not a\npart of the main clause and cannot be. And a good example\nof that is the third thing that's being transferred,\nfacilities that are utilized in connection with general\nresearch activities related to fisheries and wildlife.\nNow, that is not going to be something that's\nspecifically used for the sole purpose of conservation and\nprotection of wildlife. It's the antithesis of that. It\nmakes quite clear that our construction is correct. The\nsubset theory just doesn't work because the items that are\nhere are not things that fit within the main clause. What\nCongress was doing here was drawing a very clear line --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But why -- why doesn't (m)\nsupersede that argument anyway? Let's -- can't we say\nthat, well, you may be right so far as the second clause\nof (e) is concerned, but you still have to deal with (m)?\nMR. MINEAR: Then you have to explain what\nhappened in the Arctic Coast case, why we were able to\nretain the ANWR lands which did not fall within the main\nprovision. And that is because Congress was making --\nbecause this Court concluded that Congress was making\nclear that wildlife lands are very important and they\nwanted to make absolutely clear that those lands would not\nbe transferred. And even a provision that could be\nmisconstrued, as I'm afraid this Court did in -- in Arctic\nCoast -- could be misconstrued to contain some of these\nlands, we need to make adequate assurance that -- that the\ncourts that read this realize a clear division is being\nmade. We are retaining these wildlife lands. That's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Minear, I'm -- I'm not sure\nI agree with you that -- that that language, facilities\nused in connection with general research activities\nrelating to fisheries or wildlife, is not a subpart of the\nearlier -- of the earlier grant, namely property used for\nthe sole purpose of conservation and protection of\nfisheries and wildlife. Surely one -- one can readily\nregard general research activities relating to fisheries\nor wildlife to be part of the activity of conserving and\nprotecting fisheries and wildlife.\nMR. MINEAR: But we're talking about a facility\nhere. So a facility that might conduct some -- some\nresearch tangentially related to wildlife is not a\nfacility that's used for the sole -- specifically used for\nthe sole purpose of conservation and wildlife. There's a\nclear difference here. These two -- these two sets do not\noverlap, and it's even more so with regard to wildlife\nrefuges. Wildlife refuges and wildlife reservations are\nused for multiple purposes.\nAt the time of statehood, the -- the regulations\nin place, the fisheries regulations and wildlife\nregulations, made clear that permits could be issued for\npurposes apart from wildlife conservation. And this\nCourt's own decision in Udall v. Tallman recognized that\none of the -- the refuges that Alaska cites as being\nincluded in the main clause was being used for oil and gas\npurposes. It was not being used solely for the purposes\n-- specifically used solely for the purposes of\nconservation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Minear, you know, I -- I am\njust overwhelmed by the reality that this is a terrible\nmess of a statute. I can't figure out what it means.\nMR. MINEAR: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and it seems to me\nthat's exactly why we have a clear statement rule.\nMR. MINEAR: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There are arguments here, there\nare arguments there, but it -- it does not dawn upon me\nthat -- that anything is clear about this at all.\nMR. MINEAR: Well, this -- we believe the\nstatute has been clear for 50 years. That's why these\nissues have only arisen recently with regard to Glacier\nBay National Park.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Minear, what do you say\nare the practical consequences from the Federal\nGovernment's perspective of going -- of disagreeing with\nthe U.S. position? What harm is done? Can the U.S.\nprotect itself in any event under other clauses?\nMR. MINEAR: We agree that the United States has\nthe regulatory authority to protect -- to limit vessel\nentries and protect commercial fishing, but that's not\nwhat our concern is.\nOur concern is with the actual use of the\nsubmerged lands. This is a laboratory. This is a\nlaboratory for scientific research, and we occupy and use\nthe submerged lands for that purpose. That includes such\nthings as withdrawing cores of materials so we can analyze\nits historic features. We've installed a 5-mile cable\nwith a hydrophone on the -- on the submerged lands so we\ncan listen to vehicle traffic and determine if the -- the\nvolume is sufficient to interfere with the whales that\nmigrate through there.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Don't you do that on -- on dry\nland in some States?\nMR. MINEAR: Your Honor, in order to hear\nvehicle traffic --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't your authority under\nthe Commerce Clause or under -- under -- over navigable\nwaters allow you to do that kind of stuff?\nMR. MINEAR: Your Honor, we think that -- that\nAlaska would have a realistic argument that we cannot\nwithdraw materials from the submerged land which we use\nand study. And in fact, I would point out that the park\nsuperintendent's affidavit --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are they likely to do that?\nMR. MINEAR: What?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are they likely to do that? Is\nthis a real problem?\nMR. MINEAR: There are 900 papers, scientific\npapers, that are cited in the affidavit of the park\nsuperintendent. This is exhibit number 8 on count IV.\nAnd of those describing the type of research we do in\nGlacier Bay National Park --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I thought --\nMR. MINEAR: -- scores and perhaps hundreds of\nthose involve submerged lands.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Given what you're\nsaying -- and I -- you're not accepting this I think, and\nI -- well, there is language in this act which maintains\nin the United States title to the park.\nMR. MINEAR: That is correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, I would have\nthought when you get title to the park, you mean the park,\nand by the park, you mean those essential parts of the\npark.\nMR. MINEAR: We --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And therefore, if you have a\npart of the park which is the only part of the park where\npeople look at the park, and it's the only part of the\npark that brings them into the park, and it's the only\npart of the park where you do the research, et cetera,\nthat's the park. Just as if I were to sell my house and I\nlist the rooms and forget the kitchen, well, the kitchen\nis an essential part of the house.\nMR. MINEAR: That's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now -- now, once I made that\nargument, he said that's a very clever argument, but\nreally, there are all kinds of instances where States have\nreserved submerged land inside national parks and it's\nworked fine.\nMR. MINEAR: But those are instances --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's your response to all\nthis?\nMR. MINEAR: The instances -- the examples\nthey're giving are cases in which we've created those\nnational monuments or parks after statehood. And in those\ncases, we cannot acquire those lands because they have\nalready been transferred to the State at statehood.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It hasn't resulted in a -- in a\ndisaster. That's the point that Justice Breyer is making.\nMR. MINEAR: But in this case --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It has not resulted in a\ndisaster.\nMR. MINEAR: But in this case, it is going to\nimpede the -- the activities we have there.\nAnd a good example of this is in the amicus\nbrief at page 25 where Alaska does not even assent to our\nauthority to control fish and wildlife. The Alaska\nlegislature has passed a statute in which it refuses to\nassent to our authority to control fish and wildlife\nwithin the park. This gives you some sense of the type of\ndifficulties that we're going to encounter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. --\nMR. MINEAR: And our chief concern --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Minear, may I ask you? At\nthe time the statute was passed, was the national\nGovernment conducting these activities?\nMR. MINEAR: Yes, it was. It was created as a\nnational monument. Now, in terms of what degree of\nactivities, the record is not clear, but we're --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe you were monitoring\npassages through to see whether the whales were going to\nbe interfered with and doing that sort of thing. Were you\ntaking core samples?\nMR. MINEAR: We were definitely studying the bed\nof the lake, and our -- our briefs below explain. We have\nan affidavit from our glaciologist which describes the\ntype of research that was being done.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So in -- in other words, you --\nyou're saying it is fair to say that at the time of the\npassage, this would have been on the congressional mind,\ngoing back to Justice Breyer's --\nMR. MINEAR: It -- it definitely would have.\nAnd also I want to point out that when we\ncreated the national monument, we also preserved such\nthings as the interglacial forests. These are forests\nthat are left behind as the glaciers retreat and go\nforward over these submerged lands. The glacial forests\nare in the submerged lands, and so they become a part of\nit. As these glaciers continue to retreat, it's likely\nthat other glacial forests will be revealed, and those\nshould remain a part of the park. That was part of the\npurpose, was to study those --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Should. Now, you're not -- how\nfar are you prepared to go? You can't go more than your\nbrief and your facts justify. Are you prepared to say\nthat this water is an essential part of the park?\nMR. MINEAR: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes?\nMR. MINEAR: Yes. Certainly --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Have you said that before this\nminute?\nMR. MINEAR: Not only have we said it, but the\nPark Service at statehood said that this is a water park\nwhen they were describing these lands and saying why they\nshould be retained. They told Congress -- the -- the park\nsuperintendent or the -- the director of the Park Service\nsaid this is a water park that's mostly -- this is, after\nall, Glacier Bay National Park.\nAnd in that -- with that respect, I'd like to\npoint out this --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why did they keep the other 80\npercent then?\nMR. MINEAR: Excuse me, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why did they keep the other 80\npercent?\nMR. MINEAR: Well, the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I gather only 20 percent of it\nis water.\nMR. MINEAR: It's slightly more than 20 --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They should have given away the\nrest.\nMR. MINEAR: We haven't given away. We have all\nof these lands. The -- the uplands here are the glaciers\nand the mountains that are inaccessible except by the\nwater. You cannot reach these areas. There are no roads\nin this park except for the park visitors center, and\nbeyond that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Then make it a water park. I\nmean, you want to say it's a -- it's a water-accessible\npark, fine.\nMR. MINEAR: Yes. But, Your Honor, the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: 20 percent of the park is under\nwater. Right?\nMR. MINEAR: More than 20 percent. Roughly 25.\nI'd say close to 25 percent of the park is -- within the\npark boundaries is submerged lands.\nBut there's another point I'd like to make with\nregard to the establishment of the park. This park was\ncreated under the Antiquities Act, and under the\nAntiquities Act, the President is given authority to\ncreate national monuments, but they cannot be\ndisestablished except by act of Congress. Now, Congress\ncould have disestablished this monument if it had meant to\ngive up the land. It could have disestablished some part\nof it, and it chose not to do so. And yet, that's another\nindication that Congress was intending to retain these\nlands.\nNow, I would like to move on to the other two\ncounts we have here, unless we have further questions\nabout -- about Glacier Bay. But I -- I think one thing\nthat I do -- one thought I want you -- to leave you with\nwith regard to Glacier Bay is that these lands are\nessential to the park. They are understood to be\nessential at the time that the park was created. And the\n-- the line we're suggesting here is a very reasonable one\nwith regard to this park. Those lands are -- continue to\nbe used -- the submerged lands for scientific research\nthat is vitally important.\nNow, I'd like to point out that the master also\ncorrectly rejected the claim that the archipelago straits\nare historic inland waters, and on that basis, Alaska\nfailed to satisfy any part of the Court's three-part test.\nThis Court specifically failed to show a continuous\nassertion of -- of sovereignty to exclude vessels that\nhave -- that are visiting the park or passing through in\ninnocent passage or to indicate any acquiescence of\nforeign nations.\nDuring the past 150-year period, neither Alaska\nnor the United States ever attempted to exclude a vessel\nbased on -- merely on innocent passage. Rather, Alaska --\nAlaska cannot point to a single incident in which we\nunambiguously did so. The only --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Alaska is arguing, as I\nunderstand it now, that the -- the exclusion for purposes\nof fisheries regulation has the same implication as a\nmatter of international law, which is a point that you\ndisagree on. What -- what is your response to their\nresponse to --\nMR. MINEAR: The answer is in order to establish\na historic inland water claim, you have to exclude a\nvessel based on this passing through in innocent passage.\nFisheries is not -- engaging in fishing activity under the\nconvention is not innocent passage. And so, therefore, an\nexclusion based on fisheries can never -- can never give\nrise to a claim of --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And what's -- what's your best\nauthority for that?\nMR. MINEAR: Well, our best authority is the\nconvention itself. The convention makes clear under\narticle 14 that fisheries is -- that fisheries activities\nare not innocent passage. Rather, innocent passage is\nmerely transit through from one point to another.\nMoreover, the Marguerite incident that they\ndescribe involves a single incident; that is, it does not\nsatisfy the continuity requirement that the inland -- the\nhistoric inland waters test requires.\nAnd finally, it also didn't satisfy the\nacquiescence test since the British Government protested\nthe seizure of the ship.\nAnd finally on top of that, this vessel -- we\ndon't know exactly where this vessel was at the time that\nit was seized. There continues to be a dispute and the\nmaster was unable to determine whether that -- the ship\nwas in -- inside or outside the 3-mile limit.\nNow, I'd also like to speak briefly to the\njuridical -- juridical bay claim as well. This is a\nmatter that Alaska did not touch upon, but I imagine it\nwould address on rebuttal.\nThe master correctly rejected Alaska's\nextraordinary claim that the Alexander Archipelago can be\nturned into two large -- large juridical bays. And\nbasically it attempted to do so by establishing a headland\non an island. Now, that does not suffice the purpose of\nthe convention. The only way that it can establish a bay\nheadland or -- or closing point is by showing that it's on\nthe mainland. In order to establish that this is on the\nmainland, Alaska has to ignore four intervening bodies of\nwater. And as the master recognized, these bodies of\nwater are simply too substantial to ignore. In the case\nof these bodies of water, Keku Strait is 41 miles long, on\naverage 4 and a half miles wide. It's -- simply those\nintervening waters cannot be ignored in order to establish\nthat this is -- is part of the mainland.\nIt's also separated by Wrangell Narrows, which\nis a 12-mile-long strait that is an important passage for\ninternational navigation. That too precludes it from\nbeing ignored and treated as dry land.\nThe failure of those two assimilations by itself\nis sufficient to establish that -- that these -- that\nthese juridical bays do not exist.\nAnd even if that were not enough, the master\nwent on to say that this would not be a well-marked\nindentation, that even if you were willing to assimilate\nthese lands, it's still the case that the bay itself would\nnot be -- the supposed, imaginary bays that Alaska has\ncreated here would not be recognizable to a mariner who is\npassing by.\nFor all those reasons, the juridical bays here\nare -- are simply not well founded, and the master was\ncorrect in rejecting them.\nSo what we see --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Minear, could I go back\nto Glacier --\nMR. MINEAR: Certainly, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- Park again for a moment\nand ask why the Government decided to base its claim to\nthe lands in Glacier Bay exclusively on that murky\nprovision of 6(e) rather than to talk about the standards\nset out in the Idaho case?\nMR. MINEAR: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do you -- do you not rely on\nthat standard --\nMR. MINEAR: Quite --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- of analysis?\nMR. MINEAR: Quite honestly we thought that\nunder the Arctic Coast decision, the Court is required to\ncreate absolutely new -- no new law. It had already\ninterpreted 6(e) and it was clear that section 6(e)\napplied to this case.\nWe think the Idaho provisions provide another\nopportunity for us to establish it. It's quite clear that\nthe purposes of the -- the lands here, the submerged\nlands, are so essential to the park that it's simply\ninconceivable that Congress would have intended for those\nlands to pass out of ownership.\nHowever, we relied on --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you -- would you tell us\nagain why, if you do not prevail on this argument, you\nstill go back before the -- the Special Master to show\ncertain facts?\nMR. MINEAR: Well, first of all, Alaska has not\nmoved for summary judgment. We moved for summary judgment\non some of our theories. Other theories would require\nsome factual development. One of the theories that we\nwould -- we would go forward with is that these lands are\noccupied under a claim of right, and that's another\nexception under the Submerged Lands Act.\nIn addition, we would renew the argument with\nregard to Antiquities Act, that once Congress takes an\narea and authorizes the President to set it aside under\nthe Antiquities Act and provides that it cannot be\ndisestablished except by act of Congress, we think that's\na very clear indication of Congress' intent to retain\nthose lands.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, given the absence of a\nsummary judgment, we wouldn't have to address that.\nMR. MINEAR: No. You would not have -- we -- we\nbelieve the master adverted to this claim, but we do not\nthink that he foreclosed it.\nBut rather, I'd like to discuss briefly the\nrelationship of Idaho and Alaska because I think it's\nimportant and worthwhile. We think that this case falls\nsquarely within the Alaska Arctic Coast case, and in\nparticular we relied on it primarily because it provides\nan actual textual basis for showing that the -- the United\nStates retain those lands. We do not need to go further\nand show purpose, although we certainly can. We relied on\nthe Alaska case because we think it provides a very clear\nexample of why retention is -- is required in this case.\nThe master agreed with us. He analyzed the\nArctic Coast decision and he concluded that the -- the\nproviso here necessarily must be considered an independent\nretention clause. There's no other way to understand the\nArctic Coast decision except on that basis.\nAnd we think that's the right interpretation,\nand we think if we -- if you focus on what the Court said\non pages 56 to 57, it becomes quite clear. The statement\nthat Alaska relies on to create its so-called subset test\nis an afterthought at the end of the opinion. It's a\nstatement that's made in the Court's words to reinforce\nthe conclusion it's already reached. It doesn't provide a\nbasis for -- for departing from that. And in fact, as I\nhope I have showed to the Court, the subset test doesn't\nmake any sense, that they're simply -- all of those lands\nthat fall within the proviso are lands that would not fall\nwithin the main clause.\nThe wildlife refuge is occupied for multiple\npurposes. It's -- the two wildlife refuges that they\npoint to both the record shows were used for multiple\npurposes. They were not used solely for conservation\npurposes. And in addition, they were -- to the extent\nthat those refuges adverted to any lands at all -- any\nstatutes, they were referring to a 1925 statute, not --\nnot the 1943 statute.\nFurthermore, there are 24 other refuges that we\nbelieve that Congress intended to retain that Alaska has\nno answer for. One -- one of those refuges, in\nparticular, the Semidi Islands, quite clearly describes\nwithin its boundaries submerged lands, reefs, and other\nareas. It clearly is being used for those purposes. We\nthink the right interpretation of the proviso is clearly\nthat it was meant to ensure, to provide the clarity that\nthis Court needs to determine that Congress clearly did\nintend to retain these lands.\nThat was the point that -- that this proviso, as\nSecretary Chapman himself indicated, and in fact, he\nstated in -- the excerpt appears in page -- on page 47,\nnote 37 of our brief. He stated that these reservations\n-- the land and water would be reserved. He clearly was\naware and told Congress that that was the purpose here, to\nreserve both land and water.\nFinally, I'd like to ask the Court to step back\nand look at the big picture here. The United States'\nposition overall results in a very sensible division of\nsubmerged lands in this case. We have not contested\nAlaska's right to the vast majority of the submerged lands\nhere that are encompassed in Tongass National Forest.\nRather, we've identified two areas where the Federal\nGovernment interests are paramount.\nFirst of all, with regard to drawing\ninternational -- developing international principles to\nestablish baselines, which creates these bays and -- and\npockets, that's a necessary consequence of what our\nforeign policy requires.\nSecondly, where the United States has clearly\nreserved a unique treasure, namely Glacier Bay National\nPark. This park was set aside for the benefit of the\nentire Nation. We think that the Court should adopt the\nmaster's report in full.\nThank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Minear.\nMr. Franklin, you have about 3 and a half\nminutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. FRANKLIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF\nMR. FRANKLIN: Thank you, Your Honor.\nTo get back to the Idaho case, we are, in fact,\nadvocating the principles of that case. It is not\nsufficient that Congress be on notice of a reservation\nthat might include submerged lands. Congress has to take\nsome action to explicitly ratify that. That was what\nhappened in the Idaho case, according to the Court. And\nthe United States has identified one statute and one\nstatute only that it asserts can -- ratifies the bay, and\nthat's section 6(e), the proviso. We think the plain\nlanguage to section (e) -- 6(e) is dispositive in this\ncase.\nWe are operating here under a clear statement\nrule. The presumption is, in fact, the strong presumption\nis, that if Congress does not expressly ratify the\nreservation, Congress is presumed not to have intended\nthat the submerged lands -- title to submerged lands be\ndefeated.\nThere was -- the statute says such transfer\nshall not include. There simply was no need for Congress\nto have included -- to have specified that such transfer,\nthe main clause transfer, shall not include submerged\nlands when they were not included -- or excuse me -- shall\nnot include properties that were not included in the first\nplace. That includes Glacier Bay.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would -- would you respond to\nthe -- to the argument that the Alaska Arctic Coast case\ndecided that the proviso goes beyond subsection (e)?\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well, my -- my first response is\neven the master, who ruled -- who -- who decided against\nus, did not find that the Alaska case decided that, and\nindeed, it could not have because the Court at pages 60\nand 61 expressly assumed that the lands would fall within\nthe proviso. Therefore -- excuse me. The main clause.\nTherefore the Court did not hold and could not have held\nthat lands that did not fall within the main clause were\nincluded by the proviso.\nIt is important, though, to -- to note this,\nthat even if the statute is ambiguous -- and we think that\nit is not -- Alaska still prevails here because a -- there\nis a clear statement rule and a clear statement rule\ncannot be satisfied by definition by an ambiguous statute.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the -- the argument is that\nit is clear because the reservation without the\nreservation of the waters would be crazy.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well, it --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why isn't -- I mean, what's --\nwhat's the answer?\nMR. FRANKLIN: We dispute that for the following\nreason, Your Honor, that -- that the -- the point of the\nmonument was to study the glaciers and the effects of the\nglaciers as they recede on dry land. Title to the\nsubmerged lands was simply not necessary for that purpose.\nBut I think their sky-is-falling argument really\nfalls apart here. All that the counsel can point to is\nthe idea is that they would like scientists to go scuba\ndiving down there and to perhaps look at the bottom.\nThere is absolutely no contention here that Alaska would\n-- would prevent scientists who want to study this --\nthese lands from doing that. We let scientists onto all\nof our properties, all of our submerged lands when they\nhave a good reason for doing it. We hope to work\ncooperatively with the Federal Government on this.\nThe -- the idea that Alaska is somehow going to\nbe less receptive to scientific research here I think\ndemeans our Federal structure. We have a Federal\nstructure here under which sovereignty of submerged lands\nis given to the States because they are viewed as the ones\nprincipally affected by the activities that go on there.\nWe are not planning on -- on preventing scientists from\nscuba diving down there. By the way, they did not at the\ntime of the monument, Your Honor, do scuba diving because\nthere -- there really wasn't any scuba diving going on.\nBut to -- to move on -- I see my time is up.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Franklin.\n"
