SADY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. SADY: Mr. -- Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThe phrase \"term of imprisonment\" appears\nthree times in the first sentence of the Federal good\ntime statute. The first two times the parties are in\nagreement. \"Term of imprisonment\" means \"sentence\nimposed.\" The third use, which sets the rate for good\ntime credit, also means the \"sentence imposed\" when it's\nused in the phrase \"up to 54 days of good time credit\ntowards the service of the sentence.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it doesn't always mean\nthat. I think you say somewhere in your brief that it\nalways means that. It surely does not always mean that.\nBecause in -- what is it, 3624 -- wait a minute, now.\n3624(d) says that, \"Upon the release of a prisoner on\nthe expiration of his term of imprisonment, the Bureau\nof Prisons shall give him clothes, money and\ntransportation.\"\nNow there the expiration of his term of\nimprisonment does not mean the -- the assigned term of\nimprisonment. It means the assigned term of\nimprisonment less all the good time credits he has had.\nMR. SADY: Exactly.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Unless you think they are\nsupposed to give him his clothes, you know, several\nmonths after he leaves.\nMR. SADY: Your Honor, that is a perfect use\nof \"term of imprisonment\" to mean actual time and any\ngood time credits earned.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. SADY: And it uses the term \"release.\"\n\"Release\" is defined in 3624(a), which says that you are\nreleased when you have your actual time served and any\ngood time.\nThe flaw in the Bureau of Prisons system is\nthat they do not give credit towards the term of\nimprisonment as this statute in 3624(b) dictates.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not addressing that.\nAll I'm -- look, it -- the text says \"upon the release\nof a prisoner on the expiration of his term of\nimprisonment.\" My only point is that that -- you have\nto acknowledge that that is a use of the phrase \"term of\nimprisonment\" that does not mean the sentence he was\ngiven, but rather means the sentence that he served.\nMR. SADY: I respectfully disagree because\nit expires. A term of imprisonment, a ten-year\nsentence, expires. When you have 311 days 10 times,\nthat means it has expired, because you also are giving\nthose 54 days of good time credits 10 times.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But why isn't the term of\nimprisonment most reasonably understood to mean the term\nthat is imposed viewed at the time when it is imposed?\nSo that if someone is sentenced to a term of 360 days, 5\nyears, and begins serving his sentence on January 1st,\nyear 1 of the term imposed ends on December 31st of that\nyear; year 2 of the term imposed begins on January 1st\nof the following year, and so forth.\nMR. SADY: Justice Alito, that would be the\nend of the time served for 1 year, but for the term of\nimprisonment, because if we assume at the end of the\n365 days that person has earned maximum good time\ncredit -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Right.\nMR. SADY: That he should receive credit\ntowards the service of the sentence. That means on the\n365th day he should move back on the calendar a\nadjustment for good time and a reset for the next year.\nThat way, if you have a ten-year sentence, you have ten\nopportunities to -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, hang on. I understand\nwhat you are arguing, but I don't understand why the\nterm of imprisonment changes. We look at the -- we look\nat the term of the imprisonment on the day when it is\nimposed and the day when the defendant begins serving\nthe sentence, and you can say: Year one ends at the end\nof 2010; year two ends at the end of 2011.\nWhy do you think that the term -- the phrase\n\"term of imprisonment\" has to change as -- the\nunderstanding of the \"term of imprisonment\" has to\nchange as the prisoner progresses in serving the\nsentence? I totally fail to understand that.\nMR. SADY: It doesn't change. It's still -\nthe two components of a term of imprisonment are actual\ntime and good time credits. So the way we are\npresenting it is the first year of the term of\nimprisonment is the 311 days of actual service and the\n54 days -\nJUSTICE ALITO: But you don't know whether\nthat -- you don't know whether that prisoner is going to\nbe eligible for the 54 days until the 365 days are over.\nMR. SADY: That's fine. We -- if the Bureau\nof Prisons determines that the person should receive up\nto 54 days at day 365, then they receive credit towards\nthe service of their sentence. That means moving it\nback 54 days because they didn't have to serve those\ndays. And then you reset -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I'm not sure where you\nget that -- I'm not sure where you get that out of the\nstatute. But I still don't think you have answered my\nquestion. I don't want to belabor it too much.\nOn the day when the prisoner in my\nhypothetical begins serving his sentence, if you said,\nWhen will your first year of imprisonment -- first year\nof your term of imprisonment end? You would say\nDecember 31st, 2010. When will the second year of the\nterm of imprisonment end? December 31st, 2011. That's\nwhat you would have to say at that point, because you\ndon't know whether the prisoner will earn any good time\ncredits. So why do you think that the meaning of the\nyear of the term of imprisonment changes as the sentence\ngoes on?\nMR. SADY: I do -- do not think it changes.\nI think that it is adjusted for good time, which is\nexactly what Congress intended. They said that every\nday, you get credit beyond time served. They use the\nphrase \"beyond time served\" for credit towards the\nservice -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I'm -- perhaps\nI can, if you will permit me, rephrase Justice Alito's\nquestion in sort of the more simplistic way I looked at\nit.\nWhy is it that we have to do the calculation\nthat you're talking about, which is start at 311 days\nand take back days, which makes no sense to me, or their\nvery complicated ten-page number?\nWhy can't they just take 54 days at the end\nof every year that there is actual service, and that the\ntime served, plus whatever number of days have been\nearned, you subtract it from the term of imprisonment?\nSo if he was imprisoned for 10 years, he got 540 days\nfor whatever it is. At the end of the 9th year, he made\nup whatever -- you added up 9 times 54, and you took it\naway from 10. He serves 9 and that. That would make\nsense of \"beyond the time served\" language that's in\nthis provision.\nMR. SADY: Justice Sotomayor, we are not\nasking -- 311 doesn't have to be the magic day of when\nthey determine whether they should receive it. We are\nsaying, go ahead, assume exactly what they are doing\nnow. Go up to 365 days.\nBut they do make a determination. At that\npoint of making the determination, that's when they go\nback to 54 days and have to reset. That way on a\n10-year sentence you have 10 blocks that Congress\nintended to give prisoners to be able to earn 54 days in\neach of those blocks.\nNow, the way that we were hearing it posited\nfrom Justice Alito, if we have the 54 days on top of\ntime served without any adjustment, then we end up with\na 419-year first day -- first year, and you can only fit\n8 opportunities to earn the 54 days.\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, not at all. No. At the\nend of -- at the end of 2010, in my hypothetical, you\nwould take the 54 days off the end, just as Justice\nSotomayor suggested.\nMR. SADY: And the -\nJUSTICE ALITO: And -- but it doesn't mean\nthat the service doesn't -- your -- your argument is\npredicated on the idea that service of year two begins\non the 311th day.\nMR. SADY: If there is an adjustment for\ngood time, because \"term of imprisonment\" is a term of\nart that doesn't mean time served only. It can mean -\nJUSTICE ALITO: But I don't understand that.\nI will not belabor it. I don't understand why the\nparties have spent so much time sparring over that\nissue, which seems to me to be totally unnecessary and\nirrelevant.\nMR. SADY: Justice Alito, if I could refer\nyou to 3621(a), 3624(a), and 3624(b), each of those\nrefers -- when they are talking about a term of\nimprisonment, each refers to it as \"less good time.\"\nAnd -- and unless you do that, the reason -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, do you do it if\nyou take (a), and (a) says: A prisoner shall be\nreleased by the Bureau of Prisons on the date of the\nexpiration of the prisoner's term of imprisonment -- 10\nyears, we are assuming, an imprisonment -- less any time\ncredited towards the service of the prisoner's sentence,\nas provided in subsection (b).\nMR. SADY: Exactly.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So each year that he\nserved, you add up the number of days he has served, the\ngood time credit, and you subtract them from the\n120 months that you have given him, and you figure out\nwhen he's going to get out. You work backwards, not\nforward, the way everyone seems to be doing.\nMR. SADY: If you do that, you only end up\nwith eight opportunities to -- to have 54 days. That's\nwhy it's the difference between -- I think anybody\nreading -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's the way the\nlanguage is written. So I mean you may want the greater\nopportunity, but it says by its explicit phrase: Terms:\nAt the date of the prisoner's -- expiration of the\nprisoner's term of imprisonment, take that day and\nsubtract from it time credited towards the service of\nthe prisoner's sentence.\nMR. SADY: We are going to -- the rate\nphrase is: Up to 54 days at the end of each year of the\nterm of imprisonment.\nIf there is a 10-year term of imprisonment,\nthat means there's 10 opportunities to earn 54 days.\nThe Bureau of Prisons' math ends up with 470 days,\n70 days less. And the reason for that is that they do\nnot interpret \"term of imprisonment\" to encompass the\npossibility of good time.\nThat is the only -- because you should have\n10 blocks of 365 days. Each of those blocks, you may be\nable to get 54 days. Then it's 311. But maybe you\ndidn't earn any time. Then it would be a 365-block.\nBut the -- actually, the very good idea that Congress\nhad was that you had an incentive at every stage of your\nterm of imprisonment for good behavior.\nEven if you were misbehaving early in your\nprison term, at the end you still have the opportunity\nto earn 54 days against that last 365 days. It counts\nfor every word in the statute. It gives every statute\nmeaning. And it doesn't put us in the position of\ngiving two -- two phrases the exact same meaning in the\nsame sentence.\nThis Court has never found that phrases -\ntwo phrases, uses of \"term of imprisonment\" in the same\nsentence, mean different things.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What do you do with -\nif -- it's a very short sentence? A year and a day, in\nyour view, is a year and a day less 54.\nMR. SADY: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But 360 days, what do you\ndo with that?\nMR. SADY: With 360 -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. If -- suppose it's\nfor -- just -- the whole sentence is 360 days.\nMR. SADY: If it says 366 days, so that the\nyear -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, 360. In other words,\nshort of a year.\nMR. SADY: Then it -- a 360-day sentence\nwould not be eligible, because we -- the parties are\nagreed that \"term of imprisonment\" means a sentence of\nmore than a year. So it has to be more than 365 days.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So the person that gets a\nyear and a day serves less than the person that gets\nless than a year?\nMR. SADY: That is correct. And district\ncourts frequently address that problem. When you have a\nrelatively short sentence, you say: Judge, could you\ngive us -- instead of an 11-month sentence, could you\ngive us a year and a day sentence, so that you could\nearn the good time on that?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How can you earn the good\ntime? I mean you only earn the good time if -- if you\nare a good prisoner for a year.\nMR. SADY: That gets us to the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you are going to let him\nout 54 days before the year, even though he hasn't\nearned the good time in the year?\nMR. SADY: He has.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What did he do? How has\nhe?\nMR. SADY: He has because of the last\nsentence in 3624(b) that says that for the last year or\nportion of the year, that you go ahead and establish the\ntwo-step process. First, you figure out the projected\nrelease date, which is a release date with maximum good\ntime. Then you make the decision about whether the\nprisoner should receive that within six weeks of that -\nof that projected release date.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but that still\ncouldn't give him the full 54 days, because there's only\n42 days in six weeks.\nMR. SADY: That's only a measure when you\nmake the determination. They -- they were recognizing\nthat for the last period of time, or for a year and a\nday sentence, that you are not going to be able to do\nthe time all the time, but you will, so that's why there\nis a special mechanism at the end.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But I'm saying the special\nmechanism can't give the full 54 days.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Because they don't make it\nuntil 42 days before the end of the sentence.\nMR. SADY: They make it until 311 days at\nthe end of the sentence, because what they do is they\nmake the -- they figure out what the maximum good time\nwould be, which would be 312 days on a 300 and -- on a\nyear and a day sentence, and they make that\ndetermination earlier.\nThey say, okay, you have been good for that\nperiod of time. We recognize that this is going to be a\nproblem, the same problem you would have on a sentence\nof 10 years and 6 months, where you have to prorate the\ncredit, 27 days instead of 54, half, and then figure out\nthe projected release date with 180 days, subtract the\n27 days, and then make the determination sometime within\nthe 6 weeks up to that last point.\nSo that there is a mechanism for\nunderstanding that it is -- that in the last year there\nis going -- going to be an assumption that if you are\nbehaving all the way up to -- in the full sentence -\nday 311, you should get the full 54 days.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sure there is\nsomething wrong with this predicate to this question,\nbut the -- the statute allows the Bureau to make a\ndetermination of good time credit within 15 days after\nthe end of each year of the sentence.\nMR. SADY: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They cannot make\nthat determination within 15 days of the 311 days. And\nso \"each year of the sentence\" must mean each -- the\nfull year, the 365 days.\nMR. SADY: Our position is that the Bureau\nof Prisons can make its determination as it pleases.\nWe -- we are asking the Court to do -- to construe a\nstatute, not write a policy statement. So we understand\nthat there are going to be some mechanics of it. But\nthe mechanics in this work very easily with the\nassurance that they are receiving good time credit\nagainst the period of the sentence imposed by the judge.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You treat each year\nof the sentence as the 311 days if there has been good\nbehavior, no?\nMR. SADY: Not necessarily. We are --\nI'm -- if the Bureau of Prisons wants to make that\ndetermination at day 365, that's fine, as long as they\nadjust by doing exactly what the statute says: Credit\ntowards the service of the sentence, move it back 40 -\n54 days, and then reset. If you do that, you have 10\nblocks of 365 days.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why do you do have to\ndo that? I mean you read it. It so complicated. Just\nreading this, I -- I think the language should say this:\n10 years, he's got a 10-year sentence. At the end of\nthe first year you write the number 54 on a piece of\npaper if he has done well.\nSuppose he comes in on January 1, okay? So\nJanuary 2, after the first year, you write the word\n50 -- the number 54. And you do that each year. And by\nthe time you get to the year 8, what you have done is\nyou have got 432 days.\nSo then you subtract the 430 days from 10\nyears, and what you get is you are 67 days short of 9\nyears. So now you look at the last sentence, and what\nyou do is you take 67 days, subtract that from 365, and\nyou've got 298, and you simply prorate for those 298.\nAnd you subtract that, too, so he gets another 10 days\nor so, or 15 days credit, and that's it.\nAnd that's following the statute, it seems\nto me, absolutely literally. And it also seems to me to\nmake sense, because you don't want to give him credit\nfor time he never serves.\nMR. SADY: Justice Breyer, I think it\ndoesn't make sense, because what it does is it creates\nan 87.2 minimum sentence that is served, and we note\nthat the sentencing table upon which every Federal\nsentence is predicated is based on 85 percent. That\nbeing -\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, that isn't what the -\nif you want to know what the sentencing commission did,\nI think the best evidence of that is you read the\nintroduction to the guidelines. And what the\nintroduction to the guidelines says is that, roughly\nspeaking, many of the sentences approximate the time\nactually served before.\nNow, what to me that suggests is that the\nsentencing commission never considered this question.\nAnd if there's something more specific than that, that\nshows they did, I would like to know what it is, because\nI don't trust memory.\nMR. SADY: Your Honor, we are relying very\nheavily on the supplemental report at -- at page 140 of\nthe joint appendix that says we -- we divide it by .85\nin order to calibrate the sentencing table to include\ngood time. That means that every sentence has been\ncalibrated based on assuming 10 opportunities to earn\n54 days, which -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, the government\ncontends it's none of the sentencing commission's\nbusiness. It's up to the Bureau of Prisons. Isn't that\nthe government's position?\nMR. SADY: That is their position. And our\nposition is that it's -- administering the statute is\nthe Bureau of Prisons's business, but deciding what the\nminimum sentence that can -- minimum time that can be\nserved to satisfy a term of imprisonment is a policy\ndecision, and that the policy is properly placed -\nJUSTICE BREYER: But there is nothing in\nthere -- that's not a policy statement; that's not a\nguideline. That's a staff conclusion. And the staff\nconclusion, I think, is conflicting with what it says in\nthe -- in the introduction to the guidelines, which is\nthat all of this was very approximate. I don't see\nhow -- how -- a court would be bound by that.\nMR. SADY: I think that the court could be\nadvised by it in terms of knowing that we are looking at\na harsher sentence. Everybody is serving more time than\n-- the sentence that the judge imposed was -- whether it\nwas advisory guidelines or mandatory guidelines, the\nsentencing table provided the initial baseline.\nAnd that initial baseline was boosted by 2.2\npercent, which is not an insignificant amount, and there\nis a very simple way for the court to construe the\nstatute consistently throughout to conform the two, so\nthat people are not serving 2.2 percent more time in\ncustody than the sentencing table that every judge uses\nin imposing their sentence.\nWe are institutionalizing a harsher system\nin a way that doesn't meet the statutory language,\nbecause the statutory language says \"term of\nimprisonment.\"\nAnd if it's term of imprisonment, 10 years\nof a term of imprisonment, I think a reasonable plain\nmeaning is that you have 10 opportunities to earn\n54 days.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Sady, you -- you said\nsomething about 15 percent or 85 percent is a more\nworkable system than -- was it 12.9 percent?\nDo we have any information on, (A), the\nnumber of Federal prisoners who get good time and in\nthat universe, the ones who get good time, how many get\nthe full credit and how many get something less than the\nfull 54 days?\nMR. SADY: Justice Ginsburg, there are\napproximately 200,000 prisoners, and of those about\n195,000 of them are eligible for good time credits.\nMy anecdotal experience is that most\nprisoners get most of the -- the good time credits, so\nit's not at all unusual for prisoners to achieve most of\nthat. There is some that have minor amounts, and there\nis a relatively smaller number, at least in my\nexperience, who do not get a lot of it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is this right? I'm -- I'm\nsorry to ask you this question, but I get lost in the\nmath of this sometimes.\nDo you remember my example I just gave, you\nknow, with the 9 years you go and put it on a piece of\npaper?\nMR. SADY: Yes, the 419 -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I take it what you want is\nyou, in -- in essence, want him to get credit for\n54 days for that tenth year?\nMR. SADY: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. And the argument\nagainst that, reading the language and so forth, is,\nwell, look this is an imaginary 10th year. He is not\nactually in prison for 10 years. He is going to be\nreleased sometime late in year 8. And so why should we\nadd 54 days? I mean maybe it would be a nice thing\nbecause sentences are awfully long, but -- but why would\nanybody want to add 54 days in respect to a year that's\nnever going to be served?\nMR. SADY: Each year is served in the -- if\nyou take away the 54 days, if you credit it towards the\nservice of the sentence and do the adjustment and reset\nthat we are asking the Court to do so that you have 10\nopportunities, then in the last year, you are -- when\nyou are in -- you go to the last sentence that\nacknowledges that you are going to have to make some\narbitrary time that you are going to, say, okay, we are\ngoing to decide that you have done well enough that you\nare going to be able to get the full credit for the last\nyear.\nBut the flaw in the Bureau of Prisons is by\nhaving the 54 days and actual time and that that's what\nhappens at the first year, that's a 419-day first year.\nYou can only squeeze 8 of those in. The prisoners look\nat it and they see, plain statute, what was your term of\nimprisonment, how many ends of each year of a term of\nimprisonment should you have in a 10-year sentence. Ten\nyears.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, the statute says that\nit is -- the credit, it can be received, quote, at the\nend of each year of the prisoner's term of imprisonment\nbeginning at the end of the first year of the term.\nMR. SADY: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Now, when does -- when is\nthat point, in your opinion?\nMR. SADY: The Bureau of Prisons probably\nhas discretion in administering. I'm accepting as a\nproposition on the day 365 they make that determination.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Okay. So the -- day 365 is\nthe end of the first year of -- of the term of\nimprisonment?\nMR. SADY: That's -- that's when they are\nmaking the determination. If they make a determination\nthat he is -- should receive credit, then the end of the\nfirst year becomes day 311, because he has received -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And then what do -\nMR. SADY: -- 311.\nJUSTICE ALITO: The statute says that\nthey -- that the prisoner may receive credit at the end\nof each year of the prisoner's term of imprisonment\nbeginning at the end of the first year of the term.\nMR. SADY: No.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And what I'm asking is, when\nis the end of the first year of the term within the\nmeaning of that language?\nMR. SADY: The meaning of that language is\nday 3 -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is it day 3 -\nMR. SADY: Excuse me.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is it day 365, or is it day\n311?\nMR. SADY: It depends. And the reason it\ndepends is because the language of the statute says\n\"credit toward the service of prisoner's sentence beyond\ntime served,\" so if you do it beyond time served and you\ngive him credit towards that sentence -- the Bureau of\nPrisons is making a determination. Once we -- they make\ntheir determination, and we respect that determination,\nwe then have to go -- from the 365th day, back, because\nfor 54 of those days he doesn't have to be there. He\nhas earned that time and you can -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So the next year -\nMR. SADY: -- adjust and reset at the next\n365.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- you start it at 311?\nMR. SADY: No.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And he now serves\nanother year and you back him up again at the end of\nthat year? To 300 -\nMR. SADY: Yes, that is -- that is certainly\none way of mechanically doing it so that you have 10\nblocks of 365 days each as a term of imprisonment.\nBecause term of -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And you -- and you think\nthat their system is easier?\nMR. SADY: Yes.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That their system is -\nMR. SADY: No, absolutely not. Their -\ntheir system makes -- nobody can understand the math.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Another way to think, and I\nthink probably you'll -- if you look through the records\nof the commission, they even thought about this problem,\nand the -- the -- you will see a lot of talks given by\nvarious people who were there, which say that for this\nreason you are bringing up, that it might have been\nthought there was no credit for the first year.\nIn other words, you don't cut the sentence\nin the first year. You don't begin cut until the second\nyear has been served, so he has to serve 365 days. Now\nwhen you point that out, that is not the Bureau of\nPrisons's interpretation, that's nobody's\ninterpretation. They're all going to let him out if\nit's a year and a day. They are going to let him out\nseveral weeks before the end of the first year, aren't\nthey?\nMR. SADY: Yes. There was a technical\namendment.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Everybody's going to do\nthat. Oh -- there was a technical amendment.\nMR. SADY: To address that first year, to\nmake sure that they did that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's what happened. In\nother words, the statute made before -\nMR. SADY: Exactly.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Ah, I better get that -\nMR. SADY: -- when it was at 36 days. And\nit's interesting, so page 56 of the -- of the Senate\nreport on this, they used the term \"adjust for good\ntime.\" Now that -- then it was 36 days. But Congress\nwas using exact same thought as the language here that\nsays that the time is -- that you give credit towards\nthe service of a sentence.\nAnd with the Court's permission I will\nreserve the remaining time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Wall.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. WALL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nJustice Breyer, I think you stole my\nthunder. I wanted to explain how the bureau does it,\nand you laid it out exactly right. If you have -- and I\nthink just looking at the language of the statute, it\ntracks perfectly. If you have a prisoner serving a\n10-year sentence and he comes in on January 1st, the end\nof his first year of imprisonment is December 31st, and\non that date he gets 54 days taken off the back end of\nthe sentence. That cycle repeats itself for the next 8\nyears. And -\nJUSTICE BREYER: But the trouble with that,\nand I'm glad to know about that technical amendment,\nbecause then -\nMR. WALL: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- we never considered it\nwhen I was on the -- nobody thought about it at that\ntime because the language was different.\nBut now that you had have got this language\nnow, it's hard to reconcile with that first year. He is\nsentenced for a year and a day, you see. So literally,\nit says calculated on January 2 of the next year. But\nhe's already been in for longer than he should be by\nthat point. So you really have to calculate it before\nthe year ends; you have to calculate it at least by\nOctober.\nAnd -- and -- and once you start calculating\nit before, the statute literally says, we are into a\nmore complicated thing than I thought.\nMR. WALL: Well, and that's why they have\nthe sentence at the end, as you pointed out about the\nproration. So when the -- when the statute says, what\nit says -- starts by saying is, if you are serving a\nsentence of longer than a year you are eligible for good\ntime credit. So you are earning credit as you go\nthrough that first year.\nCongress knew then if you had have a year\nand a day sentence, you wouldn't be actually serving a\nfull year because of the credits bringing you below the\nyear mark. So what it does in the last sentence, it\nsays if you are in your last year and that's a partial\nyear, we prorate. So on your 319th day you have earned\n47 days of good time credit. Those combined equal a\nsentence of a year and a day, and you are out after your\n319th day. On the hypothetical -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There is a premise flaw\nthere. And that premise flaw is that you have told us\nthat you don't earn the credit until the end of the\nyear.\nMR. WALL: Well -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So your answer about\nthis probation is not an answer, because it's -- your\npremise is not the same.\nMR. WALL: That's why for each full year\nserved, so for a 10-year sentence, you are right that\nyou are making a determination at the end of the year\nfor the first 8 years, but when you get to that ninth\nyear, as Justice Breyer pointed out -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not worried about\nsentences that are more than 2 years. I'm worried about\nthe prisoner who is sentenced to a year and a day. How\ndoes that proration help that individual, since they are\nnot going to get the good time credit until they've\nserved a year?\nMR. WALL: So, the way this works is that\nfor the prisoner sentenced to a year and a day or\n13 months or 14 months, because they are receiving\ncredit through that first year, their good time credit\nbrings them below a year. They'll never serve a full\nyear.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I -\nMR. WALL: And what the law -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's what I'm saying\nto you. The whole brief says to us, they measure the\nentitlement to good time credit at the end of the first\nyear.\nMR. WALL: Except for the last year or\npartial year. And what the final sentence of B1 says\nis, credit for the last year or portion of a year of the\nterm of imprisonment shall be prorated and credited\nwithin the last 6 weeks. So for the prisoner who has a\nyear and a day sentence, his sentence is literally all\nproration. He is just serving a partial year.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: He is not going to get\n54 days? He's going to get -\nMR. WALL: That's right. On the 319th day\nhe has come through about nine tenths of the year, he\nhas accrued 47 days.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I just want to make\nabsolutely sure because I hadn't done the math forward;\nI did the math backwards.\nMR. WALL: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which was the one that\nJustice Breyer and Justice Alito set forth -\nMR. WALL: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which is 54 days are\nearned back for each year, and you take it off the full\nterm of imprisonment.\nThe -- you are representing to me that the\nmath that is in your program statement is accomplishing\nthat result?\nMR. WALL: Absolutely. Which is to say when\nthe prisoner gets to his last year, if that's a partial\nyear, he is not going to get the 54 days, he's going to\nget some portion of the 54 days, based on what part of a\nyear he served. And that is prorated and credited\nwithin the last 6 weeks. Now, it's normally done on the\nrelease date. So in that 9th year for the 10-year\nprisoner -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I just interrupt with\none question? If he got a total of 540 or whatever it\nis, he should never enter the 9th year because he would\nfinish the 10-year sentence in less than 8 years.\nMR. WALL: Well -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Or less than 9 years,\nrather.\nMR. WALL: That's -- that's right. 540\nwouldn't be quite 2 years, but setting that to the\nside -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So how does he -- how does\nhe get his 10th block of good time? How does he ever\nget it under your -\nMR. WALL: Well, under the government's view\nhe can only earn good time credit when he is actually\nincarcerated. And what Petitioners are coming in and\nsaying -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right. I understand. But\nexplain to me how -- how he can get more than a year of\ngood time credit before the 10th year begins?\nMR. WALL: Well, so, if you take a 10-year\nprisoner -- a prisoner with a 10-year sentence, the way\nit currently works, at the end of the 8th year he has\naccrued 432 days of good time credit.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Which is more than a year.\nMR. WALL: Right. So he knocked off his\nfull 10th year and he's knocked off a part of his 9th\nyear. Now we are at that final 9th year, which is a\nprorated year. He has got 298 days left and by the\n260th day he earned 38 days of credit. So he is\nreleased after the 260th day of his 9th year.\nAnd as Justice Breyer pointed out, that\nprecisely tracks the language of the statute. You do it\nat the end of each full year until you get to the last\npartial year, and then you prorate and you do it in the\nlast 6 weeks.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And each of those 4 years\nincluded 54 days of credit?\nMR. WALL: That's right. So the -- the\nPetitioners here, Petitioner Barber, for instance, has\nbeen incarcerated for over 17 years. At the end of each\nof his 17 years in prison, he has gotten 54 days of\ncredit. What Petitioner Barber is here saying is, I am\ngoing to get 3 whole years knocked off the end of my\nsentence; I want the 54 days for those years, too.\nI want 54 days for every year of my sentence\nas imposed by the court, not as served by me behind\nbars, and that's what doesn't track the language of the\nstatute. Because the only way you can do that, as\nJustice Alito pointed out, is to read \"year\" to mean\n311 days, and it is no answer to say, as Petitioners do,\nwell, you can do the determination whenever. What they\nare saying is at the end of a 311-day period, you should\ndetermine whether the prisoner gets the credit.\nBut what the statute says is the\ndetermination itself has to occur at the end of the\nyear. So you can't fold the 54 days into the year\nbecause you haven't made the determination yet.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I didn't understand\nthem to be saying that. I understood them to be saying\nthat the determination could be made at the end of\n365 days, but if it's determined that the prisoner is\nentitled to 54 days of credit, then year 1 should be\nregarded as having begun on the 312th day, rather than\nthe 366th day.\nMR. WALL: I think that's right, which first\nit is inconsistent with the language of the statute,\nwhich says at the end of each year, so that reads \"year\"\nto be an 311-day cycle. But it also sets up a very odd\nsystem. What happens if the prisoner misbehaves during\ndays 312 and day 365?\nOn Petitioner's approach, it seems to me,\nthe new year has started on day 312. Now, but take the\nexample, he says, well, you can do it on the 365th day.\nWell, if the prisoner's misbehaved on day 340, is that\ncoming out of the first year or out of the second year.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I think that they\nwould say you won't know when the second year has begun\nuntil the full calendar year has been completed.\nMR. WALL: And I guess the -- the difficulty\nwith that approach is that it seems to me that once the\n311-day cycle is finished, you have to start a new\n311-day cycle on day 312.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, they are just not\nvested until the year has -- the full year has passed.\nMR. WALL: Well, so vesting is a little bit\nunique, Justice Kennedy, under the statute, because none\nof the time vests under (b)(2) until they are actually\nreleased. But -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I use it just\nin the calculating sense.\nMR. WALL: I see -- I see what you're\nsaying. They could do the bookkeeping determination on\nday 365. But I don't think that's what's important.\nWhat is important is that on Petitioner's view, the\nsecond year, for credit purposes, has to start on day\n312. You have to have 10 blocks of 311 days and you\nhave to be measuring after every 311th day.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, you don't\nmeasure -- I don't think that -- you -- you begin\nmeasuring on 311, but you measure 365 days from -- from\n311. And if he has behaved well during all -- all of\nthose 365 days, then you knock off another 51 days or\nwhatever it is. And you begin the third year from then,\nbut you give him another 365 days to determine whether\nhe has behaved well.\nMR. WALL: Justice Scalia, if you are\nmeasuring 365 days from day 311 -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. WALL: -- then you should equally be\nmeasuring 365 days from day 1. Which is to say, if\nyou're doing -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He did. He did. You\ndidn't give him the credit until he served the whole\n365 days. At that point, he gets the credit and you\ncount the second year as though it begins on day 311.\nMR. WALL: Well, the -- I was half with you\nthere.\nThe bureau does do it by looking at what\nthey do during the full year, from January 1 to\nDecember 31, and then it determines whether you get\n54 days knocked off the end of your sentence. What\nhappens between day 311 and day 365 is not different\nthan what happens during the rest of the year.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly.\nMR. WALL: What the -- what the statute asks\nthe bureau to determine is, at the end of each year,\nhas, during that year, the prisoner demonstrated\nexemplary compliance with institutional regulations? So\nthe prisoner has got to go a full year, a full 365 days,\nand be well-behaved. Then he gets 54 days taken off the\nback end of the sentence. And if that's the way that\nyou're saying it should work, that is precisely how the\nbureau interprets the statute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Except that they're not\ntaking it off from the back end. They are taking it off\nfrom the next year. So that in the second year, if he\n-- if he behaves well for 365 days from 311 -- okay? He\nbehaves well for the next 365 days. The next year will\nbegin at 622.\nBut then he has to serve another 365 days\nbefore he gets good time credit. And then the next year\nwill begin three times 311: 933. And so forth.\nMR. WALL: Justice Alito, I think that sets\nup an odd system.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that right? See, he\nagrees with me.\n(Laughter.)\nNo, I'm not saying that's right. I'm saying\nthat that's -- that is what he is proposing.\nMR. WALL: No, I -- I agree. That is the\ndifference. Petitioners think that you measure credit\nover these 311-day cycles, and if you -- you know, you\nget to the 311th day, you take the 54 days of credit,\nand together, they equal a year of the sentence imposed.\nBut what the statute says is you make the\ndetermination at the end of the year. And we don't read\n\"year\" to be a 311-day period. We read it to be a\n365-day period.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but as Justice Scalia\nsays, you know, you do make the determination on the\n365th day, but what you determine is that the -- having\nbeen a good prisoner, his first year expired 54 days\nearlier, and then you start over.\nMR. WALL: But what -- that's right. But\nwhat the statute -- the statute doesn't just say,\nJustice Stevens, you make the determination at the end\nof the first year of the term. The determination is\nthat during that year, the prisoner has displayed\ncompliance. So he has got to display compliance through\nday 1 through day 365.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me interrupt and get\none thing off my mind that I just -- supposing he\nmisbehaves in year 3. Does that just affect his good\ntime credits in year 3, or does it mean he is canceled\nfor years 1 and 2?\nMR. WALL: No. He can lose credit that he\nhas accrued up to that point, but he can't lose credit\nthat he has -- that he is eligible for in future years.\nSo let's say that we are coming up on the end of the 3rd\nyear. He's earned his full 108 days for his first two\nyears, and he has earned some prorated portion. He can\nlose any of that, but he is still eligible going forward\nto keep getting 54 days at the end of each year.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But he can lose his\n108 days?\nMR. WALL: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How can he do that?\nI'm looking at page 14A of your appendix. It says:\nSuch credit toward service of sentence vests at the time\nthat it is received. Credit that is vested may not\nlater be withdrawn.\nMR. WALL: I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice. I\nshould have been more clear.\nFor prisoners sentenced subject to the SRA,\nwhich was in effect from 1987 to 1994, you are right.\nAnd that is the SRA according to your brief.\nTheir credit vests. That vesting\nrequirement was eliminated in the PLRA, which governs\nprisoner's sentences since 1986. So for the vast bulk\nof prisoners in the Federal system who are subject to\nthe PLRA, their credit does not vest until they are\nreleased.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Wall, the -- if we\nconsider both methods plausible, the number comes out at\n15 percent -- 85 percent, 15 percent. It's a more\nworkable number, and there are some hints in the\nlegislative history that Congress thought 85 percent,\nnot 87.2 or whatever it is.\nSo in choosing between those two methods,\nwhy not take the easier number to work with?\nMR. WALL: Well, two reasons. I think to\nthe extent that you are suggesting the statute is\nambiguous, the Bureau of Prisons is charged by Congress\nwith administering the statute in both Reno v. Koray and\nLopez v. Davis. This Court deferred to the bureau's\ninterpretation of other prisoner credit statutes. We\nthink the bureau is equally entitled to the same\ndiscretion here to interpret this statute.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: We -- if we disagree with\nthat, if we disagree that the BOP has authority in this\narea, then -- as Justice Ginsburg's question, I think,\nsuggests -- does not the Rule of Lenity apply?\nMR. WALL: Well, this Court's been clear -\nand I -- I can't put it any better than Justice\nSotomayor did in her first opinion in Sash -- that this\nis not a criminal statute. It neither imposes a\ncriminal prohibition on conduct nor -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, how do you explain\nthe Granderson case?\nMR. WALL: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The Granderson case.\nMR. WALL: I'm not familiar with that case,\nJustice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I had thought that in that\ncase, Justice Ginsburg, for this Court, established the\nproposition that the Rule of Lenity is applicable. I\nknow it wasn't cited in the Petitioner's brief, either.\nThat was a parole revocation case.\nBut in -- in any event, the -- shouldn't the\nRule of Lenity apply? If the Rule of Lenity is thought\nof as a notice requirement insofar as giving you warning\nto what conduct is punishable, that's one thing, but\ndoesn't the Rule of Lenity mean more than that? It's a\ncheck against the power of the State, so that you simply\nmitigate the -- the power of the State in favor of the\nindividual. In a case like this, apply the Rule of\nLenity.\nMR. WALL: I think it's a check against the\npower of the State when it's penalizing conduct or when\nit's putting forth a penalty for a criminal prohibition.\nBut in both Koray and Lopez, this Court was considering\nwhat prisoner credit statutes meant, other prisoner\ncredit statutes. 18 U.S.C. 3585 and 3621. And in both\nof those, it deferred to the bureau's interpretation.\nAnd in both, it specifically rejected application of the\nRule of Lenity.\nAnd I think the notion there is that this\nstatute is not a criminal statute. It's about an\nadministrative reward for compliance with institutional\nregulations. And that's different from setting forth a\nprohibition on conduct where the penalty that someone is\nsentenced to by a court once they have been convicted of\na criminal offense -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the Granderson case\nis cited in the brief for the National Association Of\nCriminal Defense Lawyers, and as I read it, it applies\nto this area and it seems to me that it ought to.\nI mean, you tell us this is not a criminal\nstatute. I -- I certainly think it has -- it has all\nthe impact and force of the State detaining a person for\na criminal act.\nMR. WALL: Well, it is a statute that\ndetermines in some sense how long you will be in prison,\nso I take your point. But it does so not by extending\nthe penalty applicable to the conduct, but by offering\nan administrative reward; sort of relieving you of part\nof the burden of that -- that penalty.\nAnd I am not aware of any case -- and I am\nobviously not familiar with Granderson, but I am not\naware of any case from this Court, or indeed any lower\ncourt, finding that section 3624 is a criminal statute,\nas this Court's cases uses the term.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but isn't there\nanother consideration? It's not the Rule of Lenity, but\nit's something else we should take into account.\nIn the -- in their reply brief, they say it\ncosts about 25 or $26,000 to house a particular\nprisoner, and the number of prisoners involved is -\nsomething like $100 million in taxpayers' money is at\nissue in this case. It -- is -- you don't disagree with\nthat general figure, do you?\nMR. WALL: I'm -- I think the basis for that\nis just math that the Petitioners have done. I don't\nhave any independent basis for confirming or denying it.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But in any event, it's\nclear it's a lot of money. And -- and is that not a\nfactor that we should be aware of in this case, because,\nall other things being equal -- assume the statute is\ntotally ambiguous, and if you -- if one -- one -- one\nversion will save the -- the government $100 million a\nyear and the other version will cost it, is that -\nisn't that a factor we -- we should take into\nconsideration?\nMR. WALL: I think it's a factor that the\nbureau could, should and has taken into consideration in\nthe developing its interpretation as the agency in\ncharge of administering the statute. But what the\nbureau has found is that it's method allows you to earn\ngood time for all the time you are incarcerated, so you\nalways have incentive to follow prison regulations.\nAnd what Petitioners haven't responded to\nand the government's point in our brief that if you\nstart measuring by 311-day cycles, you are assuming that\nthey getting the full 54 days of credit. And to the\nextent that they don't, no matter how they calculate it,\nJustice Scalia, no matter what their matter of\nbookkeeping is, if they don't get the 54 days of credit\nfor each cycle, there will be some corresponding period\nat the end of the sentence when they are serving time\nand they have already had their ten -- you know, their\nreviews and they are no longer eligible for the -\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's true. But the\nstrongest argument -- I -- I don't want to put words in\nhis mouth because this is complicated. But I see it as\nthis. Let's call that time you are talking about, that\ntenth year, phantom time.\nMR. WALL: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, you are saying don't\nput in any phantom time. And he's saying let's put some\nin.\nNow, the strong -- a strong argument, I\nthink, for his is the following -- think about that\nfirst year. That first year we are going to calculate\n54 days, subtract it, everybody seems to agree we get to\nthe number 311, right?\nBut if you were to apply the last sentence\nto that first year, the prorating sentence, you wouldn't\nget 54. You would get like 45 days, or 47 or something\nlike that. But everybody agrees under the Bureau of\nPrisons system that it is 54. And, therefore, in\nrespect to the first year, they are calculating phantom\ntime, i.e., not the first year, but a person who had a\nsentence to a year and a day. If you had a sentence to\na year and a day, you agree it's 54 days, and everybody\nagrees with that, and that includes phantom time.\nSo he said, well, if you include it for the\nfirst year, since the statute says nothing about the\nfirst year, why not include it for the other years, too?\nHow can you possibly justify phantom time being included\nin the first year but not in the other years?\nMR. WALL: Justice Breyer, I disagree with\nyour premise. Someone sentenced to a year and a day is\neligible for credit, but because that person is accruing\ncredit as he serves, he will never actually get 54 days.\nBy the time he gets to the 319th day, he has accrued\n47 days of credit, those combine to equal his 366-day\nsentence.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, in other words, they\ndon't let him out under 311?\nMR. WALL: That's -- that's exactly -\nJUSTICE BREYER: In other words, the Bureau\nof Prisons for a person whose has a sentence of a year\nand a day does not let him out 54 days short, rather\nthey let him out 47 days short, because they apply the\nlast sentence in the prorating of that sentence?\nMR. WALL: And that's exactly our difference\nwith Petitioner's view. Exactly. What Petitioner -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that -- is that what\nhappens?\nMR. WALL: Yes. Yes. He is released after\nthe 319th day.\nAnd I think what Petitioners actually want\nis phantom time even in the first year. What they are\nsaying is fine, he may only serve 311 days, 312 days,\n319 days, we want the full 54. So, instead of letting\nhim out at 319, back him up to 312, we want the phantom\nweek in the first year.\nAnd, so, I think the way the bureau\ninterprets it, there is no phantom time in any year.\nThe way the Petitioners interpret it, there is phantom\ntime in every year, no matter the length of the\nsentence. As I said I think it creates a gap in\ncoverage. It rests on this assumption that prisoners\nare always getting 54 days. That is just not the case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you disagree with your\ncolleague that that is the case most of the time, that\nmost Federal prisoners get good time credit, and of the\nones who get credit, most of them get the full 54 days?\nMR. WALL: There are no statistics on this,\nbut, yes, Justice Ginsburg, I think the majority of\nprisoners do earn the full credit, certainly these\nPetitioners have. But I would say that there are, say,\n15 to 20 percent Federal prisoner who tend to be repeat\noffenders, and they are often being docked to good time\ncredit.\nSo, I think what you will see is that the\nones getting 54 days do it consistently, and the ones\nnot getting 54 days, often do that pretty consistently.\nAnd, you know, the difficulty on Petitioner's method is\nthat no matter when you want to do that calculation,\nPetitioners at bottom are saying what you should be\nlooking at is a 311-day period, and you take the\n311 days served, you take the 54 days of credit, and\ntogether they give you a year of the sentence imposed.\nAnd not only does that not serve penological\ninterest, as the bureau has found, but it just doesn't\ntrack the language of the statute, which says during\neach year you have got to comply with the regulations.\nThe statute cares not just about your conduct from days\n1 to 311, but your conduct from day 312 to 365. All of\nthose days are equal in the statute's eyes. If you want\n54 days of credit knocked off the back end of your\nsentence, you have got to behave and comply with the\nrules for a full year each time you want the credit.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, this\nexplanation that has been given in your brief and the\none you are giving to us now as to why BOP chose what it\ndid, is there any statement outside of the penned\naffidavit that explains why this choice was made?\nMR. WALL: Other than the positions -\npositions that the bureau has taken before the 11 courts\nof appeals in which it has prevails, no, the -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But in each one of them\nthey have taken the position that the statute was\nunambiguous. Assuming that that is not accepted by us,\nthat it's ambiguous, what and where are we giving\nChevron or Skidmore deference to what set of facts or to\nwhat -\nMR. WALL: Two points, Justice Sotomayor. I\ndon't think the bureau has always taken the position\nthat the statute is unambiguous. It has taken the\nfallback position, and it has prevailed on this position\nin a number of courts of appeals. And it is worth\npointing out the bureau has prevailed in the First\nthrough the Eleventh Circuits. It has won in 11 court\nof appeals. And it has often prevailed on the ground\nthat it had discretion to interpret the statute to the\nextended it was ambiguous.\nYour second point, what would you defer\nto -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, did they exercise\ndiscretion when they took the position that it was\nunambiguous?\nMR. WALL: As the pen declaration makes\nclear, and this is at page 154 of the Joint Appendix,\nwhen the bureau promulgated its rule in 1997, it did\nthat based on the statutory language and on making a\npolicy choice to accommodate penological interest,\nensuring that credit would always be an incentive to\ngood behavior and providing clear notice to inmates of\ntheir projected release dates. So, I think -- you know,\nthe government has -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We have never given\ndeference, have we, to an affidavit submitted in\nlitigation to explain something that on its face is not\nexplained either in an agency's regulation or in its\npolicy statement that -- that -- this is giving\ndeference to an affidavit.\nMR. WALL: Well, it's giving deference to\nthe rule, because the affidavit informs the court that\nthe rule is an exercise of the bureau's discretion. So\nfar as I know, the court has never faced that question\nbut the lower courts have. And a number of courts of\nappeals faced with rulemaking and informal adjudication\nhave accepted supplementation of the record with\naffidavits and declarations very much like this one.\nBecause what we are talking about here is an affidavit\nfrom one of the agency's original decisionmakers.\nIf this was just a post hyperactualization,\nI grant you it might not be enough. But this is one of\nthe bureau's lawyers involved in the decisionmaking in\nthe mid-1980's coming in and saying, here is why we\nadopted the interpretation -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Subsequent legislative\nhistory, so to speak, right?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, we -- we wouldn't\nallow that -- those of us who use legislative history\ndon't allow a congressman to come in several years after\nthe bill has passed and say, oh, by the way, the reason\nwe voted for that is thus and such. We would kick that\nout.\nWhy is it any different for an agency's\nsubsequent statement?\nMR. WALL: Justice Scalia, I think it is\ndifferent because that would be broadside in Overton\nPark. And what this Court said is if there is not\nenough in the agency action itself to enable judicial\nreview, the right answer is not to set it aside, the\nright answer is to send it back to the agency to let the\nagency decision makers explain why they did what they\ndid.\nAnd while that might normally be the right\ncourse here, the agency has already done that. It has\nput forward its explanation, so I think this is one of\nthe rare circumstances where we don't need to remand on\nOverton Park. We know why the agency adopted the rule,\nand it did it both because of the statutory language and\nbecause they thought it was the most sensible policy\nchoice.\nAnd I guess I would turn it around a little\nbit and say you have a rule promulgated by the agency\ncharged with administering the statute, an agency to\nwhich this Court has twice deferred in the\ninterpretation of similar statutes. That rule has been\nupheld as a substantive matter now in 11 courts of\nappeals.\nThe Ninth Circuit set the rule aside on a\nprocedural basis, which has now been corrected by the\nagency. It's a republished rule which corrects the\ninfirmities that the court of appeals identified.\nAnd, so, the question is, faced with those\nfacts, what would be the point of asking the government\nto recalculate 195,000 Federal sentences?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think we sent cases\nback under Overton Park for an agency's description of\nhistory. I think we sent it back for the agency to give\na reason for its rule, whether that's its current reason\nor its past reason. It -- it's the current reason that\ncounts.\nMR. WALL: Justice Scalia, even -- even if\nyou thought as the court of appeals did that the rule\nwas procedurally invalid, you would still, as the court\nof appeals did, defer to the program statement under\nsome level of deference, at least Skidmore.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't have to worry\nabout me.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm -- I'm willing to\naccept the -- the government's assertion here that\nthat's the government's position.\nMR. WALL: And I -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think you are\nlying.\nMR. WALL: I -- I -\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WALL: My only point, Justice Scalia,\nwas that whether you get there by deferring to the rule\nor by deferring to the program statement, as the court\nof appeals did, every court of appeals to consider it\nhas come out in the same place, which is that by hook or\nby crook, the bureau has exercised its discretion to\nanswer this question. And I -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You say there are 195,000\nsentences affected by this rule. I don't know which way\nthat cuts. If there are 195,000 people spending more\ntime in -- you know, significantly more time in jail\nthan they should, that's kind of troublesome.\nMR. WALL: Justice Stevens, I think what I\nwould say is the bureau has been doing it the same way\nsince 1987. Congress has amended this statute five\ntimes in the last 20 years. It has never moved to alter\nthe bureau's methods.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the cumulated -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Probably they didn't\nunderstand it because it's an awfully hard statute to\nunderstand.\nMR. WALL: Justice Stevens, with all\nrespect, Justice Breyer got it in the first 5 minutes.\nSo I think the -\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, he's a lot smarter\nthan I am.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even Justice Breyer has got\nit! Whoa!\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But what -- what we\nwere -- what we were saying, is this is 36,000 years of\nprisoner time, I mean -- 36,000, that is older than\nMarbury versus Madison.\nMR. WALL: Justice Kennedy, that's true. I\nthink the point is that the language of the statute has\nremained unchanged, and for the last 20 years the bureau\nhas interpreted that in a reasonable way. The language\nis unambiguous, but even if it weren't, at least the\nbureau's interpretation is reasonable, which is why 11\ncourts of appeals have deferred to it.\nAnd so I take your point that they are\nserving more time than under Petitioner's\ninterpretation, but I don't think that that policy\nrationale is properly before this Court. It is properly\nbefore the bureau, which has found that policy\nconsideration outweighed by other penological interests,\nand I think that's the judgment to which this Court\nshould defer, not its own judgment about how much time\nthese prisoners should -- should be serving.\nAnd I do think it's important in that regard\nthat Congress has returned the statute several times.\nAnd I take your point that it is complicated, Justice\nStevens, but -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can finish\nthe -\nMR. WALL: -- but Congress has made a number\nof technical amendments and I don't think there is any\nevidence it did not understand of how this longstanding\nsystem works.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Wall.\nMr. Sady, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. SADY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. SADY: Thank you.\nThe -- the idea that there could be time at\nthe end of the sentences is premised on \"term of\nimprisonment\" mean \"time served,\" which it cannot mean\nin the same sentence where it says \"beyond time served.\"\nIf you make the adjustment for good time\ncredit that is earned at the end of the year, it is\ncredit towards the service of the sentence; that means\nthat it's blocks of 365 days, that at the last day of\nMr. Barber's sentence if it's properly computed, he\nwould be looking at 365 days. If he behaved well until\nclose to the end, if we go to the last statute that says\nprorate the remaining period of time, the 30 -\nremaining 36 days he could earn, and credit it in the\nlast 6 weeks, because they are doing that simply as an\nadministrative technique.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just so -- in your\nsystem they do the measurement at the end of the\n365 days. He misbehaves on the 340th day. And they say\nfor that reason, I'm only going to give you 10 days of\nfull time -- of good time credit.\nMR. SADY: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So now your year starts\nat 350?\nMR. SADY: 355. Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, they said they are\nonly giving you 10 days of good time credit. Because at\nthe end of -- 355.\nMR. SADY: Right. And so the 355 -\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That was pretty bad.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 355. Now, your year\nstarts again on 355 days -\nMR. SADY: 365, and if he behaves very badly\nhe has to go all the way to the end of that 365 and\ndoesn't get any adjustment, but if he -- next year he\nstarts all over again for 365 days, and if he is very\ngood he gets the 54 days.\nIf I could address the question that was\nraised by Justice Ginsburg on the Rule of Lenity. I\nwould like to point out that in the -- we have relied on\nboth R.L.C. and in -- on Granderson for your\narticulation of the Rule of Lenity as it would apply in\nthis case. Which, if after we're looking at all the\nother -- the statute, the history, the context, and if\nwe cannot -- if we apply the Rule of Lenity, if the\ngovernment's position cannot be shown to be\nunambiguously correct, we have at least ambiguity here,\nand then we go to Chief Justice Marshall's seminal\ndiscussion of lenity.\nAnd what he said was that we look at lenity\nfor the proposition -- to back the principle that the\npower of punishment belongs to the legislative\ndepartment; and the tenderness of the law for the rights\nof individuals, both of -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the argument -- one\nof the arguments is it is not punishment at all. This\nis a reward; this is a reward for good behavior.\nMR. SADY: The Court in -- in Lynce and in\nWeaver used the term \"increase in punishment\" when there\nwas no longer available good time credit. For -- to say\nthat somebody has to serve 87.2 percent of the term of\nimprisonment imposed by the judge instead of 85 percent,\nthat is imprisonment.\nFor Mr. Barber that's over 6 months'\nadditional time behind bars in a prison. That's -\nthat's penal; that is affecting individual liberty, it's\nthe type of liberty that was intended to be covered by\nthe Rule of Lenity; and especially in the situation\nwhere the initial sentence was imposed based on a grid\nthat was calibrated assuming 85 percent, he's ending up\nserving 2.2 percent more time than the sentencing judge,\nin imposing the sentence. So that aspect of punishment.\nAnd in actual raw time behind bars in a prison.\nUnless there are further questions, I would\nreserve my -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Sady.\nMR. SADY: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
