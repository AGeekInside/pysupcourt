        "content": "(10:06 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\ntoday in Case 07-214, Allison Engine Company versus\nUnited States ex rel. Sanders and Thacker.\nMr. Olson.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe False Claims Act addresses and redresses\nfraud on the government, not on every recipient of\ngovernment funds. The liability-imposing provisions of\nthe False Claims Act refer ten times in a single\nsentence to a submission to the government, getting a\nclaim paid or approved by the government, or defrauding\nthe government. Liability is to the government and it's\nbased upon the amount of damages that the government\nsustains.\n20 years ago, construing an even broader\nstatute, this Court unanimously determined that\ndefrauding the government in any manner for any purpose\ndoes not include defrauding recipients of Federal funds.\nThat's the Tanner case. The United States made the same\narguments in the Tanner case in 1987 that it's making\ntoday in connection with the False Claims Act, and this\nCourt unanimously decided that case that defrauding the\ngovernment did not include defrauding grantees or\nrecipients of Federal funds.\nThere is no evidence in this case that false\nor fraudulent claims were submitted to the United\nStates. Indeed, we don't know from the record what was\nsubmitted to the United States, when it was submitted to\nthe United States, what it contained.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the\ncertificates of conformance with specifications of? I\nbelieve they were the Navy's specifications and Allison\nsubmitted to someone those certificates of conformance.\nMR. OLSON: The district court very\ncarefully analyzed that evidence, as well as all the\nother evidence in the case, Justice Ginsburg, and found\nthat an inference could not be drawn with respect to\nwhat had happened or when it happened because there is a\ntime lag to drawing an inference from certificates of\nperformance when you don't know when those certificates\nwere made, when they were submitted to the government,\nwhat they said.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Could the government have\nasked -- could the Navy have asked for them?\nMR. OLSON: The Navy, you mean in connection\nwith the litigation or in connection --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No. In connection -- the\nNavy -- the engines are being supplied for Navy\ndestroyers and the Navy obviously has an interest in\nmaking sure that the -- they measure up to the\nspecifications. So my question is whether in this\nprocedure for dealing with subcontractors there is any\nkind of audit where the Navy can say, we want to see the\ncertificates of conformance for those engines or other\ndocuments relating to them.\nMR. OLSON: The answer to your question as I\nunderstand it, Justice Ginsburg, is yes, the Navy had\nthe right to test the equipment, look at the -- look at\nthe specifications, examine the specifications, ask for\ncorrections if they were unsatisfied, to test the\nproducts. The Navy had the right to do all of those\nthings.\nAnd one -- fundamental to this case is we\ndon't know whether they did, whether they were satisfied\nwith the generators as ultimately delivered to them,\nwhether there were corrections, if there were\ndeficiencies or deviations from the specifications when\nthey were first submitted to the shipyards, whether\nthose were corrected, whether those deviations were\nimmaterial. Because --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Did the Navy have the\nright to audit the subcontractor's books?\nMR. OLSON: It's my understanding -- I'm not\n100 percent sure of that, Justice Kennedy, but it's my\nunderstanding that the government did have the right to\nfollow the process all the way through. There's no\nevidence that they did so.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose they audit the\nsubcontractor's books and they don't discover a fraud\nand leave. Would there be liability then under your\nview?\nMR. OLSON: Well, I think it would depend\nupon what was in the books and whether there was --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The books show that X\ndollars were spent for certain parts and that was far\ntoo much. That was an inflated figure. It fools the\ngovernment. The government then paid the\nsubcontractor -- pays the contractor; the contractor\npays the subcontractor.\nMR. OLSON: It -- that might be,\nJustice Kennedy. Regarding the terms of the statute,\nwhether you might interpret that as providing under\n(a)(2), providing a record or document to the government\nwith the intention that the government pay or approve a\nclaim, I think you'd have to examine the evidence in\nthat context.\nWhat we don't have here, we don't know what\nwas submitted to the government. What the lawyers\nrepresenting the claimants in this case -- and this is\nfrom page 5a of the appendix to the cert petition,\nfootnote 3. We -- this is what the -- when they were\nasked about this issue: We haven't shown you the ship\nyard's invoices to the United States and we're not going\nto show you those. Because they are totally irrelevant\nunder the False Claims Act.\nNow, that could not be more wrong, it seems\nto us. You can't determine -- if there's going to be a\nfraud, a claim of fraud against the United States, you\nhave to know what the United States received to see\nwhether it's fraudulent, to see whether any deviation\nfrom the facts were material, whether the deviation from\nthe specifications where maybe the product was better,\nmaybe it deviated in an insubstantial way or an\nimmaterial way, maybe the government had an opportunity\nto fix it.\nWe don't know whether there was reliance by\nthe government. We don't know whether there was a loss\nby the government. And we don't know, if there was a\nloss by the government, the quantification for the loss.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I must be just missing\nsomething here. Tell me what I'm missing. What about\nthe definition of \"claim\"? It says a claim includes a\nrequest under a contract for money or property, and the\nrequest is made to the contractor if the United States\nprovides any -- any of the money.\nIs there an issue here as to whether some of\nthe money provided -- are you saying there was no money\nprovided by the United States or maybe there was no\nmoney provided?\nMR. OLSON: No. The way the record -- the\nrecord is a little confusing with respect to that,\nJustice Breyer, but I think that one of the witnesses --\nI don't know how he knew --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. OLSON: But one of the witnesses said,\nyes, the money that we received was money that came from\nthe United States.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well -- so why doesn't that\nend it? Why doesn't -- how do you win, then, given the\nlanguage I just read?\nMR. OLSON: Well, that's the definition of\nthe word \"claim.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: \"Claim.\" And there has to\nbe a claim.\nMR. OLSON: There has to be a claim. But\nthen section -- you're reading subsection (c).\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's right, that's right.\nMR. OLSON: Subsection (a) provides the\nstandard for liability. So you can have a claim, but\nyou're not liable for a false claim unless it's\nsubmitted to the government, unless it's knowingly made\nto get a fraudulent claim paid or approved by the\ngovernment.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you say (a), but\nwe're talking about (a)(2) --\nMR. OLSON: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- in connection with (c).\nMR. OLSON: Yes. I -- I'm looking at the\nstatute --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you were quoting from\n(a)(1).\nMR. OLSON: No, I quoted from both (a)(1)\nand (a)(2). (A)(2) --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I know that, but doesn't\n(a)(2) stand by itself, especially as -- as (c) is\nwritten, (c) and (2), (c) and (a)(2) make perfect\ngrammatical sense without any presentation to the\ngovernment.\nMR. OLSON: Well, it reads out the words \"by\nthe government\" from that section, which is what the\nstatute looked like until it was specifically amended.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, the words \"by the\ngovernment\" are in (a)(2).\nMR. OLSON: Pardon me?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The words \"by the\ngovernment\" are in (a)(2).\nMR. OLSON: They are in (a)(2), but the way\nJustice -- the way Justice Kennedy was reading it, I\nrespectfully submit, would read out those \"by the\ngovernment.\" What (a)(2) --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying, in addition\nto being a claim, that's not enough reliability? It has\nto be a claim that's presented to the government?\nMR. OLSON: It's presented to the government\nand --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And all that (c) does is\ntell you what a claim is. So that, even if it's not a\nclaim against the government but just a claim against a\nsubcontractor, that still can be the basis for liability\nso long as it's presented to the government.\nMR. OLSON: It's presented to the government\nor, under (a)(2), knowingly made to get --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But (a)(2) says it has to\nbe paid or approved by the government.\nMR. OLSON: It has to be made or used to get\na claim paid or approved. In other words, it has to be\nsomething that's created, then given to the government,\nso in order to get a claim paid or approved by the\ngovernment. What I am --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you said given to the\ngovernment. It's \"paid or approved by the government.\"\nMR. OLSON: Well, I think a reasonable\nreading of the statute is -- and this is essentially\nwhat this Court unanimously decided 20 years ago in the\nTanner case, that these cases about defrauding the\ngovernment must involve something that causes the\ngovernment to suffer a loss, some something that impacts\nthe government. Even -- even the government today is\nmaking the same statement that there has to be a loss.\nWhat I'm saying with -- it's important,\nJustice Kennedy, that -- that if you are going to want\nto get something paid or approved by the government, you\nhave to do something that gets it to the government in\nsome fashion.\nAnd reading (a)(1) and (a)(2) and (a)(3) and\nthe Tanner decision and the history of this statute from\n1863 all suggest very strongly, I submit, the plain\nlanguage of the statute is that it's -- involves fraud\nagainst the government.\nNow, you may submit something to a prime --\nyou may be a subcontractor that submits something to the\nprime contractor, and this very -- this case is a very\ngood example of it, and this case is very much like the\nTanner case. What did the prime contractor do with it?\nIf it was false or deficient or out of specifications,\nthe prime contractor had a right to say: Wait a minute,\ntighten those bolts up a little bit more, or we're going\nto deduct it, a little price from that, and we're going\nto tell the government that there's a deviation from the\nspecifications.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if it's disguised,\nhow would the -- how would the prime contractor know?\nMR. OLSON: Well, that's just the point,\nJustice Ginsburg. We don't no one way or the other\nunless the evidence is submitted. We don't know what\nthe government received, so we don't know whether the\ngovernment was deceived. So, if I submit that it might\nwell be in this case -- we don't know how much time\nelapsed between the submission of the invoices or the\nother materials from the subcontractor to the prime\ncontractor. What happened then between then and when\nthe ships were delivered to the Navy? Lot of things\ncould have happened. We don't know.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there wasn't any\ntrial, was there?\nMR. OLSON: There was a trial.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was?\nMR. OLSON: And there was a motion at the\nclose of the evidence of the plaintiff's case. And at\nthat -- it's at that point that counsel said: We are\nnot going to show you the invoices to the United States.\nWe're not --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, how could -- they\nwould have at a minimum, even if your theory is not\ncorrect -- they would have to prove loss to the\ngovernment. Otherwise they would have no claim.\nMR. OLSON: That's -- that's correct,\nJustice Ginsburg. And that's my point.\nIf you can't -- if you don't know what went\nto the government, you don't know whether a claim or a\ndocument or a statement, to use the words of the\nstatute, went to the government, you don't know whether\nwhat the government got was false; you don't\nknow whether they --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does the other side concede\nthat point, that you have to prove loss to the\ngovernment? I don't think they do, do they?\nMR. OLSON: I'm not sure. I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think they do.\nMR. OLSON: What the statute says --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the government\ncertainly has that in its brief.\nMR. OLSON: What the statute says is that it\nis liability to the government for the damage the\ngovernment sustains. Now, it may well be -- there's\npenalties even if there isn't damage to the government.\nI would concede that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You could say that the\nmissed funds which are in the hands of subcontract -- of\ncontractors, harms the government, even though it\ndoesn't come out of the government's pocket, because\nthose funds were given for a particular purpose, and if\nthat purpose is frustrated, the government is harmed.\nThat would work, without saying that the government has\nlost any money.\nMR. OLSON: Well, you could say that, but\nyou don't know whether the government got what it\nwanted. You don't know whether the -- if something\ndeviates from specifications in a contract, it might\ndeviate on the plus side of something, it might deviate\nin an immaterial way.\nThe contractor, the prime shipyards here,\nand the government had the right to correct any\ndeficiencies.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, suppose the\ngovernment gives money for building schools, okay, to a\nState and a fraudulent claim is submitted as -- in\nconnection with the construction of the school.\nThe government has been cheated in that the\nmoney it gave for a school is not going to the school;\nsome of it is going into the hands of the fraudulent\ncontractor.\nMR. OLSON: Well, what you've done with your\nquestion, Justice Scalia, is left out the link. What\nhappened -- what -- the government may have made\n-- given money to the schools. Subcontractors might\nhave submitted something false. The prime contractor\nmight have discovered it and said: Correct this or --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that, but\nthat's a different point.\nMR. OLSON: No, it isn't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I am talking now about the\npoint of whether the government itself has to suffer any\nharm other than the fact that the money it gave was not\nused for the purpose for which it gave it. That alone,\nit seems to me, could be harm.\nMR. OLSON: Well, it -- it might under some\ncircumstances be harm. It might not under other\ncircumstances be harm. It might be misleading in an\nimmaterial way. It might -- there might have been no\nreliance by the government. There might have -- the\ngovernment might have said -- the contract between the\nprime contractor and the subcontractor might have\ndifferent requirements than what the government wants.\nNone of those --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Mr. Olson, it seems to me\nyou're fighting a hypothetical. Let's say they built a\nlousy school, sub-spec. The roof is falling in; the\nplumbing leaks. It's a fraud, but they've given the\nmoney, the feds have given the money to the States and\nthe States have let this slip by. Justice Scalia's\npoint was the Federal Government has been injured.\nMR. OLSON: The Federal Government may have\nbeen injured. The question is what does this statute\nredress? There are other statutes. There's a major\nfraud provision of Title 18 that has major penalties for\nfraud by subcontractors against contractors in\nconnection with public projects just as the one -- like\nthe ones you're describing.\nBut if this Court's Tanner decision is\ncorrect -- and it was only 20 years ago; it was\nunanimous -- it defined the term \"defrauding the\ngovernment\" and it said \"defrauding the government\"\nmeans defrauding the government, not filing a false\nclaim --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But that's why the\ndefinition -- it seems to me at the moment -- that's why\nI'd like your view -- that the language is perfectly\nambiguous, the language of \"knowingly makes a false\nstatement to get a false claim paid.\"\nNow, the \"false claim\" is the claim that\nthey made to the contractor, because that's the\ndefinition. And you are saying: Well, they made this\nstatement to get a false claim paid by the government.\nNow, you could read those words \"paid by the government\"\nto say \"and there has to be a causal connection,\" which\nis what you're saying, that you have to make the false\nstatement, make the claim, and that led the government\nto pay.\nBut you could also say it's paid by the\ngovernment when the money to pay it comes out of\ngovernment funds, because it was paid by the government\neven though the government gave the money to build the\nschool 100 years ago. But it's there in the bank\naccount, and then the contractor took the money from the\nbank account that the government put in and paid it. In\nsuch a case, linguistically, you can say it's paid by\nthe government.\nMR. OLSON: It has to be a false claim paid\nby the government.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It was a false claim.\nThat's there.\nMR. OLSON: What -- Justice Breyer, what is\nmissing from your hypothetical is what went to the\ngovernment. Suppose the prime contractor decided that\nthe paint was off-white instead of white, and that was\nsatisfactory.\nSuppose the subcontractor said to the\ngovernment: This is a major project; this is\na billion-dollar project; there are all these little\nthings that are out of specifications and could be\ncalled false or fraudulent or misleading; we're going to\ndisclose all of these things to the government. The\ngovernment has a complete opportunity to test them, look\nat them, and decide whether it's satisfied. Then the\ngovernment isn't deceived.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, it doesn't say that.\nIt says it was a false claim, which it was. It's false,\nand it is a claim to the general. And was it paid by\nthe government? Yes. It was paid by the government,\neven though everything you said is true, because the\nmoney to pay it came from government funds. So that's\nwhy I'm having a problem. I can read those words \"paid\nby the government\" either way.\nMR. OLSON: Well, I think you are taking the\nwords and isolating them.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's true.\nMR. OLSON: It is knowingly making a false\nrecord or a false statement to get a false claim paid.\nIf the government didn't pay a false claim, then (a)(2)\ndoesn't provide for liability.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that's not strictly\ncorrect. I mean, it \"paid or approved.\"\nMR. OLSON: Yes, I should have said --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- which means there is a\nthird way, and the third way of reading it is if the sub\nmakes the false statement to the general contractor in\norder ultimately to get a false claim, i.e., the\nultimate contractor's claim for conforming work,\napproved or this particular claim approved by the\ngovernment when the government makes the ultimate\ndecision to pay the general contractor, that would be\ncovered by (2).\nMR. OLSON: Well, if -- I should have said\nthe word \"approved\" because I -- I was shortening it up.\nBut it does say \"paid or approved.\" But what has to be\ndone is that the government has to -- what has to be\nsubmitted is something to cause the government to pay or\nto approve a false claim to the government.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that can simply be done\nby the false claim to the general contractor, who either\naccepts it as true or, for that matter, knowingly\nunderstands that it is false, and ultimately submits the\nsame claim, i.e., as an element of its ultimate bill for\nthe whole project.\nMR. OLSON: Well, what I might say in\naddition to what I have said, Justice Souter, is that\nthere is no stopping point for that theory. The\ngovernment says as long as the project involved Federal\nmoney, as long as the project used Federal funds, as\nlong as the project might endanger the Federal fisc, as\nlong as the program is financed in part by Federal\nmoney, there would be liability under this statute.\nGiven the tens of thousands of government\ncontracts, government funds, government financing of\nStates, localities, universities, and so forth, there is\nno limiting point. And what --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: With respect, I think there\nis a limiting point. You are certainly right when you\ntalk about the thousands of contracts that the\ngovernment ultimately makes or finances for the benefit\nof lower units of government. But it does not follow\nfrom the government's theory that if the United States\nmakes grants to a sub-unit of government, not for the\npurpose of a given contract or a given project, it\nsimply makes grants, revenue-sharing sorts of things, it\ndoesn't follow from the government's position that when\none of those sub-units of government then makes a\ncontract spending part of that money, that it's covered\nby this statute.\nThis statute would cover the myriad of\ngrants made for particular contracts. It would not\ncover every subset of funds in a lower government unit,\nsome of which had been contributed by the national\ngovernment.\nMR. OLSON: I don't -- I don't think, with\nrespect, that that's a fair reading of what the\ngovernment said either in the Tanner case, think making\nessentially the same arguments which were rejected\nunanimously by this Court, or what it says in its brief\nto the Court today.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, perhaps we should\nask the government to explain what its position is. But\none of the points that has been raised in opposition to\nyour argument is that your interpretation would cut out\nclaims that today are regarded as properly presented\nunder the False Claims Act.\nAnd the one that was featured was false\nclaims for Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement, because\nthose are presented not to the government but to an\nintermediary.\nMR. OLSON: In -- with respect to that, the\ngovernment filed a brief in a case called Atkins versus\nMcInteer in the Eleventh circuit, and I have the brief\nhere -- it is not part of the material that is before\nyou -- in which the government said that even if the\nDistrict -- D.C. Circuit decision that's involved in\nthis case, the Totten case, was correctly decided, those\nMedicare-Medicaid cases would be substantially covered\nunder the statute even under that construction because\nthe provider's claim is passed on by the insurer to the\nMedicare agency or entity.\nNow, I don't know, Justice Ginsburg, the\nfacts of that case or the facts of all of those\ncircumstances. But the fact is that if you take this\nstatute as it was enacted in 1863, all of this used to\nbe a part of one section that talked in the first case,\nthe first instance, one sentence which discussed in the\nfirst instance a presentation of a claim to the\ngovernment and which was the liability to be imposed\nupon the claimant.\nThe second part of the sentence said -- it\nwas intended to cover the people aiding the fraud, those\npeople that provided with records or statements in order\nto get the payment made.\nAnd then the third provision was the\nconspiracy provision.\nThose were broken out into the subsections\nyou see today. In 1982, Congress specifically said: We\nare simply codifying the statute; we're not changing the\nstatute. We are making no substantive changes in the\nstatute.\nIf you read that provision in the context of\nthe Marcus versus Hess case, which was in the early\n'40s, in which the government -- in which the Court\nspecifically said there's liability for an intermediary\ncausing a -- Federal Government to pay the claim. But\nin that case, the invoices were passed on, and the --\nand the government entity in that case, the Public Works\nAdministration, had the opportunity to review and\napprove --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So the whole\ndifference -- the whole difference, then, is if the --\nthe invoices are passed on, as opposed to the government\nhaving the right, if it so chooses, to inspect the books\nand records?\nMR. OLSON: I think I may not have heard\nyour question. In the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The difference is if the\ngovernment gets the invoices from the contractor, then\nthere's a claim under the False Claims Act. But if,\ninstead, the subcontractor is required to make its books\nand records available on request to the government,\nthat's not enough?\nMR. OLSON: Well, I -- I think -- it's\ncertainly not this case, because the -- although the\ngovernment had an opportunity to do these things, we\ndon't know what happened.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it made -- I thought\nyou said that it is this case that the government had\nthe right --\nMR. OLSON: If --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- to audit the --\nMR. OLSON: The problem is, as this Court\nsaid in the -- unanimously in the Tanner case, given --\nforgive me for doing this, but it's important -- given\nthe immense variety of ways the Federal Government\nprovides Federal financial assistance, always\naccompanied by some restrictions or conditions on its\nuse, the inability of the substantial supervision\nlanguage which the government was advancing then, which\nit's sort of advancing now, does not provide any test\nfor any real guidance or --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the Tanner case didn't\nconfront the statute which has the definition of claims\nthat Justice Breyer is putting to you.\nMR. OLSON: Yes --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: This statute that we're\nlooking at, in effect, defines what a fraud against the\ngovernment is.\nMR. OLSON: Yes, but it -- but when it\nwas -- when it added that section, it specifically added\nin the words \"by the government,\" which those words were\nadded after the legislative history that both the\nRespondents and the government cite. And it did not\nchange, Justice Kennedy, the definition of \"liability.\"\nIt simply defined \"claim.\" If the Court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Am I correct in this that\nwithout the claim definition, the statute would not\ncover a fraudulent submission by the subcontractor to\nthe contractor which is known to be passed on to the\ngovernment ultimately?\nMR. OLSON: No, I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Without that definition,\nthe claim would be made against the contractor, not\nagainst the government.\nMR. OLSON: I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And, therefore, wouldn't be\na claim.\nMR. OLSON: I think under both the -- if the\nclaim by the subcontractor to the contractor is intended\nto be passed on, that the -- that the contractor is an\nintermediary, then under Marcus versus Hess, which is\nthe situation there, there could be liability.\nI'd like if I could, Mr. Chief Justice, to\nreserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Olson.\nMr. Stewart.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART,\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI'd like to begin with the same point that\nMr. Olson began with, namely, does the False Claims\nAct -- is the False Claims Act directed solely at\nschemes to defraud the government or does it encompass\nschemes to defraud people who receive Federal money?\nAnd we're in agreement with Petitioners that the False\nClaims Act is directed at schemes to defraud the Federal\nGovernment.\nOur theory in this case is not that the\nsubcontractors are potentially liable because they may\nhave attempted to defraud the prime contractors. Our\ntheory is that the subcontractors are potentially liable\nbecause they are alleged to have used false\nrepresentations made to the prime contractors but with\nthe ultimate purpose of defrauding the United States.\nAnd I think if you imagine what would have\nhappened if the allegations in this case are true and if\nthe fraudulent scheme had been carried to completion,\nit's very clear that the government, rather than the\nprime contractors, would have been the injured party.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Stewart, I don't\nunderstand that point. Let's say Allison Engine is\ndefrauding Bath, but Bath makes ships for a lot of\npeople, boats, whatever they make. Allison Engine is\ndefrauding, saying these engines, you know, work this\nway and, in fact, they don't.\nIt doesn't know Bath is going to use some of\nthem in a government ship as opposed to a private ship.\nSo you're saying in that context, since there's no\nintent to defraud the government, there's no liability?\nMR. STEWART: Well, we would say certainly\nin the context where Allison knows that the engines are\nto be used for private work, that the False Claims\nAct would not --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It just sells them\nengines. It doesn't know what Bath is going to do with\nthem. They are going to put some in private boats and\nsome in the government boats.\nMR. STEWART: I think you could still have a\nFCA claim, if in fact the work was being done for the\ngovernment contract. But whatever the correct answer to\nthat question in the circumstance where the\nsubcontractor really doesn't know what the ultimate\nproject is for, that's not the case here. The\nsubcontractor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I have another question.\nSuppose the subcontractor -- the fraud consists of\ninflating the hours spent in a cost-plus contract. So\nthe subcontractor submits and receives payment for\n$10,000 more than the subcontractor deserved. All\nright?\nBut that all comes out of the hide of the\ncontractor. The contractor gets the same amount of\nmoney from the Federal Government and the fraud only\nharms the contractor.\nMR. STEWART: Our view is that that would\nnot be covered.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That would not be --\nMR. STEWART: That would not be covered. It\nwould --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why?\nMR. STEWART: Because the statute -- if you\nlook at page 2 of the blue brief, that reproduces the\nrelevant provisions of the statute. And the one that\nwe're principally -- the two that we're relying on here\nare subsection 2, which says: \"Knowingly makes, uses or\ncauses to be made or used a false record or statement to\nget a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the\ngovernment.\"\nAnd we would say that the reference to false\nor fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government\nshould be taken as limited to a claim that is false as\nto the government. That is, it's false in a respect\nthat the government cares about.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- injured by it because\nit, in effect, gets less than it paid for?\nMR. STEWART: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If it were a cost-plus\ncontract, the government would pay an extra 10,000 and\nit would lose.\nMR. STEWART: That's right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If they -- if they simply\nsupplied defective parts, the government would get less\nof a machine than it paid for. But in the -- in\nJustice Scalia's example, the government ultimately ends\nup with exactly what it bargained for, and the person\nwho's out is the person who paid for too much labor,\nwhich is general -- is that your --\nMR. STEWART: That's correct. And in that\ncircumstance, I think the scheme could fairly be\ncharacterized as one to defraud the prime contractor,\nbecause the prime contractor would bear the loss\nassociated with the scheme. And we would agree that\nthat's not covered. Here --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What you are saying is\ncovered, I take it -- and this is -- I want to know how\nthis has worked out -- what is covered is -- imagine\ngovernment grant programs. And suppose there are vast\nnumbers of grant programs now that go to all kinds of\nentities throughout the country, and a large portion of\nwhich are just grants. They're paid and the government\nis not going to get a penny back.\nNow, there are instances of frauds in such\nsituations of subs against the person who gets the\ngrant. And in -- I can't imagine a case -- maybe\nimagine, but it would be imaginary -- where the\nGovernment couldn't say: But we got less than the grant\nwas supposed to pay for.\nAnd you're saying all those are covered. Is\nthat right?\nMR. STEWART: I mean, I think our test would\nbe, is the effect of the fraud to cause the money\nprovided by the Federal Government to be diverted to\npurposes --\nJUSTICE BREYER: To get less than it was\nsupposed to get.\nMR. STEWART: I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so this is what\nsurprises me on your side. It's 20 years later. And if\nall those things are covered, given the vast extent of\ngovernment grant programs in the United States, has your\ninterpretation worked to bring within this statute, and\nlots of qui tam cases against municipal frauds of all\nkinds, things that they just never thought of at the\ntime of the Civil War? Do you see what the question is?\nMR. STEWART: I mean, I think -- I think it\nhas basically worked. I don't think it has worked\nperfectly. But I don't think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Have there been a lot of\nsuch cases?\nMR. STEWART: I think there are a lot of\ncases -- I mean, Medicare and Medicaid fraud is an\nexample that we would deal with differently textually,\nbut those are programs in which the Federal Government\nprovides money. Persons other than Federal officials\ndecide whether the claims should be paid, but ultimately\nthere's reimbursement by the Federal Government. Now,\nour answer to the question --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Olson said on the\nMedicare that the providers, that the intermediary does\npresent the --\nMR. STEWART: And our view is that those\nwould be covered even if there is a presentment\nrequirement, because subsection (a)(1) of the statute\nrefers to a person who knowingly causes a false claim to\nbe presented to a Federal official.\nSo because there's the reimbursement\nmechanism we think that would be covered. But a big\npart of our argument here is that the applicability of\nthe FCA should not depend on these sorts of quirks of\ntiming. That is, to take the school hypothetical that\nwas discussed in the first part of the argument, you\nhave provision of government money for -- Federal money\nfor construction of a school, and the contractors who\ndeal with the State agency defraud the State agency and\nthey produce a shoddy product.\nNow, if the way that the funding program\nworks is that the State agency pays first and then\npresents a claim for reimbursement to the Federal\nGovernment, that would be covered even with the\npresentment requirement.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how far down\nthe line? I mean, let's take that hypothetical. The\ngovernment gives money to the State to build a school.\nThe school has to be painted as part of that, so the\nschool contractor, the prime contractor, takes some of\nthe money from the Federal Government and pays the\npainter. The painter needs to buy paint. So the\npainter takes some of the Federal money and pays the\npaint company. The paint company has to get the\nchemicals from somebody. So the paint company takes\nsome of the money and pays the chemical company. And at\nthat point, the chemical companies fraudulently added,\nyou know, a dollar on to the cost of the chemicals. So\nthat dollar goes all the way through. So the Government\nends up paying a dollar more because of the fraud five,\nsix, seven times down the line.\nCan an uninterested person bring a qui tam\naction against the chemical manufacturer because of that\nfraud?\nMR. STEWART: I think our answer would\nprobably be yes. A court might read a de minimis\nlimitation into the statute, but part of our point would\nbe that be that that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A hundred dollars more a\ncan.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. STEWART: Well, the answer to that\nhypothetical -- and the answer to that hypothetical\nreally has nothing to do with whether the statute\nimposes a presentment requirement, because the\nhypothetical --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not a\npresentment requirement. That's in (a)(1. It's that\nthe claim be paid, the fault claim, be paid by the\ngovernment. And what you're saying is when the\ngovernment pays the State, that pays the school, that\npays the contractor, that pays the paint -- blah, blah,\nblah -- that that is payment by the government of a\nfalse claim because the chemical manufacturer six or\nseven steps down the line commits fraud.\nMR. STEWART: It could be an (a)(2)\nquestion, but my point was that the same type of issue\ncould arise even with the presentment requirement,\nbecause if the chemical manufacturer presents his own\nbill to the paint company, who presents his bill to the\ncontractor who does the painting work, who presents his\nbill, et cetera, et cetera --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He has to know that. He\nhas to know that his bill is going to be sent up the\nline to the government. \"Knowingly makes, uses or\ncauses to be made or used a false record to get a false\nor fraudulent --\nMR. STEWART: I guess I would say --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And if he knows it, serve\nhim right. But this other guy thinks he's just honestly\ncheating the guy who's buying the chemicals.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. STEWART: Again, whatever -- whatever\nthe answer -- the point I was trying to make about the\ntiming is -- again assume away these issues about how\nmuch might be de minimis. You have substantial fraud by\nthe contractor directed at the State agency. If the\nState -- if the way the funding program works is that\nthe State agency then presents its own bill to the\nFederal Government, we're going to have a good (a)(1)\ncase regardless of whether presentment is required,\nbecause we're going to say the subcontractor, the person\nwho did the work, caused the State agency to submit a\nfalse claim to the Federal Government and we can recover\non that theory.\nMR. STEWART: But -- but if the government\nprovides the money up front, gives it to the State\nagency and says, use it for the defined purposes, you'll\nstill have presentment of a claim by the State agency,\nnamely the request for funding, but there will be no way\nto say that that difference --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The difference is that\ngovernment money today is in everything. So if it's in\neverything, then everything is going to become subject\nto this False Claims Act. And of course I exaggerate by\nusing the word \"everything,\" but only a little.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. STEWART: But the point about timing --\nbut the point about timing is if the State's claim is\nsubmitted to the Federal Government at a time when the\nfraud has not yet occurred, the State's claim can't be\ndenominated false, assuming that the State intends it --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't know that that\naccords with the definition of \"claim\" in (c).\nMR. STEWART: Well, the definition of\n\"claim\" in (c) says it's a request or a demand --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It says the government\nwill reimburse.\nMR. STEWART: Will reimburse, but it also\nsays \"if the United States Government provides any\nportion of the money or property which is requested or\ndemanded, or if the government will reimburse.\" And so\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I meant provide. It\nhas provided it already.\nMR. STEWART: That's correct. And my -- my\npoint is the definition of \"claim\" indicates that\nCongress didn't want liability to turn on this quirk of\ntiming, whether the fraud occurs before the claim is\nsubmitted to --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So in your own school\nhypothetical, there's liability.\nMR. STEWART: There's liability if the\nFederal Government reimburses a claim for expenses that\nhave already been incurred, but under Petitioner's\ntheory, if the Federal Government pays the money up\nfront, the State has submitted a claim but it's not a\nfalse claim. And then if the contractor defrauds the\nschool -- the State, by producing a shoddy school, the\ncontractor can't be charged with having caused a false\nclaim to be submitted.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't shock me. I\ndon't know. It doesn't shock me at all. If indeed the\nobject of this is to prevent fraud upon the government\nand if the government has not been deceived at all, get\nyourself a new statute.\nMR. STEWART: But our point is that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This statute doesn't have\nto cover every ill in the world.\nMR. STEWART: That's correct. But fraud --\nfraud against the government can occur whether -- the\nwhole point of the definition of (c) is that fraud\nagainst the government can occur if Federal money is\ndiverted away from its intended purposes, whether the\ndeceit is practiced directly upon a Federal official or\na contractor or a grantee.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Before -- before you\nfinish, the major objection is the one that Justice\nBreyer just voiced, that your position is vastly\noverbroad and every time there's government money there\nwill be -- one of these qui tam people can come in.\nWhat are the limiting principles that you say attach to\nthis statute?\nMR. STEWART: There are two principal\nlimiting principles. The first is that the bill has to\nbe submitted to the contractor or grantee in his\ncapacity as such. That is, there has to be a nexus\nbetween the provision of Federal funds and the request\nthat's made. So if a subcontractor defrauds Boeing on\nwork that Boeing is doing for a private airline, there's\nno FCA violation. Even though Boeing literally is a\ngovernment contractor, it's not being defrauded in its\ncapacity as such.\nAnd the second is that the fraud has to be\nof a nature that if successfully carried to completion\ncould be expected to injure the Federal Government. So\nin the hypothetical of the cost-plus contract between\nthe prime contractor and the sub and the sub presents an\ninflated bill, if the loss false on the prime contractor\nand is not passed along to the government, the claim\nwould not lie under the FCA\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But if injuring the Federal\nGovernment would -- it would suffice to injure the\nFederal Government that the schools are shoddy and the\nroofs are leaking? That would be enough?\nMR. STEWART: That would be enough.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even though the Federal\nGovernment is not out of pocket any more, but the\nprogram that it -- that it was desirous of encouraging\nis simply not as good as it would have been otherwise.\nMR. STEWART: That's -- that's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And you would still -- your\ntheory would still cover the case of the -- of the\nagency that gets 10 percent of its budget by -- through\na general grant from the United States, no matter what\nit spent its money on, regardless of the fact that the\nUnited States has no connection with particular\ncontracts. If in fact a fraudulent claim was presented\nto that agency, it would fall within the qui tam\nstatute?\nMR. STEWART: We would still be asking was\nthe -- whether the fraud was of a sort that the Federal\nGovernment cared about. That is, if the Federal\nGovernment made a grant with no strings attached, use it\nas you want.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right, no strings attached.\nMR. STEWART: Then there would be no FCA\nliability.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why wouldn't there be?\nMR. STEWART: Because the fraud would not --\nin that -- in that hypothetical, you would have\nsomething akin to a fraudulent car repair bill passed\nalong, given to me. I happen to be a Department of\nJustice employee and I might use my Federal salary to\npay the fraudulent claim. But we wouldn't say that's an\nFCA violation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but when your salary is\npaid, in effect the government's interest stops when it\npays for your labor. In the -- in the hypothetical in\nwhich the government funds 10 percent of a sub-agency's\noperating budget, presumably its intent generalized goes\nto everything that agency does.\nMR. STEWART: Well, we would still ask\nwhether the government has -- the Federal Government has\nplaced meaningful limitations on the way in which the\nmoney may be spent and whether the nature of the fraud\nis to prevent those limitations from being honored.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Stewart.\nMr. Helmer.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES B. HELMER, JR.,\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. HELMER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease this Court:\nElectricity is the critical component in a\nmodern warship that allows it to fight, to defend\nitself, and to carry out its mission. Because of that,\nthe Navy imposed rigid requirements on all who work on\nits generator sets in manufacturing those generator\nsets.\nThose rigid requirements were passed down\nfrom the Navy to Bath. Bath was ordered by the Navy to\npass those down in writing to each of its subcontractors\nwho were going to work on these Gen-Sets, and Bath did\nthat. Each of the subcontractors in this case knew they\nwere working on the DDG-51 project, which is the Arleigh\nBurke-class destroyers. They knew that military\nrequirements were called out in their paperwork that had\nto be met; and they did not satisfy those military\nrequirements and yet submitted both claims for payment\nand, as Justice Ginsburg has pointed out, certificates\nof compliance.\nIf you look at the Sixth Circuit's joint\nappendix at page 620, you're going to see, at paragraph\n6.1 in the contract between Bath Iron Works and Allison,\nthe subcontractor, that Allison was required, when it\ndelivered the Gen-Sets to the shipyard to give a\ncertificate of conformance that all of these rigid\nrequirements had been satisfied, and that certificate of\nconformance had to be given to the United States Navy.\nAnd third, until that certificate of\nconformance was given to the United States Navy, no\nmoney; no money was going to be paid to Allison.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Whose certificate is it?\nIs it the contractor's certificate that everything that\nthe subs have done or the certificate of conformance\nthat Allison provided, that SOFCO provided?\nMR. HELMER: Yes, ma'am. There are two\ncertificates of conformance, you're absolutely correct.\nWhat I'm speaking of is the certificate of conformance\nfrom the defendant in this case. They have to take and\ngive that to the shipyard that says: We have met all\nthe requirements, the Navy requirements; and we have to\ngive that to the U.S. Navy. The U.S. Navy then takes\nthat certificate and releases the Gen-Set. It's under\nlock and key. It releases the Gen-Set --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought --\nMR. HELMER: -- to be installed in the ship.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought it was not\nestablished that anything from this defendant got to the\nNavy.\nMR. HELMER: You were told that earlier this\nmorning, Your Honor. I don't believe that's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, where in the record\nis there some indication that some -- some paper from --\nwith a fraudulent representation made it up to the Navy?\nMR. HELMER: If you'll look at the joint\nappendix, the Sixth Circuit joint appendix, at page 620;\nit's clause 6.1 -- talks about the certificates. The\ncertificates are in the record starting at joint\nappendix, Sixth Circuit joint appendix 515 --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I know what\ncertificates are, I mean, you know, their general\ncontent. But was there anything in the record that a\ncertificate from Allison went to the Navy with Allison's\nsignature on it?\nMR. HELMER: Yes, Your Honor. The contract\nwith Bath required the Navy to receive that for Allison\nto be paid. There was evidence in this case that\nAllison was, in fact, paid for delivering these\nGen-Sets. That's circumstantial evidence that they did\nsubmit their certificates of conformance --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What about the statement\nthat Mr. Olson quoted during his argument, when counsel\nfor plaintiffs said to the jury: You haven't seen\nanything that was submitted to the Navy and you're not\ngoing to see anything that was submitted to the Navy?\nMR. HELMER: No, Your Honor. That -- I made\nthat statement, and that was not my statement.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what was your\nstatement?\nMR. HELMER: My statement was: You are not\ngoing to see the invoices from Allison -- the invoices,\nnot the certificates of conformance, not the invoices\nfrom Bath to the Navy. You're not going to see those.\nBut the invoices from Allison to Bath were all admitted\ninto the record in this case. They're all summarized.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then there's less to\nthis case than we had thought. My goodness, even under\nthe Petitioner's theory, you win. If indeed a\nfraudulent document was given to Bath and Bath passed\nthat on, I think the Petitioners would have conceded --\nMR. HELMER: Your Honor, this case --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that there's a cause of\naction. What is all this fuss about, then?\nMR. HELMER: This case is not a outlier on\nthe ends of this statute. It is squarely in the middle\nof (a)(2).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I wish you had said that in\nyour brief because we could have saved ourselves a lot\nof reading.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HELMER: Your Honor, anything that I can\ndo to help the Court. I apologize if I didn't write the\nbrief better than I could have.\nBut I do have another point that I -- that I\nwould like to make in addition to what's in the record\nin this case. If you go back and look at the 1863\nversion of the False Claims Act, which continues on in\n1943, the statute talks about in the second clause --\nand the second clause is what is now known as (a)(2) --\nit talks about a false record or statement being made\nfor the purpose of obtaining or aiding to obtain\npayment. It does not say, and it never said, that there\nhas to actually be payment, there has to actually be\npayment.\nNow the statute reads today \"to get a false\nor fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government.\"\nMy point is -- and the Rainwater case, Justice Scalia,\nthat I think you may have been referring to says that --\nthe government does not have to have a monetary loss for\nthere to be a False Claims Act violation. However, for\nthere to be a violation of (a)(2), the false record or\nstatement that's presented, the false record or\nstatement that's made, has to be made with the purpose\nof reaching Federal funds. That's what the statute\noriginally said. That language was taken out in 1982.\nWe all seem to agree that the '82 recodification did not\nchange any of the meaning or purpose of the statute --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your argument --\nyour understanding of the scope of the statute is\nexactly the same if the words \"by the government\" were\nreplaced by \"with Federal funds\"? You think those\nare -- you think the statute is exactly the same if it\nsaid \"with Federal funds\" instead of \"by the\ngovernment\"?\nMR. HELMER: Yes, Your Honor. I think\nthat's correct. I think that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So when the\ngovernment -- when the phrase \"by the government\" was\nadded -- was it in '86?\nMR. HELMER: Yes, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There were a lot of\nstatutes that said \"with Federal funds,\" right?\nMR. HELMER: There were.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So why did the\nCongress add the phrase \"by the government\" instead of\n\"with Federal funds\" if it meant the same thing?\nMR. HELMER: The legislative history is dark\non that subject. But I have two answers for you,\nMr. Chief Justice. First, if you look at the '82\nversion of the statute, there were six liability\nprovisions set out. A seventh was added in '86, (a)(7).\nBut of the first six that were added in '82, when they\nbroke this long sentence down into parts, every one of\nthose provisions except for (a)(2} dealt with either \"by\nthe government\" or \"defrauding the government.\" (A)(7)\nlikewise has such similar language.\nMy first point to you is that I believe that\nwhen Congress amended this statute in '86 it wanted all\nprovisions to be consistent with each other in that\nsense that we're talking about fraud on the government,\nnot fraud against private parties, fraud on the\ngovernment.\nThe second response I would make to you,\nMr. Chief Justice, is that we don't read \"by the\ngovernment\" as meaning presented to the government or\neven paid by the government. We read \"by the\ngovernment\" as indicating that this is a limitation on\n(a)(2), because without that language on (a)(2), if you\nread the definition of \"claim,\" then any claim or\nprivate funds could be -- could have been covered by\n(a)(2). By adding the words \"by the government,\" the\nCongress has limited this to directing to Federal funds.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. So I guess I\nget back -- you read \"by the government\" as if it said\n\"with Federal funds\"?\nMR. HELMER: I do, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose -- you just said to\nJustice Scalia -- if you have one minute; I rather\nmissed that -- that your point was if you lose on that\npoint you just made and it isn't \"with Federal funds\"\nand it is that the government has to pay the claim, you\nstill win. That was your point to Justice Scalia, I\nguess.\nMR. HELMER: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what was that\nargument? Because you said it wasn't in the brief, and\nwhat is it? How do you still win?\nMR. HELMER: Well, I believe they -- that\nwas the first point that I was making to Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. HELMER: And my point there is that\n(a)(2) covers making a false record or statement to get\na false claim paid or approved by the government.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. HELMER: In this case, they were\nrequired -- Allison was required by its contract with\nBath and the Navy to submit a certificate of conformance\nto Bath and the Navy to release the Gen-Set for\ninstallation into the destroyer. Without that\ncertificate of conformance -- and we spent 5 weeks in\nfront of a jury talking about why they were false, why\neach of those were false -- without that certificate of\nconformance, the Gen-Set could not have been released to\nbe installed in the ship and Allison could not have been\npaid. That's what section 6.1 of the contract provides.\nJUSTICE ALITO: The the certificate of\nperformance made its way to the Navy. That was required\nby contract. Why did you not introduce direct evidence\nof that in your case?\nMR. HELMER: We did put all the certificates\nof conformance that were given to Bath in the record of\nthis case.\nAnd all of those by the terms of Allison's\ncontract with Bath had to be shown to the U.S. Navy\nemployee on site at the shipyard. And that contract was\nalso admitted into evidence.\nBut we did not --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was only the\ncontract. You didn't show that in fact that had\nhappened, that the certificates of conformance actually\nwere shown to a naval officer?\nMR. HELMER: No, ma'am, we did not have a\nwitness who testified that this certificate was given to\nEnsign So-and-So. But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And whose -- whose contract\nrequired this? It's a strange provision to be in the\ncontract between Allison and Bath.\nMR. HELMER: It -- you are correct, Your\nHonor. It was the contract between Bath and Allison\nthat I'm speaking about now that flowed -- that also\nflowed down the U.S. Navy's requirements that these\nGen-Sets be -- be built rigidly to the specifications\nset out by the Navy.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that contract between\nAllison and Bath said that this certificate from Allison\nhad to be presented to the Navy?\nMR. HELMER: Yes, Your Honor. It had -- it\nhad to be shown to the Navy. If you want to get paid,\nyou have to show it to the Navy, and then the Navy will\nrelease the Gen-Set. See they build these ships around\nthe Gen-Sets. They are so huge that you don't install\nthem on a destroyer; you build the destroyer up around\nit. So before you can release those to the shipyard for\nconstruction, you had to have the certificates of\nconformance.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In the contract between the\nNavy and Bath, was there a provision that Allison's\ninvoices would be shown to the Navy? In other words,\nwas the parallel provision in the contract with the --\nwith the general the same as the provision between the\ngeneral and the sub?\nMR. HELMER: Justice Souter, it was\ndifferent. There is a provision I believe\nJustice Ginsburg was referring to. You will find it at\npage 415 of the Sixth Circuit's joint appendix. That\nprovision required that when Allison made a certificate\nto get paid to the Navy -- I'm sorry, strike that --\nwhen Bath made a certificate to the Navy to get paid, it\nhad to have available for the U.S. Navy all of the\nunderlying documentation. All of the bills, the\ninvoices, and certifications had to be available to show\nthe Navy.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Available but not\nnecessarily transmitted.\nMR. HELMER: Not necessarily stapled to the\ninvoice and given to the Navy, but they had to be\navailable.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the contract between\nBath and Allison says: You give those to us, and we\ngive them to the Navy. It was specific in saying they\ngo -- your invoices, your -- your certificates, go to\nthe Navy?\nMR. HELMER: It was specific in saying your\ncertificate of conformance goes to the Navy.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. HELMER: It did not say in the provision\nthat I have cited to the Court, your invoice.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I understand that.\nMR. HELMER: And that was why I said,\nJustice Alito, to the trial court, not to the jury, that\nthe invoices are irrelevant. And I -- I didn't make\nthat up. That comes out of the Bornstein opinion.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And Bath would have been in\nbreach of its contract with Allison unless it passed\nthese things on to the Navy? That's why I say it's a\nstrange provision to be in the contract between Bath and\nAllison.\nMR. HELMER: The certificate was required.\nYour Honor, yes, that was required. The invoices had to\nbe available --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Allison could sue Bath for\nnot passing the certificate on to the Navy?\nMR. HELMER: Well, I believe the way it\nreads, Allison is supposed to hand the certificate to\nthe Navy employee at the shipyard.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if in fact, as\nyou suggest, Allison submitted the certificate to the\nNavy person at the shipyard, then the question presented\nin this case is not in fact presented here? Because the\nquestion presented assumes that there had not been a\nsubmission to the Federal Government of the false --\nfalse claim.\nMR. HELMER: I think that's fair to say,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did you make this point in\nresponse to the petition for cert?\nMR. HELMER: We opposed the petition for\ncert on other grounds. I did not cite the Court to the\njoint appendix, the Sixth Circuit joint appendix at page\n620.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you know, usually we\ntake a case to decide the question presented; and if\nthis question is really not before us you should have\ntold us that.\nMR. HELMER: Well, my understanding, Justice\nScalia, is under your Rule 26.2 I am permitted to bring\nto the Court's attention additional information that was\nin the joint appendix below. And that was what I was\nattempting to do in response to Justice Ginsburg's\ninitial question that started the presentation today.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There has been a\nstatement, in opposition to your position, that the way\nyou read (a)(2) would render (a)(1) useless, That\neverything would fall within (a)(2).\nIs there a distinction between what comes\nunder (a)(1) and (a)(2), in your view?\nMR. HELMER: Yes, ma'am. That is pointed\nout in the solicitor's brief at pages 18 and 19, the\nsilver brief, the distinction between (a)(1) and (a)(2).\n(A)(1) can be a claim that just says, pay me; there's\nnothing false on its face, but it is impliedly false\nbecause it -- it's not entitled to be paid because the\nrequirements haven't been met.\n(A)(2) would require a specific false\nstatement in that record or statement that's used.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Helmer.\nMR. HELMER: Thank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, Mr. Olson, four\nminutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nLet me address the -- what seems to be a\ncontroversy as to what was submitted to the Navy.\nIn the first place, the invoices were not\nsubmitted to the Navy. We know that. That's the\nprovision that I quoted before.\nThe Plaintiffs in this case did not call a\nsingle Navy witness. They did not call the prime\ncontractor as a witness. So we don't know what the Navy\nreceived, or what the Navy did not receive.\nWith respect to the so-called certification,\nthat is addressed on pages 57a through 59a of the cert\npetition appendix. This is a district court decision,\nthree pages of discussion.\nThis was an argument that the relators came\nup with relatively late when they couldn't explain why\nthey didn't have the invoices or what actually went to\nthe Navy, and they argued that Bath submitted a false\nimplied certification.\nThen the district court goes through the\nevidence on pages 57a to 59a and concludes at the top of\n59a there is no evidence of a requiring -- of a\nrequired, continuing certification with respect to\nquality, which is the issue tried in this case.\nI don't have time to go through all of that\nor all of the evidence, but that is backing and filling.\nThere -- and the question presented is a\ncorrect question presented. As the relators put it to\nthe -- to the district court, we don't have to do that.\nWe are not going to show you --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you this\nquestion: Suppose they had submitted the qualification\ncertificate, but not a claim? Would they have had a\ncase, under your view?\nMR. OLSON: If it was -- if the\nqualification -- if a -- if a --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What I am really asking\nis: Do they still need a claim?\nMR. OLSON: I -- they -- there has to be --\nno. Under (a)(2), Justice Stevens, you could submit a\nstatement intending to get a false claim approved or\npaid by the government.\nNow, the government can't approve anything\nif it's not actually submitted to it, or not intended to\nbe submitted to it. That's in the same section of -- of\nthe statute.\nLet me -- let me turn to the -- this is a\npenal statute. There is a punitive statute, as you\npointed out, in the Vermont versus Stevens case.\nThere is no meaningful limitation on what\nthe government and the Respondents want in this case.\nThe government has now come up with this limitation:\nWell, it must be really a government project.\nWell, that isn't in the statute. That's\nbasically the same thing you unanimously rejected in the\nTanner case.\nThe government said in its brief if the\ngovernment is the ultimate source of the funds. That\ngoes back to the example that the Chief Justice was\nmaking. There might be 15 different layers, the way\nthis government works. Money is fungible. It's\nimpossible to trace.\nThis statute is intended to address claims\nmade, or statements made in connection with claims made,\nto -- to commit to defraud the government, and defraud\nthe government irrespective of the definition of\n\"claim,\" which could have been put in section (a), but\nwas not put in section (a), the liability section.\nThe Congress knows how to put those words in\nstatutes. They were in the major fraud statute, the --\nthe case that this Court distinguished in Dixon, in --\nin Tanner. The Dixon case was money given -- paid to or\non behalf of the government. There is language like\nthat throughout the congressional statutes.\nWe don't know in this case whether the\ngovernment was defrauded, or was intended to be\ndefrauded, because there is this big space between what\nwent on between the subcontractors and the shipbuilders\nand what went on between the shipbuilders and the\ngovernment.\nThere could have been all kinds of dialogue.\nThere could have been disclosures. There might be\ndeviations from the specifications in any kind of\ngovernment contract. But this statute has to have a\nlimitation point.\nAnd if you look at it from 1863 up to the\npresent, it is intended just as the Tanner case said.\nAnd in Marcus versus Hess you said that the criminal\nfalse claim statutes have to be construed identically\nwith the civil false claims provisions if they contain\nidentical language. 371 has the same language as the\nFalse Claims Act's, and the Tanner case is dispositive.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Olson.\n"
