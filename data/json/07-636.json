        "content": "(1:00 p.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Case 07-636, Kennedy v. The Plan Administrator\nfor DuPont Savings and Investment Plan.\nMr. Furlow.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. FURLOW\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. FURLOW: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nAs this Court has confined consideration of\nthe matters before the Court to certiorari issue number\n5 concerning qualified domestic relations orders, or\nQDROs as they are called, I will confine my argument to\narguing that the Fifth Circuit erred in holding that the\nonly way a divorcing spouse can waive the right to\npension benefits is by executing a QDRO. I have four\nbasic arguments to present today. I'll give them in\nthumbnail sketch form first.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You did in your reply\nbrief address the plan question?\nMR. FURLOW: Yes, Your Honor. I did so\nafter stating that we believe that the matter was\nproperly confined to the certiorari issue number three,\nbut out of an abundance of caution and subject to\nobjection I did respond to the argument leveled against\nus by I think it is five amici and by DuPont itself. We\nnevertheless, I prepared my original briefing on the\nmerits to address the QDRO issue and that's where you\nsee it focused. We have four basic issues.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The problem is that is\nthat if you, even if we hold for you on that issue, you\ncould still lose on the plan documents rule, right.\nMR. FURLOW: Well, Your Honor, I think that\ninstead this Court might choose well to follow what the\nconcurrence said in the recent LaRue v. DeWolff, Boberg\ncase, emphasizing that where the court of appeals below\nhas not passed on the central issue of a case and where\nmost of the fire that the one party is responding to\ncomes from amici, that it is appropriate to remand the\ncase to that court so that that court may pass on the\ncentral issue, especially in the situation where, as\nhere, the Fifth Circuit did not even mention the plan\ndocument's role, but based its decision solely on a\nmisinterpretation of the QDRO language.\nOf course, here, in the interest of candor,\nDupont did in fact address in brief format -- a page or\nto, several pages -- in its motion for summary judgment\nthe plan document's role and raised that matter again in\nthe Fifth Circuit. It's just the Fifth Circuit did not\nconsider or pass on that because it relied solely on\nDupont's argument that the Fifth Circuit should adhere\nto what it believed to be the Department of Treasury's\ninterpretation of the anti-alienation statute. The\nDepartment of the Treasury and the Department of Labor,\nnow in a harmonized stance, have come forth and in their\namicus for the government supports our position that the\nFifth Circuit erred in its interpretation of the QDRO\nstatute, and that's the position we take.\nJUSTICE BREYER: At the end of your\nargument, could you just spend a minute because my state\nof mind is I'm sorry we limited it. You've sort of\nbriefed this question pretty fully.\nMR. FURLOW: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I'm tempted to try to\ndecide it. I know you want to make your four points.\nGo right ahead. But at the end, could you possibly say,\nwhy shouldn't we just go ahead and decide the substance,\nnot as a technical matter. Are we really going to get\nsomething out of remanding it that we don't already\nknow? But don't do that now, but whenever you want.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We know what's going to\nhappen on remand, though, don't we? Doesn't the Fifth\nCircuit already have case law on -- on that question?\nMR. FURLOW: The Fifth Circuit already has\ncase law. They have stated that, but they consider some\nof the other cases and they might consider this Court's\nruling addressing the interpretation of the QDRO\nprovision; that might provide them additional\nenlightenment as to how they should address the\nother issue.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But again as a preliminary\nmatter, am I on the same page with Justice Ginsburg? Or\nwould it be a different question? I'm curious to know\nwhy the beneficiary designation and change provisions at\npage 48, number 29c, beneficiaries, couldn't have been\ninvoked here. Is that the same question Justice\nGinsburg was asking?\nMR. FURLOW: I do not believe so, Justice\nKennedy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Because the plan does\ncontain a procedure for designating some other\nbeneficiary, including the spouse. I just don't\nunderstand why anybody doesn't talk about that.\nMR. FURLOW: Well, Your Honor, there was\nthat provision for invoking another beneficiary and we\nonly pointed out that indeed three days after the\ndivorce, and consistent with his ex-wife's waiver of any\nright, title, claim and interest in this 401(k) plan in\nspecific, and that was the very first item of the things\nthat he retained as the plan participant in that divorce\ndecree, he did in fact designate his sole daughter Kari\nKennedy as his sole beneficiary in a change of form plan\nfor one part of this very complex series of multiple\nplans -- of plan retirement benefits where he said that\nhe would give -- that she would be his sole beneficiary;\nand the form there that DuPont drafted for him said that\nit invoked and superseded any and all prior\ndesignations, and was not limited to that one particular\npart 6 pension and retirements plan. And so we submit\nit is a reasonable explanation, if he did not believe\nthat his wife had waived any right, title and interest\nto invoke that beneficiary clause, pursuant to the Fifth\nCircuit's decision just six weeks beforehand in the\nBrandon v Travelers International case that said that a\nwaiver of ERISA benefits, welfare benefits mainly -- but\nERISA waiver of benefits, a voluntary waiver was\nenforceable, was valid and could be enforced at summary\njudgment.\nWe believe his counsel, you know, were aware\nof that in formulating, you know, this waiver of\nbenefits. Even if that didn't take care of Liv\nKennedy's knowing, voluntary, attorney-negotiated,\ncourt-approved, signed-by-her waiver of any right,\ntitle, claim and interest in his pension benefits, then\nwe believe he may have believed as a layman that by\nsigning that beneficiary designation form prepared by\nDuPont, that he had indeed superseded and revoked all\nprior designations.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Or he might have -- he\nmight have decided that he didn't want to revoke that\none. We -- we just have no way of knowing. It's odd\nthat he revoked as to one plan but not the 501(k) plan,\nas I understand.\nMR. FURLOW: Your Honor, I might -- I might,\nif I would, just offer an explanation. He almost\ncertainly saw no reason to revoke that which his wife\nhad just four days before voluntarily waived any right,\ntitle, claim and interest to in terms of the divorce.\nHe certainly would have expected that her word would be\nher bond and that it wouldn't turn out to be a junk bond\nas it turned out to be when years later she repudiated\nher own voluntary waiver; and that's just one of the\nissues that we address.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, because he could --\nhe could have -- despite her waiver, he could have named\nher as the beneficiary of that plan and that would have\ncontrolled.\nMR. FURLOW: Well, Your Honor, the way I see\nit is that his attorneys who were advising him and\nguiding him through this process, they were acting, we\nmust assume, in complete awareness of Texas and Fifth\nCircuit law; and the Fifth Circuit had just ruled some\nsix weeks before in a case involving voluntary divorce\ndecree waivers that such a waiver was enforceable. Now\nyou don't have to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry; six weeks\nbefore what?\nMR. FURLOW: Before the divorce decree in\nthe Brandon v. Travelers International case. We believe\nthat there was no sense there in bombing the rubble. If\nit was already taken care of, it didn't have to be taken\ncare of the second time. Now, I and you might want a\nbelt-and-suspenders approach to be absolutely, doubly,\npositively sure. But the fundamental thing is if under\nFederal common law, as a majority of courts and almost\nall of the State courts have ruled, a voluntary waiver\nis enforceable, then that was already taken care of.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but how does\nthe plan know that?\nMR. FURLOW: The plan knows that, as here,\nwhen the court-appointed fiduciary, the executrix Kari\nKennedy makes the plan aware of that on April 26, 2001,\nvia fax and delivery, which is acknowledged by their\nplan administrator, Mary Deneen that's coming in, and\nthere you have a copy of the divorce decree served on\nDuPont months before they make a payout.\nAnd it is critical here, Your Honor, that\nwhen they chose to make this -- you know, when they\nchose to pay the beneficiary, they were working on a\ntest case right there from the very beginning. And if\nyou look at their paralegal's letter, who actually\nnotifies the estate that they are going to disregard the\nvoluntary test case, they refer to DuPont's success in\nraising this issue before. And then the paralegal\nactually quotes a Fifth Circuit case that holds for\nvoluntary waivers, obviously not understanding the, you\nknow, crucial import here; and we note --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the plan terms\nsay that if you want to change the beneficiary, here's\nhow you've got to change the beneficiary; and we are\ngoing to pay the beneficiary until it's changed.\nMR. FURLOW: Well, Your Honor, I would also\nsay that the plan forms here at page 48 of your joint\nappendix, and 49 -- I ask this Court to scrutinize these\ntwo provisions because they are critical to the outcome\nof the case. At page 48 you hear the following\nmandatory language in DuPont's own SIP. And it says:\n\"If no surviving spouse exists and no beneficiary\ndesignation is in effect, distribution shall\" --\nmandatory term -- \"shall be made to or in accordance\nwith the directions of the executor or administrator of\nthe decedent's estate.\" And so we say that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought\nyour friend on the other side would be quoting that\nlanguage.\nMR. FURLOW: Well, Your Honor, I like to\nbring a fresh insight to the -- to the -- to the\nPetitioner's argument here because I see that language\nand we say it is not in effect. This Court has ruled in\nseveral cases what the term \"in effect\" means, and in\nERISA cases saying this version of ERISA was in effect,\nmeaning valid and operational. Well, the voluntary\nwaiver was in effect and that made the beneficiary\ndesignation some 10 years before during the course of\nthe marriage ineffectual, invalid. And so --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's -- that's\na bit of a stretch, isn't it? It says no beneficiary\ndesignation is in effect. If you look at the plan, he's\ngot a beneficiary designation.\nMR. FURLOW: But it's not in effect at the\ntime that it comes to be decided because their plan\nadministrator Mary Deneen has a copy of the divorce\ndecree with the knowing voluntary waiver. And although,\nYour Honor, although they take the position that plan\nadministrators can't understand knowing and voluntary\nwaivers, that that's a law sort of thing, they have got\none in-house counsel there who was never called upon to\nactually pass on this matter and it wouldn't have cost\nthem a dime to go outside of that in-house counsel.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, that was\nthe point of my earlier point. I focused on -- on this\nwhole paragraph.\nMR. FURLOW: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That just indicates that\nthis would have been a different case if the provision\nof the plan that said there shall be no assignment,\nwhich is quoted in the Fifth Circuit thing, was the only\nprovision in the plan; but when you look through this in\nretrospect, there are means for participants and\nbeneficiaries to make a change, and they weren't\nfollowed here.\nMR. FURLOW: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I understand that you\nsay in effect they were. I understand that argument but\nit's not as if the plan didn't contain an adequate\nvehicle if the -- the parties had followed strictly the\nterms of the plan.\nMR. FURLOW: Your Honor, we submit that\npeople all the time in situations like this may believe\nthat a knowing voluntary waiver which has received the\napproval of the majority of the Federal appellate courts\nand the State courts is good enough. In some other\ninstances, they forget. They forget to do this or to\nmake those changes, or believe that one of a series of\nmultiple and overlapping beneficiary designations has --\nas the June 7th one did, we submit -- revoked and\nsuperseded any and all prior designations, and they are\nlay people not lawyers.\nNow, I would submit that the critical thing\nis also on page 49 the very portion of the joint\nappendix that you're looking at, because that language\nsays, in the DuPont SIP plan, quote, \"if in the opinion\nof the company there is a question as to the legal right\nof any beneficiary to receive a distribution under the\nplan, the amount in question may be paid to the\ndecedent's estate in which event the trustee and the\ncompany shall have no further liability to anyone in\nrespect to such amounts.\" Consider that when you've\nheard all of the fear mongering that's come in, in the\namici briefs with respect to -- to interpleader actions.\nAnd we submit that interpleader actions are a perfectly\ngood means of disposing of this, but if you --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's in the opinion\nof the company. That sounds -- and this is a plan -- as\nwe've said often in ERISA cases, we want to enforce\nthese according to the terms of the plan because the\ncompanies don't have to set these up at all. So it\nmakes perfect sense for the company to say, well, if we\nthink this, then we can do this. So, in other words,\nthere's a doubt and we don't want to give it to somebody\nwho might not end up being the person, but if we don't\nthink there's a doubt, that's it.\nMR. FURLOW: And that's the first step in\nthe analysis, Your Honor, because the second step is all\nof this Supreme Court case and all of the substantial\nexpenses that this estate out of Jasper, Texas, has had\nto pay from the very beginning could have been avoided\nhad they paid over to Kari Kennedy, a court-appointed\nexecutrix who would have taken that money in and would\nhave been bound by the rules of the probate court to\nhandle it as a fiduciary to consider Liv's claim that\nher voluntary waiver was not voluntary, to pay the\ncreditors first, rather than get stuck with the past\nliabilities, which happened here.\nThe important thing is DuPont could have\navoided all of this litigation, would not have had to\nfile an interpleader, would not have had to incur a\ndime's worth of attorney's fees, would not have had to\nput its own interest ahead of that of the participants\nand beneficiaries, had they simply invoked this clause\nas they had the power to do. They chose this case.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We can't decide this case\nbased on sympathy to DuPont. I would understand the\npoint of your argument. But if -- in theory the problem\nwould be exactly the same, whether DuPont had expressed\na doubt and paid it into the estate or hadn't.\nMR. FURLOW: The problem --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We have the same question\nbefore us.\nMR. FURLOW: The QDRO question, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. FURLOW: Yes, and that's why we say that\nif you look carefully at -- excuse me, but it's 29\nU.S.C. section 1056(b) through (k) -- you look at the\nspecific language, and I am asking this Court to adhere\nto the specific written terms of the ERISA statute\nbecause those require a transfer to an alternate payee.\nThat is our fundamental argument: A transfer to an\nalternate payee which is defined in 1056(d)(3)(K) as\nbeing someone --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Sorry. Does this appear\nsomewhere in the materials? It's always helpful.\nMR. FURLOW: Respondents' brief, Your Honor,\nand you will find it specifically on pages 14A and 15A,\nin the appendix in the back. And if you actually go to\nthe language, we stand on a plain-meaning interpretation\nof the ERISA statute, this reticulated and complicated\nstatute. We say every word has its meaning.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What do you want me to\nread here?\nMR. FURLOW: Specifically, Your Honors,\npages 14A and 15A of the Respondents' appendix, where he\nhas actually given us all of the QDRO statute at 1056.\nAnd we say that has meaning, and that means\nwe prevail because, if you look at that language, every\nsubpart is talking about payments to alternate payees.\n\"Alternate payees\" are defined at 1056(d)(3)(K), and you\nwill find that, Your Honors, specifically at page, at\npage 22A to 23A in the appendix.\nThe alternate payees there that we are\ntalking about are spouse, ex-spouse, child, or other\ndependent. It does not refer to the plan participant\nMr. Kennedy; and, therefore, there was no -- his mere\nretention of his pension benefits and his wife's waiver\nof her contingent beneficiary payments, which would only\ncome to her upon the death of William Kennedy, meant\nthere was no transfer, not a dime's worth of money, not\na bit of pension benefits transferred on the date that\nshe signed that waiver. There was thus no --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I'm not sure I'm getting\nthis argument. There's not -- the argument isn't that\nthere was a QDRO; the argument was that he could have\ndisposed of this through a QDRO. And he could have done\nthat, and he could have named an alternate payee in the\nQDRO. He could have named his daughter, for example.\nMR. FURLOW: Your Honor, the way pension\nplanners understand it is that you use a QDRO for a\ntransfer of benefits, not for a bare waiver. And that's\nwhere the U.S. Solicitor General supports our position\nand reads this and says that's consistent with\nTreasury's own, now harmonized with Labor's,\ninterpretation of the anti-alienation clause. It does\nnot apply to bare waivers of benefits, and, therefore,\nthe Fifth Circuit erred in putting within a QDRO context\nhis wife's --\nJUSTICE ALITO: All you're saying is that\nyou couldn't effect a bare waiver through a QDRO, but\nwhy does that prove your case? I don't understand that.\nMR. FURLOW: We think that --\nJUSTICE ALITO: A QDRO could have been used\nto direct the payment to someone else other than the\nex-spouse.\nMR. FURLOW: With respect to her waiver that\nwould have required him in advance to decide who he\nwould have transferred what alternate payee he would\ntransfer way back at the time of his divorce in 1994.\nHe cannot. He did not transfer anything to his wife.\nShe didn't receive anything at that time. She simply\nwaived her contingent right to receive something upon\nher death, something that would occur in the future.\nShe thoroughly waived that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's not your point. It\nwould seem to me your point is that the QDRO is an\nexception to the assignment or alienation.\nMR. FURLOW: I believe --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And your point is this has\nbeen no assignment or agency, so we don't need the QDRO\nexception. There is nothing in here that violates\nanything in the statute.\nMR. FURLOW: I completely agree with that\nanalysis.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So whether he could have\ndone a QDRO is in your view irrelevant. Your basic case\nis the QDRO is an exception from the prohibition on\nassignment or alienation, that provision has no\napplication here, there has been no assignment or\nalienation, and therefore the waiver is effective.\nMR. FURLOW: That's exactly our position\nYour Honor, yes. So we find support in that and we find\nsupport in not only Treasury's interpretation of its own\nregulation, which deserves great deference under this\nCourt's opinion, especially when DuPont in the Fifth\nCircuit asserted that it was Department of Treasury that\nhad all of the expertise pursuant to congressional\nmandate in determining how QDROs should apply and told\nthe Fifth Circuit to follow their outdated\ninterpretation of the QDRO statute. They certainly are\nnot in a position to say that the expertise that they\ntouted in the Fifth Circuit should be disregarded now,\nand we submit that the Attorney General and the\nSolicitor General are correct in saying that the\nregulation does not mean what DuPont says it does, but\nmeans what Kennedy says it does.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, of course you\nonly think the Solicitor General is right so far to a\ncertain extent.\nMR. FURLOW: To a certain extent.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Then you throw them\nunder the train because you don't -- you certainly don't\nthink they are correct by saying, look, the only way you\ncan do this is by modifying the plan. I still don't\nknow how the plan administrator is supposed to know that\nthe person whose name appears on the plan documents,\nwhich the plan participant can change at any time, isn't\nthe person that they are supposed to send the benefits\nto. Now, you tell me here they knew about the divorce\nand all that stuff. Maybe, maybe not. But we are\ntrying to develop a rule for all cases and it seems to\nme the easiest, most administrable rule is to say\nwhoever's name appears there gets the money, and if they\nare not supposed to because of some collateral dispute,\nwell, they can sort that out in litigation. Maybe Kari\nhas a suit against Mrs. Kennedy or her estate, but\nthat's not a matter for the plan to worry about.\nMR. FURLOW: Well, Your Honor, let me\naddress that. First, we don't throw the Solicitor\nGeneral under the tracks. We simply point out the fact\nthat they have gone off track in terms of their plan\ndocuments. And specifically, Your Honor, I would say I\nagree with the Manning versus, the Manning decision of\nthe Texas, of the Fifth Circuit, which we cited. In\nthere that says that sections 1102 and 1104 of ERISA are\na very thin reed indeed to on which to cobble together a\nplan document's rule. And specifically DuPont then goes\none bridge too far going way beyond that to say that\nthese ever meetable ever changeable beneficiary changes\nthousands of them constitute documents where the Ninth\nCircuit conity substitutes of what constitutes plan\ndocuments in the salaried employees of Hughes versus\nHughes administrator case and said that a list of the\nparticipants and their addresses could not be considered\na plan document because it did not correspond with that\ndetailed listing of the plan document under Section 1024\nand 102 a. Indeed under Section 1025, Your Honors, if\nthese are plan documents then the administrator has a\nduty to disclose them to any person participant or\nbeneficiary who asked and as the Ninth Circuit pointed\nout there is substantial dangers there of going way\nbeyond what Congress, a very liberal Watergate Congress\nin 1974, intended ERISA to be, which is a protection for\nparticipants and beneficiaries, not for plan\nadministrators. And it exposes those participants and\nbeneficiaries to loss of privacy, telemarketing, and\nother things because one person could get such a list\nand sell it to others.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I must have missed\n-- where did Watergate come from.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FURLOW: Just putting in context the\nintentions of the 1974 Congress, which was concerned\nabout participants and beneficiaries. Those were the\nsole purposes for which section 1102 was designed to\nprotect, not the convenience of plan administrators as\nDuPont would lead this Court to believe.\nI see that I'm into rebuttal time. I would\nlike to save some for that. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Kruger.\nORAL ARGUMENT BY LEONDRA R. KRUGER\nON BEHALF OF AMICUS CURIAE\nMS. KRUGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Fifth Circuit decided this case on the\ngrounds that ERISA's anti-alienation provision forbids a\ndivorcing spouse from relinquishing an interest in his\nor her ex-spouse's pension plan benefits unless the\nwaiver takes the form of a qualified domestic relations\norder.\nWe agree with Petitioner that the Fifth\nCircuit misinterpreted both the anti-alienation\nprovision and the QDRO exception to that provision. But\nwe disagree with Petitioner's further submission that\nmerely because ERISA does not forbid waivers in the\ndivorce context or otherwise, that a plan administrator\nmay be required as a matter of Federal common law to\nrecognize such waivers even when those waivers conflict\nwith the beneficiary designation the plan administrator\nhas on file.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, are the provisions\nof page 49 of the appendix consistent with the statute?\nMS. KRUGER: Indeed, Your Honor, we think\nthat they are. The statute directs plan administrators\nto administer the plan in accordance with the plan\ndocuments and further requires administrators to pay\nbenefits to persons who are either participants under\nthe plan or who are beneficiaries within the meaning of\nthe statute.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Did the Court of Appeals\ngive short shrift or overlook that point?\nMS. KRUGER: Well, the Court of Appeals\ndetermined that it need not reach this point because it\ndecided the case on different grounds; namely, the\nanti-alienation grounds. But, again, we think that if\nthe Fifth Circuit was incorrect in its reasoning but\nreached the correct overall conclusion, then its\njudgment should be affirmed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we -- I mean, we\ncould have -- you know, we should have thought of that\nwhen we limited our -- our grant of certiorari to the --\nto the one question on which you agree with the\nPetitioner. But we did do that, didn't we, even though\nthe other one was -- was explicitly put under our nose,\nand we said we -- we are not going to get into that? We\njust want to decide this question, which is an important\nquestion all by itself.\nMS. KRUGER: Well, for several reasons, Your\nHonor, we think it would be appropriate for the Court to\nanswer both the plan documents question as well as the\nanti-alienation question.\nOne is that it is an alternative ground for\naffirmance.\nThe other is that it was properly raised in\nthe Court of Appeals. It was raised in the cert\npetition as well as in the brief in opposition.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you know any other case\nin which we have explicitly declined to accept a\nquestion and then have used one of these other back\ndoorways of -- of answering it anyway?\nMS. KRUGER: I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know of any. I\nmean maybe -- maybe we have but --\nMS. KRUGER: I'm -- I'm not sure that I know\nof any either, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, could we do this? I\nmean, what's bothering me about this is -- is you have a\nvery strong argument following the plan documents. They\nhave had some chance to reply to it, but not a full\nchance. It seems a little unfair, and the Fifth Circuit\nhad -- would probably know what they say. Okay. Can\nwe, say, grant the question now and ask that people file\nan additional brief if they want to say something?\nIt just seems to me an awful waste of money\nand everybody's time to send it back and have it make\nanother trip. So what's your suggestion as to how we\nproceed?\nMS. KRUGER: Well, Your Honor, I think it\nwould be possible to -- to either order for the briefing\non the issue or to grant the question now at this\njuncture. I think it would also be conceivable to read\nthe question that the Court did grant on as encompassing\nthe Federal common law --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You see, I want to be fair\nto them. I mean, we want -- you want to be fair to the\nother side to be sure they have a chance to say\neverything they have to say. That's what's worrying me.\nMS. KRUGER: Well, Your Honor, that is an\nimportant consideration. I do think that in the opening\nbrief the Petitioners did brief the question of what\neffect is to be given to a waiver if indeed a waiver is\nnot prohibited by the anti-alienation clause. And that\nFederal common law rule that Petitioners suggest is one\nthat does, I think, naturally invite some consideration\nof the conflicting statutory directive in the form of\nthe plan documents principle that this Court has\nrecognized in its earlier cases. And certainly in its\nreply brief Petitioners did address this issue in full.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did -- did we recognize in\nearlier cases that beneficiary designations are plan\ndocuments?\nMS. KRUGER: Well, Your Honor, I think the\nquestion of whether beneficiary designation forms,\ncounsel plan documents, is a little bit beside the\npoint. The -- the plan documents in this case do\nspecify a procedure for determining who is to receive\nbenefits. It says that benefits will be paid to the\ndesignated beneficiary, the person who is designated by\nthe participant. And it says that changes to those\nbeneficiary designations shall be made in the manner\nthat's prescribed by the plan.\nAnd so, because the plan sets out a\nprocedure for changing beneficiary designations, we\nthink that it would be inappropriate to look beyond that\nto require plan administrators to look to extrinsic\ndocuments in order to determine whether one of them\noverrides that designation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Again, assuming there has\nbeen a change of beneficiary designation, and, of\ncourse, the argument you're confronted with is: I\nhaven't changed anything. The prior beneficiary simply\n-- simply refused to accept it, waived it. I haven't\nchanged the designation at all.\nMS. KRUGER: Well, in this case there is a\nconflict then between the wishes of the participant, who\nby all accounts would have chosen not to change the\nbeneficiary designation, and that of the beneficiary.\nAnd in that case in order to effectuate the\n-- the interests of all parties involved in order to\nprovide certainty to all parties in ascertaining what\ntheir rights are with respect to the plan, then it is\nincumbent on the plan administrator to abide by the\ndesignated beneficiary.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I think it's a harder\nquestion than you make it; and I, for one, have not gone\ninto it as deeply as I would like to, principally\nbecause we rejected that -- that question.\nMS. KRUGER: Well, again, Your Honor, we\nthink it would be appropriate for the Court to go on to\naddress that question because the issues have been fully\naired both in the Fifth Circuit and in the briefing in\nthis Court. But if the Court were inclined to -- to\nreserve that question for a later time, I think that\nwould be fine as well. And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Am I right in\nunderstanding that there is a fairly sharp circuit split\non that question, even that majority of the circuits are\ncontrary to the Government's position?\nMS. KRUGER: That is correct. There is a\ncircuit split on the question as was raised in the\npetition for certiorari, and the Second and Sixth\nCircuits are the circuits that have to date agreed with\nthe position that we are espousing here: That the plan\ndocuments control and preclude formulation of a Federal\ncommon law rule of the sort that Petitioner proposes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And which circuits\nare on the other side?\nMS. KRUGER: There are a number of them\nincluding the Fifth, the Seventh, the Third.\nThe reason why the plan documents rule is so\nimportant in this case is because it serves important\nstatutory interests in certainty, certainty of the\nparties as well as certainty of the administrators.\nAnd it is clear; it is easy to apply; it\nmakes it possible for administrators to do their jobs\nwithout fear of further litigation in case they happen\nto make what a court may later in the proceedings\ndetermine is the wrong choice.\nFor that reason, we think that ERISA is\nclear, and that it doesn't permit the kind of Federal\ncommon law rule that Petitioner proposes, which is one\nthat would essentially revise the statute to override\nthe plan documents rule and would require substantial\nburdens on the plan and would yield uncertainty for the\nparties.\nFor that reason we would ask the Court to\naffirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals on\nalternative grounds or, alternatively, it should remand\nfor further proceedings.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Levy.\nORAL ARGUMENT BY MARK I. LEVY\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. LEVY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn light of the Court's questions, I want to\nbegin with the plan documents argument and first the\nprocedural question of whether it's properly before the\nCourt. We think that it is.\nIt's well within the settled doctrine of an\nalternative ground for affirmance. It was raised below,\nand the Fifth Circuit has decided the issue in other\ncases. We don't dispute that. So we know what the\nFifth Circuit thinks about this issue, and, therefore,\nthere is no point in a remand.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you know of any case in\nwhich we've done this --\nMR. LEVY: I do.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- rejected the question\nand then decided it?\nMR. LEVY: I apologize if it's not in the\nbrief, but a case I could find was called Piper Aircraft\nversus Rayno 454 U.S. 235. And in that case the court\nlimited its grant of certiorari, but then went ahead and\ndecided a question that wasn't subsumed within that\nquestion because they found it appropriate to the proper\ndisposition of the case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. But is that\na case in which the question the court decided was\npresented in the petition, the court said we are not\ngoing to take that question then they decided it on that\nground anyway.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's what I'm asking.\nYes.\nMR. LEVY: I'm not sure of the answer to\nthat.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You are sure of the answer.\nYou don't know of any case.\nMR. LEVY: I think Piper is at least a first\ncousin if not a direct sibling of the issue that we've\ngot here. I don't disagree that it is in the Court's\ndiscretion. The Court has discretion, I think, one --\neither way whether it wants to decide this or wants\nremand, but we think it would be appropriate --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess you agree\nthat it's a question of which the circuits have split,\nso presumably there are good arguments on both sides,\nand it's one that your friend hasn't had a full\nopportunity to brief here. So we'd have to be pretty\nconfident of the answer, I think, to go ahead and decide\nit.\nMR. LEVY: Well, actually I think the Court\nwill be confident if it looks into it. But beyond that\nthis is the classic case of an alternative ground for\naffirmance of the judgment. When that arises, the\ntopside party always has to deal with that issue in its\nreply brief and only in its reply brief. So there is\nnothing unfair about the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It would be the classic\ncase but for the fact that we had rejected that\nquestion. Had we not been asked to decide it and said\nno, it would be the classic case, I agree.\nMR. LEVY: And I agree. That makes it\nwithin the Court's discretion. It doesn't have to\ndecide it, but we think there are good reasons here.\nIt's been fully briefed, including by the Petitioner for\nthe reason I just said. Four amici have addressed it;\nwe have addressed it. So it's properly before the\nCourt, and there is nothing unfair about deciding it.\nIn addition --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can we expect that to\nhappen in future cases when we turn down a question and\namici and people come in and brief the question anyway\nand then ask us to decide it?\nMR. LEVY: I wouldn't think so. The fact\nthat we can't find another case, either, I think makes\nthis one unique. And I think there are good reasons --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I think there is a\nquestion of the way it was phrased. And perhaps the\ncourt just didn't get it, what that question on which we\ndidn't grant cert was driving at.\nMR. LEVY: I would be loathe to make that\nsuggestion, Justice Ginsburg.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. LEVY: But it may well -- it's possible\nthat that could be the explanation or the Court with\nfuller consideration -- I mean, the issue has been fully\nbriefed. The Court knows more about the issues than it\ndid at the time it granted cert, and we think it is for\na -- to decide this.\nAnd I do want to point out that there is a\nrelationship between the questions. Both the question\ngranted and the question that wasn't granted -- wasn't\ndenied, but it wasn't granted -- raise similar\nconsiderations. They both get into the same statutory\nscheme. They both get into the same considerations of\nplan administrability. We think it would be most\nefficient for the Court to resolve the conflict now and\nnot leave the uncertainty to continue any further.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Undoubtedly we should have\ngranted it.\nMR. LEVY: Well, in the fullness of time,\nthe Court can now revisit that. But again, I think it\nhas been fully briefed and there is nothing unfair to\nthe Petitioners. The Court in its discretion --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you like to argue\nthe question that is here?\nMR. LEVY: Yes --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. LEVY: -- I would. I take it the Court\ndoesn't need argument on the merits of the plan\ndocuments issues, since that's already been discussed,\nso let me turn to the QDRO question. That is the\nquestion that was -- that was granted and was discussed\nfully in the briefs.\nNow, as to the QDRO part of the case, the\nrule of law that governs this case is that pension plan\nadministrators must pay benefits in accordance with a\nqualified domestic relations order, and they may not pay\nbenefits in accordance with a nonqualified order.\nThat rule follows from two separate and\ndifferent analyses. One is the anti-alienation\nprovision, and the other is the QDRO provision in\nsubparagraph (H) of section 1056. They are both\ndiscussed in our brief.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where would I find the\nlatter? If I wanted to read it? Which I do.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. LEVY: I don't find this all that\npleasant reading, but it's on page 21A of the statutory\nappendix to the red brief.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: 21A?\nMR. LEVY: 21A. And it's (H)(ii) and (iii).\nAnd I want to start with this because it is really is\nthe more straightforward analysis and avoids a lot of\nquestions under the anti-alienation provision. This\nargument would prevail whether or not the purported\nwaiver is deemed to be an assignment or alienation under\n1056(d)(1) and (d)(3).\nNow, we think it is and I'll come back to\nthat under the IRS regulation, but let me start with\nthis alternative argument that's also made in the brief.\nUnder ERISA, a domestic relations order is\neither a qualified order or a nonqualified order. And\nERISA expressly provides that if it's a nonqualified\norder, as it is here, the plan administrator may not pay\nbenefits pursuant to that order.\nJustice Scalia, since you're on page 21A,\nlet's look at subparagraph (H)(iii). This is 21A of the\nred brief. It provides that: If an order is not\nqualified, the plan administrator shall pay the benefits\nto the person or persons who would be entitled to such\nbenefits if there had been no order. If there had been\nno order. In other words, the administrator disregards\nit and pays it to the person -- this is in (iii),\nJustice Scalia.\nContrast that with subparagraph (H)(ii)\nright above it, where the order is qualified: The\nadministrator shall pay the benefits to the person\nentitled thereto under the order.\nSo, it gives you two choices. If it's a\nqualified order, the plan must pay. If it's not a\nqualified order, the plan --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that doesn't make too\nmuch sense, does it, where all that happens is it's just\nwaived. The wife waived the amount because when she\nwaived the amount, she doesn't give it to anybody. She\njust doesn't take it. So it goes to the beneficiary --\nit goes to the person who made up the plan. It's a\nlittle hard to pay to him, because he is dead.\nSo I mean if you read it literally, it\ndoesn't seem to apply, these (ii) and (iii), to the case\nbefore us, which is a case of waiver. And of course the\nargument, yes, she makes is that throughout the law,\nwaiver is treated differently. And if it weren't, you'd\nhave to pay gift tax, for example, when you waive a\nbenefit that's given to you by someone else.\nAnd so let's interpret this and make sense\nof the language you quoted, and consistent with the rest\nof the law to say a waiver is waivered. It's not giving\nsomething to somebody else.\nMR. LEVY: You've covered a lot of ground,\nJustice Breyer. I want to give you several responses --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The argument is against you\nand I would like to hear what you have to say.\nMR. LEVY: And I appreciate that.\nFirst of all, on this part of the argument\nunder the QDRO provision under subparagraph (H), it\ndoesn't matter whether this is a waiver or not. That\ngoes to the alienation question, and I will get to that\nin a little while. This applies --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, it also goes to the\nquestion of who is the person or persons who would have\nbeen entitled to such amounts if there had been no\norder.\nMR. LEVY: If there were no --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If there was a waiver and\nthere had been no order, your friend's contention is by\ntraditional common law, the person who would have been\nentitled to it would have been his client.\nMR. LEVY: On the contrary, Justice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, I don't see how\nthis language helps you. It sort of restates the\nquestion, but --\nMR. LEVY: I don't believe so. I think it\nis not only helpful but dispositive. The order that is\nreferred to is the divorce decree, the qualified\ndomestic -- I'm sorry -- the domestic relations order.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. LEVY: If there had been no order --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If there had been no\norder --\nMR. LEVY: -- then there wouldn't have been\nany waiver by Liv. I mean, excuse me -- yes, by Liv.\nThere wouldn't have been any waiver if there weren't any\ndivorce decree because the waiver is contained --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I see. I see.\nMR. LEVY: -- in the decree. So, if there\nwere no --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I see your point. Does he\nagree with that, that apart from the divorce decree,\nthere is no waiver?\nMR. LEVY: I'd hesitate to speak for him,\nbut I think the language is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I got you.\nMR. LEVY: -- quite clear, and that's why\nthis is a more straightforward analysis than the waiver\nunder anti-alienation. I do hope to get to that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I see.\nMR. LEVY: But this is really very\nstraightforward and dispositive.\nAnd the legislative history confirms this.\nThe plain text is clear, but the legislative history\nconfirms it. Congress took a specific look at this\nspecific issue in a specific context of marital\ndissolution, and it enacted this QDRO provision. And\nthe provision is comprehensive and complete.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm -- I didn't follow, I'd\nhave to admit. I think -- and you perhaps can explain\nit to me -- but, I thought the things that you are\nquoting are QDRO is about an effort to alienate some\nproperty that would otherwise go to the person who was\nsetting up a QDRO, in other words, the wife here, in\nother words Liv here; is that right?\nMR. LEVY: No. It has to go to an alternate\npayee. It doesn't have to be the wife.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. The one person who\ncouldn't be an alternate payee is the payor. And so, in\nfact, when you waive something, it isn't that it\nnecessarily goes back to some alternate payee, as it\ndidn't here. It simply went back to the payor. And so\nthe language of this prevision you're quoting just\ndoesn't deal with this case.\nMR. LEVY: Well, I think it does, Justice\nBreyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know you do, and that's\nwhat I need to ask.\nMR. LEVY: It doesn't say anything about\nwhere it goes. It just says if it's a QDRO, you pay it,\nand if it's not a QDRO, you don't pay it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm sorry. It says, if\nit's not, the issue to wit is not resolved, then the\nplan administrator shall pay the segregated amounts to\nthe person or persons who would have been entitled to\nsuch amounts if there had been no order.\nMR. LEVY: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, you think that\nincludes the giver, the payor?\nMR. LEVY: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's where this\ngoes if you waive it.\nMR. LEVY: I don't believe so, because the\n\"if there had no order\" clause refers to the domestic\nrelations order, a divorce decree.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You say the waiver is in\nthe order?\nMR. LEVY: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And without the order,\nthere has been no waiver.\nMR. LEVY: That's correct. And the statute\nsays --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We'll have to see whether\nyour friend agrees with that. I'll bet he doesn't.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. LEVY: That's what made horse races.\nLet me just say a further word about the legislative\nhistory of this and then come back to the\nanti-alienation provision, Justice Breyer, if I -- if I\nmight.\nCongress made it clear that benefits are to\nbe paid pursuant to an order \"if and only if\" -- and\nthat's a quote from the legislative history -- the order\nis a QDRO; in other words, the order be a QDRO in order\nto be paid. Congress was mindful of the burdens that\nnonqualified orders put on plan administrators and it\npurposely sought to avoid that by requiring that an\norder be a QDRO, a qualified order, in order for there\n-- for there to be payment. The QDRO provision is an\nobjective checklist that is easy for -- for plan\nadministrators to follow.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if they had agreed to\nthe waiver apart from -- apart from the -- from the\ndomestic relations order? Just apart from that, they\nhave a separate signed waiver. We'd be in the same suit\nthat you're -- that you say we have to avoid, wouldn't\nwe?\nMR. LEVY: I don't think so. I mean I think\nthat would be an alienation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if it's an\nalienation, but his point is that a waiver is not an\nalienation.\nMR. LEVY: Right. And I will come to that,\nbut the point here is that this arises and can only\narise in a domestic relations context. That's where\nQDRO applies, and the Fifth Circuit's holding was that\nthat was the sole mechanism for the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about some other\nwaiver that's -- that's not in connection with a -- with\na domestic relations thing? You know -- \"I've made my\n-- my eldest son a beneficiary.\" It turns out, you\nknow, he is fat and happy; he doesn't need the money and\nhe agrees to waive it, so -- so I can give it to an\nimpecunious daughter. Okay? What -- what happens with\nthat?\nMR. LEVY: Well, first of all, that would\nrun squarely into the plan document's argument.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ah. Oh, oh, oh. You're\njumping over to the other argument. Let's leave that\nargument out.\nMR. LEVY: If it's not a marital dissolution\ncontext, then QDRO wouldn't apply one way or the other.\nNow, in that context, I think what you're suggesting,\nJustice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but you would still --\nthe plan would still have to make some inquires,\nwouldn't it?\nMR. LEVY: Not -- well, just on -- not\ngetting to the plan documents.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. Not getting in the\nplan documents.\nMR. LEVY: It would be a different case. I\nmean, this case involves what Congress specifically\nlooked at and specifically did in the context of marital\ndissolution, and the reason for that is a marital\ndissolution comes up all the time.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Sure.\nMR. LEVY: It's a commonplace in these\nbenefits issues, and these are high-volumes operations.\nThe plan administrators aren't lawyers. Congress wanted\nbright-line rules that could be easily applied here, not\ngeneral principles to be applied for the facts and\ncircumstances of each particular case, highly\nfact-intensive, highly subjective inquiries. Congress\ndidn't want any of that. It didn't want the plan\nadministrator to have to look behind the face of the\norder to the circumstances of the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm five minutes behind. I\njust got your point on the (iii)(1). I see it.\nMR. LEVY: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay? I get it.\nMR. LEVY: It didn't want the plan\nadministrators to have to try and divine the intention\nof the parties, didn't want the plan administrators to\nhave to hold a factfinding hearing before it could pay\nplan benefits. That is completely foreign to the\nefficient and simple operation that Congress had in\nmind.\nNow let me turn to the anti-alienation issue\nabout which there have been several questions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Before you do, leaving\nthe plan -- the beneficiary designation, you say that\nthe plan administrator is not required to give effect to\na waiver that conflicts with the beneficiary\ndesignation. Is it just not required? Does the\nadministrator have discretion to give effect to the\nwaiver, or it -- must it disregard the waiver and\nstrictly follow the beneficiary designation?\nMR. LEVY: I believe it must follow the\nbeneficiary designation. Indeed, my understanding is it\nhas a fiduciary duty and a legal requirement to follow\nthe plan designation. Now, the plan might specify\nalternatives. Here, for example, the plan said, here's\na form that you fill out. And William Kennedy filled it\nout with respect to a different plan, the pension and\nretirement plan. But where the plan says, \"we will pay\nthe designated beneficiary\" -- and that's what this plan\nsays -- then the plan administrator is required, as I\nunderstand it, to pay that designated beneficiary.\nNow let me say a word since this came up,\nalthough it's not really central to the change of\nbeneficiary designation that William filed for this\nother plan that's not now before the Court, the pension\nand retirement plan. And I would say only two things\nabout that: One is at JA 62, and if you look at it, it\nsays in the title and it says in the body of the\ndocument that this applies to the pension and retirement\nplan. We don't think anyone could have thought that it\napplied to other plans and that William therefore was\nchanging the beneficiary as to those other plans. In\nfact, at JA 28 in paragraph 10, there was a stipulation\nof fact in the district court that William never changed\nthe designation as to the savings and investment plan,\nthe SIP that is before the Court today. So it was not\nonly not raised below, it was stipulated away and I\nthink that was --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Let me go back for a second\nbecause, while I got it five minutes late, if I have it\nright, I still don't see why Congress would have done it\nliterally.\nI think what you're saying is: \"Read the\nfull four pages. What those four pages say are, Judge,\nyou have an order, a divorce decree. It's defined as an\norder. Look at it. It's qualified or it isn't. If\nit's qualified, pay the money to the person it names.\nIf it's not qualified, pay the money to the person,\nnamely Liv, who would have been entitled to the amount\nif there had been no order.\"\nOkay. You read that literally as you want\nand what it says is: \"Liv, you're being divorced. You\nwant a divorce; your husband wants a divorce; you're\ngoing to be divorced. You cannot waive the benefit\nunder the plan.\" Now, why would Congress not want her\nto be able to waive it? Why?\nMR. LEVY: I don't think the issue -- I\nmean, a lot depends on the wording.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I can understand an anti-\nalienation provision. That's some guy who is going to\ncome along and grab this money when you want to take\ncare of a widow, and you want to take care -- but -- but\nthis isn't that. It's just -- she just wants to waive\nit; she doesn't want it. That's the widow herself.\nOkay, so why would Congress --\nMR. LEVY: Two things: One, we think that\npurpose does apply here. I mean, the point of\nanti-alienation provision is to guard against the\ntemptation to trade off future pension benefits in\nexchange for immediate economic gain or advantage.\nThat's exactly what Liv did in the divorce. She got the\nMercedes, she got other things. She traded off her\npension benefits, and we think that falls squarely\nwithin the purpose of the anti-alienation provision.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I see.\nMR. LEVY: That's the first and, I think,\nmost important answer.\nThe other thing is that we are not saying --\nour position today does not mean that divorcing parties\ncan -- can be foreclosed from eliminating the death\nbenefits -- the death benefits for the designated\nbeneficiary; but they have to follow procedures that\ncomply with ERISA. The most -- the most direct and\nsimplest one is the change of beneficiary form. William\ndidn't do that here. That's undisputed. They could\nhave entered into a QDRO, and that would have gone --\nthe money would have gone to Liv as an alternate payee.\nThat would have taken the benefits, consistent with\nERISA, away from Liv and given them to Kari. They could\nhave done that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why -- why do\nthey have to worry about that? The simplest thing is\nfor the participant to change the designation, and if\nthere's a divorce, the divorcee is no longer a spouse\nunder the terms of the plan, so he is free to do that.\nIt seems odd to me that they have this elaborate QDRO\nprovision when it shouldn't be necessary.\nMR. LEVY: It's not necessary. It's simply\nanother alternative, but I agree with you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, that the most direct and straightforward --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But another\nalternative is that all you can -- you can cross out\nthis name and put in another, or you can go to court,\nget this, qualify it as a QDRO, file it with the plan.\nI mean, why would anybody do that?\nMR. LEVY: They wouldn't have to.\nNow, let me turn to this issue about what is\nan assignment or alienation when we disagree with our\nfriends from the Solicitor General's Office. We think\nLiv's purported waiver here was an assignment or\nalienation within the IRS definition. The IRS\nregulation is reprinted at page 15 of the body of the\nred brief, and it provides that assignment or alienation\nis defined to include any direct or indirect arrangement\nwhereby a party acquires an interest from the\nbeneficiary. And I've left out the not -- the\nnot-critical language for present purposes. So it talks\nabout an indirect arrangement whereby a party acquires\nan interest from the beneficiary.\nNow, the government argues that that\ndefinition requires that the beneficiary, first, must\ndirect the transfer and, second, it must direct it to a\nthird party. The government's argument rests not on the\nlanguage of the regulation that I just read but on a\nlegal argument that this is what terms meant at common\nlaw. But that position simply can't be squared with the\nlanguage of the regulation. As I just said, the\nregulation includes an indirect arrangement within the\ndefinition of \"assignment or alienation.\"\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't -- isn't the\nproblem that it must be an indirect arrangement, and\nwhat you are arguing for here is an indirect effect.\nAnd it has that indirect effect on your reasoning\nbecause of the -- of the waiver and because of probate\nlaw. And it seems to me, as I read the -- the IRS reg,\nthe \"arrangement\" that it's referring to is an\narrangement which in and of itself would -- would effect\nthe transfer. And that is not the case here.\nMR. LEVY: Well, we think it is. The\narrangement here effected transfer to the estate under\nthe plan default rule. The estate was next in line. So\nif this is a relinquishment -- I don't want to use the\nword \"waiver.\" But if this is a relinquishment of her\ninterest, then it went to the estate.\nThat's what the plan provides, but it's not\njust the phrase \"indirect arrangement\" that we rely on,\nJustice Souter. It's also the phrase \"a party\nacquirer.\" It doesn't say a party acquirer at or by the\ndirection of the beneficiary. -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's -- that's the\npoint that troubles me. It's -- it's the \"acquirer's\"\nlanguage.\nDoes -- does the person who -- who receives\nthe -- the refused benefit acquire it from the other\nperson? He certainly doesn't do so for Federal tax\npurposes.\nMR. LEVY: Well, that's back to the\ndisclaimer, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The only person who\nacquires it -- the only entity that acquires it is the\nestate.\nMR. LEVY: Yes, that's right under the\ndefault rule. And if the default rule had a -- if the\nplan had a different default rule, under the default\nrule maybe it goes to the children.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does he acquire it from a\nparticipant or beneficiary?\nMR. LEVY: He acquires it from the\nbeneficiary list.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought the -- the notion\nis it's as though the -- it's as though the devise to\nthe person refusing it had never occurred. I mean,\nthere is -- there is no gift tax payable or anything\nelse.\nMR. LEVY: Well, there is no gift tax\npayable if it's a qualified disclaimer, and it won't be\nin a divorce case because there will be consideration\nand that prevents a qualified disclaimer. So that's a\ndifferent situation, but the word \"acquired\" doesn't\nmean --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You made the contention\nnow -- and I think you have it in your brief -- that if\nyou get something in return for a disclaimer, then the\ndisclaimer is not effected. That it's effected only if\nyou receive nothing in return. And what -- what is the\nsource of that contention that you can't disclaim if you\nget something in return?\nMR. LEVY: The -- it's -- under the Gift Tax\nCode Justice Ginsburg, section 2518 defines a qualified\ndisclaimer, which means you don't pay gift tax on it.\nIt's as if the interest had never been transferred. And\none of the conditions of that qualified disclaimer is\nthat the disclaimant not accept any interest or any of\nits benefits. So if there is consideration, if the\nperson is in a better position than they would have been\nbecause they received consideration, then it won't be a\nqualified disclaimer for gift tax purposes.\nBut there won't ever be a disqualified\ndisclaimer for that reason in a -- in the divorce\ncontext. It simply --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is the -- is the wife --\nI'm thinking of the Chief Justice's question, too. If\nyour -- the woman is Wife X, and her ex has a pension.\nDoesn't something vest there? She is in California.\nDoesn't she have some vested right to some of that\npension?\nMR. LEVY: In her own pension?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose she's married for\n40 years to Joe Smith, Joe Smith earns a pension and\nthen he wants a divorce. Doesn't she have some right to\nsome of that money.\nMR. LEVY: Well, I think under section 1055\nthere's a right to different annuities. That that was a\nnew provision in the Retirement Equity Act in 1984.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Does she get some of the\nmoney he saved?\nMR. LEVY: Yes, she's entitled to it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So it's not exactly that\nyou could have just changed the beneficiary. If you\njust changed the beneficiary, you'd have to give her\nsomething else.\nMR. LEVY: After the divorce she is not\nentitled. It's only a spouse who is entitled to the\nbenefits .\nJUSTICE BREYER: But in the divorce\nproceeding she's going to get some of the money, which\nis now just the inverse point, to which she is entitled.\nSo obviously she will get something, but she's entitled\nto it.\nMR. LEVY: Right, I think that's right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not, not obviously.\nI mean it depends what the divorce is. She got the\nMercedes, right? I mean, she can get -- it depends on\nthe divorce arrangement, not anything under ERISA, once\nshe is a nonspouse.\nMR. LEVY: Once she is a nonspouse she is no\nlonger entitled to those benefits under ERISA section\n1055.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Furlow, you have three minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY DAVID A. FURLOW\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. FURLOW: Thank you, Your Honor. Chief\nJustice Roberts, you were asking about the evidence\nearlier with respect to the possession in DuPont office\nown files of the divorce decree and of the notice that\nwas given saying: Please don't pay leave; she's already\nwaived all of her benefits. You will find that on page\n76 of the joint appendix in the sworn amended affidavit\nof Mary Dineen, the plan's administrator, specifically\nat paragraph 20, page 76, where she says in bold: \"Upon\nits receipt\" -- meaning the April 26, 2001, letter from\nKari Kennedy Duckworth -- \"Exhibit No. 1 was maintained\nas a record of DuPont with regard to the SIP account of\nWilliam Patrick Kennedy.\" That's joint appendix 76,\nparagraph 20. It was within the regular course of\nbusiness of DuPont to maintain a copy of this letter\nwith other DuPont letters relating to Mr. Kennedy's SIP\naccount at the time the letter was received from its\nsender. The letter is then attached as the next exhibit\nthat follows on. That would be about pages 78 to 79.\nAnd there it says the divorce decree was attached.\nMake no mistake: DuPont had that divorce\ndecree and could see the knowing, voluntary waiver and\nhad it well in advance of making its decision to pay\nmoney to a woman who went off to Norway and paid her\nwhen she was over there, where there was no prospect of\ngrabbing it back and turning it over to the executor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They look at it and\nsay, is this a QDRO? And if no, then they go back to\nthe other provision, I guess on page 21a in the red\nbrief, and say: If it's not a QDRO, ignore it.\nMR. FURLOW: Well, Your Honor, it's more\ninteresting than that, actually, in that if you look to\npage 68 of the joint appendix you'll see Mary Dineen,\nthe administrator, was saying, quote: \"Had Liv Kennedy\ndisclaimed her designation of the beneficiary of\nMr. Kennedy's SIP, that declination or disclaimer or a\ncopy would have been included in the beneficiary\ndesignation file.\" So they're taking disclaimers or\nwaivers. They're taking declinations, which is a fancy\nLatin way of saying waiver. They've got them in their\nfiles. They're acting on it. But here they decided to\npay the money to the person who has voluntarily waived,\nknowing the issue, not asking their in-house counsel at\nno cost to make an examination here. And why? So that\nthey can later take this plan documents rule and take it\nall the way to this court. But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was this waiver only part\nof the divorce degree? Do you agree with your friend on\nthat point?\nMR. FURLOW: Well, this waiver was the part\nin which Liv Kennedy waived all right so that he\nretained all of his --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's not separate and\napart from the divorce decree.\nMR. FURLOW: It was not separate and apart.\nIn fact, when they were transferring benefits they knew\nwhat to do and they used the waiver to transfer part of\nthe benefits.\nIt is interesting, Your Honors, that they\ntalked about the plan documents rule, but their own\ndocumentation says, their own plan says, that the only\nplan documents -- and I quoted it here on page 25 of our\nreply brief -- \"The official plan documents are the E.I.\nDuPont de Nemours & Company savings and investment plan\nand the trust agreement,\" not beneficiary designations.\nSo they give no notice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have anything\nmore to say on the plan document, the plan document\nissue than what you've said here.\nMR. FURLOW: Oh, I could come up with lots\nof things. That's a bad idea.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Thank you,\n"
