        "content": "(10:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nthis morning in case 06-856, LaRue v. DeWolff, Boberg &\nAssociates.\nMr. Stris.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER K. STRIS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. STRIS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nLet me begin with the first question on\nwhich this Court has granted certiorari. Sections\n502(a)(2) and 409 of ERISA permit restoration of \"any\nlosses to the plan.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What are the code numbers\nof those? I really get confused with you people who\nwork with ERISA all the time -- can refer, you know\nSection 3 of ERISA. I use the code. What -- what code\nsections are you talking about?\nMR. STRIS: I never thought the day would\ncome, Justice Scalia, when I was described as working\nwith ERISA all of the time, but I will tell you the code\nprovision. The code provision is -- for 502(a)(2) of\nERISA -- is 29 U.S.C. 1132(a)(2). It's found on page\n10a of the blue brief. Section 409 of ERISA is 29\nU.S.C. 1109, and I was quoting specifically from\n1109(a), and that is found on page 9a of the blue brief.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Thank you.\nMR. STRIS: Now, the statute plainly states\nthat \"any losses to the plan\" may be recovered if they\nwere caused by fiduciary breach. Our position on the\n(a)(2) question is straightforward. The plain meaning\nof \"any losses to the plan\" includes any diminution in\nvalue of defined contribution plan assets, regardless of\nthe number of participants ultimately affected.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the plan itself\nis nowhere in the record, is that right?\nMR. STRIS: Well, the summary plan\ndescription was attached to the complaint.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right, the summary.\nAnd I looked at the summary and saw nowhere the rules\nabout investment options, what you get to choose, how\noften -- and for all we know, the plan might say you\nhave no choice about investment options, it's all going\nto be invested in T-bills or whatever.\nMR. STRIS: Respectfully, Mr. Chief Justice,\nthat's not true. I would point your attention to page\n19a of the appendix to the brief in opposition. And\nthis is the page of the summary plan description that\nmakes clear that participants in the plan like Mr. LaRue\nwill have the opportunity to direct their investments.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that wasn't in the\nrecord.\nMR. STRIS: It is in the record.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is in the record.\nMR. STRIS: Yes. And to be clear, Justice\nScalia --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where in the record\nis it?\nMR. STRIS: It is page 19a of the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, that's in the\nopposition to certiorari, and I don't believe that's in\nthe record.\nMR. STRIS: It is in the record; it was\nattached to the complaint that was filed by Mr. LaRue in\nthis case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, that's the\nsummary of the plan.\nMR. STRIS: The summary plan description,\nthat's correct. And as you know, Mr. Chief Justice, if\nthere is a conflict between the summary plan description\nand the plan, the summary plan description governs; it's\na legitimate document.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The summary on the\npage you mentioned says that you will be able to -- you\nhave certain investment choices are available to you,\nand that the administrator will provide you with\ninformation on what they are and how you can change it.\nMR. STRIS: That is correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But we don't know\nthose details, correct?\nMR. STRIS: That's true, but this case was\ndecided at the pleading stage. And so to be clear, we\nalleged that the right given to Mr. LaRue under the plan\nwas violated. If true, then that would constitute a\nfiduciary breach.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It would also\npresumably more obviously constitute a breach of the\nplan, correct?\nMR. STRIS: Yes, that's correct; and that is\na fiduciary breach. Under 404 (a)(1)(D), failure to act\nin accordance with the terms of the plan is a classic\nexample of breach of fiduciary duty.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your position is\nanything that is remediable, if that's a word, under\n(a)(1) can also be pursued under (a)(2)?\nMR. STRIS: No, that is not my position. My\nposition --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let me step back.\nDo you agree that you could bring an action under (a)(1)\nfor this breach of the plan?\nMR. STRIS: I think that's far from clear,\nbut what is clear is that we could not recover what we\nwanted under (a)(1). (a)(1) only permits a lawsuit\nagainst the plan. Here the plan doesn't have the funds\nthat are relevant.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where does it say that\n(a)(1) is available only against the plan?\nMR. STRIS: The specific language of (a)(1)\ndoesn't state that. It states that you can get benefits\ndue under the plan, or you can enforce your rights under\nthe plan. I'm not aware of a single case, Justice\nGinsburg, where an (a)(1)(B) action has been permitted\nto recover personally from a fiduciary. That is the\npurpose of (a)(2), which specifically states that you\ncan personally recover from a fiduciary.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's fine, so why doesn't\nhe proceed first under (a)(1)(B), against the plan?\nMR. STRIS: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Because the plan owes him\nthis money. And if the plan turns around and says well,\nyou know the fiduciary didn't invest your funds the way\nit was supposed to, the plan still owes him the money,\ndoesn't it?\nMR. STRIS: I think the answer to that -- I\nthink there are two reasons why that's incorrect. And\nthe first reason is 502 (a)(2), unlike 502(a)(3), is not\na catchall provision, so if he has a remedy under\n502(a)(2) --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm talking about\n(a)(1)(B).\nMR. STRIS: Right. And it is -- there is\nnothing to suggest that that provision is mutually\nexclusive with another provision. So my first response\nto your question, Justice Scalia, is that even if he\ncould have proceeded under (a)(1)(B), there is nothing\nto suggest that he had to, if he wanted to proceed under\nthe express terms of (a)(2).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, there is -- there is\nthis to suggest that only -- only that manner of\nproceeding preserves the structure of -- of the\nlegislation which is that you're supposed to first apply\nto the plan and exhaust your remedies there before you\ncome into court; and interpreting it that way would\npreserve that -- that exhaustion requirement. You have\nto apply to the plan first, and if you establish that\nthe plan owes you money, then it's a loss to the plan\nand you can sue in court.\nMR. STRIS: Well, what I would say to that,\nJustice Scalia, and is that this administrative\nexhaustion requirement that you're referring to is a\njudicial gloss on the statute. I find it hard to\nbelieve that the express terms of (a)(2), which the\nplain language authorizes restoration to the plan of any\nlosses to the plan for any breach of duty --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your approach, if\ncan you go under (a)(2) -- you're right that we\njudicially have developed a number of glosses on (a)(1),\nincluding I think most importantly the Firestone\ndeference principle. But if you're right that you can\ngo under (a)(2), then all of that work has been in vain.\nYou can avoid all the limitations on (a)(1) just by\nsaying we want the same relief under (a)(2).\nMR. STRIS: I would not agree with that\ncharacterization because there are very few cases where\nthe specific conditions for (a)(2) are met. You would\nneed to prove a loss to the plan. In welfare plan\ncases, for example, you would not be able to proceed\nunder (a)(2) because you would never be able to show\nthat the fiduciary breach caused a loss to the plan.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You told me earlier\nthat any breach of the plan was a fiduciary duty.\nMR. STRIS: That's correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now you're -- the --\nwhat is it -- the obverse or the converse of that you're\nsaying is not true.\nMR. STRIS: No, that's not true. There are\ntwo requirements for an (a)(2) action. One is that\nthere be a fiduciary breach. That's what you just spoke\nto when you referred to a breach of the term of the\nplan. But there's a second important requirement which\ngoes to the heart of why (a)(2) is what it is. There\nmust be a loss to the plan. This Court recognizes --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you whether the\n(a)(2) argument would be available to you on remand even\nif we agree with your interpretation of that provision?\nDidn't Judge Wilkinson say pretty clearly that the\nargument had been waived? He said, \"even if the\nargument were not therefore waived.\" Doesn't that mean\nthat it was waived?\nMR. STRIS: I don't read the Fourth\nCircuit's decision that way. I read it as -- as dicta,\nnot an alternative holding. And to be clear, the\nRespondents concede that point on page 5 of their brief\nin opposition, and I quote. They state: \"After\nsuggesting this claim may have been waived\" and then\nthey proceed. So even Respondent agrees that it was\nmerely dicta --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, maybe -- maybe they've\nwaived the waiver, but Judge Wilkinson is a careful\nwriter, and if you use the subjunctive there -- \"even if\nthe argument were not therefore waived\" -- doesn't that\nmean it was in fact waived?\nMR. STRIS: Not in my opinion, but that's an\nissue that the Fourth Circuit and the lower courts will\nneed to resolve. If they interpret their opinion as\nhaving held that, certainly we would be precluded. I\ndon't think that that is what they held, and I think we\nhave a very strong argument that we pled a 502(a)(2)\nclaim as required under the Federal rules.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let me come back to your\nearlier point that the second requirement of (a)(2) --\nit's actually a requirement of 1109 --\nMR. STRIS: That's correct. Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- is not met. And that is\n-- that is to -- to make good to such plan any losses to\nthe plan resulting from each such breach. In these\nwelfare plans, if you sue the plan, claiming some\nwelfare benefits that haven't been provided, wouldn't\nthe plan have to provide those benefits?\nMR. STRIS: Yes. That is a classic action\nunder (a)(1)(B), Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that would be a loss to\nthe plan.\nMR. STRIS: No. I don't agree with that\ncharacterization. In a defined benefit plan of which a\nwelfare plan is the classic example --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. STRIS: -- there are no assets that you\nhave an entitlement to as a beneficiary.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I have an entitlement to\ncertain -- certain welfare payments.\nMR. STRIS: That's -- you have entitlement\nto a contractually provided benefit. So, if there is a\nfiduciary breach in terms of the administrator stating,\n\"We're not going to give you this cancer treatment that\nreally was provided under plan\" --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. STRIS: Or, \"we're not going to give you\nthis drug\" --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. STRIS: -- that breach doesn't cause any\ndiminution in value in plan assets.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It does if you sue the plan\nand require the plan to pay what the plan has committed\nto pay, whereupon the plan would have a right of action\nagainst the fiduciary, I assume, for the fiduciary's\nfailure to do what he was supposed to.\nMR. STRIS: Well, that may be true, but with\nrespect, I think that that is -- that's the tail wagging\nthe dog. The argument that you made is that a loss\noccurs if your fiduciary duty claim is successful.\nThat's another statute. That's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but that would\npreserve the necessity of going through the exhaustion\nrequirement first. You apply to the plan and say the\nplan owes me this cancer treatment, and the plan says\n\"yes, we do\" or \"no, we don't.\" If it says \"yes, we\ndo,\" it's liable to you and then the plan can -- can\nrecover over against the trustee.\nMR. STRIS: Let me take a step back because\nI think we are 100 percent in agreement, but I want to\nbe clear what our position is. Under the factual\nscenario that you described, I agree with you 100\npercent that you would need to proceed under (a)(1)(B),\nbecause you would be requesting a benefit that you are\nentitled to under the plan.\nIn this case, the only benefit that you are\nentitled to, if you are a participant in an individual\naccount plan, is the value of the contributions that\nyou've put or your employer has put into the account, as\nthey have either appreciated or depreciated. So my\nfirst response -- it's actually the second response I\nwas going to give earlier that I never got to is that I\nbelieve that it's not clear that there is even a\nlegitimate (a)(1)(B) claim that Mr. LaRue could have\nasserted here because --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it isn't just if the\nmoney is payable to him today. It says, \"to enforce his\nrights under the terms or to clarify his rights to\nfuture benefits under the terms of the plan.\"\nMR. STRIS: That is correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And if there's no money in\nhis account, it seems to me he could bring an action to\nclarify that even if there is no money in his account\nthe plan owes him future benefits in that amount.\nMR. STRIS: And then one of two things at\nthat point would happen, Justice Scalia. Either he\nwould get paid by the plan, which would pick the pockets\nof the other participants and require the plan to then\nbring an action under (a)(2) --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. STRIS: -- which is perfectly\nlegitimate, but my response to that is there is no\nlanguage in the statute to suggest that that is\nrequired. If he has an action to do that directly under\n(a)(2), there's no language in the statute to suggest\nthat he need bring an (a)(1) action first and require\nthe plan to then proceed under (a)(2).\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- I'm not sure\nabout your characterization that he would pick the\npockets of the other plan participants. By definition\nhe only prevails if this was a benefit to which he was\nentitled under the plan. So that doesn't seem unfair to\nthe other plan participants.\nMR. STRIS: Well, a defined contribution\nplan is nothing more than a collection of assets that\nhave been allocated to a group of participants. So, if\nthose assets are depleted through fiduciary breach,\nwhich is what occurred here, and you bring a claim\nsaying that your interest in the plan was depleted, if\nyou brought that claim against the plan, the plan no\nlonger has the money. So either they can pay you --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it may or may\nnot have the money. You could have failed to follow his\ninstructions in a way that enriched the plan, and it's\nsimply a question of getting that money properly\nallocated rather than improperly allocated to the other\nplan participants who are picking the pocket of your\nclient.\nMR. STRIS: Well, I think under the example\nthat you just gave, Mr. Chief Justice, there would not\nbe a loss to the plan.\nOur fundamental argument about the plain\ntext of this statute is that a loss to the plan is a\ndiminution in plan assets. If I'm a participant in a\nplan, and the administrator doesn't like me and takes my\nmoney and allocates it, just because they feel like it,\nto another participant in the plan, it is not our\nposition that there would be a claim under (a)(2)\nbecause there has been no diminution in plan assets.\nOne would need to proceed under (a)(3).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the plan wouldn't\nnecessarily pay out any money. What would happen is,\nafter the administrative determination by the plan that\nit does owe the money, he would sue the plan for the\nmoney and the plan would implead the trustee who was\nresponsible for this. It ends up the same way.\nMR. STRIS: Well, I would say two things\nabout that. First, it may end up the same way depending\non how the facts play out, which is the perfect evidence\nfor my point, which is 502(a)(3) of ERISA has been\ninterpreted as a catchall provision. 502(a)(2) is\nanything but. It sets forth very specific conditions\nand very specific relief that is available if those\nconditions are met. There is nothing to suggest that\nthe availability of a potential remedy under (a)(1)\nprecludes a remedy under (a)(2).\nNow, my second response, Justice Scalia, is\nthat depending on how the facts play out, the result may\nnot be as you suggest. The plan may choose not to go\nafter the fiduciary, and if that's the case, all -- at\nmost my client could get is a declaration under (a)(1)\nthat doesn't ultimately get him any money.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What would happen if the\ntrustee does not have the money? The trustee not only\nsquandered your client's money; he squandered his own.\nHe's just really in bad shape. He has no money to cough\nup. What happens to your client? Doesn't your client\nget that money from the plan anyway?\nMR. STRIS: I think that that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: By picking, as you put it,\nby picking the pockets of the other plan participants?\nMR. STRIS: I think in an individual account\nplan, that presents a very difficult question.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's the answer to it?\nMR. STRIS: I think probably he would not be\nable to recover that money. I think that money would be\nlost and he would have no remedy because, at that point\nin time, someone is going to lose. Either my client is\nnot going to recover money that he is entitled to or\nother participants in the plan are going to have money\ntaken away from them.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They participated in the\nplan. It was a failure of the trustee for the plan. It\nseems to me the whole plan should be liable for it. I\nmean that's how I --\nMR. STRIS: I don't think there's any\nevidence for that. ERISA imposes a duty of loyalty to\nall plan participants. If they breach a fiduciary duty\nwhich causes a diminution in plan assets that ultimately\nwill affect only one participant, there is -- it goes\nagainst the very core of ERISA to say that they can\nremedy that by taking money from innocent fellow\nparticipants. And that really goes to the core of the\ndifference between an (a)(2) claim and an (a)(3) claim\non one hand, and an (a)(1) claim on the other hand.\nOne thing is clear here. Whether or not\nMr. LaRue could have brought an (a)(1)(B) claim, it\nwould not under any circumstances have resulted in\ngetting money from the fiduciary back into the plan.\nAbsent money being returned to the plan, there can be no\nmeaningful remedy for the breach that occurred.\nSo it returns us to the core question in\nthis case, which is were the terms of (a)(2) satisfied?\nNow, the court of appeals basically advanced\ntwo arguments as to why the plain text of the statute\nshould be ignored. The primary argument was a\nfundamental misinterpretation of this Court's opinion in\nRussell. So I'd like to speak about that.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If we agree to you on\n(a)(2), is there any need to get to (a)(3)?\nMR. STRIS: Certainly if you agree with us\non (a)(2), the court of appeals can be reversed on that\nissue. We ask that you also reach the (a)(3) question,\nbecause this case was decided at the pleading stage.\nAlthough it may be unlikely, there are two\nreasons why we might need to avail ourselves of (a)(3)\non remand. The first is that facts could develop. I\ndon't have any reason to believe they will, but facts\ncould develop where there is a loss to Mr. LaRue's\nbeneficial interest but not a loss to the plan. In\nother words, they took his money and they gave it to\nsomeone else.\nWe should be able to plead, if we have a\ncognizable claim under two statutes, both of them and\nthen discover the relevant facts.\nThe second reason why you should reach the\n(a)(3) question is additional relief may be available\nunder (a)(3) that is not available under (a)(2).\nJUSTICE ALITO: What would that be?\nMR. STRIS: Well, our theory of surcharge,\nand it's also the government's theory, is that surcharge\nis a make-whole remedy for pecuniary losses that are\ncaused by a breach of trust. It is clear that the core\nlosses are diminution in trust assets or failure of\ntrust assets to appreciate. But there are individual\npecuniary losses that were historically remediable under\nsurcharge.\nFor example, if you paid out of pocket for\nan auditor to figure out what the extent of a fiduciary\nbreach was, a premerger court of equity would not only\nsurcharge your harm, the harm to your interest in the\ntrust, but they also would return to you the money that\nyou spent for that audit.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought your own\nargument was that (a)(3) is the catchall. So if (a)(2),\nwhich is described as very precise, if that's\napplicable, you would not get to (a)(3). You would be\nasking us at this point to assume that somehow the\n(a)(2) case folds, and then we flip over into (a)(3).\nBut why should we get there prematurely? It\nseems to me if it's right that (a)(2) comes before\n(a)(3), it isn't -- it's not quite a ripeness issue, but\nit's close to that.\nMR. STRIS: Well, the Court certainly may\nchoose not to reach the (a)(3) issue, so I can't speak\nto that. But what I can say is that the dicta in Varity\nthat describes (a)(3) as a catchall provision -- it is\nclear that at the end of the day if the release is\ncoterminous under the two provisions, it would not be\nappropriate for us to proceed under (a)(3).\nBut that is not a pleading question. My\nposition as to why you should reach (a)(3) is if we have\na cognizable theory under (a)(2) and (a)(3), and we\nbelieve we do, we shouldn't be required to choose at\nthis point in time if, as the litigation proceeds, it\nturns out that the relief we would be entitled to is\ncoterminous, then we concede it would not be appropriate\nto proceed under (a)(3).\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Stris.\nMr. Roberts.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE\nSUPPORTING PETITIONER\nMR. ROBERTS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nERISA authorizes a participant in a defined\ncontribution plan to sue to recover losses to the plan\ncaused by a fiduciary breach even if the losses are\nattributable to the participant's individual plan\naccount.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that means every\nparticipant, right? In other words, for the failure of\nthe plan to follow this individual's instructions, any\nparticipant in the plan can bring suit under (a)(2)?\nMR. ROBERTS: It's -- that's theoretically\npossible because the loss to the -- loss to this\nindividual account is a loss to the plan. Although it's\nunlikely that a participant that has no -- that is --\nwhose own benefits are not going to be affected has much\nincentive to sue, and it's also possible that a court\nmight conclude if such a participant did bring suit,\nthat such a suit shouldn't proceed under prudential\nstanding principles or because the suit wouldn't be\nappropriate, but here --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Wouldn't the theory be that\nif ultimately the other accounts could be robbed to sort\nof make up for at least part of the loss of this one,\nthat for a loss to any account is a threat to all the\nothers?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, we agree that a loss to\nany account is a threat to the plan as a whole, but I\nthink for a different reason. We don't think that you\ncould rob the other accounts to pay this -- this\nparticipant. That would likely violate the fiduciary's\nduty of loyalty to those participants, the fiduciary\nduty of prudence under -- under ERISA.\nIt would also probably violate the terms of\nthe plan, because they have a right to future benefits\nby the amount that's in their allocation but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Roberts, Section (a),\n(a)(1)(B) --\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Unlike Section (a)(2),\nwhich refers you to 1109, does not say who gets sued.\nUnder 1109 it's clear who gets sued. It's the fiduciary\nwho gets sued. I find it very curious that (a)(1)(B)\njust says a civil action may be brought to recover\nbenefits due to him under the terms of his plans or to\nclarify his right under the terms of the plan.\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think the implication\nthere is that the suit -- the suit is against the plan.\nMR. ROBERTS: The implication is that the\nsuit is against the plan or against a fiduciary in --\nunder (a)(1)(B). Against the plan or against the\nfiduciary whose initial capacity is representative of\nthe plan.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where?\nMR. ROBERTS: If you can't sue the fiduciary\nunder (a)(1)(B), that just reinforces the point even --\neven more, Your Honor, that Petitioner's cause of action\nhere arises under (a)(2) because he is seeking relief\nfor the plan not relief from the plan.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It may well. But I'm just\ntalking right now of (a)(1)(B), and it would seem to me\nthat the logical reading of that is that the suit is\nagainst the plan.\nMR. ROBERTS: Under (a)(1)(B), most courts\nrequire that the suit be brought against the plan. I\nthink the suit in certain circumstances could be brought\nagainst the fiduciary to require the fiduciary to take\naction that is required by the terms of the plan such as\nif you fought against the fiduciary to pay benefits out.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do we know that\nthis is a breach of fiduciary duty under (a)(2) without\nhaving the plan before us? In other words, it may not\nbe a fiduciary obligation to follow an instruction from\nsomebody if the plan provides a different way in which\nthose instructions are going to be handled.\nI'd say, as I think a lot of these plans do,\nyou can change your investment options only during a\nparticular period. Well, if the instruction came at a\ndifferent time, it wouldn't be a breach of fiduciary\nduties because it wasn't a breach of the plan.\nMR. ROBERTS: And if it's not a breach of\nfiduciary duties, Petitioner will lose on the merits or\non remand in their motion for summary judgment based on\nfacts that could be decided.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I thought his\nargument -- his argument reduces to the fact that it's a\nbreach of fiduciary duty because it's a breach of the\nplan. But if not a breach of the plan, then it's not a\nbreach --\nMR. ROBERTS: It's a breach of fiduciary\nduty both of a failure to follow the terms of the plan\nand a breach of the duty of prudence, because when a\nplan provides that participants can direct their\ninvestments --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we need to know\n-- we need to know what the plan provides before we can\ndecide.\nMR. ROBERTS: The case was dismissed on the\npleadings, Your Honor, and it alleges that there was a\nbreach of fiduciary duty. And Respondent hasn't\ndisputed, in fact, that the plan requires\nparticipants -- allows participants direct, in fact --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The pleadings don't\ninclude the plan. So we have to assess the pleadings\nwithout the terms of the plan.\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes, but the inferences\nshouldn't be construed against the plaintiff in motion\nto dismiss on the pleadings, Your Honor.\nIn addition to that, Respondent's answer --\nthis is on page 2a of the red brief -- admitted that\nparticipants in the DeWolff plan are permitted to direct\nthe investment of their contributions to the plan.\nThat's in paragraph eight on page 2a.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But we don't know\nunder what terms. I mean I've seen plans where you are\nentitled to direct, but that's subject to conditions and\nlimitations.\nMR. ROBERTS: That's certainly true, Your\nHonor. But here, the court of appeals assumed that\nthere was a fiduciary breach. That's on page 3a in the\nstar footnote of the -- it's the appendix to the\npetition for certiorari. There is no reason for this\nCourt to second-guess that, particularly since\nRespondent didn't argue in its motion to dismiss that\nthere was no fiduciary breach here. So the case comes\nto the Court on the assumption that there is a fiduciary\nbreach. And these are very important questions\nconcerning whether assuming there is a fiduciary breach,\na participant in a defined contribution plan can sue to\nrecover for the plan the losses to the plan that are\ncaused by that breach when the losses are attributable\nonly to that individual's account.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Roberts, would you\nclarify what the government's position is on this\n(a)(1)(B) argument? Are you saying it is available, but\n(a)(2) is available?\nMR. ROBERTS: We don't think that there is a\nclaim at this point under (a)(1)(B), because the -- the\nmoney the Petitioner seeks -- what's happened here is he\nhas alleged that there has been a fiduciary breach that\ncaused a loss to the plan. The appropriate remedy for\nthat is a recovery from the fiduciary in its personal\ncapacity to put the money back in the plan. That's what\nsection 502(a)(2) provides. Once the money is back in\nthe plan and then it's allocated pursuant to the duty of\nprudence to the Petitioner's account, then if the plan\ndidn't pay out the money to him when he was entitled to\nit, which he appears to be entitled to it now since he\nhas withdrawn his account balance, he would have a 502\n(a)(2) claim -- a 502(a)(1)(B) claim, excuse me -- but\nhe doesn't have a claim under that provision now. We --\nat least we think it's very unlikely that he does,\nbecause generally plans provide that the benefits that\nare owed to people are the money that are in -- in the\naccount.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, now we know what\nbenefits would be due because he has withdrawn, but when\nhe made this complaint and he hadn't been withdrawn, he\ncould have made an unwise investment the next time. And\n--\nMR. ROBERTS: That's right, and then he\nwould -- it would be even clearer, I think that he has\nno (a)(1)(B) claim, if he didn't have -- say he was\nstill participating in the plan and he wasn't -- he\nhadn't withdrawn his account balance and didn't have a\nright to withdraw his account balance at that time, then\nhe wouldn't have a right to any benefits from the plan.\nThe crux of the matter here is that the plan\nhas suffered a loss and that the appropriate remedy is\nagainst the fiduciary in his personal capacity;\n(a)(1)(B) doesn't provide for suits against the\nfiduciary in his personal capacity to recover money for\nthe plan. It provides, again, suits against the plan to\npay money out of the plan. This money isn't in the\nplan; it can't paid from the accounts of other\nparticipants because it would breach these duties under\nERISA. The appropriate remedy is to get the money back\nin the plan.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you agree that if\nit is within (a)(1)(B) that it's therefore not within\n(a)(2)?\nMR. ROBERTS: No, because (a)(1)(B) provides\nan action for benefits from the plan and (a)(2) provides\nan action against -- it's a different -- against a\ndifferent defendant for a different kind of claim.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought your\nanswer would be yes. In other words, if it's in (a)(1),\nit's not in (a)(2).\nMR. ROBERTS: If it's a claim for benefits\nunder (a)(1) or to enforce the terms of the plan, such\nas if the fiduciary says, \"I'm just not going to follow\nyour instruction,\" and the participant wants a\nclarification of that and an order compelling the\nfiduciary in his official capacity to do that, yes, that\nwould be a suit under (a)(1)(B) and there would be no\nsuit under (a)(2).\nThere's only a suit under (a)(2) if there\nare losses to the plan and if the remedy is to put the\nmoney back in the plan by getting it from the breaching\nfiduciary.\nIf I could turn to (a)(3) just very briefly,\nYour Honor. We think that suits against fiduciaries to\nrecover losses by fiduciary breaches are also authorized\nby section 502(a)(3), which provides for appropriate\naction, I believe.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that 1132 we are talking\nabout?\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes, that's 1132(a)(3).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of the United States Code.\nMR. ROBERTS: Of the United States Code, 29\nU.S.C. 1132.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's useful to have a code.\nIt really is.\nMR. ROBERTS: Okay. I apologize. That --\nthat provision -- my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can finish your\nsentence.\nMR. ROBERTS: That provision provides for\nappropriate equitable relief, and a suit against a\nfiduciary to recover losses caused by a breach of\nfiduciary duty seeks equitable relief because it's\nanalogous to an action for breach of trust seeking the\nequitable remedy of surcharge.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Roberts.\nMr. Gies.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS P. GIES\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMR. GIES: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nPetitioner in our view suggests an awkward\nreading of Section 409, one that is particularly hard to\nreconcile with the structure of the civil enforcement\nprovisions of Section %02, 1132 of the U.S. Code,\nstarting of course with Section (a)(1)(B).\nTo us this is the opposite end of the\nspectrum of the kind of case the Court was talking about\nin Russell and what Russell has been assumed to have\nbeen meant --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Russell was about a\nwelfare plan, not a pension -- and as I recall, the\nplaintiff in Russell was seeking medical benefits that\nshe didn't get and she wanted, not the benefits because\nshe did get those, she wanted straight out damages,\ncompensatory and punitive damages, for delay in the\nreceipt of benefits. That's quite a different thing\nfrom saying I want the contributions made so that I will\nget the benefits to which I'm entitled.\nMR. GIES: You're right, Your Honor, that\nthat is certainly distinguishable on the facts. We\nthink the central teaching of Russell, though, applies\nwith equal force to a defined contribution case like\nthis, for several reasons.\nThe first of which is that Russell has been\nassumed to reflect the dicing that we are talking about\nwhich provision in Section 502 is appropriate.\nIndividual claims have traditionally been brought either\nunder (a)(1)(B) or under (a)(3). When a claim is being\nbrought on behalf of the plan as a whole, Russell\nteaches and -- and helps define when those claims are\navailable. It is an odd case here, where the plan is a\ndefendant, to at the same time assert that this claim is\nbeing brought on behalf of the plan.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that is an oddity but\nwhat do you say to Mr. Roberts' argument that the only\nrecovery under (a)(1)(B) is against the plan, and the\nplan doesn't have the money in the account so that if\nthere is going to be any relief it's got to come from\nthe fiduciary and that gets you into (2).\nMR. GIES: Well, because neither (a)(2) or\n(a)(1)(B) were invoked in the district court and the\ncase comes up on a very spares record, it's hard to --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but we've got to\nassume at this point that we've -- we've got a -- a\nSection (2) claim before us and the argument simply is,\nis that in effect to be disallowed because it should\nhave been an (a)(1)(B) claim? And the argument that the\nUnited States has made, the argument that the other side\nhas made is, we cannot get to any money under (a)(1)(B).\nWe've got to get that from the fiduciary and we can only\ndo that under (2).\nMR. GIES: The difference between defined\ncontribution plans and defined benefit plans in ERISA is\nan important consideration in answering that question.\n(a)(1)(B), the first clause, speaks of recovering\nbenefits due to him. As you know from our briefs we\nargue this is a case for lost profits, not benefits,\ncertainly not vested benefits in the way the Court used\nthe term in Firestone.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So then you would agree\nthat (a)(1)(B) is not available?\nMR. GIES: No, Your Honor. We believe that\n(a)(1)(B) definitely was available for the Petitioner\nhere. What relief he might have recovered under\n(a)(1)(B) had he invoked that provision remains to --\nwould have remained to have been seen had it been\ninvoked. There are three --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the argument of the\nUnited States is you can't rob Peter to pay Paul, so\nthat if in fact his account didn't have the money, the\nplan didn't have any place to get the money, and the\nonly way the money could be had would have been from a\nfiduciary, which again gets you to subsection (2).\nMR. GIES: It would only get you into\nsubsection (2) if it could be argued that that claim was\nfor the benefit of the plan as a whole, as this Court\nhas taught in Russell; and it seems to me, Your Honor,\nthat one way to think about this in terms of which\nprovision applies to which of these claims, is whether\nCongress really intended for these individual kinds of\n\"he said; she said\" claims to be brought. We think not.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But it seems to me\nyou're answering a different question in that response.\nThe argument here is basically an argument between the\npossibility -- an argument based on the claim that under\n(a)(1)(B) you can't go against the fiduciary. The only\nway you can get the money is from a fiduciary and\ntherefore (a)(1)(B) would have been of no value to you.\nDo you -- do you take issue with that premise?\nMR. GIES: Well we think -- no. No, Your\nHonor. In general we do not take issue with that\npremise.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, then doesn't that\nleave you in the position of having to say that you've\neither got to bring the claim under (a)(1)(B), or you've\ngot -- subsection (2) -- or you've got to bring it under\nsubsection (3)?\nMR. GIES: We think not for this reason.\nThe second clause of (a)(1)(B) permits a cause of action\nto enforce his rights under the terms of the plan. This\nis a case that if you give the Petitioner full benefit\nof the doubt probably could have been resolved with a\ntelephone call. (a)(1)(B) permits an action to enforce\nhis rights under the terms of the plan.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And the answer, if the\npremise you have just agreed to is correct, will be,\n\"you bet. He is entitled to have another $150,000 in\nhis account for the benefit of future payments to him.\"\nMR. GIES: Well, we think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: \"But we haven't got the\nmoney and we can't rob Peter to pay Paul and therefore\nwe are very sorry, go away.\" That would necessarily be\nthe answer.\nMR. GIES: Well, we think not with respect,\nJustice Souter, for this reason. Keep in mind the\ntheory here is one for lost appreciation in the account.\nThis plan does not have pooled assets.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that's going to the --\nit seems to -- with respect, I think that's going to the\nmerits. And the question is, if you can recover against\nanybody, the claim is, the argument is you're going to\nget nowhere under (a)(1)(B) because the plan can't help\nyou by itself. The only way you can get any value from\nyour lawsuit is by going against the fiduciary. Maybe\nyou have good reasons to defend that, but if you're\ngoing to have a suit against anyone, it's got to be\nunder subsection (2).\nMR. GIES: I think the answer to that,\nJustice Souter, is that it reflects how careful and\ninterrelated these provisions in 502 are.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And they're saying they are\ncareful and interrelated provisions mean that you got to\ngo under subsection (2).\nMR. GIES: To which we say --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And you're I think saying,\nwe -- we agree with you that ultimately (1)(B) couldn't\nget you any relief because the fiduciary -- the plan\ndoesn't have any money. And you're now arguing, well,\nif you go against the fiduciary, ultimately we have a\ngood defense to that. But the fact is, the question\nbefore us is whom do you sue and under what -- under\nwhat section? And I think your own logic forces you to\nsay that -- that has got to be subsection (2).\nMR. GIES: Well, one more answer to your\nquestion about (a)(1)(B), Justice Souter, is this: As\nyou know, ERISA is a statute that provides for limited\nremedies, and the question of what remedies might be\navailable under (a)(1) and whether or not this defendant\nwould be solvent or somebody else would have to be\nimpleaded in our view need not be decided in this case.\nWe think it's sufficient to identify that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it hasn't been\nreached yet, has it?\nMR. GIES: -- as another remedy that could\nhave been pursued here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If there is a suit\nunder (a)(1)(B) for a breach of the plan by a fiduciary,\ndo you agree that the plan, if it's liable, could then\nsue the fiduciary? I realize I'm talking about a suit\nby one of your clients against the other, but would that\nbe a feasible result under the statute?\nMR. GIES: Yes, it is, and it's also\npossible depending on the facts. And again, from this\nsparse record, it's hard to know that there could be an\naction filed against whoever it was who is alleged to\nhave made the mistake. One of the issues, of course, in\nthis case is it's not clear who made the mistake or\nwhether or not the mistake was in fact a breach of\nfiduciary duty.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is it entirely clear that\nthe plan itself does not have any money to pay this off\nunless it takes the money from other individual\naccounts? I thought one of the briefs said that -- that\nsome plans have independent funds. I forget what\nsources they came from, but some slush fund that they\ncould use for this purpose.\nMR. GIES: What you're talking about I\nthink, Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It wasn't called a slush\nfund. I know that.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GIES: -- was a plan that provides for\npool of assets. This plan does not. And so the answer\nto your question is no, there is no other place to get\nthe money from, which we think is another reason why\nthis is not on appropriate claim under (a)(2). It is\nnot losses to the plan in the conventional way we\nunderstand those words. But the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But what is the plan\nother than a collection of individual -- I mean the\ntrustee is the trustee for the plan. All of the assets\nare there. The individuals do not have them in their\npockets. So the trustee is managing this fund, which is\nthen segmented into accounts for each individual. So I\nthink your -- your suggestion is that these defined\ncontribution plans, they come out entirely because --\nbecause of the segmented accounts. So you could never\nbring a claim because it would always be an individual.\nMR. GIES: Well, we think that (a)(2),\nproperly read, does not permit an individual claim.\n(a)(3) permits a claim for equitable relief, and\n(a)(1)(B) would permit a claim for benefits for the\nother two.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why? Why? That's\nthe question, it seems to me, in the case. Why? I mean\n-- imaginary example -- a plan, a thousand members. The\ntrustee invests in a thousand diamonds. He puts it in a\nbank deposit vault. One day he takes all 500 diamonds\nand runs off to Martinique. We catch him enjoying the\nsun. We can sue him under (2), right? That's what (2)\nis there for, right? Right. Okay. Now, everything is\nthe same except each of the thousand diamonds was put in\nindividual safe deposit box with the participant's name\non it. Everything else is the same. Why should it\nmatter?\nMR. GIES: We think relief in that\nsituation, including recovery of the diamonds and any\nprofits associated with it, would be available under\n(a)(3).\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'm sorry. I'm not\ninterested in that question. I'm interested in my\nquestion. Why isn't it available under (a)(2)? In both\ncases, the trustee took 500 diamonds that belonged to\nthe plan and went to Martinique. Now, if you can sue\nhim when the plans are all put in one big safe deposit\nbox with the diamonds, why can't you sue him when\nthey're put in 500 small safe deposit boxes?\nMR. GIES: I think the structure of defined\ncontribution plans makes that a little inapt of an\nanalogy, with respect, Justice Breyer. In this plan, as\nwe know, the assets are not pooled. It is, of course,\nthe sum and total of the individual plan accounts, but\nthe question of legal ownership is different from the\nquestion of whether or not in this case it ought to be\nread as losses to the plan. Here it is by definition\nthe most individual kind of claim that anybody could\nthink about. It is a run of the mill, as alleged claim\nbetween an investor and a stockbroker essentially that\nthe stockbroker did not execute the trade.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But do you dispute that\nthere was not -- that there was a loss to the plan in\nthe literal sense?\nMR. GIES: Yes, we do. For --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If --\nMR. GIES: For two reasons, first of all,\nthere was no distribution until after he cashed out and,\nsecond, the nature of this claim, again, is for lost\nprofits. It is not for benefits as in the sense of a\ndefined benefit plan.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But if you accept the truth\nof his allegations, wouldn't the plan have greater\nassets than it had?\nMR. GIES: No. Because there's no way to\nimagine that anybody made out on this. This is a case\nwhere the investment instruction was not followed.\nThere's no way to imagine that my clients made any money\non that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you're arguing that\nultimately he couldn't prove damages. We're talking\nabout allegations at the pleading stage.\nLet me ask you a slightly different\nquestion. You said there's no -- there's no, as Justice\nScalia put it, there's no slush fund; there's no pooled\nassets here. All the assets are assets which are\naccounted for, attributable to, individual accounts.\nTherefore there can be no -- there can be no loss to the\nplan which is not a loss to an individual account, can\nthere be?\nMR. GIES: Yes, sir. That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then what is your theory on\nhow we determine whether a loss to the plan from an\nindividual account suffices as a loss to the plan for\npurposes of pleading? Has it got to be, you know, 500\nlosses out of 1000? I don't see why that should make a\ndifference. I'm going back to Justice Breyer's\nquestion.\nMR. GIES: Yes, I don't think the actual\nnumber makes any difference, but I think the nature of\nthe allegation, the type of fiduciary breach, does.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but why doesn't the --\nMR. GIES: In the \"stock drop\" cases --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: There's something I'm not\nunderstanding about your argument. When you say the\nnature of the fiduciary breach pleaded is what makes the\ndifference, I am understanding you to be answering the\nquestion whether on the merits ultimately there will be\na -- they will be able to make out a claim. And I am\nsaying, as I said once before, that that seems to me a\nquestion that comes after you answer the question before\nus. And the question before us is not whether\nultimately you've stated a winning claim, but whether\nultimately -- whether right now you have stated a claim\nfor a loss to the plan.\nNow, that is not your view. Why is it that\nI am taking your answer to be an answer on the merits to\na different question and you're saying my answer, i.e.,\nnature of duty breached or -- is one that goes to the\nquestion of pleading at this stage?\nMR. GIES: Because of the words \"losses to\nthe plan\" in the text, the words on the page, in the\ncontext of the rest of 502. The words \"losses to the\nplan\" connotes something collective. The example --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but you said -- you\nsaid it doesn't have to be every single member of the\nplan.\nMR. GIES: That is correct, Justice\nGinsburg.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You said it has to be\nmore than one. How then do we read the statute to say,\nwell, it doesn't have to be the plan as a whole because\nthere may be some people that are not entitled to this?\nHow do we get that number between more than one and less\nthan everybody?\nMR. GIES: I would -- I don't think that\nthat's a useful way to think about it either, Justice\nGinsburg, which is why I think the right way to think\nabout it in the context of this statute is to think\nabout the nature of the allegation at the pleading\nstage. In the stock drop cases, the fiduciary breach\nalleged is an imprudent investment in holding company\nstock. I think the diamond analogy is closer to that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I'm -- I'm asking you\njust -- in your -- you have said, you conceded, that to\nbring the suit against the trustee, it doesn't have to\ninvolve every member, every contributor to this defined\ncontribution plan. But it has to involve --\nMR. GIES: I think that's too harsh a rule.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- more than one. So\nthat's the question I'd like to you address. You\nrecognize that there can be a claim against the\nfiduciary for breach of trust on behalf of contributors\nto the plan? So in that lawsuit, how many people would\nthere have to be to qualify? You say not everybody, but\nmore than one.\nMR. GIES: Well, as we've argued we think it\nought to be a substantial subset reflecting the nature\nof the breach alleged. That is, something systemic,\nsomething that affects the interests of the plan as a\nwhole rather than just --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: For example.\nMR. GIES: -- one individual plan\nparticipant. For example, the choice of an imprudent\ninvestment, Your Honor, where -- and that's where most\nof these stock drop cases come -- they involve company\nstock held in 401(k) plans, and the allegation is that\nit is imprudent to continue to hold the shares of the\nstock.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If you do that in two\naccounts is that enough?\nMR. GIES: It -- it very well might be. Two\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why not one?\nMR. GIES: Because --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If it -- if it is the --\nand I still don't get this, but if it is the nature of\nthe particular dereliction in duty that counts, why do\nwe need more than one?\nMR. GIES: Because the nature of the\ndereliction of duty here is the most -- hard to conceive\nof a more individualistic kind of a breach. This is\njust one dispute, one he said/she said between a\nparticipant and the -- -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It's an individualistic\nkind of breach when it is viewed as -- as only one\naccount, but it is a breach against the plan when it is\nunderstood that there is nothing to the plan except an\naggregation of accounts. You can't have a breach\nagainst one without a breach against the plan.\nMR. GIES: To which we would say, Justice\nSouter, that it's qualitatively different to breach a\nduty as alleged here on an individual basis, on a\none-transaction basis, in one account --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then why, if that is your\nanswer, why does it matter what the nature of the\ndereliction is? Because you're -- you're saying the --\nthe really important question is the nature of the\ndereliction. If it is, then I don't see why the\nmultiple of the number of accounts affected has anything\nto do with it.\nMR. GIES: Well, I suppose you could\nimagine, Justice Souter, a fact pattern where there was\nevidence -- not in this case, of course -- that there\nwas a pattern, a systemic failure to handle properly\ninvestment requests made by --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And then you've got a lot\nof plaintiffs but what difference does it make?\nMR. GIES: Well we think that comes closer\nto what -- how we read Russell and how Russell has been\nunderstood.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That may be close to the\nway you read it, but why is your reading correct? Why\nshould that make any difference?\nMR. GIES: Because in context with the rest\nof 502, 502(a)(2) has been understood, and we think for\ngood reason, not to apply to an individual case. There\nare other remedies available, in (a)(1)(B) --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What? What other\nremedies?\nMR. GIES: In (a)(1)(B), and in (a)(3) for\nequitable relief.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you said this isn't\n-- you said it isn't a claim for benefits. It's a clam\nfor lost profits. You said that a few times. I thought\n(a)(1)(B) is a claim for benefits, current or future.\nMR. GIES: The third part of (a)(1)(B)\npermits a participant to sue to enforce his rights under\nthe terms of the plan.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Which will -- which will\nget him nothing.\nMR. GIES: It might have got him the trade\nmade, maybe a few days late.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I want to go back to amend\nmy example. He only took one diamond. It was a big\nvault he took it from -- one diamond. You still have\nthe claim, right?\nMR. GIES: And -- and is that a --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's a big vault. He took\nit from one big safe deposit box -- one diamond.\nMR. GIES: And -- and is it identified in\none account?\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, this is just there in\nthe big vault.\nMR. GIES: Well, that's -- that's a\nfundamental difference.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, of course. Well--\nno, no. I'm going to, of course, ask you, since you\nseem to be turning this thing on how individualized this\nloss was, well, it was just one diamond, out of\nthousand.\nNow obviously I'm going to ask you, because\nI haven't yet heard the answer -- at least I didn't seem\nto hear it -- what the difference is whether that one\ndiamond came from a big vault or from one little safe\ndeposit box with the participant's label on it.\nMR. GIES: It's still the same kind of loss,\nobviously. You're correct, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Exactly, the same kind of\nloss. And what we have here is the footnote that was\nalleged in -- written in the opinion -- we assume the\ndefendant's conduct amounted to a breach of fiduciary\nduties. So therefore all of the discussion you have,\nthat maybe it didn't -- well, maybe you're right. But\nwe better send it back so that they can decide that\nquestion. And I just don't see what the other\ndifference is. It can't be a difference in the size of\nthe diamond. And people are saying, well, why -- well,\nyou see the question.\nMR. GIES: I do indeed, Justice Breyer. I\nthink the structure of the plan bears something on the\nright answer because this plan does not have pooled\nassets accounts, there is no way that this alleged loss\ncould have had any impact on any other plan participant,\nnor could any recovery here benefit the plan as a whole.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Can I ask a question about\nyour individual point? What if the individual's account\nwas 60 percent of the assets of the total plan? Because\ndifferent accounts are of different sizes. Would you\ngive the same answer to that?\nMR. GIES: I'd give the same answer, Justice\nStevens, in a situation like this with what I call the\nclassic one-off, he said/she said request to make a\nbrokerage trade.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Even if it was 90 percent,\nyou'd give the same answer?\nMR. GIES: I could imagine a situation where\nthe percentage gets so high that the assets might be\nheld in such a way that they could be more easily seen\nto be a loss to the plan as a whole. For example, in\nsome of these plans there's a --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So just one individual, as\nfar as we know it's a very small percentage of the\ntotal. That's the whole case as I understand it.\nMR. GIES: That -- that's correct, Justice\nStevens. I think it probably depends in your\nhypothetical on the nature of the asset. If it's mutual\nfund shares, as in this plan held by individuals, I\ndon't think it would make any difference. Some plans\nhold assets in common. This one does not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You know I could understand\nyour case if you said even if there were a hundred\ndiamonds, each of them in an individual plan, there\nstill is no loss to the plan until the plan itself has\nbeen held liable to make up for the loss. Up until that\npoint, it's just a loss in each of the individual\naccounts.\nBut you're not willing to say that. You say\nat some ineffable point it becomes a loss to the plan.\nI think there is a clear line between -- between saying\nthere is no loss to the plan unless -- unless the plan\nis first adjudicated to be liable; then there is a loss\nto the plan.\nMR. GIES: Well, we certainly --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Prior to that it's just a\nloss to the individual account. That makes some sense.\nI mean, I can understand how that works. I can't\nunderstand how your system works. You're telling me it\ndepends on how big the diamond is and -- and what kind\nof a breach it was. How can we write an opinion like\nthat?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GIES: I'm fortunate to have that not as\nmy job, Justice Scalia.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GIES: But I think -- I think it's\nclearly right as this discussion indicates that the\nright place to begin here is with (a)(1)(B). If you\nhave a claim like this, you look at the statute, it\ncomes first. It has the benefit of being first on the\npage.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I know, because in making\nthis, hitching your wagon to the (a)(1)(B) -- I thought\nyou were arguing -- what did you say the remedy for this\nperson would be? Assuming it's true that he put in his\nslip and he said invest in X set of mutual funds and the\ntrustee missed it, lost it?\nMR. GIES: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What is his remedy?\nMR. GIES: That's a very difficult question\nto answer because this is a defined contribution plan\nand not a defined benefit plan and this is a claim for\nlost profits. It's not an easy claim for lost benefits.\nNow that's why the second clause of (a)(1)(B), to\nenforce his rights under the plan, we think is the best\npart of (a)(1)(B) that this individual could pursue.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that what you argue in\nyour brief?\nMR. GIES: We did not, but our amici did.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So what did you argue is\nhis remedy, in your brief?\nMR. GIES: What we argue in our brief and\nwhat we still say is that he could have pursued\nequitable relief under (a)(3).\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What would that be?\nMR. GIES: He could have picked up the\ntelephone and called and said, like I think most of us\nwould, say I asked you to sell my sells of stock and it\nhasn't happened yet. And --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: He didn't know until he\ngot the report.\nMR. GIES: Well, that's not so clear from\nthe record, Justice Ginsburg, but in any case what\nequitable relief under (a)(3), just as (a)(1)(B) would\npermit him, is to get an injunction to force the trade\nto be executed.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's much too late.\nIt's over and done. It wasn't made.\nMR. GIES: It may or may not be much too\nlate, Justice Ginsburg, which we think is another reason\nwhy as to (a)(2), we think it's unlikely that Congress\nintended every one of these he said/she said cases to\ngive rise to a cause of action for damages. There would\nbe no end to the kinds of claims that one could imagine.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Let's take, because this\ncase was tossed out on the pleadings, the -- there are\nforms to fill out and says I want this set of\ninvestments as opposed to that set of investments. The\ncontributor fills out that form, gives it to the\nfiduciary. A careless employee for the fiduciary loses\nit, and that's the story. So what's the remedy for the\ncontributor who gave his instruction that weren't\nfollowed, not out of anything deliberate but just\ncarelessness?\nMR. GIES: Well, certainly injunctive relief\nunder (a)(3) would have been available.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Enjoining him to be\ncareless?\nMR. GIES: Enjoining him to execute the\ntrade was clearly a remedy available. And perhaps there\nwould have been a remedy --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If you say I want these\nfunds invested in this particular set of shares for this\nperiod, for this six-month period, then two years later\nyou can have that trade made? I don't understand it.\nMR. GIES: Well, we think the fact that it\ntook him so long to sue is another reflection of the\nfact that this is a claim for damages. Had he really\nintended the trade to have been made, the normal thing\nto have done would be to call up and say my trade wasn't\nmade, please make it. And if that he didn't get an\nadequate response, you'd bring an action for an\ninjunction.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's done meanwhile? He\ncame in right at the bottom and a week later, it had\ngone up 30 points.\nMR. GIES: And we think the Congress --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- no remedy?\nMR. GIES: We think that Congress did not\nwant those kinds of claims to be brought under (a)(2)\nprecisely for that kind of reason. There would be no\nend to the kind of arguments about damages. And those\nkind of cases impose costs that will ultimately be borne\nby the plans, which is inconsistent with the\ncongressional purpose in ERISA to encourage plan\nformation.\nSo this statute on this kind of a situation\nmay provide him some remedies but maybe not a complete\nremedy for loss of all the profits that he claims he was\ndenied.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You view it as a\nlost profits claim. Would your position be different if\nhe directed a sale of the stock and then the stock went\ndown 30 points instead of going up? That's not lost\nprofits. That's avoiding losses to the plan.\nMR. GIES: We think we have a different\nsituation indeed if there actually had been a\ndistribution here and the amount of the account had gone\ndown between the alleged mistake and the distribution.\nThere is clear as a claim for benefits under (a)(1)(B),\nand there I think quite easily the Court could say that\nin that situation the full value of the account at the\ntime of the alleged mistake would be benefits under the\nterms of the plan. And we think that's a material\ndistinction between this case and others, including the\ncase called Glories v. Charles Schwabb that comes out of\nthe Ninth Circuit.\nNow with respect to (a)(3), we think that\nthe equitable relief is properly understood not to\ninclude compensatory damages and that this Court's\ndecisions have been clear on that. As to surcharge, it\nwould seem to me that the one -- the best that one could\nsay is that it was the exception and not the rule and\nnot typically available in the course of equity as this\nCourt has understood --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And never available in a\ncourt of law.\nMR. GIES: And never available in a court of\nlaw. You're exactly right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, then what is it?\nIt's got to be something.\nMR. GIES: Well, I think what it was, as I\nunderstand the history of the equity jurisprudence, is\nthat you could only sue the trustee in the equity\ncourts. And so if you needed to get money and if it was\na damages claim, that was the only place where you could\nbring the action.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This isn't like a\ncleanup.\nMR. GIES: It is not, Your Honor. As we\nunderstand the argument on surcharge, it is separate\nfrom clean up and we understand that and accept that.\nBut it still sounds more like damages. It sounds\nsomething very different from what Congress, we think,\nmeant when they wrote the language of 502.\nUnlike the Landrum Griffin Act, which\npermits actions for damages, ERISA does not, and Landrum\nGriffin was one of the statutes on which ERISA was\nbased.\nIt also has fiduciary duty obligations. It\nalso has the interests of beneficiaries, members of\nlabor unions at heart. And unlike this provision in\nERISA, the Landrum Griffin act explicitly permits an\naction for damages. And we think that's further\nevidence of the fact that appropriate equitable relief\nin a situation like this under (a)(3) does not include a\nclaim like this for compensatory damages.\nIf there are no further questions, thank you\nvery much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Gies.\n"
