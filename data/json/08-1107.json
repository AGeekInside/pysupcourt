        "content": "(11:07 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument next in Case 08-1107, the Hertz Corporation v.\nFriend.\nMr. Srinivasan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. SRINIVASAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you,\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nThe diversity statute deems a corporation a\ncitizen of, quote, \"the State where it has its principal\nplace of business,\" closed quote. The Ninth Circuit\nerred in holding that Petitioner Hertz is a citizen of\nCalifornia, even though Hertz is headquartered in New\nJersey and conducts over 80 percent of its operations\noutside the State of California, and even though, under\nthe court's approach, national corporations could\nregularly be deemed California citizens if they conduct\noperations in that State that are proportional to the\nState's population.\nThe better reading of the statute, in our\nview, is that it points to the location of the\ncorporation's headquarters, the site from which a\ncorporation directs and controls all the company's\noperations throughout all of its locations. And that is\nparticularly the correct reading when the statutory\nlanguage is considered in light of two considerations.\nFirst, the strong preference for simplicity\nand ease of administration in jurisdictional rules; and\nsecond, Congress's purposes in 1958 to preserve\ndiversity jurisdiction for corporations in 48 States and\nto deny access to diversity jurisdiction only in one\nState, the State where the corporation had its home or\nprincipal place of business.\nNow, with respect to the ordinary meaning of\nthe statutory text, the critical phrase is \"principal\nplace of business.\" And dictionary definitions of that\nterm define the term \"principal place of business\" as\ncorporate headquarters, and that is fortified by Federal\nand State laws, which also define the term as \"company's\nheadquarters\" --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, the problem\nwith every test is that you can find an exception that\nmakes the application ridiculous.\nLet's assume that we accept that\nheadquarters or nerve center may have some applicability\nto a corporation that has a business in a variety of\ndifferent States.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Sure.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. That's --\nyour situation is perhaps the most attractive --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- because whether\nCalifornia has 20 percent and Florida 14 or 15 percent,\nto me the differences are not terribly substantial. I\ncan imagine McDonald's having 1 percent in every part of\nthe world, and how do you choose then? California would\nsay, then you -- you go back to headquarters. But I\ndon't know why you start there.\nBut let's posit the simpler situation.\nHeadquarters in New Jersey, but everything else is in\nCalifornia. Your test would ignore completely that --\nand it depends on how you define \"headquarters.\" If\nthey have three corporate executives, that's the entire\nextent -- or let's say one corporate executive who\nstarted the company and who lives in New Jersey, and he\nflies out to California half the time and runs the\nbusiness from there but happens to live in New Jersey.\nThen you would say diversity is still New Jersey,\ncorrect?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: We would, Your Honor. But\nlet me -- let me start first with accepting Your Honor's\npremise, that in the situation of a multistate\ncorporation with -- with diverse operations, the\nprincipal place of business would be the headquarters.\nNow, I take your point that there are\nsituations in which the test may not seem so\nstraightforward, but we think even in the -- the\nhypothetical that Your Honor posits, the better\nanswer -- at least our first submission would be, the\nbetter answer is the headquarters would control. And\nthat's for a couple of reasons.\nAlthough, again, the one exception that we\nwould have to our rule is exactly Your Honor's\nhypothetical, and let me just bracket that. Now, the\nreason we think, first and foremost --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you have not\narticulated a -- at least to me, a meaningful principle\nin which to set that exception. It has to be tied\nsomehow to the test and why the test in some situations\nwould have applicability and others may not.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Sure. And let me -- let\nme --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because I don't know the\ndifference between one headquarters and two places to do\nbusiness or three, but I can still see that some\nfactoring has to be done when the places of business are\nmore limited.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I -- well, we think\nfirst and foremost that the headquarters' role would\napply even in Your Honor's situation, and I will get to\nthat to the exception -- fashioning the exception in\njust one second --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But your case doesn't\ncall for that judgment, because you have a multistate\ncorporation, and it -- I assume you would be satisfied\nwith saying that when a corporation has dispersed\noperations, it doesn't have its business center or its\nheadquarters -- doesn't have its business center\ndominant in any one State, that it's dispersed, then you\ntake the headquarters, because there's no way to pick\namong -- choose all the others, and it certainly isn't\nworth the labor to try to do that.\nSo you could have a rule that says,\ndispersed across many States, you pick headquarters.\nAnd that -- you don't have to urge anything further.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No, absolutely, Justice\nGinsburg. And we would certainly accept the resolution\nof the case in -- in that light.\nIf the Court were to announce a rule that\nsays, multistate corporations with diverse operations,\nthe principal place of business in that situation is the\nheadquarters, I think Your Honor is correct that\ncertainly we would prevail under that and that would be\nentirely acceptable to us. But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why would we say\nthat? Just because it wins your case and it solves your\nproblem? I mean, it seems to me, to do that, you\nabandon your principal argument, which that -- which is\nthat \"place\" doesn't mean \"State.\"\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And to talk about the whole\nState of California as the principal place of doing\nbusiness -- I mean, if Congress meant that, it would\nhave said, the principal State in which business is\ndone.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's -- that's correct,\nJustice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't want to throw\naway that good argument, do you?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SRINIVASAN: We certainly don't want to\nthrow it away. We certainly don't want -- first and\nforemost, we would like to prevail. And I think even\nunder the narrow approach --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You would never get to\nCalifornia's thing about State. If you say multistate,\nyou pick the place. The headquarters is the place, it's\nwithin a State.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Yes. And -- and that's why\nwe would accept that result, Justice Ginsburg. We\ncertainly would. Let me just put that out there first\nand foremost.\nNow, with respect to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Were you done with\nyour -- were you done with your answer to Justice\nSotomayor's hypothetical?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I don't know that I, in\nfact, started the answer, Mr. Chief Justice --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SRINIVASAN: -- with respect.\nThe answer is that even in that situation,\nfor the reasons that Justice Scalia highlights, we would\nsay that the headquarters controls. And let me give two\n-- two principal reasons why.\nThe first is that even if the operations are\nin one State and the headquarters are in a different\nState, the headquarters still is where the direction and\ncontrol comes from. And I think the ordinary meaning of\nthe phrase \"principal place of business\" in that\nsituation would still direct attention to the\nheadquarters.\nAnd the dictionary definitions that we\nidentified in -- in our brief and every Federal and\nState law that defines the term \"principal place of\nbusiness\" defines it at headquarters -- as headquarters,\nwithout any exception for the hypothetical situation\nthat Your Honor posits. But the other --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what constitutes\nheadquarters?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How many executives have\nto live there? What else has to exist there? And then\nwhat is the default rule if those things don't exist?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Right. Your Honor, I think\n-- and that -- that is the sort of different set of\nquestions which is other ambiguities with respect to the\ndefinition of a headquarters in certain situations.\nNow, by and large, the headquarters is\nrelatively straightforward. It's made in public filings\nwhich are an easy place to look, and if you look at the\nexperience of the Seventh Circuit, which of course has\napplied the headquarters approach across the board over\nthe course of several decades, I think we can see that\nthat test has been straightforward and it is simple in\napplication, in the main.\nNow, that is not to say that there are not\nissues about the definition of headquarters at the outer\nperimeters. There are. And I think the place I would\nlook first and foremost is: Where does direction and\ncontrol for the corporation come from? That is the\nsitus at which the headquarters would be found.\nAnd I would look also to what a corporation\nitself identifies as headquarters in public filings. In\n10-K filings and under the Model Business Corporations\nAct, corporations have to report their headquarters in\nannual reports. And of course they are doing those\nreports for other reasons other than establishing\njurisdiction in a particular case, so I think they come\nwith an air of objectivity about them. That's where I\nwould look.\nNow, I would make this other point, though,\nabout the ambiguity that Your Honor points to with\nrespect to the definition of a headquarters. That --\nthat is not at all an ambiguity that only applies to our\ntest, because under Respondent's test and under the test\nof every court of appeals, they take into account the\nheadquarters.\nNow, we would think that that is\ndispositive. The other courts consider it at least\nhighly relevant, albeit not dispositive. But whatever\nambiguities --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why did the others all go\nthrough some through total, totality of the factors\ntest? I mean, obviously, you could pick the\nheadquarters. You'd say Congress wanted one place;\nheadquarters is a logical choice, end of -- but most\ncircuits have made it more complicated than that. The\nSeventh Circuit is the only one who said, keep it\nsimple, as you urge -- headquarters.\nWhy are the other circuits resistant to the\nsolution that you are proposing.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, first in a situation\nwith a multistate corporation with dispersed operations,\nas we point out in footnote 2 of our reply brief, I\nthink the courts of appeal are generally in agreement\nthat the headquarters would control in that situation.\nNow, with respect to whether you would have\nan across-the-board headquarters rule, Justice Ginsburg,\nI think what happened is, the first court to consider\nthis question was the Third Circuit in the Scott case,\npretty soon after the statute was enacted in 1958. And\nthat court, with respect, didn't wrestle with the\nordinary meaning of the statutory terms, and it didn't\nwrestle with the strong premium on simple and\nadministrable jurisdictional rules. And then that\ndoctrine sort of took on a life of its own, I think.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But is it -- they -- they\ndo it in different ways.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: They do.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Some say business\noperations, some say headquarters.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: There -- there is a variety\nof different approaches. I think all of them share the\ncommon feature that they consider, essentially, a\ntotality of the circumstances. And all of them, in our\nview, share a common flaw, which is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How does -- how do the\nbankruptcy courts do it? I mean, you brought out that\n\"principal place of business\" was -- was a term that the\nbankruptcy courts had been using before the amendment of\n1332, 1958. But I -- I don't think that the -- that it\nis inevitably headquarters for the bankruptcy courts. I\nmean, there's -- sometimes it is in other places, isn't\nit?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, the bankruptcy courts\n-- I think the fairest assessment of the bankruptcy\ncourts as of 1958 was that it was a model.\nNow, since then, the Collier's treatise, for\nexample, would tell you that the majority and\npredominant rule is the headquarters rule, even in the\nbankruptcy context. Pre-1958, I think there was a\nconflict. That's what the treatises said and that's\nwhat we explain in our brief. But there certainly were\nsome courts that adopted a headquarters approach, even\nin the bankruptcy context.\nBut I think one thing I would caution the\nCourt about is assuming that just because some courts in\nthe bankruptcy context, because of bankruptcy-specific\nconsiderations -- and a specific consideration was the\nfelt need to have the assets of the bankrupt estate\nwithin the purview of the court so that the court could\nadminister the estate -- that Congress would have wanted\nto import every judicial application down to every\nnuanced detail in the bankruptcy context over to the\njurisdictional context, where we know that Congress\nthought that simplicity was a real virtue.\nAnd I think, as Your Honor's opinion in\nWachovia v. Schmidt a few terms ago points out, there is\nno reason to assume that Congress would have taken one\nword in the venue context and applied the exact same\nmeaning to that same word in the jurisdictional context.\nAnd here, because of the strong preference -- excuse me\n-- in favor of simplicity and administrability in\njurisdictional rules, that is a particularly poignant\nreason why the headquarters approach, in our -- in our\npoint of view, should govern in all circumstances.\nNow --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In the case -- this is\npurely hypothetical, but suppose Hertz were to be\nbankrupt, file a petition in bankruptcy, where -- New\nJersey would be the place, on your -- or the assets are\ndominantly someplace else, so it would be another place?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think, if -- if\nwhat you are asking, Justice Ginsburg, is, where would\nthe principal place of business be under the bankruptcy\nstatute, the majority rule now, under the Fifth Circuit\ncase Commonwealth Oil Refining and the Seventh Circuit\ncase Peachtree, would show that the majority rule now is\nthat the principal place of business would be New\nJersey.\nAnd one point I would like to get to in that\nregard is the sort of oddity of saying that the -- the\nprincipal place of business of a company like Hertz\nwould be somewhere other than New Jersey. The Ninth\nCircuit has a view that the principal place of business\nof Hertz is California, based on the fact that Hertz\nconducts 20 percent of its business in California.\nBut it is important to bear in mind that\nthis statute is a zero-sum game. So that if Hertz is\ndeemed to have its principal place of business in\nCalifornia, such that it is disabled from getting access\nto diversity jurisdiction in California, the consequence\nis that Hertz would be enabled to gain diversity\njurisdiction in every other State -- and I'm putting to\none side Delaware, the State of incorporation -- but it\nwould be enabled to gain access to -- to diversity\njurisdiction in every other State.\nSo the consequence would be that if Hertz\nwere sued in a State court action in Park Ridge, New\nJersey, the site of its headquarters, Hertz could get\nFederal court jurisdiction in that jurisdiction on the\ntheory that it's an out-of-State company, it's a\nCalifornia company, because it performs 20 percent of\nits business in California.\nNow that -- the oddity of that, in our view,\nis particularly poignant if one takes into account a\ncompany like Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart is universally\nrecognized to be an Arkansas corporation because it is\nheadquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, but Wal-Mart\nalso, it's undisputed, does substantially more business\nby any of the measures that the Ninth Circuit considers\nsignificant in Texas. It has more employees there; it\nhas more stores there; it generates more revenues there,\nby a significant factor well in excess of 50 percent\nover and above any other State.\nBut the consequence of deeming Wal-Mart a\nTexas corporation based on the amount of business it\ndoes in Texas would be not only that Wal-Mart would be\ndisabled from getting Federal court jurisdiction in\nTexas, but that Wal-Mart would be enabled to get Federal\ncourt jurisdiction in Bentonville, Arkansas, on the\ntheory that even in Arkansas, Wal-Mart would be an\nout-of-State corporation, a Texas corporation, because\nof the level of business that it conducts in Texas.\nAnd we don't think that is the result that\nCongress would have envisioned in 1958 when it enacted\nthe Principal Place of Business provision. Instead,\nwhat Congress presumably had in mind is that\ncorporations, as a general matter, are identified with\nthe location of their headquarters.\nSo in the Wal-Mart situation, Wal-Mart\nrightly is universally acknowledged to be an Arkansas\ncorporation because of the presence in that State of its\nheadquarters.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, all you are\ntalking about is not necessarily nerve center, because\nin reading the examples in your brief, what you are\ntalking about is: Where is the place where they have\nthe most important, significant, influential contact?\nNow, the Ninth Circuit has defined that as\nthe place where business is done; you are suggesting\nthat it's the place where the nerve center is. But it\ngoes back to begging my question: Why -- just simply\ntheir declaring it on a tax form doesn't make it\nimportant, influential, or significant contact. There\nhas to be something more to the test, and it can't be\njust what I declare my headquarters to be. There has to\nbe some form of activity in that place.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: There does, Your Honor, and\nwe think -- I guess the -- the comparison I would make\nis to an individual, because an individual can't declare\nthat he or she is a domiciliary of a particular State\nand have it be so for citizenship purposes. There has\nto be something behind that, and so too with\ncorporations.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's -- that's the\npoint.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Exactly, and we -- we share\nthat view. A corporation couldn't simply declare that\nits headquarters are located in a -- in a location where\nit has a mailbox, for example, and have that be\ndispositive for citizenship purposes. What --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there -- is there\nsomething to a rule that says headquarters is\npresumptively the nerve center, but a challenged party,\nwhoever that is, can rebut it?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I think certainly it would\nbe a vast improvement over what the Ninth Circuit has.\nSo I would say that as a starting point, Your Honor. I\nthink -- in our view, of course, a principal submission\nis the headquarters controls in all -- in all\nsituations, and the cost of having, you know, a\nrebuttable presumption would be: What does it take to\nrebut it? That would be question. And I think--\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's the point\nthat I raised, which is that the headquarters is not an\nimportant, consequential, or substantial. You can rebut\nit if you can show that it is a shell headquarters.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Yes. And I think in that\nsituation, I guess -- I guess there is two different\nways that one could look at that. One is to say that\nyou could rebut it, but the other is to say that it is\nnot the headquarters.\nAnd I guess that's the way that I would look\nat it, is to say that if the corporation identifies a\nlocation at which it in fact doesn't direct and control\nthe operations of the corporation throughout, it\nwouldn't constitute the headquarters.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: So I guess that's where I\nwould place the load-bearing weight. It may be\nsemantic, but --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's the problem,\nwhich is, the party comes in, alleges by summary\njudgment that -- in a summary judgment motion: This is\nmy corporate headquarters. The other side's going to\nhave to come forth with evidence that shows something.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Right. And if -- and --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So that it's always a\nrebuttable presumption.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: There is, Your Honor, and\nif the other side were able to show that the location\nthat the party identifies as -- as its headquarters does\nnot, in fact, function as a headquarters, in the sense\nthat suppose there is no executives there, or suppose\nthat the officials that are there in fact don't direct\nand control the company's operations in other locations.\nWell, then, that -- that would be a real issue.\nBut there are checks against that, because\ncorporations identify their headquarters in other public\nfilings, and in the main, those headquarters are the\nlocations in -- from which the chief executives direct\nand control the companies' operations --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I actually do not know\nwhether public filings define what \"headquarters\" mean.\nIs there a -- I know you have said it in your brief, but\nwhat I didn't know is whether those public filings\ndefine the activity necessary to designate a place as\n\"headquarters.\"\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, they -- they do in\nthe following sense, Your Honor. For example, with the\n10-K report for publicly traded companies, I think the\nquestion that is asked is not the location of the\nheadquarters but the location of the principal executive\noffices. And so I think, by definition, in answering\nthat question the principal executives would be located\nat that -- at that location. Now, if they weren't, we\nwould certainly take Your Honor's point that there could\nbe a back-and-forth about that, but that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I know, but didn't\nCongress pick \"a principal place of business\"? And we\nknow that they looked at the bankruptcy courts. There\nare lots of expressions in other statutes. Some say\n\"headquarters.\" Some say -- well, there are a variety\nof things, but Congress picked this particular term,\n\"principal place of business.\"\nAnd I was thinking, when you gave the\nexample of Texas, that the idea of diversity is you are\nnot going to get a Federal forum where you are at home.\nAnd so one would think, well, if Wal-Mart is doing so\nmuch in Texas, it's really no stranger in Texas. Why\nshouldn't there be diversity in Texas?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, in -- in response to\nthe latter point, Your Honor, I think the one thing we\ndo know from 1958 is that Congress didn't think that a\ncorporation should be disabled from getting diversity\njurisdiction anywhere where it does a substantial\nbusiness, because it had that proposal before it, and it\nrejected it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It rejected it, yes.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It instead chose an\napproach whereby a company is disabled from getting\ndiversity jurisdiction in one, and only one,\njurisdiction, the jurisdiction in which it has its\nprincipal place of business.\nAnd I think what Congress had in mind is\nthat corporations, as a general matter, are identified\nwith their headquarters. And that is why Wal-Mart, for\nexample, is universally recognized as an Arkansas\ncompany. It may be that Wal-Mart does substantial\nbusiness in Texas, substantially in excess of other\nStates, but Wal-Mart also does substantial business in a\nvariety of jurisdictions. But Congress decidedly didn't\nhave the rule that says wherever Wal-Mart does a\nsubstantial business and is a well recognized company,\nit should be disabled from getting to Federal court. It\nlimited it to one jurisdiction.\nAnd we think the best reading of the phrase\n\"principal place of business\" is the situs of the\nheadquarters in that there were -- with -- with respect\nto the bankruptcy decisions, Your Honor, there -- there\nwere bankruptcy courts that did have a \"headquarters\"\napproach. And, in fact, the one bankruptcy court of\nwhich I am aware that looked at the meaning of the\nordinary language -- we cite the -- the relevant -- the\nportion of the court's opinion at page 50 of our opening\nbrief in footnote 5. It is the First Circuit's opinion\nin the Burdick case.\nAnd what the First Circuit said was that a\ncorporation's, quote, \"principal office,\" rather than a\nfactory, mill or mine, according to ordinary\nunderstanding and speech, constitutes the principal\nplace of business within the meaning of the Bankruptcy\nCode.\"\nAnd so even before 1958, I think there was\ndefinitely a sense out there that the term \"principal\nplace of business\" does mean headquarters. And this\ngets to Your Honor's other question which is: If\nCongress really meant \"headquarters,\" why wouldn't they\nhave used the term \"headquarters\" instead of \"principal\nplace of business\"?\nAnd I think our answer to that, with respect\nto Your Honor, is that \"principal place of business\" is\nan alternative formulation for \"headquarters.\" And so I\ndon't think one can glean too much from the fact that\nCongress chose \"principal place of business\" rather than\n\"headquarters\" when \"principal place of business\" in our\nview is a reference to the headquarters.\nAnd this Court's opinion last term in the\nOswell Harlow versus United States case is a good\nexample of that, because there the statute that was at\nissue used the term \"facilitate\" rather than the term\n\"aid or abet.\" And one could have readily made the\nargument that because the statute uses the term\n\"facilitate\" rather than \"aid or abet,\" that normal\nprinciples that accompany aiding and abetting liability\nshouldn't apply in the statute. But the Court rightly\nin our view reached the contrary conclusion, and it was\nbased on the notion that the term \"facilitate,\"\naccording to Black's Law Dictionary, means the very same\nthing as \"aid or abet.\" And once you cross that bridge,\nthen you can apply aiding or abetting principles to the\nterm \"facilitate.\"\nAnd here, likewise, the term \"principal\nplace of business,\" according to Black's Law Dictionary,\nmeans \"headquarters.\" That's how Black's Law Dictionary\ndefines the term. And so the fact that Congress chose\none alternate formulation versus another, I don't think\nspeaks too loudly to the question of --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about her argument\nthat -- that Hertz has this New Jersey headquarters, but\nits reservation center is in Oklahoma?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Sure, and -- and, again, I\nwould look at the public filings. In the public filings\nin the 10-K, for example, Hertz universally identifies\nits headquarters as Park Ridge, New Jersey. And the\nreason is that the chief executive officials are all\nlocated in Park Ridge.\nNow, there is a large administrative\napparatus in Oklahoma City, and, according to the\naffidavit, its administrative activities are performed\nin Oklahoma City to a lesser extent. And that is at\nparagraph 11 of the affidavit, which is at pages 29a to\n30a of the appendix to the petition.\nBut I don't think there is any real dispute\nthat Hertz's main headquarters are located in Park Ridge\nrather than Oklahoma City. In point of fact, what you\nhave in Oklahoma City -- and -- and this isn't spelled\nout in the -- in the affidavit, but what you have in\nOklahoma City is essentially the rental call center and\nplus principal back-office duties like information\ntechnology support. But what you have in Park Ridge is\nall of the company's chief executives. So the decision-\nmaking locus for the company's most important decisions\nis absolutely in Park Ridge, New Jersey, rather than\nOklahoma City. And there is no dispute on the point\nthat is before the Court.\nThis Court comes -- this case comes to the\nCourt on the assumption that Hertz's headquarters are\nlocated in Park Ridge. The question for the Court is\nwhether that headquarters location should be dispositive\nfor purposes of defining a company's principal place of\nbusiness.\nNow, if I could -- if I could turn for one\nmoment to the cost in terms of simplicity and\ndemonstrability of an alternative formulation if the\nCourt were to accommodate a formulation that didn't look\nto the headquarters, we see three potential categories\nof costs that are brought about by the -- the proposed\napproach of Respondents in what the Ninth Circuit has\nestablished.\nThe first is the one that underlies the\nstrong preference in favor of simple, demonstrable,\njurisdictional rules. And that is just the time and\nresources that would be invested at the threshold\njurisdictional stage in defining whether the case is --\nis before the proper court. That in itself is reason\nenough, in our view --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Not all diversity suits\nhave major law firms in them and a lot of resources to\nspend in -- in discovery to determine more complex\ntests.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's right. Yes, that's\nour point, Justice Kennedy, and I think a \"headquarters\"\ntest is simple and straightforward in that respect, and\na \"totality of circumstances\" approach isn't. But there\nis also two additional costs that I would point out\nabout a \"totality of circumstances\" approach.\nOne is that you can have the very real\npossibility because of the indeterminacy in that\napproach that different courts would reach divergent\nconclusions about the citizenship of the very same\ncorporation. And as we point out on page 40 of our\nbrief, that has already happened. Two district courts\nin the Ninth Circuit alone in two California courts\nreached divergent conclusions on the citizenship of\nUnited Airlines. One court concluded that United was an\nIllinois citizen, and another court concluded that\nUnited was a California citizen. And that is not\naltogether surprising that you would have those sorts of\ndivergent conclusions given the open-ended nature of the\n\"totality of circumstances\" approach.\nThe third cost that I would point to is the\npossibility that because of the indeterminacy in the\napproach you could have a situation in which a district\ncourt finds there is jurisdiction, proceeds to have a\ntrial on the merits and renders -- renders judgment on\nthe merits, and then several years later the court of\nappeals would reverse the judgment because the district\ncourt had gotten the jurisdictional input wrong at the\noutset. And, again, that also, as with the situation\nwith divergent conclusions on the citizenship of the\nsame corporation, is not just a problem of theory. It\nhas actually happened.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Even -- even when the\ndirect -- the -- even subject-matter jurisdiction is\nprecluded after final -- final judgment after direct --\nso that's nothing new. It is the same example you gave.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think -- I guess my\npoint is that precisely because subject-matter\njurisdiction can be raised at any point --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Not any point in the\ndirect -- up to denial of cert on direct review. After\nthat it's precluded, even subject-matter jurisdiction.\nYou can't collaterally attack on that basis.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Sure, right. I guess what\nmy point is that you could have a situation where a\ntrial court has reached a resolution on the merits.\nSeveral years -- several years later the court of\nappeals on direct review would reach the conclusion that\nthe district court got it wrong on subject-matter\njurisdiction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: And there is a case that we\ncite in our brief, the Diaz -- Diaz versus Pep Boys\ncase, that involve that situation.\nIf the Court has no further questions, I\nwould like to reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Schneider?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF TODD M. SCHNEIDER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. SCHNEIDER: Thank you. Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nFor 50 years every circuit save the -- save\nthe Seventh had agreed -- has agreed on one overriding\nprinciple: That courts must perform a balancing in\ndetermining the principal place of business of a\ncorporation, and that balancing must include a\ndetermination of where the corporation's people and\nproperty are.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is -- is that a fair\ndescription of what the Ninth Circuit did here? Did\nthey perform a balancing, or did they look solely to\nwhere most of the sales were?\nMR. SCHNEIDER: The -- the Ninth Circuit\nspecifically in this case noted that 43 percent more\nemployees for Hertz are in California, 75 percent more\nproperty, 60 percent more revenue, and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: More than -- more than\nwhat, more than any other single State?\nMR. SCHNEIDER: That's correct, Justice\nScalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it doesn't say the --\nthe \"principal State of business.\" It's the \"principal\nplace of business.\" Is there a difference between the\ntwo?\nMR. SCHNEIDER: I think I have two answers\nto that, Your Honor. The first answer is that Congress\nwas using a term of art that was imported from the\nBankruptcy Code.\nIn all of the Bankruptcy Code cases prior to\n1958, the 11 USC 11 cases take an aggregation approach\nwhen they look at it State-by-State, so, if we raise\nprincipal place of business as a term of art that\nCongress imported into this statute, then we have to\nlook at an aggregated State-by-State approach.\nThe other answer, I think, is more of a\nsemantic answer, which is how did Congress define the\nword \"place\"? Certainly, the English language provides\nthat a place can be a building, as Hertz would have, or\na place could be a State, as we -- my place of birth,\nfor example, is New York State.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why -- why didn't they\nsay place of doing business? That's not the terminology\nthat they used.\nMR. SCHNEIDER: They didn't, and Congress\nwas --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That would be more\nconsistent with an aggregation of -- of all of the\nfactors the Ninth Circuit starts with.\nMR. SCHNEIDER: Your Honor, Congress chose\nthe phrase \"principal place of business\" because, to\nquote the legislative history, there were many cases on\nthe books, and it was an easily understood phrase.\nI think what Congress intended to do was to\nnot have us end up here, to take a phrase which was\nknown in the case law and to import it --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, what's very\nclear from all of the articles I have read in the lower\ncourt decisions is that Congress may have thought it was\npicking a well-defined phrase, but, in fact, it wasn't,\nthat the Courts below are confused about what they were\ndoing before the statute.\nSo I don't know why importing the belief\nthat something was clear into a reality that it's not\nhelps us.\nMR. SCHNEIDER: Your Honor, in answer to\nJustice Scalia's question, I believe it was clear, from\nall of the case law, that we were talking about place\nequalling an aggregation of all of the activity in the\nState.\nWith regard to your question, we have cited\nin our brief two district court opinions that performed\na scholarly review of all of the case law at the time\nthat Congress passed the 1958 amendments. Particularly\nof import is the Inland Rubber case.\nAnd what the court found in the Inland\nRubber case is, while there was two lines of thinking,\nthere was the -- what came to be known as the nerve\ncenter line of thinking and what came to be known as the\nbusiness reality line of thinking.\nThe nerve center test could almost all be\nexplained by the fact that, in those cases, the\ncorporation only had one place of business, there were\nsome outliers, but for the most part, the two judges, in\nthe Gilardi case and in the Inland Rubber case --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why do you -- why do\nyou think that the circuits courts -- the vast majority\nof them, the third, the first, the second, the fifth,\nthey all start with the proposition that, if a place has\nfar-flung businesses, then the nerve center test should\nstart the inquiry and control it more than in a\nsituation where there are lesser places of business?\nMR. SCHNEIDER: Yes. That's the total\nactivities test, Your Honor, and the total activities\ntest would put initial weight on the nerve center, but\nif one -- and then, of course, weigh whether or not\nthere is a substantial predominance of all of -- of all\nof the other factors somewhere in the country, which,\nfrankly, is not a lot different than the Ninth Circuit\ncase -- test.\nThe Ninth Circuit simply does it in the\nother way. It asks --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's a big\ndifference.\nMR. SCHNEIDER: It asks the same question,\nwhether or not there is a -- a substantial\npredominance -- finds substantial predominance, not just\npredominance, but substantial predominance.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- you know, to me,\nthe word \"substantial\" usually means closer to 50\npercent. I'm having a hard time understanding what the\nappreciable difference is between 20 percent and 14 and\nthe balance being spread over so many other places.\nWhat -- that seems very arbitrary in terms\nof the place that generates the most money. That's it.\nThat's the place you are at home.\nMR. SCHNEIDER: I think, to understand it,\none must look at the purpose of diversity. The real\nquestion is, is diversity to be used as a sword by a\ncorporation, such that a corporation can choose its\nplace of diversity jurisdiction, or is it a shield to\nprotect the corporation, a truly foreign corporation,\nfrom local bias?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but that's what --\nbut that goes back to the point, if we are talking about\nshields or swords, Congress had before it a provision\nthat would say, anywhere you do business, you are not a\nforeigner, because you are there. The people are going\nto perceive you as a business -- the local business that\nis doing business in that location, and Congress\nrejected that.\nSo foreign has to have a meaning that was\nsomewhat different. And you don't think the corporate\nheadquarters where management is, where the direction\nfor the operation of the business is coming from, is the\nplace that needs the most protection in this system\nbecause they are the ones making the decisions, and so\naren't they the ones who need to be protected from local\nbias?\nMR. SCHNEIDER: Courts have found that\ncorporations are best known where they have most of\ntheir people and their property. That's because\nemployees go out in the community, property is bought\nand sold in the community, so the local people will know\nthe corporation more where they have their people and\nproperty than, necessarily, where they have the\nheadquarters.\nUntil this case began, I had no idea where\nHertz headquarters are. There is many corporations in\nthe State of California, that I have no idea are\nheadquartered in the State of California.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The problem with your --\nyour approach -- and California is unique in this\nrespect, is -- California is a very large State, lots of\nbusiness, and you are comparing to the next State that\nhas the next number of employees -- you know, Florida.\nIf I were entertaining your approach, I\nwould think, well, you would compare California against\nthe whole rest of the nation and not pick for a\ndispersed -- a corporation that is widely dispersed.\nCalifornia is going to be the big winner in\nthis. It's going to be able to keep all those cases in\nits State court because so many multi-State\ncorporations, I imagine, would come out, just the way\nHertz does.\nAm I right, that, under your analysis, the\none place where, if you say, we don't want Federal\ncourts to be dealing with corporations that are at home\nin the State, but in the State of New Jersey, under your\nview of things, a New Jersey citizen could sue Hertz in\nFederal court in New Jersey, right?\nMR. SCHNEIDER: That is correct, Your Honor,\nunless, of course, Hertz were to change its place of\nincorporation to New Jersey.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And why do you say,\nwell -- why is it that the Ninth Circuit's method,\nCalifornia versus Florida, instead of California and\nlet's see what the rest of the business is -- is, in the\nwhole United States?\nMR. SCHNEIDER: I think the answer, Justice\nGinsburg, to that question goes back to how the phrase\n\"principal place of business\" was looked at under the\nBankruptcy Code, and in the Bankruptcy Code, it was, in\nfact, a State-by-State analysis, rather than a State\nversus country analysis.\nNow, Justice Ginsburg, you asked me, did it\nmean that all corporations were going to end up being\nCalifornia corporations? California -- the Ninth\nCircuit has been doing it this way for 50 years. Every\nother circuit has had -- save the seventh -- has had\nsome balancing test for 50 years, and it has not come to\npass that all corporations are California corporations.\nA matter of fact, if you think of a\ncorporation that sells skis, they are likely going to be\na Colorado corporation, or they are going to be a Utah\ncorporation. A -- a corporation that sells mining\nequipment is likely to end up in West Virginia or one of\nthe mining States.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand why,\nsomehow, a Californian is more likely to identify with\nHertz, simply because there are more Californians and,\nhence, more Hertz outlets, than a New Jerseyite is\nlikely to identify with Hertz.\nPer capita, there are probably as many Hertz\noutlets in New Jersey as there are in California. The\nonly reason that you come up with California is it's an\nenormous State. It has 10 percent of the population.\nBut as far as the citizens of the State\nidentifying with that -- with that company and,\ntherefore, the unfairness of -- of letting that\ncompany -- you know, remove to Federal court, New Jersey\nand California are absolutely the same.\nMR. SCHNEIDER: Congress made a decision in\nrejecting the any place where you are doing business\ntest, that it would not prevent corporations from\nremoving cases in any State where they are doing\nbusiness.\nThe question in diversity jurisdiction is\nnot whether or not a corporation should be allowed to\nuse the Federal forum to decide if that's the best forum\nfor it, but the question is a different one. Will there\nbe bias in the -- in the State court?\nAnd because Hertz does so much business in\nCalifornia, it's hard to argue that we bias by being in\nthe State court in California. Remember, this case --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But they cannot be\nadvised by the State court in New Jersey either. The --\nyou correctly pointed out that Congress said place of\nbusiness. It didn't even do as it did with -- it didn't\ndo as it did with -- with corporate citizenship, that is\nyou could be a citizenship of as many States as you\nincorporate in. But if it's got to be one place, so why\nnot just keep it simple and say presumptively it's the\nbusiness headquarters, in a particular case you could\nshow otherwise.\nMR. SCHNEIDER: Congress had two goals,\nJustice Ginsburg. The first goal was to prevent gaming\nof the system. The simplest test is also the most\neasily --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that would be a phony\nheadquarters. But nobody is suggesting that -- that the\nheadquarters of Hertz in New Jersey, that that's a sham\nset-up.\nMR. SCHNEIDER: But even a -- even a real\nheadquarters wouldn't prevent gaming of the system.\nIf -- if a corporation truly wanted to stay out of State\ncourt in a State where it was doing significant\nbusiness, even all of their business under Hertz' test,\nthey would only have to actually move their headquarters\nout of that State.\nThere is a second reason that Congress\npassed the '58 amendment --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that phenomenon? I\nmean, I can see that as a hypothetical, but does it\nhappen in the real world, that a corporation moves its\nheadquarters in order to escape the Federal courts in a\nparticular State?\nMR. SCHNEIDER: Because the test is only a\nSeventh Circuit test, it wouldn't do any good for a\ncorporation --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it is one of the\nfactors in other -- in other states as well. It's part\nof the totality of the circumstances. You certainly\nincrease your odds to move your headquarters.\nMR. SCHNEIDER: It would, but it wouldn't be\ndispositive. We do know that corporations move for all\nsorts of economic reasons. They move for tax reasons,\nthey move because --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But why would they move\nsimply to avoid a Federal court or to gain access to the\nFederal court in a particular State?\nMR. SCHNEIDER: There is -- as witnessed by\ncongressional findings in the Class Action Fairness Act,\nthere is a perception that State courts in certain\nStates are not good for corporations. Whether that --\nthat perception is a real perception or whether it's not\na real perception isn't before us today.\nBut if a corporation has all of its people\nand all of its property and is doing all of its business\nin one of those States, the corporation shouldn't be\nallowed to game the system by simply moving its\nheadquarters, it's real headquarters out of that State.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But we are not talking\nabout all. I mean, that would be -- that's why you make\nit a presumption, the headquarters is a presumption\nwhich could be rebutted. But you are not talking about\nall business. You are talking about California where\nthere is a sizeable amount of business, simply because\nit's the size of the State, the population of the State.\nAnd I would understand your position better\nif you would say, well, we would measure against the\nentirety of the United States. But California is going\nto come out the winner much more often than any other\nState under this test simply because of its size.\nMR. SCHNEIDER: With respect, Justice\nGinsburg, I don't believe that the case law has borne\nthat out. Again, I have read no studies that say\ncorporations are more often California citizens simply\nbecause of the population of California -- that doesn't\nmean that the study hasn't exist -- doesn't exist. I\nsimply haven't read it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We don't worry about\nprivate individuals gaming the system, do we, by -- you\nknow, in -- in order to get into or out of Federal\ncourt, establishing residence in a different State? We\ndon't worry about them gaming the system, do we?\nMR. SCHNEIDER: We do, Justice Scalia.\nThere is a fact-intensive test for citizenship for\nindividuals based on their intent to stay in a place.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Sure. But -- but you can\nhave a genuine intent to go somewhere else, and I don't\nknow that people do it for foreign reasons because they\nwant to get in or out of Federal court. You really\ndon't worry about that, it seems to me.\nMR. SCHNEIDER: I do believe it is less\nlikely that an individual would either have the\nsophistication or, frankly, the litigation volume to\nmake such a decision? But a corporation may, in fact.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I know some rich\nindividuals that might have the incentive.\nMR. SCHNEIDER: I would like to turn, if I\nmay, to the second reason that Congress passed the '58\namendment and that was because of the notion of\novercrowding of the Federal docket because too many\ndiversity cases -- because there were too many diversity\ncases because most litigation was happening far away\nfrom the facts.\nSuits involving corporations generally arise\nwhere they have a lot of contacts with the public, where\nthere people are and where their property are. If we\nallow a corporation to move all of its litigation where\nthe bulk of its people and property are to Federal\ncourt, Congress's second goal --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Schneider, can I just\ninject this thought? It goes back to Justice Kennedy's\nquestion. I don't think we are concerned about the\ndefendants gaming the system. I think one other very\nimportant concern is plaintiffs sometimes in small\ncommunities want to sue somebody, and sometimes they\nwould much rather be in Federal court, because sometimes\nthe judges are better than the local judges, and so\nforth. So there are a lot of reasons why plaintiffs\nwant to get into Federal courts.\nAnd it seems to me it's important to have a\nrule that makes it easy for the plaintiff to decide what\nis the citizenship of the defendant, can I get into\nFederal court or not. And I see it as a great argument\nin favor of a very simple rule to benefit plaintiffs.\nMR. SCHNEIDER: The -- again, for 50 years,\nJustice Stevens, plaintiffs and plaintiffs' lawyers have\nbeen able to under the various tests figure out where\ncorporations are citizens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you must acknowledge\nthat it's a lot easier for a plaintiff -- there is some\nplace to get on the internet and say where is their\nprincipal place and they get a simple answer. If you\nget a question, well, I got to analyze their business\nall over the country to decide, that's a formidable\nobstacle for a -- for a plaintiff to overcome.\nMR. SCHNEIDER: It may or may not be,\ndepending upon the corporation. The vast majority of\ncorporations are local corporations, so we are really\njust talking about --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- of an interstate\nbusiness who are commonly defendants in a lot of\nlawsuits -- in a personal injury suit, and the question\nis, can I easily decide what the place of incorporation\nof that defendant is.\nMR. SCHNEIDER: That's correct, Justice\nStevens. And because most of those entities are public\ncorporations, there is a lot of information available in\nFCC filings, et cetera, as to where they are actually\ndoing business. You can also simply look out your door\nand figure out whether have I seen a lot of Hertz\noutlets where I am.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where is -- under\nthe Ninth Circuit test, where is -- what is the\nprincipal place of business of Starbucks?\nMR. SCHNEIDER: Under the Ninth Circuit\ntest, the principal place of Starbucks, there is a case\nthat says Starbucks is in California. Let me give you,\nMr. Chief Justice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's a surprise.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SCHNEIDER: I was -- I was surprised as\nwell. But -- but let me give you the numbers so that it\nmakes sense, because I have read the case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where is -- where is its\nheadquarters.\nMR. SCHNEIDER: Headquarters is in Seattle,\nWashington. But over -- that's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's the very first\nlittle shop was there.\nMR. SCHNEIDER: That's my understanding,\nyes. However, over 100 percent more workers from\nStarbucks are in California than Washington.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you tell me what\n100 percent means? Are the number of workers in Seattle\ninconsequential? Is there one worker there or are we\ntalking about 1,000 in --\nMR. SCHNEIDER: I don't know the total\nnumbers of the workers.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't that important?\nAs Justice Scalia said that per capita California is\ngoing to dwarf anybody anywhere if you are going to have\na multi-location place of business. So don't you have\nto know the raw numbers?\nMR. SCHNEIDER: I -- I don't know the raw\nnumbers from Starbucks, I'm sorry. I just read the\nopinion. And what the opinion tells us is that\nStarbucks has 10 percent of its employees in Washington\nand 27 percent in California. Over 300 percent more of\nits gross revenue comes from California than any other\nState, 200 percent more of its retail stores are in\nCalifornia than in any other State.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about, I guess,\nmail order houses? I mean, what's the principal place\nof business of Eddie Bauer?\nMR. SCHNEIDER: It would -- it would be,\nYour Honor, wherever there is a substantial predominance\nof its people and property. I would assume -- and I\ndon't know the facts of Eddie Bauer, but I would assume\nEddie Bauer has a central location from which it does\nits sales, which it does its factory work, where it is\nshipping things from.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would -- would it\nmake a difference if, say -- it may well be the case, 30\npercent of their business is in California?\nMR. SCHNEIDER: No. But by business you\nmean revenue, Your Honor?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. SCHNEIDER: The test we posit, Your\nHonor, focuses on people and property. The test would\nlook first to the location of employees, tangible\nproperties and production activities, and then second to\nincome earned, purchases made and where sales take\nplace.\nMr. Chief Justice, did the Court have\ninterest in the jurisdictional argument?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't know.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I can only speak for\none member of the Court, and that one doesn't.\nMR. SCHNEIDER: Okay. Then if the Court has\nany questions about the -- our jurisdictional argument,\nI would be happy to answer them. And without further\nquestions --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Srinivasan, you have four minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MR. SRI SRINIVASAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Your Honor, just one point\nand I will be brief.\nThe idea that corporations would switch\ntheir -- location of their headquarters in order to\nachieve jurisdictional results hasn't been borne out in\nany example in which I'm aware. And there is a\nfundamental reason why.\nWhen a corporation decides to relocate its\nheadquarters, it's making a very important business\ndecision about what is the location from which its\ndirection and control is going to emanate. That is not\na gamesmanship decision. That's a bona fide decision\nabout where its headquarters are going to be located and\nwhere its most important decision -- business decisions\nare going to be made.\nIf the Court has no further questions --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That means that its\nprincipal officers and their families have to move.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It does.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's the biggest\ndisincentive it seems to me.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Absolutely, Justice Scalia.\nIf the Court has no further questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
