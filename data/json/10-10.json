        "content": "(10:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in case 10-10, Turner v. Rogers.\nMr. Waxman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nDue process requires the assistance of\ncounsel before an alleged civil contemner can be\nincarcerated. That categorical rule flows from the\nimposition by a court in a formal adversary proceeding\nof what this Court has termed, quote, \"the awesome\nprospect of incarceration.\" Certainly -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's -- it's a formal\nadversary proceeding in a very limited sense and not in\nthe sense that caused us to require counsel to be\nprovided in criminal proceedings where the other side is\narmed with the legal knowledge that the poor defendant\ndoes not have. Many of these proceedings do not involve\ncounsel on the other side, do they?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, Justice Scalia, the\nanswer is yes and no. I don't think that you can call\nthis nonadversarial because the -- because South\nCarolina, as a matter of -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm talking of counsel. Is\nit not true that many, perhaps most, of these\nproceedings do not have counsel on the other side? It\nis the wife who is trying to get payment of -- of the -\nof the defaulted alimony and does not have counsel -\nMR. WAXMAN: I think it is -- the contrary\nis true. According to the government statistics, 70\npercent of noncustodial parents either have no income or\nhave income less than $10,000, and, therefore, in a\nState -- in every State that accepts TANF funds, which\nis every State, they are represented by the State\nagency, and South Carolina in this case has made a rule\nthat in-State cases -- and that also includes nonwelfare\ncases where the -- a custodial parent has chosen to be\nrepresented by the State -- the State entirely carries\nits prosecutorial burden by filing a rule to show cause\nand an affidavit showing the arrearages, and that places\nthe burden, which South Carolina says is a heavy burden,\non the defendant to prove inability to comply as a\ncondition of maintaining his liberty. In this -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if we agree with you,\nisn't this going to create an imbalance? Now, in this\ncase, Ms. Rogers was not represented by counsel at this\nproceeding, was she?\nMR. WAXMAN: Ms. Rogers -- in most of the\nproceedings, and it does vary from one to the other. In\nall -- let's put it this way: In all of the\nproceedings, the charges and the State's prima facie\ncase of willful contempt was established by a State\nemployee.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Yes. The State employee\nsends out the -- the rule to show cause and proof that,\nevidence that the -- the noncustodial parent is in\narrears on the child payments. So, let's see what would\nhappen if counsel is then appointed in one of these\ncases, where both the custodial parent and the\nnoncustodial parent are indigent and perhaps not very\nwell educated.\nCounsel is appointed for the noncustodial\nparent, and counsel comes in and says this is the income\nof my client, and he's hurt, he was hurt on the job, all\nhis -- his income is Social Security disability\nbenefits, and he doesn't have enough money to pay child\nsupport. Now, the custodial -- the non -- the custodial\nparent who has no attorney says: He's not really hurt,\nI see him, I see him walking around, he's going hunting,\nhe's shooting baskets, he's driving around in a new car.\nIt may not be the -- the title may not be in his name,\nhe's -- he's out on the street corner, he's buying\ndrugs, he's drinking alcohol, but I don't have a lawyer,\nand I can't prove any of this.\nSo you've created a great imbalance there,\nhaven't you?\nMR. WAXMAN: Not at all, Justice Alito.\nFirst of all, in all -- in the -- in the majority of\ncases the department of social services is in fact the\nreal party in interest and the moving party, and in any\nprivate case, for a nominal fee the custodial mother can\nhave the department of social services act in that role\nas Federal law requires the State to do. Second of\nall -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, why don't you argue for\na rule that -- that the State must provide counsel for\nthe defendant in these cases where it has provided\ncounsel or there is paid counsel on the other side?\nWouldn't that be fair?\nMR. WAXMAN: That would certainly be more\nthan fair, and the number of instances -- let -- let's\nbe clear about this. The number of instances in which\nthe State will be required to appoint counsel for the\nalleged civil contemner will be in cases where -- I\nmean, there's no reason why the State of South Carolina,\nwhen it issues the summons and the affidavit, says fill\nout this form and let us know whether you have assets or\nhave income -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you -\nMR. WAXMAN: In all of those cases where\nthey believe that this is a turnip, not a deadbeat dad,\nthey will proceed with remedies other -- other than\nincarceration. It's only when they want to proceed in\nthe face of a form that shows indigence and inability to\nhave counsel, that the State has to provide a lawyer\nbefore it -- before it puts this man in jail.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you asked -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman, in your\nopening statement, you said whenever, in civil contempt,\na person is subject to incarceration he or she is\nentitled to counsel. In your opening statement, you\ndidn't limit it to cases like the case we have before\nus; that is, where the defense is I'm unable to pay.\nTherefore, I can't get out of jail.\nAre you limiting -- are you limiting your\nargument to the case of a noncustodial parent or a\nformer husband who says I just haven't got the\nwherewithal to pay? Or are you making a broader claim\nthat anytime someone is subject to incarceration they\nmust have counsel?\nMR. WAXMAN: It is definitely the broader\nclaim; that is, this -- this decision about counsel has\nto be determined ex ante, because the State -- and this\nis our -- I suppose our more limited request for a\ncategorical rule. Where you have a State that has\nplaced the burden on the noncustodial parent -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, my -- my question\njust follows from what I think Justice Ginsburg must\nhave in mind. My understanding is that it's a\ncommonplace if the witness declines to testify even\nthough the witness has immunity, or the attorney or the\nwitness declines to produce a document, the judge says\nyou will remain in jail until you comply. In most of\nthe States, I think he's allowed counsel, but does the\nbroad statement that you -- or the broad argument that\nyou responded, that you're making when you answered\nJustice Ginsburg's case, apply there, so we are in\neffect saying in all these cases you must have appointed\ncounsel?\nMR. WAXMAN: No, no, no. Our submission is\nany case in which the State proposes to deprive somebody\nwith an unqualified right to liberty of that liberty by\nactual incarceration, there is a right to counsel. Now,\nthere is a right to appointed -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You're committed to\ncustody until you testify.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: \"Mr. Bailiff, take him\nout.\"\nMR. WAXMAN: There -- the cases have\nrecognized a distinction, Justice Kennedy, between\ndirect contempt and indirect contempt. And direct\ncontempt, which is a witness in the courtroom refuses to\ntestify, the cases have -- both civil and criminal -\nhave not required the appointment of counsel or a jury\ntrial or anything like that. In -- in a case where the\ngrand jury witness refuses to testify, the cases all, to\nmy knowledge, do require the appointment of counsel\nbecause there may be a defense, and someone is being\ndeprived of their liberty.\nNow, I think it's important -- Justice\nGinsburg, you asked me if I have a more limited rule,\nand in this instance, the limited rule is that certainly\ncounsel requires -- certainly the due process clause\nrequires the appointment of counsel where the State\nplaces the affirmative burden on the contemner to\ndemonstrate as a matter of law and fact that he was\nunable to comply, and, thus, that incarceration would\nnot be unlawful punishment, but lawful coercion. And\nthat is, I think, an important distinction. The -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Waxman, the\nSolicitor General suggests that the failure in this case\nor the failure to appoint counsel arises from a due\nprocess complaint that the -- that the -- that the\nPetitioner here didn't know that he had indigency as a\ndefense or what he needed to prove or to bring to court\nto prove that. Why wouldn't the Solicitor General's\nsolution of saying, as long as a State tells a defendant\nthat they have a burden of proof and some contours of\nwhat proof they need to supply or -- on that issue, that\nthat would satisfy due process? What can a lawyer do\nwhen someone comes in and says, I'm not earning any\nmoney, I can't earn it, blah, blah, blah, end of story?\nMR. WAXMAN: The reason -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What do you need? Why\ndo you need -\nMR. WAXMAN: The reason it doesn't satisfy\n-- even if the -- even if the defendant is advised that\nthere is an inability-to-comply defense and that a\nsentence imposed where there is an inability to comply\nis unlawful under Gompers and Bagwell, and for that\nmatter under South Carolina law, is that the showing\nthat the -- the burden that the defendant has to\nshoulder, the shoulder -- the showing that the defendant\nhas to make is both legal and factual, and neither one\nof them is straightforward. It's legal, for example,\nbecause there are lots of legal questions built into the\nunable-to-comply defense, including what it means to be\nunable to comply. Intentional underemployment, the\nallegation made in this court that he's using up all his\nincome on drug use, the ability to -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: He admitted that.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, no, he admitted that he\nwas a -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: At least up until the\naccident.\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes. Exactly.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It was up until then.\nMR. WAXMAN: But the point is that -\nintentional underemployment, the drug use, the ability\nto incarcerate somebody so that they can reduce their\narrearage on a work release program, perhaps the\nrequirement that he sell his $1,500 car -- those are all\nlegal questions as to whether the defendant -- they\nconstitute an inability to comply.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And you don't think that\nan individual is capable of saying, I can't -- I'm -\nyes, I am, or no, I'm not using up my money on drugs;\nthat's my preference?\nMR. WAXMAN: I mean, the -- the first of\nall -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or I have a $1,500 car,\nbut I need it to be able to do something else?\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Sotomayor, even leaving\naside all of those undecided questions under South\nCarolina -- legal questions under South Carolina law,\neven as to the facts that you've addressed, the burden\nis not insignificant. Recall that a mere assertion -- I\nmean, in this case this man filled out a form saying\nthat -- certifying that he had no income and one asset,\na car worth $1,500. In order -- the -- the courts have\nsaid that assertions don't satisfy it. He has to -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Where is that form in\nthe record?\nMR. WAXMAN: Hmm?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Where is the form in the\nrecord?\nMR. WAXMAN: The form is in the trial\nrecord; we did not include it in the -- in the Joint\nAppendix. We can make it available to the Court. It -\nit is in the trial record, and we didn't understand at\nthe time we were filing that the United States would be\nmaking an argument that the submission of a, quote,\n\"simple form\" would satisfy due process.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you -\nMR. WAXMAN: I thought of lodging it -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel.\nMR. WAXMAN: But I think the Court's lodging\nrules -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel!\nMR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, I'm sorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have stressed\nthat the burden in this case is on the defendant. Would\nyour position be different if the burden were on the\ncomplainant?\nMR. WAXMAN: I think the case would -- our\ncase would not be as strong. To be sure, in the\ncriminal -- in the criminal contempt context, the\nburden, of course, is on the State and to prove beyond a\nreasonable doubt, but there is an acknowledged right to\ncounsel, and there was for decades before this Court\nconsidered criminal contempt to be a crime within the\nmeaning of the Sixth Amendment.\nSo, I think we would still -- even if the\nburden had shifted, the broader rule we're asking for\nis, look, the -- here the State is sending a man to jail\nrepeatedly on the premise of exacting compliance with\ncourt orders and on the theory that he holds the keys to\nhis own pocket because he can always choose to comply.\nAnd our submission is that when the State uses that\nsanction on the basis of that theory, due process\ndemands that it guarantee the assistance of counsel to\nassure that the district court is right and that the\nsentence imposed is lawfully coercive and not\nunconstitutionally punitive.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Waxman -\nMR. WAXMAN: That's our -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- suppose the Court thinks\nthat -- suppose the Court looks at this record and\nthinks this is a broken system and a violation of due\nprocess, but requiring a counsel in every case may go\ntoo far, and there may, in fact, be alternate procedures\nthat a State could adopt that would comply with due\nprocess. And I know that this is not your submission;\nit's, instead, the solicitor general's submission. But\nif pressed on that point, what procedures do you think\nwould be capable of giving a person in this situation a\nfair shake at this?\nMR. WAXMAN: Certainly -- I mean, we think\nthat, given the way the adversary system works and given\nthe legal nature of the determination that a judge makes\ndepriving somebody of liberty, and given the significant\nburdens that are faced in carrying the burden to\nestablish that, there are none. Due process requires\nthe application of what this Court in Lassiter called\nthe general rule or the presumption that civil or\ncriminal, when the State chooses to absolutely deprive\nsomebody fully at liberty of his liberty, it must\nprovide counsel.\nI mean, I suppose the closest second would\nbe what Justice Powell, providing the fifth vote in\nVitek, provided, which is even in that case where the\ndecision was being made by a mental health professional\nand the issue involved the transfer from somebody in\nState prison to a State mental unit, a much diminished\nliberty interest -- even Justice Powell, providing the\nfifth vote, said, well, in light of the nature of the\ndecision being made and the decision-making body, I\nwouldn't always require counsel -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -\nMR. WAXMAN: -- I would think that a trained\nmental health professional would work.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Waxman, for those of us\nwho think the Due Process Clause doesn't contain\nwhatever we think it ought to contain, but -- but\ncontains what the people who ratified it thought it\ncontained, what's the earliest case that you have which\nadopts the proposition that you're now espousing, that\nwhenever a civil contempt citation is imposed upon an\nindigent person, that person is entitled to counsel as a\nmatter of due process?\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Scalia, if I had such a\ncase, it would have appeared quite prominently in my\nbrief. There is no such case, but let me make two\npoints about history and what the Due Process Clause\nmeans, notwithstanding what some of us might like it to\nmean.\nFirst of all, history -- the history is\nvery, very complicated, and it doesn't dictate the\nanswer. The traditional distinction along the lines was\nnot between civil or criminal contempt, but direct or\nindirect contempt, and as I know Your Honor knows\nbecause you've written it, traditionally at common law,\nI mean, counsel was provided for civil cases and in\nmisdemeanor cases, but not felony cases.\nThe criminal/civil distinction in contempt\narose in this Court around the turn of the 20th century,\nand it arose so that the courts could exercise more\nsupervisory review over the imposition of criminal\ncontempt by courts.\nNow, in Cooke and Oliver, this Court, as I\nsaid, long, long before it recognized that criminal\ncontempt was a Sixth -- a crime entitled to all Sixth\nAmendment protections, held that because of the nature\nof the deprivation of liberty, the appointment of\ncounsel was required. And our submission here is, as\nthis Court has recognized, the distinction between civil\nand criminal contempt is the question of whether you\nhave coercive imprisonment or imprisonment as\npunishment.\nAnd in almost every case, the sentence\ninvolves some aspect of both, and where the only thing,\nthe only thing, that keeps the coercive imprisonment\nfrom being unconstitutionally punitive absent a jury\ntrial right and proof beyond a reasonable doubt and\ncounsel, is the ability to comply with the court's\norder. And that burden is put on the defendant, even\nthough it is the State's burden to prove willfulness,\ndue -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think -\nMR. WAXMAN: -- fundamental fairness as due\nprocess -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Whenever there is an\nerroneous judgment in a civil contempt case, it becomes\na criminal contempt case; is that -- is that what you're\nsaying?\nMR. WAXMAN: This -- this Court has said in\nBagwell and in Gompers that, in the event that the\nsentence applied -- in Bagwell it was a fine; in Gompers\nit was imprisonment -- served only punitive purposes and\ncould not be coercive because the defendant could not\ncomply, that sentence was unlawful because it had not\nbeen imposed following a proceeding in which the\ngovernment -\nJUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't -- I'm still\ncurious -- are you finished?\nMR. WAXMAN: But, yes -- just in -- I'm\nsorry, Justice Breyer, just to finish this sentence -\nthat is the sine qua non of the distinction, and the -\nand unlike, for example, the immigration context and the\nother contexts that the Government is relying on, this\nis a situation in which the consequence of an error,\nthat is an erroneous outcome renders the detention an\nunlawful criminal penalty. That is not true in any\nother context.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you saying all the -\nall the trappings of criminal procedure come with it?\nThis case is focused on a right to counsel, but what\nabout burden of proof, what about a jury trial?\nMR. WAXMAN: No, Justice Ginsburg, this\nCourt has made -- we're talking about a determination\nex ante, before the man is sent to jail, in this case\nfor repeated long periods, should he be appointed\ncounsel. This Court has already said that, in civil\ncontempt proceedings, there is no requirement of proof\nbeyond a reasonable doubt and there is no requirement of\nproof of a jury trial, just as following Gault, this\nCourt said there is no requirement of a jury trial in a\njuvenile commitment case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: My goodness, if -- if\nyou're relying for that proposition only on the fact\nthat we've already said it, why don't you also say we've\nnever said what you want us to say now? I mean, if\nthat's the only argument, we've already said it. If it\nwas wrong, we should unsay it.\nMR. WAXMAN: It wasn't wrong, Justice\nScalia, and as we've pointed out, the majority of States\nand all seven circuits that have spoken to this question\nhave all held that there is, in fact, a right to\nappointed counsel before the State in an -- in an\nassertedly civil contempt proceeding can deprive a human\nbeing of his liberty.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But if all of the arguments\nyou're making to us are correct, why shouldn't the other\naccompaniments of a full-dress criminal trial apply -\nMR. WAXMAN: Because -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- so he has counsel, but\nthe burden's been put on him, rather than on the State,\nto prove, in fact, that he -- whether or not he is\nindigent?\nMR. WAXMAN: Because the proceeding is\ncivil. It is not our contention that this is a criminal\nproceeding, and this Court in Maggio and in Hicks v.\nFeiock made clear that shifting the burden, so long as\nthe -- so long as the imprisonment is meant to be\ncoercive, shifting the burden is not unconstitutional\nand because -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why is it that -\nMR. WAXMAN: I'm sorry -- and because it is\na civil proceeding -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's an illogical\ndistinction, is what I'm saying.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe Justice Alito\ncan -\nMR. WAXMAN -- I'm not sure, but -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- can ask his\nquestion.\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes, Justice Alito?\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why isn't something like\nwhat the Solicitor General suggested adequate here? The\nState provides a very clear form for the noncustodial\nparent to fill out, and then in court the judge goes\nthrough it step by step: Are you working? How much are\nyou making? Any -- do you have any other money? What\nexpenses do you need for living?\nAnd then if you run into some of these\ncomplicated legal problems or arguably complicated legal\nproblems that you referred to, maybe in particular cases\nthere would be need for the appointment of counsel. But\nwhy isn't that adequate to deal with this situation\nrather than a categorical rule that you have to have\ncounsel appointed in every case where there's an issue\nabout ability to pay?\nMR. WAXMAN: It's -- that submission is\ninconsistent with how the adversary process works, and\nmore importantly, Justice Alito, it misunderstands the\nnature of the burden. Unlike in Gagnon v. Scarpelli,\nwhere the mine-run of cases only involved the parole\nrevocation board to determine whether somebody had\nsubsequently been convicted, here the mine-run of cases\ninvolves things that -- that an uncounseled, lay, often\nundereducated, often incarcerated defendant can't do.\nFor example, just the -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you think the issue here\nis more complicated than the issue about whether\nsomebody's probation should be revoked?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, what Gagnon v. Scarpelli\nsaid was in any -- in the mine-run of cases, all that is\nrequired with respect to somebody who has a highly\nreduced liberty interest in an informal proceeding is\nwhether or not they have subsequently been convicted,\nyes or no. And if it's any more than that binary\nfactor, counsel probably is going to be required. And\nour submission is the mine-run of these cases involve\nthe marshaling of evidence and testimony that\nuncounseled, uneducated defendants -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman -\nMR. WAXMAN: -- are not likely to be able to\ndo and legal questions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman, you mentioned\nLassiter, and you mentioned something that Lassiter said\nin passing, but what was at stake there was deprivation\nof parental status. And the Court said sometimes, in\nsome cases, yes; but we're not going to make an\nacross-the-board rule.\nNow, that deprivation, some people think, is\nthe worst possible, for a custodial parent to be told\nyou're no longer a parent, you no longer have a child.\nAnd yet, the Court said we're not going to provide\ncounsel in every case, because in some cases the person\ncan get a fair hearing without counsel.\nMR. WAXMAN: Right. And what the Court -\nand recognizing that Lassiter is dicta, because it did\nconsider that context, what it said is we have to -- we\nhave to do the Mathews v. Eldridge balancing against a\ngeneralization, what -- a \"preeminent generalization\"\nthat exists in our case law, which is that there is a\npresumption that an indigent defendant has a right to\nappointed counsel only when he loses or may be deprived\nof his liberties. Since that doesn't apply here, we\nhave to do the Mathews v. Eldridge balancing against the\npresumption that cuts the other way.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: My concern is -- and it's\nbeen brought up in some of the other questions that\nJustice Ginsburg asked earlier. I just have the sense\nthat there are thousands of these hearings around the\ncountry, and they're -- and they're very important in\norder to ensure child support, and that if we adopt your\nrule, in many cases where counsel are now waived or not\npresent because of the -- the noncompliant parent is\ngoing to ask for counsel and that we're going to change\nthe entire landscape of domestic relation proceedings,\nthe Heisenberg principle.\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Kennedy, the vast\nmajority of jurisdictions require counsel and provide\ncounsel, and there is no -- we would think that if this\nwere -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In every case? I mean,\ndoesn't the defendant have to -- or the -- or the\nnoncompliant parent have to ask for counsel?\nMR. WAXMAN: I believe the rule is that if\nyou have a right to counsel, the court is required to\nadvise you that if you -- that you have one, and if you\nare unable to afford -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: My question is: Do you -\nare there any data -- are there any data to show that in\nmost of these cases, counsel does, in fact, appear?\nMy -\nMR. WAXMAN: I'm not aware -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: My assumption is not, but\nI just -\nMR. WAXMAN: I'm not aware of data one way\nor the other. We're only asking this Court to conform\nthis Court's due process jurisprudence with the vast\nmajority of State and lower Federal courts that have\nfound it -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Does that go for alimony\nand palimony as well as child support?\nMR. WAXMAN: It would go to any instance in\nwhich an alleged civil contemner is facing\nincarceration -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, the answer is yes, it\nwould cover.\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes, and can demonstrate an\ninability to afford counsel in the same way that happens\nin misdemeanor cases.\nMay I reserve the balance of my time?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Waxman.\nMs. Kruger.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONDRA R. KRUGER\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING REVERSAL\nMS. KRUGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn civil contempt proceedings to enforce\norders for child support, due process requires a\nmeaningful opportunity to be heard on the simple and\nstraightforward, but critical, question that\ncharacterizes remedial sanctions in this area: whether\nthe nonpaying parent has the ability to pay. Such -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Kruger, you say that the\nprocedures here were inadequate but that counsel in\nevery case is not necessarily required. You say\nalternate procedures can provide people in this\nsituation with a fair shake.\nBut then, when you look at the procedures\nthat you actually say would comply with due process,\nthey are remarkably anemic. Basically, you say that a\nform has to be provided. You don't require that there\nbe anybody attached to the court, the kind of person\nthat Justice Powell might have been talking about in\nVitek, some kind of caseworker to assist the person with\nwhatever questions he might have about the form or about\nhow to fill it out. You don't require that the court\nmake any findings. You don't require that the court\neven ask any questions.\nApparently, your idea of the procedure is\njust to give a person a form. Am I reading you right?\nMS. KRUGER: No, I don't think you are,\nJustice Kagan. I think that we would say that there are\nthree fundamental requirements for due process in this\narea. The first is both information regarding the\nnature of the inquiry that's going to be made at the\nhearing -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. I'm not\nhearing you. Could you speak more loudly?\nMS. KRUGER: I'm sorry. Certainly.\nThe first is -- as, Justice Sotomayor, you\nreferenced earlier, the first is information in advance\nof the hearing that a critical question to be answered\nat the hearing is going to concern ability to pay and a\nform or other type of procedure that would elicit\ninformation that's relevant to the alleged contemner's\nfinancial condition.\nThe second would be a hearing at which the\nalleged contemner has the opportunity to respond to any\nfurther inquiries that may be triggered by information\nthat's already been provided. This is, I think, a\ncommon feature of many systems outside of South Carolina\nwhich, by case law, have recognized that when a court\nhas concerns that information on a financial affidavit\nmight be misleading or inaccurate, they have a duty to\ninquire further and to require supporting documentation\nas necessary to confirm or dispel concerns about the\naccuracy of the information.\nAnd then, finally, I think we would require\nan express finding that the -- the alleged contemner has\nthe ability to satisfy the purge conditions such that\nthe person can be said, not only theoretically, but also\nrealistically, to have the keys to the jail cell in\ntheir pocket.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, as I -- and\nthen I think one of the deficiencies in addressing your\nargument is that I don't really know what the State's\nprocedures are. Your -- your co-counsel, or Mr. Waxman,\nhas said that there was actually a form. I don't know\nwhat that form looks like.\nThe only thing that does seem missing that\nthe State clearly provides is a requirement that the\njudge explain what the basis of his contempt finding is.\nI'm looking at 60a and 61a, and this judge left it\ncompletely blank. So, is this a due process violation\nfacially, or is this a due process violation as applied,\nmeaning it's just not clear to me whether South -- the\nState's process, in fact, has all of the elements that\nyou're speaking about or how I make that judgment and\nwhether the -- we didn't grant cert on the question of\nwhether, as applied, there was a failure or not.\nI mean, one of the difficulties in this case\nis that there was really very -- no findings by the\njudge whatsoever.\nMS. KRUGER: I think that's right, and I\nthink it's also right that South Carolina, at least\ninsofar as the record reveals, doesn't require a finding\nthat the alleged contemner has the ability to comply\nwith a purge condition, as opposed to requiring a\nfinding of willful violation of the court's order.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, the -- the form,\nthe order for contempt of court itself, 61a, does\nrequire the judge to fill out an answer as to whether he\nthinks the defendant is gainfully employed or has the\nability to make the payments. So, it was just absent\nhere.\nMS. KRUGER: The -- the question on the form\nrelates to a past condition, as opposed to present\nability to comply with a purge condition. So, the two\ninquiries are distinct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why isn't the\nrequirement that the judge satisfy himself that there's\na willful failure to comply with the order? Why doesn't\nthat amount to saying the judge has to satisfy himself\nthat this individual cannot pay, or can pay?\nMS. KRUGER: Justice -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not willful if he can\npay.\nMS. KRUGER: Well, if -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If -- if he can't pay.\nMS. KRUGER: If he can't pay -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You know what I mean.\nMS. KRUGER: I do know what you mean.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. KRUGER: I understand you, Justice\nScalia. I think there are two separate questions, both\nof which concern ability to pay, but one of which is\nretrospective and the other is prospective.\nThe question whether the alleged contemner\nhas willfully violated a child support order is a\nretrospective question. During -- that the -- the\nalleged contemner missed child support payments because\nhe wasn't gainfully employed and didn't have the ability\nto comply. And then the question for purposes of\ndetermining an appropriate sanction is, does this person\nhave the present ability to comply such that sending\nthat person to jail might reasonably be expected to\ninduce them to -- to -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I see.\nMS. KRUGER: -- carry out their financial\nobligation?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, did -- just\nto be clear, your answer to the question presented is\nno, right? It was not error for the South Carolina\ncourt to say there's no constitutional right in this\ntype of a proceeding to appointed counsel?\nMS. KRUGER: That's correct, Mr. Chief\nJustice. We think that there is no categorical right to\nappointed counsel in all civil contempt proceedings\nor -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there a State -- we've\nbeen told that, in many States, appointment of counsel\nfor an indigent, noncustodial parent who has -- who has\nchild custody arrears, that counsel is automatic. You\nhave described something less than counsel. Is there\nany model, any State where there is such a procedure so\none might find out how it's working?\nMS. KRUGER: I don't think that there is any\none place you can look in order to see what features\nStates are employing. We know anecdotally from talking\nto individuals who are responsible for running programs\nin individual States that they do ordinarily, even in\nStates that don't categorically require the appointment\nof counsel, satisfy each of the three procedural\nprotections that I outlined earlier in response to\nJustice Kagan.\nSo, for example, in New Mexico, which hasn't\nrecognized a categorical right to appointed counsel,\nthere is a solicitation of financial information in\nadvance of the hearing. That information is reviewed by\na caseworker, who will make the decision whether or not\nto refer the case to civil contempt proceedings. There\nis a hearing at which further information is explored or\nelicited, and ultimately there's a determination made\nwhether the alleged contemner has the ability to comply.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about an aid who is\nnot counsel? I mean, the family court has a lot of\nauxiliary people like child advocates who are there to\nassist people who need some kind of representation, but\nnot necessarily a lawyer. Is that any part of yours -\nof what you would propose?\nMS. KRUGER: I think it would certainly be\nopen to the Court to consider whether or not having the\nassistance of a layperson who may not necessarily be a\nlawyer would be a requirement of due process, but I\nthink given the nature of the inquiry which goes to\nfinancial condition, it's the kind of information that\nindividuals provide on a regular basis without the\nassistance of either competent lay people or lawyers\nwith legal expertise. It seems unnecessary to satisfy\nthe commands of fundamental fairness in order to create\nthat requirement across the board; in much the same way,\nI think it's unnecessary to appoint counsel in every\ncase, as opposed to taking the modest and relatively\ninexpensive steps that we've outlined in order to ensure\na meaningful opportunity to be heard.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is the form you have in\nmind something different than the form, the IFP form,\nthat would be filled out say, by a 2255 petitioner?\nMS. KRUGER: I don't think it would, Justice\nGinsburg, but precisely what the form would contain\nwould have to be tailored to the law in the relevant\njurisdiction. So, where the determination is made on\nthe basis of assets and income, it would be appropriate\nfor the form to elicit that information. Where in other\njurisdictions the law is clear that the other\ninformation may be relevant to that inquiry, it would be\nappropriate for the form to elicit that information as\nwell. But I think in substance the form would look very\nmuch like the form that this Court sees on a regular\nbasis attached to its petitions for writs of certiorari\nand would also look very much like forms that are\ncommonly applied in jurisdictions across the country in\nchild support programs in order to establish the amount\nof child support obligation in the first place. South\nCarolina employs such a form for that purpose, and I\nthink it would be a relatively trivial matter for South\nCarolina to use a similar form for the purpose of\nenforcement.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Kruger, could you say a\nbit more about the question that Mr. Waxman and Justice\nScalia were talking about: how often these proceedings\nhave the State on one side, how often they have the\ncustodial parent on one side, you know, whether there is\ncounsel for the opposite side in many of these cases?\nMS. KRUGER: There is in some, but not all,\nJustice Kagan. It's true that the State is often,\nthough not always, represented in these proceedings, not\nalways by lawyers as opposed to caseworkers or other\nnonlawyer personnel who work for the departments of\nsocial services.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.\nKruger.\nMr. Bibas.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHANOS BIBAS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. BIBAS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nMrs. Rogers and custodial mothers and\nparents like her need simple, fast, civil procedures to\nprobe fathers' chronic failures to support their\nchildren. Today I'll make two points. First, this case\nis moot. Second, a per se right to appointed counsel is\nnot essential to prevent fundamental unfairness.\nFirst, this case is moot. On remand, there\nis no possible redress for Petitioner. He seeks an\nadvisory opinion but fails to bear his burden of proving\nthat his case will evade review because he could get a\nstay. Litigants must preserve questions by seeking\nstays or supersedeas where available. Only where there\nis no procedure of which Petitioner could have availed\nhimself to stay confinement, because a State statute had\na blanket denial of bail pending appeal, did this Court\nin Sibron find that a dispute could not be stayed and so\nwould evade review.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The South Carolina\nSupreme Court, as I understand, heard this case after he\nwas released, so they didn't consider it moot.\nMR. BIBAS: Your Honor, the issue was not\nbriefed or argued or raised. My client had no lawyer,\nfiled no brief, made no argument. So, we don't know\nwhat they considered or held. They made no reference to\nit.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Suppose -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it was a fact, was it\nnot, that he was already released?\nMR. BIBAS: Yes, that's correct, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose -- we have\nheld, haven't we, that States can have different\nconcepts of mootness than the Federal one?\nMR. BIBAS: Yes, Your Honor, that's right.\nAnd South Carolina deals with this issue -- obviously,\nin this Court the question is an Article III question.\nAnd because the evading review doctrine is an exception\nto Article III's normal requirements that Federal courts\nhave jurisdiction only over live cases or controversies,\nit should be construed narrowly, only where essential to\npreserve review. Here Petitioner didn't ask for a stay;\nif he had asked -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, do we have\njurisdiction over any matter that isn't rendered in a\nfinal judgment in State court?\nMR. BIBAS: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, if we don't have\njurisdiction over anything but a final judgment, how\ncould we ever grant a stay if the State refused to?\nMR. BIBAS: I -- your -- if -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The State refused to\ngrant a stay.\nMR. BIBAS: I -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And why would South -\nwhy would the State here have granted a stay, if it\nbelieves there's no Sixth Amendment right whatsoever to\ncounsel? How could that litigant ever evade mootness?\nMR. BIBAS: Your Honor is correct that the\nrelief would be coming from the South Carolina State\ncourts, and South Carolina ruled 241(c) appears to be\ntailor-made for this situation. And it instructs courts\nto consider whether a stay is necessary to preserve\njurisdiction of the appeal or to prevent a contested\nissue from becoming moot. Our position is -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you point to any\ncase involving support payments in which the South\nCarolina court has ever granted a stay?\nMR. BIBAS: The closest I can point to is\nBerry v. Ianuario, a South Carolina State court case\ninvolving parental termination -- termination of\nparental rights from a family court, where the South\nCarolina Supreme Court stayed the matter. And so, if\nPetitioner had asked, there's a substantial likelihood\nthe court would have granted a stay through the South\nCarolina Supreme Court. At this point, under Rule 23,\nthis Court could affirm a stay.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did the Petitioner know\nabout Rule 23? Where had he learned about that? He\ndidn't have counsel, right?\nMR. BIBAS: He had counsel as of no later\nthan 3 weeks after the trial court hearing. He had\ncounsel for 11 months of his sentence.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, before -- before it\ngot up to the -\nMR. BIBAS: That's right, 11 months before\nthe case became moot.\nOn the merits, a civil contempt case does\nnot, as my adversary suggests, quote, \"sound in criminal\ncontempt\" and require counsel, quote, \"precisely to\nensure that the proceeding remain civil.\"\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it correct for me to\nthink of both the Petitioner's argument and your\nresponse as a Mathews v. Eldridge problem?\nMR. BIBAS: No -- Your Honor, I believe the\nmain argument here, and the only one the Petitioner\nargued in the courts below, is an absolute categorical\nright that any loss of liberty equals an absolute right\nto counsel.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it -- it does seem\nthat absolute right and Mathews v. Eldridge is not quite\na -- a good fit, but it seems to me that most of Mr.\nWaxman's argument can be subsumed within the Mathews v.\nEldridge framework.\nMR. BIBAS: Yes, that is his fallback\nargument, though it wasn't developed in the courts\nbelow, but I think it's important to note that because\nhis argument approaches and, in fact, leads with an\nabsolute claim -- to note the breadth of the rule. So,\npicking up on your question to Mr. Waxman, Justice\nKennedy, it's important to note not only that\nPetitioner's rule would reach other civil contempts\nbeyond child support, but because any loss of liberty is\nthe overwhelming factor in his calculus, it would apply\nto tens of thousands of immigration and extradition\ncases each year.\nPetitioner's reply brief does not deny this,\nsaying only that they might or might not be\ndistinguishable. And immigration, we would submit, is\nan a fortiori from this case. The legal issues there\nare more complex, the deprivation is more severe, the\nconfinement not purgeable. Any ruling --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But just -- just assume\nthat we could somehow block out that category. If you\ncould focus just on the domestic relations support\nproceedings, would there be a basic change in the way\nthose proceedings are being conducted in other States,\nif we ruled in favor of Petitioner and said there's an\nabsolute right?\nMR. BIBAS: Yes, Justice Kennedy, there'd be\na massive change. Trial judges need to know ahead of\ntime which sets of procedures to apply, civil or\ncriminal.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't it -- isn't it true\nthat most States in child support cases, when the\ndefendant says I have no money, will appoint counsel?\nMR. BIBAS: That is not true of most States,\nJustice Ginsburg. My understanding is 15 States\nrecognize it as a constitutional matter, 11 additional\nStates by statute, rule, or practice appear to recognize\na statewide right to counsel. So, there's a bear\nmajority. At least 17 States do not have a statewide\nright, and the remaining 7 are unclear.\nSo, we're talking about reformulating rules\nin a huge number of States that probably affect hundreds\nof thousands of cases. I'd ask the Court to consider\nthe Office of Child Support Enforcement study that's in\nthe appendix to the Senators' brief. It's the best\nempirical evidence we have of how these proceedings\nwork.\nAnd the evidence is relevant both to the\nneed for these procedures in the balancing test Justice\nKennedy refers to, but also the apparent relatively low\nreason to believe there's a large error rate here.\nAccording to that study, many parents -- non-supporting\nparents are cited for contempt and purged of their\ncontempt; many fewer are, in fact, confined. It is -\nappears to be the threat that coerces enforcement and\ndeters violation. Many parents do not pay up until\nafter the contempt hearing and confinement is imminent.\nSo, States would have to appoint counsel in a large\nnumber of cases, most of which wind up purging. So, the\nfirst point to note is that -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the point was\nit's -- it's only if the defendant -- the claim is only\nif the defendant does not have the keys in his pocket\nbecause he has no money. So, in cases where typical a\nrecalcitrant spouse won't pay until he's threatened with\njail, that wouldn't come in this category. I thought\nMr. Waxman was speaking about people who do not have the\nkeys in their pockets because they simply cannot -- they\ndo not have the wherewithal to pay.\nMR. BIBAS: Yes, Your Honor, but very, very\nmany non-supporting parents protest the same. And so,\nit is true that the slice of those brought to civil\ncontempt hearings is only a small fraction of the\noverall caseload.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, and I -- and I\nsuppose you could say that in -- in advance that the\njudge and the appointing authority simply wouldn't know.\nMR. BIBAS: Exactly, Justice Kennedy. Trial\njudges need to be able to protect themselves. They need\nto be able to know when they go into a hearing whether\nto apply civil or criminal procedures, and that's this\nCourt's lesson in Hicks v. Feiock.\nHicks said a judge needs to know ex ante\nbased on a couple of simple rules, quote, \"If the relief\nimposed here is in fact a determinate sentence with a\npurge clause, then it is civil,\" then civil procedures\napply. And if the remedy runs to the injured party,\nthen it is civil.\nBut to -- even cases that have overturned\nerroneous civil contempts, do not, as my brother\nMr. Waxman suggests, become punitive and criminal.\nMaggio and Shillitani recognize that they remain civil.\nShillitani declined to find a right to indictment or\njury trial because it was a civil case.\nTo go back to the -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I -- I took the\nSolicitor General's position to be -- they may accuse me\nof not being accurate in what I took their position to\nbe, which is the rule would be simple. You, a State,\nare free to run these procedures as you choose, but not\nto provide counsel, you have to meet some minimum\nMathews v. Eldridge requirements. And so, the rule is\nsimple. The State can do what it wants, but it has to\nprovide minimum due process, and they've previously set\nforth the three. All right?\nSo really the answer is, no, you're not\nautomatically entitled to a lawyer if you're providing\nminimum due process. If you're not, then you have to\nprovide a lawyer.\nMR. BIBAS: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right? What's wrong\nwith that rule? That, I think, is what the Solicitor\nGeneral is suggesting. So, first, what's wrong with the\nrule? And then, second, in a case in which I did not\nsee and haven't yet a form that really talks about or\ntells the contemptor about his defense and what he needs\nto prove, yes, he did get a hearing but not a hearing\nthat explored his statement that he'd been looking for\nwork and couldn't find it, and a form, a judgment that\ndoesn't address his current ability to pay. How does\nthe South Carolina system comply with those minimums of\ndue process?\nMR. BIBAS: Yes, Your Honor. First, I'll\ntalk about the Solicitor General's suggestions that you\nraise and then talk about the specific procedures here.\nWe think the Solicitor General's suggestions are\ninteresting, they're worth exploring. They were raised\nfor the very first time at the merits stage here; so,\nthere's been no development. We don't know what other\nStates are doing, the range of options out there, the\nnonconstitutional measures which in the criminal context\nfor guilty pleas were developed through rulemaking, Rule\n11, lots of testimony and inquiry. That's appropriate\nfor development when presented and allowing those other\nbodies the first crack at them.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Bibas, I have a\nquestion about -- about the position of the Government\nin this case. The Government agrees with you that you\ndon't need counsel, but says that we ought to reverse\nthe judgment anyway because there were -- because the\nother aspects of due process which the Government\nasserts would make it unnecessary to provide counsel did\nnot exist in this case.\nDid you think, under our ordinary rules,\nwe -- we can do that?\nMR. BIBAS: No, Your Honor, that's beyond\nthe question presented.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Question presented was just\nwhether counsel was necessary, right?\nMR. BIBAS: That's correct. And I\nsuppose -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's fully within the power\nof the Government to say why, you know, in general\ncounsel is not necessary because these other procedures\nare good enough. But then to come forward and say,\nmoreover, those procedures were not applied in this case\nand, therefore, you should reverse, that's -- that's a\nnew point, it seems to me, isn't it?\nMR. BIBAS: Yes, Your Honor, and as Justice\nSotomayor pointed out, that's not what this Court\ngranted certiorari on. And this is a case -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about you -- you\nstressed that this falls on the civil side. So, why\nshouldn't we take Rule 54(d) as our model and say that\ninstructs the court that you give parties the relief to\nwhich they are entitled, even if they haven't asked for\nthat relief, even if they've asked for something that\nthey can't get?\nMR. BIBAS: Justice Ginsburg, I don't\nbelieve this is a question about relief. I believe this\nis a question about what constitutional right is\nimplicated. This case arises from a State court. The\nfailure to raise the issue below is jurisdictional and\nis not -- that issue is not before the -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't know that that\nanswers my question, because the way I phrased the\nquestion was very specific. South Carolina -- there's\nno constitutional right to counsel in every proceeding,\nbut the question presented was whether South Carolina\nerred that an indigent defendant has no constitutional\nright to appointed counsel in any civil contempt\nproceeding. And if the answer to that is, if the civil\ncontempt proceeding does not comply with minimum due\nprocess requirements, counsel is required.\nMR. BIBAS: Your Honor, I respectfully -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Then isn't that an\nanswer to the question presented?\nMR. BIBAS: I don't read the question\npresented that way, Your Honor -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We can argue about that\nlater.\nMR. BIBAS: Okay. Fine.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Okay? The point is -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I would think that the rule\nwould be that if -- if South Carolina has not complied\nwith minimum due process procedures, minimum due process\nprocedures are required, not counsel is required.\nMR. BIBAS: Yes, Justice Scalia. In a case\npresenting that issue, that's the appropriate remedy.\nTo go back to the -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Think of what the\nGovernment says should happen. You should give them a\nform and the form should say do you have money to pay or\nnot. All right. So, what did happen? Did the judge\never ask him?\nMR. BIBAS: Here's what happened, Justice\nBreyer: The rule to show cause, at Joint Appendix 50a,\nsaid in all capital letters \"must bring proof of\nemployment.\" This was Petitioner's sixth hearing. He\nwas familiar with the issues before. At Petition\nAppendix 17a -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Did he bring some proof of\nemployment?\nMR. BIBAS: He did not. He had -\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, why would\nyou put him in jail? He has no job.\nMR. BIBAS: All right. He had -- he\nexplained that he, in fact -- tried to explain why he\ndidn't have the money, that he had been -- both his\ndrugs and 2 months of disability. The judge, on the\nnext page, Petition Appendix 18a -- he heard the\ntestimony, he saw his demeanor, he didn't believe him\nand found him in willful contempt.\nAnd, finally -\nJUSTICE BREYER: You mean he didn't believe\nhim about what? That he had no money?\nMR. BIBAS: That he did not have the money.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So, he -- he thought\nhe did have the money.\nMR. BIBAS: That's our reading of Petition\nAppendix 18a.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do we -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, we couldn't really\ntell, could we, Mr. Bibas? Because he completely\nignored the question. The entire transcript is less\nthan two pages long. Mr. Turner talked about how he had\nno money and he was disabled. The court completely\nignored him. The court also ignored the questions on\nthe form for the order of contempt about whether he had\nany money. The court ignored that as well.\nMR. BIBAS: Your Honor, none of those -- you\nare correct; none of those is filled out. But what I\nwanted to explain is that due process looks at the\ntotality of the State procedures, and the State has\nthree mechanisms in place by which Petitioner, having\ncounsel, could have challenged this. He could have\nchallenged both the factual and legal findings on\nappeal. Family courts repeatedly overturn such\njudgments on appeal.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm actually trying to\nfind -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand all of\nthis discussion. The question presented is not what due\nprocess procedures are required in these cases. That is\nnot the question presented.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Just out of curiosity -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is simply whether\ncounsel is necessary. Isn't that the only matter that\nwe should be discussing?\nMR. BIBAS: Yes, Your Honor. And -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fine, but I'd like to ask a\ndifferent question.\nI'm trying to find out what happened here\nthat was different from what the Government suggests.\nThe Government suggests provide a piece of paper and to\nask certain questions. What I'd like to know is what's\ndifferent in this proceeding from what the Government\nsuggests?\nMR. BIBAS: There was --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That would have -- perhaps\non no one else, but could have an effect on the way I\ndecide the case.\nMR. BIBAS: Yes, Your Honor. There was no\nsuch form provided, and there was not a form -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I understand there was\nno -- look. If he asked the questions orally -\nMR. BIBAS: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- I might be tempted to\nsay it doesn't matter. So, I'm trying to say what\nreally differed from what the Government wants?\nMR. BIBAS: Whether in a form or orally, a\njudge could ask such questions, as Justice Sotomayor\npointed out. There's a form in the appendix.\nWhether -- what happened here or not is not the\nquestion. The record is insufficient because Petitioner\ndidn't develop it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The Government is not a\nparty here, is it?\nMR. BIBAS: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's just an amicus. So,\nthis expansion of the -- of the question presented from\nwhether counsel was necessary to what are the due\nprocess procedures required is all at the suggestion of\nan amicus; is that right?\nMR. BIBAS: Yes, Your Honor. And so, to\nfocus on -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And skip that one. What\nI'm trying to figure out -- and I'm sorry, I may be the\nonly one trying to -- I'm trying to figure out what, in\ngeneral, is the fairness of such situations in -- where\nthe woman is normally the one with the child, the man is\nnormally the one who doesn't pay.\nIs it true, for example, that in most such\nsituations across the country, the woman has a lawyer,\nbut the man doesn't? Is that true or isn't it true?\nThere must be some organization that's studied that.\nMR. BIBAS: Yes, Your Honor. That's -- we\ndon't have good nationwide statistics. What I can say\nis our understanding is that, first of all, Petitioner\nis incorrect in saying that the government has a lawyer\nhere who is prosecuting. He is conflating the clerk of\nthe court issuing a ministerial rule to show cause with\nthe presence of a law-trained prosecutor. That is not\nthe case in South Carolina. That is not the case in\nvery many of the States.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So, the answer to\nwhat I think of, in my own mind only, as very relevant,\nwhether the woman has a lawyer but the man doesn't, is:\nI don't know.\nMR. BIBAS: It -- it is not across the\nboard.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that is the answer? We\ndon't have good information on that?\nMR. BIBAS: We don't have good statistics as\nto how often.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Fine. Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, do you know\nwhy we're not hearing from the State of South Carolina?\nMR. BIBAS: Because the State was not a\nparty to the proceeding.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. I\nunderstand that they were involved below. They decided\nnot to become a party before the State supreme court; is\nthat right?\nMR. BIBAS: Yes, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why aren't they\ndefending their procedures?\nMR. BIBAS: Well -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It may be an unfair\nquestion, since you don't represent the State.\nMR. BIBAS: Right. I don't know. All I can\nsay is Mrs. Rogers went -- anticipating that she would\nreceive child support, Mrs. Rogers went off welfare in\n2003. After that point, the State ceased to have a\ndirect financial interest, and the State has written a\ncouple of letters in the Joint Appendix saying that\nbecause we are not a party to the suit, our financial\ninterest is not directly implicated.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think it would be\na great financial interest if they have to provide\ncounsel in these thousands and thousands of cases.\nMR. BIBAS: That is a -- that is a broader\nsystemic interest, and the State did, in fact, join an\namicus brief to that effect in this case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could I ask a question\nabout your mootness point?\nMR. BIBAS: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You say it's --it's not\ncapable of repetition and yet evading review, because\nshould this happen again, he could get a stay, as he\ncould have gotten in this case.\nDo you have any case of ours which -- which\nuses that reasoning and says the fact that in a future\ncase you may be able to get a stay suffices to establish\nthat this is not capable of repetition yet evading\nreview? It's -- it's a new argument to me. Is there\nany case of ours that applies it?\nMR. BIBAS: The closest is this Court's\ndecision in St. Pierre. A number of lower courts that\nwe cite have also followed St. -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that can't\npossibly be true, because we have cases applying the\nrule that this is capable of repetition, yet evading\nreview. If the rule were you have to get a stay, we\nwouldn't have any of those cases.\nMR. BIBAS: They -- no, Your Honor. In\nabortion cases, election cases, stays are practically\nimpossible. This is a different category of case, where\nstays are available, and those cases also seek\nprospective relief.\nIf I might go back to the financial interest\nthat you pointed out earlier, the reason the State would\ncare here -- it's not that -- there's a State fisc\ninterest that's substantial, but the reason that matters\nto my clients is because the huge fiscal burden here\ncould deter many States from this enforcement. In fact,\nit has.\nIn New Jersey, after the State supreme court\nrecognized in Pasqua a right to appointed counsel, New\nJersey stopped using civil contempt enforcement. When a\nState has to appoint counsel and stops doing so, it\nremoves deterrence in a massive number of cases. That's\na -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we have any -- any\ncomputation about what it would be -- what the counsel\nfee would be, as opposed to keeping someone in prison\nfor a year?\nMR. BIBAS: We don't have those numbers, but\nI also believe that's not the correct inquiry, Your\nHonor, because it's not just the few people who are\nconfined.\nAs I was saying earlier, if the percentage\nof those going to these hearings were actually confined\nis in the single digit percentages, as some of the\nnumbers in the States' appendix suggest, then you're\ngetting a huge leveraging effect of many people being\ncoerced into paying before going into confinement or\nimmediately after going into confinement. So, the State\ncan permissibly weigh those costs and benefits, and\nthat's for the State legislature.\nTo go back to Justice Breyer's question\nearlier about what due process might require, I think\nit's important to focus on that these procedures are\nstraightforward, informal procedures, navigable by\nlaymen. The most natural thing in the world when being\naccused of not paying is to say: But I can't pay. And\nto follow it up with an explanation. I applied for this\njob; I'm out of work; I got sick. There are things\nthat --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Did anybody look at housing\ncourts?\nMR. BIBAS: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, housing courts -- I\nwould think it's fairly common somebody owes somebody\n$25, or whatever it is, the judge says pay it into\ncourt, and what happens if they don't pay it into court?\nMR. BIBAS: We haven't looked at that, Your\nHonor, and I'm sure the same arises in administrative\nappeals and small claims court, any number of places.\nHere it's a simple intuitive issue, and South Carolina,\nlike other States, uses relaxed, informal rules of\nevidence and procedure. There are effectively no rules\nof hearsay or authentication.\nJUSTICE ALITO: There are things the judge\ncould have asked, though, that -- and put on the record,\nand it might have cleared this up. He could have -- the\nPetitioner here said he wasn't working and he couldn't\nwork because he had been hurt, so the judge could have\nasked for medical records to substantiate that.\nAnd then the Petitioner admitted that until\nrecently, apparently, he had been taking meth, he had\nbeen snorting coke. The judge could have said, all\nright, you had the money then to buy those drugs; now,\nwhere did you get that and why do you no longer have\nthat source of money? He could have gone through a few\nsimple steps, couldn't he, to make this -- to eliminate\nthe problems?\nMR. BIBAS: Yes, Your Honor, and whether\nthat's salutary or ought to be considered in a future\ncase, it's not the question here. But that could be\nworth exploring. It is much lower cost than appointing\ncounsel across the board.\nIt's important to note that -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's a little difficult to\nwrite the opinion, if you are to prevail, saying there's\nno absolute right, but there might be in some other\ncase, depending. We don't give much help to the system\nthat way, because it might be that ultimately we would\nfind that the balancing test is more complex than simply\nappointing the counsel.\nMR. BIBAS: I don't believe this Court has\nto do that, Your Honor. In -- in cases such as Gagnon\nand Lassiter, this Court laid out factors, said there's\nno categorical right to counsel, and the lower courts -\nour examination of the post-Gagnon cases suggests most\nof them have said, well, this is a pretty routine case,\n85, 90 percent of the time -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then you do think we\nshould lay out the factors? And, if so, what are the\nfactors?\nMR. BIBAS: I -- I don't believe that it's\nnecessary because we can't conceive of a legal issue\nhere so complex that categorically a lawyer is\nnecessary.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, I don't understand\nhow we could say that if you do not meet minimum due\nprocess procedures, you must meet more than minimum due\nprocess procedures. I mean, once we say that it's\nenough if you do A, B, and C, but this State has not\ndone A, B, and C, how can we say therefore you must\nappoint counsel? All we can say is you must do A, B,\nand C. I don't know of any instance where we impose\nmore than the due process minimum because you have\nfailed to comply with the minimum.\nMR. BIBAS: Yes, Your Honor. Perhaps to go\nback to Justice Kennedy's point, if -- if the Court were\nconcerned about more specific guidance, it could point\nto at least in situations that involve relaxed informal\nrules of procedure, where no rules of hearsay\nauthentication, no jury trials, informal discovery,\njudges handle questioning, no State prosecutor, at least\nthere, there might be no right to counsel.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I just don't\nknow that all those things are properly before us.\nMR. BIBAS: Well, then, the appropriate\nthing is to answer the question that was raised by\nPetitioner in this case and not to go -- no need to go\nbeyond that, I would suggest.\nFinally, let me point out that the closest\nanalogue in the legal system to the question here about\ninability to pay child support is inability to afford\ncounsel. Our criminal justice legal system has\nextensive experience with that under the CJA, the\nCriminal Justice Act. In the Federal system and in most\nStates, the burden is on the defendant to show his\ninability to pay counsel. He doesn't -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Bibas, practically\nwhen those forms are used, the person fills out a form,\nand mostly they're just accepted, aren't they?\nMR. BIBAS: Your Honor, I don't believe\nthey're rubber-stamped. The statistics that I have seen\nshow denial rates of 10 to 20 percent, in some counties\nas high as 35 percent. So, there is a meaningful\ninquiry and meaningful denials, and all of those cases\nwould violate due process on Petitioner's logic. That\ncannot be the tidal wave to hit the criminal justice\nsystem. That is not an appropriate extension of due\nprocess because the issues here and there are simpler,\nfar simpler than in Lassiter, a formal trial-type\nadversarial procedure where nevertheless no categorical\nright to counsel was required.\nIt's important to go back, if one looks at\nthe roots of the right to counsel in Powell and Gideon\nand Zerbst, Powell talked about the need for the guiding\nhand of counsel who are skilled in the science of law in\norder to deal with technical defects in the charging\ninstrument, to deal with incompetent, irrelevant, or\nevidence. In proceedings such as this, where there are\nno formal rules of pleading or evidence, there is not a\nneed -- certainly not a need for a categorical right to\ncounsel.\nIf there are no further questions, may I\nconclude?\nLitigants can themselves argue the\ncommonsense issue of ability to pay, just as they can\naddress their ability to afford counsel without first\nhaving counsel, and the cost of appointing counsel\nacross the board would deter States from enforcing\ncustodial parents' and their children's rights, as it\nhas in New Jersey. Thus, this Court should dismiss for\nwant of jurisdiction or else affirm.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Waxman, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. WAXMAN: I have three points. Thank\nyou, Mr. Chief Justice.\nFirst of all, I mean this -- the crux of\nthis dispute comes down to whether this is some -- akin\nto some sort of simple form that can be filled out that\nany layperson, no matter how uneducated, can deal with.\nSecond, the question is how much of a burden\nis this going to be on the States?\nAnd, third, the question of whether or not\nwhat counsel suggests as the Utah model or what he\ndenigrates as the New Jersey model would be a way to\nsquare this circle.\nFirst of all, counsel says he can't conceive\nof a legal issue that can arise in this case. Let's\njust look at this case as an example. There was\nallegations of -- an admission of drug use. Does or\ndoes that not constitute an inability to pay? That is a\nlegal question. It is not a factual question.\nInability to comply is a legal defense, not a factual\nexcuse.\nThe allegation was he's not employed, but\nmaybe he's not looking for work or he's underemployed.\nIs that inability to comply for purposes of a coercive\ncontempt sanction? That is a legal question.\nOur suggestion is he could be incarcerated\nso that he could be placed on work release in a county\njail program and reduce his arrearage. Is that or is\nthat not a permissible application of a coercive\nsanction of incarceration? The cases that we've seen\nhave said no, but it is an open legal question.\nEven as to the marshaling of evidence, it is\nhis burden not to just say, oh, I can't pay. He\nsubmitted a form that he filed for his disability\npayments that said I have no income and I have a car\nthat's worth $1,500. Did he have to pay that car -\nsell the car to pay or not? That is a legal question.\nIn terms of burden, the State is paying -\nthere are approximately 15 percent of the State's jail\npopulation in any given year that are noncustodial\nparents that are serving terms, in this case two 6-month\nterms and a year term, at the cost -- according to the\nstatistics, at the cost of between 13- and 17,000\ndollars a year. South Carolina, because it refuses to\ncomply with the requirements of the Federal program, has\nalready paid $72 million to the government in fines and\nowes another 10. And if you want to really reduce the\ncost, Justice Kennedy, and make this manageable, take\nthe system that they are applauding in Utah or\ndenigrating in New Jersey. When the court sends out its\norder to show cause, it says: Please fill out this form\nshowing whether you have income, whether you have\nassets, and whether you are unable to hire counsel. If\nthe -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, we don't have the\nSocial Security disability form, but if the judge\ncredited that and accepted that your client is -- was\nunable to work and had only the assets listed on that\nform, would he not then automatically be -- have shown\nthat he had an inability to pay?\nMR. WAXMAN: I think the answer is yes, but\nwe don't know whether the judge even looked at the form,\nand we know from South Carolina law that a mere\nassertion is not the marshaling of evidentiary support\nthat's required to carry the burden.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
