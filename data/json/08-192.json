        "content": "(10:07 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst today in Case 08-192, Abuelhawa v. United States.\nMr. Srinivasan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nA person who purchases a small quantity of\ndrugs for his own personal use commits a misdemeanor,\nnot a felony. The language of section 843(b) does not\ntransform that person into a felon if he uses a phone in\nobtaining his drugs, rather than doing so strictly face\nto face.\nI would like to begin with the text of the\nstatute before turning to the textual history and the\nstatutory context. The language of section 843(b)\ncovers the use of the phone in committing, in\nfacilitating, or in causing a drug felony. That\nlanguage presupposes someone who is causing,\nfacilitating, or committing a drug felony, and with\nrespect to such a person, it makes them guilty of an\nadditional offense in the nature of an aggravated\noffense if they use a phone in their committing,\nfacilitating, or causing a drug felony.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you be specific about\nwho those persons would be? You say not a misdemeanant\ndrug user. So who would be caught in the 843(b)?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It would depend on which\nprong you're referring to, Justice Ginsburg. The -- the\ncommitting prong refers to persons who are committing\nthe underlying drug felony.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: And the facilitating prong\nwould refer to persons who are aiding or abetting the\nunderlying drug felony.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose you had the\ngirlfriend phone and say: My boyfriend needs drugs;\nmeet him at the corner of 3rd and Main. What crime does\nthe girlfriend commit? It seems to me that it's pretty\nclear that she's under 843(b) facilitating.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: She -- she may --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that she\nmay then have committed a felony, and yet it seems to me\nthat her culpability is certainly no -- no greater, if\nyou're talking about your -- the polity of your statute,\nthan the man who uses the drugs.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think I'm speaking\nfirst and foremost about the terms of the statute,\nJustice Kennedy. And to the extent she fits within the\nterms of the statute, it would be because she doesn't\nbenefit from the buyer-seller rule. The buyer-seller\nrule establishes that buyers of drugs aren't aiders or\nabettors of the distribution of drugs, and equivalently\nthey wouldn't be treated as facilitators of the\ndistribution of drugs. Now --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Maybe Justice Ginsburg\nwould like some further illustration, but I thought that\nthat was one illustration in answer to her question.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, I would like to --\nwho does this target? The girlfriend is a good law\nschool exam type question, but in the real world who is\ncovered?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think the classic\ncase of somebody under the facilitating prong would be\nthe classic aider and abettor, for example a lookout.\nIf there were a lookout on the scene of a drug\ntransaction, and they used the communication facility to\ncommunicate with the distributor to let them know that\nbuyers were arriving or that law enforcement was in the\nneighborhood and the person ought to refrain from\nengaging in the transaction for the time being. That\nwould be the sort of person that comes within 18 U.S.C.\n2 as an aider or abettor of drug distribution and would\ncome within 843(b) as a facilitator of drug\ndistribution.\nJUSTICE ALITO: The buyer -- seller rule\nwould prohibit the prosecution of a buyer on the theory\nthat the buyer aided and abetted, aided and abetted the\nseller. But I don't see why it applies here. This is\nnot a situation like that. This is a different crime,\nusing a communications facility in facilitating the\ncommission of a felony.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it deals with the use\nof a communication facility only with respect to persons\nthat are committing, facilitating or causing a drug\nfelony.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is the purpose -- what\nis the purpose of saying who uses a communications\nfacility? Is that purely a jurisdictional hook?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No, I don't think it's a\njurisdictional hook. There would already be Federal\njurisdiction by virtue of the underlying felony, and so\nwhat Congress was concerned with in penalizing the use\nof a phone as in the nature of an aggravated offense is\nthat I think Congress thought that phones were being\nused to make detection of drug trafficking more\ndifficult, and in particular at the level of someone who\nwas at top of the food chain in the architecture of a\ndrug distribution chain, that person was able to avoid\ndetection because they never came into physical contact\nwith drugs and they didn't come into physical contact\nwith the persons who were engaging in the transaction on\nthe street.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You keep talking\nabout phones and you began by saying this covers phones,\nbut this was -- language was added in 1970?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there weren't\ncell phones of the kind you have now. I think this was\ndirected at the beepers, right, when those were around\nthen, or land-based phones or something like that. And\nthe technology has so expanded that the reach of the\nstatute has so expanded in a way that brings in a lot\nmore casual users than was the case before, and I just\ndon't know how that issue of statutory interpretation is\nsupposed to be resolved. Assuming I'm right that the\ntechnology has dramatically expanded the reach of the\nstatute, even if you think it's covered by its terms,\nhow is that issue addressed? What's the right answer\nthere? Is it because the terms still cover it, the\nbreadth has expanded, or because this is something new\ntechnologically that the statute shouldn't be construed\nthat broadly?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No, I don't -- our argument\ndoesn't depend on assuming that cell phone usage was\nsignificant in the 1970s. Even in 1970 the statute\nwould exclude from its sweep buyers of drugs.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I know, but\nlet's assume I don't agree -- let's assume I agree with\nthat only in the context of the 1970s technology.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Uh-huh.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's the answer\nthen?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, if you agree with it\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It reminds me of\nthese old hypotheticals. You know, before you had\nautomobiles, you had to have someone with a lantern walk\nin front of your carriage, and they don't change the law\nand it still turns out to be the law when you're driving\nyour car and it doesn't make any sense.\nIs there a case of ours that says what to do\nin that case, in such a situation of statutory\nconstruction?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I'm not aware of a case\nthat speaks directly to that question, Mr. Chief\nJustice. But our argument doesn't depend on that logic,\nbecause even in 1970 certainly land lines were well in\nuse, and in fact the indications are that that's what\nCongress was principally concerned with in this statute.\nAnd at that time we would make the argument, just as\nnow, a person who used the telephone in buying drugs for\npersonal use wouldn't come within the ambit of the\nprovision because the text of the provision goes to\nsomeone who uses a phone in committing, in facilitating,\nor in causing the commission of a drug felony. And so\nif you're not someone who's facilitating the commission\nof a drug felony in the first place, then you can't be\ncharged as using a phone in facilitating a drug felony.\nThe reason that a buyer for personal use, whether we're\ntalking about 1970 or now, wouldn't be considered a\nperson who is using a phone in facilitating a drug\nfelony is because of the buyer-seller rule. Buyers\naren't aiders and abetters of the felony distribution,\nand by the same token they shouldn't be considered\nfacilitators of felony distribution.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Your argument sort of\nassumes -- more than sort of assumes; it assumes -- that\nfacilitating is the same as aiding and abetting. If\nthey meant aiding and abetting, it's a classic criminal\nlaw term, they could have said aiding and abetting.\nThey didn't. They used a different term, facilitating.\nWhy should I think facilitating means aiding and\nabetting?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: For several reasons, Your\nHonor. First, their definitional equivalence. Black's\nLaw Dictionary defines \"facilitating\" as \"an act of\naiding or helping or making easier,\" and it in turn\ndefines \"aiding and abetting\" as \"to facilitate the\ncommission of the crime.\" So they mean the very same\nthing.\nAnd I don't think there's anything\ntalismanic about the particular formulation \"aiding and\nabetting\" and in fact the Court established that in its\nopinion in Gebardi. That dealt with the Mann Act, which\nbarred transporting a woman for purposes of engaging in\nimmoral acts or aiding or assisting in that\ntransportation or causing the transportation. So that\nstatute uses a different formulation --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but I mean\nit's natural to view the woman in that situation more as\na victim than as someone facilitating the crime.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not sure that\nwould extend to your case.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I don't know -- the\nopinion doesn't stand on the rationale that the woman\nwould be a victim. It stands on the rationale that\nCongress when it defined the primary offense, which is\ntransporting --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but that was the\nsame word. That was \"transporting\" in both instances.\nHere you have \"purchase,\" one, \"facilitating\" with a\ntelephone, two. That's different.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it doesn't use the\nword \"purchase,\" with respect, Justice Kennedy. It uses\nthe words \"commit, facilitate or cause.\" Those are the\nthree persons who come within section 843(b). And in\nprecisely parallel fashion, under 18 U.S.C. 2, a general\naider or abettor provision, that provision applies to\npersons who commit the underlying offense, who aid or\nabet the underlying offense or who cause the underlying\noffense. And that precisely parallel structure\nreinforces that facilitating in 843(b) serves the same\npurpose and means the same thing as aiding or abetting\nand the other words that apply in section --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'll think about it,\nbut I think Gebardi does involve one statute, one act,\ntransportation. This involves two. The underlying\nfelony is the purchase or possession, and the second\nstatute is use of the telephone. So I don't -- I'll\nthink about it, but I don't think Gebardi works.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I don't think that's a\ndistinction that ultimately makes a difference, Justice\nKennedy, for the following reason. This statute does\ndeal both with someone who is involved in the underlying\nfelony and use of the phone on top of that, but it's in\nthe nature of an aggravated offense. It presupposes\nsomebody who is committing, causing or facilitating the\nunderlying drug offense, and then it makes them guilty\nof an aggravated offense if they use a phone in the\ncourse of doing so. So the first question you'd have to\nask is whether the person is committing, facilitating or\ncausing the drug felony in the first place.\nAnd if I could use one hypothetical statute\nto illustrate that. If this statute, instead of saying\nfacilitating, dealt by terms with use of a phone in\naiding or abetting a drug felony, you would still have\nuse of the phone in addition to the underlying drug\nfelony. But the first question I think one would ask in\nlooking at that provision is whether the person who's\naccused of violating the law were aiding or abetting a\ndrug felony.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- this statute does\nnot just apply to facilitating a drug offense. It\napplies to any of the felonies covered by subchapter 2\nof the relevant chapter. I agree, it seems a little\nstrange to have what is a misdemeanor by a buyer\nconverted into a -- into a felony just by use of the\nphone. What other situations under other felony\nprovisions would arise that create a similar oddity? Do\nyou have any in mind?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I don't know that there are\nother provisions that would create a similar oddity. I\nthink this one is particularly anomalous, the use of a\nstatute to penalize somebody who otherwise would be a\nmisdemeanant, except that they use a phone in the course\nof the purchase for personal use.\nThe classic situations in which the statute\ndoes apply which aren't anomalous because they make\nsense given what Congress had in mind, would be the use\nof a phone to facilitate drug distribution, if someone\nwere a lookout again or if someone were a trafficker and\nthey instructed, for example, retail sellers where to go\nto pick up stock, a stock house of drugs.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This really isn't\nthe transformation of a misdemeanor into a felony. It's\na separate, separate activity and an activity that\nfacilitates the commission of a crime. It's much easier\nto carry out your drug distribution business if people\nare calling you on their cell phones than if they have\nto meet you in person or call from a land line.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, two steps to respond\nto that question, Mr. Chief Justice. First, in terms of\nwhether it makes it easier, I think one could say the\nvery same thing in an aiding or abetting prosecution.\nAiding or abetting means the same thing as facilitating,\nand so you could make the argument, I think, that buying\ndrugs and engaging in the sorts of actions that\nnaturally accompany the purchasing enterprise make the\nsale easier, including directing where the sale is going\nto occur and things like that. But we know already that\nbuyers of drugs aren't considered aiders and abettors of\ndrugs for purposes of liability under 18 U.S.C. 2. And\nI think by the same token they shouldn't be considered\nfacilitators of drugs for purposes of section 843(b),\nand with respect -- I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if the -- the defendant\n-- what if the defendant who is a buyer of -- of a\nquantity for personal use does more than simply purchase\nthe drugs? What if information is communicated in the\ntelephone conversation that makes it easier for the\ntransaction to take place or less likely -- less likely\nthat there is -- that the person is going to be\napprehended? Would that person fall within the statute?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I don't think so, Justice\nAlito. I probably would have to know more about exactly\nwhat they did, but if it is a -- if what they did is a\nnormal incident of purchasing, then I think it would\nfall within the buyer-seller rule.\nOtherwise, I think the government under an\n18 U.S.C. 2 prosecution for aider and abettor liability\ncould make precisely the same sorts of arguments. The\ngovernment could argue, for example, that this person\ndidn't just buy drugs. They instigated the purchase\nbecause they made the first phone call. They didn't\naccept the first phone call. They made the first phone\ncall, and so that takes them outside the buyer-seller\nrule.\nBut I don't that argument would work under\n18 U.S.C. 2 because making the first phone call is a\nnormal incident of purchasing. And, of course, someone\nwho purchases drugs for personal use is going to want to\ntake measures to make sure that the purchase goes\nthrough. Their ultimate objective is to get their hands\non the drugs. And so --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This statute doesn't --\nit doesn't differentiate between buyer and seller in\nterms of who makes the call. I gather the purchaser for\nhis or her own use would be just as susceptible to this\nstatute if the dealer called and said: I've got a gram\nof cocaine; I know you're interested in having it.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's -- that's right,\nJustice Ginsburg. It would apply equally in that\nsituation, and from our perspective that points up even\nmore of the anomaly in applying it to this factual\ncontext. And that would equally be the case under 18\nU.S.C. 2.\nOne could draw distinctions between who\nmakes the initial phone call and other sorts of normal\nincidents of the purchasing enterprise. But I don't\nthink, Justice Alito, that because someone engages in a\ndrug -- in -- in a transaction in a way that makes it\nparticularly likely that the purchase is going to be\nsuccessful, that that alone would take you outside the\nbuyer-seller rule.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What would happen in the\nsituation where the person who buys the drug is guilty\nof -- of a felony? It's an instance of felony\npossession. Wouldn't the application of your\nunderstanding of the buyer-seller rule in that situation\nlead to the conclusion that even that person could not\nbe convicted under this statute for facilitating the\ncommission of the felony of sale?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No, I don't think so,\nbecause the buyer-seller rule deals with the\ncircumstance in which the way the person is -- is\nassociated with a felony is they're associated with the\ndistributor's felony. And so what the buyer-seller rule\nsays is that a buyer isn't an aider and abettor of the\nseller's distribution, and I think by the same token\nshouldn't be associated with the seller's facilitation.\nBut in your hypothetical, where the buyer\nhimself is committing a felony because his possession\nbecause of certain characteristics associated with it\nmake it a felony, the buyer himself would be committing\na felony.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, that may -- that may\nbe true, but the buyer there still could not under your\ntheory be convicted of facilitating the seller's felony\nof selling the drugs.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Right, couldn't be\nconvicted of facilitating the seller's felony, but would\nfall within the ambit of section 843(b) in any event\nbecause they would have used the phone in connection\nwith their own felony.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your gloss on this\nstatute makes -- gives rise to some difficult questions\nof proof. What if it's -- I don't know -- ten pounds of\nsomething, and the guy says, well, I was just buying in\nbulk for personal use, like a Costco dealer.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I -- I don't know about\nthat, but -- but I think what I do know is it doesn't\ncreate any greater problems of application than already\nexist under Federal drug laws. Because the Federal drug\nlaws bar both possession for personal use under the\ncivil possession statute, section 844, and possession\nwith intent to distribute under 841.\nAnd so courts and juries and the government\nalready have to make those sorts of decisions, and I\ndon't know that they've been particularly difficult to\nmake. They have to draw a distinction between the sorts\nof quantities and other aspects of the offense that\nbring it within the possession with intent to distribute\nplan or whether the possession is of such a small\nquantity, and there aren't other associated\ncharacteristics of the offense that make it possession\nfor purposes of personal use.\nThat distinction is one that's already\nembedded in the fabric of the drug laws, and we're just\napplying the same distinction for purposes of this\nstatute. I don't think we're making it any more\ncomplicated than it already is.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If the government were to\nprevail here, I assume that it would then as a result\nhave a much larger, more expansive discretion in\ncharging and plea bargaining and -- and et cetera.\nOther than the rule of lenity, is there anything in our\ncases that indicates that we should be cautious about\ngiving the government that authority so that that's an\naid in our interpretation or is that just all within the\nrule of lenity?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it's -- it's\ndefinitely within the rule of lenity, and I think that's\nthe principal place that it's found.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Other than --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: And I don't -- I don't -- I\ndon't know of any background principle that one would\nbring to bear on that other than the -- the normal tools\nof statutory construction that I've already talked about\nin the first place, which is you look at the text, and\nyou look at the statutory history, and you look at the\nstatutory context.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No background principles\neither way on granting the prosecutors vast discretion\nin charging --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think as --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- as it applies to\nstatutory interpretation?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think as a general\nrule we ought to be circumspect about doing that. My --\nmy understanding is that circumspection is given voice\nthrough the rule of lenity. But a background principle\nof particular applicability here is the statutory\nhistory, is the statutory history. And I'm speaking now\nin terms of the enacted statutory text; not legislative\nhistory, but the history of the enacted statutory text.\nAnd what that bears on is not the word\n\"facilitating,\" which is what the buyer-seller rule\nparticularly pertains to, but the word \"felony,\" which\nis another word in the text of the statute. And so\nCongress could have barred the use of a phone in\nconnection with any drug offense, including a drug\nmisdemeanor, but Congress pointedly didn't do so. It\nbarred the use of a phone in connection only with a drug\nfelony. And because it chose to limit the offense to\nthe use of a phone in connection with a drug felony, the\neffect is to exclude from the purview of the statute use\nof a phone in connection with a drug misdemeanor. Now,\nPetitioners --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That was changed in 1970,\nwasn't it? Wasn't the text \"offense\" originally, and\nthen Congress changed it to \"felony\"?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's right, Justice\nGinsburg. Before the Controlled Substances Act, the\ncommunication facility provision barred the use of a\nphone in connection with any drug offense. And in 1970\nin the Controlled Substances Act Congress narrowed its\nreach to encompass only use of a phone in connection\nwith a drug felony.\nSo it excluded use of a phone in connection\nwith a drug misdemeanor, and that's significant in two\nrespects. One is, even without reference to the\nstatutory context of the 1970 Controlled Substances Act,\nit's significant because Congress excluded use of a\nphone in connection with a drug misdemeanor.\nPetitioner used a phone in connection with\nhis misdemeanor simple possession. But under the\ngovernment's argument, the very same conduct by the very\nsame person would be brought back into the fold of the\nstatute. Even though Congress excluded it, it would be\nbrought back into the fold of the statute by recasting\nit as facilitating the dealer's felony.\nAnd the mode of analysis the Court used in\nGebardi and the mode of analysis that underlies the\nbuyer-seller rule to begin with would -- would lead us\nnot to infer that Congress would have intended that\nresult.\nBut in terms of the history and the\nstatutory context which you were alluding to, Justice\nGinsburg, it is significant for that reason, as well,\nbecause the context in which Congress narrowed the reach\nof section 843(b) so that it only encompasses\nfacilitation of a felony and not facilitation of a\nmisdemeanor is one in which Congress in the 1970 act\nsought to extend leniency and afford a chance at\nrehabilitation to drug users.\nAnd that's manifested not in legislative\nhistory but in the statutory text itself, because\nCongress penalized simple possession for personal use as\na misdemeanor, whereas, the receipt of drugs previously\nwas a felony, regardless of the purpose of the\npossession, whether it was for use or for distribution.\nBut Congress did more than that, because in\nimmediately adjacent provisions to the one in which it\nnarrowed simple possession to a misdemeanor, it also\nenacted a provision which is now found in 18 U.S.C.\n3607, which allowed a simple possessor who is a\nfirst-time offender to avoid any conviction at all if\nthey successfully complete a period of probation.\nAnd Congress went further still because it\nalso enacted in another adjacent provision further\nrelief for first-time simple possessors under the age of\n21. With respect to that person, it allowed the person\nto obtain a complete expungement of the criminal records\nassociated with the arrest.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you would have\nlost this case before 1970 because the incongruity on\nwhich you rely --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, the basis --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- didn't exist\nthen?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Yes. Before 1970 it would\nhave been a very difficult climb because -- not only\nbecause the communication facility applied to any drug\noffense, but because simple possession wasn't a\nmisdemeanor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. So the scope\nof this language was changed sub silentio?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It -- it wasn't sub\nsilentio. It was explicit.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know, but this\nlanguage, \"facilitating,\" covered purchasers using a\ntelephone in the period before 1970, but not after 1970,\nbecause of the changes in some other sections?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No, well, it's in part\nbecause of the changes in this section. This section\nchanged from \"any offense\" to \"felony,\" so it's the text\nof this section itself. And the buyer-seller rule\nequally applied in -- before 1970. It's just that\nbefore 1970 you wouldn't have had to show that the buyer\nwas associated with the seller's felony, because the\nbuyer was associated with his own offense and that was\nenough, because at that point the buyer's offense was a\nfelony. And then the law, section 843(b), didn't care\nwhether it was a felony because it applied to any drug\noffense.\nIt's only after 1970 that this distinction\nbecomes important, because after 1970 it's clear that\nthe buyer for personal use doesn't use a phone in\ncommitting a drug felony. What he's committing is a\ndrug misdemeanor. So you have to find some way, if\nyou're the government, to make him associated with the\ndrug felony. And to say that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That question goes\nto whether or not the distribution was a felony.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Right, which is the only\navenue available after 1970. There was a different\navenue available before 1970, because before 1970 a\npurchaser of drugs would, if they used a phone in\nconnection with their purchase, would have used a phone\nin connection with a drug offense, and now the statute\nis different in two respects. One, it only covers use\nof a phone in connection with a drug felony; and two, in\nanother provision, Congress narrowed the simple\npossession offense from a mis -- from a felony to a\nmisdemeanor.\nAnd Congress did so with respect to the\nhistorical context in immediately adjacent provision.\nIt narrowed 843(b) in an immediately adjacent provision\nto the one in which it provided that the simple\npossessor could avoid any conviction at all and the one\nin which it provided that a youthful offender could\nobtain a complete expungement of its records. And --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You didn't -- I haven't\nheard you question so far the government's rationale,\nthe reason Congress did this is it's more difficult to\ndetect a drug deal when it's by telephone than if it\nwere an encounter on the street or in an apartment. You\nhave not questioned that?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No, we don't question that,\nYour Honor, but I would like to make two points with\nrespect to that. First of all, it may be more\ndifficult -- the use of the telephone may be more\ndifficult, and that may be the animating purpose that\nCongress sought to address through this provision. But\nthat purpose is substantially served even in the context\nof this case, because --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand what\nyou're saying. The use of a phone may be more\ndifficult?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Use of a phone may make\ndetection more difficult, and that may be the animating\npurpose -- excuse me. That may have been the animating\npurpose behind the enactment of this provision. But\nthat purpose is substantially served, even if you accept\nour understanding of the statute on the facts of this\ncase, because the seller comes squarely within the terms\nof section 843(b). So because the seller comes within\nthe terms of section 843(b), the statute is already\noperating against the seller's use of a telephone.\nThe question in our case is whether the\nbuyer also comes within the ambit of section 843(b).\nAnd because section 843(b) presupposes someone who is\ncommitting, facilitating or committing a drug felony,\nthe buyer doesn't come within the reach of section\n843(b) because he's not committing, causing or\nfacilitating a drug felony in the first place. The\nseller may be, but the buyer is not. The statutory\npurposes are still served by virtue of penalizing the\nseller.\nIf the Court has no further questions, I\nwould like to reserve the balance of my time for\nrebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Miller.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. MILLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nSection 843(b) prohibits the use of a\ncommunication facility in causing or facilitating the\ncommission of any act constituting a felony under the\nControlled Substances Act. The court of appeals\ncorrectly held that the statute is violated when a\nperson uses a communication facility such as a telephone\nto purchase controlled substances unlawfully. A call to\norder drugs both causes and facilitates a felony\ndistribution of drugs.\nThere's no basis in the statute for creating\nan exemption for people who facilitate or cause felony\ndistributions by purchasing drugs for their own personal\nuse.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So two people across\nthe park, they know there's a drug dealer on the other\nside, the one waves and the dealer comes over, the other\ncalls on the cell phone and the dealer comes over; the\nother gets four more years? The phone user gets four\nmore years?\nMR. MILLER: The phone -- the phone user is\nexposed to four more years. There's no mandatory\nminimum --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Suppose he calls\nthree times. He's exposed to 12 more years, right?\nMR. MILLER: That's right. Congress -- I\nmean, those two cases are different and Congress made\nthe judgment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not just that, he gets a\nfelony on his record. Before that he would have had\njust a misdemeanor; right?\nMR. MILLER: That's right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The call -- does the call\nhave to be completed -- I mean, if he gets an answer\nsaying \"Your call is important to us, but we're serving\nsomeone else\"?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MILLER: If the call -- the statute\nrequires that the communication facility be used. And\nif the call doesn't actually go through, it would be\ndifficult to see how you would use the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if he leaves a\nmessage?\nMR. MILLER: If he leaves the message and\nthe message in some way causes or facilitates a felony\ndrug distribution, then, yes, he has used the\ncommunication facility.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In this case we have two\nseparate episodes, each involving one gram of cocaine?\nMR. MILLER: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And there were a total of\nseven phone calls?\nMR. MILLER: There were six. The government\ndismissed one of the counts. It was six counts that\nwent to trial, six phone calls.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So that would be an\nexposure --\nMR. MILLER: Of 24 years.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: 24 years for the one gram\nof cocaine on two occasions.\nDo you agree that it doesn't make any\ndifference who initiates the call? That is, if the\nseller says -- seller calls the buyer, and says, I\nunderstand that you are in the market for one gram of\ncocaine, I'll sell it to you, is the buyer similarly\nsubject to this statute?\nMR. MILLER: Just getting that call by\nitself wouldn't subject someone to the statute. But if\nyou get the call and then engage in a conversation --\nJUDGE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. MILLER: -- with the dealer where you\nare using the telephone to cause --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, we are assuming the\npurchase is made in either case.\nMR. MILLER: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So what you're saying is\nit doesn't matter who initiates the call?\nMR. MILLER: That's right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, what do you do --\nthis case that I find pretty close to what we have here\nis Rewis v. United States, which involved a statute that\nprohibited interstate travel with the intent to, quote,\n\"promote, manage, establish, carry on or facilitate\"\ncertain kinds of illegal activities, one of which would\nhave been gambling.\nAnd we said the ordinary meaning of this\nlanguage suggests that the traveler's purpose must\ninvolve more than the desire to patronize the illegal\nactivity. So it wouldn't have been facilitating a\ngambling operation simply to be engaging in interstate\ntravel for the purpose of playing the tables.\nMR. MILLER: I think there are a couple\nanswers to that, Your Honor. First, Rewis, as you say,\nwas construing the Travel Act. It didn't focus on the\nword \"facilitate,\" and it certainly didn't set out a\ngeneral --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, it certainly focused on\nthe word \"facilitate.\" That was the whole purpose of\nthat passage. It said -- it quoted \"promote, manage,\nestablish, carry on or facilitate,\" and the ordinary\nmeaning of this language suggests the traveler's purpose\nmust involve more than the desire to patronize the\nillegal activity.\nMR. MILLER: That's right, and -- and as --\nas indicated by the passage you've just quoted, the\nfocus of the Court there was on the traveler's purpose.\nThe Travel Act requires intent. Section 843(b) is\ndifferent in that it's satisfied by knowingly or\nintentionally using the phone.\nSo the Court in Rewis said, quite\nreasonably, that someone whose only purpose is to be a\ncustomer of an unlawful enterprise doesn't have the\nintent to facilitate -- and significantly, although the\nCourt's quotation of the statute ends at \"facilitate,\"\nit's not just to facilitate any unlawful activity; it's\nto facilitate the promotion, management --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Don't you think that the\n\"knowingly\" in this statute also requires that you are\nknowingly facilitating?\nMR. MILLER: It does require.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So this is the same\nthing here.\nMR. MILLER: But it doesn't have to be -- it\ndoesn't have to be that you have the purpose of\nfacilitating the seller. It's sufficient that you know\nthat the seller's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, this didn't\nmention -- this statute didn't mention purpose, either,\ndid it?\nMR. MILLER: It -- it said \"intent.\" It\ndoes not include the word \"knowledge,\" and the Court in\nthe passage you just read construed that to require an\ninquiry into the traveler's purpose.\nIt's also significant --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I find it pretty close, I\nreally do.\nMR. MILLER: Well, one other difference,\nthen, Your Honor, is that the facilitation that has to\ntake place under the Travel Act is facilitation of the\npromotion, management, establishment or carrying on of\nunlawful activity, which is defined not as a discrete\ncrime but as a business enterprise involving gambling.\nSo you have a statute that's focused on sort of\nmanagement or direction of an ongoing enterprise,\nwhereas here under 843(b), it's sufficient to facilitate\na discrete act.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why are you going through\nall this sort of parsing, I mean, looking at the\nlegislative history as well as the statute in 1970?\nWhat is your answer to the last point that they made,\nthat what Congress wanted to do was to make simple\npossession a misdemeanor, that's why they changed the\nword, which -- \"offense\" to \"felony.\" That's why they\nchanged the word \"felony\" to \"misdemeanor.\"\nAnd I can't imagine why else they amended\nthe statute, and just because I was curious I looked it\nup, and that's why they amended it, right. So -- so the\nlegislative history makes that clear.\nSo what you've done is figure out a way --\nthe government's figured out a way to do the opposite of\nwhat they want, to take people who simply possess and\ntransform it into a felony. Now, what justification is\nthere in the law for doing that?\nMR. MILLER: Well, I think there are a\ncouple of answers to that. First is that section 843(b)\ndoesn't apply to people who simply possess. It applies\nto people who possess by using a phone to facilitate a\nfelony distribution. And Congress -- I mean, the very\nexistence of the statute demonstrates that Congress\nthought that the use of a phone is a separate element\nthat introduces a distinct evil that Congress wanted to\ncombat. And as to the change in the felony language --\nJUSTICE BREYER: As to the first, I said\nsubset. I didn't say you undermined the entire statute.\nI said you took a subset of people who simply possessed\nand that subset you transformed into felons. Now, your\nresponse I guess is just what you said.\nMR. MILLER: Well, yes --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- second.\nMR. MILLER: -- and also that the reason for\nthe -- as you know, as you know, the predecessor to\n843(b), which was section 1403, referred to causing or\nfacilitating any offense. All of the enumerated\noffenses were felonies. In 1970 they changed the word\n\"offense\" to the word \"felony.\" But that's part of the\nreason for that. There is no legislative history\nspecifically addressing the reason for that change. But\npart of the reason we can infer is that the 1970 statute\ncreated a whole host of misdemeanors, of misdemeanor\nregulatory offenses under the Controlled Substances Act.\nSo one good example is section 829, which prohibits\ndistributing a controlled substance without a\nprescription, and that's an offense -- that's a\nmisdemeanor, and that could easily be caused or\nfacilitated over the phone, if somebody called a\npharmacist.\nAnd so, where both parties to the\ntransaction are only engaging in a misdemeanor, that's\nsomething that 843(b) would not apply to.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But we do know that --\nthat Congress drew a line it hadn't drawn before between\nthe own-purpose users and people who were in the\ntrafficking business, and it expressed sympathy for\nthe -- or leniency, a policy of leniency.\nBut the difference between the\nclassification felony and misdemeanor is huge in terms\nof consequences for a person's life. So let's take the\ndefendant in this case. If he becomes a felon rather\nthan a misdemeanant, even if it's his first time and\nit's only one gram, he loses a lot of rights, doesn't\nhe?\nMR. MILLER: Yes. Yes, that's right. But I\n-- and I think -- but one other change that Congress\nmade to 843(b) in 1970 that's significant is that it\neliminated the mandatory minimum. There was under the\npredecessor --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but I'm speaking\nabout the post consequences.\nMR. MILLER: Yes. Yes. It --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Like -- let's take a\nyoung person. It has an effect on student loans,\ngovernment loans?\nMR. MILLER: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And it may be that in\ncertain States voting rights are removed, and there is\non this person's record forever that he is a felon. It\njust seems odd that Congress would have at one and the\nsame time, the same statute, say, we want these -- to\ngive these people a chance and if they are in a\nrehabilitation program and they make it they won't even\nget any charge, not even a misdemeanor charge, and then\nsay, but a whole group of them are going to be treated\njust like traffickers if they use a telephone.\nIt's hard -- these two would seem to be\nworking at odds with each other. So mustn't the Court\nthen try to reach some accommodation, some harmonization\nof these two provisions? And it's suggested that we do\nthat by saying facilitation, causing in this context\nmeans the same thing as aiding and abetting, then we\nhave the buyer-seller rule for the aider and abettor,\nand then we have made these two provisions harmonious.\nMR. MILLER: I think the buyer-seller\nprinciple and the limitation on aiding and abetting and\naccessory liability, as this Court recognized in\nGebardi, doesn't apply here; because the principle that\nthe Court set out in that case, and it has been\nrecognized in subsequent cases, is that -- is that when\nCongress criminalizes or punishes one party to a\ntransaction, that inevitably involves a second party.\nThe second party who is left unpunished by the statute\ndoesn't get swept back in under section 2 as an aider\nand abettor.\nThat principle doesn't apply here because\nalthough the existence of a purchaser or a receiver of\ndrugs is an inevitable incident of a distribution, the\nexistence of a purchaser who uses a phone is not. The\nwhole point of this statute is that the use of a phone\nis a separate and distinct element that introduces a\ndifferent evil and that Congress wanted to combat that.\nThe other -- the other reason that aiding and\nabetting --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Except that the use of a\nphone in this statute is applied to the seller as well\nas to the buyer. I mean, it seems to me it is parallel:\nuse of a phone to commit the offense by the seller, and\nyou want us to similarly sweep in the facilitating of\nthe offense by the use of the phone by the buyer. It\nseems to me pretty parallel to what we've done in the\nbuyer-seller rule.\nMR. MILLER: The -- the statute -- but by\nits terms makes clear that the person using the phone\nand the person committing the felony don't have to be\nthe same person, and I think -- I understood Petitioner\nto acknowledge that. The statute doesn't say knowingly\nor intentionally use a communication facility in causing\nor facilitating his or her commission of a felony.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there another example in\nthe law, anywhere in the law, where -- and there may be,\nI'm asking -- which you've come across, where we have an\nillegal business and there is a customer; and all the\ncustomer does is be a customer; and is there an example\nwhere just because he's a customer in a statutory\nprovision that normally has a lesser penalty -- all\nright; imagine those circumstances -- you still can\npunish him as if he -- as if he ran the business?\nMR. MILLER: I'm not aware of any, and I\ndon't think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not aware, and why\nshould this be the first?\nMR. MILLER: But this -- this isn't one,\nBecause this isn't a case that punishes people just for\nbeing a customer. It's a case -- it's a statute that\npunishes people for being a customer -- and using a\nphone.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The way they're a customer\n-- the way they're a customer is they use the telephone,\nand I guess one side thinks that's not a big deal, and\nthe other side thinks that, anyway, in terms of what\nCongress thought, it's a tremendously big deal because\nCongress was really worried about telephones. Okay,\nthat's possible.\nSo can you get a parallel that's like that?\nMR. MILLER: There are -- there's a whole\nhost of statutes that punish --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What one comes to mind?\nMR. MILLER: I mean, the wire fraud statute\npunishes conduct that might not be a Federal offense at\nall, but for the fact that somebody used --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's jurisdictional.\nWhat I'm looking for is there's a business and a\ncustomer, the statute punishes the business worse than\nthe customer. Now, we get the customer as if he were a\nbusiness participant. That's what I'm looking for,\nwhere it's the way he does it -- i.e., whether he uses a\ntelephone or whether he uses a telegram or semaphore\nsignals or -- where the -- where the means of\ncommunication here or something like that suddenly\ntransform him?\nAnything else that comes to mind? I didn't\nexpect there to be, but I just thought maybe you would\nthink of an analogy, which would be helpful.\nMR. MILLER: Well, I mean, if -- we\nidentified on page 25 of our brief, a number of statutes\nwhere the use of a communication facility is an element\nof the offense, and the conduct covered by those\nstatutes in many cases might not be a Federal offense at\nall.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Carry -- carrying a\nweapon. A lot of statutes punish more severely for\ncarrying weapons.\nMR. MILLER: Right. And I think, to be\nclear, this is not -- this is not a statute that\npunishes people, punishes customers as if they were\ndistributors or that aggravates an underlying felony.\nThis is a separate offense; it has its own penalty; it\nput the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But it -- can you tell me,\nhow does it work? The district -- the United States\nAttorney in one State, one district, has a case like\nthis where there are four different phone calls; and he\ndoesn't like the looks of the defendant, or for some\nreason he can charge him, and in the neighboring\njurisdiction the United States Attorney does not. Are\nthere guidelines? Does the Department of Justice\ncontrol this in each case? Is there some manual where\nwe could see what the rules are for charging? Is it all\nat the discretion of the United States Attorney?\nMR. MILLER: Yeah. I'm not aware of\nanything in the U.S. Attorney's Manual that specifically\naddresses this statute, but of course the Court\nrecognized in Batchelder that prosecutors legitimately\nhave discretion when there are different criminal\nstatutes that cover the conduct, and --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the -- the\nstatement that in the manual -- maybe this is\nincorrect -- but that the charging policy of the\nDepartment of Justice instructs prosecutors to charge\nthe most serious offense supported by the facts? And if\nthat's true, then the Assistant U.S. Attorney would have\nno choice. The most serious offense is not misdemeanor\nsimple possession, but it is the violation of 843(b).\nMR. MILLER: That's if they bring charges at\nall, and of course that policy doesn't require\nprosecutors to -- to bring charges.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ordinarily --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I think we know from this\ncase they're likely to bring charges.\nMR. MILLER: Well, I mean --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that the policy, first\nof all? It says that they're supposed to charge the\nmost serious offense supported by the facts?\nMR. MILLER: Yes, and -- and a --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So that means in every\none of these cases, whether the dealer picks up the\nphone or the buyer picks up the phone for a transaction\nfor one gram of cocaine, the prosecutor has no choice\nbut to indict under 843(b)?\nMR. MILLER: Well, again, if -- if there is\nto be an indictment at all. There's no requirement that\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm talking about the\nchoice between misdemeanor, simple possession\nmisdemeanor, or 843 -- adding on this 843(b). The\nprosecutor -- if what I read is correct -- has no\ndiscretion, has to if he makes the charge. He cannot\nmake a simple misdemeanor charge. He has to charge the\nfelony.\nMR. MILLER: That's my understanding of the\npolicy, but, you know, this Court has recognized that,\nyou know, that sort of charging decision is a legitimate\naspect of the system as long as it's not exercised for\nunconstitutional reasons.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but there's -- there's\na difference here, and that is, as these cases\nillustrate, three phone calls for one trifling sale, two\nfor another, this gives a kind of multiplier effect\nwhich it's -- it's hard to find a parallel for in the\nlaw. We go from a misdemeanor to 12 years, depending on\nthe fact that there were -- there were a couple of cell\nphone calls.\nThat is -- maybe -- maybe that is exactly\nwhat Congress intended, and maybe that's good law\nenforcement policy, but those are not sort of two\nintuitively obvious positions.\nMR. MILLER: I think the -- the text of the\nstatute and the fact that it covers any act constituting\na felony does demonstrate that that's what Congress\nintended as well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what about the\nquestion?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let's feel sorry for this\n-- for the felon who is selling this stuff, too. I\nmean, the same thing is true of him, isn't it? Every\ntime he makes another phone call he gets socked with\nanother how many years?\nMR. MILLER: The -- the statutory maximum is\nfour, but again --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, so four times four\ntimes four every time he makes a phone call.\nMR. MILLER: Right, and I think that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We should feel sorry for\nhim, too.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: He knows -- the difference,\nthat -- he knows that he's committing a felony, and the\npossessor of a gram or less doesn't.\nMR. MILLER: The possessor who purchases the\ndrugs using his phone knows that he is causing the\nfelony. The reason he calls the drug dealer is because\nhe wants to cause the dealer to send him drugs.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what about the\nlegislative history? Because I would read it -- and in\nfact what it seems to me that you're suggesting, when\nyou read the statute, is using a telephone is -- because\nJustice Kennedy came up with a good example of what I\nwas thinking of. If the buyer sits there with a gun,\nwell, that's different, he shouldn't have the gun, and\nit's not surprising that he gets a higher sentence. And\nyou're saying by reading the text you've discovered\nCongress thinks that cell phones are sort of like guns.\nOkay. I grant you somebody might have thought that.\nJustice Souter thinks it's not intuitively obvious, but\nis there any legislative history that suggests that that\nindeed is what people in Congress thought when they\npassed this statute? I'll read it if there is.\nMR. MILLER: Yes, and it --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And what should I read and\nwhere exactly --\nMR. MILLER: I mean, beyond -- first of all,\nthe -- the Congress has a traditional interest in\nkeeping the channels of commerce and communication free\nfrom --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Normally, where that is\ninvolved, I've learned, it's called what Justice Scalia\ncalled it \"a jurisdictional hook.\" They don't think the\nunderlying behavior is worse, but they believe there has\nto be a basis and should be a basis for federal\nprosecution. I started out where he was. I thought\nthis is just a jurisdictional hook, but now you say no,\nit isn't; it's much worse than that. It's like carrying\na gun, not quite as bad as that, but on that -- in that\ndirection. So I'm asking you what would I read in this\nhistory to show that what you're claiming is right?\nMR. MILLER: The legislative history of the\n1956 act, which is the -- where the predecessor statute,\n1403, was enacted, shows that Congress was concerned\nwith the ability of drug traffickers and people engaging\nin drug transactions to avoid detection by using the\nphone --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that's what -- you've\ncited that in the brief so I can find it?\nMR. MILLER: Yes. And the initial proposal\nin the initial Senate bill would have allowed\nwiretapping in connection with drug investigations of\ncertain enumerated offenses that covered both purchasers\nand sellers. That was replaced with the provision that\nbecame 1403, which also -- which applied \"causing or\nfacilitating\" enumerated offenses, and again applied to\nboth buyers and sellers. And that statute was applied\nto buyers in a number of reported decisions before 1970,\nand there is nothing in the 1970 legislative history\nthat Congress intended to change that aspect.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How does it work? I\nmean, I know your overall rationale about the ease of\ndetection -- easier to detect face to face encounter on\nthe streets. But here, I mean, we know that the\ngovernment tapped the dealer's phone, and that's how the\ngovernment got the list of the people who bought from\nthe dealer. How common is it that -- the either the\nbuyer or the seller is the subject of a telephone tap?\nMR. MILLER: I don't -- I don't know the\nstatistics on that, but certainly a wiretap is only\npossible when demanding standards under Title III are\nmet, and -- whereas a face-to-face meeting can be\nobserved by anybody who happens to be there.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But what had to be met in\nthis case in order to put this tap on the dealer's\nphone?\nMR. MILLER: Well, among other things, I\nbelieve the statute requires some showing that it's not\npossible to obtain evidence in some other less intrusive\nway. So in this case there was a wiretap on the\ndealer's phone, but in a lot of cases there's not going\nto be that. And certainly Congress, when it enacted the\nstatute, viewed keeping people from using the phones to\nconceal their drug transactions as one way of minimizing\nthe need for more intrusive measures like wiretapping.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you would interpret\nCongress -- now we're getting away from '56, when simple\npossession was a felony, to '70, when simple possession\nbecomes a misdemeanor. And you're saying that Congress\nmeant to relegate the simple possessor to misdemeanor\nstatus, but only if the encounter was face to face. So\nyou're reading into the -- what Congress did to sharply\ndistinguish between traffickers and users, and say but\nthat was only taking 843(b) into account. That benefit\n-- that you're not going to be a felon; you're going to\nbe a misdemeanant -- is only for face-to-face\ntransactions.\nMR. MILLER: For -- it's -- I mean, it\ndoesn't apply when -- when a communication facility is\nused. It also doesn't apply, I mean, in a number of\nother contexts that Petitioner acknowledges. But --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I'm talking about\nthis context, the purchase of one gram of cocaine on one\noccasion, nothing more.\nMR. MILLER: As a first offense. I mean,\nthat --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So Congress's design was\nwe treat as a less grave offender the buyer for his own\nuse, but only if he buys in a face-to-face encounter.\nThat's what -- what you would have to read -- you would\nhave to limit the line Congress drew between\ntraffickers, on the one hand, and possessors for their\nown use, on the other, that it applies only to drugs\npurchased in face-to-face encounters.\nMR. MILLER: Yes, although I wouldn't\ndescribe it as an issue of a less grave offense or a\nmore grave offense in the sense that the use of the\nphone aggravates the offense of possession.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I mean, practically\n--\nMR. MILLER: But the use of a phone is the\ndifference --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the difference between\nbeing labeled a misdemeanant and being labeled a felon\nis an enormous difference.\nMR. MILLER: That -- that's right. But\nCongress, again, did recognize that there could be a\nrange of levels of culpability associated with the\n843(b) offense, which is part of the reason that it\neliminated the mandatory minimum when it amended the\nstatute in 1970, suggesting that there could be\ndifferent kinds of conduct that would satisfy it.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Miller, in answer to\none of Justice Breyer's earlier questions, he -- the\npremise of his question was the effect of the twin\namendments from offense to felony and from felony to\nmisdemeanor for possession of small quantities. And he\nsaid, well, in effect, is that combination of amendments\nreally being rendered nugatory by the view that you take\nof the statute? And you said not necessarily, and you\nsaid there may be some drug transactions in which it is\na misdemeanor on both sides, so that the statute would\napply there.\nAre there any other -- are there many\nexamples of that? I thought not. And are there any\nother examples of misdemeanor-misdemeanor cases that the\n-- that the statute would apply to so that -- so that\nthe anomaly wouldn't be quite so obvious?\nMR. MILLER: Well, I mean, if you're asking\nother misdemeanor offenses under the Controlled\nSubstances Act --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. MILLER: I mean there is the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, how\nimportant is this? It looks to us -- I mean, I think it\nwas the premise of the question and it was -- it was my\nassumption coming in that your view of the statute\nlargely renders those two amendments, or the combined\neffect of those two amendments, virtually nugatory.\nAnd you said, well, not necessarily because\nthere may be misdemeanor cases. And I want to know how\nmany of them there are. Is that really a significant\narea for the application or nonapplication of this\nstatute?\nMR. MILLER: I -- I don't know how many\nprosecutions are brought under those statutes. I\nimagine that, in part because they are misdemeanors, not\na lot of prosecutions.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: How many separate -- how\nmany misdemeanor-misdemeanor combined offenses are there\nunder the -- under the code?\nMR. MILLER: 842, section 842, enumerates I\nthink it is on the order of a dozen or so, and then we\ncite a couple of them in our brief. So distributing a\n-- a controlled -- a prescription drug without a\nprescription would probably be one of the most common\nthat someone would engage in.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You -- you don't have any\nfigures on the number of actual prosecutions under --\nunder the -- in the misdemeanor-misdemeanor combination\ncases?\nMR. MILLER: No. I mean, again, because --\nbecause they're misdemeanors and prosecutorial resources\nare probably concentrated on the more serious felony\nviolations of the Controlled Substances Act, I suspect\nthere aren't a lot of prosecutions.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So -- well, then, I guess\nthat leads to my last question, and that is: Isn't it\nprobably true that if we accept your view of the\nstatute, then the effect of those two combined\namendments, offense to -- to felony, felony to\nmisdemeanor for small quantities, the -- the combined\neffect of -- of those two statutes is, in effect,\nrendered worthless in -- in most cases? In a\nsubstantial number of cases to which the -- the\ncommunication facility statute would be applied, it --\nit would render those -- those two amendments, in\neffect, worthless?\nMR. MILLER: Well, I think the -- the\nrelevant inquiry is: What -- what did Congress intend\nin 1970 when it changed the statute?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That may be a legitimate\ninquiry, but what about my irrelevant inquiry?\nMR. MILLER: Well, I --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It's going to -- your --\nyour view of the statute is going to render those two\namendments virtually dead letters?\nMR. MILLER: I mean I -- I think -- I think\nfrom the perspective of -- of Congress, that there was\nno -- they wouldn't have anticipated that the amendment\nwould not have any consequence. I mean the fact that --\nthat they created this whole set of misdemeanors, the\nfact that they aren't violated very often --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: As you said, you -- you\ndon't have figures on the number of prosecutions. And\nthe number of prosecutions under those misdemeanors, as\ndistinct from the number of applications of the\ncommunications statute to conventional buyer/seller\ntransactions is probably the difference between a very\nsmall set and a very large set of cases. And in the\nvery large set of cases the two amendments are being\nrendered, in effect, worthless; isn't that true?\nMR. MILLER: If I -- if I may answer, my\nunderstanding is that the number of prosecutions under\n843(b) is -- is also relatively small, but I don't have\nprecise figures on -- on the comparative numbers.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nFour minutes, Mr. Srinivasan.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nThe only point I would make in closing,\nunless the Court has further questions for us, is that\nwe think the statutory text, the statutory history, and\nthe context all weigh in favor of our reading. But even\nif there is any ambiguity on the matter, principles of\nlenity would squarely apply in foreclosing an\ninterpretation that converts someone who is a\nmisdemeanant into someone who is exposed to multiple\nfelony counts carrying substantial criminal\nconsequences.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question as\njust a matter of history? Is it perfectly clear? I\nthink you said that the -- the presence of the use of\nthe telephone was not just a jurisdictional hook.\nBecause back in 1970 the Federal Government really\nwasn't in the criminal law business the way it has\nbecome in the last 30 or 40 years.\nAt that time there was a lot of concern, the\nTravel Act and other statutes, about exactly what the\nFederal justification for -- justification for Federal\nparticipation existed. And I -- I always had the\nimpression that that was really what was behind the\ntelephone aspect of this statute.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I don't think so, Justice\nStevens, because as of 1970 there were already\nunderlying drug laws that barred distribution, that\nbarred receipt of drugs, and that barred most of the\nactivities that are now prohibited under the drug laws.\nAnd the telephone law presupposes that one of those\nunderlying acts is already going on.\nAnd so to the extent that there was\njurisdiction over those underlying acts, which\npresumably there was since the statutes are on the\nbooks, the Telephone Act wasn't necessary to create\njurisdiction.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you this\nquestion? I -- I understand your argument regarding\nstatutory history and the harsh consequences of this.\nBut as far as the buyer/seller rule -- Gebardi and Rewis\nare concerned, what if the statute said -- made it a\ncrime for -- for a person to use a machine gun in\nfacilitating the commission of a felony? Would you say\n-- you would have to say that the buyer/seller rule and\nthose authorities would mean that that person could not\nbe prosecuted if they were using the machine gun to\nfacilitate a -- a purchase for personal use; would you\nnot?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think the -- the\nuse of the machine gun wouldn't come within the\nbuyer/seller rule because what the buyer/seller rule\ndeals with is a substantive prohibition on distribution.\nAnd the -- the presumption is that when Congress\nprohibits distribution, it knows that there is also a\nreceiver of the banned substance. And by virtue of\nexcluding that receiver from the distribution\nprohibition, it wouldn't have wanted to bring that\nreceiver back within the fold of the statute.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Right, but --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That wouldn't apply --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I'm sorry. Go ahead.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I was just going to say I\ndon't think that would apply with somebody who is using\na machine gun because the person who is using a machine\ngun isn't necessarily part of the distribution offense\nto begin with. And so the buyer/seller principle would\napply with respect to the underlying purchase of drugs\nif that were at issue. But if you tack on use of a\nmachine gun, I don't think the buyer/seller principle\nwould speak directly to that.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I don't -- I don't see\nthe difference between use of a phone to facilitate --\nuse of a phone in facilitating, use of -- of a firearm\nin facilitating, unless you can say that the -- the use\nof a communication facility in effecting the purchase is\nsuch a -- a virtually indispensable element of the\npurchase that it -- it -- it's swept up within it.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Oh, no, I'm sorry, Justice\nAlito. If the hypothetical statute barred use of a\nphone in facilitating a drug felony, if it was precisely\nparallel to this one, then we make the same argument.\nBut it's not because the use of a machine gun falls\nwithin the buyer/seller principle. It's because the\nunderlying act of purchasing drugs falls within the\nbuyer/seller principle. And if the prohibition is on\nuse of a machine gun in some underlying act, then you\nhave to look at the underlying act. And the underlying\nact is governed by the buyer/ seller principle, and\nbuyers fall outside of it. And so the use of a machine\ngun by someone who is already outside of the act\nwouldn't bring the buyer back into the fold of the\nstatute.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So the answer is that this\n-- it would be the same.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It would be the same --\nJUSTICE ALITO: The buyer/seller rule would\napply in your view in exactly the same way.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: If the -- if the statute --\nif I understand your hypothetical correctly, if the\nstatute were use of a phone in facilitating a drug\nfelony, then the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it could be a -- a\nseparate crime, the use of a machine gun in facilitating\n-- in facilitating a crime, any crime. That could be --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Sure. If that were the\ncase, then it would be different. My -- if I could just\nfinish for a minute, Mr. Chief Justice.\nMy -- my only point is that if the theory of\nprosecution were that a person comes within the fold of\nthe statute because they're buying drugs and that buying\nof drugs facilitates the sale of drugs and, therefore,\nthey are someone who uses a machine gun in facilitating\nthe sale of drugs, well, then the buyer/seller rule\nwould kick in. Because the initial predicate of that\ntheory, which is that the person is facilitating the\nsale by buying, wouldn't work. They would fall outside\nof the statute at that stage.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
