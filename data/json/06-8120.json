        "content": "(11:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in 06-8120, Brendlin versus California.\nMs. Campbell.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH M. CAMPBELL, ESQ.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. CAMPBELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\npleast the Court:\nWhen an officer makes a traffic stop,\nactivates his flashing lights, he seizes not only the\ndriver of the car but also the car and every person and\neverything in that car. This unremarkable conclusion is\nwhat Petitioner asks this Court to rule on, rule today.\nThis simple rule is not only firmly rooted in this\nCourt's precedence, it also protects police officers and\nthe liberty interests of everyone traveling on a public\nState highway.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it wouldn't\napply in a taxicab, right? I mean, the cab is driving\nerratically, the officer pulls it over. If I'm a\npassenger in the cab, I think I can get out and catch\nanother cab, right?\nMS. CAMPBELL: Whether or not you can get\nout and catch another cab is sort of a separate issue,\nbut at the moment that the car comes to a stop you've\nbeen stopped by a Government means intentionally\napplied, and I believe you are seized at that point.\nAfter that it may become a factual question with the\ntotality of the circumstances and it may be\nsignificantly different from that, from the question we\nface in a case like this where it's a passenger in a\nprivate car.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And would that apply if a\nbus was pulled over?\nMS. CAMPBELL: If a bus --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Everybody on the bus is\nseized?\nMS. CAMPBELL: Once again, a forward motion\nstopped by government means intentionally applied is a\nseizure under this Court's holding in Brower.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you would have\nno reason if you were a passenger on a bus in the normal\ncase to assume that the officer was concerned about you.\nYour view would not be that they are stopping me, you'd\nthink they're stopping the bus because the driver ran a\nred light or whatever.\nMS. CAMPBELL: With all due respect, I\nbelieve at that point what you believe is not\nnecessarily the dispositive issue. The dispositive\nissue is that your freedom of movement has been\ncurtailed by government action.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, are you saying then\nthat in a case in which the bus is stopped, the car is\nstopped and so on, the role for the test about whether a\nreasonable person would regard himself as free to leave\nis a test to determine when the, when the seizure ends,\nas distinct from when the seizure begins?\nMS. CAMPBELL: Exactly, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: There's no other role for\nthat test.\nMS. CAMPBELL: Exactly, Your Honor. And I\nbelieve that's the rule we apply with respect to\ndrivers. We don't normally formulate it that was\nbecause usually there's a directive from the officer\nsaying okay, you're free to leave, there's a clear point\nwhere the seizure ends. But --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah, but you're taking the\nposition that whenever you are in a vehicle that is\nstopped, you are seized?\nMS. CAMPBELL: Exactly. Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: In this case, is it correct\nto view this as -- to view it this way: As soon as the\nofficer approached the car, as I understand it, he\nrecognized the Defendant as a potential parole violator.\nMS. CAMPBELL: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And there would be\nreasonable suspicion then from that moment on, for at\nleast a brief detention of the individual to determine\nwhether in fact there was a warrant for the individual.\nSo all we're talking about, the only period of potential\nseizure that we have to worry about is up to the moment\nwhen the officer sees Mr. Brendlin.\nMS. CAMPBELL: In terms of determining when\nMr. Brendlin was seized, yes. The -- there --\nJUSTICE ALITO: In other words, any seizure\nafter that point would be supported by reasonable\nsuspicion?\nMS. CAMPBELL: Well, except in this case of\ncourse, it would be fruit of the poisonous tree, since\nthe State has continued --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's the question.\nDo you concede that this arrest was lawful?\nMS. CAMPBELL: The arrest itself -- the\narrest itself is still a product of the exploitation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you concede that the\narrest was lawful? The officer was obligated to arrest\nthis person, knowing what he did, was he not?\nMS. CAMPBELL: Yes. We concede that the --\nMS. CAMPBELL: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you have any case in\nwhich we exclude the evidence seized incident to an\narrest when the arrest is lawful?\nMS. CAMPBELL: Well, Your Honor, I don't\nhave a case that has these specifics in it. This is a\nnew --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I didn't think you did,\nand that's my concern. I assumed that this officer was\nrequired to arrest the person, and we can have\nhypotheticals, he sees somebody wanted for multiple\nmurders and so forth. But I'm just not aware of\nauthority which says that when the arrest is lawful and\nthe search is incident to that arrest, that the evidence\nis excluded. What's your best -- what's your closest\ncase you can give me on that?\nMS. CAMPBELL: Well actually, I would turn\nto the cases that talk about searches incident to arrest\nand also, go back to the rationale for the intended --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can I have one please?\nMS. CAMPBELL: Well actually, let's look at\nThornton and --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Thornton, I'm not familiar\nwith immediately. I'll look it up.\nMS. CAMPBELL: Thornton and Knowles are two\ncases that this Court has decided relatively recently\nwhere you talk about the rationale for searches incident\nto arrest. They're not cases that I would have\nconsidered to be directly on point for the seizure issue\nin this case, but in Knowles the Court held that you\ncan't search a car incident to arrest on a minor traffic\nstop because --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. This was the\nsearch of a person incident to an arrest, and I really\njumped a little bit ahead of the questions that Justice\nAlito was proposing. There may have been a moment in\nwhich the officer did not have the authority to act and\nhe did, but it seems to me that once he has this\nknowledge, there is now an intervening cause and the\narrest is proper, and the search as well.\nMS. CAMPBELL: If I can divide this into two\nissues. First we have the issue of the arrest itself,\nand I am aware of no mechanism by which Mr. Brendlin\nwould be entitled to suppress the arrest itself, to not\nbe arrested on the parole warrant, or to get out of jail\nfree, so to speak. That is a separate issue, however,\nthan discussing whether or not the evidence that comes\nout of this auto search which is a direct product of the\nillegal stop should be admissible. And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's a direct product\nof the arrest, and if the arrest is legal, then it seems\nto me the search incident to the arrest is legal. And\nare you acknowledging that the arrest is legal, that\nwhatever the exclusionary rule does, it does not require\nyou -- when you've engaged in an unlawful seizure and\nyou find an ax murderer sitting there in the car, you\ndon't have to say sorry, I shouldn't have stopped the\ncar. You can arrest the person, right?\nMS. CAMPBELL: And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So the arrest is legal. If\nthe arrest is legal, then the search incident to it must\nbe legal.\nMS. CAMPBELL: Well, I think we have to\nlook, as I said, at the purpose -- the rationales for\nallowing a search incident to arrest are the need to\ndisarm the suspect or take him into custody, and the\nneed to preserve evidence for trial. In this specific\ncase he's arrested on a parole warrant. I can't imagine\nwhat evidence in that car would be needed to be\npreserved in order to proceed on the parole warrant.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What authority do you have\nthat the operation of the exclusionary rule depends on\nthe offense for which he was arrested?\nMS. CAMPBELL: Well, the search incident to\nan arrest is an exception to -- to the exclusionary\nrule.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you have any authority\nfor the proposition you just offered?\nMS. CAMPBELL: The proposition --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The search incident to an\narrest leads to an exclusion in one case and not in\nanother case, depending on the charge on which he was\narrested?\nMS. CAMPBELL: Well, if what we are talking\nabout is whether or not the exclusionary rule should\napply, we look to the purposes of the exclusionary rule\nwhich is to deter unlawful police conduct. If we allow\nofficers to make a stop on a hunch that someone has a,\nhas a, has a warrant or whatever, we have essentially\nreduced the deterrent effect of the exclusionary rule as\nit applies to traffic stops, as it has historically\napplied to traffic stops.\nThis is, this is not a new proposition that\nif you stop a car and -- if you saw something in plain\nview after an illegal stop, it wouldn't be -- it would\nstill be excluded.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but why -- why\ndoesn't plain view kick in just as readily, once it is\nconceded as it has to be, that at the point that he was\nmaking the arrest, the officer was acting lawfully? And\nif he was acting lawfully when he made the arrest, why\ndoesn't he get the benefit of the plain view doctrine to\nthe extent that he saw any evidence before him at that\npoint?\nAnd I take it the plain view exception would\nat least cover the, I forget what it was, but the\nmaterials that were in the, in the passenger well of the\npassenger car, that -- that were known to be used as a\nsource of, of ingredients for making methamphetamine?\nMS. CAMPBELL: Well, I believe you\nmisunderstood me. I wouldn't say that the plain view\ndoctrine would allow admission of that evidence. If the\nstop is illegal then anything the officer seized --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, I realize. But we've\ngot -- we've got a choice here, I mean, I think Justice\nKennedy's questions brought this out. We've got a\nchoice here of two ways to look at the State action at\nthe moment of -- of the arrest. One way to look at it\nwould be to say it was a product of an unlawful stop.\nAnother way to look at it would be to say it was an act\nof executing a validly issued warrant. And you concede\nthat they at least could lawfully have executed the\narrest, they didn't have the arrest warrant but there\nwas an arrest warrant issued for them and they could\nlawfully execute that warrant and arrest him at that\npoint.\nLet's assume that those are our two choices.\nOn choice number one the State, the police officer, is\nacting someplace where he shouldn't have been. On\nchoice number two, the parole violator, your client, is\nin a place where he shouldn't have been because he\nshould have been arrested and he should have been back\nbehind bars at that point.\nIf we have a choice between those two ways\nof looking at the case, why don't we for any purpose,\ngive the casting vote to the lawfulness of the arrest,\nto the warrant which was issued by a neutral and\ndetached magistrate at some point? And if we do that,\nthen why isn't not only a search incident to an arrest,\nbut the seizure of materials which were in plain view at\nthe moment of that arrest, subject to a -- an\nadmissibility rule?\nMS. CAMPBELL: Well, first, Your Honor, a\nslight correction. I don't believe that there is any\nevidence that this was an issue issued by an detached\nmagistrate because what we call in California a Powell\nwarrant under California Penal Code Section 3000(v)(a)\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But it was, it was a\nwarrant that was lawful for Fourth Amendment purposes,\nis that conceded?\nMS. CAMPBELL: Yes. Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMS. CAMPBELL: Issued by the Board of Prison\nTerms.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right.\nMS. CAMPBELL: But in terms of why we don't\ndo this, it's the reason we exclude evidence in general\nwhen it's unlawfull seized, when it is the direct result\nof a -- of a stop that is illegal from its inception.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, all right, but you're\nsimply saying we give, we put the greatest emphasis on\nact A, stopping the car rather than act B, lawfully\narresting, regardless of the legality of stopping the\ncar.\nMS. CAMPBELL: Well -- well actually we have\na test for this. It's the Brown test; it's the Wong sun\ntest, and the people have the burden. The test is if\nthe, even there is attenuation, which I -- which is what\nthe people are arguing, the warrant in this case is,\nthat's not the end of the inquiry. We also look at the\nflagrancy of the officer's misconduct, and we look at\nthe temporal proximity to the initial illegality. And\nin this case that attenuating circumstance is simply not\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But do we, do we have do we\nhave in any of the cases -- I, frankly I don't recall.\nI remember Brown but I don't think there was anything in\nBrown comparable to the lawful authority to arrest\nindependent of the stop. And -- and that's what makes\nthis case unusual. And -- and if we emphasize the\nlawfulness of the arrest, quite independent of the\ncircumstances of the stop, and we also bear in mind that\nthe point of the exclusionary rule is -- is to deter\npolice conduct, and you've got another priority here,\nthe driver, who can invoke the exclusionary rule and\ndeter police misconduct.\nI don't see where the interest would lie in,\nor where the justification would lie, in our saying\nwe've got to put, as it were all the eggs in the basket\nof the unlawful stop, as opposed to the basket of the\nlawful arrest.\nMS. CAMPBELL: Well, Your Honor, I think,\nactually I'm not sure that the driver in this case is\ngoing to have a remedy. If we look at the steps in this\ncase, first we have this officer who makes an illegal\nstop. He continues that detention in order to run\nwarrant checks on both parties; he finds probable cause\nto arrest Mr. Brendlin; he searches the car incident to\nthe arrest, even though the Belton rationale search\nincident to arrest perhaps is a bit shaky in the case,\nbecause Mr. Brendlin is in the back of the car, and it's\na parole warrant. But at that point the officer also\nsearches the driver, and if the evidence is, or if the\ntaint is attenuated, as to Mr. Brendlin, and this is a\nlawful search incident to his arrest, I don't really\nunderstand how the driver is going to have a remedy as\nwell. And in fact --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, do we have an -- an\nargument that something was seized from the driver that\nshould not have been seized from his person?\nMS. CAMPBELL: The driver is not a party to\nthe appeal, but she was convicted, and -- and -- and --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but I mean, that's\nnot before us.\nMS. CAMPBELL: No, it's not.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: We're talking about\nevidence seized from the defendant.\nMS. CAMPBELL: No, Your Honor. I was\nresponding to the question doesn't the driver have a\nremedy? You know, isn't that enough to provide\ndeterrence? But if we allow a warrant by one person of\nthe car to attenuate the search, search of the car, then\nas I read this Court's precedents, the search is\nattenuated, the taint is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The California Supreme\nCourt as far as I could tell was thinking that it turns,\nif you stop somebody, you stop somebody, if you make him\nthink he isn't free to go.\nSo you seem to me to give a lot of cases\nwhere he would feel free to go, and you're saying still\nthat that's a stop. Well, I mean, suppose the policeman\ncomes along and he sees three people in a car and there\nis Jack the Ripper driving. So he says okay, I'm\nstopping the car. Now he says the other three people,\nI'm not interested in you; my pal and partner here is in\na second squad car; he will take you wherever you want\nto go. Have they been stopped?\nMS. CAMPBELL: Have they been stopped by the\ninitial seizure?\nJUSTICE BREYER: No.\nMS. CAMPBELL: The initial stop of the car,\nyes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Well, I don't think\nyou're going to find authority for that in the law. At\nleast not in this Court. I mean, I'd like to know what\nit is. Maybe you are. I think that would be very\ninteresting.\nMS. CAMPBELL: Well, I think the Brower\ndecision --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Brower --\nMS. CAMPBELL: The Brower opinion has a very\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: What, what were the facts\nthere?\nMS. CAMPBELL: Well, in Brower there was a\nroadblock --\nJUSTICE BREYER: There was a roadblock.\nMS. CAMPBELL: The car crashed into it. But\nthe, the crucial question, the crucial issue was was\nmeans intentionally applied by the Government.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if the car -- you\nknow, the car doesn't come to a complete stop. The same\nfacts that Justice Breyer just gave you. It's creeping\nalong at, you know, a foot a minute. And then he says\nto these other people, you can jump out and go wherever\nyou like, or you know, or go back to, to my partner's\ncar. Then they wouldn't have been stopped; is that\nright?\nMS. CAMPBELL: I think then we'd have a\ntotality of the circumstances test and whether someone\nfeels free to leave and jump out of a moving car. But I\n-- I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you're putting all the\neggs into the basket that the, the car came to a\ncomplete stop and therefore they have been seized. And\nwhat is crucial for the seizure is the elimination on\nmotion on the part of the car.\nMS. CAMPBELL: That's how --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Any elimination of motion\nin a vehicle in which you are the passenger constitutes,\nat the request of the authorities, constitutes a\nseizure?\nMS. CAMPBELL: If it is by means\nintentionally implied, yes. I think that's, that's how\nHodari --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But not if you're still\nrolling a little bit, a foot a minute.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. CAMPBELL: Well, then it would be\ntotality of the circumstances test.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It seems to me that you're,\nyou're blending two tests together, and tell me if I'm\nwrong. One test is there is no question that if the\npolice get control over people, those people are not\nfree to go.\nMS. CAMPBELL: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And those are the motion\ncases. The most extreme example being the -- the\nroadblock. Hodari D, did they -- you know, they were\ntrying to catch him but did they actually get to the\npoint of a seizure for Fourth Amendment purposes?\nThen you got another category of cases in\nwhich there is no question that someone is stopped, that\na police officer can exercise control, and that control\nif so exercised is certainly going to be seizure for\nFourth Amendment purposes. But we don't know whether\nthe officer really is exercising control, so we ask the\nquestion would a reasonable person in the position of\nthe individual stopped have believed that he was free to\ngo?\nAren't those two quite distinct tests? The\nfirst test assumes the answer to the question in the\nsecond test. The second test assumes the answer to the\nfirst test, i.e., they're stopped, subject to control.\nAren't they two independent tests?\nMS. CAMPBELL: I agree with you that they\nare two independent tests, and as I went through this\nCourt's precedents I frankly could not find a single\ncase in which a person had been in motion and stopped\nand came to a stop, the physical stopping of motion, in\nwhich this Court did not find that a seizure had\noccurred.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. So you were engaging\nin shorthand? You, you accept the analytical\ndistinction but you say look, in the real world once you\nstop, we -- we know how the person would have felt?\nMS. CAMPBELL: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: A reasonable person would\nhave felt.\nMS. CAMPBELL: I think that what we have\nhere, is -- as I said it's really the way we look at it\nwith drivers as well. There is a bright line. The car\ncomes to a stop as a result of this display of\nauthority, you are seized. From that point on when you\nwould, when a reasonable person would feel --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but aren't -- you are\nsaying, I thought by agreeing with you what you were\nsaying was once the car is stopped, a reasonable person\nunder those circumstances would not have felt free to\nleave.\nMS. CAMPBELL: I think that's true.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMS. CAMPBELL: I think a reasonable person\nwould not feel free to leave.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if the officer went,\nbefore even approaching the car got on the loudspeaker\nand said: \"Driver remain in the car; passenger, you're\nfree to go\"?\nMS. CAMPBELL: I think under the totality of\nthe circumstances any court would have a hard time\nsaying the passenger is not free to leave then, unless\nthere is some other intervening, some other factor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you would state\nhe is still seized because the car is stopped.\nMS. CAMPBELL: He is seized by the stop,\nabsolutely.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, then you're -- you're\nblending the two tests together again.\nMS. CAMPBELL: Well, the two different --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You have either got to\naccept their analytical distinction or not.\nMS. CAMPBELL: I do accept their analytical\ndistinction, Your Honor. I think it's just -- it's\nactually two different fact, two different points in\ntime. There's the, there's the seizure that occurs when\nthe car stops; and then there is the continuing seizure\nduring the course of the traffic stop which for the\ndriver has a fairly clear ending point; for a passenger\nit's going to depend on the facts.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What's the difference\nbetween that situation where the police officer says on\nthe loudspeaker passenger remain, driver you're free to\ngo, and the example that the State has in their brief,\nin which a car is stopped and as a result of the way\nit's stopped on a narrow road, the other cars behind\nthat car are for some other period of time prevented\nfrom going forward? What's the difference between those\ntwo situations?\nMS. CAMPBELL: That difference is actually\naddressed directly in Brower. Brower addresses that\nexact hypothetical. It says a passerby who is\ninconvenienced by another stop. There you have\nGovernment, a Government-caused termination of movement\nbut it's, but there is no intentionally, means\nintentionally applied.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what it says here,\ngetting out their quote from it, is it says it does not\noccur whenever there is a governmentally caused\ntermination in individual's freedom of movement, nor\neven where there is a governmentally caused and\ngovernmentally desired termination of an individual's\nfreedom of movement. That only when there is a\ntermination of freedom of movement through means\nintentionally applied.\nNow, the only way I can -- I mean I say the\ndifference between desired is that they didn't want to\nstop him. They are not interested in stopping him.\nThat's not our desire to stop him. Our desire is to\nstop the driver.\nSo if you don't have the desire and if there\nis no real restriction of any significance, is there a\nstop? I mean I would say Brower, they cited on their\nside, for that language.\nMS. CAMPBELL: Your Honor, where you're\nlooking at -- we have to look at the objectively\nobservable facts, which in this case are the flashing\nlights. We don't -- I mean the passenger has no\nparticular way of knowing what the officer's intent is,\nwhich I think is why this Court has consistently held\nthat the officer's object intent in -- in -- is\nirrelevant to the equation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, the passenger, you\nalso have to have two things. One they don't\nintentionally want to stop him. Two, he doesn't think\nhis movement is restricted. Where both of those things\nare true, then no stop. That's why the people who, say,\nare on the railroad car and they stop the whole train,\nthat the railroad says don't worry, not an\ninconvenience: We'll have another train for new 10 or\n15 minutes; just get out, except for car one where there\nis Jack the Ripper -- you know, those other people are\nnot stopped.\nNow that's their argument. What's your\nresponse?\nMS. CAMPBELL: Well, my response is the same\nas it has been. The passenger is certainly stopped when\nthe car comes to a halt. We discuss in our brief that\nthere are reasons why a passenger could, why the car\ncould be stopped, as far as the passenger knows, and\nparticularly in this case where we have -- whereas it\nwas an unreasonable stop, there was no traffic\nviolation, neither the passenger nor the driver has any\nreason to know why they are being stopped, and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, does that make\na difference? Let's say, you know, the car drives\nthrough a red light and the police lights come on. The\npassenger surmises that it's because they ran a red\nlight. So that's a different case? You would say it's\nnot seized if he reasonably, objectively, reasonably\nassumes it's because of what the driver did.\nMS. CAMPBELL: No, Your Honor. I would\nstill say that the passenger is seized when the car\ncomes to a stop.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So then why are we\npointing out that they didn't know? It makes no\ndifference under your view of the case.\nMS. CAMPBELL: Well, I don't think it makes\na difference one way or the other. I was responding to\nthe suggestion that the passenger should somehow be\naware of the officer's intent and know when he sees\nflashing lights that it means the driver -- I don't\nthink that that's a proper inquiry to determine whether\nor not --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well then, if all\nthat matters is the physical stop, what do you do about\nthe cases that were talked about earlier where the other\ncars have to stop because of the way -- that's a\nphysical stop and yet our cases indicate you're not\nseized in those situations.\nMS. CAMPBELL: That's a physical stop, but\nit's not -- it's not the -- the means intentionally\napplied portion of the test doesn't work or it doesn't\nsatisfy it.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, how do you explain the\njustification for stopping if there is the seizure, for\nstopping the innocent passenger because the driver has\ncommitted a traffic violation? If that's a seizure of\nthe passenger, then it's a seizure without reasonable\nsuspicion of probable cause, right?\nMS. CAMPBELL: No. I would say that that's\na reasonable, a reasonable stop. That's the risk --\nwhen you get into the car as a passenger, you take a\nrisk that you may be subject to a reasonable search or\nreasonable detention. But the Fourth Amendment doesn't\nprovide any protection for anyone against reasonable\ndetentions and that would be a reasonable detention.\nWas there a question?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about a shutdown of an\nairport? You know, there is word that somebody has been\nseen walking in with a bag of explosives or it looks\nlike a bag of explosives, so they stop all planes on the\ntarmac, shut down all exits to the airport until they\ncan ascertain what this bag is. Everybody in the\nairport and everybody in those planes has been seized\nfor Fourth Amendment purposes?\nMS. CAMPBELL: No, Your Honor. Some of\nthose people in the airport would be in the same\nposition as the passengers in Bostick and Drayton, where\nthey weren't going anywhere in the first place, and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, just the people who\nwere trying to leave the airport. They had just arrived\nand they were going to go out to catch a cab and go\nhome. They have been seized.\nMS. CAMPBELL: I would say some of those\npeople would be in the position of the passer-by, the\npassers-by identified in Brower. Possibly some of them\nwould be seized, but it sounds to me like it would be a\nreasonable seizure and wouldn't necessarily --I mean a\nreasonable seizure, there's no Fourth Amendment\nprotection against a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it turns out that\nthere wasn't a bag of explosives and that no reasonable\nperson would have thought. This was a knitting bag and\nsome foolish cop thought it was a bag of explosives.\nThat would have made it unreasonable. So everybody in\nthe airport who is on the way home has been seized and\nhas a cause of action.\nMS. CAMPBELL: Given the extreme leeway\ngiven in airports, if it's so bad that there wasn't\nreasonable suspicion to shut it down, I'd say that's\nprobably a reasonable result for shutting down entire\nairports for no reason whatsoever. But under the fact\nthat you posited, it sounds like it would be exigent\n-sent circumstances or something else that would make\nthat a reasonable suspicion.\nGoing back to our, to the test that\nPetitioner asks this Court to adopt, the most important\nthing I can say about this test is not only does it\nreflect what I think is the real life expectation. It\nalso protects officer safety by providing a measure of\npredictability for both passengers and drivers and as\nwell for officers.\nAnd I'd like to reserve the rest of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Zall.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CLIFFORD E. ZALL\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMR. ZALL: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nI'd like to respond if I could to Justice\nSouter's point earlier. The State sees this as having\ntwo distinct components in a situation where a passenger\nis subject to a, in a vehicle that's subjected to a\nroutine traffic stop. First, you have the stopping of\nthe vehicle, the physical stopping of the vehicle. In\nour view that does not result in a seizure of a\npassenger. It's a show of authority much like Hodari D\ndiscussed, which is directed at the driver. The driver\nis the operator of the vehicle. When the driver submits\nto that show of authority, under this Court's precedents\nthe driver is seized. The passenger is not seized.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even, even when the reason\nthe driver is stopped is that a police officer whose car\nwas alongside, he looks over there and he sees that it\nis some notorious felon who is in the back seat, and the\nonly reason he stops the car is so arrest that felon?\nYou would still say that, that the show of authority is\nonly directed at the driver and hence it is only the\ndriver that's seized?\nMR. ZALL: Justice Scalia, the way I'd\nanswer that question is to say yes at the outset,\nbecause the driver is in control of the vehicle. By\nnecessity, the show of authority to stop if it's done in\na routine manner, as was done here, is directed at the\ndriver. Therefore --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's the right answer. I\nthink you're being consistent. You have to say that.\nYou have to say that.\nMR. ZALL: Thank you.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, consistent with that\nanswer, consistent with that answer, what we're\nconcerned with in these cases is not, in cases like\nthis, is not literally the moment of the stop, but the\nmoment of the stop plus one. And in cases like this\nthe -- I take it you concede the question is would the\npassenger, would a reasonable passenger in, in that\nsituation feel free to leave. And in the absence of a\nhypothetical like Justice Alito's in which the\nloudspeaker says, all I want is the driver, passenger is\nfree to go, and so on, absent something like that, what\nis the argument that the, that a reasonable person in\nthe passenger seat would feel free to open the door and\ntraipse off?\nMR. ZALL: Justice Souter, I think the, the\npervasiveness and the commonplace nature of a routine\ntraffic stop gives --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Have you ever been stopped?\nHave you ever been subject to a traffic stop?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Tell the truth now.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ZALL: Yes. Yes, I have.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. The heart rate went\nup. The blood pressure went up. But --\nMR. ZALL: But I was the driver, I was the\ndriver.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Don't you think that a\nreasonable passenger at that point would assume that the\nofficer is in control and that, in the absence of some\naffirmative indication that the passenger can go, that\nhe's supposed to sit there until this thing gets over\nwith? Isn't that the reasonable response of a\npassenger?\nMR. ZALL: No, Justice Souter, I don't think\nso. I think again, because the, the traffic stop is\nsuch a common occurrence and in the overwhelming\nmajority of cases involving a routine traffic stop, it's\nan investigatory stop of the driver. And I think it's\nreasonable for the passenger and the driver to see it\nthat way, I would submit that if I am a passenger in a\ncar and I'm riding with somebody and they, and one\npatrol car signals for the driver to pull over, I think\nthe natural reaction is the driver says, what did I do,\nand the passenger says, what did you do? I mean, I\nthink that's the natural reaction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The fact that the action\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but the policeman\nusually tells the drive and anybody else in the car:\nStay in the car. Policemen don't like people jumping\nout of the car. They don't know why they're jumping out\nof the car. And I would certainly if I were a passenger\nnot feel free to immediately open the door and start\nwalking away, and if I did I would expect the policeman\nto tell me: Get back in the car. Isn't that, isn't\nthat the normal procedure, to keep the occupants in the\ncar until the policeman investigates?\nMR. ZALL: Well, I think, Justice Scalia, I\nthink if the officer did tell you to stay in the car --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, even if he didn't\ntell me. I would have expected him to tell me. I\nwouldn't even open the door because I know he would tell\nme. I know that I'm not free to leave the car\nimmediately until he investigates the stop.\nMR. ZALL: Well, I, I'm not sure that I\nagree with that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if there's a\nsuitcase in the back seat? Just the driver, the\ndriver's pulled over, and then somebody comes walking\ndown the sidewalk, the driver's friend, he opens the car\ndoor, takes the suitcase and starts walking away?\nWouldn't the policeman say, put that back, because he\nthought he had seized not just the driver but everything\nin the car, too?\nMR. ZALL: Well, again, Mr. Chief Justice, I\nthink that if, if the officer -- our position is that if\nthe officer does something to the passenger to indicate\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm talking about\nthe suitcase. You wouldn't, you wouldn't reasonably\nthink someone could just take something out of the car\nthat's been stopped by the officer and walk off with it,\nright? Everything, all the contents of the car, are\nseized as well as the driver, right?\nMR. ZALL: I'm not sure that a passenger,\nthough, is like a suitcase. I mean, a suitcase can't go\nanywhere unless somebody does something.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You're representing the\nState of California and you want to establish the\nproposition that any time there is a traffic stop in the\nState of California or I guess anywhere in the United\nStates all the passengers are free to immediately leave,\nabsent some further countermanding officer -- order by\nthe officer. I think that's a quite surprising\nproposition. Now, we don't have empirical studies and\nso forth, but at some point the Court takes judicial\nnotice and I think indications from the bench are we\njust don't think passengers, A, are or, B, should feel\nfree to leave when there's a traffic stop. I just think\nyou have no social or empirical documentation for that\nposition.\nMR. ZALL: Well, though it's not cited in\nour brief, Justice Kennedy, we have talked with the\nCalifornia Highway Patrol who make over a million stops\na year in California and they treat passengers as free\nto leave.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I mean, the question --\nso I want to know how to decide this case. I understand\nwhat your position is. But I think the normal instinct\nof everybody is not about boats, taxis, airports and all\nthese other examples, but this case. And I, I would say\nif you want to go on instinct I wouldn't think of\ngetting out of a car when I'm the passenger and the\npoliceman has stopped. But maybe I'm wrong. So when\nyou asked a million policemen, how many instances did\nthey tell you about where they stopped the car and all\nthe passengers jumped out and walked away? Was there\none? Was there one.\nMR. ZALL: Well, I mean -- but I think that\nprudent behavior -- just because it's prudent to do\nsomething doesn't make it a seizure.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right. I never pass a\npolice car. I don't care how slow I'm going. I never\npass a police car. I don't consider myself arrested\njust because that's the prudent thing to do, and it may\nwell be a similar situation when you're sitting in a car\nthat's been stopped by a traffic policeman.\nMR. ZALL: I mean, I think, I think again\nthat --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Zall, let's say we\nhave just an intelligent reasonable person reads the\nnewspaper and says: Oh, they handed down a decision\ntoday that said the police can order me to get out of\nthe car, the police can order me to stay in the car.\nHow could such a person feel free to leave knowing that\nit is the law that that person can be told, get out, or\nif he tries to get out, stay in?\nMR. ZALL: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I'd say\nthat, you know, in the Court's seizure jurisprudence\nthere is this notion of a consensual encounter. I think\nwhen an officer approaches a citizen on the street there\nis always the apparent authority. The apparent\nauthority of the police is always present. The police\nalways have the factual upper hand, if you were, and at\nthe traffic stop is no different. I mean -- and yet,\nthis Court has repeatedly said that when the police\napproach a citizen, ask for his identification, ask for\nhis cooperation, even if the police follow him in a\nsquad car, that that's a consensual encounter.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Does it matter if they're\non the Santa Monica Freeway?\nMR. ZALL: I don't think so.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean it would be pretty\ndangerous to get out.\nMR. ZALL: Well, but that would be a reason\nwhy you don't get out. But it doesn't have anything\nnecessarily to do with the police coercion. I don't, I\ndon't think -- most of us wouldn't get out. But that\ndoesn't make it a seizure, just like most of us would\ncooperate with the police when the police approach us on\nthe street. But I don't think -- if anything, I think\nthe traffic stop is less ambiguous. It's clearer that\nthe police are not interested in me if I'm a passenger.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question?\nSuppose after the stop the passenger in the back seat\nstarts to get out and the officer says: Stay in the\ncar. Is he then seized?\nMR. ZALL: Yes. Yes, because now the police\nhave directed action at him and in that situation a\nreasonable person --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Doesn't it mean that the\nauthority to cause the person to stay in the car existed\nthroughout the stop?\nMR. ZALL: The authority? Yes, but I mean,\nI think the police always have some degree of authority\nover us in any encounter.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you this. On a\ncasual street in downtown, if they say, I'd like to stop\nand talk to you, you don't have to stop. There's no\nauthority to make them stop. But there is authority for\nthe passenger in the back seat of the car.\nMR. ZALL: Well, it depends, Justice\nStevens. I think, is there legal authority? I mean, I\nthink police always have the factual authority and I\nthink that's the way the reasonable person looks at\nthings. I don't think the reasonable person --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is there a difference\nbetween legal authority and factual authority?\nMR. ZALL: I don't think in this context\nthere is. I mean, certainly in --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If there's no difference\nthen there's legal authority.\nMR. ZALL: I'm sorry, Justice Stevens?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If there's no difference\nthen there's legal authority, which would mean the\nperson is subject, is in custody of the officer.\nMR. ZALL: No, I don't think so, any more so\nthan Mr. Drayton was in the Drayton case, where his\ncompatriot was arrested and the police continued to\nengage him, and this Court found that that was a\nconsensual --\nJUSTICE BREYER: How are we supposed to -- I\nthink it's quite interesting. How do you suggest we\ndecide this/ I don't mean the result, but I'll go, I'll\nsay yes, you've done your survey of the policemen, a\nmillion policemen think they're not restricting the\nmovement of the passenger. Very few passengers jump out\nof the car, but that may be because they're worried\nabout being run over. So you say, well, in fact they're\nrestricted, but they don't think they're being\nrestricted by the police, or do they? And here we have\nno idea, at least I have no idea. I really don't know\nwhat the majority think and yet it would seem totally\nrelevant. How would we find out?\nMR. ZALL: Well, Justice Breyer, I mean, I\nthink that in this Court's -- to be consistent with this\nCourt's consensual encounter jurisprudence, with\nRodriguez, with Royer, with Drayton, with Bostick --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But those are encounters\nin an airport where there are pedestrians; there's no\nauthority to make the person stay, where here I think\nyou've conceded that there is legal authority to require\nthe person to stay where he was.\nMR. ZALL: Yes, yes, I do, Justice Stevens.\nBut I think the point is that if --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And if it wasn't a seizure\nwhat's the source of the legal authority?\nMR. ZALL: Well, again, I think, though,\nthat it's a question of seizable versus seized. I don't\nthink just because the police have some authority that\nthat makes you seized. I mean, if the police see a\ncitizen jaywalking that person is not arrested because\nthe police have the authority to make, to arrest him.\nSo again I think, I think that the seizure\noccurs when the police exercise some authority over you.\nI just think the traffic stop is less ambiguous. It's\nclear that the traffic stop is to deal with the driver,\nwhereas in the street encounter --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If it's not, if the\nopposite is true, then it is a seizure even though they\nstop the car?\nMR. ZALL: Then, Mr. Chief Justice, I would\nsay that it's a seizure that at the outset, again per\nJustice Scalia's hypothetical, that the, the driver only\nis seized at the outset, but then once the police make\nit clear that their interest is with the passenger then\nthe passenger would not feel free to leave, and then the\npassenger would be seized.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if they make\nthat, even if they make that interest clear prior to the\nstop?\nMR. ZALL: Yes, I think it would sort of\nhappen instantaneously.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. They pull up\nnext to them and they see that Brendlin is the passenger\nand they yell over: Pull over, Brendlin.\nMR. ZALL: So they direct their action, they\ndirect their attention at the passenger at the outset.\nYes, then I would say the driver is seized by the stop,\nand then right immediately the passenger, the reasonable\npassenger, would not feel free to leave and then he\nwould also be seized at that point. But again, I harken\nback to the Court's consensual encounter jurisprudence.\nIt seems to me that again the straight encounter is more\nanxiety-forming for the citizen because the police have\ndirected their attention at you.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It may be that you can\nwalk away, you're not in an enclosed space. Suppose the\npassenger knows when the police approaches: Oh my\ngoodness, I didn't buckle up. Would that passenger be\nthe object of the police authority from the start?\nMR. ZALL: Well, in your hypothetical,\nJustice Ginsburg, the passenger would not be an innocent\npassenger and the Court's test presupposes an innocent\nperson. So we can't really ask the question from the\nperspective of the seatbelt violator.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So it could be, it could\nbe sometimes the attention is directed at the driver,\nbut that's not always the case.\nMR. ZALL: Again, I -- as Justice Souter\nindicated, I think you have to, you have to break it up.\nAt the outset, the show of authority is by nature of\nthe, of the vehicle, is directed at the driver. After\nthe vehicle comes to a stop, the police could manifest\nsome interest in the passenger and then that changes\nthings.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But on your earlier answer\nto Justice Ginsburg, there's no authority in this Court\nto say that whether you deem yourself stopped or not\ndepends on whether think you're innocent. There's zero\nauthority for that, right?\nMR. ZALL: That's correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Correct me if I'm wrong.\nMR. ZALL: No, that's correct. That's\ncorrect. The perspective must be -- we must look at it\nfrom the innocent passenger and whether the innocent\npassenger would as a result merely of the stop of the\ncar feel free to leave.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Going back to Justice\nStevens' question, the passenger knows the minute the\nred light goes on that the police can either tell them\nto get out or tell him to stay in. He knows at that\nvery moment. That seems to me to substantially limit\nhis freedom of action and indicates that --\nMR. ZALL: Well, again I think factually\ncitizens when they encounter police always know -- I\nmean, the policeman in any encounter is armed, is\ntypically armed, and has apparent authority over you.\nAnd yet this Court has repeatedly held that that in and\nof itself, although it may cause some anxiety on the\npart of citizen --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but isn't your case\nhe doesn't in fact have the authority, he has apparent\nauthority, but in this case he has actual authority, not\njust apparent authority?\nMR. ZALL: But Justice Stevens, again I\ndon't think that the reasonable innocent passenger is --\nthis Court has never said it's the reasonable innocent\npassenger that knows the Supreme Court's Fourth\nAmendment jurisprudence by heart. I mean --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying he doesn't\nhave actual authority. If I understand you, you're\nsaying he has no authority to stop an innocent passenger\nfrom walking away. Aren't you saying that? Unless\nthere's some reason to hold a person in the car, he has\nno authority to stop him from walking away.\nMR. ZALL: I think that is the current state\nof the law. Yes, that is the current state of this\nCourt's jurisprudence.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if I feel, even though\nthat's the current state of the law, I wouldn't think of\nopening the door and walking away without asking the\npoliceman, do you mind if I open the door and walk away?\nDoes that suggest that I think I've been seized?\nMR. ZALL: No, I don't think so, Justice\nScalia. That just suggests that you're prudent when\nyou're dealing with an armed officer.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not the police\nwho have authority over the passenger; it's the driver.\nThe driver's exercising authority. Just because the\npolice say to pull over, the driver can take off and the\npassenger isn't seized at that point.\nMR. ZALL: Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice. I\nthink again, though, that the stop and then the after\nthe stop are discrete.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So now perhaps I'm having\nso much difficulty, and maybe others are, because you've\nactually reached a question of law where facts matter.\nThat is, the law points us to the direction of what\nwould a person reasonably think in general in such\ncircumstances, and we can look at five million cases,\nbut we don't know. So what do we do if we don't know?\nI can follow my instinct. My instinct is he would feel\nhe wasn't free because the red light's flashing. That's\njust one person's instinct. Or I could say, let's look\nfor some studies. They could have asked people about\nthis, and there are none. Or I could say, well, you're\nthe State of California, you're the ones able to get the\nstudies; you could tell some of those professors, you\nknow, to stop thinking about whatever they're thinking\nabout and go ask a few practical questions, but you\ndidn't.\nWhat should I do? Hold that against you?\nLook for more studies? Follow my instinct?\nMR. ZALL: I think, Justice Breyer, again I\nwould keep coming back to the Court's consensual\nencounter jurisprudence. I think you could ask some of\nthe same questions about in the Drayton case, in the\nBostick case, in the Royer case. But if you accept\nthose at consensual, then I'm not sure that this is any\nless consensual here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe we can just pass\nuntil the studies are done?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Zall, assume, and I\nrealize you don't assume, but assume for the sake of\nargument, that, that there is a seizure here. What's\nthe significance of the arrest warrant, or -- yes, I\nguess there was a warrant as I understand it, although\nit was not on the person of the officer who stopped the\ncar. Is that correct?\nMR. ZALL: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. What's the\nsignificance of that for the outcome of this case?\nMR. ZALL: Well, I think that even were this\nCourt to rule that the passenger were subject to a\nseizure, that the presence of the arrest warrant\nattenuates any taint and therefore the evidence was --\nwas not suppressible.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, maybe our questions\ntook your colleague representing the Petitioner beyond\nthe question presented. The question presented is only\nwhether the passenger felt seized. If we agree with the\nPetitioner, do we send the case back?\nMR. ZALL: I wouldn't, I wouldn't think\nthere would be a need to send the case back. I mean, I\nthink --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, why, if we have\nserious doubts whether or not the evidence is\nsuppressible? All we've been asked in the question is,\nis whether the passenger is detained.\nMR. ZALL: I concede that that's true.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: While the questions\nindicate that even if the passenger is detained, who\ncares, it's a lawful arrest.\nMR. ZALL: Well, I think that because it's\nfairly clear that the arrest would, would remove the\ntaint from the seizure, that there would be little\nreason to send the case back to the California Supreme\nCourt.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that question hasn't\nbeen argued here.\nMR. ZALL: Well, I think it's subsumed in\nthe question presented and I think it was raised in our\nopposition and the parties have briefed it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but there's --\nyou know, our Brown case establishes a multifactor test\nfor determining when the illegal seizure has been\nattenuated and the Court hasn't applied that, the\nCalifornia Supreme Court hasn't gone through that test\nin this case.\nMR. ZALL: That is correct, but again I\nthink because the warrant is such a clear intervening\ncircumstance that has nothing to do, you couldn't in any\nway say it's an exploitation of the, of the illegal\nstop.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But don't we have two\nproblems if we go to that stage? The first one is we\nwould be applying a test that was not applied by the\ncourt we're reviewing. And number two, correct me if\nI'm wrong, but the, the -- assuming you win, as it were,\non the general point about the significance of the, of\nthe arrest warrant, there are still going to be\nquestions about the suppression of the evidence because\nthere are going to be questions about whether the\nlegality of the arrest on that theory suffices to\njustify the seizure of the evidence. You recall the\ncolloquy I had with opposing counsel about the\npossibility of applying a plain view test here.\nAren't those issues that should all be\ndecided in the first instance in the State courts?\nMR. ZALL: Certainly you could take that\nposition, Justice Souter. But it seems to me that\nagain, that it's relatively straightforward. The arrest\nwas valid. I mean, unquestionably the arrest was valid.\nIf the arrest was valid, I'm not sure that there are any\ncases --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the question that's\npresented is kind of a standing question. It's who can\ncomplain when the police stop a car? You say the\ndriver. The question that's been presented in this case\nis, can the passenger also complain, and that's the only\nthing that we're dealing with. So the -- the arrest\nwarrant may pose a disqualification for this particular\npassenger, but that would be a second question. The\nquestion that is tendered to us and that was answered by\nthe California Supreme Court is when the car is stopped\nby the police who can complain.\nMR. ZALL: Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg, I\nagree. And one further point I'd like to make on that\nis, would be to draw a parallel between a parked car\nsituation, in which the lower courts have uniformly held\nthat no seizure results when the police turn on their\nlights and approach a parked car, and even when they rap\non the window to get the attention of the occupants\nthere is no seizure.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No seizure of a\npassenger or a driver?\nMR. ZALL: Of anybody. Lower courts have\nuniformly held that, and yet that seems to be a more\nambiguous situation and a situation in which the\noccupants' natural reaction would be to turn to each\nother and say: What's going on here? Whereas again in\nthe traffic stop I think it's, it is probably the most\nlikely place that a citizen encounters a policeman, much\nmore so than a, an officer approaching me at an airport\nand saying, can I see your identification, or\napproaching me on a street corner, or, as in Chesternut,\nfollowing me as I'm walking home in his squad car.\nThose seem to me to be more anxiety-creating and yet the\nCourt has held that those are consensual encounters.\nAnd in the parked car, there's ambiguity\nabout what the police want, whereas in the routine\ntraffic stop there isn't that ambiguity, so there's no\nreason why the passenger shouldn't feel free to leave.\nNow, it might be prudent, as Justice Scalia indicated,\nto say, I'm leaving. But that doesn't make it a\nseizure, that you should act prudently. I think you\nshould always act prudently when you're dealing with the\npolice.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What is this period of time\nthat we are talking about when Mr. Brendlin might or\nmight not have felt that he was free to leave? As I\nunderstand the facts, the officer recognized him as one\nof the two Brendlin brothers immediately upon\napproaching the car. Isn't that right.\nMR. ZALL: That's -- that right, Your Honor.\nBut again I think, so I think it's just the mere\npresence. It would just be from the time that he got\nout of his parked, of his car after he parked it, and\nthen with his lights on approached the car and then\nlooks in and sees Mr. Brendlin. So that's the period of\ntime that Petitioner would have to establish that a\nreasonable person would not feel free to leave.\nAnd the -- and the comparison with the\nparked car and the other consensual encounter cases of\nthis Court in my view indicate that there is nothing\nthat's been done to the passenger. I mean, the arrest\nof one person as this Court said in Drayton does not\nmean that everyone around him is detained so it doesn't\nseem to the State that anything has been done to the\npassenger. He just was unlucky enough to be in this car\nwhen the driver was stopped for a traffic violation.\nAnd that seems to me fairly unambiguous and we don't\nfeel like a reasonable passenger would not feel free to\nleave in that situation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it may be that we\nwould say because of the exclusionary rule dynamic, we\nhave very little interest in applying the exclusionary\nrule to this but I'm not so sure that we should bend the\nconcept of seizure and say that the passenger hasn't\nbeen seized.\nPerhaps we should be very liberal insofar as\napplying the exclusionary rule and in this case it seems\nto me there is lawful arrest which is intervening cause\nanyway. But I don't know that we should distort the law\nof seizure.\nMR. ZALL: Justice Kennedy, I wouldn't think\nyou're distorting the law of seizure by saying the\npassenger isn't seized. Nothing is done to the\npassenger. He happens to be in this stopped vehicle,\nbut the police have directed no action toward him and so\nI'm not sure that you would be torturing the definition\nat all.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Suppose 10 or 20 years ago\nwe had this case and we decided your way and decided\npassengers are not seized, and then subsequently we had\nthe question of whether an officer could order a\npassenger out of the car. What would be held then?\nWould we have said we can't because he is not seized?\nOr would you say yes, he was seized. I meant if we\ndecided in your case there is no seizure, would we then\nhave later on, do you think said, notwithstanding the\nabsence of a seizure the officer could order the person\nout of the car?\nMR. ZALL: Yeah. Because I think -- because\nI think the weighty interest in officer safety would\nstill allow the officer to have some degree of control\nover the situation. But again seizable does not mean\nseized. The fact that the officer could seize the\npassenger doesn't mean that the passenger is seized.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But in most situations\nwhere an officer meets a person, unless there is a crime\nscene or something like that, he can't order them to\ncross the street or go someplace else, can he? He can't\nissue any order to a citizen.\nMR. ZALL: But again --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But he can issue orders to\npassengers even though they are not seized.\nMR. ZALL: But Justice Stevens, I think\nthat's because of, the Court recognized in Mimms and in\nWilson that there is something inherently dangerous\nabout the traffic stop situation, and there may be\nweapons in the car that the officer can't see, and so\nthat's why this Court found in Wilson that you could\norder the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, but in that case\nthere was a blanket rule. The officer didn't have to\nhave a specific reason. And that it seems to me\nindicates that that's because the person as a general\nrule knows that he or she is seized. If the officer had\nto give a specific reason requiring the person to stand\noutside as the dissent said, then you might have had a\npoint. But I don't think that's what the Court held.\nMR. ZALL: I don't think, Justice Kennedy,\nthat the Court ever indicated that the passenger was\nseized in Wilson prior to the order out. I know there\nwas a dissent that indicated that the passenger wasn't\nseized and the majority never indicated that they\ndisagreed with that point. I think that what happened\nin Wilson is that the Court just felt that -- may I --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish your\nsentence. Sure.\nMR. ZALL: -- the Court just felt that the\nweighty interest in officer safety justified the order\nout, regardless of whether the passenger was seized at\nthe outset.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you Counsel.\nMiss Campbell, you have five minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH M. CAMPBELL,\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMS. CAMPBELL: Thank you. Just to respond\nto that last question very briefly, I agree with Justice\nKennedy that Wilson could not have been decided the way\nthat it was decided had there not been an underlying\nassumption that the passenger is seized, because Wilson\ndoes not require any reasonable suspicion that the\nperson is posing a danger to the driver.\nI'd also like to respond to the State's\nargument that the passenger in this case simply got\nunlucky and he was in a car with someone, that he\nhappened to be in a car with someone who was stopped for\na traffic offense. This passenger wasn't merely\nunlucky; his Fourth Amendment rights were violated by an\nunreasonable stop that was unreasonable from its\ninception. Not only did the officer have no reason to\nmake the stop; he had actually called in and verified\nand gotten affirmative evidence confirming that there\nwas no reason for the stop. So it --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that -- so that,\nstill then, it's just begging the question of whether or\nnot his Fourth Amendment rights were violated. You're\nmaking a good case that the driver's Fourth Amendment\nrights were violated, but why isn't the passenger, as\nyour friend said, just in the unlucky circumstance to\nhave been in a car whose the driver's Fourth Amendment\nrights were violated?\nMS. CAMPBELL: Because Your Honor, this\nCourt has -- this Court held in Delaware versus Prouse,\nthe Court recognized the passengers as well as drivers\nhave a liberty interest in free travel on the highways,\nand because if we look at every case this Court has\ndecided in the last 20 or 30 years regarding when a\nseizure occurs, the case of a passenger in an auto test\n-- in an auto stop meets the test. Under Hodari D we\nneed a show of authority or physical control; in this\ncase we have both. We have the driver response to the\nofficer's show of authority and as a result the\npassenger is, is subject to physical control, as a\ndirect line.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What have we done in a\ncase, and maybe we haven't had it, but what have we done\nin a case where there is a warrantless entry in\nviolation of the Fourth Amendment of somebody's\napartment, and there is a suitcase in there that does\nnot belong to the owner of the apartment? My impression\nis that, that the owner of that suitcase has not been\nsubjected to an unreasonable search and seizure; is that\ncorrect?\nMS. CAMPBELL: If the person has no\nexpectation of privacy in that suitcase that is correct,\nYour Honor. But this Court has recognized in Delaware\nvs. Prouse that a passenger does have a privacy liberty\ninterest in free travel. So it's a different situation.\nOnce again, going back to the Brower case,\nthe, there was some question about whether or not the,\nthe seizure of a bystander would be, would be a seizure\nunder the rule proposed by, by Petitioner in this case.\nBrower talks about an entirely accidental seizure.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but there was only\none, there was just the driver in the Brower case.\nMS. CAMPBELL: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: There was no passenger as\nI recall.\nMS. CAMPBELL: No. But - but under the rule\nproposed by the State if there had been a passenger that\npassenger would not have been seized. But if we look at\nhow this Court --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but I mean in the\ncase it's just not directly on point. That's what we\nare arguing about.\nMS. CAMPBELL: Yes, Your Honor. But if we\nlook at the case next in line case, the County of\nSacramento versus Lewis case, there was a passenger in\nthat case who was struck by the officer in the pursuit,\nand although the Court found no seizure it didn't base\nthat on the fact that the person was a passenger, but on\nthe fact that it was an accidental application of force.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So that's just another\ncase that doesn't help us.\nMS. CAMPBELL: I think it certainly informs\nthe discussion, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But what of the question\nthat was raised about well, a passenger is locked in for\nthe moment, but so are all the cars that are backed up\nbehind the car that's been stopped? What's the\ndifference between the passenger --\nMS. CAMPBELL: In that case, Your Honor,\nthere hasn't been an intentional impeding of those\npeople's free, free movement by the officer. The\nofficer has intentionally stopped this vehicle. And I\n-- I don't think it's really, it's really far-fetched to\nargue that it's reasonably foreseeable that automobiles\noften have passengers in them, and there is certainly a\nlarge body of statutory law at least in California that\nshows that the car can be stopped for reasons related to\nthe passenger.\nSo it's, it's a different situation. We are\nnot looking at an accidental seizure. We are looking at\nan intentional seizure of the car.\nJust to address for a moment whether or not\nremand is appropriate in this case, just to clarify the\nprocedural posture. The intermediate appellate court in\nCalifornia did rule this, that the evidence seized in\nthis case was the fruit of the poisonous tree and should\nbe suppressed. The California Supreme Court did not\ngrant review on that issue and it was not, it's not\nincluded in the question presented. Just for\nclarification. But if the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The California\nSupreme Court didn't have to reach that issue because it\nfound there was no seizure.\nMS. CAMPBELL: No. The court did not -- did\nnot actually request briefing on the issue either.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\n"
