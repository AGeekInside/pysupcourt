        "content": "(11:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear\nargument next in Case 09-5327, Holland v. Florida.\nMr. Scher.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF TODD G. SCHER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SCHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIt is undisputed that Petitioner was not\nprovided notice that the State supreme court had denied\nhis postconviction appeal and had issued its mandate,\nwith the result being that his AEDPA statute of\nlimitations expired. The very day he learned this,\nPetitioner immediately prepared a pro se habeas petition\nand filed it within 24 hours. Before this, Petitioner\nhad taken --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do -- what in the\nrecord shows us that the failure to tell him that by the\nlawyer was anything other than negligence? What in the\nrecord suggests that the lawyer, just as many lawyers\ndo, forgot to call the client, forgot to send him\nsomething? What shows that this is more than\nnegligence?\nMR. SCHER: Well, first of all, we have what\nthe Eleventh Circuit characterized Mr. Collins's conduct\nas, which was gross negligence. And what we have here\nis a confluence --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I'm trying to find\nthe basis for that finding.\nMR. SCHER: We have a repeated pattern. For\nexample, first of all we have to go back in terms of what\nhappened in State court. First we have Mr. Collins's\nassurances to Mr. Holland that he would in fact file his\nFederal -- or was aware of this --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But -- but --\nMR. SCHER: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's what his intent\nwas.\nMR. SCHER: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: People say I'm going to\ndo something, and they fail to do it often because\nsomething else comes up, because something has happened.\nThat doesn't show intentionality in -- the failure to\nact doesn't necessarily prove that it was intentional.\nMR. SCHER: Well -- well, in terms of that\nwhat we have here, for example, is Mr. Collins was given\ntwo opportunities -- or the record shows that there were\ntwo opportunities for Mr. Collins to provide answers to\nthese very questions. The most significant of those\nresponses was -- was in the Federal district court where\nthe Federal district judge in fact issued a show cause\norder to Mr. Collins asking him to respond specifically\nto Mr. Holland's allegations. And in that response Mr.\nCollins completely ignored all of Mr. Holland's\nallegations. He never denied that -- being instructed\nto file the petition. He never denied that he had in\nfact informed Mr. Holland that he wouldn't -- that he\nwould file the petition. He never denied any of the\nallegations with regard to the fact that Mr. Holland\nwanted that Federal habeas petition filed on time. He\njust went on to address --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that -- but that's\nthe case in every case where -- where the lawyer is\nnegligent and doesn't do something that -- that should\nhave been done.\nMR. SCHER: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He has assured the client,\nI will take care of your case, and he doesn't do it.\nMR. SCHER: Well, here we have --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's all that happened\nhere.\nMR. SCHER: This -- this goes beyond the\ncase of mere, garden-variety negligence that some of the\ncourts have -- have addressed, because here we have a\ncombination of not only a failure -- we have the failure\nto notify Mr. Holland that the State supreme court has in\nfact denied its opinion, despite repeated instructions\nfrom Holland to Mr. Collins that he file his petition.\nMr. Holland wrote --\nJUSTICE ALITO: The facts here -- the facts\nhere are quite extreme, but I am troubled by where you\nthink the line should be drawn. If it is just mere\nnegligence, would that be enough for equitable tolling?\nMR. SCHER: No, courts -- and this Court in\nLawrence has held, for example, that mere negligence is\nnot sufficient. What we have here certainly is\nsuggestive --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well -- the difference\nbetween mere negligence and gross negligence -- one of the\nthings I remember most clearly from torts in law school\nis that that's pretty -- that's an ephemeral\ndistinction. But that's the one you one you think we\nshould draw, between mere -- if it's gross negligence,\nthen there's equitable tolling; if it's mere negligence,\nit's not?\nMR. SCHER: Well, we know certainly that the\nfloor from -- from cases from this Court and from other\ncourts is this mere or garden-variety negligence. But\nwhen you get to other factors --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why should -- why should\nthat be? Two cases. Two criminal defendants. One\nspends a lot of time trying to find the most competent\nlawyer he can, and he does. He finds a highly skilled\nlawyer, who makes one little mistake and it's\nnegligence.\nThe other doesn't care. He gets a lawyer\nthat's really incompetent, and the lawyer is grossly\nnegligent.\nNow, you would be penalizing the client who\nexercised the most diligence under your rule. I don't\nunderstand the -- the justice of that. It seems to me\nthat the first client should be better off, not worse.\nNow, maybe this is for your friend on the\nother side to answer as well, but I'm not sure, even\nfollowing Justice Alito's initial line of questioning,\nwe can distinguish between gross and mere\nnegligence, that -- that it's even fair that we do so.\nMR. SCHER: Well, this Court --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I didn't mean to interrupt\nhis line of questioning, but it seems to be consistent\nwith it.\nMR. SCHER: This and other courts have --\nhave been able to draw that line, and, of course you have\nto look at the specifics of each particular case,\nbecause not only --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But what's the -- what's\nthe point? What's the justice in doing that?\nMR. SCHER: Well, the way --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Other than just limit\nthe number of cases in which we are going to set aside\nconvictions?\nMR. SCHER: Well, in some circumstances,\ncourts have just said, unfortunately you lose, your\nattorney didn't commit -- it was just a mere mistake.\nBut what we have here, of course, is not -- we don't\nhave a mere mistake; we have a confluence of these\nparticular factors. And I think one of the more salient\npoints that distinguishes Mr. Holland's case, for\nexample, from Lawrence and from the situation in\nColeman, is that Mr. Holland tried to rid himself of Mr.\nCollins on numerous occasions while this case was in\nState court. In Lawrence and in Coleman, the\npetitioners were not allowed to be free of their\nlawyers; they accepted those lawyers' representation --\nthey accepted their representation and the acts and\nomissions that occurred in Lawrence and in Coleman were\nattributed to -- to the petitioners in those cases.\nHere, however, by contrast, Mr. Holland did\neverything he could -- he could, to be -- reasonably, to\nbe free of --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you -- are you\nsuggesting that there should be a different standard for\nthose habeas petitioners who are -- whose counsel is\nappointed for them by the State or by the Federal\ngovernment, as opposed to just a lawyer they hire?\nThat's what I'm hearing you say.\nMR. SCHER: No, and I didn't mean to suggest\nthat --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So if the\nstandard is going to be the same -- I -- I go back to\nJustice Alito's question, which is, the Eleventh Circuit\nis saying negligence/gross negligence, the line is too\nfine to draw. But there is a difference in a line\nbetween negligence, however one defines it, and an\nintentional, bad faith, dishonest, conflicted\nmalfeasance.\nMR. SCHER: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. Why isn't\nthat a more workable line, given that you can't have\nequitable tolling without exceptional circumstances?\nMR. SCHER: Correct enough, but I think\neach -- well, certainly those were some of the\nindividual factors that the Eleventh Circuit discussed\nwhen saying gross negligence isn't enough. I think in\nMr. Holland's case --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You haven't argued why\nnot, is what I'm saying to you. If exceptional\ncircumstances has to mean something that really makes\nsomething exceptional, why is negligence of any variant\nexceptional?\nMR. SCHER: Because when you look at, for\nexample, in this particular case, when we are talking\nabout an exceptional circumstance, you're talking\nabout a lot of times -- and courts have done this --\nis the confluence of what the attorney did or didn't do\nversus what the petitioner did.\nSo we have, of course -- along the lines of\nthe extraordinary circumstances here, we have\nPetitioner's diligence. And in some respects they\ndovetail. And I think what the Eleventh Circuit did was\nsay we don't care what the Petitioner did; we don't\nreally care what the lawyer did; anything the lawyer did\nunless the lawyer was mentally ill or had divided\nloyalties, then that's -- those are the only factors that\nwere going to be considered in terms of equitable\ntolling.\nBut that is -- that is antithetical to\nthe very nature of equity. Here --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We've never held that\nequitable tolling for anything is available under this\nstatute of limitations here.\nMR. SCHER: That's correct. This Court,\nhowever --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And why should it be? It\nseems to me, this is not like the ordinary statute of\nlimitations, where it says, you know, the statute is five\nyears, and courts make all sorts of necessary exceptions\nto the five years. But here you have a statute that --\nthat provides exceptions, for example, \"the limitation\nperiod shall run from the latest of the date on which\nthe impediment to filing an application created by State\naction in violation ... is removed.\" In other words, we're\ngoing to toll it for that particular event.\n\"The date on which the constitutional right\nasserted was initially recognized by the Supreme\nCourt\" -- we're going to toll it for that.\n\"The date on which the factual predicate of\nthe claim or claims presented could have been discovered\nthrough exercise of due diligence.\"\nMany of -- many of the equitable tolling\nholdings involved precisely that. We'll toll it since\nyou couldn't have found out about the violation within\nthe statutory period.\nBut all of these things are handled already\nin 2244(d). Why should we -- why should we assume the\nright to create some additional exceptions from the --\nfrom the 1-year period?\nMR. SCHER: Well, with all due respect, I\ndon't concur with the premise that those four particular\nsubsections of 2244(d) are exceptions or -- or are\ntolling provisions. Indeed, this Court in Jimenez said\nthat those four, (a), (b), (c) and (d), are --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How many circuits have\nsaid that there is equitable tolling?\nMR. SCHER: Eleven circuits -- all of the\ncircuits, and the only circuit that hasn't held that is\nthe D.C. Circuit where it remains an open question. So\nall of the circuits that have addressed --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then it's a question of\nwhat are exceptional circumstances and whether it has to\nbe something deliberate, which is what the -- as I\nunderstand it, the Michigan Court of Appeals said --\nyes, if it was bad faith -- if it was a lie, a\ndeception --\nMR. SCHER: Correct. And, in fact --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So they're drawing the\nline between intentional and -- and without intending\nbut just being careless.\nMR. SCHER: Correct. And, certainly here, I\nthink we have what they deemed to be gross negligence,\nwhich I think certainly has an element of, let's say, for\nexample, to use the term \"recklessness.\" I mean, we've\ngot six or seven circuits which have addressed this\nparticular issue in terms of this line between mere\nnegligence and -- and something more than that, and those\ncircuits have all -- in the 13 or 14 years since AEDPA\nhas been around, all been able to effectively deal with\nthese particular cases on their particular facts.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We have a case this\nafternoon involving an opinion of ours named McNally,\nwhich held that there's no such thing as a fraud action\nfor a right to honest services. How many of the courts\nof appeals had held that there did exist such a right\nwhen we held that there didn't in McNally?\nMR. SCHER: I'm not familiar.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Every single court of\nappeals that had faced it had held that there was such a\nright. So the mere fact that you have 11 court of\nappeals that have found that they have extraordinary\npower -- judges like to find that they have power -- and\nthat doesn't necessarily make it right.\nMR. SCHER: Well -- and I --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, that also\nassumes that McNally was correctly decided --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- and I don't think it was.\nMay I ask you another question --\nMR. SCHER: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- prompted by Justice\nKennedy's question? Have any of the circuits taken a\nlook at the probable merit of the underlying claim in\nevaluating the issue?\nMR. SCHER: In this particular case or in\nanother case?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, not in this particular\ncase. But Justice Kennedy says it's equally unjust to\nthe client whether it's negligence or gross negligence,\nand I'm just asking whether in any of the reviews of this\nissue, that you are familiar with, have they sometimes\nlooked at the probable merit of the claim, and if there\nwas merit, why, you were more disturbed about attorney\nnegligence, whereas if it's a frivolous claim, they\nwouldn't be. But do you know if any of them take a look\nat that at all?\nMR. SCHER: There are certainly some cases\nthat address the tolling and then, of course, address the\nmerits of the petition. I don't know that there are any\nthat link the two. But, certainly, if you have, for\nexample -- the Respondent has argued that the floodgates\nare just going open, but certainly one of the -- one of\nthe ways that a Federal district court can deal with\nthis and has dealt with this in the past 13 years is to\nlook at the petition. And if the petition raises\nsomething that's so palpably meritless, you don't even\nneed to get to anything about whether it's -- just\ndismiss the petition because, of course, the vast\nmajority of cases that AEDPA addresses in this particular\nchapter are noncapital cases and are pro se cases.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I looked in the brief to\nsee if there was reference to the merits, underlying\nmerits of the case. Can you just tell me very quickly\nwhat the key arguments are, if we ever reach the merits?\nMR. SCHER: In the Petitioner's case?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.\nMR. SCHER: He had -- well, there were a\nnumber of issues that he raised on direct appeal. There\nwas issues regarding counsel. For example, I know in\nthe postconviction motion, one of the key issues was he\nhad a what's termed in Florida \"a Nixon issue,\" which is\nwhere counsel conceded some of the elements of the\ncrime.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I shouldn't probably\ntake your time with that. I will look at the State\nrecord.\nMR. SCHER: But -- but --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Scher, one point that\nyou didn't mention, but you did I thought stress it in\nyour brief, was that counsel here said: Oh, the\ndeadline had run even before I was engaged, even before\nI was appointed to represent this man, so there was\nnothing that I could do for him, because the time had\nalready expired.\nMR. SCHER: That's correct,\nJustice Ginsburg. What happened is that that particular\nexplanation came up after the fact. I think what's\nsignificant about that, number one, is that his\nexplanations have been a moving target to a large\nextent. But what's even more important is that none of\nthat information was ever imparted to Mr. Holland while\nthe case was pending.\nWhile Mr. Collins was providing assurances\nand reassurances to Mr. Holland -- about, don't\nworry, your State postconviction motion will be filed\non time, your Federal rights will be honored, everything\nwill be done, your appeal will be taken, once we are\ndone in the Florida Supreme Court we will go off to the\nFederal district court -- at no time did Mr. Collins ever\nsay: We've got a big problem here; the statute may have\nrun, and so we need to start thinking in advance of ways\nto deal with this.\nFor example, if Mr. Collins truly\nbelieved that the statute had already run, the day the\nFlorida Supreme Court issued that decision, he should\nhave been in Federal court filing something right away.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could you just tell me in a\nsentence or two what test you think we should apply for\nequitable tolling? What is necessary in order for there\nto be equitable tolling?\nMR. SCHER: Your Honor, I think the -- the\ntest is the test that this Court has applied, which is\nin Pace and in Lawrence, which is extraordinary\ncircumstances coupled with diligence. I think under\nthose particular -- coupled with diligence, the\nPetitioner's diligence.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What does \"extraordinary\ncircumstances\" mean?\nMR. SCHER: It's -- it's a case-by-case type of\nissue. It's because it's an equitable remedy. It's not\nsomething that's susceptible to rigid rules, which of\ncourse is the problem with the Eleventh Circuit's\ncategorical exclusion of a particular large chunk of\nmisconduct on the part of the attorney. But certainly\nhere, where we have extraordinary circumstances, we have\nlack of notice to the Petitioner that his State court\nopinion had been issued, that they had affirmed, that\nthe mandate had come out; and a failure to communicate,\nwholesale failure to communicate, bordering on, in fact,\nabandonment --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All of that has nothing to\ndo with -- with what caused -- what caused the inability\nto -- to bring the habeas action.\nMR. SCHER: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All of that is -- is\npreliminary to that. This may have been a very\nirresponsible lawyer, but that has nothing to do with\nthe event that -- the simple event, failure to file in\nthat what, 30-day period, which --\nMR. SCHER: Fourteen days.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Fourteen days. It seems to\nme \"extraordinary\" means unusual. So you say any unusual\nevent is a possible?\nMR. SCHER: Well, I think the one --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Any unusual event is a\npossible for a court to say, oh, yes, it says a year,\nbut this is unusual so we will give you a year and a\nhalf.\nMR. SCHER: Well, I think what we have here\nis what makes this case I think unusual, and it's the\nfirst type of case that this Court has seen, is under\nthese circumstances you have this confluence of events.\nAnd I think what makes this case -- what sets this case\napart from the other ones that this Court has seen and\nthat certainly other courts have seen is, for example,\nit's extraordinary -- or it was diligent for Mr. Holland\nto have asked the Florida Supreme Court on two occasions\nto rid himself of Collins, and he asked to proceed pro se.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The client -- this client\nwas sort of the pesky client, but apparently knew a lot\nmore about AEDPA than most people generally do. I mean,\nAEDPA's not exactly an ordinary term.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And had a lot of time to\ndevote to it.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and suppose you have a\nclient who is just bewildered. He doesn't know AEDPA;\nhe doesn't know Federal court. Why should he be in any\nworse position than this client?\nMR. SCHER: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me it would be\nthe other way around. This fellow knew enough that, if\nhe had really just done a little bit more, he would have\n-- well, he tried to file a petition, but he might have\ndone a little bit more.\nMR. SCHER: Well, I think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the uninformed client,\nthe ignorant client, could never have approached this.\nI don't know why he shouldn't be more protected than\nyour client, which goes back to Justice Alito's question.\nI'm not sure how we draw this line.\nMR. SCHER: I think the problem we have here\nwith Mr. Holland is that the more diligent he was, the\nmore the Respondent and the lower courts have said he\nshould have done. And so he did X, Y, and Z; they say\nyou should have done A, B, and C.\nBut what I think is -- is significant here\nis he was stuck with this lawyer. He tried to get rid of\nthe lawyer. The State filed motions saying you can't --\nnot only can you not fire him, you can't file a pro se\nmotion because you are represented by the lawyer. So all\nMr. Holland hears from the courts is that: You can't speak\nto us and we can't speak to you. So he's stuck.\nAnd then, of course, he's writing to the\nFlorida Supreme Court clerk begging for information, and\nin fact in footnote 11 of the brief --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But he never asked -- he\nwrote to the clerk, but he never asked to be informed\nwhen the judgment came down.\nMR. SCHER: Well, what we have, Your Honor,\nis if you look on page 11, in footnote 11, Mr. Holland\nwrote a letter to the Florida Supreme Court clerk,\ntoward the end of which he says: \"I'm not trying to get\non your nerves. I would just like to know exactly what\nis happening with my case on appeal to the Supreme Court\nof Florida.\"\nSo we certainly have in the clerk's office\n-- and, again, that was on page 11, footnote 11. It's\nalso at the Joint Appendix at 146 to 147.\nWhat we have here is Petitioner putting the\nFlorida Supreme Court on explicit notice that he is\nhaving a problem with his lawyer, and further -- earlier\nin that particular letter, he apologizes to the clerk,\nsaying: I'm sorry to pester you with these -- with these\nrequests, but if I had a lawyer who was responding to my\nletters and who was listening to me and who would send\nme the documentations, I wouldn't have to be bothering\nyou, but this is the situation that I'm in.\nAnd then, of course, he tries to not only have\nMr. Collins substituted, but he asks to go pro se.\nThat's an extraordinary circumstance. And what makes it\neven further, more extraordinary is the State coming in\nand saying, no, you can't not only do that, but you are\nnot even allowed to file the paperwork asking to do\nthat. And, in fact, when Mr. Holland did file his pro se\npetition in Federal district court, the State moved to\nstrike it because he was represented by -- by counsel.\nAnd so --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is this case\ndifferent if the filing error -- I understand there was\na lot going on, but if the lawyer just miscalculated the\ndays and was off by one day, this case comes out the\nother way in your view, right?\nMR. SCHER: I think not only under my -- I\nthink, certainly, courts have -- have discussed this, that\nthat's -- that's just an unfortunate mere mistake. But I\nthink certainly we don't have that under the facts of\nthis case. There has never been any suggestion that\nthere was any miscalculation. We just have\ncomplete abandonment by -- by the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't -- you say --\nyou say \"complete abandonment.\" But this lawyer filed a\nwhole lot of things on behalf of this client. He missed\na very critical thing, the Federal habeas filing. But\nit's not abandonment of a client in the sense of not\ndoing anything for the client.\nSo it goes back to my beginning question,\nwhich is, where is the line drawn between the types of\nnegligence and what the circuit suggested, which is some\nsort of intentional malfeasance?\nMR. SCHER: And I didn't mean to suggest --\nwhen I -- when I used the word \"abandonment,\" I'm -- I'm\nreferring to, of course, in terms of abandonment with\nregard to preserving -- enforcing the assurances that\nCollins had made with respect to filing the petition.\nAnd, of course, he also had told -- that --\nMr. Holland that he would inform him of the Florida\nSupreme Court's decision, because that, of course, is\nthe triggering date.\nWe have Mr. Holland, who had already been --\nyou know, asked his lawyer, you know, please file\ncertain issues in my case and please keep me informed.\nWhen those two promises and assurances were not kept by\nthe lawyer, Mr. Holland at that point has reason to be\nconcerned that the additional promise, which is, I will\nfile on time, was not going to be honored.\nAnd so Mr. Holland embarked on a series of\ndiligent steps in order to get some information, but he\ndidn't know where to turn. And, then, of course, for\nexample, he writes to the clerk's office of the supreme\ncourt. Sometimes they send him information; sometimes\nthey tell him to send a check.\nHe doesn't know. He is not getting any\nconsistency, and he's certainly not getting any response\nfrom his attorney.\nThen he files these motions in the State\nsupreme court, which are opposed by the State as\nnullities because he is represented by counsel. He then\nwrites to the Florida Supreme Court saying, can you give\nme the information about your Web site -- maybe I can have\nsome friends look up this case. Because, of course, he\nknows at this point that there is a problem, and he\nknows that the triggering date for the filing in the\nFederal petition is the denial by the Florida Supreme\nCourt and the issuance of the mandate.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then you are -- you\nseem, from what you just said, to be relying on a\ndistinction between paid counsel, who is just as\ncareless, and court-appointed counsel, because in the\none case the client had picked that attorney, and in the\nother case, the client was given this attorney by the\nState. So I think you're suggesting that the State has\nsome responsibility when it provides the counsel.\nBut before you said, no, your answer would\nbe the same if you were not making a distinction between\ncourt-appointed and paid counsel.\nMR. SCHER: I think the -- the distinction\nthat I was making -- I'm not saying that there's a\ndifference in terms of paid or appointed counsel, but\nhere where you have appointed counsel, I think one of\nthe extraordinary factors is the State coming in and --\nand moving to strike these pro se pleadings, telling\nMr. -- sending a signal to Mr. Holland that you are\nstuck with Collins, you can't speak to the supreme\ncourt, and the supreme court can't speak to you.\nEverything has to be funneled through your lawyer.\nAnd, of course, the ironic thing is that, had\nMr. Holland been permitted to proceed pro se, he would\nhave gotten copied with the decision by the supreme\ncourt of Florida. He would have gotten copied with the\nmandate. And then he would have known when the mandate\nissued.\nAnd as we know, when he found out -- I mean,\nthe other extraordinary factor here is that when he\nfound out that this happened, he prepared that petition\nthat day and mailed it the next day. This is not\nsomebody who sat on his rights. He didn't start\ncomplaining and writing letters and bemoaning his\nsituation. He took action, which also distinguishes\nthis case from a number of others.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess I understand\nwhat the cases have said. I -- I have trouble\nunderstanding why that should make a difference, why\nthat should be so pertinent, why he should be in better\nshape than somebody who says: Look, I don't know\nanything about this. I need a good lawyer. This is what\nI get. I'm trusting you. Tell me what I should do, and I\nleave it in your hands.\nAnd that person is in somehow worse shape?\nMR. SCHER: Well, because in Lawrence and in --\nin Coleman this Court had -- had said that that made a\ndifference. In Lawrence, this Court had said Lawrence\nwas out of luck because it's not like he asked for\nanother lawyer or asked to proceed pro se. And so\nHolland -- and so Lawrence was stuck.\nI would respectfully reserve the remainder\nof my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Makar.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT D. MAKAR\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. MAKAR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case, we believe, is decided by one\nprinciple --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I just ask just an\ninformation question before you -- are the postconviction\nlawyers in these cases that are appointed, are they\ncompensated by the State?\nMR. MAKAR: Yes, they are.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They are.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And also, just in the\ncourse of your argument, how -- how often do these\ndeadlines missed (a) in capital cases and (b) in AEDPA\ncases? Do you have any statistics on that, or can you\ntell us from your experience?\nMR. MAKAR: I can tell you anecdotally the\nattorneys that handle these cases in Florida, that the\nequitable tolling issue comes up with some regularity.\nI'm aware of three cases just in Jacksonville where I\nlive where the district judge there has had evidentiary\nhearings and has looked at these equitable tolling issues.\nIn Florida, we have 394 individuals on death\nrow, and those cases are at various stages in the\nlitigation. So there is a certain amount of that that\ngoes on.\nAs to the noncapital cases, we know that\nthe system is flooded with habeas petitions. Obviously,\nmost of those are unrepresented. But there still is, in\nthose cases -- a study I saw recently, a 2007 study from\nVanderbilt University, that about 20 percent of those\ncases are dismissed on statute of limitations grounds.\nI'm inferring from that that there is some equitable\ntolling action going on there, but the specific amount\nwe're not sure of. But certainly in both the capital\nand noncapital area, this is an issue.\nAnd if I could get to the standard here,\nobviously, we're asking this Court to use the analysis\nit has done in other cases to find that there is no\nequitable tolling whatsoever. We --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You mean to imply that\nearthquake, fire, flood, mad postman burns mail truck,\net cetera?\nMR. MAKAR: Precisely, Your Honor. I\nmean --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, even if it's a terrible\nearthquake, all these people are just out of luck?\nMR. MAKAR: Well -- well, there are some,\ncertainly, safety valves if there's a natural disaster,\nsome --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why? Natural\ndisaster, yes, you said no equitable tolling, they're\nout of luck?\nMR. MAKAR: Well -- well, for example, the\nRules of Federal Procedure were recently amended to\nallow for late filing when the courthouse is inaccessible.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The statute?\nMR. MAKAR: Precisely, Your Honor. And we\nthink --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And, so, are you -- you\nread the statute to say in some cases, you could do it.\nIf you're going to read it in some cases you can do it,\nthen I guess we're at a discussion of is this one of\nthose cases?\nMR. MAKAR: Well, two responses. Number\none, we do not believe that equitable tolling was\nintended by Congress under this complex statute of\nlimitations for all the reasons set out in our brief.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So that's earthquake,\nfire, flood, et cetera?\nMR. MAKAR: Exactly. And it relates to the\nsame result, it seems -- to the same result as this Court\ncame to in Beggerly and Brockamp, where the -- if\nCongress intended that to be the case, that's the case.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if the lawyer lies to\nthe client and the client says my time is running out,\nhave you filed my -- my Federal habeas petition, and the\nlawyer says, yes, I filed it and here it is, and it has\na -- a forged date stamp on it? No equitable tolling\nthere?\nMR. MAKAR: Well, under our position that\nCongress intended to draw a very clear line, no. If\nthe -- if the Court assumes or decides there is some\nsort of equitable tolling, then that's a different case,\nand -- and in those situations where there's something\nbeyond the incompetence of the lawyer. And that's our rule.\nIf the Court decides there is equitable tolling or\nassumes it exists, it has to be that the rule that the\nincompetence of the postconviction counsel cannot be a\nbasis for relief.\nThat's what this Court has essentially said\nin Lawrence and also in Coleman, and also what Congress\ninferentially said in -- in 2254(i).\nSo, under those circumstances, here our rule\nworks because you don't get into those gradations of\nnegligence, you know, is it gross negligence? Well,\nhow gross? And the bottom line here in this particular case,\nof course -- and the Court has asked these questions\nhere -- is what really happened in this case? All you\nhad was a Lawrence error, which was --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why should it matter?\nIt's certainly unusual. Isn't that what we are after, one,\nis he diligent? Answer, yes, he has been diligent.\nTwo, is it extraordinary? I would think it\nwas fairly extraordinary that a person writes these letters\nto counsel and so forth, then the -- the thing isn't\nfiled. Is that extraordinary or not?\nWhether it was his fault, whether he himself\nwas kidnapped. I mean, maybe it wasn't the counsel's\nfault. You can imagine a lot of circumstances. But the\nquestion, I would think, is, is it extraordinary and is\nit fair?\nMR. MAKAR: Well, the answer -- is it\nextraordinary? The answer is no. This is common --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You mean counsel in Florida\noften when -- miss deadlines and so forth when their\ncounsel -- when their client specifically says to them,\neven a few weeks before and by mail several times,\nplease file such-and-such, is not extraordinary in\nFlorida?\nMR. MAKAR: It's not just Florida; it's\nnationwide there's -- there's problem with this complex\nstatute of limitations --\nJUSTICE BREYER: We have a problem with\nthe bar, don't we, if -- if -- if the -- if --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MAKAR: Well, there -- there has been no\nbar discipline, to my knowledge, for missing a\ndeadline. And that -- and this Court has held that is not\nan extraordinary circumstance, in Lawrence. The only --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I -- I didn't hear.\nYou say there has been discipline or there --\nMR. MAKAR: To my knowledge, there has not\nbeen for missing a deadline.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If we or -- this would\nprobably be the Congress -- assuming some rule maker had\nprobably be the Congress, assuming some rulemaker had\nauthority to do this, would it make sense to say\nthat the State is going to be subject to equitable\ntolling on a rather broad standard -- we're going to\ngive equitable tolling often -- unless the State has\nattorney discipline procedures, so that this happens\nonly once and then the attorney can no longer practice\nin the Federal courts?\nMR. MAKAR: I suppose as a matter of --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Obviously, what we're\nlooking for is some sort of a rule to keep the deadline,\nand if we're going to accommodate your friend on the\nother side, to have -- to have some rule about\nexceptional -- exceptional cases.\nMR. MAKAR: Well, perhaps something along\nthose lines legislatively might be -- be considered, but\n-- but in the end, what we have here is garden-variety\nattorney negligence miscalculating and missing a\ndeadline. The --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't there at least one\nadditional thing here? Holland filed a request -- a pro\nse request to be relieved of Collins's representation,\nand that was rejected by the -- that was rejected by the\ncourt because he was pro se. And therefore he couldn't\nask -- he couldn't file something himself?\nMR. MAKAR: Well, let me clarify that,\nbecause there's a misconception going on here. In the\nFlorida Supreme Court postconviction process, Collins\n-- I'm sorry, Holland twice filed motions to remove\nCollins. Importantly, Holland never asked to go pro se.\nThat is incorrect. If you look at Joint Appendix 134\nand 149 -- those are the two pro se filings that Holland\nmade here. In both of those, he said: I'm having a\nconflict with my lawyer. My lawyer won't do what I want\nhim to do; I want a new lawyer.\nAnd that's all he said: I want a new lawyer.\nHe never --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Was that denied on the\nground that he was pro se?\nMR. MAKAR: The first motion was stricken.\nIt was then denied because he was represented by counsel\nat that point. Keep in mind, this is in the State\npostconviction process. This is not where the Federal\nAEDPA deadline and so forth is being kicked about. In\nfact, there is really no discussion whatsoever about\nwhat the actual deadline to file this petition was at\nall in the record.\nThe only time Holland asked to go pro se in\nany court filing is after he filed the pro se petition\nin Federal court -- the untimely one. He then shortly\nthereafter filed an emergency motion to relieve Collins,\nand --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What I don't understand is,\nhow can a -- how can a client request to have -- to be\nrelieved of representation, if the client can't file\nthat motion pro se? I understand the other things, but\nI don't understand why -- how -- how you can deny the\nrequest to get rid of this lawyer? Unless he has to\nhave the lawyer file the motion for him?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MAKAR: No, I think that certainly the\nfiling of the motion, I think perhaps it was -- it shouldn't\nhave been stricken the first time, but the court then on the\nmerits denied it the second time. And keep in mind -- I\nforget who alluded to it -- this has been somewhat of an\nunusual case from the outset, in that if you look at the\nthree Florida Supreme Court opinions that have been\nissued in this case, it shows that at the first trial\nHolland absented himself from the -- absented himself\nfrom the trial and he had to watch on circuit --\nclosed-circuit TV because he was being very difficult.\nAnd then in the second trial, we had two\nFaretta hearings amounting to hundreds of pages in which\nthe Florida Supreme Court then said, well, he wants to\nrepresent himself, but he can't conduct himself properly\nand so forth. And also there's the issue of his -- his\n-- there's a mental issue there as well, that he has\nraised on appeal as well.\nSo the court -- the Florida courts are sort\nof put in this difficult posture of saying, we want you\nto have counsel, we need you to have counsel because we\nwant you to have effective representation, but then\nthroughout the process here it's been a difficult,\ndifficult number of decades, essentially, in this\nsituation. So I think it's an unfair characterization\nto say that the Florida courts and also the Office of\nAttorney General who -- who routinely moves to\nstrike these -- it's not because we're trying to deny\nanyone's day in court. It's because you have a lawyer\nand they have to speak to the lawyer, and the hybrid\nrepresentation is impermissible. So --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can we go back to\njust --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The State -- the State\nhas no responsibility even though it made this\nappointment? So you agree there's no difference,\nwhether it was paid counsel, somebody that the -- that\nthe defendant picked to represent him, and someone that\nhe just had to take because it's what the State gave him?\nMR. MAKAR: Exactly. And -- and that's the\nway the Court's decision in Coleman has allocated the\nburdens and the risks. I mean, what the Court said was\nokay, if it's a direct appeal where the State is charged\nwith that responsibility, that's one thing; but when\nit's postconviction, it's shifted. The whole paradigm\nand whole structure is flipped the other way, and you,\nthe Petitioner, bear the burden, and not the State.\nThis is important under AEDPA, because AEDPA --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Under -- on direct appeal,\nif counsel conducted himself this way, the State\nwould -- he'd have to get relief because the State\nwould have the burden, but not -- not on collateral?\nIs that what you're saying?\nMR. MAKAR: Sure. On direct appeal, if the\nlawyer is deemed to be ineffective, then that would be a\nconstitutional error, and that would be subject to some\nsort of relief, but it flips in the postconviction\nstage, as this Court has held in Coleman.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I'm\nconcerned about some of the situations Justice Breyer\nmentions, you know, if there is an earthquake, a plane\ncrash, but the law seems to be focusing on other things\nwhen it's talking about extraordinary circumstances.\nLike here, we're talking about how diligent he was in\npursuing his lawyer. There seems to be a disconnect\nthere.\nI don't know why -- I mean, assuming we're\ngoing to have, for argument, equitable tolling, what\nshould we be looking at? The unusual nature of the\nsituation that comes up, or whether you've got a pesky\nclient?\nMR. MAKAR: Well, I think two responses\nthere: Obviously, we believe that attorney incompetence\nor so forth cannot be a basis for equitable tolling.\nThese other situations about natural disasters and\nhypotheticals where some, you know, very unusual, bizarre\nsituation comes in that's external to the\nattorney-client relationship, perhaps those -- those\ncould be considered.\nBut we believe that the Congress, through its\npurpose in enacting this statute of limitations, a\ncomplex one that has exceptions, that -- that is\ndesigned to alleviate the burdens and delays -- its intent\nwas not to allow equitable tolling, because we --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it\nlegislated against the background of cases like Irwin\nthat stated the general proposition is, unless Congress\nsays otherwise, there is equitable tolling.\nMR. MAKAR: But that can be rebutted. That\ncan be rebutted, and we believe has been rebutted by the\nrecord here, which shows that these are precisely the\nkind of delays that Congress intended to avoid by having\na strict 1-year statute of limitations, that there's\nburdens put on -- not just the States but the courts --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- what I worry about\nis that you're confusing the -- or perceive --\nconfusing the fact that lawyer negligence may not be the\ntype of situation that Congress was looking at. With\nthe hypotheticals that Justice Breyer listed, which are\na different kind of situation, and you are trying to\npigeonhole both and say Congress didn't intend for both\nto be covered. And yet you suggested a little later\nthat they may have intended what Justice Breyer was\nthinking about. I -- I don't see anything in the\nstructure of the statute that would preclude what\nJustice Breyer listed.\nMR. MAKAR: Well --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what can we read to\nsuggest that -- forget about the lawyer malfeasance;\nlet's talk just about equitable tolling\nMR. MAKAR: Sure. Well --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- in its traditional\nsense. Most of the cases in equitable tolling, by the way,\nhave to do with court errors.\nMR. MAKAR: Sure. What we're suggesting is\nthat under the structure of the Brockamp decision, what\nthe Court looked at there to determine when there is no\nequitable tolling intended by Congress, that here\nlikewise there is no equitable tolling, and as the Court\nheld in Brockamp, the fact that there may be unfairness\nin individual cases was the price Congress was willing\nto pay, the tradeoff it was willing to allow, to have a\nhabeas system that was functioning.\nNow, assuming that position is rejected by\nthe Court or the Court assumes equitable tolling, the\nnext question is what should be allowed. And we believe\nit has to be exceptionally narrow. And certainly in\nthis case -- and this case is all about attorney\nnegligence or attorney gross negligence -- those --\nthose sort of circumstances are not enough. And --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why could you not say\nhere -- I mean, the key sentence, I take it, is the\nEleventh Circuit and it says: \"No allegation of lawyer\nnegligence or failure to meet the standard of care\" --\nnone -- without \"proof, bad faith, dishonesty, mental\nimpairment\" on the part of the lawyer, could ever\nqualify.\nNow, that's -- so we just say, no, no, that\nisn't so. Sometimes it could, when combined with other\ncircumstances. And then go back and let them -- I don't\nknow what this particular individual Petitioner's prior\nconduct has been. I understand the problems that you\nhave. But do you -- I guess you're going to say no to\nthis, but -- but it's a little hard to see why you couldn't\nhave a narrow standard but just not rule out the\npossibility that under certain circumstances, just\nnegligence or even less -- maybe the lawyer wasn't even\nat fault; maybe he got kidnapped. You know, I mean, there\nare odd things that happen in life. And just say go look for\nthis; see if it's truly extraordinary, if it's fair, if\nhe was diligent. What about that?\nMR. MAKAR: Well, we agree with the Eleventh\nCircuit standard to the extent it says, you know, that this\nsort of attorney negligence, gross negligence, incompetence,\nis not enough. Where we differ from the Eleventh Circuit\nis we're concerned, based upon our pragmatic day-in,\nday-out handling of these cases, that when you say\ndishonesty, well -- or a conflict -- that those concepts\ncan be conflated into things that they are not,\nparticularly when these communications between lawyer\nand client are outside the State's view. We are not\nprivy to what goes on between lawyer and client. The\nlawyer says, I will do this, says it verbally or maybe\neven in writing. We don't know about that. We're not\nprivy to all that.\nAnd it creates this potential, when we allow\nthe standard, as the Eleventh Circuit held -- we allow the\nstandard to gravitate away from its core purpose and\nallows it to be used to sort of game the system in a way\nto gain an advantage. That's why we are concerned about\nany degree of attorney misconduct or behavior because it\ncould easily --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you have any idea,\nbefore the Eleventh Circuit announced its standard, how\nmany habeas petitions were tolled by district courts in\nthat -- in your -- in Florida, on the basis of equitable\ntolling, that -- that they permitted petitions to go\nforward after the statute of limitations?\nMR. MAKAR: Unfortunately, I'm not aware of\nany data on that. There are not that many.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So would there be -- I\nmean, what I'm actually worried about is not a lawyer\nbeing kidnapped. I'm actually worried what can\nhappen in a person's life. He gets deathly ill. His wife\ngets sick. Something happens to the children. Some very\nunusual thing comes along at the last minute, and all the\nplans go awry. And to have a little bit of flexibility\nin this statute to take care of those very unusual human\ncircumstances seems a reasonable reading of it. But you\nsay it's not because --\nMR. MAKAR: Well, we say it's not because\nCongress intended not to have equitable tolling, and\nthen to the extent it did, it could have drafted\nsomething along the lines of what's in 2263, which is\nthe next chapter -- it's the companion chapter that says\ninstead of having 365 days with no equitable tolling,\nyou can have 180 days and 30 days for good cause if\nthere's a deadline missed --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're not -- you're\nnot worried about Justice Breyer's case of the really\nextraordinary circumstance where everybody would say,\nwell, that's -- you know, we understand. You're\nworried that if you create an exception, that all sorts\nof other stuff will come in. And so why isn't the answer\nto that concern that you've got an unusual case here\nwhere you do have the client saying, do this, do this,\ndo this, and the lawyer doesn't?\nMR. MAKAR: Well, under these facts --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's very hard to\nargue against -- against equity, against equitable\ntolling. But at the same time, I think you do need a\nconstraining principle that it doesn't do away with the\nstatute of limitations. So why isn't what we have here\ngood enough?\nMR. MAKAR: Meaning the Eleventh Circuit's\nstandard?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Meaning the fact\nthat you have got a client who is constantly telling the\nlawyer, do this, you know, get it done; doesn't get the\njudgment. And, you know, it's not just your run-of-the-mill\ncase where the lawyer happens to miss a deadline.\nMR. MAKAR: Well, that goes to the issue\nthat -- of not -- of diligence, of course, which is not\nthe issue we're looking at. We're looking at the\nextraordinary circumstances, not the diligence.\nExtraordinary circumstance has to be something that --\nattributable to the lawyer or something along those lines.\nWe're not -- we'll concede diligence for the\nmoment and say here it's what the lawyer did, as\nLawrence held. He missed the deadline. In fact,\nthis case -- you know, Lawrence, obviously -- it was 364\ndays before they even filed the State postconviction motion,\nand the lawyer in that case wasn't appointed for 300 days,\nand the State postconvictions process was sort of in\ndisarray. And all those things that the Court in\nLawrence said are not supportable for equitable tolling\napply equally here.\nThe only difference in this case is this\nallegation about the -- the lawyer didn't communicate\nwith his client. Well, if that becomes the governing rule,\nall is lost, because attorney communication with client\nis perhaps even more amorphous a concept. It could be\nbased on verbal representations and so forth. So we are\nvery concerned that it not slip into that sphere where\nit can be easily manipulated for the advantage of\ngetting some sort of delay.\nAnd as I say, the analysis here of\npurpose of AEDPA, structure of AEDPA, and the\nburdens -- as I say, the burdens are important to the\nState and to the court system. I was looking at that\nrecent study, the 2007 study, that seemed to suggest\nthat AEDPA is -- basically, when these cases are being\nfiled in Federal district court, it has taken a year and\na half to 2, 3 years for them to be resolved, and in\nthis case keep in mind it took 18 months in the district\ncourt, 18 months in the Eleventh Circuit, and then\nfurther.\nBut that's allowing the invocation of this\ndoctrine, not just in this case. We're worried about the\nnoncapital context as well, that that will somehow put\nan end to the importance of what Congress enacted.\nThere is a pre-AEDPA mentality out there,\nI'm afraid. And it's natural. It's understandable.\nWe're all human. There's a pre-AEDPA mentality that\nthere must be a remedy. There must be some equity done.\nAnd I think that sort of undergirds why perhaps most of\nthe circuits have either assumed -- I think 11 have\neither assumed or adopted some sort of equitable\ntolling.\nI think they are waiting for this Court,\nwhich has left the question open to provide guidance on\nthat issue, and we suggest that either there be no\nequitable tolling or that, if there is to be equitable\ntolling, on the circumstances of this case it has to be\nextreme attorney misconduct or incompetence, and that\njust simply is not established on this record.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- why isn't it\nextreme attorney incompetence to miss a deadline? I\nmean, you either miss it or you don't. It's not going\nto get -- why doesn't that qualify as extreme attorney\nmisconduct?\nMR. MAKAR: Well, I guess the short answer,\nof course, is the courts have said no, that's not\nenough, we need something that's truly extreme,\nsomething far from just missing a deadline. We probably\nall know lawyers who have missed deadlines. We all know\nlawyers who haven't communicated with their clients.\nThose things are ordinary, run-of-the-mill, happen-every-day\nsort of events. It has to be something beyond that.\nIt has to be something that is truly extreme for\nthe exception to kick in.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, give me\nan example.\nMR. MAKAR: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's worse than\nmissing the deadline.\nMR. MAKAR: I mean, the example I've tossed\nabout in our conversations is -- is to say, well, what if\nthe postconviction lawyer is bribed by the victim's family\nto not file something on time? I mean, oh gosh, that\nstrikes us all as just -- that's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we don't --\nthat's not negligence.\nMR. MAKAR: No. No. But the question I\nthought you were asking is, you know, how extreme can\nwe think about a situation, and -- and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you're -- it\nhas to be criminal behavior?\nMR. MAKAR: It has to be something beyond\njust attorney incompetence. What the -- that's a\nconcept that we can get our arms around, and we\ncertainly get into this line-drawing of, well, is a\nfailure to communicate three or four times enough? Or a\nfailure to have a letter go to the client in response to\nhis request -- is that enough?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask another\nquestion? It doesn't go to the merits, but I'm really\ncurious. The lawyers selected for postconviction work,\nwhich I understand now are compensated by the State, are\nthey selected from the same panels as the lawyers that\nrepresent defendants generally and who are appointed by\nthe State in criminal matters?\nMR. MAKAR: Well, there's a collateral counsel\nregistry list.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is it --\nMR. MAKAR: There's actually what they call\nCCRC. There's actually State lawyers around the State who\nprovide this, and then there's a registry list as well.\nAnd they have to meet certain standards. Chapter 27 of\nour Florida Statutes set out the standards that these\ncounsel have to meet.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the collateral counsel\nregistry is a different group of lawyers than are\ngenerally appointed in criminal cases?\nMR. MAKAR: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I see.\nMR. MAKAR: Well, Your Honors, if there's\nno further questions, we ask that the court affirm the\nEleventh Circuit below, either on the basis that there's\nno equitable tolling or that on this record there's\nno basis for it under the attorney incompetence\nstandard.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Scher, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TODD G. SCHER\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. SCHER: I just have a couple of brief\npoints. First, to clarify, the Respondent argued that\nMr. Holland never asked to proceed pro se in the State\ncourt, and that's just incorrect, and it's flatly\ncontradicted by their brief on page 43, where they\nwrite: \"Holland moved to replace Collins with another\nattorney (whom Holland presumably thought would raise\nany issues Holland desired) or to proceed pro se if\nsubstitute counsel could not be appointed.\"\nAnd I think, again, going back to one of\nthe things that Justice Breyer was discussing with\nRespondent's counsel, was I think that that -- the\nproblem with the Eleventh Circuit's analysis is this\ncategorical exclusion. Equitable tolling and\nextraordinary circumstances have to be considered as\na -- consider all the circumstances, and so to\ncategorically exclude this one particular area,\nwe submit, is what the problem is here.\nAnd we also do have, contrary to what\nthe Respondent contended --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you would say --\nit is -- you could categorically excuse ordinary\nnegligence as opposed to gross negligence?\nMR. SCHER: That's where courts, including\nthis Court, have drawn the line. That seems to be the\nfloor, but, you know, obviously, when you get into the\nparticular circumstances of a case, that's where a\ncategorical rule excluding a particular type of area\nbeyond just garden-variety neglect -- really, that's\nthe problem here, is that was antithetical to the\nnotion of equity.\nAnd I just wanted to point out briefly that\nthis record does avail itself of numerous instances where\nMr. Holland had alleged that the attorney lied to him. JA\n-- in the Joint Appendix on 170, Mr. Holland writes that\nMr. Collins lied to him. On the Joint Appendix on 194,\nthat Mr. Collins deceived him and misled him --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What were the lies?\nMR. SCHER: -- about when the petition was\ngoing to be --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What was -- give me an example\nof a lie that he told him?\nMR. SCHER: These were in the context of Mr.\nCollins telling Mr. Holland that he would protect his\nFederal habeas rights. Those --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Doesn't that go without\nsaying, that every attorney -- and every attorney presumably\nundertakes not to miss the statute of limitations? Is\nthere a difference between the attorney who simply says\nnothing and the attorney who says, yes, I'm not going to\nmiss the statute of limitations?\nMR. SCHER: I think it makes it more --\nJUSTICE ALITO: That's a lie?\nMR. SCHER: I think it makes it makes\nit more extraordinary. And what makes that situation\neven yet more extraordinary is where the client has\ntried to rid himself of this lawyer on a number of\noccasions or to go pro se, precisely because he has been\nexperiencing these -- these -- lack of trust and other\nproblems in terms of these deceptions from his lawyer,\nso he was really hamstrung by the time that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If I'm worried --\nMR. SCHER: -- it was too late.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If I'm worried about\nthe open-ended nature of what you're asking for, how --\nhow would you state the test you would like in the most\nrestrictive terms?\nMR. SCHER: I think in terms -- I think the\ntest would be appropriate, what Justice Breyer\narticulated, which is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Hurricane or\nkidnapping?\nMR. SCHER: No, no.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, the different\none.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SCHER: No, the other test, the other\ntest. We need a hurricane exception in Florida.\nBut in terms of the Eleventh Circuit was\nincorrect in excluding this particular type of attorney\nmisconduct and negligence because that's antithetical\nto equity, and so I think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What type -- the\nproblem comes up when you say \"this type of attorney\nnegligence.\"\nWhat is your test? What type of --\nMR. SCHER: I certainly think, given the\nunique facts here, we have, again, the confluence of\ncircumstances. We have the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I know your test\nwill mean your client wins.\nMR. SCHER: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But, I mean, can you\narticulate it more -- because I'm very concerned that if\nyou start saying, well, you can forgive an inequitable case,\nevery time a case comes up, you're going to -- there's\ngoing to be sympathy for the client. The lawyer goofed.\nOf course, you don't want to penalize the\nclient, but Congress obviously had something more in\nmind.\nMR. SCHER: Well, but certainly -- but the other\npart of the test for equitable tolling is diligence, and\nI think, when -- when one looks at the -- at the body of\ncase law that has developed since 1997 on the issue of\nequitable tolling and AEDPA, the vast majority of these\ncases are disposed on the fact that the Petitioner is\nindiligent.\nHere, of course, the Respondent, if I heard\ncorrectly, is now conceding that the Petitioner was\ndiligent. And so there are certainly other ways to avoid\neven having to get to the question of exceptional\ncircumstances; for example, just looking to the\ndiligence prong.\nBut here, where you have a failure to\nnotify, you have the failure to heed the instructions from\na client, you have the client saying you've lied to\nme, the client telling the State and the Federal courts\nthis lawyer is not my agent anymore, I don't want him, I\ndon't trust him, he has misled me, he has deceived me --\nall of those factors certainly go to a consideration of\nwhether equitable tolling should be warranted, and the\nproblem here is that the Eleventh Circuit said no,\ncategorically no.\nThank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
