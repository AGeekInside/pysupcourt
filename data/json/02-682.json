        "content": "(10:50 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in No. 02-682, Verizon Communications v. the Law\nOffices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP.\nMr. Taranto.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD G. TARANTO\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. TARANTO: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nOn the facts alleged, Trinko cannot sustain its\ncomplaint unless the Court newly recognizes a section 2\nduty of a monopolist to turn over its sales to rivals by\nsharing its assets at specially discounted prices, that\nis, a duty to dismantle itself.\nOur argument is that that hasn't ever been a\nsection 2 duty and shouldn't now be made into one.\nQUESTION: We have an Illinois Brick problem\nbefore we even get to the substantive question, don't we?\nI mean, why -- why should we entertain this -- this case\nat all?\nMR. TARANTO: I don't think that Illinois Brick\n-- in fact, I think Illinois Brick is not a jurisdictional\npoint. It is a question of cause of action that goes to\ncertain kinds of damages.\nQUESTION: Well, I understand, but -- but those\n-- those standing rules that are not jurisdictional are\nstill standing rules, and we normally apply them. Why\nshould we not apply our normal rule of standing in this\ncase?\nMR. TARANTO: Well, we -- we do think you\nshould, but that it shouldn't preclude the Court from\nreaching the merits, which are of much broader importance.\nThat is, in the absence of the rule being a jurisdictional\none, the Court has the option of considering either of two\ngrounds for reversing and reinstating the dismissal, just\nas the Court did in the sovereign immunity case involving\nIsrael last year where there were two alternative grounds.\nQUESTION: Well, it seems to me --\nMR. TARANTO:\nmore --\nQUESTION: It seems to me you're just trying to\nrush to the merits. I -- I think the standing and the\nissues are very serious issues here.\nMR. TARANTO: Oh, we -- we think so as -- as\nwell, and let me -- let me address that briefly.\nQUESTION: What you're -- what you're saying\nbasically it's a claim for relief issue rather than a --\nthan a jurisdictional issue.\nMR. TARANTO: Yes, yes. The -- the statutory\nstanding question has always been treated as a question of\nwhat the meaning of section 4 of the Clayton Act, the\ndamages provision, is here, and both the indirect\npurchaser rule and the more general indirectness aspect of\nAssociated General Contractor has to do with who can get\nwhat kinds of relief. That's not a jurisdictional\nquestion, and therefore it remains open to this Court to\ndo what we think the Court should do, which is also to\naddress the question that is directly dividing the\ncircuits, what is the scope of section 2. And --\nQUESTION: Mr. Taranto, you made a -- an\ninteresting classification, and I think I tend to agree\nwith it, but I'm not sure that these Court's cases fit\nthat mold.\nI had thought that the things that are put under\nthe head of, quote, prudential standing sound like does\nthis person have a claim under this statute for relief.\nThat's a 12(b)(6) question. But the Court seems to have\n-- think that there's something in between constitutional\nstanding, which everyone agrees exists here, and 12(b)(6),\nand that's this prudential standing notion.\nIs there a difference between the 12(b)(6)\ninquiry, does this statute afford this plaintiff a claim\nfor relief, and what this Court has called prudential\nstanding?\nMR. TARANTO: The best that I can do with that\nis to describe what the Court has done in the cases that\nwe rely on for saying there's no statutory standing.\nAssociated General Contractors and Illinois Brick and its\nfollow-on, Kansas against UtiliCorp, are all about the\ninterpretation of section 4 of the Clayton Act. In that\nsense, they are classic 12(b)(6) questions. The entire\nanalysis in Associated General Contractors is about what\nthe term injury to business or property means. They are\ninterpretive questions in that way. They're not separate\nprudential standing questions somewhere between\nconstitutional standing and statutory coverage. And\nthat's why we think it is both proper and really quite\nimportant for purposes of the several other circuit cases\nthat are now sitting in cert petitions in this Court on\nthe merits question that divides the circuits.\nThere is no section 2 duty on the merits now to\nturn over your sales to a rival. This Court said, as far\nback as 1920 in the U.S. Steel case, section 2 does not\ncondemn mere size. Section 2 does not compel competition.\nThe 1996 act does. It has a quite different policy. It\nsays we will mandate creation of competition. Section 2\nsays we protect against affirmative interferences in\nindependently arising competition. They're fundamentally\ndifferent statutory approaches to a highly general goal of\ncompetition.\nQUESTION: Is this a kind of refusal to deal\ncase? So it could be covered in theory by section 2?\nMR. TARANTO: It is a kind of refusal to deal.\nIt is -- all of the claims in this case, all of the facts\nallege inadequate help to rivals to come and displace\none's own sales. This Court has broadly recognized that\nsection 2 protects the right to just make your sales and\nnot turn them over to rivals with a category of\nexceptions. Every one of those exceptions, the refusal to\ndeal cases, involves discrimination. The firm was\nvoluntarily in the business of selling the product that\nthe plaintiff wanted, and the plaintiff wanted it at the\nterms that the firm was selling it to others, and the\ndefendant said, no.\nThat threshold condition has so far been the\nonly sufficiently reliable one to trigger the inquiry, if\nyou're selling it to some -- to everybody else, why not to\nthe particular plaintiff? And the answer, we're not\nselling to the plaintiff because the plaintiff is a rival\nor the plaintiff is dealing with a rival, has been the one\nexception to the general rule that forced sales to help\nrivals is not adequate. Discrimination doesn't mean that\n-- mean illegality. There may be good reasons, but it so\nfar has been the necessary threshold condition for\ndemanding an inquiry.\nThis case does not involve any kind of\ndiscrimination like that. There's no allegation here.\nThere couldn't be an allegation that Verizon was in the\nbusiness of renting out its facilities to rivals at\nspecially discounted prices before the 1996 act compelled\nthat.\nSo for Trinko to prevail here, it would have to\n-- the Court would have to recognize something brand new\nunder section 2. It would have to expand section 2 to\nwhere it has never been before, and we submit there are\nextremely good reasons for not doing that.\nQUESTION: And the reason Otter Tail -- Otter\nTail seems like the strongest precedent against you.\nBefore you say the reasons against expansion, I'd just\nlike to hear 30 seconds on why in your opinion Otter Tail\nis different than this.\nMR. TARANTO: Otter Tail was also a case of\ndiscrimination. If -- the opinion in Otter -- in Otter\nTail is a little bit shy on full explanation for what\nfactors matter, and so one has to look at what the facts\nwere. If you look at the extensive findings of fact by\nthe district judge, which are in the -- not the appendix\nof this case but the appendix in Otter Tail, there's an\nentire section called discrimination. Otter Tail at -- at\nJA 103 to 111.\nOtter Tail was undisputedly in the business of\nwholesaling power and of wheeling power to others. When\nparticular communities came and said we want from you the\nsame thing that you're happily selling to others, Otter\nTail said no.\nThat's exactly the same kind of discrimination\nthat existed in Aspen Skiing where the three mountain\ndefendants said, we won't even take full price ski tickets\nfrom people who are using the fourth mountain because\nthat's a rival. So discrimination was the predicate there\ntoo.\nThis is not a case of discrimination. In the\nabsence of discrimination, any court entertaining a\nsection 2 duty would have to undertake tasks that\nantitrust has never viewed as appropriate. It would have\nto ask what are the effects on long-run investments, the\nlong-term effects on investments.\nQUESTION: Well, now you're back into the\nmerits, aren't you?\nMR. TARANTO: Yes, yes.\nQUESTION: Yes. Did you finish with the inquiry\nof whether we should recognize this plaintiff?\nMR. TARANTO: Well, I -- we think not really for\n-- for a combination of reasons. All of the factors in\nAssociated General Contractors I think point in the same\ndirection. The injury here is indirect. That is, Trinko\nwas a customer of AT&T which was a customer of Verizon,\nand Trinko's injury was only an indirect result of the\nalleged injury to AT&T. The additional considerations\npoint in the same direction. There's obviously a better\nplaintiff. AT&T.\nQUESTION: But AT&T didn't bring an antitrust\naction.\nMR. TARANTO: Well, the -- the final -- final\nreason I'll mention here is that recognizing the statutory\ncause of action here would also interfere with the\nvoluntarily agreed upon nonjudicial dispute resolution\nmechanism that AT&T and Verizon entered into.\nQUESTION:\nSecond Circuit, whose decision we're reviewing, seemed to\nthink that AT&T was not, as you expressed it, the better\ncomplainant, but that the remedy for AT&T was the\nadministrative context. I -- I thought his opinion\nsuggested that for AT&T the remedy was the administrative\nroute, but for the customer who has no place else to go,\nit was court or nothing because the customer would not\nhave access to that administrative process.\nNow, is there -- first of all, is -- would AT&T\nhave standing or state a claim for relief if AT&T had been\nthe plaintiff here?\nAnd second, if you're right that this plaintiff\nhas no claim in court, is there anyplace that this\nplaintiff can go with the complaint? The reality is --\nand we accept what the complaint alleges as true for\ncurrent purposes -- I have gotten the worst service. It's\na constant embarrassment. I've lost clients. I've lost\nmy professional reputation. That's a legitimate\ncomplaint. Is there anyone in the world that that can be\nasserted against?\nMR. TARANTO: Let me take those in -- in order,\nif I may.\nAT&T could, of course, have brought a Sherman\nAct suit had it not expressly waived its right to go to\ncourt.\nrelief far more promptly than any antitrust case would\nhave -- would have obtained. So it's like --\nQUESTION: But it had no choice in that. I\nmean, that's a statutory mechanism. There's no\nindependent waiver that AT&T, as apart from others, what\nthey call them, CLEC's. It's -- it's an -- it's a regime\nimposed on all the participants, isn't it?\nMR. TARANTO: Well, that -- that -- nondispute\njudicial -- dispute judicial -- nonjudicial dispute\nresolution was here part of an agreement. It's not in the\nstatute. Many agreements contain it. Some agreements do\nnot contain it. This one does. And it serves very\nimportant statutory functions of providing what here took\nonly 3 months or so fully to resolve the problem and to\nprovide compensation to AT&T. And that's --\nQUESTION: Okay, and if -- if there hadn't been\nan agreement, AT&T would go where? To the commission?\nMR. TARANTO: It -- it could go to the\ncommission or it could bring a Sherman Act suit unless, of\ncourse, as we do contend, there is no legitimate section\n-- section 2 claim. But as far as standing is concerned,\nthe customer, that is, AT&T, has standing.\nQUESTION: Mr. Taranto, would you clarify one\nthing for me? Did the AT&T settlement just settle the New\nYork area problems or was it nationwide?\nMR. TARANTO: The New York Public Service\nCommission settlement settled the New York problem. There\nwas an FCC national level consent decree that on a going-\nforward basis settled -- solved the problem. The problem\nwas in fact a -- a New York-specific one, and here we're\ntalking about the only concrete instance in --\nQUESTION: Well, I was under the impression AT&T\nretained the right to sue in other parts of the country.\nIn fact, they filed an amicus brief in this case, which\nsuggests that they still have an interest in the ongoing\ncontroversy, but not in New York.\nMR. TARANTO: I -- I'm -- I'm -- I don't know\nthat AT&T has signed similar agreements for the rest of\nthe country. This particular problem that gave rise to\nthis problem was fully resolved in New York with\ncompensation to AT&T and nationally at the FCC level. So\nI -- I -- AT&T certainly, wherever it hasn't adopted an\narbitration agreement, the way any other plaintiff can\nadopt, certainly has a right to go to court and to argue\nas -- as Covad has in the Eleventh Circuit case, as\nCavalier has in the Fourth Circuit case, to argue that\nthere is a Sherman Act claim, and that's the merits claim\nthat is before this Court as part of this case as well.\nQUESTION: Of course, their position is that\nthis isn't the best test case because this plaintiff\ndidn't make all the right allegations, as I read their\nbrief.\nMR. TARANTO: Well, I -- I don't think there\ncould have been any different allegations on the\ndispositive point. As long as the allegations are the\nincumbent insufficiently helped the rival --\nQUESTION: Yes, but they -- they alleged that in\nother areas, that there had been -- that there's been sham\nlitigation, fraudulent misrepresentations, and -- and\naffirmative misconduct, in addition to failing to comply\nwith all the requirements of the '96 statute.\nMR. TARANTO: And -- and those -- those claims,\nto the extent that they're not helping hand kinds of\nclaims, would of course be outside the analysis. The\nCavalier case, the Covad case are overwhelmingly, as this\ncase is, helping hand cases, as the Goldwasser case in the\nSeventh Circuit was, and that's the core issue that --\nthat all of these cases are about.\nNow --\nQUESTION: Would you get to the --\nMR. TARANTO: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- the last part? Does this customer\nof AT&T have any remedy for the bad service that the\ncustomer attributes not to AT&T but to Verizon?\nMR. TARANTO: Yes.\ncase the Second Circuit reinstated the section 202 claim\nof this plaintiff and this Court denied cert on that. So\nthat claim is alive in this very case.\nQUESTION: Are damages available on that claim?\nMR. TARANTO: The claim is -- is a claim under\nthe damages provision of section 207 for an alleged\nviolation of the substantive Communications Act provision\nin section 202.\nThey, of course, also have any remedies any\ncustomer has for lousy service here against AT&T, the\nprovider of the service, which received compensation.\nQUESTION: But you -- you say that under --\nunder 202 that there would be if -- if plaintiff prevails\non that claim against Verizon, not AT&T, there would be a\ndamage remedy for the loss that the plaintiff could prove?\nIn other words, does it give the plaintiff the same thing\nthat the plaintiff is seeking here except it's not\ntrebled?\nMR. TARANTO: The plaintiff certainly asks for\nthe same damages. Section 202 -- section 207 is the\nliability damages provision of the Communications Act.\nThe Second Circuit said that that provision was available\nto this plaintiff to seek recovery for injury from the\nalleged violation of section 202.\nQUESTION:\ncouple of times the only opportunity for the plaintiff to\nget damages is if there is this second section 2 suit?\nMR. TARANTO: I'm -- I'm afraid I can't answer\nthat question, having -- the court having reinstated that\n-- that claim. That is a damages claim.\nIf the Court has no further questions, I would\nreserve the balance of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Taranto.\nGeneral Olson, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nIt is not a Sherman Act violation to breach a\ntelephone interconnection agreement. The telephone -- the\nTelecommunications Act created an extraordinary, carefully\ncrafted, comprehensive regulatory and remedial regime to\nforce lawful monopolies --\nQUESTION: Mr. Solicitor General, before you get\ninto your argument, do you have a position on the standing\nissue?\nMR. OLSON: We did not brief and we did not take\na position in our briefing on the standing question. We\n-- and our reason for doing that, Justice Stevens, is that\nwe believe that in order to ascertain antitrust standing,\none has to connect the injury, the alleged injury, to an\nantitrust violation. We feel that the question of whether\nor not there's an antitrust violation in this case comes\nbefore the determination of the antitrust injury. And\ntherefore, the United States did not brief that question.\nWe do believe that the '96 statute is, as this\nCourt characterized it in its previous review of that\nstatute, extraordinary in that it -- it set out to create\ncompetition in an area where the antitrust laws would not\nhave accomplished that objective. The --\nQUESTION: Excuse me. I've just been thinking\nabout your prior answer, and I -- we certainly don't --\ndon't do this for standing normally. We -- we say the\nquestion of whether there's been an injury comes before\nthe question of whether there's been a violation. That's\nwhat standing is all about. And -- and you -- you say\nthat the Government has just concluded that -- that both\nquestions are -- are of equal priority, and that -- that's\njust not the way we usually work.\nMR. OLSON: We -- we felt, Justice Scalia, not\nin the context of Article III standing, but in the context\nof prudential standing in the context of antitrust\nstanding which relates specifically to something this\nCourt has called antitrust injury, which ties into the\nparticular violation, and in order to determine that here,\nwe felt that the Court would have to first answer the\nquestion whether there is an antitrust injury itself. Is\nthere any violation of the antitrust laws that would give\nrise to a section 2, Sherman Act claim in this case.\nQUESTION: But you're asking us to do that in a\ncase where a -- a plaintiff without a real interest may be\nthe one that's -- that's demanding that -- that\nadjudication. This is very odd.\nMR. OLSON: Well, we do think -- we do think --\nand had we briefed the question, we would have -- we would\nhave thought that there was -- that -- that Trinko had\nsome points here, that it -- this is not an Illinois Brick\ncase -- that Trinko was depending in part upon service\nprovided by the Verizon loop and that it had a choice, as\nthe plaintiffs -- the plaintiff -- that Trinko has alleged\nin this case, that it had a choice between deficient\nservice from AT&T or -- or paying perhaps a higher price\nor something else from Verizon, that there are\ndistinctions.\nAnd we think that they might -- but because we\ndidn't brief that, because we thought it was -- the Court\nfirst -- we have a litigant here that alleges, and we have\na Second Circuit decision, and we've got other circuit\ndecisions that have addressed this very antitrust issue --\nthat it's very important to resolve that case,\nparticularly in the context of where we have an -- a\nsignificant, extraordinary effort by Congress to create a\ncomprehensive, complex, carefully modulated effort to\ncreate something.\nQUESTION: And do you -- do you take the\nposition that that effort gives Trinko a cause of action\nunder the statute?\nMR. OLSON: That we take -- I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: Can Trinko sue -- does Trinko have a\ncause of action under the statute?\nMR. OLSON: Under -- well, yes. In fact, this\nis in answer I think to Justice Ginsburg's question.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. OLSON: There is a -- there would be -- and\nthe Second Circuit did decide that there was a right to\naction under the discrimination provisions of section 202.\nAnd this appears -- it's the -- the first full --\nQUESTION: Is --\nQUESTION: But I -- I thought Mr. Taranto said\nthis -- there is no discrimination in this case. So that\nif that's true, then there wouldn't be a remedy under 207.\nMR. OLSON: Well, first of all, to the extent\nthat there is and to the extent that there are allegations\nof that, the court addressed that and reinstated that very\ncause of action. This Court decided not to review that.\nThat --\nQUESTION: Okay, but on the -- just on the facts\npleaded, do you take -- does the United States take the\nposition that -- that Trinko has pleaded a cause of action\nunder 202 or any other section of the statute?\nMR. OLSON: We do not dispute, Justice Souter,\nthe existence of the cause of action recognized by the\nSecond Circuit on page 16a --\nQUESTION: Do you dispute that he has pleaded a\ncause of action?\nMR. OLSON: We do not.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. OLSON: With respect to that section of the\nCommunications Act.\nQUESTION: But is there any reason he can't go\nto the -- the PSC like anybody else can and say I have\nducks on the line?\nMR. OLSON: That's --\nQUESTION: I can't hear anything. It's terrible\nand then they issue an order. And if they don't follow\nthe order, you go to court and sue them for damages.\nMR. OLSON: That's also true and there's also an\naction against the -- the -- Trinko had a contract with\nAT&T to supply it with adequate telephone service. It may\nhave a cause of action against AT&T. To the extent that\nAT&T attributes its inability to provide that service to\nVerizon, AT&T has already addressed that under the\nexclusive remedies it had available to it under the\ncontract.\nQUESTION: To -- to get to -- to the merits part\nof the case, the sacrifice test that you want us to adopt\nassumes that certain acts are not pro-competitive. But in\nthis case, doesn't the telephone -- doesn't the 1996\nCommunications Act tell us that certain acts are not pro-\ncompetitive?\nMR. OLSON: Actually we submit, Justice Kennedy,\nthat what the Communications Act does is something that\nthe antitrust laws never did do. And the reason that the\nCommunications Act was in -- in fact necessary to break up\nthe monopolies, to cause legitimate, lawful monopolies to\ndo something that the antitrust laws wouldn't require,\nthat is, to open up their markets, which they had no\nobligation under the antitrust laws to do, at a subsidized\nrate to invite in competition -- that entire regulatory\nscheme was something that Congress decided was necessary\nto do which no other laws in existence had been able to\ndo.\nTherefore, not only -- and I think that this is\nclear from the Court's jurisprudence as well, but also\nwell articulated in the Town of Concord decision that was\nauthored by Justice Breyer on the First Circuit. That\nregulatory regime, which monitors the conduct on an\nongoing basis, which the antitrust laws are not well\nequipped to do, prevents the occurrence of antitrust\ninjury and inhibits the ability to accomplish antitrust\nbenefits and monitors the process in a way that succeeds\nin dealing with the possibility of anti-competitive\nconduct, but conduct that was not required at all under\nthe antitrust laws, that on opening of the markets to\nselling one's assets at a discount, to going into a\nbusiness that the lawful monopolist was not already in.\nThe additional point there is that the treble\ndamage remedy is considerably more draconian. It acts in\nan ad hoc, specific case under the supervision of\ngeneralize -- generalist judges and ad hoc juries.\nWhereas Congress decided that the scheme was most -- that\nwas most appropriate -- the regime that was most\nappropriate to create this new world that this Court\nspecifically recognized in the two previous\nTelecommunications Act cases was this regulatory regime,\ninhabited by experts, administered by experts, where there\nare prompt, efficient, effective remedies, and -- and a\nscheme which is adjustable from time to time to deal with\nany anti-competitive conduct.\nSo it's not only a reason why Congress said we\ndo not change the antitrust laws by this statute. There's\ngood reasons why Congress decided to do that. But there's\nalso additional reasons why the section 2 remedy would be\na sledge hammer in an area where Congress has enacted a\nscalpel to deal --\nQUESTION: Why -- why do we have to accept or\nbuy into your broader no-help theory of the antitrust laws\nif we -- we accept what you've just said? Why can't we\njust say in this particular instance, we don't have to\nadopt any general principles of antitrust law, but in this\nparticular instance the Communications Act has just\nsuperseded the Sherman Act?\nMR. OLSON: I agree with that, Justice Scalia --\nQUESTION: You do.\nMR. OLSON: -- that the Court does not need to\ngo into broader general principles. And this Court -- we\n-- we addressed those principles because we felt we had an\nobligation. And we have addressed -- the Government has\narticulated those same principles not only in this\nCourt --\nQUESTION: How can you say the Communications\nAct has superseded the Sherman Act when the statute itself\nsays it didn't?\nMR. OLSON:\n-- we're not saying that the -- that the act provides any\nimmunity. The act still exists side by side. What we do\nsay is that this was not -- this conduct was not a Sherman\nAct violation before the act, and the act specifically\nsays --\nQUESTION: Well, that's a different point than\nthe one Justice Scalia made. You're saying there was no\nantitrust violation whether or not there was a\nCommunications Act or not.\nMR. OLSON: That's correct, but it's\nspecifically true in the context of this regime that\nexists. To the extent that there is any anti-competitive\nactivity, this Court has repeatedly said that it must look\nfrom -- at the antitrust laws and the application of the\nantitrust laws in connection with the particular industry\nand in a particular regime in which it exists. So when\nthis Court -- this case comes to this Court, it is\nentirely consistent for this Court to look at the alleged\nviolation of the antitrust laws in that context.\nThe method that Congress selected to create --\nto --\nQUESTION: Thank you, General Olson.\nMR. OLSON: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Mr. Verrilli, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI'll address the standing question first and\nexplain why consumers in Trinko's position have standing\nand why General Olson is correct that Illinois Brick is\nnot a problem. Then I'll show why it would be unwise and\nunwarranted to adopt the discrimination test that my\nfriends on the other side advocate as a matter of section\n2 law and why the 1996 act is crucially relevant and why\nthe antitrust laws in that act should be enforced in\ntandem, as Congress indicated.\nNow --\nQUESTION: And at some point in -- in your\nstanding discussion, could you address whether or not\nTrinko could just have sued AT&T, say you're giving us\nlousy service, we want our money back?\nMR. VERRILLI: I think Trinko could have brought\na suit like that. Of course, AT&T would have then said it\nwas Verizon's fault, which it was, and there would be --\nQUESTION: That's not usually a defense, the\nfailure of the contracting party to deliver adequate\nservices under the contract.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, that -- that's correct, but\nin this situation, there -- there might well be filed rate\ndoctrine problems with a suit like that. There would be\nall kinds of a problems with a suit like that. And in any\nevent, because Trinko has -- has an is a proper plaintiff\nunder section 4 of the Clayton Act, is entitled to invoke\nthe Sherman Act, the fact that they had -- it has other\nremedies seems to me beside -- beside the crucial point.\nNow, under Reiter against Sonotone, this Court\nheld that consumers have standing under section 4 of the\nSherman Act -- under section 4 of the Clayton Act to sue\nwhen they are injured by anti-competitive conduct that\nraises prices or lowers quality in the market where they\npurchase. That is what Mr. Trinko is alleging.\nIllinois Brick is not a reason to cut off that\nstanding here, as General Olson indicated, for the\nfollowing reason. Illinois Brick applies when Hanover\nShoe applies, and Hanover Shoe does not apply here.\nIllinois Brick is just the flip side of Hanover Shoe.\nHanover Shoe says that in a case of a price-\nfixing overcharge -- the same as in UtiliCorp -- price-\nfixing overcharge -- when a middle man pays too much, the\nmiddle man is entitled to sue under the Sherman Act for\nthe entire amount of the price-fixing overcharge, and the\n-- and the defendant can't assert a pass-through defense.\nAnd -- and the reason for that is to ensure full and\neffective use and enforcement of the Sherman Act's damages\nremedy.\nNow, in that situation, what Illinois Brick\nholds is that, well, once the -- once the middle man has\nsued for the full value of the overcharge, then the people\nsubsequently down the chain can't bring antitrust claims\nthemselves because that would create a problem of\nduplicative recovery. But the -- but the reason that you\ndon't have --\nQUESTION: Or even if he hasn't sued I thought.\nMR. VERRILLI: That -- well, that's correct, but\nthere were -- because he could sue and there will be\nproblems of duplicative recovery. But that -- it only\napplies, Justice Scalia, in situations where the measure\nof damages that the middle man would have is the\novercharge damages. And here, of course, AT&T is a\ncompetitor of Verizon. AT&T would bring a monopolization\nclaim, and it's been clear since the Southern Photo case\nin 1927 that AT&T's measure of damages would be its lost\nprofits, not an overcharge, but its lost profits. And --\nQUESTION: So as long as the consumer can bring\nan action for something that AT&T couldn't bring, no\nIllinois -- no Hanover, no Illinois Brick.\nMR. VERRILLI: Correct. In fact, it would\ndisserve the very policies of Hanover Shoe here because it\nwould result in the -- the monopolist not being\nresponsible for the full value of the antitrust injury it\ninflicts. So there's no Illinois Brick problem here.\nAnd I think that's why my friends on the other\nside in Verizon relied so much on Associated General\nCounsel -- Associated General Contractors rather than\nIllinois Brick. But, of course, all that case states, as\n-- as this Court made clear in Holmes, is a rule of\nproximate cause.\nAnd remember the facts in Associated General\nContractors. The allegation was that a landowner\npressured a contractor to hire non-union subcontractors,\nand as a result the union subcontractors had less\nbusiness, and as a result, they had fewer employees, and\nas a result, the union had fewer dues to collect. And the\nCourt quite properly held that proximate causation can't\npossibly extend that far.\nQUESTION: Yes, but isn't there a proximate\ncause problem in this case too? You -- you represent a\nclass, I think. Your -- and is it not likely that the --\nthere are many, many members of the class who have\ndifferent kinds of injuries from the other members of the\nclass? It's a little hard for me to understand precisely\nhow the wrongdoing that affected AT&T necessarily carries\nover to customers of AT&T.\nMR. VERRILLI:\ntrying to monopolize the market, as the complaint alleges\n-- and I think this is clear from paragraphs 1 and 2 and\n54 of the amended complaint -- was that it was -- Verizon\nwas using its control of the local loop that competitors\nneeded to lease to get service going to degrade the\nservice that its competitors, including AT&T, were able to\nprovide to customers. That was the means by which the --\nthe antitrust scheme was effectuated, and as a result --\nQUESTION: Well, are you -- are you alleging\nthat they not merely failed to perform their duties, but\nthey actually interfered with A&T's performance of its --\nMR. VERRILLI: Correct.\nQUESTION: -- retail obligation?\nMR. VERRILLI: I think -- you know, remember --\nQUESTION: Because that's a little different\nfrom the way the court of appeals described the complaint.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, I -- I understand it, Your\nHonor, but the -- but the complaint -- one of the\ndifficulties of this case, of course, is that we're here\non a complaint and the test under rule 8 is a notice\npleading test, and it can -- and the complaint can only be\ndismissed if there is no conceivable set of facts that\ncould be proved consistent with the allegations in the\ncomplaint that would support relief. And --\nQUESTION:\nyour complaint just how it was that -- that Verizon's\nmisconduct hurt your clients.\nMR. VERRILLI: Yes, Your Honor, and I think the\n-- I think paragraph 2 of the amended complaint says that\nBell Atlantic deterred and will continue to deter\npotential customers from switching to another company for\nlocal phone service or cause customers that switch back to\nBell Atlantic in frustration for the poor services\nrendered by their local phone service provider. There are\nother places in the complaint where it's specifically\nalleged that the quality of service that AT&T customers\nget and other competitors' customers get is degraded in\ncomparison to --\nQUESTION: Under the -- what bothers me about\nthe Illinois Brick problem is -- I completely agree with\nyour characterization, but the law would seem odd that\nwould say when Smith, a price-fixing ring, charges Jones\n$3 extra, we don't let Jones' customers sue for the actual\novercharge he undoubtedly suffered. But in fact, when\nSmith, the monopolist, drives Jones through predatory\npricing out of the market, we let Jones' customers come in\nand say, oh, my service isn't as good, I -- I may -- I\ndon't know exactly. I might have switched. I -- I got\nbad service, et cetera. You see how much more ephemeral\nthat is, how much more uncertain it is, how much more\nvague it is? And the more precise thing we don't let them\nrecover for. The more vague thing on your theory, which\nis highly speculative, we will, on your view, let them\nrecover for.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, I think it's the right\nanswer to let them recover, and -- and it's not\nspeculative. They -- their -- the -- this conduct\ndirectly raises the cost of -- and degrades the service\nthat consumers in the market receive. And they are\nentitled under Reiter against Sonotone to sue for the\ndamages that those occur.\nAnd it -- you know, Illinois Brick -- I'm not\nhere to defend the wisdom of Illinois Brick in the context\nin which it exists, Justice Breyer, but it has been\nnarrowly confined to that context. And -- and if you\ndon't have an overcharge case, you don't have Hanover\nShoe. If you don't have Hanover Shoe, you don't have\nIllinois Brick.\nQUESTION: The other thing on -- on the -- that\nI had as a question on the merits of the complaint is I --\nI -- if this complaint had said that Verizon went to the\ncustomers who were trying to use AT&T and said, Mr.\nCustomer, we're going to wreck your service unless you buy\nfrom us, or indeed carried that out in -- through\nsurreptitious ways, but that's what he was saying. You\nbuy from us or you'll be sorry. If that's what the\ncomplaint said, you might well have a complaint. But I\ndon't see that in the complaint.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, under --\nQUESTION: Rather, what I see in the complaint\n-- and I want you to point out where it's the contrary --\nis that every claim of bad service is connected through a\nbecause or some other word like that to the refusal of\nVerizon to hook up AT&T, i.e., to provide them with the\nVerizon service so they can provide service to the\ncustomer.\nNow, I've read the complaint a few times, but I\nwant you to point out to me the part that you think most\nclearly contradicts what I just said.\nMR. VERRILLI: First, paragraph 2, which is at\npage --\nQUESTION: 2 is the overview.\nMR. VERRILLI: Yes, but what it says, Justice\nBreyer, is that they degraded service. Well, the -- the\ndegraded service has to occur not only during the -- the\nprocess of switching over, but after the switching over,\nand of course, under Swierkiewicz and under Leatherman,\nthe test here is whether there's any set of facts that\ncould be proved consistent with these notice pleading\nallegations that would support a cause of action. And I\nthink Your Honor's question proves that there is, the\nfirst set of facts that Your Honor described. So --\nQUESTION: Well, I'm not with you completely for\nthe reason that the overview seems to be an overview which\nis explicated by the specific complaints of exclusionary\nconduct which appear later in the complaint.\nMR. VERRILLI: But I think those complaints are\nfairly construed to -- to include denial --\nQUESTION: And I would like you to point out.\nMR. VERRILLI: I think it's true about paragraph\n52. I think it's true about paragraph 54. I think that\nthat is the essence of the complaint here. And of course,\nthat makes sense because these are exactly the kinds of\nallegations -- this is -- this is the way monopolization\noccurs. This is the way maintaining monopoly power occurs\nin this -- in this arena. There's a long and unfortunate\nhistory that goes back to MCI against AT&T and\ncontinuing --\nQUESTION: All right.\nMR. VERRILLI: -- to this present day.\nQUESTION: Then with paragraph 54, which I\nthought was the heart of the complaint, what it seems to\nsay at the end is when they did these bad things, the\nplain effect was that AT&T was prevented from offering\nlocal phone service of the quality, as was offered by\nBell, and thereby to impede the ability of AT&T to\ncompete. And so I took 54 as being essentially a\ncomplaint that AT&T is kept out of the market.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, what it -- what it says --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. VERRILLI: I -- I don't --\nQUESTION: If you don't, in other words, have an\nobligation to bring them into the market --\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, I think you do.\nQUESTION: -- under the antitrust laws, you\nlose.\nMR. VERRILLI: I think -- well, I think you do\nhave an obligation under the antitrust laws, and I'll try\nto get to that as fast as I can.\nQUESTION: If you don't --\nMR. VERRILLI: But --\nQUESTION: If you don't, do you lose?\nMR. VERRILLI: No, because this says --\nQUESTION: Where -- where are you reading from,\nMr. Verrilli?\nMR. VERRILLI: I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.\nIt's at page 46 of the joint appendix, paragraph 54 of the\namended complaint.\nWhat it alleges is that AT&T and other\ncompetitors weren't able to provide service at the -- at\nthe level of quality -- provide service at the level of\nquality that -- that Verizon could. It doesn't only say\nthat they weren't able to provide service at all. It says\nboth of those things. And so I think the allegation is\nthere in 54, and I think the -- and it's described in the\n-- the overview, 1 and 2. And paragraphs 1 and 2 of the\namended complaint explains how it works.\nAnd I'd like to -- if I could, go to -- to the\ncore antitrust issue here. I think it is common ground\nwith my friends on the other side that a monopolist's\nright to refuse to deal with competitors is not an\nunqualified right. They acknowledge one qualification.\nThat's where the monopolist discriminates. They argue\nthat's the only time a section 2 duty ought to be imposed\nbecause that -- in that situation you can be confident\nthat it's anti-competitive conduct, and you won't have\nproblems with dampening incentives and you won't have\nadministrability problems because you can refer back to\nthe prior course of dealing.\nBut where they're wrong is in suggesting that\nthat's the only time that you can find liability under\nsection 2 for monopolist refusal to cooperate with its\nrivals. It is equally true in this case, in this\nsituation where, as Justice Kennedy, your question earlier\nindicated, there is a regulatory regime in place that\nrequires competitive access on the part of the monopolist\nin order to bring competition into the market. And what\nyou have -- and -- and I think these allegations are\nconsistent that -- what I am about to say is consistent\nwith the allegations in the complaint, and what you have\nis a course of conduct on the part of the monopolist that\nis intended to subvert the competitive entry that those\nregulations require.\nQUESTION: Well, you -- you say then that the\n1996 act gives you affirmative momentum that you wouldn't\nhave with -- that you wouldn't have if it were just the\nantitrust laws?\nMR. VERRILLI: I wouldn't put it quite that way,\nYour Honor, but I -- and I will answer Your -- Your\nHonor's question directly. The -- the test, under the\nSherman Act, for exclusionary conduct applies in the same\nway that -- it's the exact same test whether the '96 act\nis there or not. The test is whether the conduct impairs\nrivals' opportunities to compete in the market and whether\nthe -- the conduct does or does not further -- by the\nmonopolist further competition on the merits.\nThat test would apply to a different factual\nscenario after the 1996 act was passed than before. And\nit's clear that that must be the case.\nFor example, Your Honor, one thing that the 1996\nact did -- this is section 253 of the act, which I think\nis at page 90 of the appendix to the petition -- it\neliminated, preempted State monopoly franchises. Now,\nprior to passage of the 1996 act, if -- if Trinko went to\nsue -- bring a section 2 claim against a local telephone\nprovider in a State where -- where there was a monopoly\nfranchise law, Trinko would be out of court on the State\naction doctrine. There would be an ironclad defense.\nWell, section 253 of the act preempted the defense.\nSo obviously in that situation, there is an\nantitrust claim that wasn't there before, and so it can't\nbe the case that what -- that -- that the passage of the\n1996 act has no relevance whatsoever to the application of\nsection 2 of the Sherman Act. And indeed, we think it\nwould impermissibly -- it would violate the savings clause\nand impermissibly modify the applicability of the\nantitrust laws to conclude that the 1996 act is the sole\nremedy here for a person in Trinko's position.\nQUESTION: Well, you're modifying it either way,\naren't you? I mean, you're modifying it if you say sole\nremedy. You're modifying it if -- if it gives, in the\nChief Justice's words, momentum.\nMR. VERRILLI: I don't think so.\nQUESTION: It's modification either way.\nMR. VERRILLI:\nbecause the -- the statute says that nothing shall modify\nthe -- modify, impair, or supersede the applicability of\nthe antitrust laws.\nQUESTION: And the momentum theory, in effect,\nsays the applicability is being modified because there's a\ndeclaration of certain anti-competitive conduct.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, I don't -- I don't think\nso. I think it -- the exact same test applies before the\nact was enacted and after, so it doesn't -- it doesn't\nmodify the substantive antitrust rule one iota. What it\nchanges is the facts to which the rule applies. Now, in\nthis case it would not be true --\nQUESTION: But I thought you were invoking the\nact for the characterization of those facts as anti-\ncompetitive.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, yes, in the following\nsense, Justice Souter. But I don't think it constitutes a\nmodification of the applicability of the antitrust laws.\nIt might change the result under the antitrust laws, but\nnot modify the applicability because the general rule\nunder the antitrust laws is that one takes the regulatory\ncontext into account, and the fact that conduct violates\nextrinsic norms, and in particular, when it violates, as\nit did in MCI v. AT&T and in the Litton Systems case and\nthe court -- cases in the court of appeals, when it\nviolates extrinsic norms that are designed to promote\ncompetition, that counts against the --\nQUESTION: Are -- are you saying that the\nTelecommunications Act imposes new duties and the\nviolation of those duties now becomes an antitrust\nviolation?\nMR. VERRILLI: No. That's --\nQUESTION: You want to talk about the -- about\n-- about the facts of -- of the -- of the market. I\nunderstand that.\nMR. VERRILLI: They -- I --\nQUESTION: But it seemed to me the thrust of\nJustice Souter's question as well was that the\nTelecommunications Act imposes new duties, and violation\nof those new duties is -- is really the gravamen of your\ncomplaint.\nMR. VERRILLI: I don't think that -- I don't\nthink that's quite right, Justice Kennedy, and let me try\nto explain why.\nThe test is whether the monopolist's conduct\nprevents competition, obstructs competition, whether it\ndoes so on a basis other than competition on the merits,\nand whether it is -- there's otherwise a legitimate\nbusiness justification. That's the general rule, as the\nUnited States acknowledges at page 14 of its complaint.\nThat's the rule that was applied in Aspen, the rule that\nwas applied in Kodak. That's the rule.\nThat rule applies here. When one answers the\nfirst part of that test that -- which is does the\nmonopolist's conduct obstruct competition, the -- the --\nit's not the case that any violation of the 1996 act would\nobstruct competition. What has to be shown there is that\nthe monopolist's conduct is sufficiently grave,\nsufficiently serious, sufficiently sustained that it --\nthat it amounts to an overall pattern that obstructs\ncompetition. So it's not the case that there is a -- that\n-- that there's a -- an automatic transference of a -- of\na duty under the 1996 act into an antitrust duty.\nBut where the -- where the 1996 act becomes\nrelevant is when you get to the next stage of the inquiry.\nAnd I think -- and it's just what Your Honor said earlier.\nAt that stage in the inquiry, it is -- the monopolist does\nnot have open to it the argument that this is pro-\ncompetitive behavior and that I have a legitimate business\njustification for it because in that circumstance, it is\nunlawful to do it. And so it can't be a legitimate\nbusiness justification to say I don't want to do something\nthat the law compels me to do because I'll be better off\nas a competitive matter if I don't do it. So it does\nenter the analysis.\nBut it doesn't transform or change in any way the\nantitrust standard.\nBut it -- it does have this -- this additional\neffect --\nQUESTION: Or does it say we define pro-\ncompetitive in a -- in a new way based on the\nTelecommunications Act? The Telecommunications Act is\npro-competitive.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, I think -- I think it does\nsay that this is conduct that it -- that it -- I think you\ncan no longer say that it is -- that it is consistent with\ncompetition on the merits for a monopolist to refuse to\ncooperate when a law designed to promote competition\ninsists on the cooperation. So I think in that way, I\nagree with Your Honor, that's what's happening here.\nAnd then the other thing that's critical is\nthat --\nQUESTION: What is cooperation? I mean, the --\nthe main obstacle in my mind to your argument is that if\nwe accept your argument, it will be a violation of the\nantitrust law not to agree to interconnect with the new\ncompetitor coming in. Immediately it will be a question\nof was that refusal reasonable or not. What were the\nterms? What were the pricing? What was the lease\narrangement, et cetera?\nwhether it's justified or not justified under the law\nwithout going into those details. You and I both know\nthat there have been opinions written in this Court that\njust skim the surface of the complexity of answering that\nkind of question.\nAnd the main obstacle to your argument in my\nmind is it seems to be a question of whether that\nincredibly complex question will be answered by a\nregulatory agency in a regulatory proceeding brought by\ncomplainants or by 500 judges and juries in antitrust\ncases throughout the country, each potentially reaching a\ndifferent answer.\nMR. VERRILLI: I -- I disagree with that, Your\nHonor, and the reason why is this. Because I think that\nquestion -- if I may say so, I think it picks up on what I\nbelieve to be a false choice that my friends on the other\nside are presenting, and that's a choice between, on the\none hand, a -- a duty to deal relegated solely to the\ncircumstance of discrimination and, on the other hand, a\nwholly unqualified duty to deal that -- that might raise a\nlot of the problems that Your Honor has identified.\nBut there's a middle ground here, and it's the\nmiddle ground that I -- that I submit to Your Honor that\n-- that Professor Areeda identified in a 1989 article and\nthat makes a world of sense.\nregulatory regime in place that supplies the background\nnorms, then the juries don't answer those questions. The\njuries decide something very different. What the juries\nwill decide in that set of circumstances is whether the\nregulatory requirements have been violated or not, and\nthey'll also -- and -- and remember, many of these\nregulatory requirements are contractual terms.\nQUESTION: And many of those regulatory\nrequirements consist of something called TELRIC blank\nslate, which happened to cover, you know, an unbelievable\nnumber of pages and I'm sure would come into the argument\nabout whether the pricing condition is or is not a\nreasonable one.\nMR. VERRILLI: I don't -- I don't think that's\nright, Your Honor. I -- I think it is -- it's an obvious\ndefense in a case like this for -- for an incumbent to\nsay, well, I'm -- I'm in compliance with the law and I'm\nin compliance with my contractual obligations. I think\nit's also a defense for an incumbent, as it was in the MCI\nv. --\nQUESTION: But does that go to the jury then?\nWell, I mean, so you say it's -- it's a -- a defense, but\nit's always going to be argued, no, you're in compliance;\nyes, I am in compliance.\nMR. VERRILLI: Yes.\nif it can't be resolved on summary judgment -- of course,\nMatsushita says that summary judgment has a particularly\nimportant role to play in antitrust cases, but if it\ncan't, then -- then it will go to the jury.\nBut that's really not any different --\nQUESTION: Well, but then you have the jury\ndetermining whether -- whether TELRIC pricing is -- has\nbeen properly applied or not. Don't you --\nMR. VERRILLI: No, I don't think you do because\nthe way this is going to -- what we're talking about here,\nYour Honor, is -- is something very different. There\nmight be a contractual provision, for example, that says\nyou've got to cut over the loops from your own switching\nsystem to our switching system within an average of 6\ndays. Now, if a plaintiff were able to come into court\nand show, well, you know, the contract says 6 days, but\nactually it's taken them 6 months and as a result, we're\nbeing disabled, that's not anything different than what --\nwhat an antitrust court and what an antitrust jury is\nasked to decide in any case. These antitrust cases are\ncomplex. There's no getting around that. They -- but --\nbut they go to a jury if there's a dispute of fact.\nThere's no getting around that either. And this is no\ndifferent from any other one in those respects.\nQUESTION:\nrelates not to the refusal to interconnect, but to the\nfailure to provide adequate service after interconnection\npursuant to a contract.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, I'm sorry, Your Honor. I\n-- I think there would be -- I think there would be claims\nof both kinds possible certainly under the antitrust laws.\nQUESTION: Well, let's suppose it's a refusal to\ninterconnect.\nMR. VERRILLI: But the --\nQUESTION: The refusal to enter into a contract.\nMR. VERRILLI: That's also governed by the same\nset of regulatory norms, and it takes away -- it --\nQUESTION: But in that case at least you'd have\nto put to the jury the question of whether the refusal to\nenter into this contract was an unreasonable one, which\nwould depend on these very subtle pricing determinations.\nMR. VERRILLI: I -- well, I think there might be\nsome circumstances, Your Honor, in which it will be a\nharder case to make, and that might be a case where a\njudge could appropriately say, it's too complicated, it\ncan't go to the jury, or might appropriately say, this is\na matter for primary jurisdiction. But it is not a black\nand white situation in which the -- the right answer here\nis to cut off an antitrust remedy that Congress clearly\nenvisioned when it enacted that savings clause. Congress\nenacted the savings clause to make clear that antitrust\nwas to operate in conjunction with the regulatory regimes\nhere, and with all due respect --\nQUESTION: Mr. Verrilli?\nQUESTION: Yes, but this is in some ways a sort\nof derivative cause of action that Trinko brings with --\nwith the primary injured party probably being AT&T. And\nso it is a concern when you address it in this context,\nisn't it?\nMR. VERRILLI: I think that it is a concern, but\nit is not a concern that defeats standing for the reasons\nI gave earlier, and it is a concern that can be overcome\nthrough the normal processes of discovery under the\nFederal rules.\nAnd -- and with respect to the -- to the\nsubstantive antitrust claim that's before the Court -- and\nin fact, the existence of the regulatory regime solves the\nproblems. It sets the benchmarks. It functions as a\nbenchmark in just the same way that a prior course of\ndealing would function as a benchmark in a discrimination\ncase, and --\nQUESTION: Mr. Verrilli, in attempting to\ndetermine whether these two pieces of legislation operate\non separate tracks, Telecommunications Act, section 2,\nJudge Wood said one of the problems with reading the\nTelecommunications Act effectively into section 2 is that\nit then -- then section 2 of the Sherman Act might eclipse\nthis elaborate regime that Congress set up because why\nwould any player want to use that mechanism instead of\ncoming into court with the possibility of getting treble\ndamages.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, I -- I think the answer is,\nYour Honor, because in -- in the absence of an effort by a\n-- an entity, a competitor, to use the mechanisms that the\nact put in place, then that -- in that situation, the\nentity doesn't have an antitrust claim where they could\nshow exclusionary conduct based on subversion on the\nregulatory requirements and lack of a legitimate business\njustification based on refusal to abide by the regulatory\nrequirements because they haven't invoked the regulatory\nrequirements.\nQUESTION: But after because -- because\ncertainly AT&T could go back to the regulator and say --\nMR. VERRILLI: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that's\nright, but that's a far -- but -- but I think that's a far\ndifferent situation from the one that Judge Wood\ndescribed. And I think it's important, critically\nimportant, here to understand where the regulators are on\nthat very question. The regulators don't think there's\ninterference if there's mutual enforcement. It's notable\nthat the Federal Communications Commission is not on the\nbrief for the United States and the Federal Trade\nCommission today and that's because their position, which\nis articulated in orders which we cite in the footnote\npage 38 of our brief, is that the duties that they impose,\nthe -- the access duties and specific obligations, ought\nto be enforced under the antitrust laws as well as under\nthe -- as well as under the Telecommunications Act and\nthat -- and that -- you know, the lessons of history are\nbehind that and the lessons of common sense are behind\nthat.\nThe fact is that the regulatory regime that the\nFCC tried to put in place to bring long distance\ncompetition and to bring telephone equipment competition\nwas insufficient, standing on its own with all of those\nregulatory mechanisms, to make that competition occur.\nThat competition occurred only when vigorous antitrust\nenforcement was brought to bear in part to enforce those\nvery regulatory requirements.\nAnd that makes a great deal of common sense, of\ncourse, because the incumbents in this situation have\nevery incentive in the world for this system not to work\nbecause they want to retain as many customers as they can\nand they want to make as much money as they can, and they\nhave ample ability to do it.\nwhich they could subvert this -- this regulatory regime by\n-- with -- with using low-level, low-intensity\nobstructionist conduct that history has shown is beyond\nthe power of the regulators to -- to capture and prevent.\nAnd that is why antitrust law needs to apply\nhere. It's why the FCC says it should apply. It's why\nthe 15 States who have submitted a brief in support of our\nposition on this said it should apply because that's the\nonly way, operating in tandem, that we're going to get to\nthe competition that Congress tried to bring about. And I\nsubmit to this Court that is exactly why the savings\nclause is in the 1996 act.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you -- excuse me -- Mr.\nVerrilli.\nMr. Taranto, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD G. TARANTO\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. TARANTO: Thank you, Your Honor.\nThe words competition, obstruction of\ncompetition, pro-competitive mask a fundamental\ndistinction between the 1996 act and the Sherman Act. The\n'96 act creates competition. Section 2 of the Sherman Act\nhas always gone no further than protecting independently-\ndeveloped competition.\nregime for policing the thousand ways, as Mr. Verrilli\nsaid, in which the obligations to create competition might\nbe violated.\nThis complaint, if you look at the two\nparagraphs that Mr. Verrilli cited, paragraph 2 and\nparagraph 54, are all -- is all about helping to create\ncompetition. Paragraph 2 says the conduct we complain of\nis that Verizon was making it difficult to obtain full use\nof Verizon's local loops. There is no allegation of\nobstruction of AT&T's independent efforts to create\nseller/buyer transactions on its own without help.\nWhat we ask the Court to say on the merits here\nis not that there is a rigid requirement of discrimination\nor anything else. What we ask the Court to recognize is\nthat up till now -- till now -- helping hand cases have\nbeen limited by the requirement of discrimination between\ncustomers, not between self and others, but between\ncustomers, and there are compellingly strong reasons not\nto expand section 2 beyond that. For institutional\nreasons, the antitrust courts are not capable of reliably\nmaking the necessary determinations and for fundamental\nincentive reasons, the incentives of incumbents to invest,\nthe incentives of rivals to invest rather than piggy-back.\nIn this context, a common law-like context,\nthere's no question of overriding preexisting, settled\nantitrust obligations. The question is should the Court\ncreate something new. And in a common law-like area, the\nexistence of another regime is one strong reason not to\ncreate something new. The Court said so in the Black &\nDecker case only last term involving the common law of\nERISA obligations when the Court said the scope of\npermissible judicial innovation is narrower where other\nFederal actors are engaged. That's what we ask the Court\nto decide, that the 1996 act is one compellingly good\nreason not to create new section 2 law here.\nThank you. If the Court has no further --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nTaranto.\n"
