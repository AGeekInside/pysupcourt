        "content": "(10:59 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in No. 03-724, Hoffman-LaRoche v. Empagran S.A.\nMr. Shapiro.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. SHAPIRO: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe United States, joined by seven other\nnations, has concluded that the decision in this case is\nan error and should be reversed. The reason is that the\nplaintiffs here are foreign claimants which allege that\nthey paid too much for vitamins outside of U.S. commerce.\nTrying these claims in our courts would conflict with the\nprinciple that the Sherman Act does not regulate the\ncompetitive conditions of other nations' economies, and\nstretching the antitrust laws to include such claims is a\nrecipe for international discord and for heavy new burdens\non our Federal district courts.\nNow, when Congress passed the FTAIA in 1982, it\ndid not expand the domain of the antitrust laws, but\nrather clarified limitations. It required both an effect\non U.S. commerce and the claim arising from that same\neffect. As the Government explains, this is language that\nrefers most naturally to a claim of the plaintiff before\nthe court, and not a claim of some other person. The\ncourt of appeals, of course, believed that it was enough\nfor somebody else to have a claim arising from a U.S.\neffect.\nQUESTION: Did -- did the court of appeals\nexplain how that issue would be litigated or decided\nwhether someone else had a claim?\nMR. SHAPIRO: It really had -- had no explanation\nof that, Your Honor, and it's quite an extraordinary\nassumption that you would inquire into the bona fides of\nsome unknown person whether they have a claim or not, and\nindeed, there is a case pending before this Court, the\nSniado case, where the litigants have no idea whether\nthere's another person who has such a claim in the United\nStates, and yet discovery has to take place on that -\nthat issue.\nQUESTION: The -- the respondent says in -- in\nits brief without much detail, just makes the allegation,\nwell, it's the single market, this is the nation, this is\na global market, so there's nothing you can do. It -- it\ndoes seem to me that there would be difficulties in -- in\ndefining what is the foreign commerce affecting the United\nStates and what is foreign commerce that does not. How is\nthis resolved in your -- best resolved in your view?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, in our opinion, the\ncharacterization of the market and the scope of the\nconspiracy is irrelevant to the reach of the antitrust\nlaws. Their -- their domain is defined in terms of the\ncommerce of the United States. Both the Sherman Act\nexplicitly says commerce within the United States, among\nour states, and with foreign nations. The FTAIA refers to\nour commerce too. There was no indication that Congress\nwas attempting to regulate commerce in other nations or\nbetween other nations with this extraordinary remedy of\ntreble damages.\nQUESTION: I -- I guess my point is, is it -- is\nit all that clear in the real world that these are\ndiscrete concepts?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes, Congress had in mind that -\nthat this would be a bright line test whether or not our\ncommerce was injured, defined as commerce that's domestic\nor import or export, and it distinguished that from wholly\nforeign transactions, wholly foreign commerce, and it\nwanted to draw that line so that these cases would be\nallocated to the correct judicial system in the world\ncommunity and they would not all be -\nQUESTION: The -- the claim here is that because\nof the -- because of the worldwide nature of the market,\nour foreign commerce is necessarily injured, because the\nmarket being worldwide, if a lower charge had been\nassessed in the United States, which would have been the\ncase absent the alleged violations of the antitrust laws,\nthere would have been arbitrage, and we would have\nexported some of these drugs abroad by reason of the fact\nthat they had been purchased at lower prices in the United\nStates. Why -- why doesn't that make out an injury to\nforeign commerce?\nMR. SHAPIRO: It -- it makes out an injury to\nwholly foreign commerce. The overcharge took place in\nAustralia, Ecuador, Panama, and the Ukraine, and it isn't\nenough to say there's some interrelationship among these\nprices. The Fifth Circuit correctly rejected that claim\nas a matter of law.\nQUESTION: No, but there -- there was an\novercharge in the United States. You're -- you're not -\nMR. SHAPIRO: Right.\nQUESTION: -- contesting that -- that -\nMR. SHAPIRO: At all -\nQUESTION: -- that the conspiracy included the\nUnited States?\nMR. SHAPIRO: All of the people who were\novercharged in the United States have been compensated in\nthe settlement and our fines here have been geared to the\novercharge -\nQUESTION: Yes, but I'm talking about the effect\non foreign commerce. If there had not been the overcharge\nin the United States, if realistic market-based prices had\nbeen charged in the United States, we would have re\nexported a lot of these drugs to foreign countries that\nwere still being overcharged, wouldn't we?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, Your Honor, if -- if the\nFTAIA was interpreted to permit that argument, the\nconsequences, all of the foreign claimants could come to\nour courts, our courts would be flooded, other nations\nwould be antagonized, because they believe that they\nshould be able to apply their law to those foreign\ntransactions. It isn't enough to speculate about\nrelationships among prices in these two systems, because\nthe statute requires a line to be drawn between effect in\nthe United States -\nQUESTION: Mr. Shapiro, can I ask you a question\n-\nMR. SHAPIRO: -- and effects, purely foreign\ncommerce.\nQUESTION: -- about your theory, about your\ntheory? What if the plaintiff is engaged in business in\nboth the United States and in a foreign market and suffers\ninjuries in both? May he recover for both injuries or\nonly the injury in the United States in your view?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Only for injury in the United\nStates, and the House report talks about that, companies\nthat are involved in jurisdictions -\nQUESTION: And it -- would that have been the\ncase before this statute was passed, do you think?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes, I -- I do, because the -- the\nClayton Act limits the private treble damage action to\ninjuries stemming from a restraint on U.S. commerce,\ncommerce among the states, and with foreign nations, not\ncommerce that is wholly in foreign nations or between\nforeign nations. The injury has to flow from that which\nmakes the conduct illegal, which is the U.S. restraint.\nQUESTION: No. The injury in the -- under the\nstatutory language, they has to -- the plaintiff has to\nsuffer an injury to his business or property, but you say\nthat does not include the business or property that's\nconducted abroad?\nMR. SHAPIRO: That's correct, because if -- if\nthe -- if the United States claimant has participated\noverseas in purely foreign commerce, Congress expected\nthat that plaintiff would invoke the laws of the other\nnation. To the extent that it participated in U.S.\ncommerce, Congress expected that the plaintiff would come\nto our courts. It was a division of judicial labors among\nthe sovereign nations to try to encourage other nations to\nadopt their own antitrust laws and to avoid the kind of\nantagonism that we see with these amicus briefs from other\ncountries.\nQUESTION: Do you think that -- do you think\nmaintaining that position is necessary for you to prevail\nin this case?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well -- well, of course not, Your\nHonor, because the plaintiffs here -- we're talking about\nthe Winddridge Pig Farm in -- in -- as one of the\nplaintiffs in Australia that's claiming it paid too much\nfor vitamins in Australia, and the other countries wonder\nwhy -- why are they complaining about the price of\nvitamins in the United States court? It's a purely\nforeign transaction -\nQUESTION: Suppose they -- suppose these foreign\nbuyers had alleged, well, they heard that the United\nStates is a good place to buy things and they tried to buy\nthe vitamins in the United States and found the same\nrigged prices?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, Your Honor, first, the\ncomplaint does not allege any attempt to deal in the\nUnited States.\nQUESTION: I'm asking you if that would do under\nyour theory. They said, we really wanted to make these\npurchases in the United States.\nMR. SHAPIRO: There -- there is one case that I\nwould refer Your Honor to. It's the Amex v. Montreal\nTrading case, 1981 decision from the Tenth Circuit that\nsays it's not enough to say we might have done something\ndifferent, we could have done something different, we wish\nwe had done something different. There has to be a\ntrading pattern.\nQUESTION: Suppose they show that they in fact\nattempted to buy drugs here and they found -- vitamins\nhere -- and they found that the price was the same.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, the Tenth Circuit held that\nthere had to be an interrupted course of trading before a\nplaintiff could make that allegation, and that's very\nsimilar to what this Court held in Holmes v. SIPC -\nQUESTION: Mr. Shapiro, I -\nMR. SHAPIRO: -- that you have to have an actual\ntransaction that's been interrupted.\nQUESTION: I would think your defense against\nthat is -- is -- is not to assert that there's no effect\non -- on foreign commerce, on our exports, because I think\n-- I think there is. I -- I would -- I would think your\ndefense is -- is in -- in Section 2 of the Foreign Trade\nAntitrust Improvements Act, which requires that this\neffect on commerce, on export commerce, gives rise to a\nclaim under the provisions of Sections 1 to 7, and -- and\nthe only way it gives rise to a claim on the part of these\npeople is a claim as second purchasers, and Illinois Brick\nwould have excluded their claim, I assume, if they are re\nbuying from the -- the -- from people in the United\nStates. Wouldn't that be the case?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, yes, we do rely on the second\nprong of the FTAIA, which requires that the particular\nclaim derive from an anti-competitive effect in the U.S.\nAnd here it doesn't, it derives from an effect overseas,\nand of course, these plaintiffs don't allege that they\npurchased some export coming from the United States.\nQUESTION: No, they -- they're alleging that they\nwould have purchased from -- from Americans. That would\nhave been down the stream, it seems to me.\nMR. SHAPIRO: It certainly would be, and it would\nbe extremely speculative, and it's the sort of claim this\nCourt has always rejected under Holmes against SIPC, under\nBlue Chip Stamps, in the securities context, which has\nbeen followed in the antitrust case law. It's not enough\nto say we might have done something different. That does\nnot make them into participants in U.S. commerce, and\nCongress wanted the treble damage remedy to be available\nto protect our commerce. It expected other countries to\nadopt their own laws to deal with overcharges within their\nown territories, and other nations, of course, have done\njust that. They've passed over 100 different pieces of\nlegislation all around the world, from Albania to Zambia,\nwe see new antitrust laws that have been passed, and it\nwould discourage that process if the U.S. courts attempted\nto subsume all of these foreign overcharge disputes into\nour court system.\nQUESTION: Let's -- let's assume that -- that we\nfind the textual argument in -- in effect a -- a draw.\nOne way to go your way would be to accept a comity\nanalysis, but I take it comity was never raised.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, there is a kind of comity\nthat Justice Scalia referred to in the Hartford case that\nwe think is raised here, and that is comity bearing -\ncomity among nations, not judicial comity where the judges\nweigh various and sundry factors, but it's a rule of\ninterpretation that -- that discourages interpretations of\nlaws, where you have two interpretations that are\navailable, you pick the interpretation that is most\nconsistent with international law and which avoids\nantagonizing our allies and our trading partners. And\nthat concept is very much before the Court here, and I\nthink it argues very much in favor of the narrower\ninterpretation, particularly because Congress was\nexpecting that wholly foreign transactions, that's the\nterm used in the House report, would be litigated in\nforeign nations, and -- and our -- our allies and trading\npartners -\nQUESTION: Well, if we -- if we accept that and\ntextually the statute is a draw, we -- we wouldn't have to\nget to this interpretative principle. I mean, one reason\nfor getting to the interpretative principle that you now\nsuggest is -- is simply the submissions of -- of foreign\ncountries as well as the United States in this particular\ncase.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, yes, we -- we think the\nliteral language and the structure of the statute are\nsufficient to reverse here. But to the extent that the\nCourt's endowed, it's very appropriate to use these\ntraditional tools of interpretation that go all the way\nback to the Charming Betsy case that the Court, faced with\na choice between two readings of a statute, picks the\ninterpretation that is compatible with international law\nand which avoids antagonizing our allies.\nQUESTION: Well, how -- but how -- how do we know\nthose two factors? How do we know what's consistent with\ninternational law? How do we know what's consistent with\nnot antagonizing our allies?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, on the latter, we have amicus\nbriefs from seven of our -- our most significant trading\npartners, of allies -\nQUESTION: But surely there -- there are other\npartners who have not been heard from.\nMR. SHAPIRO: That's true, but all of the foreign\nnations that have spoken up here agree with the United\nStates that this is contrary to their ability to regulate\ncommerce in their own nations. No nation -\nQUESTION: These are nations with -- with fairly\neffective antitrust laws and antitrust enforcement.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: What about the majority of nations in\nthe world that don't have effective antitrust enforcement,\nif indeed they have any antitrust laws? Might they not be\neager to have us do the job for them?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, there are 100 nations now\nthat do have aggressive antitrust enforcement programs,\nand Congress' view in 1982 was that we should draw back in\nour attempt to police the world because we want all these\nother nations to adopt these rules. That won't happen if\nthe United States takes all of these cases into its\njurisdiction. Other nations won't go the route that they\n-- that they were encouraged to do by Congress.\nAnd I think it's also important to consider the\nburden on our judicial system that the interpretation\nadvocated by my friends would impose.\nQUESTION: Well, their argument is that these\ncases simply come together anyway, these cases will\npiggyback their way in or at least come hand in hand with\nthe domestic cases.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, Your Honor, it -- these cases\nare difficult to administer under the best of\ncircumstances, but consider global plaintiffs from 192\ncountries coming to the United States and asking a single\ndistrict court judge to decide how much they've been\novercharged, how much competition there was locally, what\ntrade barriers there were that might have prevented\ncompetition, calculate the damages for every man, woman,\nand child on the face of the Earth that perhaps is -- has\nan antitrust claim.\nQUESTION: Of course, I suppose that's the\npenalty for engaging in worldwide conspiracy.\nMR. SHAPIRO: But that penalty is imposed on our\ndistrict court judges. They would -- would be forced to\nuntangle these incredibly difficult procedural problems,\nand how are they going to give notice to people around the\nglobe in 192 languages with different dialects? How could\nwe even accomplish that and how could we make sure people\nare actually protected in this global forum that's being\nadvocated? U.S. courts are not world courts equipped to\ndo this.\nQUESTION: Could you just deny class action\ncertification if that's -- if you have that kind of\nproblem, but no -- nobody, none of these plaintiffs are\ntrying to sue on behalf of the whole world.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, the plaintiffs here are -\nare alleging a class action of all the purchasers around\nthe world outside of the United States, and every one of\nthe cases that's been filed under this theory has been a\nclass action, so that's -- that's what we're seeing. And\nof course, in -- in a broad array of future cases, not\njust price-fixing cases, but all Sherman Act cases are\nsubject to this FTAIA regime -\nQUESTION: Has any Federal court ever certified a\nclass that size, that all purchases around the globe?\nMR. SHAPIRO: I don't think the class issue has\nbeen reached in any of these cases, but they -- they are\nbeing filed. I -- I saw one just a month ago in the\ndistrict court in Connecticut. It was a suit by an Indian\ndealership alleging it had been wrongfully terminated in\nIndia. He wanted to litigate in our courts over the\npropriety of that termination, claiming that dealers in\nthe United States maybe were affected by the same thing.\nWell, there are lots of dealerships around the world in\n192 countries, and the lure of treble damages is a\npowerful lure that's going to bring them to our country if\nthese claims are accepted.\nWith the Court's permission, we would reserve\nthe balance of our time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Shapiro. Mr. Pate,\nwe'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF R. HEWITT PATE\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. PATE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nGiven the key role of deterrence, both in the\nopinion below and in the respondents' arguments here, the\nUnited States thinks it important to offer the Court an\naccurate understanding of how international cartel\nenforcement really works. It's only in the past 8 years\nthat we've begun to see dramatic success in detecting and\npunishing international cartels, and that has come about\nonly by international cooperation with other enforcement\nagencies and through the use of amnesty programs.\nThere's nothing in the FTAIA, much less any\nclear congressional statement, in a statute that after all\nwas jurisdiction-limiting in intent, that would require\njeopardizing our progress in those enforcement efforts\nthrough a dramatic extraterritorial application of U.S.\ntreble damages litigation. Even if there were,\nestablished principles of standing under Section 4 of the\nClayton Act would nonetheless preclude that result.\nQUESTION: Can you tell us how -- how it would\njeopardize your -- your efforts? Suppose we rule for the\nrespondent here, wouldn't that make foreign conspirators\nand -- and American companies all the more eager to come\nto you, because then they could get immunity both for U.S.\nactions and -- and the global effects?\nMR. PATE: The -- the important point, Justice\nKennedy, is that under these amnesty programs, there is no\namnesty given for civil liability. So it is our\nexperience that when a company finds that its employees\nhave been engaged in wrongdoing, it balances the potential\nfor freedom from criminal liability against the certainty\nthat civil treble damages will follow. And to make the\ntype of sea change in the law that's advocated by\nrespondents here to provide for unquantifiable,\npotentially unknowable worldwide liability will in our\njudgment lead to the risk that companies who discover this\ntype of conduct will instead hunker down and simply hope\nnot to be detected.\nThe -- the effect will be even more dramatic\nwith respect to the amnesty programs of some of our\ntrading partners, such as the countries who have filed\nbriefs here, because in those systems, treble damages are\nsimply unknown. So while we fear a marginal decrease in\nthe effectiveness of our program, there would be a\ndramatic impact on foreign amnesty programs -\nQUESTION: Mr. Pate, do you agree with Mr.\nShapiro's answer to my question about a plaintiff, an\nAmerican plaintiff who has business both in this country\nand abroad and suffers -- and both are hurt by the\nconspiracy?\nMR. PATE: Yes, Justice Stevens, I do, because\nunder Section 4 of the Clayton Act, the plaintiff must\nshow that his own injury is, by reason of -\nQUESTION: Well, in my hypothetical it is his\ninjury, he does business both in the United States and in\nEurope.\nMR. PATE: Exactly. But with respect to the\nforeign incurred injuries, he must show injury by reason\nof that which makes the conduct illegal, and since Alcoa\nin 1954, and certainly under Hartford, it is the effect on\nU.S. commerce that makes the conduct the concern of the\nSherman Act in the first place so that he cannot show that\nhe's been injured by reason of that which makes the\nconduct illegal.\nQUESTION: I don't follow the -\nQUESTION: I -- I thought Hartford left that\nquestion open.\nMR. PATE: Hartford -\nQUESTION: I mean, Hartford specifically\naddressed the export, but it -- it -- my recollection is,\nin the footnote, it expressly left any -- any further\neffect of the statute in open question.\nMR. PATE: That's correct, Justice Souter. The\nCourt did not address the statute. I was simply pointing\nout that in foreign commerce cases, it is the effect on\nU.S. commerce rather than the conduct itself that causes\nthat conduct to be the concern of U.S. antitrust laws.\nAbsent the effect on U.S. commerce, there would be no\napplication of the U.S. antitrust laws. That's true under\nAlcoa and true under Hartford.\nNow, with respect to the FTAIA, we think the\nmost natural reading of the statute is simply that the\nCourt look at the party bringing the claim before the\nCourt in construing section (a)(2).\nQUESTION: The FTAIA was passed in 1982, is that\nright?\nMR. PATE: That's correct, Justice Breyer.\nQUESTION: The division keeps track, I guess, but\nis there any instance, or what instances are there, I'd\nlike to write them down unless there are dozens, in which\na foreign cartel injures the United States and also\nseparately injures people abroad. What instances were\nthere in which the people in Uruguay or wherever could sue\nthe perpetrators in Holland in an American court prior to\n1982?\nMR. PATE: We're aware of no instance of such a\ncase and it -\nQUESTION: No such instance. I'll ask the other\nside the same question.\nMR. PATE: It was clear and it is accepted as a\ncommonplace that a plaintiff who did not participate in\nU.S. commerce, in trading in U.S. commerce, simply would\nnot have had the same -\nQUESTION: So you've looked it up and you can\nfind nothing in your opinion that counts as such an\ninstance?\nMR. PATE: We're aware of no such case. The\nrespondents have attempted to cite district court cases,\nbut if you look at each of those, you will find an effect\non U.S. commerce, and with respect to the Industria\nSiciliana case mentioned in their brief, you'll find that\nthat was a case that was expressly disapproved by the\nCongress when it passed the FTAIA, even if it could be\nread that way, so that under the FTAIA, we think the\nnatural reading is simply to ask the court to look at the\nclaim before it and to ask whether the U.S. effect gives\nrise to a claim on behalf of the party in court.\nWhere the United States is bringing a claim, any\ntime we can meet the direct, the effects test of Hartford\nand Alcoa, we will always have a claim that has arisen\nfrom a U.S. effect, so that there is no danger here to\nU.S. enforcement, which continues under the application of\nthe FTAIA without any burden. But as to a private\nplaintiff, the private plaintiff must show that its own\nclaim is one that has been given rise to by a U.S. effect.\nTurning to standing, we think even if the FTAIA\ndid not apply, that the proper result here would\nnonetheless be reached under the Clayton Act, not only for\nthe -- by reason of rationale that Justice Stevens\nmentioned in his question, but also because the plaintiffs\nare not within the zone of interests that are protected by\nthe antitrust laws under this Court's opinion in\nMatsushita and elsewhere, which makes clear that our\nSherman Act is not intended to set the competitive\nconditions for other nations' economies.\nAnd finally, if the Court simply were to apply\nthe remoteness or proximate cause rationale that's also\nvery prevalent in the Court's antitrust standing cases,\nwhich excludes injuries, for example, to shareholders, to\nemployees, that the case also would not be proper under a\nremoteness rationale, because these plaintiffs do not in\nfact allege that they were the victims of an overcharge in\nU.S. commerce. They do not even allege, Justice Ginsburg,\nthat they made any attempt to purchase in U.S. commerce,\nbut would rather seek to use speculative transactions that\nnever occurred to make an end run around the FTAIA by\ndefining a so-called one-world market or one big\nconspiracy theory.\nTo do that would certainly again be completely\ncontrary to this Court's holding in Matsushita, where the\nJapanese aspects of a conspiracy were sought to be put\ntogether with American aspects into one big claim. The\nCourt plainly rejected that. Indeed, if we were to\nproceed on that theory, why would not the claim here be\nequally seen to have been given rise to by effects in\nFrance, effects in Great Britain, Russia, or elsewhere.\nThere is simply no limiting principle.\nAnd as Mr. Shapiro suggests, to pursue this path\nwould embroil the district courts around the country in\nall forms of satellite litigation, and it's very important\nto recognize that this is not a test that would apply only\nto a notorious worldwide criminal conspiracy, such as was\nat issue here, but would apply to rule of reason cases,\njoint venture cases, could apply even to Section 2 cases\nunder the Sherman Act any time a plaintiff was able to\nallege that some other plaintiff somewhere suffered from a\nU.S. effect that was related to that conduct. And the\ncases that Mr. Shapiro mentioned are good indications of\nthat.\nSo in our judgment, the Court should pay\nattention to the practical realities of enforcement and\navoid doing damage to them, avoid creating friction with\nour trading partners in a situation where whatever else\ncan be said, there is no clear congressional statement\nthat the FTAIA should be read to expand jurisdiction. In\nfact, the statute cannot on its terms expand jurisdiction\nby reason of its language, which begins with a statement\nthat the antitrust laws shall not apply, and then puts the\nplaintiff back where it was prior to the FTAIA if certain\nconditions are met. In no case can the statute operate to\ngive additional causes of action or create additional\nstanding on behalf of parties who didn't have it prior to\nthe FTAIA.\nIn short, all the Court need do is evaluate\nrespondents' own claim rather than the hypothetical claims\nof others, and doing so will require dismissal. If the\nCourt has no further questions, thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Pate.\nMr. Goldstein, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nJustice Breyer, I will come to your question in\njust a moment. The petitioners are more than 20 U.S.\ncompanies and their foreign affiliates who were caught\nred-handed perpetrating the most damaging anti-competitive\nconspiracy in the history of -\nQUESTION: Mr. Goldstein, do you agree with the\nposition of your opponents that the FTAIA was a limiting\nstatute and that if there was no claim before FTAIA, that\nthere certainly is none afterwards for your case?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, but not\nbecause the FTAIA applies. We have to prove that we would\nhave had a claim before the Sherman Act, before the '82\nAct was adopted, and we intend to do so. I do know -- do,\nhowever, think that the '82 Act is illuminating because it\neliminated claims of other people and not ours, and that\nwould be the victims of a U.S. export cartel.\nNow, the reason our position is critical is the\none identified by Justice Kennedy, and that is that the\nconspirators' cartel encompassed a worldwide market for\nbulk vitamins and the worldwide market is relevant because\ngeographic boundaries don't have any meaning here. A\nconspiracy limited to U.S. commerce would have collapsed\nas U.S. purchasers bought abroad, as Justice Scalia has\nsaid, and there is a critical fact about the nature of the\nworldwide market and how the United States enforces the\nantitrust laws that has not been touched on in the first\nhalf hour, and that is that U.S. antitrust law -- and Mr.\nChief Justice, this is prior to the 1982 Act -- deems\ntheir conspiracy -- Justice Breyer, it's not the\nindividual transactions, it's the entire conspiracy -\nillegal, lock, stock, and barrel.\nThe U.S. Government in this case prosecuted the\npetitioners not for price fixing in the United States and\nnot for market allocation in the United States, but price\nfixing and market allocation in the United States and\nabroad. If the petitioners are right about what the\nSherman Act means, including after the 1982 Act, then it\nwill be the prosecutions of the United States that fall\nalong with our position.\nQUESTION: No, no, I mean, their argument I take\nit is simply, of course, there -- the quinine cartel,\nwhich I had heard of, I'd not heard, the quinine cartel\nsets in Holland and raises the price of quinine that's\nsold all over the world, and of course it violates our law\nand we're out there and they're lobbing these shells at us\nin a sense, and so of course we can bring a claim against\nthem, it hurts us. But other countries have different\nlaws, and as far as they're concerned, those laws -- what\nthey are doing in Holland is fine. And so what business\ndo we have telling Uruguay, which thinks depression\ncartels, or Japan, which thinks oppression cartels are the\ngreatest thing, and they may be, and so does Holland think\nthat. And what business do we have saying that a citizen\nof Japan who's hurt by something that the Japanese think\nis just fine and the Dutch think is just fine come to our\ncourt and enforce our law against those other countries\nwhere it doesn't affect us? That's their claim. It's a\nkind of like we're engaged in legal imperialism. If we\nthink our law is better, convince them. Don't apply our\nlaw to them against their consent.\nNow, that, I take it, is the argument, not what\nthe prosecution says. So I'd be interested in your\nresponse.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Breyer, I'm going to\nanswer it in three parts that will explain why it is that\nyou can't separate the civil and the criminal liability.\nAs you know much better than me, what's good for goose is\ngood for the gander. Section 4 of the Clayton Act says if\nit's illegal and it can be prosecuted, then there's a\ncivil right of action for it.\nSo here are my three parts. The first is the\ncase law. American Tobacco, National Lead, Timken Roller\nBearing, these are the three principal cartel cases that\nare discussed in our brief. Those cases do not say that\nthe quinine cartel was illegal insofar as it hurt us.\nIt's -\nQUESTION: It says it's illegal, period.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It's illegal, including the sales\nin Ecuador and in Holland. Justice Breyer, I -- I urge\nyou to go to the indictment in this case, which is at the\nrollover between pages 1 and 2 of our red brief. In this\ncase, the Federal Government prosecuted Mr. Shapiro's\nclients for price fixing and market allocation in the\nUnited States and abroad. That is, we don't care that\nEcuador likes price fixing. I will come to the fact that\nthey don't, but it doesn't matter. The Section 1 of the\nSherman Act reaches the conspiracy and this Court's\nprecedents reach every bit, as I said, lock, stock, and\nbarrel.\nNow, let me give you the reason why. That was\nyour question. Okay, assume -- you wanted to know why\nCongress made that choice, and it made that choice\nbecause, as Justice Scalia explained, we can't separate\nwhat happens in Ecuador from what happens in U.S.\ncommerce. It doesn't make, in terms of protecting our\nconsumers and our economy, it makes no difference at all\nwhether the sale was between Holland and Holland, New\nJersey, or instead Holland and Ecuador, because the cartel\ngets sustained, and that's also the point of Pfizer. So\nCongress recognized that and it made the cartel -\nQUESTION: Well, but Pfizer was doing business in\nthis country.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, we accept that\nas correct, but -\nQUESTION: Well, you have -- you not only accept\nit, it's a fact, so you're -\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: And it -- and we accept it.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: With good reason, I think. Mr.\nChief Justice, our point is that the rationale -- I don't\nwant to -\nQUESTION: But I -- if you're on a -- it sounds\nto me like you're a verbal point, which I'm not against.\nOf course we say it is illegal what they do in Holland.\nIt's illegal when they hurt us, it's illegal when we hurt\nthem, we think it's illegal plain and simple. I accept\nthat. But what I don't see follows from that is that we\ngive a claim for damages by a -- to person in Uruguay for\nactivity that takes place in Holland, which we think is\nillegal, but the Dutch and the Uruguayans don't. And so I\ncan't get mileage for you unless I'm wrong in thinking\nthat out of words in indictments that say American\nTobacco, what they did was illegal everywhere. I like -\nI think the antitrust laws are a marvelous policy, okay,\nso I'm tempted to say, yes, it's illegal everywhere. But\nthat isn't where I'm having the problem. I'm having the\nproblem about finding -- I -- I'd be repeating myself, so\nhave you taken it in?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nQUESTION: Okay, what's the answer?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: The answer is that the -- let me\ntake you to the text of Section 4 of the Clayton Act,\nwhich I know you know, but it can't hurt to come to it,\nand that's at the page 1a of the red brief. The Section 4\nof the Clayton Act says, any person who shall be injured\nin his business or property by reason of anything\nforbidden in the antitrust laws has the cause of action,\nand that's what Congress said.\nIt's not, Justice Breyer, merely that we say, we\nthink you shouldn't do this in Ecuador. It is, you may\nnot do it in Ecuador in order to defeat the cartel on the\nwhole.\nQUESTION: Correct. And if we had that alone,\nthat would be strong support, and the problem is we have\nanother sentence, which is the first sentence in the\nFTAIA, whatever it is, and then you get to the second.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay, but -\nQUESTION: I'm -- I'm not -- I got off the train\neven earlier. I'm not -- I'm not sure that -- that when\nan indictment describes an international conspiracy as an\ninternational conspiracy, it amounts to saying that that\nportion of the international conspiracy which does not\naffect this country in any way is illegal. I don't think\nthat -- I think you're bound in your indictment to\ndescribe the -- the actual conspiracy, and if it indeed is\none that covered the whole world, you're -- are you\nsupposed to describe it as one that only applied to the\nUnited States? Of course not. You describe the actual\nconspiracy. That does not prove that the portion of it\nwhich does not affect the United States is in any sense\nillegal under United States law. I don't think it is\nillegal.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Scalia, let me tell you\nwhy I think that is contrary to settled precedents, and\nMr. Chief Justice, these are precedents just like Rose v.\nLundy that Congress would have had in mind in the 1982\nact. So I want to talk, Justice Scalia, about pre-1982\nlaw on whether or not the Sherman Act actually made the\ntransactions, if we were to focus on them, illegal. And\nthen, Justice Breyer, I want to come to whether or not the\n'82 act changes that.\nJustice Scalia, the decree in National Lead\naffirmed by this Court, which is at pages 330 to 331 of\nthe Court's opinion, cancelled contracts that were in\npurely foreign commerce. To read from the opinion that\n- that established the decree, several agreements relating\nto manufacture and trade, we deem the European markets are\nbut some of the links in the chain which was designed to\nenthrall the entire commerce in titanium. Timken Roller\nBearing did the exact same thing, and the Solicitor\nGeneral argued in Timken that acts would have -- that\nthose acts would have violated the Sherman Act even if\nthey had related solely to the commerce of the foreign\nnations.\nThose precedents, Justice Scalia, if you look at\nthem, do say that the underlying activities that are in\nthe overt acts, if you will, in furtherance of the\nconspiracy, are illegal under U.S. law, and that's for a\ngood reason. That is, if we don't go after them, the\nconspiracy itself will be sustained. You have to attack\nthe conspiracy and what the conspirators are actually\ndoing.\nQUESTION: But all of that is true and it does\nnot necessarily follow that we do or should permit a cause\nof action.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Absolutely, Justice Souter. I\nhave to take this -- there are -- there are three parts to\nthe equation, and let me just, at each stage, because it\ncan get very complicated, talk about where we are in the\nlogic. There is the question, does the Sherman Act apply?\nThere is the second question, okay, is there a private\nright of action? And, Justice Souter, you identified the\nthird part to it. What does comity have to say about it?\nWhat do we do, assuming even if nominally the statute\napplies and they can sue, but it nonetheless would bring\nus into conflict with our trading partners.\nSo I was answering, Justice Scalia, on the\nfirst. Justice Breyer and you have taken me to the\nsecond, and that is, is there a private right of action,\nparticularly after the 1982 Act? Two facts about the 1982\nAct. First, it has nothing to do with this case. Its\npurpose, and it's reflected in the introductory clause,\nand let me take you to -\nQUESTION: You're -- you're talking about FTAIA?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: Well, but the court of appeals relied\nvery heavily on the act.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It did in the sense of saying -\nQUESTION: Well, it just did. I mean, not did\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It did in a particular sense,\nyes. I'm not trying to quibble. It said that the -\nQUESTION: Good to know.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It said that the FTAIA, the '82\nAct didn't bar our claim. We think that's right for two\nreasons, the first it doesn't apply at all, and the second\nis that clause 2, which is what gave rise to the split in\nthe circuits, doesn't require that the person's injury,\nthat the person's injury arise from an effect on U.S.\ncommerce. It accepted the second of those propositions,\nand so I'll start with it, and Mr. Chief Justice, the text\nis at page 1a of the red brief. I think it's helpful to\ngo there.\nThis is a limit, by the way, of course, on both\nprivate rights of actions and the actions by the\nGovernment, and so what happens to us is going to happen\nto Federal prosecutors. It says, it's the second statute\nlisted, Sections 1 to 7 of this title, that is the Sherman\nAct, shall not apply to conduct. It's focusing there on\nthe conspiracy, all agree here that the conduct covered by\nthe FTAIA is the illegal conspiracy. So conduct involving\ntrade or commerce other than import trade or import\ncommerce with foreign national unless two conditions are\nsatisfied. The one is the substantial effect on U.S.\ncommerce, and they admit they sold billions of dollars of\nvitamins in the United States as part of the worldwide\nmarket. And second, such effect -- and so the effect here\nis the effect of the conspiracy on U.S. commerce -- gives\nrise to a claim under provision -- under the provisions of\nSections 1 to 7 of this title, i.e, under the Sherman Act.\nWhat that statute does is determines whether the\nconspiracy itself falls within the Sherman Act. It is not\n-- and as its structure indicates, it's not about whether\na particular individual's claim comes within it. Remember\nthe structure is, this conduct, the conspiracy, is illegal\nor not depending on whether or not these two criteria are\nmet. Now, this is -- our reading of it is the one that\nwas adopted by the United States when the act was adopted,\nby every single antitrust treatise, every single article\ninterpreting the FTAIA at the time. They all recognized\nthat what clause 2 does is requires that the effect\nrequired by clause 1, that is, the effect on U.S.\ncommerce, be an anti-competitive effect.\nQUESTION: But the -- I -- the court of appeals,\nI thought, said the language, give rise to a claim, meant\nthat you didn't have to show the claim of any particular\nperson. Do -- do you agree with the court of appeals\nthere?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: We do, Mr. Chief Justice, in its\nbottom line. You asked a question in the first minute,\nhow in the world are we going to tell if some other person\nhas a claim, and that -- we agree with you, that is not\nwhat Congress had in mind. As between the two sort of\nreticulated versions of clause 2, the Second Circuit is\nthe -- is the reading of the statute. It comes out the\nexact same way, but it's the analysis of the Second\nCircuit that's right.\nThe Second Circuit said, before the 1982 Act was\nadopted there was a split. We didn't know if in order to\ntrigger the Sherman Act, the effect that was required on\nU.S. commerce had to be pro-competitive or anti\ncompetitive. There was a rule of the Second Circuit in a\ncase called National Bank of Canada that says, look, it's\nnot good enough to bring in the Sherman Act if there's an\nincrease in exports or more jobs. No, no, no, no, no. It\nhas to be anti-competitive here.\nAnd so that -- the ABA submitted comments on the\noriginal version of the 1982 bill, and it said, look, in\norder for the Sherman Act to apply, there's got to be a\nproblem in our country, and so they added clause 2, and\nthat's, as I said, the United States said so in 1982, in\n1983, every treatise did, every antitrust commentator. So\nthat's what clause 2 does. It says, look, we are\nconcerned when our economy is being hurt, and that's a\nlimit on us, and in the antitrust guidelines, the\nGovernment says that's a limit on them too.\nQUESTION: I -- I just want -- don't want you to\nlose part 3, and let -- let you focus on that, the comity.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nQUESTION: One possibility floating through my\nmind is that there are international quinine or maybe\nthis, international vitamin cartels, where it's pure price\nfixing, and in such instances, prices in one country may\nbe interdependent on another, and in such instances if you\nlose this case here, now, you may still have a claim,\nbecause it flows in part, the injury, from effects in the\nUnited States. But there are many other parts of the\nantitrust law which are highly controversial. To name a\nfew, information sharing, vertical restrictions of\ndifferent kinds.\nAnd if you win here, not only do you not have to\nshow this interdependent thing, but anybody could come in\nunder all those under provisions too, which many other\ncountries don't like at all, and bring lawsuits and\nthere's no way to prevent our law from becoming generally\nimperialistic in this sense that I've been talking about.\nThat's a way of focusing you back on the comity question,\nand you can answer mine, the comity, whatever you like.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you. Let me put us in the\nanalytical framework again, and that is, we understand,\nlet's -- we're assuming the Sherman Act applies and that\nthere is a right to sue in theory. Now, are there other\nlimitations? Let me be very clear on the fact that these\nare three separate issues and then apply the third prong.\nThis was settled in Hartford Fire. Mr. Shapiro is relying\non the dissent in Hartford Fire for the proposition that\ncomity concerns are built into the definition in the\nSherman Act. That is the position that the majority\nrejected. And although he says the issue is nonetheless\nhere, his page -- page 41, note 16 of their brief in the\ncourt of appeals expressly acknowledged that the question\nis different from the question of comity presented in\nHartford Fire. So that -\nQUESTION: But how -- how is it, in -- in the\nhypothetical that Justice Breyer posed, that comity is\nbuilt in? If they -- simply because someone says it\ndoesn't mean that it is. I -- I just don't see how it is.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I understand. Justice Kennedy,\nthe courts of appeals leading up to Hartford Fire were\nunanimous and then Hartford Fire cites with approval, for\nexample, a case called Mannington Mills, and that is that\nthe courts of appeals had always understood up to the\npoint of Hartford Fire, and then Hartford Fire applied the\nsame analysis, that comity is a restriction on the\nexercise of the jurisdiction conferred by the Sherman Act,\nand so Hartford Fire endorses it.\nAnd then subsequent to Hartford Fire -- and\nJustice Breyer, I am coming back to the substance of the\ncomity analysis -- but let me just say that subsequent to\nHartford Fire, the courts of appeals have applied comity\nrobustly. Let me just cite two cases for you, Metro\nIndustries, which is 82 F.3d 839, and Nippon Paper, 109\nF.3d 1. They have continued to look at all of the\ndifferent considerations.\nAnd so, just to return to structure and then to\nsubstance, the district court and the court of appeals had\nno cause to consider whether or not this case would\ninterfere with international relations. Now, that\nanalysis in the case of monopolization or unfair trade\npractices would preclude the exercise of U.S. antitrust\njurisdictions for several reasons. The first is, here in\nour case we have an international norm. Everybody hates\nprice fixing. Our brief details -\nQUESTION: Mr. Goldstein, may I stop you there,\nbecause you are dividing the universe up in to claims that\neverybody agrees and more controversial applications of\nU.S. antitrust law, but one of the principal objections,\nas I understand it, from other nations is to the treble\ndamages feature. They say, for their consumers, the way\nthey regulate antitrust, there are no treble damages.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. So Justice Breyer, I'm\ngoing to put on the table for a second whether or not our\nlaw applies at all. In detour, Justice Ginsburg, if we\nwere to agree with that, if we were to say that our choice\nof treble damages and their choice of single damages\nrepresented a true conflict, and that is we were\nundercutting a policy judgment by them, the solution would\nnot be to eliminate the jurisdiction that Congress\nconferred in the Sherman Act. It would be to say you\ncan't get greater damages here than single damages,\nbecause that's the norm. That would be the solution. If\nthe position is that comity, Congress intended comity to\ncarve back, what you would say is that Congress would have\nintended in this instance not to allow the foreigners to\nget treble damages.\nQUESTION: What about a forum non conveniens\npolicy that says, you're a foreign purchaser, you\npurchased abroad, you have a nice forum abroad to go to,\ndon't burden the U.S. courts.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Absolutely. There's no question\nthat -- I just cannot remind you enough times that the\npetitioners are attempting to seriously jump the gun.\nThere was no forum non conveniens argument below, there\nwas no comity argument below, there was no conflict of\nlaws argument. All of those -- for example, if there is a\nlegit -- and in fact I can give you an illustration.\nThere is a private class action ongoing in Australia. We\nhave already had one of our claimants drop out of the case\nand go to Australia, because everyone recognizes that's\nwhere your remedy is at.\nWe have, however, a dilemma that Congress\nrecognized, and that is, as Justice Scalia said, with\nrespect to the great majority of the world, and we cite in\nour brief the OECD's formal report on cartels, the seminal\nreport to the Attorney General on international antitrust,\na source after source after source that says there is\ngrave under enforcement of cartels, and I can illustrate\nit here with two facts. The first is, with respect to\nmore than half of the volume of commerce in bulk vitamins,\nmore than half of it, they are going to get away with it.\nAnd that leads to the second fact, because\nthere's no enforcement, public or private, that leads to\nthe second fact, and that is, if they win here, they will\nnet from activities that are per se illegal under the\nSherman Act, net, net, net, $13 billion. That is not a\nmessage of deterrence.\nSo, Justice Ginsburg, that's quite right. There\nare mechanisms for dealing with the fact that there are\nother remedies. I would just put back on the table the\none that says, look Congress would not have intended -\nQUESTION: I don't really see what it's doing on\nthe table. I mean, it didn't require a Nobel Prize winner\nto make me figure out that in fact the worse you treat the\npeople who make the cartel, the less likely they are to do\nit. But I mean, fine, you're right, if we hung and\nquartered them or whatever, they'd do it even less. But\nwhat -- what is that to do with the price of fish, so to\nspeak?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It -- it's the judgment that\nCongress made, Justice Breyer, in the worldwide markets\nthat Justice Kennedy referenced in the first half hour,\nand that is that we will be hurt, unless we go after them.\nBut it doesn't mean, Justice Breyer, that we go after them\nfor every Section 1 or every Section 2 violation.\nSo let me come all the way back to your original\nquestion, and that is, okay, why is the comity analysis\ndifferent here and there? Justice Ginsburg pointed to one\nargument that I was making, that's this is per se illegal.\nIt is -- the second point is that there are disagreements,\nit's related, there are disagreements about whether the\nprimary conduct is illegal in that instance. They don't\nthink a monopoly is a bad thing. But what we do know is\nthat everyone agrees that price fixing is bad. It is not\nan infringement on their ability to regulate primary\nconduct.\nIf, for example, there was a country that said,\nwe love price fixing, I mean, we just think it's so much\nbetter if things are expensive, well, then that might be a\ndifferent case and there might be a forum non motion, but\nthere are no such countries. So it is a very, very, very\ndifferent -\nQUESTION: But -- but I'm -- I'm not sure that\nthe rule you're advocating -- you say that don't -- don't\nworry about the other case, because your case is okay.\nBut we are worried about the other case.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, Justice Kennedy, I -- I\nthink that's right. I think that it is not sufficient for\nme just to say, look, there'll be a comity analysis later\nin the day. But I would say that we are articulating a\nrule, and it is a rule that is limited to -\nQUESTION: And I'm waiting for that rule.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay.\nQUESTION: It's still on the table.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: The rule, Justice Kennedy, is\nthat the Sherman Act applies, but unless there is a\nworldwide market, so that we can say that the injury to\nthe person abroad is inextricably intertwined with the\ninjury to the person here, that claim lacks antitrust\nstanding because it will not directly advance U.S.\ninterests. It is not necessary to advance the protection\nof U.S. -\nQUESTION: So you have flushed them all out that\nway. Now, the ones you have left, which is yours which\nyou like, why can't you bring -- fit right within the\nlanguage here that where this worldwide market is in fact\nsuch that its price in Bolivia is never going to hold up\nunless the price in the United States holds up if you've\ngot the necessary causal relationship to effects in the\nUnited States. That's the second half which you said we\nshould remand. I mean, maybe that's a good half. What's\nwrong with that?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No, we're -- Justice Kennedy, let\nme relate this to your question. That is, Justice Breyer\nis saying, look, the first argument in the red brief is\nthis, this is a case in which the effects in the United\nStates -- and I will come to your Illinois Brick\nobjection, Justice Scalia -- the -- the effects in the\nUnited States did give rise to our claims. He says,\naccept what they say, accept the Fifth Circuit's rule.\nLook, if the cartel had not operated in this country, it\nwould have collapsed, he doesn't need a Nobel Prize, we\nhave one in case you did, and that means that our people\nwere injured. We accept that. It's the first argument in\nour brief. It means that the -- it limits out all of the\ncases that you were worried about, Justice Breyer, because\nin a monopolization case that won't be true, unfair trade\npractices, that won't be true.\nAnd then, Justice Ginsburg, notwithstanding that\nwe have a narrow field of cartel cases, there are only six\nthat have been filed, there are still other options on the\ntable for limiting the claim in the instance that there is\nan available foreign remedy. So that's how it would work.\nWe would accept their argument, we would say there's a\nnarrow class of cases that, Justice Kennedy, are a true\nworldwide market where Congress recognized that, in cases\nlike American Tobacco that it had in mind in the 1982 Act,\nand then we say, look, that's it, that's the full ball of\nwax, we don't become an imperial source of law for the\nworld. That's how we would analyze the case.\nNow, we think that that too addresses any\nconcerns about manageability -\nQUESTION: If you think that the forum non\nconveniens point would work, let's say, for our trading\npartners who have told us they don't like treble damages\nin any case, so are we going to make a distinction then\nand accept the complaint of customers, purchasers of\nvitamins in countries that don't have any antitrust laws,\nbut we would reject claims coming from, say, the U.K. or\nCanada?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: We would reject claims from\nplaces like Australia and Canada and the like, that's\nright. If they have any sort of regime that they have\ndecided to build up, if they've enacted into law, and it's\na viable regime for vindicating interests, so that the\nclient being here isn't necessary -\nQUESTION: Well, but that -- that in itself is a\nrather elaborate inquiry that you find nowhere in the\nstatute.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, Justice -- Mr. Chief\nJustice, the reason is that forum non conveniens is a\nprinciple that's generally applicable to the law and -\nQUESTION: Yeah, but forum non conveniens is\nordinarily not that you have different law, but there are\nother factors that make it inconvenient to try the case.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, that's right.\nI think Justice Ginsburg's view is that where we have -\nQUESTION: Well, she's perfectly capable of\nspeaking her own view. If you'd just answer your -- my\nquestion.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, those factors\nare relevant. I think that a principle factor in the\nforum non analysis would be, could you go somewhere else\nand vindicate your claim? I think maybe that should be a\nvery important part of the analysis.\nQUESTION: But -- but the people from Canada\ncannot go somewhere else and vindicate their claim because\nthe Canadian law is different.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, they do have a\ncompetition law. They've filed a brief in this case, as\nhave a limited number of nations. Justice Scalia points\nout that most don't, and that's, I think, an important\nmanageability -\nQUESTION: But I -- I thought your answer was\nthat the ones that don't can sue here, and the ones that\ndo can't sue here.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: But then you said a moment ago, I\nthought, that the Canadians could sue here, but I -- now\nyou're saying they'd be turned away.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I then misspoke, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nQUESTION: Well, you sure did.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. I then misspoke. If you\n- I think there's an extremely strong argument that if you\ncan go somewhere else, if there's some substantial remedy\navailable in another country, then you can go somewhere\nelse. But they didn't file that motion because they're\ntrying to get rid of the case with respect to the majority\nof bulk vitamins commerce and with respect to most of the\ncommerce in these worldwide markets for which there is no\nremedy. That's just a fact.\nQUESTION: But would you get to my Illinois Brick\nquestion before your time runs out.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nQUESTION: And just so I put the question as -\nas clearly as possible, it seems extraordinary to me that\nif this -- if a foreign company had been injured by buying\ndrugs from an American company that bought them from the\nconspirators at an excessively high price, that foreign\ncompany would not have a cause of action. But you're\nsaying that a foreign company has a cause of action by\nreason of the fact that had the American company not\npurchased at the artificially high conspiratorial price,\nbut at a lower price, they might have purchased from that\n-- from that intermediate person, and -- whereas Illinois\nBrick would clearly bar the first suit, you're saying it\ndoesn't bar the second suit as a rationale for allowing\nthem to sue here, and that strikes me as very strange.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: There are three answers, Justice\nScalia. The first two relate to the technical requirements\nof Illinois Brick and the third explains why you shouldn't\nread Illinois Brick to bar such claims. The first is that\nwe're not merely talking about arbitragers. We're talking\nabout, there are companies in the United States that made\nvitamins and they would have sold to our clients absent\nthe cartel. The intermediary isn't a necessary part of\nthe picture.\nThe second is that even though you buy from an\nintermediary, under Illinois Brick you still have a claim,\nand that is you have a right to bring an action for an\ninjunction.\nThe third is that, look, our reading, the one\nthat says, and that Justice Breyer has hypothesized,\naccept what they're saying and allow the claim only if the\ninjury is tied into a worldwide market. That's a reading\nthat protects U.S. interests. To say that Congress set up\nthe structure, whereas -- that would allow you to look at\nthe foreigners through clause 2, but eliminate all of\ntheir claims on Illinois Brick grounds, would render the\nstatute and its -- its provisions against cartels\nineffectual.\nQUESTION: As far as your first point is\nconcerned, I understand the other side to concede that if\nyou could demonstrate that you would have bought from one\nof these American companies that manufactured in\nconnection with this conspiracy and sold at the\nconspiratorial price, you would -- you would have a cause\nof action. That clearly would have -- would -- would be\n- affect the export commerce from the United States.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Two answers, Justice Scalia. The\nfirst is, I disagree. They do not concede that. They\nregard that as a hypothetical purchase, to use Mr.\nShapiro's words, it didn't happen. And the second is, and\nthis goes back, Justice Ginsburg, to a question you asked\nin the first half hour, the reason we don't have -- thank\nyou.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Goldstein.\nNow, Mr. Shapiro, you have four minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. SHAPIRO: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. The\ncourt of appeals and Mr. Goldstein have relied on the\ndeterrence concept here, but it's important to remember\nthat the Government, supported by seven of our allies and\ntrading partners, has said that this position is going to\nundermine deterrence. Why? Because it's going to reduce\nthe detection of international price-fixing cartels, and\nyou get zero deterrence if you don't have actual detection\nof overseas cartel behavior.\nThe key to getting the detection is the amnesty\nprogram and international cooperation with our allies, and\nright now, our allies are shrinking away from the United\nStates, information-sharing agreements that are needed\nhere to investigate and prosecute cartels. The Justice\nDepartment officials have been giving speeches about that\nbad effect, so there's a very serious danger of\nundermining deterrence here if this position is accepted.\nNow, on comity of nations, that is not a\njudicial balancing of one factor and another equitable\nfactor. That's a rule of statutory interpretation that\nthis Court has applied ever since the Charming Betsy case\n200 years ago, and what it means is that if a particular\nalternative is presented that broadly construes our laws\nto intrude into the affairs of other nations and cause\nfriction, that interpretation is going to be rejected, and\nthat was certainly not rejected in the Hartford case.\nProfessor Areta, in his treatise, pointed out\nthat our antitrust laws do not rule the entire commercial\nworld, and that's a concept that's written right into\nSection 1 of the Sherman Act. It applies to -- its domain\nis commerce among the states and commerce with foreign\nnations, not commerce within foreign nations, not commerce\nbetween foreign nations.\nAnd the reason the FTAIA drew the sharp lines\nthat it did is the reason that Justice Breyer was driving\nat. Other nations have their own policies. They\ndisapproved treble damages. They have their own\nprocedures for dealing with antitrust issues instead of\nper se rules and rules of reason, they have prohibitions\nand then a series of exemptions applied by expert\nadministrators. So if our courts take these issues over\nand apply treble damage remedies, they override procedure,\nthey override the -- the substance of these laws, and -\nand they are certainly going to override policies against\ntreble damages, which have provoked huge international\ndiscord in the form of claw-back statutes, blocking\nstatutes. Our closest allies have responded to\noverreaching that way, and Congress wanted to minimize\nthat problem with passage of the statute.\nNow, the Timken case that counsel referred to\nwas a case where the Government was going after contracts\noverseas that injured our commerce. The Government was not\ngoing after practices overseas that had effects overseas\nand not here. Counsel referred to the weight of\nscholarship. I read all those articles. There's only one\nof them that suggests that everybody in the world can come\ntrooping into our courts if some person here has an\nantitrust claim from two private practitioners who had no\nbackground in the Government. They simply asserted that\nwithout any analysis. I don't think that constitutes\nweighty scholarship.\nNow, the National Bank of Canada case that\ncounsel referred to, if in fact that's the case that\nCongress meant to approve, that means they're out of\ncourt, because that's a case where the complaint was\ndismissed because the injury was felt in Canada and was\nnot felt in the United States, and the Second Circuit\ndismissed that claim as a matter of law.\nNow, on this worldwide market point, the -- the\nstatutes here hinge jurisdiction on commerce. Lawyers can\nalways draw a global conspiracy. Economists can always\nsay there's a global market, and these issues would be\nenormous quagmires for the district courts if that's what\nour courts' jurisdiction turned on. Congress did not\nintend that. It intended a clear jurisdictional benchmark\nby focusing on our commerce. There has to be an injury to\nour commerce and the plaintiff before the court has to be\nalleging treble damages based on that particular injury.\nIn -- in light of these considerations, the\nJustice Department's position, the position of our allies,\nwho have submitted amicus briefs, we submit that this\ndecision is an error and it should be reversed and I thank\nthe Court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Shapiro.\n"
