        "content": "(10:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in No. 04-340, San Remo Hotel v. the City and County\nof San Francisco.\nMr. Utrecht, is that --\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL UTRECHT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. UTRECHT: Yes, Your Honor.\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nThe Ninth Circuit decision in this case should\nbe reversed for three reasons.\nThe first reason is that the result is unfair\nand the rationale of the court is unfair.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, what are your --\nexactly what claims are -- is your client now raising in\nFederal court? I mean, we don't take a case to just\ndecide if something is unfair. What are the precise\nclaims your client is raising now in Federal court?\nMR. UTRECHT: My client is making a facial and\nas-applied takings challenge to both the hotel conversion\nordinance and the regulatory scheme of which it is a part.\nAnd that claim -- that Federal --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: I somehow thought that your\nquestion had boiled down to whether there was issue\npreclusion here. Am I wrong?\nMR. UTRECHT: The issue before this Court is\nwhether there's issue preclusion --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: I'm talking about the issues\nin this Court.\nMR. UTRECHT: Okay. The issue in this Court is\nwhether the Federal takings claim should be precluded\nunder issue preclusion by a State court judgment that did\nnot decide the Federal takings claim and could not have\ndecided the Federal takings claim.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, as I understand, I -- I\nwould -- I will grant you that there are moments in the --\nin the Ninth Circuit opinion in which there seems to be a\nshift back and forth in the rhetoric between claim\npreclusion and issue preclusion. But as I understand what\nthe Ninth Circuit held, it did not hold that your claim\nwas necessarily out of court because of claim preclusion.\nIt held that your claim failed because of the effect of\nissue preclusion on elements that were common, factual\nelements common to both the claim in the State court and\nthe claim that you sought to bring in the Federal court.\nAm -- am I correct about that, about what the Ninth\nCircuit held?\nMR. UTRECHT: The Ninth Circuit did limit its\nholding to issue preclusion. It did not rule on claim\npreclusion.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. UTRECHT: The other part of your question\nabout whether it was based on factual determinations could\nnot have been based on factual determinations. Instead,\nit was based on the prior State court determination that\nwe did not state a claim -- state a cause of action under\nCalifornia law for State compensation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, the Supreme\nCourt of California decided only the State constitutional\nquestion, did it not?\nMR. UTRECHT: That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.\nAnd because of that, we have never had an\nopportunity to have our Federal takings claim decided on\nthe merits. We believe that that undermines the Federal\ncourts' primacy in deciding Federal questions,\nparticularly Federal constitutional questions. We also\nbelieve --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, it was this Court's\ndecision in the Williamson County case that led you and I\nassume other lawyers in these takings cases to return to\nState court and try to litigate everything. Isn't that\nright?\nMR. UTRECHT: This Court in Williamson County\nsaid that before you could bring a Federal takings claim,\nyou had to go to State court and seek compensation under\nState law.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And you haven't asked us to\nrevisit that Williamson County case, have you?\nMR. UTRECHT: We have not asked that this Court\nreconsider the decision in Williamson County.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Maybe you should have.\nMR. UTRECHT: Well, at this point I don't think\nthat we can. Perhaps we could have in 1998 when the Ninth\nCircuit applied the Williamson County case and ordered us\nto go to State court with our unripe Federal claims,\nunripe under this Court's holding in Williamson.\nBut I think that at this point the question\nbefore the Court is given that we've complied with the\nprocedural requirements that this Court established in\nWilliamson County, are we now precluded by issue\npreclusion in the second litigation that this Court\nordered because of the State court compensation ruling.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Utrecht, you -- you refer\nto the primacy of Federal courts. I'm -- I'm not clear as\nto whether you are arguing for a different disposition\nwhere a suit is first brought in Federal court erroneously\nbecause there's been no exhaustion and then the plaintiff\nis sent back to State court from the situation in which a\nplaintiff does the right thing and goes to State court\nimmediately. Now, in that case, would -- would you still\nargue for primacy of the Federal court?\nMR. UTRECHT: Absolutely, Your Honor. I think\nthat what this Court established in Williamson County is a\ntwo separate litigation scheme. The first litigation\nconcerns State compensation, and the second litigation\nconcerns the Federal takings claim.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So -- so your case does not\nhinge on the fact that when the State court acted, there\nwas a pending -- a pending Federal case asking for the\nFederal constitutional question to be resolved by a\nFederal court.\nMR. UTRECHT: That's correct. I think that the\nSecond Circuit got this issue correct in the Santini case\nwhen it concluded that whether you started in Federal\ncourt and were ordered to proceed to State court under\nWilliamson County or you looked at the Williamson County\ncase and said, I'm going to start in State court because\nthat's what Williamson County says that I'm required to\ndo, it doesn't matter. It shouldn't matter for purposes\nof issue preclusion on the Federal takings claim once it\nhas been made ripe under the procedures required by\nWilliamson County.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it your position that\nissue preclusion doesn't apply at all, or that there was\nno issue decided in the State court proceeding that\ncarries over into the Federal proceeding? Which one is\nit? What -- you suggested -- you said, number one, no\nfacts were found. The question was whether there was\nsufficient statements to survive a 12(b)(6) or its\ncounterpart dismissal motion.\nMR. UTRECHT: Our -- our primary position is\nthat issue preclusion does not apply for the same reasons\nthat this Court found that issue preclusion did not apply\nin England when you were required to do two separate\nlitigations. The question of whether the Ninth Circuit\ncorrectly applied issue preclusion law -- we also raise\nthat as our last argument in our opening brief, but our\nprimary argument here today is that issue preclusion\nshould not apply at all to Federal --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And if it did -- if it did\napply, what issues would be precluded?\nMR. UTRECHT: In our position no issue should be\nprecluded because under California law, which the Ninth\nCircuit was obligated to apply, only identical issues that\nare resolved under a different set of laws can be\nprecluded in the second proceeding, and there was no\nidentical issue finding by the Ninth Circuit. Instead,\nthe Ninth Circuit applied its equivalent determination\nfinding.\nBut I think that the -- the real issue before\nthis Court is not the California preclusion law question,\nbut the real issue is whether this Court's decision in\nEngland should -- or the rationale of this Court's\ndecision in England should be applied to the very similar\ncircumstances raised by --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is -- excuse me. Is -- is it\nyour position that there is an exaction here?\nMR. UTRECHT: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It -- are -- are you bound by\na finding in the State court that there was no exaction,\nor was there no such finding?\nMR. UTRECHT: I don't believe there was such a\nfinding. I think that the California Supreme Court\ndecided that the exaction met the State law compensation\nrequirements and did not --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Was the -- was the Ninth\nCircuit wrong in indicating that there was no exaction?\nThat's the way I read its opinion.\nMR. UTRECHT: I -- I don't read the Ninth\nCircuit's opinion as saying there was no exaction. I\nthink the Ninth Circuit held that the exaction was imposed\nby legislation rather than by an administrative\nproceeding, and because of that, it was subject to a\ndifferent standard than exactions imposed in\nadministrative proceedings.\nBut I think there's no question in this case\nthat an -- an exaction was imposed and was actually paid.\nThis is not a -- this is not a case where there's an issue\nabout whether the exaction was imposed. The issues were\nwhat standard was used to review that exaction and whether\nthe exaction was constitutional.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but the Ninth Circuit\nseemed to think that Dolan doesn't apply, and I take it\nthat you would say that it does.\nMR. UTRECHT: Well, I think this Court has not\ndecided whether exactions imposed by legislation are\ntreated differently than exactions imposed by\nadministrative proceedings. The State court in this case\ndetermined that under State compensation law that\nmattered. But this Court has not decided that. The Ninth\nCircuit seemed to indicate that it was in general\nagreement with the California Supreme Court, but again,\nbecause it didn't actually decide the merits, it just\ndecided that there was an equivalent determination under\nState law, it didn't get to the final question of whether\nthis was an exaction and what the proper standard was.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you don't want us get that\n-- to that question either, whether Dolan applies or not.\nMR. UTRECHT: I did want this Court to get to\nthat question, but when this Court rejected question 2, I\nthink this Court decided that it did not want to get to\nthat question. But we -- and we did not brief that\nquestion because this Court did not grant certiorari on\nquestion number 2. But we definitely did want this Court\nto decide that question, and obviously, if -- since the\nCourt can't decide it in this case, we would, obviously,\nwant the Court to decide it in some other case, hopefully\nbefore this case is finally resolved in the courts.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Utrecht, if I understand\nthe respondents' brief correctly, there is on pages 10 and\n11 a whole list of issues that they say were determined --\nraised, litigated, and determined in the State court. So,\nfor example, that the HCO's housing replacement fees bear\na reasonable relationship to loss of housing, the use of a\ndefined historical measure -- measurement point reasonably\nrelated to the HCO's -- and it goes on for a paragraph,\nciting issues that respondents say -- says were raised,\nlitigated, and decided in the California Supreme Court.\nMR. UTRECHT: I think that technically what the\nCalifornia Supreme Court decided was that our facts did\nnot state a cause of action under State law. What they\ncite here as findings are actually discussions of the\nlegal issues raised by the State court complaint under\nState law. They don't amount to a factual finding. There\nwas no trial. There was no summary judgment motion.\nThere was no evidence presented on any of these points.\nThese are --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: How did the case go\nup? On a motion to dismiss?\nMR. UTRECHT: The case in State court went up on\na motion to dismiss, which was granted by the trial court,\nreversed by the State court of appeal, and then affirmed\nby the California Supreme Court.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So, in effect, then maybe --\nare you saying this, that there is no issue preclusion\nhere because the -- the ruling that there was no statement\nof a cause of action was, in fact, a disposition of the\nclaim without there being any resolution of any fact issue\nupon which the claim might depend. Is that what you're\nsaying? And therefore -- and -- and that is the reason\nwhy there is no issue preclusion? Is that your argument?\nMR. UTRECHT: That's not the argument that we\nmade in this Court. That is an argument that we made in\nthe lower courts. The argument that we're making in this\nCourt is rather that under the England case -- or rather,\nthe rationale of the England case, there shouldn't be any\nissue preclusion whether or not the State courts made any\nfactual findings. I don't think that the question as\nframed by Your Honor is presented by the briefs. I mean,\nobviously, that was a contention of ours. We think that's\na correct statement of how the case should have been\nresolved by the Ninth Circuit, but the Ninth Circuit\ninstead chose not to look at that issue or not to decide\nthe case on that issue, but instead to decide under its\nprior precedents of Dodd and Palomar, that issue\npreclusion applied and then applied its own formulation of\nthe equivalent --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- but isn't there an\nessential step to find out that there were issues?\nBecause I think the way you're phrasing the question, it\nsays, if there were issues decided, they weren't\nprecluded. But if there are no issues, that's -- that's\nnot what's involved in this case. The simplest ground on\nwhich you could knock out issue preclusion is that no\nissues were decided.\nMR. UTRECHT: That would be a simple route to\nknocking out the case. The Ninth Circuit rejected that\nargument. That question did not seem cert-worthy and --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- what were the issues\nthat the Ninth Circuit thought were decided?\nMR. UTRECHT: I can't quite tell. I think what\nthe Ninth Circuit said was that because State law and\nFederal law on this question was similar, at least in the\nNinth Circuit's understanding, that the State court\ndetermination was an equivalent determination. Once they\nmade that finding, that there was an equivalent\ndetermination under State law, the Ninth Circuit decided\nthat the claim must be precluded by issue preclusion.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, issue preclusion does\nextend to questions of law, as well as fact.\nMR. UTRECHT: It does extend to questions of\nlaw. The problem, of course, is that the State court\nquestion of law that was decided was whether our -- we\nwere entitled to compensation under State compensation\nlaw. The State court did not decide whether we were\nentitled to just compensation under the Fifth Amendment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought they said that their\n-- their compensation law was congruent with ours?\nMR. UTRECHT: The California Supreme Court did\nsay that its compensation law --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What do you -- what do you\nthink that means?\nMR. UTRECHT: I think that means that the\nCalifornia Supreme Court would like to believe that its\nlaw is congruent with this Court's decisions.\nI think that, in fact, the California Supreme\nCourt does not follow this Court's precedents in this area\nof law, and I think we actually argued the first time that\nwe were in front of the Ninth Circuit, that it was futile\nto go to State court precisely for that reason. That\nargument was also rejected by the Ninth Circuit. I think\nthat it cannot be that the State courts are going to be\nthe -- our final arbiter of whether their law is in fact\ncongruent with Federal law or not. It left either to this\nCourt --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: What do you understand\nthe word congruent to mean?\nMR. UTRECHT: I think congruent means that it's\nequivalent. I think -- I think the Ninth Circuit's view\nof an equivalent determination is that it's close. It's\nclose enough for government work, perhaps.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: What -- what is the claim you\nwant to make? That is, my reading of the California State\ncourt opinion says you came into their court and you said,\nlook, this ordinance in San Francisco violates the Fifth\nAmendment, I guess, because it doesn't make any sense.\nThe -- there's no good basis, no sound basis for requiring\nus to pay a fee in order to convert rooms. Anyway, the\nroom isn't a house. Anyway, it makes no sense as applied\nto us. Anyway, they admit they just want to raise\nrevenue. Anyway, we're going to give the tenant a place\nto live for the rest of his life. All right. Those were\nthe claims.\nAnd in each case, the California Supreme Court\nsaid you're wrong. You're wrong because it does help\npreserve rooms, because it does have a reasonable purpose\nin a city that's crowded, because the tenant who's there\nfor life might move out, and we want to keep the room even\nif he moves out because he dies. And anyway, it's not an\nissue of whether your case is special. This makes sense\nas a general rule.\nAll right? They decided it. You raised it.\nThey decided it.\nNow, what else is it you want to raise in\nFederal court?\nMR. UTRECHT: I think that what's important is\nthe very beginning of your question. You said that we\nsaid in State court that it violated the Fifth Amendment.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't know if you said it. I\njust said that that is what I read in the California\nSupreme Court opinion that Justice Werdegar wrote. And so\nwhat I'm asking you is whether they should have or whether\nthey shouldn't have, they did seem to decide those five\nissues. And so my question to you is, what else do you\nwant to raise?\nMR. UTRECHT: The California Supreme Court\ndecided whether those legal propositions were relevant\nunder the State constitution and the State compensation --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought it decided a\ndifferent thing. I thought that it decided that in part\nthat was the reason for their decision. But the reason\nthey reached their decision is they thought on each of\nthose five matters that the City of San Francisco had a\nreasonable legislative purpose for its ordinance.\nMR. UTRECHT: And they made that decision under\nState law. They -- they --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Just as, suppose, for example,\nthey had decided that the hotel clerk or the temporary\nmanager did speak English, and in fact, he was a scholar\nof English. And suppose that that had been the key matter\nfor its decision of State law. I take it, if you came\ninto Federal court, even if the issue were quite\ndifferent, you would be bound by that factual\ndetermination.\nThat's why I'm asking you. It seems to me here\nthey have decided matters of whether there was a\nreasonable purpose or not for this particular ordinance\nand as applied to you. Now, what else do you want to\nraise in Federal court that was not encompassed by what I\njust described?\nMR. UTRECHT: In the hypothetical that Your\nHonor gave of a factual determination that the clerk spoke\nEnglish well, that fact under the England case and under\nEngland's rationale would be subject to relitigation in\nFederal court in the Pullman context. And we believe that\nthere's no significant difference between our context and\nthe Pullman context.\nI do recognize that that is contrary to the\nnormal rules of res judicata. The normal rules of res\njudicata are designed to prevent exactly what this Court\ndecided should be -- should happen --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But am I right? I'm just\ntrying to narrow the issue in my mind. Am I right you\nwant to raise one, two, three, four, or five of those\nissues that I just described and nothing more?\nMR. UTRECHT: The factual claims --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Am I right about that?\nMR. UTRECHT: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Thank you.\nMR. UTRECHT: The factual claims that we're\nmaking in Federal court are the same factual claims that\nwe made in the State court --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but is there precedent\nthat what is reasonable for the State constitution is\nalways reasonable for the Federal Constitution?\nMR. UTRECHT: That --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, this is somewhat\ndifferent than simply a specific factual finding.\nMR. UTRECHT: Well, in this particular case,\nthey found that the facts that we alleged did not give\nrise to a right to compensation under State law. And this\nCourt in Williamson said once you've been denied\ncompensation in State court, once it's certain that the\nState courts will not provide you relief under State law,\nyou have a ripe Federal takings claim.\nAt that point, the Federal courts must be able\nto look at the factual questions underpinning the Federal\ntakings analysis, so that the questions of whether in fact\nthis law substantially advances a legitimate government\ninterest or it interferes unduly with the reasonable\ninvestment-backed expectations under Penn Central, which\nrequires a detailed ad hoc factual analysis, that that\nmust be done by the Federal courts and cannot be precluded\nby a State court determination that is not considering the\nFederal questions at the time or -- and it cannot even\nunder this Court's decision in Williamson County -- cannot\nconsider the Federal question that's at issue.\nThe -- the city-- the city contends that -- that\na decision in our favor would result in --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I interrupt? Because I'm\njust not following one part of your argument. Are you\nsaying that the Pennsylvania analysis, the ad hoc\nanalysis, was not made in the State court?\nMR. UTRECHT: No, I'm not saying that it was not\nmade. I'm saying that a State court disposed of that\nclaim without doing a factual trial, but simply based on\nthe allegations in the complaint.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why -- now, why should that\nnot be binding on you if your allegations were, in fact,\ninsufficient under Penn Central?\nMR. UTRECHT: The court did not find that they\nwere insufficient under Penn Central. The court found\nthat under State compensation law, which it believed was\ncongruent with this Court's decision in Penn Central --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I can understand how you\nshould be free to argue that in fact the two rules are not\ncongruent, that there's broader recovery under the Federal\nsystem. But if we decided that the two -- if we agreed\nwith them that they were congruent, then why should not\nissue preclusion apply?\nMR. UTRECHT: Issue preclusion should not apply\nbecause it prevents the Federal courts from deciding the\nFederal takings questions. If --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but -- but it's just a\nconclusion from issues that have -- have been resolved on\nwhich normally we would defer to the State court. Now,\nwhy -- why shouldn't we defer here again?\nMR. UTRECHT: You shouldn't defer here because\nin Williamson County, you required that parties go through\ntwo litigations.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right.\nMR. UTRECHT: And all the rules of res judicata\nare designed to prevent two litigations and to require a\nsingle litigation. It makes no sense, in the context of a\ntwo-litigation system that this Court set up, to then\nimpose issue preclusion. Otherwise, Federal --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But it isn't --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That doesn't make sense.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: It isn't clear from\nWilliamson County that this Court envisioned two -- two\nseparate determinations of fact issues: one in State\ncourt and one in Federal. That isn't clear from the face\nof Williamson County. That was a case where it was\nthought, at least, by members of the Court that the claims\nin that case just weren't ripe yet.\nMR. UTRECHT: Correct.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And I don't -- I didn't\nunderstand it to set up parallel systems of factual\ndeterminations.\nMR. UTRECHT: It clearly set up parallel systems\nof litigation. It did not discuss the question of what\nhappens in the second litigation, but I think that this\nCourt in England decided the proper solution to a\nsituation where the Federal law requires --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, England was an\nabstention case and had to deal with the effect of 28 U.S.\nCode 1738, the Full Faith and Credit Act. But I didn't\nthink that the England case just totally destroyed the\nnotion of full faith and credit --\nMR. UTRECHT: The England case --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- as -- as applied section\n1738.\nMR. UTRECHT: The England case held that when\nyou're required to do two separate litigations, the first\nin State court and the second in Federal court as a result\nof Pullman abstention, that in the second case there would\nbe no factual or legal issues that were decided in the\nState court that would be preclusive in deciding the\nFederal --\nJUSTICE BREYER: My --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: This is not a -- a Pullman\nabstention case here.\nMR. UTRECHT: As it comes to this Court, it is\nnot a Pullman abstention case.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: No.\nMR. UTRECHT: It is a case where Williamson\nCounty has held that before you can bring your Federal\ntakings claim, you must first go to State court and obtain\na determination of whether you're entitled to\ncompensation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: I don't think that\nWilliamson County ever contemplated that you would have to\ntake your case all the way to the Supreme Court of the\nState. Now, it may be that you had no choice once you got\ninto the State court.\nMR. UTRECHT: I think that's correct, Mr. Chief\nJustice. The Williamson County case says that you have to\ngo to State court and use the State procedures available\nfor State compensation. You cannot do that without going\nthrough the appellate procedure provided by the State\ncourts --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Do you think\nWilliamson County by its terms spoke of going to State\ncourt and -- rather than just a State administrative\nproceeding?\nMR. UTRECHT: As -- as I read the Williamson\nCounty opinion, it says that you have to use the State\nprocedures that are available to obtain compensation. And\nthe State procedures in California are an inverse\ncondemnation claim under State law, i.e., a State\ncompensation claim, which, as I read Williamson County --\nand I think all the other practitioners of takings law\nread Williamson County -- means that you have to go to\nState court and ask for compensation before you can\nproceed to Federal court.\nNow, it is possible that a State could have an\nadministrative procedure instead of a judicial procedure\nin order to decide takings claim -- rather, to decide\nState compensation claims. If there were such an\nadministrative procedure for obtaining State compensation,\nthen that perhaps is what Williamson County envisioned\nthat you would follow. But I think Williamson County says\nwhatever procedure is provided by the State, you have to\nexhaust that and obtain a denial from the State of your\nright to compensation before you can proceed to Federal\ncourt.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If you -- if you disagreed with\nthe resolution of an issue by the State court, which issue\nwould be determinative of your Federal claim, if we hold\nagainst you here? Do you think you would have a right to\nappeal that State court -- State Supreme Court resolution\nof that issue to this Court?\nMR. UTRECHT: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what strikes me as\nstrange about this -- this system is -- is not leaving it\nto the State courts to make these decisions. That's\nperfectly fine. We do that all the time. But these are\ndecisions that are going to be conclusive on -- on a\nFederal claim, and yet there's no way to -- to appeal from\nthe State Supreme Court here.\nMR. UTRECHT: I think that's exactly the\nproblem. That was the problem we faced when the\nCalifornia Supreme Court did not decide our Federal\nclaims. I think because they only decided our State\nclaims, we were not able to seek certiorari on the merits\nfrom the State Supreme Court decision, and then I think\nthe procedure contemplated by this Court in Williamson\nCounty was that you could return to Federal court with\nyour Federal claim once the State compensation claim --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Didn't you seek to\nreserve the Federal question in the -- in the State court\nlitigation?\nMR. UTRECHT: We did reserve the Federal\nquestion in the State court litigation.\nI'd like to reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Mr.\nUtrecht.\nMr. Waxman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe respondents had a full and fair opportunity\nto litigate every issue relevant to their Federal claims.\nWhen they came to Federal court, they agreed that, with\none exception, all of the relevant issues, both the\nultimate issue of a reasonable relationship and all of the\npredicate issues that we recited, as Justice Ginsburg\nnoted, at pages 10 and at 11 of our brief, had already\nbeen litigated.\nThey said that they -- there was one difference,\nwhich is that they claimed that under the Fifth Amendment,\nthe level of scrutiny under a substantially advances\nclaim, which is what they were litigating, was the\nNollan/Dolan test of rough proportionality, not the more\ndeferential standard of review that the California Supreme\nCourt applied in its decision. And as to that issue, they\nreceived a full litigation and adjudication on the merits\nin the courts below. They petitioned this Court on that\nsubstantive question.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: You say the courts\nbelow. Are you talking about the California State courts\nor the Ninth Circuit?\nMR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, here I was\nreferring to the district court and the Ninth Circuit\nfollowing the California Supreme Court's decision.\nThey came to the courts and said there's one\nthing that's different. There's one element that's\ndifferent, and that is Nollan and Dolan. Heightened\nscrutiny should apply to a financial exaction of this\nsort. The California Supreme Court disagreed under\nCalifornia law. We want to litigate that issue here, and\nthey did. The district court ruled against them on the\nmerits. The Ninth Circuit ruled against them on the\nmerits. They petitioned this Court in question 2. This\nCourt denied review.\nIn all other respects, their claims -- their\ncase under their Federal claims, which were not claim-\nprecluded, were, as the district court found, quote, based\non the exact same facts and circumstances argued before\nthe State courts.\nNow, they -- their case here boils down -- and\nit's quite clear from their reply brief, and Mr. Utrecht\nhas reaffirmed it -- to an argument that this Court's 1963\ndecision in England ought to be extended to the Williamson\nCounty context. Now, I believe that England is\ndistinguishable -- highly distinguishable from the facts\nor the circumstances of a Williamson County remand for any\nnumber of reasons that I can explain.\nBut ultimately my point is this. England is\nfatal to them. If England were extended to this\ncircumstance, they would lose, and that is because in\nEngland, the Court was entirely clear that as to the State\nlaw issue that the Supreme Court said should be presented\nto the Louisiana courts first for determination, there was\nno doubt that issue preclusion was going to apply to that.\nThe question was whether or not principles of preclusion\nwould bar them from coming back to Federal court\notherwise.\nIn other words, in England, the question --\nthere was a challenge by chiropractors to a State law that\nsaid chiropractors have to go to medical school or\nsomething like that. A Federal complaint was raised under\n1983, saying that violates our Fourteenth Amendment\nrights. That's wrong. The Supreme Court said, well, wait\na minute. We're not sure that the Louisiana law covers\nchiropractors, and if it doesn't, we can avoid the Federal\nconstitutional question. So we're going to, in effect,\ncertify to the Louisiana courts the question, the State\nlaw question, whether chiropractors are covered.\nNow --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, I mean, they\ndidn't really certify it.\nMR. WAXMAN: No. They used -- they -- they\nabstained under the Pullman doctrine which, as this Court\nhas explained, is a procedure that is akin to the\ncertification process where States use it.\nBut in any event, no one -- when -- no one would\nhave thought for a moment that having gone to litigate\nthat State law issue in State court, if they had lost,\nEngland -- the chiropractors could come back and say,\nokay, we think that we shouldn't have to comply with this\nlaw for two reasons: one, because we're not covered by\nthe law even though the Louisiana courts thought so; and\ntwo, if we were, the Fourteenth Amendment would prohibit\nit.\nThey -- the question on which you granted review\nis limited to those issues, and there is a fair question\non the record in this case whether any of those issues are\nreally before the Court now. But as to those issues, for\nwhich Williamson County requires that a party resort first\nto State procedures, whether issue preclusion applies, and\nthe -- the extension of England by analogy to this would\ndictate the answer yes. It may not apply if -- if you\nextend England to all other types of issues that a party\nmay litigate along with their Williamson County ripening\nexercise. But the very determination that Federal law\nrequires them to obtain under State law, prior to stating\na ripe Federal constitutional claim, of course, gets issue\npreclusion.\nNow, the question was asked --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do you think it's open to us\nto reconsider aspects of Williamson County in this case?\nMR. WAXMAN: I don't think -- well, I would have\nto take a very deep breath before I told the Court that it\nwas not open to the Court to reconsider just about\nanything that touched on it. I think it would be --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: It -- frankly, it isn't clear\nto me that the Court ever contemplated just cutting off\nany determination in Federal court of takings claims in\nthe way that it seems to work out by application of\nWilliamson County.\nMR. WAXMAN: Let me explain why I think it would\nbe imprudent for the Court to resolve it and then explain\nwhy I think it's fair to say that the Court didn't\nconsider one way or the other principles of preclusion in\napplication of the Full Faith and Credit Act in Williamson\nCounty.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, it's clear we didn't.\nSo now we're faced with the consequences of that, and it\nlooks to me like the lower courts have run pretty far with\nWilliamson County. So what's a takings claimant supposed\nto do?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, I think it would be imprudent\nto decide -- I -- I think that the Court will have to\nelaborate on the Williamson County requirement and how the\nprocedures work. I hope, after all the preparation for\nthis argument, I'll be able to participate in some way in\nthat debate because it's a really interesting question.\nBut it's not presented here because even if you were to\nreconsider Williamson County, even if you were to overrule\nit, it wouldn't affect the outcome here.\nWe know two things are true in this case,\nwhatever Williamson County means doesn't mean or shouldn't\nmean. Every issue relevant to the Federal constitutional\nclaims was fully and fairly litigated in this case, and we\nalso know that under --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, now, wait a\nminute. You don't mean that the Fifth Amendment question\nwas fully and fairly litigated in the Supreme Court of\nCalifornia.\nMR. WAXMAN: No. The Supreme Court of\nCalifornia said that it was not deciding the Federal --\nthe Fifth Amendment Federal constitutional question. But\nthey -- they concede that all of the issues that make up\nthe -- the Federal constitutional question were fully and\nfairly litigated in the California courts except the\nquestion of whether the Fifth Amendment, as opposed to the\nCalifornia takings provision, is entitled to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, what --\nMR. WAXMAN: -- to Nollan and Dolan. And that\nwas litigated here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: What preclusion law do\nyou apply? The Ninth Circuit apparently applied Oregon\npreclusion law.\nMR. WAXMAN: The -- it's -- the Full Faith and\nCredit Act requires that you -- requires that you apply\nthe preclusion law of the State that rendered the judgment\nto which --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Which would be\nCalifornia.\nMR. WAXMAN: Which would be California. And I\ndo think, with respect, Mr. Chief Justice, that the\nCalifornia Supreme Court -- I'm sorry -- the Ninth Circuit\nmade clear that it was applying California preclusion law.\nIt cited the California Supreme -- a -- California\nauthorities, and it correctly recited the elements of the\nCalifornia preclusion law in this regard.\nIt did make reference to its prior determination\nin Dodd v. Hood River, which was an Oregon case, in which\nthe Ninth Circuit decided that an England reservation in\nthe Williamson County context was effective with respect\nto claim preclusion but not issue preclusion. And in that\nrespect -- and this I think goes back to Justice\nO'Connor's question about, you know, what -- what could we\nhave been thinking or not thinking in Williamson County --\nthe -- the Dodd case provides a pretty good example.\nAt the time this Court decided Williamson\nCounty, many, probably most States did not have a\nsubstantive takings jurisprudence that was akin to the\nFederal standard. For example, California itself, New\nYork didn't provide compensation for regulatory takings at\nall. In those States, there would be no question of\neither claim or issue preclusion because in the course of\ndeciding whether or not compensation was due under State\nlaw, there would be few, if any, common issues decided.\nNow, as the Ninth Circuit explained in Dodd v.\nHood River, Oregon recognizes -- in the context of\nregulatory takings, recognizes an Agins type claim, that\nis where you are completely denied all economic value to\nyour -- I'm sorry -- a Lucas claim, but they don't\nrecognize the Penn Central standard. They don't provide\ncompensation unless you are denied all economic value.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Waxman, can I ask you this\nquestion? Supposing the California court had decided the\nFederal -- the Federal Fifth Amendment question or in the\n-- the England case supposing the Louisiana State court\nhad decided the Fourteenth Amendment question, would there\nbe issue preclusion on that issue in -- in that -- in that\nsequence?\nMR. WAXMAN: Issue preclusion or claim\npreclusion?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Either one.\nMR. WAXMAN: I think the answer is there -- if\nEngland -- if the England decision were extended to the\nWilliamson County context, there would not be claim\npreclusion. We think it shouldn't be extended, and\ntherefore if they litigated both their State claim and\ntheir Federal claim in State court, we think they would be\nbarred both by issue and claim preclusion.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, they could have come\nup here, though. I mean, maybe that was their mistake in\nnot making their Federal claim in the California court.\nThe California court would have denied their State claim,\npresumably denied their Federal claim, and -- and both\ncould have come up here I suppose. Or -- or would the\nCalifornia's -- would California's determination of the\nState questions preclude a separate determination of the\nFederal questions?\nMR. WAXMAN: I -- I don't -- I don't think so,\nJustice Scalia. I think it was certainly open to them and\nthe -- the Ninth Circuit, in its first opinion, made clear\nthat it was open to them, when they went -- when they did\ntheir Williamson County ripening, to also litigate the\nFederal constitutional question. And in that instance, if\nthey lost in the California courts, of course, they could\nhave petitioned. They couldn't -- if they lost on the\nState constitution, the court would have had to reach the\nFederal constitutional question as well.\nBut I think, Justice Scalia, more to your point\nabout what actually happened here, I think that a very\ngood argument -- I -- I don't think that there's really\nmuch doubt that if they had petitioned for certiorari from\nthe California Supreme Court decision, you could easily\nhave granted review under Zacchini and Michigan v. Long\nand Ruiz because the California Supreme Court said, to be\nsure we are deciding only the State constitutional\nquestion. We are not ruling on the Fifth Amendment. But\nthey made very clear that, whatever congruent means --\nthey made very clear that they looked to this Court's\nstatements and expositions about the meaning of the Fifth\nAmendment to construe the claims the same.\nAnd as this Court said in Ohio v. Reiner, I\nthink 2 years ago, when a State court's interpretation of\nState law has been influenced by an accompanying\ninterpretation of Federal law, we may review. And in\nfact, if you think about it, think of almost every takings\ncase that you've decided since Williamson County. With\nthe exception of the Tahoe compact cases, they are all\nfrom State court decisions. Lucas, Palazzolo, First\nEnglish, Nolan and Dollan, Yee, Pennell, McDonald, San\nDiego, they are all --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Monterey -- Monterey Dunes was\nfrom the United States district court.\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes, because that was a case --\nthat's the other one that I was thinking of this morning.\nThat was a case that was filed in the district court and\nlitigated in the district court. And it raises a real\nanomaly about whether or not this case even really\npresents the question on which you granted review because\ntheir -- the theory that they have pursued in State court\nand at this round in Federal court is that there is a\ntakings violation under both the State and the Federal\nConstitution under the so-called substantially advances\nprong. Their complaints allege a Penn Central violation,\nbut their briefs in the lower court -- in the lower\nFederal courts in this proceeding and in the State courts\ndon't discuss Penn Central at all, as the California\nSupreme Court in footnote 14 of its opinion explained.\nSo if this is just a substantially advances\nclaim, it raises the question, number one, whether in the\ncontext of legislation, there is a substantially advances\nprong in the Fifth Amendment, a question that you're --\nyou're asked -- that you are presumably addressing in\nLingle v. Chevron. If there is, it raises the separate\nquestion posed by this Court's decision in Yee whether\nthat is a claim for compensation.\nIn other words, what this Court said in Yee is\nwhen you challenge, under the Fifth Amendment, legislation\non the grounds that it doesn't substantially advance a\nlegitimate government objective, this Court said, that's\nnot a claim for compensation. That is a claim that the\nordinance be struck down and not applied. And that's what\nthey're litigating here.\nNow, they have -- and so the question is if it's\nnot a claim for compensation, is it subject to Williamson\nCounty ripening? Why should you have to go to State\ncourt?\nSo there are a lot of this -- the Conference of\nState Chief Justices have filed an amicus brief in support\nactually of us in this case, saying we don't see that the\nfacts of this case present the question on which you\ngranted review. I think it's fairer to say it's not clear\nbecause the petitioners did challenge this ordinance not\nonly on its face, but as applied. And although the\ndistrict court below found that it wasn't a real as-\napplied challenge because they couldn't in any meaningful\nway distinguish themselves from the other 500 residential\nhotels in San Francisco, all of whom are concededly\nsubject to the hotel conversion ordinance. At least I\nsuppose in theory, there is some claim for compensation\nfor the temporary period in which they were subject to the\nhotel conversion ordinance.\nSo I -- I don't know. I -- you granted cert in\nthe case. We'd like to get the -- the question answered,\nbut I think the reason this long disquisition, Justice\nKennedy, about Del Monte Dunes is in Del Monte Dunes, it\nwas a substantially advance claim, and I think it was\nthought that there was no need to engage in Williamson\nCounty ripening.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let's take a -- may I -- may I,\nin effect, approach it with a simpler example, which --\nwhich is not this case, but I -- I just want to know how\n-- how the -- the systems work together.\nLet's assume that, in fact, a -- a Lucas kind of\nclaim had been involved, and the -- the State courts said\nwe understand Lucas. We're applying Lucas. And in point\nof fact, following the Lucas standard, there are plenty of\nuses that are still left on this land, so that there's no\ntaking under -- under Lucas. And let's assume that they\n-- they go through the State system. They lose. They\ndon't petition here for cert. Instead, they go into the\n-- the district court with a Fifth Amendment claim.\nIs it open to them in the district court to make\nthis argument? Don't apply issue preclusion to our Lucas\nclaim. The Lucas -- to -- to the -- to the\ndeterminations, the reasonable use determination in -- in\nLucas. Don't do it because although the State court\npurported to be applying Lucas, it really was not. It was\nnot following the Lucas standard. It was applying\nsomething much more favorable to the State. And\ntherefore, any determination on that issue should not get\npreclusion here. We ought to be able to litigate de novo\neven though, on the face of it, we seemed to have\nlitigated the Lucas issue and the State court decided it.\nCould they make that argument? And -- and if it were\nsound, would -- would preclusion principles give way?\nMR. WAXMAN: At most -- I mean, they could\ncertainly make the argument. At most, preclusion would\ngive way on the ultimate Lucas question, not all of the\nsubsidiary issues that were resolved en route to that\ndetermination, issues akin to the ones that we recited at\npages 10 and 11 of our brief. That is, if the district --\nif the State court finds, you know, that the property is\nin such and such a place and on such and such a year, this\nthing happened or that the ordinance, as it applied, had\nthis effect or that effect, there certainly would be no\npossible argument that issue preclusion wouldn't apply\nbecause they -- those were necessary determinations and\nthey had a full and fair opportunity to determine it.\nAs to the ultimate issue, this would be -- the\nFull Faith and Credit Act directs the Federal court to ask\nwhat would the law of California say about this. If they\ntried to then bring their Federal constitutional Lucas\ntheory in State court, would issue preclusion or claim\npreclusion principles bar a second bite at the litigation\napple? The answer ordinarily -- and you've asked me to\nassume that the tests that they have -- they purport to be\nstating the Federal standard. Ordinarily the answer would\nbe no if the argument simply is they made a mistake.\nI mean, that's -- that's what happens in issue\npreclusion. That's what in Allen v. McCurry and -- and\nall of the cases in which this Court has applied full\nfaith and credit, Kremer and -- and -- I'm forgetting the\nnames of the other cases. The argument was, yes, they\nthought they were adjudicating rights under the Fourth\nAmendment, but they were wrong, and issue preclusion\nshouldn't apply.\nI'm -- I'm qualifying my answer a little bit\nbecause I do think that if you came to Federal court and\nsaid, look, this was a sham or they -- they -- their\nanalysis was so skewed that it can't fairly be said that\nthey were really applying the Federal standard, something\nlike, you know, the -- the AEDPA standard now that -- that\nyou get review if it's an -- not just an incorrect\ndetermination, but a wholly unreasonable application of\nlaw or fact. Then I think you would look and see, well,\nwould a State court say, well, that's right. I mean, if\nyour allegation is that they were so far off the\nreservation that it really wasn't a determination of that\nissue, I think you get a new review. I mean, I do\nthink --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, was there an\nallegation --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I guess in the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- at any point here -- was\nthere an allegation at any point here that the State\nprocedures were inadequate to protect property rights?\nMR. WAXMAN: No, to the contrary. Not only --\nthere's no Pullman issue presented in this case, but the\nprocedural posture of this case demonstrates, if anything,\na full-throated appeal to the State courts. They --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's not so much that\nthere weren't appellate procedures, but that the procedures\nand the variance procedures and -- and a multiplicity of\nagencies here were just so complex that it amounted to an\n-- inadequate remedies to protect against a taking.\nMR. WAXMAN: There have been absolutely no such\nallegations made in this case. And I think a -- I think\nthat the San Remo would have to concede that although\nthere was a plethora of litigation in the State courts and\nin the lower Federal courts about the zoning\ndeterminations and whether a conditional use permit was or\nwasn't required, the -- the hotel conversion ordinance,\nthe ordinance that requires the payment of this in lieu\nfee, applies across the board to all residential hotels\nbased -- wherever they're located in the city, whether\nthey're in a historic district or not and whether they\nhave to be rezoned or not. It was a simple,\nstraightforward question about whether an ordinance that\nsays if you run a residential hotel or you have\nresidential rooms that you have certified as of the date\nthe ordinance was enacted and you want to change them\npermanently to full-time tourist use, you have to bring an\nequivalent number of units on line or you have to pay an\nin lieu fee to the city's building fund.\nAnd they made a challenge, like many people\nhave, that substantively that violates the Federal and\nState takings clause. That is a taking of private\nproperty without just compensation. But it applies to all\nthe residential hotels in the city wherever they're\nlocated, regardless of whether they need variances or --\nor anything like that.\nNow, in this case they went first to the\nSuperior Court in San Francisco and they filed an\nadministrative mandamus claim challenging the zoning\ndetermination that was made in their case because they're\nin a historic district. And at the same time, they went\nto the Federal court and they raised all of their takings\nclaims with respect to the ordinance and the zoning\nissues. They got a preliminary injunction in Federal\ncourt which was then -- but then lost a summary -- they\nhad summary judgment issued against them on all the\nsubstantive -- all the claims in their case.\nWhen they came to the Ninth Circuit, they asked\nthe Ninth Circuit to abstain under Pullman because they\nhad this municipal law question pending in the superior\ncourt. It had been pending for 5 years, and that might\nsomehow obviate or change the constitutional question.\nAnd they then went to -- they -- the -- the Ninth Circuit\nnoted that it was rather unusual for the plaintiff to be\ninvoking Pullman abstention and certainly to be doing so\nfor the first time on appeal after losing in the district\ncourt, but nonetheless, the Ninth Circuit said fine.\nAnd they then went to State court, and they\npressed not only their pending municipal law question, but\nthey also made their takings claims under Penn Central and\nunder the substantially advance prong both as applied and\nboth facial under the State constitution. And they\nreceived a full and fair hearing on those claims in the\nsuperior court, in the court of appeal where they won, and\nin the California Supreme Court where they ultimately lost\n4 to 3. There -- I don't believe there is any argument\nmade or available in this case that there was a denial of\na full and fair opportunity to litigate those issues as to\nwhich preclusion is required.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But they said there was no\nlitigation because it was just decided. They didn't plead\nenough to state a claim for relief.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, the -- the California Supreme\nCourt decision makes clear at page 113a of the petition\nappendix that it decided the takings claims, the\nsubstantially advance claims, on a demurrer and that they\ndecided it, therefore, based on the factual allegations of\nthe complaint, matters subject to judicial notice, of\nwhich there were many, and facts and circumstances that\nwere not disputed.\nI mean, it -- there's no such thing, I don't\nbelieve, as the resolution of a legal claim in which no\nissues are decided. There were plenty of issues decided\nin this case.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Decided but not litigated. I\nmean, the -- the problem is that -- that claim preclusion\nnormally assumes that the issue is, in fact, litigated.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And his -- he's arguing it was\nnot.\nMR. WAXMAN: The -- the issue of whether or not\nthe hotel -- whether or not the -- San Francisco's hotel\nconversion ordinance was reasonably related to the city's\nobjective was litigated with a vengeance. It was\nlitigated to the point of dozens, if not hundreds of pages\nin the State court.\nThe State court -- the State courts made a\nnumber of subsidiary findings leading to their conclusion\nthat, both on its face and as applied, the hotel\nconversion ordinance was reasonably related to the city's\nlegitimate objective of retaining low-cost rental housing\nfor the elderly, the disabled, and the poor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Tell me how that statement that\nyou just made, fully litigated, squares with the fact that\n-- I thought you said a moment ago it was decided on a\ndemurrer.\nMR. WAXMAN: It's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm -- I'm confused here.\nMR. WAXMAN: It's the application of law to\nfact. What the Court decided -- this Court said, I think\nin Yee --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you're -- you're saying\nthat the facts were -- were independently developed before\nthe demurrer was filed and granted?\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes. The -- the courts were asked\nto take judicial notice of a number of things. They --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So it was not decided simply on\npleadings.\nMR. WAXMAN: No.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. WAXMAN: I mean, what the court --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: A demurrer --\nMR. WAXMAN: I'm sorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: A demurrer is decided\non the pleadings, isn't it?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, it -- what the court said --\nand I think this is a -- what the California Supreme Court\nsaid at page -- I think it was page 113a and they also\nreiterate this point at page 139a, footnote 12 -- is this\nis a demurrer. So we take -- we accept as true the\nallegations of the complaint. Plus, we take judicial\nnotice of all the things that the parties asked us to take\nnotice of, which are matters of public record, of which\nthere were many, many, many in this case, including, for\nexample, the fact that every year from 1990 -- well, every\nyear from the -- from 1983 on, when they took over\noperation of this property, they filed with the city an\nannual report that listed that, A, the determination that\nall 62 of their rooms were for residential use and then\nexplained -- and then stated out the exact number of rooms\nby quarter that were, in fact, used by -- for long-term\nresidences and those that, during the summer months, were\nused for tourist use.\nThe court took judicial notice of that, as it\nwas appropriate, en route to its decision -- this is a\nsubsidiary issue I suppose -- that the conversion of this\nhotel to full-time tourist use would, in fact, cause a\nloss in the stock of available affordable housing. That\nwas an issue that was determined in this case. And the\nultimate question decided by the court was a mixed\nquestion. It was the application of law to fact, as this\nCourt explained, I think in Yee, is characteristic of\nsubstantially advances claims.\nThank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Waxman.\nMr. Utrecht, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL UTRECHT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. UTRECHT: Thank you, Your Honor.\nThere's no question that Williamson County\ncreates problems. The Ninth Circuit in this case did not\njust issue a Pullman abstention order the first time we\nwere there. They dismissed our as-applied claims as\nunripe. It dismissed our facial claim based on economic\nviability as unripe. So we're squarely within the context\ncontemplated by Williamson County; i.e., we proceeded in\nState court with our State compensation claim in order to\nripen the Federal claim.\nThe city acknowledges, as a result of that, that\nthere's no claim preclusion. And this Court's decision in\nMigra says that if there's a reason not to apply claim\npreclusion, there should also be a reason not to apply\nissue preclusion, that there should be an exception for\nboth or an exception for neither.\nIn this case, in addition to acknowledging an\nexception for claim preclusion, Mr. Waxman also\nacknowledged that if the State court was, as I -- my notes\nshow, so far off the reservation, the Federal court could\nrevisit the question. The problem, of course, with so far\noff the reservation is that might be a good test for this\nCourt to adopt, but if the city's position is correct,\nthis Court does not have that opportunity. This Court is\nstuck with whatever law the State imposes under issue\npreclusion. So this Court is not free, if the city is\ncorrect, to create some special exception.\nI think the only basis for finding a separate\nexception in this case is the one that this Court set out\nin England. I see no reason that it shouldn't be extended\nto this circumstance.\nUnless there are any questions, I have nothing\nfurther.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nUtrecht.\n"
