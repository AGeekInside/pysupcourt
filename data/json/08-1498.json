        "content": "(10:09 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear\nargument first this morning in Case 08-1498,\nHolder v. Humanitarian Law Project and the\ncross-petition.\nMr. Cole.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID D. COLE\nON BEHALF OF HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT, ET AL.\nMR. COLE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis as-applied challenge asks whether the\ngovernment can make it a crime for Ralph Fertig and the\nHumanitarian Law Project to speak in association with\nthe Kurdistan Workers Party. Specifically, they seek to\nadvocate for legal reform in Congress and the UN, to\nwrite and distribute articles supportive of Kurdish\nrights, to inform the Kurds of their international human\nrights and remedies, and to advise them on peaceful\nconflict resolution. It is undisputed that the\nKurdistan Workers Party engages in a wide range of\nlawful activities and that plaintiffs seek to support\nonly lawful ends.\nThe government has a concededly compelling\ninterest in combatting terrorism, yet it has not even\ntried to defend these prohibitions under strict\nscrutiny. Instead, it rests its entire case on the\nproposition that criminalizing plaintiffs' speech is a\nregulation of conduct, not speech, and therefore can be\nupheld under O'Brien.\nThat view is mistaken for two fundamental\nreasons. First, as this Court has already held, O'Brien\nis inapplicable where the government prohibits pure\nspeech --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. Cole, don't you\nagree that some of the speech could be regulated?\nMR. COLE: Some of my clients' speech?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Some of the speech of your\nclient.\nMR. COLE: I don't think -- I don't think\nany of it could be prohibited, Your Honor, unless the\ngovernment can satisfy the stringent scrutiny that this\nCourt applies when Congress seeks to prohibit pure\nspeech. So, no, I don't -- I --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You think all of the speech at\nissue is protected?\nMR. COLE: I think that certainly all of the\nspeech that I've just identified, which is the core --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You identified quite a\nbit.\nMR. COLE: Right. Yes. It's core -- and\nI think the reason, Your Honor, is it is core political\nspeech on issues of public concern. It is advocating\nonly lawful, peaceable activities. This Court has never\nupheld the criminal prohibition of lawful speech on\nissues of public concern.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, could the\ngovernment, I assume -- I assume you will say \"yes\" --\ncould the government forbid any NGO or other\norganization or person from giving tsunami aid to one of\nthese organizations, from giving them money?\nMR. COLE: I think money is different, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could they -- could the\ngovernment prohibit that?\nMR. COLE: I think money is different\nbecause it's -- it's conduct, not speech.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay. Let's assume the\ngovernment could prohibit that. Then the next question\nis: Could the government prohibit speech instructing\nthe terrorist organization how to get the tsunami aid?\nMR. COLE: Right. And I think -- - I think,\nYour Honor, that the answer is no, for the -- unless the\ngovernment can meet the higher standard of scrutiny that\napplies when you're regulating speech.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Brandenburg?\nMR. COLE: Well, I don't know whether it\nwould necessarily be Brandenburg. I think for -- in\norder to apply -- to decide this case, Your Honor,\nall the Court has to find is that when the speech\nadvocates solely lawful, peaceable activities of the\nsort advocated here, that's not sufficient. I think\nspecific -- we've suggested a specific intent standard,\nwhich is lower than Brandenburg, would be appropriate --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but if you get\ntsunami money, that frees up your other assets for\nterrorist money. So why can't the government forbid\nteaching how to get that money?\nMR. COLE: Well, again, Your Honor, that --\nif the government -- if the connection between the\nspeech and the government's concern were sufficiently\nclose, then maybe it could. But the problem --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why can't there\nbe --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Then what's the test?\nIs it -- you say it's not Brandenburg?\nMR. COLE: I think the test is whether the\n-- whether the speech -- when it's speech, I think the\ntest is whether the speech has been provided with\nspecific intent or knowledge that it will further\nunlawful, terrorist ends of the group.\nCHIEF JUSTICE: What if it goes --\nJUSTICE ALITO: And that applies --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if it goes to\nthe mere existence of a group? Let's say you have the\nNazi Party, and you are talking about advice or speech on\nsome purely mundane issue. The Nazis have a hospital,\nand you are giving them advice on how to run a\nhospital, but the government decides that anything that\nlegitimizes the Nazi Party, you know, promotes that\ngroup's terrorist activities. Can the government make\nthat kind of determination?\nI'm thinking of something like Regan v.\nWald --\nMR. COLE: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- where they say,\nlook, you can't travel to Cuba because we don't want to\ndo anything that legitimizes the regime.\nMR. COLE: Right. Well, two answers.\nDoes your question refer to the Nazi Party\ntoday or the Nazi Party during World War II?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I meant during\nWorld War II.\nMR. COLE: Okay.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm just trying to find\nan example that doesn't implicate the particulars of\nthe issue today.\nMR. COLE: Right, right. So I think -- the\nreason I ask, Your Honor, is that it may make a\ndifference if we are at war. The law of treason\nprohibits aid --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I didn't -- my\nhypothetical was confusing. I didn't mean to suggest we\nwere at war.\nMR. COLE: Okay.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I meant to hypothesize\na group that the government could reasonably determine\nshould not be supported in any way --\nMR. COLE: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- because it\nlegitimizes it. It's going to make their hospital run\nbetter. People are going to like their hospital. So\nthe party, the group, will be legitimized.\nMR. COLE: Right. Well, I think all the\nCourt held in Regan and Zemel was that it is permissible\nfor the government to regulate conduct -- not speech --\ntravel, and economic transactions, not speech. Those\nwere essentially O'Brien cases.\nAnd, in fact, in Regan the Court\ndistinguished a prohibition on travel to Cuba across the\nboard from a prohibition directed at a group, the\nCommunist Party, in the Kent and Aptheker cases, where\nthe Court held that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if you can't travel\nthere -- suppose you want to travel there so that you can\nmeet with and discuss lawful activities with people\nthere. If you can't get there, you can't speak.\nMR. COLE: That's right, Your Honor. But\nthat -- but that's essentially an O'Brien situation.\nThe prohibition is on a conduct, whether it's\ndraft card burning or travel. The individual who seeks\nto engage in that conduct says, I want to do it for\nspeech purposes. But the Court says the government has\na freer hand in regulating conduct than speech, and,\ntherefore, as long as you're regulating the\nnon-expressive element of the conduct, we'll apply\nO'Brien. But what this Court has said is that when --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could the government\nstop you from meeting anywhere with the terrorists?\nMR. COLE: From meeting? No, I don't think\n--\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just meeting, traveling\nto one of these countries to actually do your teaching\nto a terrorist -- let's say the law said you're\nprohibited from traveling to meet any of these\nindividuals. How would that be different than the Cuba\nsituation?\nMR. COLE: Well, then, if it's -- if it's\ntraveling for the purpose of association, then it would\nbe targeted at association, not at the conduct of\ntravel. The whole --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it's no different\nthan the Cuba situation.\nMR. COLE: No, but the whole point of the\nCuba -- the Cuba travel cases is that -- again, as this\nCourt said, it was an across-the-board ban. It did not\napply to different political groups. It applied to\nanyone who sought to travel to Cuba. And it was about\ntravel.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose it's a ban\njust for travel to meet with terrorist organizations,\nJustice Sotomayor's hypothetical.\nMR. COLE: Right. Well, then I think -- I\nthink that's -- that's different from this case, right,\nbecause this case -- suppose it's a ban on speech\nwherever it occurs.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But what about the -- what\nabout the hypothetical?\nMR. COLE: Right. Well, with respect to the\nhypothetical, I think the question, Your Honor, would be\nwhether the government's interest in banning that travel\nis unrelated to the associational or speech purposes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's what the Chief\nJustice says: In any context, support ultimately will\ninure to the benefit of a terrorist organization, and we\nhave a governmental interest in not allowing that.\nMR. COLE: There's no -- there's no dispute,\nYour Honor, that the government has a compelling interest\nin cutting off aid to terrorism. The question is whether\nit can do so by criminalizing pure speech.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it hasn't criminalized\nspeech. It has criminalized providing aid and\nassistance to these organizations. Most of that aid and\nassistance that is prohibited is not in the form of\nspeech, but it happens to include speech as well.\nMR. COLE: Right, but, Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think that's quite\ndifferent from a law that is directed explicitly at\nspeech.\nMR. COLE: Well, I don't -- I think it's not\nin this -- in this sense, Justice Scalia. Imagine a\nstatute that banned aid to overthrow the United States\nGovernment. And it had three provisions: One, you can't\nassassinate the president; two, you can't provide bombs and\nweapons to groups attempting to overthrow the government;\nthree, you can't advocate overthrow of the government.\nIf that were applied to someone for speaking in advocacy,\nwe wouldn't say it's a regulation of speech.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's not the right --\nthat's not the right number three. The right number\nthree is you cannot advise and assist an organization\nthat is seeking to overthrow the government. That's\nwhat is at issue here, not --\nMR. COLE: Well, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- not independently promoting\nthe objectives of these terrorist organizations. Your --\nyour clients are free to do that.\nMR. COLE: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But when they assist\nthe organization by providing advice, that's a different\nmatter.\nMR. COLE: Well, the government says if\nthey -- even if they speak in conjunction with the group,\nthey -- and they're providing a benefit to the government,\nthat's prohibited. So, for example --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. When they provide a\nbenefit, right?\nMR. COLE: So, for example, under that view,\nthe New York Times, the Washington Post, and the L.A. Times,\nall of which published op-eds by Hamas spokespersons --\nHamas is on the list -- thereby providing a benefit to\nHamas, working with the Hamas spokesperson, they're all\ncriminals. President Carter --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we -- we can cross\nthat bridge when we come to it.\nMR. COLE: But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This is an as-applied\nchallenge, and we are talking about the kind of advice\nand assistance that your clients want to give.\nMR. COLE: Right, and, Your Honor, there's\nno --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not a New York Times\neditorial.\nMR. COLE: Well, it is, though. It is, Your\nHonor. I mean, it's -- Ralph Fertig is not the New York\nTimes, and he's not President Carter, but it's the same\nsort of support, right? President Carter --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. No, no. I thought\nthat he was -- he wants to meet with the people. The\nNew York Times didn't meet with Hamas to tell them how\ngreat their editorial was.\nMR. COLE: No, but it's not about -- it's\nnot about whether you meet with them. It's about\nwhether you coordinate with them, and they've certainly\ncoordinated with the Hamas spokesperson in editing and\naccepting and then publishing his editorial. That is --\nthat would be providing a service. It would --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It depends on what\n\"coordinating\" means, doesn't it? And we can determine\nthat in the next case.\nMR. COLE: Well, let me -- let me also\nanswer it this way, Justice Scalia: If you look at the\nspecific speech which our clients seek to engage in, it\nincludes writing and distributing literature in\nconjunction with the Kurdistan Workers Party in the\nUnited States advocating their support. How is that\ndifferent from the New York Times?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Supposing that -- what you\nsay is you want to engage in political advocacy on\nbehalf of the Kurds. That's your words. All right.\nSuppose -- and these are two hypotheticals. Hypothetical\none, your clients, let's say, or some other people,\nknow that what the Kurds' hypothetical plan is, is to\npretend they're a political advocacy organization,\nbut to go around shooting the people who don't agree\nwith them. Okay? Case one, the hypothetical defendant\nknows it. In case two, he doesn't know it, but it's true.\nMR. COLE: Well, I think -- I think if\nyou -- if you specifically intend and know that your aid\nwill further the group in its terrorist activities, then\nit's not protected speech. But if you're -- if you\ndon't know that and you don't intend that, and in this\ncase --\nJUSTICE ALITO: And that goes for all forms of\ntraining? No form of training or expert assistance can\nbe prohibited unless the individual specifically intends\nto further -- that the training will be used to carry\nout terrorist activities?\nMR. COLE: Well, Justice Alito, this is an\nas-applied challenge. So the question simply is whether\ntraining in what international human rights consist of,\nin how to advocate for international human rights, and\nhow to advocate politically in Congress and other bodies.\nThat's the speech that's at issue here.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, just out of curiosity,\nI thought your position was that no form of training or\nassistance could be prohibited -- -\nMR. COLE: No, I was just --\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- consistent with the First\nAmendment. That's not your position?\nMR. COLE: No. I think -- I think, again,\nit depends upon the form of speech. There may be some forms\nof training that are so closely connected to the -- to\nthe end that Congress seeks to -- legitimately seeks to\nproscribe, like training in bombmaking or training in\nmilitary exercises.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The end that Congress seeks\nto proscribe is the existence of these terrorist\norganizations. And the theory of the legislation is\nthat when you aid any of their enterprises you're\naiding the organization. Hamas, for example, gained\nsupport among -- among the Palestinians by activities\nthat are perfectly lawful, perhaps running hospitals,\nall sorts of things.\nMR. COLE: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that is what fosters the\nterrorist organization and enables the terrorist\nactivities. Why isn't that a reasonable connection?\nAny assistance you provide to these organizations cannot\nbe separated from assistance to their terrorist\nactivities.\nMR. COLE: Right. Well, Your Honor,\nthat is precisely the argument that the United States\nmade to this Court in Scales. And here I'm quoting\nfrom the government's brief: \"Active membership can be\nproscribed even though the activity be expended along\nlines not otherwise illegal, since active support of any\nkind aids the organization in achieving its own illegal\npurposes.\"\nThat was with respect to an organization\nthat Congress spent 10 years studying, made findings\nthat it was an international conspiracy directed and\ncontrolled by the Soviet Union with the aim of\noverthrowing the United States by force and violence,\nusing terrorism. And, nonetheless, this Court in Scales\nheld you've got to distinguish between that aid and\nsupport and membership which is furthering the lawful\nactivities and that which is furthering the illegal\nactivities; otherwise you are penalizing the exercise of\nlawful speech. The Court said the same thing in De\nJonge.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Cole, as I remember,\nScales upheld a conviction, wasn't --\nMR. COLE: It did, Justice Ginsburg, but\nonly because it interpreted the statute to be -- to be\nlimited to specific -- to members -- active membership\nthat is specifically intended to further the illegal\nends of the group, precisely --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But it didn't -- it was not\na statute which involves banning financial or other tangible\nsupport, and page 17 of your brief made -- this is a\ndifficult case for me. And the second paragraph, page\n17, you say: \"The narrow focus of plaintiffs' claims in\nthis Court means that the case does not involve the\npropriety of banning financial or other tangible\nsupport.\"\nMR. COLE: Right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Then you say: \"Nor does it\ninvolve speech advocating or teaching criminal or violent\nactivity.\"\nBut it does involve speech, let's say arguendo,\nthat is tantamount to material support.\nMR. COLE: Well, I -- right, but --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the speech is\ntantamount to material support in that it legitimizes,\nencourages, or strengthens the organization.\nMR. COLE: Well, two things in response to\nthat, Justice Kennedy. First, that is what the United\nStates argued in Scales. And, again, the Court, not only\nin Scales but in a host of cases striking down\nCommunist Party statute, said you have to distinguish\nbetween aid that's intended to further lawful activity\nand aid that's intended to further illegal activity\nwhen it's in the form of protected activity --\nassociation, here speech and association.\nAnd, secondly --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In those cases, the real\nquestion was whether membership was enough, wasn't it?\nMR. COLE: Active membership --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. COLE: -- which the government says\nconstitutes more than mere nominal membership.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And this is support. It's\ndifferent.\nMR. COLE: Well, Your Honor, in De Jonge,\none of these cases, one of this Court's first First\nAmendment cases, the government argued that Mr. De Jonge\naided the Communist Party in its illegal ends by\nconducting a meeting for them and being their lead\nspeaker at the meeting. And this Court said: We've got\nto look at what he did, and what -- yes, he conducted the\nmeeting; yes, he was a member of the Communist Party;\nyes, he solicited people to join the Communist Party.\nBut what did he do? He advocated lawful peaceable\nactivities. And this Court said --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But there wasn't a statute\non the books that prohibited material support --\nMR. COLE: Well, I don't think it would --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And here there is, and this\nis in aid of that prohibition.\nMR. COLE: Right, but Your Honor, what would\n-- if Congress came along after the Communist Party cases\nand said, okay, you've said we can't make it a crime to\ncriminalize membership in the Communist Party; we are\nnow going to make it a crime to speak in conjunction\nwith the Communist Party -- do you think the\ndecisions would have come out any differently?\nI don't think so, because this Court has said that\nspeech is different from money, that it --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think it's very\nunrealistic to compare these terrorist organizations\nwith the Communist Party. Those cases involved\nphilosophy. The Communist Party was -- was -- was more\nthan a -- than an organization that -- that had some\nunlawful ends. It was also a philosophy of -- of -- of\nextreme socialism. And -- and many people subscribed to\nthat philosophy.\nI don't think that Hamas or any of these\nterrorist organizations represent such a philosophical\norganization.\nMR. COLE: Your Honor, this -- this Court\naccepted Congress's findings. Congress's findings were\nnot that this was a philosophical debating society, but\nthat it was an international criminal conspiracy\ndirected by our enemy to overthrow us through terrorism.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That may be, but people\njoined it for philosophical reasons.\nMR. COLE: Oh, sure --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They joined it for\nphilosophical reasons. These terrorist organizations\nhave very practical objectives. And the only reason for\njoining them or assisting them is to assist those\npractical objectives.\nMR. COLE: Well, I don't think that's -- I\ndon't think that's fair, Justice Scalia. The\nHumanitarian Law Project has no interest in furthering\nterrorism, but the Kurdistan Workers Party are the\nprincipal representatives of the -- of the Kurds in\nTurkey. They do have an interest in protecting the\nrights of the Kurds. They do have an interest in\nencouraging the Kurdistan Workers Party to -- to disavow\nviolence and engage in lawful peaceful means of\nresolving their disputes --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Cole --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Cole, would you\ndistinguish -- I think this came up in the court of\nappeals. There are a lot of groups on the list. I\nthink the Al-Qaeda was one instance that was mentioned,\nand, at least according to the briefs, you conceded that\nif you wanted to do just what you describe with respect\nto the Kurdish group or the Tamil group, the ban would\nbe permissible, if the group -- if the group were Al-Qaeda,\nand I'll throw in the Taliban.\nMR. COLE: Yes. We didn't actually concede\nthat, Your Honor. That's a misstatement on the part of\nthe government. If you look at the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, then -- then as --\nsuppose the group is not the two that we have here --\nMR. COLE: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- but Al-Qaeda and\nthe Taliban?\nMR. COLE: Right. What we said, for the\nrecord, is that it would pose a very different\nconstitutional question. And I think there are two\nreasons why it might pose a different constitutional\nquestion. One is -- and that was -- I'm picking up on my\nquestion back to Mr. Chief Justice, is it during wartime\nor not? And during wartime, Congress has broader powers\npursuant to the treason --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But I want to be sure I\nunderstand that point. You think the issue in this case\nwould be different if we were at war?\nMR. COLE: I think it might be different if\nwe were at war with these groups.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And if that's true, why\naren't we now at war, with regard to our opposition to\nthese organizations?\nMR. COLE: Well --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What is the difference,\nas a practical matter?\nMR. COLE: Well -- well, two things, Your\nHonor. With respect to -- it might be different if\nyou -- if you're talking about treason. Tokyo Rose,\nfor example, was engaged in speech, but she was doing so\nwith -- with the purpose of aiding the enemy and the\nspecific intent of betraying the United States. And\nthat's what's required. And what the Supreme Court has\nsaid is that the -- the aid has to be to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But my question that I\nwant to be sure you are focusing on --\nMR. COLE: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS -- but in the issues in this\nvery case --\nMR. COLE: Right.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- would they be different\nif we were now at war?\nMR. COLE: I think it would depend, Your\nHonor, because the -- what -- what treason requires is\naid to the enemy, and aid might be in the form of speech.\nBut it also requires a specific intent to betray the\nUnited States. And when you aid someone with whom we\nare at war, there is an -- there may well be an intent\nto betray the United States. There is no betrayal of\nthe United States here.\nAnd, number two --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, in a way there is.\nWhat about -- what about aiding organizations that are\nacting criminally, killing innocent civilians, with regard\nto one of our allies? And we're seeking to gain the\nassistance of these allies against those terrorists who\naim their terrorism at us, and yet --\nMR. COLE: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- we -- we are supposed to\nallow our citizens to assist the terrorist organizations\nthat are directing their violence against them?\nMR. COLE: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't that a\nsufficiently serious reason for the government to do\nwhat it's done here?\nMR. COLE: I think the question, Your Honor,\nis there -- is there any realistic nexus between writing\nan op-ed, advocating before Congress, urging a group to\nuse lawful nonviolent means to resolve its disputes, and\nkilling Americans? And there just isn't.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you've\npicked -- you've picked hypotheticals that are very easy\nfor you. What about personnel? Is there a connection\nbetween providing personnel that participate in legal\nactivity on behalf of a terrorist organization, and the\norganization can then say, well, because you are\nproviding this personnel, we can take them out and shift\nthem to bombmaking?\nMR. COLE: Right. And -- and -- and I guess\nmy answer to that would be it would depend upon whether\nthe -- the -- what is being prohibited is speech. If\nwhat is being prohibited is speech, I'm not sure that it\nwould be permissible for the government to say we're\ngoing to criminalize your speech, even though it's\nadvocating lawful activities, because --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, one of the\nthings that's being prohibited here that you challenge\nis providing personnel.\nMR. COLE: That's right. And -- and that's\nexactly what De Jonge was essentially charged with. And\nthe Communist Party was, again, found to be engaged in\ncriminal activity, to be a criminal syndicate,\nessentially, by the Oregon statute. The Court didn't\nquestion that. At that time it was illegal to even\nadvocate illegal activity.\nHe was charged with providing his person,\npersonnel, by conducting a meeting under the auspices of\nthe Communist Party and providing the lead speech there.\nAnd the Court said, even though the argument was --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, is your\nargument limited to personnel that engages in speech, or\ndoes it cover personnel that -- a nurse at one of the --\nif there are any, Hamas hospitals?\nMR. COLE: Right. Our argument, Your Honor,\nis -- again, this is an as-applied challenge with respect to\nthe particular speech that our clients seek to engage in,\nso it would not -- it would not require the Court to\ndecide whether any nonspeech assistance could be\nproscribed. In fact --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: When -- but the way you\ndefine the speech that you want protected is speech that\nis advocating some lawful activity.\nMR. COLE: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what's unlawful\nabout teaching people medicine and how to cure people\nfrom infection?\nMR. COLE: If -- if that were what they were\ndoing, Your Honor, if it was teaching, then it would be\nprotected by the First Amendment. But if -- I took\nChief Justice Roberts's question --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you see no\ndifference -- you're not advocating a difference in\nthis case between training that could reasonably be used\nin terrorist activities, because teaching people how to\ncare for the ill could be used to teach people how to\ncare for the wounded.\nMR. COLE: Right. Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right? And the\npolitical speech that your group is advocating, i.e.,\nthe petitioning -- you're not willing to draw a\ndistinction?\nMR. COLE: No, no. I --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You are saying to us the\ncase stands and falls on whether or not we accept that\nthis statute regulates conduct as opposed to speech?\nMR. COLE: No. Justice Sotomayor, what I'm\nsuggesting is, number one, the statute regulates speech.\nIt regulates speech because of what it conveys.\nTherefore, the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, it regulates\ntraining. And what -- the question I asked you --\nMR. COLE: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- was whether there was\na way in your challenge, or whether you are advocating\nany difference in the nature of the speech, that it's --\nthis is an as-applied challenge.\nMR. COLE: Yes. Exactly. And that's --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so the question --\nbecause the only answer you have given us is if it's\nlawful speech, it's protected.\nMR. COLE: No, I -- I think -- I think, Your\nHonor, that the answer -- maybe I wasn't clear in\nresponding to Justice Alito. But with respect to speech\nadvocating solely lawful activity of the type at issue\nhere, I think the connection between the government's --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So give me an analytical\nframework to address that question.\nMR. COLE: All right. Well, I --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The government says\nunder O'Brien even the speech that you want -- forget\nabout the tsunami aid speech. Let's just talk about the\npolitical petitioning speech, the petitioning for --\nMR. COLE: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there a difference\nand under what analytical framework would we reach it?\nMR. COLE: Well, I think the question -- the\nquestion at the -- at the -- at the bottom would be\nwhether there is a sufficient connection between the\nspeech which is being expressed and the government's\ncompelling interest. And if -- certainly there would be\nif it's -- meets Brandenburg. I think there might be if\nit is specifically intended or known that it will further\nterrorist activity. But where -- with respect to our\nspeech, there's really no realistic likelihood that the\nspeech that's being expressed here will further --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: We have to be conscious of\nthe white light. I have just one -- one question.\nThe old equity rule was that you don't\nenjoin a criminal statute; you wait until something\nhappens. And the reason is then we have specific facts.\nAnd if we said that here, you would say, oh, you're\nchilling speech.\nWhat's your best case in the precedents of\nthis Court for our entertaining an challenge that --\nthis is not really -- we usually talk about as-applied\nafter the fact. Coates, there was a conviction.\nMR. COLE: Right. Federal Election --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What's your -- what's your\nbest case?\nMR. COLE: Federal Election Commission v.\nWisconsin Right to Life was a pre-enforcement,\nas-applied challenge to the provisions of the BCRA.\nIf I could reserve the rest of my time.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you want to give an\nanswer to the Taliban and the Al-Qaeda?\nMR. COLE: Oh, I'm sorry -- I'm sorry,\nJustice Ginsburg. I thought I was, and maybe --\nbut the answer would be we are in a military conflict\nwith the Al-Qaeda and the Taliban. This Court has\nrecognized that. It's authorized by the authorization\nto use military force. Therefore, treason law might be\napplicable, number one.\nNumber two, it's not clear that the Al-Qaeda\nengages in any lawful activities at all, and the -- the\nprinciple this Court established with respect to the\nCommunist Party, a group that clearly engaged in illegal\nactivities of a very, very dangerous kind, but also\nengaged in lawful activities, is that that's -- that that\nthe group has to be a dual-purpose group. And here\nthere's absolutely no dispute that the Kurdistan\nWorkers Party and the LTTE engage in a wide variety of\nlawful activities and that all our clients seek to do\nis support those lawful activities. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Cole.\nGeneral Kagan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELENA KAGAN\nON BEHALF OF ERIC H. HOLDER, JR., ET AL.\nGENERAL KAGAN: With your permission,\nMr. Chief Justice. This may take some time.\n(Laughter.)\nGENERAL KAGAN: I'm sure it will on the\nother side, too.\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the\nCourt:\nThe material support statute is a vital\nweapon in this nation's continuing struggle against\ninternational terrorism. The statute prohibits, in\nterms that ordinary people can understand, the provision\nof material resources, material resources of all kinds,\nto foreign groups that engage in terrorist acts that\nthreaten the security of the United States or its\ncitizens.\nThe statute does not prohibit in any way\nPetitioners' independent advocacy. Petitioners can say\nor write whatever they wish about the PKK or the LTTE,\nand all their activities both legal and illegal. What\nPetitioners --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If a terrorist was\narrested in the United States from one of these groups,\nwould they be barred under the statute from serving as\ntheir attorney in a U.S. court?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Justice Sotomayor, if -- if\nthere are --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't that material\nsupport under the definition that you have been\nadvocating?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Justice Sotomayor, I believe\nthat that would be excluded from the statute -- should be\nexcluded from the statute, and indeed even Petitioners\nhave never suggested --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, but I'm asking you why.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Because I think that there\nthe canon of constitutional avoidance would clearly come\ninto play. If there is a criminal defendant, even a\ncivil defendant where there may be Sixth Amendment\nissues, where there may be due process issues, it\nwould --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so can I -- can I\nask you something? I mean, part of the First Amendment\nis the right for the -- to petition the government for\nredress of grievances. Putting aside all of the other\naid they are claiming, the tsunami aid, the training and\nother things, can the statute constitutionally be read\nto bar them from petitioning legitimate agencies,\nlegitimate government agencies, to peacefully, using the\nwords of the Constitution, to effect legal change?\nGENERAL KAGAN: It can --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And that -- that's part of\nwhat they're claiming their speech involves --\nGENERAL KAGAN: The statute --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- training and doing\nthat.\nGENERAL KAGAN: The statute cannot\nlegitimately be read to -- to include their independent\nadvocacy. But the statute, in fact, does not cover their\nindependent advocacy. Judge Fertig and all the rest of\nthe Petitioners can lobby Congress, can lobby\ninternational organizations --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that doesn't --\nGENERAL KAGAN: -- as they see fit.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- answer -- what is the\nright of the people peaceably to assemble? Now, mind\nyou, I understand this is the right of U.S. citizens in\nthe United States. But what in the First Amendment or\neven in this statute could justify Congress from barring\nindividuals to petition peacefully United -- world\nagencies or even U.S. agencies --\nGENERAL KAGAN: Again, the statute --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- for the recognition\nof a -- of a legitimate goal?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Again, the statute does not\nprohibit the Petitioners from petitioning peacefully.\nWhat the statute does is to prohibit Petitioners from\ngiving support to foreign terrorist organizations in\ntheir ability to petition international organizations.\nAnd that's a very different thing. It's a different\nthing for several reasons.\nFirst, remember that these are foreign\norganizations, and as several of you have suggested, the\nability of Congress and of the Executive Branch to\nregulate the relationships between Americans and foreign\ngovernments or foreign organization has long been\nacknowledged by this Court. It was acknowledged in\ncases like Regan and Zemel and others, not only with\nrespect to nations with which we are at war, but with\nrespect to foreign nations and other entities as well --\nforeign nationals.\nAnd in fact, the Petitioners' supposed First\nAmendment claims really are not speech claims at all.\nThey are all association claims. Petitioners can do\nwhatever independent advocacy they wish. What\nPetitioners cannot do is to provide support to a foreign\nterrorist organization. And there, indeed, the\ngovernment's position is that the Association Clause\ndoes not extend that far to give Americans, American\ncitizens, the ability to deal in whatever way they wish\nwith foreign nations --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it isn't--\nGENERAL KAGAN: -- or foreign organizations.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- whatever way they\nwish. They're making clear that it's only in\nconnection with lawful activity of the group, and indeed\nit's to train them in using lawful means to achieve\ntheir end.\nAnd I thought you went further than saying\nthere has to be strictly independent advocacy. You\nrecognized in your brief that they could meet with\nmembers of these terrorist organizations. They could\nmeet and communicate with them, but they can't\ncommunicate advice on how to pursue their goals through\nlawful means?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Justice Ginsburg, you're\nexactly right that, in addition to engaging in\nindependent advocacy, Petitioners can meet with members\nof the foreign terrorist organizations, can join the\nforeign terrorist organizations, that membership is not\nprohibited by the statute. What the statute does\nprohibit is active support of all kinds, both\nmaterial --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can they -- can they\nadvocate to the association? There are many kinds of\nadvocacy. You can advocate to the world that they are\nright. Can you advocate to the association that you\nshould change your ways, that you should use Lexis to\nfind international law precedents, et cetera?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Absolutely, Justice Kennedy.\nIf -- if Judge Fertig or the other Petitioners wanted to\nsay to these organizations, you should change your ways,\nnothing in the statute --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And suppose the\norganization's board of directors agrees with that and\nwants them to address the general membership on that\npoint, and they are doing it with the blessing of the\norganization.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Justice Kennedy, I want\nfirst -- I'm going to answer your question, and I'm\ngoing to say that that's still not covered, but I want\nalso to make a general point, which is that this Court\ncan exhaust all the hypotheticals that it has in this\ncase, and it will be irrelevant to the case at hand, and\nthat would be so for two reasons.\nFirst, because with respect to overbreadth,\nall of those uncertain or even unconstitutional\napplications will be but a thimbleful, compared to the\nocean full of completely legitimate applications of this\nstatute. And, second, because those hypotheticals have\nnothing to do with this case.\nMr. Cole said several times, I heard, this\nis an as-applied challenge, this is an as-applied\nchallenge. And to the extent that the Court thinks that\nthere are certain categories of activity that the\nstatute could not prohibit that would raise serious\nconstitutional concerns -- which I must say I -- I\ndisagree with, but there may be some. To the extent\nthat that's true, the Court can -- can put those off to\nanother day, another --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, wait. They want to\napply. They want to do --\nGENERAL KAGAN: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE BREYER: They say in this case that\nthey want to provide training in the issue of\nhumanitarian international law, and they want to provide\ntraining and expert advice and assistance in respect to\nhow you petition the UN.\nNow focusing on those two things, and going\nback to Justice Sotomayor's question, why -- what is the\ngovernment's interest in the following? Under O'Brien\nor any other test, you look at it and say, does teaching\nhave a First Amendment interest -- training? Yes. And\nwhat about teaching about advocacy? That's what they\nare doing, teaching about a certain kind of advocacy.\nYes. Therefore there is a First Amendment interest\nimplicated, seriously.\nNow, when that is seriously implicated,\nthere is also a government interest, on the other side,\nin not having terrorism. But there is a less\nrestrictive alternative which they suggest, that in that\nsituation, what they're entitled to read this statute as\nsaying is that, if they believe and a person reasonably\nwould believe that their teaching, assistance,\ntraining, would not significantly aid this organization\nin its unlawful ends, then they are not guilty.\nNow, what is the government's interest in\nnot accepting that interpretation? The First Amendment\nis hurt; there is an interest; but there is what they\ndescribe as -- and what I have narrowed -- a less\nrestrictive way of going about it. And they have to be\nreasonable in what they think. Now, what's the\nobjection to that?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Justice Breyer, I think the\nobjection is exactly what Justice Kennedy suggested with\nhis hypothetical, because his hypothetical is actually\nperfectly aligned with this case. You can't give\ntsunami aid, but the question is: Can you instruct\nthese organizations about how to get tsunami aid?\nAnd then these organizations get tsunami\naid, and they, in fact, use that aid in such a way that\nthey also have more money to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm sorry. I'm not\ntalking about tsunami aid. I am talking about the\ninstance where the teaching is itself teaching about how\nto do something, and that something is the kind of thing\nthat the First Amendment protects.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well, that something, which\nis the teaching the foreign terrorist organization how\nto petition international bodies in order to get various\nkinds of support, financial or otherwise, that will\nstrengthen those organizations in everything that they\ndo. What Congress decided --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fine, and if a reasonable\nperson would know that, that it's going to help them,\nthen it is unlawful, if it's going to help them and a\nreasonable person would think it was going to help them\nin their unlawful activities. But we're not --\nGENERAL KAGAN: Congress was the reasonable\nperson here. And Congress reasonably decided that when\nyou help a terrorist -- foreign terrorist organization's\nlegal activities, you're also helping the foreign\nterrorist organization's illegal activities.\nHezbollah builds bombs. Hezbollah also\nbuilds homes. What Congress decided was when you help\nHezbollah build homes, you are also helping Hezbollah\nbuild bombs. That's the entire theory behind this\nstatute, and it's a reasonable theory for exactly the\nkinds of reasons that Justice Kennedy was suggesting by\nthat hypothetical.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And doesn't that lead to --\nkind of logically lead to the conclusion that mere\nmembership could be prohibited? Could you explain how\nsomeone could be a member of one of these organizations\nwithout providing a service to the organization? Simply\nby lending one's name as a member -- that might be\nregarded as a service. If you attended a meeting and\nyou helped to arrange the chairs in advance or clean up\nafterwards, you'd be providing a service to the\norganization.\nGENERAL KAGAN: I -- I actually don't\nthink -- I mean, Congress clearly did not mean to\ninclude that. And I think that the normal words that\nCongress used make that pretty clear. When you think\nabout personnel, when you think about training, when you\nthink about expert advice and assistance, even when you\nthink about service, you -- the notion that I am serving\na terrorist organization simply by the act of membership\nI think would not be correct. And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you say Congress\nclearly did not intend that? You know, I would have\nguessed that you are providing a service or personnel\nwhen you make yourself a member of the organization.\nWhy do you say Congress clearly did not intend it?\nGENERAL KAGAN: That is certainly not the\nway the government reads the statute, and that's not the\nway the government has ever read the statute. And,\nindeed, the government, as we discussed in our brief,\nbelieves that there are certain kinds of joint\nactivities that would be allowed by the statute.\nNow, that's not to say that Congress could\nnot have gone farther. In this specific context, where\none is regulating dealings with a foreign organization,\nit's possible that Congress could have gone further.\nBut we understand the statute and -- and I think there's\na -- I think, quite reasonably, as providing only\nmaterial support, a true service, something that will\nhelp the foreign organization in whatever it does.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, but petitioning the\nUnited Nations -- and that's what you are teaching them\n-- does not, on its face, seem to me to be something\nthat reasonably you would think was going to aid them in\ntheir unlawful objectives, but for the realm of ideas.\nNow --\nGENERAL KAGAN: This would be --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and then Congress put a\nthing in here which says: Don't construe this statute\nin a way that will abridge First Amendment rights. So\nit's aware of the problem of First Amendment rights.\nGENERAL KAGAN: And I think you are exactly\nright about that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And is there any evidence that\nsomething like that would, in fact, but for the realm of\nideas, help this organization commit its terrorist acts?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Justice Breyer, I believe\nthat the legislative record is quite clear that Congress\nthought that various kinds of aid given to the legal and\nlegitimate activities of the terrorist organization, in\nfact, further the aims of the -- in fact, further the\nillegal and illegitimate goals.\nCongress made findings about the fungibility\nof these resources. Congress said over and over that\nthese organizations have no firewalls, no organizational\nfirewalls --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- but you --\nGENERAL KAGAN: -- no financial firewalls.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You say that the -- not\nonly the membership, but they can meet and they can\ndiscuss. And I don't understand the line between\nmeeting with these terrorist organizations, discussing\nthings with them, and instructing them on how they can\npursue their goals through lawful means.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Justice Ginsburg, I agree\nwith you that there may be some hard cases that are at\nthe borderline between the two, as there are in most\nstatutes; that there may be hard cases. This is not one\nof them.\nAnd I think it would -- it's very\ninstructive for the Court -- I'm sure you've all done\nthis -- but to actually go back and look at the\nPetitioners' complaints in this case and look at Judge\nFertig's declarations in this case, because what they\nshow is the extensiveness of the activities that they --\nof the services that they wish to offer to these foreign\nterrorist organizations and the value that those\nservices are going to give those foreign terrorist\norganizations.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: General, you've\ntalked about -- there has been a lot of discussion about\nthe legitimate activities allowing -- facilitating\nillegitimate activities by freeing up personnel and all\nthat, and legitimizing the group.\nIs that an argument you've made before this\nCourt or below? I looked at your briefs, and I thought\nit's almost all about: This is O'Brien, this is\nconduct, this is not speech. I didn't see the argument\nthat we've spent a lot of time talking about, which is\nthe legitimate activities allow the illegitimate\nactivities to take place.\nGENERAL KAGAN: No, I believe we -- we have,\nMr. Chief Justice, although if we didn't emphasize it\nenough, I -- I will plead error, because I think that it\nis an -- a crucial point to this case. But I think in\nthe part of our brief --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have -- I\ndon't mean to -- do you have particular references to\nwhere in your brief you made the argument?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Yes. In the part of our\nbrief where we discuss the application of the O'Brien\nstandard, and we say what are the governmental interests\nthere.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, I know. It seems\nto me your case is all about O'Brien. I'm not sure you have\nan answer to whether or not strict scrutiny is\nsatisfied. If we disagree with you and think that some\nof this activity is speech, I don't see the argument\nthat you've presented on strict scrutiny.\nGENERAL KAGAN: I think that that's right,\nMr. Chief Justice, that we have not specifically\naddressed the strict scrutiny argument. I think this\nwould pass a strict scrutiny standard, but I actually\nthink that to the extent that the Court thought a strict\nscrutiny standard were appropriate, a remand might be in\norder, that no Court has ever actually gone off on that\nground, that --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why is O'Brien the correct\nstandard? How can you argue that training and providing\nadvice is not speech?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Justice Alito, I think that\nthe -- the training and advice clauses are, of course,\npart of a statute which regulates material support and\nresources of all kinds, and to the extent that what\nyou're saying is, you know, training and advice, those\nare always speech restrictions if you find them in a\nstatute, I think that that's not right.\nI mean, if you think about the range of\nthings that training can involve: Training how to\nbuild a bomb, training how to fly a plane, training how\nto use sophisticated communications equipment, and\ntraining how to engage --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How about training to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What's involved\nhere -- I think they said that they want to train them\nhow to do lawful things, how to pursue their goals in a\nlawful, rather than a terrorist, way. And that is\nspeech. It is not conduct. They want to engage in\nadvocacy of peaceful means of achieving the goals of\nthese groups.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Congress, of course, allowed\nthem to engage in all the advocacy that they wish on\nbehalf of these groups. Indeed, Congress did not\nprohibit --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But they want to\ncommunicate, and you say they can communicate. And I\nstill am having trouble with the line of what they can\ncommunicate and what they can't.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well, I think if they are\nengaged in just discussion of ideas, this statute does\nnot prohibit that. What the statute prohibits is the\nprovision of actual support, services to the\norganizations that the organization can use in its\nactivities, both legal and illegal.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you stick with the\nargument made below that it's unlawful to file an amicus\nbrief?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Justice Kennedy --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I think I'm right in\nsaying it that that was the argument below.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Yes, I think that would\nbe a service. In other words, not an amicus brief just\nto make sure that we understand each other. The\nPetitioners can file amicus briefs in a case that might\ninvolve the PKK or the LTTE for themselves, but to the\nextent that a lawyer drafts an amicus brief for the PKK\nor for the LTTE, that that's the amicus party, then that\nindeed would be prohibited. That's the kind of\nservice that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Then it seems to me that\nyour opponent's argument here today is prohibited.\nGENERAL KAGAN: No, no, no, because\nPetitioners here are arguing for themselves. What I'm\nsuggesting is Petitioners can do all the advocacy they\nwant, can engage in courts in any way they wish. The\nonly thing that's prohibited is if the PKK hired a\nlawyer to write an amicus brief on its behalf. At that\npoint --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General, I understand,\nI could be wrong, that many petitioners or respondents\ngo out to the industry and say we need some amicus\nbriefs, and they flood in from all sides. Would that be\nillegal? Because the -- the organization --\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well, if the PKK --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- came out and said we\nneed a brief -- amicus briefs from law professors?\nFrom --\nGENERAL KAGAN: If -- if the PKK or the LTTE\nor Al-Qaeda or any of the other organizations on this\nlist said we want amicus briefs, and somebody provided\nan amicus brief --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Without pay.\nGENERAL KAGAN: -- for themselves -- for\nthemselves, there would be no problem. The only problem\nis if somebody drafted an amicus brief --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How can we can ever\nseparate --\nGENERAL KAGAN: -- for the PKK itself.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Under the definition of\nthis statute, teaching these members to play the\nharmonica would be unlawful. You are teaching --\ntraining them in a lawful -- in a specialized activity.\nSo how do we -- there has to be something more than\nmerely a congressional finding that any training is bad.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well, I think here we have\nthe congressional definition of what kind of training\nis bad, and that definition focuses on training in\nspecialized activities. Now, you say, well, maybe\ntraining a -- playing a harmonica is a specialized\nactivity. I think the first thing I would say is there\nare not a whole lot of people going around trying to\nteach Al-Qaeda how to play harmonicas.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, Mohammed Atta and his\nharmonica quartet might tour the country and make a lot\nof money. Right?\nGENERAL KAGAN: I'm sorry. I --\n(Laughter.)\nGENERAL KAGAN: But I don't mean to make fun\nof the hypothetical at all, Justice Sotomayor, because I\nthink you're raising an important point, but it's\nreally a point that goes to how to sensibly read a\nstatute. What Congress did, when in response to some\nlower court decisions, it further clarified and defined\nthe word \"training\" and the word \"expert advice and\nassistance,\" I have to say I think that Congress's own\nresponses here -- I mean, they -- Congress was both\nresponsive and responsible, that it really took into\naccount court decisions and tried to go back to the\nstatute and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, in that -- on the --\njust forget the harmonica for a second; I'm more worried\nabout the lawyer. You're saying that a -- a group abroad\nwhich may have some American citizens in it -- let's assume\nthey do -- want to hire a lawyer. And this lawyer is supposed\nto file some amicus briefs and do other activities. You're\nsaying Congress has forbidden that in this statute,\nand that's constitutional?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well, first of all,\nJustice Breyer, I want to sort of repeat the -- what I\n-- what I said about the need to find a substantial amount\nof uncertain or unconstitutional applications, or with\nrespect to any kind of facial challenge or with respect\nto this challenge --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I want to know if that's\nwhat you're saying, what I just said: that an\norganization has American citizens, engages in\nterrible stuff, but they are not entitled under the\nConstitution to have a lawyer in the United States who\ndoes legal work like filing amicus briefs.\nGENERAL KAGAN: To the extent that there is\nany constitutional claim that they would be entitled to\nrepresentation, whether it's a Sixth Amendment claim or\na due process claim that might exist in criminal cases,\nthat might exist in habeas cases, that might exist in\ncivil cases, then the government believes that the\nstatute should be read so as not to include that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why do these hypotheticals\nmake any difference? This is an as-applied challenge.\nWe should look to the activities that this organization\nwants to conduct, unless -- unless you think that there\nis an overbreadth problem. And that seems to me -- I'm\nnot even sure that the Petitioners assert that here.\nClearly, the -- the broad scope of this\nstatute is -- is constitutional, and whatever aspects of\nspeech it may run afoul of are -- are minimal. That\nbeing the case, of what relevance are these\nhypotheticals? It's a lot of fun, and it's very\ninteresting, but we can deal with all of that when the\nsituations arise, can't we?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well, I -- I do think that\nthe answer to that is yes, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The answer on the other\nside is: All we want to do is speak about lawful\nactivities. We're not supplying any guns, any\ncommunication equipment. We just want to speak about\nlawful activities.\nAnd I go back to my failure to understand your\nline between, yes, you can communicate with these\npeople, but you can't communicate about going about\ntheir aims through peaceful means.\nGENERAL KAGAN: No, I think my line is you\ncan communicate, but you can't provide material support.\nYou can't make a donation, whether it's tangible or\nintangible.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. You can\ncommunicate on -- I don't mean to interrupt. But you\ncan communicate on your own, but you can't communicate\nwith them?\nGENERAL KAGAN: No --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, okay.\nGENERAL KAGAN: -- you can communicate with --\non your own, for sure. Independent advocacy of all kinds\nis not touched by this statute. In addition to that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But Justice Ginsburg's\nquestion is: Can you advocate peaceful means? And let's\nassume that if they embrace peaceful means, they get\nmore interest in their organization, the organization\nbecomes stronger for all purposes. Can you do that?\nThat was Justice Ginsburg's question.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Can you say to an\norganization: Look, you guys really should lay down your\narms. And two things --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And here's how to do it.\nAnd here's how to go to the U.N., and here's how to\napply for aid, and here's how to file an amicus brief.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well, now you can't,\nbecause when you tell people here's how to apply for\naid and here's how to represent yourself within\ninternational organizations or within the U.S. Congress,\nyou've given them an extremely valuable skill that they\ncan use for all kinds of purposes, legal or illegal.\nAnd it's not sufficient for the Petitioners --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So you can -- you can\ncommunicate, but the communications are censored. That's\n-- you said you can meet with -- you can be a member, you\ncan attend meetings, you can discuss things, but there\nare only -- there's a certain point at which the discussion\nmust stop, right?\nGENERAL KAGAN: The discussion must stop\nwhen you -- when you go over the line into giving\nvaluable advice, training, support to these\norganizations. At that point --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask a sort of basic\nquestion that I've had trouble with throughout the\nwhole argument? We're talking about whether this is an\nas-applied challenge or on its face. And what the\ndistrict judge did was hold part of the statute\nunconstitutional as being too vague: the words \"training\"\nand \"advice,\" et cetera. Why isn't that a facial\ndecision?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well, the -- both the\nlower courts -- I think the district court and the\ncourt of appeals, I think, had a kind of confused analysis\nhere, which is that they said, well, it's vague as applied.\nThe court of appeals specifically said it's not vague\non its face, and there is no facial vagueness claim here,\nand yet they appeared to incorporate aspects of overbreadth\nanalysis into their as-applied claim. I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Unless you're in an\noverbreadth situation, a vagueness challenge can be an\nas-applied challenge. A statute can be vague as applied\nto certain conduct, although the core conduct that it\ncovers is clearly covered.\nGENERAL KAGAN: No, that's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We have cases like that.\nGENERAL KAGAN: That's exactly right,\nJustice Scalia, and -- and -- and with respect to the\nas-applied vagueness claim, the government's position is\nthere's -- there's -- there -- it's not vague, because\nyou can go through these declarations, you can go\nthrough these complaints, and you can know exactly what's\nincluded within --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but I have the\nsame --\nGENERAL KAGAN: -- the statute and what's\nnot.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I had the same question as\nJustice Stevens. It's a very odd as-applied challenge\nbecause there hasn't been a prosecution. And vagueness\nas applied, I think as Professor Cole can answer, is, it\nseems to me, if, you know, that it applies, it isn't vague.\nI don't understand that, but --\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well, it --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I can't -- I can't\nthink of a case in which the Court, pre-prosecution in a\ndeclaratory judgment, has said that it's improper as\napplied to certain things. Or maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I\nam missing some case.\nGENERAL KAGAN: No, I -- I -- I don't think\nyou are wrong, Justice Kennedy, and especially with\nrespect to a case where all the activity is -- clearly\nfits in one box or the other. In other words, you can\ngo through the complaints, you can go through the\ndeclarations, and know exactly what is covered and what's\nnot covered. All the independent --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that's -- I'm\nnot -- I'm not sure that's right. I mean, expert advice or\nassistance -- I don't know sitting down that I could tell,\nyou know, how to advocate for peaceful, you know,\nresolution or whatever. Is that expert advice? Is that\nspecialized knowledge? And I understand training,\nservice, personnel, but that one's a little hard to --\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well, as I said,\nMr. Chief Justice, there will be some hard cases, there\nalways are when it comes to applying statutes. The\nquestion is never are there hard cases.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, my -- my point\nis that this --\nGENERAL KAGAN: The question is the\nindeterminacy.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. My point is that\neven knowing what they intend to do, it's kind of hard\nto decide whether that's based on specialized knowledge\nor not.\nGENERAL KAGAN: I think it -- it actually is\npretty clear in this case. If you read the declarations,\nif you read the complaints, the expertise of these\nparties actually shines through. Judge Fertig is proud\nof his expertise, justifiably so. He has --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Does this -- what --\nwhat these plaintiffs are seeking to do -- does it have\nany resemblance to the 150 prosecutions that you have\nbrought under this Act? It was my understanding that\nthose were for supplying weapons, supplying other\nequipment. Are there any prosecutions that are -- that\naim at training to pursue the organization's aims\nthrough peaceful means?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Justice Ginsburg, I think\nthat this is not the typical case. This is, of course,\na case that might never have reached this Court, except\nthat it was brought as a declaratory judgment action.\nFor the most part, what the government prosecutes are\ncases which involve a wide variety of support to foreign\nterrorist organizations.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Specifically, does this\nparticular man have to be prosecuted?\nGENERAL KAGAN: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is this particular\nindividual in risk of being prosecuted if he makes the\nspeech to the United Nations?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Justice Stevens, I do\nbelieve that this individual can make whatever speeches\nhe wants at the United Nations. To the extent that he\nis acting as a representative or as an agent of the PKK,\nhe does fall within the contours of the statute. That's\na different thing.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And is there evidence that\nhe would be prosecuted if he --\nGENERAL KAGAN: Of course, that's a\ndifferent thing as to how prosecutorial judgment is used\nto decide which are the high-priority cases and which\nare the low-priority cases.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But in essence, this is an\naction to enjoin a potential prosecution against\nsomebody for making a potential speech? That's really\nwhat we are fighting about, I think.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Again, the government did\nnot bring this action. Judge Fertig and the Petitioners\nbrought this action to try to get a declaratory\njudgment. As applied to them, the statute indeed\ncovers their various efforts or proposed activities of\nbeing an agent of, of representing the PKK and the LTTE,\nthat falls within the statute and I think makes the\nas-applied claim here not vague at all.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\nMr. Cole, we'll give you 5 minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID D. COLE\nON BEHALF OF HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT, ET AL.\nMR. COLE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI want to start by addressing the question\nof strict scrutiny. The -- the -- Justice Kennedy, you\nasked, and a number of the Justices asked, doesn't it\nmake a difference that what they've done is prohibited a\nwide range of conduct and just some of that is speech?\nWell, that's precisely an accurate\ndescription of the breach of the peace statute in Cohen\nv. California. It forbade breaches of peace through\nloud noises, through horse racing in the streets,\nthrough any kind of offensive conduct. But when\nCalifornia applied that statute to the words on Mr.\nCohen's jacket and then argued because we are not\ninterested in the words on his jacket, we are interested\nin preserving the peace, however it's breached, O'Brien\nshould apply, the Court said no. We deal here with the\nconviction resting solely upon speech, not upon any\nseparately identifiable conduct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I agree. And that\nwas as applied to a conviction.\nMR. COLE: That's right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I just haven't seen an\nas-applied challenge on declaratory relief. The\ngovernment doesn't seem to object to that procedure.\nMR. COLE: No. Well, the government doesn't\nobject because there are actually many cases, and FEC v.\nWisconsin Right to Life is only the most recent. But,\nagain, the notion is somebody who is told you can meet\nwith a group, you can discuss with a group -- in fact,\nthe House report says that you are free to speak with\nand on behalf of a designated group.\nBut then you have a statute that says, if\nyou advocate in any coordinated way, if you tell them\nanything that's derived from specialized knowledge, if\nyou tell them anything of specific skill, you're --\nyou're engaged in a crime and you could go to jail for\n15 years.\nThat's why the Humanitarian Law Project came\nto me. They said: We've been doing this kind of\nlawful activity. We think it's our right, but we're\nnot going to risk going to jail for 15 years to do\nit.\nThe government has spent a decade arguing\nthat our clients cannot advocate for peace, cannot\ninform about international human rights.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If O'Brien applies, what\nremains of your case?\nMR. COLE: If O'Brien applies, then I think\nthe Court would still be applying the scrutiny that\nasks, is there a reasonable fit -- is there a reasonable\nfit between the specific speech that's at issue here,\nspeech on issues of public concern, advocating only\nlawful activity, and the -- and that the government\nlegitimately seeks to further, which is stopping support\nfor terrorism? Now --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That analysis of the\nactivities that you are proposing has not been done by\nthe lower courts, correct?\nMR. COLE: Well, the lower courts struck --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They -- they haven't --\nthey struck it on vagueness grounds, but none --\nMR. COLE: Right. The --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- none of the courts\neither subjected this to strict scrutiny or the\nreasonable fit --\nMR. COLE: No, and, in fact, the government\nhas never even attempted to defend the statute under strict\nscrutiny, because I think it clearly could not satisfy\nstrict scrutiny. And under this -- under Cohen, strict\nscrutiny is what must be applied here.\nIn addition --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why don't -- why\ndon't we remand it to the lower courts to apply strict\nscrutiny if we agree with you that O'Brien doesn't apply\nhere?\nMR. COLE: I think it would be appropriate\nto remand for -- for application of strict scrutiny if\nyou read it that O'Brien doesn't apply.\nO'Brien also doesn't apply if the statute is\nnot content neutral. This is a statute that doesn't bar\nall aid; it doesn't even bar all speech. It permits\nunlimited provision of religious materials, even if they\nadvocate jihad, but proscribes any secular material, even\nif they are advocating peace.\nSo -- so there are -- the -- the lower\ncourt, again, found that the statute was vague, that our\nclients were reasonably chilled, that they had a right\nto engage in this activity. I think you can reach that\nresult either through vagueness, or you can reach it by\napplying strict scrutiny, or I think because the fit is\nso poor here, and because -- and the vagueness, in fact,\nundermines the fit, because people are chilled from\nengaging even in speech that the government doesn't want\nto prohibit.\nAll right, if I am told you -- you -- you'll\ngo to jail if you tell them anything that's derived from\nspecial --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Cole, there were\ncongressional findings that money is fungible first for\nterrorist groups, like -- that if you give them money for\nlegitimate means, that it's going to be siphoned off and\nused for illegitimate means.\nMR. COLE: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, why isn't that enough,\neither under strict scrutiny or a lesser standard,\nreasonable fit standard, to say that you can't teach\nthese groups how to get money?\nMR. COLE: Right. Well, one -- well, we're not\n-- we're not teaching them how to get money. We're seeking\nto teach them how to advocate for lawful human rights\nor --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, one of your -- one\nof your stated aims, at least of one of the groups is to\nteach them how to get aid for tsunami relief.\nMR. COLE: Right. That -- that claim has\nbeen mooted because the LTTE is no longer -- has no role\nin Sri Lanka. So what's left is solely -- has nothing\nto do with money.\nSecondly, Congress only made a finding about\nmoney. At the same time that it made a finding that\nmoney is fungible, it said this is a statute -- and\nthis is from the House report -- only affects one's\ncontribution of financial and material resources and\ndoes not prohibit speaking in concert with and on behalf\nof designated groups.\nWell, that suggests that Congress thought\nthat what our clients want to do is -- should be protected.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. COLE: And we have suggested that you should,\ntherefore, interpret the statute in -- consistent with\nthat. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
