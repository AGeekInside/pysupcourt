        "content": "(11:06 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear\nargument next in Kennedy v. Plan Administrator for\nDuPont Savings and Investment Plan. Mr. Furlow.\nI'm sorry. We won't.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's still early in\nthe term.\nCase 07-542, Arizona v. Gant. Mr. Maziarz.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you have any views on\nthe other case?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MAZIARZ: None whatsoever, Your Honor.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH T. MAZIARZ\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. MAZIARZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nMore than 27 years ago in Belton this Court\napplied its prior decisions in Chimel and Robinson to\nthe arrest of a recent occupant of an automobile. The\nCourt sought to forge a workable straightforward rule\nthat could be easily applied and predictably enforced by\nlaw enforcement officers in the field in this dangerous\nand dynamic situation.\nAfter careful consideration, this Court held\nthat the passenger compartment of the vehicle was deemed\nto be under the immediate control of the arrestee. The\nCourt also made clear that the search need only be a\ncontemporaneous incident of the arrest.\nThere are three reasons, all\nwell-established by this Court's case law, why officers,\nlaw enforcement officers, need not demonstrate a threat\nto their safety or need to preserve evidence prior to\nsearching an automobile incident to arrest, even if all\nof the recent occupants of the vehicle have been\narrested and secured.\nFirst, neither justification need exist in a\nparticular case. This Court has made clear in Robinson\nthat a search incident to arrest requires no additional\njustification. It's the fact of arrest that justifies\nthe search.\nSecond, the search need only be a\ncontemporaneous incident of the arrest or substantially\ncontemporaneous with the arrest. Obviously a search can\nbe contemporaneous even if the arrestee has been\nsecured.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But not if it occurred in\nthe station house, right, if the -- if the arrestee had\nbeen taken into the station house?\nMR. MAZIARZ: Correct. That would be remote\nin time and location, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Or location.\nMR. MAZIARZ: Time and location, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, why isn't this\nsituation more like the station house than it is like --\nthe Belton situation is the police apprehend the -- a\ndriver. They are concerned about weapons, about being\nassaulted. But here we have someone who is locked up\ninside a police car, handcuffed, can't go anywhere.\nThat sounds to me more like the station house than it\ndoes the urgent situation where the police have a\nlegitimate concern for their own safety.\nMR. MAZIARZ: The arrestee is still at the\nsame location at the scene of the arrest. It's not\nremote in place or time because it -- it -- the arrest\nand the search occur in a short period of time at the\nscene of the -- of the arrest. And while he -- the\narrestee is secured to one degree or another, in Belton\nthis Court wanted a workable, straightforward rule that\nofficers could apply across the board and not have to\nlook at particular facts and circumstances. So --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And this is important, but\nyou had three -- three points. One was the fact of the\narrest; and, two, it must be contemporaneous. And the\nthird?\nMR. MAZIARZ: The third is requiring a\njustification is anathema to a bright-line rule. And\nthat is precisely what this Court wanted in Belton, was\na rule that law-enforcement officers would know how to\napply from one case to another, that wouldn't vary based\nupon the particular facts of the arrest.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, we do have a -- we do\nobviously require a justification for the bright-line\nrule itself. And -- and the problem that this case\nraises, I think, if anything more acutely than any of\nthe others that we've had recently, is that it seems if\n-- if your position is -- is going to be accepted, to\ndivorce the search totally from the justification for\nthe Chimel rule.\nAnd -- and at some point we've either got to\nsay, all right, it's no longer a Chimel rule, there's\nsome other justification for the bright-line rule; or\nwe've got to say, to purport to apply the Chimel rule in\na case like this, handcuffed in the back of the police\ncar and so on, is -- is to turn the law into nonsense.\nAnd -- and I -- I think we've got that\nchoice in front of us. Do we have a new and different\nrule, or do we apply Chimel and say, you just can't go\nthis far. This is like the station house.\nMR. MAZIARZ: I think in Belton this Court\ndid apply Chimel and simply said, in this recurring\nsituation we need a bright-line rule that can be easily\ndetermined and enforced by officers --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the bright line\nswallows up the rationale in this hypothetical where\nalready he's handcuffed; he is in the car. Is there a\njustification apart from Chimel for our keeping this\nbright-line rule?\nMR. MAZIARZ: The fact that officers have\nfor 27 years applied it; it's a workable rule.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's not a long time.\nWhat -- what was the situation when the Fourth Amendment\nwas adopted? Do you know? If you stopped Thomas\nJefferson's carriage to arrest Thomas Jefferson and you\npulled him off to the side of the road, could you --\ncould you then go and search his carriage?\nI'm struck by the fact that there is no\neffort in your brief whatever to take this thing back\nany more than 27 years. Now, you know, it could -- it\ncould well be that it has always been considered\nreasonable to search the person and to search the\nconveyance from which the person has been taken.\nIf that's the case, I could say, gee, it's\nalways been considered reasonable, end of case. But --\nbut you -- you give me nothing to hang my hat on.\nMR. MAZIARZ: Your Honor, there is not much\non searches incident prior to 1914, the Weeks case.\nThere really is not any --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Something was happening\nback there. The automobile exception is much older than\nthat.\nMR. MAZIARZ: Excuse me, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The automobile exception\nis much older than that.\nMR. MAZIARZ: Right, but the -- the search\nincident language and application --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But, you know, the\nautomobile exception could provide a rationale that\nwould cover all of these cases. Do you remember my\nopinion in Belton?\nMR. MAZIARZ: Yes, I do, very well, Your\nHonor. But here we -- we have no probable cause. So it\nwould not affect the situation here. This is purely a\n-- a Belton search for officer safety and preservation\nof evidence.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It's for officer safety\nwhen the defendant is no longer in the car and is under\n-- under the control of the officer?\nMR. MAZIARZ: There is still a risk.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Which are not the facts of\nBelton.\nMR. MAZIARZ: Belton, no. The arrestees\nwere not physically restrained in a vehicle.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You are asking for the\nexpanded Belton rule, not the rule of Belton itself.\nMR. MAZIARZ: No, Your Honor. We're asking\nthat Belton be applied as it has been applied by\nvirtually every court in the country and -- and, in\nfact, in this Court in Thornton. That as -- as long as\nthe arrestee remains at the scene and the search is\ncontemporaneous with the arrest, the officer is entitled\nto -- to conduct a search of the vehicle.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's a reasonable rule.\nWhat isn't a reasonable rule is to say at the same\npremises as long as the officer is there and the officer\nis at risk. I mean that is just -- it's just silly.\nIt's -- it's simply not the case. And -- and if you\nbring that forward as the justification for this rule,\nI'm going to say, you know, get rid of it.\nMR. MAZIARZ: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Realistically, he is not at\nrisk. The guy is handcuffed in the police cruiser, and\nso I want to go and search his car. What -- what risk\nto the officer is being avoided?\nMR. MAZIARZ: In -- in our reply brief we\npointed out in 2007 there were 93 reported cases where\narrestees cuffed in the back of a patrol car escaped.\nSo it -- it's very possible this could happen. Now, you\nhave to know --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do you know of any one of\nthose cases in which the officer got hurt? Do you know\nof any one of those cases in which the person who got\nout of the police cruiser made a beeline for -- for his\nown car?\nIn fact, so far as I know, we are -- we are\nnot even sure that those people came out of automobiles\nbefore they were put in a police cruiser. But do you\nknow of any case in which they went to their own car and\ntried to get a gun to hurt the cop?\nMR. MAZIARZ: In one of the cases the\narrestee went to his vehicle but simply took off and led\nthe police on a high-speed chase, but none in -- where\nthey went to the vehicle and grabbed a weapon.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Did he -- did he have --\nhave his hands handcuffed behind his back?\nMR. MAZIARZ: Yes. Yes, he had --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And he was able to drive\nthe car?\nMR. MAZIARZ: Yes. Well, Your Honor, it's\nmy understanding -- I'm not an expert on this, but it's\nmy understanding from reading some of these cases --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'd really like to meet\nhim.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I wouldn't. I'll bet you\nthat in most of those cases the -- the felon got out the\nother -- other door of the car while the policeman was\nsearching the vehicle.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MAZIARZ: And, Your Honor, in -- in ten\nof those cases the officers were searching the vehicle\nwhen they escaped.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if you\ndon't have -- I thought the whole point of a bright-line\nrule is that you don't have to justify in every\nparticular case applying the -- the rule. So you are\ncertainly going to -- if you -- the point is if you have\na fact case-by-case inquiry, you're giving up the\nbright-line rule.\nMR. MAZIARZ: And that was the point I was\ntrying to make is -- is there is going to be -- security\nis a matter of degree. Is the arrestee sufficiently\nsecured if he is arrested and standing next to the\nvehicle? Is he sufficiently secured if he is cuffed and\n-- and removed 10 feet away? Is he sufficiently secured\nif he is in the patrol car?\nWe -- in Belton this Court wanted to do away\nwith those nuances and have just a straightforward --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there other -- are\nthere other reasons that it's hazardous or dangerous or\nat least risky to leave an unattended car where other\npeople can go in and maybe find weapons and contraband\nif the police aren't guarding it? I mean, are there\nother reasons other than Chimel for this bright-line\nrule?\nMR. MAZIARZ: Certainly, in -- in the case\nof an automobile, which is different from the Chimel\nhome situation, if a vehicle is being left there. In\nthis case the gun was on the front passenger seat of the\nvehicle. Someone could readily access it. That's\nalways true with an automobile.\nOfficers obviously could take some steps to\ntry and secure the vehicle, lock it up or what-not. But\nthat's not going to guarantee the fact that -- that the\nweapon or destructible evidence won't be tampered with\nby either other co-occupants who the officers have no\njustification to arrest and secure or other people in\nthe area. So --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What happens to this car?\nNow, we had no passengers, just the driver. He is put\naway in this squad car, so he is not going to drive that\ncar home. What happens to the car? Let's say there was\nno search. The car is there. It has no driver. What\ndo the police do with it?\nMR. MAZIARZ: In this case the police\nimpounded the car, but that was only because after they\ndid the Belton search, they found drugs.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But suppose they didn't?\nSuppose they said, well, he is secure; he is no danger\nto us, so we are not going to search the car without a\nwarrant. What -- what happens to the car? It just\ndoesn't stay there stranded on the road, does it?\nMR. MAZIARZ: It depends on the department.\nSome departments would simply lock it up and leave it\nthere. Other departments would impound it and do an\ninventory search of the contents which obviously they\nwould find anything that happened to be in there during\nthe course of the inventory search. Now, in this\nparticular case it was unusual because the vehicle was\nactually pulled in the driveway of a house, so the\nofficers at the evidentiary hearing testified that had\nthey not found the drugs in the vehicle they would not\nhave impounded it, because again it was on private\nproperty and they would have had no real reason to do\nit.\nQuite simply there is no special\njustification for this Court to overrule Belton.\nNothing has changed in the past 27 years to call Belton\ninto question. The same complaints we hear voiced by\ndefendants, legal commentators and some judges are the\nsame complaints voiced by Justice Brennan in his dissent\nin Belton as well as by the New York Court of Appeals in\nits decision in People v Belton. The Court considered\neverything, made a policy decision based on\nreasonableness that -- that -- that officer safety --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it isn't true that we\ndidn't have the recent occupant problem at the time of\nBelton?\nMR. MAZIARZ: Right. That -- that came into\nfruition in -- in Thornton and -- and of course in this\ncase Gant is a -- as recent as a recent occupant can be.\nHe literally was stepping out of the car when the\nofficer summoned him and he knew the officers were there\nbecause they flashed a flashlight in his face as he\ndrove by three -- three feet from them.\nPolice officers have been trained under\nBelton for the past 27 years. They have applied it in\nthe field. It would ban an undue burden to have to\nretrain those officers and -- and for them to determine\nunder totality of the circumstances analysis when they\ncan and when they can't conduct searches of automobiles\nincident to arrest. They wouldn't know their authority;\ncitizens wouldn't know the scope of their Fourth\nAmendment protection. Additionally as we pointed out,\nan overwhelming majority of states, 41, have followed\nBelton and a few of those have even done so under their\nown State constitutional search and seizure provisions\nand of course they all had the opportunity to opt out\nbut they obviously believed Belton is a workable rule\nthat promotes officer safety and only has a minimal\nimpact on the privacy interests of the recent occupant\nof an automobile.\nUnless the Court has any further questions\nI'll retain whatever I have for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Yang\n-- Mr. Maziarz.\nNow Mr. Yang, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY YANG,\nFOR THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. YANG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court.\nBelton relied on a factor that was not in\nChimel, the need for an easily administratable rule in\nthe commonly recurring incident of vehicle arrest and\nthe search incident to that arrest. Justice Stewart who\nauthored both Chimel and Belton recognized that over a\ndecade of experience of Chimel had shown that the courts\nwere in disarray, that courts had confronted similar\nfact circumstances and come to differing results, that\nofficers in the field, confronted with the highly\nvolatile and dangerous events surrounding a custodial\narrest needed clear guidance to be able to govern their\nactions in these instances.\nThat makes total sense. Unlike Chimel which\noccurred in a home and arises in a situation where the\nprivacy interests are at their apex, in the Belton\ncontext, the search is of the passenger compartment of a\nvehicle, and this Court has repeatedly acknowledged that\nwith respect to automobiles there is a considerably\ndiminished or greatly are reduced expectation of\nprivacy. Given the very real threats that officers face\nin discharging their duties on a day-to-day basis in\nthis commonly recurring scene -- circumstances, Belton\nestablished a bright-line rule to be able to govern\ntheir conduct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Once you -- once you\neliminate the -- the need to show that the officer's\nsafety was threatened why -- why would you limit the\nsearch just to the passenger compartment of the vehicle?\nWhy don't you let him search the trunk, too?\nMR. YANG: Well, I think Belton -- when\nBelton was decided there was some question in terms of\nthe trunk in terms of this Court's decision in Sanders.\nSanders is mentioned in Belton. There hadn't been a\nproblem with a bright-line rule with respect to trunks\nand the Court simply didn't -- didn't address it. And\nwe're not in this case seeking an expansion of Belton,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I know -- I know you're not\nbut it just doesn't make sense to me to -- to abandon\nthe requirement that the -- that the officer's safety be\nthreatened and yet to say oh, but he can only search\nthe -- the passenger compartment. If indeed there is\nreduced expectation of privacy for the automobile, you\narrest somebody you can search the automobile; what's\nwrong with that?\nMR. YANG: Certainly in another case, you\nknow, the Court can revisit the scope of Belton but I\nthink Belton as established certainly makes sense with\nrespect to the ambit of the passenger compartment. Even\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In Belton, wasn't the\nnotion what was within grabbing distance? And the trunk\nwasn't within grabbing distance. That was -- and here\nnothing is within grabbing distance.\nMR. YANG: Well, I'm not sure that that's --\nthat's correct, Justice Ginsburg. In Belton the New\nYork Court of Appeals in a portion quoted the Court by\nBelton had determined that there was no longer any\ndanger that the arrestees could get to the vehicle, and\nin fact Justice Brennan emphasized in dissent there was\nno possibility that they could reach passenger\ncompartment.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What is the basis for your\nwanting us to adopt what we might call a bright-line\nrule for automobile exception? What are the reasons\nother than officer safety which we think may not be a\nvery persuasive reason.\nMR. YANG: Well, the -- related to officer\nsafety is the question of the administrability of the\nrule in these highly fluid contexts. The officers must\nmake rapid judgments about what is and what is not\npermissible and in Belton the Court recognized that a\nrule -- that rules based on the totality of the\ncircumstances, which require all kinds of ifs ands or\nbuts, simply are not workable; and that had been borne\nout with 10 years of experience with Chimel being\napplied in the vehicle context and Belton.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I take it you agree it's\nperfectly workable to say that if the defendant has been\ntaken to the police station, they can't then search the\ncar --\nMR. YANG: Yes. We believe the\nbright-line --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why isn't it equally\nworkable to say when the defendant is handcuffed and put\nin the back of a cruiser, they can't do it?\nMR. YANG: Well, Justice Souter we think\nthat -- in some ways that does have the benefit of a\nbright-line rule, but we don't believe that the --\nthat's a question of where you're going to draw that\nline.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right. And -- and we are\ntalking now about administeribility. The police station\nrule is administrable; it makes for a good bright-line\nrule; why doesn't handcuffs in the back of the cruiser\nmake for an equally bright line?\nMR. YANG: We actually would draw the line a\nlittle closer than the police station. It would be when\nthe -- the search has begun after the suspect has been\nremoved from the scene. But in terms of\nadministrability I guess that would provide for a\nsufficiently bright-line rule but the problem is drawing\nthe line at that point.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why wouldn't the rule of\nrequiring just the automobile exception, where you would\nrequire probable cause to search a vehicle, why wouldn't\nthat be a bright line rule that would fit into\neverything else.\nMR. YANG: It is, but the difference between\nthe probable cause exception and a search incident to\narrest is a search incident to arrest doctrine --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Are you more concerned\nabout the ability to search the vehicle or the\nprotection of the officer?\nMR. YANG: Well, certainly the protection of\nthe officer is what motivates the doctrine.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But doesn't -- don't these\nrules apply to ordinary traffic arrests where there\nreally is very little risk to the officer?\nMR. YANG: Actually, Your Honor, very\ncommon-day traffic arrests have high risk to the officer\ndue to the unknowns. The Court recognized that in\nRobinson, Robinson which established the bright-line\nrule for search of the person was in fact an arrest\nbased on failure -- driving on a suspended license. The\nCourt has in Chadwick emphasized that all custodial\narrests --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The need to search the\nvehicle is primarily justified by the interest in\nofficer safety?\nMR. YANG: Primarily, but also the interest\nin preserving evidence. When a suspect is --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the interest in\npreserving evidence really should only be present when\nthere is probable cause to believe there is some\nevidence.\nMR. YANG: Oh, no; when a suspect is put\nunder custodial arrest, the -- there is increased\nincentive both to escape, to get weapons, and also to\ndestroy any incriminating evidence that might be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You've arrested this guy\nfor -- for reckless driving. He was going 25 miles over\nthe speed limit, okay? And you're going to search his\ncar for evidence? Of what?\nMR. YANG: To preserve --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're going to allow the\nsearch nonetheless. Let's assume he is handcuffed in\nthe back, so officer safety is not at issue; but you say\nwe want to be able to search a car for evidence.\nEvidence of what?\nMR. YANG: Well, we would take issue with\nrespect to the officer safety.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that.\nMR. YANG: But in terms -- in terms of the\nevidence the Court recognized in Maryland v --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You have to link -- if\nyou're going to use that rationale you have to link the\nreason for the arrest with the likelihood that there\nwould be any evidence found in the car that would\nsupport the arrest.\nMR. YANG: The Court recognized in Maryland\nv Wilson that when you pull someone over for a traffic\nstop, there is a risk of escalation of the encounter\nbecause evidence of a more serious crime might be\nrevealed in that stop.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, so -- so you, you\navowedly say that once you arrest somebody you can\nrummage around for evidence of a different crime, right?\nMR. YANG: No. What I'm -- what I'm talking\nabout is the -- the danger of the custodial arrest\nsituation, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you keep coming back\nto danger. And let's -- let's assume that some of us\nthink that when he has been handcuffed and in the back\nof a car and he is about ready to leave the scene, there\nis no more danger. I want to know if there are any\nother reasons other than preserving evidence for\nsearching the car.\nIt seems to me there are good reasons for\nsearching that car. It's -- it's movable. That's the\nold vehicle exception. It can have contraband in it.\nIt can be stolen. It can be taken for joy rides. But\nyou don't seem to make any of those arguments. You just\nwant to keep coming back to officer safety and on that\npoint I think your case is very weak.\nMR. YANG: Well, on the point of officer\nsafety, Your Honor, I can understand the Court's\nreluctance to think that a person handcuffed in a car is\nlikely to escape. And we admit that the occurrence is\nrelatively small. It's clear that a person handcuffed\nin the back of a patrol care escapes the car dozens of\ntimes a year. We just did a simple search on the\nInternet --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Fine, if you want to go\nback to that, fine. I have problems with the argument\nbut if that's your argument I'll take it from there.\nMR. YANG: But the point is, on a continuum,\nBelton provides an administrable rule where officers in\nthe field can guide their conduct. There's going to be\ninstances in which the risk is going to be higher, and\nthere's going to be instances where the risk is lower.\nAnd, admittedly, we are on the end of the continuum, but\nit -- Belton wanted to provide a rule whereby you\nwouldn't have to guess in these circumstances.\nCertainly, with respect to the privacy\ninterest in vehicles as well, Justice Kennedy, the\nprivacy interest in the vehicle, particularly when\nyou've been arrested and could be -- for a traffic\nviolation --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Normally, to overcome the\nprivacy interest, you need probable cause. And you did\nneed probable cause for the automobile exception too.\nMR. YANG: In terms of the balancing that's\nconducted, it can be a risk to officer safety, the need\nfor administrable rule balanced against the privacy\ninterest. Here the privacy interest has been quite\ndiminished. Once you've been arrested on the street,\nthe police often have -- certainly have a constitutional\nability to impound the car and conduct an inventory\nsearch.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Could they have impounded\nthis car? I thought they didn't have grounds to impound\nit because it was -- we were just told it was parked in\nan alley of a private house.\nMR. YANG: It was in a private house owned\nby someone else. The officers testified that they\nnormally would not tow it at that point, but certainly\nthey would have had the constitutional authority. It\nwould have been reasonable for officers to impound the\ncar that was not at the residence of the arrestee.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So they could have\nimpounded, and then could they have done an inventory\nsearch?\nMR. YANG: Correct, which underscores the\ndiminished privacy interest that an arrestee would have\nin the contents of a vehicle. And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why can they impound\nit? Suppose they stop and he pulls over to the side of\nthe street where there is parking, all-night parking.\nWhat authority would they have to drag that car away?\nMR. YANG: Well, once someone has been\narrested and if it's all-night parking, if the person is\ngoing into a custodial arrest, going to jail for\npurposes of protecting --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He says, \"Let me lock my\ncar.\" You know, \"I park it on the street all the time.\nIt's a lousy car any way. Nobody wants to steal it.\"\n(Laughter.)\nMR. YANG: Well, for purposes of the impound\nand inventory search, so long as there's a reasonable\nbasis, and the reasonable basis would be to secure the\nvehicle to get it off the street when the occupant has\nbeen arrested and wouldn't be able to retrieve it, I\nthink --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I can see some situations\nwhere -- where, for public safety or other reasons, you\nhave to remove the car from where it is, and I guess the\nbest thing to do is to drag it off to the police\nimpoundment yard. But in other situations, I -- you\nspeak so blithely of impoundment as though -- as though\nthat's an automatic remedy. I just don't know that it\nis.\nMR. YANG: It's not automatic, but it does\ngo against the expectation of privacy that one has in\nthe personal effects in the vehicle, and is greatly\ndiminished because, you know, the State -- I believe it\nwas your decision in Wyoming versus Houghton -- the\nState regulates cars on a daily basis. They inspect,\nexamine the vehicle. So when we are talking about the\nconstitutional balance --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Diminished expectations of\nprivacy are not a reason to search.\nMR. YANG: Correct, but what it's balanced\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The only reason to search\nthat I can find from you so far is officer safety.\nMR. YANG: Officer safety and the need for\nan administrable rule, which is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Where -- where is it? I\nmean, if you want to -- if you want to search, you can\nimpound the car. If you want to search, you can ask for\nconsent, which you probably won't get. If you want to\nsearch, you can look in the window. There's no problem\nthere. It's just under the seat and in the glove\ncompartment we're talking about. If you have probable\ncause to think that there's evidence of a crime even in\nthe glove compartment or underneath the seat, you can\nlook at it without a warrant. Why do you need this as\nwell?\nYou say we need this as well because the guy\nwho's locked up in back of the squad car might take off\nthe handcuffs, open the door, run out, and grab a gun\nfrom under the glove compartment. That's a little thin.\nAnd then you say, well, the rule is it needs to be\nadministrable. And then I say, okay, the rule is\nadministrable if you've got him locked up in the squad\ncar and all you want to do is have a good snoop around,\ntake it in and impound it. That's administrable.\nMR. YANG: The likelihood of that event\noccurring is relatively small. The potential risks to\nofficers are great. Given that this does occur, that\nindividuals do escape from vehicles, and -- here the\nvehicle, the police vehicle, was parked immediately\nbehind the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I got that point. Are\nthere many people, by the way, they arrest but they\nleave them standing outside the squad car?\nMR. YANG: It will depend on the\ncircumstances, Your Honor. Sometimes --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean are we going to have\none of these spectrum things?\nMR. YANG: Well, that's exactly the point.\nIn items of the administrable rule, there's all kinds of\nstages in an arrest, which, we'd have to stop and say,\nyou know, is it going to be -- is he arrested -- is\nthere one officer, or are the three suspects -- are they\nhandcuffed in front or are they handcuffed in back? Is\nit a metal handcuff? Is it a plastic handcuff? Is it\nnight? What's the surrounding circumstances in terms of\nthe traffic that might be distracting to the officer?\nIs it a neighborhood which is a high-crime neighborhood?\nThere's all kinds of things that, in the \"totality of\ncircumstances\" approach the Arizona Supreme Court\nadopted, would be inadministrable in the field. And the\nCourt recognized that in Belton, and in fact reaffirmed\nthat in Thornton. Just recently the Court explained\nthat experiences show the need for a bright-line rule in\nthis context.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So -- a fine-line rule. I\nmean -- and you can instruct all the police officers in\nyour department, when you arrest somebody, have them\nstand right near the car while you search it. Okay?\nMake sure that he's near enough that, you know, he's a\nthreat to your safety.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. YANG: I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's certainly a\nbright-line rule.\nMR. YANG: I doubt that -- the hypothetical\nthat someone --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's actually a\nserious point, maybe in your favor because it -- what\nwas worrying me about this is, if you lose the case,\nthere would be policemen who would then let dangerous\npeople stay in the car so they could search it. But you\nhaven't made that argument, and, you know, that would be\nthe --\nMR. YANG: We think that that would be the\nexception. It's possible. We don't think that would\nhappen on a routine basis, and certainly police\ndepartments and the Federal Government would not\nencourage our officers to take that risk.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, nobody would.\nMR. YANG: Custodial arrests are dangerous\nin themselves, and this is one step, a reasonable step,\nthat officers can take to secure their safety, among\nothers, in the instance of a custodial arrest on the\nstreet.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But really what's at stake\nhere is the right to search the vehicle for things that\nare not right out in front at the time he does the\ncustodial arrest.\nMR. YANG: For instance, like a gun right\nunderneath the seat, which would --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If it was right there,\nobviously he had a right to search the whole vehicle\nunder the automobile exception, but in the normal case,\nI don't see why officer safety is an adequate\njustification for going beyond the authority that it\nwould have under the automobile exception. That's the\nproblem I have, because you do have broad authority if\nyou have probable cause.\nMR. YANG: May I?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.\nMR. YANG: Officer safety underlies the\nChimel exception, to begin with.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I understand Chimel, but\n--\nMR. YANG: And Chimel --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- underlie Ross.\nMR. YANG: That's correct, but it's a\ndifferent doctrine. I'm mean, that's about --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: My basic question is: Why\ndoesn't that different doctrine apply the bright-line\nrule, simply administered, that you need?\nMR. YANG: When we're talking about\ncustodial arrest, there are unknown risks. If there are\nunknown risks, officers obviously can't have probable\ncause to believe there would be a weapon in the car.\nAnd that's what the \"search incident to arrest\" doctrine\nseeks to address.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you Mr. Yang.\nMR. YANG: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Jacobs.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS F. JACOBS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. JACOBS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI'd first like to address the issue of the\nhistorical basis for the Fourth Amendment that was\nraised earlier. I would note that in the Respondent's\nbrief, on page 13 footnote 5 and on pages 15 through 16,\nthe LaFave treatise is cited. That treatise addressed,\nprimarily in the context of automobile searches, a\nhistory of the -- the nature of Fourth Amendment\nrestrictions on that type of search.\nWe also draw from Chimel itself, which\ncontained an evaluation of the history of Fourth\nAmendment searches in general in order to come to the\nconclusion that the Fourth Amendment requires that\nsearches which are exceptions to the warrant requirement\nmust be tied to the twin exigencies on which they are\nbased.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why is that so for\nsearches of the vehicle? When it isn't -- it isn't so\nfor search of the person? I mean, if the police arrest\nMother Teresa, they are still entitled to frisk her,\nright, even though there's little likelihood that she\nhas a Gatt?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- if -- if we don't\napply the officer safety rationale to searches of the\nperson, no matter how elderly, how eminent, how virtuous\nthe person is, you can frisk. We're obviously not\napplying the officer safety rule across the board.\nWe're adopting a bright-line rule that obviously applies\nto many situations in which the officer is not at risk.\nWhy can't you do the same for automobiles?\nMR. JACOBS: If the Court, Mr. Justice\nScalia, if you're suggesting that a bright-line rule\nmight be adopted that is essentially exactly like the\nsearch of person incident to arrest, the problem is that\nin an arrest situation the police have exclusive\ndominion and control over the person. They have that\nperson in their custody, that person realistically, at\nthe point when they have taken that person into their\ncustody, historically had been recognized as a subject\nof search, and that has been consistent throughout our\njurisprudence in the Fourth Amendment. We have always\nrecognized that right. The problem is when you take an\nitem like a car that is divorced from the person who is\nin the custody of the police and now extend that right\nto search to the individual or to the car, which is not\nnecessarily something over which the police have a right\nto dominion and control. They have no problem with the\ncar.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's -- what's the\nhistory there? Do you know the history there.\nMR. JACOBS: In -- in terms of extension of\nthe car rights?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, Thomas Jefferson's\nconveyance --\nMR. JACOBS: I -- I can refer the case to\nthe LaFave treatise in terms of a complete history upon\nthat, but the Court has always --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There is not much there.\nMR. JACOBS: I'm sorry, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There is not much there.\nMR. JACOBS: The -- the Court has raised a\ngood point, but what we -- what is consistent, whether\nit's cars or not cars, is the requirement that searches\nunder the Fourth Amendment be supported by warrants or\nan exception.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the absence of\ndominion or control works the other way. That makes it\nall the more dangerous. That could be -- there could be\nguns that other people could get out, evidence other\npeople could get out; and, rather than go through a\ncase-by-case analysis of whether this was true in every\ncase, we just have a bright-line rule as Justice Scalia\nsaid at the outset.\nMR. JACOBS: The --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that the\nabsence of the dominion and control is -- is just a\nconclusory statement to explain what happens in the case\nthe person is arrested, but it -- it doesn't seem to me\nto provide a rationale.\nMR. JACOBS: Well, Justice Kennedy, it\nexplains the difference between a person and something\nthat is not the person, something that is divorced\nphysically from the person, in the same sense that\nMr. Chimel's house was separate from his person.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It actually works the\nother way, because it means there is more reason to\nsearch. It's not in our dominion and control. We are\nleaving it on the street. We want to know what's in\nthere.\nMR. JACOBS: Well, keeping in mind the\npolice have no right to search the car except under\ndelineated exceptions. And what the Government is\nasking here --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That is what they are\nasking about in this case.\nMR. JACOBS: Well, what the Petitioner is\nasking, Justice Kennedy, is that the Belton rule be\ninterpreted so expansively that it's no longer simply a\nbright-line rule of what you can search, but it's\nactually a bright-line rule that removes judicial review\nfrom when you can conduct that search. And the problem\nwith that is --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But don't you have to show\nthat there are special circumstances here justifying the\noverruling of Belton?\nMR. JACOBS: No.\nJUSTICE ALITO: No?\nMR. JACOBS: No, Mr. Justice Alito. We do\nnot have to show that there are any special\ncircumstances, and we do not necessarily have to\noverrule Belton here.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Now, is this a fair summary\nof the holding of Belton: When a police officer has\nmade a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of an\nautomobile, he may as a contemporaneous incident of that\narrest search the passenger compartment of that\nautomobile?\nMR. JACOBS: That is an accurate statement\nof the holding of Belton, Justice Alito.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And if that rule is applied\nin this case, you would lose; would you not?\nMR. JACOBS: Well, we do not lose, Justice\nAlito. The reason is because of the focus that the\nPetitioner places on the aspect of that holding. They\ntake it in a vacuum. They don't look at the word\n\"contemporaneous\" in terms of defining \"incident to\narrest.\"\nThe problem with the search in this case and\nso many others is that the search that is conducted is\nafter the police have taken custody and secured the\nindividual.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I -- I mean I don't know if\nit can go off on that. The -- it seems to me I -- I\nthought when I looked through this, which was quickly,\nit seemed to me everyone was assuming that it's\ncontemporaneous. Of course, if it isn't\ncontemporaneous, that's a new world, and maybe you would\nwin on that. I don't know. But don't we have to for\npresent purposes take it as a contemporaneous search,\nwhich I think is what the lower courts found?\nMR. JACOBS: There are two views of that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'm sure there are,\nbut what is your opinion? I mean, is there some reason\nwhat I have been doing -- you can tell me -- I am\nfinding this case very, very difficult. And I am not at\nall certain in my own mind, and I am being quite frank\nwith you. And the reason is that although I don't think\nBelton is very logical, it has been the law for 27\nyears; and I take they seriously, as we all do, the\nprinciple of stare decisus.\nThat is why your response to Justice Alito\nreally sort of shook me. Because I was thinking, one, I\nhave to take this as contemporaneous; and I have to run\nsquarely into the problem that for some period of years\nBelton has been the law and maybe even before Belton. I\ndon't know about Thomas Jefferson's automobile. But,\nnonetheless, no disaster has occurred, and so why would\nwe overrule an earlier case?\nNow that's -- that's exactly my problem.\nAnd so if you were interested in that, you have to give\nme an answer.\nMR. JACOBS: Justice Breyer, we are here to\nfocus on exactly the issue of what is contemporaneous\nand I believe that it's important to focus on exactly\nwhat Belton arose out of. Belton arose out of as this\ncourt is well aware four individuals who were taken out\nof a car all four placed under arrest one set of\nhandcuffs all around the car and arguably all arguably\nhad access to or control over the passenger compartment\nof the vehicle. That's one of the requirements of\nBelton's holding is that they have to arguably have\naccess to the passenger compartment.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What does contemporaneous\nhave to do with officer safety? It has to do with\ntiming doesn't it?\nMR. JACOBS: Well if we consider Justice\nAlito that officer safety is a function of when you make\nthat assessment. Is officer safety most at risk when\nthe person is initially seized? Yes. However, once\nthey are in the back of a police car as Justice Scalia\npointed out they pose a threat to no up with and the\nrecord is clear on that.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Let's say when an arrest is\nmade, a team of officers are there. The person arrested\nis a person of slight stature. They immediately descend\non this person and manacle the person in every possible\nway, but it's all done in 10 seconds. Is that not\ncontemporaneous?\nMR. JACOBS: If one were to assume a search\nwas conducted at that moment.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And immediately they search.\nMR. JACOBS: I'm sorry if they immediately\nsearch after restraining the person and there is a\ndefined between it being a second or minute or 32\nminutes that's not contemporaneous because the reasons\nsupported by that search are not supported by the fact\nin the exigency. Belton was a situation where there was\nan immediate and tipping risk to the officer.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're looking at\nthe specific facts of Belton. Belton adopted a\nbright-line rule. The whole point of a bright-line rule\nis that you don't look at the specific facts and it\npresents a problem here you say the guy is handcuffed\nand in the back of the car? Well what if he is in the\nback of the car but not handcuffed? What if there are\nfive people around who might break open the police car\nand free him? What if there are three people around?\nYou have exactly the same case by case inquiry that\nBelton said we are not going to do.\nMR. JACOBS: Mr. Chief Justice we look at\nBuie, in Mincey the court noted that I search conducted\nimmediate risk was that all preBelton.\nMR. JACOBS: Those are not all preBelton\nYour Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which one is not.\nMR. JACOBS: Mincey was after Belton, Your\nHonor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are those all\npreThornton.\nMR. JACOBS: Those are all preThornton Your\nHonor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well in Thornton of\ncourse the guy was handcuffed in the back of the police\ncar.\nMR. JACOBS: In Belton Your Honor, the\nPetitioner in this case waived this analysis that we are\ndealing with in this case but it is true that the\narrestee was secured. The issue was whether he was a\nrecent occupant of the vehicle when he was apprehended\nand whether we should even consider application of\nBelton.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess my question\nis what is left of the Belton bright-line rule when you\nare done.\nMR. JACOBS: Exactly.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We have to have a to\ndetermine a threat to officer safety.\nMR. JACOBS: If we assume that that\nassessment is something new, Mr. Chief Justice then we\nare accepting without a basis Petitioner's\ninterpretation of Belton's bright-line rule as etch\ntending beyond simply what is the permissible scope of\nthe search. Remembering that Belton only applied Chimel\nto the automobile situation Petitioner advocates a much\nmuch too broad interpretation of this bright line rule\nthat arose out of Belton and --\nJUSTICE ALITO: The bright-line rule is set\nout in one sentence which is the sentence that I read to\nyou but if you just assume for the sake of argument that\nin order to prevail, in order for you to prevail Belton\nhas to be overruled. What is your, what's the\njustification for overruling Belton? Is it, has there\nbeen no reliance on it, is the Belton rule less workable\nthan the rule that, the case by case rule that you're\nproposing, is it undermined by subsequent developments\nand precedent or does stare decisus simply not count in\nthese cases.\nMR. JACOBS: Well Justice Alito stare\ndecisus always counts except where you're wrong.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Assuming the\ndecision is wrong.\nMR. JACOBS: That's right. Stare decisus is\nwrong, but you have to consider my point, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nJUSTICE ALITO: That's enough if we think\nBelton was wrong that's enough for overruling it.\nMR. JACOBS: Yes and if the court is\nconsidering it Mr. Justice Alito if we would like me to\nanswer the question assuming we should overrule Belton\nwhy we should do it the answer is Chimel provides us\nwith sufficient tools for officers to protect their\nsafety in the field because you will recall there are\nother ex-is hes to automobile searches with I have based\non actual grounds.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well are you saying do you\nhave any in my own mind perhaps differently from you I\nthink that the stare decisus is really brought into play\nwhen you think the earlier decision was wrong.\nMR. JACOBS: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And at that point I'd still\nneed a reason why you should depart from that earlier\ndecision at the moment what the other side says is we\ntell our police a simple thing. We tell them when you\narrest somebody who is in a car you can search the\npassenger compartment of the car okay. Simple. And\nwe've trained a hundred thousand police officers to do\nthat and they do it. Now, is there some indication that\nthat's turned out to be abusive? Is there indication\nthat there are other problems with the rule as it turned\nout to be complicated? What kinds of things you could\nsay that will overcome what I'm putting forth as a kind\nof reluctance.\nMR. JACOBS: I understand, Justice Breyer,\nand the answer is that -- two things: One, and first\nand foremost, Belton's general assumption, which is\nessentially required for the application of the\nbright-line rule, is empirically not true. With police\nprocedures as we understand them today, routinely\narrestees are secured, they are handcuffed, they are\nroutinely placed in the back of patrol cruisers.\nAnd even the amici for the Petitioner in\nthis case acknowledged that officers are not going to\ndeviate from those procedures just to make a search in\nthe future if the rule is changed, but primarily that,\nthat the assumption that underlies Belton is not shown\nto be empirically true. It's empirically false.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just not to get\nback -- Mincey was 1978. Belton was 1981.\nMR. JACOBS: Yeah, I misspoke then. Mincey\nwould have been before Belton and would have been a\nbasis, Mr. Chief Justice, for the Court to apply --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but I'm trying\nto see -- you cited three cases. And my question was\nwhether those survived Belton. Now, were all three of\nthose before Belton?\nMR. JACOBS: If Mincey was, then I would\nhazard a guess that the other three were as well, Your\nHonor, except for Buie. And I don't have a cite on that\nas to the year for Buie.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, one of the\nreally contentious issues at the time Belton decided is\nwhether you can search containers in the back in the\npassenger part of the car. And under the automobile\nexception, you could search those containers if you had\nprobable cause to believe anything in the car was\ncontraband. And that's what Belton really opened the\ndoor to, was container searches. It was not just\nsearches of things in plain view.\nAnd, of course, the justification for\nsuggesting that that's too broad a rule is the very\nstrong privacy interest in containers in cars driven by\nordinary motorists. That's really what's at issue under\nBelton.\nMR. JACOBS: I would agree with that\nstatement, Justice Stevens. That's a correct statement.\nAnd Buie is 1990, Your Honor. My able staff\nhas provided the answers.\nBut we have to recall, Justices, that we are\nat all times looking to the Fourth Amendment, its twin\nexigencies, and the requirement that this Court has\nconsistently held, that in order to avoid a warrant,\nthere must be a clearly defined and limited exception to\nthe warrant requirement.\nNow, if there are no more questions, I will\nyield the floor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You are not asking to\noverrule Belton; you are asking to take it in the\ncontext in which it was presented, where there was\ngenuine concern for officer safety. Is that --\nMR. JACOBS: Justice Ginsburg, that is\nexactly correct. In those situations Belton would\napply.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just to explore\nthat, that does seem to me to be overruling Belton to\nthe extent Belton adopted a bright-line rule. What\nyou're saying is, well, in these circumstances Belton\napplies, and in these circumstances, it doesn't. But\nyou're overruling Belton when you say there's no longer\na bright-line rule.\nMR. JACOBS: Mr. Chief Justice, and I'm not\nbeing articulate enough, I think, because I keep coming\nback to the same thing. The bright-line rule in Belton\nwas the extent of the permissible search, not the\ntrigger for the permissible search. Although Belton\nindicated that the arrest -- an arrest of a person, if\nhe is deemed a recent occupant and if the search is\nconducted contemporaneously with that arrest, allows the\nsearch. It is the scope of the search that was\npermitted, because we couldn't figure out, as a\nconsistent matter, what was reaching distance when we\ndealt with that particular and problematic situation.\nAnd that's from Belton. And footnote 3 again comes back\nto that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think after\nBelton -- you think after Belton, we still have to look\nand see what's reaching distance on a case-by-case\nbasis?\nMR. JACOBS: Belton only requires that if\nthe passenger compartment of the vehicle is arguably\nwithin the reach of an arrestee who was a recent\noccupant, that the police may contemporaneously search\nthe passenger compartment without regard for how far.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't understand\nthat part: \"Arguably within the reach.\" I don't\nunderstand that to be part of Belton. I thought that's\nwhat Belton did away with, and thought Belton was\nsaying, look, we are going to have a bright-line rule,\nbecause we don't want to say he's five feet away, he is\nnot within the reach; two feet away, he is.\nMR. JACOBS: Belton --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think Belton\nkept the requirement that the person be arguably within\nthe reach of the compartment?\nMR. JACOBS: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. Not\nany specific portion of the compartment. That's what\nBelton said. You don't have to prove he could reach the\njacket in the back seat. You don't have to prove that\nhe could reach the briefcase under the passenger seat.\nYou just have to prove that he could reach the passenger\ncompartment. And we will generalize that if you can\nreach the passenger compartment, you can reach anything\nin it. And that was the generalization.\nAnd even though we know from police\nprocedures that empirically that's not really true, we\nknow that we can't -- the Petitioner can't cite a single\ninstance where somebody has gone back to his car,\ngrabbed a weapon, and attacked an officer. It just\nhasn't happened. Empirically it's false. And that, as\nJustice Breyer pointed out perhaps by his question, is\none of the flaws of Belton that courts may continue to\nstruggle with, but the bright-line doesn't change.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What about the situation\nwhere there are multiple occupants but there's probable\ncause to arrest only one of the occupants?\nMR. JACOBS: The consistent holdings of this\nCourt, in analyzing this type of situation under the\nFourth Amendment, have held that the arrestee is the\nfocus of the inquiry into determining whether there is\nan exempt to the Fourth Amendment requirement. And this\ndovetails, essentially, into the argument we have\nagainst the Petitioner's thought that third parties\nshould be the focus. But they weren't in Chimel, they\nweren't in Mincey, they weren't in Buie.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that going to be --\naren't cases like that going to be difficult calls as to\nwhether there's officer safety concerns?\nMR. JACOBS: No. They are not going to be\ndifficult calls. The focus being on the arrestee, the\nofficer --\nJUSTICE ALITO: One person is arrested,\nthree people who were occupants are not arrested. They\nare all out by the side of the car. One of them is in\nhandcuffs. Three of them are not arrested, not in\nhandcuffs. There's no danger of officer safety there --\nthree people?\nMR. JACOBS: Officers have -- well, first of\nall, again, the focus for the analysis is on the danger\nfrom the arrestee, and we know that from Buie and the\nmany cases that go with it. But, importantly, officers\nhave other tools that they can use, other than searching\nsomebody's car when they don't have probable cause.\nThey can temporarily detain people for\ninvestigative purposes. They can separate them from the\narea of vehicle and the arrest, and move them away.\nThey call for backup typically. In this case, for\nexample, they had -- they had four or five officers on\nscene, and the scene, objectively, according to the\nofficers, was secure. They said they had control of the\nscene.\nAnd that's an example of the use of police\nprocedures that are available other than searching that\nestablish officer safety and serve to protect our\nofficers in the field without offending the Fourth\nAmendment.\nIf there are no further questions, I will\nyield the floor. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Maziarz, you have two minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH T. MAZIARZ.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. MAZIARZ: Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.\nUnless there are any questions, I'll waive rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you.\n"
