        "content": "(10:11 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear\nargument this morning in Case 09-559, John Doe v. Reed,\nWashington Secretary of State.\nMr. Bopp.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES BOPP, JR.,\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. BOPP: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nNo person should suffer harassment for\nparticipating in our political system, and the First\nAmendment protects citizens from intimidation resulting\nfrom compelled disclosure of their identity and beliefs\nand their private associations.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what about\nrequiring disclosure of campaign contributions?\nMR. BOPP: Well, the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think that is\nunconstitutional?\nMR. BOPP: This Court has upheld the\ndisclosure in Buckley v. Valeo in 1976.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right. Now, why doesn't\nthat fall within your principle that no person should be\nexposed to criticism for --\nMR. BOPP: Well, it could --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- his political beliefs?\nMR. BOPP: It could potentially, and -- but\nthis Court subjected those requirements to the\nappropriate constitutional First Amendment analysis,\nfound that there was sufficiently important governmental\ninterest, some of which are not present when we're\ntalking about a referendum or initiative, and then also\ncreated an exception from even a generally valid statute\nwhere there is a reasonable probability of harassment of\nthat particular individual or -- or group.\nSo the First Amendment analysis regarding\nthe privacy of association, the privacy of identity and\nbeliefs, the potential of -- of intimidation are all\nelements of the analysis that was employed by the Court\nin Buckley.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm -- I'm trying to separate\nout the harassment aspects of this case from the working\nproposition that there's some sort of freedom of\nassociation, of privacy.\nYour theory, putting harassment aside, would\ninvalidate all of the State laws that require disclosure\nof voter registration lists, correct? All of those\nStates like New York that permit public review of voter\nregistration lists and party affiliations, et cetera --\nthat's illegal?\nMR. BOPP: No.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's unconstitutional?\nMR. BOPP: No. We believe they would not.\nThey would certainly be subject to First Amendment\nanalysis. But in -- in those -- in the instance of\nvoter registration, there are other governmental\ninterests that are not present in petition signings for\nreferendums.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Explain to me the\ndifference. And -- well, one other aspect of State\nlegislative -- I can only work from New York because I\nknow it intimately, but it is a State that also permits\nor requires that petitions for candidate listing on the\nballot be public as well. New York relies in part, as\nthis State does, on the public reviewing those\npetitions. Would that be invalid as well, for a\ncandidate's running?\nMR. BOPP: Well, we believe it would be\nsubject to First Amendment analysis. But, again, there\nare different governmental interests when you have\ncandidates involved.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So explain to me what\nthe difference is in those three situations.\nMR. BOPP: Well, one is you have candidates\ninvolved --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: With -- with the State's\ninterest.\nMR. BOPP: One is you have candidates\ninvolved. And this Court recognized in Buckley that\nthere were disclosure interests that related\nspecifically, and actually only, to candidates. For\ninstance, people who contribute to a candidate, that\ninformation, to the voter, can signal the interests that\nthe candidate, once he or she takes office, will be\nresponsive to.\nWhen we have an initiative, we know what the\nlaw is that is being voted upon. It's not a matter\nof -- of electing a representative.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You don't think that --\nputting aside this kind of referendum, just a\nhypothetical referendum having to do with a certain tax\nscheme -- you don't think the voters would be interested\nin knowing what kinds of people in what occupations are\ninterested in that particular tax benefit or not?\nMR. BOPP: Well, a few -- few might be, but\nwe think this is marginal information. First, they are\nadopting a law. And so we know what the law is. And --\nand while it might be marginal information for a few\npeople, once the measure qualifies for the ballot, this\nis only -- the petition signature and distribution is\nonly for a very limited governmental interest.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel --\nMR. BOPP: And that -- and that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, go ahead\nand finish your answer.\nMR. BOPP: And that limited governmental\ninterest is to preserve State money, to not conduct an\nelection on the matter unless there is sufficient public\nsupport. So --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, counsel, the\nresponses you have given to a couple of the questions\nhas been that the First Amendment analysis would apply.\nBut given you have a facial challenge, is that enough?\nDon't you have to indicate that the First Amendment\nanalysis would prevail in either all of the other cases,\nmost of the other cases, a significant portion?\nThis is a facial challenge. And if the\nchallenge is going to fail in some of those other cases,\nI think your facial challenge fails as well.\nMR. BOPP: Well, we're only challenging the\napplication of the Public Records Act to petitions and\nreferendum petitions. We're not challenging it as it\nwould be applied to petitions to put people on the\nballot.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we have to decide,\nin assessing your claim that, no matter what the\nreferendum issue was, that there's a significant\nintrusion on First Amendment rights?\nMR. BOPP: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that if, for\nexample, the referendum involves a bond issue as to\nwhich people may have particular views, but they're not\ngoing to get terribly excited about it, we'd still have to\nsay that that's protected under the First Amendment?\nMR. BOPP: Well, actually, under -- with\nmodern technology, it only takes a few dedicated\nsupporters, and a computer, who are willing to map -- to\nput this information on the Internet, MapQuest it, as\nthey did with respect to the contributors of\nProposition 8, which resulted in -- and then encourage\npeople to harass and intimidate them, which resulted in\nhundreds of examples of harassment --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, my point is,\nthough, you're not likely to get that with respect to,\nyou know, a debt issue, raising the debt ceiling from\n0.8 percent to 0.9 percent. You're not going to get a\ncrowd outside your house because you signed that\npetition.\nMR. BOPP: Well, it may not manifest itself\nin -- in any particular initiative. We agree with that,\nbut we think the potential is there, and there is\nusually a group of supporters of any measure that, you\nknow, are passionate about that particular issue.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- but don't you\nhave -- I thought we were dealing with count 1 of the\ncomplaint.\nMR. BOPP: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Count 2 would be the\ncounterpart to the exception that's made from the\ndisclosure requirement with regard to contributions with\ncertain organizations whose members might be harassed.\nMR. BOPP: Well, with this --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's -- that's not --\nthat would still be open if you lose the first part of\nthis case.\nSo going back to the question you were\nasked, how does this differ -- that Justice Scalia\nasked -- how does this differ from the contributor who\nsays, well, I might be harassed? The contributor\nwould have an opportunity to show that.\nMR. BOPP: Buckley dealt with that exact\nquestion. And first -- the first step of the analysis\nis whether or not the law is -- is valid under the First\nAmendment. And then there is an exception to even a\nvalid constitutional -- a constitutionally valid law.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, that's why I'm asking\nyou why, on the first part, should it be any different,\nas long as you have the door open to show that if you\nwere going to suffer reprisals, harassment, that an\nexception would have to be made?\nMR. BOPP: Well, we don't think that the exception\nis a substitute for considering the initial validity of\nthe law, which --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I -- may I ask you\none -- something that was not in your brief, but was in\nthe Secretary's brief. Is this list available to\nProject Marriage? And specifically on page 34 of\nSecretary Reed's brief, the statement is made that the\nsponsoring organizations sometimes sell or trade these\nlists. They use them for fundraising purposes. So that\nwould be the end of a person's privacy, at least on one\nside. Is that true, that the initiative sponsor uses\nthese lists?\nMR. BOPP: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes?\nMR. BOPP: Yes, this is an act of private\nassociation. The petition signers are associating with\nthe referendum committee for purposes of placing this\nmeasure on the ballot --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They don't say: Now, I\nagree you can use my name for fundraising purposes. But\nthat's -- it's implicit, you say, in their signing the\npetition that the --\nMR. BOPP: Well, what --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- signature collector\ncan sell the names, use them for its own fundraising\npurposes?\nMR. BOPP: What is implicit is they are\nassociating with this group for a purpose, and that is\nsupport for, in this case, Referendum 71. And so they\nuse those names for valid purposes. But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Bopp, do you have any\ncase in which we have held that the First Amendment\napplies to activity that consists of the process of\nlegislation, of legislating --\nMR. BOPP: Yes, Buckley II.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- or of adopting legislation?\nWhat is that?\nMR. BOPP: Buckley II. You struck down the\nrequirement that the person who is soliciting signatures\nself-identify.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That is --\nMR. BOPP: That is a process --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Soliciting signatures is not\ntaking part in the process of legislating.\nMR. BOPP: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The person who requests a\nreferendum is taking -- when there's a certain number of\nsignatures required to achieve it, is taking part in\nthat.\nAnd in light of the fact that for the first\ncentury of our existence, even voting was public -- you\neither did it raising your hand or by voice, or later,\nyou had a ballot that was very visibly red or blue so\nthat people knew which party you were voting for -- the\nfact is that running a democracy takes a certain amount\nof civic courage. And the First Amendment does not\nprotect you from criticism or even nasty phone calls\nwhen you exercise your political rights to legislate or\nto take part in the legislative process.\nMR. BOPP: Well, the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You are asking us to enter\ninto a whole new field where we've never gone before.\nMR. BOPP: Well, with all due respect, you\nhave already opined in Buckley II that the person on the\nother side of the clipboard is protected by the First\nAmendment.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't think that's --\nthat's true of Buckley II. What was -- what this Court\nsaid could not be done is that the solicitor could not\nbe made to wear a badge that says \"I am a paid\nsolicitor,\" but that the solicitor's name had to be\nidentified for the State. Certainly, the solicitor --\nthere was an affidavit, and there was the filings with\nwhatever was the State agency.\nSo what was -- what this Court said could\nnot be done was this kind of in-your-face big button\nthat says \"I am a paid solicitor,\" but the solicitor's\nname and address certainly had to be disclosed.\nMR. BOPP: That is true. You've correctly\ndescribed Buckley II. But as we can see in the facts of\nthis case, the public disclosure of the petition names\nin this case -- there was a planned harassment and\nintimidation of these voters by --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let me -- let me ask\nyou, could the opponents of a particular ballot measure\norganize a boycott for -- and picket businesses whose\nmanagers had supported that boycott?\nMR. BOPP: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Had supported that\ninitiative?\nMR. BOPP: Yes. Under the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if that's so,\nthen under Claiborne Hardware, which I -- I notice you\ndidn't cite in your brief, but if -- if that's so,\nthen it seems to me that the State's -- or\nthat -- that the signers' interest in keeping their\nnames private is somewhat diminished.\nMR. BOPP: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's a First Amendment\nactivity.\nMR. BOPP: But what we're -- but what is\ninvolved here that is not involved there is the\nrequirement by the government that you publicly disclose\nyour identity and beliefs on a matter that then --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- just --\nMR. BOPP -- subjects you to the boycott.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Let me stop you there,\nbecause I think your -- your own brief, I think you said\ntwice that you cannot tell anything about the signer's\nbelief from the mere signature. You said it could be\nsupport for -- for the proposition or it could be just\nsupport for letting the people decide.\nMR. BOPP: That is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Or it could even be, you\nsay, that this solicitor is pesky, and in order to\nplacate the solicitor, to get rid of the solicitor, we'll\njust sign. So you -- you have said that -- that\nthe signing itself is ambiguous. You don't know what\nthe reason is. It doesn't necessarily mean that the\nperson is a supporter of the proposition.\nMR. BOPP: But, with all due respect, we\ndid not say the third. We did say the first and the\nsecond. And -- but either of those are political\nstatements. The highlighted box at the top, you know,\nstates -- states that by signing R-71, we can reverse that\ndecision, meaning the passage of a law, and protect\nmarriage between a man and a woman.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I call your attention\nto page 20 of your reply brief? Because I don't think\nthat your response was correct. You say: Do petition\nsigners support the repeal, simply indicate they would\nlike public election to be held, or simply sign to avoid\nany further discussion with the petition circulator?\nMR. BOPP: I acknowledge that we said that,\nJustice Ginsburg. And, of course, the second statement\nis -- and which I think is the dominant statement and\ncertainly sufficient -- and that is that we want a measure\nto be placed on the ballot in order for the people to\nvote. That is one of the central --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, Mr. Bopp, if a voter --\nif the legislature passes a statute and someone is -- is\nsatisfied with that statute, how likely is it that that\nperson is going to sign a petition to have a referendum\nto see whether the statute should be blocked?\nMR. BOPP: I think it's very unlikely. But\nit -- we acknowledge it's possible, but we think it's\nvery unlikely.\nJUSTICE ALITO: It's possible --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But --\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- but if you were in the\nreal world, if you were to poll the people who sign a\nreferendum petition with respect to a statute that was\npassed by the State legislature, what percentage do you\nthink would be opposed to that legislation?\nMR. BOPP: Very few.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And so Justice Alito's\nquestion points out that this would be a very slim basis\nupon which to rest a holding in your favor.\nAnd just to go back to the line of questions\nof the first, the State of California has very\ncomplicated referendum and initiative matters. Don't\nyou think it's relevant for the public to know that,\nsay, a public employees union had paid solicitors to put\nthose signatures on the ballot, or that the Chamber of\nCommerce or the National Association of Manufacturers had\npaid solicitors to put this on the ballot?\nIsn't that part of assessing the -- the\nreasons why this initiative was proposed? And isn't\nthat vital to the voters -- to the voter in making an\ninformed decision?\nMR. BOPP: Well, actually, after your\nBuckley II decision, the Ninth Circuit struck down the\nrequirement of disclosing the paid circulators. And, of\ncourse, in California, petitions are not public.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They did that. It wasn't\ndue to Buckley II, because as you just acknowledged,\nunder Buckley II, the solicitor is disclosed.\nMR. BOPP: Well, the Ninth Circuit thought\nit was Buckley.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Correct me, but the point is,\nisn't -- isn't there an interest in knowing this\ninformation? Not -- not that it's paid.\nMR. BOPP: There is no evidence --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: We'll leave that out.\nBut -- but to know that -- that -- the persons that\nsupported the amendment.\nMR. BOPP: There's no evidence in the\nrecord that that is pertinent information, and, at most,\nwe think it is marginal information.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, if we create\nthis right of -- this constitutional right of\nassociation in the manner that you are describing it,\nwhy is it limited to the voting area?\nWould we be inviting review if a group of\ncitizens get together and send a letter to an agency\nthat says please pass X regulation, or rescind Y\nregulation? Would the agency be prohibited from making\nthat letter public?\nMR. BOPP: Well, potentially. And -- and\nthis Court -- I -- because it would be required to be\nsubject to a First Amendment analysis. It's this Court\nthat created, in the NAACP case --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you're -- you're\nsuggesting --\nMR. BOPP: -- the right of private\nassociation.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that when a\npetitioner or a person engages in political discourse\nwith the government, that they -- when they choose to do\nit, because the government is not compelling them to\nwrite to it; it's not compelling them to sign the\nreferendum. It's just --\nMR. BOPP: And they're not compelling\nMs. McIntyre to distribute her brochure, either. But\nthis Court held that --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it's -- but\nMs. McIntyre wasn't asking the government to engage its\nprocess in her favor. She was asking for political\nreform, but she wasn't asking to engage the government\nprocess on her behalf.\nMR. BOPP: Well, the government, you know,\nhas a lot of options. For instance, they don't have to\nconduct elections for the election of judge. But if\nthey opt to do that and provide that procedure, well,\nthen, the First Amendment applies to the political\nspeech.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, to follow up on\nJustice Sotomayor's question, do you think an agency\ncould say, if you want to comment on proposed -- on a\nproposed rule, you have to disclose to us your name and\nyour address and your telephone number and your\npolitical affiliation, and all sorts of -- your marital\nstatus and your income level and all sorts of other\ndemographic information?\nMR. BOPP: And your employer, as in this\ncase here.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could they do that?\nMR. BOPP: No -- no, because there is no\nsufficient governmental interest that would justify it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not even just your name, so\nthey can check that this thing isn't phony and that all\nthe names on it aren't -- aren't made up by one person?\nMR. BOPP: They, of course, can -- can check\nthat.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, they can. So\nthey can get your name, right?\nMR. BOPP: Yes, they can get your name --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. BOPP: -- and we're not objecting to\nfiling of a petition.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you're objecting to\nthe public being able to check whether the agency is\nindeed finding out whether this is a genuine petition or\nnot, correct?\nMR. BOPP: No. No, I'm not objecting to\nthat.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Really?\nMR. BOPP: They have procedures to check and\nverify these signatures that do not involve public\ndisclosure.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Didn't you have some\noptions, too? Have you started a referendum to repeal\nthe -- the California law that requires disclosure?\nMR. BOPP: California law does not require\ndisclosure of the petitions, and that has been upheld by\nthe courts of California. And you can verify these\nsignatures.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand. I\nthought that's what you're challenging. The --\nMR. BOPP: Well, but you asked about\nCalifornia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\nMR. BOPP: -- if I heard your question.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Washington. I got the wrong State.\nMR. BOPP: Okay. It --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can you go back --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The people of\nWashington -- the people Washington evidently think that\nthis is not too much of an imposition upon people's\ncourage, to -- to stand up and sign something and be\nwilling to stand behind it.\nMR. BOPP: In a sense --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now, if you don't like\nthat, I can see doing it another way. But -- but the\npeople of Washington have chosen to do it this -- this\nway.\nMR. BOPP: Actually, for --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you're saying that the\nFirst Amendment absolutely forbids that.\nMR. BOPP: Actually, for a century, they\nchose not to do this. It wasn't until 2006 --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's fine. Proving my\npoint.\nMR. BOPP: They did not publicly disclose\nthe petitions for a century.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It might have been a good\nidea.\nMR. BOPP: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose the -- a\nmajority of the voters in Washington decided that, and\none of the purposes of the First Amendment is to protect\nminorities.\nMR. BOPP: Well, only in the most general\nsense. They adopted a Public Records Act. They didn't\nadopt a law that specifically required the disclosure of\nthese petitions. But in a general sense, they did.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Bopp, this is not a\npeculiar thing to the State of Washington; that's\ncorrect, isn't it? Aren't there about 20-odd States\nthat require disclosure of the names of signers to\ninitiatives, referenda?\nMR. BOPP: That is true. Some -- some in\ntheir initiative and referendum statute, because they\nactually provide some public input on verification where\nWashington does not; others under their Public Records\nAct. Some do not, such as California.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- but what you're\nsaying with respect to Washington would go for most of\nthose other States that have -- that have public\ndisclosure of initiative and referendum petitions.\nMR. BOPP: Well, one -- one thing we say is\ndifferent between Washington and these other States is\nthat Washington provides no way for the public, even if\nthey get access to the petitions, to participate in the\nverification process.\nThe only thing the public can do is have --\nobserve -- a limited number of observers. These\nobservers are prohibited from --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that there were\ninstances where the State official missed something and\na member of the public who had access to the list of\nsigners said: Wait a minute; I know so-and-so was my\nneighbor who died 5 years ago.\nMR. BOPP: That's not allowed in the State\nof Washington. The instructions from the Secretary of\nState is while you can have observers to observe the\nprocess, the people --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you mean if -- that was\nover. It passed the screen of the Secretary of State.\nIt's disclosed to the public. If someone then said\nyou've got a lot of dead souls on these lists, the State\nwould do nothing about it?\nMR. BOPP: There is absolutely no procedure\nunder Washington statute to do anything with that\ninformation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, we'll ask --\nwe'll ask the --\nMR. BOPP: Nothing.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: We'll ask the Attorney\nGeneral of Washington.\nMR. BOPP: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Weren't two of the\nPetitioners here -- weren't two of the Petitioners here\nseeking the list so that they could go over the\ncertification process the State had done to ensure that\nthey had certified all the right people, et cetera?\nMR. BOPP: Well, one of -- one of the\nintervenors sought an exception from the -- from the\ninjunction, which we did not object to, that -- that\nthey would have access to the list. But under\nconfidentiality and protective order --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not going to the\nprivacy questions. You responded to Justice Ginsburg by\nsaying that there was no way to challenge the State's\nprocess of validation, and that -- I don't think that's\ncorrect.\nMR. BOPP: With all respect, I didn't say\nthat.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Oh.\nMR. BOPP: What I -- what I said is there's\nno role for the public in verifying signatures. You can\nask for judicial review --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's assuming the\nanswer, meaning if they don't have the right to access,\nthey can't. But, legally, they can challenge it if they\nfind on the petitions that things were erroneously\ncounted by the State. They can go into court and prove\nthat.\nMR. BOPP: The only thing that they could do\nis request that the court does its own count. In other\nwords, there's judicial review available. But the\npublic has no role in the verification, but they can\ntrigger judicial review. And then the court conducts\nits own count.\nIn other words, this is not an adversary\nprocess in which people come in and present evidence\nof -- of people's -- of invalid signatures.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why would you involve the\ncourt? If the State's -- the executive representative\nof the State says: Oh, we missed that. Now we're going\nto have to deal with it. We don't need any court to\norder us to do it.\nMR. BOPP: Well, the observers can observe\nthe process, and if they feel --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No, this is after the\nobservers. This is --\nMR. BOPP: Well, but --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: We're talking about a member of\nthe public noticing that there are people on the list\nwho shouldn't be there.\nMR. BOPP: Well, the -- the observer --\nunder the Washington procedure, observers can observe\nthe process, and if they feel, or if anyone feels,\nthat there has been an inadequate job in -- in\nverification, then they can ask for judicial review.\nAnd then the court conducts the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why would they ask for\njudicial review instead of going first to the State's\nAttorney General and saying, look, you -- your people\nmissed it?\nMR. BOPP: Well, there's no procedure for\nthat.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why involve the court?\nMR. BOPP: That's not -- there's no\nprocedure for that. You know, if they wanted to involve\nthe public -- and that's the difference, I said, between\nthis procedure and other procedures. They're claiming\nthe need for public disclosure so the public can be\ninvolved in verification. Well, there's no\nprocedure --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't there another --\nMR. BOPP: -- to be involved in verification.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't there another\npossible public interest? Would it be a legitimate public\ninterest to say I'd like to know who signed the\npetition because I would like to try to persuade them\nthat their views should be modified?\nIs there a public interest in encouraging\ndebate on the underlying issue?\nMR. BOPP: Well, it's possible, but we think\nthis information is marginal. In other words, the --\nit's much more important --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it does identify\npeople who have a -- a particular point of view on a\npublic issue. And if you had the other point of view,\ndon't you have an interest in finding out who you'd\nlike to convince to change their minds?\nMR. BOPP: Well, we -- we think it's a -- a\nvery marginal interest. The Ninth Circuit recently\nruled that if you give a small contribution to an\ninitiative, there's not -- I mean, nobody cares. So why\nshould it be publicly disclosed when it's so marginal?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about just -- just --\nwhat about just wanting to know their names so you can\ncriticize them?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BOPP: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is -- is that such a bad\nthing in a democracy?\nMR. BOPP: Well, what is bad is not the\ncriticism; it's the public -- it's the government\nrequiring you to disclose your identity and beliefs.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But part of the reason is\nso you can be out there and be responsible for the\npositions you've taken.\nMR. BOPP: Well, then why don't they require\nboth sides?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So that people -- people\ncan criticize you for the position you have taken.\nMR. BOPP: Then why don't they require both\nsides if that was the purpose?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What do you mean, \"both\nsides\"? The other side hasn't signed anything. When they\nsign something --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BOPP: Well, but the other side --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: When they sign something,\nthey'll be out there for public criticism as well.\nMR. BOPP: Okay. But this is a one-way\nstreet.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, this is such a\ntouchy-feely, oh, so sensitive about -- about any --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You know, you can't run a\ndemocracy this way, with everybody being afraid of\nhaving his political positions known.\nMR. BOPP: I'm sorry, Justice Scalia, but\nthe campaign manager of this initiative had his family\nsleep in his living room because of the threats --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, then that's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's bad. The\nthreats should be moved against vigorously --\nMR. BOPP: And -- and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- but just because there\ncan be criminal activity doesn't mean that you --\nyou have to eliminate a procedure that is\notherwise perfectly reasonable.\nMR. BOPP: But all we're asking for is a\nFirst Amendment analysis of the compelled disclosure of\nthe identity of these people and whether or not these\ninterests are sufficient.\nCould I reserve the balance of my time?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Bopp.\nGeneral McKenna.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL ROBERT M. McKENNA\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. McKENNA: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nI'd like to begin with the question of\nhow the public can bring to the attention of the\ngovernment that errors and fraud have been discovered.\nFirst of all, it's important to understand\nthat the petitions do not become public records after\nthe verification process but, in fact, are made available\nas public records before the verification process even\nbegins.\nThis is because the Secretary of State's\nfirst step after receiving submitted petitions is to\ntake them to his archiving section and to have them\ndigitized. As soon as they're digitized, they're\navailable on disks for anyone who requests them. Then\nthe verification process begins.\nDuring the verification process, it is\npossible --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How much time are we\ntalking about in those processes?\nMR. McKENNA: The verification process,\nJustice Sotomayor?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes.\nMR. McKENNA: The verification process\nwill depend on how many signatures have been\nsubmitted --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no, no. I'm trying\nto get the relationship between the disks being made\navailable and the verification process.\nSo is there a time for the public to look\nthrough the disks before the people who are sent into\nthe room are sent into the room?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's what you've just\nsaid --\nMR. McKENNA: Yes, they're --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that they're --\nthat they are immediately available on the disk, and\nso while the checking is going on by the Secretary,\nthe public has the list. Is that what you've just said?\nMR. McKENNA: Yes, that's correct. For\nexample, in the case of Referendum 71, the proponents of\nthe referendum submitted the petition sheets on\nSaturday, July 25, 2009, and on Tuesday, July 28, a\nrecords request was already submitted. And so they\ncan obtain records --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would these\nrecords --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Was that pursuant to the\nPublic Records Act that we're talking about --\nMR. McKENNA: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- or was that part of the\ninitiative and referendum structure before the Public\nRecords Act was passed?\nMR. McKENNA: Justice Kennedy, this is\npart of the Public Records Act. This is as a result of\nthe Public Records Act that these petition sheets are\nmade available.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So -- all right. So\nthis -- the public record -- pardon me. The -- in\nCalifornia, we call it an initiative and referendum\nprocess -- existed and was in place before the Public\nRecords Act added this additional feature of disclosure?\nMR. McKENNA: Yes, that's correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So there was a judgment at\none time by the State of Washington that it didn't --\nthat it didn't need the public records disclosure?\nMR. McKENNA: Well, when the initiative\nand referendum processes were created by public vote on\na constitutional amendment of 1912, there was no\nPublic Records Act at all. And the Public Records Act,\nan Act of general applicability, was adopted by the\nvoters in 1973 as part of an initiative which also\nenacted comprehensive campaign finance reform.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if the\nState had a law that you could disclose voters and for\nwhom they voted, would that implicate First Amendment\ninterests?\nMR. McKENNA: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, we\nwould -- we do believe that First Amendment interests\nwould be implicated by revealing how people voted, and\nwe don't see a legitimate State interest in knowing how\npeople voted, only in who voted.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So the country was acting\nunconstitutionally for a whole century before we adopted\nthe Australian secret ballot? Do you really think that?\nMR. McKENNA: No. No, Justice Scalia. I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That it was\nunconstitutional --\nMR. McKENNA: No, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- for a whole century\nnot to have a secret ballot?\nMR. McKENNA: No, Justice Scalia, I\ndidn't say that I thought that the secret ballot was\nconstitutionally required. I was asked by the Chief\nJustice whether some First Amendment interests would be\nimplicated. They probably would be.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What would the First\nAmendment interests be?\nMR. McKENNA: Well, the First Amendment\ninterest in how you vote?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. McKENNA: You know, it might be\nimplicated by a potential chill from voting, if you know\nyour vote is going to be revealed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think having\nyour name revealed on a petition of this sort might have\na chilling effect on whether you sign it?\nMR. McKENNA: Mr. Chief Justice, some\nchill may result, just as some chill may result from\nhaving your campaign contributions disclosed or the\nfact that you have registered to vote and provided your\nname, address, your voting history is being disclosed.\nSo some chill might be -- might result, but we do not\nthink that it is significant enough.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't think\nrevealing that you're a voter has the same chilling\neffect as revealing how you voted, do you?\nMR. McKENNA: No, I do not. I think how\nyou voted would have a much greater chilling effect than\nthe fact that you are registered to vote.\nAnd -- and, of course, this Court has not\nruled on whether the secret ballot is, you know, a\nconstitutional right. If -- if it is, then is town hall\nvoting in New England unconstitutional? Is the caucus\nsystem in Iowa for presidential candidates\nunconstitutional? The Court in this case does not\nhave --\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- in the last questions --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought you\ntold me that the First Amendment interests were implicated\nwith respect to the secret ballot, that you couldn't\nrequire people to reveal how they voted.\nMR. McKENNA: We don't -- we don't know\nif this Court would rule that the vote could never be\nrevealed. We know that in some places, votes are done\nin public. We know that before the late 1800s, there\nwas no secret ballot. We just -- we don't know what the\nconstitutional ruling would be. But we -- we do know\nthat in this case, it's not necessary for the Court to\nreach that -- that determination, because in this\ncase --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I'd like to know\nhow far you -- you are -- you want to go. You say in\nyour brief that the availability of the referendum\nsignature petitions allows Washington voters to engage\nin discussion of referred measures with persons whose\nacts secured the election and suspension of State law.\nSo would -- would it be consistent with the\nFirst Amendment to require anybody who signs a petition\nto put down not just the person's name and address, but\nalso telephone number, so that they could be engaged in\na conversation about what they had done?\nMR. McKENNA: It -- it would depend on\nthe strength of the State interest in having the\ntelephone number. The State does not have an interest\nin the telephone number on the petition form, because\nthe State has -- only needs to know from the petition\nform the name and the address in order to verify --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I thought that you were\nsaying that one of the interests that's served by this\nis to allow people who -- to allow Washington citizens\nto discuss this matter with those who signed the\npetition. So putting down the telephone number would\nassist them in doing that.\nMR. McKENNA: It -- yes, it probably\nwould make it easier for people to contact.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So you would --\nMR. McKENNA: But the policy --\nMR. McKENNA: That would be a policy\ndetermination for the legislature to make,\nJustice Alito.\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, I'm not asking the\npolicy question. I'm asking whether the First Amendment\nwould permit that.\nMR. McKENNA: I believe it could permit\nthat, yes, Justice Alito.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Now, one of your\nCo-Respondents says that supplying this information\nprovides insight whether support comes predominantly\nfrom members of particular political or religious\norganizations.\nWould it be consistent with the First\nAmendment to require anybody who signs a petition to\nlist the person's religion?\nMR. McKENNA: No, I do not believe it\nwould, Justice Alito.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose that in 1957 in\nLittle Rock, a group of Little Rock citizens had wanted\nto put on the ballot a petition to require the school\nboard to reopen Central High School, which had been\nclosed because there was a sentiment in the community\nthat they didn't want integration. And it was pointed\nout that if they signed this petition, there was a very\ngood chance that their businesses would be bombed, that\nthey would certainly be boycotted, that their children\nmight be harassed.\nNow, is there no First Amendment right in\nprotecting those people? And if there is, how does it\ndiffer from your case?\nMR. McKENNA: Justice Breyer, that is\ncount 2. That is count 2 of the Petitioners'\ncomplaint. This Court ruled as recently as Citizens\nUnited that such situations should be evaluated on a\ncase-by-case basis to evaluate the reasonable\nprobability of threats, harassments, and reprisals. But\nthat --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you -- you would have no\nobjection to as an-applied challenge to disclosing the\nnames of individuals to a particular cause, where it is\ndemonstrated that the opponents of that cause are\nviolent and will do violence to the people who signed\nthe petition?\nMR. McKENNA: Yes, Justice Scalia. That\nwould be the Socialist Workers Party case. This -- this\nCourt has ruled that, on a case-by-case basis, it is\npossible that some information otherwise disclosed --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What about a business\nboycott?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So this is just a general\nchallenge to ever, ever disclosing the names of petition\nsigners?\nMR. McKENNA: Of any type of petition\nincluding nominating petitions --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. McKENNA: -- initiative petitions,\nand the rest.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What about a business\nboycott? Suppose that were a -- a likely outcome of\ndisclosing the name?\nMR. McKENNA: Well, of course, boycotts\nhave been upheld under the First Amendment in Claiborne\nHardware, and so if someone wanted to boycott a business\nbecause it turned out that the manager of the business\nhad been a supporter of a particular ballot measure,\nthat would be allowable, of course, to that person\nchoosing to boycott.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, your answer\nto Justice Breyer was that they can bring an as-applied\nchallenge. Now, that as-applied challenge would be\nsmall comfort unless the names were protected pending\nthe resolution of that challenge, correct?\nMR. McKENNA: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think a stay\nshould be granted in this case to allow the Petitioners\nto pursue an as-applied challenge.\nMR. McKENNA: Yes, of course -- yes,\nthey could apply for another preliminary injunction if\nthis Court upholds the court of appeals. They were able\nto obtain that preliminary injunction in this case,\nwhich is why these petition forms have not been released\nto date, except under a protective order by the court to\nthe opponents.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And that would --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think that\nthe disclosure of the names, pending the resolution of\ntheir as-applied challenge, would subject them to\nincidents of violence and intimidation?\nMR. McKENNA: We -- there is no evidence\nof that in the record. There's no evidence --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Does -- is it --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's no\nevidence -- there's no evidence of episodes of violence\nor intimidation?\nMR. McKENNA: Involving the\nReferendum 71 signers? No. The evidence in the record\nis about people who were out circulating petitions,\npeople who were out, you know, campaigning for the\npetitions, the campaign manager for the measure. But\nnone of the evidence in the record speaks to petition\nsigners, and none of the evidence in the record speaks\nto petition signers for other, similar measures which\nwere cited by the Petitioners.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that because nobody\ngot to count 2? And the district court -- this whole\ncase in the lower courts was on count 1 alone; wasn't\nthat so?\nMR. McKENNA: Yes, that is -- yes, that\nis correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And count 2 is the one\nthat deals with the harassment.\nMR. McKENNA: That is true,\nJustice Ginsburg. Of course, in several other States,\nArkansas, Florida, and Massachusetts, which had similar\nmeasures regarding gay civil rights or same-sex marriage\non the ballot -- in those three States, the petition\nforms were obtained under public records, were put on\nthe Internet, and no evidence has been provided that's\nin the record that anyone who signed any of those\npetitions in those three States was subjected to\nharassment --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, let's say somebody is\nthinking of circulating a petition on a sensitive\nsubject and fears that people may be dissuaded from\nsigning because they fear retaliation. At what point\ncould they bring this as-applied challenge?\nDo they have to -- could they do it before\nthey even begin to circulate the petition, arguing that\nif -- if these names -- if people are not assured ahead\nof time that their name and address is not going to be\nrevealed to the public on the Internet, they're not\ngoing to sign this?\nMR. McKENNA: Justice Alito, it would be\npossible procedurally for them to bring the motion for\nan injunction even before collecting the signatures --\nJUSTICE ALITO: And how would they --\nMR. McKENNA: -- if they had sufficient\nevidence.\nJUSTICE ALITO: How would they prove that\nthere's -- that there's a -- a threat, a sufficient\nthreat of harassment in that particular case, before the\npetition is even signed?\nMR. McKENNA: I believe that the\nsponsors of the measure would bring to the court\nevidence, if they have any, of -- because of the\ncontroversial nature of that particular measure, that is\nbased on what's happened to some of the people who were\nplanning to put the measure on the ballot.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but you -- you've\nrejected that here. You've said there's no evidence here\nthat any of the petition -- petition signers were\nsubjected to any harassment.\nMR. McKENNA: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course there isn't,\nbecause the names haven't gotten out yet. How could you\npossibly demonstrate before the names get out that\npetition signers are going to be subjected to\nharassment?\nMR. McKENNA: One could look to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or otherwise, don't insist\nupon evidence that these very petition signers will be\nharassed.\nMR. McKENNA: I imagine, Justice Scalia,\nthat the individuals moving for that preliminary\ninjunction would do what the Petitioners have done in\nthis case. They would cite to an example from another\nState involving a comparable measure.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you think that would be\nan acceptable type of evidence?\nMR. McKENNA: They could bring it into the\ncourt. I'm not saying the court would accept it,\nbecause I don't know --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if you don't think\nit's acceptable, then -- then -- then you're not making\nan argument.\nMR. McKENNA: Justice Scalia, I didn't\nsay it couldn't be acceptable. I'm saying this is a\nhypothetical, so I don't know what the evidence would\nlook like in the hypothetical example.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, the -- the\nhypothetical is that before this petition is circulated,\nthe supporters came into court, and they said: Look what\nhas happened in California with -- with Proposition 8.\nDon't disclose -- enter an order prohibiting the public\ndisclosure of the names and addresses here.\nWould that be sufficient?\nMR. McKENNA: Justice Alito, I think\nthat the evidence would have to be very strong. It\nwould have to rise above criticism. I think it would\nhave to rise to the level of threatened violence. It\nwould have to rise to the level of the Socialist Workers\nParty case, for example, or the NAACP case.\nI think the standard would be very high.\nBut it would be up to the trial judge to decide whether\nor not the evidence was sufficient to issue the\npreliminary injunction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it -- the State has\nhad this procedure now for some time, and there have\nbeen controversial ballot initiatives. Is there any\nhistory in the State of Washington that signers have\nbeen subject to harassment?\nMR. McKENNA: There has not,\nJustice Ginsburg, and that's even though a half a dozen\ninitiatives on a variety of topics have been released.\nAnother half dozen are pending.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what's the\nmost sensitive similar petition for a referendum?\nMR. McKENNA: There has been no measure\non domestic partner benefits or same-sex marriage in\nWashington State --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but what's the --\nMR. McKENNA: -- but there are other --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's -- what's\nthe other one that's going to get people -- that's the\nmost controversial public issue?\nMR. McKENNA: Justice --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Proposition 8?\nMR. McKENNA: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I'm talking\nabout in Washington, counsel.\nMR. McKENNA: In Washington State.\nMr. Chief Justice, we have had measures on assisted\nsuicide, for example, which was very controversial,\nand -- and there's no evidence involving that set of\npetitions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Was the referendum\nin favor or opposed to assisted suicide?\nMR. McKENNA: It was -- well, the\nreferendum challenges the assisted suicide law. So if\nyou vote for the referendum, you vote to uphold the\nlegislature's adoption of that law, which -- which\nallowed assisted suicide.\nSo there have been controversial measures.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: This case will likely be\ncontrolled by our First Amendment precedents, because\nthat's the most fully developed.\nDid you look at the Petition Clause at all?\nIn the early days of the republic, the petitions were\nthe way in which you communicated with your legislator.\nMR. McKENNA: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I tried to look it up.\nI have a recollection, but I'm not sure, that those\npetitions were sometimes put in the Congressional\nRecord. But did you look at the history of the Petition\nClause?\nMR. McKENNA: Justice Kennedy, we have\nconsidered the history of the Petition Clause, and we\nsee a basic difference between the kinds of petitions\nunder the Petition Clause and the petitions at issue\nhere because, essentially, petitioning the government\nunder the Petition Clause is asking the government to do\nsomething. You're petitioning them: Please do\nsomething.\nThe petitions for a referendum or an\ninitiative are telling the government to do something.\nThe petition form says that I, the signer, am directing\nthe Secretary of State to conduct an election. And by\nsubmitting these petitions in a referendum, I am\nsuspending the law which the legislature has already\napproved until the election has taken place.\nTell versus ask. I think that's a pretty\nbig -- a significant difference.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But, of course, that can\ncut the other way, too, because then it's more like a\nvote. And there -- there is strong interest in keeping\nthe -- the vote private.\nMR. McKENNA: And, Justice Kennedy, I'd\nlike to speak to that question, because several\nJustices asked: Well, what can we tell from what, you\nknow, someone who signed? Do we know how they're going\nto vote.\nI -- I agree that many people signing a\npetition are going to vote in favor of -- in the case of\nan initiative, in favor of the law the initiative would\nput on the ballot. But also we know from the social\nscience research, which is cited, for example, in the\nDirect Democracy Scholars green brief, that many people\nsign simply because they believe it's important for\nthe -- for the public to have an opportunity to vote.\nAnd, of course, as the Petitioners have acknowledged and\nwe also point out, some people vote just to get around the\ncirculator and get into the store.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What percentage --\nwhat percentage of the people who signed this petition\nto put this law on the referendum do you think signed it\nbecause they think these sort of things should be\ngenerally put to a public vote as opposed to because\nthey opposed the law?\nMR. McKENNA: The percentage of people\nwho believe simply that there should be a vote held has\nnot been quantified by the research, except that several\nscholars indicate that it is significant. So, whether\nit's 20 percent or 40 percent, I -- I really can't say\nwithin a certain --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You think as much as\n20 percent of the people who signed this petition are\nactually in favor of the law that it's aimed to repeal?\nMR. McKENNA: It is possible. But it's\nalso possible some of those 20 percent don't have an\nopinion on the law, Mr. Chief Justice. They simply\nthink that there should be a vote held, and they'll\nmake their mind up later on.\nThere are plenty of people who aren't aware\nwhen certain laws are -- are adopted that are subjected\nto a referendum, and they may not have decided at all.\nIn fact, one of the reasons they may sign the petition\nis to say: Well, I'm not sure how I'm going to vote,\nbut, you know, I think a public vote would be a good\nidea. So, I'm going to let it go forward to be on the\nballot, and I'll decide.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you this question?\nIt seems to me your -- the strongest State interest here\nis detecting fraud. And you mentioned that the records\nare digitized. And maybe you can correct my impression\nof this, but it seems to me that if the records are\ndigitized, there are very simple ways of detecting fraud\nthat would not require the disclosure of the list to the\npublic.\nIf somebody wants to see whether his or her\nname has been fraudulently put on the list, wouldn't it\nbe very simple to set up a Web site where the person\ncould put in a little bit of identifying information and\nsee whether that person's name is on the list? And if\nthe -- the purpose is to see whether a particular person\nlives at a particular address, couldn't you just\ncross-reference by means of a computer program the\ninformation on the referendum with the -- with the\nvoting lists?\nSo if you've got John Jones who lives at 10\nMain Street, you see whether there really is a\nregistered voter John Jones who lives at 10 Main Street?\nWhy does this all have to be put out on the Internet?\nMR. McKENNA: Justice Alito, the -- just\nto be clear, you are right. They do use computer --\ncomputers because when -- in the verification process,\nthe Secretary of State's staff, with the observers looking\nover their shoulder, will look at the petition and look\nup that voter in an -- in an electronic voter\nregistration database.\nThis is exactly why the information is so\nuseful to the public as well. They have access to\nelectronic online voter registration history as well,\nand they can also check.\nIn -- in Massachusetts, under their public\nrecords law in 2006, petition forms obtained by public\nrecords requests were put online, and over 2,000 people,\nas has been documented in the Lambda amicus brief,\ndiscovered that they -- their names are on petitions\nthat they claimed did not sign, and discovered that they\nhad been, in some cases, misled.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what's the answer to\nmy question? Couldn't you -- couldn't this be done very\nsimply? If I want to see whether somebody has\nfraudulently signed my name, very quickly go to a\nWeb site, wouldn't be expensive to set up, put in your\nvoter ID number, and see whether -- and your name, and\nsee whether you're on the -- on the --\nMR. McKENNA: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- whether you --\nsomebody signed your name to the petition?\nMR. McKENNA: Yes, Justice Alito,\nthat -- that could be done. In our State and the\nother States that's done when somebody requests the public\nrecords and chooses them to put online. The State\ndoesn't -- does not put the petition forms online\nitself, although, you know, other information is put\nonline by the State.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do -- do we take this case\non the assumption -- do you make the contention before\nus that the Secretary of State and those who assist it\nare not capable of determining whether the petition\nsignatures are valid?\nMR. McKENNA: No, we are not taking\nthat position, Justice Kennedy. Of course --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean without public\ndisclosure?\nMR. McKENNA: What we know,\nJustice Kennedy, is that in dozens of States around\nthe -- around the country, as recently as 2009 in\nMaryland, 2006 in Massachusetts, and so on, it was\nthe -- it was the public who requested ballot petitions\nby public records request who found significant fraud\nand error. This isn't just about fraud -- fraud is very\nimportant -- it's also about finding plain old mistakes\nwhich the State, Secretary of State, or auditor has\nmissed.\nThat -- that does happen with regularity in\nthis country, and we cite cases in our brief where error\nis not fraud, but errors in Washington State have been\ndiscovered by people who look at these public records.\nAnd --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Sometimes the public may\nnot trust the Secretary of State.\nMR. McKENNA: Yes, sir. Justice Scalia,\nwe agree.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It -- it may be an issue in\nwhich his administration has taken a particularly firm\nstand, and the public may not trust the job that the\nSecretary of State does.\nMR. McKENNA: That goes to the heart to\nthe Public Records Act, Justice Scalia: Trust but\nverify. The people did not leave to the State the idea\nthat, well, we'll let you know what you need to know.\nThe people want a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Trust but verify -- I like\nthat.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You did say something\nabout this category of speech. You said, well, this is\nin the category that -- it's like O'Brien. It has speech\nelements and non-speech elements. And I was trying to\nfigure out which -- what is it in the signature that\nspeaks and what is it in the signature that doesn't\nspeak?\nMR. McKENNA: The speech element could\nbe construed in the fact that someone has chosen to sign\na petition which we know means they want something to be\nput on the ballot. So, they favor having it on the\nballot. That -- that much we know.\nBut we also looked to Burdick, of course,\nbecause in this -- in -- in the Burdick decision this\nCourt held that write-in voting could be prohibited by\nthe State of Hawaii. That was upheld by the court of\nappeals and this Court. And this Court found that\nwriting in a candidate's name was not even expressive\nconduct.\nSo we look to the Burdick level of\nintermediate scrutiny, to the O'Brien level of\nintermediate scrutiny for the test.\nJustice Ginsburg, the other point I wanted\nto bring up is something about Buckley II, which --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what is the -- to finish\nyour answer to Justice Ginsburg's question, what is the\nnon-speech component of signing a petition?\nMR. McKENNA: The non-speech component\nis suspension of law in the case of a referendum or the\nlegislative effect. We believe this is a legislative\nact fundamentally. In --\nJUSTICE ALITO: And what's the State's interest\nin regulating the non-speech component? When you --\nwhen you talk about the vote cast by an elected\nrepresentative, of course, there's a strong interest in\nknowing how an elected representative voted, because the\nrepresentative is answerable to the voters. But\nsomebody who signs a petition isn't answerable to\nanybody -- any other citizen. So what's your interest?\nMR. McKENNA: The interest, Justice\nAlito, is knowing, first of all, that there were a\nsufficient number of signatures submitted to qualify the\nmeasure for the ballot.\nJUSTICE ALITO: It's the fraud interest?\nMR. McKENNA: That's the fraud interest.\nAnd, secondly, there is a valid informational\ninterest in knowing who is it exactly who's calling for\nthis election and suspending the --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, but how far does that\ngo? When I asked whether you could -- you want to know\nthe religion of the people who signed, no, you can't do\nthat. How much more demographic information could be\n-- could be -- does the -- does the State of\nWashington have an interest in making publicly available\nabout the people who support this election?\nLet's say it's -- it's a referendum about\nimmigration. Does the State of Washington have an\ninterest in providing information to somebody who says\nI want to know how many people with Hispanic names\nsigned this, or how many people with Asian names signed\nthis? Is that -- that what you want to facilitate?\nMR. McKENNA: No, Justice Alito, we\ndon't need to know that. We need to know whether there\nwere a sufficient number of registered voters who\nsigned -- we need to know whether they signed more than\nonce. We need to know they are registered in Washington\nState.\nInformational interest I think that you could\n-- the information you could collect to satisfy\ninformational interest might include other information\nthat's in the voter registration records. You might\nwant to know --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought one of the\nreasons you wanted to do this was so people would have\ninformation that would allow them to participate in the\ncivic process, and there are people who -- might think\nit makes a difference whether a referendum was requested\nby -- primarily by members of a particular ethnic group\nor not. So isn't -- doesn't -- I thought your brief\nwould say the State has an interest in that type of\ndisclosure.\nMR. McKENNA: I don't see what the valid\nState interest would be of knowing the ethnicity of the\nperson. I mean, of course, anyone could look at the\npetition ballot forms and, I suppose, divine something about\nthe ethnicity based on the last name, but the State's\ninterest doesn't go -- go to that. That we -- we\ndon't believe we need to know that. We believe we need\nto know what is requested -- required on the -- on the\npetition form.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Then I don't understand what\ninformation is being -- what information you think you're\nproviding to the public. Outside of the fraud area,\nif I see that John Jones from Seattle signed this\npetition, that tells me absolutely nothing.\nMR. McKENNA: Well, Justice Alito, it\nmight -- if you know John Jones, that would tell you\nsomething. Number two, we know from the -- we know from\nthe, you know, Direct Democracy Scholars green brief\nthat intermediaries and especially the press and\nsometimes social science researchers and others will --\nwill look at the names, and they'll be able to tell,\nfor example, that a large number of employees at one\ncompany signed a measure; maybe it's a measure that would cut\na tax break for a particular industry. Or perhaps members\nof a union, in large numbers, have signed. They have been --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How can they --\nMR. McKENNA: -- able to provide\nthat information.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How can they find that out\nwith just the name and address, that a large number of people\nfrom a company signed it?\nMR. McKENNA: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't have to\nput on who you work for, do you?\nMR. McKENNA: No, you do not. I'm\nsaying intermediaries might discover this, for example,\nby taking a close look at who's paying for the\nsignature gathering. If it's paid signature gathering,\nthey might be aware of prominent sponsors. In fact,\nthe -- the importance of knowing who the sponsors is, is\ndemonstrated --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. I'm still\non the companies. How -- how does knowing who the\nsponsors are tell you how many people from a particular\ncompany signed the petition?\nMR. McKENNA: Well, a voter who -- who\nworks at that same company or does business with that\nsame company might know that, gosh, I know these\nemployees, and they've -- they have all signed this\npetition. The press might be able to do the research to\nfind that out. Intermediaries do play an important role.\nThe last point, if I may, I wanted to make\nabout -- about Buckley II is that the Petitioners have\nstressed that Buckley II struck down the requirement to wear\nthe name badge. But in that same decision this Court\nupheld the requirement by Colorado that affidavits\nsigned by the petition circulators, including the\npetition circulator's name and address, can be disclosed\nas public records.\nAnd the Court ruled that -- found that and\ncompared it favorably to the badge requirement because\nthe disclosures of public record occurred after the heat\nof the moment, after the moment of interactive discussion.\nIt happened later on. And we believe, of all the Court's\nrulings, that -- that approval of the disclosure requirement\nof the -- of the affidavit, in contrast to the badges, is the\nmost similar to requiring after the fact or allowing\nafter the fact for petitions to be disclosed under the\nPublic Records Act.\nJUSTICE ALITO: You know, if somebody called\nyour office and said I'd like the -- the home\naddress of all the attorneys who work in the Attorney\nGeneral's Office because we want to -- we want to go to\ntheir homes and have uncomfortable conversations with\nthem --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- which is what has been\nalleged here, would you release that information?\nMR. McKENNA: We would not, Justice\nAlito. We would not release it because they can come to\nthe office and have uncomfortable conversations with\nthem --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. McKENNA: -- which I can personally\nattest happens with some regularity.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that information, at\nleast the names of those people -- isn't it probably\npublic information anyway?\nMR. McKENNA: Yes, it is,\nJustice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can it be obtained under\nthe Freedom of Information Act in this case?\nMR. McKENNA: Yes, it can. Their names,\ntheir office locations, their office phone numbers,\ntheir office e-mails is all a matter of public record in\nour State.\nThank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General\nMcKenna.\nMr. Bopp, you have 2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES BOPP, JR.,\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. BOPP: Thank you. First a clarification\nof what we sought in the preliminary injunction. We\nwere -- we sought to base our preliminary injunction on\nboth count 1 and count 2. Of course, the district\ncourt and the Ninth Circuit did not reach -- in either\ncase -- reach count 2.\nSecondly, with respect to whether or not\nthere's any conduct here, I don't think signing a\nwritten statement is conduct. And, of course, by signing\nthe statement, the person is adopting the statement on\nthe petition, one of which involves their preference on\nthe referendum, and the second is the -- the request\nthat the matter goes on the ballot. And, of course, it has\nno legal effect unless 122,000 make the same political\nstatement.\nThird, evidence of harassment comes in,\nas in Citizens United, because the weight of the\ninterest that is required depends upon the burden of the\nFirst Amendment -- to the First Amendment speech\ninvolved; and this Court specifically referred in\nCitizens United to the lack of evidence of harassment of\nthe donors that might occur if they were disclosed\nthrough the reports which Citizens United upheld.\nHere we do have evidence of harassment, and\nwe believe that that requires a greater burden in the\nFirst Amendment analysis --\nJUSTINE GINSBURG: But that's out of the\ncase up till now. That's count 2. You put it in your\npleading, but it wasn't reached by the court.\nMR. BOPP: Actually not. Many is the case --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So everybody agrees\nthat that's still in the case.\nMR. BOPP: Yes, but it is relevant to count\n1. Bates, for instance, looked to the evidence of\nharassment in protecting the membership list of the\nNAACP from disclosure.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The court did not rule on\nwhether there was a risk of harassment here.\nMR. BOPP: Well, that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It dealt only with count 1.\nMR. BOPP: That is -- that is true, Your Honor.\nThere are -- there were several First Amendment claims\nmade -- made under count 1, and this decision was --\nwas based on other claims.\nI see my time is up. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Bopp.\n"
