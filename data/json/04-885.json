        "content": "[11:00 a.m.]\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument next in\nCentral Virginia Community College versus Katz.\nMr. Thro.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM E. THRO\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMR. THRO: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the\nCourt:\nThis case involves a conflict between two\nconstitutional values. On the one hand, Congress has the\nsovereign power to make laws which apply to everyone, including\nthe States. On the other hand, the States have sovereign\nimmunity from all aspects of suit.\nIn the past, this Court has reconciled this conflict\nby drawing a line between sovereign power and sovereign\nimmunity. States are bound by Federal law, but the States are\nimmune from monetary damages for violations of those laws.\nIn the bankruptcy context, this line means the\nStates are bound by the discharge decisions, but that the States\nare immune from the trustee's attempts to augment the estate\nthrough monetary judgment.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Can you tell us how often States\nare creditors in bankruptcies around the country? Do you have\nany idea?\nMR. THRO: There is some information to that effect\nin the amicus brief of Ohio and every other State of the Union,\nJustice O'Connor, but my recollection is that the States are\ncreditors in probably the majority of bankruptcies around the\ncountry.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: So, if you're correct, how would\nthe result you want affect all the other creditors in these\nbankruptcies?\nMR. THRO: It would have some impact on the other\ncreditors, in that you would not be able to augment the estate\nby collecting a monetary judgment from the State.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And probably, on your theory,\nStates can disregard the automatic stay that issues --\nMR. THRO: No, not at all --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- when a bankruptcy --\nMR. THRO: -- Your Honor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- commences?\nMR. THRO: No. Under our -- under our theory, the\n-- theory, the States are bound by the automatic stay. The\nStates are also bound by --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: How is that, on your theory?\nMR. THRO: Well, because --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Why wouldn't the sovereign\nimmunity extend to that?\nMR. THRO: The automatic stay is an exercise of\nsovereign -- of the sovereign power of Congress, just as the\ndischarge decisions of a bankruptcy court are an exercise of the\nsovereign power of Congress. The States are bound by the\ndischarge decisions. States are also bound by the automatic\nstay. Where we draw the line is where the trustee attempts to\nget a monetary judgment as a means of augmenting the estate,\nwhich is what is happening with this case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, why don't we say that that's\nthe exercise of the sovereign power of commerce, just -- of\nCongress, just like you said? That --\nMR. THRO: The automatic --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, it seems that that answer\nis just conclusory, that it's an exercise of the sovereign power\nof Congress, okay. That's just -- that's just a conclusion.\nThat's not a reason.\nMR. THRO: Yes, Your Honor. The -- this Court's\ndecisions have struck a balance between respecting the need for\nthe States to obey Federal law and, at the same time, respecting\nthe constitutional value of the States' sovereign immunity.\nWhat we have here in -- with respect to the automatic stay and\nwith respect to the discharge decisions, is States being bound\nby Federal law, no different than the States being bound by the\nminimum wage law, for example. But what we have with respect to\nthe trustee's attempts to augment the estate by collecting a\nmonetary judgment against the States is an attempt to invade the\nState treasury, which this Court's decisions clearly state is\nbarred by sovereign immunity.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Tell me, if you're -- if you're\nright -- let's suppose you're right. I'm over here. That's --\n[Laughter.]\nMR. THRO: Sorry, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's all right. So, it's hard to\nfigure out, because the direction -- you can't tell by the\nsound. I don't know if there's a modern system that would help\nwith that, but -- you're right.\nSuppose that the State -- suppose you're right.\nWhat I'd worry about -- and I'd like your response to this -- is\nthat in bankruptcies, or weak firms -- a lot of firms are weak,\nand they owe a lot of money to the States. So, the States\nfigure this out after a while. It takes a few years to seep\nthrough, but once they see what they can do, they say, \"Here's\nwhat we'll do. Settle your claims against the State, which\nhappen to be pretty good, for 50 cents on the dollar. Give us\nthe money. And you're -- we're out of it.\" So, they settle it.\nA month later, bankrupt.\nNow, two things have happened. The States got 50\ncents on the dollar, every other creditor gets 5 cents on the\ndollar, because they were a month ahead of it. The second thing\nthat happened is, the creditor -- the firm lost the chance to\ncome in and be rehabilitated. So, the result of this is two bad\nthings: bankruptcy's law's basic purpose, to treat creditors\nfairly, bankruptcy law's basic purpose, to give firms a chance\nto rehabilitate, are both seriously undermined. So, given the\nBankruptcy Clause in the Constitution, how is it possible to say\nthat Congress does not have the power to prevent those two very,\nvery seriously harmful results -- harmful in terms of the basic\npurpose of the Bankruptcy Clause?\nMR. THRO: Your Honor, the Constitution --\nspecifically, the eleventh amendment -- confirms that the States\nare not to be treated like private parties. Private parties are\nnot immune from contract actions; States are. Private parties\nare not immune from torts -- from tort actions.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But there is not a Tort Clause of\nthe United States Constitution. There is not a Contract Clause.\nAnd there is a Bankruptcy Clause.\nMR. THRO: There is a Bankruptcy Clause, Your Honor,\nand that clause empowers Congress to make bankruptcy laws which\napply throughout the entire Nation and which apply to the\nStates. However, the Bankruptcy Clause does not authorize\nCongress to abrogate the State's sovereign immunity from suit.\nWhen -- while abrogation can be accomplished using other\nprovisions, it cannot be accomplished using the bankruptcy\nprovision.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Bankruptcy Clause presumably does\nnot allow Congress to set up the bankruptcy law in such a way\nthat it would amount to a taking of property without just\ncompensation, right? Wouldn't allow another constitution to be\nviolated. So the only question here is whether the\nconstitutional protection of States' sovereign immunity can be\ntaken away by the Bankruptcy Clause; whereas, other provisions\nclearly can't, right?\nMR. THRO: Yes, Your Honor. And this Court said, in\nSeminole Tribe, that the Article 1 powers could not be used to\ntake away, or to abrogate, the States' sovereign immunity. Now,\nobviously, section 5 of the fourteenth amendment can be used to\ndo it, but there is no suggestion that Congress used section 5\nof the fourteenth amendment in enacting its attempt to abrogate\nsovereign immunity.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But, may I ask, how do you -- how\ndo you reach the conclusion that you're bound by the automatic\nstay and the discharge? Why aren't those also an infringement\nof State sovereignty?\nMR. THRO: I think there is a strong argument which\ncan be made that both the automatic stay and the discharge\ndecisions infringe upon State sovereignty. However, this\nCourt's decisions, dating back to at least New York versus\nIrving Trust in 1933, have made it clear that the States are\nbound by the provisions of the discharge orders. I think, also,\nthe automatic stay is something similar to the Ex Parte Young\ndoctrine, in terms of the States being enjoined from doing\nsomething else. However --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: To say -- to say that the State\ncan't be sued is not the same thing as saying that the State can\nsue, is it? You --\nMR. THRO: No, it's not, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- you can prevent the State from\nsuing, even though you can't sue the State. There's no\nincompatibility, is there?\nMR. THRO: No, there's not, Your Honor. What we\nhave --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, do you -- do you agree that\nthere are situations where, notwithstanding the sovereign\nimmunity of States, there can be in rem jurisdiction in a court\nto resolve claims against property --\nMR. THRO: Certain --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- and bind the State, as well?\nMR. THRO: Certainly, this Court's decisions\nindicate that, in some instances, there can be in rem decisions\nwhich --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, maybe bankruptcy estates\nare one such instance.\nMR. THRO: As this Court noted in Hood, the\nbankruptcy decisions regarding the discharge are in rem and, of\ncourse, are binding upon the State. But what we have here is\nnot an in rem proceeding. As this Court noted in Nordic\nVillage, an action to recover a preferential transfer claim is\nnot an in rem proceeding. Rather, as this Court noted in\nSchoenthal versus Irving Trust in 1932, and Granfinanciera\nversus Nordberg in 1989, actions to recover preferential\ntransfer are much like actions to recover a contract claim.\nThat is, like a contract claim, they do not involve the core\nbankruptcy proceedings, but, rather, involve matters that are --\nor controversies that are tangential to the core bankruptcy\nproceedings. They're nothing more than an attempt to augment\nthe State.\nAnd where we would draw the line, and where we\npropose that this Court draws -- draw the line -- and a line\nthat we believe is consistent with this Court's previous\ndecisions -- is that the States are bound by discharge, the\nStates are subject to the automatic stay, but the trustees'\nattempts to obtain monetary judgments, and thereby augment the\nvalue of the estate, are barred by sovereign immunity.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Wouldn't it at least be\ntheoretically possible to differentiate between setting aside a\npreference, on the one hand, and just bringing a suit for a tort\nor a breach of contact, on the other? One could treat the\nassets that are -- were transferred prematurely -- or hastily,\nwhatever you call it -- as part of the estate. At least it's\nconceptually possible.\nMR. THRO: Right. Conceptually, it's possible. And\ncertainly there is an argument that the bankruptcy code says\nthat preferential transfer is, in fact, property of the State.\nWith respect, however, to a preference to a State, we would say\nthat that particular reading, as applied to the State, is\nunconstitutional. I don't believe Congress can make a law which\nwould require the State to divest money or something to which\nthe State has in its possession in which the State has a\ncolorable claim of ownership. Here, there is no dispute that\nthe money is in the State treasury. What they are trying to do\nis to recover a monetary judgment from the State. As this Court\nsaid in Schoenfeld [sic] and in Granfinanciera, this is very\nmuch like a contracts claim.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose you could say that a --\nthe intangible of a contract claim is part of the estate, too,\nright? It's --\nMR. THRO: The current bankruptcy code does not say\nthat. In theory, I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But, I mean, you could be --\nthere's no less reason to say that that's part of the res than\nthere is to say that the preferential transfer is.\nMR. THRO: That's correct, Your Honor. And just as\nthe contract claims are barred, so are the preferential --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Except Congress --\nMR. THRO: -- transfer claims.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- has drawn that very distinction\nhadn't it?\nMR. THRO: I'm sorry, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I said Congress has drawn the\ndistinction that -- between the preferential claim and the\ncontract claim.\nMR. THRO: Congress has drawn a distinction between\npreferential transfer claims and contracts claims. However,\nthis Court has noted that the difference between an action to\nrecover a contract claim in order to augment the estate and an\naction to recover a preferential transfer in order to augment\nthe estate, that there really is no difference. Both are --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the theory of the second is\nthat you're not augmenting the estate, you're merely preserving\nthe estate, isn't it?\nMR. THRO: I think -- Congress has certainly defined\nthe estate so that a preferential transfer is considered\nproperty. I'm not sure that Congress can do that when the\npreferential transfer involves the estate. That strikes me as\nthe effect of Congress, in effect, saying that property which\nclearly belongs to the State no longer does. I think that's\nprobably an affront to tenth amendment federalism concerns. But\nwhat we do have here is a situation where, like in a breach of\ncontract claim, they are trying to recovery a monetary judgment\nin order to augment the estate. It's our position that that is\nbarred by sovereign immunity.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, now --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What if the --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- Mr. Thro, doesn't the\nRespondent want to dismiss the contract claims here?\nMR. THRO: The Respondent had asked the bankruptcy\ncourt -- after reading our brief, the Respondent asked the\nbankruptcy court to dismiss --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes. So, why do you insist that\nthey be adjudicated?\nMR. THRO: Well, Your Honor, I think this is an\nattempt by the Respondent to rewrite the question presented.\nNeither --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, but why --\nMR. THRO: -- our petition --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- why should we force a\nplaintiff below to pursue claims they want to give up? That\njust seems so odd to me.\nMR. THRO: It is rather odd, Your Honor, but my read\nof this Court's rules are that there is no mechanism for a\nRespondent, the party that won below, to, in effect, give up its\nvictory once they get in this Court. I'm not quite sure why\nthey wish to drop the breach of contract claims. Perhaps they\nfeel that by dropping the breach of contract claim, they somehow\nobtain a tactical advantage. And, if that's the case, certainly\nthis Court should not allow them to rewrite the question\npresented in order to obtain a tactical advantage. But, in any\nevent, both the breach of contract claim and the preferential\ntransfer claims are attempts to augment the estate and are\nbarred by sovereign immunity.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, do you think the waiver\nargument that's made is properly before us?\nMR. THRO: No. The waiver argument is not properly\nbefore you. It was not passed upon by the Court of Appeals\nbelow. Moreover, it was, for the most part, not preserved in\nthe Court of Appeals below. While they did argue that Virginia\nMilitary Institute waived sovereign immunity for all claims\ninvolving Virginia Military Institute in the Sixth Circuit, they\nmade no such argument that filing proof of claim constituted a\nwaiver of sovereign immunity for the transactions involving the\nother institutions.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You may be right about that, but,\nwhile I've got you here, let's assume just one State entity, not\nmultiple State entities. And the State has received a\npreferential transfer of $2,000. It still has an outstanding\nclaim -- a different claim against the same bankrupt for $1,000.\nAnd it goes in to enforce its claim for $1,000. Could we hold,\nconsistently with the eleventh amendment, that that is a waiver?\nMR. THRO: I believe that this Court's decisions\nindicate the following position. When a State files a proof of\nclaim, it exposes itself to the trustee's defenses to that\nclaim. So, in other words, if the -- if the -- if the\npreferential transfer was part of the same transaction or\noccurrence --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, different claim. The --\nMR. THRO: Different claim.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: One, the State received $2,000\nworth of taxes, but it -- still have its $1,000 contract claim.\nMR. THRO: Then I believe that this Court's opinions\nindicate that that would not be a waiver with respect to the\ndifferent transaction or occurrence. Certainly, by filing the\nproof of claim you would expose yourself to the trustee's\ndefenses with respect to the same transaction or occurrence.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Go --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So was -- there's a section of\nthe Bankruptcy Act -- I think it's 160(c) [sic] -- that says if it's an\nunrelated transaction, then -- so, it would be a permissive\ncounterclaim if we had ordinary civil proceedings. Then there\ncan be a setoff to the extent of the claim that's being made\nagainst the bankrupt estate. There can't be any affirmative\nrecovery, as there could be with a permissive -- with a\ncompulsory counterclaim. But you're saying that that section is\nunconstitutional -- 160(c) [sic]?\nMR. THRO: To the extent that 106(c) goes beyond the\nrule announced in Gardner, then, yes, it has constitutional\nproblems. But you need not reach the constitutionality of\n106(c). What we were talking about here is basically a\nstraightforward application of this Court's precedence in a line\nthat you have drawn in other contexts.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if we're talking just about\nVMI, not about the other schools, then you -- if this claim is\nunrelated, so that it would be a permissive counterclaim, then\nyou would say not even against VMI could you have the setoff.\nMR. THRO: That's correct, Your Honor. In -- this\nCourt's decisions dealing with what effect happens when a\nsovereign entity initiates litigation indicate that the\nsovereign, by initiating litigation, certainly exposes itself to\ndefenses, but does not expose itself to affirmative recoveries.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But why shouldn't a setoff be a\ndefense, even if it's unrelated? I mean, there were such things\nin -- at common law, were there not, that you could set off an\nunrelated debt?\nMR. THRO: Yes, Your Honor. And to the extent that\na setoff is a defense, it would be permitted. But I may have\nmisunderstood your hypothetical that you were talking about, a\nsetoff which involved an affirmative recovery against the State.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No, I mean a setoff --\nMR. THRO: Okay.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- only --\nMR. THRO: Then I misunderstood your hypothetical.\nI'm sorry, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Thro, I -- am I correct in\nassuming that if the -- if the preference in a case like this,\nthat had been given to the State, were not a bank transfer, a\ncheck, but were some tangible object, like a gold bar, that\nthere would be in rem jurisdiction on the part of the court to\nget the gold bar back as a -- even though its function is that\nof a preferential transfer?\nMR. THRO: I don't think so, Your Honor. I --\nalthough this Court has recognized certain in rem exceptions to\nsovereign immunity, particularly in the admiralty context, this\nCourt has never recognized -- said that sovereign immunity\nallows a Federal court to order the State to return something\nwhere, number one, it's in the State's possession, as it would\nbe in your hypothetical, and, number two, the State has at least\na colorable claim of ownership, which, if I understood your\nhypothetical correctly, the State does have a colorable claim of\nownership. But you need not reach -- deal with the intangible\nor personal property issues. The only thing that is at issue\nhere is a demand for a monetary judgment.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that's -- with respect to --\nI mean, you can say that of any claim that is valued in dollars.\nBut, I mean, your -- you know, what I'm getting at is your\nposition that there is no distinction to be drawn between the\ncontract action and the preferential transfer. And my point\nwas, some transfers might be satisfied -- might be sought in\nwhat, at least in the traditional classification, would be an in\nrem, rather than an in personam, action. Would your answer be\nany different if the -- if the gold bar were simply sitting on\nthe -- on the desk of some State purchasing agent, as opposed to\ndeposited in the -- in the State treasury or sold by the State\nfor the monetary value?\nMR. THRO: As I understand this Court's decisions on\nthis, if the -- if the property is in the possession of the\nState, and if the State has a colorable claim to ownership, then\nsovereign immunity will bar the -- a court --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, so --\nMR. THRO: -- a Federal court order to --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- in effect, you're saying there\nare some in rem exceptions, but not all in rem actions are\nexceptions. And this would not --\nMR. THRO: This Court has certainly recognized\ncertain in rem exceptions, notably in the Treasure Salvors case,\nwhere the State did not have a colorable claim to title, and\nalso in Deep Sea Research, where the State did not have\npossession of the object. Also, in the Whiting Pools case, the\nFederal Government had possession of a intangible asset, but it\nwas clear that the debtor still had the ownership interest, and\nthis Court said that, in that circumstance, the Federal court\nwould -- could order the return.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I suppose you could have a\ncontract action that -- in which the State promises to turn over\na particular parcel of land that it owns, or even, for that\nmatter, a gold bar that is on somebody's -- some State\nfunctionary's desk. And I guess you could have a suit for that\ngold bar or for the piece of property. And I guess you could\ncall that an in rem action, if you wanted to. But it wouldn't\nbe.\nMR. THRO: Right. It would be a gross in -- a\nradical in -- expansion of in rem jurisdiction. Traditionally\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, because --\nMR. THRO: -- in rem --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- because we normally deal with\nthat as specific performance of the contract, and what -- you\nknow it's in rem, in the sense that we're talking about an\nobject, but that's not what we mean, traditionally, by \"in rem\njurisdiction,\" is it?\nMR. THRO: Traditionally, in rem jurisdiction has a\ncouple of characteristics. One is, it is -- it is everyone\nagainst the world. It binds --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, you sue -- in effect, you sue\nthe race, rather than --\nMR. THRO: Right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- than the person.\nMR. THRO: And --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And in the -- in a -- in a specific\nperformance contract action, you sue the person.\nMR. THRO: Right. And a specific performance\ncontract action, while barred in Federal court, would, of\ncourse, be allowed in State court, to the extent that Virginia\nhas --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about a rescission action in\nwhich the private party has conveyed property to the State, and\nthe State doesn't pay, and the private party seeks to rescind\nthe action and to receive back the property that it turned over,\nwhich is real estate or a gold bar? Could that not --\nMR. THRO: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- not be a -- characterized as an\nin rem action? He's seeking back the property he gave over.\nMR. THRO: I don't believe it could be characterized\nas an in rem action, given the traditional understandings of \"in\nrem.\" But, regardless of whether you call it \"in rem\" or \"in\npersonam,\" sovereign immunity would still bar such a thing in\nFederal court. This Court has never said that there is an in\nrem exception to sovereign immunity. To the contrary, you\nexplicitly rejected an in rem exception to sovereign immunity in\nNordic Village, at least where money was concerned. You have\nallowed recovery in certain limited circumstances, such as the\nadmiralty cases. Those do not exist here. This is not an in\nrem proceeding. Preferential transfer is not an in rem\nproceeding under Nordic Village. Moreover, as this Court's\nopinions in Schoenthal and Granfinanciera make clear, it's more\n-- it's a traditional sort of common law, similar to a contract\naction.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'd like to get away from in rem\nand back to the waiver aspect that's being argued here. Let's\nassume that there is an offset obligation that the State has to\ncomply with, that there's been a preference and it has another\nclaim, and with just one entity. If that's true, it seems to me\nsomewhat unfair to say that the State can proceed on multiple\nfronts with different entities and fractionate its immunity so\nthat if there are more than three entities -- or if there are\nthree or four entities, each one is judged separately as to the\noffset obligation. It seems to me that if one State entity is\nsubject to offset, then all of them are.\nMR. THRO: I believe --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Otherwise, the State immunity, it\nseems to me, can be -- can be fractionated.\nMR. THRO: Well, I believe that this Court's\ndecisions in the bankruptcy context draw the line with respect\nto the same transaction or occurrence. So, to the extent that\nit arises out of the same transaction or occurrence, then you've\ngot that, sort of, partial or limited waiver. Where --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I --\nMR. THRO: -- however, with --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- I thought, with respect to\nJustice Ginsburg's colloquy -- and my own, earlier -- that we\nsaid that there is an offset obligation, even if they're\ndifferent claims.\nMR. THRO: There is an offset. I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And now -- and now I want to\nextrapolate from that to multiple entities, each of which\nasserts its own immunity.\nMR. THRO: Right. I think the offset obligation --\nmy understanding of Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical was that the\n-- was that we were talking about an offset that would not be an\naffirmative recovery, but would merely be using as -- an offset\nas one of the trustee's defenses to the claim.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Against the entire State --\nMR. THRO: Against the entire State.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- including any money owed to the\nother -- to the other State institutions. You acknowledged that\nthat --\nMR. THRO: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- offset could be --\nMR. THRO: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- applied not just against the\ncollege here, but against the --\nMR. THRO: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- other entities.\nMR. THRO: The offset with respect to that\nparticular -- with respect to that particular transaction or\noccurrence, not to the other transactions or occurrences.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, you're not -- I thought your\nposition was: VMI, okay. If they filed a claim, then they're\nopen to affirmative recovery if it's a compulsory counterclaim;\noffset, if it's a permissive counterclaim. But I thought you\nsaid, as to the three other schools, no waiver. There's not --\nno way you can lump them in. I thought that was --\nMR. THRO: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- your position.\nMR. THRO: There is no way that you can lump in the\nother three schools. With respect to VMI, by filing a proof of\nclaim, VMI exposed itself to the trustee's defenses. To the\nextent that the setoff is a defense for the trustee, then, of\ncourse, that setoff would apply to VMI.\nBefore I sit down, I'd like to make three points.\nFirst, Seminole Tribe controls. Congress may not\nuse its Article 1 Bankruptcy Clause to abrogate sovereign\nimmunity.\nSecond, to rule in favor of Virginia does not\nrequire any alterations in this Court's jurisprudence; however,\nto rule for Mr. Katz on any theory requires certain fundamental\nchanges in this Court's jurisprudence.\nFinally, regardless of context, sovereign immunity\nbars monetary judgment claims. States are immune from contract\nactions; private parties are not. States are immune from court\nactions; private parties are not. States are immune from\nactions by the trustee to augment the estate; private parties\nare not.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMs. Lewis.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KIM MARTIN LEWIS\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMS. LEWIS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the\nCourt:\nThe -- if the States are permitted to opt out of the\ncollective bankruptcy process, and they're permitted to\ndisregard Federal preference statutes with impunity, it will\nhave a negative effect on the bankruptcy process.\nStates are large creditors.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's the same problem\nin the patent area, isn't it? And yet, in the Florida Prepaid\ncases, we've enforced the sovereign immunity with respect to\npatent proceedings.\nMS. LEWIS: Your Honor, in the Florida Prepaid case,\nthere was an alternative State remedy. In that case the\nplaintiff could sue the State of Florida -- I'm sorry -- yes,\ncould sue the State of Florida in that particular case. In this\ncase, they can't do that. There is a -- an estate\nrepresentative, who has one option, and that option, to preserve\nthe collective benefit of the estate, is to sue the estate -- or\nto sue the State in the bankruptcy court.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Assuming that's so, for sovereign\nimmunity purposes, why should it make a difference?\nMS. LEWIS: For -- well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, I mean, this is a tougher\ncase, but if sovereign immunity is the issue, why does it make\nany difference?\nMS. LEWIS: I do believe that it makes a difference\nthat there is no alternative remedy. However, in this case, I\ndon't think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why? What does that have to do\nwith the theory of sovereign immunity?\nMS. LEWIS: I'm not sure that it has anything to do,\ndirectly, with the theory of sovereign immunity, but --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Believe me, I -- I mean, I -- as\nyou know, I'm not a big fan of sovereign immunity in these\ncircumstances, but I'm not quite sure how to get around it,\nbased on the fact that there is no alternative remedy here.\nMS. LEWIS: Well, Justice Souter, the thing that I\nthink is very troubling in this case is that there's a very\nbasic bankruptcy policy, and that basic bankruptcy policy on\npreferences is equality of distribution and to prevent\nabusive debt-collection practices on the eve of bankruptcy.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then, basically, you're making the\nargument from the uniformity phrase -- uniform bankruptcy laws.\nThat's essentially your argument. And you're saying, in the --\nin this case, that that trumps the sovereign immunity, and that\ngets you out of Seminole Tribe.\nMS. LEWIS: I believe that it -- I believe that it\ndoes, Your Honor. But I -- I'm not sure the Court even has to\nreach the uniformity argument in this case, because the fact\nthat Virginia Military Institute, on behalf of the Commonwealth\nof Virginia, waived its sovereign immunity.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but, of course, that\ndoesn't hold true for the other agencies, necessarily, unless\nyou think VMI can waive it for all of them. That seems to me to\nbe only a partial argument.\nMS. LEWIS: Justice O'Connor, the -- VMI waived the\nonly sovereign immunity that existed, which was the Commonwealth\nof Virginia's sovereign immunity. And, as a result -- all of\nthe agencies of the Commonwealth of Virginia served as unitary\ncreditors -- and so, when VMI waived the only sovereign immunity\nthat existed, there was nothing left to waive. And, at that\npoint, the recoveries of the estate -- which were recoveries\nagainst other agencies, not only VMI -- were -- the Respondent\nwas permitted to bring those actions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your waiver argument is --\nis it under 106(b) or 106(c)? It's beyond both of those, isn't\nit?\nMS. LEWIS: Chief Justice, it's not under 106(b) or\n106(c), because the waiver of sovereign immunity -- 106(a)\nprovides that, with respect to preference claims --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's an abrogation, that's\nnot --\nMS. LEWIS: That --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- a waiver.\nMS. LEWIS: -- that's correct, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, my question would be,\nHow can you argue in favor of waiver when you have a statute\nwith a much more limited waiver, the limits in 106(b) and\n106(c), and you're saying, \"Well, they waived it much more\nbroadly\"? It would seem to me that the most you can argue is\nthat there was a waiver under 106(b) or 106(c), but that doesn't\nget rid of the whole case.\nMS. LEWIS: Your Honor, I don't believe that 106(b)\nor 106(c) limits the waiver in this case, because, again, the\nsovereign immunity that was waived was the sovereign immunity of\nthe Commonwealth of Virginia. And so, the claims that were\nasserted in that action, the preference actions that are served\nagainst VMI and the other institutions, are preserved, because\nwe can --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you're saying that much of\nthe language of (b) is ineffective and superfluous? (b)\ncertainly tries to limit it. It says \"has waived sovereign\nimmunity with respect to a claim against such governmental unit\nthat is property of the estate and that arose out of the same\ntransaction.\" You're just saying all of that is ineffective,\nthen?\nMS. LEWIS: I'm saying that, in this context, it\nisn't -- it isn't effective, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In what context would it be\neffective?\nMS. LEWIS: The -- 106(b) was intended for claims\nthat didn't -- that did not arise under the bankruptcy code.\n106(a) claims, which was the abrogation of sovereign immunity,\nare claims that arise under the code. 106(b) and 106(c), there\nis no sovereign immunity to waive. So, 106(b) and 106(c) were\ndesigned for the contract claims that Justice Scalia referred to\nearlier in the Petitioner's argument.\nAnd then we looked to the Federal -- this Court's\njurisprudence with respect to what constitutes a waiver of\nsovereign immunity. And we would most naturally look at the\nLapides case, in which -- in which a State came into this --\nremoved a case from State to Federal court, and the court said\nit didn't matter the type of claim that was being asserted, or\nthat there was affirmative recovery that was being asserted,\nbut, in fact, they constituted a waiver of sovereign immunity.\nAnd the State certainly can't say, here, that they\ndidn't know the filing of a proof of claim would constitute a\nwaiver of sovereign immunity, because back in 1947, in the\nGardner versus New Jersey case, this Court acknowledged that\nfiling a proof of claim constituted a waiver.\nAnd there are ways that a State could avoid this.\nThey could have a process by which they had to go through --\nwhether it be the Attorney General's office, or whomever -- that\nin order to file a proof of claim, they had to first go\nsomewhere to get authority to do that. And that most naturally\nhappens with corporations, because, as this Court is aware in\nthe Granfinanciera case, if you -- if you assert a proof of\nclaim, you waive your jury-trial right. And that is a large\nissue for corporations --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do we interpret the\nstatute to establish that Congress intended the States to waive\ntheir immunity with the filing of the claim? I don't see that\nanywhere in the statute.\nMS. LEWIS: I'm sorry, can you --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're arguing that by\nfiling the claim, the State has waived all of its immunity, but\nI don't see where in the statute it imposes that kind of waiver\nupon States. I see where they abrogate the immunity, but that's\ndifferent than saying that there's a waiver. Is your argument\nthat just because they abrogated immunity, and it turned out\nthey didn't -- may or may not have that authority, they\nnecessarily imposed a waiver?\nMS. LEWIS: I don't think 106(b) applies with\nrespect to the preference claims, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Well, then where is\nthe waiver of sovereign immunity in this statute?\nMS. LEWIS: The -- in -- 106(b) and 106(c) specifies\nthe conduct by which a sovereign must -- must engage in, in\norder to waive sovereign immunity in a noncore matter, in those\nmatters not set forth in section 106- --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I thought -- you're not\nrelying on 106(b) and 106(c).\nMS. LEWIS: That's correct, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, where is the waiver of\nimmunity on which you're relying?\nMS. LEWIS: The waiver of sovereign immunity is the\njurisprudence of this Court, that eleventh amendment sovereign\nimmunity is not absolute, that a sovereign can waive that\nsovereign immunity. And it did, in Gardner versus New Jersey.\nAnd, again, this Court looked at that in the Lapides case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you have no argument\nthat Congress imposed a waiver.\nMS. LEWIS: That's correct, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And, again, I still don't see how\nyou distinguish (b) when you say \"(b) doesn't apply here, it may\napply in other cases.\" If it doesn't apply here, why would it\napply in other cases?\nMS. LEWIS: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, if you are appealing to\nthis broader principle, that you either waive all of sovereign\nimmunity or you waive none of it at all, and you can't just\nrestrict it to the particular claim, which is what (b) says, I\ndon't know why, in any case, that wouldn't be true.\nMS. LEWIS: Justice Scalia, again, it's because we\ndo not believe 106(b) governs here, because it deals with claims\nthat are not abrogated under 106(a) of the bankruptcy code.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, if Congress had thought\nit had successfully abrogated, there would be no reason to\nprovide for a waiver, I don't suppose.\nMS. LEWIS: That's correct, Justice Stevens. And I\nthink this Court has recognized that bankruptcy is different in\nother contexts. And I think that it's very important to talk\nabout bankruptcy differently. This Court has looked at, in --\njust last term, in the Hood case, which was the debtor's\ndischarge. And the Court said that that constituted in rem\nauthority.\nThis Court, in Perez versus Campbell, said that\nsomebody cannot be denied a driver's license simply because they\nfailed to play a discharged obligation.\nThe Court, in the Irving Trust case, said that a\nState is required to satisfy the procedure of bankruptcy if they\nwant to participate in the claims process.\nIn Van Huffel and Straton, this Court said that a\nbankruptcy estate is permitted to sell property free and clear\nof the State's tax liens.\nIn Whiting Pools, this Court said the IRS, who\nseized property on the eve of bankruptcy on behalf of a -- of a\nlien, had to return that in its in rem jurisdiction.\nAnd I believe it was Justice O'Connor who asked the\nquestion of Petitioner with respect to, How would this affect\nthe automatic stay? And how I've thought of that is, sometimes\nthe automatic stay, there may be an effect with respect to\nmonetary relief, and there may be an effect as far as an\ninjunctive relief. For example, if there was a judgment that a\nState had, prior to bankruptcy, against the estate, and then\nsought to enforce the judgment, executed on the debtor's bank\naccounts post-petition, debtor didn't know about it, because, in\na -- in a debtor's reorganization, the first month of the\ndebtor's bankruptcy, you can't -- you're not following\neverything that's happening the case. There is an execution on\nthe bank account, the money is taken into the State's coffers.\nDoes that mean that the State is bound by the automatic stay, or\nis the State not bound by the automatic stay? It was money that\nwas transferred from one -- from the estate to the State.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought (b) and (c) -- tell if\nI'm right about this -- but suppose an individual bankruptcy,\nand sometime prior to the bankruptcy the individual got into an\nautomobile accident and ran into a State building and wrecked\nit. All right? Now, I take it that, in a State that hasn't\nwaived sovereign immunity, that individual, were he not\nbankrupt, might not be able to bring a lawsuit for his damages\ncaused by a claim that the wall was too high or something. Each\nis claiming the other is negligent. I guess the person wouldn't\nbe able to file. And the fact that he's bankrupt, he couldn't,\neither.\nMS. LEWIS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, in (b), I guess it's saying that if the\nState happens to come in, after he's gone bankrupt, and brought\nhis negligent suit against him, he can respond.\nMS. LEWIS: That's correct, Your Honor. That --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, if, in fact, you were to lose\non (a), I guess the whole section would fall, because it\nwouldn't make any sense anymore, and we'd just wipe out the\nwhole thing, (a), (b), and (c).\nMS. LEWIS: That's correct, Your Honor. It was --\nit was a --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, then the case\nreally turns on the extent to which the Government can -- sorry,\nthe extent to which Congress can waive sovereign immunity, as\nthey seem to have waived it in (a), whether the Constitution\npermits them to do what they did in (a).\nMS. LEWIS: Right, to abrogate sovereign immunity.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if you win on that, you win.\nAnd if you lose on that, the whole section 106 would probably\nfall.\nMS. LEWIS: I believe 106 would fall, but, if 106\nfalls, doesn't mean that Respondent would lose, as far as the\nwaiver argument, because --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not sure, because if you lose\non the whole thing -- suppose you were to say Congress doesn't\nhave the power to do anything there. I just wonder if (b) and\n(c) would survive, because they may have had something else in\nmind. But maybe that's too complicated to go into now.\nMS. LEWIS: Well, Justice Breyer, I think that (b)\nand (c), as pointed out by another one of the Justices, may be a\nlimitation on the general concept of common law waiver. So, to\nthe extent that 106 would be -- this Court were to rule (b) that\nwould -- unconstitutional, you would look to the general common\nlaw waiver of sovereign immunity, which would be the Gardner\nversus New Jersey case and the Lapides case.\nThe --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how do you -- how do\nyou have an informed waiver if the argument is over the\nauthority to abrogate? In other words, the Federal Government\nis saying, under your theory, that we're abrogating your\nimmunity. And the State's saying, \"You don't have that\nauthority.\" And how do you get an informed waiver, simply\nbecause the State participates in a bankruptcy proceeding, on\nthe basis of the legal theory that they're asserting here today,\nthat Congress doesn't have the authority to abrogate the\nimmunity?\nMS. LEWIS: We believe, obviously, Congress had the\nright to abrogate sovereign immunity --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand that. But your\ntheory, as I read in your brief, as an alternative argument, is\nthat there was a --\nMS. LEWIS: That's correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- waiver. The State waived\nits immunity by participating through -- in the --\nMS. LEWIS: That's correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- bankruptcy proceeding.\nHow is there an informed waiver if the argument is over the\nauthority to abrogate?\nMS. LEWIS: Well, Your Honor, I believe, because\nthis Court has recognized, in Gardner versus New Jersey, that if\na State files a proof of claim, it constitutes a waiver, that\nthe State had to have to been informed, it had to know that the\nactual conduct of filing a proof of claim would have a\nconsequence of a waiver.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but all the -- all the\nstatute does is abrogate.\nMS. LEWIS: All --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In 106(a). It's --\nMS. LEWIS: That's correct --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- an attempt to --\nMS. LEWIS: -- Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- abrogate.\nMS. LEWIS: That's correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if it turns out that\nCongress doesn't have that authority, I don't see how you can\nsay the State has made an informed waiver, when their theory is,\n\"Guess what? You don't have that authority to abrogate.\"\nMS. LEWIS: Well, Your Honor, 106(a) certainly\ndidn't exist back in Gardner versus New Jersey in 1947 either.\nAnd I think that the -- the fact that -- if sovereign immunity\nexists, sovereign immunity can be waived. I'm not sure --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no, he's -- so, I'm wrong.\nWhat I said is wrong. The answer has to be that -- we're only\ntalking about (a) at the moment. And what Congress tried to do\nin (a) is abrogate sovereign immunity insofar as it is\nconstitutional to do so. So, then, you say, if you lose on it,\nit's unconstitutional for it to do so here, but it could -- it\nis constitutional for it to do so insofar as there is this\nsituation that the State brings a case against the estate, and\nyou can do an offset, et cetera. But it would have nothing to\ndo with (b) and (c). It would have to do with reading that into\n(a), I guess.\nMS. LEWIS: I believe that's correct --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right.\nMS. LEWIS: -- Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In -- I don't follow that,\nbecause I thought the theory of the cases were that you can\nwaive something by conduct. And so, when you ask a court for\nrelief against a party, then it's reasonable to say, \"If you're\ncoming in and asking the court to give you something, then it's\nonly fair that your adversary should be able to\" --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: A light bulb exploded. A light\nbulb exploded.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think we're -- I think\nit's safe.\nJUSTICE BREYER: A light bulb went out.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a trick they play on\nnew Chief Justices all the time.\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Happy Halloween.\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Let me ask this --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Take your time. We're interested\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We're even -- yeah, we're\neven more in the dark now than before.\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If you lose on the abrogation\nnotion, and the Court holds that there is no authority in\nCongress to abrogate sovereign immunity, still the bankruptcy\ncode codifies what is, across the board, the law. That is, if\nyou come to a court and say, \"Give me X against D,\" that D\nshould be able to come back and say, \"Either I want full relief\nbecause it's a compulsory type counterclaim. I have to bring it\nhere. I can't bring it separately. Or at least a setoff.\" I\nmean, that was understood, that a party over whom the court\nwould not have jurisdiction otherwise, is amendable to the\ncourt's jurisdiction to the extent of a counterclaim or a\nsetoff. So, I don't see why (b) and (c) are not discrete from\n(a). (b) and (c) are implementing the idea of a setoff. You\ncome to court for a claim, you are deemed to have waived any\njurisdictional objection to the counterclaim or the setoff.\nMS. LEWIS: I understand that argument, Justice\nGinsburg, but I believe when Congress enacted 106(a), (b), and\n(c), that they enacted it -- (a), being those actions which were\nabrogated, (b) were those actions that remained. And those\nactions that remained, there were limitations to that waiver.\nBecause this is not -- there was nothing to waive on sovereign\nimmunity on 106(b) as to preference actions, for example.\nContract claims are different. Contract claims would have --\nare not abrogated under 106(a), so, therefore, the only way they\ncan be waived is under 106(b).\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's the same question. But\nlet's say that the court thinks there might be merit to the\nargument of waiver, that the State entity comes in asking to be\ntreated as a creditor, and its preference is then before the\nbankruptcy court. How is that issue preserved in the question\nyou raise? You say, maybe the Congress used Article 1 to\nabrogate the State's sovereign immunity.\nMS. LEWIS: Did you ask how it's preserved? We\nraised the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It just seems to -- seem to me to\nbe part of the question presented.\nMS. LEWIS: Your Honor, I think, to the extent that\nthis Court can avoid addressing the Constitution about\nconstitutionality of a statute -- and, in the situation of\nwaiver, we believe that it can -- then we believe that's the\nappropriate jurisprudence.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you asked -- you framed the\nquestion.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No. No.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, no, you -- you're right.\nYou're right. You're exactly right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, to what extent was\nthis argument raised below, I guess is a --\nMS. LEWIS: Chief Justice, it was raised, to the\nextent of VMI's sovereign immunity. And the reason that it was\nis, at the time that the motion to dismiss was filed, as\nrecognized by the Petitioner in their brief, and as recognized\nby the court, at the bankruptcy court level, the Hood decision\nat the Sixth Circuit had been a decision. And so, there was no\nnecessity for the court to engage into any other proceedings,\nother than to deal with the Hood decision.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask a question on another\nsubject, just talking for a minute about your in rem theory of\nthe case? And I understand you would contend that assets have\nbeen subject to a fraudulent transfer or a preference should be\ndeemed to be part of the estate. But is it not true that this\ncase also involves a claim on the accounts receivable? And do\nyou contend they also should be treated as part of the estate?\nMS. LEWIS: Justice Stevens, we did seek to dismiss\nthe causative action with respect to the accounts receivable and\nthe causative action that we --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is that because you concede, in\neffect, that they would not be part of the estate if we adopted\nan in rem theory that included the preferential transfers?\nMS. LEWIS: They would not be part of the estate --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Okay.\nMS. LEWIS: -- in a situation of -- if this adopt --\nCourt adopted an in rem theory, that's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Which would not? I'm sorry.\nMS. LEWIS: Any recoveries on behalf of State\ncontract claims, account receivable as collections.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And you have some of those.\nMS. LEWIS: We do, Your -- Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Are you trying to get those in this\ncase?\nMS. LEWIS: No, we are not.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, okay.\nMS. LEWIS: We sought to dismiss them.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you were, but you're not.\nMS. LEWIS: That's correct, Justice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you're --\nMS. LEWIS: -- Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- trying to get rid of that,\nright?\nMS. LEWIS: That's correct, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Now, that doesn't fit into your in\nrem theory, but why wouldn't you have been able to recover that\non a waiver theory? If you -- and I understand your waiver\nargument is, you can defend the judgment on the ground not --\nyou know, any ground to uphold the judgment is okay for the\nRespondent. But why wouldn't you have tried to defend that part\nof your case on the waiver theory?\nMS. LEWIS: It would have been the waiver with\nrespect to just VMI's contract claims. And, I apologize, off\nthe top of my head I don't recall what the value of just the VMI\ncontract claims would have been. But that's what we believe the\nwaiver would have been limited to. It would have not included\nthe contract claims of Central Virginia Community College, Blue\nRidge.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would you explain to me again why\nit's okay that your waiver argument below was only directed to\nthe claims against VMI?\nMS. LEWIS: At the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not -- I didn't understand your\nanswer to that. You made a much narrower argument there than\nyou're making here.\nMS. LEWIS: I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You didn't -- you didn't assert\nthat all the sovereign immunity for the entire State and all of\nits institutions had been waived simply because of the claim by\nVMI. You didn't make that argument.\nMS. LEWIS: At the time of that decision, Justice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMS. LEWIS: -- Scalia, the Sixth Circuit Hood\ndecision had already been decided, and, just as it was\nacknowledged in the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- which said what?\nMS. LEWIS: Which said that sovereign immunity is\nwaived, or abrogated, for preference actions in -- it was\nactually across the board -- an abrogation of State sovereign\nimmunity. And, at that point, there was notice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then why didn't you make the\nargument? I mean, if Hood said, when you make a partial -- or\none institution -- if I understand what you're saying, Hood said\nthat a waiver by one institution waives for the whole State. Is\nthat -- is that what Hood said?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No. Hood said --\nMS. LEWIS: No.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that Congress could abrogate.\nMS. LEWIS: That's correct. Congress could --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- through the Bankruptcy Clause.\nThe -- what -- and then when the case came to this Court, we\ndidn't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- address that issue.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But if you're making a separate\nwaiver argument, apart from the abrogation argument, I don't see\nwhy you would not make that waiver argument as broadly as\npossible. It's a separate argument from the abrogation\nargument.\nMS. LEWIS: We --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you're making it as a separate\nargument here. But here, you're making it as to all claims\nagainst all State institutions; whereas, below you made it only\nas to the claims against VMI. I don't understand that.\nMS. LEWIS: At the time, 106(a), in the Sixth\nCircuit, it was determined that that was constitutional. So, at\nthe time, the only thing left for the States to waive was the\ncontract actions. And the contract actions of VMI were the only\nthings that could be waived as part of the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I see.\nMS. LEWIS: -- underlying --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I see.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, the -- so, the long and\nshort of it is, for good and sufficient reasons you did not make\nthe same waiver below that you're making here today.\nMS. LEWIS: That's correct, Chief --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.\nMS. LEWIS: -- Justice.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And the proof of claim in VMI was\n$43,000, and the preference was $25,000.\nMS. LEWIS: That's correct.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, on your in rem argument, how\ndo you distinguish Nordic Village's case?\nMS. LEWIS: In the Nordic Village case, the trustee\nin that case focused on the money damages. They didn't focus on\nthe portion of the preference statute that says you can get the\ntransfer back, you can get the property back. And as this Court\nrecognized in Bowen versus Massachusetts, just because it is\nmonetary relief doesn't mean that it's money damages. And\nthat's how we distinguished the Nordic Village case, Your Honor.\nThe -- this Court, I believe, would be extending the\nArticle -- its jurisprudence if it permitted the bankruptcy\nestate not to be able to sue the States. This Court has\nrecognized that a private citizen, Indian tribes, and foreign\nsovereigns cannot be sued. But this Court's never recognized a\nFederal entity cannot pursue a State. And this Court -- this is\na situation where there is no alternative remedy. We aren't in\na situation where we have the ADA, the ADEA, where the EEOC can\nbring an action on behalf of the Government and on behalf of the\nindividuals to enforce a Federal law. We have no other\nenforcement in bankruptcy, other than the collective bankruptcy\nprocess, the bankruptcy code. And the bankruptcy code assigns\nto the debtor in possession, or to the trustee, the ability to\ncollect on behalf of the estate.\nBankruptcy is unique in its very in rem application\nand its very narrow and specialized enforcement of the\nbankruptcy system. The framers recognized the critical nature\nof binding the States in a uniform scheme. The decision below\nought to be affirmed on the basis of in rem, on the basis of the\nConstitution, and on the basis that Virginia, the Commonwealth\nof Virginia, waived its sovereign immunity.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nApologize for the fireworks.\n[Laughter.]\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Thro, you have three and\na half minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM E. THRO\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMR. THRO: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nThe question presented is whether or not Congress\nmay use the Article 1 Bankruptcy Clause to abrogate sovereign\nimmunity.\nIn Alden versus Maine, this Court held that there\nwas a presumption that the States had retained their immunity\nunless it could be shown by conclusive evidence that the States\nsurrendered their immunity in the plan of convention. If\nCongress can use the Article 1 bankruptcy power to abrogate\nsovereign immunity, then one would expect there to be\ndiscussions to that effect at the constitutional convention, in\nthe federalist and antifederalist writings, and in the ratifying\nconventions. Yet, as the Sixth Circuit conceded in its version\nof Hood, there is no compelling evidence. There is, at best,\nsilence. Silence cannot equal the compelling evidence.\nTherefore, the Article 1 bankruptcy power cannot be used to\nabrogate sovereign immunity.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's the question you've\npresented, Mr. Thro, but it was the same question that was\npresented to us in Hood. And in Hood, we decided that we were\nnot going to answer the question presented, we were going to\ndecide the case on a lesser ground. So, the Court, certainly if\nour venture in Hood was proper, here, too, we could decide the\ncase on some other ground than the one you presented in your\nquestion.\nMR. THRO: Yes, you could, Your Honor. But you\nshould not address any of the alternative arguments raised by\nMr. Katz.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We couldn't decide it in your\nfavor, on some alternative ground, though, could we?\n[Laughter.]\nMR. THRO: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I mean, that distinguishes it\n--\nMR. THRO: Yes, absolutely, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The difference between this and\nHood.\nMR. THRO: -- Your Honor, but I believe that the\nproper exercise of judicial restraint is to decide the question\npresented, and only the question presented, and do the other\ngrounds for perhaps another day.\nAll of Katz's -- all of Katz's novel arguments raise\ncomplex constitutional issues and, quite frankly, ask for\nradical alteration of this Court's jurisprudence.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask if you think, within the\ntext of the question presented, we could decide whether the\nsovereign immunity was abrogated by the convention itself, not\nby Congress? There is that argument out there, you know.\nMR. THRO: Yes. Within -- I think, in effect, if\nyou were to decide -- if you decided that the convention itself\nhad intended --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Abrogated.\nMR. THRO: -- for the States not to have sovereign\nimmunity in bankruptcy, then you would conclude that the Article\n1 Bankruptcy Clause includes the abrogation power. So, I think\nit's, sort of, two sides of the same question.\nReturning to Justice Ginsburg's question, a second\nreason for not addressing Katz's arguments were, they were not\npassed on below. As this Court noted in Granfinanciera, where\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, then that would be a ground\nto allow them to present it below. They had a total winner --\nMR. THRO: Yes. Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- on that hands below.\nMR. THRO: Yes, absolutely. You -- it -- you can --\nyou should decide the question presented. And if you decide the\nquestion presented in our favor -- that is, that Congress has --\ndoes not have the power to abrogate sovereign immunity -- you\nwould presumably remand to the Sixth Circuit for further\nproceedings, consistent with your opinion. At that time, Katz\ncould attempt to present these other defenses. We would, of\ncourse, argue that some of those defenses had not been properly\npreserved. But it has not been briefed below.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMR. THRO: Thank you.\n"
