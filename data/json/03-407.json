        "content": "(11:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in No. 03-407, John F. Kowalski v. John C. Tesmer.\nMr. Casey.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS L. CASEY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. CASEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nIn this facial challenge to the Michigan\nstatute, court of appeals rulings that these lawyers have\nthird party standing and that their potential clients have\na constitutional right to appointed counsel in\ndiscretionary appeals are both wrong.\nFirst, with respect to the standing argument, in\nour brief we argue that the respondent attorneys could not\nmeet any of the criteria for standing. This morning I'd\nlike to focus on the element of prudential standing that\nconsiders whether there is a hindrance to the ability of a\nthird party to protect his own -- to protect his own\ninterest.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- there is an injury in\nfact. These lawyers claim that if the State were\ncompensating for this service and they're on the list to\nbe appointed, they would have more money in their pockets.\nYou're not -- you're not challenging that there is an\ninjury in fact.\nMR. CASEY: Yes. In our -- in our brief we have\nchallenged that. The -- the requirement is that there be\nan injury in fact, a concrete and particularized actual or\nimminent injury in fact.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- you said now you\nwere going on to the prudential factors, and so I asked\nwere you recognizing that there was an injury in fact, and\nyou said no. And -- and why not? Because it seems so\nobvious that they would get appointments if the system\nwere --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: I take it you're\nreserving it for -- in your -- in your brief.\nMR. CASEY: I -- I am not waiving the argument.\nI -- I would like to rest on the brief.\nBut I -- in answer to your question, we believe\nyes, there is a likelihood that these lawyers on the list\nfor appointed counsel will some day -- if they stay on the\nlist and a case comes up in that county, there is a\nlikelihood that there will be a case. We submit, however,\nthat on these facts in this facial challenge, we don't\nknow how many lawyers are on the list for appointments in\nSaginaw County. We don't know how many appeals of this\nnature come up. So it may be many years before the\nsituation arises. This is not a concrete and\nparticularized actual or imminent injury in fact, and\nwe've argued that in the brief.\nAt -- at best, if there is an injury in fact and\nif there is -- another factor is the close relationship to\nthe third party. We believe those are weak at best, and\nwe've argued in our brief that they don't exist. I think\nit is most clear, however, that the criteria concerning\nthe hindrance to the third party does not exist here.\nThis is a facial challenge bought by -- brought\nby lawyers before the statute took effect, claiming not\nthat the statute violates their own constitutional rights,\nbut that it violates the rights of potential future\nclients, and that the lawyers will suffer economic harm.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: May I clarify something about\nthis case? Are any of the indigent defendants whose\nrights the respondent attorneys want to advance -- do any\nof those people themselves have standing to bring their\nclaims in Federal court now?\nMR. CASEY: Yes. We argue that there are -\nthere are three ways that an indigent defendant can bring\nthis claim themselves without having to rely on an\nattorney in this type of case. First, they can bring the\nchallenge directly through the State courts.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: I'm asking if there are any\nindividuals now before this Court in this case -\nMR. CASEY: No. None of these -- none of these\ndefendants --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- who would be available and\nwho would have remedies or standing to bring their claims.\nAre we just talking pure hypotheticals here?\nMR. CASEY: In this facial challenge, we're\ntalking about pure hypotheticals. The -- the three named\nindigent defendants --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: There were three named\nindigents.\nMR. CASEY: Correct.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: They were?\nMR. CASEY: They were denied counsel.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Denied counsel, and they were\nalso dismissed at some point down the line?\nMR. CASEY: Yes. The -- the Sixth Circuit held\nthat the Federal court should abstain from deciding their\nclaims because they could have brought their claims in\ntheir direct State appeals. They raised claims about the\npractice of denying counsel before the statute took\neffect.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Casey, was it a Younger\nabstention -\nMR. CASEY: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- with respect to the -\nMR. CASEY: The -- the Sixth Circuit en banc\nheld that under Younger v. Harris, the Federal court\nshould abstain from deciding the claims of the three\nindigent defendants.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So that means that the\ndefendants could never bring this 1983 suit. Only the\nlawyers arguably could.\nMR. CASEY: No. Younger v. Harris is only -\nonly defers the time when a proper Federal civil rights\naction can be brought. There were -- at the time this\naction was brought, there were pending State appeals in\ntwo of the cases. One of the defendants never appealed at\nall.\nThe Sixth Circuit recently issued an opinion\nnot -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why didn't these lawyers\ninstead of -- instead of trying to sue on their own, why\ndidn't they just offer their services to -- to these\ndefendants through the State courts?\nMR. CASEY: Your Honor, perhaps opposing counsel\ncould answer that better than I. We say that is the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, that's what I don't\nunderstand about -- about the fact that they won't -\nwon't have the right to counsel. It -- it's at least as\neasy for -- for counsel to appear in cases in which\nindigents need counsel as it is for counsel to bring their\nown lawsuit.\nMR. CASEY: That is our point on the standing\nissue precisely, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Didn't -- didn't the Michigan\nSupreme Court already rule on this issue and said that the\nstatute was constitutional, that there was no right to\ncounsel, therefore no possibility of appointing counsel,\npaid counsel?\nMR. CASEY: That's correct. In -- in 2000, the\n-- the -- while this case was pending, the Michigan\nSupreme Court issued an opinion, the Bulger decision\nthat's discussed in the briefs, saying that the practice\nof denying appointed counsel was constitutional. The\nstatute was not in effect at that time. The statute took\neffect, and in a case just decided in June of this year,\nPeople v. Harris, the Michigan Supreme Court relied on\nBulger and said this statute is constitutional. It does\nnot violate any rights.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So going through the State\nsystem, there's no possibility that these lawyers or the\ndefendants could successfully assert a right to paid\ncounsel --\nMR. CASEY: That is correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- because that's already\nbeen decided by the Michigan Supreme Court.\nMR. CASEY: As -- as a matter of jurisprudence\nby the State supreme court, yes. Both State and Federal\nconstitutional --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There -- there's an appeal from\n-- they could request certiorari from the State supreme\ncourt to this Court, I assume.\nMR. CASEY: There are, in fact, two cases\npending, the Harris case that I just mentioned. A\npetition for certiorari was filed about 2 weeks ago\nraising this precise claim. There is another case Halbert\nv. Michigan. It's docket -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there -- was there a cert\npetition in Bulger itself?\nMR. CASEY: There was a petition in Bulger.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And it was denied.\nMR. CASEY: It was denied.\nIn -- in addition -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But there -- there is a cert\npetition filed in what case? In the June case?\nMR. CASEY: In the -- the case is pending in\nthis Court as Melody Harris v. Michigan. It was filed\nabout 2 weeks ago. I have not been able to find out the\ndocket number.\nThere was another case, Halbert v. Michigan,\nwhich is a pro se defendant who was denied counsel. His\napplications, pro se applications, were denied in the\nState appellate courts. A pro se petition was filed. I\nfiled a response to that about a month ago. That's docket\nnumber 03-10198. It's on this Court's conference for\nFriday, October 8th.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: So your point is that there\nare petitions filed here that would enable this Court to\ndecide whether the Michigan Supreme Court was correct in\nholding the statute constitutional.\nMR. CASEY: That's correct. There are at least\nthose two petitions pending that I'm aware of in this\nCourt now.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do you acknowledge there is a\ngood Federal question there at least?\nMR. CASEY: Oh, yes. It's -- it's an important\nquestion.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes.\nMR. CASEY: We -- we -- in the Bulger case, I\nopposed certiorari, saying that yes, it's an important\nquestion, but it was correctly decided. At that time,\nthere was no conflict. Then when the Sixth Circuit\nopinion came up, we filed the petition saying it's an\nimportant question and now there's a conflict between the\nState supreme court and the Federal court of appeals.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's the position you've\ntaken in -- in the Halbert case, that the Court should\ntake the case?\nMR. CASEY: What I said in the Halbert case is\nthat the Court need not grant this petition now because,\nalthough it's an important question, the issue is pending\nin -- in this Tesmer, the current case, Kowalski v.\nTesmer. If this Court rules in our favor on standing and\nthen does not reach the constitutional question, then it\nwould be appropriate to grant certiorari in either the\nHalbert case or the Harris case because the -- the\ndetermination of the constitutionality of this statute is\nimportant to the State of Michigan.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do they have lawyers in those\ncases?\nMR. CASEY: Now, the Halbert petition is pro se.\nThe Harris petition has either retained or pro bono\ncounsel. But the -- the constitutionality of the statute\nis -- excuse me -- is directly challenged in both of those\npetitions.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you if in exercising\nprudential judgment on whether to accord prudential\nstanding, because I guess there's article III standing\nhere, is it appropriate to take into consideration as one\nfact that it's already been argued in this case and it's\nnow ripe for decision, or should we just totally ignore\nthat aspect of the case?\nMR. CASEY: As a matter of judicial economy,\nthere is a point to be made that it -- the issue has been\nbriefed and argued. So perhaps it should be decided.\nJust last term in Elk Grove v. Newdow, the Court faced a\nsimilar situation. They disposed of the case on\nstanding -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but in that case there was\na conflict between the interests of the third party and\nthe interests of the litigant or a potential client. Here\nthere's no conflict between the lawyers and the clients.\nMR. CASEY: That's true.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, also bearing upon\nour prudential judgment, I -- I suppose, would be that in\norder to reach the merits, we have to do what you assert\nto be an end run around the Younger abstention. And -\nMR. CASEY: That's -- that's correct. In my\nview, the -- the most logical, most appropriate\ndisposition would be to say that these attorneys do not\nhave standing. Therefore, reverse the Sixth Circuit's\njudgment.\nThere are these other vehicles pending now to\nreach the constitutional issue.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But -- but why isn't the\nYounger abstention problem just like the mootness problem\nin Craig against Boren? It took one class of litigants\nunavailable but then allowed the third party to have\nstanding. Why -- why aren't -- aren't your opponents here\njust like the bartenders in Craig against Boren?\nMR. CASEY: Well, in determining prudential\nstanding, there are several criteria that should be\nexamined in deciding whether there's an exception to the\ngeneral rule where a litigant cannot argue the rights of\nthird parties. In Craig v. Boren, the statute directly\naffected the vendor in that case. It was a statute\nagainst sale of certain alcoholic beverages. And in this\ncase we don't have that.\nAlso, in Craig v. Boren, nobody argued\nprudential standing considerations until the case reached\nthe Supreme Court apparently.\nBut in our case, we have a situation where we\nhave lawyers who do not have any present clients who are\nnot directly affected by the statute. They're not\nclaiming rights -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but they have the same\ninterest that the bartenders had because they won't make\nsome -- sell their services and the bartenders wouldn't\nsell the booze. I don't see the difference.\nMR. CASEY: Well, in -- in Craig v. Boren, the\n-- if the bartenders did not comply with the statute,\nthey'd be subject to criminal penalties. Here, the\nattorneys will not be subject to any criminal penalties.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, why -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That wasn't true -- that\nwasn't true in the Pierce v. Society of Sisters case and\nit wasn't true in the Singleton case. Both of those cases\nrecognized third party standing, although the prohibition\nwas not on the plaintiff who was seeking to raise the\nrights of another person.\nMR. CASEY: That's -- that's true. The parties\nhave discussed many cases. Almost all of them have some\nargued, all of them have distinguishing factors too.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't -- isn't the biggest\ndistinguishing factor the one that you raised in response\nto Justice Scalia's question? These -- these lawyers can\nrepresent somebody on a direct appeal, the same way and\nraise exactly the same issue that they're trying to raise\non third party standing now. Isn't -- isn't that true?\nMR. CASEY: That -- precisely. Just normal\nprinciples of litigation counsel that it is appropriate to\nhave a real party in interest. The criminal defendants\nwhose rights are at stake in the statute litigate that\ncase. If you take the step and allow standing for an\nattorney, based on speculative claims about future clients\nand economic harm to the attorney, as the dissent in the\nSixth Circuit says, that opens up the possibility of\nvastly expanding the doctrine of standing beyond what this\nCourt has ever said.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, is it correct as a\nfactual matter that these particular lawyers do have\nclients that they could be representing -\nMR. CASEY: That is not in --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- on direct appeal?\nMR. CASEY: -- that is not in the record. In\ntheir response brief, they said that they currently do\nhave clients, but in the complaint -- this case was,\nagain, a facial challenge. It was decided on summary\ndisposition or it was a motion to dismiss. It was filed\nand decided within about a month. And there was no\nfactual development here.\nIf they had actual clients, there would be\nclearly a closer relationship, but again, those clients\nwould not be hindered from making the claims themselves.\nThere is no reason -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the -- the claim that -\nI'm sorry.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it just would seem to me\nthat the lawyers who are advancing this claim may or may\nnot be representing individuals who want to make the same\nclaim, but there -- there must be some lawyers who want to\nmake these claims who don't have any clients, and the\nquestion is whether they have standing. And are they to\nbe defeated standing because there are a lot of other\nlawyers who might also sue?\nMR. CASEY: In our view, as a general\nproposition, lawyers should not be given independent\nstanding to raise claims of their clients. When the\nclients can present their own issues themselves, as they\ncan in this case or in this situation under the statute,\nthere's no need -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that different from Caplin\n& Drysdale where the lawyers didn't raise the interest of\nthe client and --\nMR. CASEY: Again, there was an actual client in\nthat case and there was significant money at stake. The\nlawyers had been paid money from drug forfeiture. They\nhad been paid $25,000, and they wanted another 107 -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But as far as the actual\nclient, you moved to dismiss. So that's why there's no -\nwas no back-development. You moved to dismiss.\nTherefore, you have to assume whatever facts -\nMR. CASEY: That -- that's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- in favor of the opponent\nof the motion.\nMR. CASEY: That's correct. But my response on\nthat was to the question of, you know, do they in fact now\nhave clients. There is no allegation in the complaint and\nno proof that they now have clients. They may -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if -- if you assume -- you\nassume the correctness of the allegations, which you -\nyou have to do at this point, the allegation is that they\nwould get clients and would be paid but for this bar to\npayment. Isn't that correct? So if you take them in\nterms of their claim, you've got to assume that they will\nhave clients and they can bring this -- this issue on\nbehalf of the client.\nMR. CASEY: Correct. That goes to the criteria\nof injury in fact and close relationship with the third\nparty. We still have the criteria that I wanted to\ndiscuss this morning about hindrance to the right -- to\nthe ability of the third party to litigate for themselves.\nExcuse me.\nIn our view, there is no need to expand the\ndoctrine of standing to permit lawyers to have independent\nstanding to make these claims because the clients, who are\ndirectly affected by the statute, can make them\nthemselves. There are the two pending habeas -- or two\npending petitions for certiorari that we've mentioned.\nThere is another case, the Bulger case. Mr.\nBulger himself, after he lost in the Michigan courts, he\nfiled a petition for -- for habeas corpus. And the\ndistrict court granted the writ of habeas corpus. We\nappealed. That case is now pending in the Sixth Circuit.\nSo that's another vehicle.\nIt is also possible that an indigent inmate\nhimself could bring a section 1983 case. It's simply not\nnecessary to expand the doctrine of standing to give\nlawyers -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How could an indigent bring a\n1983 case? I thought you said that that would be barred\nby Younger.\nMR. CASEY: If they had a pending prosecution,\nit would be barred by Younger. Once that pending\nprosecution is over, they could bring a 1983 action.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Could they? Because I\nthought this Court had held that -- that you can't bring a\n1983 suit if what you're seeking to do is overturn the\nconviction.\nMR. CASEY: Under Heck v. Humphrey, if the\noutcome of the 1983 case would necessarily imply that the\nconviction or sentence is invalid, you cannot bring the\n1983 case. Here, the allegation is simply that they were\nentitled to counsel. That's not the substantive merits of\nwhether the claim -- whether they are properly convicted\nor properly sentenced.\nThe Sixth Circuit, in a case decided August\n31st -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, if that -- that -\nthat's -- you're saying that the defendants themselves\ncould not sue now under 1983?\nMR. CASEY: A -- a defendant who is currently in\nthe State system on direct appeal is barred by the\nabstention doctrine from filing a 1983 action. But after\nthey go through the State court and lose, in addition to\nfiling a writ of certiorari with this Court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And presumably up to this\nCourt, if they want to come that far.\nMR. CASEY: Oh, certainly. After -- after they\ngo through the State court, they could file a writ of cert\nin this Court, as the two pending petitions have. They\ncould file a complaint for habeas corpus. They could\nbring a facial challenge under 1983.\nIn a case called Howard v. Whitbeck from the\nSixth Circuit, just decided about a month ago, that was\nthe very question that was decided. An inmate -- a prison\ninmate, challenging another statute, litigated and lost in\nthe State court, then filed a 1983 action. We argued in a\nFederal case under Rooker v. Feldman, he was actually\ntrying to seek review of the State court judgment. The\ndistrict court agreed. But the Sixth Circuit just said\nRooker v. Feldman bars the as-applied challenge, but they\nremanded for a trial on the merits of the facial\nchallenge, which is not barred by Rooker v. Feldman. So\nan inmate who has been unsuccessful in the State court,\nunder Sixth Circuit law in my jurisdiction, can bring a\n1983 action.\nSo there are at least three vehicles that an\ninmate can bring -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And do you -- do you agree\nthat that's right? And you said that that's their theory,\nthat they could bring a 1983 action.\nMR. CASEY: We are not filing a petition for\ncertiorari from that decision. We are abiding by that\ndecision. We're going back and we're going to try that\ncase on the merits of the facial challenge to the statute.\nThat -- that case is Howard v. Whitbeck, docket number\n03-1396.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, what the other side\nsays is, well, yes, maybe they can bring these suits, but\nin all of those suits, they don't have counsel, what they\n-- what they -\nMR. CASEY: That's true. That -- that gets into\nthe -- the merits of the constitutional claim. And in our\nview, talking about the merits, all that is required in\nthe Michigan application for leave to appeal process is\nthat a defendant identify the issues and ask the appellate\ncourt to review it. Unlike Douglas, this is not a review\non the merits. An order denying an application for leave\nis not an affirmance. It's not an adjudication of the\nmerits of any legal issue.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what do we look to in\norder to verify what -- what you've just said? Do the\nMichigan appellate courts catch mistakes all the time?\nAnd if so, what's the standard that they use?\nMR. CASEY: The court rules concerning\napplications for leave do not set out specific standards.\nWhat -- what the court of appeals can do on an application\nfor leave is grant the application, deny it, or issue\nperemptory relief.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But what are the standards\nthey use? Where -- where do I look to find out what\nstandards they use, if I get there?\nMR. CASEY: To the best of my knowledge, there\nare no published standards in court rule or statute on\nthat. The court is free to exercise its discretion to -\nto deny leave for any reason that it chooses.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you give me an example of\nwhere they grant leave to appeal, and if not -- and it's\nnot one of the exceptions listed in the statute such as\nincorrect -\nMR. CASEY: If -- if --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- such as incorrect\nsentencing?\nMR. CASEY: Well, if -- under the statute, if\nthe court of appeals grants leave, counsel is\nautomatically appointed.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Right. What are the instances\nin which they grant leave, other than sentencing or some\nother statutory -\nMR. CASEY: They're -- most often they are\nsentencing issues. The statistics we put in our brief, in\nfootnote 25 of our brief, indicated that out of the -- in\n2001, there were 38,000 guilty plea convictions. The\ncourt of appeals that year disposed of 7,600 cases. 14\npercent of them were guilty plea appeals. Most of them\nwere disposed of by order. There were somewhere in the\nneighborhood of about 50 decisions -- opinions issued in\nguilty plea cases. I have not canvased all of them. I\nsuspect that the vast majority of them are sentencing\nissues.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we -- do we know whether\nany of those were cases that didn't fall under the four\ncategories where you a -- a right to?\nMR. CASEY: In every case where there was an\nopinion, counsel was appointed. The statute requires it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But one of the problems, I\nthought, for the indigent is the rulings -- am I correct\n-- in Michigan, that they're not required -- say, there's\nan objection. There's no written record that the indigent\ncould look to, even assuming he could understand it, to -\nto determine what issues might be raised on -- on appeal.\nMR. CASEY: I believe you're incorrect on that,\nYour Honor. The -- what an indigent inmate will -- or\ndefendant will have available to him to prepare an\napplication for leave to appeal is a transcript of the\nproceedings.\nhave whatever written motions and written decisions the\ntrial judge may have issued. He will have -- in the\ntranscript, he will have the oral motions and the\ndecisions of the judge, and then in addition to whatever\npro se materials, as in the Ross v. Moffitt case, the\ninmate can muster.\nIn -- in these cases, there are other pro se\nmaterials available. The district court's opinion in this\ncase noted that there is a -- a form brief, 38-page brief\nthat was circulating among inmates on the precise question\nof entitlement to counsel, which two of the defendants\nused in their State court appeals.\nBut in determining whether counsel is\nconstitutionally required under Ross v. Moffitt, this\nCourt has said you look to two things. Are the merits\ndecided? What is the nature of the appellate process?\nAnd if the merits are not being decided, as in the\nMichigan case, we say that falls within the Ross v.\nMoffitt line of cases, unlike the Douglas case. In -- in\naddition to the nature of the appellate proceedings, he -\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, now, your -\nyour opponents quote some language from the -- one of the\nMichigan court of appeals which suggests that the reason\nthat an appeal was denied was it had no merit.\nMR. CASEY:\nof appeals issues when it denies an application for leave\nto appeal says, denied for lack of merit on the grounds\npresented. But there is published, controlling Michigan\nauthority, which we cited in our brief, that says that\nlanguage does not mean that the court of appeals looked at\nthe merits of the underlying legal issue. What -- what\nthe court is looking at is the question of whether to\ngrant leave or deny leave. If they grant leave, counsel\nwill be appointed. In a very real sense --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what are they getting\nat when they say merit? I mean, I take it you concede\nthere was a quotation from that Contineri case on -- cited\non page 30 of their brief. I mean, what -- what is the\nreference to merit supposed to mean?\nMR. CASEY: I -- I do not know why the court of\nappeals uses that language. What I do know is that the -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't the reasonable thing to\nassume that they use it as we would normally expect it\nto --\nMR. CASEY: Well, the -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- to mean by the words they\nuse?\nMR. CASEY: On its face, that would be the first\nimpression that is given from those words. However, the\npublished opinions of the court of appeals we've cited in\nour brief reject that, and they say that in an application\nfor leave to appeal, the court of appeals is not\nadjudicating the merits.\nMy opposing counsel in this case was counsel of\nrecord in the Bulger case in the Michigan Supreme Court.\nHe made exactly that same argument. He persuaded the\ndissent in that opinion, but he did not persuade the\nmajority. They didn't decide the issue precisely, but he\nhas been arguing that ever since.\nBut the -- all the precedent that Michigan has\non that point we've cited in our brief. Those are not\ndecisions on the merits.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it true that Michigan is\nthe only State in the Union so far that denies counsel on\na first appeal, whether discretionary or mandatory?\nMR. CASEY: I believe that is incorrect. The\nplaintiffs have cited a 1987 habeas corpus case that\npurports to make a national survey. In the Michigan v.\nBulger Michigan Supreme Court opinion in footnote 3, they\ncited a 1992 Arizona study which reached almost an\nopposite conclusion. They said there were only seven\nStates which give unrestricted right of appeal, and there\nwere 21 States that prohibited appeals -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Not -- not the right of\nappeal. The right to counsel, whether it's a mandatory\nor -\nMR. CASEY: It's my understanding that Michigan\nmay be the only State that has a specific statute\nprohibiting it with exceptions like this, but it's also my\nunderstanding that the practice in many other States is\nthat counsel is routinely denied in appeals from guilty\npleas.\nI'd like to reserve my remaining time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Mr. Casey.\nMr. Moran, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. MORAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. MORAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nIn fact, in the 41 years since this Court's\ndecision in Douglas, no State, not one, not even a -- a\nterritorial jurisdiction, except for Michigan, has even\nattempted to deny counsel to any indigents appealing any\ntype of first tier appeal.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, Mr. Moran, this is a\nvery important question, whether the Michigan law can\nsurvive. But I think before we can address that, we have\nto decide whether there is standing for the lawyers you\nrepresent here today, and that's a much tougher question I\nthink.\nIs it possible that this Court could grant\ncertiorari in one of the pending petitions and resolve the\nunderlying issue of constitutionality of Michigan's\nunusual law?\nMR. MORAN: It is, of course, possible, Justice\nO'Connor, that this Court could do that.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And if we were to grant you\nstanding here, wouldn't we have sort of expanded our\nexisting holdings on who has standing?\nMR. MORAN: Not at all, Justice O'Connor. This\ncase fits squarely within the two prior lawyer-client\nstanding cases, the Triplett case in which this Court\nunanimously found standing for a -- for a lawyer\nrepresenting black lung claimants, and the Caplin &\nDrysdale case in which this Court found standing for a\nthird party assertion by a firm representing a criminal\ndefendant.\nAnd what those three cases have in common and\nwhat makes them unique is that this can only arise in a\ncase in which the statute or law being challenged\ndisentitles the client either through loss of funding or\nthrough, like Michigan's law, a statute -- disentitles the\nclient to representation. Any other change in the law,\ntort reform brought up by my -\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:\nreally disentitle the client to representation. It says\ncounsel won't be appointed for him. But presumably these\nlawyers could have offered their services.\nMR. MORAN: Mr. Chief Justice, that wouldn't be\npractical, and that raises a point that Justice Souter\nalso raised in the argument. It wouldn't be practical for\nMr. Fitzgerald or Mr. Vogler to offer their services pro\nbono to some indigent in this position because to do so\nwould probably -- probably be unethical or malpractice.\nFirst of all, they can't be appointed. What the statute\nprohibits is the appointment of counsel like Mr.\nFitzgerald and Mr. Vogler. So they -- they cannot form an\nattorney-client relationship by operation of law.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't the answer that all\nthey have to do is to say, okay, I will represent him but\nI am representing him with a claim for funds? And at the\nend of the day, regardless of what the Michigan law says,\nI'm going to say to the State of Michigan, through the\ncourt, pay me for what I did. That isn't a waiver and\nthere's nothing unethical about it.\nMR. MORAN: But Justice Souter, that's\nimpractical and unethical in this case because if Mr.\nFitzgerald and Mr. Vogler were to do that, they would have\nto represent the indigent on his or her underlying plea\nand sentencing issues -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right.\nMR. MORAN: -- or those would be lost forever -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Absolutely.\nMR. MORAN: -- because the time would fly. And\nso if they also represented him on the underlying plea and\nsentencing issues, then this person would not -- then the\nunderlying defendant would not be a person with standing\nto raise the lack of counsel because in fact they have\ncounsel.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, which -- which indigent\ndefendants are the attorney plaintiffs asserting claims on\nbehalf of here? Is it past defendants?\nMR. MORAN: This was -- this was -- for Mr.\nFitzgerald and Mr. Vogler, they were challenging both the\nprestatutory practice of the three defendant judges.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: You're talking about the two\nindividuals, but they've been dismissed.\nMR. MORAN: No. Mr. Fitzgerald and Mr. Vogler,\nJustice O'Connor, are the attorneys. They were -- they -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, I'm trying to find out\nwhat indigent criminal defendants are these attorneys\nattempting to represent here.\nMR. MORAN: They routinely take appointments.\nThey are on a list of --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR:\nMR. MORAN: Presently and future defendants.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Past defendants?\nMR. MORAN: Past defendants. They -- they -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, if it's past defendants\nwho were convicted and didn't have counsel, how is it\nconsistent with Heck v. Humphrey that they could be here,\nthese attorneys?\nMR. MORAN: I think I -- I think I misspoke. At\nthe time the statute was passed, it had not gone into\neffect. This challenge was filed in order to prevent the\nstatute from going into effect, to prevent approximately\n2,000 Michigan indigents a year being denied the right to\ncounsel.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, are you asserting then\nthat these attorney respondents are here trying to\nrepresent future defendants?\nMR. MORAN: Present and future defendants.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And if it's present\ndefendants, how is that consistent with Younger? How can\nthey do that?\nMR. MORAN: Well, they're not representing any\nnamed defendants. The -- the problem is that as the\nstatute goes into effect, they will presumably not receive\nany further funding for -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, if it's future people,\nhow is it consistent with Los Angeles v. Lyons? I mean, I\njust don't see how these attorney representatives get\nhere.\nMR. MORAN: Well, they're in exactly the same\nposition as the bartender in -- or the beer vendor in -\nin Craig v. Boren. They're representing prospective\nclients, prospective patients as in Singleton v. Wulff\nagain. This Court has over and over again -- in fact, in\nTriplett itself, this Court recognized that -\nspecifically said that in Triplett that it applied to\nprospective clients, that the -- and it said that in\nTriplett that -- it quoted the three factors. And it said\nthat -- excuse me. I'm looking at the wrong page. It\nsaid in Triplett that a restriction upon the fees a lawyer\nmay charge applied to the lawyer's prospective client of a\ndue process right to obtain legal representation falls\nsquarely within this principle. And that was the\nprinciple of third party standing that this Court cited -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, in Triplett,\nthe attorneys themselves were subject to discipline. They\nwere raising third party rights in order to defend a\nproceeding brought against themselves. It seems to me\nthat's distinguishable.\nMR. MORAN: That's -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the same thing in the bar\ncase. The -- the restriction against the sale of -- of\nliquor was a restriction imposed upon the person seeking\nto raise the third party right. But here, there's no\nrestriction that applies to these lawyers who are seeking\nto raise the third party right.\nMR. MORAN: But Justice Scalia, this Court has\nnever held that such a restriction is a condition\nprecedent or required in order for a person to assert\nthird party rights.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's so, but we've never held\nwhat you want us to hold either, that -- that when the law\ndoes not bear upon you personally, you have the right to\nraise the claim of a prospective client. We've never held\nthat either.\nMR. MORAN: Well, in -- Singleton is a case in\nwhich there was no direct sanction against the doctors who\nprovided Medicaid abortions.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, just as -- as to\nTriplett and Boren, you can't cite those two cases and say\nthose are controlling and then say, well, we've never held\nit.\nMR. MORAN: I'm sorry. I didn't follow that\nquestion, Justice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we've said that Triplett\nand -- and Boren are -- are distinguishable, and you said,\nwell, we've never ruled on this point. Well, then\nTriplett and Boren aren't controlling.\nMR. MORAN: Well, I think you have ruled on this\nCourt -- point by many times recognizing that even persons\nagainst whom the statute or law would not directly affect\n-- for example, all the way back to 1925 with Pierce v.\nSociety of Sisters, there was no legal prohibition against\nthe school. The legal prohibition was against the\nstudents not going to public school. So 80 years ago this\nCourt recognized that. In a situation analogous to this,\nthe school -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It was -- a prohibition was\non the parents and there were no parents as plaintiffs in\nthat case -\nMR. MORAN: That's right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- only the schools.\nMR. MORAN: That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.\nIt was the school that was -- was held to have standing to\nassert the rights of future and current students, and the\nsame is true of the Singleton case where, again, there was\nno particular restriction against the doctors. It was\nsimply that they would not get funding.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there was a problem,\nwasn't there, in Singleton that -- that the part that said\nthat the doctors could raise the patients' right as\nopposed to the doctor's own right to practice or whatever,\nthat that was only a plurality?\nMR. MORAN: That was a plurality portion of the\nopinion.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it shouldn't be cited\nthen. You're citing it for something that the Court\ndidn't hold.\nMR. MORAN: Well, actually we've cited it in our\nbrief only for the article III proposition which this\nCourt unanimously agreed that the doctors had article III\nstanding because there was an economic energy -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- I thought you were\nciting it here for the quite different proposition that -\nthat you can raise third party rights.\nMR. MORAN: But ultimately this Court in\nSingleton allowed the doctors' claim on behalf of the\npatients to proceed. I understand that it was a plurality\nopinion on the -- on the jus tertii standing.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I could accept -- I guess\nI probably would accept your position if I did not think\nthere -- there was another equally workable alternative\nhere. And I didn't understand your answer to my earlier\nquestion in which you said, if I recall correctly, that it\nwould be unethical for these lawyers to represent a -- a\nboth of the client and, I suppose, of themselves, but\nessentially on behalf of a client, say, there is a right\nto State money to pay the lawyer who is representing them.\nIt would be, as I understood you to say, unethical for the\nlawyer to proceed on that basis. And I don't understand\nthe reason for your answer.\nMR. MORAN: I think I might have misunderstood\nyour question, Justice Souter. The question I understood\nwas why don't they represent people and raise only the\nentitlement to right to counsel. In the Bulger case, for\nexample, the Michigan Supreme Court -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, no. I'm assuming they -\nthey represent the client for all purposes and one of the\nclient's claims is, pay my lawyer. I don't have any\nmoney. Your statute is unconstitutional. Why cannot the\nlawyer pursue that claim on behalf of the client and -\nand raise exactly the issue that is being raised in\nsubstance here?\nMR. MORAN: If that attempt -- if that method\nwere attempted, Mr. Casey would undoubtedly argue that the\nattorney would not be entitled to any funding because the\nattorney was never appointed. You can't just go out and\nfind indigents that you would like to represent. You have\nto be formally appointed.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, except that that's a very\nformalistic answer. The -- the claim, in effect, would be\nI have a right to be appointed whatever your statute says\nbecause -- or my -- the -- the client would say my lawyer\n-- I have a right to appointed counsel, whatever your\nstatute says, with the consequence of payment. So to say,\nwell, they're not appointed, that's the question. Should\nthey be appointed? I don't see why they cannot raise that\nissue.\nMR. MORAN: The problem is is that the way the\nMichigan system works, it works on a strict rotation\nsystem, and so there's no -- there's no line-jumping here.\nThere's no right for a -- a client to -- to request a\ncertain attorney, for a certain attorney to go the head of\nthe queue and say I would like to represent that fellow\nand be -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but these -- these\nlawyers are in the rotation. Are you suggesting that the\nrotation is so enormous that it will be 20 years before\nthey get another client?\nMR. MORAN: No, not at all. They --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. MORAN: They routinely -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, your -- your claim is\nthat they are going to get clients in the future and they\n-- they ought to have a right to be paid when the time\ncomes. So why doesn't, number one, a lawyer representing\nthe next client, whoever he may be, have a right to raise\nthis, and why doesn't each one of these lawyers have a\nright to raise it presumably within a reasonable time when\nthey next come up in the rotation?\nMR. MORAN: I think it's clear that the Michigan\ncourts would unquestionably hold that a lawyer who simply\ninserts himself into a relationship without formal court\nappointment is not entitled to be paid.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Sure they would, and that's\nwhat will get brought to this Court. That's what we're\nhere for.\nMR. MORAN: But the problem is, Justice Souter,\nwe would then have an issue of Michigan law inserted as to\nwhether -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, because the claim is that\nthey have a right under Federal law to an effective\nprocedure whereby paid counsel can be supplied to them.\nThat's a Federal issue, not a State issue.\nMR. MORAN: That part is a Federal issue, but\nwhat Michigan -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's all you've got to get up\nhere.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's at least an argument.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It's an argument.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And even if they lose on it,\nthey still will have -- would have raised the issue that\nyou are most concerned about getting raised. They're not\n-- they're not so much interested in the so many dollars\nfor this particular representation. Even if they lose on\nwhat seems to me at least a close argument, they will have\nraised the question you're trying to raise today.\nMR. MORAN: And they will have to do so without\nany prospect of being paid, and that's -- that's the\nproblem.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Who's paying them for this\nlawsuit?\nMR. MORAN: They're not being paid for this\nlawsuit.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right. Exactly the same\nsituation. They can -- they can bring the case directly\nfor the client they're representing just as readily as\nthey can bring this one. And if that is true, why is\nthere an impediment to raising the issue unless we\nrecognize third party standing?\nMR. MORAN: Because Justice Souter, they would\nhave to represent them on all of their issues. They would\nhave to represent them on their plea and sentencing issues\nwithout being paid. And that's not what they're doing in\nthis -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Without being paid if they\nlose -\nMR. MORAN: -- in this litigation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- being paid if they win. In\nthis case, if they win, they don't get a dime because\nthey're not representing a client. All they get is a\ndeclaration.\nMR. MORAN: And --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And they'd be better off to\nrepresent a real client.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's right. They have a shot\nat getting paid using this other method.\nMR. MORAN: In -- in this lawsuit, if we win on\nthe merits, they will then get far more appointments on\nthe rotation system and then they will get paid for those\nappointments.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why will they get more\nappointments?\nMR. MORAN: Because --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I thought you said there's a\nstrict rotation system. When your name comes up, you get\nan appointment. How is that going to change regardless of\nhow this comes out?\nMR. MORAN: Because the statute, which is now in\neffect -- and this goes, by the way, back to the issue of\nprudential standing -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, you're just saying there -\nthere's going to be a further class of clients to be\nrepresented on the rotation.\nMR. MORAN: Correct. Far more.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but that's -- that's\ntrue.\nMR. MORAN: And -- and while this Court\nconsiders these issues of prudential standing, thousands\nof Michigan defendants will be denied the right to\ncounsel -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And while this suit is being\nbrought, we can't do the simple thing, which is to take a\ncase from an indigent who's raising it that we happen to\nhave on our docket and face it directly because everybody\nis tied up in these knots on standing. I mean, what -\nwhat is it that -- that you -- led you to bring this case\nrather than just filing an amicus brief in a case brought\nby a real indigent who wants a lawyer?\nMR. MORAN: Because there -- there was no person\nin position at the time. The problem was we had to file\nthis litigation before the statute went into effect\nbecause once the statute went into effect, thousands of\nMichigan indigents would be denied the right to counsel\nevery year and would suffer probably irreparable damage to\ntheir right to appeal -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I see -- I see that. That's a\ngood answer.\nAnd the -- the question I have is if I now,\nsince we have real indigents, believe that there\nabsolutely is a way for a real indigent to raise this\nclaim that isn't even hard, you could file an amicus\nbrief. Suppose I believed that, and I do believe it\nactually. If I believe it, then does your third party\nstanding claim disappear?\nMR. MORAN: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, if it doesn't\ndisappear and I hold in your favor, would I then be\nopening the door to any lawyer whose pocketbook is hurt by\ntort reform, by any change at all, you know, that means\nless money for him, and we'd be besieged with people?\nInstead of the clients, we'd have all the lawyers in\ncomplaining that they want to be richer. Now, that's\nwhat's worrying me. So on my assumption, how could I\npossibly decide in your favor without opening that door?\nMR. MORAN: Your -\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's the question I'd like\nanswered.\nMR. MORAN: Your Honor, the only kind of case to\nwhich this applies is a case exactly like Triplett, a case\nexactly like Caplin & Drysdale where the claim is that the\nunderlying change in the law or the underlying law\ndisenfranchises or disentitles the indigent or the\ncriminal defendant or the defendant to representation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because?\nMR. MORAN: Because, first of all, if the\nindigent or the client still has representation, then\nthere is no hindrance to the third party raising it\nthemselves.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that? Why would a\nchange in substantive law --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I assumed there's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- have the same result?\nSuppose there's a change in -- in the antitrust law and -\nand the person says this change -- this change has the -\nthe effect of -- of denying me equal protection of the\nlaw. That's the claim that the -- that the client would\nhave. But there's a lawyer who says, my goodness, this\nchange will mean there are many -- many fewer antitrust\nsuits. I can demonstrate that. That's my specialty,\nantitrust law. I'm going to lose a lot of business. Why\nwouldn't he have the right to raise the equal protection\nclaim of the prospective client?\nMR. MORAN: Because the client could raise it\ndirectly, represented by the attorney. And so the third\nprong in jus tertii standing would be clearly missing in\nthat case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. I'm sorry. I -- I -\nJustice Scalia and I were assuming the same thing. If I\nassume that there's no problem with the real person, the\nindigent, raising the claim himself -- and I'm saying on\nthat assumption, which I believe, then if I were to decide\nin your favor, how would I not be opening the door that I\nwanted to keep firmly closed?\nMR. MORAN: But this Court's precedents\nindicate, Justice Breyer, that the indigents do have a\nsignificant hindrance to filing their claims themselves.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, okay. No. I agree with\nyou. If in fact you think that there's a problem about a\nreal indigent bringing a claim in Michigan, although we\nhave two on the docket, if I accepted that premise, I\nwould begin to think you were right. So then what I was\ntrying to explore is whether the whole thing comes down to\nwhether I accept that premise. And of course, that's\nwhat's everybody has been talking about, and I do see at\nthe moment a couple of very good ways that indigents can\nbring it themselves, and indeed they have.\nMR. MORAN: But I think -\nJUSTICE BREYER: But everything comes down to\nthat. Right?\nMR. MORAN: I think an answer I need to give to\n-- to cut through all of this is that third party standing\nis never predicated on the impossible. Third party\nstanding is never predicated on the idea that third party\nstanding is appropriate only if it is impossible for some\nindigent to make it into court or some third party or the\nperson whose rights are being violated to make it into\ncourt. All that must be shown from this Court's\nprecedents is a hindrance. So this Court did not require\nin Craig v. Boren that it was impossible that some young\nman could get his claim in front of the court.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It was altogether possible\nthere had been a young man. The problem was he turned 21.\nSo the case would -- from his point of view was moot.\nMR. MORAN: Right, but this Court never\nsuggested that it was -- showing that it was impossible\nfor someone to quickly get his claim before the court\nwas --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I think I agree with you on\nthat. I'm just -- the reason I think it's so easy is\nbecause we get indigents. We get thousands of them. And\nall you have to have is some indigent saying, hey, I want\na lawyer. Okay? That's all. He has to be able to write\nthose words. And at that point, you and the others come\nin with amicus briefs, if necessary, and support him.\nMR. MORAN: Well, the problem is is that in the\nmeantime thousands of Michigan indigents are going to be\ndenied counsel.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you a practical\nquestion about what is currently before the Court? Mr.\nCasey I think told us that the Halbert case is on for the\nOctober 8th conference. If we should grant cert in either\nof those direct from the Michigan Supreme Court -\nMichigan Supreme Court following Bulger, so you always\nleave before then. If we should grant in either of those\ncases, wouldn't the wise thing be to simply hold this case\ntill those are decided?\nMR. MORAN: That may well be a wise course of\naction -- action, Justice Ginsburg.\nI should point out that Mr. Casey, when he filed\nthe response to the Bulger cert petition, brought this\nCourt's attention to the fact that this underlying\nlitigation was proceeding in a case that was then called\nTesmer v. Granholm. And so he brought to this Court's\nattention that we had already prevailed in Federal\ndistrict court in Tesmer v. Granholm as a suggestion as to\nwhy this Court did not need to grant cert in the Bulger\ncase, and so this Court did not grant cert. I don't know,\nof course -- I don't know why this Court did not grant\ncert in Bulger.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But he said now he's not\ntaking that position in the Halbert case.\nMR. MORAN: But I can be confident that if there\nare any procedural hurdles to this Court's exercise of\njurisdiction in any of the State cases, Mr. Casey will\nalert this Court of them. And there may well be. For\nexample, in the Melody Harris case, the Michigan Supreme\nCourt remanded for further -- remanded for her to then\nfile an application for leave to appeal on her underlying\nplea and sentencing issues without the assistance of\ncounsel. Was the Michigan Supreme Court's order a final\norder? I don't know. This Court would obviously have to\nresolve that. But I can be confident that Mr. Casey will\ncertainly bring up any procedural hurdles.\nAnd of course, this Court cannot exercise\njurisdiction it does not have in a case just because it\nwould be more convenient to do so. This Court does have\njurisdiction in this case.\nThe petitioners never challenged prudential\nstanding at any point in this litigation -- they -- they\nchallenged only article III standing, injury in fact -\nuntil this Court. And so part of the reason we don't have\na better record is because this came on a motion to\ndismiss. This Court recognized in Lujan that a motion to\ndismiss is different than a summary judgment, requires a\n-- a different procedural posture. It requires the\nassumption of facts being true.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but no facts -- no\nadditional facts would -- would affect the central point\nthat -- that we've been devoting most of this discussion\nto, which is whether there is an impediment or not to -\nto the -- the actual individuals whose rights your clients\nare asserting raising their own rights. No additional\nfacts bear upon that it seems to me.\nMR. MORAN: I agree with you on that, Justice\nScalia.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Then what case holds that\nthere must be an impediment for the third party? I keep\ncoming back to Craig against Boren. They could have filed\nanother class action and say that they filed a class\naction and had standing. Would we have suddenly decided\nwe won't decide the merits even though it's been argued\nand both sides have had their day in court?\nMR. MORAN: I agree with you, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What is the source of the\nrequirement there must be an impediment to the third party\nsuit?\nMR. MORAN: Well, this Court has said so many\ntimes, and Powers v. Ohio, for example, noted the\nimpediment to the -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That -- where they granted\nstanding.\nMR. MORAN: That's right.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Have they ever denied\nstanding on the ground that there was no impediment to the\nthird party suit? I don't think we have.\nMR. MORAN: I don't believe in all of the cases\nthat both parties cited that there are any cases in which\nthis Court has said that there was no impediment to the\nthird party. It is -- it is certainly not the standard -\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, do you think\nthat was just idle observation then?\nMR. MORAN: Not at all, Mr. Chief Justice. I\ndidn't mean to be light about that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It doesn't have to be idle to\nbe dicta, though, does it?\nMR. MORAN: There -- we -- we fully concede\nthere need to be an impediment, but what it does not\nrequire is the showing that it is impossible for someone\nto get here. What is a showing is that for most -- for\nthe average person in the class, just like the average\ngrand juror in Campbell v. Louisiana, or the average\nvenire person in Powers v. Ohio, there are impediments to\ngetting here.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you fully concede there\nmust be an impediment even though the Court has never so\nheld?\nMR. MORAN: I'm willing to concede that because\nit is so clear to me that there is, that there is an\nimpediment that trying to get into Federal court, trying\nto get here, for that matter, trying to get into Federal\ndistrict court -- for an indigent, a typical person who is\nvery likely -- someone like Mr. Carter, functionally\nilliterate, poorly educated, completely unaware of his\nrights, to try and navigate the -- the procedural hurdles\nof the Michigan system to get all the way through the\nMichigan system and then into Federal court, that is a\ndaunting hurdle. And that's Evitts v. Lucey. This Court\nhas recognized time and time again in -- in plea cases,\nRoe v. -- Roe v. Flores-Ortega. This Court has recognized\ntime and time again in Peguero that even in a plea case a\ntypical indigent is completely incapable of getting his or\nher case held -- heard, especially if you have to go\nthrough multiple layers of appeal without a counsel for\nthe first tier. And that is the problem here.\nOn the merits, I certainly would like to correct\nMr. Casey's representations about the -- the nature of the\nMichigan system. The -- a properly filed application for\nleave to appeal is invariably denied for lack of merit in\nthe grounds presented.\nlook at each and every one of the cases that Mr. Casey has\ncited for the proposition that that is not a determination\non the merits because not one of them says that. Not one\nof them specifically says that a order denying leave for\nlack of merit on the grounds presented is not a decision\non the merits.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could -- could you give me an\nexample, just from your experience in practice, where\nthere's an important issue raised after a guilty plea that\nrequires an appeal where it's not one of the statutory\nexceptions?\nMR. MORAN: Many, many.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Most -- what are -- what are\nthose cases?\nMR. MORAN: Improper denial of jail credit,\nmaking -- improper denial of jail credit.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's not sentencing?\nMR. MORAN: That is a sentencing error.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay, but that's covered by\nthe statute.\nMR. MORAN: No, it's not. The statute -- the\nonly exceptions in the statute are for guidelines\ndepartures -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay.\nMR. MORAN:\nindigent gets the appeal granted, but that's putting -\nthat's after the indigent has had to file an application\nidentifying his or her own issues without any assistance\nof counsel.\nDouble jeopardy issues. Double jeopardy issues\narise in Michigan all the time; whether sentences should\nbe consecutive or concurrent; whether there's been a\nbreach of the plea bargain. All of these issues arise in\nMichigan courts every day, and while we are --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there instances where\nMichigan has denied the right to appeal when those claims\nare raised?\nMR. MORAN: The problem, Your Honor, is that an\nindigent can't raise -- a typical indigent would be\ncompletely incapable of identifying this -- these sorts of\nissues.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: His counsel will have raised\nthem. And -- and most, if not all, of those have to have\nbeen raised by counsel.\nMR. MORAN: Your Honor, Michigan requires that\nineffective assistance of counsel claims be raised on\ndirect appeal. So if counsel has not raised the issue,\nthen the indigent would have to recognize that by -- by\nhimself, and then raise that issue, the ineffective\nassistance of counsel, on direct appeal.\nFurther, even if counsel has recognized it, what\nwe typically would have would be an oral objection at a\nsentencing hearing. For example, Your Honor, I think\nthese sentences should be concurrent, and the judge says,\nno, I'm going to make them consecutive. That's an oral\nobjection. The indigent will have to be able to get the\ntranscripts, get the register of actions, get all the\nnecessary documents, realize that that's a winning issue,\nthat it does not put him at additional risk. That's\nanother factor. One of the -- one of the points that a\ncounsel can help with is tell an indigent, you don't want\nto take this appeal because success may result in\nrevocation of the plea bargain and an additional risk -\nwill have to realize that this is in my best interest to\ngo ahead with this appeal. This is my issue. Find the\ncases, find the controlling authority.\nAnd even issues as complex as a Blakely issue,\nwhich this Court, of course, will be dealing with this\nafternoon, that is an open issue of Michigan law right\nnow. Is -- are the Michigan sentencing guidelines\nunconstitutional or at least the application of them as a\nresult of this Court's decision in Blakely? Right now, as\na result of the order in Melody Harris, a typical Michigan\nindigent will have to raise that complex issue of Sixth\nan impossible burden, or the issue will be lost forever.\nAnd that is -- that is a burden that no indigent can meet.\nAnd so I would hope that this Court would not\nget hung up on the standing issue because this issue is so\nimportant right now, as a result of the Michigan Supreme\nCourt's order. Right now these issues are happening and\nright now Michigan indigents are being denied the\nassistance of counsel. Unique in the Nation. And so this\ncase has been adversely argued. That's the point of\nprudential standing. The petitioners waived the\nprudential standing issues below. They challenged only\narticle III standing. And so there is every reason for\nthis Court not to wait for a perfect case that may never\ncome.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you familiar with the\nHalbert case? You mentioned that there might be a\nfinality problem in Harris.\nMR. MORAN: I'm not familiar with that case,\nYour Honor. I just became aware of it by letter a few\ndays ago and I have not had a chance to find out anything\nmore about it. I have not seen the cert petition in that\ncase. I'm not aware of the underlying -- excuse me -- the\nunderlying order from the Michigan courts in that case.\nBut there may never be a perfect case, but this\nrequirements for prudential standing. Article III\nstanding is clearly met in this case, and I hope this\nCourt will affirm the decision of the Sixth Circuit.\nIf this Court has no further questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Moran.\nMr. Casey, you have 3 minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS L. CASEY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Did you waive the objection to\nprudential standing -\nMR. CASEY: We did not waive any of the standing\nclaims in this case. We've discussed that in our reply\nbrief. I've cited pages of the briefs where these issues\nwere discussed. And the overriding fact is that the\ndistrict court, the three-judge panel in the court of\nappeals, and the en banc Sixth Circuit all decided these\nissues. They have been properly raised and preserved and\nthey're before the Court.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did you file a brief in\nopposition in Halbert?\nMR. CASEY: Yes, I did. I filed that about a\nmonth ago.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And does that have any\nprocedural impediments?\nMR. CASEY: Not to my knowledge. That\nindividual was convicted in pleas, asked for counsel\nciting the Federal litigation in this Kowalski v. Tesmer\ncase. It was denied. He filed a pro se application for\nleave to appeal challenging the denial of counsel and\nraising his sentencing issues --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So what was the basis for\nyour opposition to cert?\nMR. CASEY: That the Court need not grant cert\nin that case because the issue is pending in this case.\nIf -- if this case goes away, then I suspect we will agree\nthat that would be an appropriate vehicle to decide the\nconstitutional issue. As long as this case is pending in\nwhich the issue is raised, I suggested that the Court need\nnot grant cert in that case to decide the issue. If the\nissue is not going to be decided in this case, then that\nwould be an appropriate vehicle to raise and decide the\nissue.\nOn the standing point, if the plaintiffs here\nare given standing, it would be a significant expansion of\nthis Court's standing doctrine. This Court has never\nfound third party standing when a litigant is not directly\naffected by a statute and there is no close existing\nrelationship with the third party and there is no\nhindrance. We've discussed many cases in which some of\nthese factors are present and others are distinguishing\nfactors. This -- this case is, in some respects, unlike\nall of them. There would be a significant expansion of\nthe doctrine.\nOn the merits of the issue, a constitutional\nright to appointed counsel, under the Michigan system,\nplease read the cases I've cited in my brief, particularly\nthe Bobenal decision, which I've cited in my principal\nbrief. In a footnote in my brief, I quote the orders that\nthe court of appeals was considering. They have the same\nlanguage that is at issue here. Controlling Michigan\nprecedent says that applications for leave to appeal are\nnot decisions on the merits. All an inmate has to do is\nidentify the issues. That can be done. It has been done,\nas seen by the two pending petitions for cert.\nIf the Court has no further questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Casey.\n"
