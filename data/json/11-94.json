        "content": "(11:05 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Case 11-94, Southern Union Company v. The United\nStates.\nMr. Phillips.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nIn its landmark decision in Apprendi, this\nCourt announced as a fundamental principle of Fifth and\nSixth Amendment jurisprudence that every fact necessary\nto increase the punishment beyond that which is\notherwise maximally provided for must be presented to\nthe jury and must be decided by the jury beyond a\nreasonable doubt.\nIn this particular case, the defendant was\nfined a total of an $18 million penalty in the context\nof a jury finding that there was a single day of\nviolation under the RCRA provision. Congress is quite\nexplicit that the maximum fine for a single day's\nviolation is $50,000.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was that jury trial\nconstitutionally required?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, I believe the jury trial\nwas constitutionally required, Justice Scalia. The\ncutoff between what's a petty offense not subject to\njury trial and what's beyond that -- I think you could\n-- you could get there two ways. This is a crime that\nCongress attaches a 5-year penalty to if it's against an\nindividual, which suggests that it is a very serious\ncrime. And the maximum fine under the district judge's\ninterpretation of this would have been $38 million, even\nthough the judge chose only to impose an $18 million\npenalty under these circumstances. So, either way, it\nseems to me clearly a serious offense.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What have we said is the\nstandard for fines?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What have we said with\nreference to a jury trial when fines are involved? Does\nit have to be a substantial fine or do we have a word\nthat we use?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, you haven't used a word\n-- I mean, the distinction is between a serious offense\nand a petty offense, and the places where the -- you\nknow, you've drawn the line to conclude that a fine was\ntoo small to be worried about was -- was $10,000 in the\nMuniz case. You recognized in Bagwell that 52 million\nwas way beyond what would be appropriate under those\ncircumstances.\nBut I think the Court benefits most if it\njust focuses on the potential penalties that Congress\nhas adopted and use that as the guidepost, because if\nCongress has said that this is something for which\nsomeone could be punished --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you have to do that\nbecause you have to know whether -- whether to impanel a\njury before the -- before the jury comes in or before\nthe jury comes in with a penalty, right?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, absolutely. And we\nasserted our right to a jury trial. The government\ndidn't contest our right to a jury trial. And I don't\nactually read their brief --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do we assume for purposes of\nthis case that your client, a corporation, has a Sixth\nAmendment right to a jury trial?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think the language of the\nSixth Amendment couldn't be clearer, that it says in all\ncriminal prosecutions, the -- the accused is entitled to\na jury trial, and all -- and you know, Article III,\nsection 2, says in all jury trial -- in all criminal\nprosecutions, there's a jury trial. So, there is no\neffort whatsoever to limit the -- the individual, or in\nany way to -- the person or persons or entities that are\nentitled to those rights.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What are the peers of the\nSouthern Union Company that would sit on the jury?\nOther railroads?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, that would have been --\nwe'd probably have had a different outcome if that had\nbeen the case. But, no, Your Honor, obviously \"peers\"\nin that context is -- is derived from the citizenry in\nthe State or the district in which the prosecution is\nbrought. I mean, obviously, we don't get corporate\npeers in that sense, but -- but no one has ever doubted\nthat an ordinary jury would be a suitable jury of peers\nfor corporations, and, candidly, corporations are tried\nall of the time, and no one has doubted it. And I don't\nthink it -- you know, first of all, it seems clear,\nunder the language of the Sixth Amendment and Article\nIII, that corporations are entitled to a jury and that\nno one is -- in anything that's a serious offense, and\nthat clearly is what we have here.\nAnd so, what we've got is a decision by the\njury that there was at a -- at a single point in time a\nviolation of RCRA.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's not -- the jury\ndidn't say that the defendant was in violation only 1\nday. It said it was in violation within this span of\nmany months, and it didn't say how many days. It didn't\nsay whether it was every day or 1 day or 10 days. It\njust didn't focus on the number of days. But it didn't\nfind they were in violation only 1 day, which is what\nyour opening statement was.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. But what the -- what\nthe First Circuit said, Justice Ginsburg, is that the --\nthe most you could read the jury to have found, because\nit was not asked the question, the most you could read\nout of it, was that there was a single day of a\nviolation, and that that then sets the maximum.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The most -- the most you\nmust read out of it.\nMR. PHILLIPS: The most you must read out of\nit.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. You could -- you\ncould say it could have meant -- they could have thought\nthat they violated every day.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. They could have.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You can't say that for\nsure. But one thing you can say for sure is that they\nfound that it violated it 1 day.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. That's correct,\nJustice Scalia, and that, therefore, if you apply the\ncore Apprendi doctrine in a principled way, as\nJustice Kennedy suggested in a separate concurrence, if\nyou applied it in a principled way, you determine what\n-- what facts are supported by the jury's findings and\nhow far does the penalty take it, and it goes to\n$50,000, and anything beyond the $50,000, if it's found\nby the judge, doesn't satisfy the Sixth or Fifth\nAmendment under those circumstances.\nThat should be in my judgment the end of the\ninquiry. The First Circuit rejected that argument by\nturning to Oregon v. Ice and suggesting that there was a\nfundamental shift in how the Court applies the Apprendi\ndoctrine. And I -- I would suggest to you that,\nalthough you're clearly better positioned to determine\nwhat you thought you meant by Ice than I am, my\ninterpretation of Ice is that it deals with the very\ndifferent situation of multiple offenses and the very\ndifferent problem of trying to extend the Apprendi\ndoctrine to the context of multiple convictions and then\nadopted a methodology for applying it in those\ncircumstances that focus significantly on a particular\nhistory of consecutive versus concurrent sentences --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I didn't think --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- in that context.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I was -- I tend to\nbe in dissent in these cases; so, I don't have the\nauthoritative view. But the --\nMR. PHILLIPS: More so than I do, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What?\nMR. PHILLIPS: More so than I do.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, but no. But the\nimpression I have is that -- that I had thought there\nwere what I'd call the elements of the offense, and then\nthere were sentencing facts. And sentencing facts have\nbeen traditionally facts found by the judge when\nimposing a sentence.\nNow, the majority of the Court in Apprendi\nwent back into the history and said there is no\nsignificant old tradition, old enough, of -- of\nsentencing facts. So, really, when you raise the\nsentence, that's like an element, and you should have a\njury trial.\nNow, the argument here, one of them, that the\ngovernment stresses -- and Ice is the same -- is that\nthere is no -- the tradition's different where fines and\nwhere multiple and concurrent sentences were at issue.\nIf you go back to the 18th century or\nearlier, what you'll discover is that the judge has\nalways had a much greater role in deciding what the\namount of a fine should be. And, therefore, insofar as\nthat amount rested upon some view of the facts as to the\nmanner in which the crime occurred -- and it always\ndoes -- it was the judge who traditionally found it, not\nthe jury. So, those facts are not like elements of the\ncrime.\nThat's what I thought was essentially the\nargument. Ice and fines are on one side of that line,\nand Apprendi is on the other.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think the -- the problem\nwith that analysis, Justice Breyer, is I don't think the\nhistory, first of all, is anywhere near as clear in this\ncontext as it was, for instance, in Ice in terms of who\ndecided what. It is -- there is no history that\nsuggests that judges had the authority to impose fines\nbeyond whatever the maximum statutory limit that was\nprovided for by the legislature involved. And if you --\nand if you go through --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. They're not doing\nthat here. What they're deciding is a fact of\nsentencing is how often this crime was committed. No\none can go against the statutory limit, but rather it --\nit allows a higher sentence when certain facts occur.\nNow, I thought in Apprendi that the history\nis just what I'm saying it was in -- in the fine case,\nbut the majority says to the contrary. And so, here it\nseems, even if I was wrong in Apprendi, that at least\nthere's enough discretion here to say, look, this is\ntraditionally up to the judge. Now, why do you think\nthat isn't so?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Because it never was\ntraditionally up to the judge to go beyond whatever the\nmaximum sentence provided was. Justice Thomas's\nconcurrence in Apprendi spends a significant amount of\ntime with that history. He several times references\njury -- I mean fines and jury determinations and\nconsistently finds that the same rule applies in the\nfine context as applies in the -- in the incarceration\ncontext.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Phillips, do you think\nthat you could say that there was no going above the\nstatutory maximum here? In other words, you know, if\nthe judge had said, well, it's $500 a day, I'm going to\nfind some facts and fine you $600 a day, that would be\ngoing above a statutory maximum.\nBut I'm wondering whether this is different\nbecause here the judge was sticking to the $500 a day\nthat was set out in the statute, and then the question\nis more, you know, of an -- is it an element or is it a\n-- is it a sentencing fact as to how many days the\nviolation occurred?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, Justice Kagan, I would\nhave thought, if anything, our case would be a much\neasier one, because what you -- what you basically are\nsaying is that the district judge on the basis of a\nnon-reasonable doubt standard and without a jury is\nmaking a determination that there have been 761\nviolations of Federal law and, on that basis, imposing a\nsentence.\nIt would seem to me that, whatever else you\nmight want to say Apprendi should limit, it would be the\nwhole idea that the judge gets to determine every aspect\nof all elements of the crime and the punishment that\nattaches to it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there an objection at\ntrial to the charge on the ground that it didn't\ninstruct the jury to find the number of days of\nviolation?\nMR. PHILLIPS: The United States didn't\nobject to that. No, Your Honor. Actually, we didn't\nobject to it either, and it wasn't an instruction that\nwas offered by either of the parties. The judge\nactually was the one who divined the instruction with\nrespect to a single --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You have no inducement\nto --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But this was in the\ncontext where the entire defense of the corporation was\nconsistent with what the indictment said. It was\nbetween the dates on or about, and there -- it would be\nvery strange under this evidence to think that it was\nonly there for 1 day, when it was spilled and they came\nback. And so, that just doesn't make any sense.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, Justice Kennedy --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I think there's -- that's\njust more a sense of background. I do think we have to\nreach the issue you -- you present as if it were just --\nas if there were no evidence.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I -- like Justice\nGinsburg, I was very surprised the government didn't\nallege -- didn't stress waiver here. You didn't submit\nan instruction?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, the -- yes, we didn't\nsubmit an instruction. On the other hand, neither side\nsubmitted the particular instruction that the judge\nadopted in this particular case. But what I think is\nimportant is to put it in the context of the -- of the\nevidence at trial and the way it was analyzed by the\nFirst Circuit under the -- on the harmless error\nstandard. Remember that the issue here is not that they\nsimply have mercury in a particular location without a\npermit. The question was, did they -- were they holding\nit with an intent to recycle it at some point and to\nmake it a usable product?\nAnd there were three different points in\ntime when evidence clearly demonstrated an intent to\nobtain an RFP to handle the product in precisely that\nway, even up to the summer of 2004, and the indictment\nonly runs to October of 2004.\nSo, the notion that it could be a -- a\nsignificantly shorter period, maybe not -- maybe not\njust a day, ultimately, but clearly you can't -- we just\ndon't know because no one asked under those\ncircumstances. The First Circuit said this could not be\nviewed as harmless error, and I think that's not\nchallenged by the United States at this stage in the\nlitigation.\nAnd so, it seems to me, as you say,\nJustice Kennedy, you have to evaluate the pure issue\nof -- you have 1 day of violation, that's the\ndetermination, and when -- and to take the Apprendi\ndoctrine. As it -- as it's stated, it's quite plain.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Phillips, can you\ndeal with one policy argument that your adversary raised\nthat gives me some pause? And that is, the number of\ndays is certainly something that the jury here could --\nrelatively easily decided upon. It could have looked at\nthe evidence and figured that out --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- okay? But in fraud\ncases, in securities cases, sometimes the identity of\nvictims is not determined for months, till months after\nthe conviction, and the amount of fine and/or\nrestitution is set at sentencing.\nWhat's going to happen to all of those\nstatutes --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- because -- or all of\nthose procedures that have been set up by Congress to\nsort of set the amount of loss and repayment? Are all\nof those subject to the Apprendi rule?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I dont -- I don't think so.\nI mean, the lower courts have been pretty consistent on\nthe question of restitution, that restitution is, one,\nnot a punishment within the meaning of Apprendi; and,\ntwo, it's indeterminate. And as a consequence of that,\nthe jury doesn't have to make that determination.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, isn't -- aren't\nfines indeterminate here by definition, going back to\nJustice Kagan's question? There's no upper limit to how\nmuch the fine could be here. It's set -- the upper\nlimit is set by the number of days, but why is it\ndifferent?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, because it is set by\nthe --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why is restitution --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Because it is set by the\nnumber of days --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, so -- so --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- which requires a predicate\nfinding of how many days.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, how about when a\nfine is set by the value of the loss?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's no different than\nrestitution.\nMR. PHILLIPS: And the government will have\nto figure out what it -- what it -- its best take as to\nthe value of the loss, and it's going to have to prove\nthat if that's going to be the basis on which to fine.\nJUSTICE BREYER: My goodness, I think\nthere's lots of statutes that say something like this:\nThat within limits, if there's a particular --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, if it's within limits,\nthat's fundamentally different.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, leave that out\nbecause we assume -- right.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It says, the fine, the\nmaximum fine is going to be \"not more than the greater\nof twice the gross gain or twice the gross loss.\"\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, you're going to send\nthat to the jury. Let me read you the next phase --\nphrase: \"unless imposition of a fine under this\nsubsection would unduly complicate or prolong the\nsentencing process.\"\nI point to that next phrase to show you that\nCongress understands, in an antitrust case, in a RICO\ncase, in a corruption case of different kinds, in an\nenvironmental case, it is so complicated figuring out\nthat kinds of things that they excuse even the judge\nwho's experienced in this from dealing with that. And\nunder your theory, as you just point out, if Apprendi\napplies here, we're suddenly telling juries to -- they\nhave to under the Constitution administer that section\n18 U.S.C. 3571, which I just read to you.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. Well, Justice Breyer,\nI mean, my first line of defense would be the comment by\nthis Court consistently that the jury trial right\ndoesn't necessarily make for the most efficient criminal\nproceeding.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I understand you could\nsay that's what the Constitution provides, and if you\njury can't handle it, well, too bad. Okay. But I think\nwe're still in the business of trying to decide whether\nthe Constitution does provide that in the case of fines.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, but I -- I would hope\nthat the Court wouldn't -- wouldn't let the tail wag the\ndog in that particular context.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that a tail? Is that a\ntail that the jury proceeding is itself so\nunadministrable that even Congress says we recognize\neven a judge couldn't do it? All right?\nMR. PHILLIPS: My --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, is that --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, recognizing --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that an irrelevant\nconsideration when you are trying to figure out whether\nan ambiguous history requires the jury trial?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, the ambiguous -- the\npart of the history that is unambiguous is the\nimportance of the jury as a bulwark against the Federal\nGovernment and against the judge.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, in 1790, in fact in\nthe first Judiciary Act and in the Crimes Act of 1790,\nCongress enacted statutes, criminal statutes, that\nauthorized a fine and left it entirely to the discretion\nof the court. Were those unconstitutional?\nMR. PHILLIPS: If it -- up to the maximum.\nJUSTICE ALITO: There was no maximum.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, then there -- then it's\nan indeterminate sentence, and, of course, they're not\nunconstitutional. The core of Apprendi --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Congress permitted --\nJUSTICE ALITO: And what's -- what --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- in 1790 indeterminate\nsentences as well, with no statutory maximum for jail.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. I think that's what\nJustice Scalia -- or Alito was saying.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, they did both --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- with respect to\nfines and --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. They had both, but\nthe one thing they didn't have is a situation where,\nwhatever the statutory maximum was, the judge was\npermitted to go beyond the maximum based on findings\nthat the judge offered up on his part without the\nbenefit of a --\nJUSTICE ALITO: So, if the judge can -- if\nit's totally up to the discretion of the judge, that's\nfine; but if Congress enacts a statute that structures\nthe fine -- and says, if this is the case, then so much;\nif that's the case, then so much more -- then you have\nto have a jury trial?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Absolutely. If --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What sense does that make?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Because you can take --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that precisely what\nApprendi said? Is --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, that was the easy\nanswer.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PHILLIPS: But, more fundamentally, and\nit's -- and it's demonstrated in a case just like this\none --\nJUSTICE ALITO: That may be what Apprendi\nsaid, but is it consistent with the original meaning of\nthe jury trial right in the Sixth Amendment? These\nstatutes give me pause on that score.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, because -- but these\nstatutes don't speak to what Apprendi was talking about,\nwhich is a situation where you set a maximum above which\nthe judge is permitted to go. None of the statutes that\nare out there exist that demonstrate that. All -- and\nall the language and all of the discussion in Justice\nThomas's concurrence talks about up to the -- you know,\nyou have broad discretion up to the maximum. Once you\ngo beyond the maximum, at that point the jury trial\nright has to kick in.\nAnd let me say it in this context. Here's a\nsituation where the government proves up its case in the\ncontext of a $50,000 fine; and that's what the jury is\nasked to decide, and it decides that; and then the judge\ngets to say: Okay, $38 million is now the right number.\nIf that's not the tail wagging the dog within the\nmeaning of even the cases that preceded Apprendi, it\nseems to me there's a fundamental flaw in that\nparticular scheme.\nThe history between fines and incarceration\nare essentially the same. What the Court said in\nApprendi should be followed exactly under these\ncircumstances. Ice should be distinguished on the\nrecognition that multiple offenses are fundamentally\ndifferent from a single offense. And on that basis the\njudgment of the court of appeals should be reversed.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What do you make of this\nold case that the Government cites, U.S. v. Tyler? And\nit was the question of -- the penalty was four times the\nvalue of the goods, and this Court said the judge, not\nthe jury, is responsible for imposing the fine and,\ntherefore, also for determining the value of the goods.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes. Tyler is in -- in many\nways kind of imponderable. The one thing that's clear,\nit's not a Sixth Amendment decision. It wasn't actually\nargued. All it says is that under this law -- and the\nproblem, obviously, in this case was they found -- you\nknow, it was -- the pounds weren't -- weren't the\nproblem. The problem was obviously they had identified\none substance in the indictment, and the jury found\nanother substance in its verdict; and so, there was the\ndisconnect there, and the Court basically said we're not\ngoing to worry about that trifling under these\ncircumstances.\nWhat it doesn't say remotely is that the\nSixth -- is that -- you know, that the Sixth Amendment\nwould permit the judge to make that finding under those\ncircumstances.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If you were to prevail, I\n-- I think it would be a rather simple matter for the\nparties to frame an instruction: We find the defendant\nguilty and that the pollutant was retained for X days,\nmuch of what they do in a drug case. That's one way to\ndo it. Could the government do it by the indictment?\nCould it indict alternatively, indict on count 1 for 10\ndays, count 2 for 50 days, or something like that?\nMR. PHILLIPS: They could do it that way\nor --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Maybe -- is that the way\nit often works or --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I would have thought\nactually the indictment in this case was probably\nadequate for these purposes because it said: During the\nentirety of the period from September 2002 to\nOctober 2004.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's why I am\nsurprised the government waived it, and I thought that's\nwhat the evidence showed anyway. But that's not before\nus. That's not the way the case is presented here.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, Your Honor. That's\ncorrect, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How, in general -- I mean,\nin the individual case, very often a trial doesn't come\nup because 90 percent or more of the time it's just a\nquestion of a plea bargain; and, therefore, the\ndefendant doesn't -- this is an added weapon for him,\nApprendi. But in your -- with your clients and the others,\nthere might be quite a lot of trials.\nSo, how in a trial does your client or\nothers in that position defend on the ground of we\ndidn't do this at all; but by the way, in case you\ndecide to the contrary, jury, we want to tell you we\nonly did it Monday, Wednesday, and Friday?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: How is that supposed to\nwork? Do you have two juries?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No. Well, I mean, look, if\nwe think we're going to be prejudiced as a consequence\nof trying this in a particular way, it will be our call\nwhether or not to waive the jury trial right under those\ncircumstances. But, more fundamentally, at least in\nthis particular case, obviously our position was we\ndidn't form the intent at any point in time and -- but,\nyou know, if ultimately the -- the jury had found that\nthere was some other point in time, then, you know,\nwe'll deal with that issue as we deal with it.\nBut it wouldn't have been -- I don't think\nthe trial in this case would have been significantly\ndifferent. The only thing that would have been\ndifferent is that the jury would have been properly\ninstructed and our jury trial right would have been\npreserved. As it is here, our jury trial right has been\nsavagely undermined.\nIf there are no further questions, I reserve\nthe balance of my time, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Phillips.\nMr. Dreeben.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case, like Oregon v. Ice, involves the\nkind of finding that the common law never entrusted to\nthe jury. There is, therefore, no erosion or\nencroachment on the jury function by assigning the\nfunction of determining the days of violation to the\ncourt for the purpose of determining the criminal fine.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You agree, don't\nyou, that the statement in Oregon v. Ice was pure dicta?\nMR. DREEBEN: The Court's statement in Ice\n-- that if a purely algebraic application of Apprendi\nwere followed, it would sweep in things such as fines\nand restitution -- was not necessary to the judgment,\nMr. Chief Justice, but it was part of the Court's\nrationale in adopting a different take on the meaning of\nthe Apprendi line of cases than had previously been\nespoused. Up until --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dreeben, I think the\nreference -- it was a fleeting reference to fines, and\nit could have meant that the judge has discretion to set\nthe fine up to the maximum in the statute. That's one\npossible meaning.\nMR. DREEBEN: That is true, Justice\nGinsburg. But I think that the author of the opinion in\nIce was citing to an amicus brief filed by States, which\nsupplied illustrations of fine statutes that it believed\nwould be imperiled by a purely programmatic rule-based\napplication of Apprendi.\nAnd two of the State statutes that were\ncited in that amicus brief, that of New Jersey and\nAlaska, involved the kind of gain or loss statute that\nhas been discussed this morning, in which the judge,\nfollowing the rendition of a guilty verdict, determined\nthe amount of gain or loss and then applied either a\ndouble or triple amount as the maximum fine.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This was -- you're not\narguing that this rule will apply only to fines against\ncorporations? It would also apply to individuals,\nright?\nMR. DREEBEN: Correct, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's up to the judge to\ndecide how many days or what the value was and so forth.\nRight?\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, the right to trial by\njury to have that very important fact found does not\nexist, even for individuals?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, the tradition\nwith respect to monetary fines is different than the\ntradition that the Court analyzed in Apprendi. With\nrespect to fines, restitution, and forfeiture, the jury\nwas never given a substantive role at common law. And\nthe law today is with respect to forfeiture --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure how you can\nfully make that argument, because I thought the history\nwas set forth fairly clearly in Apprendi that the early\nhistory was that nothing was given to the jury with\nrespect to imprisonment or fines because most if not all\nsentences were indeterminate. It's only when States\nbegan, and the Federal government, to experiment with\ndeterminate sentences that the Apprendi issue then\nbecame live.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Sotomayor, I think\nwhat Apprendi relied on primarily was the linkage\nbetween charge and penalty in English law, which was,\nfor felonies, death. The Court distinguished in a\nfootnote the tradition with respect to misdemeanors,\nwhich it acknowledged was judicial discretion with\nrespect to fines and whippings, and it did not rely on\nthat history in fashioning the Apprendi rule.\nWhat it relied on were two things: First,\nthe traditional linkage between charge and authorized\npenalty in English common law; and, second, the\ntradition in America that when the legislature had put a\ncap on the amount of the penalty, the judge had\ndiscretion within it not to go above it.\nBut neither of those aspects of Apprendi\naddressed the issue that's before the Court today, which\nis whether it would be an expansion beyond the domain\nthat was covered in Apprendi to apply it to monetary\npenalties in --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, explain to me, other\nthan your reliance on Ice, some sort of tradition,\nwhich, you know, we can debate whether you can draw any\nconclusion from tradition in any of these areas, whether\nit's imprisonment or fines.\nTell me on the logic of Apprendi, not using\nIce, why fines are different, without relying on\nhistory, which to me is -- I view it as ambiguous.\nOkay?\nMR. DREEBEN: It's difficult to do that,\nJustice Sotomayor, because the Court fashioned the\nApprendi rule from history, and it limited it based on\nhistory in Ice. It doesn't operate as an algorithm that\nsimply applies automatic --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought it was a fairly\nsimple algorithm. It says if the statutory penalty --\nif a judge's factfinding can increase the statutory\npenalty, then that's a violation of the Sixth Amendment.\nA jury has to find any fact that increases the statutory\nmaximum.\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, and that -- that was the\nargument of the Ice dissenters, that Apprendi states a\nrule that knows no exceptions for history or the impact\non the States. And Ice does represent I think a --\nshows where the high-water mark of Apprendi was. The\nhigh-water mark was with respect to the penalty of\nimprisonment.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, outside of a -- a --\nimprisonment, there is no other penalty that Congress\ncould fashion because it has no history that wouldn't be\nwithin the purview of the judge?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, of course, the death\npenalty in Ring v. Arizona. The Court held that facts\nthat expose a defendant to the death penalty must be\nfound by the jury. So, the Court has extended Apprendi\nto those core liberty areas. But even with respect to\nthe implications for the length of imprisonment, the\nquantum of punishment that a defendant faces when he's\nconvicted of multiple offenses, this Court in Ice looked\nto history and the impact on the administration of\njustice before being willing to extend Apprendi outside\nof its core domain. And I think it's highly relevant --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Dreeben, wasn't the\ncore domain defined by whether it related to a specific\nstatutory offense? So, Ice says the core concern is \"a\nlegislative attempt to remove from the province of the\njury the determination of facts that warrant a\npunishment for a specific statutory offense.\" How is\nthat not relevant precisely in this context?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, it is, of course,\nrelevant, Justice Kagan, but --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: How does it not determine\nthis context? I mean, those --\nMR. DREEBEN: Because the Court went on\nseveral paragraphs later in its opinion to describe what\nit would mean to adopt a formulaic application of\nApprendi, treating it just as a rule divorced from\nhistory. And one of the consequences that the Court\nconsidered was the impact it would have on sentencing\naccoutrements, two of which are directly related to this\ncase because they are financial penalties, fines and\nrestitution.\nNow, I've talked about how the amicus brief\nthat prompted that paragraph, the concern about the\nimplications of expanding Apprendi, referred to fine\nstatutes that operate on a gain or loss basis, which\nnecessarily requires judicial factfinding after the\nguilty verdict comes in.\nBut if the Court isn't satisfied with those,\nrestitution which is explicitly mentioned in Apprendi --\nexcuse me -- in Ice, classically operates based on\nfindings about victim loss that occur after the guilty\nverdict has come in. This Court is well familiar that\noftentimes courts have to postpone sentencing in order\nto allow the victim to gather evidence and to present\nit.\nNow, the Court could, I suppose, do as the\nlower courts have done and say restitution is different\nbecause it's designed simply to compensate for loss;\nand, therefore, it's in one sense remedial. But that\nwill have to deal with the fact that in cases like\nPasquantino v. United States and Pennsylvania v.\nDavenport, the Court has described restitution as a\ncriminal penalty.\nNow, the other way in which lower courts\nhave said that restitution isn't swept up by Apprendi is\nto say it's a rule that has no maximum. Whatever the\namount of harm to the victim is, that can be compensated\nthrough restitution.\nBut, again, if one is applying an algebraic\nunderstanding of the relevant statutory maximum from the\nBlakely decision, restitution would be hard to justify\nbecause the jury verdict does not contain findings about\nharm to victims. The jury verdict finds guilt.\nAfterwards, the judge finds an additional fact, namely\nthe amount of harm, and imposes restitution. And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's kind of odd,\nthough, isn't it? I mean, to some extent, this is a\nlittle easier case for you, because it does involve a\ncorporation. But there are statutes where the amount of\nimprisonment and the amount of a fine can both increase\nbased on a particular fact.\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And under your\nsubmission, if you have -- you know, say a defendant who\nis subject to 1 year, and that if a particular fact is\nfound, he's subject to 2 years, a fine of 20 but then\n40, the judge would be constitutionally prohibited from\nincreasing the prison sentence but would be perfectly\nfree to increase the fine --\nMR. DREEBEN: Probably --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- including in a\nsituation where the fine might be a lot more serious\nthan the -- the time in prison.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, probably,\nMr. Chief Justice, such a statute would be construed to\nmake that fact one for the jury, since it dictates\nimprisonment increases as well as fine increases. And\nso, the constitutional question is unlikely to arise.\nCongress would have been deemed to have intended that\nthat kind of a fact go to the jury.\nThat's not what -- the case in this statute.\nThis statute provides a 5-year maximum penalty, and then\nit provides a fine amount that's graduated to the days\nof the violation. The violation in this case was one\nsingle violation. The judge did not find that there\nwere multiple violations; the judge simply looked at the\nrecord, and his task is to decide how long did that\nviolation --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure, he operated --\nhe operated in a reasonable way. But we give juries the\ndiscretion to be unreasonable. It would not -- juries\noften compromise. So, if the instructions and the\nverdict told the jury you can find the defendant, you\nknow, guilty for 1 day or whatever it is -- the 30\nmillion; 50,000 or 30 million -- it would not be at all\nunusual for the jury to debate and say, well, let's find\nhim guilty for 10 million.\nMR. DREEBEN: We do presume --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And return that\nverdict. The judge is constrained by reason in a way\nthat the jury is not, and that's sort of -- that's part\nof the protection the Sixth Amendment provided.\nMR. DREEBEN: This Court has never\nrecognized jury nullification as a constitutionally\nprotected right. We presume a rational jury. We\npresume that if the jury is confronted with the evidence\nand the law as given to it by the court, it will apply\nthat law in a rational manner. And the question here is\nwhether that is something that the jury is\nconstitutionally entitled to do.\nNow, coming back to the historical\nfoundations of the Apprendi rule and the extension\nthat's requested here, with all due respect to\nPetitioner, I think United States v. Tyler is much more\nsignificant than Petitioner gives it credit for.\nThis is a case decided in 1812 on a Court\nthat had on it Chief Justice Marshall and Justice Story.\nThese were people who were well steeped in common law\ntraditions and well familiar with how judges would find\nfacts at the time of the founding. And in Tyler, there\nwas a charge that the defendant had unlawfully exported,\nin violation of an embargo law, an amount of pearl ashes\nthat were worth $600. And the jury came back with a\nverdict that said we find that the defendant unlawfully\nexported pot ashes worth $280. And the question is:\nCould a verdict be imposed on this, and could the judge\nset the fine?\nThe two judges on the circuit court\ndisagreed, and so it was certified to the Supreme Court.\nAnd this Court held unanimously that finding a valuation\nwas a judge function, not a jury function. No valuation\nwas necessary in order for the court to impose the\nproper fine.\nAnd it's difficult to understand how this\nCourt could have said that, if there were such a\nwell-settled constitutionally protected entitlement to a\njury verdict on facts that dictated a fine, if indeed\nthis statute assigned the role to the judge and the\nCourt was fully comfortable with that role being carried\nout.\nAnd Tyler is a decision of this Court.\nThere is no decision of this Court with respect to\nimprisonment that is anything like Tyler. The\ntraditions with respect to imprisonment would surely be\nunderstood in a different manner than with respect to\nfines. And when one looks at fines, restitution, and\nforfeiture as a package of possible financial penalties\nand asks the question, did the Framers envision that\nthese matters would be within the jury's domain as\nopposed to the judge's in imposing the appropriate\nsentence after a jury verdict, I think that the answer\nis they would not have viewed it as a matter protected\nby the Sixth Amendment, because there was no factual\npredicate in the common Law that would have led them to\nbelieve the jury's function would be eroded if those\nmatters were not.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A very -- very\nsimple matter for the government to ask for jury\nfindings on the questions at issue in this case, right?\nMR. DREEBEN: We could have done it here,\nMr. Chief Justice. The broader concern is cases that\ninvolve gain or loss, in which the question of how much\nloss may have been suffered by hundreds or even\nthousands of victims of fraud is typically not\nundertaken -- the process of quantifying them isn't done\nuntil the guilty verdict is in because it's an\nenormously difficult and complicated task. As\nJustice Breyer pointed out, the judge isn't even\nrequired to do it at sentencing if it proves to be too\ncomplicated.\nAnd for jury trials to do it, there may well\nbe a need for bifurcation. And this Court in\nOregon v. Ice declined to impose on the States the need\nto bifurcate trials to determine whether a sentence\nshould be run consecutively or concurrently, because\nthat would intrude upon a valuable reform that was\ndesigned to provide some restraints on judicial\ndiscretion.\nThe same kind of thing would operate here if\nthis Court adopts an across-the-board rule that fines\nhave to be proved to a jury. If it extended it to\nrestitution and to forfeiture, that would involve\noverruling the Court's decision in Libretti v. United\nStates, which held that forfeiture is a sentencing\nfunction. But upon a strict application of Apprendi, a\nmathematically, geometrically accurate application of\nthe rule stated in Apprendi, it's difficult to see why\nforfeiture is not something that has to be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Dreeben, let's talk\nabout Tyler. Tyler was not argued before this Court.\nMR. DREEBEN: Correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's a one-page opinion.\nIt's later described quite accurately as focusing not\nupon the amount of the fine, but rather upon a\nmisdescription of pot ashes as pearl ashes, right?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I don't agree with --\nthat it's later been characterized that way. It was\ncharacterized in a decision that was written by Justice\nStory --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's right.\nMR. DREEBEN: -- in the same year. Justice\nStory was on Tyler. He wrote -- he sat on circuit in a\ncase called United States v. Mann.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Quite so.\nMR. DREEBEN: And this is in our brief. And\nhe -- he interpreted Tyler and said the court would not\nhave given the direction that it did, that a judgment\ncould be entered based on the fine amount, unless they\nwere satisfied that an indictment lay and that the fine\nwas to be imposed by the court and not found by the jury\nas a penalty.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The jury did find it in\nTyler, though, didn't it? The question was submitted to\nthe jury, wasn't it?\nMR. DREEBEN: The jury --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why doesn't -- why doesn't\nthat indicate what the historical practice was?\nMR. DREEBEN: Because the Court stated that\nthe part of the verdict which is subject -- which we're\ndiscussing right now is to be regarded as surplusage.\nIn other words, this -- Tyler explains that although it\nwas submitted to the jury, it wasn't necessary to be\nsubmitted to the jury. The charge had asked for $600 of\nvalue which would then be subject to the fine. The jury\nfound only $280.\nAnd as I interpret the Court's decision and\nI think as Justice Story interpreted it sitting on\ncircuit in Mann, it said this isn't a jury function.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did it -- as a matter of\nstatutory construction, right?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, the -- again, I would\nreadily concede, Justice Scalia, that the Sixth\nAmendment does not appear --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. DREEBEN: -- in the Court's decision in\nTyler, but it's difficult for me to understand that a\nCourt that included Chief Justice Marshall, Justice\nStory, and other members who were well familiar with how\ncommon law operated would have adopted an interpretation\nof a statute that was facially unconstitutional.\nI -- I don't submit that this decision\ngrapples with what we now know to be the Apprendi\ndoctrine. I simply submit it as evidence that this\nCourt --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you don't think they\nbelieved in the Apprendi doctrine, either, right?\nMR. DREEBEN: No. I -- they didn't have the\nbenefit of having read Apprendi in order to render their\ndecision. They -- they were deciding the question that\nwas certified up to them.\nMy submission is that they wouldn't have\ndecided the case that way if they thought, based on\ntheir familiarity with the common law, that fines were\nthe kind of thing that had to go to a jury.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Might have helped if they\nhad argument, right?\nMR. DREEBEN: I think they felt they did not\nneed it, because the matter was sufficiently obvious\nthat all members of the Court could agree on it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about all of the\n19th-century cases cited by Justice Thomas's concurrence\nin Apprendi? Fine cases.\nMR. DREEBEN: There are three of them.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In which course -- in which\ncourts did indeed require the amount of the fines to be\nfound by the jury.\nMR. DREEBEN: There are three of them. The\nearliest one is Commonwealth v. Smith. It's a\nMassachusetts case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Massachusetts, right.\nMR. DREEBEN: And the Court in that case --\nits analysis I think is even briefer than the analysis\nwe've just discussed in Tyler.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was it an argued case, at\nleast?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, I'd have to go\nback and look at the opinion to tell you whether it was\nan argued case. There's no citation of any\nconstitutional law in -- in that decision.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What makes acceptable\ncommon law? Let's assume there weren't 50 States back\nthen, but whatever the number was, 20 States, and 15 of\nthem submitted it to the jury and 5 didn't. Does that\nmean there was no common law that this was generally\nsubmitted to the jury? If you can point to one case,\nthat's enough to defeat the existence of a common law\nview?\nMR. DREEBEN: I doubt that I would say that,\nJustice Sotomayor. The -- the jurisprudence of the\nformer colonies/new States is not uniform. I -- the --\nthere is something I think of mythology in speaking\nabout the common law as one indivisible body of law.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That -- you see, that's\nmy problem.\nMR. DREEBEN: And I don't disagree with you\non that point, Justice Sotomayor; but I think that there\nis one fact that truly stands out about fines, and that\nis they were historically at common law products of\njudicial discretion.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But so was imprisonment.\nMR. DREEBEN: Imprisonment was rare.\nImprisonment was hardly ever imposed in the early\ncolonies and in England, because --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, how many statutes\nhad anything but indeterminate fine structures?\nMR. DREEBEN: I -- I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How many statutes in the\nearly common law had anything but indeterminate fine\nstatutes?\nMR. DREEBEN: A few did. And I've attempted\nto read up on the law of North Carolina, the law of\nPennsylvania, the law of Massachusetts, the law of New\nYork. It's all varied and complicated, but there were a\nfew of them there.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If it's varied and\ncomplicated, why should we -- assuming that it's\nambiguous, why should we adopt the strange rule that the\njury has to find the fact if you go to jail for 2 weeks,\nbut doesn't have to find the fact if the amount of fines\nmultiplied by number of days or by anything else will --\nwill make a pauper of you? Why would we adopt such a\nstrange rule?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, the fact that there\nwere --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Unless compelled to do --\nto do so by a clear common law history?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, none of those statutes\nassigned the role of finding fines to juries. There may\nbe an example or two that one could find if you dig\nthrough the mass of colonial records, but the dominant\ntrend, and it was acknowledged by Blackstone, was that\nthe common law never assigned the responsibility of\nfines to the jury, and statutes did so rarely.\nImprisonment simply doesn't help very much in this area,\nbecause the resources required to imprison just didn't\nexist, and imprisonment really is a product that\ndeveloped in the late --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about the other two?\nI just -- I was very interested in your colloquy here.\nYou said, well, there were three cases in the 19th\ncentury where they did say the jury --\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And one of them was a very\nbrief opinion from Massachusetts.\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, Massachusetts counts\nin its favor, but perhaps the brief opinion doesn't.\nThe --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about the other two?\nMR. DREEBEN: Another one of them is\nMassachusetts.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Both Massachusetts. Well,\nit's getting stronger.\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes. We have Hope -- Hope in\n1845, which cites back to Smith and relied on it, and\nthen there is an -- an arson case called Ritchey from\nIndiana in which the court did seem to think that in\norder to sustain a proper prosecution where the fine\namount varied based on the destruction of the property,\nthe jury had to find the amount of the property\nvaluation.\nBut this is 1845. It's not something that\nwould have been present to the mind of the Framers. It\ndoesn't indicate clearly what the source of law is,\nwhether it's a common law tradition, whether it's\nfollowing something like Smith. Smith itself I think is\nalso best understood as a larceny case, and there was\nmore of an established tradition that in larceny cases,\nthe value of the property taken was relevant to the\njury's findings because it made the difference between a\ncapital offense -- a capital offense that could be given\nwith benefit of clergy, which was basically a way for\nthe English judges to mitigate a death-eligible crime to\na non-death penalty, or petty larceny, which was\npunished by fines and whipping. So, it graded the\noffense in a way that, for example, the fine penalty at\nissue in this case does not.\nPetitioner is guilty of a felony by virtue\nof the jury verdict. That imposes the stigma of being a\nfelon on Petitioner. The judge's role is then to decide\nwhat was charged in the indictment and what was the\nlength of that violation, not to find Petitioner guilty\nof numerous additional violations.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if the judge disagreed\nwith the jury about whether there was even a violation?\nMR. DREEBEN: The jury's acquittal would end\nthe criminal case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, no, no. The jury\nfinds a violation, but the judge thinks the jury got it\nwrong.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, in that case --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How does -- how does he\npick the -- the number of days? He flips a coin?\nMR. DREEBEN: Unless the -- the judge finds\nthat the evidence is insufficient under Jackson v.\nVirginia, he's bound by the jury.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, he finds, you know,\nthey could have come out that way, but -- but they were\nwrong.\nMR. DREEBEN: Then I think that he would be\nbound by the day of violation, $50,000 limit, subject to\nanother provision of Federal law, 3573(c), which\nprovides in the case of an organization that a felony\nexposes the defendant to a $500,000 fine. So, there --\nthere would be other limits applicable in Federal law\nthat would explain what the judge is supposed to do in\nthat situation.\nThe judge, of course, is operating in a\ndifferent way than the jury. The jury is finding guilt\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. The judge is applying a\npreponderance of the evidence standard. This Court in\nUnited States v. Watts has recognized that judges can\nfind facts that the jury may have rejected under the\nhigher standard.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's the whole problem.\nThat is indeed the whole problem.\nMR. DREEBEN: It's only the whole problem,\nJustice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The judge doesn't have to\nfind that this defendant beyond a reasonable doubt\ncommitted the violation on so many days. The jury\nwould.\nMR. DREEBEN: The only --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The judge can simply say,\nwell, you know, all in all, probably they did it --\nprobably. More likely than not they did it so many\ndays. It's a big difference.\nMR. DREEBEN: It's only a problem,\nJustice Scalia, if the Sixth Amendment protects a\ndefendant's right to it. And the question that was --\nas framed in Ice, is whether the legislative innovation,\nthe reform aimed to structure the discretion of a court\nwhich at the Founding era might have been impose\nwhatever fine you like with no limits whatsoever, except\nthe Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment --\nCongress has come along, as have the State legislatures,\nand sought to structure the deliberations with respect\nto financial penalties.\nFines, restitution, and forfeiture are now\nstructured in a way that basically sends the decision to\nthe judge or lowers the standard of proof to a\npreponderance in the case of forfeiture amounts that --\nthat are decided by a Federal jury without the\nconstraints of the Apprendi rule.\nAnd that distinction between financial\npenalties and infringements on life or liberty is\nconsistent with a Sixth Amendment theme. Deprivations\nof life or liberty attract a greater degree of\nprotection than fine amounts or other financial\npenalties. There is substantive constitutional\nprotection in the Eighth Amendment --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: What other rules do you\nthink are different? I mean, is there a jury trial in\nthe one case but not in the other? Is there a right to\ncounsel in the one case but not in the other? What else\nturns on this fine/incarceration distinction?\nMR. DREEBEN: In the right to counsel area,\nthe Court has held that for misdemeanors, if the\ndefendant goes to prison, he's entitled to counsel; if\nthe defendant does not, he is not entitled to counsel.\nWith respect to jury trials, a petty offense which is\ngenerally one punishable by less than 6 months in\nprison, there is no jury trial right. A penalty of\ngreater than 6 months in prison indicates a more serious\noffense.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if you call it a\nmisdemeanor but -- but impose a very heavy fine? It's\nstill a misdemeanor?\nMR. DREEBEN: It is still a misdemeanor\nbecause the primary indication --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you don't have right to\ncounsel. Right?\nMR. DREEBEN: That is -- that is this\nCourt's jurisprudence. This Court in Scott and\nArgersinger drew the line at actual imprisonment,\nrecognizing that deprivations of liberty have a more\nserious criminal implication than financial penalties.\nAnd --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that makes it clear to\nyou that there's no overlap between property and\nliberty, so that no matter how much of your property are\ntaken and what circumstances, it's just property;\nthere's no liberty involved?\nMR. DREEBEN: There is, of course, an\nimportant constitutional value in deprivations of\nproperty. It's protected by due process, and the\nExcessive Fines Clause explicitly addresses the\npossibility that the judge may impose an unjustified\npenalty. There are also nonconstitutional sources of\nprotection such as reasonableness review, which\nPetitioner got in this case, and the First Circuit\nupheld the amount of the fine as reasonable.\nThe only question here is whether, despite\nthe lack of a historical pedigree and despite this\nCourt's decision in Tyler and despite the adverse effect\non the administration of justice, the Apprendi rule\nneeds to be expanded where it has never been applied\npreviously to encompass fines. And I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you want -- want us to\nwrite as part of that decision that no matter how great\nthe fine, liberty is not involved?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, liberty in the sense of\nimprisonment is not involved. Corporations I don't\nthink can be deprived of --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Liberty in the sense of\nwhat the Fifth Amendment and the Fourteenth amendment\nsay.\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't think a corporation\ncan be deprived of liberty within the meaning of the\nFifth Amendment. It can't be put in prison; it can't be\nrestricted from, you know, activities that are\ncomprehended --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, your --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. I guess you don't\nneed counsel on any suits against corporations, right?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I don't think\ncorporations can appear in court except through counsel.\nThey don't have a sort of distinct --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your argument isn't\nlimited to corporations, though.\nMR. DREEBEN: No, this -- this is a rule\nthat is responsive to the history with respect to\nfinancial punishments.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, do you need any more\nthan that? I mean, do we have to get into this? Isn't\nit just a question of whether there is a tradition in\nthe law that juries, rather than judges, would determine\nwhat used to be called sentencing facts; facts related\nnot to the crime, but to the imposition of the\npunishment where that's a fine?\nMR. DREEBEN: May I answer?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, we're not\nasking the Court to reconsider its Apprendi line of\ncases. We're asking it to apply the analysis that\nlimited Apprendi in Oregon v. Ice.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Phillips, you have 7 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nHopefully, I'll be able to give you back a\ncouple of those minutes.\nI'd like to -- I'd like to start with what\nseems to me ultimately the fundamental notion of the\nUnited States' position, which is that there is a vast\ngulf somehow between fines and imprisonment. And it\nseems to me very difficult within the constitutional\nstructure to embrace that approach when, obviously,\nproperty interests are protected in the Fifth Amendment;\nthey're protected in the Eighth Amendment. And if you\ngo back to Blackstone, where he talks about inflicting\ncorporal punishment or a stated imprisonment of a term,\nwhich is better than an excessive fine, for that amounts\nto imprisonment for life, there's the recognition\nhistorically that fines have an enormous impact on\nindividuals and, of course, are entitled to fundamental\nconstitutional protections. It seems to me that the\nGovernment's approach there to saying fines are off the\ntable and it's completely open season on defendants\nunder those circumstances is unjustifiable.\nWith respect to restitution, I already\nsuggested to the Court all lower courts have concluded\nthat restitution is not within the Apprendi doctrine. I\ndon't think that's going to be a problem under these\ncircumstances.\nAnd -- and I don't think ultimately that the\nissue in this case is sort of what is or is not the\ncommon law tradition. Because I -- if I go back and I\nthink -- I read Justice Thomas's concurrence and the\nhistory there, he doesn't even mention Tyler as part\nof -- as part of that analysis and, yet, concludes with\nwhat I think is a very powerful assessment, that juries\nwould be available for fines up to, you know, within --\nif it were going to go beyond some kind of a maximum.\nBut within the maximum, obviously in that context, the\njudge would have complete discretion on -- on how to\napproach it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the amount of\nloss issue that Justice Breyer raised, was very\ncomplicated to determine what the amount of the loss is?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJustice Ginsburg, I think it's worth\nconsidering two facts in this case in dealing with what\nI think is purely a policy argument that shouldn't\noverride the Constitution. But the first one is that --\nthe notion that Apprendi applies to fines has been well\naccepted in 99 percent of the country for more than a\ndecade. And the Antitrust Division operates and makes\nthese kinds of decisions all the time. Fraud\nprosecutions are going forward.\nThe amicus brief that was filed by the\nChamber of Commerce demonstrates categorically they --\nthis -- this gets done every day, and it gets done\neffectively. So, whatever the problem of Apprendi, it\nhas not surfaced. And -- and you'll look in the\nGovernment's brief for any specific evidence of the\ncomplaint that it makes other than the hypothetical\npossibility that their parade of horribles would play\nout.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If we --\nMR. PHILLIPS: This Court has rejected that\nparade of horribles in every other Apprendi context.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If -- on the question of\nthe value of goods or the amount of the loss, what would\nthe standard be? Would the jury have to find beyond a\nreasonable doubt that it was -- that the value was such\nand such?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, I think that's precisely\nwhat the jury would be asked to find. And juries are\nasked to find that all the time, and they make that kind\nof a determination.\nAnd I guess the last point that I think as a\npractical matter that ought -- the Court ought to take\nnotice of is that no State filed an amicus brief in this\ncase, that Apprendi has not been the problem in the\nfines context that would even warrant anybody to come in\nhere and complain about it.\nIt seems to me the right answer is to apply\nthe core doctrine, the core principle of Apprendi, which\neven the Government concedes, if you just take the\nlanguage, it talks about any fact that increases the\npenalty, that algorithm takes you to the conclusion the\njudgment below should be reversed.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I may have just\nforgotten, but does your brief go through the status of\nwhat lower courts have decided with respect to fines and\nhow they're dealing with them? I just don't remember it\nas being part of your brief, the statement you just\nmade to Justice Kennedy.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, we do -- I mean, we do\nmake the -- we demonstrated two things: one, that the\nlower courts pretty consistently have rejected the First\nCircuit's approach --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Okay.\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- and then, two, that the --\nin the amicus brief then focused more in terms of fines\nbeing used on a regular basis in that period of time in\nthose jurisdictions.\nIf there are no further questions, I'll cede\nback my rest of my time. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel,\ncounsel.\n"
