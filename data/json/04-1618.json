        "content": "(11:07 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in 04-1618, Northern Insurance Company of New\nYork v. Chatham County, Georgia.\nMr. Estrada.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL A. ESTRADA\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ESTRADA: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nIn this admiralty case, the Eleventh Circuit\nheld that Chatham County, a political subdivision of\nthe State of Georgia, is entitled to sovereign immunity\nin Federal court. That is wrong for at least two\nreasons. First, for well over a century, this Court\nconsistently has held that counties and other political\nsubdivisions are not entitled to sovereign immunity.\nAnd second, in the specific context of in personam\nadmiralty cases, the same rule has been recognized for\nover 100 years.\nTo go to my first point, in Lincoln County v.\nLuning, decided in 1890, this Court squarely held that\ncounties and other political subdivisions are not\nentitled to sovereign immunity. There are three, or at\nleast three, significant aspects of Lincoln County that\nbear emphasis.\nThe first one is that even by 1890, the Court\nwas able to say that in its own cases it could see\ndecades of case law where counties had been a defendant\nwithout any objection being raised.\nThe second was that an important aspect of\nthe Court's reasoning was the recognition that when a\ncounty is sued, the State is not a real party in\ninterest, not the real party in interest, which is\nanother way of saying that the county is not an arm of\nthe State, the issue before here today.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can a county be an arm of\nthe State for some things?\nMR. ESTRADA: I am not aware of any county\nthat has been organized so as to meet the requirements\nthat this Court set forth in Hess and other cases for\nan arm of the State. This is, of course, not a\nquestion of labeling. It is possible that the -- that\na -- that a particular State would associate so closely\nwith a county, so closely control its -- its acts, and\nbe on the hook for its liabilities, that under this\nCourt's cases it could be an arm of the State, but that\nis not the case here. In fact --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I assume it's -- I\nassume it's sort of a -- a case-by-case inquiry. In\nother words, the county could be an arm of the State\nfor some purposes but not others.\nMR. ESTRADA: That is -- that is a\npossibility, Mr. Chief Justice. I'm not aware that this\ncounty would meet that inquiry with respect to what we\nhave here.\nWhat we have in this case is essentially two\npropositions. One is that the county, like every other\ncounty in the country, exercises a slice of State\npower, and that was something that was found\nunremarkable by this Court in Lake Country Estates.\nAnd the second one is that this county, like many other\norgans of government, may get funding, even substantial\nfunding, from the State, and again, that was found\nunremarkable in Mt. Healthy by this Court.\nWhat is controlling here is that the county,\nlike most counties or maybe all counties, enjoys a\nsignificant amount of autonomy, has the power under the\nState law to raise its own revenues through taxes and\nbonds, and that the State is ultimately not liable for\nits debts. And under -- under those factors, the\ncounty is unable to meet any definition of arm of the\nState that has ever been articulated by this Court's\ncases.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is -- is the failure to\nextend immunity to counties and municipal entities in a\nState just a historical relic? It depends on\nsemantics. Or is there some normative or good\ngovernment policy that dictates the distinction?\nMR. ESTRADA: Well, I think as a -- as a\nfundamental feature of the Federal system and -- and\nthe plan of the Convention, that the States came\ntogether as sovereigns to form a new country, and under\nthis Court's cases, the immunity that they retain is\ncalled residual because it is recognized that insofar\nas they did not relinquish it to the National\nGovernment, they kept it. There is no historical\nrecord of the founding that contemplates that counties\ncame to the Convention as sovereigns.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's just a -- it's\njust a close textual reading of the Eleventh Amendment.\nRight?\nMR. ESTRADA: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It says a State. It\ndoesn't say county.\nMR. ESTRADA: That might be the end of the\ncase, in fairness, Mr. Chief Justice, if the Eleventh\nAmendment were the source of the sovereign immunity\nthat this Court has recognized, but we know from cases\nlike Alden v. Maine that the Eleventh Amendment is\nmerely an example of the structural immunity that is\nimplicit in the structure of the Constitution.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So it's -- it's a matter of\nrespecting the dignity of the States because they\nparticipated in the Convention, the plan of Convention?\nMR. ESTRADA: And because they came to the\nConvention as sovereigns. Let me say that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well -- I -- I guess, in --\nin going beyond the Eleventh Amendment, we were\nappealing to an understanding of sovereignty that\nexisted at the time of the framing.\nMR. ESTRADA: Exactly right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And at the time of the\nframing, counties in England did not enjoy the -- the\nsovereign immunity of the king, did they?\nMR. ESTRADA: I do not believe that counties\nanywhere at the time of the founding enjoyed the\nsovereign immunity that was -- that has been recognized\nby this Court's cases.\nAnd you're right, Justice Scalia, that this\nhas been reflected in -- in the Federalist Papers, 81,\nby Hamilton. It was clear, at least to some of the\nFounders, that this was a feature that need not be\nstated in the Constitution in order to recognized.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So it's a historical relic\nbased on the dignity of the State, or the king in one\ncase, and of corresponding lack of dignity of the\nentities on the other?\nMR. ESTRADA: Well, it is -- it is what the\nhistory was and what the plan of the Convention was,\nand it's also a recognition, even functionally, that\nwe're talking about sovereign immunity. And I think\nmost common sense understandings of what a sovereign is\nwould imply at least the ability to prescribe law for\nthe government of others without having to draw your\nauthority for that from a higher source and without\nbeing accountable to a higher source. A State within\nthe respective sphere would meet that requirement, but\nthat would not be true of counties.\nI will point out, as my third point with\nrespect to the Lincoln County case, is that the -- the\ncase came down March 3rd, 1890, which was the same day\nthat the Court handed down Hans v. Louisiana. And that\nis significant because, as the Court is aware, the\nholding of Hans has been the subject of significant\ndisagreement over the years since by members of past\nand current courts, and many members of the courts have\nviewed Hans as an unwarranted extension of sovereign\nimmunity.\nIf the Court was not prepared to extend\nimmunity to counties on the day that it ruled on Hans,\nit seems hard to see why it would do it now. And in\nfact, the history of this Court's cases since then\nreflects an almost inflexible understanding, again and\nagain, that counties and political subdivisions are not\nentitled to the State's immunity.\nWith respect to my second point --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you -- would you say\nthoughtful rather than inflexible?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ESTRADA: I will settle for thoughtful,\nbut I'm hoping for inflexible.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ESTRADA: With respect to my second\npoint, Mr. Chief Justice, Workman v. City of New York\nsquarely dealt with the question whether a political\nsubdivision, a -- a municipality made up of four\ncounties in that case, was entitled to immunity in an\nadmiralty suit in personam, and the Court concluded\nthat the answer was no.\nNow, the only argument I have heard for why\nWorkman is not controlling in this case has been that\nsomehow in Ex parte New York No. 1, this Court cast\ndoubt on that holding. But if you look at the portion\nthat is being relied on, all that the Court said in Ex\nparte New York was it cited one of the distinctions\nbetween the New York case and Workman, when it could\nhave cited two. That's not enough to override what the\ncase actually says.\nAnd one of the reasons that I started with\nthe Luning County is that even if there were any doubt\non the question or even if Ex parte New York had cast\nenough doubt under Workman, despite the uniform\nunderstanding since Workman that that's what the rule\nis, the fact that this Court in every other context of\nsovereign immunity has consistently held that counties\nare not entitled to sovereign immunity ought to be\ndispositive of the question there as well.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you -- do you agree that\n-- that it's possible that an entity can have sovereign\nimmunity in admiralty where -- where the same entity\nwould -- would not have it elsewhere?\nMR. ESTRADA: No --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I find that discussion quite\nperplexing.\nMR. ESTRADA: I do not believe that is\npossible, and with respect to the argument to that\neffect that is being advanced by Respondent, a close\nreading of the cases being cited will disclose that\nthey're not, in fact, unique to admiralty. They are\ncommon law cases about what the -- what the power --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They're talking about\nimmunity in most of the cases, not necessarily --\nMR. ESTRADA: Sovereign immunity.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- not necessarily sovereign\nimmunity.\nMR. ESTRADA: That's right.\nAnd -- and another important distinction,\nJustice Scalia, is that even if one could unearth a --\na body of case law that recognized municipal immunity\nat the time of the founding, it would not become\nsovereign immunity, and that's the only issue that is\n-- that is in contention here.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But -- but there is a\ntextual basis for drawing a distinction between\nadmiralty and law and equity. The Eleventh Amendment\ndoesn't extend to -- to admiralty.\nMR. ESTRADA: That is right, Justice Stevens.\nAnd if this Court had held that the Eleventh Amendment\nwere the source or even the sole source of sovereign\nimmunity, that would be a compelling argument. The\nmain holding of the Ex parte New York No. 1 case is,\nindeed, that that limitation does not apply because, as\nunderstood by Hans, which had been ruled on some 31\nyears earlier, the sovereign immunity really comes from\nthe structure of the Constitution.\nAnd the state of this -- this Court's\ndoctrine is that the Eleventh Amendment's sole purpose\nwas to overrule the holding in Chisholm, and that but\nfor the fact that Chisholm came down, the Eleventh\nAmendment never -- if the Eleventh -- if the Eleventh\nAmendment had never been enacted, every sovereign\nimmunity case would come out the same way. That is the\ncurrent understanding by the Court about how the\ndoctrine works.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Alden tells us what the\nunderstanding of the Founders was. Of course, it's the\nunderstanding of some of the Founders. It did not\ninclude those who were in the majority in Chisholm.\nMR. ESTRADA: That is -- that is true, though\nwith respect to Chisholm and the issue in this case,\nJustice -- Justice Stevens, it is very instructive that\nboth sides of the argument in the Chisholm case\nunderstood that the issue was whether States may get\nsovereign immunity. Both sides conceded that political\nsubdivisions didn't.\nChief Justice Jay for the majority argued\nthat it made no sense to extend sovereign immunity when\na -- where -- where a city like the size of\nPhiladelphia was the same size and had as many\ninhabitants as the State of Delaware, and that's what he\nargued.\nAnd Justice Iredell, whose views have come to\ncommand a majority of the Court, saw it to his argument\nto distinguish political subdivisions from States, so\nthat even though this Court's first holding was not\nuntil 1890, it was embedded in the understanding at the\nfounding, as -- as shown even by Chisholm, that\npolitical subdivisions were not entitled to sovereign\nimmunity.\nI would like to reserve the remainder of my\ntime, if I may, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Himmelfarb.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nStates enjoy a constitutionally protected\nimmunity from suit, but cities and counties do not.\nThat principle has been established by an unbroken line\nof precedent dating back to the 19th century and was\napplied to an admiralty suit more than 100 years ago in\nWorkman v. City of New York.\nBoth Workman and the principle it applied\nanswered the question presented in this case. Workman\nheld that, as a matter of the Federal law of admiralty,\na political subdivision is not entitled to immunity\nfrom suit. In the course of deciding that question,\nthe Court explained that if the government entity\ndefendant in an admiralty suit were a sovereign, it\nwould be entitled to immunity, not as a matter of\nadmiralty law, but as a matter of the law of sovereign\nimmunity, in which case the Court would be without\njurisdiction.\nThe Court went on to say, however -- and this\nis at page 570 of the opinion -- the municipal\ncorporation of the City of New York unlike a sovereign\nwas subject to the jurisdiction of the Court.\nWorkman's holdings resolved the issue in the case.\nBut the result would be the same even if\nWorkman had never been decided. From the Lincoln\nCounty case in 1890 through the Richland County case in\n2003, this Court has repeatedly held that States, but\nnot cities or counties, are sovereign and that States,\nbut not cities or counties, are therefore entitled to\nsovereign immunity. A city or county is no more a\nsovereign in an admiralty case than it is in any other\ntype of case.\nThe theory on which the court of appeals\napparently relied was that not only States but what it\ncalled political subdivisions of States are entitled to\nsovereign immunity, at least when the -- the political\nsubdivision is exercising a power delegated by the\nState.\nBut that's no different from saying that\ncities and counties are, after all, entitled to\nsovereign immunity because every city or county is a\npolitical subdivision of a State and every city or\ncounty exercises power delegated by the State, what\nthis Court has called a slice of State power. So the\napparent rationale of the court of appeals is just\nflatly inconsistent with more than a century of this\nCourt's precedent.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't doubt that\na county could have sovereign immunity if it qualified\nas an arm of the State in a particular instance.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That's absolutely correct,\nMr. Chief Justice. Of course, as this case comes to\nthe Court, all agree that Chatham County is not an arm\nof the State for purposes of this Court's\nconstitutional sovereign immunity doctrine. So the\nonly issue in this case is whether there is some other\nground on which the county would be entitled to\nimmunity, and there's none.\nRespondent's theory is that there are two\ndistinct notions of sovereign immunity, what it calls\nEleventh Amendment immunity and what it calls residual\nsovereign immunity. A fundamental flaw in that theory\nis that there is only one doctrine of -- of\nconstitutional sovereign immunity. What Respondent\ncalls residual sovereign immunity and what this Court\nhas sometimes identified as the immunity associated\nwith the residuary sovereignty that comes from\nFederalist 39 is the doctrine of constitutional\nsovereign immunity.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Hans -- Hans is residual\nsovereign immunity.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That's absolutely right,\nJustice Scalia, and every case that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Some -- some of our brethren\ndon't -- don't agree with it. They don't like the\nresidue and would limit it to the Eleventh Amendment.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If you're going to have a\nresidue, Hans is it I suppose.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That's true, Justice Scalia.\nThe -- the theory of residual immunity is\nthat before the Constitution was established, States\nwere sovereign. When they entered the Union, they\nsurrendered some aspects of their sovereignty and\nretained other aspects of it. One aspect that they\nretained was an immunity from suit. A city or county\nis not entitled to sovereign immunity because it wasn't\na sovereign at the time of the founding and thus had no\nimmunity -- no sovereignty either to surrender or to\nretain. From that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your -- your friend\nin the -- in the red brief, though, reviews a lot of\nold cases, suggesting at the time of the founding, that\ncounties were not subject to suit.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, I don't think the\ncases that Respondent cites do, in fact, stand for that\nproposition. In fact, the principal authority on\nwhich Respondent relies, the Men of Devon case, which\nis an English case, so far as I can tell, was neither\nan admiralty case nor a case that accorded immunity to\nthe county. The case, as far as I can tell, was a\nstraightforward negligence case, and the holding of the\ncase was that inhabitants of the county, as distinct\nfrom the corporate entity, the county itself, cannot be\nheld liable in a negligence suit. So I don't think\nthat that case provides any support for Respondent's\ntheory.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Nor could charities. They\nwere immune as well. But it -- it certainly wasn't\nsovereign immunity.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That's absolutely right,\nJustice Scalia. At the time of the founding, various\nentities, including sub-State governmental entities,\nwere entitled to some forms of immunity. This Court\ntraces the history of municipal immunity at some length\nin the Owen v. City of Independence case. But as -- as\nyou just pointed out, Justice Scalia, whatever immunity\nthat was, it was not sovereign immunity, and there's no\nbasis for constitutionalizing it in the context of this\nCourt's constitutional sovereign immunity doctrine any\nmore than there's a basis for constitutionalizing the\nimmunity that a private entity or an even an individual\nmight have enjoyed at the time of the founding.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this?\nSupposing a State passed a statute that said that the\nfollowing counties shall hereby be designated arms of\nthe State and be entitled to immunity, period. Would\nthat provide an adequate defense, do you think?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That in and of itself,\nJustice Stevens, would not. This Court's cases make\nclear that in deciding whether an entity is an arm of\nthe State, there are three principal considerations to\ntake into account. You've identified one of them,\nwhich is the classification of the entity under State\nlaw. The other two, which are probably more important,\nare whether the State would ultimately be liable for a\njudgment against the political entity and also the\nextent of control exercised by the State over the\nentity.\nIt's important to point out, with respect to\nthe latter of those two considerations, that control in\nthis context doesn't mean simply that the county has\nbeen delegated authority by the States since, after\nall, all counties are -- are delegated authority by the\nState. It means that there's more of a day-to-day\ncontrol, for example, that it is the Governor who\nappoints the members of the commission that governs the\nparticular entity, the Governor who has the power to\nremove them. The Governor may have veto power. That's\nthe sort of considerations that courts have taken into\naccount in deciding whether the control element of the\narm of the State inquiry is satisfied.\nThere is no basis for any notion of\nconstitutional sovereign immunity beyond the one\nidentified by this Court. Consequently, there's no\nbasis for any arm of the State test other than that\napplied by the Court in its cases involving the one\ndoctrine of constitutional sovereign immunity.\nThe only other possibility that would entitle\nRespondent to prevail in this case would be some notion\nof non-constitutional immunity unique to admiralty.\nBut, of course, whatever else Workman held -- and\nRespondent takes the position that Workman did not\ndecide the constitutional issue. We think it did, for\nthe reasons I've already stated. But whatever else it\nheld, it clearly held that, as a matter of the Federal\nlaw of admiralty, political subdivisions are not\nentitled to immunity from suit. So the Court could not\nadopt a non-constitutional rule of immunity limited to\nthe admiralty context without overruling Workman.\nRespondent does not ask the Court to do that. And\nindeed, so far as I can tell from reading Respondent's\nbrief, it does not even advocate a non-constitutional\nrule of immunity for admiralty cases.\nSo there's no non-constitutional basis for\nimmunity. The only constitutional basis for immunity\nis when the political entity is an arm of the State.\nAs this case comes to the Court, all agree that Chatham\nCounty is not. It necessarily follows, therefore, that\nChatham County was not entitled to immunity and that\nthe judgment of the court of appeals should be\nreversed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The question presented is --\nis only sovereign immunity, isn't it? It's -- we don't\nhave to decide whether there might be some other type\nof immunity.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That's right. That's right,\nJustice Scalia. To the extent that sovereign immunity\nis understood to mean constitutional immunity, as\ndistinct from some judge-made or statutory immunity,\nthat's right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nHimmelfarb.\nMr. Hart.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF R. JONATHAN HART\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. HART: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please\nthe Court:\nThe county that has been expressly delegated\nthe core sovereign function by the State, unique or\nsovereign function, such as navigable waters, is\nentitled to residual sovereign immunity in an in\npersonam admiralty action.\nJustice Ginsburg just asked a question about\ncounties in cases. I know of no case where a State has\ndelegated a core sovereign function, cloaked the entity\nwith immunity, in which this Court has ruled it's not the\narm of the State.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Who pays judgments? Who\npays judgments against the county?\nMR. HART: Who pays judgments against the\ncounty is initially probably the county, but under\nGeorgia law, the department of DOT -- Department of\nTransportation has a fund in which they can contribute\ntowards that. And if you've looked in -- and I think\nfunding matters less here than -- than the fact that\nthese big projects are generally a collage of funding\nissues. You have State and Federal money usually mixed\nin. So you're in a situation where, you know, if you\nwent back 50 years ago and looked at funding, it might\nbe very definitive. In these days and times, if you\nlook at projects, you know, you got money coming from\nall sources, and if you start tracing the -- the money,\nyou can go in six different directions.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Hart --\nMR. HART: And I think the dignity interest\n-- excuse me.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that was one of\nthe main indicia of whether an entity had been set up\nas an arm of the State, that is, the State would be\ndirectly liable.\nMR. HART: Well, I think the Hess case says\nthat -- that it -- that it's one of the default issues,\nand then you go to the dignity interest and the funding\ninterest. But if you go back and look at the\nCalifornia Regents case v. John Doe, in that case, it\nshows and explains why funding becomes not a whole lot\nin the way of meaningful factor because if you looked at --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, core -- core\ngovernment functions isn't -- isn't the test either. I\nmean --\nMR. HART: I understand that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- you know, the Federal\nGovernment and I think some States gave -- gave\nrailroads the power to condemn land. Did that make\nrailroads sovereigns entitled to sovereign immunity? I\ndon't think so.\nMR. HART: No, sir, I wouldn't argue that either.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So the mere fact that --\nthat your county is exercising some, quote, core\ngovernment functions, that -- that doesn't -- doesn't\nget you there.\nMR. HART: Well, I think you look at the --\nthe history, you look at the dignity of the State, and\nyou look at the functional realities of State\nmanagement. And if you look at the history, counties\nwere immune at common law in England. Counties were\nimmune at the time of the framing.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That was -- in many\nof those cases cited in your brief, it was because the\nduties they were performing they were performing pro\nbono publico.\nMR. HART: Sure.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the doctrine\nextended immunity to them on that basis, not -- not as\nsovereigns.\nMR. HART: Well, it extended -- it extended\nto them as part of an overall sovereignty -- sovereign\nimmunity picture.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It wasn't sovereign\nimmunity. It was -- charities had immunity until very\nrecently. Some States still had it when I was in law\nschool. You couldn't sue a charity for tort.\nMR. HART: I still think if you go back and\nlook at these core functions and if you -- if you\ndefine that as something that's being delegated by the\nState where the State says we want you to have\nsovereign immunity, then that's something that should\nbe respected as part of the dignity of the State.\nIn this particular case, Georgia is extremely\nstrong on that point. It's in the constitution that --\nthat counties can handle bridges. It's in the\nconstitution that they're immune. You can only waive\nit by an act of the legislature.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What -- what other sorts of\ntorts would this apply to, as applied to Chatham\nCounty? If Chatham County --\nMR. HART: Torts?\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- were sued, yes -- if\nChatham County were sued for something done by a law\nenforcement officer, would your theory apply?\nMR. HART: I think the -- I think -- no, sir,\nI don't think under -- like a 1983 action or a\nFourteenth Amendment exception under section 5, I don't\nthink the immunity would reach that far. I think the\ncounty would still be exposed to the liability there\nunder that case law. I don't think you have to do away\nwith what you have under the Fourteenth Amendment --\nexcuse me -- under the Eleventh Amendment or the case\nlaws thereunder. But I don't think that those -- those\ncases under there define the whole of sovereign immunity\nof the general principles of sovereign --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, has the Eleventh\nCircuit or did the old Fifth Circuit ever apply this\ndoctrine in any area outside of admiralty?\nMR. HART: Not that I am aware of.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What are you relying on in\nthe Georgia constitution? It doesn't mention counties,\ndoes it? It just says except as specifically provided\nin this paragraph, sovereign immunity extends to the\nState and all of its departments and agencies.\nMR. HART: Yes, sir. And there's strong case\nlaw, the Millwood case, that says basically counties\nare part of the sovereign of the State. And as\nrecently as last year, in a lawsuit against the\nDepartment of Corrections, the -- the Attorney General\nof the State argued that the county was a sovereign of\nthe State, part of the State, took the position it\ncouldn't be sued because a sovereign can't sue itself.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There can be no -- no --\nwell, I assume you have a -- a tort -- tort claims act\nthat waives sovereign immunity in some circumstances.\nMR. HART: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But apart from that, you\ncan't sue counties in tort.\nMR. HART: You can -- generally in the -- in\n-- as a county -- as a State law claim, no, unless\nthere's a waiver. Now, the legislature has waived --\nthere's been quite a few waivers in the last year.\nThey just waived in automobile insurance cases, for\nexample. And -- and that's a matter of the State.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: To what -- what other area\nwould this apply? If the county has sovereign\nimmunity, how about the county school board?\nMR. HART: We would contend that the core\nsovereign function has to truly be a core sovereign\nfunction and it has to be supported by some type of\nhistory, some type of -- of State dignity there and --\nand some reality --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And education would not --\nMR. HART: And we would not put education in\nthat class. If you go back and look at the history at\nthe time of framing, you would have to start looking at\nwhat government did do and didn't do. Now, you could do a\nhistorical analysis, and maybe I would be wrong and the\nhistory would show that education was important. But\nmy understanding is education at that time was probably\na pretty local matter.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How about the sanitation\ndepartment?\nMR. HART: That would get sort of iffy there\nfrom the standpoint that public health, quarantines,\nthose type of services for disease were handled by the\nState and were handled in a -- in a manner that you\nmight be able to define it as a core function, but that\nwould probably be a stretch.\nThis is a narrow exception and we think it\ndeserves that insofar as the navigable waters.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm not sure\nthat operating bridges at the time of the framing was a\ncore sovereign function.\nMR. HART: Well, it --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There are an awful\nlot of private bridges.\nMR. HART: Yes, sir.\nThe -- the exception, though, was at common\nlaw, counties could not be liable for the operation and\nmaintenance of bridges, and that was adopted by Georgia\nprior to the time of the framing and that was the law\nof the State. And we would take the position that that\nsurvived under this residual sovereign immunity theory.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's bridge\nimmunity, not sovereign immunity. I mean --\nMR. HART: Well, we're -- we're focusing that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- it doesn't come -- it\ndoesn't come within the Federal Constitution.\nMR. HART: Well, neither does Federal\nsovereign immunity come textually within the\nConstitution.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, no, I'm not talking\nabout textually. I'm talking about in structure.\nThere's nothing in the structure that has anything to\ndo with bridges.\nMR. HART: The answer to that question is\nthat if you look at the -- the function of -- of State\ngovernment and you look at what they define as being\nimportant -- and in this case, Georgia has defined that\nas one of the functions under its constitution and\nunder its statutes -- then there's a dignity interest\nthere that ought to be respected insofar as outside\nthat realm.\nOne of the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this? Are you\nsuggesting that a county could be an arm of the State\nfor some purposes but not for others?\nMR. HART: Yes, sir, I believe that. We\ndon't concede that we might not fit in the -- that we\ncould -- could not fit in within the arm of the State.\nThe Court chose in the question presented not to\naddress that issue and asked us to address the issue\noutside -- assuming we were not an -- we were a non-arm\nof the State. And our brief does make some mention of\n-- of the arm of the State analysis within it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the -- the court\nof appeals has said that you weren't asserting that you\nwere an arm of the State.\nMR. HART: Well, we were asserting that we\nwere -- we were immune under residual sovereign\nimmunity and we conceded for -- that the county has not\ngenerally been recognized under the Eleventh Amendment\nas being sovereign -- as sovereign -- having sovereign\nimmunity. That is not to -- and -- and we needed some\nway to distinguish that from the immunity that we're\narguing, the immunity retained by the States. And we\nfeel that that's something that could -- could have\nbroader parameters than -- than the current arm of the\nState test.\nAnd the focus ought to be on these core\nfunctions, history and dignity, and the functionality of\nthe State. That takes you away from your Eleventh\nAmendment analysis where you're dealing with sovereign\nimmunity all the time in -- in that context, and you're\nnow moving to discussing general principles of\nsovereign immunity outside the context of the Eleventh\nAmendment in defining those contours, and we feel like\nthis might give you a mechanism by which to do that.\nAnd it's a very narrow exception, and it\nwould be something that the Court could rule on or the\nCourt could simply rule that counties were immune in in\npersonam admiralty actions, if you wanted to make it\neven a more narrow ruling.\nOne of the things that has been argued by the\nSolicitor General is that there's a single sovereign\nimmunity, that there's this unified sovereign immunity.\nAnd it's -- and to the extent that we're talking about\ngeneral principles of sovereign immunity, we agree with\nthat. We do not agree with the part that says that\nwhen we deal with Eleventh Amendment arm of the State,\nthat that part defines the whole.\nAnd when you get into a situation of -- of\nhow do you define the sovereign -- sovereign immunity,\nyou have sovereign immunity at the Federal Government\nlevel, and if it's a single sovereign immunity that you\naccept and as argued by the -- by -- by the Solicitor\nGeneral's office, then the question becomes, is there a\nreciprocal sovereign immunity that's coextensive with\nFederal sovereign immunity? And that's an argument\nthat -- that certainly could be made. It -- and it was\naddressed somewhat or raised somewhat in Alden where\nthey discussed we're not ready to say if the Federal\nGovernment is raising sovereign immunity, which they do\non a regular basis, that perhaps the States might not\nhave that.\nNow, we're not arguing that the county in any\nway would have sovereign immunity to the extent of the\nFederal Government. We're saying that insofar as these\nfunctions that have a history at common law at the time\nof the framing and has been consistently recognized by\nthe Supreme Court, navigable waters and the soils\nthereunder have always been considered to be a\nsovereign interest of the State by this Court.\nIf you go back and look at the St. Anthony\nFalls case, at that time they were dealing with\nriparian rights, and -- and there was a deference to\nthe State in regard to that. You also had the Coeur\nD'Alene Indian Tribe dealing with submerged lands, and\nyou recognized the sovereign interests of the State in\nthose situations, and in the Seminole Tribe case, said\nthere's no exceptions in regard to carving out an\nexception to an admiralty immunity.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All that establishes\nis simply that if the State were operating this bridge\nand if the State were on the hook for any judgments and\nif the State had control over the people who were\nmaking the decisions, that there might be an issue of\nState sovereign immunity.\nMR. HART: Yes, sir.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The whole problem is\nthat it's the county that's doing all that.\nMR. HART: We understand that, but we're\nacting on behalf of the State and acting as the State\nthere and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the State\ndoesn't pay the damages.\nMR. HART: The State --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The State doesn't\ntell you how to do it.\nMR. HART: The State has the potential to pay\ndamages there through -- through the DOT, the\nDepartment of Transportation funds.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If it wishes. If it wishes.\nMR. HART: If it wishes. I have to concede\nthat point.\nBut from the -- from the standpoint, if you\ngo back to California Regents case, there wasn't a\nwhole lot of potential liability there. Theoretically\nthey may have, but they had a contract. The State had\na contract there in which it was indemnified by -- by\nthe Federal Government.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The State can pay my damages\nif it wishes. It just doesn't happen to have a statute\nto that effect right now. But I mean, that -- surely,\nthat doesn't -- doesn't --\nMR. HART: Well, we take the position that\nthe funding issue and the control issue ought to be\nless -- outside of the Eleventh Amendment analysis, arm\nof the State ought to be something that matters less.\nThe dignity interest ought to matter more.\nThe funding issue is something that in every\nmajor project, you've got a collage of funding, and it\ncomes from all different sources. And to some extent,\nwho pays the bill and how they pay the bill depends on\nthe structure of the deal. And I don't think it's very\nenlightening, as it was once 50 years ago when things\nwere much simpler. We're also talking about, in bridge\ncases or most building road projects, you have the\nsituation where a lot of times the State comes to one\nof its entities and says, we'll give you the money,\nbuild a bridge. We'll build -- build the road. Quite\nfrequently that happens all the time in larger\ncounties. If the county does the function that it's\ndoing for the State --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's a\ndifferent question. The immunity looks to where the\nmoney is going to come from to satisfy a judgment. I\ndon't think it looks to where the funding came from in\nthe first instance.\nMR. HART: Well, the -- the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's the claim on the\ntreasury of the judgment that raises the sovereign\nimmunity issues.\nMR. HART: Insofar as this case goes, there\nis the potential for payment by the State, and -- and\nthat's about all we can say there. We'll have to -- we\n-- as Justice Scalia said, is -- is there a absolute\nduty for them to pay it? But -- but the practicality\nof it is usually when they delegate you the function\nand the State arms you with sovereign immunity and\ntells you to go out and do that, they will step up to\nthe batter's box at the time something like that would\noccur because they have sort of delegated that core\nfunction to you to do.\nThe control issue we feel is something that\nthe dignity issue ought to take precedence over. The\ncontrol issue is something that the State decides\nduring the delegation, and if you wish to place an\nemphasis on the control, then you're asking -- asking\nbasically, do you require the State to make a certain\nkind of delegation?\nEarlier we had a question that -- that\nfollowed up on the issue of if there -- if we just did\na single function alone, built a bridge without\nanything else, would that alone create a responsibility\non the part of the county? And I think in -- in regard\nto that, the core function here is the county accepting\nthe responsibility of the State.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the South\nCarolina Supreme Court's opinion in the Hines case\nwhich seems to run counter to your argument?\nMR. HART: Yes, ma'am. The Hines case was an\nEleventh Amendment case, number one. Number two, it --\nit did state, in the front end of the case, that they\nwould apply the substantive law of admiralty\nirrespectively of the forum. But the residual\nsovereign immunity issue was never argued by either\nside in the case. That case went up on -- as a result\nof the granting of a motion to dismiss on a fairly\nskimpy record there, and the funding issue was never\nreally -- really analyzed there. So we see that as a\n-- a case that typically is Eleventh Amendment case\nand there has not been any ruling whatsoever in -- in\nthe context of whether there would be residual\nsovereign immunity.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Hart, may I ask this\nquestion? In the -- I noticed the opinion is a per\ncuriam opinion of the Eleventh Circuit. Was the case\nargued orally in the Eleventh Circuit or was it\nsubmitted?\nMR. HART: No, sir, it was not.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It was submitted.\nMR. HART: Just submitted.\nThe --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the Eleventh\nCircuit had a prior decision, didn't they?\nMR. HART: Yes. Yes, ma'am. There had been\na similar case arising out of Chatham County, and it\nwent up and was affirmed per curiam, and then there was\na short opinion the second time the case went -- went\n-- the second case went up, and there was a very short\nopinion in regard to that, taking deference to their\ndecision in the -- in the first opinion and talking a\nlittle bit about the residual sovereign immunity issue\nthat we had here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That was an old Fifth\nCircuit case --\nMR. HART: Yes. There was a Wickman case\nthat -- that was several years ago that is still good\nin the Fifth, and our circuit adopted that when they\nput in the new circuit.\nWhat we're asking here today is basically a\nvery narrow holding. We're asking that there be\nlimited sovereign immunity -- there -- excuse me --\nthat there be -- in unique circumstances where core\nfunctions of the State are delegated to the county,\nthat the county would have sovereign immunity, and that\na State can cloak a county with sovereign immunity. It\nseems that that is an issue that the State ought to be\nable to do out of its delegation -- out of its dignity\nfunction. They ought to have the right to run the\nState and -- and delegate those functions as they see\nfit.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not unusual that\ncounties maintain and run bridges in your State, is it?\nI mean, that's --\nMR. HART: Yes, sir, that's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's the normal --\nMR. HART: I don't know if I'd go so far as\nnormal, but for larger communities, yes, sir.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Then -- then how do\nwe know it's a core dignity function of the State if\nthey're -- the normal rule is somebody else does it?\nMR. HART: Well, it's a function that\nhistorically in the Constitution was recognized would\nbe a function on behalf of the State with the counties.\nAnd -- and it has traditionally historically been a\nfunction of the States to build roads and run bridges.\nAnd in regard to that, you're talking about navigable\nwaters, and the State has an interest in its own\nnavigable waters. They're delegating a function of the\ngovernment to build a bridge over their navigable\nwaters and the soils thereunder. So we would take the\nposition there that -- that that is a core sovereign\nfunction, that the navigable waters are a sovereign\ninterest of the State, and that should have the dignity\nand respect of that.\nThe design of the Constitution was that there\nwould be dual sovereignty created both in federalism\nand under State sovereignty. There's not a single case\nyou all are going to have that's going to be able to\ndefine all the principles of general sovereign\nimmunity, but we think this is a situation in which the\nCourt, by making a holding in in personam actions, can\nrecognize the State's residual immunity, not so much\nfocus on the Eleventh Amendment and the cases\nthereunder, but try to come up with a set of principles\nthat you can begin talking about the whole of general\nsovereign immunity.\nAnd we do not necessarily agree that the --\nthe State -- the arm of the State test has to apply in\nall situations. We think this is an exception. It's a\nnarrow exception. Core sovereign functions are going\nto be narrowly defined, especially when a county is\nacting. You're going to have to support it with some\nhistory. You're going to have to support it with some\nState dignity where the State has given a clear\nindication through their State laws that it's a\nfunction that the county ought to do, and -- and that\nneeds to be respected from the standpoints that States\nare given wide latitude in the way that they set up and\nrun their government.\nAnd we respectfully request that you make a\nfinding that we have the right to have sovereign\nimmunity in this particular narrow set of circumstances\ninvolving navigable waters as -- as it stands. Thank\nyou.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Hart.\nMr. Estrada, you have 8 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL A. ESTRADA\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ESTRADA: Mr. Chief Justice, just a few\npoints.\nOn the issue that was raised by Justice\nAlito, the -- this doctrine comes from the Wickman case\nfrom the old Fifth Circuit. That case relied primarily\non a -- on a case called Kegan from the Supreme Court\nof Florida, which was, indeed, a bridge case, but it\nwas not an admiralty case. It was a case in which\nsomeone who was crossing a bridge with a heavy truck\nfell through the bridge because the -- the bridge was\nstructurally unsafe. The old Fifth Circuit sort of\ntook it as a bridge case and took over that doctrine.\nIf that fact -- scenario were to come up\nin Chatham County and the plaintiffs and the defendants\nwere diverse, there is no question that -- that the\ncounty would be entitled to plead its State law\nimmunity under Erie.\nI will point out incidentally that even\nthough in this case there is a diversity of citizenship\nand admiralty jurisdiction, this Court held in 1953 in\na case called Pope & Talbot v. Hawn that in that\ncircumstance, any defense that is available solely on\nthe diversity side under Erie gets trumped by the\nuniform application of the maritime law. So that would\nnot be an issue here.\nWith respect to the question that was raised\nby Justice Ginsburg, Hines was an admiralty case in\nState court. Under no stretch of construction could\nthat be viewed as an Eleventh Amendment case since it\nwas not a case in law or equity and it was not in\nFederal court.\nAnd number three, the proprietary\ngovernmental distinction has been rejected in the\nWorkman case itself where it was raised in the specific\ncontext of admiralty. I will point out it has never\nbeen part of this Court's sovereign immunity doctrine,\nand with respect, other areas of federalism law tend to\nindicate that it should not be adopted now.\nYou may recall that such a distinction\nbetween core and non-core governmental functions was at\nthe core of the -- of this -- this Court's cases under\nNational League of Cities v. Usery, and in the Garcia\ncase, the Court overruled National League of Cities\nprimarily on the point that the distinction between\ncore and non-core governmental functions had proven to\nbe unworkable.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're -- are you\nsuggesting that the -- the State would enjoy sovereign\nimmunity in proprietary activities?\nMR. ESTRADA: I am suggesting that if you\nnamed the State on the wrong side of the caption on the\nV in Federal court, it does enjoy sovereign immunity,\nirrespective of what your cause of action is. Yes, Mr.\nChief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I would have\nthought, particularly when we're talking about the arm\nof the State doctrine, that the -- the nature of the\nactivity is one of the key questions we look at.\nMR. ESTRADA: I think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maintaining bridges\nis one thing. You know, operating a for-profit\nactivity would be something else.\nMR. ESTRADA: I think it's -- it's sort of\ninherent in all of the cases that have been ruled upon,\nMr. Chief Justice, that what tends to be delegated are\nthose that are the normal functions of government, but\nI don't think this Court has ever held that it is the\nfunction of sovereign immunity doctrine to tell the\nStates what are the appropriate functions of\ngovernment. So I don't think there would be a\ndistinction that would be supported by the cases.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I always thought the\ngovernmental proprietary distinction really came up in\nState law cases involving municipal liability. That's\nprincipally where it --\nMR. ESTRADA: It did early on, and that was\n-- that was one of the issues that was put forth in the\nWorkman case, Justice Scalia. With respect to the\nadmiralty jurisdiction of the U.S. courts, this Court\nsaid in 1901 that it carried no weight.\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I have nothing\nfurther.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
