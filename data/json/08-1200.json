        "content": "(11:21 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument next in Case 08-1200, Jerman v. Carlisle,\nMcNellie, Rini, Kramer, & Ulrich.\nMr. Russell.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. RUSSELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nCongress rarely makes ignorance of the law a\ndefense to civil liability, and the Fair Debt Collection\nPractices Act is no exception to that rule. While it\nmay seem unfair to hold defendants in some sense\nstrictly liable for legal mistakes in the civil context,\nthe accumulated wisdoms of generations of legal practice\nhas been that attempting to fix that unfairness through\na mistake of law defense causes more harm than it\nprevents.\nAnd as a consequence, in light of that\nsubtle understanding, courts should not read a Federal\nstatute to establish a mistake of law defense, unless\nCongress quite plainly makes that intent to do so clear.\nAnd in this case, nothing in the text, structure, or the\nhistory of the bona fide error provision of the FDCPA\nindicates such an intent.\nI could begin with the -- the text of the\nstatute. It is not enough under the bona fide error\nprovision that the defendant's violation be in good\nfaith, that it have been bona fide.\nThere is an additional element, that the\ndefendant has to show that the violation was not\nintentional. And in common legal discourse, a violation\nis not rendered unintentional simply because the\ndefendant misunderstood the legal consequences of its\nactions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think -- reading\n\"intentional\" the way you just articulated is absolutely\nright, but when you add -- I don't see what work \"bona\nfide error\" does in the statute, if \"intentional\" should\nbe read in this case to mean what you say.\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, I think it captures the\ncircumstance in which somebody makes a mistake of fact,\nbut does so and with -- not in good faith. I think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you say: Well,\nintentional means you meant to send out the document;\nyou meant to serve it; in other words, no specific\nintent requirement. But if -- a bona fide error, it\nseems, doesn't make the activity not intentional under\nthe traditional understanding of intentional.\nMR. RUSSELL: But I think that's right. I\nthink both provisions do separate work, and so that if\nall it took to show that something wasn't intentional is\nthat you didn't mean to violate the law, it would be\nvery difficult to understand what work \"bona fide\" was\ndoing in that circumstance.\nAnd I think Congress included the bona fide\nrequirement in order to capture instances in which\npeople make factual mistakes, but not in good faith.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I really don't think that\nthe -- the word that we're wrestling with here is the --\nthe word \"intentional.\" It seems to me it's the word\n\"violation,\" because violation -- when it says the\nviolation was intentional or unintentional, does\n\"violation\" mean the act that constitutes a violation of\nthe law, or does \"violation\" mean the -- the fact of\nviolating the law?\nMR. RUSSELL: I think that is the central\nquestion here and it is Respondents' best argument. I\nthink that the word \"violation\" is best understood to\nrefer to the act. That is how this Court has construed\nthat word in the statutory phrase \"knowing violation\" in\na number of cases, and that's how the courts of appeals\nhave construed the term \"intentional\" -- or \"intentional\nviolation\" in the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural\nWorkers Protection Act, which we cited in our brief.\nI did mention in our brief that it is a less\nusual formulation, \"intentional violation,\" and at the\ntime we wrote our briefs we weren't able to find any\ncases from this Court construing that particular term.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what -- the part that's\nworrying me most is where the lawyer is the debt\ncollector. All right? So he's within the act, and he\nhas a client of debt collectors, and the clients all\nsay: Please go collect the debt. And they say: We\nwant to do this, like in this -- suppose in this case,\nthey say: Tell us if you don't owe it; ask them to\nwrite a letter to that effect; we won't collect it; now,\nis that legal?\nAnd the lawyer looks up everything in sight\nand says, yes, it's legal. And then that's what he\nthinks. All the circuits have said this. And then he\nasks the FTC and they say, yes, it's legal. So there he\nis. Everybody's told him it's legal. And lo and\nbehold, this Court, surprisingly, holds the opposite.\nWell, he shouldn't be liable. And if he has to worry\nabout that, he can never defend his client. The only\nanswer is: Whatever the man says who is opposed to your\nclient, that's what you have to do. That can't be the\nmeaning of this statute.\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, let me address the\nhypothetical, to make sure I understand it. If we're\ntalking -- well, first of all, if we are talking about a\ncase in which they've asked the opinion of the FTC, they\nare entitled to the safe harbor defense, because\nCongress specifically --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. What the FTC said\nis: We won't give you one.\nMR. RUSSELL: Okay. Well, in that\ncircumstance, I think it's important to distinguish\nbetween lawyers who are simply giving advice to debt\ncollector clients -- they're not covered by the act.\nIt's only when the lawyer engages in debt collection\nactivities himself. And a lot of the time the debt --\nthe lawyer is simply --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does litigation constitute\ndebt -- debt collection activity?\nMR. RUSSELL: Yes. This Court held in\nHeintz that litigation can be a form of --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So he is a lawyer\nlitigating for a client. That was my hypothetical.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. RUSSELL: In that circumstance -- in\nthat circumstance, I think yes, the lawyer can be held\nliable for -- for mistakes. But to the extent this\nCourt --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's not a mistake. The\npoint is, in a sense, that any decent lawyer would say\nthat's what the law was; that sometimes lawyers get\nsurprised because courts don't always act the way they\nthink is reasonable.\nMR. RUSSELL: And when that happens, their\nclients are almost never protected from liability, for\n-- because they did what their lawyers reasonably told\nthem to. And the antitrust --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why aren't they in good\nfaith?\nMR. RUSSELL: The lawyer?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Both.\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, certainly, because there\ngenerally is a mistake of law defense.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Ah, but that's in your view\nof it. I am saying that the opposite view of it is that\nyour view of it puts lawyers in an impossible position,\nlet alone the client.\nMR. RUSSELL: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It -- it's not just that\nit's unfair. It's worse than unfair. The lawyer is\nunder an obligation to represent his client, and he\ncannot do anything but tell the client: Just pay money\nto this particular plaintiff whose view of the law is\ntotally contrary to every circuit court that's ever\ndecided it. Now, how can you put lawyers in that\nposition?\nMR. RUSSELL: I think the lawyers are not in\na terribly different position than is, for example, the\nexecutive of a company that has a fiduciary duty to its\nshareholders to maximize profits and is considering a\nventure that could violate the antitrust laws. And in\nthat circumstance, they have to make a calculated\njudgment, because the antitrust laws don't have a\nmistake of law defense. And neither does any other\ncivil --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you are sort of\nbegging the question there. I mean, the antitrust laws\nalso don't have a bona fide error defense, and the\nquestion is whether that includes a legal mistake\ndefense.\nMR. RUSSELL: That's right. And my -- my\npoint simply is that you shouldn't read that defense as\nnecessarily creating a mistake of law defense simply\nbecause you think it's so unfair, because that\nunfairness is simply common.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But it -- but it suggests\nthat you would like a -- a sensible interpretation of\nthis that avoids the result I said, if possible. And\nthere is a different way of going about it, which is you\ncould say that a bona fide error in respect to a lawyer\nimposes much higher standards on that lawyer than it\ndoes on most -- and it's simply a client -- that before\nyou can call an error bona fide, that lawyer really has\nto look into it. He has to have asked the FTC. He has\nto have gotten -- and made an effort to get a letter\nback. And if there are one or two circuits that hold\nthe other way, well, where? And if you don't, you are\nnot bona fide.\nNow, that would get to virtually the same\nplace but it would protect the lawyer against true legal\nsurprise.\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, I do think that if you\ndisagree with us, that's the better reading than the\nsecond. That's not the reading most courts have given.\nIt's not the reading that the Sixth Circuit gave in this\ncase.\nBut I think there is every reason to think\nthat if Congress was concerned about the especially\nproblematic application of this statute to lawyer\nconduct and particularly to litigation conduct, it would\nhave expected courts to deal with that in different way,\nand not through the bona fide error defense, which,\nafter all, applies to lawyer who are engaging in the\nsame conduct as lay debt collectors and to nonlawyers\nalike. It's a very blunt instrument for dealing with\nthis problem.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One -- one of the\nthings you have to include on this initial communication\nis the name of the creditor, right?\nMR. RUSSELL: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So let's say\nthe bank that is the creditor is being sold or taken\nover. And, you know, you have heard that, well, they\nhave merged, but, you know, the closing date of the\nmerger is two months later or whatever. It's just not\nclear what the name of the creditor is. So you -- you\nare not a lawyer, but you are trying to collect the\ndebt, and you go -- you fill in, I -- it's either A or\nB, and you say: I think it's A, and you fill it in and\nit turns out that it's -- it's B. Let's say that's a\nbona fide error. Okay?\nBut if you are sitting there as the debt\ncollector and you say: I don't know if it's A or B.\nAnd you say: I know; I'll call the lawyer. You call\nthe lawyer and the lawyer says: Oh, it's -- it's B -- I\nmean, it's -- it's A. And you put down A and it turns\nout it's wrong, aren't -- you are in a worse position if\nyou ask the lawyer than if you didn't, right?\nMR. RUSSELL: No, because in either\ncircumstance it would be a factual error. It would be\nsubject to the bona fide error defense.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, it's a -- it's a\nlegal -- the lawyer looks at it and says: Well, you\nknow, the merger is not going to close for whatever, but\nI think it's still this bank. And it turns out his\nlegal analysis of who the creditor is was wrong.\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, again, I'm not sure that\nthat's a legal -- but assuming that it is a legal\nmistake --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. RUSSELL: -- I think that the client is\nnot -- I mean, if it's a legal mistake, it's a legal\nmistake for the client as well as the lawyer, and I\nthink either one of them would be in the same position.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if the client\njust says: I'm not going to ask the lawyer; I'm just\ngoing to make -- I think it's A -- it's a bona fide\nerror, but it's an error -- he gets the benefit of that\nposition. But if he asks the lawyer, he doesn't get the\nbenefit.\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, under our view, he\nwouldn't get benefit under either circumstance, because\nit would be a mistake of law and the statute doesn't\ncover it.\nIf I could finish my answer --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Who the -- who the\ncreditor is is necessarily a mistake of law, rather than\nfact?\nMR. RUSSELL: No. That's why I -- I\ninitially told you I thought it was a mistake of fact,\nand that would be a mistake of fact for the lawyer or\nthe client. And I think actually, in that scenario --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, is it a\nmistake of fact if the lawyer does legal research to\nfind it out?\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, I don't think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He looks and he\nsays: Well, it depends upon the date of the closing of\nthe merger, not the announcement.\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, if the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it turns out\nthat's a legal mistake.\nMR. RUSSELL: Then I -- I don't think the\ndefense would apply and I don't think it would apply to\nthe client, either.\nBut I do think that if you are especially\nconcerned about applying the law to lawyers and to\nlitigation, it's much more likely that Congress intended\nthe Court to deal with that in a tailored way by\ninterpreting the substantive provisions of the statute\nwith that particular problem in mind.\nKnowing that Congress didn't have litigation\nconduct specifically in mind when it enacted this\nstatute, because at the time lawyers were excluded from\nthe act altogether, and keeping in mind in addition that\nCongress presumably didn't intend the act to\nunreasonably interfere with litigation collection\nmethods, and the constitutional aspects --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So how -- how do we do\nthat? Because you see, you are quite right. The client\nruns the same risk in antitrust law in a whole other lot\nof areas. Absolutely right. But once you bring the\nlawyer into it, the lawyer has what he doesn't have in\nan antitrust case under your reading, which is an\nincentive to distort the law in order to protect his own\npocketbook. And that is, to me, a big problem.\nSo you say there is -- there is a -- a way\naround that. And what?\nMR. RUSSELL: And that is to recognize that,\nas this Court held in Heintz, that Congress didn't\nintend for every unsuccessful lawsuit to result in\nliability under this statute. Plaintiffs have to point\nto some particular provision of the statute that was\nviolated by what the lawyer did in litigation.\nAnd for example, the lawyer makes a mistake\nabout the statute of limitations. Some courts have held\nthat that constitutes a violation of the provisions\nagainst deceptive practices or unconscionable collection\npractices --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The lawyer writes a letter\nto the client. The first thing the lawyer tries to do\nis to settle the case. \"Dear Client: Please send me\nthe money, and by the way, if you don't owe it, tell me\nin writing.\"\nOkay? That's what the lawyer does. That's\na legal activity. It's at the heart of practicing law,\nbecause nobody goes to court anymore. And -- though he\nwill, if necessary, so he's part of this.\nNow, how do we get out of this problem that\nI'm putting? I'm really looking for an answer to that,\nbecause I think it's a big problem.\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, typically -- I don't\nknow that that's a uniquely lawyerly activity. Lay debt\ncollectors do that all the time.\nBut to the extent you think that Congress\ncould not have intended that kind of activity to be\nsubject to liability when somebody makes a reasonable\nlegal error, I think it's more likely that Congress\nintended you to look at what provision of the statute\nare they saying was violated and construe that provision\nin a way that is consistent with your expectations about\nwhat Congress would have meant, rather than providing --\nrather than, you know, taking the bona fide error\nprovision to do that work, when the bona fide error\nprovision is much broader and would apply to all kinds\nof mistakes of law, including having this consequence of\nbasically giving debt collectors the opportunity to take\nthe narrowest possible construction of -- of consumers'\nrights, as long as the -- the question is unsettled.\nThe other reason to think that Congress\nwouldn't have intended this to be the solution to that\nproblem is that at the time they wrote the bona fide\nerror defense, lawyers weren't included, so this could\nnot have been Congress' intended solution to that\nparticular problem.\nAnd at the time Congress used this language,\nit was borrowing it from the Truth in Lending Act, where\nit had an established meaning in the circuit courts as\nnot including the mistake of law defense, and that\nremained the interpretation of the Fair Debt Collection\nPractices Act provision as well, for -- for nearly\n25 years.\nIt wasn't until 2002 that the court of\nappeals first suggested that it did not extend to legal\nmistakes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, if the district\ncourt were to say: You violated the act; this was a\nmistake of law not covered, but I'm not awarding\nstatutory damages because --\nMR. RUSSELL: I think they --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- in this case, just\nfor the reasons here, you did something the Sixth\nCircuit -- or that the circuit law said was permissible,\nso you didn't do it -- you did it intentionally because\nyou did the violation of the act, but it was based on a\nmistake of law.\nMR. RUSSELL: I do think that that's a\nperfectly permissible exercise of discretion. Congress\ngave the district court discretion with respect to\nstatutory damages, and that's another way of dealing\nwith this problem.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what about\nattorneys' fees?\nMR. RUSSELL: No, the attorneys' fees is not\ndiscretionary in that sense.\nAnd so there are other structural reasons,\nthough, to think that Congress knew how to make a\nmistake of law defense clearly and did not do so here.\nCongress did provide, in effect, a mistake\nof law defense to civil penalties. The civil penalties\nprovision that applies to this statute, which is at\n15 U.S.C. 45(m)(1), and that's quoted in relevant part\non page 24 of the blue brief, provides for very serious\ncivil penalties for somebody who acts with actual\nknowledge or knowledge fairly implied that the act was\nprohibited.\nAnd I think that provision shows two things.\nOne, it shows that Congress knows how to make an\nexpress -- how to expressly speak to a defendant's\nknowledge of the unlawfulness of his conduct.\nAnd in addition, it shows that Congress\ntreated knowledge of unlawfulness as an aggravating\ncircumstance, as something deserving of special\npunishment, rather than, as Respondents would have it,\nmost of the time being a minimum prerequisite for any\nliability at all.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Congress wrote this\nstatute to -- to have a cottage industry of litigation.\nThese were attorneys --\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, I -- I would not say\nthat. I would say that Congress wrote this statute, in\na way, to encourage private enforcement, to be sure. It\nenacted statutory damages and fee shifting because it\nunderstood that this was an industry in which there was\na particular risk of very aggressive and harmful\npractices, in part because debt collectors don't rely on\nthe good will of the consumers they deal with in order\nto prosper. And so all of the economic incentives in\nthe industry push people to aggressive practices, and\nCongress wanted this statute to be a counterweight to\nthat.\nAnd as in many circumstances, Congress\nenacts statutory language and puts up requirements and\nholds people to them civilly because the -- the general\nrule in our legal system is that the risk and the cost\nof a legal mistake is generally allocated to the\nlawbreaker in the civil context and not to the people's\nwhose rights have been violated. And there is no reason\nto think that Congress was acting particularly\ndifferently here.\nWe were speaking earlier on about the words\n\"intentional violation,\" and I wanted to bring to the\nCourt's attention the fact that after we filed our\nbrief, and in fact, last night, we -- we did find a case\nin which this Court construed that term, and we notified\nRespondents' counsel and the United States. And I just\nwant to give you the cite so you can look at it. It's\nEllis v. United States, 206 U.S. 246. The relevant\npassage is at page 257. It's a 1907 opinion from\nJustice Holmes.\nAnd it's consistent with the way that the\nCourt has construed the phrase \"knowing violation\" in a\nnumber of contexts, including in -- in the criminal\ncontext, where it's much more common for Congress to\nmake a mistake of law a defense to liability.\nI mentioned before that that kind of history\nof the development of the statute -- I think it's also\nworth noting, Justice Breyer, that at the time, Congress\nwithdrew the attorney exemption from the act. It was\nthe uniform opinion of the courts of appeals at that\ntime and all the district courts that the language of\nthe bona fide error defense did not create a mistake of\nlaw defense. And again, Congress had no reason to\nexpect that in subjecting the attorneys to that\nstatutory regime, that the bona fide error provision\nwould be the solution to any special problems.\nAnd Congress has also shown itself to be\nattentive to this special area of concern. In 2006, it\nmade a tailored adjustment to the statute to make clear\nthat pleadings are not an initial communication\ntriggering the validation notice requirement. And I\nthink that demonstrates that Congress is -- is on top of\nthis issue, and it stands at the ready to make\nadjustments that are necessary to make this legal system\noperate in a way that both makes sense, but nonetheless\ngives effect to their intent to treat attorney debt\ncollectors on a par with regular debt collectors who are\nnot attorneys.\nI should also mention, Justice Breyer, to\nthe extent there are some really intractable problems\nwith respect to the act application to attorneys,\nthere -- there is ongoing litigation in the lower courts\nabout the Noerr-Pennington doctrine about how the\nconstitutional implications of regulating in-court\nactivity apply to the Court's interpretation of the\nstatutory provisions.\nAnd again, I think it's more likely that\nthat is the solution Congress would have intended, an\ninterpretive solution --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, maybe your colleague\ncan, but how -- so they define a -- the reasonable error\nfalls in is because he's a person who regularly collects\nor attempts to collect consumer debts owed to a -- you\nknow, owed to another person. That's pretty broad.\nThat doesn't come about until '86. You are saying the\nbona fide language there is before, in '77?\nMR. RUSSELL: Yes. And at the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. But then what --\nhow -- but I still can't figure out how we get this\nthing to work here, and -- and you just came up with a\nnew idea.\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, no. It's -- again, it's\nthe same idea, that you construe the provisions in a way\nthat avoid the most troublesome applications of it to\nattorney conduct. So I was giving the example of state\nstatutes of limitations. I think it's very open to\ndispute whether attempting to collect a debt on which\nthe limitations period has run constitutes an unfair or\ndeceptive practice, because there's not a -- all it does\nis gives the -- the debtor the opportunity to raise an\naffirmative defense.\nAnd I think -- you know, in that\ncircumstance, Congress would not have intended the\nstatute to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So -- I get -- okay.\nMR. RUSSELL: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMr. Jay.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE\nSUPPORTING PETITIONER\nMR. JAY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI would like, if I may, to pick up with a\npoint that Mr. Russell made, which is that the FDCPA is\nof a piece with most civil regulatory statutes, in that\nit makes knowledge of the law an aggravating factor and\nsubjects violators who know that they are violating a\nlaw subject to substantial civil penalties of up to\n$16,000 per day. But it doesn't completely excuse\nviolations based on a lack of knowledge of the law. In\norder to be excused, the violation must have resulted\nfrom a bona fide error and meet all three elements of\nthe bona fide error defense.\nWe think that two of those elements are not\nsatisfied by the Respondents' error in this case.\nFirst, legal errors, for the reason Mr.\nRussell explained, aren't unintentional. Justice Scalia\nasked about whether the phrase \"the violation is not\nintentional\" is a signal in that respect. We think that\nthe work that that phrase, \"the violation was not\nintentional,\" does in this circumstance is to show that\nthe portion of the debt collector's conduct that\ntriggers the violation of the statute, it was -- is what\nmust be unintentional.\nLet me illustrate that with an example.\nUnder the statute, a debt collector who places a call to\na debtor at home after 9:00 at night may well violate\nthe statute; likely does violate the statute. So what\nmust be unintentional for that debt collector to make\nout the bona fide error defense is not that the\ntelephone call had been -- had been placed\nunintentionally, but rather that the debt collector\ndidn't have knowledge, for example, because of an error\nabout what time zone the debtor lives in.\nThe -- the debt collector didn't know that\nthe call was being placed after 9:00 at night. That is\nan unintentional error, and it is excused under the\nstatute if the debt collector can also show that it\nmaintains procedures reasonably adapted to prevent any\nsuch errors.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And your example of that\ncouldn't happen, because if you were calling debtors,\nyou should certainly check what time of evening the call\nis. So you get over the first problem, but then on the\nsecond problem, the second -- how could that possibly be\ncareful procedure, if you don't even check to see what\ntime zone the person is in?\nMR. JAY: Well, I think, Justice Ginsburg,\nif -- if you check, but due to a keyboarding error, for\nexample, Arizona is entered as Alabama or an error in\ntime zone is entered in whatever record is being\nconsulting by the debt collector, that's the kind of\nfactual error, a clerical, bookkeeping type error\nthat -- that Congress had in mind when it created this\ndefense. And it bears repeating that Congress has\ncreated this -- this defense in identical terms in a\nnumber of other statutes; federal agencies have\nconstrued the identical language in a number of other\nstatutes. And never has Congress or a federal agency\ncontemplated that one of these defenses would, in fact,\nencompass legal errors.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know why when\nCongress codified that law errors don't count, codified\nthat for the Truth in Lending Act purposes, it didn't\nmake the corresponding change in the others?\nMR. JAY: We don't have a specific\nindication, Justice Ginsburg, why it didn't go back and\nrevise every other statute that -- that already had such\na defense. But I think that the answer is simply that\nCongress was revising the Truth in Lending Act in a\nstatute called the Truth in Lending Simplification Act,\nand the -- the statute in which that was passed didn't\nmake any other -- any other changes to non-financial\nstatutes. It didn't reopen the Federal -- Fair Debt\nCollection Practice Act in any other way. In fact, the\nrelevant portion of the FDCPA, Section 1692k, hasn't\nbeen amended in any way since Congress first enacted it\nin 1977.\nSo we think that the relevance of the 1980\namendment to TILA is simply this: It's part of a\nconsistent pattern by Congress and by the agencies such\nas the Department of Housing and Urban Development and\nthe Federal Reserve Board that interpret statutes with\nidentical or very similar bona fide error provisions to\nsay: Errors of law are not what Congress or the agency\nhad in mind.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Even if the -- even if the\nerror of law is completely reasonable? Let's say in\nthis case the Sixth Circuit had a case directly on\npoint. Still, it was just too bad.\nMR. JAY: Well, I think, Justice Alito,\nthat that is not uncommon under any civil statute, that\nwhen a court of appeals has precedent on point, that\nthere is always a possibility that that precedent will\nbe reversed.\nNow, of course, this statute has a very\nshort statute of limitations. It's one year. And if\nthere's some possibility that the law will change down\nthe road, that short statute of limitations will prevent\nmost violations from being reconsidered down the road\nafter the -- after the law is clarified.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It also makes it hard to\nuse the safe harbor to get the -- to get advice from the\nFTC.\nMR. JAY: I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg. You\nare saying that the statute of limitations makes it\ndifficult?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That -- that if you\nhave -- you can -- you are home free if you ask the FTC,\nright?\nMR. JAY: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's the only --\nonly way you -- under your reading that you are home\nfree?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If you ask and they answer.\nMR. JAY: If you ask and they answer and\nthey say that your view of the statute is the correct\none.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How many times have\nthey answered in the past decade?\nMR. JAY: In the past decade,\nMr. Chief Justice, they have been asked seven times for\nopinions by the debt collection industry, and they have\nanswered four of them under the criteria that they\nadopted in the regulations they are cited in footnote 10\nof our brief.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that's not a very\nrealistic procedure to rely on, is it?\nMR. JAY: Well, the debt collection industry\nseems to not have asked very many times, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And why is that?\nBecause it's a little difficult dealing with the FTC\nbureaucracy and getting an answer from them in a\nreasonable time?\nMR. JAY: I submit, Mr. Chief Justice, that\nfirst, even if this were relevant to what Congress\nintended the -- how Congress intended the adviser\nopinion process to work when it wrote this provision in\n1977, that the debt collection industry, as we pointed\nout in our brief -- if you ask the FTC for an adviser\nopinion, and it sides against the requester, which,\nincidentally, in none of these four opinions has it ever\ndone -- in each case it sided with the requester -- but\nif it sides against, then the requester is on notice of\nthe law. And the requester is going to be -- as I\nmentioned at the outset, the requester is going to be in\nthe category of -- for heightened penalties, because it\nwill be very difficult to suggest that you don't know\nthe law.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you are saying\nthat the debt collection industry doesn't does ask the\nFTC, which would be a safe harbor for them, because if\nthey get a bad answer, they may not follow it and then\nthey may be subject to heightened penalties?\nMR. JAY: Well, I'm saying,\nMr. Chief Justice, that the -- that they would\nunderstandably prefer to ask their own lawyer for an\nopinion if the -- if this Court were to agree with the\nRespondent's position and affirm the Sixth Circuit.\nThey would be able to ask their own lawyer, get a\nprivate opinion, and if the opinion is favorable, then\nthey are home free under the bona fide error defense.\nIf -- if it's an -- if it's adverse advice,\nthey may need -- even if they disregard the advice, they\nmay never need to disclose the opinion at all, whereas\nthe FTC advisory opinion process clarifies the law for\nthe benefit of the entire field. Those opinions are\npublic. They are published and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but there are\nfour of them. I don't care how public they are. There\nare four of them over the past 10 years. It's not a\nvery reliable or usable effort to clarify the law and\naddress the problem that the statute presents.\nMR. JAY: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I submit\nthat you can't look simply at the number of responses\nwithout looking at the number of inquiries. And I am\nconfident that if this Court, as we urge that it do,\nreverses the Sixth Circuit and makes clear that asking\nyour own lawyer for an opinion is not going to be a safe\nharbor defense under Subsection C, that there will be\nincreased use of the -- of the safe harbor defense that\nCongress actually wrote into the statute in Subsection\nE.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we know what the time\ninterval was? You said there were seven requests for\naffirmative responses. How long did it take from when\nthe request was made until the FTC responded?\nMR. JAY: In the four that were granted,\nthree of them took three to four months. The fourth is\nan exception, and that -- that's the one cited in the\nretail collection attorneys' amicus brief.\nThat is an exception because the request was\noriginally submitted as a comment in a pending\nrulemaking conducted by the FTC and a number of other\nagencies. The FTC agreed to take that comment in the\nrulemaking and act on it an advisory opinion under the\nFDCPA so that it wouldn't have to wait for the other\nagencies to agree with its view, and so that one took\nconsiderably longer. But the average processing time is\nthree to four months.\nAnd of course the FTC makes a number of\nother informal guidance avenues available, if what the\ndebt collector wants is simply a quick answer and not a\nformal safe harbor with the imprimatur of the\nCommission. One can -- the Commission staff has\npublished guidance, and indeed, the Commission staff is\navailable over the telephone --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if that's wrong,\nit doesn't do you any good.\nMR. JAY: If that's wrong, it doesn't confer\nthe safe harbor. But that's up to the debt collector,\nMr. Chief Justice. If you -- if you want an informal\nopinion, you can get one very quickly. If you want the\nsafe harbor, that requires the imprimatur of the\ncommissioners, and that takes a bit longer.\nWe don't think that's at all inconsistent\nwith what Congress intended, and we do think that\nCongress intended that this be the primary avenue. And\nif you look at the advisory opinion provision of the\nTruth in Lending Act, we think that illustrates it.\nAt the time Congress enacted the FDCPA, the\nTruth in Lending Act advisory opinion provision had only\nbeen on the books for a couple of years, but it had\nalready filled more than 100 pages of the Code of\nFederal Regulations with advisory opinions. And we\nthink that that's how Congress intended for the law\nunder this statute to be clarified as well, not in a way\nthat effectively confers qualified immunity on debt\ncollectors whenever there is an ambiguity in the law.\nWe think that that is reinforced as well by\na substantive aspect of the statute, which is that\nCongress recognized -- and this is in particular in the\nlegislative history at page 18 in footnote 9 of our\nbrief -- that the debt collection industry is extremely\naggressive and looks for loopholes whenever they exist.\nSo the substantive prohibitions of the\nstatute, especially 1692d, e, and f, are written in such\na way that they contain broad, substantive prohibitions\nthat are illustrated by examples, but those examples\nexpressly are illustrative and not exclusive. Congress\nwould not have wanted a debt collector to be able to\nsay: Well, gee, this -- this practice is not expressly\naddressed by the statute and has not yet expressly been\naddressed by any judicial opinion, and to say: Well,\nthat law is not clearly established.\nWe think it's -- may I finish the\nsentence Mr. Chief Justice? We think, instead, that\nCongress would have recognized that the purpose of this\nstatute is to protect the unsophisticated debtor, and\nthat the sophisticated repeat players of the debt\ncollection industry, if they want to clarify the law,\nshould go to the FTC.\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Jay.\nMr. Coakley.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE S. COAKLEY\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. COAKLEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe starting point for discerning\ncongressional intent is the text of the statute. The\nRespondents submit that in a review of the text of this\nstatute, all of the components may be read plainly to\ninclude the bona fide error defense, to include legal\nerror, starting with the words that the Court was\ndiscussing with Mr. Russell and Mr. Jay, \"violation not\nintentional,\" moving on to \"violation resulting from a\nbona fide error,\" then \"the maintenance of procedures\nreasonably adapted.\"\nThe Sixth Circuit and the trial court and --\nhave construed this statute in a plain-meaning analysis;\nthat is to say, they start with the plain meaning of\neach of those words and construe them in their context.\nThey did not find an ambiguity. They did not find an\nabsurdity. They found that each of those -- each of\nthose components may be squared with a -- with a legal\nerror analysis.\nPetitioner even concedes with respect to the\nelement of \"violation not intentional\" that our\ninterpretation is, quote, \"not linguistically\nimpossible,\" end quote.\nWhat -- what Petitioner has done is to avoid\nthe conventional standards of -- of congressional -- I\nmean, of statutory interpretation, which is the\nplain meaning from Lamie, and moving, then, outward if\nnecessary. And they have opted instead for looking at\nunrelated statutes such as TILA, then going to the safe\nharbor, and then pulling the words \"violation\" and\n\"intentional\" out of the first prong, taking them out of\ncontext, taking them out of order, and then applying\nthem to this maxim, \"ignorance of the law.\" Even --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And also saying -- and\nthen this sentence is what I would like to have your\nresponse on, that there is no statute -- Federal statute\nthat makes mistake of law a defense. So this would be\nhighly extraordinary, and if that's what Congress meant\nto do, to make something that ordinarily is no defense a\ndefense, we would expect Congress to do so expressly.\nMR. COAKLEY: Justice Ginsburg, that is\ntheir argument, that it is unprecedented. But their\nunprecedented argument gets them nowhere. That is one\nof the panoply of arguments that is outside the plain\nmeaning that they go to to say well, this is\nunprecedented; Congress couldn't have intended this.\nThere are reports that read the TILA bona\nfide error to mean legal error at one point in time, so\nit wasn't unprecedented to the extent of that, and what\ndid Congress do with respect to TILA? In 1980, they\ndidn't like the interpretation that they were getting\nwith respect to legal error from the TILA error, which\nis a totally different statute, and so they reacted by\namending TILA to say no legal error in TILA.\nThey did not correspondingly amend the\nFDCPA, which shows Congress's intent to distinguish the\ntwo statutes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you think before our\nHeintz decision, that they intended for debt collectors\nto have an automatic defense if they just called up a\nlawyer? And so a lawyer's opinion would give them\nabsolute immunity from liability?\nMR. COAKLEY: Absolutely not, Justice\nSotomayor. This --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, I think part of the\ndifficulty in this case, isn't it, is the -- is our\nHeintz decision which made lawyers debt collectors, and\nso now we are in this quandary about a lawyer's good\nfaith. But -- but if we start with what was understood\nat the time, do you think that this language was\nintended to give debt collectors immunity by simply\ncalling a lawyer?\nMR. COAKLEY: Well -- it was absolutely\nmeant to protect debt collectors, however, that term was\ndefined in 1977, which included lay debt collectors. In\n1986 it went up a level when we added lawyers, and the\nexemption went out and in 1995 it went up another level\nwhen we added litigating lawyers.\nBut most certainly it went back to 1977 and\nincluded lay debt collectors, and lay debt collectors\ndidn't get a \"get out of jail free\" card here by just\npulling up the bona fide error defense and saying I'm\ndone. They are subject to the three rigors of the bona\nfide error defense. They have to prove that the\nviolation was not intentional -- that the violation --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Call a lawyer.\nMR. COAKLEY: Pardon?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Call a lawyer.\nMR. COAKLEY: How --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just have a lawyer sign\noff.\nMR. COAKLEY: No, but --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Even if the lawyer made\na mistake, if the debt collector relies, you know, I\nhave a reputable law firm, they are well educated, they\ntell me they do legal research, that -- I can assume\nthat, so why don't I have a \"get out of jail\" card?\nMR. COAKLEY: The unfairness of this\nstatute, as Justice Breyer indicated in his commentary\nwith Mr. Russell, is -- is exemplified by your question.\nIf a lay debt collector calls a lawyer in the 1977 to\n1986 round and asks a lawyer for an interpretation of\nthis act, and he base -- he relies upon that and acts\naccordingly, per their interpretation only applying to\nclerical error, that lay debt collector who relied upon\nadvice of counsel is out of luck if the decision goes\nagainst the lay debt collector, because he or she has no\nerror of law as a defense. So it goes up, the levels of\nunfairness go up as the time goes on.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's true of antitrust\ndefendants, too.\nMR. COAKLEY: But in this, Your Honor, there\nis a -- there is a bona fide error defense that has been\ncrafted into this statute.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I see that. Is it --\nis it -- what do you think of the idea that your\nopponent here has suggested that the way to deal with\nthe lawyer's problem that I mentioned is simply read the\nsubstantive provisions, so that there is no violation\nfor ordinary legal activity where they have gone and\nasked the FTC or you know, all the things that are\nagainst them? What you would have to do.\nThat isn't so hard to do as I first thought,\nbecause the words that seem to make -- the primary words\nof what is outlawed are the words \"unfair or\nunconscionable means.\" Now I -- I doubt -- you would\nknow -- I doubt that there are other words in the\nstatute that forbid lawyers from doing anything that\nreally shouldn't be forbidden. I mean, they shouldn't\ncall people up in the middle of the night and harass\nthem and so forth.\nBut -- but you could read unfair and\nunconscionable means to say that where a lawyer is\nreally hit by surprise, you know, all the circuits were\nagainst him, the FTC wouldn't give him an opinion, that\nhe no longer is acting unfairly and unconscionably.\nWhat about that?\nMR. COAKLEY: Justice Breyer, I don't think\nthat gives credence to the 1977 focus when lawyers were\nnot part of the statute. Certainly your example\nheightens the unfairness of it once lawyers come in in\n1995 through Heintz as a litigating lawyer. Certainly a\nlawyer has -- it creates this irreconcilable conflict of\ninterest that you alluded to in your discussion with Mr.\nRussell. That puts the lawyer between the proverbial\nrock and a hard place. He either -- he or she either\nchooses to follow the law and risk --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's right. I was seeing\na special problem with lawyers. Call -- the unfairness\nproblem that you are talking about, call that the\nantitrust problem, because it is just as much. But I\nsaw the special problem of putting the lawyer in the\nimpossible situation that you've just described.\nNow it's with respect to that problem that\nhe offers the cure of reading the words \"unconscionable\"\nand what is it? \"Unconscionable and unfair means.\"\nRead those words to exempt the lawyer when he's in the\ndilemma I discussed, and therefore the lawyer will not\nhave an incentive to -- to skew his advice.\nMR. COAKLEY: I believe that the lawyer\nwould be just subject to the rigors of the bona fide\nerror defense, the way any other debt collector as\ndefined from 1977 forward would be.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose it would\nmake interpretation of the act a little more difficult.\nThe same practice would be unconscionable in -- not\nunconscionable in one circumstance, you would have an\nopinion saying this is not unconscionable; but yet if\nsomebody else does it, you know, two weeks later, that\ndoesn't have the same -- he says, well, look, it's not\nunconscionable, but it turns out it is, in his case.\nAnd it would have to be -- the opinion would\nhave to clarify the law by saying, this is normally\nunconscionable but we are going to say it's not here\nbecause of this activity that is unlikely to happen.\nMR. COAKLEY: Mr. Chief Justice, I believe\nthis would be part of the inquiry that a lawyer would be\nfaced in trying to prove the affirmative defense of bona\nfide error in a legal situation, and that -- that would\nbe part of the good faith analysis, part of the\nreasonable procedures that he would present to the\ncourt --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Could we do that in the\ncontext of this case? Because we are talking on a\nhighly abstract level. This is a statute that required\na validation notice, and for the most part the\nvalidation notice that was sent to the debtor is exactly\nthe words of the statute.\nBut the lawyer added two words that are not\nin this statute, \"in writing.\" Where did that come\nfrom? We are told this was not the model form that was\nused by the debt collectors' association.\nMR. COAKLEY: There was a case, Graziano,\nYour Honor, that talked about the -- was construing the\nstatute and specifically section 1692g(a)(3) and\ndetermining because g -- the second and third prong of\nthe statute had the words in writing, does the first\nprong in order to be coherently read remain \"in\nwriting\"? Graziano says yes, you should put \"in writing\nin order\" to make a coherent --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It says you \"should\" --\nMR. COAKLEY: \"Should.\"\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Rather than \"may\"?\nMR. COAKLEY: No. Well Graziano suggested\n\"in writing\" is the only effective way to construe this\nstatute; otherwise, it makes no sense.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That issue is still\nnot settled, is it?\nMR. COAKLEY: That's correct, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We still don't know\nif the lawyer here was right or wrong.\nMR. COAKLEY: That's correct. And that\nactually points out a -- the unfairness of this whole\nsituation. Because my clients, respondents tomorrow\ncould be sued in the Southern District of Ohio by\nsomebody for -- because they took the words \"in writing\"\nout of their validation notice. Immediately upon being\nsued in this case, they could be sued in the Southern\nDistrict of Ohio for not following -- or not following\nGraziano, because somebody would conclude that that was\nthe more effective way -- reading of that statute, and\nif they are wrong, then the lawyer has no bona fide\nerror --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Coakley, one of your\nearlier statements confused me. You relied upon the\nfact that TILA was amended in 1980 to provide that legal\nerrors are not covered by the TILA defense, and I think\nyou -- I think you describe that as -- as changing the\nlaw to -- to provide that -- that legal errors were not\ncovered.\nBut as I understood the situation, every\ncourt of appeals to have construed TILA prior to 1980\nhad held that legal errors were not -- were not\nincluded, as -- as your opponent says, they are not\nincluded here. So the amendment to TILA was just an\naffirmation of the judicial interpretation of the\nlanguage similar to the language here.\nMR. COAKLEY: Justice Scalia, there were\ncases, although not court of appeals cases that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Every court of appeals to\nconstrue it had held that mistakes of law were not\ncovered. Is that accurate or not?\nMR. COAKLEY: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then -- then your\nprior statement was very misleading.\nMR. COAKLEY: Well, to the extent that there\nwere two different -- two different analyses or\ninterpretations that had emerged before 1980 that led\nthe Congress to -- in 1980, enact or to amend TILA,\notherwise, as pointed out in the Herrera case in our\nbrief, if everything was so settled in 1980, why would\nthere be a need to clarify the definition of bona fide\nerror under TILA, and -- and if it was clarified in 1980\nunder the FDCPA, then why didn't they take the step and\nclarify it in the FDCPA from 1980 to 2010, especially\nwhen Congress --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There is no basis for\nsaying that the amendment was overturning -- changing\nthe prior meaning of TILA. There is no basis for saying\nthat. All you had were just a few district court\nopinions, and all the courts of appeals have come out\nthe other way.\nMR. COAKLEY: Your Honor, the -- the\nPetitioner's position was that the case law was uniform\nat the time, and our position is the case law was not\nuniform at the time. There were cases that had taken an\nopposite approach to the court of appeals decision on --\non TILA, and that is what led to Congress reacting in\n1980 to specifically exclude legal error from the TILA\ndefense and has -- Congress has --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But why doesn't that just\nmean that Congress wants to confirm that the judges --\nthe majority of judges who -- who had held that it\ndidn't -- that errors of law were not a defense, that\nthey were right, it's not changing -- changing anything.\nIt's just confirming that the majority view is right.\nMR. COAKLEY: Well, Justice Ginsburg, the\ncase law says that the law has to be settled, and as we\npointed out in our brief, it was not settled, and the\ncourts, afterwards, have reflected that there was no\nsettlement, and that that's one of the reasons why the\nerror portion of the TILA bona fide error was -- was\nclarified, as the Petitioner puts it, to say this\nexcludes any interpretations of legal -- of legal -- of\nthe legal interpretations of TILA.\nAnd then there was no -- whether you call it\na clarification, whether you call it a ratification,\nwhether you call it an amendment, it doesn't matter,\nCongress didn't then similarly amend the FDCPA to be\nconsistent with their --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, why wouldn't one\nsay, now, Congress has confirmed that the word in the\nTruth and Lending Act means thus and so, Congress has\nsaid that's what those words mean, and then go back to\nthe other statutes and say the same language was used,\nso it means the same thing, the same thing that Congress\nhas just confirmed?\nMR. COAKLEY: Justice Ginsburg, I believe\nthat the -- the words \"bona fide error\" in the TILA\nstatute were being construed, although not by courts of\nappeals, to reasonably read the bona fide error\nencompasses legal error.\nThere was a change -- change -- a\nclarification, whatever, in 1980, to specifically say,\nbona fide error does not include legal interpretations\nof TILA, and that was then never clarified, ratified, or\nwhatever, nothing was done to the FDCPA at that time,\nand -- and the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Were there any district\ncourt decisions, of any kind, reading bona fide errors\nto mean legal mistakes under any of the other statutes?\nMR. COAKLEY: I --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The ones that were not\nchanged, the ones that Justice Ginsburg is -- is\ndescribing.\nMR. COAKLEY: Well, under the TILA, there\nwere -- there were --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Under TILA, that's why\nCongress may or may not have acted --\nMR. COAKLEY: Okay. But --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm talking about under\nthis statute, under any other statute that uses similar\nlanguage.\nMR. COAKLEY: Yes --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Were there any district\ncourt cases that were reading those statutes to include\nmistakes of law?\nMR. COAKLEY: Well, in this case that we are\nhere on, Judge Gaughan from the U.S. District Court of\nthe Northern District of Ohio read the -- read that\nTILA --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that was after the\nTILA amendment?\nMR. COAKLEY: That was after the amendment.\nNow, you're talking about before 1980?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I was talking about the\ntime that Congress was look at amending the statutes.\nMR. COAKLEY: Under the -- well, the FDCPA\ncame into effect in 1977, and the -- TILA was in 1968.\nYou are asking between '68 and '77? The were -- the\nWellmaker case did -- did construe the statute to\ninclude legal error.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you think that a -- a\nmistake of law has to be substantively reasonable in\norder to fall within this defense, and if so, where do\nyou get that? Where do you find that in the statute?\nMR. COAKLEY: The statute doesn't refer to\nsubstantively or procedurally, Justice Alito, the\nstatute refers to bona fide error and the maintenance of\nprocedures reasonably adapted. As a -- as a -- as\neither a lay debt collector or as a lawyer debt\ncollector, they must establish good faith in attempting\nto comply with the law as it existed at the time.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose that a lawyer\nspends a whole week researching a question, but arrives\nat a conclusion that is plainly incorrect, does not,\ntherefore, intend to violate the statute and proceeds in\ngood faith. Would that -- how would that work out?\nMR. COAKLEY: Well, in proving --\nJUSTICE ALITO: It would be an unreasonable\ndecision, and yet, would it -- it would fall within your\nunderstanding of this provision; is that correct?\nMR. COAKLEY: Absolutely. I mean, he\nwould -- he would have -- that lawyer would have to meet\nthe three prongs of the affirmative defense by a\npreponderance of the evidence. If he doesn't prove all\nof the prongs, he's out. If he proves all of the\nprongs, he's in, and if he creates an issue of fact on\none of the three prongs, than he's going back to the\ndistrict court for a fact-finding analysis, which turns\nout to be the -- you know, this statute has not proved\nto be unworkable.\nAnd if I could follow up to Justice Scalia's\nand Justice Ginsburg's query about the -- the -- and\nJustice Sotomayor's -- about the interpretation of the\nwords \"TILA\" versus \"FDCPA,\" I think a review of the\ncases of the Seventh and Tenth Circuits is instructive\nbecause the Seventh Circuit was one of the circuits\nthat, under TILA, had -- had interpreted the word to\nmean clerical error only. The Tenth Circuit -- and the\ntenth circuit as well.\nNow, today, under interpreting the FDCPA\nbona fide error, they have abrogated that meaning in\nTILA and have come around to this means legal error\nunder the FDCPA.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Could you answer one\nquestion -- I'm just a little confused about. One\nstatute has the defense in expressly. The other\ndoesn't. Is there a difference in the likelihood of\nunfairness under the two statutes? Why -- is there a\nreason why Congress would have wanted to provide a\nmistake of law defense under TILA and not in this --\nthis -- in this case? Why would it treat them\ndifferently?\nMR. COAKLEY: There -- there are\ndifferences -- substantial differences, Justice Stevens,\nin the TILA and in the FDCPA statute, starting with the\npurposes of the statute, starting with the construction\nof the statute, one, TILA has a criminal liability, TILA\nhas life lines that the debt collector doesn't have in\nthe FDCPA, TILA dealing -- is dealing with disclosure of\nfinancial information, TILA has regulations, as opposed\nto no regulations --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I would think all -- which\nway do these cut? I mean, the fact that there is\ncriminal liability under TILA would seem to me to cut in\nprecisely the opposite direction. You would want to\nprovide excuses of bona fide errors of law, I would\nthink. Why -- am I missing something here?\nMR. COAKLEY: The -- no, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I would think --\nMR. COAKLEY: It's a -- it's a distinction\nbetween why -- in trying to answer Justice Stevens'\nquestion, it's a distinction why TILA would be\ninterpreted differently by the -- than the FDCPA.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the question is -- is\nthere a greater need for the mistake of law defense\nunder one statute, rather than the other, I sort of --\nMR. COAKLEY: Given --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- have the same problem\nJustice Scalia expressed.\nMR. COAKLEY: Given -- well, given the\npurpose of TILA, and TILA dealing with computational\nerrors, regulation C, Truth in Lending, they -- they\namend -- they amended TILA -- I mean, I'm sorry.\nOriginally TILA didn't have a bona fide error and then\nthey amended it so as to -- before it was enacted -- so\nas to cover this area to provide for the computational\nerror. Because it's so fraught with mathematical errors\nand the like.\nThat is not the situation in the FDCPA. And\nthat is precisely the reasoning that is the Seventh and\nTenth Circuit have noted, and the case of Frye that we\nhave cited in our brief has noted, as the distinction\nbetween these two statutes, and why one could be\ninterpreted this way and the FDCPA could be reasonably\ninterpreted the other way.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So I mean, you're --\nthe substance of your answer is that they are just two\nvery different statutes.\nMR. COAKLEY: Absolutely.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I -- but I share\nJustice Scalia's concern, I mean the -- the ways in\nwhich they are different would suggest you need the\nlegal mistake defense more in TILA than you do in the\nFDCPA.\nMR. COAKLEY: Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I\ndon't believe that that is consistent with the purpose\nof -- of TILA. And certainly lawyers are not -- lawyers\nare not creditors under TILA. And -- so that's a\ndistinction between the -- the two statutes. And\nfurther, the -- there is an administrative penalty under\nthe FDCPA that -- the $16,000 a day, but the bona fide\nerror does not apply to that. So there is no\ninconsistency between the administrative penalties under\nthe FDCPA and the civil penalties under the FDCPA.\nAnd in -- and in truth, the -- the statutes\nare -- are significantly different.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I was wondering if you\nknow, can you give me just a rough idea, of the\npercentage of instances in which people write to the FTC\nto take advantage of the safe harbor and the FTC just\nsays, \"Well, we won't tell you.\"\nMR. COAKLEY: I do not have that empirical\nevidence, Your Honor. I do know that the briefs are\nconsistent on this point, and as admitted to by the\nPetitioners, there have been four advisory opinions from\nthe FDCPA -- from the FTC in 30 years.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How many have asked?\nMR. COAKLEY: I don't know how many have\nasked.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, it seems to me\nthat's the obvious solution to the problem, that --\nuntil you hold they are not -- they are liable for\nmistake of law, but anyone can write to the FTC ahead of\ntime and -- and get a safe harbor.\nIt's -- so I don't know what we could do to\nsuggest maybe that mechanism, which is built into the\nstatute, should be used.\nMR. COAKLEY: I think that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Didn't Mr. Jay tell us\nthere were seven requests? Are you disputing that?\nMR. COAKLEY: I am not disputing that,\nJustice Ginsburg. What I am basically saying is it\nreally doesn't make any difference, because the truth\nwith respect to the FTC and the safe harbor defense and\nthe FDCPA, that Mr. Jay does not argue that one is\nsuperfluous to the other; the Petitioner argues that one\nmakes the other superfluous -- neither are superfluous\nto the other.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, all right. But I\nmean, if there have been seven requests and four answers\nthen all these horrible things that are going to happen\nif you do say there is -- unless you have mistake of law\ndefense, aren't going to happen. Because all that has\nto happen is that people write to the FTC and they get\nan answer.\nMR. COAKLEY: But the safe harbor defense on\nits face applies prospectively. The FDCPA bona fide\nerror defense --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That means lawyer, if you\nare worried about this, go write before you do it.\nMR. COAKLEY: Yes, but the bona fide error\ndefense applies retrospectively.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I see I have a copy\nin the retail -- Association of Retail Collection\nTrades. The first -- second sentence in the FTC's\nresponse is I apologize for the delay in responding to\nyour request.\nMR. COAKLEY: I --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It is not an\natypical issue in dealing with government agencies.\nMR. COAKLEY: And -- yes, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand the penultimate paragraph in there: For the\nforegoing reasons your request for advisory opinion does\nnot satisfy either the prerequisites described, well --\nand accordingly we can't -- grant it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Coakley, why do you\nneed a safe harbor if there is no store? I mean what is\nthe purpose of -- of having this procedure, however\ninefficient it may be, what is the purpose of having it\nunless you were going to be liable if you make a mistake\nof law?\nMR. COAKLEY: The safe harbor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You are talking about a\nsafe harbor rule. Leave the harbor.\nMR. COAKLEY: Justice Scalia, as it worked\nout the safe harbor is neither safe nor a harbor, but\nthat's not the perspective that we have to look at it.\nWe have to look at it from 1997, it was for a\nprospective course of conduct that gives the debt\ncollector categorical --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What does that have to do\n-- what does that have to do with anything, whether it's\nprospective or not? The point is what benefit does it\ngive to the person who is asking? If the person is not\ngoing to be liable for a bona fide mistake, why would he\never use it?\nMR. COAKLEY: Well, there are reasons why a\ndebt collector may use it if he has time and he needs\nthe prospective letter from the FTC. In -- in reality\ndebt collector's going to go to the bona fide error\nbecause it's retrospective, although there is risk with\nthe bona fide error, because it's not the categorical\nimmunity that the safe harbor gives. And there's --\nthey're not inconsistent.\nThe safe harbor is not a --a statutory\ninterpretation why you should drive a meaning into the\nbona fide error provision that is not apparent on its\nface.\nI would say in closing that Justice Breyer,\nyour -- your comments earlier are just right. This is\nworse -- a reading, the safe harbor, reading the bona\nfide error provision to exclude legal error is worse\nthan unfair.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, now I do see -- which\nis why I asked the question, I asked to get an answer,\nand the answer now seems to be floating around the FTC\nidea. It's -- seven letters, that isn't very much. I\njust wonder if the -- if the bar in this area, and their\nclients, if they made an effort, might be able to get\nthe financing for the FTC so they could have enough\npeople to respond quickly to the letter.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. COAKLEY: Justice Ginsburg asked the\nquestion about unprecedented. In -- in truth, what\nwould really be unprecedented here would be for this\nCourt to construe the bona fide error defense so that a\nlawyer or a debt collector who is giving advice to his\nclient to follow a particular way of action, and the law\nwas unsettled, for that lawyer to be subject to -- to be\npunished for personal liability. And we think that the\nbona fide error clearly under Lamie encompasses --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There are severe limits on\nthe liability, aren't there? Isn't there a thousand --\nisn't it a $1,000 limit?\nMR. COAKLEY: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's not big bucks for an\nattorney, is it?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. COAKLEY: But let that -- well, maybe\nfor the prior group that was up here, but I don't --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. COAKLEY: It's big in Cleveland.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This isn't -- this is a\nclass action, wasn't it? It was brought as a class\naction?\nMR. COAKLEY: This is definitely a class\naction. This is a class action that wants all of the\nvalidation notices that were sent out by this law firm\nto -- that included the words \"in writing\" in it for\nthat period, and further than that, they wanted the\nfinancial information from the law firm, the financials\nbecause, under the class action provision, it's $500,000\nor 1% of the net worth of the firm, which is ever less.\nSo the request was made of my client, give\nme the financials of your law firm, and for some reason,\nmy client did, but this -- the statute was not meant to\npunish lay debt collectors, including lawyers.\nThe bona fide error defense is the shield,\nand we ask the court to affirm the judgment of the Sixth\nCircuit Court of Appeals.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
