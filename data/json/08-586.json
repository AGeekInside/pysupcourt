        "content": "(10:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument first this morning in Case 08-586, Jones v.\nHarris Associates.\nMr. Frederick.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. FREDERICK: Thank you,\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nIn 1970, Congress amended the Investment\nCompany Act to provide a cause of action when an\ninvestment adviser breaches its fiduciary duty with\nrespect to compensation.\nThe Seventh Circuit upheld summary judgment\nfor Respondent under a legal standard for fiduciary duty\nthat Respondent here no longer defends.\nFor three reasons, the Seventh Circuit's\njudgment should be reversed. First, under the Court's\nlongstanding precedent, in this context a fiduciary duty\nrequires a fair fee, achieved through full disclosure\nand good-faith negotiation.\nSecond, the best gauge of a fair fee is what\nthe investment adviser charges at arm's-length in other\ntransactions for similar services.\nAnd, third, applying that standard here,\nHarris charged twice as much in percentage terms for\nproviding virtually identical advisory services in\narm's-length transactions with institutional investors.\nWith respect to the first point, the\nstandard for fiduciary duty has been clear from this\nCourt's cases, at least since Pepper v. Litton, in which\nthe Court said that a fair result in the\ncircumstances -- a fair fee -- was an important\ncomponent of a fiduciary duty.\nCongress was aware of that standard when it\nenacted the 1970 amendments to the Investment Company\nAct. The SEC brought the case to the Congress'\nattention, and that standard, we submit, is one that\nCongress intended to incorporate.\nApplying that standard, where Pepper said\nthat the best gauge of a fair fee is what the person --\nthe fiduciary charges in arm's-length transactions,\napplied here, the best way to understand how that\nfiduciary duty is being breached in this context is what\nHarris is charging for same or similar services at\narm's-length to institutional investors.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is Harris a fiduciary in\nthe same sense as a corporate officer and a corporate\ndirector? Or does his fiduciary duty differ? Is it\nhigher or lower, same with a guardian, same with a\ntrustee?\nI mean, the word \"fiduciary\" -- does\nfiduciary imply different standards, depending on what\nkind of fiduciary you are?\nMR. FREDERICK: The basic concept,\nJustice Kennedy, is the same. There are two components,\nwhere there must be full disclosure of information and a\nfair result, and that fair result translates in\ndifferent contexts in different ways. Here, because of\nthe statutory references to fiduciary duty with respect\nto compensation, one focuses on the fairness of the fee\ncharged.\nBut, as Professor Dumont points out in her\namicus brief, the idea of a fiduciary duty is one that\nis well known in various circumstances of the law, and\nas applied here the concept goes to the fairness of the\nfee.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, would the test for\ncompensation in this case be the same as any director or\nany officer of a corporation?\nMR. FREDERICK: The difference here, Justice\nKennedy, is that in those circumstances the indicia of\nan arm's-length transaction may be achieved. The\ndirectors can fire the head of a company. They can call\nfor changes.\nHere, the investment adviser has appointed\nthe members of the board. As this Court said in the\nDaily Income Fund case, the earmarks of an -- of an\narm's-length transaction are absent precisely because --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I just want to know, is\nthe fiduciary duties the same? Is the fiduciary\nstandard the same, without getting into how its applied?\nIs the fiduciary standard the same for\nJones, for a guardian, for a trustee, for a corporate\nofficer or a corporate director, always the same?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes. The concept is fair\nresult through full information and good-faith\nnegotiations.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And for lawyers?\nMR. FREDERICK: For lawyers --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Lawyers have a fiduciary\nobligation to their clients; right?\nMR. FREDERICK: That is true.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So courts should review\nlawyers' fees for -- on the basis of whether it's a fair\nresult.\nMR. FREDERICK: That is how courts do it\nevery day in this country, Justice Scalia, when they are\nasked to make fee applications for reasonableness.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but this is\ndifferent. I mean, this is part of an expense of a\nfund. They don't get fees, but -- but they get -- they\nhave to pay for the lawyers, just like they have to pay\nfor management advice.\nSo why wouldn't you review the lawyers' fees\nto make sure they are fair?\nMR. FREDERICK: The lawyers' fees in which\ncontext, Mr. Chief Justice? I'm not sure I understand\nthe question.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel for the\nfund.\nMR. FREDERICK: Counsel for the fund is --\nthat is actually not at issue here, but the issue of\nwhat constitutes reasonable expenses may arise in\nvarious circumstances.\nThe statute prohibits fees that are\nunreasonable in terms of their unfairness to the fund.\nThe concept here is that the board cannot fire the\ninvestment adviser. So in evaluating the fairness of\nthe fee the adviser is charging the fund, the normal\nindicia of an arm's-length transaction is absent, and\nthat is the key principle here because this adviser is\nusing the same manager to provide the same research\nanalytics from the same research group, from the same\nmeetings, buying the same stocks, and simply allocating\nthem to different accounts and charging those to whom it\nowes a fiduciary duty twice what it is getting at\narm's-length.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there was in this\nrecord, was there not, a submission by the adviser\ncomparing what mutual funds this fund was charged, what\ninstitutional funds were charged, but explaining the\ndifferential in terms of the services provided, that\nmore services were provided to the fund and less\nservices were provided to the institutional investors.\nMR. FREDERICK: And, Justice Ginsburg, that\nis where there is a disputed issue of fact for which\nsummary judgment is not appropriate, because the\nplaintiffs submitted evidence that in fact the services\nprovided to the institutional investors were greater,\neven though they were being charged a lower amount of\nmoney.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Who would have the\nburden? You said that is an issue that has not been\ndecided, it's a disputed issue of fact, appropriate for\nremand. Who -- would you have the burden if they came\nforward and said, look, this is what our situation is.\nThese are the services. Would you have the burden to\nshow that in fact they were comparable and the\ndifferences did not warrant the differences in the fee?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You would have the\nburden?\nMR. FREDERICK: We have the burden.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's different from\nnormal trust law, isn't it?\nMR. FREDERICK: It is.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Normally where you are a\nfiduciary, it's up to you to prove that it was\nreasonable.\nMR. FREDERICK: That's true.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So Congress evidently did\nnot mean ordinary trust law to apply in this context.\nMR. FREDERICK: We disagree with that last\npart, Justice Scalia. We agree that Congress did make\nmodifications to the way a cause of action ordinarily\nwould have been brought at common law for breach of\nfiduciary duty in several respects, including imposing\nthe burden of proof on the investor. Where we disagree\nis that when they used the phrase \"fiduciary duty\" they\nintended to mean something less than what fiduciary duty\nhad meant at common law.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if -- if you\nare having courts decide -- review what is fair, a fair\nfee, what if the adviser had given such good advice that\nthe fund beat the industry average for his category of\nfund by 5 percent over the last 5 years. Does he get\ndouble the normal compensation of the average fees?\nDoes he get triple? 50 percent more? How is the court\nsupposed to decide that?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, there is an issue of\nfact as to how relevant performance is. They didn't\ngive the money back when their performance lagged behind\nthe market, Mr. Chief Justice, in this case. So the\nquestion of whether or not a performance metric is\nrelevant is certainly a factor that will be entitled to\nless --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, surely you\nthink it is. When you say they don't give the money\nback, you are not suggesting that the amount of the fees\nshould be the same regardless of whether they outperform\nby 10 percent or not?\nMR. FREDERICK: My point, Mr. Chief Justice,\nis that when they charge the same amount, buying the\nsame stocks, to institutional investors and achieve the\nsame performance, there is no reason why the mutual fund\nshould be charged twice as much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but there is\ndifferent parameters, right, in the sense that you're\ntrying -- the company is trying to attract investors to\nthe mutual fund. If you are advising a pension fund, it\nis not the case that they are trying to attract\npensioners who have other choices.\nMR. FREDERICK: But the investor doesn't\ngain because of the marketing skill of the adviser.\nSimply having a larger asset pool which increases the\nfee that the adviser can charge doesn't inure to the\nindividual benefit of the investor. And the point of\nthis statute was to provide protection against investors\nso that when the adviser charged excessive fees that\nexcess would be returned to the fund for the pro\nrata benefit --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You said that Congress\nused \"fiduciary\" in a special sense. Then -- then, I\nhave to conclude that your earlier answer is confusing\nfor me, because I thought you were going to tell us that\nthis investment adviser has the same fiduciary standard\nthat officers and directors of corporations have. Then\nyou say that Congress used it in this special sense. So\nthat doesn't quite square.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, Justice Kennedy, let\nme just add the extra words of the statute, because what\nCongress said was a fiduciary duty \"with respect to\ncompensation.\" And so when I say special sense, I mean\nthat Congress used additional words to elaborate on the\ncircumstance in which the fiduciary duty would be\nexamined.\nHere what is happening is that an\narm's-length transaction for the same services -- the\nsame manager is going out and touting his services to\nthe institutional investor, but simply charging them\nhalf as much money for providing the same portfolio of\nmanagement.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do technological\nchanges make a difference in terms of disclosures\nrequired? These days all you have to do is push a\nbutton and you find out exactly what the management fees\nare. I mean, you just look it up on Morningstar and\nit's right there and you can make -- as an investor you\ncan make whatever determination you'd like, including to\ntake your money out.\nMR. FREDERICK: The fact that an investor\nmay know going in what the fee is does not address the\nproblem Congress was intending to address, which is that\nas larger and larger sums of assets were accreted to the\nmutual fund, the investor was not obtaining the benefits\nof economies of scale. And that's the central point --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we could look\nat -- you know, as the fund grows bigger and he doesn't\nget those benefits he can go look at another fund. It\ntakes 30 seconds.\nMR. FREDERICK: And that again doesn't\naddress the problem Congress was trying to get at, which\nis to protect the company, not the individual investor.\nThe individual investor might lessen the damages that\nthat investor suffers, but the fund, the people\nremaining, continue to pay excessive fees.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, but he protects the\ncompany ultimately, because when investors leave the\ncompany that is charging excessive fees to go to other\ncompanies, the company that they are leaving sees that\nsomething's wrong and has to lower its compensation to\nits adviser. Why doesn't that affect the company at\nissue?\nMR. FREDERICK: A large number of assets\nunder management in mutual funds, something like 26 to\n35 percent according to materials that are in the\nrecord, are from 401(k) plans, where the investor is\nessentially locked into the fund that his or her company\nchooses to make that investment. And even as to\ninvestors who are not locked in, there are significant\ntax consequences where over time an investor might be in\nthe Oakmark Fund and have to suffer large tax\nconsequences in order to get the benefit of the\nstatute --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Companies --\ncompanies change who they invest with under the 401(k)'s\nall the time. The employees are not happy with the\nreturn they are getting because the company has limited\ntheir choices, they change. It happens all the time.\nMR. FREDERICK: And Mr. Chief Justice, as\nthe Court recognized in the Daily Income Fund case, this\nis a unique cause of action in which Congress was\nintending to protect the entire corpus of the investors\nin the fund, because --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You told me just a\nlittle while ago, or told somebody, Congress wasn't\ninterested in protecting investors; they were interested\nin protecting the companies.\nMR. FREDERICK: The company is comprised of\nthe investors, Mr. Chief Justice. What the right of\naction does not do is to provide individual damages to\nthe investor who brings the suit. The recovery inures\nto the entire benefit of all the investors.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, can I unpackage\nyour argument a little bit. Because using the word\n\"fair fee\" in my mind is meaningless, because it has to\nbe fair in relationship to something. And so what is\nyour definition of what that something is that it's fair\nto, and -- or unfair against? And start from there,\nbecause I understood the Seventh Circuit to be saying:\nLook, a fair fee is paying market value. If one takes a\nsort of reading -- whatever negotiation goes on between\nthe two, as long as there has been full disclosure as\nrequired, that's the market. So that's fair. You're\nsaying it's something else. What's that something else?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, what the Court said in\npepper is that fair is what is reflective of what an\narm's-length agreement would produce.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So you start\nthere.\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So let's\nstop confusing this -- the articulation of the standard,\nwhich is -- that's fair. What would an arm's-length\ntransaction produce? And let's go to what seems to be\npart of your argument and sort of what everyone's\nskirting around, which is what's the proof that a\nparticular transaction is not arm's-length?\nThe Seventh Circuit appeared to be saying,\nit's arm's-length when the parties have done all of the\ndisclosure that is required, because then the buyer can\ndecide whether they want to pay that fee or not, and\nonce they choose to it's a fair price. It's an arm's-\nlength transaction. You are saying not, and that's\nwhat -- that's where I am trying to get to the nub of\nwhy not? Why is --\nMR. FREDERICK: Because the directors can't\nfire and walk away from the advisor. In any arm's-\nlength transaction, if I sell you a car and you don't\nlike the price can you walk away.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's -- now, that's\nbegging the question, because Congress hasn't said a\nreasonable fee. It did say fiduciary duty, but it\ndidn't -- there is a subtle but very important\ndifference between reasonable and -- a reasonable fee\nand a fiduciary duty with respect to fees.\nMR. FREDERICK: True. There are two\ncomponents: Was there full information and good faith\nnegotiating; and was the result fair. In Pepper, the\nCourt said if the result is not fair there can be a\nbreach of fiduciary duty.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm still begging the\nquestion, fair against what.\nMR. FREDERICK: Fair against what the\nadviser actually charged for same or similar services to\nan outsider who had the right to walk away.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Frederick, I don't\nunderstand your statement that they can't fire the\ninvestment adviser. Maybe they can't fire him, but they\ncan insist that he accept a lower fee, right? Surely\nthey can do that, can't they?\nMR. FREDERICK: They --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can they insist that he\naccept a lower fee? Can they do that.\nMR. FREDERICK: In practical terms, no.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why?\nMR. FREDERICK: Because the adviser picks\nthe board of directors.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, no, that's something\ndifferent. Let's assume you have a disinterested board\nof directors, which is what the statute requires. You\ntell me even though they are disinterested, they can't\nfire the adviser. It seems to me, while they can't fire\nhim, they can say: We are going to cut your fee in\nhalf. Whereupon they don't have to fire him. He will\npack up and leave, and they will get a new adviser.\nDoesn't that work?\nMR. FREDERICK: There is actually no\nevidence in any record I am aware of where that has\nactually happened. The directors have no leverage. And\nthat's the problem the Court -- this Court recognized in\nthe Daily Income Fund case.\nIf I could reserve the balance of my time,\nplease.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Gannon.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. GANNON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe fiduciary duty imposed by section 36(b)\nprohibits an investment adviser's fee from being outside\nthe range that arm's-length bargaining would produce.\nThe courts below erred by failing to consider evidence\nabout what the investment adviser in this case charges\nits unaffiliated clients when it provides services that\nPetitioners claim are, in fact, comparable to the\nservices at issue here.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think Congress used\nthe term \"fiduciary\" in a very special sense here? I\nwill just tell you the problem I'm having with the case.\nIf I look at a standard that the fees must be reasonable\nand I compare that with what a fiduciary would do, I\nthought a fiduciary has the highest possible duty. But\napparently the submission is the fiduciary has a lower\nduty, a lesser duty than to charge a reasonable fee. I\njust find that quite a puzzling use of the word\n\"fiduciary.\"\nNow, if Congress uses it as a term of art or\nin some special sense, fine.\nMR. GANNON: Well, we do think that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But it seems to me an odd\nuse of the term \"fiduciary.\" I don't know why Congress\ndidn't use some other word.\nMR. GANNON: Well, we do think that the term\n\"fiduciary duty\" is here used to counterbalance the lack\nof arm's-length bargaining that exists between the board\nof directors and the investment adviser, and we do think\nthat it drew upon the established term of art in\nPepper v. Litton, the case that counsel for Petitioners\nwas already referring to. That's a case that actually\ninvolved corporate directors and there the same test,\nthe same ultimate standard, was stated, which is whether\nthe bargain carries the earmarks of an arm's length\nbargain and whether it's inherently fair.\nAnd so we do think that in the development\nof the legislation in 1969, the memorandum that the SEC\nsubmitted to Congress in 1969 explained that the shift\nfrom reasonableness to fiduciary duty largely achieved\nsome procedural objectives of shifting the focus from\nthe board of directors to the investment adviser, and\nthe text of the statute specifically makes it a\nfiduciary duty with respect to receipt of compensation.\nWe think one salutary affect of that was to\n-- to make it clear that the Court's burden here, the\nCourt's duty here, wasn't just to establish what the\nsingle most reasonable fee would be, but harking back to\nthe Pepper v. Litton test, whether the bargain fell\nwithin the range of what arm's length bargaining\notherwise would have achieved.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if we are\ngoing to have regulation of what fees can be charged,\nyou cite in your brief the various regulations the SEC\nhas issued. It makes a lot more sense to have the SEC\nregulate rates than to have courts do it, doesn't it?\nMR. GANNON: Well, in the abstract, it might\nmake more sense, Mr. Chief Justice. I think the choice\nthat Congress made here was to counterbalance the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You are not\nsuggesting the SEC wouldn't have authority to do that,\nare you?\nMR. GANNON: Well, even under this statute,\nthe SEC has the authority to file suits under section\n36(b).\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Has it filed any?\nMR. GANNON: It hasn't filed any since --\nsince 1980, Justice Ginsburg. I think that the SEC in\nthis context -- it has -- it has primarily directed its\nresources and energies into encouraging there to be\nbetter disclosure of fees, both the disclosure of\ninformation to the board, disclosure to investors,\nbetter education to shareholders so that they would be\nable to go --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it must be aware of\nthe -- of the divergence between the fees that\ninvestment advisers charge to these companies and what\nthey charge to other clients. Isn't the SEC aware of\nthat?\nMR. GANNON: It is aware of that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And yet has brought no\nsuits against this industry?\nMR. GANNON: Since 1980 it hasn't used\nsection 36(b). It has used less formal mechanisms in\nthe context of examinations and investigators -- -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: For disclosure, just for\ndisclosure. But that suggests to me that the SEC may\nthink that this is indeed a self-contained industry and\nthat the comparison with investment advice given to\nother entities is -- is not a fair one.\nMR. GANNON: Well, when the SEC helped draft\nthe statute in the 1960s, it recognized that there was\nthis systematic disparity between the amounts that\nmutual funds were being charged by investment advisers\nand the amounts that investment advisers were charging\ntheir unaffiliated clients, and in the 1969 memorandum\nthat I referred to, which is reprinted in an appendix to\nthe amicus brief by John Bogel in its entirety, the SEC\nmentioned that comparison as being something that may\nwell be relevant in proving in an individual case that\nthat particular investment adviser's fees are excessive.\nAnd we think that the test here of whether\nunder all the circumstances, which is what section\n36(b)(2) points the Court towards, of having to weigh --\nhaving to weigh the board's approval of fees in light of\nall the circumstances, that those circumstances include\nthings like the evidence that petitioners have presented\nhere.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Gannon, the -- all\nthe circumstances, that comes from the Second Circuit's\nGartenberg case?\nMR. GANNON: Well, it also comes,\nJustice Ginsburg, from the text of section 36(b)(2).\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But in -- in that case,\nat least there was a footnote that seemed to say, you\ndon't have to engage in a -- in the comparison with what\ninstitutional investors are paid.\nMR. GANNON: The footnote that you are\ntalking about did point out that in that case the\ncomparison that the plaintiffs were attempting to draw\nbetween the money market fund at issue and a pension\nfund wasn't a particularly relevant one, because the\nservices at issue were so different. And here the\nparties appear to dispute how different the services\nare. And at the summary judgment stage, the Respondent\nstated that it disputed how comparable the relevant\nservices were.\nThe district court and the court of appeals\nconsidered that dispute immaterial because, instead of\ncomparing, instead of determining whether this\ninvestment adviser is selling the same services at half\nthe price to its unaffiliated clients who actually can\nengage in arm's length bargaining, those courts simply\nsaid that if it -- if it falls within the range that is\ncharged by other mutual funds, that would be acceptable.\nAnd we --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, the statute\ndoes not say, in considering the rates you look at all\nthe circumstances. Am I right? It says, in considering\nwhether to defer to the board, you look at all the\ncircumstances.\nMR. GANNON: It does say that you should\ngive the board --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The board.\nMR. GANNON: -- such consideration as is\ndeemed appropriate under all the circumstances. That's\ncorrect.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. But isn't\nthat different than saying, in looking at what the rates\nshould be or whether they are excessive, you look at all\nthe circumstances? It may well be that you don't defer\nto the board, but that doesn't mean it's a free-for-all\nin deciding what you do look at.\nMR. GANNON: Well, I think that it\ndemonstrates that the Court is obligated to look to all\nthe circumstances simply to determine whether the\nboard's approval -- how much weight it should be given.\nAnd as this Court explained in Daily Income\nFund, the entire point of section 36(b) is to provide an\nindependent check, the -- independent of the fact that\nthe directors approved the fees. We think that an\nappropriately informed board that asks the right\nquestions, that gets the right information and fully\nconsiders the sort of factors that are discussed --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Even if they agree to\npay double the price?\nMR. GANNON: We think that -- that the right\nprocess followed by the board would be probative, but\nsomething like double the price may -- may demonstrate\nthat that is an unfair bargain.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That -- that's what --\nare you advocating that there is a stand-alone cause of\naction or breach of duty when there isn't full\ndisclosure, even if the fee is within arm's length --\nnormal -- begging the question of what's normal, but\nassuming that it's within an arm's-length transaction\nrange in the market?\nMR. GANNON: If there was a lack of full\ndisclosure, that might in the abstract be a breach of\nfiduciary duty even under the Seventh Circuit's test.\nWe think that if it didn't actually have an effect on\nthe fees, then it wouldn't be actionable here because\nthere would be no actual damages flowing from the lack\nof disclosure.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But even if there is full\ndisclosure, your position is in every case a court must\ndecide whether the fee is reasonable or not.\nMR. GANNON: A court would need to decide\nwhether the plaintiff has met its burden of proving that\nit falls outside the range of fees that arm's-length\nbargaining would have arrived at, and that's a cause of\naction that would be --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, how much deviance,\nand what is the scope of the range?\nMR. GANNON: Well, I think that the term of\nart of \"fiduciary duty\" doesn't necessarily demonstrate\nhow much deviance away from the range there would be. I\nthink that depending upon the segment of the market the\nrange might be more or less narrow.\nIn segments of the market where services are\nmore commodified and standardized, perhaps with index\nfunds, there might be a much narrower range of fees that\nare arrived at through arm's-length bargaining, and even\n-- and smaller disparities might be inappropriate there.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: How is the -- how is the\nstandard you've just described different from a standard\nof reasonableness?\nMR. GANNON: It -- I think that the chief\nway it differs from reasonableness, Justice Kennedy, is\nin saying that the Court doesn't actually have to decide\nwhat the single most reasonable fee is. But as the SEC\nexplained in 1969, the shift from reasonableness to --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I would be very\nsurprised if \"reasonableness\" always meant one -- one\nfigure. It could mean a range.\nMR. GANNON: Well, I think reasonableness\nis - is inevitably going to be part of the inherent\nfairness inquiry that this Court referred to in Pepper\nv. Litton as being part of the fiduciary duty status as\nto whether the transaction --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you a question\ngoing back to Justice Kennedy's early question? Do you\nthink the fiduciary status of the defendant in this case\nis different from the fiduciary status of a president of\na corporation?\nMR. GANNON: I -- I -- I think that it is\ndifferent from the status of a president of a\ncorporation; that -- that the term of art, \"fiduciary\"\nwhich Congress was invoking here can mean different\nthings in different circumstances.\nPepper was a case that involved corporate\ndirectors. The chief difference here and what Congress\nwas intending to counteract was the inherent structural\nimpediment to arm's-length bargaining between the\ninvestment adviser and the board of directors. And\nthat's what makes that high burden that was used in\nPepper v. Litton for controlling shareholders the\nrelevant analogy, we believe.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. GANNON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Donovan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN D. DONOVAN, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. DONOVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe point that Mr. Gannon just made and that\nMr. Frederick made before, that there was some\nstructural impediment to negotiations between a mutual\nfund board and adviser, is at the heart of this dispute,\nbecause that is a judgment that Congress made. The\nInvestment Company Act in the first instance delegates\nresponsibility to the board of directors to approve\nfees. A fee may not be approved that does not have the\nconsent of a majority of the independent trustees in the\nfirst instance.\nThe independent check on fees that is\nerected by section 36(b) --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's assume -- let's\nassume that all of the independent board of director\nmembers vote for a particular fee, but the fee is\nnegotiated by an insider, and the insider is the one who\ndoes the evaluation, looks at them and says: I think\nthis is really a great deal, guys. And they just fell\nfor it. Is that a process that would guarantee an\narm's-length transaction in the sense that Congress\nintended in this act?\nMR. DONOVAN: It may not and it may give\nrise to a cause of action. But as I started --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which cause of action --\nMR. DONOVAN: A cause of action --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- under what?\nMR. DONOVAN: It may give a cause of action\nunder section 36(b) if the circumstances you described,\nJustice Sotomayor are -- have an impact upon the fee.\nAnd the reason --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, then their process\nis part of your definition of \"fiduciary duty\"? A court\nhas to look at the nature of process?\nMR. DONOVAN: If there is an impact upon fee\nthat is outside of the range of what could have been\nbargained. The reason for that --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now -- now you are\nadding what has been added, which is outside of the\nrange, correct?\nMR. DONOVAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right.\nMR. DONOVAN: If I understand your question\ncorrectly, will a process flaw alone justify a\nsection 36(b) cause of action? My answer is no. Will a\nprocess flaw that affects a fee justify a 36(b) action?\nYes, it will.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. But what you\nare -- but what you are arguing is, if the process is\nfair, even if the fee is outside the range of an arm's-\nlength transaction, there is no cause of action?\nMR. DONOVAN: No, I -- I -- I doubt that as\nwell. There are two separate causes of action, I can\nimagine, under 36(b): One, a process flaw that has a\nfee impact; and second, a fee that is so far outside of\nthe bounds of what could have been bargained that it\njustifies independent review.\nThe question under 36(b) is whether, having\ndelegated responsibility in the first instance to a\nboard, there is a reason to second-guess their judgment.\nAnd the independent check that Mr. Gannon referred to at\nsection 36(b) or (a) should not be a de novo judicial\nreview of the size of the fee for a couple of reasons,\nthe first of which is section 36(b)(2). That statute\ninstructs courts to give such consideration as they\nconsider due to the deliberations of the board. What\ndid they see? What did they get? Did they negotiate?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's a wonderfully clear\ncommand, isn't it? Such consideration as is\nappropriate? What is the language? Read it. What is\nit?\nMR. DONOVAN: The language is \"such\nconsideration that the court considers due under the\ncircumstances.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wow.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DONOVAN: But there would be no reason\nfor that instruction at all, Your Honor, if a court were\nto make its own judgments about what is fair and\nreasonable.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, it's meaningless. It\ntells the court to make its own judgment. Such\nconsideration as the court deems due. Give it\nwhatever -- whatever consideration you -- you feel like.\nIt's utterly meaningless to me.\nMR. DONOVAN: What I think Congress was\ndoing was considering what the source of the common law\nhad been before. The corporate context,\nJustice Kennedy, I think was what inspired. At\ncorporate law, a decision would not be second-guessed by\na court unless there was a reason to do so, unless the\njudgment of directors and the presumption of regularity\nthat attached to their decisions could for some reason\nbe second-guessed. Was there a process flaw? Was it so\nfar out of bounds?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what is \"so\nfar out of bounds\"? In other words, you are saying, you\ncan look at what the directors did if it's, as you said,\ntoo far out of bounds, but 10 percent off, 50 percent\noff?\nMR. DONOVAN: Mr. Chief --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Double, as they say\nis the case here?\nMR. DONOVAN: I'm sorry?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Double, as they say\nis the case here?\nMR. DONOVAN: As the plaintiffs say is the\ncase here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. DONOVAN: I suggest there is no\nnumerical basis, because in fact every kind of mutual\nfund and ever stripe of mutual fund is different.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then you say:\nLook to see if it's outside the bounds, and now you tell\nme there is no way to look to see if it's outside the\nbounds.\nMR. DONOVAN: Well, I think -- the first\ncomparative would be other funds of a similar stripe.\nSo, for example, you could imagine that a mutual fund\nwith the same investment objective and style that is two\ntimes might be inappropriate. You could also imagine a\ndifferent circumstance where, passively managed funds\nfor example, a multiple of fees would be inappropriate.\nYou could also, though, imagine a case where\nthere is substantial risk taken, where the types of\nsecurities that are invested in are unusual, where\nsubstantial differences could be justified.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that the test that the\ncourt of appeals here applied?\nMR. DONOVAN: Pardon?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that the test that the\ncourt of appeals here applied, whose judgment you want\nus to affirm?\nMR. DONOVAN: The court of appeals did not\napply the test. Judge Easterbrook --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So we should remand it for\napplication of the test that you propose?\nMR. DONOVAN: I don't think you have to.\nAnd the reason is because of what the district court\ndid. And there I get to, Justice Ginsburg, what you\nsaid. The -- the argument is made that services are the\nsame. In fact, that is not the record. And if you look\nat page 161 of the Joint Appendix and following, there\nis a list of services that the trust -- the investment\nadviser gave to the trustees in this case, about all of\nthe services that they did for their fee in the case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Surely that's a disputed\nfact, isn't it? And you want us to dispose -- or you\nwant this to be disposed of on summary judgment. The\nother side says the services aren't that much different.\nMR. DONOVAN: They are very different. Page\n161 and following will tell you how. And the district\ncourt at page 360 -- 16a, excuse me, of the district\ncourt's opinion, notices that the services were\ndifferent. So, under --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It wasn't talking about\nthis particular case. It was talking about in general,\nwasn't --\nMR. DONOVAN: No, he was talking about this\ncase, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Except that they claim\nthat you were receiving additional payment for the\nservices, or some or at least a substantial number of\nthe services, that you claim are attributed by the\ndifference. So they're saying if you compare apples to\napples, you are charging twice the amount. If you\ncompare apples to oranges, there are differences because\nthe oranges were different, but you were getting paid\nfor those oranges separately. I think that was their\nargument.\nMR. DONOVAN: That is their argument and\nit's not accurate, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's the issue\nof disputed fact. So let's go back. Are you disavowing\nthe Seventh Circuit's approach? Because I read your\nbrief and it doesn't appear as if you are defending\ntheir market approach that says so long as the process\nwas fair, any fee is okay. That's how I thought they\nhad reached their conclusion.\nMR. DONOVAN: I think what Judge Easterbrook\nsaid, and we don't agree, is if there is deceit of\ndirectors that would justify a cause of action under\n36(b). But in the absence of, in his words, \"pulling\nthe wool over the eyes of the trustees\" --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's what I'm talking\n-- I am using his words in terms of case --\nMR. DONOVAN: I do --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And you're disavowing\nthat?\nMR. DONOVAN: I do not defend that, because\nI can imagine, as your hypothetical asked earlier,\ndirectors or trustees who -- are not paying attention --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Your positions is no\ndifferent than the solicitor general's, that there has\nto be some measure of fair process and some measure of a\nfair fee, at least within -- in terms of it not being\noutside the range an arm's length transaction?\nMR. DONOVAN: The solicitor general gets it\nright when she describes Gartenberg as the standard. Is\nthis a result that could have been fairly bargained at\narm's length. Where we part company is with respect to\ntwo things: One is, she says and Mr. Gannon said today,\nthat the most important consideration is a comparison to\nother kinds of fees, and that is required in the\ncalculus in the district court. In fact, that would\nmake mandatory what the SEC rules only make\ndiscretionary.\nChief Justice, you asked earlier about the\nSEC's rules in this area. And in fact, they compel\ndisclosure of fees charged by advisers to their funds\nand their conflicts of similar investment objectives.\nThey do not require disclosure of accounts within an\nadvisor's business operations that are institutional\naccounts. Now to be sure --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That are what?\nMR. DONOVAN: That are -- advisers --\ninstitutional accounts adviser services. If --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the -- the fund\nadviser here -- I mean, the investment adviser did\ndisclose -- that's in the record -- did disclose the\ndifference between what were charged mutual funds, what\nwere charged institutional investors, and then explained\nthat the services were different and that justified the\ndifference. But they weren't trying to think, no, we\ndon't have to come forward with this information.\nMR. DONOVAN: That's precisely correct, Your\nHonor. In this case the trustees did have the\ninformation. The adviser did disclose it, but the SEC\ndoes not require them to ask that question. All it\nrequires them to do is if they do ask the question, if\nthey do study the material, they must disclose the\nweight they put on to it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose you were appointed\nto a committee, just set my pay, that might be helpful.\nI'd say I'll pay you $50,000 a year to do it, as long as\nI am satisfied with your results.\nNow, would you, for example, not have in\nyour mind, I would like to know what he's paid by other\npeople that don't have someone like me setting his pay?\nWouldn't that be in your mind?\nMR. DONOVAN: It could be, sure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, so wouldn't that be a\nnormal question to ask?\nMR. DONOVAN: And the trustees did ask it\nhere.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I don't know if they\nasked it -- I mean, I think we are reviewing the\ndistrict court opinion, I think we are reversing -- we\nare reviewing -- sorry. We're reviewing.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: I have laryngitis; I don't\nspeak accurately.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: I think we are reviewing a\n-- a decision of a court of appeals setting a standard,\nand so wouldn't, when we set the standard, say, we can't\nsay if in every case you are not going to go out and ask\nhim what he charges when he mows the neighbor's lawn,\nbut we would like to know what he charges when he asks\nfor money from people who do not have this kind of\nsupervision, and we would like if it's a lot different\nto ask him why.\nMR. DONOVAN: Justice Breyer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay, so what's the problem\nthen with saying that in the opinion?\nMR. DONOVAN: There is no problem with\nsaying that if it is a relevant consideration.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, it's pretty unusual\nthat it won't be, and I think certainly you have in the\ncase in front of us a case where it would be relevant.\nYou may have an answer to the question. There may be a\nperfectly good answer, so let's listen to it.\nMR. DONOVAN: The difference, Your Honor, is\nthat the Solicitor General and the plaintiffs would make\nthe question and the answer dispositive in every case.\nI would acknowledge as --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The answer dispositive?\nWell, I don't see it should be dispositive, maybe the\nanswers would be quite different.\nMR. DONOVAN: Precisely.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So -- but you\nno objection, then I'm not sure there is much of an\nissue. There might -- I mean, maybe there is some.\nThat's the only issue, whether this should be\ndispositive always, or whether it should be a factor to\ntake into account where relevant?\nMR. DONOVAN: It is a factor that I consider\nthat is likely to be relevant --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So you have no objection to\nsend it back and say look, of course this is relevant,\nperhaps quite often relevant; why don't you look at it?\nMR. DONOVAN: My objection -- my objection\nto sending it back is only that that analysis was done.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But did -- but in the\nSeventh Circuit, Judge Easterbrook said, mainly you have\nto look to see if there was full disclosure, and then\nthere might be cases where it's so out of line. And he\nsaid the comparison would be to other mutual funds. He\nexcluded the comparison with institutional investors.\nSo to that extent, was the Second Circuit wrong, saying\nthis is not a relevant factor; what other mutual funds\npay investment advisors may be a relevant factor?\nMR. DONOVAN: I think the Seventh Circuit\nmade that comparison. Judge Easterbrook did say that\nthe services of institutional accounts ordinarily are\ndifferent from mutual fund accounts. I agree that in\nthe first instance, the first comparator usually should\nbe mutual funds, and regrettably Judge Easterbrook did\nnot cite to the record for the reasons to identify those\ndifferences. But it is in fact in the record, and there\nis no other record that suggests that they were the\nsame. All we had below was the assertion that on the\none hand, an advisory contract for an institutional\naccount said advisory services. And in the other we had\na mutual fund advisory contract that said advisory\nservices.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you say you\nshould look at the range and how far it's off, do you\nmean that in the Gartenberg sense -- in other words, if\nit is way out of line, then you assume or can at least\nlook further at whether there was a fair process? Or do\nyou mean it in the normal case, in sort of setting the\nrates you just look how far it is off.\nMR. DONOVAN: I look at it in the Gartenberg\nsense, Your Honor. And the reason is because as I --\nfrom what I said the first question is, is when do you\nask courts to substitute their judgment?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's probably --\nyou're not the person to -- to ask, but do you\nunderstand the Solicitor General's position to be your\nunderstanding of the Gartenberg sense or something else?\nMR. DONOVAN: I believe they interpret in\nthe Gartenberg sense. I think that the Solicitor\nGeneral's position and the Respondent's, with respect to\nthe standard that you ought to apply, is Gartenberg.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What do we do about\nGartenberg? That is to say, the key sentence you can\nread either way. The key sentence could mean -- it just\ndepends on tone of voice. You must charge a fee that is\nnot so disproportionately large that it bears no\nreasonable relationship to the services rendered and\ncould not -- could not have been the product of\narms-length bargaining. Or you could say, look, it's\nunlawful where it's so large -- it doesn't -- where\nthere is no reasonable relationship. And if there is no\nreasonable relationship, how could it have been the\nproduct of arm's-length bargaining?\nMR. DONOVAN: I agree you can turn the words\nupside down. I think they turned it upside down --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You object if we turn them\nupside down?\nMR. DONOVAN: I think they turned them\nupside down for a reason, and the reason is 36(b)(1),\nwhich imposes the burden of proof upon --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'm saying the tone,\nbe a little careful here.\nMR. DONOVAN: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So we can say the substance\nis -- I'm just trying this out -- the substance is to\nlook and see if it's reasonable, and if it's reasonable\nit certainly is the product of arm-length bargaining, if\nit's not reasonable, how could it be? Got to get an\nanswer to that, okay? So, that way you see the tone is\nbe careful, you are a judge, you are not a rate-setter.\nHow's that?\nMR. DONOVAN: I would accept the proposition\nthat it is reasonable if it is outside of what could\nhave been bargained at arm's length. I think they\nturned it upside down the fact for the reason that the\nstatute reverses the burden of proof and I think that\nthey also acknowledge that it is a process-oriented\nthing for judges to do, because after all you are asking\nhere a standard for judges to apply in a contested\nsituation that recognizes the responsibility of the\nboard in the first instance. That's what 36(b)(2) is\nall about.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would -- would you give us\nthe citations of the parts of the record that you say\nrender it unnecessary for us to remand for the lower\ncourt to consider a comparison with non- -- with\ninstitutional charges?\nMR. DONOVAN: Yes, Your Honor. I start at\npage 16a and 17a of the district court's opinion where\nat page 16a at the bottom the district court said the\nservices supplied are different. And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: At 16a of the Joint\nAppendix you are talking about?\nMR. DONOVAN: I'm sorry, Your Honor, the\npetition.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of the petition.\nMR. DONOVAN: Correct, it's 16a of the\npetition, which is Judge Kocoras' opinion. At the\nbottom of the page you will see that he said, the\nservices Harris provided to institutional clients varied\nbut in all events were more limited than those provided\nthe funds.\nIf you then go on to page 17, he goes\nthrough with respect to each of these three funds and\nchronicles the fees they paid and by comparison the fees\ncharged to institutional accounts with similar\ninvestment objectives. The statement by the plaintiff,\nPetitioners here, that the fee charged was a 2X\nmultiple, does not refer to that array of institutional\naccounts. It takes one in order to make the comparison\nwhat it is.\nAnd then, Justice Scalia, I would then go to\npage 32a of the district court's opinion where he\ndescribes what appear to be disputed issues of fact.\nAnd what he said those dispute issues of fact were about\nwere what the Petitioners claimed were flaws in the\nnegotiation process, in substance, what they would have\ndone had they been negotiating, rather than the\ntrustees. It is not a dispute about the ultimate test,\nwas this fee so far out of bounds it could not have been\nreasonable.\nTo be sure, throughout a record that is as\nlarge as this one, you could imagine the parties\ndisputed lots of things. What you could not fairly\ndispute is whether these fees, for these funds, using\ncomparable funds and using institutional accounts, as\nJudge Kocoras did, were so far out of bounds, they could\nnot have been fairly bargained, and if that is the test,\nthere is no need for remand.\nIf, as I suggest and as the Solicitor\nGeneral suggests, Gartenberg is the appropriate\nstandard, Gartenberg is what the district court applied.\nThis Court has to be sure, on occasion, and\nit is rare, both announce the test and apply it in the\nsame circumstances.\nIn circumstances where courts are looking\nfor guidance on what the standard is and how to apply\nit, I suggest this is a case in which affirming what the\ndistrict court did would be appropriate.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the\npetitioners' allegation that the investment adviser did\nnot provide full and accurate information? And they\nmention particularly concerning economies of scale,\nprofitability, and several other matters, that what\neverybody agrees is necessary, full disclosure, had not\noccurred.\nIs that a disputed issue of fact or of\nfurther inquiry?\nMR. DONOVAN: I don't think it is, Your\nHonor. And, again, I would go back to what Judge\nKocoras said on 32(a).\nThere was absolutely suggestions in the\nrecord by the plaintiff that they would have negotiated\ndifferently, but, for example, with respect to\nostensible misrepresentations on -- among other things,\nprofitability and the rest, this was because the\nplaintiffs' expert did an accounting and accounted for\ncosts differently and said, had you accounted for costs\nand allocated them the way I did, you would have reached\na negotiated result that was different.\nWell, that just isn't what happened. That's\nwhy Judge Kocoras said, this goes to the integrity of\nthe negotiation. Would the negotiation have been\ndifferent?\nThe plaintiffs say, I would have done it\ndifferently, but that's all they said, and it's not a\nmisrepresentation to say, I would have accounted for\ncosts differently.\nFinally, I would -- the other question you\nasked is where in the record -- Justice Scalia, I'm\nsorry. It's at page 161 and following, where the\nbackground of all the difference in fees and the\ndifference in services is chronicled.\nYou can tell, from the pull-out charts at\npage 171, what fee is charged for each of these mutual\nfunds and what fee is charged for institutional\naccounts.\nIf you take the plaintiffs' point of view\nand say that a comparison to institutional accounts is\nalways required and may be dispositive and is always a\nfraction of what mutual fund charges and that judges are\nthe, in the first instance, the ones to decide who is\nfair and reasonable or what is fair and reasonable, as\nopposed to directors, I suggest you consign 8,000 mutual\nfunds to a trial.\nOn this record, these were funds that had\nbest in class performance for fees that were at or below\nindustry averages.\nThat is not a record upon which a reasonable\nperson could conclude that the adviser has over-reached.\nThat is at the heart of fiduciary duty. I see my time\nis about to expire.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Frederick, you have three minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. FREDERICK: At this recording here did\nnot make findings -- this was a summary judgment case,\nand in fact, the Court didn't find that the disputes\nwere nonexistent.\nIn fact, on page 30a, the district court\nsaid that the disputes were nonmaterial, and that's a\nvery important distinction because the joint appendix\nthat you have before you contains a lot of evidence in\nwhich it is disputed whether or not these were similar\nservices.\nThe Harris manager on page 6 -- JA 650, the\nportfolio holdings of the funds, are very similar. On\n512, the Harris fund manager testimony that, when he\nbuys a stock, he buys it for all mutual funds and\nindependent accounts, with the same investment\nobjective.\nOn 505 to 506, the Harris research director\ntestimony that the managers of the mutual funds and\nindependent accounts share equally all work done by the\nresearch department, and 513 to 514, that the Harris\nfund manager says all of our analysts do research for\nall of our clients.\nThere is disputed evidence here as to what\nconstitutes similarity, Justice Sotomayor, these are\ncomparing apples to apples because the record indicates\nthat there are separate contracts for the additional\nfees that they charge to the mutual funds for the\nadditional services provided.\nWe're simply talking about comparisons of\nmoney management, but --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Was your friend\ncorrect, that these funds have better than average\nperformance and lower than average fees?\nMR. FREDERICK: In one small aspect of the\ndamages period, that is correct, and after that was\nfound, they had lower than average performance and\nhigher than average fees, Mr. Chief Justice. It's a\ndamages period that encompasses several years.\nIf I could go back to the point, though,\nabout the fiduciary duty, what Judge Cardozo, when he\nwas on the New York Court of Appeals, said, a fiduciary\nrepresents the punctilio of honor, and that is\ncontrasted with the morals of the marketplace operating\nat arm's-length.\nIt surely cannot be the case that, where you\nare dealing with a fiduciary duty -- which is a higher\nstandard recognized in the law -- that you can charge\ntwice as much as what you are obtaining at arm's-length\nfor services that you are providing.\nThe Gartenberg court, Justice Breyer, in\nfact, had the opposite language that you are averting\nto, and that is at page 694 F.2nd 928, where the Court\nsaid, \"The test is essentially whether the fee schedule\nrepresents a charge within the range of what would have\nbeen negotiated at arm's-length in the light of all the\nsurrounding circumstances.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought, by reversing\nthat, picking out what the essence was, you would get\npretty close to what you are arguing for, without\ngetting into all this thing of whether it's just like a\ntrustee or whether a lawyer should be a trustee or --\nyou know, there are a lot of questions here that could\nfloat around, of any language we use.\nMR. FREDERICK: That's right. The Second\nCircuit that went on to flip it and say, we had to prove\na negative, which is not ordinarily what a plaintiff has\nto prove in any law case, by showing it -- it is so\ndisproportionate it could not have been achieved at\narm's-length, and that is where we think the court --\ncourts have gotten this wrong.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
