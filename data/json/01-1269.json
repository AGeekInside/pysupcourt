        "content": "(11:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in Number 01-1269, the City of Cuyahoga Falls versus\nBuckeye Community Hope Foundation.\nMr. Nager.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GLEN D. NAGER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. NAGER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nIn this case, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth\nCircuit held that a municipality may be held liable in\ndamages because it withheld the issuance of building\npermits for a proposed housing project pending a citizen-\ninitiated referendum election on the ordinance authorizing\nthat housing project.\nIn so doing, the Sixth Circuit failed to\nappreciate that the municipality's actions here were all\ntaken pursuant to pre-existing procedures set forth in the\ncity's charter, procedures that the city followed to the\nletter. As non-discretionary acts taken in the normal\nprescribed course, the municipality's actions here were\nnecessarily rational ones taken without discriminatory\nmotives and without treating the respondents here any\ndifferently than any other beneficiary of an ordinance\nwould have been treated that was subject to a petition.\nAnd for that reason, we respectfully suggest that the\nSixth Circuit --\nQUESTION: There's no evidence of some kind of\nmisbehavior on the part of the city other than the bare\nclaim that they refused to issue the permit during the\nprocess of the referendum?\nMR. NAGER: That's correct, Justice O'Connor.\nEvery official action of the city here favored the\nrespondents. The city planning commission recommended\napproval of the housing project and of the site plan\nauthorizing the housing project. The city council voted\nin favor of the housing project.\nQUESTION: Wasn't there some evidence that some\ncity official was -- sought to delay the proceedings for a\nperiod of time, not -- not officially. It didn't take --\npass any resolution, but didn't they oppose immediate\naction on a couple of occasions?\nMR. NAGER: Justice Stevens, prior to the city\ncouncil voting on the -- the ordinance to approve the\nproject, there was a lot of public debate, and in that\npublic debate, there were city officials who said we --\nwe need to take time to hear the citizens -- citizens'\nconcerns. We need to take time to understand what we're\ndoing, and there were even comments, we should fight this.\nWe should fight this and delay this.\nQUESTION: Supposing one of those comments said\nwe should fight this because we don't want\nAfrican-Americans to -- to move where they're going to\nmove, would that make any difference?\nMR. NAGER: It -- it could make a difference.\nQUESTION: Because even -- if that had happened,\nit would still be true, as you pointed out earlier, that\nevery official action taken by the city was favorable to\nthe -- your opponents.\nMR. NAGER: Well, if -- if the actions were\ntaken favorably to the opponents, it couldn't make a\ndifference because at that point the alleged statement\nwouldn't have any connection to an adverse action.\nThat -- that's the important point in this case because in\norder to have discrimination, either in violation of the\nEqual Protection Clause, or in violation of the Fair\nHousing Act, you not only have to have a motive, you have\nto have adverse differential treatment by the person --\nQUESTION: So what -- I'm trying to be sure\nI understand. I -- I think I understand your position.\nIs -- your position is that even if this ambiguous\nevidence was -- clearly showed racial hostility and that's\nwhy we're trying to delay it, there still would be no\ncause of action because everything the city did was in\nfavor of -- officially was in favor of --\nMR. NAGER: That -- that's correct.\nQUESTION: So that really, we don't have to try\nand draw -- to decide whether or not inferences of\nimproper motive can be drawn from those statements.\nMR. NAGER: That's correct because in this case,\nall of the city's actions either favored the project or\nnon-discretionary actions.\nQUESTION: Now, what if the city had taken the\nsame official action that it took in this case, and every\nofficial action either favored or was at least neutral,\nand yet the city officials went out and -- and whipped up,\nin effect, anti-black sentiment and -- and urged the\nfiling of the application for the referendum, would the\nanswer -- would the -- would the result be the same,\nthat -- that there would be no way that the city could be\nheld liable?\nMR. NAGER: The short answer to that question is\nthe answer would be the same. Of course, if the\nreferendum were enacted, it went to a vote and it were put\ninto effect and it was racially motivated, that action\nwould be subject to challenge because that would be, in\nfact, an action of the city because they would have\nadopted, under your hypothetical facts, an ordinance that\ncould allegedly have a discriminatory intent.\nQUESTION: But isn't the -- isn't the delay\nsimply a -- even the delay in -- in an instance in which\nthe ordinance is defeated simply a lesser degree of\ndamage, but which would, nonetheless, be -- be subject to\na claim?\nMR. NAGER: And the answer to that is no. And\nthe answer to that is no because the delay that happened\nhere is the delay that would happen with regard to any\nreferendum that was subject to a referendum petition. And\nthe record here is quite clear --\nQUESTION: Well, it -- there's -- there's no\nquestion that it -- it would, but is -- is the -- is\neither the -- the statute in question here or the Equal\nProtection Clause blind to an obvious reason for the\ndelay? In other words, I -- I quite agree. We start with\nthe assumption that mere delay in governmental processes\ndoes not give rise to a cause of action, but when the\ndelay is induced by city officials for a racially\ndiscriminatory reason, aren't we then in a different case?\nMR. NAGER: Well, it's a different case, but\nit's not different outcome here, and the --\nQUESTION: Why shouldn't it be a different\noutcome?\nMR. NAGER: Well, because under Monell and its\nprogeny, as well as this Court's State action cases, the\nmunicipality can be held liable only in damages only if\nthe city -- an official with the authority to authorize it\nhas authorized the discriminatory action that you're\ntalking about. In this specific instance, the -- every\nofficial action favored the project, and the delay that\nyou're talking about was authorized by a city charter\ncreated 30 years before the fact.\nQUESTION: Well, the mechanism -- the mechanism\nis provided by the city charter.\nI guess what I'm getting at is that if city\nofficials -- let's just say the mayor, for the sake of\nargument, or the mayor and the city council -- in effect,\ndo not establish a policy in the sense that they say, we\nwant to stop black housing projects, but they follow a\npolicy of trying to make it difficult for those housing\nprojects to be approved, and one way they do that is by\nspurring the -- the request for referendums. Assuming\nwe're going to apply the Monell rule here, isn't that a\npolicy position of the city even within the meaning of\nMonell?\nMR. NAGER: No, because they wouldn't have the\nauthority to do that. There's a difference between six\ncity council members voting at a city council meeting as\nto what the actions of the city are, and six city council\nmembers going out on their own in their private capacities\nand expressing their views as citizens, and -- and trying\nto get other citizens to agree with them as to their\nprivate views.\nQUESTION: But not --\nQUESTION: Well, supposing, Mr. Nager, that you\nhave, say, a -- say, a seven-member city council and it's\nconfronted with a project like this. And one of the seven\nmembers of the city council says that, you know, he's\nopposed to this because he doesn't want African-Americans\nmoving into this area. The other six members of the city\ncouncil simply treat the thing on the merits. Does the\naction of this one individual taint the whole action of\nthe city?\nMR. NAGER: Well, it shouldn't. Under Arlington\nHeights and this Court's cases, the city could be held\nliable only if those authorized, in this instance a\nmajority of the city council, had the -- the\ndiscriminatory --\nQUESTION: What if the vote was four to three?\nMR. NAGER: Four -- if it was four to three in\nfavor of the housing project --\nQUESTION: No. Against the housing project.\nMR. NAGER: If -- if they had discretionary\npower, and four of them exercised their discretionary\npower against the housing project on the basis of racially\ndiscriminatory --\nQUESTION: Well, only one had the racially\ndiscriminatory motive, one of the four.\nMR. NAGER: Well --\nQUESTION: The other three did it on the merits.\nMR. NAGER: I think there, there would be a good\nargument that they would still -- that -- that the\nplaintiffs would have -- would have satisfied their burden\nof showing but for the racially discriminatory motive,\nthat the housing project would have been approved. So\nin -- in that hypothetical, which is not the facts of this\ncase, of course, they -- they would have had sufficient\nevidence to state a claim.\nQUESTION: And your difference in the two cases\nis, one, you have an official action taken. We deny the\nproject. Here you don't have that.\nBut suppose there had been, to take the clearest\ncase, a tape of a meeting. The mayor, the legal director,\nthe head of the city council, they all got together and\nsay, we want to kill this project and we know that the\nmost effective way to do that is through this referendum\nbecause the people won't like it and they'll vote against\nit. So they have a deliberate plan to string the thing\nout and then, as the last act, instigate a referendum.\nAnd as I take it, your argument -- you would --\nyou're saying even if you have that scenario, there would\nstill be no municipal liability. Am I correct?\nMR. NAGER: That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.\nIt's obviously our hardest hypothetical, but it's also the\nsame answer. And it -- and one of the reasons it's the\nsame answer is because, remember, under your hypothetical,\nthe notion is that if these city officials, not acting in\ntheir -- exercising their official powers, but acting in\nthe role any citizen can, can go out and organize the\ncitizens of the community acting in their private\ncapacities to get a referendum on the ballot and vote\nagainst it. Of course, that's what democracy is about.\nIt's about politicians taking on causes on behalf of\npeople --\nQUESTION:\nyour argument as it applies to the city, but am I correct\nthat the mayor is an individual defendant in this case?\nMR. NAGER: He was. He was granted summary\njudgment by the district court on the ground that there\nwas no evidence that he in his individual capacity had\ncommitted any of the acts that were alleged against him,\nand that he had not organized the campaign --\nQUESTION: But -- but wasn't that reversed by\nthe Sixth Circuit?\nMR. NAGER: No, it wasn't. That issue was not\ntaken up to the Sixth Circuit.\nQUESTION: Why is he a petitioner then?\nMR. NAGER: He's only here in his official\ncapacity. He was sued in both his individual capacity and\nin his official capacity.\nQUESTION: I see. So there's no individual\nliability at stake here at all.\nMR. NAGER: No, not -- not --\nQUESTION: Is -- is the --\nQUESTION: I'd like to ask a question, which is\nthese have been very interesting hypotheticals, but are\nyou going to have time to talk about the questions that we\ngranted cert on?\nMR. NAGER: Well --\nQUESTION:\nfront of us now at this point as issues.\nMR. NAGER: The issue that you have before us is\nthe Sixth Circuit's judgment is -- is -- because under the\nSixth Circuit's view there was allegedly evidence of\nracial bias among the citizens that the municipality could\nbe -- somehow be held liable for that. And that's wrong\nfor two reasons.\nOne, it's wrong because the municipality itself\nhas to have the discriminatory animus, and there's no --\nnot only no evidence of that here, it couldn't have been\nthe case since they -- of course, all of their actions\nwere voting in favor of it, or treating the action\nneutrally.\nSecondly --\nQUESTION: Arguably the discriminatory animus on\nthe part of the citizens could invalidate the referendum.\nMR. NAGER: If it was voted on and put into\neffect, the alleged animus --\nQUESTION: No. Even -- even if it wasn't put\ninto effect. It -- if there were that animus, it -- it\ncould -- by our past cases anyway, if it could be shown,\nit would -- it would invalidate the referendum. But your\npoint is that whether the referendum was valid or invalid,\nthe municipality would have had to stay the project. It\nwasn't up to the municipality to make the judgment.\nMR. NAGER: That -- that is correct, Justice\nScalia. I -- I do want to make clear that under this\nCourt's cases, the Court has never said that -- that the\nFirst Amendment activity of a petition itself is subject\nto an equal protection challenge.\nWhat the Court's cases say is if there is a\nvote, either on a bill by elected representatives, or on a\npetition by citizens, that the end product of that, which\nbecomes a law, can be challenged, and that private animus\nin that -- is contextual evidence for whether or not the\npeople who voted on that final product were themselves\nmotivated by discriminatory animus.\nQUESTION: You're -- you're talking about people\nwho vote in a referendum?\nMR. NAGER: Well, the -- the question is if\nthere's a final product, was the -- the final law, was\nthat racially motivated --\nQUESTION: But we -- we've never said -- we've\nnever tried to examine the motives of -- of the citizenry\nwho vote in a referendum on that sort of question, have\nwe?\nMR. NAGER: No, you haven't, Mr. Chief Justice.\nWhat the Court has said is, is that intent of the law is\nthe key test, and what the Court has said in Arlington\nHeights is because you can't look directly at the motives\nof the people who voted on it, whether they be legislators\nprotected by the Speech and Debate Clause or citizens\nprotected by the -- the secrecy of the ballot in this\ncountry, they look at other indicia to determine their\nintent.\nQUESTION: But Arlington Heights was a city\ncouncil, or --\nMR. NAGER: That's correct.\nQUESTION: -- was it not?\nMR. NAGER: That's correct.\nQUESTION: What -- what is --\nQUESTION: And here the referendum failed.\nMR. NAGER: That -- well, the -- we don't know\nthe outcome because the respondents asked for the final\nvote not to be certified.\nBut what is important here, I think, to address\nthe issue in this case, Justice O'Connor, is that the --\nthe position of the Sixth Circuit here is that the\nmunicipality is somehow supposed to inquire behind a\nfacially neutral referendum petition and determine the\nintent and motives of people engaged in the First\nAmendment.\nQUESTION: Did -- did the city have discretion\nhere to go ahead and issue building permits while the\nreferendum process was pending?\nMR. NAGER: No, it didn't. Once the referendum\npetition was filed, under the city charter, the -- at that\npoint, all the city council could do is repeal its own\nordinance or submit the ordinance to a vote of the voters.\nQUESTION: So what is the claim in your opinion\nthat we are reviewing? I mean, I want it to be specific.\nThe Sixth Circuit, insofar as its -- insofar as we're\nconcerned, we're interested in what the lower courts held.\nMR. NAGER: Correct.\nQUESTION: What, in your opinion, is the claim\nthat they're reviewing? Is the claim that these three\nindividuals, the mayor, the clerk, and an engineer, acting\nin their official capacities, violated the Fourteenth\nAmendment or other parts of the Constitution when they\nrefused to issue the permit despite the petition and\ndespite the provision? Is that the claim? Or is the\nclaim they did something else as well? They stirred up\nthe petition people, or they did some other thing.\nMR. NAGER: Well, the -- the Sixth Circuit said\nit was the former.\nQUESTION: Only the first.\nMR. NAGER: Correct. Respondents in their brief\nhave abandoned what the Sixth Circuit held and which we\npetitioned and the Court granted cert to review to argue a\ncompletely different theory.\nQUESTION: May I ask you, Mr. Nager, is the\ncomplaint in the record? I couldn't find it. In the --\nin the papers here?\nMR. NAGER: I don't believe that it is. No, I\ndon't believe -- I mean, it's -- it's obviously in the\nrecord of the case. It wasn't reprinted in the -- in the\njoint appendix.\nUnless the Court has further questions, I'll\nreserve the remainder of --\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I do. Weren't -- weren't\nthere some other questions here, like didn't we grant cert\non three questions --\nMR. NAGER: Well, you did --\nQUESTION: Have they given up on the second one?\nMR. NAGER: Well, they've abandoned their claim\nthat they litigated and prevailed on in the Sixth Circuit,\nthat they could proceed on the disparate impact theory.\nQUESTION: And the last is a due process?\nMR. NAGER: A -- a substantive due process\nclaim.\nQUESTION: Substantive due process?\nYes.\nMR. NAGER: And the Sixth Circuit held that\nthere was a triable question of fact as to whether or not\nthe city had acted rationally in proceeding forward with\nits referendum petition. And we would say that the simple\nanswer to that was at that time, the city charter required\nthe city officials to do so and that judgment was adopted\nby three courts until the Ohio Supreme Court several years\nlater reversed itself on what the meaning of the Ohio\nconstitution was. But the subsequent reversal of this\nhighest court's evaluation of what the law was can't\nchange the rationality of the acts at the time that they\nwere taken.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Nager.\nMr. Salmons, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONERS\nMR. SALMONS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nRespondents challenge only the delay caused by\nthe city charter's neutral, longstanding provisions\nfacilitating the orderly processing of citizen-initiated\nreferenda to review ordinances passed by the city council.\nSuch a challenge requires courts to balance the vital\nFirst Amendment right implicated in the referendum process\nwith the equally valid goals of equal protection and fair\nhousing.\nIn this case, that balance is clear. The city's\nactions in giving effect to the properly filed referendum\npetition cannot give rise to liability under the Fair\nHousing Act or the Equal Protection Clause. It is\nundisputed that the referendum petition was facially\nneutral and that numerous reasonable, non-racial grounds\nsupported it.\nIt is also undisputed that the city's process\nfor handling such petitions was longstanding and\nrace-neutral. Under any conceivable standard, respondents\nhave failed to provide any evidence that the referendum\nprocess was tainted with discriminatory motive either on\nthe part of the city officials or the petition organizers.\nQUESTION: Suppose it was. I mean, I don't\nunderstand your brief from this point of view. You were\ntalking about an antitrust analogy. I mean, imagine a\nplaintiff in an antitrust case deliberately, to ruin his\ncompetitor -- and no one doubts it -- files a case in the\ncourt. Now, no matter how evil that person was, I can't\nimagine or I haven't heard to date under the antitrust law\nor any other law somebody who would sue the clerk of the\ncourt because he docketed the -- he docketed the -- the\nclaim -- he docketed the complaint. And according to what\nyou've said, that's what's at issue here, that they're --\nthey're simply carry -- now, I -- I need some explanation.\nI'm bringing it up because I'm quite honestly confused\nabout that part --\nMR. SALMONS: Yes -- yes, Your Honor. Yes, Your\nHonor. To be sure, the analogy to the Noerr-Pennington\nline of cases is not perfect in this case, but it -- it --\nQUESTION: I -- I bring it up because I'm\nconfused as to how in your mind you see this thing\nworking. I -- I mean, I suppose if a city has a totally\nevil, horrible petition for a -- for a -- for a\nreferendum, a person still could make it and the person\nwho's in charge of carrying out the -- the non -- the\nministerial duties himself would not be sued even if that\nperson himself was evil. So -- so what is the -- what --\nwhat -- how does this all work in your mind?\nMR. SALMONS: Yes, Your Honor. The -- the\napproach that we recommend in our brief, Your Honor, is\nthat the Court undertake the question as to whether the\npetitioning at issue was genuine or whether it was a sham.\nThat's the same type of analysis the Court has\nundertaken --\nQUESTION: Assume it's a sham. It -- they're\nevil. They're horrible.\nMR. SALMONS: Yes.\nQUESTION: They're terrible. I would think even\nan evil, horrible, terrible person has the right to go to\nthe legislature and petition and that the clerks who are\nto file that petition are themselves clerks, and they're\nto do it even if they're evil themselves.\nMR. SALMONS: That is correct, Your Honor.\nI think there are two ways in which the city could\npotentially be held liable. I think this is not a case\nwhere the Court has to decide whether the city could ever\nbe held liable based on the discriminatory motives of the\nreferendum petitioners because it's clear in this case\nthat the petitioning was genuine and this isn't a sham.\nQUESTION: But what -- what --\nMR. SALMONS: But in the situation where you do\nhave a sham --\nQUESTION: What -- what do you mean by saying\nthe petition was genuine as opposed to a sham in these --\nin this context?\nMR. SALMONS: I -- I think genuine here means\nthe same it means in -- in the other contexts in which the\nCourt has used the sham doctrine, namely that it was about\nthe First Amendment activity. The -- the process that --\nthat the city here --\nQUESTION: I just -- this is such a strange\nargument. Why wouldn't we wait and see if some action was\ntaken by means of a referendum, passed and became law?\nThen wouldn't we be able to say that constitutes State\naction at that point and you would subject it,\nconceivably, to an equal protection analysis if the issue\nis raised, and apply rational basis or whatever it is?\nI don't understand why you ever get to this sham action\nand Noerr-Pennington.\nMR. SALMONS: Certainly, Your Honor, it -- in\nthe event that you have a referendum that's actually\nenacted into law, the Court would examine it in the way\nthat -- that you have articulated.\nWe thought it was important to point out to the\nCourt that this process by which a city ordinance is, if\nyou will, stayed pending resolution of the referendum vote\nis a traditional and important part of the process for\nreferendums, but it is also a process that can give rise\nto abuse if you have a petition that is a sham. It's not\nabout the First Amendment process at all. It's simply --\nQUESTION: I don't --\nMR. SALMONS: -- taking advantage of the delay.\nQUESTION: I don't know what you mean by abuse\nin a situation like this. I mean, presumably anybody has\na right to petition, and you know, the fact that maybe\nthey won't get the necessary votes surely doesn't make it\na sham.\nMR. SALMONS: That -- that is certainly true,\nYour Honor. But -- but I think there are -- to -- to get\nback to the original question, what I'm trying to --\nQUESTION: The reason I'm worried, in about\n2 minutes from now I'm going to hear the other side get\nup, and they're going to say this is a sham. Okay?\nI suspect. Now, that's why I want to understand the\nrelevance of this.\nAnd I -- I come into this thinking if it's the\nNazis, the -- the most terrible racists that steal, the\nmost terrible people in the world, if they're Americans,\nthey can come in and they can vote and they can go to\ntheir legislature and they can put anything they want on\nthe ballot. And the -- the people who are mechanically in\ncharge of seeing that those things are voted on, that's\ntheir job, they should do it, and if those are evil and\nterrible and contrary to the Constitution, the courts will\nstrike them down when they get passed.\nNow, what's -- now, you explain how your thing\nfits into that.\nMR. SALMONS: Yes, Your Honor. First of all,\nlet me just say that there's -- there would be -- need to\nbe both an objective and a subjective component to the\nsham standard as there is in other contexts.\nBut to try and address the question that you\noriginally posed, it does seem to us that there are at\nleast two ways in which the city can be held liable in the\nevent that you have sham petitioning. One would be that\nif the city officials themselves were part of the sham,\nand the other would be --\nQUESTION: Well, wait a -- what is --\nQUESTION: We're trying to find out what is a\nsham. That's -- that's our basic problem. I don't\nunderstand what is a sham. In the antitrust context --\nQUESTION: You -- you haven't told us.\nQUESTION: In the antitrust context, I\nunderstand it because -- because there is the law, and --\nand you come up with a phony -- a phony law, you know, you\ncan say it's a sham. But there's no law about\nreferendums. You could have a referendum on anything you\nlike. How can you have a wrong referendum --\nMR. SALMONS: Well, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: -- and thus a sham referendum? It\ndoesn't make any sense to me.\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, this Court's sham\nanalysis has to do with whether or not it's actually about\nthe First Amendment activity or it's just about an effort,\nin this case, to take advantage of the delay to interfere\nwith someone's housing rights. We think that same\nanalysis can apply here by inquiring as to whether, first\nof all, the -- the referendum petition is objectively\nbaseless. Is there any way that that petition could\nhave -- be enacted into law and enforced?\nIf, for example, you had a petition that said no\nminorities shall live in the City of Cuyahoga Falls,\nclearly that's a referendum that could never go into\neffect and never be enforced, and therefore, it may be\nstrong evidence that the process here is not about\nchanging a law of the city --\nQUESTION: So the clerk in that case -- the\nclerk of the court who says I'm putting this on the\nballot -- he's violated the law in putting it on the\nballot? Of course, if it's passed, it's totally\nunconstitutional. But you're saying that the clerks\nshouldn't even put that on the ballot? I mean, that would\nbe quite a novel proposition to me.\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, I -- I'm not\nnecessarily saying that the clerk shouldn't put that on\nthe ballot, but that would be one part of the analysis in\ndetermining whether or not the process was being abused\nand it was just a sham.\nQUESTION: Well, isn't -- wouldn't it be a\nsham -- let me just put this on the table. As I\nunderstand it, the Ohio Supreme Court said that this was\nnot a legal referendum when it got all through with\nthings. And if everybody had known before the -- the case\nstarted that it was an illegal referendum, that would have\nbeen a sham, wouldn't it?\nMR. SALMONS: I -- I think that very well may be\nstrong evidence that it was a sham. This was about an\nattempt to abuse the process. It wasn't about any\nprotected First Amendment activity. And -- and in that\nsituation I think there is, in -- in addition to the\npossibility, although I think perhaps unlikely that you\ncan hold the city vicariously liable based on the motives\nof the citizens, I think that is a difficult question as\nto whether the actions of -- of the referendum -- the\npetition signers, the 10 percent who signed the petition\nand file it, whether that action is the official action of\nthe city with regard to the petition just as the action of\nthe voters at the referendum vote is an action of the city\nfor which the city can held liable. This Court need not\naddress that in this case.\nQUESTION: May I ask your view on the\nhypothetical I asked to the other lawyer? Supposing it\nwas perfectly clear that the mayor and everybody else in\nthis used the referendum as a method of delaying a\ngranting of the permit and that they did so for racially\nmotivated reasons, would there be any -- any liability on\nanybody?\nMR. SALMONS: Potentially, Your Honor. I think,\nagain, the -- the way in which the analysis would work is\nthe Court would need to inquire as to whether the\npetitioning was genuine in the sense that there was a\ngenuine effort to try and change the city's ordinance.\nAnd if so, then the First Amendment would provide\nimmunity.\nQUESTION: Well, there was, but they -- they\nfigured it was going to lose in the long run, but\nnevertheless, let's assume they wanted to delay things for\n60, 90 days, whatever it might be, because they wanted to\ndelay it on -- on, you know, this -- this project.\nMR. SALMONS: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: If it -- if it were clear because\nthis case is on summary judgment, so really don't know\nwhat the facts are --\nMR. SALMONS: Well, but --\nQUESTION: -- but if there were clear evidence\nthat the mayor and everybody else act up in a racially\nmotivated reason, would there be liability in that\nsituation?\nMR. SALMONS: I -- I think you'd need to examine\nboth the motives in -- in your hypothetical not only of\nthe city officials, but also of -- of the petition\nsigners.\nQUESTION: Everybody. Everybody.\nQUESTION: Are you talking about personal\nliability or official liability?\nQUESTION: Liability --\nMR. SALMONS: I'm talking about the liability of\nthe city, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Okay. So you're talking about\nliability --\nQUESTION: I'm assuming everybody who opposed\nthe project was racially motivated and that could be\ndemonstrated with tape recorder.\nMR. SALMONS: I guess the short answer, Your\nHonor, is that even people with racial motives have the\nright to petition their government to change the law.\nAnd -- but if they -- what no one has the right to do is\nabuse the process in order to interfere with someone's\nfair housing and equal protection rights.\nQUESTION: So -- so your answer would be no\nliability in that case.\nMR. SALMONS: If it was genuine petitioning,\nthat is correct.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Salmons.\nMr. Kramer, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD G. KRAMER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nQUESTION: Mr. Kramer, opposing counsel says\nthat you have, in effect, abandoned the second question\npresented, the disparate impact question. Is that correct\nor is it not correct?\nMR. KRAMER: It's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.\nWe -- we have waived that claim that had been certified\nby -- by this Court.\nMr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:\nThe city and the Solicitor General has tried to\ncomplicate what really is a very simple case. What is the\ninjury that the plaintiff is complaining about? The\nplaintiffs have been denied unlawfully their site plan and\nits benefits, including a building permit. City conduct.\nNothing to do with referendums. Nothing to do with First\nAmendment rights.\nThe issues of liability in this case, which the\nSixth Circuit took up, was did the city and its officers\nact out of discriminatory motive by delaying this housing\nproject and refusing to give effect to the site plan\nordinance to appease racial and anti-family prejudices in\nviolation of the Equal Protection Clause --\nQUESTION: How could they do that if they had no\nchoice? I mean, if the law told them you have to stop the\nproject once the referendum is filed, even if in -- in\ntheir heart and -- heart of hearts they were delighted for\nracial reasons that this was the case, nonetheless they\nhad no choice.\nMR. KRAMER: We believe that they did have a\nchoice and we cite cases to the Court from the Ohio\nSupreme Court on page 25 of our brief that indicates that\nthe petitions did not have to be certified by the -- the\ncourt -- by the city.\nQUESTION: But didn't the lower -- the lower\ncourts didn't adopt that proposition, did they?\nMR. KRAMER: The lower courts weren't asked that\nquestion, Your Honor, because we're really talking about\nwhether or not the -- there was an official conduct by the\ncity.\nQUESTION: So didn't they go on the basis that\nthe -- that the city officials' action was mandatory? The\nlower courts.\nMR. KRAMER: As I said, I don't really believe\nthe Sixth Circuit approached the -- the case from -- from\nthat particular issue.\nQUESTION: So it didn't --\nMR. KRAMER: There was discretion, we believe,\nand we certainly provided evidence. And again, as -- as\nwas indicated by the Court to the Solicitor General, this\nis on summary judgment. For example, in the record, there\nis an affidavit from the law director for the Village of\nOrange that we filed with our brief in opposing summary\njudgment that indicated that there was discretion not to\ncertify the referendum.\nQUESTION: Well, but that -- that's a question\nof Ohio law, I take it?\nMR. KRAMER: That's correct.\nQUESTION: And the way you sought to prove it\nwas to get an affidavit from the law director of some\nsuburb of Cleveland?\nMR. KRAMER: As one element of proof, we\nindicated that that showed that there was discretion. But\nthe Ohio case law indicates there are instances where, if\nthe subject was inappropriate -- and let's remember the\nOhio Supreme Court ruled that this was not an appropriate\nsubject for a referendum.\nQUESTION: Would it be --\nQUESTION: But it rules that way many years --\nmany years after this case was -- went to litigation, did\nit not?\nMR. KRAMER: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And it had nothing to do with whether\nit was racist, sexist. It -- it had to do with was it\nadministrative or legislative.\nMR. KRAMER: That's correct, and it also only\nhad --\nQUESTION: Do you have -- do you have any -- do\nyou have any authority to say that there is discretion to\nreject a petition that is properly legislative?\nMR. KRAMER: Well, the -- yes, Justice Ginsburg.\nQUESTION: Suppose -- suppose you had a\nlegislative proposal that members of a certain race will\nnever be included in any kind of an equal opportunity law.\nSuppose you had -- that was the referendum. Is there any\nauthority that says that under Ohio law, that couldn't be\nput on the ballot?\nMR. KRAMER: I don't know of Ohio law, but\ncertainly this Court's decision in Hunter versus Erickson\ndealing with an Ohio referendum indicates that that type\nof referendum is unconstitutional.\nQUESTION: Well now, I don't believe that's a\ncorrect statement of the holding in Hunter. I thought in\nHunter, this Court said that a municipality cannot make\nracial laws subject to referendum and no other laws, which\nis quite a different proposition from what you suggest.\nMR. KRAMER: Well, with -- Mr. Chief Justice, we\nare talking about the -- this Court's jurisprudence that\ndeals with the -- simply because it's a referendum, if\nthe legislature could not do this, pass a law that says,\nfor example, that African-Americans cannot own property,\nlike in Buchanan versus Warley --\nQUESTION: If a legislature could do that,\nwould -- would we enjoin a legislature from passing an\nunconstitutional law?\nMR. KRAMER: And -- no.\nQUESTION: The Federal -- the Federal Congress\npasses unconstitutional laws all the time.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: We've -- we've never been asked to\nenjoin them.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KRAMER: And -- you're correct, Justice\nScalia. And we have not asked for that.\nQUESTION: So there's a difference between\nwhether the product is unconstitutional and whether the\ndoing of it is unconstitutional. And the doing of an\nunconstitutional referendum, as far as I know, is not\nunconstitutional. You are entitled to pass an\nunconstitutional referendum. We will ignore it, however.\nMR. KRAMER: And it may subject, if there is\ndirect injury, damages to my client, and that is all we\nhave before this case.\nQUESTION: What -- but wait. The -- the project\nis built. Right?\nMR. KRAMER: That's correct.\nQUESTION: So -- so you've got your project.\nAnd now what you're saying is that they violated the\nConstitution in not giving you the permit quicker. And\nthey -- am I right?\nMR. KRAMER: That's correct.\nQUESTION: All right.\nAnd they come back and they say, how could we\ngive it to you quicker? There were petitioners who\nthey -- a petition and the law prevents us from giving it\nto you quicker because once a petition's on the ballot,\nthe law says we can't give it to you. Now, what's your\nresponse to that?\nMR. KRAMER: The response is that it was the\ncity's actions -- we believe the evidence that we've\nproffered to -- in the summary judgment shows that they\ntook this action as a public-private partnership. The\nmayor, city councilpeople looked for -- as they -- one\ncity councilman said, any legal shred to be able to reject\nthis development.\nQUESTION: No. But explain to me a little bit\nbetter what -- their response is the reason we didn't give\nyou the permit faster is because here's the provision of\nthe law. It says once a petition for referendum is filed,\nand it says whether it's legal or illegal, we have to\ndelay this. Now, your response to that is -- they say,\nwhat should we have done that we didn't do once that\npetition was filed. And your response is?\nMR. KRAMER:\nthis is that there is an injury to my client. The injury,\nwhether it was discretionary or non-discretionary, is --\nis not the -- the question. What was the purpose behind\ndenying the building permit? And under Arlington Heights,\nthis Court has indicated one of the things that a court\ncan look at as competent evidence is did the city\nofficials take action to appease racial bias. Even if it\nwas a nondiscretionary act, if the effect of that was to\npermit private bias, they've committed a violation.\nQUESTION: That's quite a proposition. If -- if\nI have a -- you know, I'm -- I'm a racist and it really\nmakes me happy that this act, which I'm compelled to do by\nlaw, hurts someone of a certain race, that renders that\nact invalid even though I'm compelled to do it by law?\nI don't think so.\nMR. KRAMER: What we're saying is that it may\nnot be invalid, but it may cause liability. It can be a\nlegal act --\nQUESTION: All right. So what I'm hearing you\nsaying -- what I'm hearing you saying in response to my\nquestion is, I'm the mayor and the other, and I say, what\ndo you want me to do? The statute said, don't give you\nthe permit because the petition has been filed. What\ncould I have done? And your answer to that basically\nseems to be, nothing.\nWe agree. But the petition itself was an evil petition.\nQUESTION: Right.\nQUESTION: I mean evil being quotes for what we\nall know is going on. All right?\nSo it's an evil petition. And therefore, when\nyou face this evil petition, even though you couldn't do\nanything about it, you have to pay damages because the\nreason we were delayed was because of that process. Now,\nis that basically your argument?\nMR. KRAMER: Yes, Justice Breyer. We're --\nwe're saying that even if it was a legal thing to do, if\nthe act of it was because of racial or anti-family bias,\nthat would be a violation of the --\nQUESTION: And now, the reason that that bothers\nme, of course, is because I can think of a whole range of\nevil legislative acts, and I can think of quasi-acts that\nI'm not sure about, and then I can think of a lot of ones\nI like. All right. So -- so -- but I'm worried. In the\nfirst category and the second category, once we got into\nthe business of paying damages, because it turns out that\nthey are evil, that would, in fact, chill the legislative\nprocess, which is a democratic process. And I think\nthat's the argument they're trying to make. So I'd like\nto get your response to that.\nMR. KRAMER:\nis that the fact that there was an evil motive behind any\nof these acts -- and by the way, the referendum is only\nthe culmination of the acts. There was a series of\ndiscretionary acts. For example, the strategy of the city\nwas to do two things. One was to delay this project\nbecause they knew that there was a -- a very finite period\nof time for our little non-profit tax-exempt developer to\nbuild this project or lose their financing. So they knew\nthe longer they could delay, the more likely the project\nwould die.\nAnd second of all, they wanted to make the\nproject more costly. So, for example, they required,\nbefore we even talked about a referendum, a barrier wall\nto be built before even a building permit that could be\nissued, a 6-foot earthen wall with a 5-foot fence between\ntwo conforming multi-family projects.\nQUESTION: Your client agreed to that. Your\nclient didn't make any objection to that.\nMR. KRAMER: My client was willing to do that\nbecause he was told by the city it would smooth the\nprocess over. He certainly did not waive his rights.\nAnd in the depositions, the planning\ncommissioner, Louis Sharpe, specifically testified the\nreason he was demanding that was because our project was\ngoing to have a large number of children. Now, under the\nFederal Fair Housing Act, as amended in 1988, such an act\nmay well violate the protection against -- against\nchildren.\nQUESTION: You said -- but -- but, nonetheless,\nhe didn't contest it.\nThen you say the whole object was delay. And as\nI see this thing unfold, the big delay is during the\npendency of the referendum because it was at the end of\nFebruary when the planning commission got this. They had\nconditions on it, but it acted on the very same day. The\nordinance was approved on April 1st. As things go in the\nzoning area, from February 21st until April 1st is not a\nvery long time, is it?\nMR. KRAMER: No, but there was three hearings\nand there was a great deal of public opposition. And one\nof the reasons for the --\nQUESTION: But the delay -- as far as -- that --\nthat's not -- the delay that you're complaining about is\nfrom the moment the petition was filed for the referendum\nuntil when he finally got the building permits.\nMR. KRAMER: The actual complaint that we are --\nwhere we think we were injured was the building permits\nnot being provided to us. The delay goes to the amount of\ndamages we think our client has suffered. The official\nact that we're talking about is the building permits\nbeing -- not being issued. And --\nQUESTION: But you couldn't have expected them\nto be issued the -- the day you filed the site plan.\nI mean, there has to be a meeting of the planning\ncommission. There has to be a meeting of the city\ncouncil.\nMR. KRAMER: That's correct, and we submitted\nour building permits after the -- the approval by the --\nthe city council.\nWhat we're talking about, Your Honor, is that\nthe city's actions in denying that building permit --\nwe're -- at this stage of the proceeding, all we're\ntalking about is summary judgment. Is there sufficient\nevidence that a trier of fact would find that the -- the\nactual denial was racial prejudice of city officials or\nappeasement by city officials --\nQUESTION: Mr. Kramer, I asked your opponent,\nbut is the -- is the complaint in the papers before us,\ndo -- do you know?\nMR. KRAMER: Your Honor, the complaint is not in\nthe appendix, but it is in the joint appendix that was\nfiled with the Sixth Circuit. You'll find that in\nvolume I on page 37 of the record. But it's -- it's the\nSixth Circuit joint appendix --\nQUESTION: I see.\nMR. KRAMER: -- which I believe this Court does\nhave.\nQUESTION: The thing I was curious about, to\ntell you the truth, did you include a regulatory takings\nclaim in your complaint?\nMR. KRAMER: No, we did not.\nQUESTION: You did not.\nQUESTION: Mr. Kramer, would you explain to me\nwhat exactly you think the relevance of the subsequent\nreferendum was? For example, do you say the relevance of\nthe subsequent referendum to your claim for delay in\nissuing the permit simply is the evidence that it\nfurnishes of -- of racial bias ultimately on the part of\ncity officials? Or is -- is its relevance that it\nincreased the damages otherwise attributable to the day --\ndelay in the permit?\nHow exactly should we regard the referendum?\nYou -- you understand the problem that we're all having\nwith -- with it. Precisely how does it figure in your\nclaim?\nMR. KRAMER: It's the latter, Justice Souter.\nWe're saying that the referendum, which was part of an\noverall scheme by city officials to delay this project so\nthat it would kill it. And so the injury that we're\ntalking about from -- from the referendum deals with the\ncity officials using that as the legal shred to be able to\ndeny the building permits. And the evidence we believe\nthat we have proffered to the Court through the summary\njudgment motion is that there was not only citizen bias,\nwhich under Arlington Heights, this Court has indicated we\ncertainly can allow -- it's competent evidence that can be\nlooked at of whether or not legislators used that bias to\nbe able to take that action.\nQUESTION: No. I -- I understand that.\nIf -- if there had been no referendum, no\npetition had ever been filed for the referendum and none\nhad ever been held, would you still have essentially the\nsame claim, though with a different evidentiary basis?\nMR. KRAMER: Absolutely, Justice Souter, because\nthe -- what we are complaining about is the denial of the\nbuilding permit. That's the injury that --\nQUESTION: But there would have been no denial\nof the building permit absent the referendum, there --\nQUESTION: You could win without the referendum.\nMR. KRAMER: That's correct.\nQUESTION: The referendum's the worst part of\nyour case. You -- you wish there weren't a referendum.\nThen they would have had no basis to deny.\nMR. KRAMER: To deny in -- in this case.\nQUESTION:\nclaim was that -- that you would still have been delayed\nin being issued the permits and that you would still have\nhad a claim for that. Am I -- am I wrong on that?\nMR. KRAMER: I would say that we had some claim\nfor the time between when we submitted the request for the\nbuilding permits and how long it took them to be able\nto --\nQUESTION: And in -- in the absence of the\nreferendum, how long would that have been?\nMR. KRAMER: That would have been a matter --\nwell, we don't know. Let me say --\nQUESTION: Why don't you know? Because you --\nthere's a 30-day period. There's a -- the city council\nacts on April 1st. That goes into effect in 30 days\nunless there's an intervening referendum. So that you\nwould have had by May 1st the building permits.\nMR. KRAMER: We don't know because in the record\nMayor Robart sent a letter ordering his building\ncommissioner not to issue a building permits, and that\nwas --\nQUESTION: That was --\nMR. KRAMER: -- even prior to the referendum --\nQUESTION: But that was in the 30-day period\nwhen they couldn't be issued because it hadn't become\neffective yet.\nlaw was, that the ordinance approved by the city council\ndoesn't become law until 30 days after that approval. So\nthat the -- the mayor, to that extent, was just telling\nthem to do what the law would require.\nBut in understanding your complaint and how you\nare tying in the officials to the referendum, are you\nsaying that absent the official prompting, instigation, or\nwhatever you call it, that there would never have been a\nreferendum, that in -- in fact that the mayor whipped up\nthe referendum?\nMR. KRAMER: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. We -- we\nbelieve we indicated that this was not something that the\ncity responded from -- responded to from their citizens,\nbut this was a scheme where city officials, including\nMayor Robart with other private citizens, got together and\nsaid, how can we deny this project.\nQUESTION: But you've lost on that and didn't\nappeal it. I mean, he'd be a very bad man for doing that,\nand you might have a cause of action against him. But I\ndon't see any official city action involved in that.\nIs it official city action for the -- for the mayor to\nstimulate a referendum? How is that official city action?\nMR. KRAMER: And we're not talking about that\nthat's something that caused a damage. What we're talking\nabout is, is there evidence that we can use to show that\nthe ultimate decision, which was to deny the building\npermit that caused the injury -- is there evidence that\nthe mayor participated in -- to appease racial and anti-\nfamily bias.\nThis is really a simple Arlington Heights case.\nThe --\nQUESTION: If it --\nMR. KRAMER: -- the problem --\nQUESTION: I just want to finish -- But I just\nwanted, before you finish, if you'd respond to something\nJustice Stevens said, which is about regulatory takings.\nI mean, what is in the back of my mind here, to stimulate\nan answer, is suppose you weren't Section 8 housing.\nSuppose you were building a hotel. And suppose the\nreferendum wasn't people who might be bigoted -- may,\nperhaps -- I don't -- but suppose they were\nenvironmentalists, and -- and suppose the constitutional\nclaim was not --\nQUESTION: People that didn't want rich people\nto move in the neighborhood.\nQUESTION: What?\nQUESTION: People that didn't want rich people\nto move into the neighborhood.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Okay, good.\nThe -- the -- you see. And suppose the\nconstitutional claim were a takings claim. Now, if I\nuphold for you here, if the Court votes for you here,\nwouldn't it then have to say that all these environmental\ncases and so forth -- I -- I don't want to win your case\nfor you, but I might be in my question.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: The -- the -- you see -- see there'd\nbe quite a problem about whether a city wouldn't have to\npay damages every time that they make a mistake in their\nenvironmental regulation and perhaps try to stop a hotel\nand they thought they could stop it, but it turns out\nlater they couldn't. You see -- do you see the analogy\nthat's worrying me?\nMR. KRAMER: I understand the analogy.\nQUESTION: So what do you -- what do you -- what\ndo you say about that?\nMR. KRAMER: The difference, Justice Breyer, is\nthat the -- we are asking only for the Court to look at\nthe issue of has the plaintiffs proffered sufficient\nevidence that racial bias and anti-family bias was\ninvolved in the decision to deny the building permit.\nThe referendum was part of the -- an overall scheme by\ncity officials to delay and ultimately kill this project.\nIf that is the case, then the referendum, which Ohio\nSupreme Court has ruled was illegal to begin with -- even\nif it was legal, we believe under your jurisprudence if\nthe motivation of the city to use the referendum was\nunlawful, the violation occurs under the Fourteenth\nAmendment and the Equal Protection Clause.\nWith regards to your question about the\nregulatory taking, we saw this -- this case under a due\nprocess -- substantive due process, procedural due\nprocess -- examination very similar, I think, to the\nsituation that's actually the exact opposite to the City\nof Eastlake versus Forest City case, which Justice Stevens\nis the only participating member that was on that\nparticular case.\nQUESTION: Also there were eight other members\nof the Court that disagreed with me if I remember\ncorrectly --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KRAMER: But we have a new Court, Your\nHonor.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KRAMER: And -- and we believe --\nQUESTION: Now, you're -- you're now addressing\nthe third of the questions presented. It's the first\nwe've heard about the due process claim.\nMR. KRAMER: That's correct.\nQUESTION: You haven't abandoned that and --\nMR. KRAMER: Absolutely not.\nQUESTION: -- you're still making the due\nprocess claim. Now, you know, this is substantive due\nprocess we're talking here. Right?\nMR. KRAMER: Well, substantive, or --\nQUESTION: You think it's a fundamental right to\nhave a building permit granted within a -- within a\nreasonable period?\nMR. KRAMER: We're not talking --\nQUESTION: It's fundamental --\nMR. KRAMER: -- about a reasonable period.\nWe're talking about both -- we had raised both procedural\nand substantive due process claims in the lower courts.\nWhat we're saying is the process was so fundamentally\nflawed that it rises to a -- a due process violation.\nWhether it's substantive or procedural, we don't believe\nis -- is really the issue here.\nWe're talking about a process where there was a\nwhole set of procedures set up by the City of Cuyahoga\nFalls of how to approve this site plan ordinance. The --\nthe site plan procedures were set forth, permitted for a\nrecord to be developed, and there was a -- planning\ncommission meetings. There was the city council meetings.\nAnd if the city council or the planning commission had\ndenied our right to the site plan ordinance and its\nbenefits, we would have had a right under Ohio law to go\nunder the Ohio Administrative Procedure Act and get a\ncourt to review that issue.\nQUESTION: Because there would have been\nofficial action. And that's the problem here, that\nthere -- do you -- do you call a referendum that's put on\nthe ballot because 10 percent of the electorate had signed\npetitions -- do you call that State action, which is\nsubject to the equal protection surveillance? I had\nthought that that's a -- that's an initiative of the\npeople and it's not action of the city.\nMR. KRAMER: Well, the only reason why the\npeople are able to get a referendum is because the city\ncharter, which is their constitution, permitted that.\nQUESTION: But that permitted it 30 years ago,\ndid it not?\nMR. KRAMER: That's right, but in the -- the due\nprocess area, Your Honor, we're not talking about\ndiscriminatory intent. All we're talking about is looking\nat whether the procedure set forth is fundamentally flawed\nand does it -- is it arbitrary and capricious and not\nsubstantially related to the general welfare as -- as this\nCourt has talked about ever since --\nQUESTION:\nreferendum measures that voters put forward. I -- your\ntheory would seem to subject a State or a city or whatever\nit is to a lawsuit every time there's one of these nutty\nproposals put forward.\nMR. KRAMER: No. We're talking about whether\nyou have to have a -- a protected property interest and\nyou also have to have a situation where there is a\narbitrary and capricious action.\nIn this case, we have ownership of property,\nwhich under the original intention of -- of the Framers of\nthe Constitution, ownership of private property and the\nability to develop using this property for a lawful\npurpose is protected by the Due Process Clause. And when\nyou look at the issue --\nQUESTION: But your theory, as I understand it,\nis that there was -- if it was racially motivated, there\nwas just sort of an arbitrary. There was an absence of a\nlegitimate reason for the delays and the shenanigans and\nso forth. But it seemed to me the same argument could --\ncould be made if they were trying to protect the wetlands,\nand they used the same kind of shenanigans.\nMR. KRAMER: Well, Your Honor, we certainly\nraised the question about if this was a discriminatory\nmotive, that would mean that there would not be -- under\ngeneral welfare.\nQUESTION: There would be no racial basis.\nMR. KRAMER: But more importantly, our argument\nis that there is a per se violation whenever you have an\nadministrative matter which should be taken up through the\ncity council or through the courts or through a -- from --\nfrom an administrative agency like the planning\ncommission.\nAnd the evidence in the record, as the lower\ncourts point out, is that we met all the requirements for\nthe city to -- to get our site plan. And then, when the\ncity council approved it, when the planning director said\nwe met or exceeded the site plan ordinance, they put it to\na referendum and they asked 20,000 voters to approve or\ndisapprove a site plan ordinance, they never saw and\nthe -- and whether or not that site plan ordinance\nconformed to the building and zoning code that they never\nread. If that is not --\nQUESTION: No. But what your -- what your\nargument boils down to is to say that there is a\nrecoverable substantive due process violation whenever a\nproperty right of yours is interfered with by a misuse of\nthe legislative process, even a temporary one. Isn't that\nthe -- the nub of your claim?\nMR. KRAMER: I would say we -- we are asking for\na fairly narrow interpretation.\nadministrative matter which should not be subject to the\ndecision of voters because this is not legislative --\nQUESTION: But what -- from the standpoint of\nyour claim, why does it matter whether it -- it was a\nlegislative use countering an administrative action, or\nwhether it was a legislative use with a racial motive? It\nis an improper use of a legislative procedure. And you're\nsaying, as I understand it, whenever that, in fact, is\neffected, there -- and -- and you can -- you can make a --\na colorable claim of -- of some economic damage, that you\nhave a substantive due process right to recover. Isn't\nthat correct?\nMR. KRAMER: Justice Souter, we -- that is\nsomething that we have raised in our brief, but we have --\nalso have raised a much narrower issue which would be\nsimply looking at a site plan ordinance, should it be\nsubjected to a popularity contest? There -- it's\nstandard-less. This Court has ruled in --\nQUESTION: You never mentioned procedural due\nprocess in your brief. The first mention I heard of it is\nin your argument here, where you say it doesn't matter\nwhether it's substantive or procedural. Your brief went\nentirely to substantive due process.\nMR. KRAMER: Well, the reason that we didn't\nraise that is the Court didn't certify a question other\nthan to substantive due process. We believe that it\nreally subsumes that issue when you look at -- the\nprocedure itself is so fundamentally flawed. It is very\nsimilar to the -- the situation in the City of Eastlake\nthat this Court looked at.\nQUESTION: Would you say -- be saying that if\nthe Ohio court had stuck to its original position?\nI mean, it was four/three both times.\nMR. KRAMER: Well, the Ohio court in both cases,\nJustice Ginsburg, first ruled that it was an\nadministrative matter.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Kramer.\nMR. KRAMER: Thank you, Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: Mr. Nager, you have 3 minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GLEN D. NAGER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. NAGER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nWith respect to the disparate impact claim, I\nwould just like to clarify that we were the petitioners,\nand the Court did grant certiorari on the issue and there\nis a judgment of the Sixth Circuit against my clients on\nthat issue. And while they've abandoned the claim and\ndeclined to defend the Sixth Circuit's judgment, we would\nrequest the Court vacate that judgment and instruct that\nthe disparate impact claim be dismissed with prejudice.\nWith -- Justice Breyer, with respect to your\nquestions to my opposing counsel, a point we'd like to add\nto what you had to say is simply that if we had done what\nthey wanted, we would have been subjected to a damages\nclaim. It would have been a First Amendment claim by the\ncitizens seeking to put something on the ballot by\ninitiating a petition, and it -- it can't be that in order\nto avoid a Fourteenth Amendment damages claim, we have to\nviolate other people's First Amendment rights.\nIf the Court doesn't have any further questions,\nwe have nothing further.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Nager.\n"
