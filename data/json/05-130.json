        "content": "(11:31 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in eBay v. MercExchange.\nMr. Phillips.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe fundamental question that's posed in this\nparticular case is whether or not the court of appeals\nby adopting a rule that declares categorically that\nthree out of the four traditional factors for deciding\nwhether or not to grant permanent injunctive relief\nwill be irrebuttably presumed to be satisfied whenever\na jury has found that a patent is valid and has been\ninfringed.\nThe rule in the Federal Circuit for at least\n20 years has been that if you have validity and\ninfringement decided by the jury, that then there is\nirrebuttable finding of -- of irreparable injury, of\ninadequate remedy at law, and that the balance of harms\ndecidedly favors the plaintiff, and that the only issue\nthat remains available to the defendant in that\ncircumstance is a heightened scrutiny on the standard\nof whether or not the -- the public interest commands\nthat an injunction be denied in a particular case. And\neven in that context, the Federal Circuit's rule is\nextraordinarily stringent because not just any public\ninterest can -- will satisfy, but instead, it has to be\na public interest that endangers the public health.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that all in Judge\nBryson's decision? I certainly didn't see it there.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That -- that is precise -- I\nthink it's the only way to read Judge Bryson's\ndecision, Justice Ginsburg, where the court says, at\npage 26a, that a permanent injunction will issue once\ninfringement and validity have been adjudged, and then\nsay, to be sure, it will not be so to protect the\npublic interest. And we all know the traditional rule\nwith respect to the grant of injunctive relief is that\nit's a four-factor test.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I didn't see anything\nabout irrebuttable presumption.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, the point is that if an\ninjunction follows with a finding of -- of validity and\ninfringement, then that means that there has to be --\nthere has to be irreparable injury, inadequate remedy\nat law, and that the balance of hardships has to tilt\nin -- in favor of the plaintiff. And then the only\nissue that remains is whether or not the public\ninterest justifies not granting an injunction under the\ncircumstances of this case. It seems to me there's no\nother way to read that.\nAnd if you read it in the context of the --\nof the previous 20 years of decisions from the Federal\nCircuit, it is absolutely clear. We don't have the\nopportunity to come back as a defendant in an\ninfringement action and say, Your Honor, in the\nspecific facts of this case, this is someone for whom\nmoney damages is a completely adequate remedy.\nAnd -- and it seems to me quite clear that\nsection 283 is designed to be exactly the opposite of\nthe way the Federal Circuit has interpreted this --\nthis scheme. Section 283 says explicitly -- and this\nis at page 1 of the blue brief -- district courts,\nquote, may -- not shall -- grant injunctions in\naccordance with principles of equity. And principles\nof equity, as Justice Story said almost 200 years ago,\nsystematically reject the idea that you will act on a\ncategorical basis in deciding whether or not to grant\nor withdraw the injunctive relief in -- in particular\ncircumstances. And to the contrary, you have to look\nat each specific issue.\nAnd in that regard --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is -- is that so with --\nwith respect to someone else's use of -- of your\nproperty? It seems to me very rare where -- where\nsomeone takes your property, that the court wouldn't --\nwouldn't give you the property back and -- and simply\nsay, you know -- I can think of a few extraordinary\nexamples. If somebody makes a statue out of stolen\ngold, you know, the -- the old classic, I guess you'd\nget the money back. But ordinarily we're talking about\na property right here, and -- and the property right is\n-- is explicitly the right to exclude others from --\nfrom use of that. That's what the patent right is.\nAnd all he's asking for is give me my property back.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. And -- and Congress\nalready made the -- the balance, Justice Scalia, with\nrespect to that because Congress obviously identified\nthe property right as the right to exclude. And then\nCongress did not confer upon the district courts no\ndiscretion to act in -- in a situation where the\nproperty right has been violated. Instead, Congress\nexpressly adopts in 283 a very broad grant of equitable\ndiscretion. To be sure, in the ordinary case, you --\nyou very well may have irreparable injury proved, but\nthe question is, do you -- do you eliminate any inquiry\nand any specific facts of the case and instead not only\npresume it, which I think is a mistake, although the\ndistrict court did that and found that in this case the\npresumption was rebutted, but to -- but to say\nirrebuttably it's presumed that you have irreparable\ninjury, irrebuttably presumed that you don't have an\nadequate remedy at law, and irrebuttably presume that\nthe balance of equities tilt in favor of the plaintiff.\nAnd that, it seems to me, cannot be squared with the\nlanguage of the statute.\nAnd, indeed, on that score, the United States\nsort of magically ends up on our side of the -- of the\ntable because the United States says the same thing.\nThere is no way --\nJUSTICE BREYER: On Justice Scalia's\nquestion, I was trying to think of some, and I was\ntrying to think the analogy might -- you might find\nsome analogy in the public utilities field, the -- or a\nferris wheel or something. What you want is a person\nwho uses his property not at all himself, but licensed\nthe public generally. And now would a -- would a court\nissue an injunction there? And as I think about that,\nI don't realize I don't know the answer.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I don't know of any. I mean,\nI certainly wouldn't categorically declare that you\nhave to I guess is the way I would respond to that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, that's what -- I mean,\nthat -- that's what you're trying to analogize this\ncase to, I guess, is a person who licenses others to\nuse his property and never uses it himself.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's precisely what this\ncase involves.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And there, I don't know how\ncourts do normally act in other areas of property law.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I don't know that there\nare a whole lot of them like that, but the one thing\nthat -- I mean, there are two things to think about the\nproperty concept in the statute.\nFirst of all, Congress does not declare that\nthe property interest here is a real property interest,\nwhich traditionally has been protected differently.\nIt's a personal property interest, which is\ntraditionally given -- accorded less protection under\nthis kind of a scheme. And so there -- and -- and\nagain, Congress in any event struck the balance. It\ndidn't say, as it could have, that there is presumed --\nthere's a presumption that we have an injunction. It\ndidn't say, as it could have, that we shall have a --\nshall have either a presumption or an injunction in any\nparticular case. And so under the statutory scheme\nhere, it seems to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but -- but the\nexercise of discretion is channeled over time, as -- as\njudges apply it in -- in similar cases. You're not\nsuggesting that in a typical run-of-the-mine patent\ncase, no special considerations, it would be wrong to\nsay that in those cases you typically would grant an\ninjunction?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think in those cases, the\nirreparable injury and the inadequacy of the remedy at\nlaw will be -- will be easy to demonstrate, as they\nhave been for hundreds of years.\nThe -- the fundamental difference -- this is\nimportant to have this in mind. The Federal Circuit\nadopted this rule of law some 20 years ago. That's\nbefore the high-tech boom, before the explosion in the\nnumber of patents. And so the opportunity to deal with\nthese issues on an individualized basis that might give\nrise to some kinds of rules that you could, in fact,\napply to the generality of cases based on an experience\nhas never been there. We have been dealing with an\nirrebuttable presumption for 20 years in a way that has\n-- has completely stultified the ability to develop any\nof those kinds of rules.\nAnd what we're asking this Court to do at\nthis point is to say, no, enough is enough. We need to\ngo back to a time where the -- go back to the language\nof the statute, confer the discretion on the district\ncourts.\nAnd it's important not just for a case like\nthis one, but it -- but it distorts tremendously the\nsettlement value and the process and the relationship\nbetween the patent holder and all of the potential\nlicensees because we're in a -- in a world -- and I\ndon't think the Court can ignore this because it's in\nthe amicus briefs. We're in a world where if a patent\nholder files a lawsuit in Marshall, Texas, no patent\nhas ever been declared invalid in that jurisdiction,\nand no patent has ever been found not to infringe.\nAnd then you take that finding automatically and you\nturn it into an injunction. Any person who has been\nthreatened under those circumstances and told that\nwe're going to face a lawsuit in Marshall, Texas is\ngoing to have a very different negotiating posture than\nin a situation where --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You know, I mean, that's --\nthat's a problem with Marshall, Texas, not with the\npatent law. I mean, maybe -- maybe we should remedy\nthat problem.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I hope you do.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But I don't think we should\nwrite -- write our patent law because we have some\nrenegade jurisdictions.\nWhy -- why isn't the -- the free market\nnormally adequate to solve any problems you're talking\nabout? Everybody is in this for the money. Nobody is\ngoing to hold off giving the license beyond the point\nwhere -- where it makes financial sense.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why can't -- why can't we\nlet the market take care of the problem?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think the -- the\nmarket will take care of the problem. The question is\nunder what standards are you going to apply. Are you\ngoing to say that there is no effective check on the\njury system, that it goes automatically from a jury's\nfinding to injunctive relief, or are you going to\nimplement it against the backdrop of what Congress\nspecifically provides, which is that the district\ncourts should exercise equitable discretion in deciding\nhow best to proceed.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: One of the problems with\nthe district court exercising equitable discretion\nwithout a close review by the Federal Circuit is just\nthe thing that the Federal Circuit was created to\nhandle, that is, you get a tremendous disparity among\ndistrict judges. I don't know that it's only in\nMarshall, Texas that you have a tilt in one direction\nor in the other. So the Federal Circuit is put there\nnot to say that the district judges have no discretion,\nbut to try to rein it in somewhat so that you won't\nhave wide disparities, which you very well might have\nif you just say discretion to the district judges and\nvery light review on appeal.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But, Justice Ginsburg, the --\nthe problem with that is that that's not the scheme\nthat Congress created with respect to the remedial\naspects of -- of the patent laws. I mean, it is surely\nthe case that Congress meant, as -- as substantive\npatent law is generally enforced and implemented, that\nthe Federal Circuit would play a significant role in\nensuring some kind of uniformity, but Congress didn't\nthen go the extra step and say, and when it comes time\nto decide whether or not injunctive relief ought to be\ngranted, that it will -- that we will presume it or\nthat we will deal with it in a categorical way.\nCongress granted that discretion to the district courts\nand with good reason because district --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think maybe you exaggerate\nthe -- the extent of equitable discretion. I mean, it\nwasn't as though it's just left up to the judge, seems\nlike a good idea or not a good idea. There are a lot\nof rules for when -- when you would give injunctive\nrelief and not. And -- and I -- you know, I'm not sure\nyou're going to get into the kind of wide-ranging\nallowance that -- that you seem to be arguing for.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I don't know that I need\na wide-ranging allowance with respect to this. What I\nneed is elimination of the irrebuttable presumption\nthat doesn't allow any consideration of whether money\ndamages are adequate in a particular case.\nAnd -- and here, it's very important to\nfocus. The -- the district judge didn't just say, I\nwoke up this morning and I felt really good about the\ndefendant, and therefore, I'm not granting an\ninjunction. The district court here said, I'm making\nspecific findings of fact with regard to the adequacy\nof money damages to deal --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but he said\nother things too, and one thing he said is, I don't\nlike business method patents very much, and so I'm not\ngoing to give an injunction here.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, that's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think that was\nproper or improper?\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's -- that's not precisely\nwhat he said, Mr. Chief Justice. What he said was that\nbusiness method patents stand on a somewhat different\nfooting because they're subject --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He said there's a\ngrowing concern over the issuance of business method\npatents.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that an\nappropriate consideration to take into account in\ndetermining whether to grant an injunction or not?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think probably, at the end\nof the day, it wouldn't be, but the bottom line is that\nhe did that in the context of analyzing the public\ninterest consideration and he said that didn't --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then he went on\nand he said --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- tilt in favor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- another -- another\nconsideration is that this patentee does not practice\nits patents. But, I mean, isn't that just saying he's,\nyou know, the -- the guy in the garage and he's an\ninventor and the way he's going to market his\ndiscoveries is by getting some firm that basically\nspeculates on patents.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Sure. And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if he's denying\nthat inventor, you know, the -- what he'd give to Bell\nLabs -- or whatever Bell Labs is these days -- that\ndoes practice the inventions --\nMR. PHILLIPS: I should know that actually,\nbut --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PHILLIPS: But, Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I\nthink you can -- it's -- it's not fair to pick apart\neach one of his findings and say does that finding good\nenough or is that finding enough.\nThe truth is the district court made a series\nof four findings that overlap, and one of which was,\nobviously, he doesn't -- he doesn't practice this\npatent. He also doesn't effectively license. He's\nwilling to license his patent to eBay. He's willing to\nlicense this patent to anybody under these\ncircumstances.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but --\nMR. PHILLIPS: And candidly, most of the\nlicensing arrangements don't even exist, and they're --\nI'm sorry, Justice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm -- I interrupted\nyou.\nBut the -- the business process point you\ngive away fairly quickly. I -- I thought that was\nrather substantial. The whole point is, is that a\nbusiness process patent is -- is difficult to define\nand could be very -- it can be very restrictive.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I -- I think in -- in a proper\ncase -- and I don't think you do it under the --\nunder the public interest analysis. I think you'd\nprobably end up doing it under the balance of the\nhardships. But in any event -- and -- and what you --\nyou know, obviously, this case is -- is more\ncomplicated because --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: My concern is if you take\nthat away, I don't know if you've got a lot left for\nthe -- saying no injunction in this case.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I -- I mean, there's\nplenty left because he doesn't practice this invention.\nHe has no intention of practicing this invention\nbeyond the receipt of money. Money damages are a\ncompletely adequate remedy under these particular\ncircumstances, given -- given especially the fact that\nif -- if the infringement continues -- and remember,\nthis is not a situation where he proposes to continue\nto infringe. We propose to work around it, but if the\ninfringement continues, we're then subject to enhanced\ndamages and all of the deterrent power that that has,\nplus the possibility, obviously, down the road that the\ndistrict court could, on a rule 54 motion, now come\nback and say, well, no, now I've decided that\ninjunctive relief is warranted under these\ncircumstances.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, isn't it a concern\nthat Congress didn't provide for compulsory licensing\nwhich this seems to have a very strong resemblance to?\nIt says eBay wants to do this, so they're going to\nhave to pay for it, but the patentee can't stop them.\nIt just has -- in effect, has to license them to do it.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But -- but we're not asking\nfor a compulsory license because it is not our\nintention, going forward, to infringe this patent.\nWe've made it very clear to the district court and the\ndistrict court recognizes that we not only intend to\nbut have, in fact, implemented a design-around or a\nwork-around to this particular patent. And that's what\nwe expect will happen. So we're not asking for the\nright to continue to infringe and a willingness to\npay as we go.\nOur concern -- and this does go to the\nbusiness method patent because it does go to the -- to\nthe uncertainty. The problem we have here is we don't\nknow where the line is going to be drawn. That's why\nthe district court said specifically, you know, there's\ngoing to be unending litigation on this because it's\nvery difficult to define the metes and bounds of this\nparticular patent, and we're going to have to fight\nover that, so that the traditional reason for\ninjunctive relief, which is to bring peace, isn't\navailable in this case. We're not going to have peace\nunder these circumstances.\nAnd when you have that situation and you have\nthe kind of uncertainty, not because of business method\npatents generally -- that's -- that's where I was I\nthink probably giving up too much immediately. I don't\nthink the fact of a business method patent is per se a\nproblem, but I think analyzing the specific business\nmethod patent and its uncertainty is a legitimate\nconsideration for the district court to take into\naccount in deciding whether or not, in a particular\ncircumstance, we are better off saying, pay the\nplaintiff the money for the past injury, let's see how\nthe work-around develops, and take it into account, but\nwithout the sort of --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- well, tell me how\n-- how this works. It seems to me that an injunctive\nhearing is -- might be the cheapest, most effective way\nto -- to sort out whether there's going to be a\nviolation. You call the parties in and they indicate\nwhat -- what they propose to do, and the judge says,\nwell, this is within it or it's without it. It's --\nit's much cheaper than a -- a new lawsuit.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, of course, the\nconsequences of the -- of the process are significantly\ndifferent because, obviously, the remedies for -- for\ncontempt are significantly more draconian than -- than\njust a finding of a -- of a violation.\nBut more -- more important than that, Justice\nKennedy --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but this gives you\nthe advantage of coming in in advance saying, I want --\nI -- I want a ruling in advance that I'm not going to\nviolate the injunction. You've got a cheap lawsuit.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, and the reality is the\ndistrict court already looked at this and said that it\n-- it is the district court's judgment that they're\ngoing to require full infringement trials. I mean,\nthat was the finding it made with respect to the\nbalance of hardships. And -- and neither the court of\nappeals nor the -- nor the Respondent in this case has\n-- has challenged that particular finding. So the\nreality is the district court has made the\ndetermination that that's not -- that process is either\nnot available or not practical in the context of this\nparticular case, which of course, goes back to why it's\nimportant to make sure that you look at each of these\ncases on their individual facts rather than across the\nboard on a -- on these -- on an irrebuttable\npresumption basis.\nThe -- the additional point that I think it's\nimportant I at least spend a minute on, because the\nCourt asked for us to deal with Continental Paper Bag,\nis that it does seem to me quite clear that, at least\nat this stage, the parties are pretty much in sync,\nthat -- that the Court need not revisit Continental\nPaper Bag. The holding in that case is actually almost\na sort of quintessential situation where you have two\nparticipants in the market, one of whom would like to\ntake advantage of a patent that will improve that\nparticipant's ability to produce a product. The patent\nholder is not ready yet to develop that product using\nthat particular method and, therefore, sues to stop his\ncompetitor from entering into that market. I mean,\nthat's the classic kind of situation where you have a\n-- you know, where you -- where you've got the\npotential infringer is looking at what's going on and\nmaking a decision and copying it and then trying to\nimplement it. And the Court said, under those\ncircumstances, you get an injunction.\nBut here, of course, we're dealing with a\nvastly different situation, as we -- as we point out\nthat -- in our brief, where the -- at page 9 where the\ndistrict court specifically found that not any of\neBay's success is attributable to anything in the\npatents of the plaintiff in this case and that nothing\nin the patents that were put forward by the plaintiff\nin this case provide any basis on which anyone could\nbuild a business model. So this is, to my mind, the\nantithesis of the situation in Continental Paper Bag.\nBut in any event, the holding there is\nclearly not implicated here. It's been codified by\nCongress. There's no basis for the Court to reconsider\nit.\nTo the extent that there is -- is dicta in\nthere that talks about the right to exclude, Justice\nScalia, I think, in general, the right to exclude is\none that you do, in fact, enforce with injunctive\nrelief in many cases, but the question here is whether\nor not the Federal Circuit should have adopted a rule\nthat says you -- you enforce it in every case\nirrebuttably as to three of the four factors, and as to\nthe fourth factor, you don't go any further than\nrequiring the plaintiff to show that there's a -- an\nimminent public health crisis.\nUnder those circumstances, it seems to me the\nCourt should reverse the court of appeals. And,\nindeed, if there were ever a case in which the Court\nought to uphold the district court on a -- under the\nabuse of discretion standard, it is this case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why should we -- if I\ncan get back to one of the factors. Why should we draw\na distinction between the -- the sole inventor who\nneeds a patent speculation firm to market his discovery\nand -- and somebody else? Why -- why should he lose\nthe leverage of the normal injunction and have\nsubstituted for that a duel of experts over what a\nreasonable royalty should be?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Because the -- because\nCongress didn't dictate that he gets that leverage in\nevery situation. And -- and it's quite possible that\nthe -- there are going to be a lot of situations. And\nthe Solicitor General's brief identifies four of them\nin which an inventor, who doesn't plan to practice the\ninvention, engages in -- in various kinds of licensing\nschemes that create all kinds of interrelationships\namong the way the patent is going to be developed, and\nI think all of those are perfectly legitimate and could\neasily justify injunctive relief in precisely the kind\nof case that you pose, Mr. Chief Justice. But that's\nnot this case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I -- maybe I\ndon't understand what it means to practice the\ninvention. If -- if I -- does that -- if -- if I\ninvent something, you know, a new -- better way to make\na car engine work and I want to sell that to somebody,\nthat's -- you'd say that's not practicing the invention\nbecause I don't build cars?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. But again, you've\nlicensed it and there are certain rights that,\nobviously, arise out of the licensing. None of these\nfactors is alone, I don't believe, sufficient to say\nyou don't get injunctive relief. But I think what the\ndistrict court said, and I think that this is why the\nCourt ought to affirm the district court's under --\nunder an abuse of discretion standard, which never been\napplied to this case -- what the Court should say is,\nlook, and where you have no practicing of the invention\nby the inventor, where you have a complete willingness\nto license not only to the world, but also to eBay\nspecifically, and where you've never sought preliminary\ninjunctive relief, under all of those -- and where --\nand where there's serious question about the lines to\nbe drawn, there's no benefit to be had by -- in the way\nof trying to eliminate the amount of litigation on an\nongoing basis, under all of those circumstances, all of\nwhich the district court identified, then it's not\nappropriate to grant injunctive relief. We'll allow\nenhanced damages in the interim and even the potential\ndown the road, obviously, of -- of an injunction to\nserve as enough of a deterrent to protect the right to\nexclude that the plaintiff has under the statute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why does the fact\nthat -- that you're not practicing the invention make a\ndifference? I mean, why -- why should I be in better\nshape, as far as getting an injunction is concerned, if\nI produce an automobile engine and -- and make some\nundeterminate profit --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- from the use of this\nparticular invention in the engine than I would be if I\nlicensed it with a royalty based upon the number of\nsales of engines? I mean, they're both risking, you\nknow, the same future use of the -- of the device. Why\n-- why does one situation justify an injunction more\nthan the other?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, I think -- I think I\nought to modify it slightly because it's not just\nsimply that you don't practice the invention. It's\nthat you're not in the market itself because that's --\nthat's the Continental Paper Bag case. You know, in\nContinental Paper Bag, they don't want to -- they don't\nwant to practice the invention either because they want\nto hold it back in order to be able effectively to use\nit. If they had wanted to license it, that would have\nmade sense too.\nBut this is not a competitor in the market.\nIf they were a -- it seems to me you have a much better\nclaim to a need to occupy space. That's what the\ninjunction is trying to say. This is my space. I want\nto occupy it. But if you choose not to occupy it, it's\nnot to say that you abandon your right to an\ninjunction, but that that ought to be a legitimate,\nindividualized consideration, among other\nconsiderations --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: By not occupying it, you\nmean including not licensing it to somebody else.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, if you didn't license it\n-- and actually we have no relevant licenses here too\n-- that would be another factor that ought to be --\nthat ought to count in the mix. Again, it's not -- I'm\nnot looking for a presumption the other way and I'm not\nlooking for categorical rules that say that if you --\nif you're a nonperforming entity, that you don't get a\nlicense, or even if you're a troll, as that term gets\nbandied around, that you're never entitled to a -- to\nan injunction.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, is -- is the troll\nthe scary thing under the bridge, or is it a fishing\ntechnique? I -- I want --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PHILLIPS: For my clients, it's been the\nscary thing under the bridge, but --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, is that what the\ntroll is?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, I believe that's the -- I\nthink that's what -- what it is, although you -- maybe\nwe should think of it more as Orks, now that we have a\nnew generation, but at this point troll is the word\nthat gets -- that gets used.\nIf there are no further questions, I'd like\nto reserve the balance of my time, Your Honors.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nPhillips.\nMr. Minear, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMR. MINEAR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe United States submits that the right to a\npatent is an important matter, but it must be\nconsidered in the context of the remedies as well.\nAnd the United States further submits the\npatentee's right to an injunction should be covered by\nthe familiar four-factor test this Court has applied in\ncases such as Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo. This\nCourt's express endorsement of the four-factor test\nwould provide disciplined guidance and a framework for\nthe lower courts to evaluate whether or not a patent\nshould issue in any particular case.\nThe court of appeals in this case did not\nmake express reference to the four-factor test.\nNevertheless, it did identify the difficulties with the\n-- the district court's decisions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't think Mr.\n-- you don't think Judge Bryson forgot about the four-\nfactor test, do you?\nMR. MINEAR: Absolutely not.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure. And -- and he\nwas just reflecting the reality that in a typical case,\nthis is what happens. It seems to me all you want us\nto do is edit his opinion and stick in this formulaic\nparagraph about there are four factors and here they\nare.\nMR. MINEAR: Not exactly, Your Honor. We\nthink that there is some legitimate confusion among the\npatent bar and in the community about whether or not\nthis test issues nearly automatically or not.\nCertainly there are many amicus briefs on both sides.\nAnd we think it's useful for this Court to make clear\nthat this is an exercise of equitable discretion.\nNow, Judge Bryson, I think, was aware of the\nfour-factor test. In fact, both parties cited the\nfour-factor test before the district court.\nHe was also aware of the abuse of discretion\nstandard. That's a well-established standard and the\nparties cited that standard to the Federal Circuit in\nthe course of briefing this case below.\nBut what we think this Court can do is it can\nprovide guidance on how those factors are applied in\nthe patent context in this very important area. We\nthink the court of appeals decision is correct. The\njudgment is correct. But we think that there's some\nbenefit to this Court explaining why that is so, and\nI'd like to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I ask you about\none factor in particular? What if by the time you get\nto the injunction stage, the -- the patent office has,\nyou know, rejected all of the underlying claims in a\npreliminary way? It's not final. Can the district\ncourt take that into account in deciding not to issue\nan injunction?\nMR. MINEAR: Well, I think, Your Honor,\nyou're referring to the reexamination process\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMR. MINEAR: -- that, in fact, is ongoing in\nthis case. And we think merely that the Patent and\nTrademark Office's office action is not sufficient. In\nthis case, if I can speak outside the record, there has\nbeen what is called a first office action and a second\noffice action, but no final action by the PTO. But\neven if there was final action by the PTO, that would\nstill be subject to review by an administrative body,\nthe Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences, and\nthere would be further judicial review. The PTO would\nnot withdraw the patent, would not certify that it's\ninvalid until the conclusion of the judicial process.\nSo we think for that reason the district\ncourt should not act precipitously. It may have -- the\ndistrict court would have discretion to take that into\naccount, whether it should stay further proceedings\npending the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's what\nstruck me as odd there. Footnote 27 says that's a\nbasis for staying the injunction. It seems to me if\nit's a basis for staying the injunction, it's a basis\nnot to issue one in the first place.\nMR. MINEAR: Well, it also might be a -- a\nbasis in terms of how to structure the injunction. We\nsimply meant to indicate in footnote 27 the district\ncourt has discretion on remand to take these factors\ninto account based on where the case is at that time.\nWe're not taking a position one way or another what the\nCourt should do in this particular case. That is an\nexercise of discretion. It's subject to review for\nabuse of discretion.\nBut I would like to talk about the four\nindividual factors in this case because I think it\nprovides helpful guidance in the resolution of the\ndispute before the Court.\nAs an initial matter, with regard to\nirreparable injury, patent infringement normally will\nresult in irreparable injury because it denies the\npatent holder its statutory right to exclude others\nfrom practicing the invention. It's the type of right\nthat is susceptible to irreparable injury because --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it denies the right\nsubject to being a damage remedy that's available.\nMR. MINEAR: That's correct, but the\ndifficulty here is the pragmatic question of whether\nthe district court can determine whether damages are\nappropriate or not in a particular case.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is it always -- is it\nalways going to be irreparable injury if the patentee\nalways gets fairly compensated?\nMR. MINEAR: No. There -- we certainly\nrecognize there can be cases where there would not be\nirreparable --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So if there are some cases\nwhen he gets fairly compensated and some he does not,\nwhy should you say it's always irreparable injury?\nMR. MINEAR: Well, my -- our position is not\nthat it's always, but that it normally is irreparable\ninjury. It usually will be. And there are certainly\ncircumstances we can envision where it would not be\nirreparable injury.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is that usually will be\nbecause usually damages are not an adequate remedy?\nMR. MINEAR: Yes, that's correct. And the\nreason why damages are not an adequate remedy is\nbecause, as Judge Easterbrook indicated, it's very\ndifficult for the district court, looking forward, to\ndetermine what business opportunities are available to\nthe -- to the licensor or the practitioner in the face\nof the prospect of continuing infringement. And that\nis why, as Judge Easterbrook noted in the Catheter\ncase, the injunction harnesses the market to determine\nwhat the market value of that patent is. It forces\nnegotiation between the parties, as compared to the\ncourt acting to try and develop a reasonable royalty\nbased on a battle of experts.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: When you say going forward,\nI thought we were talking about damages for the past\nviolation, not damages for future violations which will\ncontinue. Are we talking about that too?\nMR. MINEAR: Yes, that's what we're talking\nabout.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: About the court effectively\nsaying, yes, here pay him and -- and go on and skip\naway and continue violating it.\nMR. MINEAR: Well, when a district court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In this case, they -- they\nclaim not to want to violate it in the future. They're\njust talking about, you know, the -- the past actions\nshould -- should be compensable by damages and not --\nthey should not be subjected to a very threatening\ninjunction.\nMR. MINEAR: Yes, but in this case the\ndistrict court has awarded the damages for the past --\npast actions already, and the question is how will we\ndeal with the threat of continuing infringement. And\nthe difficulty that the district court faces here is it\nhas to, if it takes no action, as it's done now, it\nwill at some later date have to go back and determine\nwhat those damages would be.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which -- when they will be\ncalculable. You're saying it's hard to calculate them\ninto the future. You want the district court to\ncalculate what the future damages will be and say, we\nthink the damages will be this. Here, take your money,\nand you, God bless you, go continue to violate the\npatent.\nMR. MINEAR: Absolutely not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that what --\nMR. MINEAR: We are suggesting what Justice\nKennedy suggested; namely, that the injunction\nproceedings provide an opportunity to determine whether\nor not the supposed work-around that eBay has will work\nor will not, and the injunction will be structured to\nallow it or not, depending on whether or not it's\ndetermined to be infringing. That allows the market to\ngo forward with a determination, a certainty that eBay\nwill have that its work-around is either violative or\nit is not. But our view is that by issuing the\ninjunction, the district court, in the proceedings\nleading up to the injunction, can determine whether or\nnot this work-around is valid or not.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there a classic case\nwhere the injunction should not be issued?\nMR. MINEAR: Yes. There -- I think there --\nthis is a four-factor test, and there are questions of\nbalance of hardship and public interest. And certainly\nequity should be cautious not to inflict unnecessary\nhardship on parties. In the case of a nonwillful\ninfringer, for instance, that has made good faith\ninvestments that might be set aside by the -- by an\ninjunction, there might be grounds in those\ncircumstances not to issue an injunction. There's also\na public interest inquiry as well. If the injunction\nwould threaten national security, public health and\nsafety, undermine core aspects of commerce --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Business processes?\nMR. MINEAR: Well, business processes are not\n-- the district court clearly erred here in saying that\nthe mere debate about business process patents is a\nreason for withholding injunctions. That simply is not\na sufficient view -- reason in our mind for weighing\nagainst the general public interest and the\nenforceability of patents and the use of injunctions to\nmake sure that those property rights are secure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm curious about\nyour nonwillful infringer. You're devaluing the value\nof a particular patent by denying the injunction simply\nbecause the people who infringed it weren't willful,\nand I wonder why that makes sense.\nMR. MINEAR: We're not suggesting that\nautomatically that there is withhold with relief\nbecause of a nonwillful infringement. We're simply\ndrawing the -- the distinction between a case, such as\nthis, where there is willful infringement -- and, in\nfact, the party has been found to have both had notice\nof the patent and also have known that it did not --\ndid not have a reasonable basis for concluding it was\nnot infringing or the patent was invalid. In those\ncircumstances, the patentee takes on greater risk than\nthe party that simply is not aware of the -- of the\npatent and in a sense stepped over a property line\nwithout realizing that, in fact, it was there.\nThis is, again, a four-factor test, and we\nbelieve all factors need to be considered in order to\nprovide the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is it your bottom line\nthen, send it back with your four-factor test, because\nthere seems to be some uncertainty whether that was\napplied?\nMR. MINEAR: We don't think that's\nappropriate because, first of all, the -- the court of\nappeals did identify the factors the district court\nrelied on that weighed on -- it thought weighed on\neBay's side of the balance, and it properly rejected\neach one of those.\nBut furthermore, we think that this Court's\nenunciation of the tests and the application of the\ntests, much as it did in the patent case of Pfaff v.\nWells Electronics 3 years ago, could provide very\nuseful guidance in terms of how this test applies in a\nspecific, concrete context.\nBut the factors that the court of appeals\nrelied on here and rejected, found insufficient were\nreally quite right. First of all, there should not be\nan automatic distinction between a party that practices\nthe patent and one that licenses it. They both have --\nJUSTICE BREYER: There isn't an automatic\ndistinction, but a person who licenses a patent and who\nis licensing a patent that probably won't be developed\nvery much beyond what it is -- it's fairly easy to --\nI'll ask Mr. Waxman.\nMR. MINEAR: Thank you, Your Honor.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nMinear.\nMr. Waxman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI -- I can anticipate at least one question.\nLet me just say at the outset --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WAXMAN: -- that long, perhaps centuries,\nbefore Justice Story ever wrote his commentaries on\nequity, it has been firmly, unequivocally established\nthat a final judgment, not -- we're not talking about\nan interlocutory order, but a final judgment of patent\ninfringement yields an injunction in all but the very\nrare case. And that settled regime is not an exception\nto traditional equitable principles. It's an\napplication of those principles.\nEquity, as this Court has reminded us over\nand over again, including in the Weinberger and the\nAmoco cases -- equity first takes account of the nature\nof both the right at stake and the violation. And\nbecause the only right that a patent provides under\nU.S. law is a limited-term right to exclude others from\npracticing the invention, infringement produces an\ninjury that is both, A, irreparable by its nature and,\nB, continuing in the nature of a continuing trespass to\nchattels. And under traditional equity principles, a\nshowing of either of those things, either irreparable\ninjury or a continuing harm, warrants an injunction in\nthe owner's favor unless the offending party can\nmarshal very strong equities otherwise. That is the\nsettled rule.\nNow, no such showing could be made in this\ncase. The jury found, by clear and convincing\nevidence, that eBay had willfully infringed the '265\npatent, that it knew about it, and it had no good faith\nbelief either that the patent was invalid or that it\nwas not infringing. The jury was told that if it found\neither of those things, it could not find willfulness,\nand it found willfulness by clear and convincing\nevidence.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We also know by now\nthat the patent office has rejected all of the claims\nof the patent. The staff.\nMR. WAXMAN: The -- what we know is that --\nthat is correct, Mr. Chief Justice, with the following\nclarification, that the office action, as Mr. Minear\nhas indicated, represents a -- an initial judgment by a\nstaff member in the office.\nAnd what -- what is quite -- and it is --\ndoesn't represent even the PTO's final judgment in the\ncase, but what is really revealing here is that\nreexamination is a process that was invoked by eBay.\nAnd as we point out in our brief, typically if a\ncompetitor is concerned or doubts the validity of a\npatent, it will invoke reexamination, ask the PTO to\nreexamine it when it first learns about it. eBay not\nonly didn't invoke reexamination, it cited the '265\npatent at least 24 times years before. It then came to\nMercExchange and offered to buy it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that a factor that\na district court could take into account in deciding\nwhether to issue an injunction?\nMR. WAXMAN: I don't --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Say the injunction\nquestion came up right now, today. Could the district\ncourt say, well, the patent office staff has rejected\nevery claim of this patent, and I'm going to take that\ninto account in deciding whether to put eBay out of\nbusiness?\nMR. WAXMAN: I think that -- the case that\nthe U.S. cites in its footnote is an example where\nreexamination processes are underway when the case is\nfirst filed or when it's pending in the district court,\nand the district judge certainly has the discretion to\nsay, I don't want to get into a -- a fight here about\nseparation of powers and Hayburns case. Let's let the\nreexam proceed, and then we'll have a trial.\nIn this case, eBay waited not only until it\nwas sued and not only until it was found to have\nwillfully infringed this patent, but in the middle of\nthe appeals process. It then comes running in and a\nrule that would allow a district judge now to give\nnotice of that in denying an injunction would basically\nbe a -- an open invitation for everybody to go ahead\nand try and win at trial, go through the whole multi-\nyear process, and if you don't, just put it into\nreexam. This -- although the reexamination is required\nto be -- is required to proceed with, quote, special\ndispatch under the statute, this reexamination of the\n'265 patent has been almost 3 years in the patent\noffice and we still don't have a final action.\nSo we think, in the circumstances of this\ncase, where the district judge had no reason to\nconsider reexam because eBay hadn't invoked reexam at\nthe time, it would be an abuse of discretion for the\ncourt to either refuse an injunction or stay it in\nlight of the fact that it's now proceeding.\nBut that's not an issue for this Court. It\nwasn't an issue for the court of appeals because it\nwasn't part of the district judge's analysis of the\nrequisite equitable factors.\nAnd what -- if I can just get back to the\nfacts of this particular case and then talk about the\nlaw. The finding of eBay's willfulness in this case\ndisables eBay from invoking the relative balance of\nharms. We certainly agree --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why? I mean, I think there\nare so many factors that could enter into it.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What I was going to ask was\nif you have a -- a patentee that does only license and,\nmoreover, licenses only to people who, by and large,\nwill not take that product and develop it further, then\nit's fairly easy to calculate damages.\nNow, couple that with a client or a patentee\nwho also waits for a long time, waits till the\ninvention is embedded in a series of other inventions\nso that if, in fact, there's an injunction, what will\nhappen is that the patentee will be able to extract far\nmore than this particular invention is worth because\nthe infringer would have to give up the entire\ninvention.\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Couple that with a patent\nthat, if you read it on page 2 of the red brief,\nreminds, at least one person who read it, namely me,\nthat if this could be patented, maybe A&P could patent\ntheir process for a supermarket. I -- I mean, you'd\nworry about that as a judge. And couple that with all\nthe other things that are here.\nNow, special case? Why not?\nMR. WAXMAN: I've been asked to couple so\nmany things together, I may forget some of the\ncoupling. Please -- I mean this in seriousness.\nPlease remind me because there is a very good answer in\nlaw and on the record to each of your points.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The main point -- what I was\ntrying to do is I was trying to take what I'd call the\npatent troll case.\nMR. WAXMAN: Okay. First of all, this is no\npatent troll. The founder of MercExchange really did\ninvent this innovation. He really did, as the record\nclearly shows, spend years of effort trying to build\nthe system to suit himself, and he is no promiscuous\nlicensor. He has -- it has entered into licenses,\nwhich are all in the joint appendix, that are very\nspecialized in terms. He was asked by eBay in 2000 to\nconsider selling them. He offered to license them.\nThe parties couldn't come to terms, and eBay then stole\nthe technology. It willfully infringed it, knowing\nabout it, having cited this as prior art, having had\none patent rejected as fully anticipated by the '265.\nAnd the common law and equitable principles\nhave -- are quite clear from Story, Pomeroy, all the\nway back, that when you -- when you're talking about\nbalancing private harms, which is what equity courts do\n-- I'm not talking about the public interest, but I\nmean private harms, when you have an adjudicated,\nwillful infringer -- I mean, the jury found that it had\nno good faith belief either that it wasn't infringing\nor that the patent was invalid -- you don't balance\nprivate harms.\nBut let's take the case in which you don't\nhave willfulness. It's not this case. Let's take the\ncase of somebody who doesn't try and, quote, practice\nthe patent. That's not this case. Let's take the case\nof somebody who's a garage inventor who decides the way\nto exploit the patent is to license it. License --\nthis -- so far as I'm aware, this is the first case.\nThe district court decision in this case is the first\ncase in the context of a permanent injunction. And\nI'll explain why preliminary injunctions that seek to\npreserve the status quo are different. This is the\nfirst permanent injunction case I'm aware of that has\never thought that exploiting the patent by licensing it\nto others to make use of would in -- somehow be costly\nor disable you from obtaining the relief that section\n283 and the -- and tradition provided.\nSection -- section 284, which is the damages\nprovision, talks about remedies, remedies for\ninfringement that has already occurred.\nThe text of section 283 says -- the other\nside keeps referring to may, may, may not, shall.\nThat's fine. But the purpose of it is to prevent. The\noperative word in 283 is to prevent. And unless there\nis an instance in which the patent has expired, the --\nthe infringer is out of business and can show that it\ncouldn't possibly infringe anymore, an injunction\nissues to prevent further violation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: On that very point, my\nquestion there really was -- that was the heart of it\n-- that I don't think there's a moral or even patent-\nrelated value attached to whether you practice it\nyourself or not. It's just that when you license it,\nit's easier -- and a lot of other things matter too.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But it's easier to calculate\nthe damage. Now, at least in some subset of cases.\nSo if you have a case where, on the one hand,\nit's easier to calculate the damage remedy, and at the\nsame time you fear that to issue an injunction will\nproduce a harm to the other side way out of proportion\nto, in fact, the value that's being lost by infringing\non the patent, then those are two things you'd put in\nthe balance.\nMR. WAXMAN: That's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So the -- other things being\nequal --\nMR. WAXMAN: In the case of a nonwillful\ninfringer, a court in --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. Willful, willful. It\nwouldn't matter willful or nonwillful, because if he's\nwillful, the reason that he might be willful is he\nthinks that the patentee is holding him up.\nMR. WAXMAN: You know, the -- the -- there\nare 52 self-proclaimed intellectual property professors\nthat filed a brief written by Professor Lemley in\nsupport of eBay in this case. Professor Lemley\ntestified under oath to Congress that, even though\nthere are problems with patent trolls, in the case of a\nwillful infringer, the law -- equity doesn't balance\nprivate harms.\nBut even if that were wrong, I acknowledge\nthat in balancing, there may be cases in which you can\nshow a vastly disproportionate harm. Okay? I mean,\nthe other side has amicus briefs that come up with\nthese hypothetical scenarios about, you know, one\nlittle aspect of a computer chip that has 30,000\ncomponents to it. Note, A, that all of those are\nhypothetical, and B, I'll explain why it's a problem of\nextremely limited circumstances.\nBut, of course, equity courts can decide\nthat, just as they can decide whether the -- the,\nquote, innocent patent holder is guilty of laches,\nunclean hands, estoppel, all of these other equitable\nconsiderations that aren't captured by this formulaic\nfour-factor test but that equity courts, including\ndistrict courts sitting under -- under 283, consider.\nBut this is not the case of some profligate\nlicensor. This is somebody who has licensed with\nspecific provisions. The other side says, well, there\nare no operative licenses, suggesting somehow that the\nAutoTrader license, which is one of our examples, is in\nfact invalid. That came up in their reply brief. It\nis not correct. It is absolutely true that eBay will\nnot -- the '265 patent is included by that license. It\nrelates to the field of use of auto sales. It provides\nspecifically that eBay -- that MercExchange cannot\nreceive royalties unless it enforces this patent within\nthe field of use. There is no doubt that -- that\nMercExchange will not be able to start getting patent\nroyalties from AutoTrader unless and until it obtains\nthis injunction. And for example --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Waxman, you\nmentioned, in -- in responding to the suggestion that\nwe're dealing with a troll, you described -- what\nexactly is the invention here?\nMR. WAXMAN: The -- the invention is a --\nit's -- it's not a business method. It doesn't claim\nmethods. It claims a system, an apparatus for an\nelectric market for the sale of goods via a network.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Electric. I mean,\nit's not like --\nMR. WAXMAN: Electronic market.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- he invented the,\nyou know, internal combustion engine or anything. It's\nvery vague I think, and this is one of the\nconsiderations --\nMR. WAXMAN: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the district court\nmentioned. The exact parameters of when it was going\nto be infringed and when it wasn't were amorphous. And\nso isn't that a factor the district court can take into\naccount in deciding whether to issue an injunction\nbecause it's going to be hard to issue an injunction to\ndefine exactly when it's going to be violated and when\nit's not?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, if it\nturns out that it's too hard and -- and the -- and a\nspecific injunction can't be written, rule 65(d)\nrequires that an injunction not issue. And in fact, as\nwe've cited in pages 17 and 18 and, I think, 19 of our\nbrief, the Federal Circuit has, in fact, overruled\ninjunctions that were insufficiently precise to satisfy\nrule 65.\nBut the claim of imprecision here is -- look,\nI'm not a software developer and I have reason to\nbelieve that neither is Your Honor, and I -- I can't --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WAXMAN: -- explain specifically what\nthis claims. It's laid out very carefully in --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I may not be a\nsoftware developer, but as I read the invention, it's\ndisplaying pictures of your wares on a computer network\nand, you know, picking which ones you want and buying\nthem. I -- I might have been able to do that.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WAXMAN: I'll say respectfully that that\nis not a fair characterization of the innovation here,\nthe actual innovation.\nBut let me just say, for purposes of this\ncase, there is no challenge continuing to the validity\nof this patent. It was challenged before the district\ncourt and on appeal on grounds of an inadequate written\ndescription, et cetera, et cetera, and upheld. There\nwas a Markman hearing in which the district court\nconstrued the patent, added certain claim limitation\nterms that eBay wanted and we thought were not fairly\nin it. But significantly, there was never -- never --\na claim to the judge -- and this is an issue for the\njudge under section 112, paragraph 2 -- of -- of\ninvalidity for indefiniteness.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the patent\noffice staff has rejected all the claims. I don't know\non what grounds.\nMR. WAXMAN: The patent office -- none of the\nclaims have been rejected on indefinite grounds. They\nhave been rejected, as I understand it, certainly in\nthis patent, for obviousness under prior art, which is\nall the same prior art that was presented to an Article\nIII court here and that a jury entered a finding on.\nThere are a host of questions that undoubtedly will be\npresented in the case, if it ever happens, in which a\nfinal -- Patent and Trademark Office, on the validity\nof a patent, contravenes something that a -- a final\njudgment of an Article III court. But that's not this\ncase.\nAnd we certainly agree with the United States\nthat when -- if the judgment is affirmed, the case will\ngo back and the district court will then have to\naddress a point it hasn't addressed yet, which is is\nthe -- is the -- the permanent injunction proposed by\nMercExchange adequate or inadequate and how can it be\nmade specific, and this supposed work-around -- does it\nor doesn't it violate the terms of the injunction. I\nmean, the district judge actually found bad faith --\nthis is page, I think, 71 of the petition appendix --\nof eBay in its conduct in the district court of\nproclaiming that for $8,000 -- its experts testified\nthat for $8,000, they could work around or design\naround this problem and there wouldn't be an\ninfringement. But they didn't do it. And they didn't\n-- they certainly didn't appear to have done it in the\nFederal Circuit because their brief in the Federal\nCircuit never mentions it, and the Federal Circuit\nopinion surely would have said, they've designed around\nthis problem and, you know, therefore this, that, or\nthe other. Even in this Court, eBay has said in its --\nin its opening brief at page 43, here there is a\npossibility that the infringer can develop a work-\naround. Well --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Waxman, could you help\nme with something I just realized I have no conception\nof here? What kind of -- what do these injunctions\nsay? Do they just say don't infringe patent '265\nanymore, or do they give a list of things you cannot do\nand a list of articles you cannot make and so forth?\nMR. WAXMAN: You couldn't just say don't\ninfringe anymore because rule 65(d) requires\nspecificity and precision. Ordinarily what happens in\nthese cases is there's -- you know, there's usually\nbeen a claimed -- a detailed, claimed construction\nfollowing a Markman hearing. There have been jury\ninstructions. The jury instructions have to\nspecifically describe to the jury on what basis it's to\nconclude who is right --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The thought just occurs to\nme and I -- frankly, with all the briefs we've had, I\nfeel kind of stupid not to have thought it before. But\nit seems to me a great difference might turn on what\nexactly the injunction provided. Some injunctions must\nbe -- might be much more burdensome than some others.\nIf they're not all fungible, that's certainly true.\nMR. WAXMAN: Certainly not. And the terms of\nan injunction are appealable, and the Federal Circuit\nhas reviewed actual terms of permanent injunctions and\nreversed a number of them and said this is -- this\ndoesn't satisfy rule 65 or it doesn't meet other\nrequirements.\nBut in the -- in the context of this case, it\nis so critical that the judgment be affirmed, not\nvacated, because this is a real inventor. This is\nsomebody who really did try to put it in place. This\nis somebody who eBay approached and then, when they\ndidn't buy it, appropriated the technology, and the\nvalidity and infringement are final. They aren't even\nchallenged in this Court.\nAnd any suggestion that uncertainty exists on\nthe facts of this case would dramatically destabilize\nsettled law, licensing practices, and the investment-\nbacked expectations of patent holders, large and small,\nthe sole -- you know, hall of fame inventors that are\nin the Cooper brief filed in support of us and big,\nintegrated companies like GE and Johnson & Johnson that\nhave also filed on our side.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this?\nMR. WAXMAN: These are patent portfolios --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: One -- one short question.\nIs the draft of the injunction that you want in the\nrecord?\nMR. WAXMAN: It is in the court of appeals\nrecord, but not the joint appendix. But it certainly\nwill have to be changed because the court of appeals\ninvalidated the '176 patent, which the jury found had\nbeen infringed, and therefore, it's -- it will need to\nbe revisited when the case goes back for the entry of\nan injunction.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nWaxman.\nMr. Phillips, you have 6 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI realize I'm the only thing standing between you and\nlunch, so I'll try to be brief at this point.\nJustice Stevens, with respect to the place in\nthe record, this is in the joint appendix and the court\nof appeals at A6523 -- 62523. That's the proposed\npermanent injunction, and I won't purport to read the\nwhole thing, but it starts off with anything directly\nor indirectly, and it goes on for three pages. It is,\nI think, fairly characterized as a very broad\ninjunction.\nThe -- I think it's important, after Mr.\nWaxman's challenge to the conduct of eBay in this case,\nto -- to recognize that willfulness in the patent\ncontext has a meaning different from willfulness in any\nother context. And it is recognized that we're talking\nabout simply a failure to satisfy a duty to check out\nand find a lawyer's opinion that a particular\ninfringement has not taken place or that the patent is\nnot valid. And when you do that, you of course incur\nthe risk that you will also waive your attorney-client\nprivilege. So there's a risk to it. And that's the\nwillfulness that we're talking about here.\nWith respect to the notion of stealing this\npatent, let's go back to what the district court\nspecifically held on page 68 of the appendix. Where\nthe defendants maintain that their success did not\narise from the use of anything contained in the\nplaintiff's patents and the defendants argued that the\npatents offered no business or engineering guidance\nwhich the defendants could copy, and this court agrees\nwith that. That's not the kind of bad faith or\nwillfulness -- it's the reason why the court didn't\ngrant enhanced damages. It's the reason why the court\ndidn't grant attorney's fees in this particular case,\nand it doesn't provide a reason for simply jettisoning\nthree out of the four factors that ought to be applied\nin the traditional -- in the traditional test.\nAnd, Justice Breyer, you asked the question,\nwhat are you going to do with a situation where you\nhave the embedded patent and you have the case like\nthis one where we're going along with our process and\nwe've got our source code and we've done all of the\nhard work, and they go along and come up with some sort\nof more vague idea and show up at our doorstep and,\none, claim that we've got to stop doing what we're\ndoing, or, worse in other cases, we're going to find\nsituations where it's embedded in a manufacturing\nprocess. Mr. Waxman says, well, in that situation\nequity will step in. Not so under the Federal\nCircuit's approach because that's a balance of the\nequities kind of a consideration, and that's\nirrebuttably presumed to favor the plaintiff under the\nFederal Circuit's approach.\nMr. Chief Justice, I know, as well as you\nknow, that Judge Bryson understands the four-factor\ntest and the abuse of discretion standard. And what he\ndid in this case was to go through each of the findings\nof the district court with respect to the use of the --\nof the licensing arrangements, the failure to\ncommercialize this, not being in the business, and\nsaid, does any of these rise to the level of the kind\nof public interest concern that is the only legitimate\nconsideration this court will use in deciding whether\nor not the district court can justify not granting an\ninjunction in a particular case, instead of what is\nclearly the traditional approach of equity, which is to\nsay, look at the -- the primary two issues, you know,\nthe flip side of the same thing, so I'll just treat it\nthe one way. Are money damages adequate in the\nspecific case? That's the fundamental question that\nequity asks. That's the fundamental question that the\ndistrict court found to be satisfied in this case.\nMoney damages will get the job done. The right to\nexclude will be adequately protected by enhanced\ndamages and even potentially injunctive relief in the\nfuture. Beyond that, nothing more is required.\nThat's the kind of decision that a district\ncourt who has sat in a 5-week trial and has overseen\nthis entire litigation is uniquely suited to make a\njudgment. That judgment is entitled to respect on a\nclassic abuse of discretion standard. The court of\nappeals long ago jettisoned that approach, and the time\nhas come for this Court to say no, that's not what this\nPatent Act requires. The Patent Act says the right to\nexclude is important, but it's only protected by the\nprinciples of equity under section 283. That wasn't\ngiven here. We urge you to reverse the court of\nappeals.\nIf there are no further questions, thank you,\nYour Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
