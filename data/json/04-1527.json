        "content": "[11:34 a.m.]\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in S. D. Warren Company versus Maine Board of\nEnvironmental Protection.\nMr. Kayatta.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM J. KAYATTA, JR.,\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. KAYATTA: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it -\n- and may it please the Court:\nThe Presumpscot River is a single body of\nwater, as that term was used in last year's Miccosukee\ndecision. Warren's position is that the flowing of\nthat single body of water through Warren's five dams is\nnot a discharge into that same single body of water.\nIn arguing that certification under section 401 of the\nClean Water Act is, therefore, not required, we are not\nmaintaining that the State either has, or should have,\nno voice on matters of water quality in connection with\nthe relicensing of these dams.\nIn 1986, Congress took care to ensure States\na forceful, but not controlling, voice on environmental\nissues, including water quality issues, in all\nhydropower relicensing proceedings. Congress was very\nspecific about its intent in 1986, and it intended to\ngive States a strong voice, but not a veto. So, we\nfeel the case -- that the States clearly have that\nvoice.\nNow --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Kayatta, if I\ntook a drum of water out of the river and put it in the\ngarage next to the river for 5 years, and, 5 years\nlater, came out and poured that drum of water back into\nthe river, is that a discharge into the river?\nMR. KAYATTA: Yes, that would be a discharge\ninto the river.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is it different\nhere, where you have the dam restraining the waters for\na certain period, and then it's being released later,\nat a subsequent time? Why --\nMR. KAYATTA: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- isn't that also a\ndischarge?\nMR. KAYATTA: There is -- we draw a\ndistinction -- and I'm referring just to discharge, I'm\nnot addressing the issue that the Court could get to in\nanother case of whether you actually need a discharge\nof a pollutant, as to just a discharge into the river -\n- we draw a distinction between actually removing\nsomething entirely from the river, exercising control\nover it. Your hypothetical, Mr. Chief Justice, had it\nfor 5 years. In that situation, one could say that\nthere may be a discharge into the river when an\nactivity is proposed to pour that back into the river.\nIn a -- in the dams -- the dams, the water\ncontinuously flows down. The water never leaves the\nsingle body of water called the Presumpscot. And\nthat's the distinction that we would draw.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though it's\nretained in a -- what -- an impoundment pool, or\nwhatever, behind --\nMR. KAYATTA: Well, the dams slow down the\nwater as it comes down the Presumpscot. And because\nthe dams slow down the water, then the river widens in\nan area called an impoundment area. But the -- there\nis a continuous motion leaving the dam in the same\namount of water that comes into the area above the dam.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, this --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, you think it's a\ndifferent case if it's not a continuous motion; in\nother words, that the water is released -- you know,\nit's released on the weekends, but, during the week, it\nhas to build up in the -- you would draw a distinction\nand say there's a discharge, in that case?\nMR. KAYATTA: Mr. Chief Justice, the\ndistinction we would draw would be when the exercise\nover the water, and the separation of the water from\nthe river, reach the point where it could be said that\nwe're no longer dealing with one unitary body of water,\nas that term is defined in Miccosukee. If we --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But this is an important\npoint for me, and I wasn't quite clear what the briefs\ntold me about it. My understanding was that there is\nan argument that when the water stays in the reservoir,\nthe impoundment area, that there's a stratification,\nand the oxygen components at different levels change,\nso that when the water goes back into the dam, it's\nqualitatively different. It's the same water, in a\nsense, but it's also qualitatively different in its\noxygen and other characteristics. And that sounded to\nme like a discharge.\nMR. KAYATTA: Yes. The -- there is -- there\nis no dispute that when one changes the movement of\nwater and its flow, then characteristics of the water\ncan change. For example, in the impoundment area you\ncan have not a change, overall, of temperature, but a\nstratification of warmer water going to the top, colder\nwater going to the bottom. Similarly, you can have\nchanges in other aspects of the water. All of those\nhave been classified by the EPA as nonpoint source\npollution. And it is undisputed that 401 does not\ncover nonpoint source solution -- pollution. So --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So, if --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But is it --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So, if it were established\nin this case that the water is qualitatively changed in\na significant degree because of its oxygen component,\nthat would be irrelevant to the question you're asking?\nMR. KAYATTA: The water, as it comes into the\ndam and in the impoundment area, there is a -- there\nare findings, that we are not here challenging, that\nthat water changes as it comes into the impoundment\narea. The discharge of that water -- that water then\nflows through the dam on its way down the river. There\nis nothing -- there is no nexus between the water\nexiting the dam and any of the changes that Your Honor\nhas pointed to.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying the changes\noccur in the river, above the dam; and, therefore,\nwhat's left -- what's let back into the river below the\ndam is the same river, unchanged.\nMR. KAYATTA: We're saying that the river\nflows continuously down. It changes at various points\nas it goes down a river. As it goes through rapids, a\nriver changes. The nature of a river changes as it\ngoes over rapids. As it comes --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Now, let me just be sure I\nunderstand one point fully. But the character of the\nwater is different above the dam and below the dam.\nMR. KAYATTA: No. The character of the water\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I thought you agreed that\nthere was a different -- a different oxygen content in\nthe water.\nMR. KAYATTA: The water -- take the -- Mr.\nChief Justice's barrel of water that has not been\nremoved from the river -- it comes down the river. It\nchanges as it goes down the river. It is potentially\nchanged in the impoundment area. It then flows through\nthe dam.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No.\nMR. KAYATTA: The same water that went into\nthe dam --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but it's the same\nwater, with a slightly different chemical composition,\nisn't that true?\nMR. KAYATTA: It's the same water that went\ninto the dam as comes out of the dam.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But with a slightly\ndifferent chemical composition.\nMR. KAYATTA: Than it was further --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Am I correct --\nMR. KAYATTA: -- up the river.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- when I say that?\nMR. KAYATTA: Yes, you are.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you said -- in response\nto Justice Kennedy's question, you said that there was\nnothing, I think, as you put it, in the exiting of the\nwater that was significantly different that -- or that\nwe could peg as significantly different. But that\nseems to me to be at odds with your answer to the Chief\nJustice's question about the barrel, because the\nexiting of the water from the barrel and the exiting of\nthe water from the dam are exactly the same. And if\none is a discharge, I don't see why the other isn't a\ndischarge.\nMR. KAYATTA: Well, the difference, we would\nsay, is that, in the barrel hypothetical, the water has\nbeen -- the water that is put into the river from the\nbarrel that has been in someone's garage for 5 years --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then it isn't the exiting\nthat you're getting at. And I --\nMR. KAYATTA: Well, we --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, it seems to me --\nand I don't want to make a joke, but I think you're on\nto something when you talk about the exiting, because\nthe word \"discharge,\" as we commonly use it, is a word\nthat describes how you get rid of something. And how\nyou get rid of something, it seems to me, is exactly\nthe same, whether you're pouring the barrel over the\nbank or whether pouring the barrel, as it were, through\nthe turbine after impounding it, it is the --\neverybody's been quoting dictionary definitions -- it's\nthe \"flowing out.\" The flowing out is the same with\nthe barrel as it is with the dam.\nMR. KAYATTA: The difference --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And that seems to me where I\nhave trouble with your argument.\nMR. KAYATTA: Yes, Justice Souter. The\ndifference is the \"discharge into.\" To have something\n\"discharge into the river,\" you need something\ndifferent than the river to go into the river.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, as I understand it, in\nsome or all of these dams, at the point of discharge,\nthere isn't any river down there. It's dry. It's --\nthe bed, in effect, has been deprived of the river by\nthe impoundment, so that you're not simply, as it were,\ntaking, you know, one spoonful out here and dropping it\ninto a river -- putting the spoonful back into a river\nthat's flowing there, because it isn't flowing there,\nas a result of your dam.\nMR. KAYATTA: But the -- if you accept the\nproposition that the river is divided into two\ndifferent things, then you can start to talk about a\ndischarge of one thing into the other. But Miccosukee\nmakes clear that the structure of a dam does not keep\nus from viewing this as a single body of water which\nflows through a dam. It does not flow \"into the\nnavigable waters\"; the navigable waters themselves flow\nthrough the dam.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Miccosukee assumed that --\nthe soup ladle example from the Second Circuit; you\ntook out the ladle, you held it up, and you put the\nsame thing back. But if I understand what happens as a\nresult of the impoundment of the water and then its\nrelease, what comes out is quite different from what\nwas put in. It's kind of like you had a pot boiling\nwith vegetables, and then you put it through a food\nprocessor, and then what you got out would be quite\ndifferent from what went into the food processor.\nMR. KAYATTA: Yes. And, again, we don't\ndispute that there are nonpoint source changes in the\nwater as it flows down the river, before it goes\nthrough the dam. The water that then goes in and emits\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the descriptions\nthat we had was, it is a result of the impoundment and\nthe subsequent release that the water emerges in this\nunnatural state, in this striated state that Justice\nKennedy was referring to.\nMR. KAYATTA: Yes. The -- it is the\nimpoundment that changes the nature of the water.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And not the release. You\ncontest that the release makes any change.\nMR. KAYATTA: The release simply continues\nthe flow of that water, albeit however it has been\nchanged by mechanisms other than discharges into the\nriver.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's true, but --\nso, you said it's conceded in this case? I thought, in\nanswer to Justice Kennedy, you said something that -- I\nwas surprised, if it's conceded. I thought it wasn't\nconceded -- tell me if I'm wrong -- that the States\nhave water quality standards. Those water quality\nstandards may or may not have something to do with\npoint source discharges. They don't have to. They\nwant water to be good enough for recreation. They want\nwater without algae so there are more fish. They have\na lot of things. And this statute seems to say the F-\n-- what used to be the FPC. I -- is it now FERC?\nMR. KAYATTA: Yes, it is, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, okay -- used to be the\nFederal Power Commission -- tells them, \"You have to\nget approval to build your dam. And we're not going to\ngive you approval unless you comply with State water\nquality standards.\" This seems to me to go back into\nancient history, like 1920. And of course you have to\ncomply. And so, isn't the purpose of -- is there\nagreement that it only concerns point discharges, or\ndoes it concern water quality standards?\nMR. KAYATTA: The consistent position of the\nEPA all along has been that 401 requires a discharge\nfrom a point source before it applies.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Really?\nMR. KAYATTA: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: In other words -- discharge\nfrom a point source, what is -- well, then EPA concedes\nyou win?\nMR. KAYATTA: No. EPA is claiming that the\ndischarge from a point source occurs as the water exits\nthe dam --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, fine.\nMR. KAYATTA: -- not in the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, what's --\nMR. KAYATTA: -- impoundment.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- the problem? So, they're\nsaying, as I thought was true since 1920, that you're\ngoing to get your dam only if you comply with State\nstandards, including standards about fish, algae, junk\nin the water, all kinds of things that might be put\nthere by the dam.\nMR. KAYATTA: Well, the -- 401 is a\ntriggering, or a threshold determination, as set forth\nin one of this Court's prior decisions, that gives the\nState not just a voice, but essentially a mandatory\nveto over a very broad area. The question in this case\nis, have we triggered -- have we stepped over that\nthreshold? The point that there is no disagreement\nbetween the parties on is that to step over that\nthreshold, to trigger 401, one has to have a discharge\ninto the navigable waters --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right. And they're saying,\n\"Of course there is a discharge. The discharge is a\ndischarge of water.\" Okay? The water runs into it.\nNow, that's enough for you to have to comply with the\nState standards before the F- -- FERC is going to give\nyou a license.\nMR. KAYATTA: No, their position is precisely\nthat the water is running into the water.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, have you got anything -\n- I've heard you argue about the word \"discharge\"; and\nyou say \"discharge\" doesn't mean \"discharge of water,\"\nit means something else. And I think that's a very\nlogical argument. Is there any other argument that\nyou'd have, related to the purpose of the statute for\nthe objective?\nMR. KAYATTA: Yes. Let me refer to the\npurpose. There's -- as is always the case, there are\ngeneral pronouncements about purpose. And the\nRespondents have taken those general pronouncements to\nbasically say, \"Anything that allows the States greater\ncontrol or improvement over water quality is the\ndirection in which the statute should be interpreted,\nto achieve that general purpose.\" However, we know\nthat, notwithstanding the general purposes, that\nCongress, when it turned to approve specific words in\n401, did not simply say \"anything that affects water\nquality.\" It divided a line. And that line, for\nexample, means that Federal permits for grazing, or\nFederal permits for logging roads, do not trigger 401;\nand they do not trigger it, because there is no\ndischarge from a point source.\nSo, we know a line has been drawn by Congress\nin pursuit of its purpose, as compared to other goals\nthat Congress has in mind. The question is, Where was\nthat line drawn? We think you look to the statute to\nsee where that was drawn, and it was \"discharge into\nthe navigable waters.\" Otherwise, what we're left with\nis, we're left with trying to, sort of, almost\nmetaphysically think of the water discharge -- the same\nwater discharging into the same water in order to reach\na conclusion that the real way you should read the\nstatute is just as if it says, \"If one does anything at\nall to the water, you need to get certification.\" And\nwe don't think it says that. It would --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But, Counsel, I keep\nthinking of this example, and I want you to comment on\nit. Out West, of course, there are a lot of dams where\nthere are salmon in the -- in the river, going down,\nand a lot of salmon get killed if they go through the -\n- through the dam, so that the water before the dam has\nlive salmon, and the water after that has dead salmon.\nAnd say that happened in Maine. Would that be\na discharge if that happened?\nMR. KAYATTA: The --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If there were live fish --\nMR. KAYATTA: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- above the dam, and they\nall -- they get killed going through the dam, and they\nwere dead when they --\nMR. KAYATTA: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- came out, would that be\na discharge in --\nMR. KAYATTA: Actually, the record here would\nindicate that that -- that could happen with some eels,\nnot salmon.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. KAYATTA: So, your point is well taken,\nJustice Stevens. The fish that, as the water flows\nthrough the dam, may be killed by coming in contact\nwith, and getting hit by, the turbine, are not\ndischarged into the water; they're in the water as it\ngoes into the dam, they're killed as it goes through\nthe dam, they remain in the water. The dam discharges\nnothing. It puts nothing --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So, you would say --\nMR. KAYATTA: -- into the river.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- even in that case, that\nwould not be a statutory discharge.\nMR. KAYATTA: That's correct, Your Honor. We\nthink that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you don't\ndispute that FERC could impose the same conditions that\nMaine has imposed in this case, as a matter of FERC\nauthority.\nMR. KAYATTA: Exactly. And we would --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could they even\nimpose something in the condition to your hydroelectric\npower license saying, \"You must comply with State water\nquality standards\"?\nMR. KAYATTA: I think they could -- I'm not\nsure they could word it that way, but they could\neffectively -- FERC could effectively do it. In\neffect, Congress has told FERC that in a -- in a\nFederal -- in a FERC proceeding, it not only has to\nlisten to the State, but it has to give considerable\nconsideration to the State's arguments. And it has to\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, you're concerned\nabout conditions -- I mean, as a practical matter, in\nterms of how the result in this case would change\nthings, it's a question of whether FERC has to more or\nless accept what the State does, or whether FERC simply\nconsiders and decides whether it wants to impose those\nconditions.\nMR. KAYATTA: That's correct. And it's a\nvery substantial issue, because essentially what FERC\nproceedings are -- under the hydropower sections of\nFERC, essentially what they are is environmental\nproceedings, where there's a determination made about\nwater quality issues that are then balanced off against\nenergy issues. If the -- under prior interpretations,\nthe 401 powers have become quite robust. If we now\ntake the threshold of \"discharge into the navigable\nwaters,\" and interpret that in a way so it essentially\napplies in all situations, FERC proceedings essentially\nwill be a mail office, where they receive the\nconditions from the State and have no choice but to\nfile them -- follow them. Our position is that\nCongress intended to leave some room --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You would rather be\nregulated more aggressively by FERC than by the Maine\nBoard of Environmental Protection.\nMR. KAYATTA: That's correct. It would have\na uniform national energy and environmental policy, in\nthat respect. And we believe that -- Congress, in '86,\nclearly thought that's what we had. That's the -- it\nwould make no sense, in Congress in '86, to order FERC\nto give weight to what the States say in these\nsituations if what we're now told is, \"Congress was\nwasting your time, because the States already had a\nmandatory veto on all of these issue -- issues in every\nsingle situation with respect to every single\nhydropower licensing\" --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does FERC --\nMR. KAYATTA: -- \"proceeding.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- as a regulator,\ntend to give greater priority to power considerations,\nas opposed to local environmental concerns?\nMR. KAYATTA: There was some concern prior to\n'86 by Congress that FERC was doing just that. And\nthat's why Congress told, in 1986, long after the\nstatute was passed, that FERC has to make specific\nfindings if it disagrees with the State. Additionally,\nCongress gave to the Department of Interior, under\nsection 18, certain powers to dictate to FERC, for\nexample, fish passages. FERC has no choice on those.\nSo, Congress -- this reference to cooperative\nfederalism clearly was in Congress's mind, but it\nwasn't a cooperative federalism in which, on all issues\nin all proceedings, all the State needed to do is tell\nFERC what to do. But they --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, but it doesn't -- it\ndoesn't say -- it says they have to comply with State\nwater quality standards, doesn't it?\nMR. KAYATTA: It doesn't -- Congress did not\norder, in 1986, FERC to always comply in all situations\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I thought -- it says\nthat you have to get your permit. You have to be\ncompliant with State water quality standards. Now,\nsuppose a State has a nutty water quality standard.\nDoesn't EPA have some authority there to make sure that\na water quality standard of a State, under the Clean\nWater Act, is -- makes sense?\nMR. KAYATTA: Well, EPA has some authority\nwith respect to any State water quality standards that\nare less stringent than EPO's -- EPA's own\nrequirements. It's not clear that EPA, under the Act,\nhas the ability to go beyond that. Moreover, it's --\nif --\nJUSTICE BREYER: In other words, if a State\nwere to say, \"Our water quality standard is the\nfollowing. We never build a dam in our State, no\nmatter what.\" Okay? Now, there's no authority in the\nEPA to set that aside as it not being a proper Clean\nWater Act standard.\nMR. KAYATTA: If this decision is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It has to be just a Clean\nWater Act standard.\nMR. KAYATTA: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not an expert on the\nClean Water Act. Is that a proper Clean Water Act\nstandard?\nMR. KAYATTA: If this decision is affirmed,\nthen you will have precisely held --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, this decision -- I'm not\nasking you about this decision. I'm asking you if a\nState, under the Clean Water Act, were to say, \"We have\nthe following Clean\" -- now you understand what I'm --\nMR. KAYATTA: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Does EPA, or anyone else,\nhave authority to say, \"That isn't a proper Clean Water\nAct standard, however good you may think it is\"?\nMR. KAYATTA: I don't know, Justice Breyer,\nabout the wording posed in your hypothetical, so I\ncan't answer the wording. I can say this, that\neffectively the States can do precisely that by simply\nsaying, \"We want the river water quality to be like X,\nand X is inconsistent with there being any dam at all\non the river.\" So, indeed, if this decision is\naffirmed, it truly does mean that States can entirely\ndictate everything having to do with any environmental\naspects of dams, including to the point of requiring\nthat the dams not operate; and FERC can do nothing\nabout it. We do -- we do not see how that would leave\nany sense of cooperative federalism, and it would tell\nCongress, \"In 1986, you were just entirely wasting your\ntime, because you had already, in '72, given them the\npower to control everything.\"\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, has FERC said that this\nis a problem, that the States are interfering?\nMR. KAYATTA: Well, FERC has sort of been all\nover the place. They're sort of the odd man out,\nbecause it's their jurisdiction that's being taken\naway; and yet we're talking about a Clean Water Act\ncase where EPA is the agency defined with that Act.\nFERC has argued to the courts, on several occasions,\nthat 401 needs to be limited to discharge of\npollutants. FERC, at one point, the first several dam\nproceedings that came up, it didn't even require\ncertifications at all. It then promulgated\ncertification requirements that said, \"Either get a\ncertification or otherwise comply with the law.\" And\nthen, in the interim period, it is simply -- as we've\nbeen affected, simply said, \"Go get your\ncertifications.\" It then tried to say, \"But we can do\nsomething about it if we don't like them.\" And the\nCircuit Courts, at least one, has said, \"No, you\ncan't.\"\nAnd when 401 applies, as this Court found in\nPublic Utility Districts versus Jefferson, it is a\nrobust power. It is an awesome power that is given to\nthe States under 401. And to -- giving that power\ngreatly cabined-in FERC's authority to now extend that\npower automatically to any conduct that in any way\n\"touches on the water\" by turning \"touches on the\nwater\" or \"moving the water\" into \"discharge into the\nwater\" -- effectively wipes out that balance entirely.\nI would note, too, that we don't even -- we\ncan answer all of this without even getting into those\nby going back to the statute. We have a statute here\nthat uses the word \"discharge,\" in one form or another,\non 421 occasions in 37 different sections of the\nstatute. With the exception of the section that deals\nwith the discharge of employees -- not into the river -\n- and the discharge --\n[Laughter.]\nMR. KAYATTA: -- and the discharge of board\nduties, in every single one of those instances, as you\nthumb through the statute, Congress is always clearly\ntalking about \"putting something into the water.\"\nThere is no doubt. On the one occasion in the statute\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I don't\nunderstand, linguistically, why this isn't \"putting\nsomething into the water,\" to the extent the dam holds\nback and restrains the water, then it \"puts back into\nthe water\" the water that it had held back.\nMR. KAYATTA: Well, the water slows down,\nmeanders around, as it would in an eddy, and continues\non through the dam, down the river. If you take a\nwater molecule, it comes down, goes through and out.\nIf -- unless you get --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Here's -- I'm\nthinking of the Hoover Dam, and it's got these huge,\nyou know, discharge points.\nMR. KAYATTA: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And every now and\nthen they let the water come out. Isn't that a\ndischarge?\nMR. KAYATTA: The -- I would say, in an\nordinary dictionary definition, if you stand below the\nHoover Dam and look up at it, you would say, \"Water is\nemitting from the dam. Water is discharging from the\ndam,\" in an ordinary dictionary definition. I would\nagree with that.\nWhat I'm saying, though, is that if you keep\nin mind that it's not a reservoir emitting into a\nriver, but it's a single river flowing through the dam,\nthat water is not \"discharging into\" that water.\nThat's what we're saying.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Would it be fair to say that,\nlet's say, the Missouri River discharges into the\nMississippi? Is that consistent with ordinary usage?\nMR. KAYATTA: If you have two water bodies,\nthen you could have one discharging into the other.\nYes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But they're two water bodies,\nonly because people gave them two different names.\nMR. KAYATTA: Well, in Miccosukee, the Court\nactually go into that and set forth -- in fact,\nremanded the case to decide whether the aquifer was one\nwater body or two. If you look at that remand, it's\nabsolutely clear that this water body, under any\nstandard discussed in that opinion, would be a single\nwater body. And the United States agrees with us on\nthat. The United States agrees we're talking about a\nsingle water body here.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But the --\nMR. KAYATTA: And I could --\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- the statute doesn't say\n\"discharge from one water body into another water\nbody.\" It says \"discharge into the navigable waters.\"\nMR. KAYATTA: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And if the portion of the\nriver below the dam is a navigable water, why is there\nnot a pouring forth of the water into the navigable\nwaters below the dam?\nMR. KAYATTA: Well, if one thinks of upstream\nwaters and downstream waters, it -- our view is that\nupstream waters simply become downstream waters as they\nflow through the dam. One doesn't discharge into\nanother.\nI would -- I would concede that very bright\npeople working very hard with virtually any words in\nthe English language can find some way to reach a point\nto say that perhaps something fits something. But, at\nsome point -- at some point, I think we need to ask, is\n-- if Congress uses the same word throughout the\nstatute to always mean putting something into water,\nthen how do we get to the conclusion that what that\nreally means is doing anything to the water is always -\n- because --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, isn't --\nMR. KAYATTA: -- the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- isn't the answer to your\nquestion that a great number of those usages that you\nrefer to are uses that refer to the discharge of\npollutants? And there is a good -- there are good\nreasons in the statute -- and we have recognized them -\n- to say that when you discharge a pollutant, you are\nadding something that wasn't there before? But when\nthe statute, in this case, is using \"discharge\" without\na reference to \"pollutant,\" it makes perfectly good\nlinguistic sense to construe it just as the Court has\ndone.\nMR. KAYATTA: Well it makes -- it is\nlinguistically logical to say that we're, therefore,\ngoing to assume that a pollutant is not needed here.\nBut when Congress has replaced the \"discharge of a\npollutant\" with a \"discharge into,\" it seems to me\nCongress has actually moved in the other direction of\nreinforcing that we're talking about --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, maybe it's --\nMR. KAYATTA: -- putting something into the\nwater.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- \"reinforcing,\" and maybe\nit's \"changing.\" I mean, you're characterizing it one\nway. We start with a different canon of meaning, and\nthat is that we look to the words around which, in\nconnection with which, the word is used. In here, it's\nbeing used without certain modifiers or descriptive\nconditions. In other cases, it is being used with\nthem. And that's a good reason to think that probably\nthe word is intended to mean something different in\nthose situations.\nMR. KAYATTA: Well, I would -- I would\nhesitate, Justice Souter, to go from taking a specific\nword, like \"discharge,\" and, therefore, saying that it\nmeant something that is both more general and much more\neasily set.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but your argument, I\nthought, was simply this, that it uses \"discharge\" in,\nyou know, X number -- I forget how many you had -- and\nit's perfectly clear that in most of those instances it\nrequires an addition; and, therefore, it should be\nconstrued as requiring it here. My point was that in a\ngreat many of those instances, the statute is not\nmerely using the word in isolation; it's using it in\nconnection with a couple of other words, like\n\"discharge a pollutant.\" And it, therefore, number\none, makes sense to construe \"discharge of a pollutant\"\ndifferently from \"discharge.\" That's the -- that's the\nonly point.\nMR. KAYATTA: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The only point is, you can't\nsimply argue from the fact that the word occurs somehow\nX number of times to the conclusion that it has to mean\nthe same thing every time it's used.\nMR. KAYATTA: I agree with you. And my point\nis, I am including instances not just in which\n\"pollutant\" is used. A whole variety. And, in every\nsingle one of those, its common -- and I would submit\nthat the word itself, when you use the word \"into,\"\nnaturally suggests -- in fact, why would someone use\nthe phrase \"discharge into the navigable waters\" if\nwhat they really meant was, \"If you do anything to the\nnavigable waters at all, you've got to get a permit\"?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Because that isn't what they\nmean. I mean, for example, if somebody puts a stick in\nthe middle of the river, no one -- no one is claiming\nthat the water that flows around the stick is being\ndischarged. I mean, there are a lot -- I don't know\nwhether anyone wants to put a stick in the river, but -\n-\nMR. KAYATTA: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- there are things you can\ndo that clearly would not activate the Corps'\ninterpretation here.\nMR. KAYATTA: I -- this logic, I think, would\nprobably include virtually anything you do to the\nwater, because it would separate the water, the water\ngoing around the stick. One would then say the\ndictionary definition means it's then discharging back\ninto itself on the other side of the stick. There\nwould be, perhaps, no water quality concerns, but 401\ndoesn't say \"water quality concerns\"; it says\n\"discharge into.\"\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Would you agree that if the\n-- if somebody with property on each side wanted to\nbuild a dam -- I'm sorry, wanted to build a bridge to\nconnect his property, and he needed to put a post in\nthe middle of the river to support the bridge, that\nthere would be no discharge of water occasioned by\nputting the post in there?\nMR. KAYATTA: Under the Government's\ninterpretation, there would be. There would be a\ndischarge into the navigable waters in that situation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why, if -- you may answer.\nMR. KAYATTA: Because the post -- to put --\nwell, in the first place, putting the post in might,\nitself, be a -- what we could concede to be a\ndischarge. In the second case, though, is that we\nunderstand that you would be exercising control over\nthe flow and direction of that water, it would separate\nthe river into two portions -- of course, small. But\nif we're pursuing this line of logic that the\nGovernment has to its final extent, it would then\ndischarge back into itself on the other side of that\npost.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nGeneral Rowe?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF G. STEVEN ROWE\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMR. ROWE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe flow of water through Petitioner's dams\ninto the Presumpscot River is a discharge, under\nsection 401(a) of the Clean Water Act. This finding is\nsupported by the plain text of section 401(a), the\npurpose, the history, and the structure of the Clean\nWater Act, in more than 30 years of administrative\npractice and agency interpretation. Under the Clean\nWater Act, Congress --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there a --\nMR. ROWE: -- requires --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there a discharge\nif you have a simple waterwheel in the river? Is that\na discharge?\nMR. ROWE: Well, first of all, Your Honor,\nfor 401 to apply there must be a federally licensed\nactivity. In that case --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, so it's a old\nhydroelectric plant, it uses a simple waterwheel. I\nmean, is that -- does that fit your definition of a\n\"discharge\"? In other words, it restrains the water\ntemporarily.\nMR. ROWE: Yes, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And then it releases\nit again as it passes by the wheel.\nMR. ROWE: Yes, Your Honor. It --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, if you put a\nwaterwheel in a flowing river, under your definition,\nthat's a discharge into the navigable water.\nMR. ROWE: It could, Your Honor. It could\ndischarge. It depends on the actual circumstances.\nObviously, under the doctrine of de minimis non curat\nlex, it may not pose any problems, and it wouldn't be\nan issue. But certainly to the extent that it used the\nwater and then it discharged the water, there was\nemitting out or flowing out.\nIf you put a fishnet in the river, there would be\nno discharge. Justice Souter's example of a simple --\na post, probably no discharge. But if you put a\nhundred-foot -- a post 100 foot in diameter into a 200-\nfoot-wide river, then you may have a discharge. So,\nYour Honor, I would suggest it depends on the\ncircumstances. But, remember, 401 does require it to\nbe a federally licensed project.\nThe point I was going to make, Your Honor, is\nthat, under the Clean Water Act, Congress requires\nStates to adopt clean water standards --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I must say, this --\nMR. ROWE: -- water quality standards.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- this doesn't seem to me\nnormal usage. I don't think if -- you know, if you see\na rapids in a river, it would be strange to say the\nrapids of the Colorado \"discharge\" into the Colorado.\nYou're usually talking about a different body of water.\nYou could say the Green River discharges into the\nColorado. Likewise, a waterfall, you wouldn't say, you\nknow, \"The waterfall on this river discharges into the\nriver.\" It's part of the river. But if it were a\nwaterfall that brought a tributary into the river, you\nwould then say that, you know, \"the waterfall\ndischarges into the Colorado,\" or whatever river it\nenters at that point. It seems to me very strange to\ntalk about a river discharging into itself.\nMR. ROWE: Justice Scalia, it's not strange\nat all. It's not -- it's discharging from the activity\ninto the river. The water goes into the activity. The\nactivity, in this case, is a -- an impoundment. There\nare five impoundments. These dams create impoundments.\nOne's 197 acres --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that doesn't --\nbut that --\nMR. ROWE: -- in size.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that doesn't\nmatter to your analysis. It's the one post, right? I\nmean, if you have just sort of a foot indentation on\neither side, would -- the flows, in -- under your view,\nsuddenly becomes a discharge.\nMR. ROWE: Your Honor, my point is, that's\nnot the case we have. We're talking about a\nhydroelectric dam here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but --\nMR. ROWE: But --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- we're trying to --\nMR. ROWE: But --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- define --\nMR. ROWE: I understand, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- a statutory term\nthat's going to apply in a wide variety of cases.\nMR. ROWE: Yes. In that case, Your Honor,\nI've said it could cause a discharge -- if the flow was\ninterrupted, the flow regimen of the river, to such an\nextent that it -- that it increased, substantially, the\nflow on one side, and that was a federally licensed\nactivity, then 401 would apply. It would be a\ndischarge from the activity.\nNow, I'm -- again, I'm using the de minimis\nrule here. But what we have here, Your Honors, is a\ndam, we have the water being diverted into a power\ncanal, then dropping down onto the top of the turbines.\nThe turbines are using the water, they're taking the\nenergy from the water to turn the turbine, and then the\nwater is being released.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So, what's --\nMR. ROWE: It's being discharged.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So, what's the definition -\n- what's the general definition that you're giving us\nthat describes this result you've given?\nMR. ROWE: Justice --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It --\nMR. ROWE: -- Kennedy --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It is a discharge, because\na \"discharge\" means what?\nMR. ROWE: It means a flowing or issuing out.\nIt's the -- it is the dictionary definition. Mr.\nKayatta mentioned the Hoover Dam. It is that. That's\nwhat it is. It's the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the --\nMR. ROWE: -- ordinary definition.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- the issue is not whether\nthere is a discharge, as I see it. The issue is\nwhether there's a \"discharge into the river.\" And one\ndoes not usually speak of the \"river discharging into\nitself.\" That -- it's the \"into\" that's the crucial\npart. How do you distinguish this case from\nMiccosukee, if I'm saying it right? -- yes, Miccosukee\n--\nMR. ROWE: Well, Your Honor, Miccosukee --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- where we had, you know, a\npumping of water from one polluted body into another,\nand it was held -- we held that that was not a\ndischarge?\nMR. ROWE: Your Honor, the -- in Miccosukee,\nthat was a section 402 case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It --\nMR. ROWE: It dealt with discharge of a\npollutant.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's right.\nMR. ROWE: And this --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the crucial --\nMR. ROWE: -- Court held --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- word was \"discharge.\"\nThe reason we held it was not covered is not because\nthere was no pollutant. It was clear that there was a\npollutant. But we held there was no discharge.\nMR. ROWE: No, Your Honor, you held that\nthere was no discharge of the pollutant. You held that\nit was --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Because there was no\ndischarge of a pollutant. There were pollutants in -\n- on both sides. That -- I think that was conceded in\nthe case. The reason that the case came out the way it\ndid was that we held there was no discharge of a\npollutant.\nMR. ROWE: But there -- Your Honor -- Your\nHonor, in that case, it required a discharge of a\npollutant from a point source. The definition of\n\"discharge\" in section 401 is much broader.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wasn't it conceded that\nthere was a pollutant -- that a pollutant was involved\nin that case?\nMR. ROWE: Your -- yes, Your Honor, but the -\n-\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, what must have been the\ndifference was that there was no discharge.\nMR. ROWE: There was no discharge of a\npollutant, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There was no discharge of\nanything. It was clear that if there was a -- if there\nwas a discharge, it was a discharge of a pollutant.\nMR. ROWE: Your Honor, in -- with all due\nrespect, in that case -- and, in that case, you joined\nJustice Thomas in saying, \"The term 'discharge' is not\ndefined in the Clean Water Act, but its plain and\nordinary meaning suggests a flowing or issuing out, or\nsomething that is emitted.\" In the case we have here,\nsomething is emitted. It is water. It is emitted\nfrom a facility. We have a federally licensed\nfacility. And out of the turbines comes water, and it\nflows into the river. Miccosukee was a 402 case, Your\nHonor, with all due respect.\nAnd, in another point, I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Didn't -- didn't that case\ninvolved the -- a violation there -- involve the\naddition of a pollutant? And there was no addition of\na pollutant, because the water was equally polluted on\neach side. Wasn't that the --\nMR. ROWE: That's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- the case?\nMR. ROWE: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. ROWE: The pollutant was already in the\nwater when it -- when it entered -- the water from the\npipe. And the point that Justice Ginsburg's mentioned,\nthe quote, is, if one takes a ladle of soup from a pot,\nlifts it up above the pot and pours it back into the\npot, one has not added soup or anything else to the\npot. Section 401, the word \"discharge\" in that section\ndoes not require an addition of anything. It can be --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then -- but\nyour focus -- in response to my question about what\nwould constitute release, you focused on the fact of\nimpoundment, a restriction of the flow. It seems to me\nthat the ladle analogy that the Court has made part of\nthe law of the land is -- refutes that, because if it's\nhold -- you're holding it up in the ladle, that's like\nan impoundment. You've separated it, to that extent,\nfrom the other body, and the Court said, when you pour\nit back in, that's not --\nMR. ROWE: It wasn't --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that's not a\ndischarge of a pollutant --\nMR. ROWE: No, Mr. Chief --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and there was no\ndispute that there were pollutants, so it must mean it\nwasn't a discharge.\nMR. ROWE: Mr. Chief Justice, the Court\ndidn't say that there was no discharge; the Court said\nthat there was no addition of soup or anything else\ninto the pot. The point is, there was not the addition\nof a pollutant. And you do not need the addition of a\npollutant to find a discharge, under section 401.\nI just want to remind the Court that section\n401 came from section 21(b) of the Water Quality\nImprovement Act of 1970. That was the old section 401.\nIt said, \"Anytime that there's a licensed activity\nthat's going to create a discharge from a facility into\nnavigable waters, then the States are to enforce their\nwater quality standards.\" Congress requires States to\nadopt water quality standards, according to section\n303. And we have. All States have. And those water\nquality standards are consistent. We have designated\nuses, water quality criteria, and an antidegradation\npolicy.\nThe Court should know that, as part of our\ndesignated uses, hydropower is one of those. The State\nvalues hydropower. We understand the importance of it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you --\nMR. ROWE: Most --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- you don't -- you\ndon't value it as much as FERC does, though, do you?\nMR. ROWE: Your Honor, I don't know.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. ROWE: You heard -- Your Honor, you heard\nearlier --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, isn't one way\nto look at this -- I mean, the concern is that your\nconstituents probably have a higher priority and a\ngreater concern with the environmental consequences of\ngenerating power, while FERC's priority is to make sure\nthat we have sufficient power. And you're likely to\nweigh these competing uses in very different ways.\nMR. ROWE: Well, Your Honor, you heard\nearlier about the -- 1986, the Electric Consumers\nProtection Act. That did require FERC to give equal\nconsideration to the protection of the environment with\nrespect to the production of -- hydropower production.\nBut the States have a responsibility given to them by\nCongress. The States have the primary responsibility\nfor the prevention, for the reduction, and for the\nelimination of pollution. The way we enforce that is\nthrough our water quality standards. And so, the only\nway we can enforce those standards with respect to\nfederally licensed facilities is section 401. And if\nyou should take that from us, it will create a gaping\nhole in the Clean Water Act.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, only if you assume\nthat letting out the same water into the same river is\npollution. It seems to me you're begging the question.\nMR. ROWE: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You --\nMR. ROWE: -- the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If there were a discharge of\nsomething into the river, you'd be able to move against\nit. But the question here is whether there's any\ndischarge into the river when you stop the river and\nthen let the same river out.\nMR. ROWE: Your Honor, the \"pollution,\" as\ndefined in the Clean Water Act, is the alteration of\nthe physical, chemical, and biological integrity of the\nwater. That's the pollution.\nThe reason 401 exists, and the reason\n\"discharge\" is used broadly, and it's the trigger for\nthe section to work, is because you look at the impacts\nof that activity on the environment. You look at the\nphysical integrity -- Has it been altered? -- the\nchemical integrity, the biological integrity. We look\nat things like the impact on aquatic ecosystems, the\nthermal stratification in the impoundment areas,\nwhether there is lower dissolved oxygen. And certainly\nwe look at the fish migration issues. Has there been\nblockage?\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could you, as Justice\nBreyer's question to your adversary suggested, adopt\nwater quality standards that would make any\nhydroelectric power impossible, in Maine?\nMR. ROWE: Your Honor, we could. We have a\nnumber of classes of rivers. With respect to one\nclass, that is not a designated use. With respect to\nall the others, hydropower is the designated use.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you think that's something\nthat Congress intended when they adopted this, to allow\na State to rule out hydroelectric power?\nMR. ROWE: Justice Alito, Congress did not\ngive the States unbounded authority. Indeed, in\nsection 401(d), there is a restriction. It restricts\nthe conditions to those necessary to assure that the\napplicant will comply with conditions in our water\nquality standards. And if -- I mean, FERC does\nincorporate those standards into the license, but the\napplicant can redress that in court, as this one has.\nSo, we -- I want to mention, again, that States care\nabout hydropower. We care about fish migration. We\ncare about recreation activities. We care about all of\nthese things, and they're all incorporated into our\nwater quality standards.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So, I take it your ultimate\nanswer is, no, a State could not, in effect, eliminate\nhydropower from --\nMR. ROWE: Well, Your --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- development.\nMR. ROWE: -- Your Honor, in our State it's a\ndesignated use --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry --\nMR. ROWE: -- on most of our rivers.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm not interested -- I'm\nasking for an answer to my question. I take it, based\non your further answer to Justice Alito, that your\nanswer to the first question is, no, a State could not,\nin effect, eliminate all hydropower from -- development\nfrom its rivers.\nMR. ROWE: Your -- Justice Souter, a State --\na State could do that if it changed the designated uses\nfor its rivers. But in the State of Maine, as in 45\nStates --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And you don't think there\nwould be any conflict with the FERC scheme if you did\nthat? You don't think there would be any conflict\nbetween the Federal policy embodied in the Power Act\nand in the State law?\nMR. ROWE: Well, Your Honor, again, I want to\n-- under the Clean Water Act, the States have primary\nresponsibility for the reduction and for the\nelimination and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, I --\nMR. ROWE: -- prevention of pollution.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- I think the question --\nmaybe it just -- I don't understand, totally, how the\nClean Water Act works, but I thought that what we're\ntalking in this statute is a State rule that's called\nthe State Clean Water Act rule. It's a creature of the\nClean Water Act, isn't it? A water quality standard?\nMR. ROWE: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. And, therefore,\na State, I would think, that had some totally bizarre\nClean Water Act standard might find that it had a\nstandard that didn't fit within the scope of the Clean\nWater Act. And, therefore, it wasn't going to be\nenforced here. Is that right, or not right? Maybe the\nFederal Government will explain this --\nMR. ROWE: Well, Your Honor, I'm sure the\nFederal Government will also address this question, but\nthe parameters of the water quality standards are\naddressed in section 303 of the Clean Water Act. And\nthere are parameters in there. And the States' Clean\nWater -- or water quality standards must conform to\nthose standards. We submit our Clean -- our water\nquality standards --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are they maximums or\nminimums?\nMR. ROWE: Your Honor, it's simply categories\nin there. We submit --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I expect that they're\nminimums.\nMR. ROWE: We -- well, they are minimums,\nYour Honor. We submit these to the EPA. The EPA\napproves the State water quality standards, and then\nthose standards are how we evaluate these federally\nlicensed activities as to whether they're in compliance\nor not. And they determine the certification, whether\nit's issued, and if it's issued, with what conditions.\nIf a State -- if a State's rivers were not conducive\nto hydropower -- the question you asked, Your Honor was\n-- Justice Souter -- could a State prevent hydropower\nfrom occurring? Again, we have, with respect to a few\nrivers in the State of Maine; but most of the rivers,\nit is a designated use, because States, like the\nFederal Government, value hydropower. There is no air\npollution. It's a clean source of energy. We value\nit. And, indeed, the antidegradation policies that are\npart of our water quality standards require us to look\nat the impact on Petitioner's dams, the power output\nthat's going to be -- going to -- is going to result\nfrom these various conditions that we impose as a part\nof our certification.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: General Rowe, may I ask\nthis question? In the Miccosukee case, we sent the\ncase back, as you remember, to decide whether or not\nthere were one body of water or two bodies of water.\nIn your view, are there one or two bodies of water --\nwould it be five bodies of water -- in this case?\nMR. ROWE: There's one body of water, Your\nHonor -- Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So, you --\nMR. ROWE: And that's the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- concede that.\nMR. ROWE: -- that's the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Okay.\nMR. ROWE: -- Presumpscot River.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. ROWE: All the water is waters of the\nUnited States, navigable waters, but the water is being\ndischarged from the facility into the navigable waters.\nYou -- Your Honor has mentioned a storage dam. A\nstorage dam creates an impoundment. In fact, one of\nthese dams has a 50-foot-high wall that holds the water\nback, almost 200 acres of water. At times, there is\nwater that goes over the top of the dam. That is,\nindeed, a discharge. It is caused by the activity. It\nresults from the activity. It's not the free-flowing\nwater. And I want to make that clear. I think,\nJustice Scalia, your question was -- that's not a\ndischarge. That's a natural flow of water. What's\nhappening here is, the flow is being altered. Because\nof the impoundment, because of the diversion, the flow\nis being altered. And in the case at hand here, you're\nactually taking a turbine, the water drops down into\nthe turbine, turns the turbine blades or fans, it\nabsorbs the water of its power, and then the water is\nreleased, discharged, into the tailrace channel, into\nthe natural river.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, any significant\nobstruction in the river amounts to a -- creates a\ndischarge.\nMR. ROWE: No, I'd -- no, Your --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Indeed, if it's a small\nenough stream, I suppose just swimming in it or lying\nsideways so you impede the flow, you are causing a\ndischarge into the waters of the United States. I find\nthat peculiar.\nMR. ROWE: That -- Justice Scalia, that's not\nwhat I said. The question was asked about a post, like\na bridge, the pilings for a bridge. In certain cases,\ndepending on the size, it might result in a discharge.\nI'm not saying every -- a stick in the river is,\ncertainly not a swimmer. We have a de minimis rule.\nWe're not saying that. It needs to be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it depends on how big\nthe river is, doesn't it?\nMR. ROWE: Well, I'm -- if it's navigable\nwaters, and you have a huge post that's holding up a\nbridge, there could be a -- there -- and it's federally\nlicensed -- there could be a discharge resulting from\nthat. I mean, I -- that is what a person would say,\n\"There is a discharge,\" because suddenly you see --\nwhere water was naturally flowing, you see a diversion,\nin an impoundment, of sorts, moving the water over.\nBut what we have here is not that case. What we have\nhere is an impoundment. We have the water being\ndiverted into a narrow channel, dropping down onto\nthese turbines, being used, and then being discharged\ninto the river.\nThe word \"discharge,\" again, in 1970, under the\n21(b), was given a broad definition. 402 and 404 came\nlater, in 1972, as part of the Clean Water Act. In\nthose, we're dealing with discrete conveyances of\npollutants, 402. And 404 was dredge or fill discharge.\nAnd those were deemed necessary. But they're consumed\nin 401. In other words, if you get a 402, if you need\na 40- -- a 402 application, certification, you also\nwill need a 401. 401 deals with the effects of\npollution, the effects of the activity on the\nenvironment.\nI thank Your Honors very much. And I just\nwant to remind the Court that the State very much\nvalues the power -- the importance of hydropower. We\nvalue the -- our responsibility, as given to us by\nCongress under the Clean Water Act, to be the primary\nenforcer of our water quality standards. And the only\nway we can do that, with respect to federally licensed\nfacilities, is section 401.\nThank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General\nRowe.\nMr. Minear.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR\nFOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nIN SUPPORT OF RESPONDENT\nMR. MINEAR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe United States submits that the operation\nof Petitioner's hydropower facilities results in a\ndischarge into the navigable waters within the meaning\nof section 401 of the Clean Water Act. section 401\nuses the term \"discharge\" in its ordinary sense to mean\na \"flowing out\" or \"issuing out.\" The facilities at\nissue in this case, which divert water, impound it, and\nthen release it, produce a flowing or issuing out of\nthat water into the navigable Presumpscot River.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Section 402 uses \"discharge\"\nin the same sense, I assume.\nMR. MINEAR: No, it does not, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why doesn't it?\nMR. MINEAR: Because it uses the term\n\"discharge of a pollutant,\" which is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes --\nMR. MINEAR: -- which is defined, under the\nClean Water Act, as a statutory term of art, to mean\nthe addition of a pollution -- of a pollutant from a\npoint source. On the other hand, the Clean Water Act\ninterprets or defines \"discharge\" to include the\n\"discharge of a pollutant.\" So, it's clear that the\nterm \"discharge\" is broader than the term \"discharge of\na pollutant,\" and does not include the requirement of\nan addition.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is -- it is broader. But\nif -- the discharge of a pollutant into the same body\nof water does not constitute the addition of a\npollution -- of a pollutant. It obviously is the\naddition of a pollutant. The only reason you could say\nthat taking it from one -- pumping it from one polluted\nbody to another is not a discharge of a pollutant,\nwhich is what we said in Miccosukee, the only basis for\nsaying that is that there has been no discharge.\nThere's obviously been an addition of a pollutant to\nthe -- to the other body of water. The only thing you\ncan say is, there hasn't been a discharge. It's --\nbecause it's the same body of water.\nMR. MINEAR: I respectfully disagree, Your\nHonor, because, in Miccosukee, it addressed the\nspecific question of whether or not there is an\naddition. And, in the much-quoted soup-ladle example,\nwhat it was talking about, in that instance, was taking\na ladle of soup, removing it from the pot, and adding\nit back. The pouring back of the soup into the pot is\na discharge, it's a flowing or issuing out. It's not\nan addition, because nothing is being added to the\nsoup.\nNow, in this case, we're using the term\n\"discharge,\" not \"addition.\" And there is, obviously,\na flowing or issuing out from the dam. Anyone who goes\nand observes a dam, and sees the water leaving the dam,\nwill say that's a \"discharge.\" That's common parlance.\nIt's been repeated numerous times in this Court's own\ndecisions in describing dam operations.\nFurthermore --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, Miccosukee\nwas concerned not with molecules, but with chemical\ncomposition. The chemical composition was the same in\nthis body and in that body, and, in that sense, there\nwas no addition --\nMR. MINEAR: That's correct --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that --\nMR. MINEAR: -- that there was no\ntransmission.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. MINEAR: But I think, Justice Souter, you\nare right in focusing on the exiting from the dam and\nwhy discharges are important here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If, in Miccosukee, liquid of\nthe same composition had been taken from another body\nof water, and from -- not the body of water that was\nadjacent and which we held was the same body of water -\n- with the same composition, and that had been added,\ndo you think Miccosukee would have come out the same\nway?\nMR. MINEAR: Yes, I think it would have come\nout the same way.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Really? That you could take\npollutants from a different body of water and add it to\nan already polluted stream? I thought that was clear\nthat that's not the case.\nMR. MINEAR: Your Honor, if we look to the\nMiccosukee opinion, at 541 U.S. 109 to 110, it\ndiscusses this issue. One of the issues there is, Are\nthere two bodies of water or one body of water?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly.\nMR. MINEAR: And the Court -- that question\nwas left unresolved in Miccosukee. That's what's being\ntried in Florida right now.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Because if it was one body\nof water, it was okay, and if it was two bodies of\nwater, it was bad, right?\nMR. MINEAR: Yes, but in -- at page 109, what\nthis Court said -- it talked about the S-9 pump, which\nwas central there, because it was moving the body --\nthat the -- the water. It was transmitting it. And it\nwas -- talked about pumping the water from one part of\nthe water body to the other. That's a discharge, even\nthough it's the same water body.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it would add pollutants\nto the other body whether it comes from the adjacent\nbody or whether it comes from some distant body. The\nonly reason that the pumping from the adjacent body did\nnot qualify is -- not because there no addition of\npollutants. There would be an addition of pollutions\nfrom a distant lake, and you -- we'd be able to hold a\nperson liable. The only reason there was no addition\nhere was that there was -- there was an addition here,\nbut there was no discharge, because it was the same\nbody of water.\nMR. MINEAR: With --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And I --\nMR. MINEAR: With respect --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- it seems to me that's --\nMR. MINEAR: -- I think you have --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- what you have here.\nMR. MINEAR: -- it exactly backwards with\nwhat the position of the United States was in\nMiccosukee, and it explains why our -- we took that\nposition. And the Court upheld our position in\nMiccosukee. And we're taking the different position\nhere. Because here we're talking about a discharge,\nnot an addition. The dictionary definition of\n\"discharge\" nowhere speaks of \"addition.\" Petitioners\nhave not pointed to any dictionary definition that\nspeaks in terms of an addition. It talks about a\nflowing or issuing out. What it connotes is that the\nwater has, in some sense, been contained or confined,\nto some degree.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I was --\nMR. MINEAR: And it's issuing out --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- surprised, in a\ncase involving a FERC license condition, that no one\nfrom FERC signed on to your brief.\nMR. MINEAR: Well, Your Honor, as people in\nthe office are familiar with, in the SG's office, the\nnames in the brief tell very little about who has\nparticipated in the discussions and the writing of the\nbrief. The Rapanos case --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if it's a case\ninvolving a FERC license, and FERC isn't there, I think\nit says a great deal.\nMR. MINEAR: Well, Your Honor, this is\nprimarily a case about the Clean Water Act. I would\npoint to the Rapanos case, immediately before. The\nCorps' name is not on the brief, and EPA's name is not\non the brief.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you know what\nFERC's --\nMR. MINEAR: So, we can't draw --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you know what\nFERC's position is --\nMR. MINEAR: I certainly --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- in this case?\nMR. MINEAR: -- do. They join in the\nconsensus position of the United States. This brief\nhas been coordinated not only with EPA and FERC, but\nalso the Department of the Interior and the Army Corps\nof Engineers. This is the position of the United\nStates.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm sure of\nthat, and it involves a reconciliation of --\nMR. MINEAR: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- competing\npositions. Is there anything that FERC has issued that\nis illuminating with respect to their view?\nMR. MINEAR: I think what's illuminating is\ntheir consistent position, since 1970, when this\nprovision was first enacted into law, in the Water\nQuality Improvement Act of 1970, 2 years before the\nClean Water Act amendments.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you agree that a\nState could adopt water quality standards that would,\nin effect, preclude hydroelectric power in the State?\nMR. MINEAR: I think it's certainly possible,\non an individual river. Imagine if a State had a river\nthat is designated as a wilderness area or a wild and\nscenic river, and determined it did not --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would they do --\nMR. MINEAR: -- want to have hydropower.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- it statewide?\nMR. MINEAR: If they did it statewide, I\nthink --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Saying, \"It is of\nutmost importance to us to provide habitat for spawning\nsalmon, whatever, dams interfere with that in a way we\nfind objectionable, so we're going to go a different\ndirection, as a matter of power policy for the State of\nwhatever, and not allow hydroelectric power.\"\nMR. MINEAR: If they did it statewide, it\nwould raise a question of whether or not that action is\npreempted under the Federal Power Act, not under the\nClean Water Act. And that would -- that's obviously\nnot the issue here. Maine, as you have heard, supports\nhydropower production. The question here is\nreconciling the competing roles of the hydropower\ncompany, on the one hand, and the State and Federal\nGovernments, which, in the spirit of cooperative\nfederalism, work together on these matters. We are\nvery supportive of the States' approach of reviewing\ndischarges to determine whether or not there has been\nthe creation of pollution, and determining whether or\nnot there is a violation of their water quality\nstandards. This is a part of -- an important role that\nthe State has under the Clean Water Act, that Congress\ngave to the State, and to which we defend.\nI'd like to point out that one of the things\nthat's been talked about here is the oddity, supposed\noddity, of a water discharging into itself. And that's\nnot odd at all. One often talks about, for instance,\nthe fresh water above the dam being discharged into the\nfresh waters below. That's -- there's nothing unusual\nabout this, because we're talking about the\ncharacteristic of a water that might be shared by the\nwater that's upstream and contained in the dam and is\nalso a characteristic of the water below. Now, under\nsection 401, the upstream characteristic doesn't\nmatter, because it's -- it refers to \"any discharge,\"\nand it says \"into the navigable waters.\" \"Into\" is\nsignificant, because \"any discharge\" is \"out of\nsomething.\" And so, it can also be \"into something.\"\nAnd by stating \"into navigable waters\", Congress\nindicated what it was concerned about, which was that\ndischarges that go into the navigable waters can cause\npollution, and, therefore, ought to be reviewed by the\nState to make sure the water quality standards are\nbeing met.\nThere's nothing unusual in this at all. It\nsimply indicates that Congress was not concerned about\ndischarges that go elsewhere; for instance, into a\nmunicipal water system or onto irrigated land.\nWhat we have here --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Just for the few of us who\nthink the dictionary doesn't answer the case, is it\npossible you could say a word about why Congress would,\nor would not, have wanted, in effect, to incorporate\nall State water quality standards into a permission to\nbuild a dam?\nMR. MINEAR: The reason why, it was because\nCongress gave the States primary authority under the\nClean Water Act to deal with pollution. Discharges\nfrom confinements, from confined water, creates\npollution, even in the absence of pollutants, by the\nstratification, the deprivation of oxygen, and the\nlike. And Congress recognized that where there's a\ndischarge, there's likely to be a pollution problem,\nand that pollution problem will be manifested\ndownstream. And it, therefore, makes sense for the\nState to be able to review and determine whether or not\nits water quality standards will be met.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Also to protect fish?\nMR. MINEAR: Yes. It includes the protection\nof fish. And, in fact, one of the things that this\npermit does, in this particular case, this condition,\nis, it ensures that there is, in fact, water in the\nbypass reaches. In the absence of the conditions that\nthe State imposed here, there would be no water at all\nin the bypass reaches. Now, it's true that FERC itself\ncan impose conditions to meet these requirements --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose --\nMR. MINEAR: -- but --\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- you have a facility that\nproduces adverse environmental effects in one State,\nbut produces power for a number of adjoining States.\nWhy does it make sense for the State in which the\nfacility is located to do the balancing of the\nenvironmental and the power considerations in that\nsituation?\nMR. MINEAR: May I answer that question --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Certainly.\nMR. MINEAR: -- Your Honor?\nThe Clean Water Act provides for exactly this\nproblem. It does address the problem of interstate\npollution. I believe that this Court's case in\nArkansas versus Oklahoma deals with that type of issue.\nIt provides for a reconciliation, with EPA playing an\nimportant role in those interstate concerns.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\n"
