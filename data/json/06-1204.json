Pimentel, et al.\nMr. Rothfeld.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ROTHFELD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThis case concerns a dispute over the\nownership of the property, the Arelma assets, that the\nRepublic of the Philippines believes were stolen by\nFerdinand Marcos while he served as the Republic's\npresident. The ownership of this property should be\nsettled by the courts of the Republic. The Arelma\nassets were stolen in the Philippines, from the\nPhilippine people, by their former president. The\ncurrent dispute is between the Republic and certain of\nits citizens. There is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I just didn't hear you.\nYou said that this dispute should be settled by --\nMR. ROTHFELD: By the courts of the\nRepublic. The question of ownership of these assets we\nbelieve is a matter as certainty of as the first\nimpression should be decided in the Republic. As I say,\nthe assets here were stolen in the Republic, from the\nRepublic's citizens, by their president. There is\ncurrently a proceeding pending before the Sandiganbayan,\nthe special Philippine anti-corruption court that has\njurisdiction over matters of this sort, dealing\nspecifically with the assets that are at issue here.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's been pending how\nlong?\nMR. ROTHFELD: It's been pending -- well,\nthe Republic initially filed a forfeiture petition in\n1991 directed at a range of assets related to former\npresident Marcos. Ultimately, after the assets were\ntransferred from Switzerland to be held in escrow in the\nPhilippines, the Philippine Supreme Court in 2003 issued\na judgment relating to those assets because there was\nsome doubt as to whether that judgment, some question\nabout whether that judgment specifically addressed the\nArelma assets that are at issue here, the Republic filed\na motion before the Sandiganbayan in 2004 directed\nspecifically at the assets. The motion has been pending\nsince that time.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So it's from 2004 to\n2008?\nMR. ROTHFELD: It has been, Your Honor. The\nRepublic -- that delay cannot be attributed to the\nRepublic. The Republic has filed five motions with the\nSandiganbayan urging it to expedite its decision. I can\ntell you that it has a -- it is a court with a very\nsubstantial docket. The division of the Sandiganbayan\nthat's considered this, these assets, considered among\nmany other cases the corruption trial of former\nPresident Joseph Estrada. So I don't think that the\ndelay can at this point be deemed --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it gets way ahead of\nthe analysis and probably way ahead of your argument.\nAt some point I'd like you to address whether or not one\nof the equities the Court can consider is the likelihood\nof an earlier decision. Let's assume we project out\nanother 10 years. Does that make a difference? That\nmay come toward the end of your argument rather than\nnow, but I'd like it addressed at some point.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I certainly will, Your\nHonor. I think it would make sense logically to\nconsider the issues that we think -- there really are\ntwo related sets of considerations that should go into\nthe Court's decision as to whether this suit should be\ndismissed, which is our submission. One relates to the\nRepublic's sovereign immunity. The second relates to\nkind of a broader set of considerations and I think that\nyour question goes to those.\nSo I'll turn first to the sovereign immunity\nquestion. The Republic asserts ownership of these\nassets. Its, its submission is that President Marcos\nmisappropriated them while he served as the president of\nthe Republic. If that is true, then under Philippine\nlaw these assets at all times were the property of the\nRepublic.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Rothfeld, will you\nexplain then how it was that the Philippine Government\nsupported the litigation against Marcos that led to the,\nwhat was it, the $2 billion judgment?\nMR. ROTHFELD: That's right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Said that it had no\nobjection to that suit. In fact, he thought it was a\ngood thing for the Philippines that that litigation go\nforward. But if the government's position is the\njudgment would be uncollectible because all of those\nassets belonged to the Philippine Government and not to\nMarcos's estate, so the -- that whole litigation would\nhave been an exercise in futility.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think not, Justice\nGinsburg, and I think that there is in fact no\ninconsistency at all. The Republic's position at that\ntime was that it had no objection to plaintiffs who were\nvictims of the Marcos regime bringing suit in the United\nStates and they had no -- the Republic had no objection\nto the suit proceeding in this country. Specifically\nthe issue that was before the court that the Republic\nweighed in on was whether the act of state doctrine\nwould preclude adjudication in the United States. The\nRepublic's interest was in making clear that the acts of\nMarcos were not the acts of the Republic, they were not\nofficial acts that the Republic was prepared to defend.\nThe Republic did not then and does not now\nhave any objection to citizens of the Republic\nproceeding in the courts of the United States against\nthe estate of Marcos. The question here is whether or\nnot these assets are in the estate of Marcos. The\nRepublic's submission is that these assets belong to the\nRepublic, that they have never been part of the Marcos\nestate, and that therefore these are sort of ships\npassing in the night, that there can be proceedings\nagainst the estate in this country or elsewhere.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is there anything else in\nthe estate?\nMR. ROTHFELD: There is litigation going on\nin the Philippines now before the Sandiganbayan as to\nwhat is in the estate, and I think that one of the\nproblems, of course, is that, as is true of many corrupt\nregimes that have misappropriated state assets,\nunraveling it is enormously complicated. There were\ndummy corporations, there were smell corporations, which\nis one of the reasons that it has taken so long.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let me ask a slightly\ndifferent question from Justice Scalia's. Is it the\nposition of the Philippine Government that there are any\nassets in the estate that the Philippine Government does\nnot claim?\nMR. ROTHFELD: I think that there are some\nassets. I will not say that they are very substantial\nnumber of assets. Now, I should say --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Enough assets to satisfy\nthe claims of the individuals who -- who brought suit in\nthe United States?\nMR. ROTHFELD: No, there are not and there\nmay never have been.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So the position of the\nPhilippines, going back to Justice Ginsburg's question,\nwas we have no objection and in fact I think it was we\nsupport the litigation in the United States, but when it\ncomes time to collect a judgment we're claiming they\ndon't get a penny because everything belongs to us. Is\nthat a fair summary of the Philippines' position?\nMR. ROTHFELD: I think that is not an\nentirely fair summary, Your Honor. I think -- and\nagain let me say that there are two separate questions:\nOne is whether or not, as a matter of principle, the\nPhilippines objected to its citizens proceeding in the\ncourts of the United States to condemn the regime of\nformer President Marcos.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, they weren't just\nsuing to condemn the regime. They weren't asking for a\ndeclaratory judgment. They were asking for a judgment\nin money.\nMR. ROTHFELD: That is true, Your Honor.\nBut the submission -- and the question is whether there\nis some inconsistency between what the Republic said\nthen and what it says now. The submission then was not\nthat the claimants were entitled to recover assets that\nbelonged to the Republic. The submission was that\nwhatever ended up in the Marcos estate --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but we live in a\npractical world and if in fact there were no apparent\nassets that might satisfy that judgment that the\nPhilippine Government did not claim, then their -- then\ntheir support of the -- of the earlier litigation was at\nthe very least in tension with their -- with their\noverall position.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think that that --\nagain, I would respectfully disagree with that. I think\nthat there was real meaning to the judgment that was\nreturned here even if there is a dispute as to whether\nthere are assets in the Marcos estate. There were two\nsettlements worked out between the Marcos estate and the\nclaimants, with the blessing of the Republic, that would\nhave paid a very substantial amount out of assets\nrecovered from the Marcos -- that were associated with\nMarcos, recovered by the Republic, and the Republic sort\nof blessed payment of those to the claimants here.\nUltimately that was vetoed by the Sandiganbayan as\ninconsistent with Philippine law. But I think that the\nexecutive branch --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then why doesn't the\nRepublic take the position that, because that was vetoed\nfor reasons apart from the Republic's discretion, that\nthe current assets would be an appropriate source of\npayment?\nMR. ROTHFELD: There have been a number of\nefforts in the Philippine Congress, and there is now\npending bills in the Philippine Congress, to compensate\nthe claimants in amounts equivalent to those\nsettlements. So I think that that is something that\ncould happen, but I think it's important to step back\nand say, what is the issue before this Court here? And\nI think all of these considerations are simply divorced\nfrom the Rule 19 issues.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There's one other point\nof Philippine law that's unclear from the briefs. The\nRespondents say they have no right to intervene in the\nproceeding that's going on before the corruption court\nand your brief suggests that there is a right to\nintervene. What is it? Can they become part of that\nlitigation or will they not be heard by the corruption\ncourt?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, we quoted the relevant\nportion of Philippine law, which is equivalent to our\npermissive intervention, which would have permitted the\nclaimants to seek to intervene in the proceeding of the\nSandiganbayan. In fact --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Seek to intervene, but no\nright to intervene?\nMR. ROTHFELD: It is not a matter of right;\nit is permissive intervention.\nI think it's important to bear in mind the\nstatus of the claimants, though, because they're --\ntheir rights are entirely derivative of the Marcos\nestate. They don't claim the Arelma assets, which are\nthe subject of this here before this Court. If the\nMarcos estate is held to have no right to those assets,\nthey have no right at all and they have no rights to be\nprotected.\nSo I think it's -- it is important to\nretreat to the questions that are actually before this\nCourt now about the meaning of Rule 19 and its\napplication in a situation in which there is an absent\nsovereign that has asserted its sovereign immunity. And\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could you address that?\nThat is the issue. Sovereign immunity, is this a\nquestion of where a party is just entitled to plead\ninconsistent theories? Was this a special appearance?\nWhy is it that the Philippines can come into court and\nsay, \"we have sovereign immunity, and therefore the suit\nmust be dismissed\"? Would you just address that basic\npoint?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think that that's --\nsovereign immunity and dismissal under Rule 19 are two\ndifferent but closely related and essential aspects of\nthe relief of the Republic. As a matter of the\nsovereign immunity, all agree at this point that it\ncannot be forced to appear in this proceeding.\nBut that relief is of little good to the\nRepublic if the assets are then going to be awarded by a\nU.S. court to someone else and they are dissipated and\nthey're gone forever. And so it's necessary to protect\nits interest, its sovereign immunity, to make it -- to\neffectuate it -- that the action be dismissed under Rule\n19. And I think that it is something which this Court\nhas recognized that when there is a sovereign that\ncannot be brought into the litigation and the\nsovereign's interests are going to be substantially\nundermined, the sovereign is an indispensable party and\ndismissal is essentially automatic. That's what should\nhave happened here. That's the first mistake that the\ndistrict court made. And I --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why couldn't -- why\ncouldn't the Philippines, not having been a party in\nthis action, pursued whoever did get the assets from\nthis action --\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- in normal\nlitigation, if they objected to the resolution.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, let me amend your\nquestion in one respect. They were a party and of\ncourse as in their -- in their capacity as a party, they\nsought dismissal under Rule 19 as well as dismissal of\nthemselves on sovereign immunity grounds. But to answer\nspecifically --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess they weren't\nthere for the adjudication on the merits.\nMR. ROTHFELD: They were not there for the\nadjudication of the merits, that's right, because they\nhad asserted their sovereign immunity.\nI think that there -- everyone agrees, the\nNinth Circuit itself acknowledged, that once the assets\nhere are disbursed to Respondent and to the plaintiff\nclass, as a practical matter they will be beyond\nrecapture. There is a class of almost 10,000 people.\nAnd when the assets are gone, to reclaim them, even if\nthe Sandiganbayan rules next week that Arelma is now and\nalways has been the property of the Republic, it will be\nas a practical matter impossible to get them back.\nOne suggestion which is made by Respondent\nand by some of its amici is that, because the Republic\nis not bound here, it could bring an action against the\nformer stakeholder of these assets, Merrill Lynch.\nThat, I think, is also clearly an inadequate remedy for\nthe Republic. There is no guarantee that it would be\nable to proceed in such a proceeding sort of\nunencumbered by the judgment here. And if what we are\nlooking for under Rule 19 -- again, there are sort of\ntwo components to this: There is the sovereign immunity\ncomponent, which we think is essentially a per se rule\nrequiring dismissal in circumstances here.\nIf we get beyond that and we say, under Rule\n19 what are the interests that we want to advance, the\nprincipal interest of Rule 19 is that everything gets\naccommodated in a single proceeding, that this gets\nresolved by the whole, as the Court has described it,\nand the only way to accomplish that is dismissal of this\nsuit. If this action is dismissed, the court's judgment\nthat the Republic is an indispensable party in\nlitigation relating to Arelma will be binding on all the\nparticipants to this litigation. That will mean that if\nanybody sues the former stakeholder Merrill Lynch in the\nfuture, that action will be dismissed unless or until\nthe Republic chooses.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Would you agree that the\nRepublic is ultimately not going to be able to collect\nthese funds unless it sues in the United States and\nwaives its immunity in that suit? And is that -- is\nthat relevant to the question of whether it should have\nbeen forced to proceed in this action?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I don't think it's\ndirectly relevant, but I think that if one looks at the\nbigger picture, it is true -- if the Republic -- if this\naction is dismissed, the Sandiganbayan rules, and let's\nsay that it rules for the Republic, the Republic becomes\nthe owner of Arelma. It is then in a position to go to\nMerrill Lynch and say: This is our account; give it to\nus. If Merrill Lynch declines to do that, it is true\nthe Republic will have to seek judicial action in the\nUnited States, but at that point it will be seeking to\nenforce a judgment of the Sandiganbayan. It -- the\nproceeding there will be an enforcement action. And\nhaving -- it being armed with that judgment and having\nthe Philippine courts, which should be the ones that\nresolve this as a matter of first instance, it will be\nan entirely different kind of proceeding. And in that\nproceeding, unlike this one -- as I said, the other side\nsays: Well, you know, not to worry here, because you\ncould sue Merrill Lynch. But that's inconsistent with\nthe purpose of Rule 19, which is to say --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, is it -- is it\nfair to the private claimants here in the United States\nto say, wait until the Philippine court renders a\njudgment in favor of the Philippines, and then they can\ncome in and enforce the judgment against Merrill Lynch\nor whomever is holding the assets?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think if the\nSandiganbayan rules for the Republic, the assets are the\nRepublic's assets. The Republic can seek --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, under the\ndetermination of the Philippine court. But the court\nhere could determine that they're the private claimants'\nassets, as it did.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, it did without the\nparticipation of the Philippines.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you just told\nme that the Philippines court may judge the opposite\nwithout the participation of the private claimants.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, but the -- but again,\nYour Honor, it's important to remember the private\nclaimants have no claim to the Arelma assets. Their\ninterest is entirely derivative of the Marcos estate.\nThe estate --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That seems to me to\nbe an argument on the merits, rather than with respect\nto which case should proceed first.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, it goes, I think, to\nthe question of whether their claim is one which is\nentitled to be heard in the United States. The question\nis, when the Sandiganbayan decides this case as between\nthe two claimants that actually claim ownership of\nArelma, as opposed to derivative rights as to one or the\nother of the claimants, that is the way in which it\nmakes sense to proceed: Have the Sandiganbayan decide\nas between these two claimants, the Republic and the\nestate. Once that's done, all else follows from that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would the private\nclaimants be able to undermine the added force of the\njudgment in the Philippines, assuming a proceeding is\nbrought here, on the ground that they were not allowed\nto participate in the proceeding in the Philippines?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think -- I would say\nprobably not, Your Honor, because again their interests\nare entirely derivative of the Marcos estate. And so I\nthink they may be thought to be in privity with the\nestate, and therefore, they would not have a sort of\nseparate right to challenge that. But I think that we\nshould not anticipate what the future litigation will\nlook like in the United States.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In privity with the\nestate? You're suggesting that the plaintiffs would be\nconnected to the Marcos family that wants to get these\nassets?\nMR. ROTHFELD: No, I do not suggest any\nconnection between them. My only suggestion is that,\nbecause their interest is entirely derivative of the\nestate, the estate has an interest in defending its\ninterest there, and therefore somebody is there\nlitigating the question.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How much of an interest\ndoes the estate have if it is all going to be claimed by\n-- by these private plaintiffs?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, the estate has a -- as\nI say, these assets have been moved around or hidden. I\nthink the estate may well have an interest in keeping\nthem intact and saying that it does have rights.\nBut if I may reserve the remainder of my\ntime, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Rothfeld.\nMr. Kneedler.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nWhen a sovereign government cannot be made a\nparty to a case because of its immunity from suit, that\nfact must be given great weight in determining whether\nthe suit nonetheless may proceed. That is true whether\nthe absent sovereign is the United States, one of the 50\nStates, an Indian tribe or, as here, a foreign state.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: When you say \"great\nweight,\" Mr. Kneedler, then you are not agreeing with\nMr. Rothfeld, who says it's automatic?\nMR. KNEEDLER: We believe it would be\ndispositive in most cases, we think, only if the\nsovereign's interests would be adequately protected by\nthe judgment or in the rare case that we've identified\nin our brief where the sovereign's interests are\nadequately protected by another sovereign, in the case\nof an Indian tribe being protected by the United States.\nBut other than that, or where the United\nStates is in a case against a state, the United States\nbeing the national sovereign, there could be special\ncircumstances, but we think as a whole, the -- as a\ngeneral rule, sovereign immunity controls. And that's\nbecause sovereign immunity represents a fundamental\npolicy judgment either rooted in the Constitution for\nthe United States or the States, or judgments of the\nlegislative branches that the sovereign should not be\nrequired to appear in court.\nA contrary rule allowing the suit to proceed\nwould effectively undermine that rule of immunity and\nallow the sovereign's interest to be tried behind its\nback.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But suppose a case -- and\nyou have to do a lot of supposing. Suppose that the\nPhilippine Government was simply not amenable to the\nprocess of the court, not because of foreign immunity,\nbut just because it was outside the geographic area\nwhere process ran. It just can't be made a party.\nExactly the same analysis as here?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think that's probably\ncorrect if the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act governs\nthe service of process under the Act, and if the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I understand, but in my\nhypothetical case it's just as if somebody is at the\nNorth Pole and you can't serve them.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right. But if the sovereign\n-- if the foreign sovereign can't be sued, I think it's\nall the more -- I mean it can't even be reached -- it\nmay be all the more reason why that interest should be\ngiven weight.\nWe think the sovereign interest in this case\nis particularly compelling for reasons that have already\nbeen stated. The Government of the Philippines claims\nthat it owns these assets. By contrast, the Respondents\nare unsecured judgment creditors. The Government of the\nPhilippines claims it owns these, these assets, under a\nspecial Philippine statute dating to 1955 that declares\nill-gotten gains gained toward -- during time in office,\nforfeit to the government, and it has a strong interest\nin having that dispute resolved in its own courts.\nAs we explain in our brief, the United\nStates strongly supports that position and that interest\nof the United States is strongly supported by the fact\nthat it is a party to a mutual legal assistance treaty\nwith the Philippines. Such treaties are common in this\ncountry. There is a comparable treaty between the\nPhilippines and the Swiss Government which led to the\nrepatriation from Switzerland to the Philippines of a\nlarge --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Kneedler,\ngetting back to your previous point, why isn't the\nPhilippine National -- why don't -- why doesn't the\nPhilippine National Bank adequately represent the\ninterest of the Republic? Under Philippine law, as I\nunderstand, any recovery by the bank in this case would\nbe the property of the Philippines.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Because the Philippines --\nexcuse me. The Philippine National Bank is an escrow\nagent. It would have a conflict of interest in\nrepresenting the interests of the Government of the\nPhilippines with respect to its prior claim to the\nassets as against the Marcos estate. PNB is holding\nthese assets in escrow pending the outcome of the very\nlitigation we are talking about in the Philippines.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they are --\nthey're certainly subject to Philippine law, and I\nunderstand that there's no dispute that under Philippine\nlaw the assets would be taken from the Philippine\nNational Bank for the benefit of the government.\nMR. KNEEDLER: That's true, but the\ninterests of the Philippine Government in obtaining --\nin having its interest confirmed that it owns these\nassets as of the time of the wrongdoing going back to\n1972, that interest would not be advanced by PNB because\nPNB is holding them in escrow depending -- pending the\noutcome of that very dispute between the Marcoses and\nthe Philippine Government and couldn't be expected to\nadvance in this case the Government of the Philippines'\ninterest or claim of ownership to those assets.\nOne other international agreement I wanted\nto mention was the Convention Against Corruption, to\nwhich the United States is a party. And also there is a\nstatute passed by Congress, 2467, that provides for\nforfeiture in the United States of assets that are\ndeemed to be forfeited pursuant to a foreign proceeding.\nSo international agreements --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Doesn't that depend on\nthere being a foreign judgment, which we don't have in\nthis case?\nMR. KNEEDLER: We -- we don't have it yet,\nbut that -- that reflects the important interest of\nhaving our courts stay their hands pending the outcome\nof the proceedings in the Philippines in which that\nwould be determined.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't it also a\nrequirement that in that proceeding in the foreign\nnation that all claimants would have an opportunity to\nbe heard, which is not true here?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, what -- what the\nstatute requires is that the foreign proceedings be in\naccordance with due process and that parties claiming an\n-- an interest in the property be entitled to be\npresent. Again, the claimants here do not claim an\ninterest in the property as an owner.\nThey are unsecured judgment creditors of the\n-- of the Marcos estate, and it -- it might be useful to\nthink about what is true in the reverse situation, in\nthe forfeiture proceeding brought by the United States\nin U.S. courts against a criminal defendant, for\nexample. An unsecured creditor of the -- of the\ndefendant claiming the assets is typically found not\neven to have standing to intervene. But if it does\nintervene, it would not have a claim superior to that of\nthe United States because it wouldn't be a bona fide\npurchaser of the assets, and it wouldn't be without\nknowledge of the illegal conduct.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Kneedler, may I ask\nyou this question: Would the case be different if there\nwere secured creditors rather than judgment creditors?\nMR. KNEEDLER: In -- in U.S. courts a\nsecured creditor would get past the standing stage, but\nwould not -- would not get past the bona fide purchaser\nfor value without knowledge of the wrongdoing.\nIn this case it has been clear since 1986,\nfor example, that the Government of the Philippines has\n-- has been seeking the repatriation of Arelma and its\nassets.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it's been doing it on\na fairly sporadic basis. If I remember the facts\ncorrectly, first it got a stay with respect to the\ndisposition of assets, and then the stay expired and the\ngovernment didn't do anything about it, and then the\ngovernment didn't come into action again until this\nparticular claim was raised.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I think it --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe -- let me put the --\nsort of my response in the form of a question. In\ndrawing or refusing to draw the conclusion of\n\"indispensable party,\" do you claim that a court may or\nmay not consider the equitable or inequitable behavior\nof the government?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- perhaps in an\nextreme case, but I -- first of all, I think the courts\nof the United States should be very reluctant to deem a\nforeign government's conduct inequitable in the sense\nthat you're describing it. And I think, for the reasons\nMr. Rothfeld said, repatriating these assets is an\nextremely complicated thing. But the Philippines\nGovernment sought these assets in -- beginning in 1986,\nobtained a freeze order in 1986, again in 1990. It got\na final determination by the district attorney in\nSwitzerland in 1995, confirmed by the federal court of\nSwitzerland in 1997, that the assets could be returned.\nThese assets, the shares, the Arelma shares, however,\nwere not actually returned until 2000 by the Swiss\nGovernment.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any explanation\nwhy the freeze that was imposed by a U.S. court in 1987\nwas simply allowed to lapse?\nMR. KNEEDLER: That was the preliminary\ninjunction and I'm not sure what happened after that.\nBut I did want -- the proceedings in Switzerland, I did\nwant to make clear, because there was a suggestion that\nthe Philippine Government was duplicitous by encouraging\nthis suit and at the same time seeking the assets. But\nas I just pointed out. It has been clear since 1986 and\nthrough a whole series of proceedings in Switzerland and\nin the Philippines that the Government of the\nPhilippines has been claiming all of the Marcos assets,\nspecifically including the Arelma assets --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, maybe --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- from the very beginning.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, maybe they have been\nhave been candid about their claims, but they -- in\nreal-world practical terms, the claim to these assets\nand the representation at the same time that it's\nappropriate for these people to proceed in the United\nStates for a money judgment, are at least in some\ntension with each other, aren't they?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I do not believe so. If we\nthought about an analogy at the United States, if the\nUnited States filed a brief in this Court saying that a\nformer Government official could be sued, did not have\nqualified immunity and could be sued in his personal\ncapacity, or didn't -- or could be sued individually and\nthe Westfall Act did not protect him, that would in no\nway make -- be a representation by the United States\nthat a judgment against that officer could be satisfied\nout of assets of the United States, including assets\nthat the United States might be seeking to recover\nfrom -- from the defendant.\nAnd we think the Philippine Government is in\nessentially the same position. And a finding of\nliability in this case -- the judgment does constitute a\nfinding of liability so that with respect to -- it would\ngive these Respondents here the ability to go to\nPhilippine court, to file a claim in the probate\nproceedings in the Philippines as these Respondents have\ndone. So the judgment, even without being satisfied,\nserves the Respondents' interests to a great extent.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Kneedler.\nMr. Swift.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. SWIFT\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. SWIFT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI would like to address as a first point the\nissue you raise, which is perhaps seminal to you, and\nthat is whether there is an adequate alternative remedy\nto the human rights victims, either in the United States\nor in the Philippines. Our answer is, unequivocally,\nthere is no remedy.\nLet me talk about the Philippines first.\nAny forfeiture proceeding in the Philippines is in rem.\nIts supreme court has so declared. These assets are in\nthe United States. There cannot be two jurisdictions\nthat share in rem assets.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, doesn't the -- maybe\nthis makes no difference, but doesn't the Philippine\nNational Bank have the -- whatever they call them, the\nshare certificates or stock certificates that represent\nthe Arelma assets at this point?\nMR. SWIFT: That's right. Switzerland\nconfiscated those certificates from a Swiss financier\nand transferred them to the Philippines.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Couldn't they --\ncouldn't they bring an in rem in the Philippines based\non the presence in the Philippines of those two\ncertificates?\nMR. SWIFT: They can, and that's in fact\nwhat is occurring.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. SWIFT: However, it's also apparent from\nthe facts in this case that those certificates were\nnever the property of the Philippine Government, never,\never. There is absolute clear evidence in this record,\nin the joint appendix on that, which makes the whole\nissue --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought the issue in the\nPhilippines is the question of whether the money that\nwent into the stock certificates eventually belonged to\nthe people of the Philippines from the beginning or\nbelonged to Marcos personally?\nMR. SWIFT: Well, that's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And you're saying that\nthere's no possibility whatsoever that a Philippine\ncourt could say that this money initially belonged to\nthe people of the Philippines?\nMR. SWIFT: They could not say that in a\nforfeiture proceeding because --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm saying whether they --\nI don't care what the name of the proceeding is. I'm\nsaying could they decide that?\nMR. SWIFT: Yes, sir, absolutely.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, if they\ndecide that, why should your clients, terribly treated\nas they were, get the money ahead of the victims in the\nPhilippines, who also were terribly treated?\nMR. SWIFT: Because the judgment in the\nPhilippines would not be in rem, Mr. Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought Justice Souter\njust answered that. He said that the stock certificates\nmight be held to belong to the people of the\nPhilippines, in which case the stock certificates\nrepresent stock in a company that has a claim against\nMerrill Lynch, and so they will say, this certificate\nbelongs to the people of the Philippines; the people of\nthe Philippines would like you, Merrill Lynch, to pay\nback the money that the company gave them initially.\nAnd Merrill Lynch I imagine would pay it. Now that I\nthink is as I understand it. Is there something wrong\nwith my understanding?\nMR. SWIFT: I think your understanding is\ncorrect in that regard; however, the law both in the\nPhilippines and in the United States draws a clear\ndistinction between the ownership of stock and a\ncorporation's ownership of assets. Certainly Dole v.\nPatrickson stands for that proposition.\nThe -- a judgment rendered as to the\ncertificates in the Philippines or even as to the assets\nwould not be in rem. So if that judgment came over to\nthe United States to be enforced, they would stand in\nthe same position as any other judgment creditor, not a\njudgment creditor with a claim to specific assets, but a\njudgment creditor as to a specific amount of money.\nLet me answer another question which was\nasked --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I would like you to\naddress -- you seem to put heavy weight on this in rem\ncharacterization. That is a judgment there's a thing.\nBut our law over the years has come to appreciate that\nthings do not have rights; people have rights in things.\nSo we have modified the once rigid notion that the suit\nis against a thing, to recognize that it's people's\nrights in the thing that count. And your use of that\nlabel seems to forget about all the more recent\nunderstanding.\nMR. SWIFT: Justice Ginsburg, I believe\ninterpleader is, statutory interpleader, is an in rem\nnature of a proceeding. In fact, it was the best and\nmost appropriate and the only proceeding in which all\nclaimants could be -- their claims could be heard. It's\na shame that the Philippine Government didn't come in,\nas it did in twelve other cases it brought in the United\nStates, including two interpleaders, to say: Yes and\nthis is our evidence. What it suggests is that they had\nno evidence to support it, and they want to be in their\nown court. Why do they want to be in their own court?\nBecause it won't be defended by the Marcoses. And the\nvery rule that they cited in their reply brief -- and by\nthe way, the reply brief was the first time in all this\nlitigation they have ever asserted that the human rights\nvictims have a remedy by intervening in the\nSandiganbayan in the Philippines. We don't. The rule\nthat they quote says as to assets in the court.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did -- did the district\ncourt in Hawaii or the Ninth Circuit ever decide what\nthe Petitioners tell us is the basic question, that is\ndo these assets belong to the Philippine Government\nunder that 1955 statute, or do they belong to the Marcos\nestate? It seemed to me that our courts were just\nassuming that the assets belonged to the Marcos estate\nand that the plaintiffs in the lawsuit were creditors of\nthe Marcos estate.\nMR. SWIFT: Your Honor is correct that there\nwas an underlying belief by the court, that the court\naccepted as valid the Republic's claim that it owned the\nassets, the assets were stolen. But the evidence in the\ncase, and the two lower courts specifically found on the\nbasis of that evidence, that these were Marcos assets;\nand this finding was made after the completion of\ndiscovery, after a deposition in -- in France.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it didn't say, find,\nthat: And they belong to the Marcos estate and not the\nPhilippine Government.\nMR. SWIFT: Not the latter part of your\nequation. They did not say that they did not belong to\nthe Philippine Government. By saying they belonged to\nFerdinand Marcos it was sufficient, it was sufficient\nevidence.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I didn't see that finding\nin the court of appeals decision. I thought the court\nof appeals thought that they belonged -- they couldn't\npossibly belong to the Philippine Government or the\npeople there, because there is no way that the\nPhilippine Government could win in a suit in New York in\ntrying to recover them. But the Solicitor General has\nprovided about two or three ways, in which and so -- and\nso have the Petitioners -- and that seems to me the\nheart of the issue. They have said: No, no, there are\ntwo or three ways in which the Philippine Government\nmight well -- it might well ask a court for the money\nand the court would say, yes, you're entitled to it.\nSo that it seems to me, that's the heart of\nit. What is your response to that?\nMR. SWIFT: I'd like to go through each way\nin which they say they can and convince you that they\ncan't. First, they could proceed in a forfeiture\nproceeding in the Philippines. But of course that\nwouldn't be in rem, so they couldn't get to first base\nas to the assets. As to the share certificates, yes,\nbut of course that in effect is a nullity because they\nnever belonged to the Philippine Government. That\naside, we put aside that factual --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Wait a minute. I missed\nyour last step. If it's an in rem proceeding against\nthe share certificates what -- what difference does it\nmake whether they ever belonged to the Philippines?\nMR. SWIFT: Because ownership of the share\ncertificates is not a right to the assets, a per se\nright. There would have to be some additional rights.\nThe assets are ones --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So you're saying an in rem\nproceeding against the certificates simply will not\nresolve the issue; that's the -- that's the guts of the\nanswer.\nMR. SWIFT: That's correct. The other two,\ntwo types of proceedings, one could be a conversion and\none breach of contract, both of which would be barred by\nstatute of limitations.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, well, that isn't what\nthey say. I think, if I understand it, that they say\nthat were the share certificates in the hands of the\nPhilippine Government on the ground, that the money used\nto create those had been taken from the Philippine\npeople unlawfully, if that's what they decide, at that\npoint the owner of the certificates, the government,\nwould say to Merrill Lynch: We own the company, the\ncompany has the assets; please send us the money. And\nMerrill Lynch would do it.\nBut if Merrill Lynch didn't do it, then they\nwould file the judgment saying, these are our share\ncertificates, in the New York court and say, will you\nplease enforce the judgment. Now, there is something\nthere that I'm not quite getting and that's why I want\nyou to respond to the line of happenings that I just\nsuggested.\nMR. SWIFT: Well, an important fact that you\nleft out was that in the year 2000, when the Philippine\nGovernment through PNB controlled the Arelma\ncertificates, a request to Merrill Lynch was made. The\nrequest was refused. So if there was a breach it\noccurred in the year 2000. Remember, after the\ncertificates were transferred from Switzerland to the\nPhilippines the PNB then created a new board of\ndirectors and they went directly to Merrill Lynch.\nThe whole point of this exercise was, of\ncourse, to circumvent the courts of the United States.\nI only learned about the assets in the year 2000 and\nthen proceeded to try to recover them.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But may I ask you this\nquestion, though. Merrill Lynch refused in the year\n2000, but if the proceeding that Justice Breyer has just\nbeen describing takes place and there is a judgment to\nthe effect that the share certificates are properly held\nor the property of the Philippine Government, and the\nPhilippine Government now makes, or then, makes a new\nrequest to Merrill Lynch, the fact that they made a\nrequest that was refused in 2000, which may be too late\nto sue on, isn't going to prevent them from suing on\ntheir present adjudication that they are the true owners\nof the share certificates and want the money.\nMR. SWIFT: But I believe there is an\nimportant part of the equation that's left out of that\nquestion, and that is the rights of the Philippine\ngovernment as the new shareholder will not be any\ngreater than those of the prior shareholder. The prior\nshareholder made a demand and did not receive the money.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. You're saying -- I\nthink you're saying that the demand would be ineffectual\nthis time for the same reason it was ineffectual the\nlast time.\nMR. SWIFT: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And the suggestion I\nthought that Justice Breyer had made and that I made was\nthis time they can do something further. They can take\nthe judgment and go into a United States court and say:\nWe've got this judgment, there's no question that these\nshares and what they represent are ours; so make Merrill\nLynch give us the money. What prevents them from doing\nthat?\nMR. SWIFT: Nothing prevents them from\nmaking the demand. But when they go into court and ask\nfor that, first of all, Merrill Lynch can do what it did\nhere, which is to file an interpleader and say: We want\nall the claimants to come forth and make the claim.\nThen we have a redo.\nWhat we have below is a judgment, a judgment\nthat we're seeking to enforce and we contend that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the difference in\nthe redo is that in the second case that's just been\nhypothesized, the Philippine government is represented.\nWe are making these assumptions, and the Philippines\ngovernment says: You can make these assumptions, but\nthey may very well be wrong; we want to be represented\nbefore you make those assumptions.\nMR. SWIFT: Well, they had that right in the\nyear 2000 when they chose to exercise their sovereign\nimmunity. So, what has changed? They would have to\nwaive their sovereign immunity to go --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Any party that's beyond\nthe process of the court has a right to come in. The\nquestion is what happens if they are not there.\nMR. SWIFT: Well, they were brought in.\nThey chose to exit. They then paid for the prosecution\nof claims by PNB and Arelma, in effect acting as\nsurrogate, reflective of a question that was asked\nearlier. Then when they were dissatisfied with the\nresult, they then want to use PNB and Arelma to upset\nthat pursuant to a Rule 19(b) motion.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There is a huge change.\nThe change would be that they'd a judgment of that\nspecial court over there that this company and the\nassets understandably belong to us, not to the Marcoses.\nAnd so this time, they go with that judgment to Merrill\nLynch and say: Give us the money.\nAnd if they -- if they don't -- if Merrill\nLynch says no -- Merrill Lynch might say yes, but you'll\nsay, no, it belongs to us, so they might not. And if\nthey don't, then the Philippines are never going to get\nthe money, unless they bring the lawsuit. And once they\nbring the lawsuit, then you have them, because then you\ngo right into the court in that lawsuit and intervene\nand they have waived all their sovereign immunity, et\ncetera, they can't get the money.\nMR. SWIFT: Then you have a redo of what\nthey started out this proceeding doing --\nJUSTICE BREYER: With a difference.\nMR. SWIFT: -- which was judge shopping and\nforum shopping. They were -- they were --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But isn't that what --\nthat's what sovereign immunity means. I mean, they do\nhave the right to pick their forum. You say I can only\nbe sued when I consent, so I can consent where I will.\nThe problem with what you're presenting is\nit sounds like, yes, you have sovereign immunity, you\ndon't have to be part of this lawsuit and it can't\naffect your rights, but then when it seems to be\neventual judgment, it's a default judgment effectively\nagainst the Philippines, because they can never get\nthose assets once they're disbursed. So, it's a -- it's\nkind of a deceptive immunity, because by asserting the\nimmunity they are going to lose their opportunity to\nclaim these assets.\nMR. SWIFT: Well, what Your Honor is\nsuggesting is that there should be a per se rule under\nRule 19(b). I don't believe it's the role of this Court\nto change Rule 19(b).\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Not necessarily. I'm\nfocusing on this situation. There could be others.\nMR. SWIFT: Well, then we have two lower\ncourts that have balanced and weighed all appropriate\nfactors. There is no suggesting that there are other\nfactors. They -- I believe that the standard of review\nfor this Court is whether or not the lower courts\nconsidered the factors and engaged in an appropriate\nbalancing and weighing --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In making that balancing,\nwhat weight did they give to the sovereign immunity of\nthe Philippines?\nMR. SWIFT: Significant weight. The Ninth\nCircuit said it was a powerful factor. And then it went\ninto other factors, some of which Justice Ginsburg\nmentioned: The 22-year delay. They have known about\nthis for a long time.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that the Ninth\nCircuit went on a statute of limitations in New York.\nIt didn't give the sovereign immunity claim, it seems,\nin the end of the day any weight, because it says we\ndon't have to worry about the Philippines being out of\nthis case because they would have no claim on the\nmerits.\nMR. SWIFT: Let me pose a different example\nto you, Justice Ginsburg, and that is, what if this were\na bankruptcy proceeding and the foreign sovereign said:\nOh, those assets really belong to us, they were stolen,\nand we'll decide that in our country.\nNow, it could be any country of the world.\nWould the U.S. court stand for that? Are U.S. courts\nsupposed to give away and surrender and be ousted of\ntheir own jurisdiction in in rem actions and farm out\ndecisions to foreign countries? And in our case we're\nnot even going to be represented, nor will the Marcoses?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So there might be a\ndifferent situation in your hypothetical with respect to\nbankruptcy. In effect, there's an administrator against\nwhom the Philippines could proceed, unlike the situation\nhere, where you have a class and which the prospect of\nthe Philippines proceeding later is not realistic.\nMR. SWIFT: Well, I submit that the\nunderlying principle is a solid one, and that is U.S.\ncourts do have in rem jurisdiction. We have 28 U.S.C.\n1655. It's one of the oldest forms of jurisdiction we\nhave in this country. And we should not be surrendering\nthat to a foreign sovereign and farming out per decision\ndecisions about assets. These assets are not\ntransitory. They have been here 35 years.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but may I ask a sort\nof -- maybe it's too elementary a question, but has any\ncourt ever decided the merits of the question whether\nthe Marcos estate or the Philippine Government owns\nthese assets?\nMR. SWIFT: The lower court -- well, not as\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It decided there was no\nremedy, I understand that. But has it decided the\nmerits of the basic dispute?\nMR. SWIFT: It has, based on evidence, based\non depositions, that these assets belonged to Marcos.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where is that? Then why\nwere they bothering with the statute of limitations?\nBoth courts said that the action would be time barred in\nNew York. But if they made a definitive ruling that the\nassets belonged to the Marcos estate and not the\nPhilippine Government, then that would be preclusive.\nMR. SWIFT: I -- are you saying that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I just did not find in\neither the district court or the court of appeals an\nanswer to that basic question: Whose assets are they?\nIt seemed to me they were assuming the assets belonged\nto the estate and not to the Philippine Government, but\nthey made no specific finding on that issue.\nMR. SWIFT: There are a number of findings,\nbut obviously, because the Philippine Government was not\na party in the case, there was no finding specific to\nthe Philippine Government. But the finding that they\nwere -- belonged to Ferdinand Marcos is sufficient. You\ndo not need the counter-finding that they did not belong\nto the Republic.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But then you're ignoring\na 1955 law that says anything that belongs to Marcos\nthat he didn't get legitimately belongs to the\ngovernment.\nMR. SWIFT: Well, again, that's a forfeiture\nissue. The assets have to be in the Philippines, and\nthere have been many forfeiture proceedings in the\nPhilippines as to Marcos assets.\nTo answer a question Justice Kennedy raised\nearlier, aren't there other assets, they've have already\nrecovered over a billion dollars of assets. There is\nstill hundreds of millions, if not a billion, in the\nPhilippines.\nYou know, from the record and what I've\nsubmitted, that we're not able to transfer our American\njudgment to the Philippines. The United Nations Human\nRights Committee has even found a violation of\ninternational law by the Republic in preventing us from\ndoing that. We've had to go to that body. Do we think\nthat we are going to get justice in a Philippine court\nthat's never adjudicated human rights violation, much\nless our right to the assets? Think how easy it would\nbe for the Marcoses and the Philippine Government to\nsimply make a deal as to these assets.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because aren't those\nissues that could be addressed when the Philippines\nattempt to enforce a judgment they would get in the\nPhilippines if they do in fact get such a judgment?\nMR. SWIFT: Well, then we run into such\nissues like the act of state doctrine. And we have --\nthen we will -- our defense will be undermined because\nthey will say a U.S. court cannot re-examine those --\nthat determination. So it's a catch-22 for us. We\nproceeded as we were --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do you have -- I mean I\ndon't see you have a claim there as opposed to the --\nthe worst that would happen, not necessarily good for\nyour clients, but the worst that would happen would be\nthat the assets would be devoted to victims and their\nfamilies in the Philippines. I mean, namely to the\nPhilippine people. So I don't see some kind of\nfundamental unfairness here, unless you can point one\nout.\nMR. SWIFT: Well, I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean they'll treat you\nlike another creditor and you have -- but is there some\nterrible unfairness going on?\nMR. SWIFT: What Your Honor is suggesting is\nthat a useful approach to this case is to say, well, if\nthe Philippine Government gets the money, then won't\nthat benefit everybody? Well, then you have to look at\nthe characteristic of the country, something I'm very\nfamiliar with but which I don't want to -- I think it\nwould be inappropriate in this proceeding to talk about.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there -- is there\nsomething special going on, specially unfair, in respect\nto the delays where you are treated differently than\nother litigants in the Philippines?\nMR. SWIFT: Yes. There was purposeful delay\nin us being able to transfer our judgment. We are just\nin the pleadings stage after 11 years there.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, what does\nunfairness have to do with it? I mean the whole\ndoctrine of sovereign immunity rests upon unfairness.\nIt says you can't sue the sovereign even if you have a\nvalid claim. And when we say we will apply the same\ndoctrine as to foreign sovereigns, it means the same\nthing. I'm just not terribly persuaded by the fact that\nit has unfair consequences. The doctrine of sovereign\nimmunity always has unfair consequences. So, unless\nyou're asking us to abandon the doctrine, the fairness\nargument does not persuade me.\nMR. SWIFT: Well, I think the issue was\nresolved pursuant to 19(b). Unless this Court\ndetermines that there is a per se rule under 19(b), we\nweigh factors, and it's the role of this Court to\ndetermine whether or not there was -- the lower courts\ndid not make a decision based on equity and good\nconscience, one of the broadest parameters of\ndecisionmaking provided by a lower court.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I go back on exactly\nthat point on the equity to Justice Breyer's last\nquestion? I thought you had given or anticipated his\nquestion in something you said a moment ago, and then\nyou didn't repeat it, and I may have misunderstood you.\nI thought you had told us that the courts of the\nPhilippines did not recognize, for enforcement purposes\nthere, the judgment that your clients had obtained in\nthe United States, and that in effect they, therefore,\nif they were going to make a claim on assets in the\nPhilippines, they would have to start from scratch\nagain. Is that correct? Did I misunderstand you?\nMR. SWIFT: Well, our judgment has not been\nenforced. They asked -- initially asked for a filing\nfee of $8.4 million. We appealed that, after eight\nyears and some months. They finally said, yes, the\nfiling fee is $10. So, it was sent back down where\nthere was still more delay. I mean, I'm a realist. I\nmean, how many years is it going to take?\nJUSTICE ALITO: So they just -- they in fact\nare obstructing the process --\nMR. SWIFT: That's right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- trying to recognize it?\nMR. SWIFT: And the U.N. -- the United\nNations Human Rights Committee has so found.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let me ask you this: Did\nthe Philippine Government formally take a position in\nraising these obstructive barriers, the $8 million\nfiling fee, for example?\nMR. SWIFT: It did not.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. That was sua sponte\nwith the court?\nMR. SWIFT: It was sua sponte with the --\nactually raised with the Marcoses initially, and the\ncourt simply said yes, it's $8.4 million.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't that -- I mean it\nsounds shocking, but I thought that in the Philippines,\nas in many countries, the filing fee is determined by\nwhat you're asking for. So it would be a percentage of\n$2 billion. And if they just did that automatically,\nthen you say, oh, but, but this -- the filing fee of\nthat size would mean that the Plaintiffs can't sue. But\nthat's -- but it wasn't they picked whatever figure,\nfiling fee, out of a hat; it was a percentage of what\nwas sought in the litigation right?\nMR. SWIFT: That's -- you're correct in your\nanalysis. The -- except there was another provision of\nthe fee statute which we went under and which they\nultimately -- the Philippine Supreme Court said that we\nwere correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, before you\nsit down, you haven't mentioned anything about your\nargument that the Philippines don't have the right to\nraise this. Are you throwing in the towel on that one?\nMR. SWIFT: Absolutely not. We think that\nargument is definitive. First, on one hand, with regard\nto the Philippine Government and its PCGG: They were\nnot parties to the judgment. Therefore under Karcher,\nMarino, Devlin --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the\nPhilippines National Bank and Arelma were, and of course\nthey've appealed. And I understand the law to be they\ncan raise these arguments. We don't have need to have\nan independent basis for the Philippines.\nMR. SWIFT: That's true, but we've also\npointed out that Arelma and PNB have thrown in the towel\nas to the merits. Remember, they're parties that are\nseparate parties. They had claims on the merits. Their\nclaims were resolved against them inter se, and so they\nno longer have a dog in the fight.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, they do because if\nthey are able to successfully knock out the judgment,\nthen they are back to square one. Then they -- they\nlost on the merits, but that judgment would be wiped\nout.\nMR. SWIFT: Well, perhaps under Rule 19(b)\nthe lower court may still rule that there is a -- a\ndefinitive judgment as to them against other creditors.\nAnd in fact that -- there has been --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If there was no authority\nof the court to proceed, then the judgment is -- is as\nthough it were never made.\nMR. SWIFT: Well, that's perhaps one way of\nlooking at it, Justice Ginsburg. I submit to you that\nthe -- the decision I would respectfully request you\nlook at is Horizon Bank and Trust Company versus\nMassachusetts, where the same facts occurred. The First\nCircuit -- Massachusetts did the same thing the Republic\nof the Philippines did here. It did the two-step dance:\nWe're sovereign, we're indispensable. It was denied by\nthe lower court. The lower court then, since the United\nStates was a party and the State didn't have immunity as\nto that, it went into the merits determination.\nMassachusetts appealed only appealed only the 19(b)\ndecision. And the Court of Appeals held that because\nthey had not appealed the merits decision, the same as\nhere, therefore, there was no longer a live controversy,\nand live controversy is a requirement of standing in\nthis Court, or power to appeal in this Court.\nSo, in addition, although there isn't a lot\nof case law in this Court on this particular point, I\nwould refer you to the Ashcroft v. Mattis decision\nbecause the same principle was applied there where there\nwas no appeal permitted to this Court. Finally, the\none thing that I have not really addressed is Merrill\nLynch's interest. The whole nature of \"interpleader\" is\nthat the stakeholder should have an adequate remedy.\nMerrill Lynch has significant business interests, as do\nmany banks, many insurance companies, in getting a\nresolution. This matter, in itself, has gone on for\neight years. There have been over a dozen appeals in\nthis particular piece of litigation.\nDoesn't -- isn't there a significant\nbusiness interest that has to be weighed in that\nequation so that Merrill Lynch -- only a stakeholder\nwill continue to have to defend, defend, defend,\ninterplead and so forth?\nI submit to you that there is a policy\njudgment that has to be made by this Court as to the\nrules with regard to interpleader and in rem proceedings\nand whether this Court is prepared to surrender\njurisdiction to foreign courts to make --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If -- if the proceeding\ncan't go forward because of sovereign immunity, that\njudgment would shield Merrill Lynch from any other\nclaim. It could say to any other claimant: Sorry, a\nbinding judgment has been issued saying this matter\ncan't be settled without the Philippines being in it.\nSo I don't really get your: Merrill Lynch is going to\nbe subject to repeated proceedings. They will be armed\nwith a judgment that says, suit can't go on without the\nPhilippines being there.\nMR. SWIFT: Well, let me -- let me take you\non, on that point. We have one other remedy, and that\nis execution. Execution doesn't require joinder of all\nparties. It's a singular proceeding that people can\njoin in, but we would have the right to execute, and you\ncan bet that that is exactly what we will do.\nSo, to some extent, what is being argued\nhere is somewhat besides the point because if that money\ngoes back to Merrill Lynch, we can, and will, execute on\nthat.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Rothfeld, you have three minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITONER\nMR. ROTHFELD: Thank you, Your Honor.\nA couple of points. First of all, there is\nno doubt that the Republic has a substantial interest in\nthe assets that are at stake here. And, therefore, its\nsovereign immunity, at least in the context of this\ncase, should be dispositive and should have led to\ndismissal under Rule 19.\nThere -- this Court in the Provident case\nnoted that there are certain compelling, substantive\nconsiderations that are dispositive under Rule 19 that\nmake it unnecessary to consider any other balancing\nconsideration. Sovereign immunity is one such\nconsideration. And because the Republic has immunity,\nhas asserted immunity --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You agree that the Ninth\nCircuit gave sovereign immunity great weight in the\nbalancing?\nMR. ROTHFELD: I think it gave it no weight\nat all. I think it said that, yes, in theory, sovereign\nimmunity is entitled to weight. But in this case we are\ngoing to ignore it completely because we believe that if\nthe Republic appears in New York and asserts its\ninterests, it will lose under statute of limitation\ngrounds. That is a completely inappropriate way of\ntreating it.\nOnce the sovereign immunity was asserted and\nthere was a substantial interest in the asset here, as\nthere undoubtedly was, that should have been the end of\nthe matter.\nThe second point is there is no question\nthat, ultimately, this is a dispute between the Marcos\nestate and the Republic. There is no question that the\nclaims of the Respondents here are entirely derivative\nof the Marcos estate; and, therefore, that is something\nthat has to be decided first: Whether this belongs to\nthe estate, the Respondents, or the Republic. And that\nis a determination that should be made in the courts of\nthe Philippines.\nIt is not a question of surrendering the\njurisdiction of U.S. courts. There is a general\nconsensus that stolen assets, assets stolen by corrupt\nleaders, should be returned to the nation of origin, and\ndetermination as to ownership should be made by the\ncourts of that nation. That's stated on the U.N.\nConvention on Corruption to which the U.S. and the\nPhilippines are a party.\nAll of the nations that have an interest in\nthe relevant assets, not only the Republic but the\nUnited States and Switzerland, all agreed that it is\nappropriate for the Sandiganbayan to make that\ndetermination as between the Republic and the estate.\nIf it's ruled for the estate, the Respondent\ncan attempt to collect as a judgment creditor. If it\ngoes to the Republic, the Republic can assert its\ninterest directly with Merrill Lynch as the owner of\nArelma. If Merrill Lynch declines to pay, it can in a\nnumber of ways try to enforce its -- either with the\nassistance of the United States according to U.S.\nstatute, in which case the Sandiganbayan's factual\ndeterminations would be dispositive, or it can bring an\naction under -- under New York law. That is the only\nway in which there could be a single proceeding that\nresolves everybody's interests.\nIn this proceeding, as all agree, the\nRepublic is free, for whatever it is actually worth, to\nsue Merrill Lynch. That is precisely what Rule 19 is\ndesigned to avoid, duplicative litigation, the\npossibility of duplicative liability.\nIf the Sandiganbayan rules, the Republic\ncomes here and initiates an action, everybody who has a\nclaim can be brought into that action. As Justice\nGinsburg noted, there is no possibility that Merrill\nLynch could be subjected to duplicative liability\nbecause this Court's judgment would determine that the\nRepublic is an indispensable party.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n"
