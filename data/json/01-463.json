        "content": "(10:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Number 01-463, United States v. Fior\nD'Italia. Ms. O'Connor..\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EILEEN J. O'CONNOR\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. O'CONNOR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case is about the authority of the\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue to assess FICA taxes that\nCongress has imposed on employers. It also involves the\nwell-established principle of tax litigation. It involves\ntwo key sections of the Internal Revenue Code and how they\nrelate to each other, and it involves the evidentiary\nvalue of assessment in tax litigation.\nThe first of the key sections is section 6201.\nIt appears at page 62a of the appendix to our petition.\nIt authorizes and requires the Secretary of the Treasury\nto make inquiries, determinations, and assessments of all\ntaxes imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The second\nkey section is 3111. It appears at page 55a of the\nappendix to our petition. This section imposes a tax on\nemployers. The tax is measured by the wages they pay or\nare deemed to have paid their employees.\nQUESTION: Which section is this, Ms. O'Connor?\nI'm --\nMS. O'CONNOR: Section 3111 at page 55a of our\nappendix to the petition.\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nMS. O'CONNOR: This is the tax that imposes --\nthis is the provision that imposes a tax on the wages\nemployers pay or are deemed to have paid their employees.\nThe question this case presents is how the\ncommissioner carries out his obligation under 6201 to\nassess the tax that is imposed by section 3111. The tax\nis --\nQUESTION: Ms. O'Connor, let me tell you what\ntroubles me a little about the Government's position in\nthe case, and I hope you will address this. How can an\nemployer ever challenge effectively an assessment made\nunder the position that you approach, because the normal\nburden of proof in a tax refund case normally requires the\nemployer to show exactly how much money was owed, and I\ndon't see how that would work in this context.\nMS. O'CONNOR: Exactly, Your Honor. The\nCongress has recognized the difficulty that employers have\nin this regard, and that is the reason there are several\nof the other sections that we will discussing this\nmorning. Section 6205, for example, is mentioned in your\nmaterials. That is a provision that permits employers on\ntheir own, if they discover an error, to correct it later\nand have no interest assessed. That's a very unusual\nprovision, and it relates specifically to the complexity\nof employment taxes and their administration.\nQUESTION: Well, would that error ever be\nanything more than a disparity between what the employee\nreported and what the employer reported?\nMS. O'CONNOR: Would what, Your Honor?\nQUESTION: How -- I mean, the error that that\nsection -- I'm wondering what the error is that that\nsection contemplates, and I can see it's application,\nlet's say, if the employer simply added up the employee's\nreports wrong and got the wrong figure. Under what other\ncircumstances would it apply short of the moment at which\nthe Government makes the assessment which is in question\nhere?\nMS. O'CONNOR: It could also apply just -- and\n6205 is not specific to restaurants or food or beverage\nestablishments or tips at all, because another common\nerror that employers can sometimes make is\nmischaracterizing a worker as an independent contractor,\nfor example, and upon determining later that the person is\nactually an employee and they should be withholding\nFICA --\nQUESTION: Well, let me ask the question in\nanother way. How would it -- how could it apply in this\nsituation? In other words, as I understand it -- I mean,\nthis is -- I didn't mean to side-track you from Justice\nO'Connor's question, but I'll raise the thing that bothers\nme. As I understand it, what the employer is obligated to\nreport is the sum total of all the reports that the\nemployees give to the employer of tip income.\nMS. O'CONNOR: That's right, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And I'll assume for the sake of the\nquestion that a given employer has done that.\nMS. O'CONNOR: Mm-hmm.\nQUESTION: I also assume that if you are\ncorrect, that employer has this possibility hanging over\nit that the IRS is going to make this kind of an\nassessment.\nMS. O'CONNOR: That --\nQUESTION: Is there any -- my question is, is\nthere any way that the employer can anticipate this kind\nof an assessment in order at least to avoid the interest\nrunning under this section?\nMS. O'CONNOR: Absolutely. There are many\ndifferent ways, Your Honor, and this case provides a very\ngood example. Employees are required to report on a\nmonthly basis to employers. You can see from the forms\n8027, which are at pages 38 and 39 of the joint appendix,\nthose are the forms that this restaurant filed for 1991\nand 1992.\nQUESTION: And they were all correct, I take it.\nMS. O'CONNOR: Right, those forms were\nabsolutely correct.\nYou will also note at the top of the page it\nsays that it is an information report, because this is\ninformation that Congress has required food and beverage\nestablishments to provide to the Internal Revenue Service\nexactly for a purpose such as this.\nNow, the annual -- the information report at\npages 38 and 39 is an annual report that the food and\nbeverage establishment provides to the Internal Revenue\nService, but employees provide reports to employers at\nleast monthly. You will see on the forms 8027 that 90\npercent of the sales of this restaurant were paid for by\ncredit card, so every single month this restaurant could\nhave compared the tips that employees were reporting with\nthe tips that they saw were being charged on credit cards,\nand as any business owner would do when faced with a\nliability that could occur down the road, you're going to\nset up a reserve for it.\nYou know you have got your annual insurance\npremium due next January. You start setting aside for it.\nQUESTION: He may set up -- the employer may set\nup a reserve, but as I understand it the employer is not\nobligated, in effect, to withhold upon himself, is not\nobligated to pay the tax on it until the assessment comes,\nbecause under the IRS' instructions the employer pays the\ntax on the amounts reported to the employer even if he\nknows they're wrong.\nMS. O'CONNOR: That's exactly right, and that's\nanother indication of the fact that Congress realized that\nthis was going to be a difficult provision for employers\nto enact.\nQUESTION: Well, what would he do --\nMS. O'CONNOR: 31 --\nQUESTION: What would he do to anticipate it?\nWould he say, I'm paying you another $10,000, I don't\nhappen to owe you that in tax now, I paid what the law\nrequires me to pay, and you haven't assessed anything\nelse, but here's another $10,000? I mean, is that what\nyou're anticipating?\nMS. O'CONNOR: Absolutely not, Your Honor. In\nfact, it is the rare taxpayer who seeks to pay his tax\nbefore it's called for.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: All right, then how does the taxpayer\ntake advantage of the provision that allows him to make a\ncorrection and avoid the interest in this case?\nMS. O'CONNOR: Well, one of the things that is\nsomewhat troublesome about some of the briefs in front of\nyou from the other side is that the other side is looking\nat this as though it was a penalty, and it's not a\npenalty, it's merely a tax. In fact, there specifically\nare no penalties. Let me point out --\nQUESTION: I will assume -- no, I will assume\nit's no penalty. I just want to know how it works in this\nsituation. He doesn't owe any tax --\nMS. O'CONNOR: Right.\nQUESTION: -- based on what he has to report to\nyou.\nMS. O'CONNOR: Right.\nQUESTION: You haven't assessed anything yet.\nHow can he possibly take advantage of the provision that\nallows him to make a correction, to pay in accordance with\nthat correction, and to avoid any interest that he would\notherwise be liable for? How can he take advantage of it?\nMS. O'CONNOR: Well, let me point out a couple\nof things from your question, Justice Souter. First, let\nme direct you to 3121(q). Provisions of the Internal\nRevenue Code provide a couple of things. They provide\nwhat is tax, how is the tax measured, when is it\nmeasured --\nQUESTION: Where is 2131(q)?\nMS. O'CONNOR: 3121(q) is in our joint appendix\nhere -- oh, no, no, it's in the petition. Thank you.\n3121(q) is at 58(a). Thank you very much.\nQUESTION: General O'Connor, it might help if\nyou answered specifically whether interest does run on the\nperiod between the employer paying what the employee's\nreports call for and the assessment at a higher amount.\nMS. O'CONNOR: Thank you, Justice Ginsburg. No,\nthere is no interest that runs, and that's why I wanted\nyou to look at 3121(q) in particular.\nQUESTION: Then how does this section have an\napplication here? You say, well, this mitigates it,\nand --\nMS. O'CONNOR: No, I'm sorry --\nQUESTION: -- it seems to me that about all the\nemployer can do is pay immediately at the moment of your\nassessment and therefore no interest will run.\nMS. O'CONNOR: No, I did not mean to suggest\nthat 6205 applied to this assessment, and in fact it\ndoesn't. 6205 applies when the employer himself discovers\nan error and corrects it at the next available\nopportunity.\nQUESTION: So it wouldn't apply in these\ncircumstances.\nMS. O'CONNOR: It doesn't need to, because under\n3121(q) -- it's a very interesting provision. 3121\nprovides definitions, that's all. It resides in the\nsubchapter of the Internal Revenue Code that provides for\nthese employment taxes, and (q) is the definitional\nprovision that says that tips are wages. It also tells\nyou when the tips are wages.\nFor the purposes of the employer FICA 3121(q)\ntells you that the wages are deemed to have been paid when\nthe employee reports them or if the employer -- employee\ndoesn't report them, they are wages deemed to be paid when\nthe IRS issues notice of demand, so until the IRS notifies\nthe restaurant that there is an additional FICA tax due,\nthere is no interest or penalty.\nQUESTION: Right, but at that point there is,\nand if you would come back to Justice O'Connor's question,\nwhich was, how could the employer ever know that there was\na mistake in the assessment, and you said, well, as soon\nas he knows it, he can come forward with the additional\namount and there won't be any penalty, but how does he\nknow it? That's the problem.\nMS. O'CONNOR: He knows it because the employees\nare reporting on a monthly basis, and in this case there\nwas clearly -- we have $120,000 of unreported credit card\ntips in each of the 2 years involved here, $120,000 in\nunreported credit card tips. Those reports were coming in\nevery month. The restaurant has clear notice --\nQUESTION: But your assessment is for more than\nthat. Your assessment assumed a certain unreported amount\nof cash tips as well. Now, how is the reporter -- how is\nthe employer going to know whether that's erroneous or\nnot?\nMS. O'CONNOR: The same method that he would use\nto make any other determination. For example, he knows by\nthe basis of the report that all credit card tips are not\nbeing reported.\nQUESTION: But the burden is on him. The burden\nis on him to show what the proper amount was. I mean, IRS\ncomes up with a guess based on, well, we assume that the\nsame amount weren't reported for cash tips as weren't\nreported for credit card tips, pay up.\nNow, how is he going to prove that there was a\ndifferent amount for --\nMS. O'CONNOR: You're exactly right, Justice\nScalia, the burden is on the taxpayer, and in this case\nthe taxpayer conceded the entire amount of the judgment.\nPage 35 of the joint appendix --\nQUESTION: But the burden is on the taxpayer to\ngive information as to which the taxpayer is not in the\nbest position to know, and --\nMS. O'CONNOR: That's true, Justice Kennedy.\nQUESTION: -- Justice O'Connor's original\nquestion was, how is the employer supposed to know, and\nyou say, well, if he doesn't know he can amend later.\nThe whole question is, and the gravamen of the\nargument put forth by the taxpayer here is that the\nassessment should be on the person, or on the entity that\nhas the information, and here your information is as good\nas the employer's, and you have the ability to do what the\nemployer can't, i.e., subpoena the individual records of\nthe employees.\nMS. O'CONNOR: Actually, not all of that is\ntrue, Justice Kennedy. The employer, if there were a\ndispute between the employer and the employee the employer\ncertainly could subpoena records of the employee in a\nmatter such as that, and respondent, as you say, does --\nQUESTION: How does he do that, sue the\nemployee?\nMS. O'CONNOR: Oh, if -- yes, if there were a\ndispute between the two over any matter the employer\ncertainly could.\nQUESTION: You're talking about a tax court or a\ndistrict court, or --\nMS. O'CONNOR: No, just as a general\nproposition. Just as a general proposition. In this\ncase --\nQUESTION: Well, as a general proposition I\ndon't think the employer can subpoena the employee. I\nmean, you have to have a legal proceeding, don't you?\nMS. O'CONNOR: Oh, exactly. That's what I mean,\nYour Honor. If there were some other legal proceeding --\nQUESTION: Well, but I mean, that's not going to\nwork. You're suggesting that he ought to fire the\nemployee and then be subjected to a wrongful discharge\nsuit and then subpoena the information so that he can give\nit to you. Why don't you just ask for it?\nMS. O'CONNOR: Well, actually, there is no\nevidence in the record on whether the individual employees\nwere audited or not. I saw that in the Ninth Circuit\nopinion, TRAC is asserted on that point.\nQUESTION: But the point is, you have the\ncapacity to do it and the employee doesn't.\nMS. O'CONNOR: That's true, Justice Kennedy.\nThe amount of assessment, though, I think it's very\nimportant to focus on the fact that in this case, as you\ncan see at page 35 of the joint appendix, the taxpayer\nhere conceded the reasonableness of the assessment,\nconceded it.\nQUESTION: Then that's just luck, because I\nthought Justice O'Connor's original question was, look, we\ncan all do this, it's so simple. You multiply 14.3\npercent times the gross receipts of every restaurant in\nthe country, all right. Now, I thought her question was,\nwhat is the restaurant owner supposed to do to show that\nthat's inaccurate, what can he do, and so far my own\nconclusion listening to you is, he can write the check.\nMS. O'CONNOR: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to --\nQUESTION: Now, is there anything else -- is\nthere anything else that this restaurant owner has it in\nhis power to do, other than write the check, and not some\ntheoretical thing. What I'm interested in is the\npracticality of it.\nMS. O'CONNOR: Absolutely, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: What is that?\nMS. O'CONNOR: -- and I don't mean to be\navoiding the question. Let me point to another line on\nthe form, 8027. You'll notice there is a line that refers\nto 8 percent, and then there's a blank and it says, or\nlower percentage. The reason for that is that if a\nrestaurant employees are reporting tips that are less than\n8 percent of gross sales, that could raise a red flag that\nmaybe the restaurant worker --\nQUESTION: It's not about 8 percent. Everybody\nknows all these minimums. This is about people who are\nearning more than the $20 in tips per year.\nMS. O'CONNOR: Right, per month.\nQUESTION: It is about people -- per month, or\nwhatever.\nMS. O'CONNOR: Right.\nQUESTION: It is about people who satisfy all\nthese other minimums. It is not about people -- they can\neven get a tax credit for this.\nMS. O'CONNOR: Right.\nQUESTION: I'll save that question.\nMS. O'CONNOR: Right.\nQUESTION: I'm interested in the answer to\nJustice O'Connor's question in what I'd call the mind run,\nmainstream, basic, typical situation, and that is, what is\nthat answer? So far I'm concluding he can do nothing.\nMS. O'CONNOR: No.\nQUESTION: Tell me the answer.\nMS. O'CONNOR: What the restaurant can do is\nshow evidence that would tend to determine, or help\ndetermine the amount of the tip, how many -- what kind of\na restaurant you have, how upscale it is, where it's\nlocated, the kind of meals you serve -- in fact, the IRS\nhas a procedure where restaurants can show all that\ninformation, a sample menu to get below the 8 percent.\nQUESTION: And then I'm not being clear.\nMS. O'CONNOR: Right.\nQUESTION: I think in typical cases like this\none, the restaurant will have paid more -- they will have\nassumed that it is more than 8 percent. They wrote a\ncheck for -- they assumed it was $200,000. That's going\nto be more than 8 percent of gross receipts.\nMS. O'CONNOR: Right.\nQUESTION: All right. Now, we're only talking\nabout an area that's well above that, and in respect to\nthe area well above that. Here it happened to be between\n$200,000 and about $350,000. In respect to that extra\n$150,000, you come in and say, we're sure that it was\nearned in tips, and now here's what you did. You\nmultiplied gross receipts by 14.3 percent, and you\nsubtracted the $200,000, okay. I'm saying anyone can do\nthat, and I thought Justice O'Connor's question was, you\nare a restaurant owner. You are faced with this. How do\nyou show that it isn't so?\nMS. O'CONNOR: The taxpayer here had the\nopportunity to do that. One of the things that you --\nQUESTION: Well, but will you acknowledge at\nleast that it's virtually impossible for the taxpayer to\nget that information? I mean, the taxpayer has the\nreports from the employees, and they're false.\nMS. O'CONNOR: What --\nQUESTION: How, as a practical matter, is the\ntaxpayer going to establish there's something different?\nI mean, we know in terms of generalities, we're told that\nthere are less tips paid, or bills paid in cash than by\ncredit card.\nMS. O'CONNOR: That has been an insertion that\nis unproven in the record.\nQUESTION: So you don't accept that as proof.\nMS. O'CONNOR: It may or may not be true.\nQUESTION: So what's the employer going to do,\nthen?\nMS. O'CONNOR: It may or may not be true.\nQUESTION: Let me ask you one other thing.\nThere's a so-called TRAC system, right, that Congress\npassed to address this very problem. What percentage of\nrestaurants have used TRAC? Does the record tell us that?\nMS. O'CONNOR: No, the record doesn't tell us.\nI understand from news reports that increasing numbers of\nemployers are entering into the tip rate alternative\ncommitment, and that is an alternative to justifying or\ntrying to establish -- in this case, though, let me point\nout that at any point during the IRS' examination the\ntaxpayer could have shown, could have produced information\nthat would have reduced the number that you see on Exhibit\nA. They never did that --\nQUESTION: But where would he get --\nMS. O'CONNOR: -- and they didn't do it in the\ndistrict court, either.\nQUESTION: Where would the taxpayer get the\ninformation? The only thing the taxpayer has got are the\nemployee's returns to the taxpayer and your assessment.\nWhere is the taxpayer going to get the information that\nwould allow it to do what you say in theory it could do?\nMS. O'CONNOR: Well, magically, since its\nconcession in the district court, at the appellate level\nand again in its briefs before this Court, the respondent\nhas come up with all sorts of ideas that might challenge\nthe amount of the assessment. Even if the --\nQUESTION: But there is a stipulation in this\ncase -- whatever may be in the next case, there is a\nstipulation in this case that they are not contesting the\nmethod. I have a question that I think Justice Breyer has\nsaid he was reserving, and that is, I don't understand\nwhat's in this for the revenue, because of the -- the\nprovision you haven't mentioned, 45B gives the restaurant\na credit against income tax, dollar for dollar, for the\nFICA tax, and let's assume we have employers, most of them\nare paying at least the minimum wage, what gain is there\nto the revenue whichever way this comes out?\nMS. O'CONNOR: We don't know whether the\ntaxpayer here was paying the minimum wage, because none of\nthat was in the record, because the assessment amount was\nconceded. The 45B credit, as you point out, is available\nonly for tips that are not used by the employer to satisfy\nhis minimum wage obligations, yet it's not a complete wash\nto the Treasury, however, because you still have the FICA\ntax being paid in and an income tax credit being given, so\nit's the trust fund accounting that would have a problem\nif you look at it as a complete offset. From the\nGovernment side it's not a complete offset at all.\nLet me emphasize that the concession in this\ncase --\nQUESTION: Excuse me, I didn't understand that.\nMS. O'CONNOR: Yes.\nQUESTION: Go over that again. What trust fund?\nMS. O'CONNOR: The social security trust fund,\nso to speak.\nQUESTION: So to speak, yes.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. O'CONNOR: Well, it is a matter of\nGovernment accounting. As a matter of Government\naccounting.\nQUESTION: It's a fantasy, isn't it? I mean, it\nall goes into one pot, doesn't it?\nMS. O'CONNOR: As a matter of Government\naccounting, there are funds that are --\nQUESTION: Purely as an accounting matter it\nmakes a difference, is that it?\nMS. O'CONNOR: As a Government funding matter.\nAs a Government funding matter.\nQUESTION: From the point of view of the\ntaxpayer it makes no difference, I take it?\nMS. O'CONNOR: From the point of view of the\ntaxpayer, it will make a difference if they use tips to\nsatisfy their minimum wage requirement, and on this record\nwe don't know.\nQUESTION: And if they don't, it won't make\nthat -- a difference.\nMS. O'CONNOR: It will -- well, no, that's not\nentirely true, but it's an optional credit. The employer\ncan prove his eligibility for the credit and claim it, or\nrather than claiming the deduction, they can claim a tax\ndeduction, which they might prefer to do.\nQUESTION: What happens if the employer doesn't\nhave enough, I guess, gross income to offset? Then he has\nto be stuck with the difference, right?\nMS. O'CONNOR: Well, it is a nonrefundable\ncredit, and that means you can either use the credit as an\noffset to your income tax, and what you're suggesting is\nthey don't have any income tax. That kind of employer\nmight prefer to take it as a deduction, which would create\na net operating loss which could carry forward and benefit\na future year.\nQUESTION: But the question -- and to overstate\nthe point -- I'm not buying into this argument at the\nmoment, but I do want to hear your response. From their\nbriefs I have the impression that it doesn't make a lot of\ndifference to the Government in this case. It would make\na lot of difference to the Government in the case of\nrestaurants that are losing money, in the case of\ntaxicabs, hairdressers, newspaper boys, and anyone else\nwho is in a business where people receive tips, and in\nrespect to those kinds of cases it gives the Government a\nweapon.\nIn this case, it's being used to force them into\na TRAC program that they don't want to enter. In some\nother case, to have a kind of threat that you could make\nto people because, of course, a lot of income is\nunderreported through tips, and you'd always be able to go\nout and assess more.\nNow, you're asking us to interpret some very\nbroad language as saying Congress has given you authority\nto do a particular thing. They're saying, don't give them\nthat authority. Congress would never have intended the\nIRS to do what I've just described.\nNow, I want to be sure you have a clear\nopportunity to answer that, because I want to hear what\nthe answer is.\nMS. O'CONNOR: Congress had the opportunity to\nsay that no, the IRS does not have the authority to do\nwhat has been referred to here as aggregate assessment,\nand I might just point out here that rather than aggregate\nassessments, which is what the respondent calls what has\nhappened here, respondent would prefer the individual\naudits and aggregating the estimates, because certainly\nthey would be estimates if they were done on the basis of\nthe individual waiter's reports also.\nBut in 1998, when Congress said that the IRS\ncannot use a threat of an assessment like this to force\nrestaurants into a TRAC, it clearly had the opportunity to\nsay, and besides, you don't have the authority to do these\nestimates anyway, these assessments anyway. The authority\nis very clear, and the only thing that the respondent has\never argued here is that the amount might be wrong, and\nthey can't tell you exactly what it is, but there is no\nrule that an assessment has to be entirely accurate or\nprecise. The assessment authority requires inquiries and\ndeterminations, and that's what's happened here.\nQUESTION: The assessment is presumptively\ncorrect, isn't it, under the statute?\nMS. O'CONNOR: Not under the statute, Justice\nRehnquist, Chief Justice Rehnquist, but rather under the\nlaws that this Court has observed. In United States v.\nJanis, this Court commented on the presumed correctness of\nassessments and their evidentiary value in tax litigation.\nQUESTION: Well, you take the position it is\npresumed to be correct, don't you?\nMS. O'CONNOR: It is -- United States v. Janis\nstands for the proposition that an assessment is valid\nunless it is without any foundation. Clearly, here, when\nthe assessment is based on the respondent's own report,\nand more than three-quarters of the assessment is on the\namounts that are clearly known to be true, clearly this\nfoundation, this assessment has a foundation. Thereafter,\nonce you've established that the assessment is not\ninvalid, that it has a foundation at all, then you start\ntalking about the amount.\nQUESTION: Well, I wonder --\nQUESTION: No, please, go ahead.\nQUESTION: Well, it has a foundation if three-\nquarters of it is true?\nMS. O'CONNOR: Pardon me?\nQUESTION: It has a foundation if three-quarters\nof it is true?\nMS. O'CONNOR: Oh, no.\nQUESTION: Is that what having a foundation\nmeans?\nMS. O'CONNOR: The test under Janis I think is\nmuch, much lower than that. It's -- an assessment is\nvalid if it has any foundation at all --\nQUESTION: So if --\nMS. O'CONNOR: -- and clearly, this one has a\nfoundation.\nQUESTION: -- 1 penny on the dollar is accurate,\nthat -- it has a foundation? Is that what it means? It\ncouldn't mean that.\nMS. O'CONNOR: Oh, I think that would be pushing\nit a little far, Your Honor, and that's not what United\nStates v. Janis requires.\nQUESTION: I would think it would mean that\nthere's some reason to believe the full amount is\naccurate, not that three-quarters of it is accurate.\nMS. O'CONNOR: That's not what this Court has\nheld, particularly United States v. Janis, where in fact\nthe assessment there was based on an estimate of wage-\nearning practice. By looking at 5 days' worth of wages\nthe commission assessed on 77 days worth of wages.\nQUESTION: Sure, but doesn't the Janis rule\nassume that the taxpayer is, in fact, in a position to\nprove the correct figure if the assessment is wrong?\nMS. O'CONNOR: Not necessarily, Your Honor, and\nit is incumbent upon any taxpayer upon whom a tax is\nimposed to maintain whatever books and records they can.\nQUESTION: Exactly, and that comes back to the\nquestion I've asked before. What can this taxpayer do?\nMS. O'CONNOR: Well, the taxpayer is in a\nbusiness that requires a lot of things. There health,\nsafety, and sanitation regulations. There are also tax-\nreporting regulations. You hire reliable people, you tell\nthem what the rules are, you remind them what the rules\nare, and you facilitate their compliance, and that's what\nthe restaurant here needed to have done, and may even have\ndone. Since they didn't challenge the assessment or\namount of the assessment, I think we can assume that --\nQUESTION: Well, short of the restaurant's\nhiring someone to bird dog every single waiter and\nwaitress to see what, in fact, the tip was, I don't see\nhow the employer here could collect the information.\nThe gambler, sure, he can write it down in his\nlittle book, but I don't see where the employer here is in\na position to get the figure to write down in a little\nbook, short of having a third person follow every --\nMS. O'CONNOR: The waiter can also write down\nhis tips in a little book, and there are --\nQUESTION: Sure, and the whole premise of the\nproblem is that the waiter is in fact not telling the\nwhole truth.\nMS. O'CONNOR: That is why restaurants --\nQUESTION: I mean, that's just really\nimpractical.\nMS. O'CONNOR: -- every employer should hire\nreliable people who they can trust to follow the rules.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. O'CONNOR: I'd like to reserve the balance\nof my time for rebuttal.\nQUESTION: Very well, Ms. O'Connor.\nMs. Power, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF TRACY J. POWER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. POWER: May it please the Court, Your Honor:\nCongress did not saddle the employer with a tax\nwhile depriving him of any way to defend against it.\nCongress did not require the employer to do what for 30\nyears it told him it was not required to do. This tax is\nnot authorized. Because it's not authorized, that affects\nthe burden of proof and the presumption of correctness.\nI'd like to suggest an analogy. If Congress had\npassed a tax on my chickens and the IRS came along and\nsaid, we're imposing a tax on you, on your neighbor's\ncows, and I said, but I don't owe a tax on my neighbor's\ncows, and they in turn said, yes, well, what we did was,\nwe figured your neighbor had X number of acres and\ntherefore the average number of cows per acre is Y, and\nyou owe the tax on the cows, and I said, well, I'm not\ngoing to fight that because I don't have any way to know\nhow many cows my neighbor had.\nQUESTION: But can I just ask one question that\nreally puzzles me in this case?\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: I can't follow the cows and all --\n(Laughter.)\nMS. POWER: I understand.\nQUESTION: But you did have records, written\nrecords that showed that the actual amount of tips paid by\ncredit card and so forth to the people in question here\nwas substantially larger than you reported. Why shouldn't\nthat put you on notice that you owed a little money to the\nGovernment?\nMS. POWER: We do not know to what extent, if\nany, those credit card tip amounts, or the amount on the\ncredit card tip slot on a credit card, was in fact\nreceived by an employee, a tip received by an employee\nthat is wages subject to the act. We do not know what --\nQUESTION: Well, but after those credit cards go\nto the restaurant, doesn't the restaurant turn the cash\nover to the employee?\nMS. POWER: The restaurants handle it in a\nvariety of different ways. It could be as simple as an\nemployee at the end of the night starting to turn over all\nthe money he's collected during the night, first to\nsatisfy all the credit card bills, then to satisfy all of\nthe dupes for the food that he had with the balance\nremaining in his pocket, which he then turns around and\nkicks out to a whole host of other employees. We do --\nQUESTION: But don't you know what the practice\nis in your own restaurants?\nMS. POWER: We would know what -- each\nindividual restaurant would know what is done in basic\npractice in their restaurant, but how much, if any, of\nthat credit card amount was retained by any individual, we\ndo not know.\nQUESTION: No, but what may -- I understand the\nwaiter may have split the tips with the busboy and so\nforth and so on, but the total amount of tip on the credit\ncard slip was paid to some employee, was it not?\nMS. POWER: Well, we don't even know whether\nit's a tip. There are many reasons why it might not be a\ntip.\nQUESTION: But this is a particular restaurant.\nI mean, it 's not as if we're talking about the world of\nrestaurants. Surely this particular restaurant knows.\nMS. POWER: Would know whether that credit card\namount was, in fact, a tip? No. You could have well had\na circumstance --\nQUESTION: You mean if it's shown on the credit\ncard --\nQUESTION: As a tip --\nQUESTION: -- as a tip -- I seem to recall\nseeing a space --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- on restaurant charges --\n(Laughter.)\nMS. POWER: That's correct.\nQUESTION: -- that says, tip, X amount. You\nfill it in.\nMS. POWER: And that's correct, and if I went in\nand I didn't have any cash in my pocket and I said to the\nwaiter, you know, I'm going to leave some extra tip on\nhere, I need to pay for the valet when I leave, I'm going\nto put $5 extra on here, can you give me the cash -- yes,\nit's possible that there's tips on there.\nQUESTION: The question isn't possible. The\nquestion is what's normal, and normal tip is tip, and I\ndon't understand the chickens and the cows exactly --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: In my copy of the code here it\nsays -- it doesn't say -- it says the employer, there is\nimposed on the employer an excise tax equal to 6.2 percent\nof wages, and it says, including tips, so I don't see\nhow -- what your argument is that the tax isn't\nauthorized. Of course it's authorized.\nMS. POWER: But it's wages of an individual\nemployee.\nQUESTION: Yes, that's right, and the employer\nhas to --\nMS. POWER: It's wages -- and they have, what\ntheir assessment stands for is a tax on my gross tip\npayroll. There has been no -- that is not a tax --\nQUESTION: No, no, but I -- I understand that\nbasic point. I'm trying to get you to focus on what I\nthink would be, despite the rights and wrongs of it, their\nvery strong legal position, which is very simple.\nNumber 1, that there is assessed here a tax on the\nemployer equal to 6.2 percent of the total, including tip\nwages of the employee, all right, and they say, we have\nthe power under the statute to assess the amount, and\nmoreover, we think your client didn't pay, and therefore\nwe took what we think was a very reasonable way of\nfiguring that out.\nWe looked at the credit cards and we saw it\nsaid, tips, and we saw 14.2 percent is the typical amount,\nand we assume that's it for credit and for cash, and if\nyou don't like that, you prove to the contrary. We don't\nthink you can prove it, not because it just isn't\npossible, that probably, in all likelihood, it isn't true,\nokay. Now, that's their point.\nNow, you reply to that. I would like to hear\nyour argument.\nMS. POWER: My reply to that is, we started out\nby saying it's wages, including the tips of the employee,\nand they did not give us a bill for wages which are the\ntips of the employee. They gave us a bill for the total\ngross tips of all employees collectively, and this Court\nhas already held that FICA taxes are divisible taxes under\nFlora v. United States, that it is a tax imposed upon the\nindividual wage earnings. This Court has already\ninterpreted 3111 to be a tax on individual wage earnings,\nand they did not give us a bill for that tax.\nQUESTION: Well, but that's a different argument\nfrom the one that we've been wrestling with, which is\nwhether or not you have within your authority and control\nan ability to calculate the basis for challenging the\nassessment.\nMS. POWER: We do not.\nQUESTION: And you began by saying, well, they\ndiffer and, frankly, I don't give much force to that\nargument. The employer knows how the employer distributes\ncredit card receipts. That's the employer's job, so I'm\nnot particularly persuaded by that argument. If you want\nto go ahead and say, well, the cash portion of the tips\ndon't relate to the -- in the same ratio that the credit\ncard tips, I would understand that.\nMS. POWER: The employer does not know how the\ntips, the credit card tips are distributed. It's not as\nif --\nQUESTION: Doesn't the employer get the credit\ncard receipt?\nMS. POWER: At the end of the --\nQUESTION: And doesn't the -- the employer can\nst up any system the employer wants.\nMS. POWER: At the end of the evening the\nemployer would cash out all the employees and would turn\nover credit card tips to employees who might have received\ncredit card receipts, and those employees would then\ndecide among themselves to whom in what amount they are\ngoing to share those tips that they have received, along\nwith any cash tips that they may have --\nQUESTION: But the employer at least has an\naggregate at that point, some that appears from the credit\ncards to have been paid out in tips, no matter how it's\nshared.\nQUESTION: In addition, he has the ability -- in\naddition, he has the ability to tell his employees that he\nwants to know the ratio in which they're shared. He can\nmake that a condition of employment, so I'm not persuaded\nby that argument.\nMS. POWER: I don't really think he can make\nthat a condition of employment. I think that employers\nhave to be very careful what happens in the context of\nwage and hour laws and tip-pooling regulations and so on\nand so forth.\nQUESTION: Well, that seems to me all the more\nreason why the employer should have a strong interest in\nknowing how the division is being made.\nMS. POWER: Well, I think that there are many\nemployees who do not want the employer to have anything to\ndo -- to know -- to do with the tip-sharing arrangements.\nIt is -- tips are the property of the employee. Not only\nthat, you have --\nQUESTION: But the employer, Ms. Power, has an\nobligation to pay FICA tax, and has an obligation to pay\nit on the total earnings, and it isn't -- your cow analogy\ndidn't just pass me by, because the tax on the employer is\nindependent of the tax on the employee. Suppose these\nemployees never paid a cent in FICA tax, and they went off\nto beach-comb some place, the FICA tax would be owed by\nthe employer just the same.\nMS. POWER: That's correct.\nQUESTION: So it's the employer's cow. The FICA\ntax belongs to the employer.\nMS. POWER: The -- there is no question that the\nemployer owes a FICA tax. He owes the FICA tax regardless\nof whether the employee is ever audited. He owes the FICA\ntaxes regardless of whether the employee is ever assessed\nor the employee ever pays his taxes. It can be assessed\nagainst the employer at a completely different time from\nwhen it can be assessed against the employee.\nThe employer does not dispute that he owes a FICA\ntax. What the employer disputes is, I can't know what I\nowe that FICA tax on until you make some determination of\nwhat the individual earnings are, because until that time,\nI am denied all defenses employees have that they can\nraise, and there's a whole list of long --\nQUESTION: But you know what -- in fact, you\nstipulated that you don't dispute the facts, the\nestimates, or determinations used by the IRS as a basis\nfor its calculation of an amount of aggregated unreported\ntip income by all directly and indirectly tipped\nemployees, which is your -- is on page 35 of the joint\nappendix. You agreed that you are in this case, for\npurposes of this case not disputing any of that.\nMS. POWER: I do not -- we do not dispute the\namount of the IRS' aggregate assessments because -- of all\nemployees collectively, because we simply do not have the\ninformation to dispute that. Congress has prohibited us\nfrom having that information. We do not have that\ninformation. We have never had that information.\nCongress for 30 years has told us we do not have to\nconcern ourselves with that information, and we do not\nhave the wherewithal to dispute it.\nSo in this case, do I dispute that? No, because\nit is not worth disputing that or attempting to even\nwhittle down that assessment in this case.\nQUESTION: But your position is, we know that\nthere is a disparity between what is reported and what is\nactually paid in tips. We know that both the employee and\nthe employer independently owe a tax on that total amount,\nand we know about the shortfall, but there is nothing the\nGovernment can do. It's just stuck by what the servers\nput down on the monthly form that they file.\nMS. POWER: There's plenty that the Government\ncan do. The Government has the wherewithal to do\neverything, and that's exactly what Congress says should\nbe done.\nQUESTION: Well, the only thing that you've\nproposed, and tell me if I'm wrong about this, is that the\nGovernment go one by one after the employees, and am I\ncorrect in saying that the same method would be used by\nthe Government if it went against an individual server,\nthat it -- you are resisting the Government using against\nthe restaurant. That is, let's take a waiter in this\nestablishment. The Government says, you've underreported\nyour tip income, and the way we figured out that you've\nunderreported it is the same formula. Isn't that what\ngoes on when --\nMS. POWER: No, it's entirely different,\nbecause -- and as the McQuatters case that's cited in the\nbriefs by both parties illustrates, in that circumstance,\nthe individual waiter has an opportunity to bring any\ndefenses that he has to the Government's assessment\nforward, and we are denied every possible defense by that\nscenario.\nQUESTION: Well, take -- make that specific,\nplease. Here is a waiter, and the Government says, you\nhave unreported income, and this is how we've estimated\nit. We've estimated it based on our formula, and then\nspecifically what does that employee do when the\nGovernment says, we've made an estimate based on this 14\npercent, or whatever it is?\nMS. POWER: The employee disputes the estimate.\nWhether he does it at an administrative level or whether\nhe goes to the tax court and disputes it, he goes in and\nhe disputes it, and he raises the issues, and I think a\nnumber of them were identified in the waitresses' amicus\nbrief. For instance, they say, well, I didn't work as\nlong. I don't have the same experience as the other guy\nhad. They was stiffing, a tremendous amount of stiffing.\nWe had a European clientele, the tips weren't as great as\nyou think.\nQUESTION: What is stiffing?\nMS. POWER: No tip whatsoever.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. POWER: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: I just don't understand how any of\nthat can get you below the amount that shows up on the\ncredit cards, because for example, say one employee got\n$2,000 in tips, and he could have a defense that I passed\nout $600 to the busboys, and maybe his liability is less,\nbut it still seems to me the employer would have to at\nleast pay the aggregate amount on the credit card.\nMS. POWER: No, because --\nQUESTION: I just don't understand how you get\naround that.\nMS. POWER: -- there's a situation where you\ncould have many employees. There's a very high turnover\nrate, especially with those who are in the categories that\nreceive the least amount of tips. Somebody who comes in,\nand he's a busboy and he's there for the afternoon, and he\nsays, boy, forget this job, I'm leaving, and he takes the\ntips that he gets that day, and that happens at a much\nhigher percentage --\nQUESTION: Well, that would explain why\nassessments might be wrong as to individual employees, but\nit still doesn't reduce the gross amount in the tip column\non the credit card.\nMS. POWER: It does reduce the gross amounts --\nQUESTION: How?\nMS. POWER: -- that the employer would have to\nowe, because if any of that credit card tips that you're\nassuming isn't in fact a tip was received by somebody who\nmade less than $20 a month, the employer doesn't owe any\ntax on that.\nQUESTION: Okay. That's a possibility, but\nwouldn't it suffice on any rule of probability if the\nGovernment did just what Justice Stevens described? It's\nquite true, yes, there might have been an extraordinary\nturnover, if there is, the employer can come in and say\nso. But if the Government made its claim simply based on\nwhat the credit card reports showed, wouldn't the\nGovernment have made an assessment which enjoyed at least\na probability of accuracy?\nMS. POWER: No, because you go back to 3111 and\nCongress did not impose a tax on the aggregate earnings of\nall employees collectively.\nQUESTION: So your argument there is that even\nif you had the perfect evidence, even if there was a memo\nbeyond dispute, written by the accountant and signed by\nall the employers that said, after the most thorough\ninvestigation of this restaurant I'm telling you\nprivately, and you agree, that the total tips earned that\nare eligible for social security are $350,000, so it's\nsigned by 15 bishops, you know, absolute, dead right,\nwe're saying that even if that's so, he still doesn't owe\nit because in the memo it doesn't say which employees.\nMS. POWER: I think that it needs to say which\nemployees learned which amount, and that's what the tax\nwas imposed upon, and if on the other hand you had all of\nthe employees say yes, I earned this, yes, I earned this,\nyes, I earned this, then you would have that individual\ndetermination.\nQUESTION: But there's never been anything held,\nis there, that where an employer clearly owes a tax to the\nGovernment, based because of the earnings of the employee,\nand there can be different contexts where that comes up,\nthe evidence that he owes that has to name or pick out\nwhich employee? I assume if there were a case that ever\nsaid that you would have cited it, and I doubt that there\nis.\nMS. POWER: I don't think that there is.\nQUESTION: All right. If there isn't, then\nthat's my problem. If you're talking about the quality of\nthe evidence, you run into the problem that Justices\nStevens and Souter mentioned. If you're talking about the\nneed for the precision identification of a single\nemployee, I don't see in the law any requirement for such\na principle.\nMS. POWER: I think that it's in 3111. I think\nthat this Court has already held that the tax is imposed\nupon --\nQUESTION: But whereabouts in 3111? If it's\njust two sentences, tell us what sentence or what clause\nyou --\nMS. POWER: Well, 3111, it says wages or -- 3111\nsays wages -- I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nEqual to the following percentage of wages as\ndefined in section 3121(a), the tax imposed on something\ncalled wages, that is defined in 3121(a). You cannot read\n3121(a) as anything but --\nQUESTION: Where do we find 3121(a) in your\nbrief?\nMS. POWER: It's on the next page, page 56 of\nthe Government's appendix to the petition, and it says,\nthe term wages means all remuneration for employment, and\nit goes on -- they only have one of the individual terms\nlisted. There are 21 specific --\nQUESTION: But you're telling us this shows your\npoint, and you -- point to the language that you think it\ndoes.\nMS. POWER: 3111 imposes a tax on wages --\nQUESTION: On wages. It doesn't say\nindividual -- wages paid to each individual. It says\nwages.\nMS. POWER: It says wages as defined in 3121(a).\nQUESTION: Then we turn to 3121, and where is it\nin there that it makes your point?\nMS. POWER: When you go through each one of the\n21 --\nQUESTION: Well, that's what we're here for, to\ngo through something.\nMS. POWER: Okay, well, the 21 exceptions to\n2131(a) lists individual things like whether an employee\nparticipates in a health insurance plan, whether an\nemployee has a 401(k) plan, the extent to which an\nemployee's wages go above or below the social security\nwage base.\nQUESTION: But that goes to the accuracy of the\nfigure, perhaps, which you said really is not your point.\nThat -- none of those exceptions say anywhere,\ncollectively or in specific terms, that under 3111 you\ncan't add them all up.\nMS. POWER: Well, this Court has already held\nthat --\nQUESTION: And that's what we're saying.\nMS. POWER: -- that's not the way the tax works.\nThis Court has already held in Flora v. United States and\nas quoted in Steele v. United States that it isn't a tax\non the aggregate earnings. It is -- the assessment is an\naccumulation of separate, divisible taxes on each\ntransaction. What is subject to the tax is each\nindividual payment --\nQUESTION: There are two Flora cases, neither of\nwhich are cited in your brief. Which Flora -- there was a\nrehearing grant. Which one are you --\nMS. POWER: Flora v. United States, and I\nbelieve it's footnote 37 in Flora v. United States.\nQUESTION: Yes, but there are two Flora v.\nUnited States that a rehearing was granted, one's 357,\none's 362, and your brief doesn't seem to mention either\nof them.\nMS. POWER: Well, we referenced them in our\ncomplaint, Your Honor. I think it's paragraph 14 of our\ncomplaint.\nQUESTION: Does it give a citation there?\nMS. POWER: Yes, Your Honor. 362 U.S. 145.\nQUESTION: But that was just about whether or\nnot the tax court had jurisdiction if the assessment\nwasn't completely paid beforehand, wasn't it?\nMS. POWER: Yes, but I believe that footnote 37\nin that brief, in that opinion said that the Court agreed\nthat the excise tax, like a FICA tax, is a divisible tax.\nThat's the whole basis upon which we're here. We only\npaid $18 of the total tax, and we paid it on the basis of\nour estimate, although we cannot prove it one way or the\nother, of one employee who would have made less than $20 a\nmonth over a period of time. If this wasn't a divisible\ntax, or one that was imposed upon each transaction of\nwages, then we would have had to pay the entire $23,000.\nThis hold that it is a tax on an accumulation of all wages\nof all employees is to change that 40-year history of --\nQUESTION: Now, Congress passed something called\nthe TRAC law in 1998 to deal with this very problem of\ntips and the FICA tax, did it not?\nMS. POWER: Not technically, Your Honor. TRAC\nis not something that Congress passed. TRAC is something\nthat is an agreement between the industry and the IRS. It\nwas -- I was the first person who approached the IRS on\ncoming up with some type of an agreement with the IRS to\nsolve this problem, and the TRAC agreement was a contract\nthat was written between --\nQUESTION: I thought there was a section in 1998\npassed by Congress, section 3414 of the Internal Revenue\nService Restructuring and Reform Act providing that IRS\nwould not threaten a taxpayer audit to coerce the taxpayer\ninto entering a tip-reporting alternative commitment\nagreement, so at least Congress acknowledged --\nMS. POWER: Congress acknowledged --\nQUESTION: -- the agreement, did it not?\nMS. POWER: It acknowledged that the agreement\nexisted, but Congress --\nQUESTION: Do you think Congress was assuming\nthere were assessments going on of employers for this\nliability?\nMS. POWER: Not at that time, because there are\ntwo documents at the very end of the joint appendix that\nare Government documents, and they indicate that they were\nnot doing the employer-only assessments at that time. In\nfact, they indicate that they were not doing the employer-\nonly assessments at that time. In fact, they indicate\nthat they -- they assured Congress that they were not\ndoing assessments at that time.\nQUESTION: When did the IRS start doing these\naggregate assessments? Do you know when they started?\nMS. POWER: I would say that they started doing\nthem about 1992, 1993, and you had asked the question\nearlier, how many TRAC agreements are there that have been\nsigned. There are about 25-to-30,000 TRAC agreements that\nhave been signed. There are about 200,000 --\nQUESTION: Well, this congressional provision\nthat I asked you about was made in 1998, so that was well\nafter the beginning of aggregate assessments.\nMS. POWER: And long after the IRS had announced\nthat they were not doing aggregate assessments.\nQUESTION: The gravamen of your brief is that as\na principle an assessment shouldn't be imposed on the\ntaxpayer unless the taxpayer has the information to\ncontradict the assessment, which certainly makes a lot of\ncommon sense. Is there a provision in the code, or\nsomething that we've said in the cases that sustains that\noverarching principle?\nMS. POWER: Well, I think that --\nQUESTION: Or is it just kind of a due process\nfairness thing?\nMS. POWER: Well --\nQUESTION: Is there a specific principle you can\npoint to to show the correctness of that assumption?\nMS. POWER: Well, I think that there's 30 years\nof congressional history that clearly shows that Congress\ndoes not intend for the employer to be put in this\nposition, that Congress did not intend for the employer to\nbe required to police and monitor the reporting of\nemployees, and ostensibly that's what the IRS'\ninterpretation does.\nQUESTION: But you have no specific authority or\nprecedent for the proposition that an assessment should\nnot be imposed on a taxpayer unless the taxpayer is in a\ngood or perhaps best position to contradict the\nassessment?\nMS. POWER: I think that we have plenty of\nauthority for the proposition that the assessment in this\ncase is unauthorized because it's on the collective wage-\nearning on 31 --\nQUESTION: But that wasn't what I asked you.\nasked you about the general proposition.\nMS. POWER: That a tax cannot be imposed upon --\nQUESTION: An assessment cannot be imposed on\nthe taxpayer unless the taxpayer has the capacity or the\nability to contradict it. I mean, that's -- it seems to\nme that's the principle argument in your brief. It makes\na lot of sense, but I want to know if I'm -- if the\nCourt's writing an opinion for that, what do they cite for\nthat proposition?\nMS. POWER: The best I can tell you --\nQUESTION: Other than the fact that this is\nsomething everybody should know, but that doesn't usually\nwork.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. POWER: I think that the burden of\npresumption and the burden of proof that they have put\nforth is premised upon the understanding that the person\nwith that burden has the records and is in the best\nposition to respond, and that does not characterize this\nsituation, so those policy considerations behind that are\nnot existing here.\nQUESTION: Are there other situations in the tax\nlaw where the Government knows that income has been\nunderreported? Aren't estimates made in many different\ncontexts where the taxpayer doesn't keep reliable records,\nand so the Government has to find some way of measuring\nwhat the tax should be, so it does an estimate? Isn't\nthat common?\nMS. POWER: In each one of those cases it's --\nthe person responsible for keeping the records is the one\ntaxed. We have no problem with the IRS attempting to\ndetermine the earnings of the individual employees and\ncoming back and --\nQUESTION: Well, you did before, because when I\nasked you, are they making an estimate in that case, and\nyou started to say no, because the taxpayer, the\nindividual servers have all these --\nMS. POWER: Excuses --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. POWER: -- or defenses?\nQUESTION: Yes. But I thought that they\ncould -- I thought that was a given, that if they go after\na single waiter, that they can have an estimate.\nMS. POWER: They can.\nQUESTION: They do make an estimate.\nMS. POWER: They can.\nQUESTION: And the very estimate that you are\nresisting when it applies to the employer.\nMS. POWER: Because we are -- we don't have the\nsame defenses that the waiter and the waitress does. The\nwaiter and the waitress can say, you know, all kinds of\nthings in response, that no, I didn't earn that, here are\nmy records, here are my individual records of exactly what\nI earned.\nThe IRS sends them a bill based on the same\ntypes of estimates, takes it one step further and says,\nokay, well, you worked X number of hours out of the total\nnumber of hours in this restaurant, so of this total share\nwe think your share is this amount. The waiter or\nwaitress can come in and say no, here's my individual\nrecord, and this is exactly what I earned, or no, you're\nwrong in assuming this, or you're wrong in assuming that,\nand then a determination can be made of what that\nindividual waiter or waitress made, and then turn around\nand give it to us.\nThat's exactly what one of the documents in our\njoint appendix on page 92, that's exactly what the IRS did\ndo before they came up with this aggregate assessment\nmethod, because that is precisely what Congress envisioned\nthat the IRS would be doing with the 8027 Form data, is\ntaking that information, using that information to make\nexaminations of individual employees, and then turning\naround --\nQUESTION: Now, practically can the IRS -- are\nyou suggesting that they go after the employees, and then\nwhen they know the amount based on the extra tax the\nemployee will have to pay, then say, okay, employer, you\npay the same amount, but practically can the IRS -- does\nit have the facilities to go audit every waiter and busboy\nand --\nMS. POWER: There's no requirement that they\naudit every waiter or busboy. In the first place, that\nletter that I just pointed out didn't require any audit at\nall, and not only that, in the context of what's happening\nhere, they still have an audit problem. They've only\ncollected, or are attempting to collect 25 cents out of\nevery single dollar. They're leaving three -- 75 cents on\nthe table here. They come in here and they say that\nthey've got this huge, astronomical problem, and we can't\ndo anything about it.\nQUESTION: Well, the reason is, maybe it isn't\ncost-effective to go after the individual employees.\nMS. POWER: Well, I don't think it's very cost-\neffective to do this one, when the employer is --\nQUESTION: The employer tax is owed\nindependently, which is what I started to ask you about\nwhen you gave your cow example. The taxes on an employer,\nthat's a discrete tax. There's a tax on the employee.\nThat's a discrete tax. Why, because the Government is\ngoing to have a hard time collecting the tax on the\nemployee, is it disabled from collecting the tax on the\nemployer?\nMS. POWER: Because that's what Congress said --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Power.\nMS. POWER: -- that the IRS should do.\nQUESTION: Ms. O'Connor, you have 3 minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EILEEN J. O'CONNOR\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nQUESTION: Ms. O'Connor, at the very outset you\nsaid that 311 imposed a tax on wages paid or deemed to\nhave been paid. Is the word deemed in the statute?\nMS. O'CONNOR: Is the word deemed in the\nstatute?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. O'CONNOR: I believe so. I believe it's in\n3121(q), Your Honor, which I keep losing.\nQUESTION: Well, I'll find it.\nMS. O'CONNOR: Yes, it's on page 58a, is where\n3121(q) appears, and remember that is a section that\nprovides definitions. 3121 tells you that wages include\ntips which are paid or deemed to have been paid, and\n3121(q) also tells you the time.\nAs we have said, this is a tax on an aggregate\namount. Form 941 in your joint appendix show how the\nemployer reports the tax, and shows that it is a tax on\nthe wages paid.\nQUESTION: Well, except I think the deeming\nrefers to the time of payment, not to the fact of payment,\nbut I'll look at that.\nMS. O'CONNOR: I think you're right about that,\nYour Honor. Nonetheless, they are deemed to be paid at\nthe time, right. 3121(q) tells you that tips are\nincluded, and then the deemed part is -- the tips are\nwages, and the deemed part is when they are deemed to have\nbeen paid. They're deemed to have been paid by the\nemployer, and then it goes on and tells you when. It does\nsay tips are deemed to have been paid by the employer.\nThat's the very first sentence. It's at page 85a.\nQUESTION: How long has IRS been making these\nassessments, please, Ms. O'Connor?\nMS. O'CONNOR: I believe, Justice O'Connor, that\nit did start around 1992 and 1993, and the information\nthat the IRS is gathering on the forms 8027 demonstrated\nthe extent of the problem that Congress suspected did\nexist about substantial underreporting of tip income.\nQUESTION: In view of all the questions about\nthe proper computation, why has the Government resisted\nnotice and comment rulemaking to come up with a fair\nformula, because the contention is that the Government's\nformula exaggerates the income, exaggerates the tip\nincome.\nMS. O'CONNOR: That is certainly the contention,\nand there have been, however, no facts to show whether\nthat's true or not, because in each of the cases, not only\nthe Ninth Circuit below, but in each of the three cases\nthat we cite in our briefs decided by the Seventh,\nEleventh, and the Federal Circuits, no evidence was ever\nsubmitted to show that the tips were overstated in any\nway.\nQUESTION: But why not -- why not employ that\nfair procedure of going through the notice and comment,\nand then -- I think that's what Judge Kozinski said to do.\nMS. O'CONNOR: Yes, he did. Judge Kozinski's\nopinion entirely excludes section --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: I think you've\nanswered the question. Judge Kozinski did say that, so\nthe case is submitted.\n(Whereupon, at 11:03 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n16:2,5,6 17:8,10 24:16 29:24 25:15 26:13 28:13,19 29:14,18
