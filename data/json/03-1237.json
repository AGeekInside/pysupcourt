JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ, ESQ.\nOn behalf of the Petitioner 49\nP R O C E E D I In G S\n[10:03 a.m.]\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in the Merck KGaA v. Integra Lifesciences.\nMr. Rosenkranz.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Your -- Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nYour Honors, there is no dispute among the\nparties, nor among the 19 amicus briefs presented before\nthe Court today. As to the answer to the threshold legal\nquestion, everyone agrees that the FDA exemption does,\nindeed, apply, with full force, to the sorts of\nexperiments that are conducted and that would be relevant\nto the FDA in consideration of an Investigational New Drug\napplication, a so-called IND. So the battleground now\nshifts to Integra's alternative arguments in support of\nthe judgment --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, would you just clarify\nsomething for me as we start to consider the case? I\nguess this thing went to the jury under an instruction\nthat tried to come to grips with the definition under the\nstatute in some way. Was that instruction one to which\nMerck preserved an objection?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. We did not\nobject to the core of the jury's instructions stating the\nlegal standard. And we --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do you think it was properly\nstated in that instruction?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: The core of the instruction,\nyes, Your Honor, was --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: That's as good as we could\ndo.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I believe -- the\nanswer is, the core was as good as this Court can do, and\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: All right. And, under that,\nyou think that Merck was entitled to a directed verdict --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- from the evidence?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: It was entitled to a verdict as\na matter of law, but let me just --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Okay, but the Court of\nAppeals for the Federal Circuit did not address the case\nin -- by looking at the evidence and whether a directed\nverdict should have been given --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, the --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- or not?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- the Federal Circuit did\nunderstand that this was a JMOL case --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: I know, but it seemed to decide\nthe case based on its view of the statute as just applying\nto generic drugs or something like that.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: That is absolutely correct,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: So it didn't, in fact, come\nto grips with the evidence.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: It absolutely did not come to\ngrips with the evidence, nor did it grapple with the\nalternative arguments that Integra was presenting --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, so --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- so they --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- maybe all we have to do is\ndeal with whether that court should have addressed the\nevidence.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: That would be one answer, Your\nHonor, reverse and not addressing the alternative legal\ngrounds, but I would urge this Court to address the\nalternative grounds, because they raise --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: All of them? You mean, like\nthe research tools problem?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor, because the\nresearch tools problem was never presented --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: No.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- as an issue before the jury\nor before the District Court. And --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Or the Tripps Treaty?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: No.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: In fact, that's not even raised\nby Respondents. It's raised by amici's --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: All right. And how about the\ncommon-law research example --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: I would -- I would urge the\nCourt not broach the subject of any of the questions that\nare not properly presented --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Okay, so --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- to this Court.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- all we're doing is looking\nat the statute.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: We're --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Thank you.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor, we're looking\nat the statute --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Okay.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- but it is an -- it is\nimportant, in answer to the very first question, to\nembellish a bit, because the lower courts need this\nCourt's guidance, because every one of the theories on\nwhich Integra defends the judgment below raise exactly\nthe same problems that the Federal Circuit's opinion\nraises. They defy the plain language of the statute\nCongress passed. They are equally at odds with the\npurpose that Congress had in mind when it passed the FDA\nexemption.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: What are the\nalternative grounds that you're discussing now passed on\nby the Federal Circuit?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, they were not\npassed on by the Federal Circuit, except perhaps to the\nextent that the Federal Circuit may have concluded that\nall -- or that, excuse me -- that safety is the only issue\nbefore the FDA when it is considering an Investigational\nNew Drug application, or that a drug innovator may not\nharbor additional purposes in an experiment beyond the FDA\nexemption, or that the -- excuse me -- beyond FDA\nregulatory purposes -- or, third, that the exemption does\nnot cover efforts to optimize the drug candidate after\nit's identified and that drug candidate is, in fact, the\nlead candidate.\nThose are the three legal theories, Your Honors,\non which Integra is resting its defense of the judgment\nbelow. And every single one of them is either incorrect\nas a matter of law or immaterial as a matter of law. If\nthis Court were to ask Integra to come up with a single\ngenuine issue of fact that does not relate to one or\nanother of those three propositions, it will not be able\nto do so, save a footnote to be addressed later about the\ncredibility of witnesses on a topic on which Integra never\nargued the witnesses were not credible.\nJust beginning with the safety question, and\nI'll defer to the Government on that, because the\nGovernment can speak better than anyone else as to what it\nis that is relevant to the FDA in consideration of an IND,\nsuffice it to say that the regulations say, as a matter of\nlaw, that safety is not the only consideration before the\nFDA as it considers an IND. The FDA cares very much about\nwhether a drug will work: efficacy. The FDA cares very\nmuch about how it works: mechanism of action. It cares\nabout what the body does to that drug: pharmacokinetics.\nAnd it cares very much about what that drug does to the\nbody: pharmacology. And Integra's position before the\njury, and before this Court, depends upon the proposition\nthat it can bring in a witness to argue that the law is\nother than what the law clearly is. And the same thing\ngoes for the so-called GLP studies that the FDA considers\nin connection with safety data, but need not limit itself\nto GLP studies when it's considering those other IND-\nrelevant topics.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Rosenkranz, just one\npiece of information. Because the IND is so important at\nthis point, is it in the record -- do we have a copy of\nthe IND?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: The IND, Your Honor, is not in\nthe record, because it was excluded from evidence, which\nmay be why the jury reached the wrong conclusion. But, I\nhasten to add, that will not be uncommon in these sorts of\ncases, because there are many circumstances in which a\npreclinical study begins and fails, and the IND will never\nmaterialize. There are circumstances in which a\npreliminary injunction is brought and won, and the\nresearch stops cold, so an IND never materializes.\nAnd, again, it's important to understand, as one\nassesses the FDA exemption, that the inquiry is always ex\nante, it is always, \"What is a reasonable drug innovator?\nWhat does that drug innovator or scientist know at the\npoint in time at which it is about to perform the next set\nof experiments?\" So you always reflect back to a point in\ntime before the IND materializes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Rosenkranz, the items you\nlisted earlier seemed to me to more narrow than what I\ntook to be the point of your opening brief, which was that\nthe decision below was wrong because the Federal Circuit\nsimply excluded all consideration of materials prepared\nfor purposes of the IND, as opposed to materials prepared\nfor the -- for the drug application, later on. Are you\nabandoning that more expansive position?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Because I don't read the\nopinion that way. I don't think that opinion has to be\nread to say that they're not going to allow in anything\nthat goes to the IND.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, there is certainly\na way to read the Federal Circuit's opinion -- and this is\nalso in response to Justice O'Connor's earlier question --\nin which it did grapple with the very questions we're\ntalking about now, and did answer the questions about\nwhether it's just safety -- and I believe the Federal\nCircuit believed that only safety data were relevant; that\nis certainly what it indicated in oral argument -- and\nalso that dual purposes are not permissible.\nSo let me now turn to the dual-purpose question,\nbecause it's another major theme of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Have you answered my question?\nYou're abandoning the assertion that the Federal Circuit\ndid not consider anything that didn't go to the IND --\nthat didn't go to the --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: The --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- drug application.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. I believe that\nthere are two ways to read the Federal Circuit's opinion.\nTo the extent that the Federal Circuit said nothing before\nthe clinical stage is relevant to the FDA exemption -- if\nthat is what the Federal Circuit held, we are -- we are\nnot abandoning the position that that is wrong. I\nunderstand that there is another way to read the Federal\nCircuit's opinion that grapples with the subsidiary\nquestions that we're discussing here, which are all fairly\npresented in our question presented. And that's what I'm\naddressing myself to now.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: For your first answer, are you\nrelying what the Federal Circuit said in its opinion --\nand it's in 10a of our cert petition appendix -- that is,\nthe Federal Circuit's statement of the question presented,\nwhether the preclinical research conducted under Scripps-\nMerck agreement is exempt from liability for infringement\nof Integra's patents.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. And then, two\npages later, on 12a, the Federal Circuit states its\nconclusion, and I quote, \"Thus, the Scripps work sponsored\nby Merck was not solely for use as reasonably related to\nclinical testing for the FDA.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but it -- it's not at all\nclear in the opinion that the Court was using preclinical\nand clinical in the very technical sense that you were --\nthat you use it, which means \"clinical\" is stuff submitted\nfor the drug application, and \"preclinical\" is for the\nearlier application. That is not at all --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, it's not at all\nclear. And, just as in Boyle, when this Court faced a\nsituation where it wasn't clear what the Federal -- or,\nexcuse me -- what the Court of Appeals held, the Court --,\n\"The best thing for this Court to do is to address what\nappears to be the threshold question that the Court of\nAppeals decided,\" but then also to address the subsidiary\nquestions on the basis of which Integra is defending the\njudgment below.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, Mr. Rosenkranz --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: A moment ago -- a\nmoment ago, you were reading from 12(a). Was it the first\nsentence you were reading from?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: It was the first\nparagraph, and I was reading from the end of that\nparagraph, Your Honor, the -- which begins, \"Thus,\" three\nlines -- really two -- the word \"thus\" is at the end of\nthe third line from the bottom of that paragraph, Your\nHonor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: And so, I was saying earlier\nthat a critical component of Integra's case revolves\naround the notion that the use may not have more than one\npurpose, and that purpose can only be FDA directed. That\nargument is also incorrect as a matter of law. And one\nway we can tell that is that there is no such thing as a\npreclinical course of study that has only one purpose.\nWhen one is studying mechanism of action, a scientist is\ndeeply interested, not just in how this drug works, but in\nhow the disease works. And the language of the statute\nis, of course, the touchstone here. The statute is\ntriggered by uses. The use, in this context, is an\nexperiment. And the statute covers, provides a safe\nharbor for, experiments that develop the sorts of\ninformation that are relevant to the FDA. If that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would that -- would that --\nwould that be explained by the research-tool doctrine, or\nnot?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: No, absolutely not, Your Honor.\nThe research-tool question -- let me begin by saying,\nthese were not research tools; these RGD peptides were the\nobjects of study.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I guess what I was asking,\nWould you ever use the peptide as a research tool, was my\n-- was my question.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Oh, yes, Your Honor. There are\ncircumstances in which these peptides could be used as\nresearch tools to stunt the growth of blood vessels and\nstudy what happens next with other compounds, but they\nwere emphatically not used as research tools in this case.\nIn this case, they were the objects of study, and Integra\nwon a jury verdict based upon that presentation. And, in\nfact, never argued to any court or to the jury that there\nis a resource tool carve out. So, I was just talking about\nthe subjective purpose earlier, and it is -- again, it's\nimportant to note that the information can be used for\nother purposes. There's nothing in the statute that\nprohibits that.\nNow, let me turn, just briefly then, to what is\noften one of the most important questions in these FDA\nexemption cases, which is the timeline question. At what\npoint in the arc of drug development is it unreasonable\nfor a jury to conclude that the FDA is an inappropriate\naudience for the next set of experiments? Our position --\nand people may differ, as a matter of law, as to whether\nit is earlier -- but our argument is, at a bare minimum, at\nthe point in time at which a drug developer has a known\nstructure and cures a disease in an animal with that known\nstructure, all eyes turn to drug development; which is to\nsay, all eyes turn to the FDA. As a matter of law,\neverything after that, so long as it's relevant to the\nFDA, is FDA -- is appropriate to view as FDA directed.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do you agree then that at\nwhatever period, however you want to describe the period,\nat which the researcher is basically trying to figure out\nwhat drug to concentrate on, that that period is too far\nback in time to come within the exception?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. That's exactly\nthe trigger moment. If it has a structure, and it's\ninvestigating analogs of that structure to figure out\nwhich of these various structures are the best ones to\nmove forward, everything from that point on is FDA\ndirected.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, here's what -- here's the\nproblem I have with your argument. I can understand that\nargument more easily under the statute, under the text of\nthe statute as it is written, than I can understand it\nunder the instruction that you agreed to, because the\ninstruction that you agreed to had a limitation, a textual\nlimitation which is not in the statute itself, that refers\nto \"relatively directly\" as describing the relationship\nbetween this information and its object. And if we decide\nthis case on the basis of the statute, and we read the\nstatute more broadly than the instruction, then you're\ngetting something that you're not entitled to, because you\nagreed to the instruction. If we decide this issue by\nconstruing the statute as if your instruction is correct,\nthen we're making an assumption about the proper\nconstruction of the statute that has not been argued here.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It seems to me that the law of\nthe case, as to what the statute means for your case, is\nset by the instruction, and that is why I am reluctant to\nget into the issue that you raise here, because I think\nwe're rather -- you are limited, and we are tied in what\nwe can do as a result of your agreement with the\ninstruction.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor -- and I see my time\nis running out; I'd like to reserve a bit for rebuttal, so\nlet me answer, just briefly. Under Praprotnik, of course,\nthis Court is not bound by law of the case by the\ninstruction. But the instruction, as I understand it, says\nexactly what the statute says. \"Reasonably directly\" is\nsimply another way of saying, \"Are these activities\nreasonably related to the FDA purposes?\" And every one of\nthe comparative experiments is relevant to the FDA's inquiry,\nwhether this drug or that is the optimum drug. Every\nexperiment that is involved here -- and there were only 10\npercent that were comparative in nature -- develops\ninformation about the lead drug candidate, including\nunderstanding why this one works, rather than that one.\nSo, if it's all right, Your Honors, I'd like to\nreserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Mr.\nRosenkranz.\nMr. Joseffer.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL JOSEFFER\nFOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. JOSEFFER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI believe the question before the Court is the\nproper construction of the statute, and we believe the\nlower courts committed three important legal errors that\nshould be corrected.\nThe first is in drawing the clinical/preclinical\ndistinction. And, understanding that, Justice Scalia, I\nthink the important thing to understand is that clinical\nstudies refer to studies conducted on humans, and at the\nIND stage, the whole question is to decide whether studies\nshould be conducted on humans. So at that point in time\nthe only information that's available is the preclinical\nstudies on animals and in test tubes. So when the Court\ndistinguished between preclinical and clinical, it was\nessentially saying, you cannot do the information that's\nnecessary to submit an IND, necessary to do clinical\ntrials, necessary to get your drug approved. And that's\nwhy we -- it seems to us that that's clearly wrong.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Do you have to have\nthe FDA's permission to start clinical testing?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Yes, that's the purpose of an IND\napplication, is -- the whole -- the only thing that FDA is\nlooking at, at that point, is whether to permit human\nclinical trials to proceed.\nThe second important legal error committed by\nthe Federal Circuit was in apparently concluding that only\ntests regarding the compounds ultimately submitted to FDA\nin an IND are subject to the protection. Now, the problem\nwith that is that a company can decide which specific\ncompound to submit only by first comparing -- doing\nstudies on that compound and on others in order to\ndetermine which would be the best compound to submit,\nwhich would strike the best balance between obtaining\nhealth effects or avoiding safety concerns. So, if the\nexemption only --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Would you state again what\nyou say the second error was?\nMR. JOSEFFER: The second error, we believe, is\nthat the Federal Circuit indicated that only studies\nundertaken on the single compound ultimately submitted in\nan IND are protected by the exception. And the problem\nwith that is that I can't figure out what that one\ncompound is until I've done studies on it and on other\ncompounds to determine --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That --\nMR. JOSEFFER: -- which is the best to submit.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that might well determine\nwhether the research was relatively directly related. I\nmean, if I were a juror, I would -- I would say it's\nrelatively directly related if it relates to that\nparticular compound which is ultimately submitted, and not\nrelatively directly related if it was preliminary, trying\nto found out which compound to submit.\nMR. JOSEFFER: We would -- we would look at it\nthis way. If I'm -- say I have 12 compounds that I'm\ngoing to test and decide which is best and go forward\nwith. At the time I'm doing a test on any one of those\ncompounds, if those tests succeed, it's reasonably\nforeseeable I'll submit an IND for that compound.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I understand all that.\nBut --\nMR. JOSEFFER: And the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- I'm just saying that that is\ncertainly one interpretation of \"reasonably directly.\"\nAnd if that is so, then you are erroneous in your\nassumption that the question before this Court is the\nmeaning of the statute. It might not be. It might be --\nit might be the meaning of the instruction.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, I think we would disagree\nwith that, for two reasons. The first is that the Federal\nCircuit, as Justice O'Connor noted, reserved -- resolved\nthese questions entirely as a matter of law, based on a de\nnovo interpretation of the statute, without regard to the\njury instruction. And that's the holding that's now\nbefore this Court.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: What's your position on the\njury instruction? Does it correctly state the law?\nMR. JOSEFFER: We think that it's -- if it's\nconstrued correctly, we think that it's correct, but just\ntoo general to be of assistance to the courts in\naddressing the more specific questions of the issue here.\nAnd this is -- remember, Merck has sought judgment as a\nmatter of law. And when a party seeks judgment as a\nmatter of law, the courts are not constrained to only\napplying the law that's found in the jury instruction;\nthey can also articulate and apply -- and do all the time\n-- other legal principles that are relevant. Praprotnik\nv. St. Louis is a great example of a case where this Court\ndid that.\nNow, there would be a problem if the jury\ninstruction was inconsistent with the correct rule of law,\nbecause then there could be a waiver concern. But we\ndon't see that at issue here, because the jury\ninstruction, we think, was just too general to speak to\nthese issues.\nBut getting back to my point about why it can't\nbe limited to that single compound --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But who's fault is that\nthat the jury instruction is too general. I mean, if both\nparties agreed to it, aren't they, in a sense, bound by it?\nMR. JOSEFFER: We think that the Petitioner\nshould not, and is not, arguing inconsistently with the\njury instruction. The point is just that juries, being\nlay people, tend to be instructed --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: The Petitioner said he\nagreed with the core of the instruction, whatever that is.\nMR. JOSEFFER: I think that's just with the\ngeneral principles. Take, for example, a negligence case.\nJurors are instructed all the time that the Defendant has\na duty of ordinary care. And then courts, on appeal, will\ndetermine more specific legal questions, whether entire\nclasses of conduct do or do not comply with the ordinary\ncare, in much greater detailed instructions to the jury.\nAnd example of a case where this Court did that would be\nShenker v. B&O Railroad, at 374 U.S. 1. And we think that\nin a -- in determining whether a Petitioner is entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law, this Court should just\narticulate and apply the specific legal principles here;\nthey're not inconsistent with the jury --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Was the court below wrong in\nsaying that the statute was enacted only to help generic-\ndrug development?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Yes. In fact, this Court already\nheld in Eli Lilly v. Medtronic that the statute is not\nlimited to generic drugs. In fact, it's not even limited\nto drugs, but also applies to things like medical devices,\nfood additives, color additives. And it's a very\nimportant point, because the Federal Circuit thought the\nstatute to be construed in an artificially narrow manner\nin light of a supposed focus on generic drugs, which is\njust inconsistent with this Court's authoritative\nconstruction of the statute.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is that going to be your third\npoint, the third error that the court supposedly\ncommitted?\nMR. JOSEFFER: No, the third is the error\ncommitted by the District Court and relied on by\nRespondents here, which is the statement that FDA only\nconsiders safety, and not efficacy, in determining whether\nto permit human clinical trials to proceed. It's a very\nimportant point, because at the IND stage the question for\nFDA is whether a drug should be given to human beings.\nAnd because there's no such thing as an absolutely safe\ndrug, because all drugs entail at least some safety risks,\nFDA will not let human clinical trials proceed unless\nthere's some reason to believe that the study could be\nuseful. It's a -- it's a benefit-risk analysis. The\nCourt looks to whether the potential benefits of the test\nwould outweigh the risks of the test; and if not, the\nCourt will not let a test proceed.\nNow, Congress charged FDA with doing that by\ninstructing FDA to determine whether the drug would pose\nan unreasonable risk to the health and safety of humans.\nAnd FDA has construed that, as I said, to mean the\nbenefit-risk.\nThe most express articulation of that comes in\nthe guidance document that FDA has put out regarding the\npreparation of the investigators brochure, which is a\nrequired part of the 9d submission. And the investigators\n-- and the guidance document explains that the\ninvestigators brochure must provide sufficient information\nfor the -- for the reader to, quote, \"make his/her own\nunbiased risk-benefit assessment of the proposed\nclinical.\" That's set forth on the bottom of page 10 of\nour brief. And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: What are the\nconsequences if someone goes ahead and conducts a clinical\ntrial without the approval of the FDA?\nMR. JOSEFFER: That's contrary to federal law.\nI -- certainly would be severe civil consequences. And my\nguess is there are criminal consequences for doing that,\ntoo.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Your time is short, so could\nyou tell us how far back you think, under the statute, you\ncan go and not -- and be within the safe harbor?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Yes. We think that the proper\ntest looks to whether a company is trying to develop a\nparticular drug, by which we mean a substance with\nparticular characteristics designed to achieve particular\nobjectives. To explain that, we recognize that basic\nscientific research into human biology and disease\nprocesses is not protected. That's just too far down the\nstream of causation. But once I get a particular concept\nfor a drug, this says I'm going to treat the disease in a\nparticular way by targeting a particular part of the\ndisease process. Then we think that the work done, going\nforward, with includes comparing different substances to\nfigure out which would be the best active ingredient, is\nprotected. To provide a concrete example --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't that basic research?\nI mean, I want to -- I want to treat this disease by\nstifling the development of blood cells around it, or\nsomething like that, and then you ask yourself, \"Gee, what\nwould stifle the production of blood cells?\" And let's\nassume there hasn't been any research done in that field\nbefore. You wouldn't consider that basic research, so\nlong as the idea I have in my -- in my head is, I want to\ncreate a drug to treat this disease that will stifle blood\ncells?\nMR. JOSEFFER: No. And here's why. The basic\ninsight, and then I'll explain it, is that the first time\na study -- a study is run on a particular substance, if\nthat's -- first study is not protected, then the exemption\nis worthless, because I'd have to commit that infringing\nstudy before I gained the protection of the exemption.\nSo, we would say that the -- in this case, for\nexample -- I think it's easier on particulars -- the\nbasic research was figuring out that the key to cancer is\n-- the key to the growth of tumors is angiogenesis, and\nthe key to blocking angiogenesis is blocking the alpha v\nbeta 3 receptors. That's the basic research into how the\nbody works. But once I then start trying to figure out\nwhich substance would best block an alpha v beta 3\nreceptor, it's very specific, because I know what that\nreceptor is, I know what it's like, I know what\ncharacteristics I'm going to need in a drug to block that.\nAnd when I try different things out to block that, that\nfirst experiment, at that point, has to be protected,\nbecause, otherwise, I'd have to commit the infringement\nbefore I could get --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Did the earlier process that\nyou described, the basic research, is that within the\ncommon law research exemption?\nMR. JOSEFFER: The -- it would be if it was\nnoncommercial.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: How does the common law\nresearch exemption figure into this case, if at all?\nMR. JOSEFFER: It's not directly before here\nbecause Petitioner has not relied on it at all, and\nfor good reason, which is that the courts have\nconsistently held that the common law research exception\napplies only to noncommercial activity. The most obvious\nexample would be kids in their basements. But when a drug\ncompany, that its entire business is developing and\nmanufacturing drugs, undertakes the activity, that's\ncommercial, and that's never been considered protected by\nthe common law exception.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does Scripps -- is Scripps in\nthe business, too?\nMR. JOSEFFER: I see my red light is on, if I\ncould answer the question.\nSome of Scripps' work, when it's working\ndirectly for Merck, certainly is, we would think, you\nknow, tied closely to Merck's commercial activities.\nScripps may also do some other bioresearch --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nJoseffer.\nMr. Flores.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MAURICIO A. FLORES\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. FLORES: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis Court stated, in Black versus Cutter\nLaboratories, which is cited on page 27 of our brief, as\nfollows, \"At times, the atmosphere in which an opinion is\nwritten may become so surcharged that unnecessarily broad\nstatements are made. In such a case, it is our duty to\nlook beyond the broad sweep of the language and determine\nfor ourselves precisely the ground on which the judgment\nrests.\"\nThis is such a case. The judgment of the\nFederal Circuit was its order affirming the District\nCourt's denial of Merck's motion for judgment as a matter\nof law. The precise grounds for the Federal Circuit's\nopinion is set forth in page 14a in the appendix attached\nto Merck's petition for certiorari. And there the Federal\nCircuit said that it upheld the denial of Merck's motion\nfor judgment as a matter of law because the Federal Circuit\ndiscerned no error in the District Court's interpretation\nof section 271(e)(1), which raises the question --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where is this? Page 14a --\nMR. FLORES: Yes, Your --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What are you quoting from?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it just before the letter\n\"b\" on 14a?\nMR. FLORES: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What are the first few words of\nthe sentence there that you quoted?\nMR. FLORES: \"Because the language and context\nof the safe harbor do not embrace the Scripps-Merck\ngeneral biomedical experimentation, this Court discerns no\nerror\" --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Exactly. And so, they are\nsaying that they're wrong on their ground for thinking\nthat the language and context don't embrace it. Since\nthey used the wrong standard, they never got to the\nquestion of whether the evidence warranted a directed\nverdict. So I don't see how we avoid looking at all of\nwhat you'd call the atmospherics.\nMR. FLORES: The precise holding and the\nreasoning of the Federal Circuit was, they found no error\nin what the District Court's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because they interpreted the\nstatute in a particular way. Isn't that right? I'm\nasking. I'm not --\nMR. FLORES: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No?\nMR. FLORES: The only interpretation of the\nstatute that can be found in the District Court's order\ndenying Merck's motion for judgment as a matter of law is\nthe standard articulated in the jury instruction.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, but I think -- I think the\nJustice was asking whether it was the Court of Appeals\nthat --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- applied a particular\nstandard. And certainly it had to have been. Didn't the\nCourt of Appeals have a particular standard as to what\nconstituted general biomedical experimentation, as opposed\nto the kind of experimentation that's covered by the -- by\nthe safe harbor exemption? It must have had. I mean, how\ncould you -- how could you rule on the question before you\nunless you have, in your head, a notion of what the safe\nharbor consists of and what is beyond it?\nMR. FLORES: The question before the Federal\nCircuit was whether the District Court erred by not\napplying the rational predicate interpretation of section\n271(e), which was the sole focus of Merck's appeal to the\nFederal Circuit.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why should we say that's the\nquestion, when the Federal Circuit, itself, said what I\nread before from 10a?\nMR. FLORES: Your Honor, on page 10a, the Federal\nCircuit said, \"Thus\" -- and this is in the -- the last\nsentence in the middle paragraph of the page -- \"Thus,\nthis Court must determine whether section -- the section\n271(e) safe harbor reaches back down the chain of\nexperimentation to embrace development and identification\nof new drugs that will, in turn, be subject to FDA\napproval.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: That would answer that question?\nMR. FLORES: It does not. The Federal Circuit\nanswered that in the negative. The Federal Circuit\nrejected the interpretation advanced by Merck, which was\nthe rational predicate standard, which was basically a\ncausal test, and held that the District Court's\ninterpretation, under the Intermedics standard that's\ngiven in the jury instruction, that Merck now concedes is\nthe correct standard.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So they say that it does not --\nthe safe harbor does not reach, among other things, back\ndown the chain of experimentation to embrace the\ndevelopment of new drugs that will be subject to FDA\napproval. In your opinion, is that statement, as I read\nit -- I left out the word \"identification\" -- as I read\nit, is that statement a correct statement of the law, or\nincorrect statement?\nMR. FLORES: That is a correct statement of the\nlaw.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That is a correct statement of\nthe law. So then, I take it, the other thinks that it\nisn't, because, for example, you could have a situation\nwhere you are developing drugs, and, in developing drugs,\nyou do some experiments and you get some information that\nwould be useful to the FDA and the IND process, and,\ntherefore, they are within the safe harbor.\nMR. FLORES: No, Your Honor. I believe the\nSolicitor General agrees with this aspect of the Federal\nCircuit's opinion and makes that clear at the bottom of\npage 15 and onto page 16 of the Solicitor General's brief.\nMerck no longer challenges this aspect of the Federal\nCircuit's opinion. Merck concedes that there are\nexperiments in the basic research phase, that, although\nthey're necessary in the chain of causation, are not\nexempt. The rational -- Merck has abandoned the rational\npredicate standard that the Federal Circuit rejected here.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Flores, when I asked you\nabout the sentence on page 10, I intended, not the one\nthat you read, but an earlier one that precedes it, and\nthat is, \"The questioning arising in this case is whether\nthe preclinical research\" -- that is, the research on\nanimals, as distinguished from humans -- \"conducted under\nthe Scripps-Merck agreement is exempt from liability for\ninfringement of Integra's patents.\"\nNow, if you just took that as the question, then you\nwould say it -- this Circuit is drawing the line between\nclinical and preclinical. It's not a crystal-clear\nopinion, by any means, but that is one question presented\nthat they've identified. And how do they answer that\nquestion?\nMR. FLORES: Your Honor, I disagree. I think\nthe operative language in this sentence is the reference\nto \"the Scripps-Merck\" -- is to \"research conducted under\nthe Scripps-Merck agreement.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's the way I read it. It\n-- the -- and this is why I was disagreeing with counsel\nfrom the other side. It -- well, counsel ultimately\nconceded, you could read it not to draw the line between\nclinical and preclinical. And the way you read this\nsentence is -- the question, they say, is not whether\npreclinical research falls under 271(e)(1); it's whether\nthe \"preclinical research conducted under the Scripps-\nMerck agreement.\" And then the next sentence explains\nwhat that means. The experiments did not supply\ninformation for submission to the United States Food and\nDrug Administration, but, instead, identified the best\ndrug candidate.\nSo, I think what they're describing as the\nquestion presented is whether preclinical research that is\n-- that is not directed to supplying information for\nsubmission to the Food and Drug Administration, but,\ninstead, to selecting the drug candidate, whether that\ntype of preclinical research is within the safe harbor.\nMR. FLORES: Yes. In fact, Justice Scalia, if\nthis opinion by the Federal Circuit were interpreted to\nhold that preclinical experiments are categorically\nexcluded from the scope of the exemption, that holding\nwould be inconsistent with the District Court's\ninterpretation of the law, because the District Court's\ninterpretation of the law was that preclinical experiments\nare potentially eligible, and the District Court submitted\nthe question to the jury.\nSo the Federal Circuit would be completely\ninconsistent, if, on the one hand, it categorically\nexcluded preclinical experiments, and, on the other hand,\nit approved the District Court's reasoning.\nJUSTICE BREYER: This very dialogue\nmakes me able to ask a question that I think will reveal\nbetter to you what I need an answer to.\nReading this, and listening to the discussion,\nand your use of the word \"atmospherics,\" suggests that the\nopinion below is pretty foggy. We have Merck, the Food\nand Drug Administration, the Government, the entire\nbiotechnology industry, the drug industry of the United\nStates, and everybody else telling us that they are wrong\nin the way they stated the standard. And you, yourself,\nurge us to look beyond the way they stated it. So, what's\nthe harm, and why wouldn't we, given this and the\nunclarity, just try to do a better job at stating the\nstandard, say, \"That's the standard,\" and then send it\nback, and then you can make all your arguments there about\nhow it applies.\nMR. FLORES: Yes. The reason it would not be\nappropriate for the Court to do so is because no standard,\nother than the Intermedics standard that was applied by\nthe District Court, was ever suggested to the District\nCourt. There was only one standard ever considered.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We're not reviewing the\nDistrict Court's opinion. We granted certiorari as to the\nparticular question which will deal with what was the\nCourt of Appeals opinion. We don't ordinarily simply\ncompare the Court of Appeals' opinion with the District\nCourt's opinion to see if they parse.\nMR. FLORES: Yes, Your Honor. But in this case\nthe issue before the District Court was whether the\nDistrict Court erred in denying a motion for judgment as\na matter of law.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, don't you think that\nthe Federal Circuit may have focused too much on generic\ndrug applications? Do you think it was right about that?\nMR. FLORES: I think the Federal Circuit was\nright, as a factual matter, in describing the impetus for\nCongress adopting section 271(e).\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, it seemed to be driven\nby its very narrow focus on generic drug development. Do\nyou -- do you think that the efficacy of the drug being\nsuggested plays a role in the IND application?\nMR. FLORES: No, Your Honor, it does not.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: See, I think there may be a\ndifference there, because I think the other side thinks\nthat how the drug is expected to work, in practice, and\nwhether it, in fact, will attack a certain disease, is\npart of what the FDA looks at. Apparently, the Government\ntakes that position, as narrowly as I could determine.\nBut you reject that, as well.\nMR. FLORES: Yes, Your Honor. I think the\nanswer to that is in the statute. It's a -- it's section\n-- it's 21 United States Code 355(i)(3)(B)(i). And in\nthat --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Can you repeat that 355 what?\nMR. FLORES: (i) --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- (i) --\nMR. FLORES: -- (3) --\n-- (B)(i) again. And, in this\nsection, Congress is telling the FDA what are the\nconsiderations that the FDA has to weigh in making the\nsafety decision, the decision whether to allow clinical\ntrials in humans --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is this text that you're\nreferring to, is it someplace -- is the text someplace\nwhere we can look at it while you're explaining this to\nus?\nMR. FLORES: No, Your Honor, it's not in the\nappendix, unfortunately. Let me read that statute,\nbecause it's instructive about what Congress told FDA to\nweigh for the --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But does the -- does the\nstatute -- is that the only place we would look to decide\nwhether safety is the only consideration for the FDA?\nMR. FLORES: No, Your Honor. The regulations, I\nbelieve, address that. And the regulations are 312.22(a),\nwhich is in the appendix attached to Integra's brief on\nthe merits. And I'll read that. It says --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But you do --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What are you --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- you do agree, do you not,\nthat the Government does not agree with you on this point?\nMR. FLORES: The Government disagrees, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What are you reading from?\nMR. FLORES: Page 3a in the addendum to\nIntegra's brief.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. FLORES: That's 21 C.F.R. Section 312.22(a).\nIt states that, \"The FDA's primary objectives in reviewing\nan IND are, in all phases of the investigation, to assure\nthe safety and rights of subjects, and, in phase two and\nthree, to help assure that the quality of the scientific\ninvestigation of the drugs is adequate to permit an\nevaluation of the drug's effectiveness and safety.\"\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, that talks about the\nprimary concern. There is certainly going to be concern\nwith efficacy to this extent. They are going to want to\nknow, before they allow clinical trials, whether the drug\nthat it is proposed to give cancer patients has some\nrelationship to cancer, as opposed to the common cold.\nAdmittedly, at the clinical trial they're trying to find\nout how effective it is on human beings, but there's got\nto be some threshold showing of effectiveness. They can't\nsimply ignore effectiveness and look at safety entirely\nprior to that point.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In fact, that paragraph refers\nto effectiveness, as I read it.\nMR. FLORES: Yes, it does, Your Honor. But it\ndoes -- it refers to it in the context of phases two and\nthree. And the simple fact is that until there's clinical\ntrials in humans, there's no way tell whether this drug is\ngoing to be effective.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But there is at least --\nthere's got to be some way to tell whether it even\naddresses the disease. That is essentially a threshold\neffectiveness question.\nMR. FLORES: The FDA statutes and regulations do\nnot use the term \"efficacy\" to describe that. In section\n355(i)(3)(B)(i), when Congress listed the factors to\nconsider, what it listed was not efficacy. Efficacy is\nnot to be found where its listed --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Congress described the need\nthat there be some relationship between the consequences\nof taking the given drug and the disease which is supposed\nto be addressed by taking the drug. If they didn't use\nthe word \"efficacy,\" what word did they use?\nMR. FLORES: They --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They used the word\n\"effectiveness,\" which is pretty close.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. FLORES: No, Your Honor, they used the word,\nin the statute, \"the condition for which the drug is to be\ninvestigated.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's important. They say they\nwant to know the pharmacological action of the drug in\nrelation to its proposed therapeutic indication. The\nreason, I take it, the word \"efficacy\" is not there\ndirectly is because that word has a history, the Kefauver\nhearings, and it was involving drugs that don't do\nanything. Safety is a different matter. But of course\nwhen you consider whether something is safe, you must\nknow, since, for example, cancer drugs poison people, the\nextent to which that poisoning is outbalanced by its\neffect in curing people. So how could you possibly,\nparticularly where cancer is at issue, know whether this\nis an appropriately safe drug, without knowing how\neffective it is, as well as knowing the side effects that\nare -- that are harmful? If I knew that there was any\nanswer to that question at all, I might be tempted to\nagree with you, because it doesn't use the word. But\nwhat's the answer?\nMR. FLORES: The answer is that the FDA\nconsiders what information is available to it. It does\nnot have information about the effectiveness of the drug,\nbecause clinical trials have not taken place; and,\ntherefore, the regulations and the statutes say you do the\n-- what you can. You look at the condition for which the\ndrug --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But why wouldn't it have\ninformation about effectiveness on animals? I mean, if\nthe -- you show that the -- all the FDA's interested in is\nthat it didn't kill the animal, never mind whether it was\neffective to cure the tumor?\nMR. FLORES: The FDA is concerned with safety in\nanimals. And there may be some cases in which there is a\nknown safety risk to a drug, and there will be a\nheightened look at potential benefits in order to balance\nthat out. But the regulations focus on safety. And in\nthis particular case --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, but it's absolutely\nclear, I thought, that the FDA, at the end of the day in\nsome of these drug applications, ends up looking at not\nonly safety, but how effective it is. And sometimes if\nthe safety risk is minimal but the effectiveness is great,\nI understood at least, that could affect the decisions.\nSo, I would think that you would want to encourage the\nexemption to cover those matters.\nMR. FLORES: Your Honor, of course FDA is very\nconcerned about efficacy, and it -- but concerned about\nthat after it gets data from human clinical trials.\nThat's the -- that is the basis of --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, I'm not sure. If there's\ndata earlier, at the IND stage, as a result of the lab tests\nand the animal tests, I would think that would be part of\nthe exemption.\nMR. FLORES: If efficacy -- or some information\nabout what benefits the drug might have, is probably a\nbetter way to phrase it -- is considered at the safety\nstage as part of the safety balancing, then it's got to be\ndone under good laboratory practices, because --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose that we concluded --\nwell, I don't want to cut you off. Go ahead, please. If I\ncut you off.\nMR. FLORES: Yes. If -- I believe the Solicitor\nGeneral's point is that the safety decision is a practical\none, and you've got to look at both sides of the ledger --\npotential harm, potential benefit -- I don't believe it's\nproper to call that \"efficacy.\" But whatever you call it,\nif it's part of the safety balancing it has to be done\nunder good laboratory procedures. That, I think, is clear\nfrom the FDA regulations. And, as a matter of policy, it\nwouldn't make any sense for the FDA to say that half of\nthe safety equation need not be done under good laboratory\npractices. Both parts of the safety equation have to be\ndone under that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- so what? I don't\nunderstand what conclusion that leads to.\nMR. FLORES: Well, Justice Scalia, let me say\nthat I think that this whole discussion about the\ninterpretation of the FDA law is really somewhat off the\npoint here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I was beginning to think that,\ntoo.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. FLORES: And the reason I say that is\nbecause we're not here to judge the legality of an FDA\naction in its discretion, saying we want to consider\npreclinical --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but the reason you\nbrought it up is because the particular certificate that\nis for a safety-certified lab is not applicable to the lab\nthat used this stuff. That's why you brought it up, I\nthink.\nMR. FLORES: That is correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I understand that. And\nyou'd have to conclude, for them to win -- but suppose I\ndid conclude -- suppose, for hypothetical -- the sake of\n-- for -- as a hypothetical, suppose I thought, yes, this\ndoes include the safety part, looking at how effective\ndrugs are, too. Suppose I concluded that the statute\nmeant sometimes you could do that, in an ordinary\nlaboratory that didn't have the special certificate?\nSuppose I concluded that, indeed, you could look well in\nadvance of the clinical test period to get the information\nfor the IND? And suppose I concluded that sometimes,\nwhere it was reasonably related, you could, in fact, look\nat other drugs, too, that are related to the ones you do.\nIf I concluded that -- and I'm not saying I would -- then\nwould you concede that a directed verdict would have been\nappropriate against you?\nMR. FLORES: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because? And what's your\nstrongest argument that it wouldn't?\nMR. FLORES: Well, Your Honor, there's numerous\nadmissions in the record that Merck made which would\nindicate that they've -- that the program carried out at\nScripps was not reasonably related to the FDA, that the\nreal FDA work was being done in Germany, that the majority\nof these experiments conducted by Scripps were conducted\non chicken embryos, which Merck's own scientists agree\nhave nothing to do with safety, and, by logical extension,\nthey can't tell you much about efficacy, either. Merck\nagreed that a significant portion of these experiments in\nwhich Merck was looking for non-peptide compounds as\npossible drug candidates, is something that --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, we don't -- I hope we\ndon't have to, at this Court, look at all the evidence and\ntry to sort it out that way. What we have to focus on is\nwhether the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit was\nin error in articulating the scope of the exemption.\nMR. FLORES: Your Honor, this Court does not\nhave to get into Rule 50 review of the evidence here --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: No.\nMR. FLORES: -- because there's no dispute about\nthe legal standard. We've all heard that this morning.\nThe only other possible issue is Rule 50 review. But\nMerck has failed --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, I thought the issue was\nwhether the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit\ncorrectly determined the scope of the exemption. If they\nwere wrong about it, then it is open to us to correct that\nand send it back.\nMR. FLORES: Your Honor, the Federal Circuit\ndidn't determine the scope of the invention. There's --\nit's --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Exemption. The statutory\nexemption. I thought that was what we were looking at.\nMR. FLORES: Yes, that's what I was referring\nto. The Federal Circuit didn't articulate a standard for\nthat. The Federal Circuit approved the District Court's\nuse of the Intermedics standard, under which preclinical\nexperiments are potentially --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but it certainly thought\nthat the FDA considers only safety, and nothing else, that\nit was directed at generic drugs, not others, and that\nthere was a cutoff point earlier than that argued by the\nGovernment and the Petitioner for what is exempt\npreclinical trial information.\nMR. FLORES: The Federal Circuit's opinion, I\nbelieve -- the Federal Circuit's opinion rejects the\nrational predicate theory. It does not articulate an\nalternative standard to that. It merely ----\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: They spent about ten\npages in the appendix trying to do that.\nMR. FLORES: But Federal Circuit didn't do that.\nThat was discussion in there. It gave a lot of background\nabout the statute, which may not have been necessary for\nits ultimate holding. But the Federal Circuit, when it\ncomes down to it, didn't do anything other than approve\nthe District Court's interpretation.\nNow, if the Federal Circuit did something\ndifferent than that, which we just -- which is -- Integra\ndoes not believe is the case, its judgment should be\nupheld on the grounds articulated, that it could discern\nno error in the District Court's judgment -- in the\nDistrict Court's denial of Merck's motion for judgment as\na matter of law.\nTo respond to one of Justice O'Connor's earlier\nquestions, \"Does this Court have to get into a Rule 50\nreview,\" the answer is no, because Merck failed to\npreserve its right to Rule 50 review. In the District\nCourt, in the Federal Circuit, the -- Merck argued the\nrational predicate standard as a matter of law. That was\nrejected.\nRule 50 review, under the Intermedics standard,\nis an entirely different argument, and Merck never raised\nthat argument in -- before the Federal Circuit. In its\nbrief, Merck relies, on pages 50 and 51 of its brief to\nthe Federal Circuit, saying there it argued substantial\nevidence. But what it argued there was, the experiments\nare rational predicates. Merck never argued, before the\nFederal Circuit, that the verdict can't be sustained under\nRule 50, under the Intermedics standard, as opposed to the\nrational predicate standard, so it's not entitled to that\nreview here.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The dissenting judge did not\n-- the dissenting judge, Judge Newman, did not read the\nCourt's opinion the way you do. Is that correct?\nMR. FLORES: That is correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Maybe we should take that\ninto account, to some extent, that someone who\nparticipated on the bench had a different take on what her\ncolleagues were saying?\nMR. FLORES: That is certainly a consideration,\nbut we disagree with Judge Newman on that point.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there a difference between\nyou and Merck concerning the scope and extent of the\ncommon law research exemption? And if there is, does that\neven enter into our case?\nMR. FLORES: That issue hasn't entered into the\ncase, so there's been no differences articulated, Your\nHonor.\nAnd to get back to the point that Merck did not\npreserve its right to Rule 50 review under the Intermedics\nstandard, even if it had raised that issue before the\nFederal Circuit, clearly the Federal Circuit didn't reach\nthat issue. And if the Federal Circuit didn't reach an\nissue that was properly presented before it, that was\nerror, and Merck would have had to seek relief from that\nerror. And it did not do so in its petition for\ncertiorari. So, I do not believe this Court even needs to\naddress the issue of Rule 50 review.\nThere is no dispute in this case as to the\nsubstantive standard that governs the scope of Section\n271(e)(1), and Merck, having failed to preserve its rights\nto Rule 50 review under the Intermedics standard, there\nhis no controversy for this Court to decide.\nIf the Court does reach the issue of Rule 50\nreview under Intermedics, it is -- the case should be\ndecided under the basic principles that it is the\nexclusive province of the jury to weigh the evidence and\nto determine the credibility of the witnesses.\nAnd my time is up, but -- almost -- but I'll say\none thing. After 25 days of trial, the District Judge, in\nhis denial of Merck's motion for judgment as a matter of\nlaw, expressly said that the jury had reasonable cause to\ndisregard the testimony of Merck's main witness, Dr.\nCheresh. And, on that ground alone, the judgment of\nthe Federal Circuit should be sustained. Merck can't be\nrescued from the jury's verdict unless this Court\ndetermines, as a matter of law, that the jury was required\nto believe the testimony of Dr. Cheresh. And Merck can't\nshow that, and hasn't even attempted to show that.\nUnless there are any questions --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Flores.\nMr. Rosenkranz, you have two minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Your Honor.\nWith my two minutes, I want to make one\noverarching important point, and it's really in response\nto a question Justice Scalia asked.\nThe emphasis in the statute is about the use, so\nlet's get past labels about, Is this drug discovery or\nbasic research, or is it, as Merck says, optimization on\nthe lead drug candidate, and look at exactly what was\noccurring here. Here, this was not a, \"Gee, we'd like to\nsee what affects angiogenesis.\" Merck knew what affected\nangiogenesis. It had a structure. And if you look at\npage 42 of the supplemental appendix, you will see that\nstructure. It knew exactly what that structure did and\nhow it did it. It then tweaked it by changing, literally,\nthree atoms to compare that activity with other activity,\nexactly the sorts of research that any drug innovator\nwould do to verify that they have the best and most\neffective candidate. Then, with -- and with every single\none of its experiments, it was examining information that\nwas relevant to mechanism of action, pharmacology,\npharmacokinetics, and efficacy. With 10 percent of the\nexperiments, it was also running them in parallel with a\nseries of analogs that were designed to look exactly like\nthe RGD peptides, and to work exactly like the RGD\npeptides. And no rational drug innovator ever proceeds to\nclinical trials, nor does the FDA want it to, without\nconducting that research, because you don't spend millions\nof dollars for expensive toxicology studies until you know\nyou've got the safest and most effective drug candidate.\nThe FDA reviews that evidence, because it wants to know\nwhy you're proceeding with that candidate. And if you\nshift midstream to another lead, as Merck, in fact, did in\nthis very case, the FDA wants to understand why.\nSo each of those experiments, even in\ncomparison, developed information that is relevant to the\nFDA.\nThank you, Your Honors.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\n[Whereupon, at 11:03 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.]\n"
