        "content": "(10:09 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in No. 02-1580, Richard Vieth, et al. v. Robert\nJubelirer.\nMr. Smith.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. SMITH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThis Court held 17 years ago in Davis v.\nBandemer that a claim of partisan gerrymandering is\nactionable under the Federal Constitution. But the lower\ncourts have since effectively overruled Bandemer by\nrequiring factual showings of plaintiffs in these cases\nthat are both impossible and, I submit, irrational. As a\nresult, the state -\nQUESTION: Well, do you - do you - do you think\nthe lower courts then didn't follow Bandemer? I mean,\nBandemer set a very, very high standard.\nMR. SMITH: Well, the standard that I think was -\nthe proper reading of Bandemer does not require that you\nshow that your members of your party have been completely\ndisenfranchised, to the extent that African-Americans once\nwere in the South, or that - that your party has\neffectively been banned. The standard that was applied\nhere required that you show that you're being prevented\nfrom registering to vote, from raising money, from\ncampaigning, from showing up at the polls.\nThose kinds of constitutional violations don't\nmake sense as an element of a partisan gerrymandering\nclaim, because they're not about gerrymandering, and of\ncourse, they never occur. So if you're going to say the\nclaim is justiciable, it doesn't make sense simultaneously\nto require people to establish those kinds of independent\nviolations.\nQUESTION: Three of us in Bandemer thought the\nclaim was not justiciable.\nMR. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor, and I would submit\nto you that - that - that history suggests that - that it\n- the Court should not go that direction, because -\nQUESTION: I was thinking history showed that was\nthe way to go.\nMR. SMITH: Well, what - what we've seen, Your\nHonor, because of the - the fact that the lower courts\nhave effectively read - rendered -\nQUESTION: They couldn't - they can't reach a\ndecision under that Bandemer standard. It's impossible.\nSo maybe the way to go is to just stay hands off these\nthings.\nMR. SMITH: Well, we've never had a - an\nopportunity for the lower courts to actually apply a\nstandard that says when does the map become so unfair that\nit's anti-democratic? What they have done instead is\napply this shut-out standard, which doesn't allow any real\nscrutiny of the map.\nQUESTION: Let - let me tell you my concern with\n- with fairness. If - if you look at British\nparliamentary history, begin with Walpole and go to\nDisraeli and Gladstone and Pitt and Churchill, and then if\nyou come to this country and you think about Dirksen and\nCannon and Webster and Clay, I don't recall any of them\never talking about this issue from a standpoint of\nfairness.\nLegislate - there's just no sources on which we could -\nfrom - from which we can draw.\nI would concede that what happens here is unfair\nin some common - common parlance. It - it - it looks\npretty raw. But I don't recall legislators talking about\nwhat neutral standards ought to be. Now, we have in our\nown juris - people talk about contiguity, geographical\ncompactness, but I just don't think we have a - a large\nsource on which to draw. We know about numbers, one - one\nperson, one vote. But beyond that, I - it - it seems to\nme that we're at sea.\nMR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, what we - what we\ntry to do is articulate a standard which is tied to the\nbasic democratic values that are at stake and to the - and\nto the article I standard that says the people should\nultimately be deciding who's going to be representing them\nin Congress, not the states. The one thing that's clear\nfrom the constitutional -\nQUESTION: Well, since we're talking about\narticle I, it also says that the times, place, and manners\nof holding elections for Senators and Representatives\nshall be prescribed in each state by the legislature, but\nthe Congress may, at any time, by law, make or alter such\nregulations. That suggests to me it's none of our\nbusiness.\nMR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, this Court held in\nWesberry v. Sanders, and has since twice done - applied\nthat again, both in Cook v. Gralike and the - and in the\nTerm Limits case, that there are judicially enforceable\nlimits on the extent to which a state, in exercising the\nprocedural power to establish the times, places, and\nmanners of congressional elections, can create an uneven\nplaying field and attempt to try to dictate the outcome of\nan election.\nQUESTION: All right. But then the problem is\nthat I think I have and others is, what are these\nstandards? Now, you propose, one, look to the mind of the\nlegislature. We'll do that. They'll always want party\nadvantage, always. Look to the extent to which they\ndepart from historically drawn lines. Well, the\nhistorically drawn lines themselves are random. Third,\nhistory. Why is history the key? Third, look to see\nwhether or not the minority party might get the majority\nof votes, but the minority of seats. Whether they might\nin the future, that depends how people vote in the future.\nThere's no set of lines where you couldn't\nimagine results that could come out that way. So how do\nwe do it?\nMR. SMITH: Your Honor, that's - with - with all\nrespect, I - I - first of all, we don't suggest that you\nshould somehow look at the departure from historical\nlines. That's not part of our -\nQUESTION: You said look to see whether the\ntraditional criteria are predominantly ignored.\nMR. SMITH: That's -\nQUESTION: That's what I'm referring to.\nMR. SMITH: Okay. That's part of the intent -\nyes.\nQUESTION: I've read it. I understand it.\nMR. SMITH: Our - our standard on effects is that\n- does not suggest that politics should be taken out of\nthis process. As this Court recognized in Gaffney -\nQUESTION: No, no. I - my question is, how do\nyour standards possibly work?\nMR. SMITH: The standard would be, under our -\nunder our submission, can you demonstrate that it is\nabsolute - that it is very clear that you could get more\nthan half the votes and have no chance.\nQUESTION: Always can.\nMR. SMITH: No.\nQUESTION: You can't draw a set of lines such\nthat I couldn't imagine a voting pattern such that that\nwouldn't happen.\nMR. SMITH: But, you see, our standard is\nprecisely the opposite. You have to show that it would -\nunder any voting pattern, it would happen. There is no\npossibility that with more than half the votes you could\nget anywhere near half the seats.\nQUESTION: You're - you're just pulling this -\nyou're just pulling this thing out of a hat, so to speak.\nI mean, you've got phrases in the Constitution that\nCongress may do it or the states may do it. You've got\nthe Equal Protection Clause, which was - came into being,\nyou know, in 1868, not in the original Constitution. And\nthey - they just don't intimate anything like what you're\ntalking about.\nMR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, we - we focus on\nthis 50/50 point, this majoritarian standard for two main\nreasons.\nQUESTION: What - what -\nMR. SMITH: One is a - is a matter of principle,\nwhich is to say, when does consideration of politics go\ntoo far? It goes too far when we're no longer operating a\ndemocracy -\nQUESTION: Well - well -\nMR. SMITH: - we're having a minority party\ncontrol the majority of seats.\nQUESTION: Well, when you say, you know, the -\nthe Constitution doesn't ever use the word democracy.\nMR. SMITH: Yes, but we - but we have a - we have\na -\nQUESTION: Not to mention party.\nQUESTION: Yeah.\nMR. SMITH: We have a commitment though to the -\nto the fact that the House of Representatives is supposed\nto mirror the people and is supposed to be -\nQUESTION: Well -\nMR. SMITH: - representative of the people.\nQUESTION: Well, you - but -\nMR. SMITH: And we -\nQUESTION: The - the - the Constitution\noriginally provided that the - the standard for the state\nvote would be the standard for the Representatives in\nCongress. And in other - it - it was simply left up to\nthe states. And there were property qualifications for\nmany years, so it didn't represent the people in that\nsense.\nMR. SMITH: The reason we are focusing on the\nmajority standard, the 50/50 standard, is in part because,\nas this Court has recognized in Wesberry and it's\nrecognized in - in - in Cook and it's recognized in\nThornton, the states are not supposed to be deciding for\nthemselves who's going to be representing the people. The\npeople are supposed to decide.\nThe second reason is that 50/50 you don't have\nthese problems of distortions, which, as an empirical\nmatter, happen in a winner-take-all, single-member\ndistrict system. When you get to 60/40, the party that\nhas 60 percent of the vote ordinarily would expect to get\nmore than 60 percent of the districts. That's why you\ndon't - you don't ever want to have a rule of proportional\nrepresentation.\nQUESTION: It happens under a system of\npresidential electors too, as we recently saw. Is that\nunconstitutional also?\nMR. SMITH: No, Your Honor. The electoral\ncollege is not a majoritarian standard in the same way\nthat we - we have here. Because of the Great Compromise,\nit includes two Senators are counted, two votes for the\nSenators in every state across the board, so there - that\n- that is the disparity between the popular vote and the\nelectoral college. But in the - but the House of\nRepresentatives was supposed to be the mirror of the\npeople and the - this Court has constantly policed the\nefforts by the states to encroach from procedure into\nsubstance, to try to decide in advance, as Pennsylvania\ndid here. We would rather have two out of three of our\nRepresentatives be Republicans, even though we're a 50/50\nstate, and regardless of how people vote, we're going to\ndetermine -\nQUESTION: Yeah, but it's not - let - let me -\nyou've got me up to the point of this 50/50 business. Now\nI'm thinking. Let's use party names. It helps for\nclarity. Suppose the Democrats have, under the\ndistricting, they're - they're the ones who are the\nvictims. Now, let's suppose that they did get 55 percent\nof the state vote for Congress in the next election. Now,\nyou're saying that if it were true by this map that\nthey're getting that vote, 55 percent, meant that\nnonetheless, they had to get fewer than half the\nCongressmen, then it's bad.\nAnd my problem with that is, I don't see how\nwe're going to know in advance, unless this is going to be\ndone by some experts coming in and measuring prior votes\nand getting into an argument. And if that's what's going\nto happen, I keep thinking of Ken - John Kenneth\nGalbraith, who says, I'd rather be governed by 400 people\nchosen at random from the telephone book than the Harvard\nfaculty. All right, now -\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: That's a joke, but nonetheless, is a\nserious point.\nQUESTION: William - Will - William F. Buckley,\nJr., not - not - not Galbraith.\nQUESTION: Now, do you see my -\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SMITH: Other side of the aisle. Your Honor\n-\nQUESTION: Now, I've exposed the entire problem.\nI want you to respond to it.\nMR. SMITH: Your Honor, experts will in all\nlikelihood be involved as we - we have an example of the\nkind of expert testimony that can be given here. But this\nis not, to use another expression, rocket science.\nExperts testify in voting rights cases about how districts\nwill behave. They use prior election returns plugged into\nthose districts to make estimates about how they will\nbehave, and it'll be the burden on the plaintiffs to\nestablish - they have the burden of proof - that, in fact,\nit is true that if you get - that - that the - this\nfavored party, with more than 50 percent of the vote, will\nhave essentially no chance of getting half the districts.\nThat is -\nQUESTION: Were the experts on which you rely,\nwere they presented as witnesses in the district court?\nMR. SMITH: We had a trial on the one person, one\nvote claim, Your Honor, after the partisan gerrymandering\nclaim was defeated, was dismissed. And the - the state\ntried to justify the deviation by talking about neutral\nprinciples that governed this map, and so we had the\nopportunity to put a kind of preview of our partisan\ngerrymandering evidence on -\nQUESTION: Yes, but Mr. Smith, isn't it true that\nwhat the issue is sufficiency of your complaint?\nMR. SMITH: That's - that's correct, Your Honor.\nAt this point -\nQUESTION: And may I ask you a question that -\nthat troubles me about the complaint? It seems to me your\ncomplaint was drafted on the theory that you agreed with\nJustice Powell's position in Bandemer, but the position\nyou've come up with in this Court is entirely different\nand not the one that I read into the complaint. Your\nmajority analysis theory is - is really quite different\nfrom - from that theory. You - you seem to have abandoned\nJustice Powell.\nAnd I - what I wanted to ask you is, under the\ntheory of the complaint, as opposed to the theory on which\nyou're arguing in this Court, if you were - you allege\nthat there were no neutral justifications whatsoever for\nany district line. And if you put in proof to that effect\nand the - and the other side prove there were neutral\njustifications for half the districts, say, but the - that\nthere were a half that did fit your allegations, would -\nwould - in your view, would the district court have the\nauthority to review the districts that were totally\nunjustified without meeting your majority analysis claim?\nMR. SMITH: I think the court does have to look\nat the effects of the deviate - departures from\ntraditional district criteria -\nQUESTION: Assume the effects, say you've got two\nplaintiffs, one from district 6 and one from 16, I think.\nMR. SMITH: Yes.\nQUESTION: If, for example, the - the court\nthought that district 6 had absolutely no justification,\nit's wildly, you know, the shape is so terrible and so\nforth, but the rest of the map was okay. Under your\ncomplaint, could the judge do anything about that?\nMR. SMITH: I - I think it - the - certainly\nunder our complaint and under the - our conception of the\ncase, you don't look at one district in isolation and say,\nthis district is too ugly or too much of a departure -\nQUESTION: I know your complaint is drafted as a\nall-or-nothing, but I'm just wondering, within the -\nwithin the allegations, would - would it be open to the\njudge to say, well, they lose on the total picture, the\nmajority theory is - is just too - too novel for me, but\nwhat they've said about district 6 pans out 100 percent.\nIs that -\nMR. SMITH: That - that's not our case, Your\nHonor, and - and the reason for it is, I don't think that\nthis Court is going to come in and start imposing,\nparticularly districting criteria, when an ugly-looking\ndistrict -\nQUESTION: In particular districts?\nMR. SMITH: - an ugly-looking and odd -\nQUESTION: They did that in the racial\ngerrymandering context - situation.\nMR. SMITH: Only when - only when it's talking\nabout race on either side of the line, and - and it could\nbe that the Court would ultimately get to the point of\nsaying a district that's too ugly and - and divides\nDemocrats from Republicans ought to be viewed in the same\nway.\nBut our submission is more like the racial vote\ndilution case, that not only are there departures would\nshow partisan intent, but you have to look, as the Court\nsaid in Bandemer, statewide and see whether, in fact, the\n- the - the legislature has created a situation where a\nRepublican votes counts twice as much as a Democratic vote\nin this state because -\nQUESTION: Race does not change. You - you are\nthe race you are, and you're not going to change it next\nyear. Political party doesn't work that way. How do -\nhow - how - how do you decide what, you know, what - what\nis the Republican vote?\n-\nMR. SMITH: No, Your Honor -\nQUESTION: - and is everybody that's registered a\nRepublican now have to stay - maybe we should make them\nstay registered Republicans so that we can have good\ndistricts, right? I mean, it - it - I just don't\nunderstand how you run this scheme. You cannot really\ntell until after the election is done how many Republicans\nand how many Democrats there are in each district.\nMR. SMITH: Well -\nQUESTION: Are - are you going to -\nMR. SMITH: - the way you identify -\nQUESTION: - count on party registration? Is\nthat the basis for divvying it up?\nMR. SMITH: No, Your Honor. It's how people have\nvoted and how -\nQUESTION: In the last election.\nMR. SMITH: Yes. And it - it would again be the\nburden of the plaintiff to show that there are predictable\nvoting patterns, that there's a large chunk of people who\nare consistent Democratic or Republican supporters who are\nbeing injured in their voting rights by means of a - of a\ndeliberate scheme by the legislature.\nNow, the idea that these people are hard to\nidentify is a little hard to square with a map, in which\nyou have these incredibly complicated peninsulas going out\nto find -\nQUESTION: Any particular election, they are very\nhard to identify in any particular election, which is why\nthe parties go about selecting their candidates very\ncarefully. If it didn't make any different, they'd pick\nany old body -\nMR. SMITH: What the evidence -\nQUESTION: - and run them and - and you'd get all\nof the same Republican and the same Democrat votes.\nThat's not the way the world works.\nMR. SMITH: Well, what the plaintiff would have\nto show in such a case is that there's a sufficiently\nconsistent pattern of voting in the state that a racial -\nthat a political gerrymander is possible and it has\noccurred and it - and that it will - and that, in fact, in\nthe future there will be an injury to one class of voters\nwho have been packed into a small number of 90 percent\nDemocratic districts, while there's a much larger number\nof relatively safe Republican districts.\nNow, you can say that's not true or we can't\nknow it, but we all sit here knowing - know that's what\nthey did.\nQUESTION: Mr. Smith -\nQUESTION: Well, what is it -\nQUESTION: To - to what extent - what - to what\nextent, Mr. Smith, does your - does your theory depend on\nthe registration of the voters?\nMR. SMITH: Registration might be an indication\nof voting patterns, but our theory is - is you look at\nvoting patterns and decide in advance of the next\nelection, will there in fact be a - a situation where it's\nimpossible for - if the Democrats got half the votes or\nthe Republicans got half the votes, it would be impossible\nfor them to get close to half the seats.\nQUESTION: Well, what is the -\nQUESTION: The point is it -\nQUESTION: - particular vice of - of\nredistricting, just on the basis of politics? Suppose you\ndid it on the basis of isolating or - or fracturing union\nvotes, or - or the gay vote or the environmentalist vote\nor farm subsidies?\nMR. SMITH: Well -\nQUESTION: Where - where - where does your - your\n- your principle particularly elect political parties? In\n- in - in fact, it seems to me that parties might - might\nwell conclude - include some of these groups that I've\nmentioned.\nMR. SMITH: This Court has - has made clear in a\nnumber of cases that the Government has no business\ndiscriminating against people based on their partisan\naffiliation or their political viewpoint, in contracting,\nin jobs. And it seems to us it would - it should be clear\nthat at some point, a level of discrimination in designing\nthe machinery of democracy, the electoral process itself,\na - a form of discrimination that's equivalent to saying,\nin two-thirds of the district we're going to count all the\nRepublican votes twice, in one-third of the districts\nwe're going to count all the Democratic votes twice.\nQUESTION: But certainly you allow for some\ndiscrimination? I mean, that - that's the way\nlegislatures go at it.\nMR. SMITH: Well, as this - this Court has made\nclear, both in the race area and the politics area,\nredistricting is a little different from other areas. It\ndoesn't make any sense to demand purity and a complete\nnon-consideration of these factors, but there has to be an\nouter boundary. If there's no outer boundary, then -\nQUESTION: Mr. - Mr. Smith, you're - you're\nessentially asking how much is too much. You say you have\nthis decision that said people have this claim that they\ncan bring, Bandemer. But that was a case where the bottom\nline was, and you have no claim on the merits. Now, if a\njudge, a district judge, in - in one of these cases said,\nwell, here's the Indiana plan and the court said that that\nwas okay, and this one doesn't look any worse to me. Is\nthere a difference between the Pennsylvania plan and the -\na significant difference between those two?\nMR. SMITH: There's a -\nQUESTION: With our precedent, I mean, you have\nto take the whole of it, not just half. The half standing\nto sue you like, the bottom line, but the Indiana plan,\negregious as it may look, is okay.\nMR. SMITH: Well, the facts shown in the Indiana\ncase, in the Bandemer case, were much less severe than\nthose we alleged here, in terms of - here we had\nallegations which were ultimately supported by expert\ntestimony in the one person, one vote trial, that they\nwould get a large super-majority of the districts with\nonly half the - with half the votes or less.\nAnd in - in Bandemer, the facts as they were\npresented, there was no such expert analysis. Instead,\nthey relied on the results of one election in which one of\nthe bodies actually came out the right way and one of them\ncame out slightly the wrong way. They had not supplied\nthe Court with the same kind of evidence that we would\npropose to supply, and - and did not meet, at least as an\nevidentiary matter, the standard that we propose here.\nIt might be that, in fact, if somebody looked at\nthat Indiana map, it might have met that, but nobody\nstudied it in that way. They were simply saying, look,\nit's really ugly, they've got these unfair, multi-member\ndistricts in certain cities, and, in fact, the way the\nvote came out in the House, the Democrats got more than\nhalf the votes and got only 43 percent of the seats. That\nI - that, I submit, is not a sufficient basis to establish\nthe outer boundary that we would suggest you have to meet.\nQUESTION: But if you're going to say it's not\nfair, fairness in what sense? If we say it's not fair to\ndraw lines that will pack and crack one party or another,\nyou're going to end up with no geographical boundaries,\nbecause all geographical boundaries do that. A random\nsystem in Pennsylvania would give the Democrats no\nRepresentatives -\nMR. SMITH: What -\nQUESTION: - purely random.\nMR. SMITH: Well, that's -\nQUESTION: So - so it's, I mean, my point is that\npoliticians and the public, in fact, in form has one idea\nof what's fair and it's very hard for a judge to turn that\nidea into judicially administrable rules.\nMR. SMITH: Your Honor, with - with respect, I -\nI think that it is perfectly possible for somebody to look\nat a map and decide whether or not it does or does not\nunfairly discriminate against one of the political\nparties. Courts draw maps themselves fairly - fairly\nfrequently. They collect testimony from experts, the map\nin Pennsylvania that was -\nQUESTION: You - you can tell whether it\ndiscriminates against one political party, I guess on the\nbasis of - of - of projections that may turn out to be\nwrong. You -nobody can say for sure. But what - what you\ncan say, what you can guess about, is simply that it will\nfavor one party over another, yes. But - but is it so\neasy to tell that it will unfairly favor one party over\nanother? And that's what you're arguing here.\nHow unfair is unfair? I don't know. What is\nit, 60/40?\nMR. SMITH: If it gets to the point where one\nparty's getting two-thirds of the seats with less than\nhalf the votes, in a democracy, I submit that's the place\nwhere it crosses the line.\nQUESTION: Okay. Mr. Smith, you - is - is that\nthe - the - the force of your argument, I take it, is not\nthat this happens in one electoral year, because there may\nbe all sorts of reasons. It's something, your argument\nis, it happens over time.\nMR. SMITH: It -\nQUESTION: Let's - let's - let me start with that\nassumption.\nwhich we - we come up with a wait-and-see rule, and we\nsay, it's not enough for you to prove a - a violation to\npredict in advance. You've in fact got to prove a\nviolation by looking back and establishing through the\ncourse of three or four elections that - that this pattern\nis emerging. And let's assume we say, if you can do that,\nyou win.\nMy question, which then goes to the substance of\nwhat you're going to win, and ultimately the substance of\nwhat your claim must be is, what is the principle that the\ndistrict court must apply in a case like that to reform or\n- or redraw the districts? Does he - does he come up with\na principle that says anything that follows traditional\nredistricting principles, you know, compactness, et\ncetera, is okay? That won't necessarily solve your\nproblem.\nHas he got to come up with a scheme that says\nthere's a presumption that all districts have got to be\ncompetitive? If he does that, there's going to be a clear\nbreak with tradition because there are loads of places\nwhere you can't have competitive districts. What is the\nprinciple on which he's going to reform it?\nMR. SMITH: Well, let - let - I will - let me\ndirectly answer that question in a moment, but let me just\ncomment.\nwait three or four election cycles to - to prove your\ncase, it would essentially be - mean that the claim is\nworthless, because you're going to redraw the districts\nevery 10 years, and there's an enormous amount of\nirreparable harm, as you suggest.\nQUESTION: Two elections.\nMR. SMITH: As you suggest, there's already\nirreparable harm. Once you've thrown out all the\nincumbents of the disfavored party, they have new\nincumbents that have come in now. It doesn't mean that\nyou can't have a remedy, and it would seem to me the very\nfirst thing you'd want to do, just as you do in a race\ncase under section II is - is have a map which does not\ninherently pack and crack the disfavored group to the\npoint where they don't have the opportunity to -\nQUESTION: The - the trouble is, in the race\ncase, you have a relatively simple objective in mind. And\nthat is, the relatively simple objective is that once you\nidentify the political party of the racial voter, the\nminority voter, that minority voter ought to have, in\neffect, the same opportunity as a non-minority voter of\nthat political party.\nHere, we have a different problem. What is the\nforce or power that a member of a given political party\nought to have? It's not as simple as the race case.\nMR. SMITH: Well, I think the inquiry would\nessentially be the same though. They - the parties would\nhave to come with the remedial map, the - presuming the\nlegislature would have an opportunity to draw on in the\nusual situation, in which they could show that it is no\nlonger the case that there is such packing and cracking of\nDemocrats that - that at 50 percent, they would have no\nchance of getting 50 percent of the seats.\nQUESTION: What - what if you have more than two\nparties? I mean, like Minnesota, where you have besides\nthe Republicans and the Democrats a very strong farmer\nlabor party?\nMR. SMITH: I assume that the experts could deal\nwith that. In - in reality, in this country -\nQUESTION: I - well, I - I'm sure they can. What\n- what - what test do you want them to apply?\nMR. SMITH: Well, the -\nQUESTION: Each proportional representation for\neach of the parties?\nMR. SMITH: No, Your Honor. The - the - the test\nwe're talking about here is - is if one of the parties\nwould get to 50 percent, would they have an opportunity to\n- to have a majority of the delegation?\nQUESTION: Do you take into account at all in -\nin this picture, this is not something that could have\nbeen adopted by the Republicans in the state legislature\nalone. It took quite a number of Democratic votes to put\nit through.\nMR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor -\nQUESTION: Is that - is that relevant?\nMR. SMITH: It - it might be relevant at trial if\nwe ever get to trial. Our claim was dismissed. What we\nwould attempt to show at trial, and I think we would show\nat trial, is first of all, not a single Democratic Senator\nvoted for it. There were some Democratic House Members\nwho voted for it, and the reason for that is because there\nare five Members of Congress who are Democrats in the\nState of Pennsylvania who are real, real happy with the\ndistricts they got.\nAnd the General Assembly, the Republican\nleadership said, well, if you guys want these districts,\nyou know what - you know what the price you have to pay\nfor, you need to get us some votes. So that - there are\ndynamics that take place, and in any partisan gerrymander\nthere's going to be some really good districts for the\ndisfavored party, just not enough, not - not a fair - fair\nallocation, not one that would allow the party to have a\nmajority control.\nQUESTION: Mr. Smith, over a period of years, can\nyou identify any state where your test of partisan\ngerrymandering has persisted over a period of time, five\nyears or more? Can you give us examples of states where\nit's persisted over a period of years?\nMR. SMITH: I'm not sure that I - that I have\nenough knowledge of political history going back decades\nto be able to tell you whether that's the case or not. It\ncertainly will persist through a decade as long as the\nwhole leadership of the state doesn't shift over to the\nother party, as long as the party that committed the - the\ncrime, so to speak, maintains either the governorship or\none house of the legislature to be able to -\nQUESTION: Because in how many states do we have\na situation currently where both houses of the legislature\nand the Governor are of one political party?\nMR. SMITH: There's quite a number of states,\nincluding, as it happened in - in this round, a number of\nvery competitive states, the - which caused quite a - had\nquite a consequential impact on the Congress, Florida,\nMichigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and now more recently, Texas\nhas come into play and decided to play this game.\nQUESTION: I suppose typically we would expect\nthat over any period of time that condition wouldn't\nremain. You'd - one branch would be in the hands of the\nother party in time.\nlike 50 percent of the voters -\nMR. SMITH: Which, in order to fix the problem,\nonce it already exists, you have to get both houses and\nthe governorship back to - to pass a second bill.\nOtherwise, it's in place for the 10 years and then what\nalso happens in most states is the state legislatures, of\ncourse, gerrymander themselves as well as the - the\ncongressional seats, in order to keep themselves in a\nposition where 10 - 10 years hence they'll still be around\nand in control of the process again.\nSo there is a - a fundamental - fundamentally\nanti-democratic part of this, which means in - in the long\nrun, you are - you do have very competitive states with\nextremely skewed congressional delegations. The - the\ndelegation from Florida is 18 to 7 in a state that has a\nrobust two-party democracy. Now, that - that ultimately\nis not democracy. That's our submission.\nI'd like to save the balance of my time, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Smith.\nMr. Krill, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. KRILL, JR.\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS JUBELIRER AND PERZEL\nMR. KRILL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nBecause politics is inherent in redistricting,\nany test, including the appellants' proposed test in their\nreply brief, requires inherent political choices to be\nmade, choices that we submit are inappropriate for the\njudiciary to make.\nAppellants' latest test, for example, has hidden\npolitical choices in it that are outcome determinative.\nFor example, they use 10 years of statewide races rather\nthan using a single base race, as recommended by the\nsource they cite in footnote 5 of the -\nQUESTION: May I ask you kind of a preliminary\nquestion? Let's assume that them - that their theory\nwon't fly, this majority theory is just too impractical\nand so forth. But what about the theory advanced in their\ncomplaint that the - some of the districts, and perhaps\nall - they allege all - were - were drafted by relying\nexclusively on a principle of maximum partisan advantage?\nAnd supposing the evidence shows that no neutral criteria\nat all were used except let's do the best we can to help\nour own party get as many seats as we can. Would that\nraise a question at all in your mind?\nMR. KRILL: No, Your Honor. First, because I\ndon't think that that's a question that should ever come\nto trial. The legislative process is so complex. Every\nlegislator -\nQUESTION: Well, what if - what if they narrowed\nthe allegation, said just district 6 or district 16 was\nclearly drawn for this purpose and no other, no neutral,\nno effort to be compact or contiguous or follow boundary\nlines or rivers or anything, we just want to get the\nmaximum vote for one particular party here. Would you say\nthat was permissible?\nMR. KRILL: It - yes, I would, Your Honor. And -\nand I would also say that it - it is not only impossible\nto prove at trial, but improper to even attempt to prove\nat trial, because - and we'll - let's take district 6 in\nPennsylvania as an example. Because it would require\ninquiring into the legislative process in violation of\nlegislative privilege.\nQUESTION: No, it would just -\nMR. KRILL: Legislators are pulled in a million\ndirections.\nQUESTION: It would just say to the - when you\nhave a - a really strangely distorted district, the burden\nis on you to point out one neutral justification for it,\nand we'll assume that if you - you won't have to go into\nthe minds of the legislature, just assume there is\nsomething we can point to, such as a boundary line or if\nit's fairly compact or it's - but you can't point to\nanything. You don't have to go into anybody's mind. You\njust say - you give them the opportunity to explain, and\nthey - they say, well, we have no explanation. We did it\njust because we want to get that to be a democratic\ndistrict.\nMR. KRILL: If - if the entire legislature en\nmasse came forward and admitted that -\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. KRILL: - every legislator said, that's why I\nvoted for it, Justice Stevens, I would still say it's a\npermissible legislative choice. James Madison, after all,\nin the Constitutional Convention, acknowledged that they\nwere giving to state legislators the power under article\nI, section 4, quote, to so mold their regulations as to\nfavor certain candidates, closed quote.\nQUESTION: Is there any duty at all to - any duty\nat all in drawing districts to try to do it impartially?\nYour answer is no?\nMR. KRILL: Not constitutionally, Your Honor, but\nthere are -\nQUESTION: Yeah.\nMR. KRILL: - political forces that pull them in\n-\nQUESTION: I understand that.\nMR. KRILL: - in a multitude of directions.\nQUESTION: But then on the Constitution, what\nabout if the legislature decided that the salaries of the\nmajority legislature should be 10 percent higher than the\nminority legislators?\nMR. KRILL: I -\nQUESTION: There'd be a good reason for it,\nbecause they have more work to do. They have to vote and\nthey - they get statutes adopted and programs enacted, so\nwould that satisfy the constitutional duty? If there is a\nduty to govern impartially, do you think it would?\nMR. KRILL: I'm not sure that would prevent a -\npresent a Federal question, Your Honor, but I'm - I'm\ncertain that our supreme court in Pennsylvania would\naddress it. Our - my - my individual clients, the\nlegislative leaders, in fact do have higher salaries,\nprecisely for that reason.\nQUESTION: But that the - all the members of the\nmajority party?\nMR. KRILL: No. I - I don't think so, Your\nHonor. I - I can't imagine that even happening.\nQUESTION: Suppose I have in my -\nQUESTION: Why not?\nQUESTION: Oh, sorry. In - in my mind the, which\nI don't - I want you to assume for the sake of argument -\nthat - that one thing the Constitution aims at, one thing\nthough, it wants to leave all this up to the legislature\nas much as possible, et cetera. But one thing it aims at\nis majority rule. Therefore, if, over a period of time,\nwe have a districting system where the minority - the\nmajority who get the - the majority of votes end up with a\nminority of seats in a serious way, that undercuts the\ndemocracy that the Constitution foresees. And with\ncomputers, that might happen.\nNow, suppose I start with that assumption, and\nI'm looking for a standard. So suppose I combine Justice\nStevens' standard with the requirement to keep judges out\nof it, that this has really to have happened. It's not the\nHarvard faculty. It really happened. And in fact, after\nreally happening once, then we also have the experts who\ntell us it has to happen in the future.\nNow, we have three things - three requirements\nthere that really are designed to police the outer fringe.\nAnd if I start with that assumption of what the\nConstitution wants, why don't I say it imposes those three\nrequirements?\nMR. KRILL: All right. Accepting your\nassumption, Justice Breyer, I - first of all, I - I think\nthat one would have to look at a lot of different things.\nThe appellants' test, for example, assumes that Democrats\nare evenly disbursed across the state -\nQUESTION: Oh, I've rejected their test.\nMR. KRILL: Right.\nQUESTION: I've rejected their test. I've\nborrowed from it, but rejected it.\nMR. KRILL: But because -\nQUESTION: All right. So the test has the three\nelements that I said. One, they're experts. Two, it\nreally happened. And three, Justice Stevens' objective\nversion of there-is-no-other-explanation requirement.\nMR. KRILL: All right. It - it really did happen\nin Pennsylvania in 2000. The - and this was under a\njudicially-drawn map. All right. The party that had a\nmajority of the popular vote got a minority of the\ncongressional seats. The same thing happened again in a -\nin another - in a subsequent election, but it was exactly\nthe reverse. You know, the Democrats and Republicans\nflipped.\nSo it - it can, in fact, happen, Your Honor.\nBut if you allow the experts to control over the voters,\nthen you'll never know the truth of what would really\nhappen. And let me give you an example in Bandemer\nitself. The aftermath of - of the Bandemer case in\nIndiana is instructive, because two years after this Court\nhanded down its decision in Bandemer, the Democrats, who\nwould have had the Court believe that they were consigned\nto an eternity of Republican tyranny, actually won 50\npercent of the state House seats in Indiana. And only two\nyears after that, in 1990, they won control, and control\nhas flipped back and forth ever since in Indiana.\nSo, I believe that Justice O'Connor's concurring\nopinion in Bandemer was - was quite on point. The system\nis self-correcting. Now, the appellants test in using 10\nyears, instead of a base race as their own academic source\nrecommends, actually gives a lot of weight to the past\npreferences of voters, dead voters, voters who have moved.\nNaturally, this is a political choice, because any party\nthat perceives this influence as waning over time will ask\nyou to adopt a test that gives weight to past choices.\nThey also use high profile offices in choosing\ntheir races instead of low-profile statewide races, non-\ncharismatic races as their - as their academic source\nrecommends. And, of course, we have such non-charismatic\nraces in Pennsylvania. We call them statewide appellate\njudicial races. Nothing could be more non-charismatic.\nQUESTION: Unkind of you to say it, sir, unkind\nof you.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KRILL: And, of course, it - they've made a\npolitical choice in not using those races either, because\nin 2001, the year that our legislature was considering\nthis plan, the Republicans took seven out of seven\nstatewide appellate races. They also, as - as - as I\nmentioned, in their test assumed dispersion of Democrats\nuniformly, when, in fact, Democrats, as we all know, are\ncompacted, self-compacted, into urban areas. So, the -\nthe test is very tilted.\nA curious thing that they do in their test is\nturn real races into hypothetical races by normalizing\nthem so as to remove the popularity factor from those\nraces. Well, that's curious, since politics is all about\ntrying to achieve that popular edge. What they did not\ndo, and this is another political choice in constructing\nthe test, is to a use a very - a - a race that was\npractically 50/50 in Pennsylvania in 2000, a race, by the\nway, that's cited in their complaint. It's - it's the Al\nGore race for President. Mr. Gore won 50.6 percent of the\npopular vote in Pennsylvania.\nNow, the statistics show that he also would have\nwon a majority of the congressional districts under the\nplan that's before this Court if he had been packaged as a\ncongressional candidate. Actually, he would have won a\nmajority, 10 out of 19 districts. The statistics are in\nthe joint appendix, page 273.\nQUESTION: May - may I again ask you just one\nquestion about the complaint? Do you think it states a\ncause of action under the theory espoused by Justice\nPowell in his Davis against Bandemer concurrence in the\njudgment? And if not, why not? And then the final\nquestion is, and if it does meet that standard, why isn't\nthat adequate judicially manageable standards?\nMR. KRILL: Yeah, I - I confess that I don't\nclearly remember Justice Powell's standard for\njusticiability in - in his concurrence, Justice Stevens.\nI do disagree, however, with - with his standard for - for\nremedial action. He called for a searching and sensitive\ninquiry. And I submit there really are no neutral -\nQUESTION: Well, but the first question -\nMR. KRILL: - principles.\nQUESTION: - before you reach remedy is whether\nthere's a violation.\nMR. KRILL: Yes.\nQUESTION: And his theory basically was, there's\na violation if there are certain wildly - wildly-defined\ndistricts that have no neutral justification except to\ngive partisan advantage to the people who had the power to\ndraft them and who did not even consult the adversary\nparty in drafting them. That was his standard.\nMR. KRILL: Well, that's impossible to prove and\nimproper to prove. For example -\nQUESTION: It's a matter of burden-shifting, and\nif they can't come up with any explanation whatsoever\nother than partisan advantage, that that's a violation of\nthe - of the duty to govern impartially. And either there\nis no such duty or it is a violation.\nMR. KRILL: Justice Powell's standard would\nrequire individual legislators to come in and say, here's\nwhy I voted. Here's - here's the - here's the -\nQUESTION: Well, do you think - do you think it's\nimpossible to prove that race was the predominant motive\nin a particular redistricting plan?\nMR. KRILL: There are standards this Court has\nadopted, the Gingles standards for - for making - making\nthat case, Your Honor. However, I - I think -\nQUESTION: Well, I mean, do you have to be a\nreally tricky, astute, very clever fact-finder to figure\nout what was going on here?\nMR. KRILL: Well, yes you would, in fact. In\nfact, I don't think - see how you could. In - in this\ncase, for example, it's impossible for the appellants'\ncounsel to even say whether their clients were Santorum\nDemocrats or Gore Democrats. Both won Pennsylvania in\n2000.\nQUESTION: But again, under Justice Powell's\nstandard, they wouldn't have to do that.\nMR. KRILL: No.\nQUESTION: They would just have to say, this is\ntotally irrational unless you can come up with an\nexplanation.\nMR. KRILL: That - that's correct. Now, voters -\nthey would have to believe -\nQUESTION: Of course, it doesn't - it doesn't\nmake much sense to find something justiciable that you\ncan't possibly devise a remedy for, does it? I mean, to\nseparate the question of - of whether there's a violation\nfrom the question of remedy, as though, you know, we'll -\nwe'll - we'll cross that bridge when we get to it, doesn't\nseem to me very realistic.\nMR. KRILL: Oh, if, in fact, I agree, Justice\nScalia. If the court ignores the remedial phase that\nwould necessarily follow -\nQUESTION: But, of course, the remedy would be\nthat redraw district using some neutral criteria.\nMR. KRILL: There are no -\nQUESTION: That's certainly not an impossible\nstandard.\nMR. KRILL: It is, Your Honor. There are no\nneutral criteria. Name a criterion and I'll show you why\nit represents a political choice.\nQUESTION: Historical boundaries, contiguity,\ncompactness, maintaining incumbents of both parties.\nThere are lots of neutral criteria available, and any one\nof them might justify an other - what seemed on its face\nto be a very wild district.\nMR. KRILL: Respectfully, Justice Stevens,\npatterns of development over the last two generations, if\nyou - if you put them on a - on a map, they look like\nsplatters of paint on a canvas. They're not pretty.\nQUESTION: Not as much as some -\nMR. KRILL: But -\nQUESTION: Not as much as the one in Karcher or\nthe one in this case do.\nMR. KRILL: Well, I would point out that -\nQUESTION: Of course, I guess if there are five\ndifferent criteria: compactness, past practice, or\nwhatever, it's very much a political call which of the\nfive criteria you decide to - to use.\nQUESTION: That's a - that's true, and the only\njudicial call is you've got to use at least one.\nMR. KRILL: Well, but - but by saying that - by\ndesignating them as neutral criteria, the judiciary itself\nmakes a choice and takes that choice away from the state\nlegislatures.\nVoters are not automatons in a matrix controlled\nby supercomputers. Voters continue to matter, and they\ncontinue to prove it in election after election. In fact,\nthey proved it in Pennsylvania in 2002 under this plan.\nThe 17th congressional district, which the experts\npredicted would go Republican did not. Voters and good\ncandidates and good issues and good party organization\ncontinue to make the difference, just as they did in -\nQUESTION: How about the rest of their\npredictions? They got the others right, didn't they?\nMR. KRILL: Not quite right.\nQUESTION: Nobody has to bat a thousand, do they?\nMR. KRILL: Well, but we - if - if the plan had\nbeen enjoined, we'd never know how right or wrong they\nwere. And - and -\nQUESTION: But we do - we do now know, which does\ntell us something at least about their predictive\ncriterion -\nMR. KRILL: Well -\nQUESTION: - and - and it is that it - it gets it\nwrong in one time out of 19, was that it?\nMR. KRILL: Yes.\nQUESTION: One instance out of 19?\nMR. KRILL: Yeah.\nQUESTION: That's not bad.\nMR. KRILL: And in - in - in the 6th district, it\nwas very close. It was a razor-edge race. But voters\ncontinue to pull the candidates towards themselves. It's\n- voters are not disenfranchised.\ndistrict in western Pennsylvania, the incumbent\nCongresswoman is - is a fairly conservative Republican -\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Krill.\nMs. DeLone -\nMR. KRILL: Thank you.\nQUESTION: We'll hear from you. Mr. DeLone.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF J. BART DeLONE\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS CORTES AND ACCURTI\nMR. DeLONE: That's all right, Mr. Chief Justice.\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nThe Court should hold that political\ngerrymandering, if it is justiciable at all, violates the\nConstitution if and only if the disadvantaged group has\nbeen shut out of a political process as a whole. This is\nthe standard applied by the Court's unconstitutional vote\ndilution cases, and it is consistent with our system of\nelecting Members of Congress from individual districts.\nIn a district system such as ours, there are no\nstatewide elections for a slate of candidates. Rather,\nindividual congressional elections are defined by the\nunique characteristics of each race. That is why\nstatewide election results offer no meaningful standard\nfor judging congressional outcomes. It is also why a\nproportionality, the idea that some statewide level of\nsupport should entitle a political party to capture some\nspecified number of seats, is incompatible with the very\nidea of districting, and it is why the Court has\nrepeatedly -\nQUESTION: But Mr. DeLone, I - I think our rules\nsay we frown on people simply reading their arguments.\nMR. DeLONE: Yes, Your Honor, I'm sorry. And the\npoint, Your Honor, is that Mr. Smith and appellants' plan\nwill lead the Court to proportionality if - if the Court\ndoes not consistently apply the - the vote dilution\nstandard that has - has applied in the past. And that\nstandard is that you have to be shut out of the political\nprocess -\nQUESTION: Well, the - the - tell - answer - I'll\nask you a question and then you will get away from your\nprepared argument.\nMR. DeLONE: Thank you.\nQUESTION: But the - the - the - in - in my own\nview, not - not the Court's - in - in my own view in the\npositive discrimination race cases, I believed -\nMR. DeLONE: The - the Whitcomb v. Chavis -\nQUESTION: The positive discrimination cases, the\ncases that say you cannot draw a racial district, racial,\nminority district -\nMR. DeLONE: The Shaw Line - the Shaw Line cases?\nQUESTION: Yes, correct.\nMR. DeLONE: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: I said you could, I thought that the\nlegislature could do that, primarily because if they could\ndo it in political party cases, why couldn't they do it\nin race cases where it's meant to help the minority?\nWell, I lost that. So believing what I thought, doesn't\nthe reverse hold true? If this Court has found manageable\nstandards to use to control positive discrimination in\nfavor of racial minorities for drawing boundaries, then my\ngoodness, why can't it find standards to prevent the\nRepublicans from doing the same thing to the Democrats or\nthe Democrats from doing the same thing to the\nRepublicans?\nMR. DeLONE: Because, Your Honor, in the Shaw\nLine of cases, what they were doing is they were trying to\nisolate race from all other factors, including politics.\nQUESTION: And in here, we're trying to - to\nisolate being a Democrat or being a Republican -\nMR. DeLONE: Yes, Your -\nQUESTION: - from all other factors, because\nafter all, as Justice Stevens pointed out, they've been\nable to come up with no explanation other than we did it\nbecause they're Democrats.\nMR. DeLONE: Well, Your Honor -\nQUESTION: That's what the word predominate means\n-\nMR. DeLONE: Right.\nQUESTION: - and you'd insist on that showing -\nMR. DeLONE: But, but Your -\nQUESTION: - just as you do insist on the\npredominant showing in the race case.\nMR. DeLONE: But, Your Honor, assuming that to be\ncorrect, there's nothing wrong with them saying, we did it\njust because they're Democrats.\nQUESTION: Ah, yes, there is, because what's\nwrong with it is if you carry it to an extreme with\ncomputers, you prevent the majority of voters from\nsecuring the majority of seats. And that simple principle\nthat the majority should govern is the basic principle of\ndemocracy. So if you find that in the Constitution, it's\njust as wrong.\nMR. DeLONE: Well, I think you have to - you have\nto look at what majority you're talking about, Your Honor.\nIf - in a districting system, you're talking about the\nmajority in a particular district at a particular time.\nQUESTION: Correct. What we would do is look at\nthe state and we would look to see if in the - we could\neven give a margin of error. The party that got 53\npercent of the votes ended up with 45 percent of the\nseats, okay?\nproduced simply by intentional gerrymandering for no other\npurpose.\nMR. DeLONE: But, Your Honor, if you're doing\nthat, you're - you're - you're going into proportionality.\nYou're saying, if you're entitled to a - to a sum state.\nQUESTION: No, no proportionality. Forget the\nproportionality. I agree with you a perfectly random\nsystem will produce 100 Republican delegation, so I agree\nwith you about that. I'm only sticking to the majority\nrule.\nQUESTION: Do - do people always vote for a\nparticular candidate because he's a Republican or - or -\nor she's a Democrat?\nMR. DeLONE: Absolutely not, Your Honor, and that\n-\nQUESTION: Of course not. So you can't tell from\nthe Republican votes how many of those are Republican\nvotes and how many of them are, you know, Smith votes or -\nMR. DeLONE: Exactly right, Your Honor, and\nthat's why the idea of comparing any sort of statewide\nvote with the districting votes that you actually have is\ninconsistent with -\nQUESTION: Even if that's true, is it not obvious\nfrom the configuration of some of the districts, that\nthose who drafted the districts thought they could predict\nwhat they were going to do?\nMR. DeLONE: Again, Your Honor, assuming that\nthat's correct, there's nothing wrong with it.\nQUESTION: Oh, okay.\nMR. DeLONE: And as far as the - the - what level\nyou come to in a - in a majority/minority consignment,\nJustice Breyer, I think the way that the Bandemer\nplurality did it, again, applying what this Court has\nconsistently applied in vote - in the vote dilution cases,\nby which I mean the Whitcomb v. Chavis line of cases, is\nto say, all right, let's look at this and see if it's like\na diagnostic test, like a threshold. Have we got a\nproblem here where, over time, and I'm not sure how much\ntime, but over a significant amount of time, it looks like\nthe majority overall is being consigned in some way.\nBut, once you do that, you must look elsewhere,\nwhich is what Rogers says, Whitcomb says, all of the - the\nvote dilution cases say. You can't ever look at electoral\nresults alone. That's never sufficient. What you must\nlook to is whether or not there's been something else that\nhas caused a self-perpetuating breakdown in the democratic\nprocess, because as soon as you - and -\nQUESTION: Do you agree with your colleague that\nthere is no need for any neutral justification when you're\ndrawing districts?\npurpose - granted it be an attempt that might not succeed,\nnobody knows for sure how people are going to vote, but is\nit permissible for a legislative body not even to consult\n- I mean, the majority of a legislative body not even to\nconsult another party, not even to take anything into\nconsideration except trying to get the maximum results at\nthe - the election?\nMR. DeLONE: Yes, Your Honor. That's\npermissible, and we think that was the whole point of what\nwe call the racial gerrymandering line of cases, that is,\nthe Shaw Line of cases, where they were saying, okay, we\nhave a special category here that relates to race, and\nwhat we're trying to do is define the difference between\nrace, which is inherently suspect, and which requires\nspecial scrutiny, and politics, which the Court repeatedly\nsaid -\nQUESTION: But if you take that position, then\nyou must be taking the position, I guess you are, that the\n- the holding in Bandemer that this was a just -\njusticiable issue is just erroneous?\nMR. DeLONE: Your Honor, we think that -\nQUESTION: That's your basic position?\nMR. DeLONE: We certainly think that the Court\nshould take this opportunity to find that - that - that\npolitical gerrymandering is non-justiciable. We think\nthat would be the simplest and the cleanest way to frankly\nget out of the political thicket.\nBut - but even if you don't do that, what - what\nthe Bandemer plurality was doing was simply applying what\nthis Court has - has always applied with respect to vote\ndilution. And we think it would be kind of strange if the\n- excuse me, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: May I ask you this? Do you think the\ncomplaint states a cause of action under Justice Powell's\nopinion in Bandemer?\nMR. DeLONE: I heard you ask that before, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: That's why I thought I'd ask you. You\nhad fair warning of the question.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Don't tell me you didn't read the\nopinion.\nMR. DeLONE: No, no. Yes, Your Honor, I - I - I\nthink it would, because Justice Powell thought in terms of\nneutral districting criteria and thought there was some\nobjective reality out there. And frankly, we don't think\nthere is one, and if you start down the road of electoral\nresults, we submit that -\nQUESTION: No, no. He doesn't start down the\nroad of electoral results.\nthat it's an intent to use nothing except a non-neutral\ncriterion in drafting the regulations. And you're\nsuggesting that's permissible. That would not require\ncounting votes after the election.\nMR. DeLONE: With respect to intent, Your Honor,\nwe - we think it - it's - you certainly can assume that\nthere was political intent in a - in a political\ngerrymander -\nQUESTION: And nothing else.\nMR. DeLONE: It - it certainly could be nothing\nelse, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: So is this a - an intent of a bare\nmajority or all of them? What - what - what if -\nMR. DeLONE: Well, I think you can presume that\nas - as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, 42 of 98 in the\nDemocratic caucus voted for the plan. I think you can\npresume that they were in some way -\nQUESTION: You can only - that's a matter of\ndefense. You can't presume that based on the allegations\nat the complaint.\nMR. DeLONE: No, I - I was trying to address\nJustice Scalia's question about -\nQUESTION: I'm trying to get to how you - how you\ndetermine intent.\nMR. DeLONE: Well, I - I -\nQUESTION: Or whether it's based on the majority\nor -\nMR. DeLONE: I - I think you can presume that\nwhatever the voting, there was some political motivation,\nand I think you can presume that the political motivation\nmight be different for different groups, different\nparties. And - and frankly, we - we don't - we don't have\na problem with the intent -\nQUESTION: Belling the cat. I mean, it's\nwonderful to use intent. How do you find intent? That's\n- legislative intent is very hard to determine.\nMR. DeLONE: And - and - and I think the intent\nwould be - would different. But it's - you can even\nassume that it's political -\nQUESTION: Well, how did you find it in the - in\nthe first racial gerrymandering case? Didn't you find it\npartly by looking at the shape of that district in North\nCarolina?\nMR. DeLONE: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Didn't that shift the burden?\nMR. DeLONE: Yes, Your Honor, you did. But in\nthe - in the racial gerrymandering cases, you were looking\nfor something that was race-neutral.\nQUESTION: You were also looking for predominant\nmotive, not what the exclusive motive is, which is the\ntest that Justice Stevens is - is proposing.\nMR. DeLONE: That - that's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: The - the exclusive motive just is\neasier to respond to, because all you got to do is come up\nwith one neutral justification and you use the neutral\njustifications that the Court identified itself in the\nracial gerrymandering cases, such as contiguity and\ncompactness and so forth.\nMR. DeLONE: But again, Your Honor, your - your -\nthe premise of your question is that there's something\nwrong with political motivation.\nQUESTION: Correct. That's exactly right. No,\nno, the premise of the - what the question is that there's\na duty to govern impartially, and that if you have no duty\nexcept partisan advantage, the case is just like saying,\nwe're going to pay the majority legislatures a higher\nsalary than the minority legislatures.\nMR. DeLONE: Well, Your Honor, I - I think that\nwhen you're - when you're dealing with a - a political\nquestion like districting, you're - you're - I think no\npolitical party worth its salt is going to be - not think\nit's - it's doing what's in the public interest to give\nitself as much advantage as possible.\nQUESTION: It can do that as long as it has some\nother basis for doing it, and that's history what we did\nover years and years and years, states have followed an\nattempt to get compact districts, your neighbors are in\nthe same voting area as you are and so forth, not these\nfancy designs that are really a recent product of\npolitics.\nMR. DeLONE: But, Your Honor, in - in all of\nthese traditional districting criteria, they're basically\nused as tools by the political parties to seek what kind\nof political advantage they can. And again, we submit\nthat that is - is - there's nothing wrong with that. And\nthe question is whether or not you've been shut out of the\nprocess, whether something else is happening that suggests\nthat the - the process itself is broken. And if you -\nQUESTION: For example, what would that be?\nMR. DeLONE: Well, Your Honor, it's - it's\nhappened in the past. It's - it's - it's happened with\nReynolds and Baker, and it's happened with -\nQUESTION: But that isn't gerrymandering.\nMR. DeLONE: No, it isn't, but it's the kind of\nbreakdown -\nQUESTION: You're saying there's no\ngerrymandering unless there's something else.\nMR. DeLONE: Yes.\nQUESTION: Which is to say there's no such thing\nas cognizable political gerrymandering, period.\nMR. DeLONE: I - I think what the Bandemer\nplurality was trying to do was to leave the door slightly\najar for something that, frankly, in our political system\nis too resilient to - to allow to happen, but it's\nconceivable that it could happen. And frankly, we think\nthat it's strange to try and change the - the standard,\nwhich is well established in this Court's jurisprudence,\njust because the political system doesn't allow it to\noccur.\nAnd we think that once you go down the road of\nelectoral results, you go down the road of\nproportionality. And the - the references that - that\nappellants' counsel keep making to majorities are\nstatewide majorities, and that is proportionality. That\nis a political judgement, and we believe that the Court\nhas properly rejected that and the Court should continue\nto apply the unconstitutional vote dilution standard and\nthat that - if - if they find that it's justiciable at\nall, and that the easiest and simplest thing for the Court\nto do is to find that political gerrymandering is in fact\nunconstitutional - excuse me, non-justiciable as a matter\nof law.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. DeLone.\nMr. Smith, you have two minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. SMITH: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Let me\nstart off by saying I do think that our complaint\nsatisfies the standards of the Powell opinion in - in\nBandemer that it alleges that partisan maximization was\nthe sole driving force behind this map. And indeed, we\nhad the opportunity in the district court, because of the\none person, one vote problem, for the state to come in and\ntry to come up with some justification for their line-\ndrawing other than partisan maximization, and the district\ncourt found as a fact in that trial that the map\njettisoned every criterion that this Court ever identified\nin Karcher, other than partisan maximization.\nQUESTION: I take it the results you're urging on\nus would require us to supervise local entities, city\ncouncils, boards of supervisors -\nMR. SMITH: They -\nQUESTION: - water districts.\nMR. SMITH: They - they - they as well can\nviolate the constitutional rights of the people who live\nin those jurisdictions, Your Honor.\nAnd let me just address the - the question of\nwhether it makes sense to wait and see how the elections\ncome out and see whether there is, in fact, this anti\nmajoritarian effect from the line-drawing. One of the\nreal practical problems with that is that the lines\nthemselves in a - in an extreme gerrymander like this, can\n- can effect the statewide aggregate vote totals\nthemselves.\nYou saw that right here where, in - with the\nhistory of votes very evenly divided in a - in a balanced\nmap through the '90s, a court-drawn map. Suddenly with\nthis gerrymander you had five Republicans running\nunopposed, you had a number of the Democratic incumbents\ndefeated in the primaries because they squared off -\nQUESTION: I guess if it were the constitutional\nrule, the party could adjust and try to run strong\ncandidates, even in overwhelmingly Republican districts.\nMR. SMITH: Well, I suppose that that is in fact\nthe case, but you can't assume that the - the vote totals\nunder a gerrymander are independent of the effects of\nthat. First of all, if they pair the incumbents, they're\njust not there to run anymore, and there's a substantial\ndistortion caused by the map.\nThere was some discussion by Mr. Krill of\njudicial races as the - the test of - of partisan balance\nin the map because the - the supposition was that judges,\nwhen they run, don't have any great personal magnetism, I\nguess. But he didn't mention the - the race that was\ncited in our reply brief, which - this was 2003 - where\nMr. Bayer ran as a Democrat, got 52 percent of the votes\nstatewide, and carried six out of the 19 districts. That\nis an indication of the basic fundamental packing and\ncracking that's in the map, and is in fact a form of\nsevere discrimination, making some voters' votes count\nmuch more forcefully than others.\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Smith\n"
