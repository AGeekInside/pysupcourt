ROTHFELD\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ROTHFELD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nIn this case we find ourselves in the happy\nsituation of having to try to convince the Court that\nits prior decisions were correct. Just 5 years after\nthe enactment of FELA, the Court declared that it was\nobvious that the statute contained a proximate cause\nrequirement. The Court went on to repeat that\nconclusion over and over again in almost two dozen\ndecisions over the next 40 years. Our submission this\nmorning is that the Court when it made these statements\ngot it right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: How did it happen that in\nFELA we have proximate cause light? It's just a\ndifferent proximate cause than we see in other -- in\nother torts cases. How -- how did that come about?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, we -- we -- our\nsubmission is that that is not correct, that that is not\nwhat FELA provides for at all. And in the Court's\ninitial decisions, the ones that I referred to, it\nstated very clearly that the ordinary proximate cause\nrule applies. The -- the proximate cause test that the\nCourt stated in cases like Brady was the traditional\nproximate cause standard.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you read the cases as\nindicating that more deference is given to juries in\nFELA cases than in other cases?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, that -- that's -- is a\nseparate one from the one we have here. I mean, we are\ntalking here about the nature of the -- the elements of\nthe cause of action that have to be demonstrated by -\nby the plaintiff; and so there -- the question of how\nmuch of that evidence there has to be to get to the jury\nis a separate question that's not presented here.\nOur submission, since you posed the\nquestion, is that there is no different standard; that\nFELA was not intended to depart from the ordinary common\nlaw procedural approaches in that respect, either.\nBut on the question that's presented -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But juries usually find\nagainst railroads anyway, right?\nMR. ROTHFELD: I -- I wouldn't want to\ncommit myself to answering that question affirmatively,\nYour Honor.\nThe Court has said that -- that FELA was\nenacted to address particular problems in the\nadministration of the common law prior to 1908.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It also said that there's\na relaxed standard of causation. I think that's what\nJustice Kennedy is referring to when he said \"proximate\ncause light.\" But we have said in more than one case\nthat there is a relaxed standard of causation in FELA\ncases. Was that wrong?\nMR. ROTHFELD: I think there are two ways to\nrespond to that, Justice Ginsburg. The first is that up\nuntil the Rogers decision, which is -- which is one of\nthe ones which has created I think some confusion in\nthis area, the Court was quite clear and unambiguous\nthat proximate cause in FELA applied in the ordinary\nsense.\nAs I say, in cases like the Brady case the\nCourt stated what proximate cause means; it stated in -\nin entirely traditional terms that -- that the plaintiff\nhad to demonstrate that the injury followed in a\nnatural, probable foreseeable way from the wrongful\nconduct, and so that -- that was the standard.\nThe Rogers case, which was the source of\nsome of the confusion in this area, in our view, as -\nas we think Justice Souter correctly demonstrated in his\nopinion in Sorrell, and as we explain at some length in\nour brief, Rogers we think did not address causation at\nall. The Rogers case was a situation in which there\nwere a multiplicity of causes, and the question was what\n-- what should -- should the rule be when there are a\nnumber of -- of entities that contribute to the\naccident. It had nothing to do with remoteness or\ndirectness of the cause, what we usually think about\nwhen we talk about proximate cause.\nIn -- in the years since Rogers was decided,\nwhen the Court -- got out of the business of deciding\nFELA cases on the facts, it had not had occasion on -\nin any case to address specifically what proximate cause\nmeant in the FELA context.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we have used that\nlanguage. You -- you have not responded to -- to the\nquestion where -- where did this language that does\nappear in our -- in our cases about the relaxed\nstandard, where -- where does that come from?\nMR. ROTHFELD: That -- that comes from, W\nsubmit, from sort of a loose description of what was\ngoing on in the Rogers case, which involved a\nmultiplicity of causes rather than directness and\nremoteness of causes, and so the cases in which that\nlanguage appears, which are the Crane case and the\nGottshall case, did not involve causation at all. The\nquestion of causation was not presented to the Court in\nthose cases.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It has nothing to do with\nthe line of cases I think in the '40s in the FELA cases\nwhere the message of this Court seemed to be quite\nclear, FELA cases go to juries? There are a number of\ncases with reverse dissents that seem to -- to say just\nthat.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, that -- that goes to\nthe question that Justice Kennedy raised at the outset,\nwhich is how much evidence, whatever the standard of\ncausation is, how much evidence must there be to go to\nthe jury? And our presentation here is that FELA did\nnot change the ordinary standard on -- on that question.\nBut that -- but that is not the question that's\npresented in this case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what -- can you\nexplain to me -- I mean, here the judge charged in the\nwords of the statute, and they are also the words used\nin the model Federal instruction: Did plaintiff's\ninjury result in whole or in part from the railroad's\nnegligence?\nYou would say: Was plaintiff's injury\nproximately caused. And as you no doubt know,\nMr. Rothfeld, that term \"proximate cause,\" it just loses\njuries. So considering that these cases go to the jury,\nwhat do you say to the instruction that's now given,\nbased on the words of the statute, \"Did plaintiff's\ninjury result in whole or part from the railroad's\nnegligence\"? What should the judge charge instead of\nthat?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think there are -\nthere are two parts to your question, Justice Ginsburg.\nOne -- one is, what's wrong with the instruction that\nwas given here; and the other is can juries understand\nproximate cause as a concept.\nOn -- on the first point, we have no\nobjection to the instruction containing the language of\nthe statute. The problem is that to be comprehensible\nand intelligently applied by jurors, it has to say more\nthan that. Proximate cause we submit is an element of\nthe cause of action and that has to be explained to a\njury. It couldn't be the case in a Sherman Act case,\nfor example, that a judge could simply charge the jury:\nYou are to determine whether there has been an\nunreasonable restraint of trade; now go to the jury room\nand answer that question. There is a lot more that has\nto go into that cause of action, including, as it\nhappens, proximate cause.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Rothfeld, could you\nexplain to me how it would have made a difference in\nthis case, that instruction?\nMR. ROTHFELD: It -- it would have made a\ndifference I guess in two respects. One is that the\nplaintiff's theory has never at any point been that\nthere was proximate cause in this case. He did not\ncontend that there was before the -- the district court\nand he does not contend in his brief before this Court\nthat there was proximate cause made out. And so -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, maybe explain the\ndifference. I mean, you were answering my question, and\nI asked how would you tell the jury? You said it's okay\nto say: Did plaintiff's injury result in whole or in\npart from the railroad's negligence, but the judge must\nsay something more. So what is the something more?\nMR. ROTHFELD: The something more is what\nthis Court said in its Brady decision, in which it\ndescribed -- the decision in Brady, which is cited and\ndiscussed in our opening brief in -- in some detail.\nBrady described what proximate cause means in the FELA\ncontext; and it means, the Court said, that there must\nbe a demonstration that the plaintiff's injury resulted\nfrom the wrongful conduct in a way that was natural,\nprobable, and foreseeable. That -- that was a\ntraditional statement, is still today a traditional\nstatement of proximate cause.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Natural, probable, and\nforeseeable?\nMR. ROTHFELD: And foreseeable. That -\nthat language was taken in the Brady case directly from\nthe Court's decision, 1876 decision in the Kellogg\ndecision, which we also cite in our brief, which states\n-\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you tell me -- there\nis an article that suggests that juries don't actually\nunderstand what \"proximate cause\" means; and I think,\nand Justice Ginsburg can correct me, that what does that\nmean to a jury -- natural, probable, and foreseeable?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are the three phrases\ndifferent? And how much more detail do you have to get\nin to describe that difference in a comprehensible way?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, that -- that was the\nsecond part of Justice Ginsburg's question, and I got\ndistracted, and I'm happy to address it. I think most\nof the criticism of proximate cause as being confusion\nto the jury has actually been directed at the word\n\"proximate,\" that commentators and some courts have said\nthat's a confusing word, it suggests immediacy, it\nsuggests closeness in time, it sounds like\n\"approximate,\" and so juries find it confusing.\nBut there is -- once it's spelled out, I\nmean, the fact is juries have been applying proximate\ncause, which has been a fundamental, settled, universal,\nuniversally accepted part of common law of torts, in the\nmedicine context in particular, and it has been settled\nfor 150 years.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Apparently only FELA juries\ncannot understand it; all other juries find it okay.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- it is our\nsubmission that FELA juries would have no more\ndifficulty applying it than do juries under the Sherman\nAct or RICO or the securities laws or, the other\nstatutes that this Court has said include a proximate\ncause requirement, or that juries apply every day in\ncourts across the country in court cases.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I just don't -- and\nmaybe this has already been asked, but I'm not sure from\na juror's perspective that it makes terribly much\ndifference the exact formulation of this instruction. I\nthink a juror who sees an employee is suing the\nrailroad, and it turns out that what the railroad did\nhad very little or nothing to do with what happened to\nthe employee, they don't need an instruction about\nnatural, foreseeable causes. They're just not going to\ngive the awards, or they're going to give the awards\neven though the railroad didn't do anything that\naffected the employee.\nIt's a -- it's a nuance that I just don't\nthink has any practical significance.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, we have to assume that\njuries follow jury instructions. That's the fundamental\npremise of the system, and there is no reason to doubt\nthat in the ordinary case, in which the contents of\nproximate cause are -- are explained to the jury in an\nintelligent -- in a way that -- that people can\ncomprehend.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Your client is entitled to\nhave the jury disregard a proper instruction, right?\nThat's what you're arguing?\nMR. ROTHFELD: If the -- if the jury -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Juries disregard\ninstructions on probable cause, on proximate cause.\nThey probably do it in non-FELA cases, too.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- I -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you're entitled to have\nthem disregard the correct instruction rather than an\nincorrect instruction, right?\nMR. ROTHFELD: I will endorse that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My point is that I\ndon't see much practical difference between what you\nargue is the correct instruction and what your friend\nargues is the correct instruction.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, certainly, in terms -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, law\nstudents, professors, and some judges have had trouble\ndefining the concept of proximate cause for centuries.\nI don't know why we expect a juror to be able to\nnavigate through those nuances, either.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- the -- the\nprinciple of proximate cause, the idea that there has to\nbe some limitation beyond but-for causation on\nliability, has been universally recognized. Recognized\nby -- by courts, by this Court, by commentators, by the\nRestatement. The Third Restatement, just published,\nclearly endorsed it. They use -- they quibble about the\nterminology, but they clearly endorsed the absolute\nnecessity of a proximate cause limitation on liability.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think that over the\nlast few decades, there's been an increasing emphasis on\nforeseeability as a component of proximate cause?\nMR. ROTHFELD: There -- there probably has\nbeen. I mean, I'll defer again to the Third\nRestatement, which has a very useful summary of the\ncourse of the law in this area. And the principal tests\nthat are now being used by courts are foreseeability and\ndirectness, which are closely related, I think. I mean,\nclearly, as this Court stated just this month in the\nStout case, it stated a test of proximate cause in terms\nof whether -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Could you give some\nexamples of what causes would be proximate and what\ncauses would not so qualify? Something that's -- you\nsaid but-for is no good. So what would be a but-for\ncause but not a proximate cause?\nMR. ROTHFELD: A but-for cause in this\ncontext would be, there's a defective brake on -- on the\nlocomotive and it comes to a sudden stop. If the\nconductor, standing in the locomotive when the train\nstops, is thrown to the floor and injured, clearly that\nis proximate cause. It -- it is -- it is an injury that\nis related to the risk that made the conduct actionable\nin the first place.\nThe reason that having defective brakes is\nnegligent and gives rise to a cause of action is because\nit can cause an accident that will cause people to fall,\ncause the train to hit something, will cause derailment.\nThat's why it is negligent, and if the kind of injury\nthat follows from the accident is related to that risk,\nthat clearly is proximate cause.\nThe kind which is not would be, train stops\nbecause of the defective brake. No one is injured.\nConductor gets off the train to walk along and see\nwhat's going on, trips and turns his leg, or is bitten\nby a snake.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Rothfeld, are there any\ncases like that in the FELA world? You know, I take it\nthat this basic instruction that was given in this case\nis the instruction that's given in most cases. If you\nlook across the range of cases, do you find jurors\nawarding damages in the kind of situation that you're\ntalking about? In other words, is this a real-world\nproblem?\nMR. ROTHFELD: They did in precisely the\ncase I just described, a case called Richards from the\nSixth Circuit, which is cited in the amicus brief\nsubmitted by the Association of American Railroads. The\ntrain stops because of a defective brake, the conductor\ngets off, walks along, turns his ankle and sues.\nClearly, the risk of someone getting off the\ntrain and having a fortuitous injury is not the kind of\nrisk that gave rise to the negligence. I mean, it's\nnegligent to have a defective brake, but not because\nthere's a bystander who might be bitten by a snake or\nturn -- turn his ankle.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there a case like that?\nMR. ROTHFELD: As I said, the Richards case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but I mean somebody\nmight think that having to go off and patrol a thing in\na rough area is something that happens with a sudden\nstop: You run a risk of turning your leg.\nI agree with you about the snake. Is there\nany case about the snake?\nMR. ROTHFELD: I -- I can't cite you a snake\ncase directly, but -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So the furthest -\nthe furthest -- the furthest that you go is the case of\nsudden stop in the wilderness, gets off, rough area, and\ntwists his ankle.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Or I'll -- I'll cite you -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't know. Is that\nproximate cause or not? Maybe it isn't.\nMR. ROTHFELD: I'll give you two answers to\nthat, Your Honor. First of all, there are other cases.\nAnother case, for example, cited in the amicus brief\nthat I referred to is the Schlumpert case from Georgia,\nin which there's a defective coupling device lying on\nthe ground. If it had -- if it had fallen off the train\nbecause it was defective and fallen on someone's foot,\nclearly that's proximate cause. But it's on the ground.\nThe employee comes along, picks it up, throws off -\nthrows off his -- throws out his back, and sues. That\nis not the kind of -- of injury that one would foresee\ncomes from having defective couplers.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And do you want -\nwhat instruction would you give that would tell the jury\nto allow damages in one of those -- the first of the\ncoupling cases, but not in the second?\nMR. ROTHFELD: The instruction we ask for is\nthe one this Court gave -- said should be given in the\nBrady case: Natural, foreseeable, and probable. It is\nnot -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are jurors going to\nsit there and say, one of those is natural, foreseeable,\nand probable, but the other isn't?\nMR. ROTHFELD: I would -- I would say that\nit is -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't know what\n\"natural\" means. You know, so it's not a supernatural\nsituation?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well -- well, I'm just\nquoting the Court's language to you, Your Honor. But -\nbut certainly, foreseeable and probable, one would say\nthat -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not foreseeable\nthat if you drop a coupling where it's not supposed to\nbe, somebody will come along and try to pick it up and\nmove it?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, but it's not\nforeseeable in the sense that it is unrelated to the\nrisk that gave rise to -- to the cause of action in the\nfirst place. I mean, it's foreseeable in the sense that\nanything is foreseeable.\nIf I give the classic example: I drive -- I\ndrive you to New York, from Washington to New York, and\nI drive too fast, exceeding the speed limit. That's\nnegligent. It's negligent because I run the risk, if I\ndrive too fast, of hitting somebody, of hitting another\ncar, of driving off the road. And so if I do that and\nyou're injured as I drive you to New York, you can sue\nme.\nBut that doesn't happen. I drive -- I get\nto New York safely, you get out of the car, and as soon\nas you get out, you are struck by lightning. It's a\nbut-for cause of your being struck by lightning that I\ndrove too fast. You wouldn't have been there when the\nlightning struck.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You could have been bitten\nby a snake when you're getting out of t car.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: But there has been no such\ncase, to your knowledge?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Or -- or, more likely, you\ncould have been hit -- hit by a car driving across Fifth\nAvenue too fast.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Rothfeld, your\ninstruction actually used the term \"probable cause.\"\nAre you -- \"proximate cause.\" Are you saying now that\nthat's not necessary, that as long as you say\n\"reasonable and foreseeable,\" you would be satisfied?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think that it should\ninclude the term \"proximate\" simply because that has\ntraditionally been the requirement. That's what this\nCourt has said in cases like Brady. It's what the Court\nhas said in cases applying other proximate cause -\nother elements of proximate causation in other\ncircumstances. But it is the concept.\nI mean, as I said, \"proximate\" is a\nconfusing word. That has been recognized sort of across\nthe board. So it has to be spelled out and unpacked.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So why use it at all? If\nyou think that \"reasonable\" or \"foreseeable\" are less\nconfusing words, why shouldn't we just tell the jury to\nuse those words instead?\nMR. ROTHFELD: I -- again, I don't think\nthat it is essential that it use the word \"proximate\" if\nit spells out what is meant by \"proximate\" in -- in -\nas -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the spelling out is\nnatural, probable, and foreseeable?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Again, that is the term that\nthis Court used in Brady, and that is -- is closely\nrelated -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Although your proposed\ninstruction didn't use the word \"foreseeable\"?\nMR. ROTHFELD: It did not use the word\n\"foreseeable.\" It used \"natural and probable.\" But\nwe -- we endorse, again, the test that this Court has\nstated in the FELA context very clearly in the Brady\ncase. There are -- as has been noted in some of the\nquestioning, there has been discussion between courts\nand commentators over the years about what the best way\nis to define proximate cause and explain it to the jury.\nI mean, in terms of the question posed by\nthe Chief Justice, does it actually make any difference,\nI think not only do we have to assume that it makes a\ndifference, because juries are presumed to follow their\ninstructions, but the kind of instruction that was given\nhere was essentially a but-for instruction, that if you\nfind that -- that in any respect, the injuries\nessentially would not have occurred but for the\nmisconduct, for the -- for the negligence of the\nrailroad -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could you explain how it\nmight have made a difference in this particular case\nbased on the facts of the case? As I understand it,\nMr. McBride's theory was that as a result of having to\nuse the independent brake extensively over a long period\nof time with this wide-bodied cab, his hand got tired\nand it fell, and it hit the independent brake.\nIs that -- that's the theory?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well -- that -- that -\nthat's his explanation of the accident. The theory of\nnegligence, as I understand it, as it was presented to\nthe jury by his expert was that the configuration of the\ntrain that he was driving was unsafe because it -- it\ncould lead to derailments, it could lead to breaking of\nthe couplers.\nAs explained by his expert, the -- the\ntheory was not that there was something unsafe about the\narrangement of the braking system, and so, I think that\nthe -- the way in which a proximate cause instruction\nproperly given here could have made a difference is that\nthe jury could have found, well, yes, it was negligent\nto have these five locomotives arranged in the way that\nthey were, but that had nothing to do, except in a but\nfor sense, with the fact that the -- the -- that\nMr. McBride's hand was injured; that the jury could have\nmade that determination and so it could have made a\ndifference.\nNow, I mean, the fact is there was no\nproximate cause argument made below because the\ninstruction that was given by the district court\nexcluded it. And so, as I said before, the -- the\ntheory of the case advanced by Mr. McBride below simply\ndidn't take account of proximate cause.\nNow, if the -- if we prevail here and the\ncase goes back, he will be free to argue under a proper\ninstruction that there was proximate cause, that somehow\nthe configuration of the train affected his -- his\nhandling of the brake.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're really suggesting\nthat the defense attorney here wouldn't have argued the\nconcept of proximate cause in saying the negligence had\nnothing to do with him just deciding to hit the brake?\nMR. ROTHFELD: The -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- I -- I -- I -- it's\nfarfetched, don't you think, that because the judge\nrefused to give a proximate cause charge that the idea\nof it wasn't argued to the jury: What we did didn't\ncause this.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, there -- there is no\nquestion that what the railroad did caused in the but\nfor sense. Mr. McBride would not have been in the cab\noperating the brake system had it -- had it not been for\nthe configuration of the -- of the locomotives. And, so\nif we assume that the configuration of the locomotives\nwas negligent, then but for the negligence of -- of the\nrailroad, this would not have occurred. And that in\nfact is -- is the terms in which the case was argued to\nthe jury by Mr. McBride's lawyer, who said, in so many\nwords: But for the negligence of the railroad, this\nwould not have occurred.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So the -- but the question\nis, what was your argument? What was your side's\nargument? Did you argue, in effect, proximate cause?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Our side argued that there\nwas no negligence at all, that -- that -- that the\nconfiguration of the railroad was perfectly proper, and\nthat -- the -- the -- there was a contributory\nnegligence component to what was going on here. In\nfact, the jury found that Mr. McBride was contributorily\nnegligent in part, and that was part of the -- of the\ndefense presentation, too.\nBut just two or three -- to take a step back\nto first principles, on the assumption that proximate\ncause -- that there is a difference between instructing\nthe jury on proximate cause and not, because the court\n-- it has been a part of tort law, you know, for time\nimmemorial on the assumption that it does make a\ndifference and it has been an important part of tort law\nbecause it has been universally recognized by courts, by\nacademics, by the Respondent that there has to be some\nlimitation on liability beyond but-for causation. If\nthere is not, there is the danger of sort of infinite\nliability, of limitless liability, and particularly of\nfortuitous liability, because there is no way that the\ndefendant in a situation like this can anticipate that\nit's going to be held liable for this kind of injury.\nSo proximate cause has been regarded as an\nessential component of the tort law. And that being so,\nFELA creates a Federal cause of action for negligence,\nit creates a Federal tort. It -- a fundamental\nprinciple of statutory interpretation, this Court has\napplied many times, most recently just this month in the\nStaub case, that when Congress creates a Federal tort,\nit means to adopt the general background of tort law,\nand Congress -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are there any -- any\nnegligence-type statutes? I mean this one, I mean, it's\nodd to say that the judge erred in reading to the jury\nthe words of the statute, did plaintiff's injury result\nin whole or in part from railroad negligence. All that\nFederal statutes, negligence statutes that use the word\n\"proximate\" -\nMR. ROTHFELD: There are -- there are\nFederal statutes that use the word \"proximate.\" I don't\nknow that there are any negligence statutes. So far as\nI understand from our review of the law, at the time\nthat Congress enacted FELA in 1908, there -- there were\nno such statutes that made use of the term \"proximate.\"\nAnd the presumption then, as now, is that\nwhen Congress creates what amounted to a Federal tort,\nthe assumption is that it intends to adopt a background\nof tort law. That was true in the Sherman Act, it was\ntrue in RICO, it was true in securities laws, it was\ntrue just as earlier this month in the Staub case, a\nstatute which did not use the term \"proximate.\"\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you said your defense\nat trial was not about causation, it was no negligence,\nright?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, that's -- that's right.\nGiven the instruction that the jury received, which does\nnot -- did not include a proximate cause requirement,\nand given that if one assumes that there was negligence,\nthere is no doubt that the -- that the injury here was\nthe but-for product of that negligence, there sort of\nwas no room for negligence to be argued to the jury on\nthe defense side. I mean, for proximate -- for -\nfor -- for causation to be argued on the defense side.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Assume you could talk to the\njury and the jury says to you: We found negligence, so\nwe don't want to hear about that; and we've found but\nfor causation and we don't want to hear about that; now,\nexplain to us why there isn't proximate cause here?\nWhat more -- what -- what would you say?\nMR. ROTHFELD: In -- in this case we would\nsay the negligence that is being presented to you and\nthat you have presumably found is that the configuration\nof these locomotives was dangerous because it could lead\nto derailment, it could lead to breaking of the couplers\nbetween the cars. That is the negligence. And\nproximate cause, properly understood, means that the\ninjury on which the plaintiff is suing has to follow in\na probable, natural, foreseeable way from that -- that\nnegligence.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But wasn't the theory\ndifferent, Mr. Rothfeld? Wasn't the theory that the\nconfiguration of the train made the braking and the\nswitching much more difficult for the person in this\nposition?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, if I may, I'll answer\nthat and then sit down.\nThat, as I say, was not the theory that was\npresented by the plaintiff's expert. To the extent that\nthat is -- is a viable theory, it could be presented on\nremand. The argument can be made. I think it's a\ndifficult argument, but -- but it was not presented to\nthe jury here because there was no proximate cause\ninstruction, so there was no opportunity for the\nquestion to be -- be -- be vetted.\nAnd with that, thank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Frederick.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nThis case is a case that presents a\nnon-existent problem and a solution that is in search of\na non-existent problem, because there are no real\nreported cases where there have been problems arising\nunder the Rogers instructions that have become the model\ninstructions under the Federal Rules for over 50 years.\nAnd if could I just begin, Justice Kennedy,\nwith your question which opened this up, proximate cause\nserves two principal functions. One is to limit the\nscope of the persons to whom the tortfeasor owes a duty;\nand the second is to limit the kinds of injuries that\nthat person would be liable for.\nThe innovation in FELA that is so important\nto understand about why the relaxed causation standard\nbecame the accepted standard under FELA was that FELA,\nby its plain terms, did away with the first concept of\nproximate cause because it limited the duty to the\nemployee by the employer. There is no one outside of\nthat relationship that can bring an action under FELA.\nAnd the second thing that it did was it put\ninto what is now section 51 that if the negligence\nresults in, quote, \"in whole or in part\" from the\nnegligence of the railroad, that is enough for injury.\nAt common law the proximate cause standard required that\nthe railroad's negligence be the sole cause. So the\ninnovation that created the relaxation in the causation\nstandard was the inclusion of these words in part, and\nso over time -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, the other side\nsays that what that meant, and -- and -- and the\nlanguage of our cases seems to support that, \"in whole\nor in part\" simply eliminated the common law doctrine of\ncontributory negligence, whereby if the plaintiff also\nhad been negligent, the plaintiff could not recover,\nand -- and FELA uses a -- a -- a comparative negligence\nstandard.\nMR. FREDERICK: And this Court has rejected\nthat kind of approach almost from the beginning of the\nstatute. In Campbell in 1916, the Court asked whether\nFELA has completely eliminated the idea of proximate\ncause. The Court has eliminated and the plain language\nprecludes the sole cause, immediate cause, direct cause,\nlast cause, substantial factor -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why doesn't \"in whole or in\npart\" apply to the elimination of contributory\nnegligence? Isn't that an adequate explanation for the\nlanguage?\nMR. FREDERICK: It's -- it's not one that's\nconsistent with the Court's cases. And let me point you\nback to the day Rogers was decided. If we accept for\npurposes of argument -- and I'm only accepting it for\nthese purposes -- that Rogers was only about multiple\ncauses, on the very same day it decided two other cases\nthat arguably were only about single causes. It decided\na case under the Jones Act, the Ferguson case, and it\ndecided another case under FELA, the Webb case. In both\nof those cases, there were no multiple causes, there was\nno contributory negligence; but what the Court said was\nthat on today we are announcing this standard, we apply\nthat standard to overturn directed verdicts where juries\nhad come to the conclusion that the railroad's\nnegligence had played a part, even a slight one, in\nproducing the injury sustained by the worker.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think that the\nphrase in the statute \"in whole or in part\" allows\njuries to impose liability based on but-for causation?\nMR. FREDERICK: No. The -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why -- why not?\nMR. FREDERICK: As this Court put a gloss on\nthat language in Rogers, it -- it construed those words\nto mean that the railroad's negligence has to be found\nto have played a role, however slight, in producing the\ninjury. Thus in Mr. -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's what but-for cause\nmeans. Tell me about the snake. Is the snake covered?\nMR. FREDERICK: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why not?\nMR. FREDERICK: Because the railroad's\nnegligence there -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Once you abandon a\nproximate cause requirement, however you want to define\nthat, I don't see why the snake isn't covered, or the\nlightning on 42nd Street.\nMR. FREDERICK: Because there the railroad's\nnegligence played no part in producing the jury. It's\nthe producing aspect that provides a little bit more -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Sure it did. The train\nwouldn't have stopped, the conductor wouldn't have\ngotten off, he wouldn't have been bitten by the snake.\nIf the -- if the car had not traveled to New York over\nthe speed limit, the -- the passenger wouldn't have been\non 42nd Street when the lightning struck. I mean, how\ncan you say it didn't play a part? Of course it played\na part.\nMR. FREDERICK: It was certainly an element\nof the existence of the condition. But what the Court's\ncases, Justice Scalia, after Rogers have done, and I\nthink this is an important part of the history, is that\nthere are a couple of outlier cases, to be sure. Courts\nhave corrected them all by saying that the judge -- that\nthe jury could not have reasonably found based on common\nexperience that this snake bite or what have you was\nproximately related to -- played a part.\nJUSTICE BREYER: As I read the statute -- as\nI read the statute, it insists, as interpreted in\nRogers, that the negligence has to play a part in\nproducing, and in the snake case the negligence doesn't\nmatter. It's simply the timing, et cetera. And is -\nthat's how I read it.\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I guess that's how\ncourts have read it. I'm not sure; you know. And I\nsuspect from the answers I've gotten so far there's\nnever been a court that read it differently.\nMR. FREDERICK: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that correct?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That negligence didn't play\na part?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But for the negligence, the\ntrain would not have stopped. How can you say the\nnegligence didn't play a part? Had the train not\nstopped, he wouldn't have been walking along and been\nbitten by the snake.\nMR. FREDERICK: Justice Scalia -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean do words mean\nanything? How can you possibly say that negligence\ndidn't play a part? It obviously did. It seems to me\nyou're arguing for -- not the nonexistence of proximate\ncause. Nobody in his right mind could argue for the\nnonexistence of proximate cause. You are arguing for\nsome different -- different definition of proximate\ncause, and I would like to know what that -- what that\nnew definition is, as opposed to the definition that Mr.\nRothfeld proposed.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, let me start with this\nby saying that the Court and the language of the statute\nhave already eliminate six possibilities for proximate\ncause; and the question now is whether there's something\nadditive to the words that Mr. Rothfeld now proposes for\nthe first time, because this was not language that they\nproposed in their proffered jury instruction, which can\nbe found in the red brief at page 11. There they\nfollowed the Illinois proposed instruction which says\n\"natural or probable sequence.\" That language does not\nappear in Brady. In Brady, a 1943 case from this Court,\nthe words are used \"natural and probable consequence,\" a\nconsequence, of course, being a result, a sequence being\nan order of events.\nNow, their instruction rests on the word\n\"probable,\" which of course in common understanding and\nmost juries would commonly understand, \"probable\" means\nmore likely than not, which is directly in contention\nwith the statutory words \"in part,\" and directly\ncontrary to the way courts had universally understood\nthis language since Rogers.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't know if they said\nthis, but I mean, as I read it, I thought the reason\nthat negligence doesn't play a part is the act which was\nnegligent played a part, of course; it was \"but for\";\nbut the fact that it is negligent is totally irrelevant,\nbecause it's not within the risk in any sense\nwhatsoever.\nNow as I -- you know the area. I don't put\n-- don't just agree with me because I'm saying it. Is\nthat roughly the -\nMR. FREDERICK: That is correct, Justice\nBreyer. And in the cases -- and there really are only a\nfew cases where you can find these kind of outlier facts\nand these kind of, you know, \"out there\" situations, and\none of the reasons is because FELA is only a\ncompensatory damages statute. It only addresses the\nactual injury and the compensation for the worker.\nThere are no punitive damages, there are no attorney's\nfees, there are no treble damages.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You're in the jury room\nand a juror says: This wouldn't have happened but for\nthe wide locomotive; therefore, there should be\nliability. What -- and assume the jury has all of the\nFederal reports in there and the judge lets them read.\nWhat -- what is there for another juror to say that this\nis wrong?\nMR. FREDERICK: The negligence theory here,\nJustice Kennedy, if I could go back to that, was not\nstated in a way that we would subscribe to by -- by Mr.\nRothfeld. Our theory of negligence at trial was\ntwofold.\nOne was that these wide-boded locomotives\nwere not appropriate for the switching exercise that the\ntrain men were doing on that day, and in fact the\nsupervising engineer said this was the only time that he\nwas aware in his long experience where these wide-body\nlocomotives were used for this specific purpose which\nrequired a lot of braking activity.\nThe second theory of negligence was that Mr.\nMcBride was put to this purpose without proper training.\nHe has complained on the day; he was uncomfortable and\nhe didn't know whether he could operate that locomotive;\nand the jury was entitled reasonably to infer that that\npoor training was a -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How did any of those\nthings cause his injury?\nMR. FREDERICK: Because -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You've used the\nformulation negligence played a part in the injury. So\nhow did those things play a part?\nMR. FREDERICK: His -- let's start with his\npoor training. There was testimony that a person who\nwas more skilled in the art of dealing with a wide-boded\nlocomotive would be able to manipulate the independent\nbrake with the automatic brake in a way that would not\ncause the repetitive stress that Mr. McBride suffered.\nAnd there was further testimony that using a wide-body\nlocomotive, which is more difficult to manipulate for\nthe switching operations, and here we're talking about\nmoving in and off main tracks to couple trains, train\ncars so that they can be used for a longer\ndestination -- that that kind of equipment was not\nsuited for the purpose.\nMr. McBride's testimony was when he had used\nthe wide-body locomotive, he had done so on long trips\nover long distances that didn't require the same kind of\nready, manipulative braking of the independent brake.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you don't assert that\nthat's a foreseeable consequence of the negligence of\nusing a wide-body train?\nMR. FREDERICK: It's foreseeable if the\nrailroad is using a piece of equipment without training\nthe person.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you -- you don't -\nMR. FREDERICK: For a purpose that it's not\nordinarily used for.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You say it doesn't have to\nbe foreseeable.\nMR. FREDERICK: They didn't ask for\nforeseeability, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, so you -- you conceded\nthat it ought to be foreseeable.\nMR. FREDERICK: What I -- I would say this\nCourt -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm trying to see what your\ncase is because I can't believe you don't believe in\nproximate cause. I just think you're -- you're giving a\ndifferent definition of it, and I'm trying to figure out\nwhat your definition of it is.\nMR. FREDERICK: My definition, what I think\nthe Court did in Rogers was to try to end the debate\nover how confusing the word proximate cause is in these\nkind of cases by offering simple and direct instructions\nthat juries could understand and apply, and that has\nbeen the case over the last 50 years.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do it. I'm still waiting\nto hear your instruction, which is supposedly something\nother than \"but for.\" Is it just \"but for\"?\nMR. FREDERICK: I would take the words of\nRogers. I think the jury here was properly instructed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: With -- what are the words?\nGive me the words.\nMR. FREDERICK: The words are on page 10 of\nthe red brief, Justice Scalia, and it follows the model\nform instruction that's used in all the Federal courts,\n\"defendant caused or contributed to plaintiff's injury\nif defendant's negligence played a part no matter how\nsmall in bringing about the injury. The mere fact that\nan injury occurred does not necessarily mean that the\ninjury was caused by negligence.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't think that's \"but\nfor\"?\nMR. FREDERICK: Whether you think it's \"but\nfor\" or not I think is beside the point.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't care whether I\nthink. We've got words here. What do those words mean?\nMR. FREDERICK: Those words mean that \"but\nfor\" plus a relaxed form of legal cause associating the\nnegligence in playing a part in produce the injury.\nThat's how Rogers understood it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Negligence is a given; the\nnegligence is not what I'm asking about. I'm asking\nabout causality, and what you have just read is \"but\nfor\" cause.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, I would disagree with\nthat Justice Scalia, and I think the Rogers Court\ndisagreed with that too, because after Rogers this Court\nupheld in Inman a case on a directed verdict where it\nconcluded after the Rogers instructions had been used\nthat nonetheless the negligence of the railroad had not\nplayed a part. That's a case involving a drunk driver\nwho hit a flag man at the site of where the flag man was\noperating.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I -- can I go back a\nsecond and perhaps follow up Justice Scalia's question\nin a slightly different way? Do you believe a railroad\ncan be held liable for a harm it could not reasonably\nforesee?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. Now,\nperhaps, we can get to why, under what formulation, if\nit didn't know harm was going to happen or could happen.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Reasonably foreseeable.\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes. I think that the\nconcept of foreseeability is one that has alternated in\nand out of this Court's cases, but let's take the case\nof Gallick in 1963, where a fetid pool with vermin and\nrats were allowed to live by the railroad's negligence,\nand it was believed that an insect was growing -- insect\nbodies were growing in that fetid pool, and as a result\nof that insect bite, the injured worker's legs had to be\namputated by the effect of this insect bite.\nNow, many people would argue -- in fact, the\nlower court had concluded -- that it was not reasonably\nforeseeable that the railroad's negligence in allowing\nthat stagnant pool to exist would nonetheless lead to\nthe injury sustained by the worker.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It might not be\nreasonably foreseeable that an amputation would occur,\nbut it was reasonably foreseeable that some injury to\npeople would happen as a result of these infected insect\nbites, no? That's what the court ultimately said.\nMR. FREDERICK: That's correct. But what\nthe court had also done was to rely on earlier cases in\nwhich it's saying these concepts really are relaxed\nbecause the purpose of FELA is to provide a substitute,\nif you will, for workers' compensation, where if you can\nestablish negligence on the part of the railroad and it\ncauses, in part, the injury, the railroad will be liable\nfor that.\nAnd that's why this -- these concepts of\nproximate cause really are getting at a different\nproblem, which is that when these statutes are enacted,\nyou're trying to guard the defendant's liability against\nthe entire world. And that's why it makes sense to\nimpose some kind of restriction for foreseeability or\nfor directness, because otherwise anybody could be\nliable to anybody else. Here, that problem is removed,\nbecause the railroad is the only -- can only be sued,\nunder FELA, by the employee, and only if its negligence\nplays a role in producing that injury.\nIf I could go back to the words that\nMr. Rothfeld's trial counsel had proposed, the \"probable\nsequence\" word is now not even used anymore in Illinois.\nSo it would be very odd to think that you would reverse\nan instruction here, where the proffered instruction by\nthe railroad doesn't even State what -- the proximate\ncause instruction in the model language.\nNow the model language under Illinois calls\nfor the natural and ordinary course of events. That's\nhow proximate cause is now done under the Illinois\nproposed instructions. And it's hard to know how that\nlanguage, Mr. Chief Justice, takes us any different from\nthe common instruction that all juries are given, to use\ntheir common experience and their common sense in\nevaluating the evidence. If what proximate cause now\nmeans under these types of standards is the ordinary\ncourse of events, all we're doing is asking juries to\napply their common sense without introducing the word\n\"proximate cause,\" which has been demonstrated to\nconfuse juries because most of them, you know, many\nthink that \"proximate\" means something like estimate\nor -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If the other side doesn't\ninsist on that, the other side -- we'll give you that\none.\nMR. FREDERICK: And we're delighted with\nthat concession, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, suppose a\njuror says, We wouldn't -- goes to the judge and says,\nWe would like to have an explanation of, what does it\nmean that the injury results in whole or in part from\nthe railroad's negligence? What would the judge\nrespond?\nMR. FREDERICK: Justice Ginsburg, I'm not\nentirely sure how a trial judge would take a request for\nfurther clarification of this word's -- this Court's\nwords that clarify the \"resulting in whole or in part\nfrom.\" I'm not aware of any cases where anyone\nchallenged the use of the Rogers language on the ground\nthat it wasn't simple and direct and therefore couldn't\nbe understood.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, this jury found it,\nthough. What -- what would you tell the jury?\nMR. FREDERICK: I beg your pardon?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This jury found it unclear\nand asks you. What would you say?\nMR. FREDERICK: I think -- and I've never\nserved as a trial judge, but I think my -- my direction\nwould be to go back and try again based on the words\nthat are there, because the whole idea behind these\nwords was to try to end the debate between this Court\nand many State courts that simply didn't grasp that FELA\nwas intended to provide a remedial statute with a\ncausation element that was a weaker causation element\nthan in normal negligence cases. And so this Court was\ntaking dozens of cases under FELA between the 1930's and\nthe 1950's in which the Court was looking at directed\nverdicts by State supreme courts that were overturning\njury verdicts. And the whole idea behind making this\nthe language of what constitutes a jury case was to\nremove the appellate review process from a lot of these\nthings and to leave these questions up to the common\nsense of the jury.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what if the jury says,\nWell, does it mean that but for the negligence, the\ninjury would not have occurred? Then what would the\ntrial judge say?\nMR. FREDERICK: If the jury asked a\nquestion, I think the judge would write back and say,\nNo, that's not correct, the words -- please focus on the\nwords: The negligence playing a part, however small, in\nproducing the injury. I mean, I'm not aware if juries\nget to this but for versus what is a relaxed -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You think that eliminates\nbut-for cause, to tell them that negligence plays a\npart, no matter how small, in the injury? You think\nthat eliminates but-for, rather than invites it?\nMR. FREDERICK: No, Justice Scalia, our\nposition is that it is but-for plus a relaxed form of\nlegal cause that's been well-recognized in the cases and\nhasn't produced a problem. Surely the burden is on the\nrailroad to come up -- I would have thought that if they\nwanted to overturn the pattern instructions that have\nbeen used in nearly a half a million cases since Rogers\nwas handed down, that they would have more than a case\nthat they cite from one of their amici. I mean, they\ndon't even cite the Richards case in their main briefs.\nAnd so surely -- you know, we're here to\ndebate these hypotheticals, I would suppose, but they\ndon't have any relation to the real world.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Suppose the jury asks, Is it\nsufficient, is it necessary for the injury to be\nforeseeable? What does the trial judge say then?\nMR. FREDERICK: I think the trial judge\nsays, No, it is not necessary for it to be foreseeable\nin a direct -- if the negligence plays a part, however\nsmall, in producing the injury.\nAnd that's why in cases like the Ferguson\ncase, which was decided the same day as Rogers -- I\nmean, that's a very out-there set of facts, where the\nship steward -- and remember, what you decide here also\napplies in the Jones Act for sea workers as well. But\nin that case, the Court said it was a jury question,\nwhether the failure to provide an appropriate to\nimplement to scoop hardened ice cream from the freezer\non the ship was foreseeable, whether or not the ship's\nsteward, in serving the ice cream, would reach for a\nbutcher knife to try to chip away and lead to the\nsevering of two of his fingers.\nI mean, we're talking about a dangerous\nsituation, Justice Alito. At the time that FELA was\nenacted, in a year prior to that, some 12,000 people\ndied and there were hundreds of thousands of injuries,\nand the idea behind the statute was to provide a broad\nremedy so that rail workers could be compensated, not\nget extra damages like punitive damages, but just\ncompensated for their injuries. And so the result is\nthat railmen know they're going to have to go before\njuries exercising their common sense, and juries have,\nin many, many cases, ruled in favor of the railroads.\nAnd that system ought to be allowed to continue.\nIf I could go back to one last point, and\nthat is the idea of statutory stare decisis. We believe\nthat because Rogers construed the \"in whole or in part\"\nlanguage, it's entitled to statutory stare decisis where\njury instructions have used that language.\nAnd at some level, this case is not too far\nfrom the Hylton case, which was decided in the early\n'90s, except the difference is in Hylton, the Court had\ndealt with a case from the early 1960s called Parden.\nAnd that case had had many of the underpinnings of -- of\nthe question there that had been discredited or undercut\nby subsequent decisions.\nHere, there are no cases since Rogers that\nsuggest doubt on the general validity of the Rogers\nrule. You have the cases that were decided in the\nimmediate proximity of Rogers; you have Gallick in\n1963 -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: We have three justices of\nthis Court that say Rogers is irrelevant because it had\nto do only with multiple causes.\nMR. FREDERICK: And my answer to that,\nJustice Ginsburg, is that after Rogers, the Court\napplied the Rogers language to single cause cases. We\nhave Webb, we have Ferguson, we have Kernan, we have\nGallick, we have the statement in Crane that comparing\nthe actions of the nonemployee, the -- the explanation\nfor why the nonemployee has to go to common law is\nbecause there are these special features of FELA, one of\nwhich is no common law proximate cause and the\nelimination of contributory negligence and assumption of\nthe risk.\nAnd then subsequently when the Court in\nAyers and then in Gottshall says very clearly these are\nways that FELA has departed from the common law and from\nthe other statutes, in Gottshall the Court was very\nclear that it is relaxed causation and that this is one\nof the departures from normal common law standards. It\nwould seem odd to hold now that all of a sudden we're\ngoing to talk about common law standards for causation\nwhere the Court over a series of decision over the last\nhundred years has knocked out six of the prevailing\nversions of proximate cause that were then in vogue.\nThat would be a very odd way to -- to rule.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Frederick, go back\nagain and tell me what a -- what a judge would say to a\njury so he or she doesn't say but-for is not, not using\nthose words, tell me in simple, plain language how a\njudge differentiates to a jury the difference between\nbut-for and this causation. What would a judge say?\nMR. FREDERICK: Okay, I would start with the\nlanguage in Rogers, and then I would say -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The -- that negligence\nplayed a part in the injury?\nMR. FREDERICK: Right. In producing -\nproducing the injury.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Producing the injury?\nMR. FREDERICK: That's correct. And that\npart of that played a part -- you know, rests on the\ncommon sense of whether or not a jury thinks that a\nparticularly improbable set of -- of events is something\nthat would be within the common experience of someone to\nview as -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It sounds like\nforeseeability you're talking.\nMR. FREDERICK: It's a relaxed form of\nforeseeability in much the same way.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said no\nforeseeability?\nMR. FREDERICK: What I said was that this\nCourt's cases go back and forth on the idea of\nforeseeability and whether or not it's necessary.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you want to go back or\nforth? Which do you want?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FREDERICK: I think it's foreseeable\nhere in this case that using the wrong equipment with\nthe wrong training would produce an injury like the one\nthat my client suffered. And so I would stand on that\nbasis, and I would further stand on the ground that this\nCourt -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, at -- at -- at least\nthat, it seems to me, is a jury question.\nMR. FREDERICK: That's right, Justice\nKennedy, and the jury here applied the statute the way\nit was intended. It found fault with my client, and it\nfound fault with the railroad and it apportioned damages\naccordingly.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but -- but it was\nnot instructed on foreseeability?\nMR. FREDERICK: And they didn't ask for a\nforeseeability instruction. So, you know, reversing\nwhen -- when they haven't asked for the correct\nstatement of the law is not something this Court\nordinarily does.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Wasn't Mr. -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They -- they -- they did\nask for proximate cause?\nMR. FREDERICK: They defined proximate cause\nby saying natural or probable sequence, Justice\nGinsburg. That's how proximate cause was defined in\ntheir words, and the way they defined it didn't include\nthe word \"foreseeability.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That sounds like a good\ndefinition of foreseeable, doesn't it? It's natural and\nprobable.\nMR. FREDERICK: Probable, though, doesn't -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could something be natural\nand probable and not foreseeable?\nMR. FREDERICK: Justice Scalia, the word\n\"probable\" is more likely than not, which is the\nstronger standard, it's intention with the words \"in\npart\" in the statute. Result in part is not something\nthat is more likely than not. For that reason, we\nbelieve the Court should adhere to the Rogers approach.\nIt's worked, it's allowed juries to exercise their\ncommon sense without being confused by these elusive\nproximate cause formulations.\nThe other side has failed to identify a\nproblem, and there's not the slightest reason to think\nthat any alternative formulation would work any better.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could I just ask you this\nfactual question? Was it Mr. McBride's theory that his\ninjury resulted from the repetitive use of the\nindependent brake or was it that the -- as a result of\nthe repetitive use his hand fell down and it hit the\nindependent brake, and that was the cause of the injury?\nMR. FREDERICK: I think it's -- both\ntheories were presented, and they were both based on the\nimproper equipment that he was asked to use and his\nimproper -- improper training he had been given, which\nare classic jury questions concerning negligence and\ncausation.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Rothfeld, you have 4 minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ROTHFELD: Thank you, Your Honor, just a\nfew quick points. First, although my friend Mr.\nFrederick has struggled valiantly, I think that he is\nunable to explain how his test is any different from a\n\"but for\" causation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How about eggshell skull?\nMR. ROTHFELD: That is a different kind of\nproblem.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It is not foreseeable.\nMR. ROTHFELD: It has been -- the rule of\ncommon law from -\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're just saying, it's\nall foreseeable, not foreseeable.\nMR. ROTHFELD: No. The question is whether\nor not the kind of -- the risk of -- that there would be\nan injury follows from the -- the nature of the\nmisconduct that gives rise to liability in the first\nplace, and it is -- common law has always recognized\nthat if you're risking a particular kind of injury, that\nsomeone is going to be hit, you take your victim as your\nfind them, and that is put -- put in a different basket\nof -- of doctrine altogether.\nSo -- so first, again I -- there is no\nalternative to proximate cause, but \"but for\" cause;\nthat's been universally recognized as an unacceptable\nbasis for liability.\nSecond, if I could return to our snake just\nfor a moment. It has been recognized that the -- the\nnature of the protection that's provided by the tort law\nis related to the -- to the risk of injury that gives\nrise to liability in the first place. If there -- the\nrisk of injury is that a defective brake is going to\nlead to a derailment or an accident, injury that follows\nfrom that risk is compensable; injury that does not,\nlike walking along and turning your leg or being bitten\nby a snake is in a different category, it's not\npredictable and foreseeable or natural in that sense.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why not, if you know\nthat there are snakes along this route, just like\nthere's an infected vermin or insects or something else?\nI -\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, the question would be\none for the jury if it's properly instructed. And in\nfact in the Gallick case, as I think Justice Sotomayor,\nyou -- you have recognized, the Court said that that was\nforeseeable. And the jury -- the issue can be posed to\nthe jury, the jury can determine whether it is a natural\nproblem.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it's not that it's a\nmatter of law?\nMR. ROTHFELD: No. That -- that's right,\nthat's right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: A matter of law, there\nwas -- there could be no proximate cause. You're\narguing that a jury should determine whether or not they\ncould anticipate somebody slipping on a slope?\nMR. ROTHFELD: That -- that's generally\nright. I mean, there will be circumstances, as the\nrestatement says, that -- in which it's so clear that it\nis not a -- a probable, natural, foreseeable consequence\nof -- of the wrongful conduct, that it should not go to\nthe jury. And -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't -- isn't Mr. Frederick\nright in saying that asking whether something is\nprobable is very different from asking whether it's\nforeseeable?\nMR. ROTHFELD: They -- clearly they are\nclosely related. I mean the Court in Brady stated\nthat -- that test, as natural, probable, foreseeable.\nIf it is natural and probable, it is likely to be\nforeseeable. And -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if it's probable it's\nforeseeable, but it can be foreseeable even though it's\nnot probable.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, it -- but I think what\nprobable means in this context it has to be foreseeable,\nnot simply in the theoretical, I can foresee if I drive\ntoo fast in New York, maybe there will be a lightning\nstrike -- I mean, I can imagine that. But it has to\nhave -- pass a certain threshold to -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If that's true, that -\neverything that's natural and probable is foreseeable,\nbut not everything that's foreseeable is natural and\nprobable, you were requesting a jury instruction that\ndidn't go as far to help you as was possible, but you\nwere still requesting a jury instruction that was on the\nroad.\nMR. ROTHFELD: That's -- to me the only\nquestion now here before this Court is whether we are\nentitled to a jury instruction that states properly the\nnature of the proximate cause test, and if the case goes\nback under that standard, then the arguments that have\nbeen suggested by Mr. Frederick can be presented to the\njury. But -- but as you say, Justice Scalia, that's\nright; and to the extent that there was anything wrong\nwith the instruction, we would provide it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This case go to the jury?\nMR. ROTHFELD: I think it would be open to\nargue that it's so clear that -- that there was no\nproximate cause that it shouldn't; but that's a question\nto be posed on remand.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I'm sorry, Mr. Rothfeld, I\ndidn't understand what you just said, because the\nrequested jury instruction that -- that you gave was any\ncause which in natural or probable sequence produced the\ninjury. Is that right?\nMR. ROTHFELD: That was the requested\ninstruction.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So that's essentially saying\nthat the jury has to say it's 51 percent likely to\nproduce the injury, isn't that right?\nMR. ROTHFELD: I -- it was not put in those\nterms. I -- I would not think -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, it says natural or\nprobable, and probable means more likely than not, which\nis 51 percent.\nMR. ROTHFELD: I -- again, it was not -\nunpacking those terms, and I would say it does not have\nto be -- the answer is -- is no. The jury doesn't\ndefine that it is -- it is necessarily going to be the\noutcome, but it has to find that there is some\nsubstantial probability that it will be the outcome,\nbefore liability can attach, would be our -- our\nsubmission.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
