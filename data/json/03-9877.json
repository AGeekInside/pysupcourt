        "content": "(11:00 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in No. 03-9877, Jon Cutter v. Reginald Wilkinson.\nMr. Clement.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT UNITED STATES\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWhen the government acts to remove government-\nimposed burdens on religious exercise, it does not violate\nthe Establishment Clause. Rather, as this Court put the\npoint in Zorach against Clauson, when the government eases\nthose kind of burdens, it follows the best of our\ntraditions.\nThe Religious Land Use and Institutionalized\nPersons Act, or RLUIPA, eases government burdens on\nrestrictions by having institutions and prison officials\nexamine burdens on religious exercise and remove\nunjustified, substantial burdens.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But, you know, when\nyou say it eases burdens, it doesn't just ease burdens\nimposed by the Federal Government. It eases burdens\nimposed by State governments.\nMR. CLEMENT: That's exactly right, Mr. Chief\nJustice, but I think that -- that that doesn't make any\nsubstantial difference, in part, I think because if you\nthink about certainly this application of RLUIPA, it's\nSpending Clause legislation. And spending legislation\noften takes the form of giving the States an incentive to\ntake action on their own. And in this sense, I think you\ncan understand this legislation as giving the States an\nopportunity to remove their own burdens on religious\nexercise. And that's precisely how it works in practice.\nThe relevant action that a State takes is State action in\nremoving its own burdens, not Federal action imposed on\nthe States.\nAnd I think that's consistent with the analysis\nof this Court in the Dole case where the Federal\nGovernment, on the assumption of this Court, didn't have\nthe direct power under the 21st Amendment to raise the\ndrinking age, but it could give the option to the States\nto exercise their power to do it. So I do think in the\nend, the burdens that are removed here are attributable to\nthe State of Ohio, not to the Federal Government.\nIt is also true that the standard that's imposed\nby RLUIPA is a more exacting standard than that imposed by\nthe Federal Constitution itself. But I don't think\nproviding for greater accommodation of religious exercise\nthan the Federal Constitution creates an Establishment\nClause problem.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But in -- in the City\nof Boerne, didn't we say that Congress couldn't come in\nand simply rewrite some part of the Constitution to make\nit read differently than we had?\nMR. CLEMENT: Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice, but\nI don't think this case poses the same problems as City of\nBoerne. First of all, this really isn't an effort to\nrewrite a rule of decision for all cases the way that RFRA\nwas. Congress in this legislation targeted two areas\nwhere there were particular problems with respect to\nreligious exercise, and in those contexts, it addressed a\ndifferent standard.\nNow, as I say, that standard is higher, but so\nare the standards of over half of the States which also\napply a heightened scrutiny test either as a matter of\nState constitutional law or State law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, RFRA didn't involve a --\na limitation to situations in which Federal funds were\ninvolved, and as I understand this statute does.\nMR. CLEMENT: That is also true. I mean, there\n-- there is -- to be sure there is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: More than also. I -- that\nseems to me the principal difference between this and\nRFRA.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I take your point, Justice\nScalia. I would -- I would clarify that there is the\npotential for applications to the statute under the\nCommerce Clause. We don't think that's really\nappropriately presented here. We also think that with\nrespect to State prisons in all their applications, they\nwill be Spending Clause applications.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that -- what you're saying\nis academic because the statute doesn't require a Federal\nspending hook. It says it has the other commerce peg. I\ntake it you -- you gave a pragmatic answer to that, that\nevery State in fact gets Federal funds for their prison\nsystems.\nMR. CLEMENT: That's right, Justice Ginsburg,\nand I think the fact that there may be more than one hook\nfor this legislation in certain applications shouldn't\nmake any constitutional difference. And I think here it\nis Spending Clause legislation as it applies to the State\nof Ohio. I think that's conceded. They -- they take\nissue with whether it's valid.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. Clement, it seems to\nme the Spending Clause aspect cuts in the other direction,\nif we're just focusing on the Establishment Clause. The\nfact that Federal money is involved, why does that make\nyour burden any less in defending the -- the statute under\nthe Establishment Clause?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Stevens, I don't\nthink the fact that there's money involved makes it harder\nor easier from a Spending Clause perspective. I think\nfrom the perspective of why this case is different from\nBoerne, the fact that it's Spending Clause and Commerce\nClause and not section 5 legislation makes a big\ndifference. But I certainly don't want to leave you with\nthe impression that there's anything constitutionally\nproblematic because there's Federal money involved\nbecause, of course, this Court has upheld Federal Spending\nClause legislation in religion areas in cases like\nZobrest, Mergens, Agostini, Mitchell against Helms.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you -- do you think the\nEstablishment Clause issue in this case would be the same\nas the Establishment Clause issue in City of Boerne if we\n-- if the Court had reached the Establishment Clause issue\nin that case?\nMR. CLEMENT: No, I don't, Justice Stevens. Or\nanother way of answering that is I would say that even\nthough you thought there was an Establishment Clause\nproblem in the City of Boerne case, I don't think you need\nto find one here. And part of that is because this is\nmore targeted legislation, and it particularly deals, as\n-- as it comes to this Court in this application, with the\nexercise of religion in prisons. And I think that's an\narea like the military where the Government is necessarily\ngoing to be involved with religion in a way that it\notherwise wouldn't be.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And yet, it -- it provides an\nunusual framework or incentive, if you will, in the prison\ncontext to get religion. If you can find some religious\ngroup that espouses drinking beer every day or other\nalcoholic beverages or taking certain amounts of marijuana\nor no telling what or having certain clothing or other\nthings that would alter the conditions of the prison\nenvironment, there's a real incentive here to get\nreligion.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And the --\nMR. CLEMENT: Justice O'Connor --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- Federal Government seems\nto be trying to provide those incentives. Is that a\nproblem?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice O'Connor, I don't\nthink upon analysis it is, and I think there's a couple of\nreasons why that's so.\nFirst of all, this is not an absolute\nentitlement to get your religious beer at 5:00 p.m. every\nday. It is a balancing test, and I think things like\ngetting beer every day, getting marijuana inside prison\nwalls would not satisfy the test.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, the -- the language of\nthe statute is pretty strong: unless the government\ndemonstrates that the imposition is the least restrictive\nmeans and in furtherance of a compelling legislative\ninterest. It puts quite a burden on the State.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, it does, Justice O'Connor,\nbut just to take a step back, I mean, applying that same\nstandard in the Smith case, you yourself thought that a\ngeneral law banning marijuana use outside or -- or peyote\nuse outside --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, I think it was.\nMR. CLEMENT: -- peyote outside of prison would\nbe justified even under that standard. I would think, a\nfortiori, it would be justified within prison walls.\nI want to make another point about the\nincentives, though, which I think is important. Every\nState in the Union provides some degree of accommodation\nfor religion, and in many States it's majoritarian\nreligions that are accommodated. Now, if there's going to\nbe some incentive to engage in religiosity in prison in\norder to take advantage of things offered for religion\nthat aren't available for something else, at least RLUIPA\nhas the virtue of making sure that all religions are\naccommodated neutrally. So if there's any incentive, it's\nan incentive for religion over irreligion as opposed to\nbetween sects -- sects of religions, and I think that's\nthe way you would have without RLUIPA involved.\nThe other point I want to make is although there\nmay be some extravagant claims of certain religions that\nwould seem quite enticing, much religious exercise in many\nof the reported cases involve things that I don't think\npeople are necessarily lining up to do. I mean, there are\na number of lower court cases dealing with the\navailability of kosher food, and in prison what that means\nas a practical matter, is generally you are going to get\ncold food rather than hot food. And I don't think --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about garb that is said\nto be associated with the religion but also is used as a\ncue for gang membership? Let's say a beard. This\nreligion requires me to wear a beard.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think --\nand we cite a few cases in footnote 2 of our reply brief\nthat suggest that in dealing with legitimate concerns\nabout using prison -- religious symbols or other religious\nitems as a gang signifier or a gang identifier, that the\n-- that there have been cases where the courts, even\napplying the heightened standard or RLUIPA or RFRA, have\ndeferred to the government officials.\nI also think, though, it's worth noting how the\nFederal Government and the Bureau of Prisons has dealt\nwith the concern that religious medallions, as opposed to\nbeards, would be used for gang identification or gang\nsignification. Ohio, I take it, takes the position that\nif you have a medallion that could be used for those\npurposes, you can't have it within prison walls at all.\nThe Bureau of Prisons, by contrast, takes the position\nthat you can have the medallion, but you have to wear it\ninside your shirt. So it can't be used for prison\nsignification purposes or gang identification purposes.\nAnd I think that shows the kind of reasonable\naccommodation that RLUIPA or RFRA, as it applies to the\nFederal Bureau of Prisons --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- what about a religion\nthat it's a genuine tenet of the religion that the races\nare to be separated and the person says, the accommodation\nI want is never to be celled with someone who is not of my\nrace?\nMR. CLEMENT: I think in a case like that -- I\nmean, obviously, this Court's recent decision in Johnson\nwould suggest that -- that the prison officials are in a\ndifficult position there and I think they could not accede\nto that request. And I think complying with the Equal\nProtection Clause in that context would itself be a\ncompelling interest under the statute. And I think this\nCourt in Widmar against Vincent, for example, suggested\nthat avoiding Establishment Clause problems is a\nsufficient compelling interest. I would think equally\navoiding the Equal Protection Clause violation in that\ncontext would also be a compelling interest, and I don't\nthink there would be a least restrictive alternative. And\nso I think that the statute -- there would be no statutory\nviolation in refusing that particular accommodation.\nI think there -- these show that there are ways\nto administer this statute in a way that's respectful of\nthe decisions of local prison officials but also does make\nsure that they have a degree of sensitivity to these\nclaims for religious exercise.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Does it -- does the statute\nrequire the prison officials to evaluate the bona fides of\nthe particular religion that's espoused? Isn't one of the\ngroups here a Satanist group? So the religion -- the bona\nfides of the group have to be reviewed by the prison\nauthorities.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice O'Connor, no more so\nthan under the Free -- the Free Exercise Clause itself. I\nmean -- and as this case, of course, comes to this Court,\nthe substantiality of the religious beliefs and that they\nare actually held by these individuals has been stipulated\nto.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: We don't have to decide it\nhere, but it's looming. And when it goes back, if it\ndoes, that will have to be resolved in this and in every\ncase.\nMR. CLEMENT: That's right, Justice O'Connor,\nbut that's true under the Free Exercise Clause as well.\nSo even the Sixth Circuit, that obviously had some\nproblems with the statute, understood that on that score\nthere's no more entanglement with religion under RLUIPA\nthan there is under the Free Exercise Clause itself.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Haven't we said in at\nleast one of our cases that the government can't favor\nreligion over irreligion?\nMR. CLEMENT: That's right, Mr. Chief Justice,\nbut this Court has been clear in the context of\nlegislative accommodations of religion in particular to\nmake clear that that preference of religion over\nirreligion doesn't mean that the government cannot provide\nlegislative accommodations of religion without providing\nbenefits for secular organizations as well. That was the\nclear holding of this Court in Amos.\nAnd I think that although this Court has\nexpressed concerns about religious accommodations when\nthere's no guarantee that the religious accommodation will\nbe provided to other sects -- take, for example, the\nKiryas Joel case. This Court has been quite clear that\nthere is not a constitutional problem in favoring religion\nover irreligion in providing legislative accommodations\nfor religion.\nAnd as I said, in -- in Zorach against Clauson,\nthis Court noted that that's not just the absence of a\nconstitutional problem, but there's really a\nconstitutional virtue in the legislature acting to\naccommodate religion. The Court made basically the same\npoint in Smith in saying that even though the Free\nExercise Clause did not require the special accommodation\nor exemption for peyote, the legislatures could do so and\nin doing so, they would be furthering constitutional\nvalues.\nIf I could say a few words about the Spending\nClause claim that is brought by Ohio in this case. They\nsuggest that there's a difficulty with this legislation\nunder the Spending Clause. Now, the court below --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Is that before us on\nthe questions presented?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I think it is not in the\nquestions presented themselves, I don't think, but I think\nit would be fairly open to this Court to reach it because\nit would be an alternative ground to support the judgment\nbelow. That said, this Court doesn't have to reach it and\nits practice in recent cases has been when there's one\nconstitutional claim that is -- that the Court has ruled\non below, it doesn't necessarily reach the other -- the\nother constitutional claims. The Court did that in cases\nlike Oakland Cannabis and the Pierce County case.\nAnd we would urge the same course here because,\nalthough the courts have divided on this Establishment\nClause issue, the courts have not divided on the Spending\nClause issue. All the courts that have reached it have\nupheld it as valid Spending Clause legislation.\nAnd I think that reflects the fact that there is\na clear nexus here between the Federal funds and the\nFederal conditions that are being imposed. If the Federal\nGovernment is going to provide money, over $1 million to\nOhio, to have prisoner meals, then certainly the Federal\nGovernment can insist that kosher meals are among the\navailable options. And so too if the -- if the Federal\nGovernment is going to provide monies for Ohio to build\nprisons, they can ensure that those prisons are safe and\nare operated consistent with Federal policy such that\nthere's not discrimination on the basis of race or\nreligion.\nThe last issue in the case, of course, is the\nCommerce Clause issue, and on that issue, no court below\nreached the issue. And we think this Court's recent\nadmonition in the Sabri case that facial challenges are\nbest when infrequent, applies with particular force here\nbecause --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- I don't understand,\nMr. Clement, how your second point strengthens your first\npoint. That is to say, if we disagree with your first\npoint, namely that the institutionalized persons\nprovisions are consistent with the Establishment Clause,\nwe think that they contradict the Establishment Clause,\nthey couldn't possibly be saved by your second point. Can\nyou require as a -- as a condition of -- under the\nSpending Clause that a State violate the Establishment\nClause?\nMR. CLEMENT: No, of course not, Justice Scalia,\nand I must have misspoke. My point is they raise three\narguments that are all alternative arguments to support\nthe judgment below. My burden is to defeat all three of\nthem to show -- if the Court reaches them. So I have to\nshow that there's no Establishment Clause violation, which\nwe -- we've certainly made that argument in the brief and\nhere today, and that there's no Spending Clause violation,\nand that there's no Commerce Clause violation.\nThe -- in this case the Commerce Clause claim\nhas a completely abstract quality, and indeed, the only\ntemptation to reach the issue at all would be that the --\nsince RLUIPA has a jurisdictional element, the resolution\nof the Commerce Clause is so clear that it might be\ntempting to reach it. But I think the better course would\nbe for this Court to allow that issue to be sorted out in\nthe --in the lower courts.\nIf there are no further questions, I would\nreserve time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nClement.\nMr. Goldberger, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID GOLDBERGER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. GOLDBERGER: Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist,\nand may it please the Court:\nThis case comes before the Court on a motion to\ndismiss, and the facts, the underlying facts, involving\nthe motion to dismiss are in dispute, and it's a serious\ndispute. And those should be reserved for -- for the\ncourt below, in particular the claims that our clients'\nreligions are affiliated with gang activities, but there\nare serious disputes about that. There is a Wicca\nchaplain that's been hired by the Department of\nCorrections in Wisconsin. Two of my former students, who\nare upstanding members of the bar in every respect, are\nAsatrus, so that these are matters that should be\npreserved for the court below.\nThis Court has made -- asked many questions\nabout the accommodation of religion, and the suggestion\nis, well, isn't there favoritism? Doesn't it encourage\nfavoritism one way or the other? But the answer to each\nof those questions is the same with respect to the current\naccommodations already provided by the Ohio Department of\nCorrections with respect to mainstream religions, and in\nfact, we believe on remand, we will be able to show that\nthere is a preference for accommodating mainstream\nreligions as opposed to non-mainstream religions.\nSimilarly, there has -- there are -- there have\nbeen questions by this Court that -- that the standard\nimposed on the State of Ohio by RLUIPA is this\nparticularly difficult or tortuous standard. In fact,\nunder State law in Humphrey v. Lane, which is cited in our\nbrief, the State of Ohio Supreme Court has already imposed\na similar standard with regard to the religious\naccommodation claims of prison guards.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is Satanism a non-mainstream\nreligion?\nMR. GOLDBERGER: With all due respect, Your\nHonor, I understand that there is some uncomfortable\nfeeling about the nature of my clients' religion. As the\nCourt will note in a -- a footnote in our brief, it has\nbeen reported in the press that there is an adherent in\nthe Royal Navy of Satanism, and the Royal Navy has agreed\nthat if he's killed in the line of duty that there will be\nreligious rights at the end consistent with his religion\nand, in fact, it amounts to a recognition of his religion.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What does this have to do with\nit? The Royal Navy you say?\nMR. GOLDBERGER: Well, I --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Our Royal Navy?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GOLDBERGER: The answer is yes then. It is\na non-mainstream religion.\nAnd I think that it's important for us to assure\nthat religious groups of all stripes are -- are\naccommodated in the -- in the context --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: To what extent? And I asked\nthe -- the racist -- the religion that says God wanted the\nraces to be separated and the accommodation is do not cell\nme with someone of another race.\nMR. GOLDBERGER: I believe that there is -- it\n-- the statute is pretty clear that if there is a -- if\nit's compelling or requiring the State of Ohio to engage\nin an unconstitutional activity -- and that would be a\nsegregation of the races -- that there's a compelling\njustification -- or a compelling governmental interest in\nnot complying with the statute or saying that the statute\ndoes not apply under these circumstances.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How about racist literature\nbut it's under the aegis of a religious organization? And\nthat -- suppose the prison does not permit, say, a member\nof the Aryan Nation to get that racist literature -- to\nget racist literature but --\nMR. GOLDBERGER: To the extent that there is\nbona fide religious literature that is racist, there are\n-- we believe that the Constitution permits Congress or\nany legislative body to accommodate religion in isolation\nfrom other religious right --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, when you --\nMR. GOLDBERGER: -- fundamental rights.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: When you use the term\nbona fide, you're introducing a new kind of factor. Do\ncourts evaluate the bona fides of someone claiming a\nreligion?\nMR. GOLDBERGER: I believe they -- as a matter\nof course, prison officials have to determine whether\nthere's a good faith request for religious accommodation\nor whether the person is trying to seek something under --\nas a ruse.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I take it we've done that in\nthe conscientious objector cases, United States v. Seeger\nand Gillette.\nMR. GOLDBERGER: That's correct.\nBut to let me finish my -- my answer to Justice\nGinsburg, if -- if this Court is of the view -- or members\nof this Court are of the view that it would be content\ndiscrimination, for example, although we believe that you\ncan accommodate one fundamental right separately from the\nother fundamental rights, then of course, if there were a\nFirst Amendment violation, that too would be a compelling\ngovernmental interest in justifying refusal to apply\nRLUIPA. So that there is no serious problem here. And in\nfact, there is no reported case that any racist literature\nhas ever been permitted in -- into the prisons that we've\nbeen able to find.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the content\ndiscrimination, I take it, would be raised by someone who\nwants to get this for political or psychological\nreasons --\nMR. GOLDBERGER: That's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- you would say, I'm not\nchallenging the right of the -- as a member of this\nreligious sect. I just say, me too.\nMR. GOLDBERGER: Well, as I say, to the extent\nthat that's right, if there were content discrimination\nalong those lines and -- and the Court said that there\ncould not be -- it was the Court's view that it could not\nbe accommodated for religion only, then of course the --\nthen there would be a compelling governmental interest in\navoiding content discrimination. In terms of whether or\nnot there's a compelling justification of dealing with\ninflammatory literature, I don't think that's in dispute\nin this case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I take it\nunderlying Justice Ginsburg's question is -- is the\nconcern that this accommodation is unequal because there\nare other First Amendment rights that are not given the --\nthat are not given the same precedence.\nMR. GOLDBERGER: Well, first of all --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That -- that was at least an\nunderlying concern of her question, and I think it's a\nlegitimate concern.\nMR. GOLDBERGER: Well, as -- as I read Amos,\nAmos says that the accommodation of religion need not\ncome --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but in Amos, the Court\nwas just -- the -- the government was just saying that one\nof its own statutes could be accommodated. This is\nsomething different.\nMR. GOLDBERGER: Well, it's not -- I'm not sure\nthat it's different for constitutional purposes, that if\nthere is a differential accommodation which the Court\nconcludes violates the First Amendment rights of someone\nelse because there's content discrimination, I'm not --\nthere is no reason to treat the source of the\naccommodation as dispositive. It's whether -- it is the\npresence of the accommodation and whether it's broad\nenough or narrow enough.\nOn the other hand, the -- we -- we do want to\nmake clear that there are numerous accommodations that\ninvolve First Amendment rights that do not overlap with --\nwith religious exercise or accommodation of religious\nexercise. To the extent that there is political\ngatherings, they're not entitled under the First Amendment\nto the -- they're not accommodated in the same way that\nreligious congregations in prison are accommodated. And\nthis Court so far has found there to be no constitutional\nviolation for that distinction. And to the extent that\nthere's a compelling governmental interest, there is\nlittle doubt that the -- that the prison officials can\nsimply say no. This -- we will not accommodate it. We're\nnot required to accommodate it under the statute.\nThe -- it is important to note, that the --\nthese same accommodations are routinely granted to\nmainstream religions and that they do not shift burdens to\nthird parties. There's been substantial argument that\nthere is a substantial shifting of burdens to third\nparties. In fact, where third party claims have been made\nby the State of Ohio was that basically that the cost of\nsecurity is increased because now it takes more -- or the\ncost of prison administration is increased because it\ntakes more time to take care of these claims and requests\nfor accommodation than there would be if they didn't have\nto attend to these --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm -- I'm sorry. You've lost\nme. I don't know what you mean about shifting burdens to\nthird parties. What --\nMR. GOLDBERGER: Well, the argument is that\nwhen, for example, a religious accommodation forces -- and\n-- and -- the third parties to chip in, as they had to do\nin Caldor, for example, private third parties, that that\nrenders the accommodation unconstitutional. And the State\nhas been arguing that the lifting of burdens on the\nreligious exercise of our clients makes it harder for\ntheir prison guards --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nGoldberger.\nMr. Cole, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS R. COLE\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. COLE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nIn prison's unique environment, RLUIPA violates\nthe Constitution. It directly and impermissibly advances\nreligion and it would have to be -- have to be --\nperceived by objective observers as endorsement.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let me ask you this -- this\nquestion because it -- it -- I think it goes to the -- the\nheart of what I think is the problem in this case. If we\nare going to recognize a sphere of accommodation, which we\nhave done previously, I think we have to recognize that\nthe -- that the object of accommodating and the effect of\naccommodating is, in one sense, to benefit -- I mean, in\nan obvious sense, is to benefit religion. By recognizing\na sphere of accommodation, in effect, I think the Court\nhas said there is a sphere in which religion can be\nbenefitted that does not rise necessarily to the level of\ngovernment proselytization or -- or government\nendorsement. And it seems to me that the argument that\nyou're making is that if the government endorses at all,\nit's immediately in -- in the -- the realm of\nestablishment. Am I -- am I missing something in your\nargument?\nMR. COLE: Well, I think you are, Your Honor,\nand if our brief came across that way, I -- I think it\noverstates the line that we're asking this Court to draw.\nThe Court has recognized, in talking about accommodations,\nthat of course accommodations by their very nature benefit\nreligion. That's part of an accommodation and could be\nsaid to have the effect. But the Court has said then we\nmust draw lines. That is, the Court has recognized that\nyou can't just say, oh, it's an accommodation which means\nthat's fine, it's always going to be fine if it's an\naccommodation. In fact, Justice O'Connor said we need to\ndraw lines because otherwise everything will just become,\noh, that's an accommodation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. And -- and why is\nthe line violated here?\nMR. COLE: The line is violated here, Your\nHonor, because of the unique incentives and burdens that\narise in the prison context.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, what the statute\nappears to be doing is to try to go back to the pre-\nEmployment Division v. Smith case standard under the Free\nExercise Clause, which did allow for accommodation of\nreligion. And that appears to be what this statute is\ndesigned to do.\nMR. COLE: But in -- in prison's unique\nenvironment, Your Honor, where there are so many\ndeprivations of liberty and then to say the one -- one way\nyou can get out from under the thumb of all these prison\nregulations is to claim religion, and that's going to give\nyou a powerful weapon not again to --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But -- but before Employment\nDivision v. Smith, wouldn't we have had the same question\narise in the prison context, and we would have dealt with\nit under the then-standards.\nMR. COLE: But -- but the Court has -- has\nalways articulated that the rules -- well, in Turner and\nO'Lone, the Court articulated that the rules are different\nin prison, citing to the intractable problems of prison\nadministration and the -- and the problems of\nsubjecting --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But had the Court ever said\nthat the Free Exercise Clause couldn't be applied in the\nprison context?\nMR. COLE: No, Your Honor. Going -- going back\nto the Beto case, the Court said free exercise applies in\nprison, but in O'Lone, the Court said it applies in prison\nbut the standard what we're going to use is one that's\nvery similar to -- to rational basis.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Then I think you're\nsaying that in order to exceed what free exercise requires\nin a prison necessarily forces you into establishment.\nAnd I think you're saying the reason it does so is that\nthere are so many incentives on the part of prisoners to\nclaim religion, that that's the only way you can sort of\nkeep the genie in the bottle. Isn't that the -- the\nessence of your argument?\nMR. COLE: We're not asking for that bright line\nrule, Your Honor. It could well be the case that\nproviding kosher meals, for instance, whether that's\nrequired by the Free Exercise Clause or not, it might go\nmarginally beyond what free exercise requires. That's an\naccommodation that would be perfectly legitimate. But to\nhave a rule that says anytime you bring any request of any\nkind for an accommodation from any rule, it's going to be\ntreated differently and better because it's religion --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it -- but -- but that is\nnot what the rule says. Number one, as -- as your brother\non the other side pointed out, there's got to be some\ndetermination made as a threshold matter as to whether\nthis is even a religious claim or -- or whether it's just\ngaming the system. So there's nothing automatic.\nNumber two, if there are, as -- as there\nfrequently will be, in the prison context important\ngovernmental interests which can only be served by denying\nthe -- the request, the request can be denied. And it\nseems to me that if these are not sufficient recognitions\nof the -- of the prison context, then I don't know what\nkind of a rule we can have that would satisfy you except\nto say if it isn't absolutely required by free exercise,\nit is establishment.\nMR. COLE: Well, Your Honor, I don't think we\nneed to go that far. I -- I think we could look at given\ntypes of accommodations and say if a legislative\ndetermination is made that this type of accommodation with\nrespect to this type of request is appropriate, based on a\nbalancing of all the factors to consider in that\nparticular case --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You -- you --\nMR. COLE: -- that might not slide --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You mean specific\naccommodations like you can have kosher foods, you can\nwear a religious medal, you can have a tattoo? I mean,\nyou're -- you're asking the legislature to be that\nspecific.\nMR. COLE: Well, a narrow, targeted -- I guess\nthe point is, Your Honor, a narrow, targeted accommodation\nwould be different in our view than this broad, wonder bus\napproach to accommodation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It -- it would also be rather a\ndiscriminatory one, wouldn't it? I mean, one -- one point\nthat we have got to be concerned about, whether we're\ndealing with accommodation or whether we're dealing with\n-- with flat-out establishment, is distinction among\nreligions. And I think you're saying if they do\ndistinguish among religions, we don't have this problem,\nbut I think that lands you from the frying pan into the\nfire.\nMR. COLE: No, Your Honor, I -- I don't believe\nso because I think if, for instance, the legislature said,\nyou -- you shall, absent some compelling need, provide\nprisoners with a diet that meets their religious\nrequirements, that would not discriminate among religions.\nIt would be narrowly tailored to some perceived problem\nthat might exist.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: A guy comes along in a\ndifferent religion and says, we're omnivorous, but we got\nto -- we got to wear medals. No statute that says medals\nare okay. It -- it -- you know, I realize the level of\ngenerality in your example is higher. The -- the\ndiscrimination is not quite so blatant, but it's a pretty\ntough job to come up with -- would be a tough job to come\nup with statutes without picking and choosing among\nreligious demands.\nMR. COLE: And, Your Honor, we believe that in\nprison's unique environment, to the extent you go beyond\nthe Free Exercise Clause, it raises special problems and\nspecial concerns that need to be dealt with --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why can't they --\nMR. COLE: -- on a case by case basis.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But why can't they be dealt\nwith under the statute as it is written, saying that if\nyou -- if it is a bona fide request, and you, the prison,\ndetermine that in fact you -- you have a compelling State\ninterest that cannot be served in any other way, you can\nsay no? Why is that insufficient and -- and why does that\n-- why is that, therefore, the reason that -- that jumps\nus into an Establishment Clause violation every time?\nMR. COLE: It's insufficient, Your Honor,\nbecause it doesn't change the underlying fact that the\nrequest itself, whatever the ultimate outcome on the\nrequest is, the request itself gets treated differently\nand better merely because it's religious. This is a --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, are you saying that --\nthat a statute is unconstitutional to recognize a\nprisoner's right to free exercise unless it also has a --\na kind of a litany of sections recognizing speech rights,\nrecognizing privacy rights, et cetera?\nMR. COLE: No, Your Honor. I'm -- I'm not\nsuggesting that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then it's got to single out\nreligion.\nMR. COLE: And -- and as the Court noted in\nAmos, these type of statutes are necessarily going to\nsingle out religion, but that doesn't shield them from\nEstablishment Clause scrutiny just because they take the\nform of being directed at religion and providing a benefit\nthat's -- that's labeled as an accommodation.\nI mean, for instance, Congress could say, look,\nwe think it's difficult for State prisoners to practice\ntheir religious beliefs when they can't go to church. So\nabsent some compelling State interest and least\nrestrictive alternatives, the prisons need to arrange to\nrelease prisoners once a week to go to the church or\nsynagogue of their choice. Well, that would provide an\nawfully powerful incentive inside prison walls for\nprisoners to -- to claim religion.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Sure it woul --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So maybe that's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And if you did it under the\nstatute, you would clearly have a reason for saying no.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Cole, are you sure that\nthis statute doesn't go beyond pre-Smith -- our pre-Smith\nlaw? I'm not aware that our pre-Smith law would have\ndefined religious exercise as broadly as this statute\ndefines it. I guess this is something Mr. Clement ought\nto speak to as well. It says, the term religious exercise\nincludes any exercise of religion whether or not compelled\nby or central to a system of religious belief.\nMR. COLE: Thank you, Your Honor. That is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did our prior Smith cases go\nthat far? I'm not aware that --\nMR. COLE: No, they did not, Your Honor, and I\nthink that's an important as well, that once someone has\nan -- a bona fide religion and -- and prison officials can\nchallenge whether this is in fact a religious set of\nbeliefs. But if they have a religious set of beliefs and\nif they are sincere, then you can't challenge this\nparticular request as not being mandated by the religion.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They don't even have to say my\n-- my religion requires me not to eat this food. They\njust say, you know, I'm --\nMR. COLE: For religious reasons, I would prefer\nto do this.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is your argument in\nresponse to Justice Souter? You said it is not the\nfollowing. It is not that the State has to list, along\nwith these religious matters, the Second Amendment, the\nFirst Amendment, et cetera. It's not that. You then seem\nto say that the argument is that a person who files a\npiece of paper and claims to be religious, that they have\nto consider it, and it's impelled only by religion. I\nsuppose the same thing is true of a church that applies\nfor a tax exemption. So I don't think that you could say\nthat automatically that fact that they're going to give\nthe church a tax exemption or that they're going to give\nthe religious person some special consideration, that that\nin and of itself violates the Establishment Clause. Very\nwell. What does?\nMR. COLE: Well, Your Honor, I wish I could draw\na brighter line rule --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. But I just need to know\nwhere you're going --\nMR. COLE: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- generally. I don't need a\nbright line rule. I'm just trying to find out what it is\nabout this that violates the clause if it isn't the first\nthing or the second thing that I mentioned.\nMR. COLE: It's the magnitude by which Congress\nhas enhanced the religious right. That is, we compare\nwhat the Constitution requires State prison officials to\ndo and we say, how far has Congress moved the ball.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fine. Now, in respect to that,\nwe have two points. One was Justice O'Connor's I think,\nwhich is that Congress is not enlarging it, but for my\nsecond qualification, beyond what it would have been if\nSmith had never been decided. And the second is Justice\nScalia's point, which is but there is one respect in which\nCongress did enlarge it, namely, that the right doesn't\nhave -- the belief doesn't have to be central. It could\nbe -- well, he just read that.\nSo is your whole argument then pinned on that\nlatter point? And if it is not, again, what is it?\nMR. COLE: Well, our argument is pinned on this\nCourt's decisions in Turner and O'Lone, which we see as\nestablishing the baseline for what type -- for what the\nConstitution requires in terms of free exercise in prison,\nand then we use that baseline and compare the standard\nimposed there to the standard Congress is seeking to\nimpose through RLUIPA and compare the magnitude of the\ntwo, understanding, as this Court has said in Lemon, that\nlines of demarcation are difficult to perceive. It's\ndifficult to say exactly where that line should be.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're saying if Turner had\ncome up prior to Smith, the Court would have said that\nTurner trumps pre-Smith law, and you don't have to follow\npre-Smith law in the prison.\nMR. COLE: I -- I believe so, Your Honor, given\nprison's unique environment.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I understand --\nMR. COLE: I believe Turner and O'Lone are\nprison cases that talk about what the Constitution means\nin prison, understanding that in prison there need to be\nchanges to what we would otherwise see as the inmates'\nconstitutional rights if they were not in prison.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, I -- I understand the\nargument now, which has been helpful. Very well.\nFrom the prison's point of view, why is it so\nburdensome since you would have thought security is a\ncompelling interest, prison administration is a compelling\ninterest, so that really all we have to do is think about\nthis and look to see whether there isn't some reasonable\nway of accommodating the request?\nMR. COLE: Well, Your Honor, I think that the\nburdens in the prison environment are twofold. First,\nRLUIPA forces prison officials to change the balance they\nwould otherwise strike between safety and accommodation,\nand by changing that balance, changing the margin of\nsafety, if you will, they're now imposing risks on the\nother inmates that are in prison. And these aren't\nmerely --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think -- I think you may\nexaggerate what it takes to establish a compelling State\ninterest. I mean, we -- this -- this Court held in the --\nin the pre-Smith days that it was a compelling State\ninterest to -- to prevent members of the Air Force from\nwearing yarmulkes. I mean, if that's a compelling State\ninterest, I think it's pretty easy to get most anything\ndeclared a -- a compelling State interest under this\nstatute, don't you think?\nMR. COLE: Yes, Your Honor. And compelling\nState interest doesn't present a problem to the State of\nOhio or to the other States that are operating under this\nstatute. What it -- what presents the problem is the\nleast restrictive alternative part of that which subjects\nState prison officials in their day-to-day judgments\nregarding prison operations to a strict scrutiny analysis\non the back end.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that goes beyond pre-Smith\ntoo, doesn't it? Least restrictive alternative.\nMR. COLE: The -- the least restrictive\nalternative, which is what puts the teeth in RLUIPA and\nwhat's -- what creates the problem --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: We now have some experience\nin the Federal system where the same standards apply under\nRFRA. And you are positing this terrible disturbance of\nprison administration in the -- what is it -- 6 years that\n-- that RFRA has been in force for Federal prisons. Have\nthere been -- has there been this terrible disruption?\nHave there been -- have the accommodations required so\nmuch of the prison administrators?\nMR. COLE: Well, the United States claims no,\nYour Honor, of course. But when we look back at the\nexperience of the States with RFRA, before it was declared\nunconstitutional, we presented substantial evidence in the\n-- in the joint appendix with regard to the way in which\nthere was an explosion of demands for accommodations by\nprisoners from previously unheard of religions. There was\nan expansion -- an explosion of claims of conversion\nwithin --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but now that some of\nthat has gotten sorted out through the experience of the\nBureau of Prisons on the Federal side, one would expect\nthere would be less of those far-out claims. The -- you\nwould expect when a statute is new, that there might be\nsome claims that we would recognize as frivolous after\nthere's been experience under it.\nMR. COLE: That's correct, Your Honor, but the\ndifficulty that doesn't seem to go away with the least\nrestrictive alternative test is -- is the possibility, as\nthis Court noted in Turner, that every judgment every day\nis subject to some court somewhere finding that there was\na less restrictive way of achieving the goal. And -- and\nwe see that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: This is true. Now there you're\nin the dilemma. I mean, you're putting yourself there in\nthe same position that virtually every official is in in\nthe United States but for judges who have -- who have to\nworry about the court of appeals. But anyway, the --\nthe --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: You see -- now, the answer to\nthat argument in your case, you're in a vice. They put\nyou in a -- in a kind of pincers because where you have a\ngood argument, they say, well, that doesn't violate the\nstatute, and where your claim is weak, they say, well, it\nshouldn't be a -- it should violate the statute. And the\ndifficulty with being in pincers like that is you can't\nwin. And the virtue of it is you shouldn't win. All\nright. So -- so how do you get out of this -- of the --\nof that kind of an argument?\nMR. COLE: Well, that's not particularly\nencouraging, Your Honor, but --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, but -- your point.\nMR. COLE: Yes, Your Honor. And -- and I guess\nall I can do is go back and compare the accommodation if\nthat's what this is that's at issue here with that that\nwas at issue in Amos to say these employers don't need to\ncomply with this one Federal statute and this one set of\nobligations. And I asked, well, okay, so an employer. Is\nthat going to make IBM switch from being a computer\nmanufacturer to being a religious services provider\nbecause, boy, if we do that, we can get out from\nunderneath title VII's nondiscrimination mandate? I don't\nthink so.\nBut if I look in prison and I say, what is going\nto be the effect on the ground with respect to people\nclaiming religion or converting to religion if I tell them\nthere's going to be a different regulatory regime that\napplies to you --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then why hasn't that been the\neffect on the Federal ground.\nMR. COLE: Your Honor, I -- I don't know that it\nhasn't. I mean, I'm -- I'm surprised in a sense to hear\nthat claim because in brief period in which RFRA did apply\nto State prisons, there was an explosion of these demands.\nAnd -- and I would direct the Court to, I believe it's,\n204, 210, 211, and 212 in the joint appendix to see some\nof the ways in which there's been this impact. I'd\nalso --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'll -- I'll grant you that,\nbut it seems to -- I mean, Justice Ginsburg responded to\nthat by saying that these things get sorted out. At the\nbeginning you get all sorts of loony claims. As time goes\nby, you get fewer of them. And -- and if -- if they\nweren't getting few of them, I would have expected the\nUnited States to make a different representation.\nMR. COLE: Your Honor, I don't know that the\nfact that -- that strict scrutiny might become -- what\nthat means, what that's going to require. And arguably,\nthis is a slightly different strict scrutiny than other\nstrict scrutinies because of some of the legislative\nhistory, to the extent one -- one wants to look at that.\nAnd -- and that's, I guess, the problem. As we\nflesh that out, during that entire time, we're saying it's\nall right to burden other inmates in prisons. It's all\nright to burden prison officials. It's all right for\nCongress not to burden Federal prison officials, but for\nCongress to burden State prison officials with this new\nset of obligations.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I don't know what that's\ngot to -- you know, you may or may not have an argument\nthere, but I don't know what it's got to do with the\nmeaning of the Establishment Clause.\nMR. COLE: Well, Your Honor, the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And they're not burdening you\nanyway -- anyway. Just don't take the money.\nMR. COLE: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It comes with the money.\nMR. COLE: I'm --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't want the burden?\nDon't take the money. I mean, they -- they do that all\nthe time.\nMR. COLE: I'm not sure I agree with that, Your\nHonor, for -- for a couple of reasons. First, this also\npurports to be Commerce Clause legislation, in which case\nit would be a mandate upon the States whether --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What we have before us in this\ncase is -- is a case covered by the -- the Spending\nClause. So we don't have to grapple with the Commerce\nClause for now.\nMR. COLE: But -- but secondly, Your Honor, with\nrespect to the Spending Clause issue, this Court has said\nin Dole that there needs to be relatedness between the\nspending, that if there's going to be strings attached,\nthey actually have to be attached to the Federal money in\nsome meaningful way. And here, Congress is relying on\nspending, most of which has absolutely nothing to do --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But the Sixth Circuit\ndidn't pass on the Spending -- Spending Clause issue.\nMR. COLE: No, they did not, Your Honor, but\nwe --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: And it isn't raised by\nyour opponent's petition.\nMR. COLE: That's -- that's true, Your Honor,\nbut it is available to the Court as an alternate ground of\naffirmance of -- of the decision below.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Yes, if we're looking\nfor that.\nMR. COLE: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was one question\nbrought up about Ohio's own practice. But you -- you say\nwe have no obligation to relieve burdens. If we did, we\nwould violate the Establishment Clause. The point was\nmade that Ohio pays for chaplains, but it doesn't pay for,\nsay, psychologists to come in for agnostics. So aren't\nyou right there violating the Establishment Clause on your\nown theory?\nMR. COLE: I don't believe so, Your Honor,\nbecause our theory isn't that anytime you go beyond what\nfree exercise requires, you're immediately into an\nEstablishment Clause violation. We recognize that there\nis a play in the joints. And providing chaplains, given\nthe -- the rich history and tradition of doing so in\nprisons, seems to fall very comfortably within that play\nin the joints.\nThe question is when have we gone too far. When\nhas our accommodation slid over, as the dissent put it in\nTexas Monthly, into a -- or an impermissible incentive to\npractice religion?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question, Mr.\nCole? I am troubled also, as you point out, about the\nleast restrictive language in the statute. But as I try\nand apply it to this particular case, weren't most of the\nallegations that the petitioners made is that they were\ntreated differently from other mainstream religions and\nthat the accommodation would have been, well, treat them\nthe same, which would have been the least restrictive\nalternative? It wouldn't have created all the problems\nyou describe. And they say they don't -- can't have group\nmeetings. They -- if they were treated exactly the same,\nwould that -- that would satisfy the least restrictive\nalternative part of the statute, wouldn't it? And why\nwould that be such a burden?\nMR. COLE: Your Honor, first, I'm not sure that\ntheir claim is that, oh, we're being treated differently\nand worse. Their claim was we want to get together for\ncongregate religious services or, in Mr. Hampton's case --\nhe was a Wicca -- he wanted certain objects, including a\nquartz crystal that he would be able to keep in his cell.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Don't mainstream religion\nadherents have certain objects they'd like to keep in\ntheir cell?\nMR. COLE: They -- they may well, Your Honor,\nand -- and the point is in each of those cases, prison\nofficials look at the object and say what's the potential\nfor harm here. Should we let them have it in their cell?\nThere's a -- there's a practice in Ohio prisons of --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The mainstream person, if\nthere's a potential for harm, they wouldn't let them keep\nit in the -- in the cell, would they?\nMR. COLE: That's right, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And in other words, is it\nreally -- although the language in the statute seems to go\nfarther, is there anything really at stake here beyond\nsaying treat us the same as you treat mainstream --\nmembers of mainstream religions?\nMR. COLE: Absolutely, Your Honor. Absolutely.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And what is the best example\nof that?\nMR. COLE: There's a -- a request for a prisoner\nwho wants the grooming regulations changed with respect to\nhim. He's a prisoner who's got a history of contraband\nviolations. He's involved in a -- in a prison betting\npool and carries -- tries to carry betting slips and\nsecret them on his person. And so if he could violate the\ngrooming regulations, the concern is he might use that to\nhide contraband. There are prisoners that want to wear\ntheir hair in a certain way to signify gang affiliation,\nand instead, they claim, well, I need this for religious\npurposes, but what's really going on is they want to\nsignify gang affiliation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If you want us to say that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It would seem to me that would\nbe a compelling interest to say you can't do that.\nMR. COLE: Your Honor, again, I'm -- I'm sure\nthere's a compelling interest. The question is the least\nrestrictive alternative. Are we going to be able to meet\nevery Federal judges' view of is this the least\nrestrictive way we could go about achieving this\ncompelling interest? There's no doubt that prison\nsecurity is going to be recognized as a compelling State\ninterest, but the difficulty is the least restrictive\nalternative test.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I suppose you're\nsaying you want us to make the holding that -- one of the\nholdings you'd be satisfied with is that while some\naccommodation is -- is appropriate, this is extreme\naccommodation. What's your best case for that?\nI -- I just can't remember a case in which we've\ntried to ask whether every form a request for\naccommodation has to be acknowledged. Is -- is this the\nonly case that you've come across?\nMR. COLE: Frankly, Your Honor, other than RFRA,\nit's the only time Congress has gone this far. And so to\nsay that there's a lack of case law on this is more to\nsuggest that there's been settled understandings that we\ncan't go this far rather than --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I guess what I'm asking\nis what's the closest analogy you can --\nMR. COLE: In our brief we -- we looked at Lee\nv. Weisman in what the Court called subtle and indirect\ncoercion to religion when it was merely standing for a --\na invocation during graduation once a year. And we\ncontrast that with what's going on here and the constant\npressure day after day, if you want this set of benefits,\nget religion.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about the American Indian\nwho didn't -- or was it -- I think it was an American\nIndian. But -- who didn't want to be known -- it was a\nwoman and she didn't want to known as a number. She\nwanted a name. That was a religious basis. And Social\nSecurity -- I think the Court hold -- didn't have to give\nher that.\nMR. COLE: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So that to me stood for the\nproposition that administrative considerations play an\nimportant role in deciding whether you've hit upon the\nleast restrictive alternative. And as long as that was\nthe law, then you're okay. And that was a Supreme Court\ncase I think. I may be misremembering.\nMR. COLE: Again, Your Honor, it's not that we\ncouldn't potentially win these cases under least\nrestrictive alternative. The question is by changing the\nstandard to that, changing the standard to one in which\nthese prison officials -- I mean, Congress is, in a sense,\nasking Federal judges to sit as overseers of religious\nlife in the prisons across the 50 States. And given what\nthis Court said in Turner, given what this Court said in\nO'Lone about the intractable problems that prison\nofficials face, it just seems an inappropriate task and\none that, if motivated with the desire of increasing\nreligiosity in prison, seems to cross the Establishment --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You're asking us --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why is it -- why is it worse\nfor -- for judges to be overseers of religious life in\nprison than it is for wardens to be overseers of religious\nlife in prison? I mean, somebody has to say what the\nlines are, what will -- what will be accommodated and what\nwon't.\nMR. COLE: Right, and it's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that someone is going to be\na government official. I have no reason to believe that\nwardens are -- are better at it than judges except with\nrespect to, you know, security and administrative\nconvenience, which we will honor under this statute.\nMR. COLE: Except, Your Honor, this Court noted\nin Turner, I believe it was, that the need for judicial\ndeference is particularly strong when you're dealing with\nsituations that create ripple effects in prison. And it's\ndifficult for Federal judges to know. They don't have\nprison management experience. They don't have 20 years on\nthe ground like most prison wardens do to say this -- this\naccommodation will work and this one won't.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And I think that means that\nthey will give great deference to what the -- what the\nwardens of the prisons say is a compelling interest of --\nof the penal system.\nMR. COLE: If they will, it's not in the face of\nthe statute, Your Honor. I mean, it's not in the face of\nthe statute. It says compelling State interest and least\nrestrictive alternative.\nI would just like to note --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you -- can you give me an\nexample? Because most of the things I think of is either\nyou can have kosher food or you cannot. Either you can\nwear a yarmulke or you're not. There's not other --\nanother alternative. Most of these things are yes and no.\nWhat is the case where, well, you can't have this but\nwe'll give you something lesser?\nMR. COLE: Well, I believe Mr. Clement noted\nthat -- that there was a case that held that, okay, you\ncan't wear the medallion on the outside of your shirt, you\ncan wear it on the inside of your shirt. So that would be\na less restrictive alternative for not allowing you to use\nthe medallion, I guess, as a gang identifier. Now, it\ndoesn't really deal with the problem that as soon as the\nguard is not looking, again it can be pulled outside the\nshirt and can be used as a gang identifier.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, maybe if the warden\nsays that, the court would say, fine, you don't have to\naccommodate.\nMR. COLE: Maybe, Your Honor, but -- but the\nquestion is, is it permissible for Congress to create\nincentives for prisoners to say, yes, I'm religious\nbecause I want these other benefits? Can Congress really\nsay, boy, we'd like you to be religious, and the way we're\ngoing to provide that incentive is by giving you a better\nshot at getting out from the rules in prison? It's not a\nguaranteed shot from getting out, but it's a better shot\nat getting out from the rules that apply to everybody else\nin prison and to get that, you have to become religious.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Better shot than -- better shot\nthan what? Better shot than the -- than the Free Exercise\nClause alone would allow?\nMR. COLE: Better shot than --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And aren't you arguing that in\nthe prison context, once you get beyond the free exercise\nline, you are into establishment?\nMR. COLE: Well, and Your Honor, I was not\ncareful there. I should say much better shot. I mean,\nagain, it's this point that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But how do we administer\nit? How does anyone administer that -- that kind of a\ntest?\nMR. COLE: I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It can -- it can be better but\nnot much better?\nMR. COLE: I think by comparing to what's gone\nbefore. In fact, the Court has adopted a version of that\napproach already. In Caldor, the Court said if it's\nunqualified and imposes a burden on others, that's going\nto violate the Establishment Clause.\nI see my time is up, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: It is. Thank you, Mr.\nCole.\nMR. COLE: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Mr. Clement, you have\n4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT UNITED STATES\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nJust a few points in rebuttal.\nFirst of all, I'd like to note the anomaly that\nmuch of the argument of General Cole would be an argument\nfor why the State constitutional provision that gives\nhigher protection for freedom of conscience in Ohio is\nitself unconstitutional.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Why don't you address the\nways in which this act goes beyond our former free\nexercise --\nMR. CLEMENT: I'd be happy to do that, Justice\nO'Connor. I think that there's been an exaggeration of\nhow far it goes beyond. Now, I want to be clear about one\nthing, which is this Court, even before Smith and O'Lone,\nsaid that there was going to be deference to prison\nofficials and a Turner standard would apply. So to the\nextent that there's a little less deference here than\nunder the O'Lone standard, that is a modification.\nThe centrality requirement, though, is not\nsomething that can be charged to RLUIPA or to RFRA because\neven before the Smith case, this Court in Ling and\nHernandez was moving away from centrality and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Also not compelled -- not\ncompelled -- by religion. You just say, you know, I -- I\nwant to give up everything except candy for Lent, and the\n-- the prison has to accommodate you. Right?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not compelled. I -- you\nknow, I could do something else. But I had thought that\nour prior religion cases did -- did, indeed, require some\nreligious compulsion than just I -- you know, I'd like to\ndo this as a religious matter.\nMR. CLEMENT: Justice Scalia, I don't think this\nCourt has ever in its accommodations cases held that the\ngovernment can only accommodate those things that are\ncentral. I don't know for sure, but I rather doubt that\nemploying co-religionists in a gymnasium is central to the\npractice of any faith. Yet, in Amos, this Court upheld\nthat as a valid accommodation.\nAnd I do think the centrality requirement --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: -- the LDS.\nMR. CLEMENT: What's that?\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: I said you may\nunderestimate the LDS.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. CLEMENT: I may, Mr. Chief Justice. But\nagain -- but -- but to the extent I do, I think those are\nquestions that are best to be kept out of the courts,\nwhich is why even before Smith this Court moved away from\ncentrality. It's why even Justice O'Connor, who otherwise\nwas in disagreement in Smith, also agreed that we should\nget rid of the centrality requirement.\nAnd if you look at some of the cases that are\nactually decided under RLUIPA, the cases involve things\nlike Muslim prayer oil and they -- the cases -- the\nSeventh Circuit, for example, allows it. Now, we don't\nwant the courts getting into --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I guess you're right. I think\nI was thinking of free exercise cases rather than\nestablishment cases.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I -- I think that's right,\nand I think there is not that centrality requirement for\naccommodations.\nI do want to make the point, though, that --\nthat Ohio already, under its State constitution, has this\nheightened review with a lot of these, you know, least\nrestrictive alternative tests and the like. Nobody thinks\nOhio's constitution violates the Federal Constitution.\nThat's true even though Ohio applies it in the prison\ncontext, at least when it's a claim by a guard rather than\nan inmate. That -- those are the facts of Humphrey\nagainst Lane.\nIt's also true that many of Ohio's arguments\nwould suggest their own accommodations of some religions\nwould give too much of an incentive for religious exercise\nand the like. And I think that's a defect as well.\nI don't think -- and I agree with Justice Souter\nin this regard -- that narrower accommodations actually\nraise more constitutional problems than broader\naccommodations. I think that this Court, for example, in\nCaldor dealt with an accommodation that was at a fairly\nhigh level of generality, but yet this Court said and\nJustice O'Connor emphasized in her concurrence, well,\nthat's a preference for Sabbatarian religions. And I\nthink you avoid that with this kind of across-the-board\ntest.\nJustice Kennedy, you made a point about whether\nthis is extreme in the degree that it accommodates\nreligion, but it's certainly no more extreme than the --\nthan the laws and constitutions of 26 States, which across\nthe board apply this heightened scrutiny to all manner of\nState actions. So in that sense, the fact that it\naccommodates religion kind of wholesale with a broader\nstandard, as opposed to retail, I don't think is a\nconstitutional defect.\nThe last point I wanted to make is on the racist\nliterature hypothetical, and I think it is in large\nmeasure just a hypothetical. As footnote 2 in our brief\npoints out, prisons have been generally successful in\nkeeping racist literature out even when it's supported as\na claim for religious-based racist literature. The only\ncases that I've come across where that hasn't prevailed is\nwhen the -- the prison's own policy had exceptions in it\nthat made very little sense.\nAnd in this case, for example, if you look at\njoint appendix page 118, there's an allegation that with\n-- with one piece of literature that was described as\nracist, that some prisoners were allowed to have it while\nothers were not allowed to have that same kind of\nliterature. Now, I don't know whether those claims are in\nfact true, but that's the kind of claim that should be\nable to go forward in a case like this.\nWith all respect, I think the Sixth Circuit here\nmade a mistake, ignored this Court's precedents, and\nshould be reversed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nClement.\n"
