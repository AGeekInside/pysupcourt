        "content": "(10:01 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in No. 03-44, Basim Omar Sabri v. the United States.\nMr. Birrell.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW S. BIRRELL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BIRRELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nSection 666(a)(2) of title 18 is\nunconstitutional on its face because it never requires the\njury to find an element that the Constitution always\nrequires. The statute's unambiguous language allows a\nviolation to be proved with entirely local conduct\nunrelated to Federal spending. It thus intrudes deeply\ninto an area the Court has recognized as one in which the\nStates possess primary authority.\nQUESTION: Yet there's no doubt, Mr. Birrell, is\nthere, that in some circumstances the statute could be\nconstitutionally applied?\nMR. BIRRELL: There are no circumstances where\n66(a)(2) -- 666(a)(2) could be constitutionally applied,\nYour Honor, because the -- because the statute never\nrequires that the jury find a connection between the\nFederal spending and the offense conduct. In the same way\nthat there were possibly circumstances in Lopez where\nthere might have been an adequate Federal connection, but\nbecause the jury is not required to find it, there are not\nany circumstances where the statute could be\nconstitutional.\nQUESTION: Why -- why can't it be constitutional\nunder the Commerce Clause? I know the Government doesn't\nrely on that, but respondent can be supported here on any\n-- any ground. Why -- why isn't this a commercial\ntransaction as -- as, you know, our -- our Commerce Clause\nlaw is? So long as the transaction is commercial, we will\nassume it's interstate commerce. We will accept Congress'\njudgment on that.\nWhy isn't it a commercial transaction when you\nbribe somebody? Money for -- for whatever the favor he\ndoes.\nMR. BIRRELL: A couple things, Your Honor.\nFirst of all, there is not a requirement that interstate\ncommerce nexus be proved in the statute.\nQUESTION: That's not necessary. So long as\nit's commercial, our cases -- our recent cases, say so\nlong as it's commercial, we'll accept Congress' judgment\nthat it's interstate.\nMR. BIRRELL: Well, if Congress could create\ncommerce -- Commerce Clause jurisdiction everywhere that\nit could spend money, then -\nQUESTION: No, no, not everywhere it could spend\nmoney. Everywhere there is a commercial transaction. One\nof our cases, for example, held that loan-sharking could\nbe covered under the Commerce Clause because it was a\ncommercial transaction, just as illegal as -- as the -\nthe bribery here, but if that could be covered by the\nCommerce Clause, why can't this?\nMR. BIRRELL: Because without -- without a\nshowing that in each case there was a connection between\ninterstate commerce and the transaction -\nQUESTION: That's not what our cases require.\nQUESTION: Is that true of the drug statutes\ntoo?\nMR. BIRRELL: I'm sorry, Your Honor?\nQUESTION: I mean, is it true whenever the Feds\nprosecute a person for a drug transaction, a jury has to\ndetermine there was a connection between these drugs and\ninterstate commerce?\nI've never heard of that requirement that -\nthat the -- that the jury would have to determine whatever\nfacts are necessary for the statute to be constitutional\neven -- even though that's not an element of the offense.\nDoes that come out of a case or someplace? Where does it\ncome from?\nMR. BIRRELL: Well, unless -- unless there was\nan understanding that in every instance there was an\neffect on interstate commerce, then -\nQUESTION: I mean, there might be instances\nwhere there's no effect on interstate commerce, a home -\nyou know, that -- that will be an issue, homegrown\nmarijuana. So suppose there is some drug somewhere that\nhas no effect. Suppose it didn't. There could be such a\nthing. We can imagine it. But does that mean in all\nthese other cases that Congress -- that the statute is\nvoid because the jury hasn't found -- I'd be repeating\nmyself. You answer.\nMR. BIRRELL: I -- I think that it is different\nbecause the Commerce Clause is -- is a regulatory power\nthat permits Congress to regulate. The Spending Clause\npower is -- is a different sort of power. It does not\nmake that -\nQUESTION: And you say here Congress does not\nrely on the Spending Clause because it -- it makes conduct\ncriminal against an individual.\nMR. BIRRELL: I believe that Congress passed\nthis law under the Spending Clause power. I believe\nthat's what they intended to do. All the -\nQUESTION: To spend for the general welfare was\nthe basis in the court below and that combined with\nNecessary and Proper.\nMR. BIRRELL: That's right, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And that's the position that was\ntaken below, and I think most of the courts of appeals\nwent on that same ground.\nMR. BIRRELL: It's my understanding that every\ncourt that has looked at this has said that Congress\nattempted to pass this -- this particular statute under\nthe Spending Clause.\nQUESTION: Does -- does it matter what they\nintended to pass it under? I mean, if they have the power\nunder another -- under another head, would -- would that\nnot be enough?\nMR. BIRRELL: That is true, Your Honor. They\ncould -- they could -- the statute could be upheld if\nCongress has the power to do it on any basis.\nQUESTION: The justification sounds like a\nSpending Clause justification, doesn't it, that the -\nthat they could not by a lesser means safeguard these\nFederal funds? They tried narrower statutes and they\ndidn't work. But what they were trying to do was to\nsafeguard the integrity of the money that they were giving\nto these units by not having corrupt operations. Isn't\nthat the case?\nMR. BIRRELL: That -- that's what they said they\nwere trying to do. They were trying to regulate the\nintegrity of -- or -- or police the integrity of\norganizations, agencies, and local and State governments\nthat receive Federal funds. That's what they said they\nwere trying to do.\nQUESTION: And why is that not satisfactory?\nMR. BIRRELL: It's not satisfactory because the\nstatute doesn't require any connection between the\nspending -- Federal spending and the criminal conduct.\nQUESTION: Suppose that, just to use an analogy\nin the private sphere, a major corporation has a choice of\ntwo subcontractors and one subcontractor is known for\nengaging in lots of bribery and kickbacks, et cetera.\nIt's confident that it's got auditors that will be able to\nprotect it in this instance. But don't you think if you\nwere the CEO of the corporation, you'd rather prefer -\nrather deal with the subcontractor that was always clean?\nIt's just a common sense business judgment, and that's all\nthe Government is doing here.\nMR. BIRRELL: That's not what the Government is\ndoing here, Your Honor. What the Government is doing here\nis to criminalize purely local conduct. They're\ncriminalizing conduct that has no relation to any Federal\nspending.\nQUESTION: Well, it has relation because it\nwants to give its funds to those entities that it has\nconfidence in with respect to all of their operations.\nMR. BIRRELL: Well, it can make a choice about\ngiving money or not without criminalizing conduct.\nCongress has a number of ways that it can protect its\nFederal money. It can protect it under Commerce Clause,\nProperty Clause, not giving money, relying on the States\nto do -- to do what they need to do, False Claims Act,\nconditional spending. There's -\nQUESTION: They really say if we find a city\ncouncil that takes money and -- from us, the city council\ntakes the money for us for some of its programs here.\nThere's a corrupt city councilman. We want to prosecute\nthat person. Why? Because we want council -- members of\ncouncils to know that we're not going to tolerate\ncorruption on behalf of the agency that's giving out our\nmoney, whether in the particular instance it involved our\nmoney or not. Now -- now, why isn't that sufficient\nconnection?\nMR. BIRRELL: Because, Your Honor, there is -\nit may be that what -- that is what the Government wants\nto do, but the question is whether the Government has the\npower to do that.\nQUESTION: That's true, but why doesn't it?\nMR. BIRRELL: It doesn't have the power to do\nthat because there's not an element in the statute that\nrequires there be a connection proved between the Federal\nspending and the wrongful conduct. There may be one, but\nthe jury is not required to find one.\nQUESTION: Suppose the Federal Government had\nrecast the statute and said no State can get -- what's the\nlimit -- $10,000 or more from the Federal Government\nunless it agrees to criminalize and impose the same\npenalty set forth here for any State corruption. Would\nthat be constitutional under the spending power? It's a\ncondition to the grant.\nMR. BIRRELL: It might be if -\nQUESTION: It unquestionably would be, wouldn't\nit? It's take it or leave it. It's -\nMR. BIRRELL: Assuming it wasn't -\nQUESTION: -- it's connected to the grant. It\nhas some remote connection to it. That ought to be\nenough. It just seems very strange to me that the Federal\nGovernment would be able to compel the State to impose\nsuch criminal penalties, but it cannot itself do so in\nconnection with its spending.\nMR. BIRRELL: In -- in Your Honor's\nhypothetical, it might be coercive, unduly coercive, but\nother than that, I don't see a problem with your\nhypothetical.\nBut there's a -- the -- the Court -- this -- the\nCourt has said that Congress can attach conditions to\nmoney provided that the four Dole factors are met. But\nthat is not what's occurring here. This Court has never\nsaid that Congress can use the Spending Clause power to\ncreate a criminal law statute. And the danger with this\nis -\nQUESTION: Well, have we ever said it can't?\nMR. BIRRELL: Well, only inferentially by Dole.\nSo the question is never square with -\nQUESTION: I think it's kind of hard to read\nDole for that proposition.\nI may have missed your response to an earlier\nquestion. You -- you bring a facial challenge. Why\nshould we entertain a facial challenge? What if we\ntreated it as an as-applied challenge? Do you say the\nGovernment cannot prove the elements that you think are\nnecessary and thereby obtain a conviction?\nMR. BIRRELL: I -- I say that we -- we properly\nbring a facial challenge because the statute has no\nelement requiring a connection between the Federal\nspending -\nQUESTION: I don't -- we don't normally\nentertain facial challenges to statutes on a ground like\nthat. If it could be applied properly in an individual\ncase, why would we entertain the broader challenge?\nMR. BIRRELL: This statute cannot be properly\napplied in any case. It's always unconstitutional because\nit lacks this connection element. The statute is like -\nQUESTION: You say because it lacks the\nrequirement of a jury finding that there was the\nconnection.\nMR. BIRRELL: Yes. Well, there are two\nconcepts, both that there's not an element and that the\njury doesn't need to find it. This statute is -- is like\nthe statute in Lopez.\nQUESTION: Well, what if -- what if Congress had\nfound that interstate commerce is involved here and did\nnot provide for an individual jury finding in every case,\nwould your argument be the same?\nMR. BIRRELL: I don't know, Your Honor, but\nCongress didn't make that finding.\nQUESTION: It's a very candid answer.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Where -- where does this -- I mean,\nI've asked you this before, but I'm not sure. Where does\nthis jury finding thing come from? It's quite\ninteresting.\nBut -- but where -- I mean, suppose that\nCongress passed a statute under the Patent Clause\ncriminalizing certain conduct in respect to patent, and at\nthe border there might be an -- a question of whether it\ndoes or does not fall within the Patent Clause, that\nparticular criminal behavior. But I wouldn't jump from\nthat fact that you'd have a legal argument it's outside\nthe Patent Clause to the conclusion that therefore a jury\nhas to find in every patent crime -- a jury has to find\nthat it is within the clause. I'd have thought that was a\nquestion for the judge, not the jury. So you've been\nemphasizing the contrary idea, and where do you get it\nfrom?\nMR. BIRRELL: Well, in the -- in the -- in Your\nHonor's Patent Clause hypothetical, that is a case where\nthe Court would -- or the Congress would have a -- an\nenumerated regulatory power. This is -- this is a\ndifferent thing. Now -\nQUESTION: Well, it has the Commerce Clause\npower.\nI -- I don't understand your reliance on Lopez.\nYou just said just -- just as Lopez was bad, whether or\nnot there -- Lopez was -- was bad because it was not\ncommerce, which is a judgment that this Court will make,\nwhether it's commerce or not, but once it is commerce,\nyou're in a different ball park. Once it is commerce, we\nassume it's interstate commerce, and that explains, you\nknow, a whole bunch of our cases, such as our loan\nsharking cases. So Lopez has nothing to do with this\ncase. Lopez was not commerce.\nNow, you -- you may argue that -- that bribery\nis not commerce although loan-sharking is, but I'm not\nsure how strong an argument that is.\nMR. BIRRELL: This case is like Lopez because\nthe way I read Lopez -- I mean, I understand your point\nabout whether the conduct in Lopez was commerce conduct or\nnot, but the way I'm reading Lopez is that the point is\nthat when you're on the -- the fringes of the power,\ncommerce power in that case, that there needs to be a -\nan element where the jury would find in each case that\nthere was a connection between the exercised power of\nCongress and the conduct.\nSo in our case -\nQUESTION: You think there is such a -- such a\nconnection with loan-sharking, good, old, local, you know,\nbreak-your-knees loan-sharking. It's not -- not an\ninterstate thing.\nMR. BIRRELL: Well, you've -- you've told me\nthat -- that the Court has said that there is, and I -- I\naccept that.\nQUESTION: That's United States v. Perez. We\ntook a very expansive view of the Commerce Clause. And it\nwas pretty much of a local transaction in -- in the case,\nbut the Court pointed out, you know, the ripple effect\nthat all commercial transactions have.\nMR. BIRRELL: Well, I would return to my point\nthat I think that if the Congress can create Commerce\nClause jurisdiction by spending money and Congress is\nentitled to spend money under the Constitution anywhere it\ndeems it important for the general welfare, then what\nwould naturally follow, it seems to me, is the general\npolice power that the Constitution denies to the Federal\nGovernment. It seems to me to be an inescapable chain of\nreasoning that will get us there.\nQUESTION: Have any local law enforcement\noffices complained about the Federal presence?\nMR. BIRRELL: There -- there's nothing in the\nrecord about it, and I don't have anything to offer\noutside the record of it. But the -- the question whether\nthe local governments or government agents consent to an\ninvasion of their area of authority is -- is not\ndispositive.\nQUESTION: Question whether they regard it as an\ninvasion of their authority or rather a legitimate\nendeavor by the Federal Government to protect its money.\nMR. BIRRELL: Well, the -- the statute doesn't\nrequire the Federal Government to be acting to protect its\nmoney. There -- there is not any requirement that this\nmoney be the Government's money. For example, a private\ncitizen offers a -- a bribe to an agent. It could be an\nagent of a -- a corporation. The offer is refused and 12\nmonths later and for the first time more than $10,000 is\ngiven to an unrelated part of the agent's business, the\nbusiness the agent works for. Then we now have a Federal\ncrime committed. There's not any requirement in the\nstatute that there be a connection between the Federal\nmoney and the offense conduct. And furthermore, there's\nnot any requirement that the jury find it.\nQUESTION: Would you like to reserve the balance\nof your time, Mr. Birrell?\nMR. BIRRELL: I will reserve the balance of my\ntime, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Very well.\nWe'll hear from you, Mr. Dreeben.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe court of appeals correctly held that section\n666 does not require proof of a Federal connection between\nthe offense conduct and the federally funded program or\nFederal funds beyond that which the text of the statute\nitself requires.\nQUESTION: What -- what is the basis, Mr.\nDreeben? Under what authority did Congress pass the\nstatute?\nMR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, the Government\nhas relied on Congress' Necessary and Proper Clause\nauthority to protect its Spending Clause expenditures and\nprograms in this case.\nI recognize that the Commerce Clause could also\nprovide a basis for Congress to reach transactions\ninvolving criminal activity that affect commerce, but this\nCourt in Salinas v. United States, in describing why\nsection 666 was constitutional, as applied to the facts of\nthat case, discussed that there was a legitimate Federal\ninterest in protecting the particular program that\ncorruption had affected in that case. And the outgrowth\nof section 666 historically is of an effort by Congress to\nimprove on previously deficient methods of protecting\nfederally funded programs. There were -\nQUESTION: How far does that go? What if -\nwhat if the Federal Government gave the State $1? Could\nit make -- could it make it -- it a crime for any person\nto bribe any State officer anywhere in any program at all?\nYou know, the -- really is -- is there no end to the -- to\nthe scope of Congress' purported protection of its funds?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, I think that this\nCourt recognized, as recently as last term in Jinks v.\nRichland County, that analysis under the Necessary and\nProper Clause is deferential, tracing its roots back to\nMcCulloch v. Maryland, but there is an attenuation element\nto the analysis. The law does need to be conducive and\nplainly adapted to the end that Congress is seeking to\nprotect. And in your example of $1 to a State and then\nprotection through criminalizing the activities of\nhundreds of thousands of agents, there might be an\nattenuation problem.\nQUESTION: Do you think $10,000 is -- is clearly\n-- what's -- what's the -- what's the annual budget of New\nYork State, do you know, or California?\nMR. DREEBEN: Okay. The annual budget of\nCalifornia is -- at least in 1999, was $242 billion.\nQUESTION: $242 billion.\nMR. DREEBEN: And the Federal Government -\nQUESTION: And because there's $10,000 of\nFederal money, a drop of Federal money in this sea of -\nof California funds, the -- the Federal Government can\ncontrol the whole thing.\nMR. DREEBEN: But there's not a drop. There's a\nvirtual flood. There was -\nQUESTION: No, no. But for the statute to\napply, it takes only $10,000.\nMR. DREEBEN: It does, Justice Scalia, but\nCongress was well aware that every State is the recipient\nof billion upon billions of dollars in Federal aid. There\nis substantial Federal money flowing to all of the States,\nand Congress could have dispensed with any dollar\nlimitation whatsoever with respect to State aid and simply\nmade a per se finding that Federal money is so infused\ninto the State's budgetary activities, Federal programs\nare so pervasive -\nQUESTION: How much does it give California? I\njust -- just --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: You say it's a big -- a big figure.\nI believe you, but -\nMR. DREEBEN: As of -- as of 1999, California\nreceived $35,955,000,000.\nQUESTION: But why is California relevant? This\nis Minnesota, isn't it?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Stevens -\nQUESTION: It was my fault. I brought it up as\na hypothetical. Right?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DREEBEN: But I have Minnesota too.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DREEBEN: Minnesota received -- Minnesota's\nbudget was $36 billion, and it received 4,000,000,496\nFederal dollars -\nQUESTION: What about Massachusetts?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, I only have 30\nminutes and there are 50 States.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, I am concerned about the\nbreadth of your reliance on the Necessary and Proper\nClause and the Spending Clause power here. It seems to me\nthat Federal funding extends to a huge range of\nactivities, and why, under your theory, couldn't Congress\nmake -- take over the entire criminal law scheme because\nit affects Federal taxpayers? I mean, I don't see any\nlimit to your theory, and I'm curious why you're so\nreluctant to rely on the Commerce Clause. What's going on\nin this case?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice O'Connor -\nQUESTION: Are you trying to overcome the\nproblems of Lopez somehow, get a new thread of analysis\nthat gets you out from under that? What's -- what's\nhappening in this case?\nMR. DREEBEN: No. I think there are ample\navenues for the Federal Government to legislate, when\nthings involve interstate commerce, without worrying about\nLopez.\nI believe the Court could uphold the statute as\na regulation of interstate commerce, but it was clearly\nnot designed with that in mind, and this Court did not so\nregard it, or at least didn't articulate itself as\nregarding it that way in Salinas v. United States. The\nproblem that Congress was trying to solve was a very\nparticularized problem, not the generalized problem of\nthere is crime in America, therefore it will affect\nfederally funded activities.\nThe problem that Congress was trying to solve\nwas that it would give Federal money to particular\nentities to -- to administer Federal programs, and there\nwould be crime that had the potential to affect those\nFederal interests, but because of deficiencies or\nperceived deficiencies in prior statutory law, that crime\ncould not be prosecuted. In particular, with theft crimes\nthere was a problem because once title had passed with the\nmoney to the local entity or State entity, some courts\nwere saying that was no longer theft from the Federal\nGovernment and the theft statute didn't apply. With\nrespect to the Federal bribery statute, 18 U.S.C. 201,\nlower courts had divided on whether State and local\nofficials who were administering Federal programs could be\nheld accountable as Federal officials.\nAnd to remedy those deficiencies of prior law,\nsection 666, as the court of appeals I think aptly\ndescribed it, changed the enforcement paradigm, and it\nsaid that what we want now is not to focus on particular\nFederal monies that we have difficulty tracing into\nfederally funded entities or who is a Federal official.\nWe want to make sure that the entities that we fund to\ncarry out Federal assistance programs are clean, and the\nway that we are going to do that is to draft a\nprophylactic statute that ensures that all agents who are\ninvolved in the authority to conduct business on behalf of\nthe entity are not engaged in significant acts of theft,\nembezzlement, or bribery.\nIt, therefore, included various limitations in\nsection 666 that prevent it from being an all-\nencompassing, all-devouring statute that sweeps in all\nrelated crimes to the entities that are funded. There's a\n$5,000 limitation with respect to the transactions that\nare going to be influenced. It's not every traffic ticket\nthat is issued by any State agency. And there is a -- a\ncondition, of course, that there be $10,000 of Federal\nmoney going into the entity.\nOf course, there are going to be cases under\nthis statute where it will be difficult to articulate a\nclear -\nQUESTION: $10,000 annually or is it just a -\ncould it be a one-shot deal?\nMR. DREEBEN: It's -- could be a one-shot deal.\nit's a $10,000 grant during a 12-month period that spans\nthe offense conduct in question.\nAnd as I was saying -\nQUESTION: If -- if the State got -- I mean, the\nway you read it, just because you got $10,000 last year\ndoesn't mean that next year you're still subject to the\nact. It has to be -\nMR. DREEBEN: That's right.\nQUESTION: -- during the year. Okay.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's right. The offense conduct\nhas to be -\nQUESTION: It says in any 1-year period, but I\n-- I assume that that means -\nMR. DREEBEN: Any 1-year period, but there's\nanother provision in the statute that makes clear that the\nperiod can include time before the offense conduct and\ntime after the offense conduct, which is naturally read to\nmean that it has to span the offense conduct. And that\nprovision was designed to overcome the difficulty that\nState and local agents would be bribed for activities that\nthey would have the power to engage in once the Federal\nmoney was awarded to their agency. And in anticipation of\nFederal money coming into the entity, the officials could\nengage in corrupt conduct.\nQUESTION: I assume this means that the Federal\nGovernment could also criminalize federally robbery or\nburglary committed against a private individual who has\nreceived Federal funds, who has received a Federal subsidy\nin one way or another. Right?\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, Justice Scalia, within\nlimits. I think that there could be a -- a point in time\nat which the Court might say that if the Federal\nGovernment passed a statute that said every robbery\ninvolves -\nQUESTION: I mean, that's probably all of us,\nyou know.\nQUESTION: All welfare recipients --\nMR. DREEBEN: All money -\nQUESTION: -- all Medicare beneficiaries, and so\nforth?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, the Court -- the Court long\nago upheld in United States v. Hall a statute that\nprevented fraud and embezzlement directed at funds going\nto veterans. So it has already upheld statutes in which\nthe Federal interest in protecting the beneficiary's\nuse -\nQUESTION: It was limited to the funds, though.\nIt didn't say anything you -- anybody who gets any money\nfrom a veteran is -- is -- you know.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's -\nQUESTION: And that's what this says. Anybody\nwho -- who bribes any State official, whether the Federal\nfunds are at issue or not.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, this -- this statute,\nthough, I think rests on a generalization that is less\nattenuated and more reasonable than statutes that would\ntake the form of the statute Your Honor has described.\nThis statute basically says if you have corrupt officials\nin the entity that's getting Federal money, we have reason\nto worry that you have poor internal controls, that you\nhave a culture of corruption, that you have insufficient\nmechanisms to root it out, and that the officials that are\nengaged in corruption today with respect to State money\nmay tomorrow be engaged in corruption with respect to\nFederal money.\nQUESTION: So -- so call -- call this the clean\nfunnel rationale. The agencies are funnels funneling\nmoney to the -- and say, look, we have a pretty strong\nrationale here. We want clean funnels because a little\nbit of the money going through is Federal. Take that as\ngiven.\nIf I were to say you're right, what's the\nstandard where the Spending Clause is at issue? What\nwords would be used there? And the reason that this is\ndifficult at the moment for me is because this is not a\ncondition imposed upon spending. You're not saying to the\nState, we'll give you the transport money if you -- this\nis really a Federal law protecting the -- the spending.\nYou may be right in this case, but we're going to have to\nsay some kind of standard.\nShould we say it's just whatever would be\nnecessary and proper to protect the object of the\nspending, which is quite far out because you can spend for\nthings you don't otherwise have the power to do? Or\nshould we say something else, or should we say we don't\nhave to reach that here because if in fact the power would\nbe there under the Commerce Clause anyway, that at least\nis good enough and isn't a stretch of the Spending Clause\nwhere there's a necessary and proper rationale? What in\nyour view is the proper way to write those words?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, I think the most\nlogical way to write this opinion is to rely on the test\nthat this Court articulated in 1819 through Chief Justice\nMarshall with respect to the power under the Necessary and\nProper Clause. Here the enumerated power that's being\nprotected is the spending power. The Necessary and Proper\nClause was long ago construed to give Congress substantial\ndeference to pass laws so long as they are conducive to\nthe end that Congress is trying to achieve and its\nlegitimate.\nQUESTION: The -- the McCulloch language? Let\nthe end be legitimate -\nMR. DREEBEN: That's -- that's correct. That's\ncorrect, Justice Kennedy.\nQUESTION: Suppose that -- that to -- to take\nthe phrase, the clean funnel theory, we thought that that\ntheory is best sustained under the Commerce Clause. What\nwould be the closest case that we could cite in support of\nour position if we were writing under the Commerce Clause?\nAre there cases in which governmental entities and -- and\ntheir -- the integrity of the operations are protected\nunder the Commerce Clause? Have we ever talked about\nthat?\nMR. DREEBEN: I can't think, off the top of my\nhead, Justice Kennedy, of a Commerce Clause case that was\nspecifically directed at governmental activity. Of\ncourse, this statute is not specifically directed at\ngovernmental activity. It's directed at any fund\nrecipient, be it private, Indian tribe, or governmental.\nSo the Court could rely on cases probably like Reno v.\nCondon in which the Court upheld a law that dealt with an\nitem in commerce, be it in the hands of the Government or\nin hands of private parties. And of course, United States\nv. Perez did uphold a very broad view of the Congress'\npower to regulate transactional conduct.\nQUESTION: No governmental entities in that\ncase, as I recall.\nMR. DREEBEN: No governmental entities in -- in\nPerez, but of course, this case doesn't focus on\ngovernmental entities as such. What it focuses on them is\n-- it focuses on them in their capacity as administrators\nof funds that are paid out under Federal assistance\nprograms. It treats them identically to private entities\nthat also receive Federal funds under Federal programs,\nwhich is strong evidence that what Congress had in mind\nhere was ensuring that its purposes and goals under the\nSpending Clause aren't frustrated by corruption within\nwhatever entity it is that happens to be taking the funds\nto administer the program.\nQUESTION: I think some of our -\nQUESTION: Is the -- is the Spending Clause -\nis it -- is it something new or were the statutes that\nwere inadequate, the predecessors of 666 -- what was the\nconstitutional heading of authority that the predecessors\nof 666 -\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Ginsburg, 18 U.S.C.,\nsection 641, which was the Federal theft statute, was\nreally a protection of Federal property, and that probably\ncould be justified under a variety of enumerated powers\nunder Article I.\n18 U.S.C., section 201 was the Federal bribery\nstatute that primarily focuses on people who are Federal\nofficials or who are designated to become Federal\nofficials. And this Court in United States v. Dixson\ninterpreted the statute to cover State and local officials\nwho were administering Federal programs because they were\nacting on behalf of the United States. And with respect\nto that branch of section 201, although the Court did not\naddress the constitutional question in Dixson, I think\nthat the proper grant of authority to analyze it is the\nNecessary and Proper Clause as applied to the spending\npower because it, like section 666, criminalizes the\nactivities of non-U.S. persons because they are engaged in\nan activity that relates to federally funded programs.\nSo the theory of protecting through criminal law\nthe misdeeds of agents that may impair Federal programs or\nimpair Federal funds is not new. What was new about\nsection 666 was its removal of the impediments that\nCongress found in the prior law so that it could have an\neffective mechanism to ensure the integrity of its\nprograms.\nThe case that is before the Court today is a\nfacial challenge to section 666, arguing that it is always\nand everywhere unconstitutional. That submission is\nimpossible to reconcile with this Court's decision in\nSalinas v. United States which specifically said that as\napplied to the conduct in that case, where there was a\nconnection to a Federal program, the statute was\nconstitutional as applied.\nWhat that means is that the court of appeals was\nclearly correct in holding that section 666 is not\nfacially unconstitutional. It leaves open whether there\nis an as-applied constitutional challenge to section 666.\nNo such challenge was brought in this case, and the United\nStates made a proffer to the district court indicating how\nthe particular bribery in this case would have had an\neffect on Federal funds and Federal programs, making clear\nthat no such as-applied challenge would have succeeded.\nSo the only way that petitioner can prevail in\nthis case if this Court is prepared to say that\nnotwithstanding its prior decision in Salinas, holding\nthat section 666 was constitutional as applied, it now\nturns out that section 666 is facially unconstitutional\nand can never be applied to anyone anywhere. We submit\nthat that is incorrect.\nQUESTION: If there were a nexus requirement\nthat we wrote into the statute -- the hypothetical gets a\nlittle murky at this point -- would -- would juries have\nto find that there was a nexus or could the judge\ninstruct -\nMR. DREEBEN: Judging from the way that this\nCourt resolved the Salinas decision, Justice Kennedy, it\nwould be a constitutional as-applied challenge to be\nresolved by the Court. This Court in Salinas said that\nthe statute was constitutional as applied and there had\nbeen no jury finding on any nexus requirement.\nQUESTION: But in subsequent trials, if we found\na nexus requirement, would the juries have to determine\nthe nexus?\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't think that they would,\nJustice Kennedy. Just as in a case like New York v.\nFerber where the Court held that child pornography can be\noutlawed across the board, the statute is not --\nQUESTION: Well, but --\nMR. DREEBEN: It's not invalid on overbreadth\ngrounds.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. DREEBEN: But the Court left open the\npossibility that there would be as-applied challenges, and\nit didn't suggest that those as-applied constitutional\nchallenges would raise jury issues. They would instead\nraise issues of law for the -\nQUESTION: Well, but if Congress in its -- in -\nin the statute says there must be some connection with\ninterstate commerce, then certainly it's a jury issue.\nAnd Justice Kennedy's question, as I understood\nit, was that supposing the Court were to read in a nexus\nrequirement, just exactly what Congress might have put in.\nYou say that would not be a jury question then.\nMR. DREEBEN: I am judging, Chief Justice\nRehnquist, by the way that this Court resolved the legal\nissue in the Salinas case. The Court would have two\noptions open to it if it decided, contrary to our\narguments today, to read in some sort of a nexus\nrequirement. It could do what the Second and Third\nCircuits have done, which is, we think incorrectly,\nsuperimpose on the statute as an implicit element that has\nno textual foundation some sort of a Federal nexus.\nNow, if the Court did construe section 666 to\nrequire a Federal nexus, that's clearly a jury issue under\nUnited States v. Gaudin. Every element, be it implicit or\nexplicit, has to be found by the jury.\nBut alternatively, I understood Justice Kennedy\nto be suggesting that there could be a constitutional\noverlay to ensure that there was no unconstitutional\napplication of section 666, and if it's treated as a pure\nconstitutional question, then I think the better reading\nof this Court's decisions is that it would be a question\nof law -\nQUESTION: Do you think this Court's decisions\nhave been consistent on that question?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DREEBEN: I think they have been groping\ntowards consistency.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Let me write that down. Groping\ntowards --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: I can -- I can use that in --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, what answer do you give\nto the dissenting judge in the Eighth Circuit who said it\nis now a Federal crime for an auto mechanic to induce a\npublic high school principal to hire him to teach shop\nclass by offering free car repair?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, so long, Justice Ginsburg,\nas the statutory valuation elements are met, that the\ntransaction involves $5,000 or more, which it probably\nwould, given teacher salaries, then it would be covered by\nsection 666, and the Government would have discretion to\nprosecute it. I think what that illustrates is that the\nbroad prophylactic approach that section 666 takes leads\neasily to the manufacturing of hypotheticals that seem\nattenuated from core Federal interests.\nAnd the choice that Congress had before it was\nto draft a statute that would go to that degree of breadth\nbut eliminate impediments that had previously hobbled the\nenforcement of a law or draft a statute which Congress\nbelieved was both under-inclusive and would put to the\njury perhaps difficult and murky issues of whether there\nreally was a Federal connection that justified application\nof the statute. And let me give an example because it's a\nvery important, classic example of the way that we use\nsection 666.\nSuppose that there is a city council person or a\nmayor or some other official who has responsibilities for\nsome respect -- in some respects administering a Federal\nprogram or Federal funds, and he turns out to be engaged\nin corruption with respect to non-Federal monies and non-\nFederal programs. The Government wants to prosecute him\nto ensure that he doesn't begin to widen his field of\noperation and harm the Federal program, but in the facts\nthat can actually be proved, there's no connection between\nthe Federal program and the offense conduct.\nConceivably could a statute be drafted that\nwould allow the Government to say that's the kind of\nFederal nexus that's covered? Certainly, but there are\nmany, many hypotheticals where the potential injury to\nFederal interests is not necessarily going to be easy to\narticulate and prove to a jury.\nAs a matter of discretion, the United -\nQUESTION: Who -- whose burden is it? I mean,\nassume we accept your -- your proposition that we should\nuphold it on its face, at least, and that future as-\napplied challenges will still be allowed. Would it be the\nburden of the defendant to establish that -- that this\ngoes too far, that this is not reasonable protection of\nthe Federal monetary interest?\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, Justice Scalia. If it's a\nquestion of law, is the statute unconstitutional as\napplied, then the defendant should have the burden of\nestablishing that. But I understood Justice Ginsburg's\nhypothetical to raise the question what if Congress had\ndrafted a narrower statute that had some sort of an\noffense nexus element. Then we'd have to prove it up.\nThe United States Attorneys Manual does direct\nprosecutors to use 666 in cases where there's a\nsubstantial and identifiable Federal interest. So what\nyou have here is a combination of Congress saying we need\na statute that's adequate to vindicate Federal interests\nand prior efforts to draft narrower ones have frustrated\nthat goal. We're going to draft a broader statute. And\nthen the Federal executive branch uses its discretion to\nprosecute cases that do, indeed, pose a real threat to\nFederal interests. Now, that's as a matter of discretion.\nIt's not as a matter of constitutional law, and it's not\nas a matter of what the statute provides.\nQUESTION: Well, then why should we take that\ninto consideration deciding the question before us?\nMR. DREEBEN: It's not relevant, strictly\nspeaking, to the constitutional question. What it is\nrelevant to is why it was rational for Congress to draft a\nsomewhat broader statute without fearing that, by virtue\nof having given the executive branch this power, State\ncriminal law would be thoroughly swamped, I believe as one\nof the dissenting opinions said.\nQUESTION: But what if you have a new executive\ncoming in who is really hot on this subject and says we\nwant to prosecute every case we can under it?\nMR. DREEBEN: Then I'll have to withdraw this\nstatement.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Or an even more realistic\nhypothetical is the United States Attorney in Chicago or\nNew York, who are not always, shall I say, responsive to\nthe directives of central justice, bringing a prosecution\nagainst a political opponent that has really no connection\nwith a Federal interest. That might happen.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, I often say that\nthe only way that we get uniformity in Federal criminal\nlaw enforcement is from a decision by this Court.\nIf the Court has no further questions.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Dreeben.\nMR. DREEBEN: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Mr. Birrell, you have 12 minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW S. BIRRELL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BIRRELL: Thank you, Your Honor.\nTurning first to the discussion about Salinas,\nSalinas did not decide the issue presented in this case.\nThe constitutionality of the statute was not before the\nCourt in Salinas. Salinas was a question of statutory\ninterpretation. What the Court appeared to do was to\nconduct a harmless error review because the\nconstitutionality had not been raised in the briefs, was\nnot in the cert petition, and it does not impede our\nfacial challenge.\nI think that this -- this -\nQUESTION: You -- you think Salinas, had the\nconstitutional been raised, would have -- should have come\nout the other way.\nMR. BIRRELL: I think that if the constitutional\nissue had been raised in Salinas, it would have come out\nthe other way, yes.\nI think as well that if I could direct the Court\nto page 34 of our brief, that this will respond to the\ndiscussion about the element, that this is an analysis\nabout the element in Lopez. We would submit the same\nwould apply here.\nThere are many noncommercial applications of\nthis statute, for example, bribery regarding civil rights\nlaw. So I don't think the Commerce Clause is -- is the\nanswer.\nFurthermore, in -- 666(a)(2) doesn't even\nrequire any actual recipient corruption because the third\nparty to the funding contract under (a)(2) can -- can\noffer a bribe to an absolutely incorruptible official and\nyet still be charged with a Federal crime.\nThe -- the overreaching question in this case,\nYour Honors, is that Federal power must have judicially\nenforceable limits and this statute ignores them and is\nunconstitutional in every instance.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nBirrell.\n"
