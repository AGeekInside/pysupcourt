        "content": "(10:15 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument first this morning in case 07-1601, Burlington\nNorthern and Santa Fe Railway Company et al. v. United\nStates.\nMs. Sullivan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nIN NO. 07-1607\nMS. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe court of appeals in this case untethered\nCERCLA liability for response costs from the plain\nstatutory language of CERCLA section 107(a)(3), and in\nso doing also imposed potentially crippling liability on\nentities with only the most attenuated connection to any\nharm. 107(a)(3), which is reprinted in the petition\nappendix in 1607 on page 266a, provides that among the\npotentially responsible parties under CERCLA are\nso-called arrangers; that is, those persons who by\ncontract, agreement, or otherwise arranged for disposal\nof hazardous substances.\nThe paradigmatic case, of course, would be a\ngenerator of hazardous waste calls up \"Waste Co.\" and\nasks Waste Co. to take those substances to a landfill or\nto otherwise dispose of them. Where CERCLA does not\ndefine a statutory term -- and there's no definition of\n\"arrange\" -- this Court has long said, for example in\nUnited States against Bestfoods, that we look to the\nordinary meaning of the language, and the plain meaning,\nthe ordinary meaning, of \"arrange for\" is to make plans\nor preparations to do something. The ordinary meaning\nof the word \"for\" is to refer to a purpose or goal. And\nthe ordinary meaning of \"to dispose\" is to discard or to\nthrow away. So --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if your shipper\nhere knew that every time he delivered one of these\ntruckloads of the chemical, one-third of it would end up\non the ground and seeping through the ground, and no\ndoubt about it, he knew that, and yet they kept sending\nit? Wouldn't that be arranging for the disposal of at\nleast a third of the shipment?\nMS. SULLIVAN: No, Your Honor. That's not\nour facts, of course, but even if there -- there had\nbeen knowledge here, knowledge is not sufficient to give\nrise to the specific intent required by the statute.\nJust as in the criminal law, we wouldn't infer in a\nspecific intent case that one is presumed to know the\nnatural consequences of one's acts. What is required\nhere is an actual plan to dispose. And --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose that it's\nShell's truck -- that isn't this case, but suppose it's\nShell's truck, and every time they make a delivery the\ndriver catches the waste in a can, four or five gallons,\nand dumps it in the creek. Is Shell liable there under\nthe statute?\nMS. SULLIVAN: Justice Kennedy, Shell might\nwell be liable there, but not under 107(a)(3), rather\nunder 107(a)(2).\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, hasn't it arranged\nfor the disposal of the --\nMS. SULLIVAN: You wouldn't reach arranger\nliability there, Your Honor, because as in the Amcast\ncase, when Judge Posner said the truck is a facility,\nthe truck would be a facility that Shell owns or\noperates in that instance. But in this case, of course,\nShell was hiring independent contractor truckers to ship\nthe waste.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm -- I'm not sure\nthat I agree with your answer. Can you give me an\nexample under this statute where Shell might be an\narranger -- give me some hypothetical in which Shell\nwould be an arranger?\nMS. SULLIVAN: Well, Your Honor, we believe\nunder arranger liability shell would never be an\narranger here. The only thing --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What if Shell went out of\nbusiness and it had some stuff left in the tanks? At\nthat point, they might very well hire somebody to do\nexactly what you're saying.\nMS. SULLIVAN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That would be an eccentric\nsituation, but it could happen.\nMS. SULLIVAN: Justice Souter, if Shell had\nresidual waste product that it was seeking to dispose,\nthen the natural reading of 107(a)(3) would apply\nbecause that would be waste product.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why isn't that the case in\nmy hypothetical -- it's just a hypothetical -- where the\ndriver catches the five gallons that spills out of the\nhose every week and dumps it in the creek?\nMS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's really the same as\nthe question you answered Justice Souter, and that's an\narranger under (3).\nMS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, the key\ndifference in the two hypotheticals that you've posed is\nthat Shell is the owner and operator of the disposal of\nwaste there, and therefore it would be a 107(a)(2) case,\nnot an arranger case. The arranger liability is\ndesigned for --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Sullivan, would it be\naltogether different if, instead of the FOB destination\nterm, Shell continued as owner of the product until it\nhad gone from the hose or whatever delivers it, so that\nthere is no transfer of ownership until the delivery is\ncomplete?\nMS. SULLIVAN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that\nwould be a different case. That would be a case like\nthe so-called formulator cases, of which United States\nagainst Aceto from the 8th Circuit is paradigmatic. And\nin that case the key is that the company arranging --\nthe company was held liable for arranging to dispose of\nwaste where it owned the product throughout a\nmanufacturing process, sent it out to a formulator, but\ngot it back as its own product, knowing that inherent in\nthe formulation process was the creation of waste\nmaterial. So Shell would have been the owner of the\nwaste.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The problem I have with\nthat line you're pursuing is the FOB destination term is\nan eminently fixable connection, and CERCLA is -- can be\na punishing statute, but the one thing that was not\nintended was for the parties to arrange themselves out\nof arranger liability by providing neatly that the\nmoment the product reaches a destination there's no\ncontinuing responsibility on the part of the seller.\nMS. SULLIVAN: Justice Ginsburg, that is\ncorrect with respect to arranging for the disposal of\nwaste. One couldn't evade one's responsibility for\narranging for the disposal of waste products. If you're\nshipping sludge or discarded materials or spent battery\ncasings or waste oil, if you're shipping waste then you\ncan't get out of your obligations by simply arranging\nfor someone else to collect the waste FOB destination.\nBut the difference here is that this is not a waste\ncase. This is a --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Isn't it waste when it\nspills? You deliver -- you're supposed to deliver 100\ngallons, 5 gallons spills; isn't that waste?\nMS. SULLIVAN: Justice Kennedy, it only\nmatters for 107(a)(3) if we arrange for it to spill.\nAnd as Judge Posner said in Amcast, no one arranges for\nan accident except in the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: They know that --\nhypothetical. They know that in the course of delivery\nyou're always going to spill about five gallons. That's\nwaste.\nMS. SULLIVAN: Well, Justice Kennedy, the\ndistrict court found in this case that Shell had\nknowledge of spills at the site of the bulk unloading.\nThese were minute spills, only 80 gallons, 80 gallons a\nyear out of 123,000, or .07 percent.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All I'm talking about is\njust a hypothetical definition of waste.\nMS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, even if the\nspills are waste, the key for arranger liability, the\nkey for arranger liability is that you arrange for\nspills.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But we were talking about\nwaste, and I just wanted to get your agreement -- maybe\nyou won't agree -- that when the product is delivered\nand 5 percent of it spills, that is waste, and we can\ntalk about the other parts of it later.\nMS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, the statute\nCERCLA, by cross-reference to the Solid Waste Disposal\nAct, does include spills and leaks as possible waste,\nand the natural application of that definition would be\nto spills or leaks in a waste disposal. If a landfill\noperator spills or leaks waste, then obviously that's\nwaste. But even if you treat drips of a useful product\n-- and there's no dispute here that the D-D shipped to\nthe agricultural facility was a useful product, shipped\nfor commercial use for application in the fields. Even\nif you view it as a spill of that product if a little\nbit falls out of the hose upon delivery at the bulk\nstorage tank, it does not entail that Shell was an\narranger for the disposal of hazardous waste.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if Shell had a choice\nbetween two companies to do the delivery. One would\ndeliver it with no spillage whatsoever, but the other\nwould deliver it with a certain amount, a small amount\nof spillage. And Shell chose the latter because it was\ncheaper. Would it not be arranging under those\ncircumstances?\nMS. SULLIVAN: It might well be because\nthere would be an economic benefit to Shell from the\narrangement for shipment in the leaky truck. That would\nbe quite a different case from this one. There was no\neconomic benefit to Shell from the leaks here. In fact,\nShell did everything possible, so far as the record\nshows, to prevent spills.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But I thought your\ndefinition of -- of disposal implied the disposition of\nsomething whose use had, in effect, been exhausted, so\nthat I would have thought your answer to Justice Alito's\nquestion would have been different because even in the\ncase in which they hired a sloppy delivery, they're not\ngetting rid or the deliverer is not necessarily getting\nrid of a product whose use has been exhausted.\nMS. SULLIVAN: That is correct, Your Honor.\nWe believe the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I would have thought you\nwould have similarly answered Justice Kennedy's question\ndifferently and would have said that just because\nsomething's wasted doesn't mean that it is waste. I\nmean, you may waste part of what is delivered, but what\nis spilled is -- it doesn't seem to me to be waste.\nMS. SULLIVAN: Justice Kennedy and Justice\nSouter an easy way to hold this case and to reverse the\ncourt of appeals would be simply to hold that when a\nuseful product is spilled it is not waste. And the\ncross-reference to the Solid Waste Disposal Act would\nsupport that interpretation because in 42 U.S.C. Section\n6903(3) Congress defined \"hazardous waste\" as that\nmaterial which is discarded. It analogize it to sludge.\nThis is not a case about sludge or waste material.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But your argument\nassumes a sharp distinction between useful product and\nwaste. Yet it's quite common to talk about there being\nwaste associated with a useful product. When you use up\nso much of this, there's going to be a certain\npercentage of waste.\nMS. SULLIVAN: Correct, Your Honor. But the\n-- so even if you don't draw the line simply at the\nuseful product-waste distinction, we still do not\nqualify as an arranger under 1007(a)(3) because we did\nnot arrange for the spill, we did not arrange for the\nwaste.\nThe government relies on facts in the record\nto suggest that we had some special knowledge or special\nresponsibility, and of course the government's argument\nthat mere knowledge of a third-party's spills would\ncreate arranger liability would disrupt commerce across\na range of industries. It would mean that the chlorine\ncompany is liable when the pool supply store spills a\nfew drops of chlorine and the place becomes a facility.\nIt would mean that the maker of perchloroethylene is\nliable when the dry cleaning establishment spills dry\ncleaning fluid near the dry cleaning machine, even if\nthey had nothing to do with it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's making it too\neasy for you. It would mean all of those people would\nbe liable when in the course of delivering stuff they\nknow there's going to be a certain amount that's going\nto spill, and even, perhaps the Justice Alito\nhypothetical, they could have easily chose the truck\nthat causes more spill rather than the one that causes\nless. It's not simply here's the product, we're gone,\nsee you later, and all of a sudden there's a spill.\nMS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, there's no\nsuggestion in the record here that we're in Justice\nAlito's example. The district court found that spills\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, i know. But\nI'm trying to reach the extent of your argument. So in\nthat type of a case would there be arranger liability?\nMS. SULLIVAN: There -- we believe there\nwould not be because spilling a useful product while\nit's being delivered should not count as waste. But\neven if you treated that as waste within the meaning of\nthe statute or even if you treated that as a discard of\na hazardous substance, there still should not be\narranger liability based on mere knowledge. There has\nto be knowledge of a third party's spills.\nThe difference from Justice Alito's example\nis that Shell there would be invested in the spillage as\npart of its own economic transaction, as in formulator\ncases, where you send a material out to a manufacturer\nintending for it, expecting for it to spill in the\nprocess, you know you're going to get 98 percent back.\nThat's not this case. Shell sought here, as most\nroutine commercial sellers and shippers do, to get a\nthird-party truck to take all of the stuff to B&B and\nhave it used for its commercial application as pesticide\nin the field. There was no built-in here, no effort to\nbuild in here any benefit for Shell in the leaky truck,\nQuite distinguishing Justice Alito's example. The\ngovernment --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, one benefit would\nbe avoiding CERCLA liability through a means other than\nwhat I call the fixable connection. Is this the first\noccasion on which Shell because of its sales of D-D has\nbeen charged with CERCLA liability? Is this a case of\nfirst impression, or have there been other instances in\nwhich Shell did very much the same thing, delivered the\nD-D FOB destination?\nMS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, this is the first\nand only case in the nation that has held that arranger\nliability applies to a mere sale of a useful product\nbecause a third-party purchaser after acquiring\npossession and control spilled the product. So there's\nno other case I am aware of in which it's been\nadjudicated that there is any liability under these\nfacts.\nBut the key distinction here is that even if\nyou don't distinguish between the useful product and\nwaste and even if you go with Justice Kennedy's idea\nthat spilling a useful product could be waste, it still\nis not arranging for the disposal of that substance\nunless there's an intent to dispose. Here Shell wanted\nevery drop of D-D to be safely placed in the bulk\nstorage tank.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Sullivan, can I\ninterrupt you? Because I'm still puzzled by your answer\nto Justice Alito. Are you conceding that if in this\ncase Shell had an alternative carrier who would not have\nspilled a bit, that then there would be liability?\nMS. SULLIVAN: No, we are not, Justice\nStevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I thought you did in your\nanswer to Justice Alito. Why wouldn't that be? Explain\nyour answer a little more fully?\nMS. SULLIVAN: Justice Stevens, we concede\nthat if there is a waste product that leaves Shell and\nShell deliberately arranges for a leaky carrier, there\nwould be no issue. That would be 107(a)(3). Even if --\nand we concede there might be a possible case in which\nShell deliberately chooses to send a useful product in a\nway that it leaks. It puts the product into leaky\ncontainers when it leaves the shop. Then there might be\nsome case in which you might attribute knowledge, infer\nintent from knowledge.\nBut this is not that case because here the\ntransfer to the third party -- the transfer to the third\nparty occurs at tender of delivery under ordinary UCC\nprinciples. The -- the transfer to the third-party\npurchaser occurs, and that's when the spillage occurs.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought there was as\npart of this picture that Shell had a manual which told\nits purchasers how to handle this material, and that\nShell was well aware that B&B was not following the\nprecautions laid out in the manual.\nMS. SULLIVAN: Justice Ginsburg, two points:\nThe manual comes out only in 1978, and a Shell\nrepresentative visits the site only in 1979. That\nleaves 19 years of liability unaccounted for on that\nperiod.\nBut, more important, it would be terribly\nimpractical and terribly perverse in relation to the\npurposes of the environmental laws that Congress passed\nto penalize a manufacturer for telling a third-party\npurchaser how to handle a product more safely. So to\nuse the manual issued in 1978 or the inspection in 1979\nas evidence that Shell knew there were spills and,\ntherefore, was an arranger would be perverse in relation\nto the environmental statutes.\nIf there are no further questions, I would\nlike to reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Mahoney.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nIN NO. 07-1601\nMS. MAHONEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI would like to start with section 912 of\nthe Restatement because I think it really helps to\ndemonstrate that the trial court fully understood and\nproperly applied the common law standards that govern\nthe determination of apportionment in a pollution case.\nThat section provides that when a party bears the burden\nof proof, they have to establish the extent of harm and\nthe amount of money with, quote, \"as much certainty as\nthe nature of the tort and circumstances permit,\" end\nquote.\nAt the time that CERCLA was adopted in 1980,\ncommon law courts for more than a century had been using\nthat standard to apportion damages and harm in pollution\ncases based on essentially rough estimates because the\nnature of the tort, pollution, and the circumstances\ndon't allow for the kind of precision that we might\nrequire in some other settings such as proof of -- of\nfault, for instance.\nAnd the United States, they say that the\ndistrict court departed from those common-law standards,\nbut it's telling: They don't cite a single common-law\ncase decided before CERCLA in their entire brief. If\nyou were to look at section 840(e) of the Restatement,\nwhich governs nuisance cases and apportionment -- it's\nan application of the section 433(a) standards -- they\ncite -- the Restatement cites approximately 50 cases. I\ndon't think there's a single one where a court denied\napportionment for a nuisance for a harm such as this one\nthat is theoretically capable of apportionment.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This court -- - this\ncourt, Ms. Mahoney, didn't deny apportionment.\nApportionment was never requested. The court said:\n\"I'm going to have to figure this out on my own.\" In\nfact, the court deplored the parties for following what\nhe called a \"scorched-earth tactic.\"\nSo the apportionment is not something that\nhas been denied to the PRPs in this case. It's\nsomething that the court thought was proper and fair,\nbut it didn't deny any request made by parties, isn't\nthat so?\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, in note 16 of the\nNinth Circuit's opinion it actually rejects that\nargument by the government and says that apportionment\nwas pled throughout the case; that the government was on\nnotice. That's note 16. The trial court very\nspecifically rejected the government's claims of waiver\nsaying, yes, apportionment was at issue here throughout\nthe case, both in terms of --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you point to me the\npart of the district court opinion that conflicts with\nthe part that I remember so well? He is saying, this is\na really tough assignment; I have to figure it out.\nMS. MAHONEY: Oh, he does say that, Your\nHonor. But what he says is that the theory of\napportionment that was offered by the railroad, the\nargument that it made -- they offered an expert -- that\ngave substantial precision about how to allocate harm\namong the different chemicals on the site -- he doesn't\naccept that approach. He accepts a different approach.\nBut at 252(a) he says -- he confirms --\nthere is, quote, \"considerable evidence of the relative\nlevels of activities and number of releases on the two\nparcels\" that allow him to find a basis of -- for making\na reasonable estimate of the apportionment, which was\nhis responsibility as the factfinder. In addition, Your\nHonor --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it -- is it a judge's\nresponsibility, no matter what evidence may be in the\nrecord from which one could make a finding, when a\nfinding hasn't been sought?\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, Your Honor, the finding\nof apportionment was sought. The trial court -- and,\nagain, note 16 of the -- of the Ninth Circuit's opinion\nmakes clear -- and the government doesn't say otherwise\n-- that the railroads had requested apportionment. The\nissue was whether or not they had argued the precise\ntheory, and the factfinder certainly has the authority\nto choose the theory that it thinks best approximates\nwhat is a reasonable estimate.\nAnd in fact, Your Honor, the theory that the\ntrial court seized upon was actually suggested by the\ngovernment's own expert on cross-examination in the\ntranscript at -- at 4077 to '78.\nAnd in addition, Your Honor, when it was\ntime for closing argument, which was September 28th,\n1999, at the very beginning of the transcript, page 4,\nthe trial court said to the government -- it said to the\nparties at the beginning of the closing argument, here's\nwhat I want to know about. I want you to address\nyourselves to whether or not I can apportion this harm\nbased upon the relative area on the site and the\nrelative time. He put the government on notice.\nWhen the findings of fact came out, Your\nHonor, the government could have filed a motion to amend\nunder Rule 52. They in fact filed a motion. They could\nhave asked to submit additional evidence if they somehow\nthought that this had been unfair. They didn't do that.\nShell did it for other reasons, but the government\nelected not to.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I suppose the district\ncourt, if it wanted additional evidence, could have\nsaid, I want additional evidence on this point.\nMS. MAHONEY: It absolutely could have. And\nso that argument of waiver was rejected by two courts\nbelow, both by the district court in denying the motion\nto amend -- it granted it in certain respects, but\nrejected waiver, and then by the Ninth Circuit --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if -- what if\nyou have a situation where it's clear under\napportionment one party is liable for one-tenth and the\nother is liable for nine-tenths, but one-tenth is enough\nto pollute the -- the water. Do you have apportionment\nin that situation?\nMS. MAHONEY: It depends, but generally yes.\nAnd the reason, if it, as here -- the cost of the remedy\nis driven by the mass of the contamination -- and it was\nundisputed that that was the case here -- then the costs\nhave gone up based upon the aggregate harm.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I assume it's\nnot a linear, if that's the right word, progression,\nbecause once you've got to start a clean-up, you've got\nto start a clean-up, whether it's, you know, caused by\none-tenth or -- or nine-tenths.\nMS. MAHONEY: But it's that the whole cost\n-- the question under apportionment is: Are all of the\ndamages attributable to the harm that was caused by the\ndefendant? And if they're not, then apportionment is\nappropriate. And here --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that hasn't been --\nthat hasn't been the position of most courts under\nCERCLA. I thought they -- I thought that there had been\nrelatively few cases where apportionment, when\nrequested, was even allowed because the theory is the\nact provides for contribution. One PRP can go after\nanother, but the party who shouldn't be left holding the\nbag is the public, the innocent victims of the\npollution.\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, Your Honor, under -- the\ngovernment has acknowledged that the apportionment\nstandards from the Restatement apply under the -- under\nCERCLA. And cases, as I indicated, the cases under\n840(e) almost always allowed apportionment for\npollution, even though it meant that a farmer or a\nrancher or a grower was left holding with harm that was\ncaused by another defendant. But the law has always\nsaid you can't impose damages on a defendant that had no\ncausal responsibility.\nHere what we're talking about, under the\nNinth Circuit's holding, that they -- they didn't\nquestion the district court's factfinding at 248a that\nit is indisputable that the overwhelming majority of\nhazardous substances were released by B&B on its own\nparcel, on its own land, not on the railroad's land.\nIts own operations on its own --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought -- I thought --\nand tell me if my recollection of the facts is\nincorrect, that the -- the newer parcel that enabled B&B\nto expand its operation, the waste went into a pond,\nwhat was called South, that was on the other side, that\nwas on the original B&B parcel. So you had the waste\nflowing from one part to the other.\nMS. MAHONEY: The trial court found that it\nwas plausible that some leakage, some spills on the\nrailroad parcel, during the 13 years of the lease made\nit into the groundwater by traveling nearly two football\nfields in an area that hardly has any rain, but said\nthat 9 percent was the maximum of damages that could\npossibly be attributable to this.\nWhat the Ninth Circuit really says is that,\neven though B&B began dumping thousands of gallons of\nchemical rinsate in 1960, which was 36 years before this\ncase was filed, 15 years before the lease was ever\nentered into, that all of that harm that was caused by\nB&B has to be paid by the railroads, because they can't\n-- that's almost $40 million now -- because they can't\nprove with precision whether their share of the damages\nmight be zero or one million or nine million.\nAnd so what, in essence, the Ninth Circuit\ndid was said that because there weren't adequate records\nto prove what amount of dumping was going on in 1960\nwhen there wouldn't have been any reason to keep those\nrecords, that as a default matter 100 percent of the\nharm has to be allocated by the railroads, even though\nit's not -- they didn't question the district court's\nfinding that it's indisputable that the overwhelming\nmajority was by B&B on its own land. And the court has\nto --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the issue\nof insolvency? You have talked about the Restatements.\nThere's the comment H to one of the Restatement\nprovisions that says you don't apportion if one of the\nother parties is insolvent.\nMS. MAHONEY: Actually, that's -- Your\nHonor, what it actually says is that the district court\nin exceptional cases may deny apportionment due to\ninsolvency. And here the district court at 248a found\nthis was not such a case, exercised its discretion to\nsay no.\nAnd in addition, Your Honor, there are no\ncases cited in that section of the Restatement where\nthis was actually done. And the Third Restatement in\nsection 28, comment C, says that that comment was\nactually inconsistent with section 433(a) principles.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Stewart.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, may it\nplease the Court:\nIf I could begin with the issue of arranger\nliability. The Ninth Circuit distinguished what it\nreferred to as the useful product cases and made it\nclear that it would not impose arranger liability on\nShell simply under the theory that Shell had sold a\nuseful product that was later disposed of in a way that\ncontaminated the environment.\nRather, the Court of Appeals and the\ndistrict court emphasized both that Shell had control\nover the delivery process and that Shell knew that, as\nthe district court put it, leaks and spills were\ninherent in the chosen method.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How does that differ from\nyou using your printer, there's an ink cartridge and you\nreplace them after a while, and mine has a little thing\nattached that says don't put it in your ordinary garbage\nbin because it's dangerous or whatever it is, put it in\nthis envelope and do something?\nNow, I'm sure that HP makes those and knows\nthat several million people won't do it. They will\nthrow it in the garbage bin, and they ship to it me.\nAll right. Are they now arrangers?\nMR. STEWART: No, I don't think they\nwould -- they -- I don't think they would be arrangers\nfor the disposal.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because?\nMR. STEWART: Because even though they might\nforesee that in some --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, some? No, probably\nmillions. I don't know anybody who does put it in the\nright garbage can.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. STEWART: But -- first, I think under\nordinary tort law principles a seller's knowledge that a\ncertain percentage of its product would be misused would\nnot be sufficient to give rise to liability --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then how is that then\ndifferent from Shell? Shell here knows that to some\ndegree their people are going to spill this. And, of\ncourse, shell arranged the transport. And in my\nimaginary hypothetical -- I don't really know -- so does\nHP.\nMR. STEWART: There are two differences.\nThe first is that while HP might know that some\npercentage of its customers would dispose of the\nmaterial improperly, here the district court found that\nShell knew that spills and leaks occurred with every\ndelivery. And the second --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, now maybe HP knows\nthat there is a particularly bad customer like Breyer\nwho --\n(Laughter.)\n-- because I foolishly admitted at dinner\nthat I dispose of them all improperly. Now are they\nShell?\nMR. STEWART: The second difference here is\nthat Shell arranged for the delivery and controlled the\ncircumstances under which the delivery would be made.\nThat is, Shell hired the common carrier and Shell\nrequired that B&B have bulk storage facilities so that\nthe D-D would have to be pumped from the delivery truck\ninto the bulk storage.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So then, suddenly if HP, in\nfact, uses -- I guess they lease -- you know, they have\na common carrier, imagine -- or suppose it's car\nbatteries, same problem. They have their own trucks,\nand they -- or they use Fed Ex; I don't know. And they,\nin fact, put in an instruction, which says: Really do\nit; really put it in the special now.\nMR. STEWART: Again, at a certain point,\nonce the product has been used by the customer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm trying to find that\npoint. And what I have found you so far to say from the\nbriefs is that what Shell here did -- I'm not saying it\neasy -- but what they did was they arranged the\ntransport, that seems to me to be common, and they put\nsome instructions in which said the right way to dispose\nof it. Well, doesn't everybody do that?\nMR. STEWART: No, because the fact\ncircumstance here was not that Shell or the common\ncarrier transferred control of the D-D to B&B with\ninstructions as to how it was to be used at a later\ndate, and the customer then violated those instructions.\nThe fact pattern here is that the spills occurred during\nthe process of delivery.\nAnd to return to Justice Alito's\nhypothetical, you asked what if Shell deliberately chose\na particular delivery company that it knew would result\nin spills, but did so for economic advantage, that's\nexactly the case here. That is, at a prior time the D-D\nhad been shipped to B&B's facility in sealed drums, so\nwhatever the possibility that it might be misused later,\nit wouldn't be spilled or leaked during the process of\ndelivery and transfer. But Shell decided that it was to\nits economic advantage to require bulk storage of D-D.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. You say in the\nprocess of delivery. I thought that this material\nbecame the property of the buyer when the truck arrived.\nAre you saying it only -- it only became the property of\nthe buyer when it was unloaded from the truck?\nMR. STEWART: The district court\nspecifically declined to make a finding there. That\nis --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What does \"FOB\" normally\nmean?\nMR. STEWART: It says \"FOB delivery or place\nof delivery.\" And the district court found that B&B\nacquired what it called stewardship over the property at\nthe time that the truck entered the premises, but that\nit --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think -- I think it's\nsomething of a misdescription to say that this spillage\nis occurring in the course of delivery.\nMR. STEWART: But the district court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think as far as Shell was\nconcerned, delivery had been made when the truck pulled\nup.\nMR. STEWART: Well, the district court\nspecifically declined to find -- to make a finding as to\nwho owned the D-D at the time it was spilled.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're making it.\nMR. STEWART: We don't think that our\nargument is dependent upon the question of ownership,\nbecause Shell undeniably had ownership and possession of\nthe D-D at the time the arrangement was made, and --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Independent of the time of\ncontrol.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Independent but not at the\ntime of the spill.\nMR. STEWART: That's correct. But that\nwould be true in the paradigmatic arranger case, where\none company has generated waste and hires a hauler to\npick it up and take it away. Those parties could easily\nprovide by contract that title would pass to the hauler\nat the time the garbage --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then in your view what it\nis is a company arranges with a transporter for disposal\nwhen the company knows that the transporter on arrival\nmay spill some of the product?\nMR. STEWART: It's more than --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I guess then every oil\ncompany -- well, I mean, every liquid product company in\nthe United States is going to be -- fall within that\nbecause a lot of people do spill things.\nMR. STEWART: Knowledge might well be\nsufficient, but here we have more than knowledge, we\nhave control.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But why do we -- I mean, do\nwe have control? Shell says to its buyer, see that the\ndelivery is made in the following way, so it doesn't\nspill all over the place. If Shell did control, it\nwouldn't have to say that to the buyer. In effect it\ncould either order the buyer, as a condition of receipt\nof the product, or it could require that as part of the\n-- its terms with the - with the deliverer. It seems to\nme that the way Shell has set it up indicates that\ncontrol has passed to somebody else at the time that the\nspigot starts going in the tank.\nMR. STEWART: Well, as Ms. Sullivan said,\nthe instructions were given in 1978, fairly far into the\nperiod of contamination. But Even before that date\nShell had control in the sense that it required bulk\nstorage on the B&B facility.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: He says, we won't sell you\nto unless you -- you -- you have these tanks, correct?\nMR. STEWART: And its contract with the\ncommon carrier required that the common carrier have\nparticular equipment for pumping the D-D out of the\ntruck and into the bulk storage facility.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, so what is your -- no\nquestion, those are -- those are terms of their\nwillingness to deal. But what is your basis for saying\nthat when the truck pulls up and they -- the hose is\nturned on to deliver, that at that point Shell is\ncontrolling the process?\nMR. STEWART: They have -- they have control\nof the process in the sense of defining the way it is to\nbe done. You're correct that the actual process of\nunloading is being done by employees of the common\ncarrier and employees of B&B rather than employees of\nShell. But again, the whole point of arranger liability\nis to not allow the people who set in motion the process\nthat culminates in disposal to get off the hook.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So you don't -- but maybe\nyou do claim, I'm not sure -- that Shell actually could,\nin effect get damages from its deliverer as a result of\nthe -- the deliverer's incidental spillage. Is that\nyour position?\nMR. STEWART: That is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That is, that the spillage\nis a breach of the contract between the transporter and\nShell?\nMR. STEWART: Well, I think if -- if Shell\nhad pursued such a cause of action, then the delivery\ncompany might well have argued that these -- this was\nforeseeable and that there was --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But do you have any basis\nfor saying that if it had pursued that course of action,\nShell would have succeeded?\nMR. STEWART: No. And --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then why is Shell in\ncontrol?\nMR. STEWART: I mean, that's my point.\nShell would not have succeeded in such a suit, because\nthe delivery company would have argued successfully this\nwas known to be an inherent consequence of the delivery\nprocess that Shell has chosen.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, yes, but you're\nsaying that the delivery company would have had a\ndefense, but you are -- are saying that Shell would have\nhad at least a theoretical right under its actual\ncontract with the deliverer to assert the -- the control\nover the manner of delivery that would have prevented\nthe spill; is that what you're saying?\nMR. STEWART: Well, it certainly insisted by\ncontract on the use of the pumping equipment of -- to\npump the D-D from the truck into the bulk storage\nfacility. And that was --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's the only way they\ncould do it if the buyer did have bulk storage, isn't\nthat correct?\nMR. STEWART: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. STEWART: So -- and to use an analogy --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask, is it essential\nto your theory that Shell had title to the material\nuntil delivery?\nMR. STEWART: It's not essential to our\ntheory. That is, the point of the arranger liability\nprovision is to get at situations in which one person\nsets in motion a --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What if it were a fungible\nproduct and the purchaser just agreed to take either\nsome product of this -- this quantity and quality and so\nforth, but they could substitute other -- other goods\nfrom another source? Would Shell still be liable?\nMR. STEWART: I mean, I guess I would have\nto know more about the hypothetical in -- as to the\ncircumstances in which the disposal occurred.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, Shell gave all the\nsame instructions they gave here, but they just didn't\ninsist that it be their product rather than somebody\nelse's, another oil company's product.\nMR. STEWART: I guess I just -- I don't\nreally understand the hypothetical, because I don't\nunderstand the situation in which Shell would be\nindifferent as to whether its product was being bought\nor the product of a competitor was being bought.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Stewart, could I go\nback to a -- we have been arguing about details. Can I\ngo back to the -- to the broader question? What is your\nbest response to the argument that Ms. Sullivan makes\nthat \"arrange for disposal\" implies something\nsignificantly different from \"arrange for transfer,\"\n\"arrange for release,\" \"arrange for delivery\" -- that\nthe -- that the combination of arrangement as an\nintentional act and disposal, as opposed to one of these\n-- these other processes, implies that the, in effect,\nthe use of the product intended has become exhausted and\nthat one in getting rid of waste as distinct from merely\nwasting something. What is -- what is your best answer\nto that?\nMR. STEWART: We agree that the term\n\"arrange for\" connotes intentionality, and we think it's\nsatisfied here because Shell intentionally set in motion\nthe process of delivery. It insisted upon the delivery\nbeing done in a particular fashion, and it knew that\nspills and leaks were inherent in that process. To use\nan analogy --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if we're not arguing\nabout that, what you are arguing about, then, is the --\nis the implication of disposal, as opposed to a more\nneutral term like transfer or delivery or what-not.\nWhat's your answer to that?\nMR. STEWART: The further point I would make\nis that the term \"disposal\" is specifically defined to\ninclude spilling and leaking.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, but those are certainly\nways in which disposal can occur, as I -- I think came\nout in the argument. If the -- if Waste Management\nspills things along the highway on the way to the dump,\nit may be leakage, but a disposal is going on because in\nfact it is a way of getting rid of something that no\nlonger has any use.\nSo I -- I can -- I don't think the -- the\ninclusion of leakage within the definition answers the\nquestion whether disposal is something different from\ntransfer.\nMR. STEWART: To use a couple of analogies,\nI think if I know that my car leaks oil whenever it's\noperated and I choose to drive it on the public highway,\nI think I could naturally be said to have intentionally\ndischarged oil onto the highway. It may be --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well you have discharged,\nbut you -- the question is whether it's disposal.\nMR. STEWART: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: \"Discharge\" is a more\nneutral term.\nMR. STEWART: Well again, the term\n\"disposal\" is specifically defined to include spilling\nand leaking. You're right that one --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but I mean, that --\nthat -- that begs the question. Because in the course\nof disposing, in the sense that she argues for, there\ncan be leakage.\nMR. STEWART: That's true, but --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The question is disposal\nversus transfer or some more neutral term.\nMR. STEWART: If you had a situation, for\ninstance, where the trash company was hauling waste and\nintended to dispose of it in a more classic sense by\ndumping it at a landfill, but along the way the truck\nleaked, and some of the items spilled out --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: When?\nMR. STEWART: -- I think everybody\nacknowledges that there is disposal there, and I think\nwe would also say that a company that contracted with\nthat trash hauler, knowing that the vehicle tended to\nleak trash on -- on every delivery, could be said to\nhave arranged for not only the ultimate disposal, but --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No that's at that point,\nbecause I think you're focusing on the word. You don't\nuse the word \"for\" disposal, and I think that is the key\nword, and the question is intention versus purpose.\nSo that in your trash hauler case, it seems\nto work pretty well for me that when we say that that\ntrash truck of course intended in the sense that it was\nits purpose to dispose of the trash when it got to the\ndump, but the leakage along the way, it was not its\npurpose.\nSo how do we deal with that? The statute\ntells us that they are an owner of a facility or a\nvessel that leaks, and therefore they are liable that\nway. Now, that seems to work.\nSo we get your example. What doesn't seem\nto work is when you import the notion of intention in\nthe sense of knowing that to the arranger provision,\nbecause at that point I don't see how -- and I have to\nbuy that to get your argument. At that point I do not\nsee how you get every thing of Clorox on the shelf on\nthe shelf in the supermarket and don't put Clorox right\nin the arranger provision and lots of other companies\nthat shouldn't be held as arrangers. That's my problem.\nAre you following that?\nMR. STEWART: I am following that, but I\nthink that the court of appeals dealt with this and\nsaid: Our holding does not suggest that every\nmanufacturer of a useful product is liable down the road\nif the customer ultimately disposes of it --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It does say that, but my\nproblem is I can't find in the distinctions that they\nmade useful distinctions that will do that. It will say\n\"many,\" but it won't say, for example, the car battery\nmanufacturer who sends his car batteries out in his own\ntrucks to places where people will get them, and he\nknows that they're not going to do it properly no matter\nhow hard he tries.\nWell, he's not an arranger. He didn't\narrange the transport for disposal; he arranged the\ntransport for sale.\nMR. STEWART: I mean, I think in a sense the\nargument for liability there would depend in part on an\nassumption that people will systematically violate the\nlaw, like it would be an easy thing for the Court to say\nwe will not assume and we will not impose liability on\nthe basis of the assumption that battery customers will\nsystematically violate the law.\nBut the second thing that would be missing\nin that hypothetical, even if the battery manufacturer\nwere assumed to know that every one of his customers\nwould dispose of them ultimately in an improper way, is\nthat the battery manufacturer would not be in control of\nthat process.\nThe manufacturer's control over the use of\nthe batteries and their ultimate disposal would be\nsevered once he turned them over, and that was not the\ncase here. And again I think to return to the purposes\nof the arranger liability provision, the operator\nliability provision deals very well with the people who\nundertake the actual disposal, but Congress evidently\nthought that that was not enough.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, is Shell liable\nbecause it -- it knew of the transportation\narrangements?\nMR. STEWART: I think it is a combination of\nknowledge and control. Knowledge might be sufficient,\nbut knowledge and control together form a basis for\narranger liability. Again, if I know that the\nparticular common carrier uses a truck, to use a variant\nof my earlier hypothetical, if I know that a particular\ncommon carrier uses a truck that leaks oil whenever it's\noperated on the highway and I contract with that carrier\nand ask it to haul goods, I think I can naturally be\nsaid to have arranged for the discharge of oil on --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but you -- in that\ncase, you have knowledge but you don't have control\nbecause you're using a common carrier.\nMR. STEWART: I have -- I have control in\nthe sense that I have deliberately selected a mode of\ndelivery, a particular common --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then you mean simply\ncontrol over your own choice process?\nMR. STEWART: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Not control over the\nbehavior of your hauler?\nMR. STEWART: Not -- not control in the\nsense of using my own personnel to drive the truck.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Whether you have -- you\nmight have knowledge that one chemical broker is more\ncareless than another in the way the product was\nultimately sold, I don't see why your theory doesn't\nmake the seller liable as an arranger if it knows or\nought to know that at some point in the distribution\nprocess there is likely to be spillage which will enter\nthe waters of the United States. I think that's what\nyour argument implies. I just don't see that in the\nstatute.\nMR. STEWART: Again, because here Shell had\ncontrol over the very aspect of the process that\nresulted in spills and leaks.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You mean it could have --\ncould have adopted some other means?\nMR. STEWART: Not only --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's all you mean by\nhaving control over it.\nMR. STEWART: Not only that it could have\nadopted some other means, but that it insisted upon the\nparticular means --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right. So all you're\nrequiring is knowledge that using this means will --\nwill result in a spill. I don't think knowledge alone\nis enough for -- I think you need purpose. If you\narrange for disposal, I think you have to have a\npurpose. It -- it has to be your object to have the oil\nleaking along the highway as you go. Merely knowing\nthat it's going to be leaking, I mean, there may be some\nother way under the statute that you can find liability\non the part of the shipper, but not, it seems to me, on\nthe -- on the ground that the shipper arranged for this\nleak. He didn't want the leak. He knew it was\nhappening, but that was not the object of the transport.\nMR. STEWART: Clearly, if the Court reads\nthe term \"arrange for\" to require purpose, we lose in\nthis case --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right.\nMR. STEWART: -- because that was not the\npurpose of the transaction. But here there was both\nknowledge and control.\nAnd in terms of fairness to Shell, I think\nit is worth noting that in the typical arranger setting,\nwhere a person asks a trash hauler to come pick up my\ntrash and deposit it in an appropriate place, that the\narranger's ultimate liability may be determined very\nsubstantially by steps that the hauler takes afterwards;\nthat is, if the arranger believes that the trash is\ngoing to be disposed of safely, but in fact the hauler\ndumps it in a way that will contaminate the environment.\nThe arranger was --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you a question\nabout your argument that the Petitioners waived their\napportionment argument? Aren't there many pages of the\ndistrict court record in which the parties address\napportionment? For example, in the government's\nresponse to the Petitioners' apportionment argument,\ndon't you have more than 20 pages of findings of fact\nand conclusions of law on the issue of apportionment?\nMR. STEWART: We haven't used the word\n\"waiver\" in our brief and -- but we concede that the\nrailroads and Shell, at least in a cursory way, raised\nthe issue of apportionment at trial, and the Ninth\nCircuit found that was sufficient to preserve it. In\nour view, this is like any case in which a party with\nthe burden of proof on a particular issue asserts that a\nparticular proposition is true but fails to introduce\nsufficient evidence to carry its burden. You wouldn't\nspeak of that as waiver, but it's still a failure of the\nparty to come forward with enough to carry the day. And\nyou --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: On the question of\napportionment, is it really your position that because\nof the precision you would require, that if there's a\nbig fight over whether it's 10 percent responsibility or\n30 percent and there's no way to tell, that if the\nparties said, look, we'll take 40 percent, that that's\nno good?\nMR. STEWART: No, I think that would be an\nacceptable approach. I think that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't that what\nhappened here? I mean, whatever -- I guess the\nrailroads said 6 percent, and the district court said,\nwell, just to be on the safe side, we'll give them 9\npercent.\nMR. STEWART: Well, I guess we would have\ntwo responses. The first is, although the district\ncourt certainly believed that he was -- the district\njudge believed he was building in a margin of safety, in\nour view it's still speculative as to whether the\nrailroad's share of the contamination exceeded or was\nless than 9 percent.\nBut the more fundamental point is the one\nthat you raised in one of your questions; that is, the\nultimate harm to the government in a practical sense is\nthe incurrence of response costs, and in general that's\nthe way that damages are measured in a CERCLA case. You\ndon't ask, what threat -- what was the degree of public\n-- of threat to the public safety that was posed by the\ncontamination? You ask, how much did it cost to clean\nit up? And it --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you dispute what Ms.\nMahoney said, that it costs a great deal more to clean\nup some of the other chemicals than the ones that the\nrailroad was responsible for?\nMR. STEWART: Well, I think -- I don't think\nthat the record kind of establishes the relative costs\nof different contaminants. What I understood Ms.\nMahoney to say --\nJUSTICE ALITO: The volume, the volume.\nMR. STEWART: What I understood her to say\nwas that the cost of the remedial action is proportional\nto the mass of chemicals to be removed, and we do\ndispute that proposition. The railroad's expert, Dr.\nKalinowski testified about the remedial action that the\ngovernment at that time was contemplating, and it was\nwhat was referred to as \"a pump-and-treat system,\" where\nwater would be pumped out of the aquifer and it would be\ntreated with granular-activated carbon, or GAC, and that\nwas a method of removing the contaminants so that the\nwater could be pumped back in. And Dr. Kalinowski said\nthe amount of GAC that would be needed to implement that\nremedy would be proportional to the mass of the\nchemicals involved, but that the crucial point for these\npurposes is the treatment with GAC is only a small\nportion of the pump-and-treat remedy; that is, it's\nessential to drill wells, pump the water out, then treat\nit, and then under the prior remedial approach, pump it\nback in. And then --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that still\ndoesn't address the question, if you have varying\ndegrees of whatever you want to call it -- fault or\ncausal relationship -- that that's a sensible way to\napportion the liability.\nMR. STEWART: I think the first preliminary\npoint is there's no reason to think that the cost of the\nremedy as a whole would be proportional to the mass of\nthe contaminants because you have very substantial fixed\ncosts, but the other point I would make is this is where\nthe insolvency of B&B really seems to us to become\ncrucial because, if you had all solvent defendants and\nthe evidence showed that the remedy the government\nimplemented would have been more or less the same if it\nhad only been 10 percent of the contamination, 30\npercent of the contamination, or 100 percent of the\ncontamination, that so much of the costs were fixed\ncosts that reducing the volume was really not going to\naffect the cost in any meaningful way -- if you had all\nsolvent defendants, it might still be the case that\ndividing the costs up in proportion to the contamination\nthey caused would do rough justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what -- what\nabout Ms. Mahoney's three answers, when I asked that\nquestion of her?\nMR. STEWART: Well, I believe her first\nanswer was the cost of the remedy would be proportional\nto the amount of contamination, which we disagree with,\nand we don't think Dr. Kalinowski's testimony bears that\nout, because all he said was the amount of\ngranular-activated carbon that would be necessary is\nproportional to the mass of contaminants. And that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: She also said that\nthe Restatement comment h that you rely on cites no\ncases, and the Third Restatement backs away from that\ncomment.\nMR. STEWART: Well, as to the first point,\nthe comment h, you're right, doesn't cite cases, and it\ndoes say that this -- the insolvency of the defendant\nneed not prevent apportionment, only that it would\nprovide a basis for doing so in exceptional cases. But\nin our view, the exceptional case would be one in which\nthe ultimate determination was that the cost of the\nremedy, the amount of the relevant harm, would be more\nor less the same even if only one defendants's\ncontamination were at issue, that it --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you don't think\nthat the insolvency should prevent apportionment if you\nhave a situation where a party is 1 percent responsible\nand the 99 percent responsible party is insolvent?\nMR. STEWART: Well, we would say even as to\n10 or 20 percent, if it were established that the remedy\nthe government would have been required to implement,\nhad the only source of contamination been leakage on the\nrailroad parcel -- if it were established that the\ngovernment could have cleaned that up at 10 percent or\n20 percent of the cost of the remedy that was actually\nchosen, then there might be a sound basis for\napportionment despite the insolvency of B&B.\nBut our big point is, at the very least, the\ngovernment should not be left holding the bag for costs\nthat it would have been required to incur if the\nrailroad parcel had been the only source of\ncontamination, because --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And what do we have\nin the way of findings on that question?\nMR. STEWART: We don't have findings either\nway. That is, the district court framed the relevant\ninquiry as what percentage of the contamination was\nattributable to the railroad parcel, to the\nShell-controlled deliveries, and to the B&B parcel. But\nit made no finding one way or the other as to what the\ncost of the remedy would have been if only the -- the\nonly source of contamination had been the railroad\nparcel.\nAnd certainly the -- the primary equitable\nthrust of the argument on the other side is it's unfair\nto make us pay for somebody else's contamination. But\nto the extent that the government would have been\nrequired to implement a remedy this costly or even 60\npercent this costly had the railroads or Shell been the\nonly source of contamination, by imposing at least that\namount of liability, we're not asking for them to pay\nfor B&B's contamination. We're simply asking for them\nto pay for the response costs that their own --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But is that right?\nI mean doesn't it -- aren't you challenging the whole\nbasis for apportionment? I mean there is -- I don't\nthink when you're apportioning responsibility, you\nallocate whether or not the actors independently caused\nthe harm. I thought the assumption was, yes,\neverybody's -- all of this group has contributed to the\nharm, but now we're going to apportion their\nresponsibility.\nMR. STEWART: Well, indeed, the second\nrestatement says as a categorical matter that if either\nof two causes would have been independently sufficient\nto bring about the result, then there's joint and\nseveral liability. The example that the restatement\ngives is two merging fires that destroyed a building.\nAnd so I think it is established in -- in\nthe second restatement that the -- there is no\napportionment if either of two causes would have brought\nabout the -- the feared harm.\nWith -- with respect to the third\nrestatement, I would say that at least in the case of --\nyou're -- you're right. There is no exact counterpart\nto comment (h) in the third restatement. But at least\nas to indivisible harms -- and I think this is\npotentially an indivisible harm that the government\nwould have been required to undertake more or less the\nsame response action regardless of the source of\ncontamination.\nAt least as to individual harms, the third\nrestatement gives a variety of approaches that a local\njurisdiction could take. There's joint and several\nliability, pure several liability, and then there are\nseveral permutations. And the third restatement is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that a finding? Do we\nhave to take it as a given that this was an indivisible\nharm?\nMR. STEWART: I don't know that -- I think\nyou should take it as a given because it was the\ndefendant's burden to prove different divisibility. But\nI think if you don't regard the defendants as having the\nburden, I don't think there is an evidentiary basis for\nfeeling confident one way or the other as to whether the\nharm was indivisible. But with respect to --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What is the basis for\nthinking that every little detail in the latest\nrestatement, including comments, is binding in a CERCLA\ncase?\nMR. STEWART: I don't think so, and this\nCourt in Norfolk and Western -- it was dealing with a\ndifferent statute, but it said when you're looking at\nthe restatement, it's more important what the state of\nthe law was when Congress enacted the statute rather\nthan what the common-law principles are now. And as\nwe've said in our brief, we think for that reason the\nsecond restatement is the more crucial document.\nBut if you were to look at the third\nrestatement, one of the things you would find is that\nthe drafters, as to indivisible harms, identified a\nvariety of approaches that a local jurisdiction could\ntake -- expressly decline to choose a preferred one\namong them, but said the most important determinant in\nchoosing between them is how will the risk that a\nparticular defendant be insolvent will be allocated.\nSo the drafters of the third restatement\ncertainly didn't treat insolvency as a factor that\nshould be ignored in citing questions of an\napportionability.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I -- may I just ask\none question about the -- the situation of -- of these\ntwo potentially responsible parties? They are the only\nones left, right? Because B&B is bankrupt, and there's\nnobody else that has been identified.\nMR. STEWART: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So it's only those two.\nAnd one question about the arranger liability -- well,\nfirst on the apportionment. Assuming we don't accept\nyour entire position, would a remand so that proof could\nbe put in by both sides focusing on the issue of\napportionment be appropriate? You questioned the\ndistrict, even -- even if apportionment were possible,\nyou questioned how he arrived at it.\nMR. STEWART: I guess that's true. To the\nargument that I've just been sketching out, that -- that\nthe crucial question is what response costs the\ngovernment would have been required to bear if -- if\nonly the railroad parcel's contamination had been at\nissue, our argument is that the -- the railroads failed\nto prove divisibility. But another option would be to\nremand for factual proceedings to address that question.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And is it true, as Ms.\nSullivan said, that there is no other arranger case like\nthis one where the, quote, \"arranger\" is the seller of a\nproduct?\nMR. STEWART: I think there is no \"arranger\"\ncase going in either direction that is on all fours with\nthis one where there is the sale of a useful product\nduring the course of a delivery that the seller arranged\n-- that the seller controlled.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Sullivan, we will give you five minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nIN NO. 07-1607\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Ms. Sullivan, just on the\napportionment point, do you agree that it is your burden\nto show that this is a divisible harm, and can you tell\nme how you showed that?\nMS. SULLIVAN: Yes, Justice Kennedy. The --\nthere is no dispute in this case that this was a\ndivisible harm. Mr. Stewart answered Justice Scalia's\nquestion incorrectly.\nThe district court found and the circuit\ncourt also found -- the circuit court's finding is on\npage 36-A of the Petitioner's appendix -- that there is\nno dispute that the harm here is divisible; that is,\nthere -- the -- the harm here is capable of\napportionment. That is not disputed before this Court.\nWhat is disputed is whether at the second\nstage of analysis the railroads and Shell met our burden\n-- and we agree it is our burden under restatement\nprinciples -- of showing the -- the quantum of division,\nthe reasonable basis for how the shares were allocated\nby the District Court. And Justice Alito is correct.\nThere are meticulous findings, 20 pages of findings,\nbased on record evidence from the government's witnesses\nand from the extensive expert testimony that both Shell\nand the railroads put in that went to the apportionment\nissue. Shell argued --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not sure I know\nwhat it means to say it's a divisible harm.\nMS. SULLIVAN: It's capable of\napportionment. The restatement suggests in the cases\napplying this -- it says you ask at the first stage: Is\nthe harm capable of apportionment as a matter of law?\nAnd then as a matter of --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that means that\nwhatever percentage of responsibility the parties have,\nthat's the percentage of cost that they --\nMS. SULLIVAN: They should bear. But then\nthey -- it's up to the parties to prove a reasonable\nbasis for apportionment. But both Shell and the\nrailroads did argue, Justice Ginsburg -- put into\nevidence and argued at the district court that there\nshould be apportionment --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So does that mean\nthat, let's say, the -- how does that work when it costs\n$2 million to sort of start a clean-up, no matter who,\nand then, you know, the more stuff there is, the extra\nmillion it is? Is that -- is -- is the initial cost a\ndivisible harm?\nMS. SULLIVAN: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the\ndistrict court here was conservative. It allocated all\nof the costs, fixed and specific, to the parties. So\nthe conservative estimate of six percent for Shell, nine\npercent for the railroads, was based on the heroic\nassumption that a few drops spilled two football fields\naway of a volatile substance that evaporates twice as\nfast as water would be picked up by a rainfall that\ncould happen at the relevant quantities only once every\nten years according to our expert, once every seven\nyears according to the government's expert -- on the\nheroic assumption that all of those drips reached the\npond which created a single plume of contamination.\nAssuming that, then we award six percent or nine percent\nof liability.\nBut the point is there was record evidence,\nJustice Ginsburg -- and there is no need for a remand on\nthis. There was ample evidence for which the six\npercent and the nine percent could be -- we -- and we\ndidn't object and say we --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's not normally how\n-- when -- when someone has a burden of proof, it's a\nburden of coming forward. And the one thing that we do\nknow from this district judge is he's saying, I was left\nlargely to make it up. What he -- the components of his\nallocation did not come from -- yes, there is some\nevidence in the record. But ordinarily when you talk\nabout a party who has a burden of proof, we don't mean\nthey put in a piece here and a piece there and left it\nto the district judge to figure out.\nMS. SULLIVAN: Justice Ginsburg, there is no\nquestion that both the railroads and Shell argued for\nzero percent liability. But the same evidence that we\nput in and the proposed findings of fact -- for example,\nif you want to look at Docket Nos. 1317 and 1318,\nShell's proposed findings of fact did suggest a basis\nfor apportionment. So we met our burden of production\nas well as proof. But the -- to return to the question\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm really concerned about\nthe time and the white light, but I'm -- I'm not sure\nyou answered the Chief Justice's hypothetical about $2\nmillion, which is an initial clean-up that has to be\nexpended no matter how large the -- the spill was. How\ndid you discharge your burden of proof to show that that\nis not the case here or that that is divisible?\nMS. SULLIVAN: Justice Kennedy, here -- and\nI refer you to the Petitioner's appendix at page -- I'm\nsorry, to the joint appendix at page 288, to the expert\nKalinouski who described it as a single mass removal\nscheme.\nThis is not a case like a toxic soup case in\na landfill with 238 different chemicals that require\ndifferent extraction procedures. This is a case in\nwhich two chemicals reached the ground water and were to\nbe removed by a single mass extraction scheme, a single\n-- what the expert called at joint appendix 288 a mass\nremoval scheme. It was not disputed or argued on appeal\nthat there was a single remediation process. So this is\na simple case in which we are relying --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, we don't suppose that\nthat cost -- that single thing cost $2 million, and you\nwill have to hire that $2 million machine even if there\nis one drop. So for the cost of that machine it\ncouldn't matter if your client put in one drop and\nnobody else put in any, or the others put in 40 billion\ndrops. Can you allocate it? It would seem fair to\nallocate it, but I guess maybe in the restatement there\nis some law somewhere saying you can't, because it's\njust one single cost that takes place regardless.\nWhat's the state of the law on that? How do you --\nMS. SULLIVAN: May I answer? A reasonable\nbasis is all that's required. A practical approximation\nis appropriate here. Here the court did not distinguish\nbetween fixed capital costs and operating costs that\nmight matter in a different case. But the key point\nhere is that you should affirm as a matter of Federal\ncommon law that restatement 433(a) provides only a\ndemand for a reasonable basis and not exactitude. Thank\nyou very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
