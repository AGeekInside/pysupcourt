        "content": "(10:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Case 12-126, McQuiggin v. Perkins.\nMr. Bursch?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BURSCH: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nWe're not dealing here with the situation\nwhere a prisoner is trying to gather new evidence AEDPA\nhas a tolling rule to take care of that problem.\nWe're also not dealing with anything that prevents\nPetitioner from filing because that's the problem you\nsolved in Holland.\nWhat we have here is the question of when a\npetitioner must file his Federal habeas petition when he\nhas the evidence and there are no barriers to filing.\nAnd 2244(d)(1)(D) addresses that exact question. It\nsays, \"within 1 year.\"\nNow, Mr. Perkins asks for a fairly dramatic\nexpansion of Holland. What he wants is equitable\nabrogation with no diligence, no fault, or any other\nfactor. And our primary position is that you should\nsimply apply the plain language of 2244(d)(1)(D).\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Bursch, I thought\nthat -- that Perkins -- didn't he say that -- that you\ncould take into account -- I'm looking for the\nbrief -- you could take into account delay as a factor\nin whether his actual innocence gateway plea should be\nheard.\nMR. BURSCH: Well, he -- he does say that,\nand we read that as a concession that, sometimes, if you\nwait too long, that can actually trump a claim of actual\ninnocence. And so, at a minimum, our alternative\nposition is that you have to act with diligence.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's not quite what\nhe's saying. We've had a miscarriage of justice\nexception for as long as there's been a habeas statute.\nWe've applied it repeatedly.\nIt's not that it trumps it, but that it puts\ninto doubt the evidence you're claiming, proves your\nactual innocence. It's not the sort of situation where,\nas reasonable -- as due diligence will do, which is to\noverride even an actually innocent person.\nMR. BURSCH: Well, we think it --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What he says is it -- it\nreally puts into question the validity of your claim.\nMR. BURSCH: But, Justice Sotomayor,\nit -- it represents the same kind of principle, you've\ngot to act quickly, or adverse consequences can happen.\nBut what diligence does that his rule doesn't do is it\nrecognizes this compelling, countervailing State\ninterest in having notice and an opportunity to\ninvestigate evidence, as soon as it's discovered.\nNow -- and the problem here -- we don't have\nany issue at all, if it takes 10, 15, 100 years to find\nnew evidence, but once he has that evidence, the burden\nis on him to come forward, so that the State has the\nopportunity to investigate. And the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's a small point and\ndoesn't go to the general issues you have to discuss\nwith us, but just, on the small point, he gets -- I\nforget exactly the detail -- he gets an affidavit that\nJones did it within a year. He has one.\nMR. BURSCH: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, if I were the\nprisoner, I'd say -- you know, this one might not work.\nMaybe I can get two, and then he gets a second, which\nmakes a certain amount of sense to me -- although a\nsubstantial period of time elapses -- and the same thing\nhappens with the third.\nIt makes sense to me that the prisoner might\ntry to wait for the third. How -- how does that factor\ninto your diligence, assuming we get there?\nMR. BURSCH: Yes. Justice Kennedy, there's\na very simple solution to that problem. If he gets\nclose to the end of his year and he thinks that that\nnext affidavit might be just around the corner, but he\ndoesn't have it yet, all he has to do is file a\nprotective habeas petition with the district court, ask\nfor a stay, and say, I'm still diligently pursuing what\nI think is going to be another affidavit. And, if he\ncan't find that next affidavit, you litigate it on the\nmerits, and, if he does, then he amends his petition,\nand then you hear it.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not quite -- excuse\nme -- I'm not quite sure that wouldn't mean that you\nhave a whole raft of -- of petition-protective decisions\nwaiting on the shelf in the district court. That --\nthat -- that causes its own congestion problems in the\ndistrict court, it seems to me.\nMR. BURSCH: Two thoughts on that. First,\nwe already see this in the exhaustion area. There are\npetitioners who are concerned that, notwithstanding\nstatutory tolling for pursuing State remedies, that,\nwhile they're monkeying around in State court, they\nmight somehow be time-barred from bringing their Federal\nclaim.\nSo we see this all the time in the Sixth\nCircuit -- you know, in Michigan in particular, that\nsomeone will file their petition and -- and ask for a\nstay while they exhaust State remedies. So -- you know,\nthe pile really isn't going to be any different\nthan it is right now.\nBut the key difference between that scenario\nand the scenario that Perkins proposes is that, when you\nhave him file something, the State's on notice, they\nhave an opportunity to investigate.\nNow, here, we have his last affidavit from\nthe dry cleaning clerk, and it's 10 years old. So, even\nif Michigan could find that person, there's no way for\nus to meaningfully cross-examine her and investigate\nwhat she really knew or didn't know when she wrote that\naffidavit 10 years ago.\nAnd so with the file and stay, you preserve\nall of the rights, but, yet, you give the State the\ncountervailing interest that the statute was meant to\nprotect. And I do want to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What would it take to --\nwhat would it take to show diligence? And didn't he say\nthat he tried to get a lawyer, several times, and was\nunsuccessful?\nMR. BURSCH: Sure. And that's a very\npractical question that I'd like to address. Most of\nthe habeas petitioners don't have lawyers, but filing\nthe habeas petition itself is not something that takes\ngreat difficulty. Every district court, on their\nwebsite, has a place where you click for forms. In the\nEastern District of Michigan, when you click that, the\nvery first two entries are habeas petitions for Federal\nprisoners and State prisoners.\nAnd it's a relatively simple form. You\ncheck some boxes, say when your conviction was, and you\nwrite your claim. And then every Federal district court\nin the country has full-time pro se staff attorneys who\ngo through these pro se petitions.\nAnd, if there is a legitimate claim there,\nthen they can work that up for the judge, if necessary,\nand the State will respond. So --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I have some difficulty\nunderstanding what the Sixth Circuit was doing. And\nmaybe you can help me with that. The district court, as\nI understand it, said to the Petitioner, you lose for\ntwo reasons. First, you don't really have evidence of\nactual innocence, not enough anyway; and, second -- and\nI can understand that, because the evidence -- well,\nthat -- the most that is suggested by the affidavits is\nthat Jones was a participant in this murder, not that\nPerkins was not responsible for the murder.\nBut, anyway, so you lose for two reasons.\nFirst, you don't really have evidence of actual\ninnocence; second, you weren't diligent. The Sixth\nCircuit grants a certificate of appealability only on\nthe issue of diligence, and they say, diligence doesn't\nmake any difference.\nWell, where does that leave the petitioner?\nHe's already lost on the question of whether there's\nevidence of actual innocence, and there was no appeal on\nthat issue.\nMR. BURSCH: Well, we're very confused about\nthat, too. They do say, in their opinion, that the case\nis remanded to the district court to determine whether\nhe's got evidence of actual innocence. Now, as you just\npointed out, Judge Bell in the district court already\nmade that determination, so maybe they're contemplating\nan evidentiary hearing or some further investigation,\nbut it is curious because --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, that -- that may be\nwhat they're contemplating, but they can't get to the\nissue of whether the district court adequately addressed\nthe issue of adequate innocence -- of actual innocence,\nunless that issue is before them. And the issue isn't\nsupposed to be before them, unless -- isn't before them,\nunless the certificate of appealability was issued, and\nthere was no certificate of appealability on that issue.\nMR. BURSCH: We agree with that 100 percent,\nso --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was that -- was that\nargued to the -- to the Sixth Circuit? Did you argue in\nthe Sixth Circuit that, even assuming diligence, there\nwasn't enough here, and that's what the district court\nheld?\nMR. BURSCH: I believe that is the position\nof the State of Michigan, that because he confessed to\nhis friends, both before and after --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it -- it was\nexplicitly made to the Sixth Circuit?\nMR. BURSCH: I believe that the Sixth\nCircuit argument did focus on the question of diligence.\nBut -- you know, our opinion would be that, even if this\nCourt would use -- you know, what we call equitable\nabrogation, to kind of wipe away the 1-year limitations\nperiod, and you would also disagree on diligence, and we\ndon't think you should do that, that you would still\nreverse because there's nothing left to be done in the\ndistrict court.\nThis is not a case that rises to the very,\nvery high threshold of proving actual innocence, based\non new evidence. I would like to get back to the\nstatutory language.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Where does that leave\nus?\nMR. BURSCH: I --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's assume --\nMR. BURSCH: Well, that leaves you with a\nreversal in any of those three instances. We think that\nyou should address the circuit split, which is the\nimportant question of do we apply the limitations\nperiod. And, to turn to that, what I would like to do\nis set up an analytical construct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's sort of an advisory\nopinion, in your judgment.\nMR. BURSCH: Oh, no, it wouldn't be an\nadvisory opinion. It would --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Sure, it would be\nbecause you're telling us that there is no proof of\nactual innocence.\nMR. BURSCH: I'm saying that --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why don't we just say\nthat?\nMR. BURSCH: I'm saying that's an\nalternative ground to get to the same place, but the\nSixth Circuit's holding was, consistent with some other\ncircuits, that there is no statute of limitations here,\nthat you can get by with equitable abrogation, as we\ncall it.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It might be its holding,\nbut, as Justice Alito just proved, there's no basis for\nit because they didn't grant a COA on the substantive\nmerits question.\nMR. BURSCH: Right. I -- I think you're\nwholly within your right to address the merits question,\nand I would like to turn to that.\nThe analytical construct I want to set up is\nthat we've got three different categories of prisoners\nwho claim actual innocence, based on new evidence. In\nthe first category, they used that new evidence only to\ntry to establish innocence with no constitutional claim.\nAnd, in Herrera, you say no Federal habeas remedy for\nthat; you have to go back to the State courts, executive\nclemency, prosecutorial discharging of verdicts, and\nthings like that.\nThe second category is where you have a\nprisoner who uses new evidence as a gateway. It's not\nrelated to the constitutional claim that they assert --\nthe true Schlup gateway. And that's not actually this\ncase, either, and you could reserve that question,\nalthough I'm happy to talk about that.\nThe case we have here is the third instance,\nwhere the evidence of actual innocence -- the new\nevidence, is the factual predicate for the claim. And\nyou could not find a provision more on all fours with\nthat category than what Congress did in 2244(d)(1)(D).\nAnd we know that Congress was thinking about actual\ninnocence in Schlup.\nFor those of you who are interested in the\ncontext, in the legislative debate in '95 and '96,\nbefore AEDPA's enactment, we have Senators Feingold and\nKennedy and Dodd, among others, talking about how this\nnew statute is going to eliminate claims of actual\ninnocence based on new evidence. In fact, Senator\nFeingold even mentioned the Schlup decision.\nAnd, yet, Congress adopts 2244(d)(1)(D) and\nall the rest of the provisions by a 91 to 8 vote. So\nCongress had this Court's decision in Schlup in the back\nof its mind, it considered this particular construct and\nit said, no, we want a 1-year limitations period.\nI do want to --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Your -- your three-way\nclassification, you began with Herrera?\nMR. BURSCH: Correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and, in a way,\nyou're saying that you're three loops back in the\nHerrera a bit because, here, the innocence is the\nfactual predicate.\nMR. BURSCH: Right. And, in the Herrera\ncase, there is no constitutional claim, so there is no\nfactual predicate. It's just a stand-alone \"I'm\ninnocent\" claim. And this Court has said, appropriately\nso, that the Federal habeas remedy doesn't cover that.\nYou know, if you think about the remedies\nyou can get from State courts, from prosecutors, from\nexecutive clemency, it's a rather big circle, and AEDPA\nis a much smaller circle that's subsumed in that. And\nyou recognize, in Herrera, that, just because you don't\nfall within the habeas circle, doesn't mean that you\ncan't get relief.\nIn fact, if you look at the examples that\nthe amici briefs cite on the Respondent's side, in\nalmost every case, the final decision is motivated by\nState action. There's a governor who grants clemency in\na couple of cases, there's a State attorney general's\noffice that dismisses charges in others, county\nprosecutors who do the same. One, which the amicus\nbrief characterizes as a habeas grant, is actually the\nIllinois Court of Appeals in a State proceeding\nreversing.\nYou know, what the -- these are the best\nexamples that they have for why you need an equitable\nabrogation rule, and, yet, in the vast majority of those\ncases, it's the State system that's solving the problem.\nNow, I do want to go back to what I think\nis -- is the trickiest question, and that's,\nJustice Kennedy, the second category of prisoners, those\nwho are using actual innocence to prove, not their\nunderlying constitutional claim, but, simply, the Schlup\ngateway. And I would respectfully submit that, even\nthere, Congress has closed the door with 2244(d)(1)(D).\nAnd the best way to understand that is by\nlooking two subprovisions earlier in the second and\nsuccessive petitions category. And this argument that\nI'm going to make now is a little bit different than the\nway we -- we did it in the brief, which was -- you know,\nthey had it there, they -- they don't have it here.\nIf you look at 2244 --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Before you present the\nargument --\nMR. BURSCH: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- you are saying that\nCongress overruled Schlup; is that what -- the point\nyou're making?\nMR. BURSCH: The -- the contextual point\nthat I was making was that Congress knew about Schlup,\nit was brought up in the debate that this was,\nessentially, changing the Schlup rule and allowing\nsomeone who claims actual innocence not to present their\nclaim, and Congress swept those objections aside by a 91\nto 8 vote.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that was with\nrespect to successive petitions.\nMR. BURSCH: No, they were talking in the --\nthe legislative record, just generally, about actual\ninnocence and claims of miscarriage of justice.\nSo -- so the textual argument that I want to\npresent involving successive petitions is that, when\nyou're looking at 2244, you flow from successive\npetitions down to the statute of limitations.\nWhat that means is that, if you have a\nsuccessive petition, Congress requires you to prove\nactual innocence and diligence, and you still have to\nprove that you satisfied the statute of limitations.\nThe Seventh Circuit recognized this in the Escamilla\ncase.\nSo what that means is that, even when\nCongress had a situation where they knew that someone\nhad presented evidence that would satisfy a heightened\nactual innocence standard, they still required that you\nsatisfy the statute of limitations.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where is that in\nthe text? What are you relying on in the text of 2244?\nMR. BURSCH: I'm relying on 2244(b), which\nis the successive petition provision. It requires you\nto, first, prove that you've got evidence of actual\ninnocence and then also demonstrate that you had\ndiligence.\nAnd, after you're already gotten through\nwhat I'll call the actual innocence statutory gateway,\nyou're still required to satisfy the statute of\nlimitations. If Congress was concerned about Schlup and\nwanted to make a situation where someone with evidence\nof actual innocence did not have to comply with the\nlimitations period, they would have put an exception in\nthe successive petition subprovision and they didn't do\nthat, so --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you don't have\n2244(b)in your brief, do you?\nMR. BURSCH: Unfortunately, the text is not\nthere, no.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That is very -- that is\nunfortunate.\nMR. BURSCH: Yes. Well, as we explained in\nthe briefs, the fact --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If you're relying on it, I\nmean.\nMR. BURSCH: Well, as we explained in the\nbriefs, both parties rely on that. The fact that you\nhave an actual innocence exception only two\nsubprovisions earlier is strong reason to think Congress\ndidn't intend it here.\nBut I'm making a different argument now,\nwhich is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Go\nahead.\nMR. BURSCH: Which is simply that Congress\nconsidered the -- the instance where you've establish a\nstatutory actual innocence gateway in (b)(2), the\nsuccessive petition, and still require that it be timely\nfiled, because the State's interest in having notice and\nan opportunity to investigate is so important.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But are -- are you saying\nthat this case is a fortiori from a successive petition?\nBecause this isn't a successive petition.\nMR. BURSCH: No, this is not. What I'm\nusing the successive petition provision to demonstrate\nis that, consistent with the legislative history,\nCongress is demonstrating here, in 2244(d)(1)(D), that\nthere is no special actual innocence --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You don't see a\ndifference -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you're saying that\nCongress knows how to write --\nMR. BURSCH: Yes, I am --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- an exception if -- if\nthey want it. But this (b) does apply to successive\npetitions and this is really before that.\nMR. BURSCH: Well, my -- my point is that,\nif Congress anticipated that actual innocence could be a\ngateway to circumvent the limitations period, then\ncertainly they would have put that exception in the\nsuccessive petition of (b)(2) where they said, all\nright, if you establish actual innocence, we're still\ngoing to make you comply with the limitations period.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, now, your\nfriend on the other side, I think, argues that that --\nthey put that in expressly because they limited what\nwould be the otherwise applicable miscarriage of justice\nprovision in the question that's before us now.\nMR. BURSCH: Right. And if you would --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is your -- what\nis your answer to that?\nMR. BURSCH: If he was right about that,\nthen in (b), you would also see another provision that\nsays and anyone who satisfies this statutory actual\ninnocence standard doesn't have to comply with the\nlimitations period. And we think that -- that's\ndispositive.\nNow -- you know, when we --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. I don't\nunderstand. I mean, there is a presumption that's been\nlongstanding that, at least with respect to the filing\nof your first petition, that it is a statute of\nlimitations subject to exceptions, including the\nmanifest injustice one.\nIt would seem to me that if they intended\nnot to have that apply, they would have done what they\ndid with the successive petition, but they chose not to.\nMR. BURSCH: Justice Sotomayor, the history\nof this statute and of the case law isn't quite that\nway. And I want to draw a sharp distinction between\nthis case and Holland, with respect to history. With\nrespect to equitable tolling, you did have decisions\ngoing back to the 1800s recognizing that Federal\nstatutes of limitation in all kinds of contexts, civil\nand criminal, were subject to equitable tolling.\nAnd so then, in Irwin, 6 years before AEDPA,\nyou actually create a presumption that, if Congress\ndoesn't specifically -- you know, exclude equitable\ntolling --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not talking about\nthat presumption.\nMR. BURSCH: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What I'm talking\nabout --\nMR. BURSCH: Now, I'm going to move to\nmiscarriage of justice.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- are cause and effect\nand manifest injustice.\nMR. BURSCH: Yes. So the cause and effect,\nthe manifest injustice, the actual innocence, really\nstarts to develop in 1986, and it comes to fruition in\nSchlup in 1995, right before AEDPA is passed.\nImportantly, that exception was always applied to\ncourt-created procedural bars, never once to a Federal\nstatute of limitations.\nAnd, obviously, the separation of powers\nconsiderations are quite different when you're talking\nabout a court-created exception to a court-created bar.\nThe first is a bar that's enforced by Congress itself.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But you're creating a world\nin which this would function as an exception to a State\ntime limit, but not to the AEDPA time limit.\nMR. BURSCH: That's correct.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Why does that make any\nsense?\nMR. BURSCH: Because it was the Court itself\nthat created the judicial exception to the State filing.\nAnd so then -- or, I'm sorry, that created the bar with\nrespect to the State filing. And so then it was\ncompletely within the Court's power to make an exception\nto that bar.\nBut, again, here, the separation of powers\nconsiderations militate differently when you're talking\nabout Congress doing the telling, and this Court has\nacknowledged, in Launcher and Dodd and other places,\nthat Congress gets to set the parameters of habeas.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But I thought we said, in\nMissouri v. Holland, that AEDPA was -- was enacted\nagainst a background rule, which stated that normal\nequitable principles, such as this one, which had been\napplied everywhere to all procedural bars, that AEDPA\nsuggested that those would -- that AEDPA was\nagainst a background that those would continue to apply.\nMR. BURSCH: Well, it was a very short\nbackground, one with no Irwin-like presumption and one\nthat, again, had never ever been applied to a Federal\nstatute of limitations. And --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But why is a Federal statute\nof limitations any different?\nMR. BURSCH: Because it's Congress and\nCongress is the one that's handcuffing the Court with\nrespect to the scope of the --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, but, again, it's\nCongress but we said, in Holland, that it's Congress\nand AEDPA has -- has -- was drafted against this\npresumption that normal equitable principles would\napply.\nMR. BURSCH: But here's another way to think\nabout it -- you know, if you imagine the -- the template\nthat you have on your Microsoft Word, when you're doing\na document, an opinion, whatever, you've got certain\nstuff that's on the template. And you said, in Irwin,\nthat when it comes to equitable tolling, you've always\ngot a subprovision Z, call it, in every Federal statute\nof limitations that appears on that template, And so\nCongress has to do something affirmatively to strike\nthat out.\nBecause the miscarriage of justice exception\nhad never been applied to any Federal -- Federal statute\nof limitations, there wasn't a miscarriage of justice\nexception sitting on the template. Congress was writing\nfrom scratch.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, again, why would\nCongress have thought that there would be any difference\nin -- with respect to a statute of limitations?\nMR. BURSCH: Well, the biggest reason is\nbecause of the State interest in notice and\ninvestigating the evidence. When you're talking about\nthe typical Schlup claim --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But that applies to States,\nas well.\nMR. BURSCH: Well, no, there -- there you\nhave stale claims, but you don't have stale evidence.\nAnd -- you know, we -- we don't have any problem with\nlitigating a claim that could have been litigated\nearlier and is going to be litigated now. But the world\nof evidence, the record that supports the claim, is\nalready defined and is not going to change.\nThe world we're dealing with in\n2244(d)(1)(D) is when new stuff has come forward, and,\nif that new stuff sits in the jailhouse cell for 10, 20,\n30 years and we don't have an opportunity to talk to\nthose witnesses, to do counter-investigation, then not\nonly are we prejudiced with respect to delay and\nfinality and things like that, but we're prejudiced with\nrespect to the merits determination of what that\nevidence means.\nAnd, when I talked about my three\nconstructs -- you know, this case, here, where you're\nusing the old evidence to establish the underlying\nclaim, that's really the position where the State is in\nthe worst possible position because, now, you've got\na -- you know, the dry cleaning clerk affidavit -- a\n10-year-old affidavit -- we can't possibly cross-examine\nher, and, yet, not only is that their gateway, that's\ntheir substantive merits claim about why there is\nineffective assistance of counsel.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why can't you\ncross-examine her? Is it just because the lapse of time\nand she won't remember?\nMR. BURSCH: It'll be very difficult. And\nthere are some examples in the amici briefs of the New\nYork case, for example, where witnesses were completely\nunavailable. They had died, or one was out of State\nand, because of mental infirmities, could not travel.\nYou know, we all know that, as time passes,\nevidence deteriorates, whether it's because of -- of\ndeath or illness or simply forgetfulness. I certainly\ncan't remember what I was doing 10 years ago today. And\nthe affidavit that she submitted was quite short. And\nthat one affidavit is just a microcosm of the problem\nwhen you don't come forward immediately with evidence.\nOne other point that I want to make, really,\non the equities here because we're spending a lot of\ntime on that -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you have any idea how\nmany actual innocence claims win on the underlying\nconstitutional issue?\nMR. BURSCH: Right. The number that win is\nsmall. But what this case demonstrates is that the\nnumber where it's claimed is very high. In fact, in\nMichigan -- you know, where we deal with procedural\ndefault every day, somewhere between a third and a half\nof our petitioners claimed actual innocence, so that\nthey can use Schlup to get past the -- the failure to\nprove cause and prejudice.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How many wins on the\nattempt?\nMR. BURSCH: Well, in the Sixth Circuit, a\nlittle more than in some other circuits, but, generally,\nnot very many --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Not many.\nMR. BURSCH: -- you know. But this case is\nthe perfect example. When you cut the court loose from\nthe statutory requirement, you end up with what\nJustice Alito is describing -- you know, a situation\nwhere no one thinks that Mr. Perkins is actually\ninnocent based on this new evidence; at best, it proves\nthat he had a co-conspirator who helped him commit the\nmurder together.\nAnd, yet, now, we've got the Sixth Circuit order,\nwhich purportedly sends us back to the trial court to\ndo -- you know, who knows what? I mean, how do you\nprove that he's not innocent? Well, a jury already did\nthat.\nYou know, The jury heard all the evidence.\nThey had a presumption of innocence. All the\nconstitutional rules that should have been were applied\nto that trial, and the jury said he's guilty, and\nthere's not a presumption of innocence anymore.\nAnd -- and the equitable point that I wanted\nto touch on is that this is not just about prejudicing\nthe State's interest. If you allow claims like these to\ngo forward, it also prejudices those who have legitimate\nclaims of actual innocence, the needle in the haystack.\nAnd Justices O'Connor and Kennedy, in their\nHerrera concurrence, talked about the haystack problem,\nthat, when you keep adding hay to that pile, not only is\nit harder to find the needle, the truly meritorious\nclaim, but, at some point, the Federal judges just give\nup, and they stop looking.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why -- why is it that\nthe meritorious claim is going to be the one that's\ngoing to be hidden?\nMR. BURSCH: Because there are so many.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Meaning --\nMR. BURSCH: It's important to understand\nthat -- that, notwithstanding the limits that Congress\nwas trying to put on these habeas petitions when it\nenacted AEDPA, that we actually have more habeas filings\non an annual basis today than we did before AEDPA was\nenacted. It's not going to stop the filing.\nThis is just one small rule to cut the\nhaystack down a little bit and make it that much easier\nto find the needle. And, if you can find that\noccasional needle -- and we submit there's not a lot of\nthose -- Federal judges are going to be more inclined to\nlook for those.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you would -- you\nwant to keep it out altogether.\nMR. BURSCH: No.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You want an actually --\npotentially actually innocent person not to have --\nMR. BURSCH: No, that is not our position.\nAnd I want to be really clear about this. First,\nthey've got the year, but, if they go past the year,\nthey've got the State system. And what the examples in\nthe amici briefs demonstrate is that --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But they don't have the\nFederal system.\nMR. BURSCH: No, they don't.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: As the first habeas.\nMR. BURSCH: But, as the Alabama amici brief\nexplains, every State has got a process for hearing these\nclaims, no matter how old they are. You've also got\nthe -- the prosecutors who look at these and they don't\nwant to keep innocent people in jail.\nAnd then, lastly, you've got clemency, which\nthis Court has always recognized as the remedy for those\nwho assert true, actual innocence, but have no\nconstitutional violation to assert.\nUnless there are further questions, I would\nlike to reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Readler?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CHAD A. READLER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. READLER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nI would like to start with Justice Kagan's\nquestion regarding the important background interpretive\nprinciple here that's set out -- set out in Holland.\nThere, the Court held that longstanding equitable rules\nin the habeas context are incorporated into AEDPA,\nbarring a clear command by Congress to the contrary.\nAnd the longstanding miscarriage of justice\nexception has had a well-settled meaning. It has\nallowed petitioners, who can meet the high standing of\nshowing actual innocence, a procedural gateway around a\nprocedural bar to allow them to present their otherwise\nbarred constitutional claims in Federal court.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Before you proceed with\nthat, can you address Justice Alito's point that the\ndistrict court said there is no merit to this; it's not\nan actual innocence -- it's not a valid actual innocence\nclaim. And then the Sixth Circuit sends it back for the\ndistrict court to decide something it's already decided?\nHow do you overcome that the Sixth Circuit\nnever reviewed the actual innocence question, the\ndistrict court did and said this doesn't make it?\nMR. READLER: That's correct, Justice\nGinsburg. And, with respect to Justice Alito's\nquestion, the reform recommendation from the magistrate\ndenied this petition on statute of limitations grounds\nsolely. It said it was too late, and it missed the\nstatutory period.\nAt the district court level, the court held\nthat the statute of limitations was missed and that\nthere was no diligence; the court believed there was a\ndiligence requirement, and so the petition failed for\nthat reason.\nAnd then, as Justice Alito noted, the court\nadded some other language, which said -- was not a\nweighing of the evidence, but the court said that it\nfelt that the evidence was not new, in the sense that it\nwas reasonably -- potentially reasonably known at the\ntime of trial, which I think is one -- was, one, the\nwrong legal standard, but, two, was a misinterpretation\nof Schlup because Schlup allows you to consider all the\nevidence, old and new.\nAnd I don't think that's what the\ndistrict -- the district court I think applied the wrong\nlegal standard, so it wasn't actually getting to the\nmerits. It didn't sort of set out all the evidence and\nweigh them.\nAnd then, Justice Ginsburg, you are correct\nthat this was not part of the certificate of\nappealability. The certificate of appealability was\nlimited on the narrow question of whether there was a\ndiligence requirement.\nThat factual issue was not before the Sixth\nCircuit and hasn't -- it is not before this Court as\nwell, and what I think this Court should do is what it\ndid in Schlup, which is announce the standard that\nwould apply and then it remanded the case back to the\ndistrict court for application of the correct standards.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I don't understand\nthat. The district court -- or you seem to suggest the\ndistrict court was wrong in saying that there wasn't\nsufficient evidence for an actual innocence claim.\nMaybe that's the case. Maybe it was wrong.\nBut, if it decided that issue and the issue\nwasn't appealed, then the issue is settled. And that's\nthe problem that I see. Now, how do you get around\nthat?\nMR. READLER: Right. Justice Alito, I don't\nread the Sixth -- or I don't read the district court as\nactually getting to the merits. I think it applied a\nwrong legal rule and said, I can't even consider the\nevidence because it's not new evidence. I think that\nwas an erroneous interpretation.\nUnder Schlup, the -- the Court has said many\ntimes that the court can consider all the evidence old\nand new. And I think that case really turns on the --\nthe equitable tolling of --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Did you ask for a\ncertificate -- what other issues did you ask for a\ncertificate of appealability on?\nMR. READLER: Well, our client was acting\npro se.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What -- what other issues\ndid he ask for a certificate on?\nMR. READLER: Justice Alito, I don't -- I\ndon't have that in front of me. I don't recall the full\ncontours of what he requested. The certificate -- the\nSixth Circuit granted it on the one narrow issue of\nwhether diligence was a requirement.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you say, on\npage 17 of your brief, that this Court has applied the\nmanifest-injustice exception to limits created by\nCongress. What's your best case for that?\nMR. READLER: Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice.\nThose cases are on pages 36 to 38 of the red brief, and\nI think my friend and I have a disagreement here. It's\ntrue that the -- the rule has never been applied to the\nstatute of limitations because there was no statute of\nlimitations for AEDPA before the statute, but the Court\nhas applied the exception to acts of Congress. It did\nso in Sanders.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what do you\nmean, acts of Congress? Your sentence says, applied at\nthe limits created by Congress. I read that to mean\nstatutes of limitations. But that's wrong?\nMR. READLER: Mr. Chief Justice, that --\nthat's incorrect, in the sense that there was no Federal\nstatute of limitations before AEDPA, but the Court had\napplied the miscarriage of justice exception to acts of\nCongress. So, for instance, in Sanders, the -- Congress\nhad included, in 2244, an ends-of-justice provision\nwhich seemed to allow the Court to consider the ends of\njustice when considering whether to hear a successive\npetition, which is, essentially, the equivalent of\nmiscarriage of justice.\nIt did not include that language in 2255,\nand, yet, the Court read 2255 as also including the\nends-of-justice requirement, hence the miscarriage of\njustice, even though the language wasn't there.\nIn Kuhlmann --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: With 2255 -- remind\nme?\nMR. READLER: For Federal -- Federal\npetitions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And said what with\nrespect to time --\nMR. READLER: For Federal -- Federal\nconvictions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Said what with\nrespect to the time limits?\nMR. READLER: There were -- there were --\nthere was language in both -- in both statutes regarding\nwhen you could bring a successive petition. The -- the\nstatute that applied to petitions out of State judgment,\n2254, included an ends-of-justice provision, which said\nthe court could consider the ends of justice in deciding\nwhether to take a second or successive petition.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so, when you\nsaid limits, you didn't mean time limits; you meant\nsubstantive limits?\nMR. READLER: Substantive -- well, no.\nProcedural limits, procedural limits on -- procedural\nlimits.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Procedural limits.\nDo you have a case that applies it to time limits?\nWhich, of course, is the question we have here.\nMR. READLER: We do. In -- in -- now, these\nwould be State time limits, but --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. But you said\nlimits created by Congress. So just -- I mean, I should\nread \"limits created by Congress\" not to mean time\nlimits, but procedural or other limits.\nMR. READLER: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there\nhave never been any time limits --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. And I guess\nthat's the point of my questioning and your friend's\nposition. There have never been any time limits created\nby Congress that have been abrogated by a\nmanifest-injustice exception.\nMR. READLER: I think I can agree with that\nbecause there was never a statute of limitations before\nAEDPA. But --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. And the\ndifference is, in Holland, we are dealing with equitable\ntolling, which had applied as far back as -- you know,\nwhatever the law goes to limitations; in other words,\nequitable tolling, which is different from the\nabrogation, I think, that you are asking for.\nMR. READLER: Well, I don't think so,\nMr. Chief Justice. Two responses, first, with respect\nto the timing issue, the Court had applied the\nmiscarriage-of-justice exception to abusive petitions.\nSo there is a timing concern invoked there\nbecause you're filing a second petition when you could\nhave raised issues earlier. And the Court has said,\neven in that timing context, not a statute of\nlimitations, but it certainly invokes timing concerns,\nthat even, in that instance, the miscarriage of justice\nwould still overcome the rule.\nNow, what --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, you are asking for\nwhat is, potentially, a very big exception to the 1-year\nstatute of limitations. If you took a poll of all of\nthe prisoners in Michigan, how many of them do you think\nwould say they are actually innocent?\nMR. READLER: Justice Alito, I suspect very\nfew of them could credibly say --\nJUSTICE ALITO: \"Very few\" would say they\nare actually innocent?\nMR. READLER: Well, I haven't done that\nstudy. I suspect very few of them would say that\nthey -- credibly say that they are actually innocent.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Oh, \"credibly say.\" But how\nmany would say that they are actually innocent? A lot.\nAnd a lot would be able to come up with evidence that is\nequal to -- to what the petition -- what the Respondent\nhere has come up with.\nNow, do you think it's -- it's plausible\nthat Congress, in establishing this new 1-year statute\nof limitations, because it doesn't want these things to\ndrag on indefinitely, intended to create an exemption\nthat broad, so that anybody who claims to be actually\ninnocent can at least get over -- can get to the point\nwhere the Court has to decide whether the -- has to\nweigh this evidence of actual innocence, to see whether\nit -- it gets over the threshold?\nMR. READLER: Sure -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is that plausible, given\nwhat Congress was trying to do in AEDPA?\nMR. READLER: Absolutely, Justice Alito, for\ntwo reasons. First of all, the background presumption,\nof course, given the established nature of this\nexception -- in fact, on Mr. Chief Justice's question,\nwhile this exception, as compared to equitable tolling\nin the criminal context, I think is actually more\nimportant because it goes to the ultimate equity, and\nthat is innocence.\nBut the background presumption is that\nCongress includes these foundational equitable rules, of\nwhich the miscarriage of justice exception is absolutely\none of them, unless Congress expressly says otherwise.\nNow, Justice Alito, no -- no petitioner is\ngoing to want to find themselves in the Schlup world,\nwhere they missed the statute of limitations. It is not\na place they are going to want to be. They are going to\nabsolutely want to file within a year, if they can.\nSometimes, they miss that -- that period,\nand what the Court has said, in those rare circumstances\nwhere you can make a credible, compelling showing of\nactual innocence, we will allow you around the statute\nof limitations. But no petitioner wants to be in that\ncircumstance because the Schlup standard is so high.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's -- I'm\nnot sure that's right. They don't want to definitely\nfile within one year, if they don't have anything to\nsay. You know, if it takes a certain amount of time\nbefore they either acquire it legitimately or can find\nsomebody or -- I don't know, in this case -- you know,\nthe codefendant dies, everybody has no reason any\nmore -- you know, to object and pin it on him.\nThere are a lot of reasons that it's in some\nof these prisoners' interest to drag things out and then\nto file. They don't have anything to say within the one\nyear and need time to either, from your point of view,\nlegitimately develop the evidence or, from your friend's\npoint of view, to concoct it.\nMR. READLER: Well -- and the statue speaks\nto that. I mean, I think we do have a disagreement on\nthe interpretation of the statute, but Section\n2244(d)(1)(D) does speak to the discovery of new\nevidence which goes to support a claim. I think\nCongress --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the statute of\nlimitations would run from the discovery of the new\nevidence, not from --\nMR. READLER: That's -- that's correct,\nJustice Ginsburg, to the extent that the evidence goes\nto support a claim. Congress included a typical\ndiscovery rule. If you've discovered new evidence\nthat -- that supports the factual underpinnings of your\nclaim, that starts the one-year period over again.\nBut, critically -- and I think my friend and\nI have a disagreement here -- critically, with respect\nto that provision, if you find evidence that solely goes\nto your innocence, that provision is not triggered,\nmeaning you don't get another year if you find\ncompletely exculpatory evidence that shows you're not\ninnocent, you don't -- you don't necessarily get another\nyear.\nAnd there's a hypothetical I can give you.\nIf your underlying claim is a Batson claim, a\nstructural error claim, and you fail to raise it, and\nyou missed the one-year limitations period, but then, 10\nyears later, you find DNA evidence that completely\nexonerates your client that was unknown to anyone, so\nit's not the basis for an IEC claim, it's not the basis\nfor prosecutorial misconduct, in that instance, the\nstatute doesn't start the limitations period over.\nYou're entirely out of luck, which is why\nCongress had to have meant to include the absolute --\nthe innocence exception for just that kind of case, so\nthat that petitioner at least has the ability to try to\nmeet the Schlup standard.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But that's very odd because,\nif you have somebody who's actually innocent, then\nyou're saying that person can't get out of prison,\nunless the person happens to have a good constitutional\nclaim that's totally unrelated to the fact that the\nperson is actually innocent.\nThat's just very odd, isn't it.\nMR. READLER: Well, I don't think so,\nJustice Alito, in the sense that all this is, is a\ngateway to allow them their first opportunity to bring a\nFederal habeas petition. Ordinarily, they're out of\nluck.\nBut, if they brought evidence that is so\ncompelling, that shows that there may well have been a\nmiscarriage of justice because this person has shown,\nunder the Schlup standard that they're actually innocent,\nthen, in that instance, the Court has always said that\nwe're going to allow those claims to be heard, at least\nin the first instance, by -- by a Federal court for a\nfirst petition.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your friend responds\nto that point, I think, by saying that every State\nallows collateral review in that instance and that what\nwe're talking about is simply preclusion of the second\nbite at the apple -- or a third bite at the apple, I\nguess, by -- by assumption, in the Federal system.\nMR. READLER: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm\nnot sure that's practical, to the extent that we've\nalready raised our underlying constitutional claims in\nthe State court. Those have been exhausted. So the\nMichigan rule, as I read it, doesn't allow us to go back\nto State court and present our constitutional claims\nagain. They've already been adjudicated.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the\nactual innocence claim?\nMR. READLER: The innocence evidence may --\nyou may be able to pursue that under -- under the --\nunder the State rule, but that is more akin to a\nfreestanding --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that the most --\nis that the most -- I thought I understood your friend\nto say -- he can correct me if I'm wrong -- that every\nState has an avenue for considering that.\nMR. READLER: Well, two responses. One, I\nthink every State has different rules and so this -- the\napplication of the exception is never turned on sort of\nwhat the alternative potential State rule is. That\nwasn't -- that was true in House and true in Schlup,\nwhere there were State alternatives.\nBut, two, those State alternatives go to\nfreestanding innocence claims, where you're not --\nyou're not alleging that there's an underlying\nconstitutional violation.\nWhat you're saying is similar to Herrera,\nand that is that I have evidence that shows, setting\naside any error of the trial, no errors, I have evidence\nthat shows I'm innocent. That's a completely different\nconcept. And what we're getting at here is the case\nwhere you wanted evidence of innocence and, two, have a\nconstitutionally corrupt trial -- or at least an\nallegation of a constitutionally corrupt trial.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I see --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, assuming for the sake\nof argument that there is this exception, why shouldn't\ndiligence be required? How can it be equitable to allow\nsomeone to bring a claim when the person has --\ninvolving new evidence, when the person has not been\ndiligent in presenting this new evidence to the court?\nMR. READLER: Well, Justice Alito, for\ndecades, this Court has never required diligence and, in\nfact, in McCloskey, has expressly rejected it, and the\nCourt has noted that diligence has not historically been\nrequired under the standard because, as the Court said\nin House and Calderon, that Congress raised the bar in\ntwo places on the statute.\nBut the reason why is because, as\nJustice O'Connor said in her concurring opinion with --\nwith -- in Withrow, with Chief Justice Rehnquist, is\nthat innocence is the ultimate equity. And it trumps --\ndiligence is not the ultimate equity, it's innocence.\nAnd if -- if a petitioner can come forward\nand make a credible showing of actual innocence, that,\nstanding alone, has always been enough to allow a\nFederal court to at least go ahead and then reach the\nunderlying claim.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You have a larger -- you\nhave a larger category, you say miscarriage of justice,\nso one is actual innocence. You say the category is\nwell defined. So what else would fit under this -- and\nwe can bring it up very late in the -- in the day.\nAnything else other than actual innocence would be in\nthis category?\nMR. READLER: Justice Ginsburg, I think the\nCourt has always treated the phrase \"miscarriage of\njustice\" as synonymous with actual innocence, and\nthat's -- that's the one thing it's getting at. It's a\nnarrow exception, it's difficult to meet, but -- but\nit's always included cases where you can make -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are bribed jurors not a\nmiscarriage of justice?\nMR. READLER: I'm sorry, Justice --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: A juror who's bribed, is\nthere no -- no miscarriage of justice there?\nMR. READLER: Well, that would, presumably,\nbe the basis for a habeas claim.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But we're -- we're talking\nabout the meaning of the term \"miscarriage of justice.\"\nIt seems to me there -- there are many serious errors\nthat can be described by that general phrase.\nMR. READLER: Well, Justice Kennedy, I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you want to say it's a\nterm of art? Fine.\nMR. READLER: Justice Kennedy, I'm relying\non the Court's decades of decisions, many of which\nyou've written in this area, where they've described\nmiscarriage of justice in the habeas setting as the\nequivalent of incarceration of an innocent person, and\nthat's what the exception is -- is getting at.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So does this boil down\nto -- I mean, you have a one-year statute of\nlimitations. Now, I guess -- suppose Hurricane Katrina\ncame along and threw all the documents away for two\nmonths. I guess the Court could extend it, couldn't it?\nMR. READLER: Well, that could be viewed as\nan impediment under -- under the -- under the statute,\nthere's a statutory provision for --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, I mean, don't they\ntoll it when there's some -- when the courthouse burns\ndown?\nMR. READLER: It could be also a basis for\nequitable tolling, correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So you want to\nsay and that's also true when the person is actually\ninnocent, if you can prove that, delay it. Is that what\nyou're saying?\nMR. READLER: I'm not sure if I fully\nunderstand the question.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, he has his one year,\nand he gives four criteria, and the four criteria,\nsometimes, are not exclusive. And you want to say yours\nis one of the times.\nMR. READLER: That's -- that's true.\nThey're not exclusive. And a --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And a different one you say\nis when he's actually innocent.\nMR. READLER: That's -- that's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. If that's\ncorrect, then suppose that he purposely has delayed\nfiling this until everybody's dead, so they know they\ncan't prove it anymore.\nMR. READLER: Well, then that raises a\nwhole --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what is your answer?\nMR. READLER: -- different range of --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right he, can he toll it\nunder those circumstances?\nMR. READLER: Well, any -- as the Court said\nin Schlup, the timing of the submission by the\nPetitioner can certainly be considered in the Schlup\nanalysis, so --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So the answer is, in your\nview, if he deliberately and -- and, without cause,\ndelays it for 5 years, his filing, just so everybody\nwill die, you would say, okay, I'm not worried about\nhim?\nMR. READLER: Well, Justice Breyer, I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that right? Would you,\nor wouldn't you?\nMR. READLER: I would say -- I would say\nthat he can still attempt to avail himself of the\nsettled miscarriage of justice exception, but the huge\nproblem he's going to run into --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Does he win or lose?\nMR. READLER: He likely -- he may well lose.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, what do you think?\nMR. READLER: He may well lose at the Schlup\nstage.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I didn't ask that. I said\nwhat do you think?\nMR. READLER: Well, I don't have all the\nfacts. I suspect he's going to lose.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, you do. I made up the\nhypothetical.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. READLER: Well, Justice Breyer, on those\nfacts, I'm going to say he loses at the Schlup stage\nbecause Schlup, which is, one, an incredibly high bar to\nmeet, but, two, the Court expressly said, at page 322 of\nthe opinion, that it could consider the timing of the\nevidence when it's submitted.\nSo it already takes into account any sort of\ngame-playing that petitioner may engage in when they're\ntrying to assert their -- their innocence.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But they admit --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And how long did\nyour -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm just trying to -- they\nadmit that, if he's diligent, it's okay?\nMR. READLER: The -- the State?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. READLER: Well, the State --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do you believe he's\ndiligent?\nMR. READLER: We believe he's diligent. The\nState is asking for a diligence requirement that the\nCourt has never imposed.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So the State is asking for\na diligence requirement. You admit that there's a\nrequirement that -- that you have to not really use this\nas a sham device, so we're pretty close.\nMR. READLER: Well, there's -- there's never\nbeen a diligence requirement in this setting because\nthat's not been the focus.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But there has --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But there is a sham --\nthere is a sham and deliberate delay requirement, not a\ndiligence one, but there is a sham. I'm not trying to\ntrick you.\nMR. READLER: No, but --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What I'm trying to say is\nmaybe we're arguing about something that we could solve;\nthat is, in fact, many of these people don't have\nlawyers. They don't understand the statute of\nlimitations, they don't understand what diligence might\nconsist of looking later. You agree that it's -- it\nshouldn't be a sham, shouldn't do it deliberately.\nAll right. Now, if I'm thinking about that,\nhow would you advise me to write it?\nMR. READLER: I think -- I think the Court\ncan just build on the principles it's already set\nforward in Schlup and other places, and that is, that\nthere's never been a diligence requirement in this\nsetting.\nAnd Congress, by the way, did not -- the\nCongress -- the intent of Congress was not to include a\ndiligence requirement here because, in two places, it\ndid include a diligence requirement with respect to\nsuccessive petitions or evidentiary hearings, so\ncongressional intent was not to include diligence --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But there has always\nbeen a laches defense until Rule 9(a) was rescinded.\nMR. READLER: That's correct, Justice\nSotomayor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So there's\nbeen some form -- not of due diligence, but some form of\ncheck on a prisoner waiting so long that a State can't\nrespond, the -- Justice Breyer's hypothetical.\nSo he's asking you, I think, to tell us how\nto write it. So do we write it by saying there's no\ndiligence requirement -- but there is a sort of common\nlaw laches, although that's a hard argument to make\nbecause it was based on 9(a) until recently.\nOr do we just say it's equity, and equity\nwould suggest that, if it's contrived -- the delay is\ncontrived, that the evidence is suspect and doesn't --\nand shouldn't be credited.\nMR. READLER: Absolutely. Two responses.\nFirst, just with respect to Rule 9(a), Chief Justice\nBurger, in a concurring opinion to a dissent in\nSpalding, said that even a laches rule would give way,\nif there was a colorable showing of actual innocence.\nWith respect to the rule I'd write, I would\nwrite the rule that is essentially already in place, and\nthat is that the miscarriage of justice exception does\nnot turn on diligence; it turns on whether you can show\ninnocence.\nAnd in -- in attempting to show innocence\nunder Schlup, this timing -- the timing of the\nsubmissions is a consideration. So if there's -- if\nthere's been a delay that, somehow, hurts the State\nbecause a witness has died or that it appears to be that\nthat's the fault -- or that the petitioner was playing\ngames in that context, I think that's a fair\nconsideration under Schlup.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How about --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So is this\nestablished after -- after some kind of evidentiary\nhearing, the delay, whether he delayed for a particular\npurpose or not?\nMR. READLER: Well, it depends. If -- if\nthe petition is filed 3 weeks after the star witness\ndies, presumably, the State will come back in their\npetition and note, one, all the evidence that they think\ngoes against the -- the petitioner's claim, but, also,\nthey'll note that this happened, and the court could\nresolve it at that stage, too.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why -- why did your\nclient wait 5 years after the last affidavit?\nMR. READLER: A number of reasons,\nMr. Chief Justice. One, he was looking for counsel to\nassist him; two, he continued to look for evidence;\nthree, he didn't have access to his legal papers. Many\nof his legal papers were lost in a prison riot and then\na flood that occurred at this prison, so he didn't have\naccess to those and had to regain those.\nFor a period of time, he was denied access\nto the library and to a legal writer. So there were a\nculmination of reasons why he didn't do this, but I\nthink two of the critical ones were looking for counsel\nand trying to develop more evidence.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, as your -- as your\nadversary says, there's nothing really procedurally\ncomplicated about filing a Federal habeas. There --\nthere are forms -- I've read hundreds of them -- that\nhave been filed by pro se petitioners, and there is\nnothing technical about claiming, \"I'm innocent of this\noffense.\"\nThis isn't a legal issue. It's something\nanybody can understand. I've got an -- I've got my\nsister's affidavit, I have an affidavit by a third\nperson, I have an affidavit by -- by a person who worked\nin the dry cleaning shop that shows that I'm actually\ninnocent.\nWhy doesn't -- what is the reason for\nwaiting 5 years to file that?\nMR. READLER: Well, Justice Alito, no -- no\nrational petitioner is going to want to wait in that\nperiod because, if they file within the 1-year period,\nthey go straight to review on their habeas claims, and\nthey don't have to worry about any procedural gateway.\nSo -- so no rational -\nJUSTICE ALITO: But I just -- I don't understand\nyour answer about why it took him 5 years from the --\nfrom obtaining the last affidavit to the filing of the\nFederal habeas. You said he couldn't get a lawyer. He\nreally didn't need a lawyer to do this. He didn't have\naccess to a library. This isn't a legal issue -- isn't\na complicated legal issue. It's a factual issue, that\nanybody who watches detective shows on TV can\nunderstand.\nMR. READLER: Well -- and, Justice Alito,\nyou're right, we're not arguing for equitable tolling\nhere, in the sense that he could have filed earlier.\nThere wasn't -- there wasn't a State impediment that\nstood in his way the entire period of time. And he\nshould have filed it earlier, and had he filed earlier,\nthen he would have gone straight to consideration of his\nunderlying habeas claims and wouldn't have to worry\nabout this high hurdle of satisfying --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But you think that Congress,\nwhich, in AEDPA, was trying to speed all this up and get\nrid of the delay and make things simpler, intended to\nallow that? You could wait 5 years, you could wait 10\nyears, you could wait 15 years; it doesn't matter?\nThat's what AEDPA was intended to do?\nMR. READLER: Well, no, Justice Alito,\nyou're correct that AEDPA was intended to delay -- or to\nend delay when possible -- but, as the Court said in\nHolland, AEDPA was not meant to end every delay at all\ncosts. I think this is exactly the situation it had in\nmind.\nIn Calderon, the Court recognized that the\nmiscarriage of justice exception is consistent with\nAEDPA because -- because it arises so rarely that, in\nthe vast majority of cases, the finality and comity\nconcerns that the State has are honored because there's\nno -- there's no additional proceeding, the petitioner\nwill not meet the high Schlup standard, and the case\nwill end.\nBut, in the rare case where a petitioner can\nsatisfy Schlup, the Court has always said that the\ncourthouse doors, in that circumstance, will be open to\nreview of your first Federal petition. And that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The Second Circuit --\nwhen it had a similar case, the Second Circuit itself\nsaid that actual innocence is rare. This is such a\ncase. This is a case where the alibi that he had was --\nit was established by forensic evidence, air-tight, he\nwas someplace else. The -- the Second Circuit didn't\nsend it to the district court to decide the actual\ninnocence.\nIt decided that itself and then said,\ndistrict court, now you deal with the -- with the\nquestions that the petitioner is raising -- the\nconstitutional questions. But the Sixth Circuit just\nseemed to be -- it didn't matter whether -- it didn't\nmatter whether the actual innocence claim had any solid\nbasis, when they sent it back to the district court.\nShouldn't -- if there is an actual innocence\ngateway, shouldn't the court of appeals determine that\nbefore it returns the case to the district court?\nMR. READLER: I think, ordinarily, yes. The\nSixth Circuit said, here, that there was a gateway, and\nit was remanding the case back to the district court --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but it didn't find\nanything about whether this was -- this claim was -- was\na good one.\nMR. READLER: That's correct. That's\ncorrect --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And I'm still puzzled\nabout what happens next. The case goes back to the\ndistrict court and the -- the district court is told,\ndiligence doesn't matter. The district court says, yes,\nbut I thought -- I thought that the claim was worthless.\nMR. READLER: Well, it's correct that the\ncase should be remanded back to the district court, just\nlike this case -- just like the Court did in Schlup,\nwhere it announced the standard and remanded back to the\ndistrict court for application.\nBut, here, I disagree with that reading of\nthe underlying opinion, in that the Court doesn't set\nout in sort of weighing all the evidence and saying,\nhere's what I find in favor of the petitioner and here's\nwhat I find in favor of the State. What the district\ncourt said is that -- it said the timing of the evidence\nwas somehow a problem because the information was known\nat trial, which I think is, again, wrong for two\nreasons.\nI think the petitioner has -- is able to use\nthe information because the problem for us was his\nattorney was told about some of these things, but didn't\nactually assert them -- or didn't interview one of the\nkey witnesses. One of the affiants was on the\nprosecution's witness list, and my client's lawyer\ndidn't even interview that person, let alone call them.\nAnd then the court -- I think the court --\nthe trial court misunderstood Schlup because Schlup\nallows you to consider all the evidence, old and new,\nmake appropriate credibility determinations, consider\nthe timeliness of the evidence, and determine whether\nthat standard has been met.\nAnd I think that's what should happen here\nfor the -- for the first time, in our view. And there\nis a question -- there was a question, earlier, with\nrespect to how often the Schlup standard is met. In\nresponse to the reply brief, we did a search of circuit\ncourts. And we found, since Schlup was decided, eight\ncircuits that have upheld or have found that Schlup was\nsatisfied.\nIf you add in House, then that adds nine\nappellate cases where Schlup was satisfied. So it's --\nit's a narrow range of cases. It shouldn't be difficult\nto meet, but we --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but, I mean,\nthe whole question -- and your friend made the -- made\nthe point -- the question is how many are filed, in how\nmany cases does the claim arise, not how few times it's\nupheld.\nMR. READLER: Sure. Mr. Chief Justice, I\nsuspect, no matter the rules, there will always be\nfilings by petitioners, and many of those may be\nfrivolous. But, as the Court has said in Panetti and\nother cases -- you know, unmeritorious petitions can be\ndismissed at the earliest course, and it's consistent\nwith Habeas Rule 4.\nThat's what should happen in this instance,\ntoo. But it's -- and it's awfully --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do you know\nwhich of these are meritorious and which aren't? Is\nthis the meritorious -- I assume you think this is a\nmeritorious one?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. READLER: We -- we do,\nMr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And your friend says\nnobody can reasonably think this person is innocent.\nMaybe he has constitutional claims. But, if you look at\nthe evidence, is this something, at the -- a preliminary\nstage, you look and say, oh, this guy's clearly\ninnocent, and this goes forward?\nOr is it one that you can cast aside?\nMR. READLER: I don't think it's one you can\ncast aside. I think you -- you have to give this more\ndevelopment. And, by the way, he was proceeding pro se.\nI think, when he -- when the case is remanded, with\nassistance of counsel, he can present -- better present\nthe evidence and better present some other things, to\nmake -- make the showing stronger. And I think we can\nmeet the Schlup standard.\nIf there are no further questions, we'd ask\nthat the Sixth Circuit be affirmed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Bursch, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BURSCH: Three brief points about\nHolland and some closing thoughts about diligence.\nWith respect to Holland, I want to note,\nfirst of all, that, there, you were dealing with\nlegislative silence. Everyone agreed that Congress had\nnot said anything about equitable tolling.\nAnd, as I explained earlier, when you\nconsider the three categories of defendants who claim\nactual innocence based on new evidence, this situation\nhere, where the new evidence relates to the factual\npredicate of the constitutional claim asserted, that's\nwhere Congress, most clearly, meant to have the\nlimitations period apply.\nSo it's very different. With respect to\nequitable tolling applying to acts of Congress, everyone\nrecognizes that. Mr. Chief Justice, you note that this\nhas never been applied to limitations. I actually have\nto take issue with my friend's statement that Sanders\nand Kuhlmann, somehow, took a different tack because, in\nboth of those cases, what Congress did is it left it to\nthe district judge's discretion to do or not do\nsomething.\nAnd all this Court said was, well, if\nthey've got discretion, then they can still have an\nequitable exception. So, even in those cases, this\nmiscarriage of justice exception has never, ever been\nused to override a congressional act.\nThe last thing is that, in equitable\ntolling, you are dealing with the fault of the\npetitioner -- Hurricane Katrina or something else\nhappened that wasn't their fault. And, here, it's\nentirely within the Petitioner's control.\nAll they have to do is print the form, check\nthe boxes, attach the evidence, and then file the claim.\nAnd they have an unlimited time to find evidence and\nthen, 1 year after that, to file.\nNow, with respect to diligence --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: General, you had suggested,\nearlier, some way out of this puzzle about why Congress\nwould have put the actual innocence exception into the\nsecond successive petition provision and not had one for\na first petition?\nMR. BURSCH: Yes.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So that seems really quite\nodd to me. I mean, a number of my colleagues have said,\nwell, can we really believe that Congress contemplated\nthis. But, I mean, don't we have evidence that Congress\ncontemplated it in the second and successive context, a\nslightly tighter version, wouldn't it be quite odd to\nsay that Congress contemplated an actual innocence\nexception when you are on your second petition, but\nbarred it when you are on your first?\nWhat sense would that be?\nMR. BURSCH: Yeah, let me explain that and\nI'm glad you raised that because -- you know, besides\nthe legislative history that informs what we are looking\nat here, what they did in 2244(d)(1)(D) is they made it\nbroader. They said, even if you don't claim innocence,\nif you are coming forward with new evidence, we want the\ncourt to hear that constitutional claim, if you bring it\nwithin one year.\nThe reason they didn't mention it there is\nbecause it would have made the provision narrower, and\nthey didn't want to do that. Then they ratcheted it up\nwith respect to successive petitions, making you pass\nthrough the successive petition actual innocence gateway\nand then comply with the limitations period, so that's\nthe explanation, consistent were with legislative\nhistory.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I guess I'm just not\nsure I understand that. I mean, they could have added a\nseparate provision, just saying there's an actual\ninnocence exception, or there is -- there's not,\nconsistent with the way they did it in the -- in the\nsecond and successive petition.\nMR. BURSCH: Right, they could have, but,\nagain, that would have limited (d)(1)(D).\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, it didn't have to.\nWhy would it have necessarily have limited (d)(1)(D)?\nMR. BURSCH: Well, if they said there is an\nexception for those who claim actual innocence, the\nimplication is, for those who don't claim actual\ninnocence, you are out of luck.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, you just you make the\nconverse clear.\nMR. BURSCH: Well, if we could rewrite\ncongressional statutes with hindsight -- you know, maybe\nwe could draft a perfect statute.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: All I'm suggesting is that your\ninterpretation of the statute creates a glaring anomaly\nthat people would be out of court on the first petition,\nand they could turn around on their second petition,\nwhich is usually disfavored, and get an actual innocence\nexception.\nMR. BURSCH: No, that -- that's not the way\nthat we interpret this at all. Under either provision,\nyou are stuck with (d)(1)(D), you have got to file\nwithin a year. All that the successive petition adds to\nit is that you do have a statutory actual innocence\ngateway to pass through first that you don't have on your\nfirst petition. That's our position.\nI do want to close with some thoughts about\ndiligence. You know, looking for counsel, we've talked\nabout how simple it is to -- to file these things. The\npapers lost in the -- the prison riot and the access to\nthe library are related, and it's because Defendant\nPerkins incited the prison riot, so he is hardly in an\nequitable position of -- of claiming any tolling benefit\nfrom that.\nAnd with respect to the -- the rule,\nJustice Breyer, we can't have a diligence rule if you go\nto that point, based on intent, because the interest\nthat is being vindicated here is not the purpose of the\nPetitioner in --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What do you think about the\nwords \"discovered in exercise of due diligence\"? You\nknow, you could manipulate those words so as to deal\nwith the circumstance of the -- say, below-average IQ\nperson who doesn't have a lawyer, who isn't certain\nabout what to do, and what counts as diligence and\ndiscovery in that case.\nIs that -- are you objecting to that? Do\nyou object to that? What do you think?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead, briefly.\nMR. BURSCH: Sure. As long as it takes into\naccount that the State's interest in timeliness is at\nits apex when we are dealing with new evidence that\nrelates to the actual constitutional claim. And they\nare asking for -- not equitable tolling, but\nextraordinary tolling that you should reject.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
