        "content": "(10:06 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Case 06-1249, Wyeth v. Levine.\nMr. Waxman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case concerns conflict pre-emption\nunder the Supremacy Clause, and the conflict presented\nhere is stark. Repeatedly over the years, the FDA\napproved Phenergan injection as safe and effective under\nall the conditions and methods of use described in the\nlabeling, including what is referred to as \"IV push\"\ninjection. Yet a State jury, evaluating the same risk\nthat the FDA had considered, determined that the precise\nlabeling that FDA had required Wyeth to use in fact\nrendered Phenergan \"unreasonably dangerous.\" That --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Just at the outset, I'll\njust make one comment. You argue that it's impossible\nfor Wyeth to comply with the State law and at the same\ntime the Federal label. As a textual matter, as a\nlogical matter, I just -- I don't understand that. I\nthink I could design a label that's completely\nconsistent and that meets the requirements that the\nRespondents wish to urge.\nNow, if you want to say that any alteration\nof the label violates Federal law, that's something\nelse. But as a textual matter, as a logical matter, as\na semantic matter, I don't agree with it.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, let me make sure, because\nI do think we do agree, and I want to make sure that I'm\nunderstood, Justice Kennedy. I think what you've\narticulated is the test which is, is it possible for a\nregulated party to comply at the same time with both\nFederal law and State law? In other words, could they\nuse, as they were required by Federal law to do, to use\nthe precise label that in approving the application in\n1998 the FDA required Wyeth to use, and also use the\nlabel that the Vermont jury determined should be used,\nand that was stated in the complaint and in the opening\nand the closing a statement that you may not, should not\nuse IV administration or IV push, in other words that\nyou should contra -- the label should contra-indicate\nsomething --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman --\nMR. WAXMAN: -- that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It didn't say -- it\ndidn't say IV across the board. It said IV push is the\nclaim, and that was -- as I understand this, the FDA was\naware of the IV use and a certain risk. But did it\never, ever discreetly consider IV push versus IV\nadministered the usual way by a drip bag?\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes it did, Justice Ginsburg,\nand I want to cite you to the portions of the record\nthat demonstrate that it did. But before I do so, I\njust want to underscore a point that I think is clear\nfrom both our brief and the Solicitor General's brief,\nwhich is that isn't the test of preemption in any event.\nThe question is what did the labeling say and upon what\ninformation was the labeling decision made.\nBut as to your particular question, there\nare -- first of all, there was testimony in the record\nfrom multiple parties, including experts from both\nsides, that the FDA was aware of all of the forms of\nadministration and the risk, including IV push. Their\nexperts simply disagreed with the judgment that the\nlabeling requires. But most saliently, the labeling in\nthis case, which is reproduced, in sort of microscopic\nsize unfortunately, on the last two pages of the\npetitioner appendix and the last two pages of the joint\nappendix, have four separate reference that, as we\nexplained in footnote 11 of our reply brief, only apply\nto IV push.\nThere is a reference to the use of the Tubex\nsystem. That is a direct IV push system. There is a\nreference to rigid plungers and small-bore needles.\nAgain nothing to do with drip. There is a reference to\na maximum rate of administration. Drip is gravity. The\ntestimony in the case was that an instruction that a\nparticular rate of administration not be exceeded only\nreferred to IV push. And finally, there are cautions on\nthe label about how the ordinary aspiration of blood to\nsee if its bright or dark, which is only done in the\ncontext of a needle that is being used to push something\ninto a vein, is not reliable in the context of this case\nbecause Phenergan discolors arterial blood immediately.\nSo the labeling plainly comprehended and\nwarned about the specific risks of IV push\nadministration, and that's not all. There is an\nadvisory -- an advisory committee in 1976 was asked to\nlook at precisely the risk of arterial exposure to\nPhenergan injection or any other irritant drug that is\nadministered intravenously and it made specific\nrecommendations, including recommendations that go\ndirectly to IV push.\nJUSTICE ALITO: How could the -- how could\nthe FDA concluded that IV push was safe and effective\nwhen on the benefit side of this you don't have a\nlife-saving drug, you have a drug that relieves nausea,\nand on the risk side you have the risk of gangrene?\nMR. WAXMAN: I mean, there was testimony --\nJustice Alito, I can go over the testimony, but there\nis -- there was testimony in this very case about those\nvery circumstances in which direct IV injection is\nindicated. And there is also test -- there is also\nevidence in the FDA record, including if you look at the\n1987 correspondence that the FDA sent to Wyeth in the\ncontext of talking about what warnings had to be\nprovided. The FDA provided Wyeth 20 citations to 20\nmedical journals that addressed this problem, and in\nfootnote 13 of our reply brief we've cited the ones that\nspecifically address the circumstances in which IV push\nadministration is an important tool. The point here is,\nI think, that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that doesn't answer\nthe question of was it -- the risk of gangrene and\namputation is there. No matter what benefit there was,\nhow could the benefit outweigh that substantial risk?\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Ginsburg, this is\nlabeling that is directed at medical professionals. It\nis labeling that is directed at physicians, who have to\nbe able to determine what method, what pharmaceutical\nand what method of administration to use, given the\nconstellation of risks and benefits that a particular\npatient --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The FDA was never\nconcerned with risks versus benefit?\nMR. WAXMAN: The FDA -- well, the FDA\ncertainly is. And the issue, Justice Kennedy, here is\nthe FDA has to decide what information to provide to\nclinicians so that they can make judgments about what to\nuse. And it -- what it did here is it provided ample,\nlavish warnings about the risk of intra-arterial\ninjection and exposure of an irritant drug like\nPhenergan to arterial blood. It provided in the\nlabeling to the physicians a cascading hierarchy of\nmethods of administration. It said intramuscular\ninjection is the preferred method. It then said with\nrespect to intravenous injection that it is, as with any\nirritant drug, it is usually preferable to inject it\ninto an IV infusion set that is known to be running\nproperly, in other words where a line has already been\nestablished into the vein and the IV push occurs into\nthe line that's already established.\nAll that information was available to\nphysicians and the FDA has to understand and does\nunderstand that in labeling to allow medical\nprofessionals to make their judgments, taking options\naway from physicians is not always better. It may\nnot -- it may not even often be better. What the FDA\nhas to decide in terms of telling physicians what's on\nthe table and what's off the table and in terms of\nwhat's on the table what the relevant risks are is, is\nthis ever -- would this ever be medically warranted?\nThe testimony in this case and in the administrative\nrecord was yes, there are circumstances --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'd like you to\naddress the distinction between the medical device area\nand the drug area because in the medical device area, of\ncourse, you have an express pre-emption clause, while\nhere in contrast you don't.\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes. I mean, I think,\nMr. Chief Justice, you've identified the respect in\nwhich this is difference than the medical device area.\nBut for the salient purposes, I think the Riegel case\ndirectly points the Court to the nature of the\ndetermination that the FDA makes with respect to class 3\ndrugs. It goes through the same preclearance process.\nAs we pointed out in our brief and as I think Justice\nScalia's opinion in Riegel points out, the balancing\ntime-intensive, data- intensive inquiry for medical\ndevices was patterned after what is done for drugs, and\nit reflects a balancing of risks and benefits of the\nparticular drug in light of the conditions and methods\nof administration prescribed in the labeling.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If that's true you\nwould have expected the Federal Drug Act to have a\nsimilar express pre-emption provision. And one reason\nperhaps that it didn't is that when the Drug Act was\npassed you had an established background of State\nactions; when the Medical Device Act was passed you\ndidn't.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, let me address both the\nestablished background of State actions and then the\npre-emption clause difference, if I may. The Respondent\nand her amici have identified 97 cases going back 150\nyears in which tort actions have been brought with\nrespect to pharmaceuticals. Very few of those cases --\nand they are recent -- are implicated by the rule that\nthe Vermont Supreme Court applied in this case, which is\nwhere a fully informed FDA, informed of all the\ninformation that Wyeth had, approved a labeling\nstandard, but a court looking at the same evidence can\nreach a different conclusion about what is on the label.\nThe most -- those cases I believe all post-date\nCipollone. Many of them postdate Geier. And by my\ncount, there are fewer than 20 such cases out of all of\nthe cases that have been decided and those issues --\nthat issue had never come up and never could have come\nup when Congress enacted the 1938 Act, because it was\nonly the 1938 Act that established a drug-specific,\npreclearance regime, and really in 1962, in which the\nFDA was required not just to evaluate safety in terms of\nlicensing the distribution of the drug, but to balance\nsafety against effectiveness.\nAnd so the -- the constellation of common\nlaw cases -- I mean, let me just say we are -- we are\nnot seeking here a rule of field preemption. We are not\nseeking to preclude tort remedies for conduct that\nviolates Federal law.\nWhat we are saying here is -- and this goes,\nI think, finally to your point about the express\npre-emption clause -- the presence of expressed\npre-emption clauses or the absence, the presence of a\nsavings clause or the absence, does not and cannot\naffect the operation of conflict pre-emption under the\nFederal Constitution.\nNow, members of this Court are concerned\nabout applying a broad, vague, or free-wheeling analysis\nof implied conflict pre-emption, but this case is\nheartland. A jury was asked to look at the same\ninformation and conclude that the precise language that\nthe FDA just didn't allow, the FDA required Wyeth to\nuse, rendered that drug unreasonably unsafe.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it required it\nbecause that is what the FDA had approved as a label.\nBut as -- excuse me -- as I understand it, the -- the\ncompany, Wyeth, could have gone back to the FDA at any\ntime and said, either based on experience or just our\nrethinking of the data that we have, we think the label\nought to be changed to say \"Don't use IV push.\" Wyeth\ncould have done that at any time, and it simply didn't\ndo it.\nAnd the -- the reason I raise this is\nbecause it could have done it at any time, where, going\nback to Justice Kennedy's first question, where is the\nconflict?\nMR. WAXMAN: The liability in this case was\nnot predicated on the fact that Wyeth didn't go to the\n-- remember, the FDA had approved this label two years\nbefore Miss Levine was injured. In approving the label,\nit rejected stronger proposed language that Wyeth had\npresented. There was nothing that was -- Wyeth was --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But as I understand it,\nWyeth's argument is not this argument. Wyeth is not\nsaying the reason there is a conflict here is that we\ntried to give the kind of warning that the Vermont jury,\nin effect, says we should have given and the FDA didn't\nallow us to do it, so that, in fact, there is a conflict\nbetween a specific rejection by the FDA of the Vermont\nrule and the rule that the Vermont jury applied.\nMR. WAXMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: As I understand it, Wyeth's\nargument is: Whatever is on the label, in fact, is the\nstandard of conflict. It doesn't matter whether we\ntried or could have tried or didn't try. You simply\nlook at the label and you look at what the Vermont jury\ndid; and if there is a -- if there is a difference\nbetween them, there is a conflict. Am I right about\nyour argument?\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes, you are right. We -- we\nhave both an impossibility form of conflict because, in\nthe absence of any new information or new analyses of\nold information, we could not make the change in advance\nof getting approval. And we also have an -- an\nobjects-and-purposes form of conflict pre-emption\nbecause the Vermont jury decided on the same information\nthat the labeling that the FDA had approved and required\nwas unreasonably unsafe.\nAnd we cannot have a world in which the very\nday after an intensive process -- the FDA says you may\ndistribute this drug, but you must use this specific\nlanguage -- either, A, manufacturers can just run in and\nchange the label and ask for permission down the road;\nor, B, that a State jury -- let's take the easier case\n-- a State legislature or 50 State legislatures can\ndecide: Because you could have gone back and asked, we\ncan impose an obligation on you that you must have done\nso or must have changed the labeling. That just is\ninconsistent with --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is it -- is it strict\nliability or negligence? In other words, are they\nsaying you must have done so, or are they saying because\nyou could have done so and didn't you did not conform to\nthe standard of care?\nMR. WAXMAN: Either a negligence theory or a\nstrict-liability theory would be pre-empted.\nMay I reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Kneedler.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe State law duties on which Respondent's\ntort claims are based are pre-empted because they\nconflict with the FDA's determination that Phenergan\ninjection is safe and effective under the conditions of\nuse recommended or suggested in the labeling.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler, at the\noutset, would you clarify something that is central, I\nthink, to this case? Some of the briefs tell us that\nthis represents a change of policy on the part of the\nFDA, that in fact the FDA once approved and said torts\nwere -- tort suits were a helpful adjunct to the FDA's\nown efforts to protect consumers. They helped because\nthey prodded manufacturers to -- to disclose risks that\nwere either unknown or under- evaluated. Was that once\nthe FDA's policy; and, if so, when did it change?\nMR. KNEEDLER: The -- the FDA, to my\nknowledge, has never taken the position that -- that, as\na general matter, a manufacturer may change a label\nwithout -- without the existence of new information that\njustifies a revision. The Respondents and the amici\nrelied primarily on some snippets of rule-making\nproceedings and things like that in which FDA has\nreferred to the existence of tort remedies. But we are\nnot arguing for the proposition that tort remedies are\n-- are pre-empted as a general matter.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But when -- when would\nthere be a tort remedy? What -- what situation would\nyou envision?\nMR. KNEEDLER: As Mr. Waxman mentioned, if\n-- if the State standard was the same as the Federal\nstandard, there wouldn't be any conflict. And, for\nexample, if -- and not to mention the fact if there was\nadulteration of -- of the product or if the -- if the\nproduct in the box was not the same --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if they found out\nabout new information which would, if properly\nconsidered, alter what the labeling ought to be? Would\nthere be a tort remedy for the failure to bring that new\ninformation to the attention of --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, the position we are\narguing for here would not cover that situation, but --\nbut there could be a further situation of pre-emption,\nif I could just explain why. I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You mean if you failed to\nprovide the FDA the new information that you think\nnegates the provisions on the -- on the label, you still\ncouldn't be sued?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. If you -- if you failed\nto provide it altogether, there would not be a -- a\npre-emption defense if there were -- if your\nfailure-to-warn claim was based on the new information\nthat you didn't furnish.\nI was -- I was going to identify the\nsituation where -- and this has come up in the anti-\ndepressant drug situation, for example, where there is\nevolving information. There has been a rule- making\npetition, in fact several over the years, to the FDA to\nchange the labeling to warn against -- to warn about the\npossibility of suicidal ideation. And FDA has\nrejected that even though it's -- it's new information\narising after the drug was approved. If the information\nis brought to the FDA's attention and FDA rejects the\nproposed change, then you would you have conflict\npre-emption again. But if the information was never\nbrought to the FDA's attention in the first place, then\n-- then there would -- it would be not inconsistent with\nFederal law to have a tort suit based on that. If it's\n-- if it's been proposed and rejected, then you're back\nwith a conflict.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what if you\nbrought it to the FDA's attention and the FDA just\nhasn't acted on it? You would be authorized to change\nthe label on your own.\nMR. KNEEDLER: You would be authorized, but\nif FDA then rejects -- rejects the labeling --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand, but in the\ninterim, you could -- could you be subject to a State\ntort suit for not changing the label when -- when you\nhad the power to do so?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I -- if -- if FDA has taken\nno action at all, then I think you -- you could be. I\nthis it's very likely that FDA would have acted by the\n-- by the time that -- I mean, I suppose there could be\na window in there before it was approved.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But why is that -- why is\nthat likely, considering the huge number of drugs? I\nmean, one figure said that there are 11,000 drugs that\nhave this approval. Is the FDA really monitoring every\none of those to see if there is some new information\nthat should change the label?\nMR. KNEEDLER: If I could make two points\nabout that: The first is, as I said, we are not arguing\nthat there is pre-emption in a situation where there is\nnew information that is not brought to FDA's attention.\nBut the second point is that in the 2007\namendments to the Act, Congress recognized the\ndifficulties with this and gave FDA important new\nenforcement tools and resources to go after the problem\nof things that arise after a drug is improved --\napproved, that has given FDA the authority to direct a\nchange in the label, which it did not have before.\nIt has given the FDA the authority to order\nnew clinical studies, and it has ordered FDA to set up a\ndata system where it will get electronic notification of\n-- of adverse events.\nI -- I should point out in the -- in the one\nyear since these amendments were passed, FDA has, I -- I\nthink, in 21 instances ordered clinical trials. In four\ninstances it has ordered a revision of labeling. It has\nhired 430 new employees in the Center for Drug\nEvaluation and Research to address the post-marketing\nsituation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why isn't -- why isn't the\nfact that some certain number of people are getting\ngangrene, why isn't that new information?\nMR. KNEEDLER: The risk -- the way FDA --\nand this is set forth in the changes being affected\nregulation amendment that was --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That was all passed long\nafter the events here took place, I think.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But -- but --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So at the time, you read\nthe regulation, I think a person would think that he was\nfree drug manufacturer if he learned something new to\nstrengthen -- strengthens the contraindication, put it\nin.\nMR. KNEEDLER: As FDA explained in 2008,\nwhen it promulgated this regulation, it's been FDA's\nlong-standing interpretation that only new information\nwould justify a change.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why wouldn't that be new?\nMR. KNEEDLER: New information means new\ninformation about a risk that is greater in severity or\nfrequency. If you have --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If you get a certain number\nof cases.\nMR. KNEEDLER: There is no claim -- there is\nno claim here that either of those -- in the record in\nthis case, that either of those was true.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's because nobody\nbrought up this new information point. So if nobody\nbrought up the new information point at the trial and if\nthe burden is on the manufacturer to show that it's\npre-empted, isn't that the manufacturer's fault, because\nif you simply read the regulation, you wouldn't find any\nof all this complicated stuff about certain kinds of new\ninformation.\nMR. KNEEDLER: That's a legal question not a\nfactual. And it was argued to the Vermont --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes it's a legal question.\nMR. KNEEDLER: It was argued to the Vermont\nSupreme Court, and I don't think -- I don't think that\nRespondent -- Respondent has noted that it wasn't\nraised, but I don't think it's argued that it's waived.\nAnd I think for the Court to fully address this\nsituation, I think it would be good to take into account\nFDA's -- certainly going forward that is the regulatory\nregime --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But we are not making an\nadvisory opinion. We are deciding this case. And this\ncase here you say new information of a certain kind\nwould be okay, nobody argued it. You read the reg, and\nit doesn't seem to make all these distinctions end of\ncase. Since the manufacturer has the burden of going\ninto this, which apparently it didn't do. So, now we\nhave decided this case, and we go on to the next one.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Okay. If I could make just\none further --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's your response to\nthat?\nMR. KNEEDLER: If I could make one further\npoint about that. And that is the -- this act sets up a\nprior approval situation. In other words, Congress\nwanted the FDA to look at the drug in advance,\nbalance -- against benefits as this Court said in\nRutherford, and -- Brown & Williamson, strike a balance\nand approve it.\nIt would be fundamentally inconsistent with\na prior approval system to have a regime in which the\nvery next day State law could require the manufacturer\nto change the very labeling that FDA has struck a\nbalance --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't understand what\nwe're talking about here. The new information was not\nbrought up by either side --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- showing increased\nfrequency or increased severity?\nMR. KNEEDLER: That's correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Right?\nAnd supposedly, it was burden of the drug\ncompany to show --\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. The drug company says\nit's pre-empted, and the only escape hatch from the\npreemption is new information.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You agree with -- you\nagree with Mr. Waxman that the FDA specifically\naddressed the risks and benefits of IV push as opposed\nto the risks of arterial exposures?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It specifically addressed in\nthe labeling that the FDA approved, and I think that's\nall that needs to be looked at in -- it's just as in\nRiegle, where the preemption turns on that device, in\nthat case, and the labeling that was presented. Here\nthe preemption turns on the labeling and the drug that\nwas presented. And FDA regulations prohibit the change\nunless there is new information.\nIf I could make one other point about\nRiegle. Riegle does contain an FDA -- an expressed\npreemption provision. But the reason why this Court\nfound preemption in Riegle under that provision is very\ninstructive here, because as Mr. Waxman pointed out, the\npremarket approval process in the two situations are\nessentially the same.\nAnd what you had on the one hand was Federal\naction having the force of law like under the file rate\ndoctrine or some administrative determination having the\nforce of law approving a license or -- or a drug, a\nlegal prohibition against changing that without new\ninformation. And on the state side, you have a rule of\nlaw under the common law of torts imposing a different\nobligation. Those are squarely termed --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You're talking about\nchanging but you can supplement without changing the\nlabel.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No -- no, you cannot. Any --\nany change in the wording of -- of the label is a change\nthat requires FDA approval unless it is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You can supplement only\nwhen there is new information?\nMR. KNEEDLER: When there is new information\nand even then, it has to be in the form of a new drug --\na supplemental drug application to the agency.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Kneedler.\nMr. Frederick.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nI'd like to start with regulation 201.80,\nwhich is set forth in an addendum to our brief at 19-A.\nThe second sentence of which reads: \"The labeling shall\nbe revised -- this is after an applicant, a sponsor has\nobtained approval of the drug label -- \"it shall be\nrevised to include a warning as soon as there is\nreasonable evidence of an association of a serious risk\nwith a drug. A causal relationship need not have been\nproved.\"\nThe testimony at trial established that\nWyeth knew or should have known from at least the '70s\nthat there was a significance issue concerning IV push\nrisks.\nAnd, Justice Alito, in answer to your\nquestion --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Those -- those\nrisks were set forth on the labeling approved by the\nFDA. Surely that sentence means it shall be revised to\ninclude a warning as soon, as soon as there is\nreasonable evidence of an association of a serious\nhazard that the FDA has not considered. And that is not\nalready addressed on the labeling. I mean to read it\nas -- as opening up stuff that's already been considered\nby the FDA would -- would -- would make a -- a mush out\nof it.\nMR. FREDERICK: FDA never considered any\ncomparative risks of IV push versus IV drip. The\nevidence on this was clear. Wyeth had a --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the\nvarious portions of the label in the record that\nMr. Waxman addressed and Mr. Kneedler, representing the\nFDA, said they specifically considered IV push risks?\nMR. FREDERICK: What the evidence showed was\nthat FDA certainly was aware that there are different\nforms of intravenous administration of drugs, but it\nnever considered that the risk of IV push so greatly\nincreased the risks of a catastrophic injury --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they have to.\nWhen they determine that it's safe to use it under those\ncircumstances that necessarily includes a consideration\nof the risk. People can say it's safe for you to walk\ndown the sidewalk. That doesn't mean there is no risk\nthat you get hit by lightning or something else. It\njust means in evaluating them together, they determine\nthat it's worth the candle in particular cases where a\nphysician determines that that's the indicated method.\nMR. FREDERICK: Mr. Chief Justice, here\nthere was no way FDA could have made this determination\nbecause the risks of IV push are so catastrophic\ncompared to the benefit which the testimony at trial\nshowed --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you're just\ncontradicting the label. The fact is they could not\nhave approved that label unless they made that\ndetermination.\nNow, if you're telling me the FDA acted\nirresponsible -- irresponsibly, then sue the FDA.\nMR. FREDERICK: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the labeling made it\nvery clear that the preferred method of administering\nthis medicine was -- was -- was muscular and -- and that\nthere were serious risks involved in -- in the IV push.\nMoreover, your client didn't follow the\nlabeling or your client's physician didn't follow the\nlabeling prescription for IV push, did he?\nMR. FREDERICK: The testimony at trial\nshowed that the doctor acted with a standard of care\nthat was not negligent, and that was based on expert\ntestimony.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. No. Wait, wait. He\nadministered a -- a level of the drug that was vastly in\nexcess of -- of -- of what the labeling said could\nsafely be used for IV push.\nMR. FREDERICK: And the testimony at trial\nshowed that that had no bearing on her injury,\nbecause --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Had no bearing. Are you\nserious?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes. It did. The testimony\nat trial from Dr. Green disputed that point. Both\ncourts below rejected that notion.\nBut the idea that a label is set in stone\nfor all time misunderstands the way the process works.\nWhen FDA approves a drug with a drug label, it does so\non the basis of small clinical trials with very few,\nsometimes as few as a thousand or a couple of thousand\npeople. And when the drug is marketed and goes to lots\nand lots of people that are not healthy, that are in\ndifferent conditions, new problems arise. That's why\nthe general -- the GAO found that over 51 percent of\ndrugs have adverse drug events not known.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You established that there\nwere new problems? I mean, if there were new problems,\nthen -- then they could have simply supplemented the\nlabeling. But did you establish that there were\nproblems that had not been considered already by the\nFDA?\nI mean, the labeling says, you know, that\nthis is dangerous to use -- use IV push. It made it\nvery clear that it's dangerous.\nMR. FREDERICK: That was not our burden and\nthat was not how the testimony came in at trial. But as\nthe amicus brief by Dr. Budhwani, et al. at pages 54\nestablishes had Wyeth been a reasonably prudent\nmanufacturer over the years, it would have known that\nthe risks of IV push so far outweigh any bearing\nnegligible benefits, that it would have offered a\nstronger instruction, it would have moved to revise its\nlabel either with FDA approval or --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It proposed a more\nrestrictive label to the FDA, didn't it? And the FDA\nsaid, no, you use this label. In other words, it's --\nwhat you're saying was not its call. It was the call of\nthe FDA.\nMR. FREDERICK: Footnote one of the Vermont\nSupreme Court's opinion disputes that point, because it\nsays the label was different. And if you compare what\nwas submitted to FDA versus what FDA looked at, there\nwas no reference to IV push risks creating the risk of\ncatastrophic harm versus negligible, Justice Scalia.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your -- I\nthought your theory was that this type of administration\nof the drug should not be allowed. The label should not\nsay here are the risks, here are the benefits. You --\nyour jury theory was you cannot suggest in the labeling\nthat physicians should have this available.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, as the jury was\ninstructed, Mr. Chief Justice, and the evidence came in\nat trial, it was -- it was somewhat larger than that in\nthe sense that a State failure to warn claim doesn't\nprescribe particular wording. It simply says that the\nexisting wording is inadequate. And if the case comes\nto this Court --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it simply says\nthat if you go ahead with the label like this, you don't\nhave to pay $10 million whenever it comes wrong. That's\nhaving the effect, as our case has established, imposing\na limitation on the label.\nMR. FREDERICK: But the label itself is not\nset in stone, Mr. Chief Justice. Manufacturers change\ntheir labels all the time as new drug risks come in.\nAnd the regulations provide that the manufacturer is\nresponsible not only for the label, but for monitoring\npost-market information.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your case depends\nupon us determining that the risk at issue here that was\npresented to the jury was a new risk that the FDA did\nnot consider?\nMR. FREDERICK: No. It's not dependent on\nthat at all, Mr. Chief Justice. It is dependent on a\nfinding that the manufacturer had a duty of due care and\nit didn't live up to that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if it referred to new\ndrug risks, then, in your preceding sentence, where you\nare saying manufacturers change it all the time as new\ndrug risks become apparent?\nMR. FREDERICK: The testimony --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What you mean is whether or\nnot new drug risks become apparent, they have to change,\nright?\nMR. FREDERICK: The question is what does\nthe manufacturer know and when did this manufacturer\nknow it? And here, the testimony at trial showed that\nan antinausea drug called Vistrol -- this is at page 79\nof the joint appendix -- caused amputations in two\ncases. Pfizer voluntarily removed IV push injection for\nthat drug. This was information in Wyeth's files; Wyeth\nknew this from the 1970s; and yet it did nothing to\nchange the Phenergan label.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Suppose --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: With respect to the\nobligation in this case, may I go back to an earlier\nquestion that Justice Scalia asked you? And I -- I --\nif you responded to this particular point, I didn't get\nit.\nHe said that he understood that Wyeth had in\nfact asked the FDA to modify the label, at least to\nstrengthen the warning against IV push, and that request\nwas -- was denied, so that in fact that -- that created\nthe conflict. What is your response to -- to the\nfactual basis for that -- for that comment?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, the FDA itself said in\nthe Solicitor General's brief at page 25 that it was\ndeemed to be a nonsubstantive change. These were\nchanges that were being made --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, regardless of what\ntheir, their semantic label was, was there a request at\nleast to -- to beef up the warning against using IV\npush? And if so, did the -- did the FDA reject it and\nsay no, you can't do that.\nMR. FREDERICK: It was a different label and\nit was a different strength of warning, but it didn't\nhave to do with the relative risks and benefits of IV\npush versus IV drip.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What would it --\nMR. FREDERICK: That was the crucial point.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What would it have said?\nMR. FREDERICK: This is set out at footnote\n1 of the Vermont Supreme Court opinion, which is set out\nin the joint -- in the petition appendix at pages 4a to\n5a, and it goes on for two pages. But essentially what\nthe -- what the comparison was was talking about the\npreferability of injecting it through the tubing of an\nintravenous infusion set that is known to be functioning\nsatisfactorily, which would suggest to most medical\npractitioners and was it the case in the trial testimony\ngiven by Dr. Green below, that that would suggest an IV\ndrip, not IV push.\nWhen FDA then rejected it for -- for\nnonsubstantive reasons, it went back to the prior\nverbiage which is set out at 5a, which simply says if\nyou put this drug in an artery the concentration can be\nsuch that it will -- it will cause harm.\nBut our point is that these kinds of risks\ncome to light frequently with drugs that are on the\nmarket and the need to revise these labels is the duty\nof the manufacturer. Section 314. --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you -- you also, to be\nclear on it, as I understand it, you do not accept the\nposition that the FDA puts forward, that the obligation\ndepends upon the accrual of new information.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, how you --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Any information, new or\nold, as I understand it, on your argument raises this\nobligation to -- to act.\nMR. FREDERICK: I think that the dispute is\n-- is what constitutes new information, because we don't\ntake issue with the notion that new information can be\nnew analysis of prior submitted data; and what the\namicus brief by Dr. Budhwani et al. Points out is that\nthere was a lot of unpublished information about the\nharms of Phenergan that was known to Wyeth or should\nhave been known to Wyeth in the '80s and '90s that would\nhave justified a change under the CEE regulations.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose the record\nshowed that the FDA clearly considered whether IV push\nshould be contraindicated and concluded it should not be\nand prescribed the label that now appears on the drug;\nand then, as some of the other arguments have\nreferenced, the very day after the FDA made that ruling,\nMs. Levine was injured. Would you still -- would she\nstill have a claim in your view, a non-pre-empted claim?\nMR. FREDERICK: That be pre-empted. And the\nreason it would be pre-empted is because the FDA would\nhave considered and rejected on the basis of the same\ninformation or similar information the very duty that\nunderlies the State claim.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So your argument is -- is\npredicated on the existence of new information. If\nthere was no new information, then the claim is\npre-empted?\nMR. FREDERICK: No, it's -- well, it is\nnot -- I think there are two things to keep analytically\nclear. One is can the manufacturer come forward with a\nlabel change on the basis of -- of information that is\nassessing the risk or reassessing the risk, and under\nthe -- under the regulations it's absolutely clear it\ncan do that before FDA has approved it. It is subject\nto FDA disapproval.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and is entitled to\namend the labeling automatically.\nMR. FREDERICK: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I envision a -- a scheme\nunder which manufacturers who are worried about jury\nliability of -- of the magnitude that occurred in this\ncase saying, gee, why should we take chances? And every\ntime there is a jury verdict on some -- on some other --\nsome other ground not -- not prohibited by the label,\nthey just add that to the label; and they submit it\nto -- to the FDA and the -- and until -- unless and\nuntil the FDA conducts an investigation and disapproves\nthat label, that labeling change occurs.\nHow many -- how many -- you mentioned a\nnumber of -- of times that -- that label alterations\nare -- are proposed. I mean, this is going to be a\nmassive operation for the FDA.\nMR. FREDERICK: Justice Scalia, that would\npromote public safety, because it puts into the hands of\ndoctors the information that enables them to make\nindividualized risk determinations.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It would not promote public\nsafety if you believe that the name of this game is\nbalancing benefits and costs.\nMR. FREDERICK: And Congress said --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And if you are simply\neliminating certain drugs which people who -- who have\nreal desperate need for could -- could be benefited by,\nyou're not benefiting the public.\nMR. FREDERICK: No, and in fact that's\ncontrary to the policy determination Congress made. In\nthe misbranding provision, which is Section 352(f), it\ncalls -- that the label is misbranded unless its\nlabeling bears adequate directions for use and such\nadequate warnings against use in those pathological\nconditions or by children where its use may be dangerous\nto health or against unsafe dosage or methods or\nduration of administration or application.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that applies even if\nit's approved by the FDA?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes. It's misbranded. And\nin the 1979 --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying FDA approval\ndoesn't -- doesn't give you any protection at all?\nMR. FREDERICK: It -- it provides you a\nbasis for marketing your --- your product.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but -- but the\nmarketing may be a misbranding?\nMR. FREDERICK: In -- the FDA itself said so\nin 1979 in 44 Federal Register, which we cite in our\nbrief, that even an original label may be misbranded if\nthe drug manufacturer subsequently learns that it was\nnot adequate for the safe use of the drug.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well then, gee, then all of\nthe qualifications you were making earlier about whether\nit's new information or a new assessment, that's\nirrelevant.\nMR. FREDERICK: No, it's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying whenever it's\nunsafe, whatever the FDA has approved, you have a\nlawsuit.\nMR. FREDERICK: No. What I'm saying is that\nthe information developed after the original label is\napproved, and it is not a floor and a ceiling --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There -- there was nothing\nabout new information in what you just said. You said\nit's misbranded if it's not safe, new information or\nnot.\nMR. FREDERICK: And that's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that -- is that -- is\nthat your position?\nMR. FREDERICK: Our position is that the\nduty is on the manufacturer to make a safe label, and if\nthe label is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But getting to Justice\nScalia's point, as I understand your answer to an\nearlier question, on the day that the FDA approves the\nlabel, if there is no further information indicating\ndanger, then any liability that is based upon what the\n-- the kind of information that the FDA knew would be\npre-empted. The only time -- you're saying pre-emption\ndoes not occur when there is -- forget the word \"new\"\nfor a moment -- when there is further information,\ninformation in addition to what the FDA was told,\nwhether it's 1,000 years old or discovered yesterday;\nand if there is liability predicated on further\ninformation beyond what the FDA was told, then there is\nnot pre-emption.\nIs that a fair statement of your position?\nMR. FREDERICK: That's fair, but let me just\nmake clear that our test would require the FDA to\nconsider and reject the specific basis on which the\nState law --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If that's a fair statement\nthen you have to retract your -- your earlier assertion\nthat whenever it's not safe it's misbranded. I mean --\nMR. FREDERICK: I'm not going to retract\nthat, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- which is it? Whenever\nit's not safe, it's misbranded, or what you just\nresponded to Justice Souter?\nMR. FREDERICK: The basis -- the basis of\nthe FDA's approval is on the basis of limited\ninformation, which Congress has said for public safety\nreasons -- we are not doing a balancing here; we are\ndoing this for public safety --\nAnd if the label is not adequate for public\nsafety it is a misbranded drug.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but if -- if the\nso-called misbranding is determined to be misbranding,\nbased upon information which was given to the FDA, as I\nunderstand your position, you would admit that there was\npre-emption.\nMR. FREDERICK: I -- I think there is\npre-emption, but that does not mean --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. So there --\nMR. FREDERICK: Maybe there is no --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, there is\nthat one exception at least to the broad statement that\nyou gave in answer to Justice Scalia?\nMR. FREDERICK: Let me try to untangle it\nthis way. The fact that there is pre-emption and you\ncannot bring as State law failure-to-warn claim doesn't\nmean that the drug isn't misbranded under the Federal\nstandard the FDA --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the -- but the\nmisbranding is of no consequence to liability.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, if --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, I think\nyou're saying if there -- if there would be pre-emption\nit may be misbranded, but there cannot be any recovery\nin a State tort suit.\nMR. FREDERICK: That's correct. The -- the\npoint --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. So misbranding under\nthose circumstances is a purely theoretical concept.\nMR. FREDERICK: In that very hypothetical,\nyes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. FREDERICK: But the point is that the\nfailure is that the failure-to-warn claim tracks the\nmisbranding provision; and if you look at the jury\ninstructions in this case, the wording is very close to\nthe wording of the misbranding provision in terms of the\nadequacy of the warning that must be provided.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Frederick --\nMR. FREDERICK: All State law is doing is\nproviding a remedy that is absent from Federal law.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Frederick, I'd like to\nput the misbranding point to one side and just\nconcentrate on pre-emption. And I understood you to\nagree with Justice Alito that there is a hypothetical\ncase in which there would be pre-emption, and would you\ntell me what particular fact distinguishes your case\nfrom his hypothetical?\nMR. FREDERICK: The fact is there was no\nconsideration and rejection of a stronger IV push\nwarning. There was no consideration by the FDA of IV\npush as a means of administration distinct from other\nintravenous forms that would lead to a different kind of\nrisk-benefit balancing. So with the -- in the case\nwhere there would be pre-emption, FDA would be asked, we\n-- we want to put a stronger warning as against this --\nFDA says: We don't think there is scientific evidence.\nDo not put that warning on the label.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So now, your friends\non the other side said there was specific consideration\nof IV push as opposed to simply arterial exposure, and\nthat that is laid forth in the labeling. So, as I\nunderstood your answer to be, all we have to do is\nsimply look at the record, and if we think the FDA\nconsidered specifically IV push risks as opposed to\ngeneral arterial exposure, then you lose, and if we\ndetermine that they did not, then they lose.\nMR. FREDERICK: And the Vermont Supreme\nCourt was quite emphatic about this, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I don't know\nif the Vermont Supreme Court was emphatic about it. I\nmean, the record is either -- addresses the FDA -- I'm\nmore interested in what the FDA was emphatic about, and\nthey either address IV push separately or they don't.\nMR. FREDERICK: And you search in the joint\nappendix in vain for communications between Wyeth and\nFDA communicating about the particular risks of IV push.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- can you turn to\nthe references that Mr. Waxman and Mr. Kneedler made?\nThey said oh, yes, IV push was considered discretely\nfrom IV drip bags.\nMR. FREDERICK: I will acknowledge that the\nreferences in some instances suggest IV push. There is\nno doubt that the FDA knew that IV push was a method of\nintravenous administration, but our point is a starker\none, and that is that the FDA never was put to the test\nof deciding comparative risks and benefits of IV push\nversus IV drip. And it's that point that is crucial,\nbecause the catastrophic risks of IV push are so\ndramatic, no reasonable person could have made a safety\ndetermination to allow this drug with its risks when\nthere are corresponding benefits that create exactly the\nsame kind of treatment of care for the patient.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is your argument that\nthey couldn't have considered these comparative risks,\nbecause if they had, they would have come out\ndifferently; because they didn't come out differently,\nwe have to infer that they didn't consider it?\nMR. FREDERICK: It's two things: One, they\ndidn't consider it and that's clearly --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, I --\nMR. FREDERICK: Second,\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Apart from your analysis\nthat they couldn't have or they would have come out\ndifferently, how did we know that they didn't consider\nit?\nMR. FREDERICK: There are communications\nthat went back and forth between the company. These are\nset out in the joint appendix. They make no reference\nto IV push risks as distinct from --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And do these -- when you\nsay \"communications,\" do you mean starting with the\noriginal application for approval of the label?\nMR. FREDERICK: The original application\nactually is not known. It wasn't in Wyeth's files.\nThis drug was approved in 1955. We don't know where the\noriginal label was, Justice Souter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So, you are saying all the\ncorrespondence that we do know about, that is extant,\nfails to mention comparative risk.\nMR. FREDERICK: That's correct. And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the label doesn't. I\nmean, the label ask discusses the high risk from IV push\nand sets forth particular cautions for that -- for that\nspecific means of administration.\nMR. FREDERICK: It does not, Justice Scalia.\nThe label says -- it's talking about intravenous\nadministration. It does not distinguish between IV drip\nand IV push. And Dr. Matthew testified at trial that,\nbased on the label, he would not have been able to make\na treatment determination to distinguish between the\ntwo, and that had he had that information, he clearly\nwould have given this drug to Diana Levine through the\nintravenous drip method. The label simply didn't --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If we conclude that new\ninformation is the criterion for deciding this case, if\nwe reject the argument that misbranding at the outset\nallows State law to supplement the duty, but that if\nthere's new information, then the label has to be\nchanged -- if it that's the line we draw, can this\nverdict be sustained?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes, I think it can be\nsustained on the basis of --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And the Vermont court's\nopinion?\nMR. FREDERICK: I don't think that the\nVermont Supreme Court's opinion totally, because it does\ngo into the area that you're talking about, Justice\nKennedy, but if I could refer the Court to trial record\ntestimony, which is set out in the joint appendix and\nmore elaborately in the trial record itself, which makes\nclear that Wyeth knew or should have known about these\ncomparative risks. It should have had a basis for\nchanging its label or proposing to FDA a different\nlabel, and that would be sufficient to satisfy the\nFederal standards as well as the State duty of due care.\nAnd we think the judgment on that basis could be\nsustained.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this: When did\nthe duty on the part of Wyeth to have a different label\narise, in your view?\nMR. FREDERICK: I think it probably arose in\nthe early '70s when a -- when there was a published --\nor there was an incident --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Did it arise before or\nafter submitting the original drug application?\nMR. FREDERICK: A strong argument can be\nmade that it would have been before the 1970s\napplication when they were reformatting. These are old\ndrugs. We don't have evidence from the 1950s that would\nhave suggested that the original label determination in\n1955 would have caused a difference but certainly by the\n1970s when -- when Wyeth was reformatting this as an old\ndrug to comply with new standards, it should have known\nand it certainly should have known by the 1990s when\nseveral amputations had occurred from IV push Phenergan,\nwhich were in Wyeth's files. The people who analyzed\nthese records, you know, were emphatic that Wyeth knew\nor should have known by the 1990s. And that was clear\nby the testimony of experts that -- that showed the\ncomparison between Vistrol and Phenergan and on the\nbasis of the IV push injuries that had occurred that\nwere nonpublished. They appeared to have been reported\nto FDA, but Wyeth never took the trouble to do the\nsynthesis, to connect the dots between these very\nterrible tragedies that had occurred from its drug, to\nbring about a labeling change or a modification that\nwould have saved lives. And that is a failure on the\npart of the manufacturer not to comply with its\nstandards of due care and with the regulations which\nrequire health risk information to be the basis of\nmodifications to the labeling.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Does that boil down to a\nclaim that there was new information that was available\nbetween the original approval and the time of the\nlawsuit?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, by \"original\napproval,\" do you mean 1955 or do you mean in 1998 and\n2000?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Either one. But is your\ntheory really a theory based on new information or new\njudgment about old information?\nMR. FREDERICK: It would be on the basis, I\nthink, of both. I think we would be able to establish\nthat there was a justification on the basis of\ninformation before the reformatted labeling took place,\nand that was testimony by Dr. Green at trial on the\nbasis of Vistrol, the other amputation that had occurred\nwith Phenergan in 1965.\nAnd the -- the important point here is that\non the basis of new information, if you are going to\nconclude that there is a standard that has to be met, I\nwould urge you to consider two things: One is that the\nburden of showing absence of new information is going to\nfall on the manufacturer because it is asserting a\npre-emption defense, but the way pre-emption gets argued\nin the courts, it is done oftentimes before discovery is\npermitted. So, if there is information in the drug\nmanufacturer's files that would be relevant to a\ndetermination of the breach of duty by the drug\nmanufacturer, if you decide pre-emption has to be done\nbefore discovery can be done, there would be no way to\nget that information.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, to put the burden on\nthe manufacturer seems to me inconsistent with what 10\nStates have said, that there is a rebuttable presumption\nand inconsistent also with the instructions the jury\nreceived in this case, that you can consider the FDA\nlabel. So, I think, to me, what you say there is not\nborne out by what happened in this case or by those\nother States' --\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, let me -- let me\naddress that question because your question goes to the\nregulatory compliance defense and that is not a\npre-emption defense. It is a defense based on State law\nthat the manufacturer in fact was not negligent because\nit complied with the applicable regulations. In that --\nunder that scenario, Justice Kennedy, the plaintiff is\ngoing to be able to obtain discovery and make arguments\nto the trial court about whether or not that compliance\nnegated or did not negate negligence. But pre-emption\nis a Federal defense that would be asserted typically at\nthe outset of the lawsuit before information is\nobtained. And notably, before 2000, FDA did not have\nsubpoena power of drug manufacturers. It did not have\nthe power to force labeling changes. It didn't even\nhave the power to force drug manufacturers to make\npost-marketing studies.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The --the part I'm trying\nto figure out is this: Suppose it was before trial. I\ndon't care, before or after. The plaintiff comes in\nwith a claim. All right. Manufacturer: That's\npre-empted. The claim is that you should have told the\nFDA and added something to your label.\nManufacturer: That's preempted. Plaintiff: Well, you\nhaven't read this reg here. The reg here which has been\nin existence since 1965 says that we can go and add\nsomething. I mean you can go and add something to show\na contra indication, and that's the end of it.\nNow, in fact, 30 years later, I guess,\nwithout the horrible things happening that Justice\nScalia mentioned, or maybe they did -- I don't know.\nBut 30 years later the FDA makes another mention of new\ninformation. I take it that's in 1982. That's the\nfirst time that happened.\nNow, if I'm right about that, what happens\nwhen no one says a word about that? Of course, if the\nmanufacturer had said something about that, then maybe\nthe plaintiff would have said: And it was new. It was\nnew, but the manufacturer doesn't say a word. Are you\nfollowing what I'm saying?\nMR. FREDERICK: I'm not totally, Justice\nBreyer, I confess, but let me try to address it this\nway.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I'm wondering still\nwhat happens. I believe what happened here is that in\nthe argument in the lower courts, in the trial court,\nnobody said anything about the FDA's claim that the\ninformation necessary to just go ahead and change the\nlabel had to be new. Am I right about that?\nMR. FREDERICK: You are absolutely right\nabout that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what I'm trying to\nfigure out -- and I don't know if \"burden of proof\" is\nthe right word -- where nobody says a word about it, who\nwins? If they had said a word about it, you need new\ninformation, maybe the manufacturer -- the plaintiff\ncould have shown that the manufacturer had new\ninformation.\nMR. FREDERICK: I think the duty is always\ngoing to be on the manufacturer, Justice Breyer. The\nregulations at 314.80(b) establish that the -- that the\nmanufacturer has the responsibility to do post-\nmarketing analysis and post-marketing surveys to\ndetermine the continuing safety of its drugs. If the\nmanufacturer doesn't do that, it isn't complying with\nthe Federal regulations which have an ongoing duty on\nthem.\nAnd so in the case where there is silence, I\nwould respectfully submit the manufacturer is not\ncomplying with its regulatory duty to ensure that there\nis current information about all of the side- effect\nrisks of its drugs.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Waxman, you have three minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. WAXMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI want to make -- I do want to go to -- make a\npreliminary point about all the talk about misbranding\nhere. The statute has two criminal prohibitions. One\nis misbranding, which is the original 1906 reactive\npenalty. If the FDA subsequently finds that something\nis false or misleading, it CAN come after you for\nmisbranding. But this case involves the criminal\nprohibition against distributing drugs for which there\nis not an approved, effective application. And that's\nwhat's at stake here.\nNow, the notion that there was any -- any\nmisunderstanding in the trial court about whether there\nwas new information or whether there was -- there were\nincidents that the FDA didn't know about, or it didn't\nevaluate the risk, is just flat wrong. The plaintiff\ntried this -- the plaintiff's experts said the FDA knew\nabout this risk. Wyeth knew about this risk for\ndecades.\nThat is what is so wrong. That is why he\nstood up and said the FDA doesn't decide this question.\nYou decide this question. And there was never, ever a\nsuggestion in the record in this case, nor could there\nhave been, that Wyeth ever failed to bring every single\nadverse-event report to the FDA's attention, every\nanalysis that it did to the FDA's attention.\nAnd what the record does show is that after\n-- between the time of the 1955 approval of the new-drug\napplication and the 1998 rejection of the SDNA, the\nSupplemental New -- SNDA, the Supplemental New Drug\nApplication, that did have more extensive, stronger\nwarnings in this case, Wyeth filed five -- and these are\nall in the joint appendix -- five supplemental, new-drug\napplications, each one asking for more language, more\nwarnings, about direct IV injection. It's not called\n\"push.\" It's IV injection versus drip, which is a\ngravity method. And, in fact, Mr. Frederick\nsays: Well, you know, in this case there could have\nbeen stronger warnings, and that -- and this case wasn't\nreally about -- the jury wasn't really asked to -- it\ndidn't really say that the label had to contra indicate\nsomething that the FDA-labeling required.\nThat is exactly the opposite of what the\ntrial lawyer told the jury at opening and at closing.\nWhat he said is this was unreasonably unsafe because it\ndidn't say: Do not use by intravenous administration.\nWith respect to whether or not the warning\n-- the last SNDA which we submitted, which was in 1987\nand is reprinted in the joint appendix -- not only is it\nan original, but there is a typewritten version that\nactually has the text in the type size that one can\nactually read. At the summary-judgment stage that the\npre-emption issue was decided -- may I finish my answer?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.\nMR. WAXMAN: Summary judgment was decided at\nthe -- pre-emption was decided at summary judgment\nbefore trial. So there was no evidence about what was\nnew or wasn't new. In Ms. Levine's motion for summary\njudgment, she uses the word \"new\" information about\nlabeling change. And, with respect to the proposed 1987\nlanguage, the '88 change that we asked for, she said --\nand I'm reading from page 24 of her motion for summary\njudgment -- \"In 1988, Wyeth drafted changes to the\nwarning which advised that the use of a free-flowing IV\nwould ensure adequate dilution and reduce the risk of\narterial injectia. Although not strong enough, this\nimproved the labeling instruction; if followed, would\nhave prevented the inadvertent administration of\nPhenergan into an artery for the reasons described.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
