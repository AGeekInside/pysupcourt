        "content": "(10:09 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in No. 00 -- oh, pardon me -- 01-332, the Board of\nEducation of Independent School District No. 92 of\nPottawatomie County v. Lindsay Earls.\nMs. Meoli. Meoli I guess. Is -- is that the\ncorrect pronunciation?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LINDA M. MEOLI\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMS. MEOLI: Meoli.\nQUESTION: Meoli, okay. The third time is the\ncharm.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. MEOLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThis case involves the constitutionality of the\nTecumseh School Board's decision to implement a\nsuspicionless drug testing policy for students in\ncompetitive activities as a reasonable response to student\ndrug use.\nTecumseh's policy represents a natural, logical,\nand rational application of this Court's decision in\nVernonia v. Acton. Vernonia's policy applied to students\nwho chose to participate in interscholastic athletics.\nTecumseh's policy applies as well to athletics, but also\nto all the other competitive activities that are offered\nby the district.\nRespondents do not challenge the policy as\napplied to the athletics, conceding that this Court\napproved that practice in Vernonia. Competitive --\nQUESTION: Well, this policy goes beyond what\nwas permitted in Vernonia, does it not?\nMS. MEOLI: Well, it covers --\nQUESTION: It greatly expands the number of\nstudents covered by the policy.\nMS. MEOLI: It -- it covers a wider variety of\ninterscholastic competitive activities.\nQUESTION: And the evidence is not as strong, is\nit, in this case of drug use in the school as -- as was\nthe case in Vernonia?\nMS. MEOLI: Well, Your Honor, we do not believe\nthat is true.\nQUESTION: Well, if you go by the district\ncourt's findings, that's what you'd conclude.\nMS. MEOLI: The district court in Vernonia?\nQUESTION: In this case.\nMS. MEOLI: In this case. No, Your Honor, I --\nI really don't think so. I think there is ample evidence\nin the record to demonstrate a drug problem in Tecumseh.\nQUESTION: What do you --\nQUESTION: By the -- by the young people who\nwere involved in these particular extracurricular\nactivities?\nMS. MEOLI: Yes, we do have evidence of drug use\nwith these students in extracurricular activities.\nQUESTION: Well, what do you make of the -- the\nreports that have been filed up to the eve of the adoption\nof this regulation by the school district with the Feds,\nyear after year after year, saying, things are fine here?\nThe only thing we have to worry about is some beer. Were\nthey lying?\nMS. MEOLI: No, Your Honor, I don't think they\nwere lying. Number one, the district has always admitted\nthat alcohol really is the number one problem in the\nschool district, and that's what the applications for the\nFederal --\nQUESTION: Yes, but they were -- they were\nsaying at the same time that they didn't have a problem\nwith -- with what we usually refer to as drugs.\nMS. MEOLI: They said it -- it wasn't a major\nproblem at that time. And -- and I think if you\ncompare --\nQUESTION: And -- and in point of fact, as I\nunderstand it, since the testing has been carried out\namong the -- the class of people subject to this\nchallenge, there have been only three instances of any\ndrug use found.\nMS. MEOLI: From the -- from the drug testing?\nQUESTION: It would seem -- it seems to me that\nyour evidentiary problem is up to the eve of adopting the\nregulation, the school district was saying, we don't have\na problem. And once the regulation was, in fact, in --\nwas -- was placed into effect, you've gone for several\nyears and you found three instances. I -- I don't see how\nyou -- you don't lose whether we look at it ex ante or ex\npost.\nMS. MEOLI: Let me answer the second part first.\nFirst of all, the -- the policy was only in effect for a\nlimited amount of time in the 2-year span of time. It was\nimplemented halfway into the first school year, and so a\nlimited amount of students were covered in that first\nyear.\nThe second year, the lawsuit was filed at the\nbeginning of August, and therefore only a very limited\nnumber of initial testing was done before the district\ndetermined to hold the policy in abeyance. There were\nfour students in -- under those limited amount of students\nthat tested positive. I know the court of appeals\nreferred to three in one area, but that was just in the\nhigh school.\nQUESTION: But didn't one --\nQUESTION: Well, I suppose the existence of a\npolicy might be expected to deter drug use so that you\nwould have fewer instances after it was imposed.\nMS. MEOLI: Yes, Your Honor, and -- and in fact\nreally --\nQUESTION: We will never know, will we?\nQUESTION: Well, let her answer the question.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. MEOLI: Your Honor, in fact, it -- it really\ndid. I -- I mean, if you even take the limited amount of\ntesting that we did in the 2-year period of time, the\nfirst year three students tested positive, the second year\none student tested positive. The only full year that the\ntesting was applied in the Tecumseh School District was\nafter the district court made its decision but before the\ncourt of appeals overruled it. And that evidence is not\nin the record, but it was -- there was a greater number of\nstudents that tested --\nQUESTION: Ms. Meoli, didn't we say in Vernonia\nthat in Skinner, which was the railroad employee testing\ncase, we did not demand that it be shown that the\nparticular railroad had a drug problem? Didn't we say it\nwas enough that there was a nationwide problem?\nMS. MEOLI: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: We said that in Skinner, and we\nadverted to that in Vernonia.\nMS. MEOLI: And -- and Vernonia's evidence as\nwell showed that there was not a specific drug problem\namong athletes.\nQUESTION: I thought the argument in Vernonia\nand I thought the opinion in Vernonia, in assessing the\nparticular interest of the district, repeatedly emphasized\nthe particular problems with the athletes. The athletes\nwere the ones that the kids looked up to. They were the\nrole models. There was rampant drug use among the\nathletes. There was a rampant disciplinary problem among\nthe athletes. Athletes were getting injured. There was a\nvery specific showing of a specific interest of the\ndistrict.\nAnd now you're coming in and saying, well, that\n-- that really does not matter. And it seems to me that\nthe implication of what you're saying is that this so-\ncalled special needs requirement will apply to every child\nin every school in the United States.\nMS. MEOLI: I'm not saying that, Your Honor. I\n-- I think there is a corollary --\nQUESTION: But isn't that the implication of\nwhat you're saying?\nMS. MEOLI: No, Your Honor, I don't. For\ninstance, you were talking about in Vernonia the athletes\nwere looked up as role models. Well, the athletes in\ninterscholastic competition in Tecumseh are looked at as\nrole models to some students --\nQUESTION: Except for one startling difference.\nThe -- in -- there was a problem with athletes. Here,\none thing that is clear in the record is the -- the school\nboard's admission that the -- that the drug and alcohol\nproblem is more of a problem with those who are not\nengaged in these extracurricular activities. In other\nwords, the testing is directed to a group, those engaged\nin competitive activities, that is less of a problem, as\nfar as drug use is concerned, than the rest of the\nstudents who are idle. And just naturally one would\nexpect what turns out to be the case, that there's more\ndrug use in the group that's not tested than there is in\nthe group that's tested.\nMS. MEOLI: Well, Your Honor, we have never said\nthat the -- the students in interscholastic competitive\nactivities are the only students or even the most likely\nstudents to be abusing drugs. But the evidence that we\nhave in the case demonstrate that they do abuse drugs.\nQUESTION: Well, I'm -- I'm referring\nspecifically to page 100 and 101 of the joint appendix\nwhere the question is whether the students who tend to be\ninvolved in drugs are the ones most likely to be choosing\nextracurricular activities. And the answer ultimately is,\nwe have students that are on drugs, and they are in\nextracurricular activities. They are -- they are -- there\nare probably more that are not in activities.\nMS. MEOLI: That was the testimony of the -- of\nthe board president, Dean Rogers. There's also testimony\nof James Blue that said he really didn't find that\ndifference between --\nQUESTION: Where is that testimony?\nMS. MEOLI: I think it is at page 106, Your\nHonor. Page 106. Now, national studies show that band,\nvocal and non-athletic extracurricular activities\nstudents, they are the least likely of all students to use\ndrugs. Would you agree that this same -- the same thing\nwould hold true for Tecumseh High School students? The\nanswer was, no, I would not.\nQUESTION: He had no basis for saying yes or no.\nMS. MEOLI: Well, yes, he -- he says that\ninitially, and then he goes on to say, I just know that\nall age levels, all categories -- if we're categorizing\nthe students that frequent the park. This part of the\ndeposition was referring to this --\nQUESTION: Yes, but he's not saying, as was the\ncase in Vernonia, that here is a group that we can\nidentify that has this problem. Either there's no\nparticular problem with this group as opposed to all\nstudents -- so, my question is if -- if you can, on the\nabsence of any special showing with respect to this\nextracurricular group, then it seems to me that your\nargument is really that all students can be tested. I\nmean, there was a special circumstance with the athletes\nin Vernonia. Your argument for these extracurricular\npeople I think would hold as well for -- for all the\nstudents because there's no more of a problem and probably\nless among those engaged in extracurricular activities\nthan the -- than among the students that don't do anything\nafter school.\nMS. MEOLI: Your Honor, the use of -- of drugs\namong the students in competitive activities was just one\nof the factors as to why the Tecumseh board selected that\ngroup. I really do think that, in fact, the -- at the\nmeeting that the school district held for the community to\ngive input, they asked that same question, why can't we\ndrug test all students? And I think there's a couple of\nreasons as to why you can't.\nOne of the reasons I think is because students\nin general have a property right in their education.\nHence, they have a legal entitlement to a free public\neducation.\nSecondly, the State compels them to be there,\nand parents, if they do not send their -- their children\nto school, face criminal prosecution. So -- so they are\nthere. And I don't think that you can fashion a drug\ntesting policy that could have the kind of consequences\nthat would deny them that opportunity or -- or prevent\nparents from being persecuted for not --\nQUESTION: Well, if you want --\nQUESTION: You don't -- you don't have to go\nthat far, do you, in order to -- in order to justify\nlimiting it to those who participate in -- in voluntary\nactivities?\nMS. MEOLI: No, Your Honor. We -- we --\nQUESTION: It seems to me you could say even if\nwe could drug test anybody, we made the choice of giving a\nstudent who feels that strongly about not undergoing drug\ntesting the ability to avoid it by simply not engaging in\nthe extracurricular activities. You don't have to forego\ngoing to school entirely or go to a private school. You\ncan simply not participate in extracurricular activity.\nIsn't that in itself a valid reason for limiting it to\nextracurricular activities?\nMS. MEOLI: Yes. Yes, Your Honor. I --\nQUESTION: It's an equally valid argument -- I\n-- I suppose an equally valid argument would -- for -- for\ntesting everybody would be our object is to stop drug use,\nnot to penalize people who go out for band. And there's\nsome evidence in this record that there is more drug use\nabout the -- among the people who are not going out for\nextracurricular activities, but among those who do. And\ntherefore, if your argument is good for this case, it\nseems to me your argument, a fortiori, is good for testing\neverybody in the school.\nMS. MEOLI: Your Honor, the -- the purpose of\nthis program is not to discipline students. It's not to\ncatch them. It is to deter drug use and to help those\nstudents --\nQUESTION: Don't you want to deter drug use\namong those who do not go out for band?\nMS. MEOLI: Yes, Your Honor, I -- I believe we\ndo.\nQUESTION: Then why isn't the argument good that\nyou can test everybody?\nMS. MEOLI: Well, number one, I -- I think there\nis a deterrent effect for implementing this program among\nthe student -- general student body. If they want to --\nQUESTION: Well, I think -- go ahead.\nMS. MEOLI: If they want to try out or -- or\naudition for one of those competitive activities, they\nknow in advance that one of the regulations is to be\nsubjected to drug testing.\nQUESTION: No, but with respect, what you're\narguing is -- is a justification for the present policy\nthat you've got, and I understand your position there.\nWhat I'm interested in and Justice Ginsburg was\na moment ago is it seems to me that if -- if we take your\nargument and we take the evidence that is indicated on the\nrecord, there is at least an equally good argument for\ntesting everybody in the school, whether they go out for\nband or whatnot or -- or do not. And -- and isn't that\nthe case? That's what we're interested in.\nMS. MEOLI: Well, I think there is a reasonably\ngood argument for that. We're not espousing that, but I\nthink --\nQUESTION: No, I realize --\nMS. MEOLI: -- even though -- even -- even if we\nutilize the balancing test that was utilized in Vernonia,\nI -- I think there is a really good argument --\nQUESTION: But if we get to that point, then the\nwhole notion of special need has -- has, more or less,\nevaporated. We don't have the kind of special safety need\nas -- as in the railroad case. We don't have the unusual\ntemptation to crime need as in the immigration case, and\nthe special need is simply the need to deter drug use\namong all children in all schools of the United States.\nAnd -- and if the -- if the theory of this is special\nneed, it seems to me that the concept of special need\nseems to have gotten lost.\nQUESTION: I suppose the distinction that you\ndraw is based on the fact that you have a sanction for the\npeople that you apply it to. You can tell them you cannot\nparticipate in extracurricular activities. But as -- if\nyou applied it to the whole school board -- to the whole\nschool population, rather, you couldn't sanction them by\nsaying you cannot come to school.\nMS. MEOLI: Exactly, Your Honor, and -- and that\nreally is our position because we have to educate the --\nQUESTION: But you could say --\nQUESTION: And the only sanction you impose is\nyou just can't play in the band or -- or cheerlead or\nwhatever it is they want to do.\nMS. MEOLI: You can -- you can remain in the\nclass.\nQUESTION: So, you have a special burden if you\nwant to engage in extracurricular activities.\nMS. MEOLI: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Or how about taking elective classes,\nclasses that the State doesn't require you to take, but\nsome students might like to take?\nMS. MEOLI: Well, Your Honor, we have to draw a\nline somewhere, and -- and even though elective classes\nare a choice --\nQUESTION: Well, I wondered what -- the line\nthat you would draw as a question of the school's policy,\nbut you were saying at least you see a problem with\ntesting everyone because people are compelled to go to\nschool and -- so that's why you resisted drawing the line\nthere.\nMy question is if you're doing a voluntary, then\nwhy don't you say as well, you volunteer for -- you're\ntaking a certain course, this is an elective course. Same\nthing.\nMS. MEOLI: Well -- well, elective courses are\nreally mandatory, Your Honor, in many cases. I mean, you\nhave your core curriculum that are required for\ngraduation, and you also have your electives. You need 24\ncredits in order to graduate from high school. 18 of them\nhave to be in the core subjects. The rest of them are\nelectives. But those are required.\nQUESTION: Except for that, it would be a good\nidea, though, wouldn't it?\n(Laughter.)\nMS. MEOLI: Yes, Your Honor. I -- I think if --\nif we could fashion --\nQUESTION: That's what I thought you'd say.\nMS. MEOLI: If we could fashion a way to do it,\nI believe the majority of school boards would be behind\nit. But -- but at the state of the constitutions of -- of\nthe 50 States and the states of the compulsory education\nlaws that all the States have, I -- I don't think that is\npossible. So, if a line is going to be drawn, I think the\nline can be drawn between the students in the general\nschool population and students in extracurricular --\nQUESTION: May I ask? Is there any other\nsanction other than -- other than ineligibility for\nextracurricular activities? Is there any other sanction\nimposed on a student who is found to have been using\ndrugs?\nMS. MEOLI: No -- no, Your Honor, and in fact,\nthat only happens in this policy under the third time --\nQUESTION: So, really the student could say,\nwell, the worst -- if I go out for extracurricular\nactivities and get caught, it'll be back where if I had\ngone out at all.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: He gets back to square one.\nMS. MEOLI: Well, I think -- I think children\nwho engage in these activities really want to compete. I\nmean, they are really interested in what they are doing.\nSo, they don't want to get caught. And it's also a -- a\nway for these students to say no. Peer pressure among\nelementary and secondary school children is -- is very\nsignificant, and --\nQUESTION: Could you, for that reason, adopt as\na -- as one of our sanctions or a supplementary sanction\nsimply publicity that the person has been caught? Anybody\nwho fails the drug test will have his name and photograph\nposted on the bulletin board. Would that be -- would that\nbe constitutional too? I presume it would be under your\ntheory.\nMS. MEOLI: I -- I think it would be very cruel,\nYour Honor. As -- as to whether --\nQUESTION: It would get the job done.\nMS. MEOLI: -- as to whether it is\nconstitutional or not -- we're -- we're not in -- in the\njob of disciplining students. And -- and we seem to be\ngoing into that realm more and more. This program -- we\ndon't want to put an A on them or a big substance abuse on\nthem. What we really want to do is help those students.\nAnd it may be constitutional to do that, but that's not\nwhat we are asking this Court to do. We're just asking\nyou to give us the tools to deter drug use, to help those\ndrug users.\nAnd -- and if there are no other questions --\nQUESTION: Very well, Ms. Meoli.\nMS. MEOLI: -- my time.\nQUESTION: Mr. Clement.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nA school district that reasonably concludes that\nit faces a drug problem may adopt random drug tests for\nstudents engaged in competitive extracurricular activities\nwithout violating the Constitution.\nQUESTION: Suppose you've had hard statistical\nevidence to show that the kids that go out for the\nextracurricular activities are the ones that really do not\nuse drugs, that the high drug user population is in those\nthat don't engage in the activities. What -- what would\nyour recommendation be to the school board at that point?\nMR. CLEMENT: I think in a case like that, it\nstill might be appropriate for the school district to test\nthe students involved in extracurricular activities, and I\nthink that is because, as this Court has emphasized on a\nnumber of occasions, by making the -- the testing program\napplicable only to an avoidable activity, the -- the\nschool district would be ensuring the reasonableness of\nthe program under the Fourth Amendment.\nQUESTION: But there's some -- we -- we had an\namicus brief by some -- a pediatrics association and so\nforth that pointed out that students that engage in these\nextracurricular activities are, indeed, the least likely\nto be involved in drug use. And it seems so odd to try to\npenalize those students and leave untested the students\nthat are most apt to be engaged in the problem.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well --\nQUESTION: It's just -- it's so\ncounterintuitive, isn't it?\nMR. CLEMENT: A couple of points in response to\nthat, Justice O'Connor. First, there's contrary evidence\nas well, and the petitioners in their reply brief point to\nsome evidentiary studies that showed that really drug use\nis distributed evenly across all groups in the student --\nin the student population.\nThe second thing I would add is that as -- as I\nwas noting in answer to Justice Kennedy's question, there\nis a sense, and which the majority and Justice Ginsburg in\n-- in Vernonia emphasized, that by making the program only\napplicable to activities that are avoidable, you -- you\nlimit Fourth Amendment difficulties. You make the program\nmore reasonable. And as Justice Stevens pointed out, you\nalso avoid any difficult questions that might be\noccasioned by the consequences of a drug testing program\nthat applies to school-wide.\nQUESTION: Well, this in the face of a school\ndistrict that is certifying to the Federal Government they\ndon't have a drug problem. I mean, the whole thing is\nabsolutely odd.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I don't think it's that odd,\nJustice O'Connor. First of all, in terms of the\ncertifications, I would direct you to footnote 23 of the\ndistrict court opinion. And the district court found in\nthat footnote that what those reports really emphasized\nare the relative natures of the problem. Alcohol was the\nmajor problem they faced, but in each one of those --\nthose reports, they note that they do have a drug problem.\nQUESTION: Well, if alcohol is the problem, why\ndon't they address that? This is just -- I mean, it's\nstructured in a way to do very little good it seems to me.\nQUESTION: Mr. Clement, do you think any school\nin the country doesn't have a drug problem?\nMR. CLEMENT: I would be surprised to find a\nschool district that didn't. The national figures on --\non the -- the amount of drug use are really staggering.\nAs we note in our brief, over half of all 12th graders\nhave tried illegal drugs by the time they graduate from\nhigh school. So, I really think that, you know, if\nanything, the burden ought to shift in these cases to the\nother side to show that this one school district is the\none school district --\nQUESTION: Can -- can you tell me --\nQUESTION: In both Skinner and Von Raab, we\nimposed or we permitted the imposition of drug testing on\nthe basis of a nationwide problem, didn't we, without --\nwithout showing that the particular entity in question\nshared in that national problem?\nMR. CLEMENT: That's correct, Justice Scalia.\nAnd I would also point out I'm not sure you want\nto put school districts in the business of trying -- when\nthey -- when they find some incidental evidence of drug\nuse, to try to pin it down to the exact extracurricular\ngroups involved. If a student comes in --\nQUESTION: Well, do --\nMR. CLEMENT: -- for some sort of anonymous drug\ncounseling, I'm not sure they want to ask him what groups\nare you in.\nQUESTION: May I ask? What is your view on --\non the validity of a -- a school-wide drug testing\nprogram?\nMR. CLEMENT: Justice Stevens, we think such a\nprogram would be constitutional, but we think the program\nat issue here --\nQUESTION: So, you would differ from the\npetitioners then.\nMR. CLEMENT: We -- we do have that difference,\nbut we think a program like this is constitutional for\nthree reasons. One, extracurricular students agree to\nadditional intrusions on their privacy and have additional\nsafety risks. Second, as --\nQUESTION: No. But you say they agree to it.\nThey agree to it only under the circumstances that if they\ndon't agree to it, they can't engage in any of these\nactivities. They know perfectly well they'll never get\ninto a competitive college if they don't. And the -- the\nagreement is not simply something that is -- is arrived at\nsort of in the abstract. There's -- there's tremendous\npressure on them to agree to it.\nMR. CLEMENT: Two points, Justice Souter.\nFirst, we're not suggesting this is -- this is\nconstitutional because it's consensual. I think Justice\nKennedy, in -- in his separate opinion in the Ferguson\ncase, pointed out that in these special needs contexts,\nthere's an element of voluntariness which is important to\nthe constitutional analysis, even if it's not voluntary in\nthe full sense of the word.\nThis -- a second and related point about that,\nthough, is that these are avoidable programs, and I think\nthat makes the important difference. And again, as I\nnoted earlier, because they're -- they're avoidable in\nthat sense, it avoids any difficult questions with the\nconsequences that a positive test might generate.\nQUESTION: But it doesn't --\nQUESTION: May I ask you a question that -- that\nis -- concern -- concerns me about the difference between\nthis case and Vernonia? If we -- if we look at what\npeople might expect in the real world, where people know\nthat athletes, professional athletes, Olympic athletes,\nathletes are tested for drugs, but people who are just\neveryday people aren't. So, Vernonia could be regarded as\nall the students who are athletes -- they will be treated\nas athletes are generally. But that's not true of the --\nthe large population of high school students.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I mean, I -- I think one\nfact is that I think it is increasingly becoming true that\n-- that these sorts of policies are in society as a whole.\nAnd one of the petitioners in this case who -- who didn't\nwanted to be drug tested at school had to go get drug\ntested for the job at the Kmart, at the McDonald's. And I\ndo think that probably does have some influence on the\nreasonable expectations of privacy in this area.\nBut I also think that it really doesn't make a\nlot of sense to draw a line on -- on sports, and even\nwithin sports, of course, there are differences. The\nVernonia policy applied to golfers, as well as football\nplayers. Now, I'm not aware that golfers, as a general\nmatter, are tested for substance abuse even on the PGA\nTour. I could be wrong about that, but the point is there\nare differences in the risks even among the athletes, and\nI think this Court in Vernonia didn't make anything turn\non those differences.\nThe dissent in Vernonia pointed out that there\nwasn't any evidence of drug use at the grade school in the\n7th and 8th grade, and that the evidence really wasn't an\nevidence of a disciplinary problem that was specific to\nstudent athletes. And the majority in Vernonia did not --\nwas not -- was not moved by those two points. The\nmajority said that the evidence was good enough in these\ncontexts.\nAnd I think this is an area where deference to\nthe local school boards in their determinations about the\nnature of the problem, the nature of the solution, and\nparticularly the particular students that are going to be\ntested is quite appropriate. It's important to\nrecognize --\nQUESTION: But you would make -- you would make\n-- and I think you've said this -- the same argument if\nthey had decided to have a universal drug testing policy\nin the school.\nMR. CLEMENT: I would, Justice Souter. I do --\nas I said, I think it's a more difficult question. And I\nthink the most difficult problem with a school-wide test\nis what Justice Stevens pointed out, and that would be\nwhat are the consequences of a positive test. But if you\nimagine a school district that -- that faced -- reasonably\nconcluded it faced a serious problem and instituted a drug\ntest where the only ramification of a positive drug test\nwas a confidential notification of the parents, I don't\nsee why that test would violate Fourth Amendment\nreasonableness.\nQUESTION: But at that point, I -- the so-called\nspecial need has become virtually a universal need.\nMR. CLEMENT: I would like to say two things in\nresponse to that.\nFirst, in Vernonia itself, this Court didn't\nidentify the special need as being the drug problem. This\nCourt identified the special need as being the school\nsetting, and that's consistent with this Court's decision\nin T.L.O.\nQUESTION: And -- and the special need would be\na universal need in every school in the United States.\nMR. CLEMENT: I -- I do think it would properly\nrecognize that the school context is different, and that\nschool boards have a freer hand in testing their students\nthan the Government has testing either employees or its\ncitizens at large.\nQUESTION: But if -- if that is the case, what\nis the danger in the school case, comparable to the -- to\nthe railroad worker's danger or the -- the customs\nofficer's danger? What is the danger as distinct from\nsimply the desire to deter illegal drug use?\nMR. CLEMENT: I think the danger is this. I\nmean, it -- and I think Von Raab actually is -- is an\nexcellent counterpoint. This Court in Von Raab said that\nyou could test the customs official because they are on\nthe front line of the drug problems on the supply side. I\nthink by parity of reasoning, children today are on the\nfront lines of the drug problem, but on the demand side.\nThe evidence shows that if you can stop children from\nusing drugs before their 18th birthday, they're not likely\nto start using drugs after that --\nQUESTION: But if --\nQUESTION: The danger is getting young people\nused to a drug culture. You're raising young people in\nschool. And the -- the specific danger is unlike with\nadults. You're forming -- you're forming their habits for\nthe rest of their life.\nMR. CLEMENT: I agree with that, Justice Scalia,\nand I would -- I would add that this is not the only\ncontext where -- where the Federal Government has\nrecognized that difference. The penalties for dealing\ndrugs in a school area or selling drugs to a minor are\nmuch more substantial than those selling drugs to adults.\nQUESTION: I think that's hardly a revelation\nthat the Government is concerned about what drugs do to\nour culture.\nMR. CLEMENT: Absolutely, and I think it's\nperfectly --\nQUESTION: It's not exactly rocket science, is\nit?\nMR. CLEMENT: No, and -- and I don't think it's\nrocket science also to say that that -- that concern is\nparticularly acute with respect to the youngest and most\nvulnerable members of society. And as I say, if you look\nat 21 U.S.C. 859, 860, 861, all of those provisions put\nadded penalties on someone who deals drugs involving\nchildren.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Clement.\nMr. Boyd, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GRAHAM A. BOYD\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. BOYD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nOpposing counsel said we have to draw the line\nsomewhere, and the -- the way to draw the line in this\ncase is to keep in mind the core principle that\nindividualized reasonable suspicion is the standard for\nschool searches set forth in T.L.O. If there's going to\nbe a line as to where do we go past that standard, while\nstill retaining the core of T.L.O. --\nQUESTION: There was no individualized suspicion\nin Vernonia.\nMR. BOYD: There -- there was not, and Vernonia\nis the exception.\nQUESTION: Well, so -- so there goes your\nprinciple.\nMR. BOYD: Vernonia is the exception to the\nT.L.O. rule. It didn't -- it did not overrule T.L.O.\nWhat Vernonia said is that in certain special\ncircumstances, that rule would be set aside. The key --\nQUESTION: You can have medical -- metal\ndetectors in schools where they're afraid the children\nhave guns?\nMR. BOYD: Yes, they can.\nQUESTION: Now, there's no individualized\nsuspicion there, is there?\nMR. BOYD: No, there's not, and the reason --\nQUESTION: Can we take throat swabs if you feel\nthat there is a contagious disease?\nMR. BOYD: Throat swabs if you think there's a\ncontagious disease. I'm not --\nQUESTION: I was trying to -- well, that's what\nI -- I raised that because, of course, everyone is making\na criminal analogy, but nobody is arrested here.\nMR. BOYD: Well --\nQUESTION: Nobody is arrested. This is\ncounseling. It's an effort to deal with the demand side\nof drugs, and -- and I just wonder. That's why I'm -- I'm\nraising, right at the beginning, the question of whether\nthis individualized suspicion is the correct model to\napply.\nMR. BOYD: Well, unless the Court stands ready\nto overrule T.L.O., I believe it is the standard. I think\nwhat's behind your question, Justice Breyer, is -- is a\nquestion about intrusiveness of the search. Obviously,\nthere is a difference between the passive --\nQUESTION: Well, I mean, it's absolutely clear\nthere isn't individualized suspicion, so you win\nautomatically if that's the test, I would think.\nMR. BOYD: Well --\nQUESTION: And, of course, it wasn't in\nVernonia. I would think it wouldn't be in certain\ninstances in the school like guns. And so, rather than\njust start off, as you did, assuming that that's it, I'd\nlike to hear some argument for it.\nMR. BOYD: Of -- of course. Let -- let me try\nto set up what -- what I see as -- as basically how you\nmove from the general rule of T.L.O. to the exception of\nVernonia.\nIn order to set aside that core Fourth Amendment\nprinciple, I think there has to be some nexus to a\nproblem, some connection that is demonstrated to a problem\neither, and preferably both, in terms of safety and drug\nuse.\nBoth of those are missing here. The reason this\nschool expanded its initial policy from athletes to\ninclude non-athletes was because it wanted to appear\nevenhanded. Now, that's not a value that this Court has\nrecognized in the -- in the special needs context. They\ndidn't want to stigmatize the athletes alone through the\ndrug test, so they said, who else can we get? Their\nlawyers said, well, the Seventh Circuit said you can get\nthe non-athletes, and so they expanded it.\nBut let's look at the safety rationale here.\nNow, in Vernonia, the school board said up front, this is\nabout the safety of our athletes, and that's why we're\ndoing it. In this case, the school board's testimony and\nthe testimony of everyone else who has been -- who's --\nwho's testified is that safety is not a reason for this\ntest. There is nothing about the band or the choir that\nis dangerous.\nAnd this is a very important too that we did not\nmake in our briefs I want to bring out. In Vernonia, the\ndrug test was for in-season athletic activities. While\nyou're playing football, you're drug tested. They were\nconcerned about that. In this case, they test year in,\nyear out. If you look at page 198 of the joint appendix,\nthe policy itself says it is in season and out season.\nSo, there's nothing about the activities of Lindsay Earls\nin the choir, who's here today, not a drug user -- there's\nnothing about her activities in the choir that requires\nher being drug tested.\nQUESTION: But the choir is presumably a year-\nround thing in a way that football is not.\nMR. BOYD: No, it's not, Your Honor. All of\nthese activities have competitive seasons, and the\ncompetition is what triggers the drug testing. It's quite\nclear that in the academic team, choir, band, all of these\nactivities, they are participating at a certain point, and\nyet they are drug tested throughout the year.\nQUESTION: Are you saying that, for instance,\nchoir in Tecumseh is only in the fall?\nMR. BOYD: The --\nQUESTION: Or only in the winter or only in the\nspring?\nMR. BOYD: Yes, Your Honor, in terms of the\ncompetitions, they are. There's a class which -- which\nthey are very clear, it is not the reason that drug\ntesting takes place, and someone who's merely in the class\nis not drug tested. But if you go out for the team, as it\nwere, which competes during a limited season, then you are\ndrug tested, although it is for the entire year. So,\nagain, it's not the activities of the choir competition\nthat are of concern to the school.\nQUESTION: Well, give me the quote. Which\nseason of the four seasons is for band in Tecumseh?\nMR. BOYD: I honestly don't know what months of\nthe year they compete in, and -- and in rebuttal, if I'm\nwrong, I'm --\nQUESTION: They can't be for all four seasons, I\nguess.\nBut --\nMR. BOYD: Excuse me?\nQUESTION: -- let me -- let me ask you this.\nWhat -- what they're -- what they're trying to do is to\nfind a basis on which they can implement a program which\nhas an element of consent to it. The Government does not\nthink that's necessary, but that's the case that we have\nbefore us. And so, what the school district has done has\ntaken a set of programs and they said, this is a surrogate\nfor consent, and that's what's happening here. This -- I\n-- I think this goes beyond Vernonia.\nMR. BOYD: Right.\nQUESTION: But we take cases as they come to us,\nand in this case, it is clear that the student who is --\nis so offended by the idea of a search and does not care\nabout the school district's policy of ensuring that drugs\nare school-free doesn't need to participate in the\nextracurricular activity. That's their choice.\nMR. BOYD: Well, Justice Kennedy, you're\nabsolutely right. That's the position here. And frankly,\nI think that's what it comes down to for them. They don't\nhave the safety rationale. They don't have the drug use\nrationale.\nAnd -- and I would actually point to the -- to\nyour concurrence in the Ferguson case where you -- where\nyou, albeit briefly, survey the special needs in drug\ntesting jurisprudence and point out that in all of those\ncases, the activity was, in a sense, consensual or\nvoluntary. I mean, this goes back to Justice Scalia's\nquestion in -- in the initial round, too. If you want to\ndrive a train, if you want to be a customs agent, if you\nwant to be a football player in Vernonia, if you want to\nrun for office in Chandler, these are all activities which\nyou're perfectly free to not do. Now, maybe that weighs\ninto the balance, the constitutional reasonableness\nbalance, somewhat but it certainly is not dispositive.\nAnd when that's all you have, when there isn't the history\nof drug use, when there isn't a safety rationale, when all\nyou have is this, then it's nothing.\nNow, I think also I need to --\nQUESTION: It -- it seems to me if a school is\nbetter than other school districts insofar as drug use,\nthey have less drug use, that they're maybe entitled to\nkeep it that way.\nMR. BOYD: Well --\nQUESTION: You seem to say not. You seem to say\nthere has to be some great crisis where we lose a couple\nyears of kids to drugs, and then we -- and then we move.\nNational statistics just don't support that.\nMR. BOYD: Well, there -- there are a couple of\nthings. I mean, first of all, the -- the crisis\nnationally of drug abuse is one that certainly we need to\nbe concerned about, and I think Justice O'Connor is right\nto point out that the pediatricians, along with the public\nhealth social workers and teachers, all say that this\npolicy of setting up barriers for extracurricular\nactivities is actually counterproductive. It promotes\ndrug use and other dangerous activities.\nBut let me get to precisely the question that\nyou're asking, too. This is a school that has in place\ncameras in the halls, security guards, drug dogs that\nsweep through the school and the -- and the parking lot\nand the students. They search lockers. They have\nteachers who are trained in looking for drug use. They\nhave all of these things in place, and they have a\nmandatory reporting policy that if they discover any drug\nuse, they have to report it. Now, over the years, that's\nadded up to two instances of drugs being found, none of\nthem associated with non-athletes, none of them associated\nwith extracurricular activities.\nQUESTION: Yes, but they have a record here\nthat, of course, suggests if you want to know if drugs are\ngoing on in your school, you ask the kids. You don't find\nthem because nobody is stupid enough to take them into the\nschool. But it's all around and they use them. And here\nthey ask the kids, and the teachers ask the kids, and they\nsay, sure, there's a lot of drug use going on over in the\npark, at parties. That's the record that I saw.\nMR. BOYD: Well --\nQUESTION: And I don't really see how that -- I\nmean, you know, you might be able to drive a millimeter of\nlight between that and Vernonia.\nMR. BOYD: Well --\nQUESTION: So, go ahead and try. But I -- I\ncan't --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: I mean, I -- I -- they did what I\nwould have done. I would have asked my children what's\nreally going on in this school, and they get a positive\nresponse when it's a question of drugs.\nMR. BOYD: Justice Breyer, I -- I think you're\nright. I'm going to go ahead and try. But I think\nthere's -- I think there's an important distinction here.\nWhat the kids said in this case is, to the extent there's\ndrug use going on, who's doing it? It's not the choir and\nthe band and so forth. And I think that that's critical.\nI think that the jurisprudence of this Court in\nlooking at when do you set aside individualized suspicion,\nit says there has to be that connection between --\nQUESTION: Why? Now, I --\nMR. BOYD: Why.\nQUESTION: Of course, if I read the cases, as I\ndo, and they logically require you to win, that's the end.\nYou win.\nMR. BOYD: Sure.\nQUESTION: But just in case it's open --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: -- I would like to know why. I take\nit they've given you some reasons why they've limited it.\nOne, these are the school leaders and maybe it'll spread.\nMR. BOYD: Sure.\nQUESTION: Two, we don't want to put the\nstudent, although we'd really like to, to the choice of\nschool versus drug testing. We'll put him to the choice\nof extracurricular versus drug testing. It's a little bit\nbetter. Okay. That's their reason.\nNow, what do you say?\nMR. BOYD: Well, I -- I mean, I think what's\nperhaps behind your question is a little bit of what's the\nlaw and why is the law that way and a little bit of why\nthe policy --\nQUESTION: I'll tell you what's behind the\nquestion. What's behind the question is that I think\nundoubtedly you're right, that this is a slight expansion\nof Vernonia. You want to say a lot. They'll say hardly\nany. So, it's hard for me to see why, if I came out one\nway in Vernonia, I'd come out differently here. And\nthat's what I want you to --\nMR. BOYD: Okay, fair enough. I -- I think the\nquestion is where do you want to put your focus. If your\nfocus is solely on is there evidence of drug use in the\nhigh school alone, then the difference here I think is\nstill very important. In Vernonia, you had athletes who\nwere skipping class and being arrested. You had people\nsmoking marijuana across the street in plain view. You've\ngot none of that here. I think there is that difference.\nBut I think that also I would ask you to focus\nsomewhere different than what is the overall general\nproblem. I would say that if you take seriously the idea\nof the nexus, or connection, being there in order to take\nwhat is a serious step from individualized suspicion to\nblanket intrusive search, I would say you have to look at\nwhat are the reasons for picking this group. Is it simply\nto be fair to the athletes where a problem may exist, or\nis it -- which is the case here, or is it because there's\na problem here, which is certainly not the case here.\nAnd there's another difference too, Justice\nBreyer, which I think is absolutely critical. In\nVernonia, that was a school where discipline was out of\ncontrol. Discipline throughout the school jurisprudence\nof this Court has been a critical factor. In Vernonia, it\nwas a school that said, quote, we don't have a major drug\nproblem for many years, just like this school. But then\nin the space of 2 or 3 years, they said, discipline\nreferrals have increased by almost threefold. Teachers\nare threatening to quit. We're thinking about mass\nexpulsion of the students. We can't keep control of this\nschool.\nNow, if you look what this school has said, by\ncontrast, let me refer you to the joint appendix. In\ntheir Federal reports, they say -- now, I'm not talking\nabout the drug use here. I'm talking about discipline.\nThey say on page 192, minimal problems have been\nexperienced due to violent safety and discipline problems.\nThat's right in the middle. And in the very last sentence\non that page --\nQUESTION: I don't understand the point of this\nargument, counsel. I mean, is -- is the only reason\nschools want to prevent drug use is that they have unruly\nclassrooms when they have drug use? I should think that\nis the least of the reasons to prevent drug use.\nMR. BOYD: Well, it --\nQUESTION: And -- and what I miss in your\nargument is any recognition of the fact that we are\ndealing here with minors. I mean, you're talking here\nabout a search rather than a seizure, but in the case of\nminors, you can keep them, in effect, imprisoned after\nschool, can you not, if they haven't done their homework\nor something else? The school is standing in loco\nparentis. It is trying to train and raise these young\npeople to be responsible adults. And I think that -- it's\na -- it's a world of difference from -- from what -- from\nwhat the State can do with regard to adults.\nMR. BOYD: Let -- let me -- let me do two\nthings, if I may, Justice Scalia. Let me just quote the\nlast sentence of what I was about to say and then I -- and\nthen, if I may have your permission to address the in loco\nparentis argument, because there's a good answer to that.\nIn terms of the discipline argument, Justice\nBreyer, what the school said is we don't have that\nproblem, and in the last sentence, the discipline policies\nin place at each site have been effective in dealing with\nthe problems. So, I think if one of the things, maybe not\nthe only thing, Justice Scalia, but if one of the things\nwe care about is can the kids learn here, is this a school\nenvironment that is conducive to learning and safety and\ndiscipline, Tecumseh High School has that in hand with\ntheir cameras and guards and dogs and everything else.\nThey don't need this policy. Especially they don't need\nit for Lindsay Earls. I mean, if they want to voluntarily\ntest all the students, they apparently will get many of\nthem, but why should we force Lindsay Earls to -- to give\nup her privacy as part of that?\nQUESTION: You're willing to rest your case on\nthe proposition that the only valid basis for conducting\ndrug searches is to -- is to enable the school to maintain\ndiscipline.\nMR. BOYD: No, no.\nQUESTION: So long as you have a bunch a\ndruggies who are orderly in class, the school can take no\naction. Is -- is that what you want us to --\nMR. BOYD: Absolutely not. Given that we have\nhere a school that has not only discipline in hand, but\nalso drug use itself in hand, especially among these\nactivities, which themselves aren't dangerous, it seems it\nadds up to me the mirror image of Vernonia.\nBut let me address your point, Justice Scalia,\nabout in loco parentis.\nQUESTION: Except for one point that was made in\nVernonia, and it does go across the board, and that was\nthe statement that drug testing on suspicion, which is the\nalternative, because in life, it's everything as compared\nto what. So, if we didn't have the -- the random testing,\nit would be on individual suspicion. And the point was\nmade there that if you had -- if you treated the children\nthat way, you would transform this random process into\nwhat the opinion author called a badge of shame, and that\nit might be worse the risk of singling out the\ntroublesome, but not drug likely student, the one that the\nteacher -- the one that's always the bad boy in the class\nand diverts the teachers --\nMR. BOYD: Right.\nQUESTION: -- who are engaged in that exercise\nfrom the job of teaching to being a police officer.\nMR. BOYD: Justice Ginsburg, there's a good\nanswer to that question. Let me focus on the facts of\nthis case, as they come to this Court. This is a school\nthat already has not had this problem of pointing the\nfinger of -- of accusation at students, although it could\ndo that with its drug dogs and locker searches and\neverything else. When it gets a student for whom there is\nsome suspicion of drug use, say, a -- a drug dog hits on a\nstudent who could easily have had dad's beer spilled on\nthe -- on the sleeve. That will make a drug dog alert.\nThat student is then questioned. That already happens in\nthis school.\nBut there's also a key point that I think was\nmissed in that -- in that discussion in Vernonia, which is\nthat even if -- whichever way you rule in this case,\nsuspicion-based drug testing can and will go forward in\nthis and many other schools. So, even if you have a\nblanket policy, if there is, say, some malicious teacher\nout there who wants to -- to pick out Johnny because\nJohnny is acting bad and -- and put that badge of shame on\nhim, she or he can certainly do that. I don't think that\nthat is a reason to go ahead with the policy that doesn't\nhave a basis in the safety, discipline, or drug use\nrationales.\nNow, Justice Scalia, I'm feeling like I'm not\ngetting to the in loco parentis question, and I do because\nthe -- the short answer is, I believe the brief by the\nparents, the amicus brief -- Jean Burkett is the lead one\n-- really engages this question in a very vigorous and\nintelligent manner. And what they say is this. In loco\nparentis is a doctrine that does not say the school is the\nparent, can take over from the parent. The parent still\nretains certain roles, and the parents in this community\n-- a good number of the parents in this community say I\nwant to raise my kid and I've succeeded so far in raising\nmy kid by having open communication where they can come to\nme and talk and we will -- and we will have that trust\nthere. The school has interfered with that relationship\nby forcing me, the parent, to sign off on this drug test,\nwhich is a different way of raising kids.\nQUESTION: Well, but the in loco parentis\nargument works against you there too because in loco\nparentis also indicates that all children are forced to go\nto this school.\nMR. BOYD: Yes.\nQUESTION: And we have to accept that a majority\nof the parents want to make sure that those children are\nin a drug-free atmosphere.\nMR. BOYD: In --\nQUESTION: And they have -- they -- you seem to\nme to be disparaging about police dogs and locker\nsearches, and maybe that's what you're going to challenge\nnext. But what the -- what -- what the school board has\nsaid is that this is a necessary and effective policy, and\nthat's -- that's all it said.\nMR. BOYD: Justice --\nQUESTION: And there are rights of other\nchildren who want to go to a school which is drug-free, if\nthey can.\nMR. BOYD: Absolutely, Justice Kennedy.\nQUESTION: And it seems to me that's part of in\nloco parentis too because those students are required to\ngo the school just as -- as the drug user is.\nMR. BOYD: You're absolutely right about that,\nand please don't hear me to be disparaging of those other\ntools because those are tools that do not include a\nblanket intrusive search, which is the principle that's at\nissue here. And I actually applaud this school for\nbeing --\nQUESTION: Well, why does it make difference why\nyou applaud it or not?\nMR. BOYD: Oh, it probably doesn't. It probably\ndoesn't.\nQUESTION: We're talking about a constitutional\nquestion.\nMR. BOYD: It -- it does. But -- but the point\nI'm trying to make is that -- is that these other tools,\nwhich they have the legal right to use, are being used\nsuccessfully.\nIn loco parentis I think comes into play when\nyou have a school like Vernonia where, as -- as you put\nit, Justice Kennedy, the rights of the other students,\ntheir ability to get an education and to themselves stay\ndrug-free is being interfered with. Now, if we were\ntalking about the Vernonia school --\nQUESTION: Are you saying that the in loco\nparentis principle does not apply in the case of a school\nif a minority of parents object to what the school is\ndoing?\nMR. BOYD: That's not my position.\nQUESTION: Well, I thought that was what you\nwere saying a moment ago?\nMR. BOYD: Let -- let me please try to be more\nclear about that. It depends on what the issue is and\nwhat's happening in the school. When there is an issue of\nschool discipline, say, in the Fraser case or the\nHazelwood case, where you had student conduct that was in\na sense -- well, certainly had -- had a element of\nconnection to constitutional protection, but yet affected\nthe rights of other students to be able to learn in that\nenvironment, then --\nQUESTION: Well, how did -- how does Hazelwood\nfit that description?\nMR. BOYD: Well, because of the disruption that\ncould be caused by the -- by the school paper articles.\nMy -- my point is that where disruption --\nQUESTION: I don't think the reason in Hazelwood\nwas -- where the discipline was justified was -- caused\ndisruption, but because when you're learning in school,\nyou follow the instructions of the teacher.\nMR. BOYD: Well, and also the form issue. I\nmean, I -- I think that's certainly there and I don't -- I\n-- I brought this upon myself by bringing up the case, but\nI hope --\nQUESTION: You did, yes.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BOYD: I did. I did. I did and I apologize\nfor that.\nBut my point is that the in loco parentis\ndoctrine more broadly comes into play when the rights of\nthe student who says, I want to -- or the minority comes\ninto conflict with -- with the environment of the school\nof learning and discipline. And that's -- that was the\ncase in Vernonia. That's not the case here. And it's\ncertainly not the case if you think of it in terms of the\nrights of the student --\nQUESTION: Now, say again why you -- you think\nthe Vernonia situation, with respect to this point, is\ndifferent than the Tecumseh.\nMR. BOYD: Sure. It's -- it's really the point\nI was making to Justice Breyer about discipline in the\nschool. Vernonia had convincingly shown and the district\ncourt found that there was a discipline problem that was\nout of control that was directly tied to drug use by\nathletes. They wanted to address this problem by going\nafter the thing that was connected to it.\nNow, this is a school that doesn't have any of\nthat. It doesn't have the discipline problem. It doesn't\nhave the drug use.\nQUESTION: Well, but that -- that question has\nbeen batted back and forth -- you're -- you're not saying,\nare you, that unless the school has the sort of discipline\nproblem they had in Vernonia, it can't do this?\nMR. BOYD: No, I'm not. No, I'm not, although I\nthink that when you have neither a discipline problem nor\na drug use problem among the tested students, nor a safety\namong the students tested, I don't see how you get within\nVernonia at all unless Vernonia sort of quietly,\nimplicitly said what we really meant to say was drug test\neverybody because those principles do apply to all 24\nmillion secondary school students in this Nation. And so\nI don't --\nQUESTION: May I ask on the drug test? If you\nhad a choice, in terms of which is the -- I understand you\nthink this is clearly unconstitutional. Would it be more\nunconstitutional or less unconstitutional to test\neverybody?\nMR. BOYD: I'm not really sure that one can --\ncan rank more and less constitutional. Both seem to me\nplainly unconstitutional. The only constitutional way to\ngo beyond individualized reasonable suspicion is to\nidentify a problem in a school and devise a solution that\nhas a close nexus to that particular problem, and that\ncertainly isn't the case here.\nLet me put that a little bit differently,\nJustice Stevens.\nQUESTION: Of course, Justice Scalia would --\nwould respond by saying, well, everybody knows there's a\npotential problem in every school in the country, and\nthat's enough. And why isn't that an effective argument?\nMR. BOYD: It's not -- it's not enough because\nwhat I would say is that it is really that the balancing\ntest behind the Fourth Amendment reasonableness\nrequirement becomes one where there's no weight on one\nside of the -- of the balance. That's a little vague, so\nlet me --\nQUESTION: Why is that? Now, they've come in\nwith a brief on the other side and said, you know, despite\nthe fact that we're spending X billion dollars, two-thirds\nof which goes on the supply side for interdiction --\nMR. BOYD: Right.\nQUESTION: -- demand has stayed constant among\nteenagers, and it's about 20 to 30 percent of all of the\nchildren in these high schools who take drugs. Now, if\nyou know that that is a fact, why is it -- and if you know\nthis is a typical high school, why isn't that enough to do\njust what you said would be constitutional, to say here's\na particular problem, 20 to 30 percent of the kids are\ntaking drugs, and we want to come in with a solution\nthat's tailored to that?\nMR. BOYD: Well, it's -- you know, the number is\nprobably, according to Mr. Clement, is more like 50\npercent, and -- and that 50 percent of -- of the kids in\nthe high schools are using drugs.\nQUESTION: All right. Then it's much worse than\nI thought.\nMR. BOYD: And --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: And then if that -- if that's fine,\nthen -- then there is the problem you talked about, which\nI just heard you say. And so, if -- you said if there's a\nproblem of a serious sort, and that this is tailored to\nthat problem, they can do it. All right. So then why\ncouldn't they do this on that theory?\nMR. BOYD: Well, if it's 50 percent nationally,\nthis school in its reports to the Federal Government says\nthat its school-wide drug use based on its own surveys,\nwhich is where the national data comes from, surveys, is 5\npercent. 5 percent.\nQUESTION: All right, 5 percent. I mean, maybe\n-- maybe they exaggerated in that report. I guess I'd\nhave to take the finding of the district court here, and\nwhen I read the district court opinion, I thought the\ndistrict judge thought it was a fairly serious problem.\nMR. BOYD: Well --\nQUESTION: He didn't put numbers on it.\nMR. BOYD: Right, he did not.\nQUESTION: But you used the word serious\nproblem. So --\nMR. BOYD: Okay. What -- what I wanted to say,\nJustice Breyer, is this. If you take the school at their\nown word, that their data shows that it's at 5 percent,\nand you take the school board president and all three\nteachers at their word in saying, to the extent that that\ndrug use -- that 5 percent is there, it tends not to be\namong these activities, and if you take this Court\nseriously in articulating a nexus test, there simply is\nnot a nexus between choosing these non-athletes who, both\nin terms of school versus Nation and the non-athletes and\nthe school versus the other students, are really\nexceptionally unlikely to be using drugs. It's a terribly\npoor --\nQUESTION: Now, in your opinion a school that\ndid find that it was within, let's say, half the average,\nsay 20 percent or 25 percent, and they did feel that a\nsignificant number of their extracurricular activity\nstudents were involved in that, if -- if they've heard\nthat through hearsay or any other way that was reasonably\nplausible for policy makers, they could then do this in\nyour opinion.\nMR. BOYD: No, they could not because there\nstill is a need for a safety rationale. There is not a\nsingle case in which drug testing has been upheld by any\ncourt, outside of this line of cases for extracurricular\nnon-athletes.\nQUESTION: Well, what was the safety rationale\nwith golfers in Vernonia?\nMR. BOYD: Well, the safety rationale -- I mean,\ncertainly the Court in Vernonia didn't talk about golfers\none way or another, but --\nQUESTION: Well, but you're -- you're saying\nthat Vernonia was based on a safety rationale. Its\ntesting included golfers.\nMR. BOYD: Well, in Vernonia, the Court talked\nat some length about the safety rationale. Justice\nKennedy, in his -- in his Ferguson concurrence, also\ndescribed the Vernonia holding as -- as being about\nstudents who are athletes and face these danger risks.\nNow, reasonableness, Your Honor --\nreasonableness -- it does need to turn in the end on some\nkind of reasonable line drawing. I think it was\nreasonable for the Court to say in Vernonia, the line that\nwas drawn by Vernonia among athletes, the vast majority of\nwhom are doing things that, if not involving physical\ncontact, certainly involve exertion of the court, that in\nthe opinion of the Court could cause death. Death was\nwhat was -- the word that was used by this Court. Also,\nin Skinner, death from train accidents; in Von Raab, death\nfrom misguided bullets. Those were the stakes in those\ncases.\nHere you've got a choir.\nQUESTION: How about death from overdose?\nMR. BOYD: Death from overdose is certainly a\nconcern, but there's no --\nQUESTION: I mean, do you think life and death\nis -- is really not involved in -- in the fight against\ndrugs?\nMR. BOYD: It absolutely is, Justice Scalia, and\n-- and where there's --\nQUESTION: Let's not minimize that.\nMR. BOYD: I don't mean to, and where there is\nevidence of drug use among a group of students, then I --\nQUESTION: As far as -- as far as the extent of\nthe drug use is concerned, this is an elected school\nboard, isn't it?\nMR. BOYD: It is.\nQUESTION: Why -- why should I trust your\nassessment of how serious the drug problem is and what\nmeasures are reasonable to counter that -- that\nseriousness over the assessment of -- of the local\ncitizens who -- who elect their school board, and their\nschool board says we have a big enough problem that we\nwant to use this draconian measure?\nMR. BOYD: Well, I think if we listen to the\nschool board and to the school administration, who\nthemselves are even closer to that problem, what they say\nis, we've identified enough of a problem that initially we\nwant to test our athletes. And they directed Mr. Jacobs\nto go off and draft a policy for athletes. He did so.\nThey came back and he said, you know, we feel kind of bad\nabout stigmatizing our athletes. Who else can we test?\nNow, that's not identifying a drug problem.\nIn fact, the best evidence in this case is what\nthe school itself says to the Federal Government where the\nFederal Government says, now, remember these reports, when\nthey write them, they say, tell us what you know, not\nbased on just sort of vague evidence, but tell us what you\nreally know about drug use, do some surveys, ask some\nquestions, look around. The school did that, and over the\ncourse of a number of years, they said consistently\nexactly what Vernonia said back before it had a problem.\nWe don't have any --\nQUESTION: Suppose -- suppose the school\ndistrict said, we're going to have two schools and you can\ngo to either one. One, they don't have dogs or -- or\ntests or anything else. It's the druggie school.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: And -- and the other school -- and\nthe other school is they have mandatory testing for\neverybody. Would that be constitutional? And then your\nclient could go to the druggie school.\nMR. BOYD: I don't think so because I think even\nby the nature of that hypothetical, it presupposes one of\nthe schools is going to be vastly inferior on a number of\ngrounds.\nQUESTION: Vastly experience why?\nMR. BOYD: Excuse me?\nQUESTION: Why? Because there are drug users\nthere.\nMR. BOYD: Well, I -- I think -- no, I don't\nthink that's the reason why. I think --\nQUESTION: No parent -- no parent would -- would\nsend the child to the first school that I suggested, other\nthan perhaps your client wants to go there.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BOYD: Well, she absolutely would not, Your\nHonor. I mean, Lindsay Earls is -- is a young woman, a\nfreshman at Dartmouth now, who hasn't used drugs. She was\ndrug tested and she passed, and no one has suspected her\nof using drugs. I'm sure my -- my opposing counsel would\nattest to that.\nQUESTION: Can -- can -- doesn't -- don't magnet\nschools have rules for uniforms and so forth that they're\n-- they're completely optional? A school district could\nhave two schools, one with -- one with no testing, the\nother with testing. Then you have a choice.\nMR. BOYD: I think uniforms are a world apart.\nThere's not an intrusive blanket search.\nQUESTION: Well, they're not covered by the\nFourth Amendment.\nMR. BOYD: Exactly.\nQUESTION: I mean, isn't that the problem?\nMR. BOYD: It is.\nQUESTION: What do you -- do you say just\nfrankly to the argument, forget individualized need,\nforget special need entirely, forget suspicion? We're\nstanding in loco parentis and if we think it's reasonable\nto do it, we can do it. What's the answer to that\nargument?\nMR. BOYD: I -- I think the answer to the\nargument is the Fourth Amendment turns on reasonableness.\nIt's not a majority rules standard. And I think you have\nto look at the incremental intrusion here, and this is a\npoint that I don't think has been made today. But with\nschool athletes, they already submit a urine sample.\nQUESTION: That doesn't answer the question.\nThe question -- yes, it turns on reasonableness, but what\nJustice Souter's question suggests is that the -- the\nissue is whether it would be reasonable for a parent who's\nconcerned about drug use on the part -- on the part of his\nchildren, to be this intrusive. That is the question.\nMR. BOYD: For a parent to do it -- I -- well, I\nsee that my time is up. May I --\nQUESTION: Yes. I extend your time by 30\nseconds.\nMR. BOYD: Thank you.\nA parent can do many things that are different\nthan what a school could do. The fact that a parent could\ndo a drug test is exactly the reason -- and in Tecumseh\nthey could do that. That is not a reason for a school to\ndo it in circumstances where there is not a demonstrated\nproblem among the students who were being tested with a --\nwith a solution that's actually tailored in any reasonable\nfashion to meet that problem. Otherwise --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Boyd.\nMs. Meoli, you have 1 minute remaining.\nMS. MEOLI: Mr. Chief Justice, if there are no\nfurther questions, I'll waive the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well.\n"
