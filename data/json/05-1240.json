        "content": "(11:05 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Wallace versus Kato and Roy.\nMr. Flaxman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH N. FLAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FLAXMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThis case presents the Court with the\nquestion it addressed in Heck versus Humphrey raised in\na slightly different context.\nThe context in Heck was of a prisoner whose\nconviction had been affirmed who was in prison, who had\nfiled a civil rights case that would have had the\npractical effect of collaterally challenging his\ncriminal conviction. The context in this case is of a\ncivil rights plaintiff who has prevailed in his criminal\ncase, who was imprisoned for 8-1/2 years fighting the\ncriminal case and comes to Federal court with a Section\n1983 action saying, I now seek a remedy for my\nunconstitutional incarceration, and files his lawsuit.\nThe court in Heck held that this action, an\naction to recover damages for unconstitutional\nconviction or imprisonment, accrues when the conviction\nis set aside. That's the principle that we asked the\ncourt of appeals to apply and the court of appeals said:\nWe're not going to apply that because we will adopt a\ncategorical rule without any implied exceptions\nwhatsoever that says when you're arrested you have 2\nyears, which is the statute of limitations in 1983 cases\nin Illinois, to file your claim for damages.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Flaxman, one starting\npoint. You say that this case should be just like Heck,\nbut in Heck the core problem was the line between 1983\nand habeas, right?\nMR. FLAXMAN: Well, that was one view of the\ncore problem.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But at least this case\ninvolves no such concern about habeas.\nMR. FLAXMAN: That's correct. In Heck the\nCourt solves the core problem by concluding -- by\ndenying the existence of a cause of action for damages\nuntil the criminal case had been resolved in favor of\nthe civil rights claimant, which is the rule, the common\nlaw rule for malicious prosecution. That's the solution\nthat the Court came up with in Heck, which is the\nsolution that the petitioner believes should be applied\nin this case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But only if, only if the\nchallenged evidence, the challenge to the evidence, if\nsustained, would necessarily -- and this is the crucial\nlanguage -- invalidate the criminal conviction.\nMR. FLAXMAN: That's what would have\nhappened in this case, as the dissenting judge in the\npetition for rehearing --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would necessarily have?\nYou could have said that ex ante?\nMR. FLAXMAN: Absolutely. In criminal cases\nthere's discovery and the criminal defendant knows what\nthe prosecution --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't know what other\nevidence there might have been in the criminal case. Ex\nante you can't tell.\nMR. FLAXMAN: You do know because it's\ndisclosed in discovery. We don't do trial by ambush any\nmore in criminal cases. The defendant knew that all the\nevidence against him was the alleged --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but he did\nnot know that for years later. I mean, they don't have\nto bring a prosecution immediately. They can wait until\nthe day before the statute of limitations runs.\nMR. FLAXMAN: Well, there is no statute of\nlimitations for murder in Illinois.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then they can\nwait a long time.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FLAXMAN: If he's incarcerated that\nwhole time awaiting the filing of charges, then his\ncause of action would not have accrued. But the more\nlikely scenario is that he would be arrested --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is that -- I mean,\nyour friend on the other side says that the cause of\naction would have accrued at the moment at which he was\nbound over by the decision of an independent magistrate.\nAt that point the false arrest and the incarceration\nincident to the false arrest is over and if there is\never going to be a claim for what happens next, I gather\nit'ss going to be a common law action for false\nimprisonment, and that, I guess, would not accrue until\nthe imprisonment is over. But so far as the arrest is\nconcerned, whatever whatever wrong is done, that wrong\nis completed at the point at which an independent\nmagistrate takes over.\nMR. FLAXMAN: If the claim was solely\ndirected at the arrest, then Your Honor would be\nabsolutely correct. The claim in this case, the cause\nof action, is not that he was taken off the street\nwithout probable cause. The core of the cause of action\nis that the respondent police officers exploited that\narrest to get this untruthful confession that was used\nto hold Mr. Wallace in custody for 8-1/2 years, to seize\nhim for 8-1/2 years. It's not just the arrest. It's\nthe arrest plus exploiting it.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But all of that occurred,\nas I -- correct me if I'm wrong on the facts, but I\nthought all of that occurred prior to -- I don't know\nwhat they call it in Illinois, but prior to a bind-over\nhearing or prior to the point at which the judiciary\nsteps in, breaking the, as it were, the chain of\ncausation between what the police do and the subsequent\nincarceration.\nMR. FLAXMAN: Under Malley versus Briggs, it\ndoesn't break the chain of causation if we adhere --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but just as a factual\nmatter is it correct -- is it correct as a factual\nmatter that the confession that was given was a\nconfession that was given before there was any judicial\nintervention, before he was brought before a magistrate?\nMR. FLAXMAN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. FLAXMAN: There was no other evidence\npresented to the magistrate or that could have been\npresented to the magistrate other than the confession to\nshow --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, Mr. Flaxman, is your\nargument limited to that situation, where there is no\nevidence whatsoever against the criminal defendant other\nthan the illegally seized evidence? Or would it apply\nin some situations in which there is some additional\nevidence?\nMR. FLAXMAN: If there's some additional\nevidence, we could not say was necessarily -- would\nnecessarily imply the invalidity of the conviction. And\nwould be -- that's not our situation.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Any additional evidence,\neven if it would be insufficient to support a\nconviction, takes -- makes make this -- would make this\na different case.\nMR. FLAXMAN: I would not say -- well, it\nwould make it a different case. But if I was arguing in\na case where there was a little bit of evidence, but not\nenough to say there's probable cause to accuse him of a\ncrime, I would say that suppressing or eliminating the\nconfession would necessarily imply the invalidity of any\nconviction.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What, what does necessarily\nmean? Does it mean no additional evidence? Does it\nmean no additional evidence that is insufficient to\nsupport a conviction? Does it mean no additional\nevidence that would be likely to persuade a trier of\nfact?\nMR. FLAXMAN: What I think it means is that\nthere's no conviction -- what I think it should mean --\nand I'm not trying to debate the dictionary, what I\nthink it should mean is that if there is no evidence\nother than after -- that is excluded, to base a\nprosecution on, as in this case where the man is let go,\nbecause there is no evidence to prosecute him, that that\ndoes imply the invalidity of the conviction.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, in this case, let me\njust me more question on it. In this case, suppose\nthere had been a witness who said at about the time when\nthis murder took place, I saw somebody who was between,\nI would judge as between the age of 15 and 25, average\nheight, average build, running away. And let's say that\nyour client fits that description. Now would that be\nenough to take this case out of the rule that you're\narguing for?\nMR. FLAXMAN: No. Unless that witness could\nsay and the man who I saw then is the defendant in\nthis -- is the criminal defendant, Mr. Wallace. There\nwas an eyewitness in this case. And he could not make\nan in-court identification of Mr. Wallace. And the\nprosecutor realized that that wasn't enough evidence on\nwhich to base a criminal prosecution, and gave up.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Again, you didn't, you\ndidn't know that at the time the arrest was made, or at\nthe time the confession was extorted, or at the time he\nwas bound over. You really didn't know that until the\ntrial. For all you knew, they might have found in\naddition to the confession, they might have found\neyewitnesss who would have identified your client. You\ncouldn't tell that until the trial.\nMR. FLAXMAN: Well, that would have been\nvery unfair if they withheld -- they ambushed the\ndefendant with --\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, well -- until the trial\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Until the trial, until the\nprocess of trial began.\nMR. FLAXMAN: Well, we didn't know that\nbecause there weren't any, because this man didn't\ncommit that crime. We are talking -- in the\nhypothetical, I think we should set, start with\nMr. Wallace being an innocent man, who was arrested\nunlawfully, who gives an involuntarily -- an involuntary\nfalse confession. And on the basis of that is held for\neight and a half years, finally wins the case, is set\nfree, and then sues the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But, but you presume in\nyour last answer that other than that, there is an\nabsolutely fair prosecution.\nMR. FLAXMAN: Other than the fact --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, why do we make\nthat assumption when we start out with the allegation of\na tort and a violation of the Constitution? I don't\nunderstand.\nMR. FLAXMAN: Well, the tort is against the\npolice officers who made an unlawful arrest and\nexploited it to get the evidence that was used to hold\nMr. Wallace. The, the problem with saying that\nMr. Wallace has to sue, as soon as he files his motion\nto suppress, he should have filed his Section 1983\naction, would produce a multitude of 1983 actions.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What about the fact --\nsuppose that there were even a more serious battery\nhere, a broken limb or something. Would you have to sue\nfor the damages for the battery right away? The police\nofficers injured --\nMR. FLAXMAN: No. If excessive force was\nused against somebody when they're being arrested,\nthat's a claim that everyone agrees accrues at the time\nof the injury.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what about this\ncase?\nMR. FLAXMAN: This case would necessarily\nimpair the validity of the conviction. If --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the conviction in Heck\nexisted at the time of the alleged tort. And what Heck\nsaid is where you have an outstanding conviction, and\nyou have a constitutional tort, you can't sue on that\nconstitutional -- and where -- you cannot sue on that\nconstitutional tort if the decision on the tort would\neffectively contradict your conviction. Until the\nconviction has been set aside.\nWell, this is not that situation. There was\nno outstanding conviction involved. So why did you have\nto wait?\nMR. FLAXMAN: Well, you had to wait because\nit would -- it would be a fruitless act to file the case\nwhile the case -- file a Federal case while the state\ncriminal case was pending. But --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm still, I'm still\npuzzled about my question. Suppose there's a battery\nresulting in a serious injury to the defendant.\nMR. FLAXMAN: That claim would --\nJUSTICE KENNED: But there's other evidence\nand so forth. Can you sue for the battery at once?\nMR. FLAXMAN: You can sue and you have to\nsue for the battery immediately.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why is that the situation?\nMR. FLAXMAN: Why is that different?\nBecause this --\nJUSTICE KENNEY: And -- or is it just\nbecause of the assumption that the conviction might\nstand anyway.\nMR. FLAXMAN: Well the conviction generally\ndoes stand with -- the battery generally has nothing to\nwith the conviction.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But if does, then you\nwait?\nMR. FLAXMAN: If it is an element of the\noffense, you wait. Or if it is an element of what could\nbe the defense in a criminal case.\nBut getting back to the Heck question, in\nHeck the court looked to the common law for the\nappropriate rule to apply to the cause of action that\nMr. Heck was applying.\nIf we look to the common law for the\nappropriate rule for Mr. Wallace, we don't come up with\nthe Seventh Circuit's rule of immediate accrual. We\ncome up with the rule --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the point, the\nwhole point of Heck was to avoid 1983 becoming an end\nrun around habeas. But here you don't have that problem\nbecause you don't have any available relief under habeas\nunder Stone versus Powell.\nMR. FLAXMAN: Well, we don't know before the\ncriminal case starts whether Mr. Wallace will receive a\nfull and fair hearing on his Fourth Amendment claim.\nAnd until we know that we don't say Stone versus Powell\nwould bar a Fourth Amendment claim. We don't know that\nthe state will give Mr. Wallace an attorney who can stay\nawake, who can file a motion, who knows that there is a\nFourth Amendment, and Mr. Wallace might end up not\ngetting a full and fair hearing and might have a valid\nclaim cognizable with Federal habeas corpus that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there many cases in\nwhich the rule of Stone versus Powell is inapplicable\nfor that reason?\nMR. FLAXMAN: No. But there are some. It\nis not a non-existent occurrence in.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What happens -- I'm trying\nto think of what the problem is for you. On January 1,\nyour client's arrested unlawfully. Now suppose the rule\nwas you have two years to file it, starting now. What\nis the problem for you? The problem is maybe in a year,\nor maybe less, the police start to prosecute him. In\nthe meantime, your trial is going forward because you\nfiled it on time. So when they start to prosecute him,\nyou don't yet know what's going to happen. And it could\nhappen that he's convicted and you think it's illegal\nbecause of the arrest and necessarily so.\nAnd therefore you have to stop the trial, I\nguess, because of Heck.\nMR. FLAXMAN: The civil trial will be stayed\npending the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That would work, I guess.\nThey'd stop it and then they'd have to bring it -- you'd\nhave to stop it and then you'd have to go through these\nother remedies and they you'd have to go back to it.\nMR. FLAXMAN: It would be on the district\ncourt's docket for ten years waiting the final --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But that would work.\nMR. FLAXMAN: It would, well, it would be a\nhorrible --\nJUSTICE BREYER: A mess.\nMR. FLAXMAN: -- a horrible mess for the\ndistrict court. It would not work because --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose I modify it.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why would it be a mess? I\nmean, it seems to me that the district court, once it is\nfiled -- something is filed within the two year statute,\nthe district court can tell virtually immediately\nwhether there are criminal proceedings that are yet to\nbe held, and the district court can simply, it can\nsimply stay further proceedings until those criminal\nproceedings are over. If there's a possibility of\ncollateral attacks, the district court can simply say\nhey, are you going to file a collateral attack? And if\nthe answer is yes, stay it further. If the answer is\nno, go ahead with it then. What's tough about that?\nMR. FLAXMAN: Well, the district judge will\nnot allow a civil case to go forward because it would\nallow the criminal defendant --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's the premise of my\nquestion. But I mean it seems to me to be fairly easily\nadministered.\nMR. FLAXMAN: Well, I mean, I, I shudder to\nthink of 20,000 cases on district court dockets being\nstayed while criminal cases are being resolved.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: 20,000 might make me\nshudder. But we got one.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FLAXMAN: We have one. The criminal\ndefendant will be disinclined to file his civil rights\ncase on time because it will be used against him in his\ncriminal case to impeach his bias.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well -- explain that.\nMR. FLAXMAN: It will impeach his bias. If\nhe, when he testifies in the criminal case, he will be\ncross-examined, aren't you seeking money damage from the\npolice officers? Don't you want to make money from this\ncase? And the jury will consider that when they weigh\nthe truthfulness of the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And don't you think that a\ncivil action which necessarily has to be stayed, might\nbe a basis for, for the court in the criminal case to\nlimit that kind of cross-examination?\nMR. FLAXMAN: Not in the Circuit Court of\nCook County. That cross-examination will occur every\ntime a civil --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Are there appeals from the\nCircuit Court of Cook County?\nMR. FLAXMAN: There are appeals and.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, don't you -- don't\nyou think ultimately you could get that issue resolved?\nMR. FLAXMAN: No. I am absolutely confident\nthe Illinois courts at the highest level will say that\nis proper cross-examination.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Come -- come back here.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose it is complicated.\nI want to suggest a modification with this suit here.\nYou say you have to file within two years. But wait,\nyou have -- we tolled the statute. If the person is\narrested and charged, and convicted, for all the time\nthat is going on, it is just tolled, equitably. And\nafter the conviction, if he's acquitted, by the way, or\nhe isn't arrested, the statute starts to run again.\nNow if he's convicted, as long as you have\nfiled, proceeding to challenge the conviction, it is\ntolled.\nNow, would that -- that it seems to me would\nhelp every problem you have, and it would be called\nequitable tolling. And that's been suggested by judges\nin different forums and many states have it.\nAnd what's the problem? That just solves\nthe problem, doesn't it?\nMR. FLAXMAN: Well, I have four answers. I\nhope I can get them out.\nIf Heck instead of adopting a rule of\naccrual and denying existence of a cause of action had\nestablished the Federal tolling rule, saying that these\ncauses of action are tolled while you're in custody,\nthat would have solved the problem.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right, well, we could\ndo it in this case.\nMR. FLAXMAN: Well, I, I -- the Court\ncertainly can do it. It would require carving a hole\ninto, into Tomiano with this --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, it would\nrequire overruling our cases that say for tolling, your\nborrow state law --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What cases require\noverruling?\nMR. FLAXMAN: Unless state law is\ninconsistent with Federal Board of Regents versus\nTomiano, I think the Court could say that. The other\nthing that the Court should be aware of is that the\nSeventh Circuit, and I think four other circuits follow\nthe common law rule that you can't have a 1983 action\nabout a false arrest if you have been convicted of the\ncharge on which you were arrested. So these cases would\nnot be brought in the Seventh Circuit and the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, it seems to me\nidentical to the rule you are advocating but with one\ndifference. The difference with the rule you are\nadvocating is a judge who is going to be judge at time A\nwith your first case, is going to have to guess whether\nit is in this case or not in this case necessarily\nrelated to some kind of challenge to conviction you're\ngoing to bring later if you happen to get convicted.\nMR. FLAXMAN: I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: There is no way to guess\nthat.\nMR. FLAXMAN: I think tolling, a Federal\ntolling rule for this cause of action, while someone in\ncustody although a criminal conviction is, has not been\nresolved in favor of the defendant, criminal defendant,\nwould be an excellent solution.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And is there anything that\nyou are aware of that it would be contrary to? I know\nthere are cases that say you look to states but you only\nlook to states where the state law is, in fact,\nconsistent with the Federal right.\nMR. FLAXMAN: No, I think the Court could\nsay without overruling anything that there, in this the\nstate law does not fully reflect or protect the Federal\nrights at stake here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So then you deny the\nofficers the purpose you have for the reason you have\nstatutes of limitation, which is repose. They are going\nto wait ten years instead of the two years to find out\nif they are going to have to answer any claim for\ndamages.\nMR. FLAXMAN: Well, but the officers will\nalso get the benefit of not being sued if there is a\nconviction based on the charge for which the person was\narrested. That case would not be brought, especially in\nthe Seventh Circuit where there is no cause of action --\nand it wouldn't be brought anywhere because there's no\ndamages if you are arrested and properly convicted and\nserving sentence. Those cases just are not going to\nexist; the officers would have that benefit.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the Seventh\nCircuit said in -- quickly in passing that the damages\nwould run only from the time of the allegedly unlawful\narrest until the time of arraignment. That would, that\nwould be the -- be all of your damages. If there wasn't\nan arraignment, whatever happens is not attributed to\nthe seizure.\nMR. FLAXMAN: That's the Seventh Circuit's\nview about what the cause of action is, which goes back\nto what is the cause of action and when does it accrue?\nIn the Seventh Circuit the cause of action starts when\nyou're arrested and -- either at the time of arraignment\nof, as they said in a subsequent case, when there's a\nGerstein probable cause hearing. In I think every other\ncircuit, the cause of action doesn't end at the time of\narraignment. It continues until the time that you're\nreleased from being in custody.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You asked us to take that\ncase and we didn't.\nMR. FLAXMAN: Well, I asked you to consider\ndamages but I think -- as a question of damages, and\nthere are many issues related to damages that would have\nbeen presented in question to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if that's the\nboundaries of the false arrest claim, then why does one\nhappen later matter?\nMR. FLAXMAN: Well, the common law false\narrest claim would allow damages up until the time you\nwere released from the imprisonment, which is not at the\ntime of --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Even on the basis of\ninnocence?\nMR. FLAXMAN: Not for a false arrest. As\nlong as you're not convicted. So malicious prosecution,\nyou would --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The common law would give\ndamages in a case like this in which the release was\nbasically governed by a suppression which has nothing to\ndo one way or the other with the innocence of that\nperson?\nMR. FLAXMAN: That's correct. The common\nlaw element -- malicious prosecution requires that the\ninnocence or grounds not consistent with guilt, but\nthere's no such element in the common law false\nimprisonment, which would accrue when you are released\nfrom being in prison, which would benefit Mr. Wallace in\nthis case. When the Seventh Circuit talked about there\nare three alternatives that we have to choose from, the\nproof immediately, the case by case of when it accrues,\nor it only accrues at the end of the case, they didn't\nconsider the fourth possibility of the common law rule\nthat it occurs when the imprisonment ends.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What does somebody like\nMr. Wallace do under your rule if he's in a jurisdiction\nwhere there's not a lot of discovery in criminal cases.\nHe isn't going to know until trial whether his cause of\naction accrued sometime earlier or whether it waited.\nMR. FLAXMAN: But he's not going to file his\ncivil rights claim until his criminal case is over,\nbecause he knows and his lawyer will tell him, that's\ngoing to hurt you in winning the criminal case, and you\nshould be concerned about that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But he's never going\nto know, in the case where there's no statute of\nlimitations, he's never going to know when his criminal\ncase is going to be over because he may never know when\nit's going to start.\nMR. FLAXMAN: Well, if Mr. Wallace had been\narrested and released, he would have had two years from\nwhen he was released to bring a civil rights action,\nthat being false imprisonment\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what happens if\nhe files a suit after one year and then after one year\nand 350 days he's prosecuted? His action accrued but\nthen it didn't accrue?\nMR. FLAXMAN: Well, I would suggest that it\nwould be the same as when someone is convicted of\nbattery, and then 10 years later, the victim of the\nbattery dies from the injury caused by the battery.\nThere would be a second prosecution for murder that\nwould not be barred from double jeopardy. I think\nthat's Diaz versus United States. I think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So his action\naccrued and maybe it's even over, but then it turns out\nwhen they bring the prosecution, it should have never\nhave been brought because it never accrued.\nMR. FLAXMAN: No, I think he would have two\nactions. He'd have the action for being arrested and\nthen he'd have the action later when the -- when he was\nseized because of the unlawful -- the fruits of the\nunlawful arrest.\nAs a practical matter, though, those cases\nare going to arise even less frequently than the Stone\nversus Powell cases that are brought properly in Federal\nhabeas corpus.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That problem is solved too\nif you simply say bring it, day one, you are arrested,\nand if in fact before the statute of limitations\nexpires, your client is brought to the court and is\ngoing to be prosecuted. Tolled. They don't need two\nactions.\nMR. FLAXMAN: A Federal tolling rule would\nsolve these problems.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I want to be sure I\nunderstood your position with regard to Justice\nKennedy's hypothetical where the defendant is arrested\nand excessive force is used by the police, they beat him\nup or something like that. When does that cause of\naction accrue?\nMR. FLAXMAN: At the time they beat him up,\nunless the beating up relates to an element of the\noffense.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Suppose that they had beat\nhim up two or three times. The first time it didn't\nrelate to it, but then they took him into the\ninterrogation room and they beat him up again. What\nabout that case?\nMR. FLAXMAN: If the beating up is -- if the\nbeating up is related to, used to extort a confession\nand the confession is used against him, then there would\nbe a cause of action when the confession is used.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So there would be two\ncauses of action?\nMR. FLAXMAN: Multiple causes, yes. There\ncould be at least two.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would he have to sue on the\nfirst one right away?\nMR. FLAXMAN: If you want to get damages for\nbeing beaten up, I would tell my client to sue right\naway. I would also tell my client if he's being charged\nwith a serious criminal crime offense, to wait until the\ncriminal case is over, because it will hurt you.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Flaxman, before you\nsave your time, I didn't understand why you're content\nwith Justice Breyer's tolling situation, bearing in mind\nthat the way he put it is, so long as the -- as the\ncriminal case is commenced within the two-year statute\nof limitations, how does that help you when the statute\nof limitations has passed? Then there's no tolling.\nMR. FLAXMAN: But criminal cases are not\ncommenced many, many years after the unlawful arrest, as\na practical matter.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And two years doesn't seem\nto be unheard of.\nMR. FLAXMAN: Well, if we're talking about\ncomplicated financial crimes, that's not unusual.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're willing to let those\npeople go?\nMR. FLAXMAN: If we're talking about the\nkinds of crimes that are involved with this kind of,\nwith street crime, with murder, armed robbery, rape, the\ndefendant is not allowed to let them run over two years.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Those are the only\ndefendants you are concerned about?\nMR. FLAXMAN: Those are the defendants who\nget unlawfully arrested and are forced to give\nconfessions.\nIf I may reserve my time?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Flaxman. Ms. Solomon.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BENNA RUTH SOLOMON\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMS. SOLOMON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nOur submission this morning rests on the\nproposition that the victim of an unreasonable search or\nseizure has the right to sue as soon as that Fourth\nAmendment violation occurs. For purposes of accrual of\nthat claim, it does not matter whether the victim is\nsubsequently prosecuted or whether he is subsequently\nconvicted. Accordingly, petitioner's Fourth Amendment\nclaim accrued for purposes of the two-year statute of\nlimitations as soon as his unlawful arrest and detention\noccurred, and his lawsuit filed some nine years later is\ntime barred. The claim accrued --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask, just to get it\nstraight at the beginning, what if the claim includes a\nFifth Amendment claim for extorting a conviction and\nit's mixed up with a Fourth Amendment claim? What about\nthat claim?\nMS. SOLOMON: I believe that the rule for\nthe Fifth Amendment claim, I believe the Court's view in\nChavez is that a coerced confession claim has as an\nelement of the claim, the use of that claim at trial.\nSo it would be our view if that is an element of the\nclaim, that that claim would not accrue until trial.\nA claim --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What about the beating of\nthe defendant?\nMS. SOLOMON: Exactly. A claim for\nconscience shocking techniques to obtain the confession\nor the excessive force to obtain the confession, both of\nthose claims, and use of the confession at trial is not\nan element of those claims, and those claims would\naccrue at the time of those acts, just like the Fourth\nAmendment rule that we urge in this case.\nOnly where there is a trial right and use of\nsome evidence at trial, suppression of evidence at\ntrial, something of that order, if the trial right is\nimplicated, that claim would not accrue until at trial.\nThat is different from the Fourth Amendment claim, of\ncourse, because --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Miss Solomon, do I gather\nfrom your response to Justice Stevens about the Fifth\nAmendment claim, that under Chavez it wouldn't accrue\nuntil it is used at trial, is this case therefore a\npleading slip on petitioner's part? That is, if he had\nalleged a Fifth Amendment claim based on the coerced\nconfession, then he wouldn't have a statute of\nlimitations problem?\nMS. SOLOMON: He brought two claims in his\ncriminal case. He lost them both in the Illinois\nCircuit Court at the time of his suppression motion. He\npursued only one of those on appeal to the Illinois\nAppellate Court, and the circuit court made findings\nthat the confession was voluntary. So at the outset,\nthere were problems with that claim going into Federal\ncourt.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's a puzzling feature\nof it, too, because I thought at the end the second time\naround, the Court of Appeals held that the confession\nwas no good.\nMS. SOLOMON: The Illinois Appellate Court\noverturned the conviction on the basis that it was\nobtained through use of a confession in violation of the\nFourth Amendment only. The only findings that have ever\nbeen made regarding Mr. Wallace's confession, the\nvoluntariness of the confession, were made in the\nIllinois Circuit Court, and the finding was that the\nconfession was voluntary, that it was not coerced. That\nfinding has never been reviewed. Petitioner did file\nboth Fourth and Fifth Amendment claims in this civil\ncase, but we did not assert statute of limitations to\nthe Fifth Amendment claim for precisely the reasons that\nI indicated to Justice Stevens.\nAnd for that reason, although the question\nwas presented in the petition, we did not acquiesce in\nthe Fifth Amendment portion of question 1 of the\npetition, and the court did not grant the Fifth\nAmendment claim. So I do not believe -- a short answer,\nsorry -- I do not believe it was a pleading error. It\nis simply that that claim as the litigation developed is\nnot before this Court now, but not through a simple\npleading error. It is a far more weighty problem than\nthat.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if the Fifth Amendment\nclaim were before us, do I understand you to have said\nbefore that the Fourth Amendment claim of false arrest\nwould also be subject to litigation as part of the Fifth\nAmendment claim or under the umbrella of the Fifth\nAmendment claim, so that the statute would not have run\non that?\nMS. SOLOMON: I'm sorry. If I indicated\nthat, I definitely misspoke. In our view, all Fourth\nAmendment claims except for those that do negate an\nelement of the offense, and those are described in\nfootnote 6 of Heck, with that exception, all Fourth\nAmendment claims should be regarded as accruing at the\ntime that the act that actually violates the Fourth\nAmendment occurs.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well then, my question is\ngoing to be along the same lines. Suppose -- I assume\nthis is a rather frequent case -- the confession is\nalleged to be the product of a beating. The two are\nmerged. If we have to wait for the Fifth Amendment\nclaim anyway, then as a matter of policy, matter of\nconvenience, why don't we wait for the Fourth Amendment\nas well?\nMS. SOLOMON: Because the rule of accrual is\nthat the act -- the claim accrues when the plaintiff\nexperiences an injury.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we're making up the\nrule of accrual, Ms. Solomon. I'm asking, if we have to\nwait for one, why not wait for the other?\nMS. SOLOMON: Well, with respect, Justice\nKennedy, I don't believe the Court is making up a rule\nof accrual. I think those rules are quite well settled.\nCases like Ricks and Chardon make clear, and the Fourth\nAmendment cases make clear that a Fourth Amendment\nviolation, unlike the Fifth, where evidence is used at\ntrial, the Fourth Amendment claim violation is fully\naccomplished at the time of the illegal search or\nseizure. Anything --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Who is the defendant in a\nFifth Amendment claim? Is it the policemen who\nextracted the confession or is it the prosecutor who\nintroduced it at trial, since that is the offense?\nMS. SOLOMON: Well, the prosecutor would be\nabsolutely immune, of course.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMS. SOLOMON: And some of those cases are\nbrought against the police officers. But, the reasons\nthat would suggest a certain accrual date for the Fifth\nAmendment claim are very different from the reasons that\ndictate the accrual of the Fourth Amendment claim at the\ntime -- the only action the petitioner alleges violated\nthe Fourth Amendment in this case was when his detention\nat the police station, which was consensual at the\noutset, became unconsensual, became involuntary at some\npoint before he confessed.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if he had also brought\na Fifth Amendment claim, your view as I take it would be\nas follows:\nNumber one, his Fourth Amendment claim, the\nrunning of the statute, the Fourth Amendment claim would\nbe unaffected by that, so that would have to have been\nbrought within the two-year period.\nMS. SOLOMON: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Number two, I'm assuming,\nand this is what I want you to tell me whether my\nassumption is right -- I am assuming that if a Fifth\nAmendment claim were brought by -- no, strike the\nassumption.\nYou, I take it, would -- let me ask a\ndifferent question. I take it you would agree that so\nlong as a criminal case was pending, that it would be\nsensible and maybe required for the court simply to\nabstain from any proceedings on the Fourth Amendment\nclaim.\nMS. SOLOMON: We do -- our position is that\nthey do occur when they happen and they must be filed\nwithin the limitations, yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you would agree that\nthe court, if there's a criminal case going on, I take\nit you would agree that the court should not proceed to\ntrial in the 1983 action.\nMS. SOLOMON: If there is a Fourth Amendment\nclaim being raised in the criminal case, and of course,\nit might not be, but that is a very easy --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But that's the problem. I\ndon't know if it is easy. It seems to me if you take\nyour point of view, now, on January 1, some, let's call\nit an unconstitutional action allegedly. So, I don't\nwant to distinguish for the moment between Fourth and\nFifth. On January 1 the event occurs.\nThen you say you have two years to file your\nclaim in the Federal court of a violation of 1983, for\nexample.\nThen that happens. Let's say two months\nlater they file it. The defendant files it. A month\nafter that, there is a state criminal proceeding. Now,\nyou're the Federal judge. What's supposed to happen?\nIt sounds to me as if the judge sitting there, under\nyour theory, is going to have to make a decision. He's\ngoing to have to say now, is the kind of claim that's\nbeing argued in my court that the policemen did\nsomething unconstitutional, if I say that's correct,\nthat the plaintiff wins, I have to go on to say does the\ncorrectness of that, there was a violation, mean that\nthe conviction if there is a conviction in the state\ncourt later, will necessarily be vitiated. If the\nanswer to that question is yes, he shouldn't go ahead;\nis that right?\nMS. SOLOMON: Justice Breyer, that is\ncorrect.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. If that's\ncorrect, we're getting to exactly the same problem,\nwhether we do it through a set of abstention rules,\nwhich we have to have Federal abstention rules or it\nwon't be worked out properly, or we have to have Federal\ntolling rules.\nI don't see any way to get to a sensible\nresult here without either having clear abstention\nrules, just as you say, having clear tolling rules, as I\nsuggested before. Am I right? If I'm wrong, let me\nknow why; and if I'm right, which do you prefer?\nMS. SOLOMON: I think those are essentially\nthe two choices, with one caveat. We would call it an\naccrual rule as opposed to a tolling rule, for the\nreason that this court has always respected the tolling\nrules that states have whereas accrual is a Federal\nquestion.\nBut with that slight caveat, I do believe\nthat those are the two main options. But I don't\nbelieve the Court should be indifferent as between them.\nThere are very serious practical reasons weighing down\non our rule, which is a rule of immediate accrual and\nfiling not immediately, of course -- the case need only\nbe filed within the period of the statute of\nlimitations.\nThereafter it might well be that some cases,\nmaybe many cases, maybe nearly all cases, would need a\nstay of some sort while the Federal -- excuse me --\nwhile the criminal case is ongoing.\nBut that question, figuring out whether a\nstay is warranted in order to avoid interference with a\nongoing state prosecution, is far easier to figure out\nthan whether the evidence is the only evidence, whether\nit's critical evidence, whether there was other\nevidence.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose -- correct me if\nI'm wrong -- when the district court wants to determine\nif he should hold something in abeyance, this is not\nnecessarily abstention; this is what courts always do\nwhen there are multiple actions. Other action pending\nis a general ground for a court to stay its hand.\nMS. SOLOMON: That's exactly right, Justice\nKennedy, and it's also --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose it would\nmake a difference to the officers, a principle of\nequitable tolling. They don't know if they're going to\nbe sued for 10 years, 12 years, however long. Under an\naccrual rule with a stay, they know whether they're\ngoing to be facing a civil action or not.\nMS. SOLOMON: That is the second major\nadvantage that we see to our rule, Chief Justice\nRoberts.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If you do it with a stay, I\nmean, I see that disadvantage. If you do it with a\nstay, the Federal judge is going to have to sit there\nwith the papers in front of him, look at that evidence,\nthink what's going to happen in the trial at the\ncriminal case which I'm not quite certain yet, and then\nmake a determination. It sounds like a very difficult\ndecision and it sounds like sometimes they'll get it\nwrong, sometimes they'll get it right. The defendant\nmight be arguing two different things, you know, one in\nthe state court to try to get them to go ahead, and the\nother to try to get them to go ahead in the Federal\ncourt.\nWhat do you --\nMS. SOLOMON: Accepting your earlier\nconstruct where there really are essentially two rules,\nwe either delay accrual or we --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If you delay accrual by\ntolling, you do have the disadvantage that in some\ninstances the policemen won't know for quite a while\nwhether the case is being brought. That's true; and in\nthe other instance, he won't know for quite a while how\nthe case is going to come out, which may be worse. But\nyou don't have any uncertainty. You have no\nuncertainty. You would know once the man is released.\nIt's no tolling. Once he's convicted, it's tolled.\nThen the conviction comes in. Not tolled until they\nbring a proceeding.\nMS. SOLOMON: The rule that we propose,\nwhich is immediate accrual coupled with a stay of some\nsort if the Fourth Amendment claim is being actively\nlitigated in the state court at that time, has two\nadvantages.\nThe first is that it does serve the purposes\nthat all statutes of limitations serve, which is it puts\nthe defendant on notice you are now the defendant in a\nlawsuit, you should be marshalling your evidence, you\nshould be preserving your records, and you are not in\nrepose.\nThis Court has respected those as very\nimportant interests. They are absolutely not served by\na rule of delayed accrual. At the same time, the rule\nto allow a stay where necessary - as I indicated, it's\nnot going to be all of the cases, and it's far easier to\nfigure it out. The Federal district court figures it\nout by having the defendant, the criminal defendant, who\nis a plaintiff in his court, come in and is asked a\nquestion: Are you currently --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They're not going to\nwaste a lot of time figuring out whether to grant a stay\nor not when you have a criminal prosecution pending in\nstate court. I think in most cases -- I mean, it's not\nlike they're looking for cases. They're going to say in\nmost cases: Stay granted, come back when this is over.\nThey don't have to be -- unlike perhaps the situation\nwith an equitable tolling rule, it doesn't matter\nwhether they're precisely right or wrong. I mean, if\nit's close enough just stay it, and it doesn't seem to\nme there's much prejudice from that.\nMS. SOLOMON: Well, that's correct, Your\nHonor, and we wouldn't have any objection to a rule\nthat --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't there this\npractical problem? I think what you say fits together\nbeautifully with regard to the law, but isn't it true\nthat this will give an incentive in every criminal case\nfor the defendant to file a 1983 action. So we may\nmultiply the number of Federal cases that are filed and\nthen sit there while a criminal case proceeds.\nMS. SOLOMON: I think the assumption, Your\nHonor, should be that the number of cases is going to be\nthe same either way. It's just a question of when are\nthey filed and, moreover --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, if your opponent's\nrule is adopted, they wouldn't file unless -- if they\nget convicted and the conviction stands up, the case\nwould never be filed.\nMS. SOLOMON: Well, it's curious that they\nmake that argument, because of course every victim of a\nFourth Amendment violation has the right to damages for\nat least the invasion of their privacy, for the\nantecedent conduct between the time of arrest and\ncharging. At a minimum, Mr. Wallace had that coming to\nhim because he was, according to the Illinois appellate\ncourt, illegally seized.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The thing I just want you\nto comment on is, my thought is every person arrested\nhas a potential, and something follows and so forth, has\na potential Fourth Amendment claim, even though he may\nnot have one on the merits. It just seems to me that\nthere's a potential here of an awful lot of what may\nturn out to be frivolous claims filed, but it would seem\nto be routine procedure for defense lawyers who want to\nmake a suppression motion to say, well, I better file my\n1983 case at the same time. So you might get literally\nhundreds and hundreds of cases.\nMS. SOLOMON: With respect, Your Honor,\nwe'll take that chance for the benefits that the statute\nof limitations does bring to the officer. And as far as\nthe burden on the court, whether all cases are stayed or\nsome cases are stayed, of course, we're content to have\nthis Court or the district court handling the case\nfigure that out.\nBut the main point that I would make is that\na rule of delayed accrual wholly undermines the purposes\nof the statute of limitations, and where the plaintiff's\ninterest, the claimant's interests, can be served, as I\nindicated, at a minimum every victim of a Fourth\nAmendment violation has the right to some damages. That\nis actually precisely why we say that Fourth Amendment\nclaims do not necessarily imply the invalidity of the\nconviction.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I had missed Mr. Flaxman's\npoint that this would an advantage to the prosecutor to\nsay, aren't you going to make a lot of money about this\ncase? My initial reaction as the defense counsel, I\nwould love that comment. I would tell the jury: Of\ncourse, it's our duty as counsel to point out that my\nclient was beaten, he was terrified, he was beaten\nagain, he had a false confession, and the damages we're\nnot interested in; we'll get much more damages if you\nconvict and we show this 15 years later because the\npolicemen lied as they always do. You know, you hear\nit.\nMS. SOLOMON: It may be not in a --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But he has tried more of\nthese cases than I have and he indicates this is a\nserious concern.\nMS. SOLOMON: He has tried way more of them\nthan I have as well, and I can't speak to that\nspecifically. It's not an argument that was ever made\nin the briefs. But again, I have no reason to believe\nthat the Federal district court can't take account of\nwhatever it needs to take account of in order to\navoid --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. This is the Cook\nCounty. This is the Cook County court.\nMS. SOLOMON: Yes. Yes, I understand. But\nall that has to happen, of course, is that the complaint\nbe put on file in the Federal court. It's notice\npleading. It can be a very, very long complaint.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, but he says the fact\nof the complaint the prosecutor's going to use in order\nto show that they're trying to profit from a false claim\nof a beating.\nMS. SOLOMON: Well, but as I indicated,\nevery victim of a Fourth Amendment rights, even those\nwho are guilty, even those who are convicted -- that's\nthe Herring case. Herring exactly shows --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, but the point is if\nthe complaint is filed then the prosecution can makes\nthat point.\nMS. SOLOMON: I would imagine that it would\ncut both ways in many cases, Your Honor. I'm sorry, I\ncan't speak to it more specifically than that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Does your position in\nthis case leave any reason at all for equitable tolling?\nMS. SOLOMON: It does, Your Honor,\nabsolutely. Equitable tolling is always available in an\nextraordinary case when the plaintiff could not put a\ncomplaint on file within the period of the statute of\nlimitations. And unlike the accrual question, as\nindicated a moment ago, the tolling is governed by the\nstates. In this case, for example, because Mr. Wallace\nwas only 15 years old at the time of the arrest, his\nclaim was tolled. He actually had nearly four years\nbeyond the two-year statute of limitations to put a\ncomplaint on file and it still would have been toll --\nwould have been timely. He filed outside even that\ntime.\nIllinois does not toll for prisoners, but\nmany states do, as the Court indicated in the Hardin\ncase. So there's all sorts of tolling available, or\ncould be under state law. Mr. Wallace has actually\nnever urged tolling in this case and I assume that\nthat's because there is no basis for that under state\nlaw. He did get the advantage already of the time when\nhe was a minor and there is no other basis under\nIllinois law that would allow him any basis for tolling.\nBut of course, tolling is proper when the\nplaintiff does not know and could not know that his\nrights were violated. If Mr. Wallace was illegally\nseized, he was right there when it happened. He might\nnot have known that a court would ultimately accept his\nargument on that, but of course the plaintiff never has\na right to be told that he has a successful claim before\nhe brings that claim.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any remedy that\nIllinois law provides for a case like this where a\nperson spends, what was it, eight years in prison and is\nultimately released because the state never had enough\nevidence to try him in the first place?\nMS. SOLOMON: In many cases, the state law\nof malicious prosecution will provide a remedy. Of\ncourse, in Illinois and in all states, it requires\nfavorable termination. In this case, of course,\npetitioner conceded long ago that he cannot show\nfavorable termination because the circumstances under\nwhich the criminal case ended did not -- were not\nconsistent with a favorable termination.\nBut, of course, he would have had a Fourth\nAmendment claim if he had filed it timely. He would\nhave had a state law malicious prosecution claim if he\nhad been able to show favorable termination. In states\nthat don't have malicious prosecution, perhaps there\nwould be a due process claim as well.\nThe result that there are no damages\navailable to somebody when the conviction is overturned\nsolely by operation of the exclusionary rule, however,\nshould not be troubling because the conviction itself,\nof course, was not an independent violation of the\nConstitution. Petitioner did receive the benefit of the\nexclusionary rule. His conviction was overturned.\nWe're not aware of any case indicating that deterrence\npurposes would require both the exclusion of evidence\nand a damages claim.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would it ever be proper\nfor a district court to insist on proceeding to the\nmerits of the claim, to dispose of the merits of the\nclaim, while the prosecution was pending? Suppose the\ndistrict court thought that it was seeing too many of\nthese claims and it wanted to get to the bottom of them?\nMS. SOLOMON: Well, in our experience the\ndistrict courts don't tend to want to go ahead. But I\nwould suppose that if the -- if the court did, rules of\ncomity are sufficient to allow the state courts to have\nthe first crack at issues that are arising in the\ncriminal cases, to be the ones that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: We haven't written about\nthat other than in Heck explicitly and implicitly, and\nin Younger? That's about it?\nMS. SOLOMON: In Heck and in Younger.\nThere's the concurrence in Deacons against Monahan\nindicates that a claim for damages should be stayed and\nnot dismissed or gone forward with. Justice White's\nconcurrence specifically addressed the difference\nbetween dismissing and going forward with the claim. Of\ncourse, the footnotes 8 and 9 in the Heck opinion are\nvery powerful indications of the weighty reasons. We\nhave no reason to think that the district court would\nwant to charge ahead with a claim that would -- with a\ncase that will only get simpler if it waits for the\nstate court proceedings to conclude, as well as of\ncourse the comity and respect for the state courts.\nIn this case, of course, as I mentioned,\nthe -- Mr. Wallace always had a claim available to him\nfor his initial seizure regardless of the outcome of his\ncriminal prosecution. If he wanted to seek damages for\nthat prosecution and our primary submission, part one of\nour brief is even assuming those damage might be\navailable on a Fourth Amendment claim, he was\nnevertheless obligated to bring that claim within the\nperiod of the statute of limitations, because otherwise\nit would be time barred.\nIn our view, petitioner does not have\none claim for that arrest and another claim for his\ntrial and prosecution. He has one claim for a Fourth\nAmendment violation with two elements of damages. But\nmounting future or delayed damages do not delay accrual.\nEven where the plaintiff does not know the full extent\nof his injuries, he still must sue within the period of\nthe statute of limitations.\nIn fact, petitioner does not cite a\nsingle case including the ones newly arrived in the\nreply brief that uses either his accrual rule or his\ndamages rule to award damages for the entire time of a\nlengthy period of incarceration. And as I indicated\npetitioner conceded long ago that he cannot show\nfavorable termination. And although he could have\nobtained some damages had he brought his claim timely,\nhis claim did accrue he was seized and not when the\ncharges --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you agree with Judge\nWood that the limitation on damages would be from the\nperiod, from the time of the arrest until the\narraignment? That would be the measure and nothing\nafter?\nMS. SOLOMON: A number of courts have\nreached that result, Your Honor. Footnote 25 recites\nfive court of appeals decisions to that effect. But our\nprimary submission in this Court is that regardless of\nthe damages that are available on a Fourth Amendment\nclaim, that the mounting of damages did not delay\naccrual, and without a timely claim, it doesn't matter\nwhat damages the plaintiff is seeking.\nThe reference in Heck to a claim for damages\nfor unconstitutional conviction, we take to be a\nshorthand for a claim of some sort of constitutional\nviolation that can be brought through the vehicle of\nSection 1983 that would enable the plaintiff to recover\ndamages for the incarceration. 1983 of course itself\ndoes not create any substantive rights. The plaintiff\nneeds an underlying claim and in this case of course the\nplaintiff only has the Fourth Amendment claim.\nWe do have, in our brief and argument why\nthe Fourth Amendment should not be regarded as allowing\nthose damages, but our primary submission and we do\nthink the Court can decide the case without -- without\nreaching that issue.\nThe only date to delay an accrual in this\ncase was the date that the charges were nol prossed.\nBut that date is meaningless for the Fourth Amendment\nand it is therefore meaningless for accrual. We would\nthe judgment be affirmed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMs. Solomon.\nMr. Flaxman, you have four minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH N. FLAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. FLAXMAN: The issue that has been\nsitting in this case like the elephant in the room is\nwhat is Mr. Wallace's cause of action? Is it a cause of\naction for being seized until he was arraigned? Or is\nit a cause of action for being seized for the eight and\na half years that he was locked up until he was, the\ncriminal case was resolved in his favor?\nMy sister argues that it was just, the\nFederal remedy is only until you're being arraigned, and\nthat the state remedy for malicious prosecution doesn't\nexist if the Seventh Circuit has construed Illinois law\nto say that there is no malicious prosecution when you\nwin the Federal case, when you win the criminal case,\nbecause the evidence has been suppressed. The false\nimprisonment, state false imprisonment was dismissed by\nthe district court, under his reading of Illinois law\nthat the cause of action accrued at the time of the\narrest. Not at the time he was released. And the\nSeventh Circuit when that issue was raised on appeal to\nthem in a brief by both sides chose to reject it without\ndiscussion.\nWhat, the cause of action that respondent\nproposes is none, for the eight and a half year seizure.\nThere is no state cause of action in Illinois. And\nthere is no Federal cause of action. It is just tough.\nYou are seized for eight and a half years, and you can't\ngo to state court, you can't go to Federal court. You\nshould have sued immediately after you were arrested to\nget a little bit of damages, but that's all you can get.\nAnd have a nice day; we're sorry.\nThat, I don't think is consistent with Heck.\nI don't think it is consistent with this Court's\njurisprudence about the meaning of Section 1983. I\ndon't think it is consistent with the Fourth Amendment\nand it should not be the rule that the Court adopts.\nThe statute of limitations problem isn't\nreally a problem because all of the evidence that's\nmaterial to the legality of the arrest, to the legality\nand the -- whether the confession was the proximate --\nwas proximately caused by the arrest or proximately\ncaused by the incarceration, has been developed in the\ncriminal case. When there's very strong interest in\nseeing that the facts are fully determined and fairly\ndetermined for both sides. It is not that the police\nofficer who sued eight -- eight and a half years later\nis much less is much less prejudiced than Mr. Wallace\nis, who comes out of prison after eight and a half years\nwith no remedy.\nThe questions about the multiple causes of\naction that can arise: if you're beaten, you have to\nsue immediately after you're beaten; if you're beaten\nbut a confession is extorted from you, your right to sue\nstarts with the confession is used against you at\ntrial -- and if there's some constitutional violation\nwhich necessarily impairs the conviction, then you can\nsue after you successfully defended a criminal case --\nis really an administrative nightmare that really could\nbe solved by a Federal tolling rule that all Section\n1983 cases are tolled; the statute does not start to run\nuntil the criminal case has been resolved.\nIn most cases, then, instead of being filed\nin district court --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That in effect is saying\nwe can't have a statute of limitations rule; we're just\ngoing to laches, we're just going to an equitable rule.\nMR. FLAXMAN: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: We're just throwing up our\nhands and saying there is statute of limitations statute\nof limitations.\nMR. FLAXMAN: No, there is a statute of\nlimitations. It starts to run when the criminal case is\nover. That will weed out all of the really nonsensical\ncases that would otherwise be filed under respondent's\nrule, when you file the 1983 action the same day you\nfile the motion to suppress and the district judge says\nwell, this goes on my state calendar of 5,000 cases and\nthe clerk's office is troubled with collecting the $350\nfiling fee in installments, and the jails are troubled\nby paying those installments every time there's $10 in\nthe prisoner's account. It's -- it would -- there are\nmore important things for the courts, the prisons to do.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\n"
