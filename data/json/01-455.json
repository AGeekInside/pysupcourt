        "content": "(11:01 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in No. 01-455, Franconia Associates v. the United\nStates, and the Grass Valley Terrace v. United States.\nMr. Eckland.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFF H. ECKLAND\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. ECKLAND: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis Court has held that statutes of limitations\ninvolve fundamental considerations of fairness.\nPetitioners submit that the cases before Your Honors this\nmorning involve precisely that.\nIn these two civil actions, petitioners seek\nfair compensation for continuing to be bound to the\nSection 515 housing program and continuing to house low-\nincome tenants for up to 50 years. Petitioners can\nsucceed in obtaining that fair compensation only if this\nCourt continues to apply the same ordinary principles of\nlaw to the United States Government that it applies to\nUnited States citizens.\nThe ordinary principles of law and their\ncontinuing application to the United States Government\nthat are at issue here are, first, that a breach of\ncontract claim does not accrue until the date of breach;\nthat is, until the time for performance by the defendant\narrives and the defendant fails to perform.\nQUESTION: Mr. Eckland, you -- you began by\nsaying you're seeking fair compensation for something.\nWhich is it? Are you seeking fair compensation for the\nGovernment's violation of the Constitution by impairing\nthe obligation of contracts, or are you simply seeking\nyour contractual rights? Are you seeking a contract\nclaim? Which -- what do we have before us?\nMR. ECKLAND: We are -- Justice Scalia, we are\nseeking compensation for the breach of contract.\nQUESTION: Okay. So, it's a -- it's a simple\ncontract case.\nMR. ECKLAND: Very much so, Your Honor. I mean,\nincluded in the compensation that the petitioners are\nseeking, it was not merely the lost income because of\ntheir lost right to opt out, but given the situation,\npetitioners are not receiving really sufficient income to\neven cover the costs of maintaining the housing for their\ncurrent tenants.\nQUESTION: Do you think you have a separate\ncause of action for the Government's violation of the\nConstitution, assuming that -- that you're correct that\nthat's what it's done?\nMR. ECKLAND: Under the takings claim, Justice\nScalia?\nQUESTION: Well, no, not the takings. But --\nbut impairing the obligation of contracts.\nMR. ECKLAND: Oh, quite so, Your Honor, yes. We\nbelieve that although it's for purposes --\nQUESTION: This is a -- this is a Federal\ncontract?\nMR. ECKLAND: It is with the Department of\nAgriculture, Your Honor, through the Farmers Home\nAdministration.\nQUESTION: So, the impairment clause doesn't\napply.\nMR. ECKLAND: Well, it -- it comes -- no. That\nonly applies to the States.\nQUESTION: My difficulty with your argument is\nthat if you have -- your whole property claim here rests\nupon the contract. And if you have a contract claim, then\nyour contract will be enforceable. If you don't have a\ncontract claim, then I'm not sure what the source of your\nproperty taking is on the -- on the unconstitutionality\nclaim.\nMR. ECKLAND: Well, petitioners pled, Justice\nSouter, the takings claim in the alternative to the breach\nof contract claim. And in fact, the lower courts have\nheld that there is no enforceable contract here.\nQUESTION: Well, if -- if they are correct, then\nI don't see how you've got a taking because your -- your\nwhole property interest -- the only property interest\nyou're asserting is an interest under that contract. And\nif you haven't got the -- if you have no breach of\ncontract, then I don't see what's being taken from you.\nMR. ECKLAND: What's being taken, Justice\nSouter, is the expected use of the petitioners'\nproperties. What happened is they volunteered to a\ncertain period of time --\nQUESTION: If you don't have a contract for it,\nyou have no right to expect it.\nMR. ECKLAND: But there were representations by\nthe Government that created a reasonable investment-backed\nexpectation on the part of --\nQUESTION: Why did the lower courts find that\nthere was no contract claim? Because of the statute.\nMR. ECKLAND: Because of the -- one judge, in\nparticular, because of the unmistakability doctrine.\nQUESTION: Because of the --\nMR. ECKLAND: In other words, the contract was\nnot clear enough to constitute an enforceable contract\nwith the Government.\nQUESTION: I thought the Federal Circuit went on\nthe statute of limitations. Isn't that what you're\nopposing, that the statute of limitations didn't expire?\nMR. ECKLAND: Yes, Your Honor. The lower court\nopinions were denying our motion for summary judgment, so\nwe've not been able to get to trial on the existence of\nthe contract. Assuming for the purposes of our case that\nthere is a contract, the Federal Circuit did affirm the\ndismissal on the basis of the statute of limitations.\nQUESTION: Yes. The question you presented is\nwhether a breach of contract claim accrues for purposes of\nsection -- when Congress enacts a statute alleged to\nabridge a contractual right to freedom from regulatory\ncovenants upon prepayment of Government mortgage loans.\nBasically the -- the court held that your -- the statute\nof limitations barred your contract claim, didn't it?\nMR. ECKLAND: That is true, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And that's the case we have here.\nMR. ECKLAND: Well, in -- yes. Yes, it is,\nJudge, a statute of limitations case.\nIn our case, the petitioners alleged that their\nclaims accrued when they tried to prepay and when the\nFarmers Home Administration failed to accept their\nprepayment requests and refused to release them from the\nregulatory covenants imposed by the Section 515 program.\nPetitioners all commenced suit within 6 years of that\ndate, and therefore they maintain here that their claims\nare timely.\nNow, the Government maintains that the\npetitioners' claims accrued not on the date dictated by\nthe ordinary principles of law, breach of contract and\ntakings, but rather automatically in the enactment of the\n1988 legislation. But if you look at -- closely at the\n1988 legislation, it's clear that it has no immediate\nimpact whatsoever on the owners. All of its commands,\ndirectives, requirements, and authorizations are directed\nsolely at the agency.\nQUESTION: Didn't the Federal Circuit rely on\nanticipatory breach?\nMR. ECKLAND: No, Your Honor. They maintained\nthat the actual passage of the -- of the statute\nconstituted an automatic breach. They did not rely on the\nanticipatory breach.\nQUESTION: You were relying on anticipatory\nbreach, as I understand it.\nMR. ECKLAND: We do not either, Your Honor,\nalthough the petitioners here have the option of suing --\nassuming -- suing before the breach, assuming that they\nhad the ability to perform at that time -- and there's\nnothing in the record --\nQUESTION: You rely on the notion that before\nthey went to pay it off, it was an anticipatory breach.\nMR. ECKLAND: No, Judge. We are relying on the\nactual breach. All petitioners --\nQUESTION: I'm sorry. Then I'm confused. I\nthought that your argument was that the reason the statute\nof limitations doesn't arise, doesn't start to run prior\nto the time that they paid it off, is because prior to\nthat time, there was no actual breach. There was only an\nanticipatory breach.\nMR. ECKLAND: Correct, yes.\nQUESTION: All right. That's what I thought\nJustice Ginsburg was asking.\nMR. ECKLAND: Yes.\nQUESTION: Now, but you take the position that\nyour clients could have filed suit soon after the passage\nof ELIHPA.\nMR. ECKLAND: Justice O'Connor, not necessarily.\nUnder the doctrine of anticipatory repudiation, they did\nhave a option to sue before. But as we pointed out in\nfootnote --\nQUESTION: Well, that's what I'm asking you.\nYou take the position -- let's be clear about your --\nplease -- that after the enactment of the statute, your\nclients could have filed suit for breach of contract on an\nanticipatory breach theory?\nMR. ECKLAND: Yes, but only if they had the\nability to prepay at that time. One of the requirements\nof -- of the contract is that the petitioners had the\nrequisite funds to prepay before submitting a prepayment\nrequest.\nQUESTION: Well, no, no, no, no, no.\nMR. ECKLAND: That is --\nQUESTION: You -- you don't -- you don't -- no.\nYou have to -- you say for anticipatory breach you have to\nshow that you're ready to --\nMR. ECKLAND: Ready, willing, and able, Judge.\nQUESTION: -- to perform when -- when the\nobligation to perform comes. You -- you don't have to\nshow that you're ready for immediate performance.\nMR. ECKLAND: You do have to show that you're --\nbut for the repudiation, you do have to show that you are\nable to perform.\nQUESTION: But performance here -- what you're\ntalking about here in performance means the ability to\nprepay. And I take it your argument is we couldn't have\nprepaid because we didn't have the money, and therefore we\ncouldn't have proved damages. Is -- is that it?\nMR. ECKLAND: Essentially so, Your Honor. We\ndon't rely on --\nQUESTION: I have a contract to deliver 100,000\nwidgets 3 years from now. The party who -- the party who\nis committed to buy those widgets announces I am not going\nto buy those widgets, and you say there is no anticipatory\nbreach unless I have on hand the 100,000 widgets, which I\nhave no obligation to deliver until 3 years from now.\nThat's -- that's how you envision the -- the law of\nanticipatory breach? I'm sure that's wrong.\nMR. ECKLAND: Well, no. Well, footnote 23. We\naddress this in our reply brief, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: The whole purpose of anticipatory\nbreach -- most people use it not to get damages but to\nrelieve themselves of the obligation of -- of remaining in\n-- in the status of being able to perform the contract.\nThe person who would sue in the case that I gave you would\nbe suing so that he wouldn't have to go and acquire the\n100,000 -- the 100,000 widgets. It's never the case that\nhe's ready -- or almost never the case that he's ready\nhere and now to perform.\nMR. ECKLAND: But, Your Honor, if the person who\nhad the obligation to accept the delivery did not have the\nfunds, for example, even to purchase them, then that would\nbe sort of almost a fraudulent --\nQUESTION: He didn't need the funds until 3\nyears from now. He has no obligation to purchase until 3\nyears from now.\nQUESTION: Could we agree to this?\nCould we agree to this, that so far as the element of an\nanticipatory breach claim involves the act of the\nGovernment, you had that element, and at least to that\nextent, you could have brought an anticipatory breach\nclaim when the statute was passed? Maybe you didn't have\nother elements. That's what we're arguing about, but you\nhad the -- you had the -- the Government's fault element.\nIs that correct? Do you agree?\nMR. ECKLAND: Well, certainly, Justice Souter,\nthe --\nQUESTION: But you're saying, whether I could\nhave sued then or not, I certainly can sue at the point at\nwhich I would claim my right to redeem without these\nvarious conditions, and they refused to honor it. You're\nsaying, even if I could have sued when the statute was\npassed, I can also under contract principles sue when the\nmoment comes that I want to exercise my right to prepay.\nMR. ECKLAND: Correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. ECKLAND: And -- and the doctrine does not\nrequire you to sue until that date. It's merely an option\nto sue prior to that date.\nQUESTION: So, you're arguing for total control\nthen over timing because your client could say, we're not\nready after 5 years, we're not ready after 7 years, we're\nnot ready after 10 years. So, the statute would -- would\nnever run. In other words, you're asking for any time\nfrom the earliest, which is when the law is passed, until,\nsay, 20 years later.\nMR. ECKLAND: Yes, Your Honor, we are.\nQUESTION: So, you could --\nMR. ECKLAND: Because the Government negotiated\noption terms up to 50 years.\nQUESTION: That was the deal.\nMR. ECKLAND: That was the deal.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. ECKLAND: And the owners relied on that when\nthey signed up, and they had, you know, a clear\nexpectation that at some point in time they would be able\nto prepay, opt out, and convert their markets --\nQUESTION: May -- may I interrupt you?\nMR. ECKLAND: -- to market rate -- yes.\nQUESTION: Did they have a right to assume right\nafter the -- the day after the statute was passed, did\nthey continue to have a right to prepay --\nMR. ECKLAND: The right --\nQUESTION: -- without any objection?\nMR. ECKLAND: Well, the right still existed,\nYour Honor, but it wasn't -- it was repudiated at the time\nof the statute.\nQUESTION: Well, it wasn't just -- it's not like\na private citizen saying, I don't intend to perform 3\nyears from now. You have a law passed that takes away a\ncertain contract right. Was there a breach when the law\nwas passed?\nMR. ECKLAND: Well, Your Honor, petitioners\nmaintain that the right was not eliminated. It was, if\nyou will, conditioned --\nQUESTION: Do you maintain there was no breach\nat the time the law was passed?\nMR. ECKLAND: That's correct, Your Honor.\nThat's merely repudiation. The breach did not occur\nunless and until the prepayment request was submitted and\ndenied.\nQUESTION: But you would concede that the\nstatute changed your rights.\nMR. ECKLAND: The statute did condition them,\nand that conditioning, or fettering as the Government\nsays, is a repudiation, but like any other situation in\nthe private sector, when you repudiate a right, the breach\ndoesn't occur until the time for performance comes due.\nQUESTION: The repudiation --\nQUESTION: Well, that's because a private party\nhas the right to change his mind.\nMR. ECKLAND: Correct. Right, the defendant\ncould change their mind or the petitioner here could, in\nfact, be able to --\nQUESTION: Doesn't the Government have the right\nto change its mind? Couldn't the Government pass another\nstatute going back to what the situation was before this\none?\nMR. ECKLAND: Yes, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: In fact, it did that at one point,\ndidn't it?\nMR. ECKLAND: They could and they did.\nQUESTION: They did at one point, didn't they?\nMR. ECKLAND: In 1979 they initially conditioned\nthe right, and in 1980 they repealed it, retracted it.\nNow, under the Government's proposed rule, if -- if the\nstatute of limitations began to run immediately upon the\nenactment of the statute, all of the petitioners here\nwould have been compelled to file their suit within 6\nyears of 1979, i.e., by 1985.\nQUESTION: So, we're arguing about whether a\nstatute itself, without any action from the agency, can be\na repudiation.\nMR. ECKLAND: We believe it can be a\nrepudiation, yes, Mr. Chief Justice. But the breach does\nnot ripen, if you will, unless and until the prepayment\nrequest is denied.\nQUESTION: Does the repudiation give you the\nright to the same damages that you would receive for a\ntotal breach of the contract?\nMR. ECKLAND: In our case, no. The petitioners\nmaintain that since the housing is within a restricted\nprogram, it really has no market value unless and until a\npetitioner actually attempts to prepay. But even\nassuming, Your Honor, that there was some type of damage\ncaused by the enactment of the statute, still the\nlimitations period would not commence to run until the\ntime for performance came and was not rendered.\nQUESTION: I think it's usually the case, is it\nnot, that when there's an anticipatory repudiation, it's\n-- it's very difficult for the -- the other party to\ndetermine what his damages are going to be.\nMR. ECKLAND: Very difficult.\nQUESTION: Which is why he uses the doctrine to\nget out of the contract rather than to seek damages. In\nthe widget case I gave you, who knows? Who knows what 3\nyears from now the price of widgets will be? So -- so you\nuse it to get out of the contract.\nMR. ECKLAND: Petitioners here, being in the\nCourt of Federal Claims, have as their only remedy the\nmonetary judgment. And -- and they are seeking damages\nstarting only as of the date that their prepayment request\nwas denied by the agency. So --\nQUESTION: So are you -- you're saying that\nthere was a claim, or you're saying that -- that your\nclaim really doesn't accrue until you -- until you have\nthe -- the wherewithal to prepay. So, you don't really\nhave a ripe claim until then?\nMR. ECKLAND: We're saying the petitioners would\nat least have to have the money to prepay. They would\nhave to have the ability to perform. You couldn't have a\nsituation, for example, where someone was unable to\nprepay, they experienced repudiation and a breach, a later\nbreach, and then say, well, we would have performed if you\nhadn't repudiated.\nQUESTION: Well --\nMR. ECKLAND: They have to have the honest\nintent to perform and have the ability to perform.\nQUESTION: I have a problem with that.\nMR. ECKLAND: Yes.\nQUESTION: But let's get -- if we can get -- for\nthe same reason Justice Scalia mentioned. But let's\nassume you had cash in the bank that would allow you to\nprepay, and then there's a repudiation.\nMR. ECKLAND: Sure.\nQUESTION: At that point, can't you show your\ndamages? You don't want to prepay, but can't you say --\nhave an expert in and say, this property has a certain\nvalue and part of the value is the right at any time to\nprepay the -- the loan and use it for another use? And\nthis can be valued in the real estate market. It's worth\nmore if I can prepay than if -- if I can't, and you have\nsome expert come in and tell you the difference in the\nvalues. And you do that at the moment the repudiation\noccurs.\nMR. ECKLAND: But here, Justice Kennedy, a 50-\nyear option exists. Petitioners don't know, frankly --\nthey didn't know in 1979 and many didn't know in 1988 what\nthe value of their properties would be, given interest\nrate structures and other market conditions at any given\npoint in time --\nQUESTION: Well, you mean 50-year options are\nnot subject to valuation? Experts do this all the time.\nMR. ECKLAND: Well, but even so, even if you\ncould come up with a damage theory to cover this, still\nit's clear that under the law, the breach would not be\ndeemed to accrue for limitations purposes until the time\nfor performance has arrived and performance failed.\nI mean, if you take a hypo of the GSA leasing\nsome space in a building --\nQUESTION: You're -- you're just getting me\nconfused again. I thought we established that you thought\na suit could have been filed for anticipatory breach of\nsome kind after the statute was enacted.\nMR. ECKLAND: If they're able to perform, yes,\nYour Honor.\nQUESTION: And now you're saying no. It's just\nvery confusing. I don't know what in the world you're\narguing.\nMR. ECKLAND: Justice O'Connor, no. If the\npetitioners had the ability to pay, they could have\nbrought an anticipatory breach claim --\nQUESTION: Only if they had the ability to pay,\nyou say.\nMR. ECKLAND: According to Corbin and the case\nlaw that we cite at footnote 23 of our brief, yes. But if\nwe get beyond that, okay --\nQUESTION: Footnote 23 just says that ordinary\ncontract law applies to this kind of case. We still --\nbut we still -- we still have to figure out what ordinary\ncontract law is. Footnote 23 doesn't shed any light on\nthat that I saw.\nMR. ECKLAND: But in this case --\nQUESTION: And -- and I might add that on page\n27 of the blue brief, you say that the law constituted an\nanticipatory repudiation and petitioners had the option of\nsuing immediately.\nMR. ECKLAND: In general, yes, that's true, Your\nHonor. But here the petitioners sued within 6 years of\nthe actual breach.\nQUESTION: And in fact, you did not sue until\nafter the passage of 6 years.\nMR. ECKLAND: From the statute, yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: From the enactment of the statute.\nMR. ECKLAND: But -- but all petitioners\ncommenced suit within 6 years of the date of the actual\nbreach, which is the date that the prepayment requests\nwere denied.\nQUESTION: So, what apparently the Government's\narguing -- does it matter if we call this anticipatory\nrepudiation or anticipatory breach? I guess\ntechnically --\nMR. ECKLAND: Technically --\nQUESTION: -- we should say anticipatory\nrepudiation?\nMR. ECKLAND: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Fine. And so, what they say, in\npart, which I'd like to hear your response, is if you're\nright that where there is anticipatory repudiation of a\ncontract, the other side, if it's a private contract, has\na choice. They can either sue immediately if conditions\nX, Y, and Z are fulfilled, or they wait until the contract\nis actually breached. But we are the Government and we\nhave to interpret this statute strictly, and therefore we\ninterpret it to mean that even if where you're dealing\nwith a private person, you'd have your choice; here\nthere's no choice.\nNow, your response is what?\nMR. ECKLAND: Well, here, Your Honor, although,\nyes, we need to construe the statute strictly, we cannot\ndo so in such a manner, however, to narrow the waiver of\nsovereign immunity that has already occurred under the\nTucker Act. As this Court held in Irwin and in Bowen\nagainst New York, the tolling -- equitable tolling\nprinciples at issue in those cases, which applied to the\nprivate sector, were nonetheless deemed to apply to the\nGovernment, despite the strict construction of the statute\nof limitations involved in those cases. Here there is --\nalthough there's a conditioning of the right at the point\nof the repudiation, no breach occurs until the performance\ncomes due and is not rendered.\nIf -- again, if you look at the statute, under\nELIHPA, page 74 of our appendix 4a, all of its directives\nare towards the Secretary. For example, the Secretary\nshall make reasonable efforts to enter into an agreement\nwith the borrower to extend the term of the -- of the\ncontract. It's the Secretary that needs to make those\nreasonable efforts. There's no directive directly to the\nowner that the owner participate in that process.\nQUESTION: If -- if that's the -- I mean, I\nreally do think that your takings claim, which is the\nreason you're going into this thing -- well, it was just a\nconditioning of the right; it wasn't an elimination of the\nright; it just reduced it -- you do all of that to -- to\nsupport your takings claim. But -- but it just -- it\nconfuses your -- your primary claim, which is the contract\nclaim. I don't see why there -- if it's only a\nconditional reduction and if it's only a direction to the\nagency, I don't see why there was an anticipatory breach\nthen. It seems to me that what you need for a taking, you\nneed for an anticipatory breach. I don't see how you can\nsay it was enough for an anticipatory breach, but it\nwasn't enough for a taking.\nMR. ECKLAND: You are correct, Your Honor. It\ndoes not have to be repudiation. We maintain that that's\nthe most that it can be. If it's not a repudiation, the\nbreach here then occurs on the adverse agency action, and\nall petitioners maintain --\nQUESTION: And that's why you were confusing\nJustice O'Connor, because you're not really ready to say\nthere was an anticipatory breach, because in order to\nsustain your takings claim, you don't really want to say\nthere was an anticipatory breach because they didn't\nreally, absolutely break the contract. They just gave a\ndirection to the agency and it didn't entirely eliminate\nthe right, it just conditioned it.\nMR. ECKLAND: Justice Scalia --\nQUESTION: You're carrying water on both\nshoulders, it seems to me, and you're spilling a lot.\nMR. ECKLAND: Well, Your -- Your Honor, no. At\nthe point of the denial of the prepayment request, there\nis a definite breach and that's where the damages occur.\nBut the takings --\nQUESTION: And you say in every breach there's\nalso a taking?\nMR. ECKLAND: Oh, no, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: I don't understand that. Why weren't\nyou satisfied with a breach of contract claim?\nMR. ECKLAND: Well --\nQUESTION: What -- what are you adding with this\nso-called takings claim?\nMR. ECKLAND: Well, in the event that the lower\ncourts do not rule in the petitioners' favor on the\ncontract claim, they have their wholly independent takings\nclaim, which is based not -- it's not predicated on the\nexistence of a contract. It's simply the unilateral\n^Fextension by the Government of restrictions on the use\nof the petitioners' property. They -- they --\nQUESTION: The property being buildings?\nMR. ECKLAND: The buildings and their land.\nBefore they entered into the program voluntarily, they had\nthe full use of their buildings and land. And they\nvoluntarily --\nQUESTION: Suppose you win on the first claim.\nSuppose you win on the contract claim. Then do you want\nus to go and answer the other question which, as far as I\ncan see, is going to take me into outer space?\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: But -- and I'd worry about what I'd\nwrite on that. What's your view on that?\nMR. ECKLAND: Well, there are differences\nbetween the claims, Your Honor. There are potential\ndifferences --\nQUESTION: I know there are differences. I\nasked you a specific question. If you win on the contract\nclaim, do you want us, nonetheless, to go on and answer\nthe second question? It's either yes or no.\nMR. ECKLAND: Petitioners do, Your Honor, yes,\nbecause damages are different. In fact, the dates could\nbe different. The taking could take place, for example,\nat the end of the for sale procedure that's involved in --\nin the prepayment process, which would be 6 months, at\nleast, after the denial of the prepayment request.\nQUESTION: May I --\nQUESTION: You've gotten the full benefit of\nyour contract, which is what would happen if you win on\nyour contract's claim. What possible taking could there\nhave been?\nMR. ECKLAND: If -- in practical terms, Justice\nScalia, if we do prevail on the contract claim at trial, I\ndon't see that we would pursue the takings.\nQUESTION: That's fine, except what you're\nasking us to do then is to write a little essay on a\nmatter that affects millions of other people in a very\nserious way, in a case which doesn't seem completely to\npresent the issue. If that's what you want us to do, and\nI guess you have a right to do it.\nMR. ECKLAND: On behalf of the petitioners, I\nmean, we would not abandon --\nQUESTION: Well, we have a right to dismiss it\ntoo, I suppose.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ECKLAND: Yes, you do.\nQUESTION: May I ask, because I have to confess,\nI get -- am getting a little confused, too? Just tell me\nprecisely -- forget the contract claim for a minute. All\nwe've got before us is the takings claim. What is it that\nwas taken and when?\nMR. ECKLAND: Prior to the time that the owners\nentered into this program, they owned their land. Many\nowned the buildings.\nQUESTION: I understand, and then they --\nMR. ECKLAND: Then they voluntarily agreed to\nthese restrictions on the use, only a certain level of\nrent, only a certain income of tenants. The\nrepresentations by the Government, even though they may\nnot have arisen to a contract, nonetheless stated that --\nor gave the owners the expectation that at some point in\ntime they could prepay and opt out of the program.\nQUESTION: Well, would you tell me what you\nthink was taken? Is it the right to prepay that was\ntaken?\nMR. ECKLAND: If there is no contract right,\nthen no, that was not taken, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: What -- what --\nMR. ECKLAND: What was taken is their -- is --\nis the permitted use of the property under their\nreasonable investment-backed expectation. It's clearly --\nit's -- it's a regulatory taking where the properties\nexperience a diminution in value because they can no\nlonger be used once the owner decides to -- to leave the\nprogram in the manner in which they had been used prior to\ntheir voluntary entry into the program.\nQUESTION: It's a regulatory taking of the right\nto make use of the property the way you wanted. Which\noccurred when?\nMR. ECKLAND: Which occurred prior to the time\nthat they voluntarily agreed to participate in the\nprogram.\nQUESTION: You mean before -- even before they\nsigned the contract?\nMR. ECKLAND: Well, at or about the same time.\nI mean, if it's a contract, yes, but we -- you know, it\nwas pled in the alternative. So far, the courts have held\nthere are no contracts. So, what we have is just a\nwritten representation --\nQUESTION: I've been trying to ask the question\nthat's --\nMR. ECKLAND: Yes.\nQUESTION: Assume you never made a contract\nclaim. What -- I'm trying to find out what your taking\nclaim would be, and I frankly don't understand.\nMR. ECKLAND: It's just their inability to go\nback to using their property the way they were because of\nthe passage of ELIHPA and the regulations that compelled\nthem to continue charging only a certain level of rent.\nThey could not raise their rent.\nQUESTION: Now, can we go back a little? Did\nyour clients borrow some money from the Federal Government\nat low interest rates?\nMR. ECKLAND: Yes. Well --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. ECKLAND: The construction loan, Your Honor,\nin many cases was initially from a private mortgage\nlender. Then that would be taken out upon the entry into\nthe contract by the Farmers Home Administration. And that\nwas a low interest rate loan effectively --\nQUESTION: To develop the property.\nMR. ECKLAND: Yes, Your Honor. Yes. And that\nwas a low interest loan, but it devolved to the benefit of\nthe tenants in the form of low rents. It didn't go into\nthe pockets of the owners. They were able to charge\nlow --\nQUESTION: Well, to get the loan, the borrower,\nyour clients, had to execute a loan agreement and a\npromissory note --\nMR. ECKLAND: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- and enter into a mortgage.\nMR. ECKLAND: Yes.\nQUESTION: And was the right of prepayment\nspelled out in any of those agreements?\nMR. ECKLAND: The prepayment right itself was in\nthe promissory note, yes, Your Honor.\nMr. Chief Justice, I see that most of my time is\nspent. If I may reserve the rest for rebuttal.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Eckland.\nMr. Roberts, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. ROBERTS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nPetitioners' claims are barred because they\nweren't filed within 6 years of when they first accrued,\non the enactment of ELIHPA. Petitioners allege that their\ncontracts gave them the option to prepay their mortgages\nat any time subject to only those legal restrictions in\nplace when the contracts were made. They're, thus,\nalleging that the Government promised not to impose\nadditional legal restrictions on their option to prepay\nand ELIHPA itself breached any such promise because ELIHPA\nitself imposed additional legal restrictions on\nprepayment. Petitioners' contracts claims accrued at the\ntime of that present breach.\nQUESTION: Well, was -- do you -- do you concede\nor should we take this case on the assumption that there\nwas a contract? Do -- do we --\nMR. ROBERTS: We're -- for --\nQUESTION: -- do we assume it for purposes of\ndeciding this case?\nMR. ROBERTS: For the purposes of deciding the\nstatute of limitations question, yes.\nQUESTION: And that the contract included a\nright of prepayment.\nMR. ROBERTS: Included a right of prepayment and\nnot only a right of prepayment, because if the contract\njust said you can prepay at any time, it like all\ncontracts would be presumed to be subject to subsequent\nlegislation. So, the -- that right to prepayment had to\nalso include a promise that the Government wouldn't change\nthe rules and impose additional legal restrictions on --\nQUESTION: When I have my contract to pay a\nmillion dollars when my ship -- when the ships with grain\ncome in, I say, a year in advance, ha-ha, I'll never pay.\nI'll never pay. And therefore, I then have breached the\ncontract to carry out what I promised.\nMR. ROBERTS: No. In that circumstance, it\nwould be anticipatory repudiation. But -- but here you\nhave legislation, not a statement by a private party.\nQUESTION: So -- so what?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, two things. One,\nlegislation itself alters the legal rights, and two --\nQUESTION: Well, the Government -- the\nGovernment cannot -- cannot break a contract then.\nMR. ROBERTS: No. The Government --\nQUESTION: The Government can always act by\nlegislation, can't it?\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes. Yes, Your Honor, and the\nGovernment --\nQUESTION: So, the Government --\nMR. ROBERTS: -- can breach the contract and --\nand be responsible for damages. And we're not arguing\nthat -- that they can't.\nQUESTION: So long as it does it by legislation,\nit's okay.\nMR. ROBERTS: No. No, no, Your Honor. The\nGovernment --\nQUESTION: I thought that was your point, that\nthis -- this breach is different because it was done by\nlegislation.\nMR. ROBERTS: That doesn't mean -- that -- that\ndoesn't mean that it's not a breach, but what it means is\nthat the breach is occurring at the time the legislation\nis passed.\nQUESTION: So, fine. The legislation says, ha-\nha, we won't pay. You know, I just want the legislation\nto say precisely what the private person said. Now, you\nsay we reach a different result because it's in the form\nof legislation?\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes.\nQUESTION: Okay. Now, one thing -- I'm just\ncurious to get into that a little bit -- is, I don't\nunderstand why the Government is taking the position it\ndoes, as well as what the position is. That is to say,\nwouldn't you, if you win -- and this will help me\nunderstand it -- have millions of people who have entered\ninto contracts with the Government poring over every law\nthat is passed, and probably every regulation, to decide\nwhether or not that law and that regulation will somehow\n10 or 15 years from now impact on a real estate contract\nthey have with the Government? A whole industry of\nanticipatory breach, not really, lawyers will develop in\norder to bring those claims immediately in the Court of\nClaims because we might lose them later even though\neverything would have been worked out.\nNow, if you can explain that to me, I suspect\nI'll have a better time understanding your argument.\nMR. ROBERTS: Okay. What -- what we're -- what\nwe're asking for is that people who believe that their\ncontractual rights have been injured -- have been\ninfringed by a statute give the Government reasonably\nprompt notice, in accordance with the statute of\nlimitations, of their claims. And the benefit of the\nability to have a prompt accounting outweighs, in the\nGovernment's view, any additional lawsuits that may\nresult.\nAnd we don't think that there will be a\nsignificant number of additional lawsuits because, as the\nCourt was explaining before, there's an ability to sue\nimmediately on the anticipatory repudiation theory. So,\nit isn't that the petitioners -- or that the Government is\nnot going to be subject to suit or --\nQUESTION: But what would the damages be when I\nhaven't got the wherewithal to pay?\nMR. ROBERTS: The -- the damages are that\npetitioners had a loan that they allege gave them an\nunfettered option to prepay at any time. And after ELIHPA\nwas passed, that loan no longer had that unfettered option\nto prepay. And a loan that has an -- has an absolute\nprepayment option is worth more than a loan with a\nseverely restricted prepayment option. The difference in\nthe value of the loan is reflected in the difference of\nthe value of the property that's encumbered by the loan,\nand it's -- it's easy to measure by comparing the --\nQUESTION: Easy to measure? You -- you'd bet\nyour life on that? I mean, the -- the reason -- the\nreason contract law has developed the option of suing for\nanticipatory breach as just an option is precisely because\nit is often so difficult to anticipate what your damages\nwill be. And so, it leaves it up to the innocent party\nwho hasn't broken the contract to either sue immediately,\nif he can calculate his damages and get them, or to wait\nuntil the -- the time for performance comes.\nAnd what the Government is doing with this\ntheory is forcing everybody who has a contract with the\nGovernment to come in with -- with speculative damages and\nhoping that some court will find a difference between the\nvalue of this contract now and what it would be 50 years\nfrom now. I -- I think it's a -- I don't know why you\nwould want to impose this kind of a regime upon\ncontractors with the Government.\nMR. ROBERTS: The damages, first of all, can be\nmeasured, as I said. Second of all, the -- the\nGovernment, as reflected in the statute of limitations,\nhas a -- has a prompt -- has an interest in prompt\nresolution of the claims.\nQUESTION: Well, I'm not --\nQUESTION: I mean, anything can be measured. I\nmean, you know, my life expectancy can be measured, but I\nwouldn't bet a whole lot of money on it.\nMR. ROBERTS: That -- that's right --\nQUESTION: You know, you -- you can come up with\na guess for -- for anything. But -- but the reason we\ngive the option to the innocent party is precisely because\nit's a guess. It may be, you know, an educated guess, but\nit's a guess.\nMR. ROBERTS: With -- with due respect, Your\nHonor, I -- I don't think that's the reason why the law\ngives the -- the option to the innocent party. The law\ngives the option to the innocent party so that the -- the\nparty has the ability -- the opportunity to convince the\ndefendant to retract its wrongful repudiation.\nQUESTION: But if -- if it is an option, why\nshould the innocent party be penalized by having the\nstatute of limitations start to run then?\nMR. ROBERTS: It's not an option here because\nthe statute is a present breach. And -- and to understand\nthat --\nQUESTION: Well, are you --\nMR. ROBERTS: -- it's important to understand\nthe nature of the promise that's -- that's at issue here,\nI think, and if -- if I could try to go back to -- to do\nthat.\nQUESTION: Yes. I was going to ask -- I -- I\nthink it's consistent with the Chief Justice's inquiry.\nAre you saying that there's only one cause of action here,\nor do you concede that there are two causes of action, one\nfor repudiation or anticipatory breach and the other for\nthe actual breach?\nMR. ROBERTS: Our position is that there is an\nactual breach at the time that the statute is passed, and\nit's a breach of -- of the promise that the Government\nmade that it wouldn't impose additional legal restrictions\non prepayment.\nQUESTION: Even though --\nMR. ROBERTS: It's different from --\nQUESTION: Even though performance is not yet\ndue.\nMR. ROBERTS: Performance on that promise is\ndue, Your Honor. Performance on that promise is -- is due\nthroughout the life of the loan.\nQUESTION: No. But you can make that argument\nwith respect to any contract that is ever made. You're\nsaying there is always an implicit term that they won't\nmonkey around with the terms of the contract, and whenever\nin anticipation they do so, there's an immediate breach.\nAnd if you follow that analysis, then in fact the\ndistinction between repudiation and anticipatory breach on\nthe one hand and actual breach on the other will disappear\nin every contract, public or private.\nMR. ROBERTS: No, Your Honor, because -- because\nthe -- the difference is between legislation and the --\nand the role that legislation has under background\nprinciples of contract law and other actions.\nQUESTION: The background principle of contract\nlaw is that we try to treat the Government and a private\ncontracting party together.\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes.\nQUESTION: And you're saying the fact that the\nGovernment can speak through legislation, whereas a\nprivate party cannot, alters that rule. If so, then that\nrule is going to have a remarkably short life because the\nGovernment can do anything it wants to across the street\nand displace the rule.\nMR. ROBERTS: The -- the distinction, Your\nHonor, is that -- is -- is twofold. The legislation\nchanges the legal rights and so there isn't an ability\nanymore to perform.\nQUESTION: Why does it change the legal rights\nif the contract exists? It may -- it may convert one\nright into a -- a right to damages as opposed to a right\nto performance, but the theory of contract is that by\nrepudiation you can't just change the legal rights.\nMR. ROBERTS: It does -- it does exactly that.\nThat's what I mean by changing the legal rights, that it\nchanges -- there's no longer a -- a right to performance.\nThere's only a right to the damages. If it was a contract\n--\nQUESTION: All right. If that is so, then\nexactly the same thing is true in a private contract when\nthere has been an anticipatory breach.\nMR. ROBERTS: No. No, Your Honor, there might\nbe a right to specific performance if it was the kind of\ncontract that you could specific performance, but we would\nsubmit that you couldn't get specific performance once the\nGovernment --\nQUESTION: How does the fact that you cannot --\nMR. ROBERTS: -- precluded the performance by\nlaw. You could only get damages.\nQUESTION: Let's assume you're right. How does\nthe fact that you may not get specific performance against\nthe Government affect the right to damages, which you\nperfectly can get against the Government, as -- as against\nany other private contract?\nMR. ROBERTS: The -- what it does is show that\nthere's -- that there's a change and an -- an injury right\nat the time that the legislation is passed.\nQUESTION: Then that gets back to the original\npoint. If that's so, then the same argument is going to\napply in every contract, public or private.\nMR. ROBERTS: It -- it's not going to apply in a\nprivate context because there isn't going to be a breach\nby virtue of -- of legislation unless there's a promise by\nthe private party that --\nQUESTION: You -- you have invented --\nMR. ROBERTS: -- that the laws aren't going to\nchange.\nQUESTION: I understand. You have invented a\npromise that I won't change the laws. You can invent in\n-- in private contracts an implicit promise that I will\nnot repudiate, and therefore, when you repudiate\nanticipatorily, you have broken the contract and, bingo,\nthere is a breach of contract and you must sue at once.\nMR. ROBERTS: You -- you have --\nQUESTION: You no longer have the option.\nMR. ROBERTS: You have --\nQUESTION: You could do it. I mean, it's just\n-- you know.\nMR. ROBERTS: You have no need to invent that.\nYou have no need to -- to have that additional promise in\nthe private contract because -- because there isn't the\npresumption. There -- there isn't the presumption in that\ncircumstance that the contract is subject to legislation\neven though the Government is -- has the ability to\nlegislate.\nQUESTION: I see your point.\nQUESTION: Well, what is -- what is your\nauthority for the proposition that the -- an -- an\nanticipatory breach not accepted by the other party starts\nthe statute of limitations running? I mean, what case?\nMR. ROBERTS: My -- my argument is not that this\nis an anticipatory breach. The -- our -- our principal\nsubmission is that this is a present breach, but -- but\nit's a present breach of a promise that the Government --\nQUESTION: What --\nMR. ROBERTS: -- that has to be there in a\ncontract with the Government because of the\nGovernment's --\nQUESTION: What if we disagree with you that\nit's a present breach? Do you still say that an\nanticipatory breach starts the statute running?\nMR. ROBERTS: That -- that's not our principal\nsubmission. We -- but you could read the statute -- you\ncould read the statute that providing first accrues to\nmean that the first -- that when a plaintiff can first\nbring suit, that that's when the statute of limitations\nstarts to run --\nQUESTION: Even though that's not the law as\nbetween private parties.\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes, given the principles of\nsovereign immunity and the principle that the statute\nshould be narrowly construed. But -- but --\nQUESTION: But that -- that narrow construction\nnotion, or construed strictly notion, applies to deciding\nwhether there's a waiver by the Government of any\nprivilege of sovereign immunity. And once we've decided\nyes, the Government did waive it, the Government has said\nit can be sued, we don't continue to look at every issue\nand say, oh, it's the Government, we're going to strictly\nconstrue it somehow.\nMR. ROBERTS: The Court -- the Court has held\nseveral times that statutes of limitations, as conditions\non the Government's waiver of its sovereign immunity,\nshould themselves be -- be narrowly construed and has\napplied it in -- in cases, for instance, involving a\nsituation where a private party claimed that the\nlimitations period didn't run until an administration --\nadministrative determination had been made that there\nwouldn't be -- that there was a -- was a loss and --\nQUESTION: Well, in this sense -- in this sense,\nthe Government actually needs less protection than the\nprivate party because the Government at least is in the\nposition where it can always pass a statute of\nlimitations --\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes, the Government --\nQUESTION: -- which -- and if you're -- you're\nconcerned about your liability 50 years out or something,\nI suppose you could pass a statute of limitations.\nMR. ROBERTS: The Government can do that and has\ndone it here, and the statute of limitations provides that\nwhen the action first accrues, there are 6 years to sue.\nAnd if -- if --\nQUESTION: Well, but again, I'm back to the\nproblem. It -- it seems to me that on contract law there\nare two causes of action, anticipatory repudiation,\nanticipatory breach, and breach. And you're conflating\nthe two.\nMR. ROBERTS: In the -- in the ordinary\nsituation, if a private party -- let's -- if -- if I may,\nlet's -- can I pose a hypothetical? If -- if a -- if a\nprivate party had promised that you could prepay, that the\nother party could prepay at any time, and Congress passed\na statute that imposed restrictions on prepayment, that\nstatute would be neither an anticipatory repudiation or a\nbreach, but would provide a discharge.\nAnd -- but if the private party had promised,\nsubsidiary to the promise that it would be prepaid at any\ntime, that there -- that notwithstanding passage of\nlegislation, that if -- if there was legislation passed\nthat -- that -- excuse me -- that the private party had\npromised that legislation wouldn't be passed or had\npromised to indemnify, notwithstanding the passage of\nlegislation, then there would be a breach at the time the\nlegislation is passed.\nAnd the Government has to make that promise, and\npetitioners have alleged that the Government made that\npromise here. That's what -- that's what they lost on the\nsummary judgment motion in the -- in the lower court about\non the merits --\nQUESTION: I see that. I think I understand\nyour argument. It doesn't work with the private party.\nYour analogy isn't so great because it's not the private\nparty who can pass the law.\nBut I think your argument is that unlike private\ncontracts, many, many, many Government contracts have the\nfollowing problem in them which was in Mobil. Are the\nparties here saying that if Congress passes a law, that\nthat -- all bets are off? Are they saying the Government\npromises to do this, Congress's law to the contrary in the\nfuture notwithstanding? What's the promise?\nAnd here you're saying the promise was in their\nview we will do this irrespective of Congress's new law\nand their -- your view is, no, it was conditioned on\nCongress not passing a law. Is that right? Or maybe I\nhave it backwards. But you're -- you're saying that in\nGovernment contracts, there is a promise and there is an\nissue whether the Government means that promise\nirrespective of what Congress does in the future.\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes. That --\nQUESTION: That's an issue.\nMR. ROBERTS: That's an issue, and then there's\na separate --\nQUESTION: And therefore, they're saying what\nthe Government meant was irrespective of what Congress\ndoes, and you're saying no, it meant only if Congress\ndoesn't do to the contrary.\nMR. ROBERTS: On -- on the merits -- on the\nmerits, yes. But -- but --\nQUESTION: On the merits. And you're saying\nthat kind of a contract issue is breached when Congress\npasses the law to the contrary.\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes.\nQUESTION: Okay. And that's special for\nGovernment.\nAnd now all I would like on that is: A, does\nthat apply to administrative regulations too; and B,\nwhat's the authority for that?\nMR. ROBERTS: Okay. It would apply to\nadministrative regulations if -- if that was the -- the\nissue whether the promise -- if -- if the issue was there\nwouldn't be regulations -- different regulations that\nimposed restrictions on prepayment. It would apply to\nthat and it would be breached at the time the regulations\nwere promulgated. They have the effect of law.\nThe authority for that is the -- is the\nbackground principle that's -- that's recognized in the\nWinstar case, that's recognized in Bowen v. Posse, that's\nrecognized in --\nQUESTION: All right. But if it's just a\nbackground principle, I would worry about the practical\nconsequence being of people, particularly in real estate\ncontracts, having to study every regulation, every statute\nin order to tell their clients what to do. Real estate\ninvestors are nervous people sometimes. And -- and they\nwould say, my God, I better bring a lawsuit and the lawyer\nwould say, don't worry about it. This condition is never\ngoing to arise anyway. Who cares? And if it does, sue\nthen.\nNow, that -- that's the practical thing I brought up\nat the beginning, and if we're trying to say what's the\nright legal principle, I think that practical problem is\nrelevant.\nMR. ROBERTS: Okay. And then to return to the\n-- to practical considerations that -- that we think argue\nin our favor on that side, that's because the Government\nhas a prompt interest in -- has a -- has a strong interest\nin a prompt accounting of the costs of legislative action.\nAnd it's particularly important that -- it's -- it's\nimportant that, one, that -- that a Congress close to the\nCongress that enacts a statute be able to address the\nconsequences of the enactment. And it's also important\nthat Congress --\nQUESTION: Which it could enact by repealing --\nMR. ROBERTS: -- be able to cause a --\nQUESTION: It could enact -- the -- the Congress\nthat's close to the first one could say, okay, we'll\nrepeal it. And that's, Mr. Roberts, one of the major\nproblems I have with your argument. You seem to say that\nlegislation is magic, and you can't have an anticipatory\nrepudiation because when Congress has spoken, that's it.\nBut in this very case, Congress goes back and forth a\ncouple of times.\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes. Congress can repeal the\nlegislation, but it doesn't change the fact that during\nthe -- the period the legislation was in effect that\nthere's an alteration of legal rights, and there's also,\nif there was a promise that -- that the -- that the rights\nwouldn't be changed, a breach during that time.\nAnd although Congress did -- although Congress\ndid repeal the statute here, it -- it's far less likely in\nthe ordinary situation that Congress is going to repeal\nstatutes than it is that a private party is going to\nchange its mind about its intention to repudiate a -- a\ncontract, and --\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. -- Mr. Roberts, in the case\nin which the Government, we'll assume, doesn't change its\nmind, your argument in -- in response to Justice Breyer's\nquestion seems to boil down to something like this. Pity\nthe poor Government as the contract breaker because it may\nnot know just how much damage it's causing. Therefore,\nput a burden on the people harmed by the Government's\nbreach of contract to run in in a hurry and let the\nGovernment know early on just how much damage it has\ncaused.\nWhy should the burden of the Government's breach\nof contract be shifted entirely for limitations purposes\nto the victims of the breach?\nMR. ROBERTS: When -- when there's a present --\nwhen there's a breach, the general principle is the\nstatute of limitations starts to run at the time of the\nbreach. It doesn't wait to run until --\nQUESTION: No, but your -- no, but your\nargument, as I understand it, is that because of the\nGovernment's peculiar power to pass legislation, the\nGovernment should not be in the position of the usual\ncontract breaker who may be subject to an anticipatory\nbreach claim or an actual breach claim later. You're\nsaying the Government should be subject only to one claim\nat the first moment that an anticipatory breach claim\nshould be brought. And your argument for saying that is\nthe Government ought to have a right to make its victims\ncome in and tell it as early as possible how much damage\nit has caused. Why does the Government, simply because it\nhas a legislative power, have that kind of a moral claim\nthat the private contract breaker does not have?\nMR. ROBERTS: There's this -- there's a -- a\nvery strong interest in permitting the Government to -- in\npermitting Congress to decide it wants to wrap up the\ncosts of improvident Federal contracts that they have --\nQUESTION: Then why don't we let Congress -- why\ndon't we let Congress survey through the departments of\nthe Government how many contracts it has entered into or\nguaranteed and tote up the damages in advance? The\nGovernment has access to this information if it wants to\nget it.\nMR. ROBERTS: The -- the Government doesn't know\nwho's going to sue, for one. And so -- so it -- what this\nrule does is --\nQUESTION: In other words, the Government may\nget off a little cheaper if it puts the burden on the\nvictims.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well -- well, it -- there's a\ndispute here as to whether the contract made this promise\nor not, and the Government doesn't -- doesn't know how\nthat dispute is going to be resolved. We don't believe\nthat -- that there was a promise that prepayment would not\nbe subject to subsequent legislation.\nQUESTION: Well, certainly general contract law\nis not -- you know, you could say it from the point of\nview of general contract law, it's important that people\nwho breach contracts know as soon as possible how much\ndamage they've done, but obviously that doctrine has not\ncommended itself in the area of general contract law.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, when they breach a contract\nand it's a breach, the statute of limits does start to run\nand the rule is that even if the damages can't be fully\nascertained, that -- that the statute of limitations run.\nAnd that's true with -- if -- if there was a contract\nbetween one party to -- to employ another party for the\nother party's life and that contract was breached, the\nstatute of limitations would run at the date of breach\neven though it wouldn't be possible with certainty to know\nthe length of the damages. A -- a contract for a breach\nof warranty of merchantability --\nQUESTION: I think it's so hard to look at this\nas an actual breach if we take it on the assumption there\nwas a contractual right of prepayment on demand by the\nborrower. I would think normally you would wait and see\nif and when there was a request for repayment -- or early\npayment, and you wouldn't really know that, of course,\nwith a -- the owner of real estate who goes out and he\ngets a low interest loan from the Government to develop\nit. Now, if interest rates decline below that low rate in\nthe future within the 20-year period, then he might well\nwant to go have early payment so he can get an even better\ndeal. But if interest rates are going higher, there's no\nincentive for him to. I wouldn't think you'd treat it as\nan immediate breach because the Congress attached new\nconditions to the circumstances of the prepayment.\nMR. ROBERTS: Even under the scenario you posed\nthat -- that there wasn't an incentive to prepay right at\nthe moment, there's still a -- a change in what -- in --\nin the loan that petitioners have, and it's a loan where\nthey no longer have that option to prepay with unfettered\n--\nQUESTION: No. As I read the legislation, there\nstill is consideration of the possibility of prepayment,\nbut there are some new conditions imposed whereby the\nGovernment tries to assure itself that there will still be\na certain number of low-income housing units out there on\nthe market.\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes, Your Honor, but petitioners\nhere aren't complaining about the fact that they're\nultimately not able to prepay. They're really complaining\nabout the -- about the restriction in the circumstances\nunder which they prepaid, and -- and that's revealed by\ntheir complaint where not all -- even -- petitioners have\n-- have submitted requests for prepayment. And some of\nthem have accepted incentives with -- and withdrawn their\nrequests. So, if they were complaining about not being\nable to prepay, they would have gone through the whole\nELIHPA process to see whether they -- they could prepay.\nQUESTION: Well, apparently at some point there\nwas a request to prepay. Right?\nMR. ROBERTS: Some petitioners have made\nrequests to prepay. Not all petitioners have made\nrequests to prepay.\nQUESTION: The -- but -- but petitioners -- some\nof the petitioners in this case.\nMR. ROBERTS: Some have but not all petitioners.\nQUESTION: Have made a request to prepay and\nit's been refused. Now, at that point, presumably, we can\nsee a breach.\nMR. ROBERTS: At that point, there's an\nexacerbation in our view of the -- of the previous breach\nbecause it's an application of the restrictions that were\nimposed and that were imposed, according to petitioners'\nallegations, in violation of the Government's promise not\nto impose them. But --\nQUESTION: Could you seek declaratory relief to\ndetermine your liability?\nMR. ROBERTS: At the time of the --\nQUESTION: The legislation is passed. You're\nconcerned that it might cause some monetary liability some\nyears hence. You seek declaratory relief that this is not\na breach of the contract.\nMR. ROBERTS: I suppose that the Government\ncould -- could do that. I'm not -- I -- you know, I don't\nknow for sure, but I don't know any reason why -- why --\nQUESTION: Let's see if this is a quick analogy,\nand you may not know the answer. I promise you in a\ncontract to give you an option to lease my beach house\nevery year for the next 15 years, and I also promise not\nto make a contract disabling myself from carrying that\nout. I enter into a contract with him that does disable\nmyself from carrying that out. Is that an immediate\nbreach or is it anticipatory?\nMR. ROBERTS: An immediate breach, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: It is immediate?\nMR. ROBERTS: It's an immediate breach. Do I\nhave something that -- that says --\nQUESTION: Yes. I mean, that's pretty\nanalogous.\nMR. ROBERTS: No.\nQUESTION: That's pretty analogous to the\ncase --\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes. I don't --\nQUESTION: -- that you were bringing up.\nMR. ROBERTS: I don't think that -- that the\ncase -- I don't have a case one way or the other on that\nproposition.\nQUESTION: I think you'll find it's an\nanticipatory breach.\nMR. ROBERTS: But -- but ordinarily --\nQUESTION: If that is an anticipatory breach --\nMR. ROBERTS: If you didn't make any -- any\nother promise at all, it would be an anticipatory breach.\nI agree with you. But you wouldn't have need to make that\nother promise because the -- because it would be presumed\nthat you wouldn't take action that would -- you wouldn't\nbe excused by taking action that makes it impossible for\nyou to perform. But -- but that presumption doesn't apply\nin the case of the Government and legislation because of\nthe --\nQUESTION: And your whole case hinges on that,\nthat the Government --\nMR. ROBERTS: Well --\nQUESTION: -- is really different because of\nthis. Now, if I believed that the Government -- and I'm\nnot -- I'm not saying I do -- that the Government was\nreally different for that reason, then this is a unique\nkind of case and maybe we should have a different rule as\nto when you have to sue. I mean, if it's unique for that\npurpose, maybe it ought to be unique as to whether these\npeople who don't know what their damages are at this point\nhave to sue right away or it can wait until -- until they\n-- they submit their request for prepayment.\nIf it's unique, we'll adopt a unique rule for\nit. Would that make you happy?\nMR. ROBERTS: All -- all I can say to that, Your\nHonor, is that -- that there are many situations in which\ndamages cannot be ascertained fully. In fact, there are\nsituations in which courts have confronted situations\nwhere the damages can't -- no measurable damages could be\nfound at all at the time of breach, and they hold that it\n-- it runs from the breach.\nAnd the -- the policy arguments on our side are\nthe -- the Government's interest in a prompt accounting,\nin being able to wrap things up and in not having --\nQUESTION: Well, but the Government has --\nMR. ROBERTS: -- to wait for 50 years to know --\nQUESTION: But the Government should want to\nhave some rules out there that would encourage it to be\nable to deal with people on a commercial basis in some\nareas. You might want to be able to buy certain things\nfrom the private sector or to engage in loan agreements.\nAnd to adopt the kind of proposal you're making\ndiscourages anyone from dealing with the Government. It's\na very peculiar rule.\nMR. ROBERTS: I -- I don't think it discourages\nthem, Your Honor, because they -- they can sue and their\ndamages are measurable, and they can get the damages. The\nlikelihood that interest rates are going to go up or that\ninterest rates are going to go down and -- and other\npossibilities are -- are reflected in the -- in the change\nin the value of the loans and they're measurable at that\ntime.\nAnd -- and if petitioners think they might be\nable to prepay later, subject to the restrictions, so they\nwouldn't be injured in that way, they can sue, get their\ndamages and then they'll be subject to the restrictions in\nthe program.\nAnd if they prepay and -- and the restrictions\ndon't prevent them in any way from prepaying or don't\nimpose any limitations on them, then they've gotten the\ndamages for what they've lost and they also get the\nability to prepay.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Roberts.\nMr. Eckland, you have 2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFF H. ECKLAND\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. ECKLAND: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. May\nit please the Court:\nThe Government has not been able to cite to one\ncase in which a congressional statute has been treated\ndifferently, in other words, that it constitutes an\nimmediate breach of a contract.\nIn the petitioners' briefs, we have a total of\nsix cases that make the distinction between a\ncongressional statute as being merely a repudiation and\nthe breach not occurring until there has been some adverse\nagency action. In the Court of Federal Claims, we've got\nPlaintiffs in Winstar-Related cases, Bank of America, and\nConoco. The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, Far West,\nSchism, and Stone Forrest. And two of those cases,\nPlaintiffs in Winstar-Related cases and Bank of America,\ndealt with the statute of limitations and have ruled in\nfavor of the petitioners' position advocated here.\nCongress makes policy. It directs agencies what\nto do, and petitioners maintain that in that sense it is\nno real different than a board of directors of a\ncorporation. A board of directors can direct the CEO or a\nprogram manager not to perform a contract, but that\ndirective or that change in bylaw by a board of directors\ndoes not constitute a breach. It's merely a repudiatory\nact. The -- the breach does not ripen unless and until\nthe program manager or CEO actually fails to perform at\nthe time that performance comes due.\nHere it's clear that since the petitioners can\nreach their central right of opting out of this program\nupon prepayment -- and the statistics show that -- it\ncan't be that the statute is an immediate breach. A\nbreach occurs only if and when the agency acts and denies\na prepayment request.\nIn closing, Your Honors, petitioners here\nunderstand that as U.S. citizens they have an obligation\nto follow the law and to know the law. But here the\nGovernment enticed the petitioners into this program by\nholding out a 50-year option term, only to withdraw it\nupon the time that the petitioners built the properties.\nIf the Government is not willing to give the\npetitioners the benefit of their bargain, fundamental\nconsiderations of fairness at least require that they get\nthe benefit of the doubt and that these ordinary\nprinciples of law regarding the accrual of breach of\ncontract and takings claims should be able to be invoked\nby the petitioners such that they do not need to file suit\nunless and until their claims accrue.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nEckland.\n"
