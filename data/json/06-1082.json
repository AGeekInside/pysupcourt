        "content": "(10:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst today in 06-1082, Virginia v. Moore.\nMr. McCullough.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. McCULLOUGH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. McCULLOUGH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThis Court has again and again held that an\narrest is constitutionally reasonable if the officers\nhave probable cause to believe a suspect has committed a\ncrime. The Court has found that this standard\nrepresents the best compromise between the needs of the\ncitizens and the duty of the government to combat crime.\nWhile the States are free to build additional procedures\non this constitutional bedrock, when they do so these\nadditional procedures are matters of State law. They do\nnot change the constitutional standard.\nThe Court below erred in substituting this\nclear, established, uniform, time-tested standard for a\nstandard that has none of those virtues.\nFirst, it is undeniable that if State law\ncan raise the constitutional bar, that it will lead to\nwidespread differences on the exact same facts, on the\nexact same crime, not only across State lines, but also\nwithin a particular jurisdiction.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. McCullough --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If this officer had\ncomplied with the State law, that is he had issued a\nsummons, then you agree that the exclusionary rule would\napply if he went ahead and searched.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: That's correct. If he had\nissued a summons, Knowles would apply and the evidence\nwould be excluded.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So would you explain the\nlogic to saying that when the police violate State law,\nthen the evidence can come in; but when they comply with\nState law, it can't.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: Your Honor, the rationale\nof Knowles was that the officer did not engage in any\nextended contact with the suspect and that there was no\nneed to gather evidence.\nBut where from a constitutional sense there\nis a full-fledged arrest, then the particular rationale\nof Knowles doesn't apply; and I don't think the -- we're\nasking the Court to embrace violations of State law;\nwe're asking the Court to recognize that when a State\ngoes above and beyond what the Constitution requires,\nthat the remedies for those violations should be left to\nthe States.\nAnd Virginia has provided a number of those\nremedies; but here the officer did make a full custodial\narrest.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Did you -- excuse me,\nsorry, General.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, you say he made a\ncustodial arrest. Did he search the defendant at the\ntime of the arrest?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: No. There was a\nmiscommunication between the officers --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And did he search him at\nthe place of the arrest?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: No.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, how can this be\nincident to an arrest?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: Your Honor, the fact of the\narrest was uncontested, and the law doesn't require --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the search is\nunrelated to the arrest, as I understand the facts.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It took place later in a\ndifferent place.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: Justice Stevens, the search\nwas related to the arrest. What happened at the scene\nwas the officer made a pat-down and assumed the other\nofficer had conducted the search. When they got to the\nhotel, they realized there had been a mix-up. But he\nhad not yet been taken to the station and booked and so\nthe rationale supporting the search incident to the\narrest is present.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, why is it present if\nhe's not -- he searched when he wasn't arrested? I\ndon't understand. Could they wait a week and do it?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: The arrest did not cease at\nthat point, Your Honor. In United States v. Edwards,\nthe Court recognized that at times the search will not\nproceed immediately upon arrest.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It's an ongoing arrest, is\nit?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: Well, it's an arrest --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Incident to an ongoing\narrest? That's kind of a new concept.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: It's an arrest until he is\nreleased or denied bail. But I would also add that the\ntiming issue was simply not raised below. And so\nthere's no reason at this juncture to raise an issue\nthat the litigants chose not to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. McCullough, the\nproposition that you're arguing, does it apply at the\nFederal level as well? Suppose -- suppose I think that\nmy neighbor next door is growing marijuana and I have\nprobable cause to believe that, all right?\nSo I go in and search his house; and sure\nenough, there is marijuana. And I bring it to the\npolice's attention, and they eventually arrest him.\nIs that lawful search?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: If there is State action --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm a State actor, I guess.\nYou know --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. McCULLOUGH: If you have State actors --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You know, a Supreme Court\nJustice should not be --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- should not be living\nnext door to somebody growing marijuana. It doesn't\nseem right.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: That's not a smart\nneighbor.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. McCULLOUGH: If you have State action\nand you enter into someone's home, then the Constitution\naffords a heightened level of protection. But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Don't dance around. Is it\n-- is it rendered an unreasonable search by the fact\nthat I'm not a law enforcement officer at all?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: I don't think the fact\nof -- no. The fact that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So any Federal employee can\ngo crashing around conducting searches and seizures?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: So long --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So long as he has probable\ncause?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's fantastic.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you really think that?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: I think if there is State\naction, it doesn't matter that you're wearing a badge or\nthat you've gone through the police academy.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or that you are an\nadministrative law judge at the, you know, Bureau of\nCustoms? It doesn't matter?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: I think that's right. That\nif you have -- if the State --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about a janitor?\nYou're a janitor, a federally employed janitor.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: His neighbor is growing\nmarijuana, and he's just as offended as a Supreme Court\nJustice would be. Can he conduct a search?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: I think if he's doing it on\nbehalf of the State, the answer is yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wow.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: But in terms of the\nFederal-State distinction, Your Honor, I think what\nwe're advocating for is the uniform standard that this\nCourt has embraced before, that there should not be a\ndifference between a Federal officer on a State facility\nwho is authorized under the Assimilated Crimes Act to\narrest for Virginia laws and a Virginia officer who is a\nhundred feet away with making an unconstitutional arrest\nunder the holding below when --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you agree that\nthere was no probable cause to arrest, given the State\nstatute?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You're talking about\nprobable cause to believe that he committed an offense.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: That's right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But was there probable\ncause to arrest?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: Well, the State court found\nthere was no -- none of the exceptions in the statute\napplied. But when the Court has used the term \"probable\ncause to arrest,\" it has never required a two-step\nanalysis of, first, probable cause to believe a crime\nhad been committed, and then probable cause to arrest.\nIt's always been, in this Court's cases, a single\ninquiry: Has there been probable cause?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Could he -- could this\nofficer have gotten a warrant to arrest Moore? Could he\n-- is it -- oh, there's an offense going on under\nVirginia law, I'm going to check with -- call in to see\nif I can get a warrant. Could he have gotten a warrant?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: Well, under the facts of\nthis case he could have, but it would have caused a\nprolonged detention of the suspect.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How could he -- how could\nhe have gotten a warrant to arrest when it's\na nonarrestable offense?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: Well --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: He couldn't -- would a\njudge have told this police officer -- they have a\ncall-in procedure, call the judge. You want to -- you\nneed to issue a warrant to arrest him for driving with a\nsuspended license, but that's not an arrestable offense.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: Your Honor, it is an\narrestable offense under certain circumstances. And so\nthe officer is left with each arrest to make a\ndiscretionary call.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did these officers think\nthis -- those circumstances exist?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: The officers did not --\ntheir only testimony was it was their prerogative. And\nunfortunately they did not then unpack that explanation\nto say why they thought one of the exceptions applied.\nWhat the State argued below and the State\ncourt rejected was that he was alone in a car with this\nlarge angry dog. There was no passenger that he could\nswitch places with, and so if they write him a summons,\nlogically, what is he going to do? He doesn't live\nanywhere nearby. As soon as they leave the scene, he's\ngoing to get right back in his car and drive away.\nNow the State court rejected that, but that\nillustrates the fact that under this statute the\nofficers have to make discretionary calls as to when\nthese exceptions apply. Is the defendant --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe we could say that in\nthis, in these unique circumstances, where the officers\ncould not let the fellow drive off without a license, it\nwas not unreasonable to arrest him, but in some other\nsituation where they had no arrest authority it would\nbe.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: Your --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you know, let's\nassume that the stop was not based on some, some\ndeficiency in his license or some deficiency in the\ncar -- I don't know what else it could be -- like, he\nhad been going too fast, okay? And it's just a\nmisdemeanor. He was five miles over the speed limit.\nNow, in that situation you couldn't say, as\nyou've said here, gee, if they just let him go, he'd\nstill be driving without a license; they had to arrest\nhim; they had no choice. In that situation, he wouldn't\nnecessarily be going above the speed limit. Would that\nbe -- why couldn't you say it was reasonable here, but\nit wouldn't be reasonable there?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: Well, what we're asking the\nCourt to do is to let the States regulate this arrest\nauthority.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If that's the argument\nyou're making, then don't bring forward the argument\nthat they couldn't let him go because he'd be in\nviolation of the law. If you want us to make that\nnarrow a holding, I guess we can. Is that what you want\nus to do?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: All we're asking the Court\nto do is to affirm the probable cause standard that has\n-- without any further balancing, that the balancing has\noccurred when --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, you're asking us to\nbalance. You're asking us to say, after all, in this\ncase if they hadn't arrested he would have been\nviolating the law as soon as they let him go.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: No, I'm simply explain --\nwhat I was trying to so was to explain that as a matter\nof state law these officers have to make these\ndiscretionary calls. If that then becomes the\nconstitutional standard, that instead of a simple\nprobable cause finding you have to get into every\ndiscretionary call by the officer, that it -- it\nturns actually --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You say this was not\nunlawful under Virginia law, then, because of the factor\nyou brought forth?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: No, Your Honor. That was\nadversely litigated against us in the State court.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't know what\nyou're talking about a discretionary call. It wasn't a\ndiscretionary call. He couldn't arrest the person.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: Well -- but the problem is,\nif the standard then becomes a two-step probable cause,\nwhere we have to figure out as a matter of\nconstitutional law whether the officer guessed right in\nterms of one of these exceptions, then every\ndiscretionary judgment in the field becomes the occasion\nfor constitutional --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But suppose it works\nthe other way. If Virginia has a law saying you can\narrest anybody you want on our highways, but, you know,\nhere's what the offenses are, the officers did not have\nprobable cause to think a crime had been committed, but\nit was they had probable cause to arrest, I suppose\nunder the Respondent's theory that would be all right.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: It -- I mean, it certainly\nwould flow from that. So I think, given the\nmultitude --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask this question:\nYou would argue it doesn't matter whether it violated\nState or Federal law; it's a question of Federal law on\nprobable cause. But does the character of the crime for\nwhich the person is being arrested have any relevance to\nthe question whether the search is reasonable? For\nexample, supposing he is arrested for a tax offense;\ncould you go ahead and search him incident to that\narrest?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: The search incident to\narrest is a bright-line rule, Your Honor, that this\nCourt has promulgated in Robinson.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The answer is yes, they\ncould search?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: I'm sorry. Yes, the answer\nis yes, that if a crime has been committed the\nbright-line rule permits the officer to search the\nsuspect for officer safety as well as --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Even though the rationale\nfor the search incident to arrest doesn't apply?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: What the -- yes, because\nwhat the Court said in Robinson was: We're not\ninterested in delving into case-by-case litigation as to\nhow dangerous this person was and how -- and whether\nthere was a likelihood of evidence being found --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why would the rationale not\napply in that situation? Are you accepting the\nproposition that anybody who's arrested for a tax\noffense is not a danger to the arresting officer?\nHaven't there been some pretty dangerous people arrested\nover the years for tax offenses?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. McCULLOUGH: I agree with that. I'm\narguing that it's a bright-line rule and that if someone\nis arrested for a crime, tax or otherwise, it's not the\nnature of the crime --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you're also\narguing, as I understand it, that the -- that the\nsearch, even in the case of the tax arrest, does fall\nwithin the rationale of search incident to an arrest\nbecause one of those two rationales is officer safety.\nIsn't that your point?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. So you reject the\npremise of the question then? The premise of the\nquestion was that the search incident to the arrest in\nthe tax case is outside the rationale of searches\nincident to an arrest; and your position is it's not\noutside it.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: This Court has crafted a\nbright-line rule -- it has not distinguished between\ntypes of offenses; it doesn't have to be a violent\noffense; it could be a white-collar offense -- that\nacross the board there is virtue to having this\nbright-line rule that permits the officer to search\nincident to a lawful arrest. And in Robinson the Court\nnoted that a lawful arrest is a -- that it met a\nconstitutionally lawful arrest, one made with probable\ncause. This arrest was made with probable cause. The\nsearch incident to the arrest was lawful.\nI would ask the Court if I could keep my\nremaining time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Dreeben?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. DREEBEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe States and the Federal Government may\nfor a variety of reasons enact restrictions on officer\nauthority that exceed the requirements of the Fourth\nAmendment as this Court has articulated them.\nWhen such State law or Federal law\nextra-constitutional restrictions are violated, it is a\nmatter for the government that enacted them to determine\nwhat remedy appropriately flows from that violation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does the person making the\narrest at least have to have some arrest authority?\nMR. DREEBEN: This Court has never --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or will a janitor do the\njob? A janitor at the Justice Department becomes imbued\nwith the mission of the Department and he goes around\narresting people or searching people.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, certainly,\nJustice Scalia, such an individual wouldn't have\npositive law authority to engage in an arrest.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Just as this person here\ndidn't have positive law authority to engage in an\narrest.\nMR. DREEBEN: The question would then be\nwhether that means that it's automatically a\nconstitutional violation. I think in some situations\neven a governmental official can act in a private\ncapacity by acting outside the boundaries of that\nindividual's responsibility.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but he was purporting\nto act in an official capacity. And he did, indeed,\ngive the marijuana to the officials at the Justice\nDepartment.\nMR. DREEBEN: And if you assume that the\nCourt would have two options. It could either\nfederalize some sort of an amorphous requirement that\nthere must be law enforcement authority in an official\nin order for that official to engage in Fourth Amendment\nactivity, or it could hold that, what I think is the\nmore reasonable approach, which is that the bedrock\nrequirements of the Fourth Amendment protect against\narbitrariness, and the crucial one here is the existence\nof probable cause based on the facts to believe that the\nindividual has violated a law.\nIf that criteria is met, it is not\nconstitutionally unreasonable, absent where an\nextraordinary intrusion for the individual's liberty or\nprivacy interests to be compromised. It may be the most\nflagrant violation of departmental regulations in the\nworld, and in that case the department that has those\nregulations can take action, just as here Virginia says\nif you violate the arrestable offense rule under\nVirginia law, the consequence is not to exclude\nevidence. Virginia will not exclude evidence under its\nown State law for a violation of this provision.\nBut it does say under State law that a\nperson can resist an unlawful arrest, The officer can be\nsued for engaging in an unlawful arrest under State law,\nand that the officer can be fired or disciplined. And\nthose are the sanctions that the State has chosen to do.\nNow, what the Virginia Supreme Court has\ndone is come along and say, even though you do not\nintend this rule to trigger the exclusionary rule under\nVirginia law, you have no choice. As a matter of\nFederal constitutional law, if Virginia decides to\nexceed the constitutional minimum as this Court\nannounced in Atwater and place additional restrictions\non the arrest authority, it must pay a constitutional\nprice of having the evidence excluded if that rule is\nviolated.\nAt the outset, it's clear that imposing such\na Fourth Amendment rule would do nothing other than\ndiscourage the States from providing additional\nrestrictions as a matter of their own State's law that\nmay serve to protect citizen privacy interests above the\nfloor that this Court has identified as required by the\nFourth Amendment.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If you're right,\nMr. Dreeben, then the Court gave a false signal when it\nGVR'd in Lovelace, in the Lovelace case, the person who\nwas drinking in public, it GVR'd in light of Knowles.\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't know that it gave a\nfalse signal, Justice Ginsburg, but a GVR doesn't\nindicate this Court's disposition of the merits once all\nof the arguments are presented to it. And, admittedly,\nI think neither side is able to point to a case that\nsquarely addressed and conclusively resolved the issue\nthat's before this Court.\nWhat the Court has done, I think, under\nrelated issues under Fourth Amendment law is announce\npretty clearly that the fact that a State has either\nrenounced an interest in taking a particular law\nenforcement action that it could otherwise\nconstitutionally take or positively prohibited a law\nenforcement action does not mean that the action is\nunconstitutional.\nAs long ago as the Cooper v. California\ncase, the Court dealt with the situation where an\nofficer was not authorized to undertake an inventory\nsearch, and the California courts treat it as a\nviolation of their own law.\nThis Court said it was still a reasonable\nsearch under the Fourth Amendment; and unless\nRespondent -- excuse me, unless -- well, Respondent\nconcludes that there should be a different Fourth\nAmendment rule for searches than procedures, Cooper\nstands for the proposition that a violation of State law\ndoes not ipso facto equate to a violation of the Federal\nConstitution.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If we rule for Respondent\nin this case, would we have to reexamine the holding in\nCalifornia v. Greenwood?\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, Justice Kennedy.\nCalifornia v. Greenwood is the next case in the line\nwhere the Court recognized that California had made it\nillegal to conduct garbage searches. And you could make\nthe same argument that Respondent is making here today:\nThat California had renounced any interest in conducting\ngarbage searches, therefore there's nothing on the State\nside of the line to balance against the individual's\ninvasion of privacy, and therefore the State should\nlose. And this Court held precisely the opposite in\nCalifornia v. Greenwood, finding that it was\nconstitutionally reasonable to engage in the garbage\nsearch because there was no federally recognized\nexpectation of privacy, even though the State had\ndecided to go further and grant an additional layer of\nprotection to its citizens.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There could not have been\na warrant -- a grant-- a judge could not have given a\nwarrant for arrest on these charges.\nMR. DREEBEN: I'm venturing a little bit\noutside of my expertise under State law, but I think\nthat that's correct. Because State law provided that\nthis was not an arrestable offense unless one of the\nexceptions to the offense existed.\nAnd I should note that one of the offenses\nhere -- excuse me -- one of the exceptions here is that\na court of general jurisdiction could have entered an\nexemption from the arrestable offense rule and then\nofficers within that jurisdiction would have been\nconstitutionally and under State law --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How often and under what\ncircumstances is that Virginia -- Virginia law rule? I\nmean, when does a general district court give permission\nfor a custodial arrest in a certain class of cases?\nMR. DREEBEN: I know that it has done it. I\ndon't know that there are any restrictions on when it\nwould do it. The point, I think, of giving the general\ncourts the authority to do this is that these kinds of\nlaws are not necessarily enacted, as Respondent posits,\nto be supplementary protection for privacy. They do not\nnecessarily represent a judgment that law enforcement\nofficers should never bring people in for minor traffic\nmisdemeanors. They may represent a judgment that law\nenforcement officers should be out on the beat policing\nmore important crimes and it's a waste of social\nresources and scarce police resources to have them\nbringing people downtown for these kinds of offenses.\nIn a particular jurisdiction, law\nenforcement may make a case that actually it's important\nenough to deter various traffic violations and to ensure\nthat the individuals show up, that officers should have\nplenary authority to make arrests.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I should know this, but do\nwe defer to State law in determining the lawfulness of\nthe time before arraignment in the context of\nconfessions, the McNabb-Mallory rule?\nMR. DREEBEN: The McNabb-Mallory rule --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Which is Federal.\nMR. DREEBEN: -- is uniquely Federal. The\nclosest analog -- and this may be what Your Honor has in\nmind -- is that in the County of Riverside case the\nCourt set a 48-hour outside limit for when you have to\nbring an arrested individual before a magistrate for a\nprobable cause hearing. Under Respondent's position --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, was there any\nindication in that case that if the State had a shorter\nperiod, they would --\nMR. DREEBEN: No, and that's precisely, I\nthink, the point. All of the rules that this Court has\nannounced under the Fourth Amendment, the search\nincident to arrest rule, which is triggered as a\nbright-line rule without regard to whether the specifics\nof the case support it, under Respondent's theory\nVirginia could overrule that by saying officers shall\nnot conduct a search incident to arrest without a\nspecific exigency in that case. States could overrule\nwithin their own jurisdictions the Federal rule that\nthis Court announced in Riverside. It could say that\nindividuals have to be brought before a magistrate\nwithin 12 hours or they have to be released. And under\nRespondent's theory that you absorb State law into the\nreasonableness inquiry, this Court's Federal court\ndecision would be overruled. And most directly here,\nAtwater would be overruled with respect to\nnon-arrestable offenses if Respondent's position is\ncorrect that when the State has said that we don't want\nto undertake an arrest for a minor offense, therefore,\nthere's no longer any State interest in undertaking the\narrest.\nThe reality is that this Court has balanced\nas a matter of Fourth Amendment law what is\nconstitutionally necessary as a uniform Federal matter\nto protect people against arbitrary law enforcement\naction, and it's drawn the line at probable cause. And\nas this Court said in Whren, absent rare circumstances\nwhen probable cause exists, a search or seizure is\nreasonable.\nAnd the kind of rare circumstances that the\nCourt gave the example of in Whren were heightened\nintrusions on individual privacy or liberties such as\nsurgery to remove evidence or an unannounced entry into\na home. We don't have anything like that here and the\nstandard Federal rule should govern.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nDreeben.\nMr. Goldstein.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThe notion that the proud men who framed the\nConstitution would believe it reasonable to go out and\narrest someone for a non-arrestable offense and not only\ndo that, but having committed that trespass at common\nlaw, to further search them, is I think an extreme\nproposition and one that they would not have accepted.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you think they would\naccept arresting somebody for not wearing a seat belt?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Your Honor, I do --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me we've\ncrossed that bridge with Atwater.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No, Your Honor, I disagree,\nfor the reason that -- and there are obviously -- I'm\nnot here to tell the Court what its own precedents mean.\nBut Atwater makes quite clear that at common law this\nwas something that was subject to legislate ive\noverride, and that's what was reasonable at common law\nwhen the Constitution was framed. And that is,\nlegislatures sometimes said that you could arrest and\nsometimes said that you couldn't.\nBut two things were undisputable, I think,\nand that is when you did arrest illegally that was\nunreasonable --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The particular illegal\narrest here, to bring this down to earth a little bit,\nis I take it they arrested him because he had a\nsuspended -- he was driving without a good license?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So that Virginia law\nsays if you stop somebody, arrest him -- if you stop\nsomebody, you know he doesn't have a license to drive,\nyou can arrest him if you think he's going to continue\ndriving? Can't you?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So the policemen\nhere, according to you and I guess the Virginia court,\nmade a misjudgment. He thought this guy might still\ndrive somewhere or he might have thought it or a\npoliceman in similar circumstances might have thought\nit.\nSo Virginia says if, in fact, policemen, you\nstop somebody for suspended -- for driving without a\nlicense, and you make a mistake, you arrest him, we\ndon't think that's a big deal, because who knows if he's\ngoing to continue to drive. We don't even suspend. We\ndon't even suspend. We don't even suppress the\nevidence. That's Virginia.\nSo if Virginia isn't going to suppress the\nevidence because they think it's not a big deal to make,\nfor the policeman to make a mistake as to whether a\nperson who's driving without a license will keep driving\nonce the policeman goes away, why do you think Thomas\nJefferson and everybody else thought that that was such\na big deal that the evidence had to be suppressed?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: For a few reasons. First,\nVirginia does take this quite seriously. The officer\ncan be fired for violating the statute. That's no small\nthing.\nThe second is I wouldn't assume that\nVirginia believes and the Virginia legislature believed\nthat the evidence would not be suppressed, because for\nreasons that I'll explain in a minute the Virginia\nlegislature was triggering a long line of its court\ncases that say if you arrest someone for a\nnon-arrestable offense, the Fourth Amendment is\nviolated, and the application of the exclusionary rule\nhas never been questioned in that context.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought it's\nquestioned in your footnote 13 in your brief. You seem\nto suggest that the exclusionary rule is not at issue in\nthis case.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That's right. I don't\nquestion its application, but neither does Virginia,\nYour Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So - so we should\nwrite an opinion saying we're not saying that it was\ncorrect to -- we're not saying that it was correct to\nexclude the evidence in this case?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That's -- I think that\nthat's right. That also happened in California v.\nGreenwood, you may recall, Mr. Chief Justice, where\nthere was some discussion at oral argument about would\nwe believe the exclusionary rule should be applied here.\nThat question had not been preserved. That case is on\nremand in the California Supreme Court.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is the difference\nbetween this and Whren? That is, in Whren the arrest\nviolated a D.C. regulation that says a plainclothes\nofficer cannot approach a car except in immediate cases\nof immediate danger. And in Whren we said that isn't\nsuch a big deal and we don't think the Fourth Amendment\nturns on that kind of triviality.\nAll right. If it doesn't turn on that kind\nof arrest procedure triviality, is how we characterized\nit there, how is this any any different?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Whren is different in\nseveral different ways. The first is that that was a\nchallenge to the stop, not the search incident to\narrest. The claim was that the officers under a local\nD.C. Government regulation did not have the power to\nmake a traffic stop because there was a local regulation\nthat said if you're not in uniform and if you're not in\na police car, a marked car, you shouldn't make those\ntraffic stops.\nSo, it's different on a couple of different\nactions. The nature of the constitutional challenge,\nthe nature of the law that's being evoked, the local\nregulation rather than legislation, I think, are the\nprincipal ones.\nHere we're dealing with something quite\nfundamental, and I haven't gotten to this\nCourt's precedents applying the common law rule that I\ndescribed at the beginning, so if I could do and then\ncompare Whren. Post -- define the common law, every\nsince Weeks, which is the first case of this Court to\nrecognize the search incident arrest exception, all the\nway through Di Re, Miller, Johnson, Ker, DeFillippo,\nthose are five cases that confront the question in this\ncase, I believe that genuinely confront it; is not\ndictum, it is holding.\nThose cases confront the question: Can you\nhave a constitutional search incident to an illegal\narrest? Illegal there not being unconstitutional, but a\nviolation of State law.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, why do you draw a\ndistinction between something that's prohibited by a\nstatute, something that's prohibited by a local ordnance\nor let's say it's a directive of the police department?\nAnd if it's -- if the arrest is contrary to any of those\nthings, it's unlawful under State law, is it not?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: The court hasn't ever\nconfronted that question. The places -- the line of\ncases that I described were one of two things, Positive\nState legislation enacted by the legislature or common\nlaw. It has never dealt with the locality question.\nWhren suggests that maybe a local police regulation is\ntoo variable. We would win under either rule.\nThe -- I think the core reason you would\ndraw the line at legislation is because this -- the\nFourth Amendment is not just an instrumental thing\ndesigned to do good. It is, as designed, to apply\ncommon law concepts of reasonableness, which was the\nfoundation --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I thought it was your\nargument that if the arrest is unlawful under State law\nit's an unreasonable search, an unreasonable arrest\nunder the Fourth Amendment?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That's right. And your\nquestion, Justice Alito, is designed to test what I mean\nby unlawful in terms of what sources -- the State\nconstitution, legislation, local police practices.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. It's designed to test\nwhether you really mean unlawful under State law.\nEither you don't mean it, because something that\nviolates a municipal ordnance is unlawful under State\nlaw, and yet you would not apply your test. So you\ncould express your test differently, unlawful under\nState statutory law.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: If I have conveyed that\nimpression, I am sorry. I did not intend to. Our rule\nis that if it's unlawful. All I'm saying is the Court\ncould conclude that local police regulations, for\nexample, are too variable to -- and Whren calls them\n\"trivialities,\" so we won't pick them up.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, it says the laws\nof the 50 States are pretty variable on this question as\nwell.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: As are the laws of whether\nit's a crime at all, as are under Indianapolis v. Edmund\nand lots of other cases where the court --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do we have to look\nat both of those varieties? Let's say the State has a\nrule that, yes, you can arrest people in a way that we\nwould say you can't, but you don't have to have probable\ncause. You just have to -- they're just arrestable.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No, as Justice Ginsburg\nsuggests, you have to have probable cases to arrest.\nCases like Berkemer, Seth --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- is probable cause\nto arrest. The State has a law that says you can arrest\nin these circumstances whether or not you have probable\ncause to believe that a crime has been committed.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I'm sorry. By that phrase I\nmean there is a constitutional component. Part of the\nconstitutional floor is that you have to have sufficient\ncause. That's a guarantee of the Fourth Amendment.\nThis Court's cases make clear you can't go below --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought you were\ntelling us it has to be sufficient cause to arrest, not\nsufficient cause to believe that a crime has been\ncommitted.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That is necessary but not a\nsufficient condition, Mr. Chief Justice. There's\nobviously a -- the constitutional floor includes the\nelement of the -- the degree of proof that's required by\nthis Court precedents.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it is, as your\nfriends on the other side put it, you are advocating a\ntwo-step process. There has to be probable cause to\narrest and there has to be probable cause to believe a\ncrime has been committed?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I view those as the same\nthing. We may be just having --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, they're\ndifferent here. They had probable cause to believe a\ncrime has been committed, but you say they didn't have\nprobable cause to arrest because State law makes it\nillegal.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: In that sense, absolutely.\nI just wanted to make sure I understood the terminology.\nThat's correct.\nBut let me make quite clear that we are\ndiscussing in the first half hour and the second half\nhour I think two slightly different things. The first\nhalf hour focused on the constitutionality of the arrest\nvel non, which is at issue in Atwater, for example, and\nat issue -- not even in Whren, which is just a traffic\nstop.\nI am focusing on the somewhat different\npoint. There is a line of cases that deals with the\nconstitutionality of the search incident to arrest and\nit says because at common law you could not search\nsomeone pursuant to an arrest that was a trespass, the\nsearch itself is unconstitutional. So if at the time of\nthe framing a Federal officer, a Federal marshal, at the\ntime of the framing had the power to arrest them for\nState law offenses, as they still do under the OLC\nopinions.\nIf a Federal marshal had gone up to someone\nwho's committing a completely trivial offense, Atwater\nrecognizes there are offenses at common law that are not\narrestable. That would be a trespass and to search the\nperson incident to that arrest would have violated the\nFourth Amendment, we believe. It would have been\nunreasonable. When Mapp applies the Fourth Amendment to\nthe States, it would have been --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the State\nmakes a trivial offense arrestable, as in Atwater?\nYou're suggesting in that situation the common law rule\nwe have doesn't apply. It's a trivial offense, but it's\nmade arrestable and therefore it doesn't violate the\nFourth Amendment to search incident to that arrest.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That's right. At common law\nand under the Fourth Amendment, that's right. You look\nto the positive source of authority, which is State law\nauthority to arrest or a common law authority to arrest.\nThat would not be unconstitutional. That -- that rule\nalso make sense as a question of the structure of our\ndemocracy. Remember, it puts in the hands of the\nlegislature, which can be held responsible for the\ndecision to make a trivial offense --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what if\nthe legislature -- this was the hypothetical Mr. Dreeben\nposed. What if the legislature says yes, you can arrest\nfor this offense but you cannot search incident to the\narrest, because we think that's too much of an intrusion\ngiven the fact that it's a relatively trivial offense?\nIn that case, would our doctrine saying under the Fourth\nAmendment you can search incident to a valid arrest be\nreversed preempted, preempted by the State law?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No. There are times --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the State can\ndefine the circumstances under which you can have an\narrest, but the State can't define and limit the\nconsequences of the arrest?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That's right. That is --\nthere are traditions that are rooted in the common law,\nthat the search incident to arrest here was pursuant to\na trespass at common law that was completely\nunreasonable.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't -- isn't the\ndifficulty with that argument that we -- we have\nrejected the, in effect, the trespass rationale; and\nwhat you're telling us now, it seems to me, based on in\neffect trespass concepts, is that so far as the Fourth\nAmendment is concerned an arrest may constitutionally be\nmade, but the officer following that arrest may not take\nthe step of determining whether the individual arrested\nhas on his person anything that can be used to hurt the\nofficer like a knife or a gun?\nAnd why should be we draw what seems to\nme -- if we scrap, as we have done, the trespass\nanalogy, why should we make what seems to me at least an\nirrational distinction of saying the Fourth Amendment\nsays it's okay to arrest but it's not okay to protect\nyourself after you have arrested? Why should we accept\nsuch a rule?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: This is I think the hardest\nquestion for us, and so if I could have the time to give\nyou a couple of answers. The first is remember your\ninstrumental point is that the officer has the person,\nthey need to protect themselves. We know that is not\nitself -- and I'm going to give you a couple of\nanswers -- that is not itself to make the search\nconstitutional because everyone agrees that if the\narrest was unconstitutional, then the search,\nnotwithstanding the exigencies that exist under Chimel\nand like cases all the way back, exist. So it's not\nenough that the officer has to protect himself. The\nreason --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right. But we're starting\nwith a different premise.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We're starting with a\nconstitutional premise.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. I understand this.\nJustice Souter, I understand. I was just trying to get\nto your -- what I think is the greatest sort of logical\nforce: The officer need to protect himself.\nNow, to get to the harder case, which is\nyours, and that is accept that the arrest is\nconstitutional. We of course don't do that. We believe\nthat there isn't a sufficient interest to make it\nreasonable, but you posit otherwise. The reason is\ngiven by Justice Powell's concurrence in Robinson, which\nis the fundamental search and seizure arrest case, and\nhe says when the person is lawfully arrested they have\nengaged in conduct that they know can subject them to\narrest, they have a reduced expectation of privacy. So\nwhile it's the case that the governmental interest\nremains the same -- protect the officer, find the\nevidence -- the other side of the Fourth Amendment\nbalance is fundamentally different, because when a\nperson has engaged in conduct which they know does not\nsubject them to arrest they do not have a reduced\nexpectation of privacy.\nThis individual had every reason to believe\ndating back to the traditions of common law, to positive\nState law, that they would not be searched incident to\narrest.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If that -- if that logic is\nsound and that logic depends on Justice Powell's use of\nthe word unlawfully, then it seems to me the -- the only\nway to arrest an irrational system would to be conclude\nthat, in fact, the arrest is not constitutionally\nlawful. Because on -- on your logic, you're still left\nwith the problem that I raised; and a constitutional\narrest in which the officer does not violate the Fourth\nAmendment by apprehending the person, and yet the\nofficer is disabled from protecting himself, if we're\ngoing to have a sensible rule, we've either got to say\nthe Fourth Amendment allows him to make the search\nincident and protect himself, or we've got to have a\nrule that says the Fourth Amendment doesn't allow him to\nmake the search -- make the arrest in the first place.\nOtherwise we've got a crazy system.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Can I just correct one\nthing? And that is it does not depend on Justice\nPowell's use of the word unlawful. I believe to rule\nagainst us, Justice Souter, that you will have to\noverrule the line of cases from Di Re to DeFillipo.\nThose are on point. Now you may decide --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Don't you think we have\nto, if not overrule, at least back away from the holding\nin California versus Greenwood?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No, Justice Kennedy, and\nthat's why I focused so much on searches incident to\narrest. There are times when State law is incorporated\ninto the Fourth Amendment, and everybody agrees that\nregulatory searches are; inventory searches are, there\nare times when it isn't. And California v Greenwood is\nnot one and there's a logical reason for it. And that\nis that the premise of when you were deciding in a -- in\na trash search, this Court's document looked at two\nthings. The first is, is there a reasonable expectation\nof privacy, and if there is do we balance the interest?\nCalifornia v Greenwood says there was no reasonable\nexpectation of privacy because that's evaluated as a\nsocietal matter. I'm focusing on a very narrow question\nthat doesn't disturb any other doctrines.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about Cooper -- Cooper\nv California?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I think Cooper v California\nis a very good case for us, because Cooper and all its\nprogeny say that State law has to authorize and\ndetermine the validity of the inventory search. If you\nviolate the State regulations on when you conduct an\ninventory search, you violated the Fourth Amendment.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can we go back for a\nsecond? Because, the reason I asked my question is I\nwas thinking about this very differently, and I just\nwant to have an answer, and I want your best thinking on\nthis. My thought is that the answer to the question of\nwhether it violates the Fourth Amendment when a State --\nwhen a person is arrested in violation of State law, the\nanswer is: it depends. Sometimes yes, sometimes no.\nObviously, if there is no probable cause or if there\nwasn't a crime at all, as just defined, the answer is\nyes; but then I look at Whren and it says if all that\nwas at stake was a kind of arrest procedure State law,\nherein -- there embodied in a rule, the answer is no.\nSo I look at this one. And this one it seems to me\nthere is probable cause; it is a crime; moreover, it is\na crime for which the State permits arrest where the\nofficer subjectively thinks he's likely to keep driving.\nSo it seems to me that's maybe much more close to what\nwe had in Whren.\nNow I want you to say -- I want your\ncomments on what I -- it's hypothetical, my statement,\nbecause I want to get your reaction to that point of\nview. I'm not saying I hold it. But I'm putting it\nforward so that I can get your reaction and argument.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, I think it is a\nterribly difficult rule to administer when you try to\ndecide, well if this is a law that sometimes allows\narrest and sometimes does not. It is an infinitely more\nadministrable rule on our side, where we say to the\npolice officers, you have the power to arrest or not and\nthat's what determines --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I think it is much easier\nto administer, to have a uniform Federal standard,\nrather than whether or not an officer can arrest in one\ncounty for something and not in another county whether\nhe has to have a badge or not. Those are the kind of\ntrivialities we talked about in Whren.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, Justice Kennedy,\nremember, we have one standard for an officer on the\nstreet, and that is, look -- do, if you're allowed to\narrest, you can arrest, and that's what will determine\nthe constitutionality of the search incident to arrest.\nThe Government posits two different standards that\ngovern the officer's conduct: a Federal one and State\none.\nBut let me also get to your point, Justice\nKennedy, that you are worried that are all kinds of\nthese State laws. There's -- you know, are you out of\nyour jurisdiction , are you wearing a uniform? What we\nthink that the common law was concerned with, and this\nline -- this Court's court line of cases from Di Re to\nDeFillipo is a more fundamental judgment. It's like the\njudgment whether it's a crime at all. The police power\nof the State is most fundamentally, is this a crime, can\nwe arrest for it, someone for it, so that we will hold\nthem? And those are the judgments: is its arrestable\nor not? And not these other little things that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But under that analysis,\nit seems to you we rely on the citizen's expectation of\nprivacy as the justification. And I think\nJustice Kennedy makes a rather strong response to that,\nbecause it's unrealistic to assume that a citizen in\ncertain counties in Virginia had such an expectation but\ndid not in other counties, because most citizens don't\nknow the sophisticated aspects of the Virginia law.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: This is a very -- just as a\ncourt note, there's no other State that has one of these\nstatutes. Just in terms of your thinking about whether\nthis is a common practice, we haven't been able to find\nany others, and even in Virginia, it's only to a small\nbody of offenses. But even taking as a given --\nJustice Stevens, I think doctrinally, as Justice Powell\nsays in Robinson, the notion is that people go out into\nthe world and engage in conduct, and we expect them to\nknow the law. Sometimes that's an unreasonable\nexpectation, but it's the only premise that this Court\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, can I get\nback to your discussion of Cooper? In Cooper, you said\nthat if it violates the State law for an inventory\nsearch, then you can't search incident to that. But\nthat's because it is then not an inventory search. Here\nthere's no doubt that this was an arrest, whether it\ncomplied with State law or not.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Chief Justice Roberts, I do\ndisagree. Post-Cooper, in South Dakota v. Opperman,\neven if the police officers label it an inventory search\n-- the person says, oh, we were just trying to keep\ntrack of everything, so nobody doubts they were really\ninventorying things -- the Court has said it's the --\nthe practice is, the State practice is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but just -- it\ngets to -- I mean, if you don't follow the State rules,\nit doesn't comply with the rules for an inventory\nsearch. But here you're saying if don't -- you're not\nsaying if you don't follow the State rules, it's not an\narrest. It's not a lawful arrest. But that's a\ndifferent question than whether or not it is an arrest.\nOur precedents say if it's an arrest, you can search\nincident to the arrest.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, I\ndisagree. This Court has said many times, and indeed\nsquarely held in Johnson, where the evidence was\nsuppressed, that it has to be an arrest that is lawful\nunder State law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Goldstein, can I bring\nyou back to Cooper v. California?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which you say is a good\ncase for you. I don't see how you can say that. This\nwas a case of a car impounded. The State court had said\nthat there was no authority to search the car, simply\nbecause it was impounded, and we said the question here\nis not whether the search was authorized by State law;\nthe question is rather whether the search was a\nreasonable one under the Fourth Amendment.\nJust as a search authorized by State law may\nbe an unreasonable one under that amendment, so may a\nsearch not expressly authorized by State law be\njustified as a constitutional reasonable one. And you\nthink that helps your case?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Not -- I don't think that\nlanguage is relevant for the following reason: What the\nCourt said in Cooper was that the seizure of the car,\nwhich is analogous to the arrest here, right? They\nseized my client's person; they seized the car. The\nCourt said because the seizure of the car was lawful\nunder State law, then the search incident to was. And\nlet me just read to you from Coolidge versus --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even though the State law\ndid not authorize it.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: The State law did not speak\nto it either way, but -- it didn't speak to it either\nway.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They were assume ing, in\nthat passage, that the State law did not authorize it,\nor otherwise the passage makes no sense.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Scalia, I disagree.\nIn any event, post-Cooper, South Dakota v. Opperman, as\nthe conversation between the Chief Justice and I was\njust explaining, is perfectly clear that the inventory\nsearch has to be authorized pursuant to State\nregulation. If after Cooper this is perfectly settled,\nthere really isn't --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if we\nassume, contrary to your footnote 13, that the\nexclusionary rule is implicated in this case, could you\nexplain why, under the Federal Constitution, there\nshould be imposed on the State an exclusionary rule for\na violation of State law when State law does not impose\nan exclusionary rule for the violation of its law?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Assuming the Court decides\nthat the question was not waived because it wasn't\nbriefed, the reason is that this Court's exclusionary\nrule precedents look to something else, and that is:\nDid the evidence follow directly from the\nunconstitutional conduct? And here it did.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess the\nquestion would be: Why doesn't our jurisprudence on\nwhether there's an arrest also look to something else,\nrather than whether it's permitted or violated under\nState law? In other words, the State doesn't -- the\nState law does not provide for the exclusionary rule,\nbut we say the Fourth Amendment does.\nUnder -- this is not a valid arrest under\nState law, but your brothers say under the Fourth\nAmendment it is because there's probable cause to\nbelieve a crime has been committed.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, I think\nthat illustrates the point I am willing to accept, and\nthat is there are times that State law is relevant under\nthis Court's doctrines; there are times it isn't. Welsh\nv. Wisconsin, for example, is another example where the\nCourt looks squarely to the State law of whether and how\nserious the offense is. My point is that there is a\nvery particular doctrine that is in play here that deals\nwith searches incident to arrest.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if Virginia has a\nstatute that said it's unlawful to arrest for a traffic\nviolation, but that it is lawful under Virginia law for\nan officer to conduct a search incident to any arrest,\nwhether it's lawful under Virginia law or not? Would we\nfollow that latter Virginia law?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I don't know. That is the\ntrue answer, because no State has such a law. It would\ndepend, I think, on whether the arrest itself satisfied\nconstitutional --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What is the difference\nbetween that law and in effect what Virginia has in\nplace? They say the arrest is unlawful, but they don't\nprovide for the exclusion of evidence that's obtained as\na result of that arrest under Virginia law.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: The reason is I think the\none -- that the Court has never looked to the State law\nremedies in Di Re, Miller, Johnson, Ker, and DeFillippo,\nand that it looks to what the common law would look to,\nwhich is: Is the arrest legal or not?\nI also would repeat what I said to Justice\nBreyer, and that is I would not assume that Virginia\nbelieves that the exclusionary rule wouldn't apply\nbecause those precedents trigger the Fourth Amendment.\nBut, Justice Breyer, I do want to come back\nto your question about, okay, Whren. The important\ndifferences are: Remember Whren didn't just say that\nthings about whether people can be arrested are\ntrivialities. It's at the core of the Fourth Amendment.\nThe Court would never say that arrest is a triviality.\nWhat it's talking about is what concerned\nJustice Kennedy, and that is the kind of rule in Whren,\nwhich is the guy had to be in a police uniform and\ndriving around in a marked police cruiser, which could\nvary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the Court felt\nthat was more of a triviality. This is a much more\nfundamental statement --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And both arrests are\nillegal, but you're saying that there's a difference.\nSo your bright-line rule now seems to evaporate.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Kennedy, I don't --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean I'm assuming that\nyour answer to my question about the badge or the wrong\ncounty and so forth would not result in suppression.\nCorrect me if I have misinterpreted your argument.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: We have proposed two\nalternative rules. Fundamentally, that's right. And\nthat is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What's right?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I'm sorry. You're right:\nOn our core condition, the evidence would not be\nsuppressed. The reason is that we think the most\nfundamental State judgment here is whether this offense\nis arrestable. Alternatively, the Court could apply a\nrule that just says State officers, if they're allowed\nto arrest lawfully, then that will generate a\nconstitutional search incident to arrest. We would win\nunder either either rule.\nI think the core of our case is a much\nsimpler rule that simply says if the State has decided\nthis thing is not arrestable, it obviously doesn't have\nan interest in the arrest that would outweigh the\nindividual's expectation of privacy -- remember search\nincident to arrest is an exigency. There is no --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But then if you -- do you\naccept the proposition then, in some of these minor\ncases, the arrest might be valid, then you're whole\nargument about the Framers and the trespass and so forth\nis wrong.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: To -- that's correct. If we\nare going to follow the common law and the rule that is\narticulated, I think, in every single\nsearch-incident-to-arrest case, that it has to be a\nlawful arrest, that's right. It will take up all of\nState arrest law. I'm not trying to hide from that\nfact. But the Court has never had a problem with that.\nIn all of those cases all through time, it has never had\nany problem with administerability or anything else with\na rule that simply says to the police officer: If\nyou're allowed to arrest him, arrest him; if you're not,\nyou're not, and you can't search him constitutionally.\nThat is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think your friend\nagreed that the cases didn't establish whether our\nreferences to probable cause meant to probable cause to\narrest or probable cause to believe that a crime had\nbeen committed. You don't agree with that? Do you\nthink that the cases foreclose their position?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I do when it comes to the\nsearch-incident-to-arrest cases. I think two things.\nThis is my understanding of the Court's precedents. The\nCourt has said if you have probable cause, you can\narrest. In every case that it has said that, it has\nbeen lawful at State law to arrest -- to arrest. So the\nCourt has confronted this question when it comes to the\nconstitutionality of the arrest vel non.\nThere is a second line of cases that deals\nspecifically with this search-incident-to-arrest\ndoctrine, and in every one of those, it has both said it\nhas to be a lawful arrest. And then in five separate\ncases, it has explained what it meant by a \"lawful\narrest.\" And it can't be dictum. The evidence in\nJohnson versus the United States was suppressed. It has\nto have been the holding of the court.\nWe think that that is a sensible rule for\ntwo reasons: It is what Framers meant. It cannot be\nthe case that a Federal marshal, at the time of the\nframing, could go and just arrest somebody for a\ncompletely trivial offense -- that was a trespass -- and\nthen search them. And, second, Justice Powell's\nconcurrence in Robinson makes a lot of sense. But if\nyou engage in constitutional --\nJUSTICE ALITO: In Johnson, the search was\nillegal because they illegally entered the hotel room.\nIsn't that right? So it didn't matter what happened\nafter that point.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That is not what the Court\nsaid. The Court was quite clear on this, Justice Alito.\nI just don't think there's two ways about it. It was\nquite on all five of these cases.\nI'm not saying the Court couldn't have\ndecided the case otherwise. That's true. I think the\nCourt could have had a different rationale, but the\npoint is it didn't. All of these cases cite each other.\nIt's a uniform line of authority. It's not an accident.\nIt's not --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The Court simply said\nwe're going to use our Federal supervisory power and\nincorporate the State law of arrest. If we don't have\nanother body of law, we're going to do it. It didn't\nsay it was required to by the Constitution. That's not\nthe way I read Di Re.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, then -- I don't know\nhow you pronounce it either, but I do know that Johnson,\nKer, and DeFillippo are cases that are against the\nState. They are not supervisory authority cases.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Then you have three cases,\nnot five.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, I disagree.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Putting cases aside for the\nmoment --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean if we reach this\nquestion, you must have lost on the first question. I\nmean you win -- if you win on the first question, you\nwin.\nIf you -- all right. If you have lost on\nthe first question, this is not an unreasonable search\n-- arrest, rather, under the Fourth Amendment.\nAnd, moreover, it's not enough of a big\ndeal, so the State makes it suppressible. Otherwise, a\n-- and so now we're talking about minor things under\nState law that is secondary at the least.\nAnd there, when the policeman make a mistake\nabout that, the reason we let him search is he might be\nhurt, the policeman. There's danger involved.\nAnd so I don't see why at the moment that\nrationale wouldn't apply just as strongly with a reason\nfor it being unlawful under State but not Federal law is\na violation of one of these subsidiary rules whether he,\nyou know, thought the guy was going to keep driving\nunder the suspended license or, you know, might be risky\nor might not show up.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: May I? There is no claim of\ngood faith here which could be raised to a Fourth\nAmendment argument in a later case. There's absolutely\nno mistake. And we don't want to encourage officers to\nconduct illegal arrests and search people.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can finish your\nanswer.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That's it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right. Thank\nyou, Mr. Goldstein.\nMr. McCullough, you have four minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. McCULLOUGH\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. McCULLOUGH: Thank you.\nFirst, when counsel says that this is some\nkind of a unique Virginia statute, that's wrong. The\nbrief filed by the ABA shows that all but nine States\nhave enacted provisions that are similar, that involve\nrestrictions on their officers' authority, and each of\nthose has exceptions, and so on and so forth.\nSo it is not a unique situation. You have\nclear rules. Why would you trade them in for a morass?\nAn arrest is constitutional if the officers have\nprobable cause to believe a crime has been committed.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Any crime at all?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Any crime at all;\njaywalking, for example?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: That's -- that's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We would never know about\nit if the -- if the misdemeanor, or jaywalking offense,\nwas not committed in the officer's presence.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: That's right. In the case\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's not a problem for\nyou here, but that is a limitation on what we have held.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: That's correct. In\nAtwater, a jaywalking arrest is constitutionally\npermissible. Atwater did not reach the in-the-presence\nquestion, and it is not presented here because the\noffense occurred in the officer's presence. So --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. McCullough, what is\nhere, for some reason the Commonwealth did not cite\nCooper v. California, which I can't understand unless\nyou agree with your friend that it has been overruled by\nlater cases.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: No. I think -- we relied\non Greenwood, and so I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand. Why didn't\nyou cite Cooper v. California?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: I don't have an explanation\nfor that. We certainly think it strongly -- as the\nUnited States points out in their brief, that it\nstrongly supports our position.\nAnd as the lower courts have noted when\nfacing a similar argument, you've already held that when\nit comes to a search, that under Greenwood and Cooper,\nthat State-law considerations aren't going to be what\nthe constitutional inquiry turns on.\nWhy would you have this incongruity where\nthat's true in Greenwood and Cooper with a search of a\nresidence or an automobile but then you have a different\nrule when it comes to an arrest? The States have been\nhandling this problem, but it's an issue of State law.\nAnd the State here has never held, going\nback to 1924, that a violation of State law rises to the\nlevel of a constitutional arrest and -- or, excuse me --\nthat -- let me restate that.\nThat a violation of State law warrants the\nexclusionary rule at the State level. So when the\nlegislature enacted this, they contemplated that\nspecific set of remedies.\nSo, at the end of the day, we just ask the\nCourt to adhere to its jurisprudence; that the arrest is\nconstitutional because it is made with probable cause.\nThere was a violation of state law, but it wasn't a\nconstitutional problem.\nAnd so we would ask the Court to reverse the\njudgment below.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. McCullough, there is\none thing that I was curious about. It is this Virginia\nlaw that allows the custodial arrest pursuant to an\norder of a general district court.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: When is that used?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: That is used with some\nfrequency, and we certainly saw an increase in the wake\nof the Moore decision. I can't go county by county and\ncity by city, but it has common currency.\nAnd one example is Portsmouth evidently,\nalthough it is not clear -- we have gotten conflicting\nanswers. When Mr. Moore was arrested, there is no such\norder. But a few miles down the road the City of\nVirginia Beach does have such an order.\nAnd this just shows the complexities the\nCourt would be stepping in where, if Mr. Moore is\narrested in Portsmouth for the exact same crime on the\nexact same facts, it is unconstitutional under Moore's\nrule.\nBut he goes a few miles down the road to the\nCity of Virginia Beach, and the arrest is perfectly\nconstitutional because the district court has entered\nsuch an order. And it just doesn't make sense, as the\nCourt noted in Whren, for constitutional provisions to\nbe so variable.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What would be the basis\nof a -- can a district court enter such an order just\nbecause it thinks it's a good idea? Are there any\ngrounds in --\nMR. McCULLOUGH: The statute -- I see my\ntime has expired. The statute at issue, 46.2-936, does\nnot really lay out particular criteria. So it is -- and\nthe issue hasn't been litigated in the Virginia courts\nas to the criteria that's required. But it seems to be\nbroad discretion by the general district judge.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
