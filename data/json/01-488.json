        "content": "(11:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in No. 01-488, Timothy Stuart Ring v. Arizona.\nMr. Hurwitz.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW D. HURWITZ\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. HURWITZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn Apprendi v. New Jersey, this Court held that\nthe Sixth Amendment guarantee of jury trial extends to the\nfinding of any fact that exposes the defendant to a\ngreater sentence than he could have received on the basis\nof the jury verdict alone. We submit that that principle\ncontrols this case.\nIn Arizona, a defendant convicted of first\ndegree murder may be sentenced on the basis of the jury\nverdict alone only to a sentence of life imprisonment.\nThe judge in Arizona has no power, no legal discretion\nunder the law to sentence a convicted first degree murder\ndefendant to death.\nQUESTION: Well, if you're correct, Mr. Hurwitz,\nI take it we would have to overrule not merely Walton, but\nClemons against Mississippi, Cabana against Bullock, and\nSpaziano against Florida.\nMR. HURWITZ: Your Honor, let me take those\ncases separately because I do not think that at least two\nof them are implicated by the position that we urge today.\nCertainly Walton would be have to be -- would be\noverruled because it's directly on point.\nAnd certainly, to the extent that Spaziano says\nthat a judge may, in the first instance, make the finding\nof fact to -- to -- of -- of an aggravating circumstance\nin order to allow a death sentence, it would be also -- it\nwould be also implicated and overruled by the position we\nurge today.\nWith respect to Clemons, Clemons was a case in\nwhich a jury made findings of fact on multiple counts that\nallowed a defendant to be sentenced to death, and the\nissue on appeal was rather whether, one of more of those\nfactors having fallen out, the remaining factors could be\nweighed against mitigating factors for purposes of\ndetermining in the sentencing phase, the discretionary\nphase of the -- of the capital punishment issue, whether\nor not there could be imposed a capital punishment at that\npoint. So, I do not believe that Clemons is implicated by\nour position today.\nRather, our point is very --\nQUESTION: How about Cabana?\nMR. HURWITZ: Cabana, Your Honor, I suggest is a\nmore difficult question. Its reasoning would be\nimplicated by our position today, but I -- as we suggested\nin our brief, I think there is a distinction. In Cabana\n-- or Cabana -- the issue was whether or not a particular\nsentence, where all the facts necessary under State law\nhad been found by the jury, was unconstitutional as\napplied to a particular defendant. That sort of as-\napplied analysis is the kind of thing that judges\ntypically do. They look at the law and lay it next to the\nfacts of the case and determine whether or not that law,\nas applied, is unconstitutional with respect to a\nparticular defendant or a particular sentence.\nThe issue posed by -- by this case and by\nApprendi is, I think, a quite different one. It is when\nState law expressly requires a number of factors as a\nprerequisite to the imposition of a particular penalty,\nthe maximum penalty allowed by law, whether or not the\nState can systematically deny to defendants in those cases\nthe right to a jury trial.\nQUESTION: What other States have schemes that\nunder your position would also fail the Apprendi test?\nMR. HURWITZ: Your Honor, we -- I think we\nattempted to summarize the -- the status on page 38 of our\nbrief. We think there are eight or nine States whose\nsystems would be implicated by this. But what is not\nclear in all of those States -- and to take Florida as an\nexample, Your Honor -- is whether or not in a system\nwhich, as this Court suggested in Jones, where the jury\nmakes, by implication or by necessity, a finding of a\nparticular aggravating factor in order to recommend a\ndeath sentence, whether or not that system would -- would\nbe affected by the principle that we urge. Certainly\nthose States where there is no jury involved in finding\nthe necessary aggravating circumstance would be the ones\nthat would be implicated, and I would suggest that that\ncategory is probably somewhat less than the category in\nfootnote 35 of our brief.\nIt is clear, however, that whatever the effect\non other States, Arizona's system precisely complies and\nprecisely matches up to the rule that this Court announced\nin Apprendi. It is simply not possible in Arizona for a\njudge to impose this sentence of death without first\nfinding a fact that Arizona's State law specifies is\nnecessary for the imposition of that maximum punishment.\nAnd under that circumstance, we suggest there is no basis\nfor distinction of Apprendi.\nNow, the State has suggested in this case that\none basis for a distinction is that the Arizona statute\nsays, within one single statute, the range of punishment,\nthe possible punishment for first degree murder is either\nlife -- life without possibility of parole, or death. But\nI would suggest that distinction makes no difference.\nCertainly in the Jones case, the precursor to\nApprendi, a case that this Court considered a year before\nApprendi, a single statute set forth the range of\npunishment. In the Harris case, the case this Court\nconsidered only several weeks ago, where the government\nconceded that section 841, the drug statute, was covered\nby Apprendi, several different punishments are set forth\nin a single statute.\nIt is difficult to believe that Apprendi would\nhave been -- come out differently, that there would have\nbeen a different result in that case, if the statute\ninstead read there's a possible punishment of 20 years for\ndischarging a firearm with racial motivation, but the last\n5 years may not be imposed. You may not exceed 15 years\nin the absence of racial motivation.\nQUESTION: If we were to accept your position,\nMr. Hurwitz, what would it do to the Federal Sentencing\nGuidelines?\nMR. HURWITZ: Mr. Chief Justice, let me focus on\nonly one aspect of the sentencing guidelines because it\nseems to me that there's no implication whatsoever for\ndownward departures and that the -- this Court has already\nmade clear, as the guidelines themselves say, that you\ncan't exceed the maximum sentence provided by the\nunderlying substantive statute.\nSo, if I can focus on the question of what would\nhappen --\nQUESTION: Upward -- upward adjustments within\nthe maximum.\nMR. HURWITZ: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. With\nrespect to those, I think there is a distinction, and let\nme suggest it to the Court.\nIn Arizona, the -- the judge simply has no legal\npower, no discretion, no ability whatsoever to impose a\nsentence greater than life in the absence of finding a\nparticular aggravating circumstance specified by the State\nin its statutes.\nWith respect to the sentencing guidelines, a\njudge has discretion, and we know that because you review\nsentencing decisions for abuse of discretion. So, the\njudge has the legal discretion to impose a sentence in\nexcess of the so-called presumptive range upon the finding\nor upon noting in the record any number of particular\nfacts, not specified by statute.\nQUESTION: Yes, but he didn't -- it's a strange\nkind of discretion that can be reversed on appeal. He\ndoesn't have discretion. The whole purpose of the\nguidelines is to eliminate the discretion, to say you must\ngive this sentence if these factors exist.\nMR. HURWITZ: Justice Scalia, my point is, I\nthink, that in our case the judge has no power at all. He\ncan never find -- he can never exceed that particular\nlimit, the limit being life, in the absence of -- in the\nabsence of finding a fact specified by the State, a fact\nchosen by the State as necessary to impose the sentence.\nThe sentencing guidelines strike me as somewhat\ndistinguishable because the range of factors that a judge\nmay choose to depart upwards is -- is by the guidelines\nrelatively unlimited.\nQUESTION: Well, in -- in this case, the\naggravating fact was killing for pecuniary gain.\nMR. HURWITZ: Correct, Justice --\nQUESTION: And that was clearly implicit, if not\nexplicit, in the jury's finding.\nMR. HURWITZ: I -- I would suggest neither in\nthis case, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: They didn't find a robbery?\nMR. HURWITZ: The jury found a robbery, but\nunder Arizona law, as the cases make quite clear, in order\nin a felony murder case for there to be a finding of\npecuniary gain, or in any murder case to be a finding of\npecuniary gain, there must be a showing that the murder\nitself was motivated by a desire for pecuniary gain. And\nthe Arizona Supreme Court has said on three or four\noccasions it is not enough that a murder was committed in\nconnection with a robbery or, indeed, even in connection\nwith a felony murder. The issue is motivation for the\nparticular homicide.\nIn this case, the Arizona Supreme Court said\nexpressly we can't tell from the trial record why the\ndriver was killed. There is virtually no evidence in this\ntrial record as to why the driver was killed. It was on\nthe record made in the post-trial proceedings, the record\nmade on the basis of the accomplice testimony, that the\nArizona Supreme Court concluded that.\nSo, in this case when the Arizona Supreme Court\nsays two things -- one is the issue for pecuniary gain is\nwhether or not there has been proof of the motivation for\nthe murder, and second, in this case we can't tell why the\nperson was murdered -- I would suggest there is neither a\nnecessary, implicit, or even logical finding by the jury\nin this case of -- of pecuniary gain. The Arizona Supreme\nCourt I think addressed that issue quite straightforwardly\nand directly.\nNow, the State suggests that one distinction\nbetween this case and Apprendi is the idea that these\naggravating circumstances are so-called sentencing\nfactors, not elements of the crime. But I think that --\nthat argument was answered in Apprendi.\nWhat this Court said in Apprendi was that the\nreal test is not one of labels. The real test is one of\nfunction. Is this a fact that is necessary under the\nState law to allow the judge to sentence somebody to the\nmaximum sentence provided by law? And plainly it is, and\nwhether you call these aggravating circumstances\nsentencing enhancements or whether you call them elements,\nyou arrive, I would suggest, at the same result. This\ncase on its face is covered by Apprendi.\nOne way to -- one way to -- to get into that\nissue is to -- is to imagine the following circumstance.\nLet's assume that Arizona law, instead of providing\nprecisely what it does now, said instead that the penalty\nfor first degree murder is life without -- is life with\npossibility of parole. But that penalty may be increased\nto life without possibility of parole upon finding of one\nof 10 specific aggravating circumstances, so that we had\nexactly the same statute that we have now, but at the\nfirst level you get life with possibility of parole after\n25 years, and at this next level, you got life without\npossibility of parole. I don't think there could be any\ndoubt, under those circumstances that on its face the rule\nthis Court set forth in Apprendi would apply.\nQUESTION: I think that's true, and I think that\nin the -- in the normal circumstance when a State does\nsomething like that, even if it is not calling it an\nelement of the crime, it is an element of the crime.\nWhat we have here, however, this -- this statute\nwas enacted in -- in what? '73?\nMR. HURWITZ: Initially in '73, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: Which was the year after Furman. And\nwhat Arizona was saying was, you know, we -- we never\nthought we had to have any finding of aggravated --\naggravating factors in order to impose the death penalty,\nbut the Supreme Court, in a decision that -- that had no\n-- no rooting in the common law, said that we cannot\nimpose capital punishment without aggravating\ncircumstances. Okay. We'll make a finding of aggravating\ncircumstances necessary and we'll have that finding made\nby a judge.\nNow, I -- I don't regard that as Arizona\nadopting the aggravating circumstance as an element of the\ncrime, nor does the statute read that way. So, you're --\nyou're talking about something that is unprecedented in --\nin the common law. You're talking about a finding that\nhas been mandated by the Supreme Court and the issue is\nwhether the finding mandated by the Supreme Court has to\nbe made by the jury or -- or the judge. And we've said in\nseveral cases that it's enough if it's made by the judge.\nNow, why isn't --\nMR. HURWITZ: Justice --\nQUESTION: -- why isn't that enough to resolve\nthe case?\nMR. HURWITZ: Justice Scalia, if the -- if the\npoint here is that the State was forced to do this and,\ntherefore, this cannot be an element under the Apprendi\ntest, I would suggest that presents several analytical\nproblems.\nThe first is that this Court has said on any\nnumber of occasions to the States, here is something that\nmust be in your law. The very same term that this Court\ndecided Furman or the year before, it decided Miller, and\nin Miller it said if you want to have a constitutional\nobscenity law, State, you must have a specific definition\nin that State -- in the law of the kind of conduct that\nyou wish to -- to punish, the kind of -- the depiction of\nthe kind of conduct that you wish to punish. We're not\ntelling you, States, by the way, what specific factor you\nhave to have. You decide. Here are some suggestions.\nArizona, the year after Miller was decided,\namended its statutes to add to its obscenity laws a\nspecific requirement with respect to proof of specific\ntypes of sexual conduct. This Court made them do that.\nThe Constitution made them do that. But I do not believe\nit would be suggested that those specific elements of the\ncrime, those specific factors that are necessary to impose\nthe maximum punishment allowed by law, are somehow\nexempted from the Sixth Amendment for that reason.\nQUESTION: No, but in -- in the -- in the\nobscenity field, we didn't invite the kind of procedure\nthat -- that was adopted here by -- by establishing a\nseparate -- a separate category, the -- you know, the --\nthe guilt phase and the penalty phase. We -- we invited\nthe -- the severing of the trial into those -- into those\ntwo portions. And it seems to me it's up to us whether\nthe constitutional requirement that we've imposed upon the\nStates requires a finding by the judge or a finding by the\njury. It's -- it's simply not was simple as to say, well,\nit's an element of the crime and therefore has to be found\nby the jury. It's -- it's rather what does the -- what\ndoes the Constitution, as interpreted by this Court,\ndemand.\nMR. HURWITZ: Justice Scalia, let me -- let me\ncome at that at -- at two levels.\nThe first one is I think the basic\nconstitutional principle that underlies the Sixth\nAmendment. And that principle, as this Court articulated\nin both Jones and Apprendi, is the notion that before\nyou're handed over to the State and before the State is\nallowed to exact the maximum punishment permitted by law,\na jury of your peers is allowed to you to find those facts\nto put the State in that position. Certainly that\nprinciple is directly implicated by the death penalty\nsituation on its face. So, this underlying Sixth\nAmendment principle strikes me as no different.\nWith respect to bifurcation, there is, of\ncourse, no constitutional requirement that the aggravating\ncircumstances be found in a penalty phase of the trial.\nThis Court has made clear on any number of occasions that\nthe aggravating circumstances, these so-called narrowing\ncircumstances, the facts necessary under State law to\nallow the imposition of a death penalty can be found in\nthe so-called guilt phase of the trial.\nQUESTION: But if -- if Apprendi was based on a\nlong common law history, as -- as it certainly seems to\nhave been, wouldn't that distinguish it from the\naggravating/mitigating, which certainly is not based on\ncommon law history at all?\nMR. HURWITZ: Mr. Chief Justice, it strikes me\nthat the common law history here makes the central\nprinciple. The central principle in the common law\nhistory is, after all, the one that Apprendi and Jones\narticulate about the protection of the Sixth Amendment.\nThe procedure faced in Apprendi was not known at the\ncommon law. The procedure of having a specific\naggravating factor that might enhance a sentence was\nunknown to the common law. Yet, this Court in Apprendi\nsaid the basic Sixth Amendment principle that underlies -\nunderlied the adoption of the Sixth Amendment in 1791\nshould apply to this circumstance. I think that's --\nQUESTION: Mr. Hurwitz, may I ask why you have\n-- you have certainly made a case about the aggravating\ncircumstances, but you haven't put, as part of that case,\nthe so-called Enmund/Tison findings. And it seems to me\nthat if in Arizona someone can be put to death only if he\nwas the triggerman, or was a -- what is the other phrase,\na major participant, you haven't made anything of those\nfactors, and I think if -- if the aggravating factor has\nto be found by the jury, then surely those would have to\nbe as well.\nMR. HURWITZ: Justice Ginsburg, that may well be\nthe case. As I think I suggested in response to the Chief\nJustice's initial question, it -- it has struck us that\nthere is a difference between the sort of as-applied\nanalysis that an Enmund/Tison finding requires, a\nproportionality analysis, and the issue of whether the\nState systematically denies with respect to a particular\nfactor that it's picked out, and nothing in this Court's\njurisprudence required the State to adopt any particular\naggravating circumstance.\nWith respect to those particular factors, it\nstrikes us that's at the core of Apprendi. I don't resist\nthe suggestion that perhaps the principle in Apprendi\nextends farther, and it extends to -- to the Enmund/Tison\nfindings. What I do suggest is that -- is that the core\nof Apprendi, the very central holding of the case\nnecessarily extends to facts which the State itself has\nsaid in its statutes are necessary in order to find -- in\norder to allow the maximum punishment to be imposed by\nlaw.\nQUESTION: But -- but the other factor you\nhaven't discussed is the mitigating circumstances.\nMR. HURWITZ: Correct, Justice Kennedy.\nQUESTION: The common law, in defining elements,\ndoesn't usually have some factors on the other side that\n-- that are mitigating. Perhaps -- perhaps you can\nsuggest some examples where they do. But again, this goes\nvery much, it seems to me, to show that this is part of\nour Eighth Amendment protections that have been mandated.\nIn Apprendi, the judge could always, once he or she found\nthe racial animus, enhance the sentence; in fact, had to.\nHere there's still a balancing that has to take place and\n-- and that -- that certainly is -- is not something\nclassically reserved for the function and province of the\njury.\nMR. HURWITZ: And that's -- that's correct,\nJustice Kennedy, and we don't suggest that mitigating\ncircumstances or circumstances that suggest leniency must\nbe found by the jury. It has always been the case that\nonce the judge was empowered to enter the maximum sentence\nallowed by law, that judge could consider whatever factors\nor the State could consider, in -- in whatever form it did\nso, those factors that might provide for a sentence of\nless than the maximum sentence allowed by law.\nQUESTION: What about that kind of argument that\ninitially Justices Stewart and Powell and Stevens have\nmade, that there's a necessary connection between the\ndetermination that death in a case is not cruel and\nunusual and the jury is doing the weighing in order to\nshow that it reflects a community sentiment in that\ncommunity that the death penalty is not cruel and unusual?\nMR. HURWITZ: And, Justice Breyer, had this\nCourt accepted that as -- as a correct statement of the\nEighth Amendment, we obviously wouldn't be here today.\nWe're operating -- we're operating with the constraints of\nthis Court's decisions which have said that kind of jury\nweighing, that kind of jury sentencing is not required\nby --\nQUESTION: Were it up to you, you would make\nthat argument if you felt it was open.\nMR. HURWITZ: If it were open, it's an argument\nwe might make, but it is --\nQUESTION: Well, presumably you would make any\nargument that's open to you.\nMR. HURWITZ: We're open.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HURWITZ: To be sure, Mr. Chief Justice.\nBut -- but my point is it's not an argument we\nneed make in this case. We are not suggesting that jury\nsentencing is required. We are suggesting that jury fact\nfinding is required.\nAnd if I might, let me suggest the difficulties\nof adopting a rule that somehow has one -- one approach if\nsomething was done pre 1972 and another one after. If\nArizona had adopted this very same statute identically\nworded in 1965, when the ALI first suggested it as a\npossibility to the States, it seems to me clear, on the\nbasis of Apprendi, that the aggravating circumstances\nwould be elements, or at least sentencing enhancements, as\nthe Court said, and required to be found by the jury.\nQUESTION: But if it adopted the statute in\n1965, it could have simply had the exact language that it\nhad and said the decision as to whether death or life is\nsimply up to the discretion of the judge, and it would\nhave been perfectly okay.\nMR. HURWITZ: Because Apprendi and Jones had not\nbeen decided at that time, Mr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: And because Furman had not been\ndecided.\nMR. HURWITZ: To be sure. But my point is that\nif this Court -- this Court will enact an unworkable\nsystem if what it does is start looking at State statutes\nand trying to determine whether or not particular factors\nin those statutes arose in response to Furman, before\nFurman, after Furman.\nOne example is suggested in our brief. The\nState of New York in the mid-1960s determined to narrow\nits capital punishment laws and apply them only when the\nvictim was a peace officer. Arizona made that decision in\n1988. Was Arizona's decision in response to a mandate\nfrom this Court, or was Arizona's decision because, as New\nYork, it made a policy decision?\nQUESTION: Arizona has decided to apply its\ncapital punishment only to when the victim was a peace\nofficer?\nMR. HURWITZ: No. That's one of the -- one of\nthe narrowing circumstances in Arizona law. And my -- my\npoint, Mr. Chief Justice, is let's assume two States, one\nof which made that decision in 1965, and another one made\nthat decision in 1988, and it was the only aggravating\ncircumstance that that State had adopted. Would this\nCourt then say, with respect to State number one, the\naggravating --\nQUESTION: But here it's a whole procedure\ndesigned to have express mitigation and -- and aggravation\nto be considered by the same trier of fact and balanced.\nAnd you -- you seem to give again very -- very little\nforce to the mitigation aspect.\nMR. HURWITZ: Justice Kennedy, I don't mean to.\nI think it is entirely appropriate and entirely possible\nfor a State to design that weighing and that mitigation\nissue to a -- to a jury. But this Court has made clear,\nnot only in this context, but in other contexts, that --\nthat a defendant is not entitled to a jury trial to\nestablish mitigation from the maximum sentence that the\nlaw might allow.\nOnce again, I would return, I think, to the\nunderlying Sixth Amendment principle, as this Court stated\nit in Jones and Apprendi. The notion was in 1791 that\nbefore a defendant was put, in effect, into the tender\nmercies of the State to be -- to be subjected to whatever\nsentence the law might allow, first that defendant got the\nright to have a jury of his peers find the facts that were\nnecessary to do so. He did not have the right at that\ntime to have a jury of his peers find whatever facts might\npersuade the sentencer to give him less than the maximum\nallowed by law.\nSo, I would suggest that when you return to the\nunderlying Sixth Amendment principle here, it does provide\na distinction between facts that would call for leniency\nand facts that -- that are necessary under the State's law\nto impose a particular sentence.\nQUESTION: Except that Arizona has designed its\nsystem, and you could design other systems, but it's\ndesigned its system in order to sort out the most culpable\noffenders and it uses this balancing mechanism.\nMR. HURWITZ: Well, I would separate, Justice\nKennedy, the two parts of the death penalty process.\nThere is a sorting at the front end. There is a\nnarrowing that is required in order to determine which\ndefendants among all those convicted of homicide are, in\neffect, the most culpable and can be sentenced to death.\nThere is a second proceeding. The second\nproceeding is the sentencing proceeding. And what this\nCourt has made clear is that with respect to that first\nproceeding, there must be specified facts. That's the\nFurman analysis. And that's the aggravating circumstance\nthat we contend is required under the Constitution to be\nfound by the jury.\nWith respect to the second decision, this Court\nhas made plain on any number of occasions that that can be\nmade a discretionary decision for the judge.\nProportionality measurements are no longer required at\nthat level. What this Court has said, however, is you\njust have to let the defendant have the opportunity at\nthat circumstance to argue for individualized treatment or\nto argue about leniency, to bring the facts pertinent to\nhis case to the attention of the court. So, I would\nsuggest it is at this first stage, this narrowing stage,\nthat the Apprendi principle applies.\nQUESTION: What you're saying is you're not\nentitled to a finding of -- of mitigation. You are\nentitled to a finding of -- of aggravation.\nMR. HURWITZ: Precisely so, Justice Scalia. And\nI -- and I think not only are you not entitled to it, but\n-- but there is nothing in this Court's jurisprudence that\nrequires that the State specify a particular fact in\nmitigation.\nHere we have facts chosen perhaps under the\ncompulsion of the Constitution, but nonetheless chosen by\nthe State as necessary prerequisites to the punishment.\nUnless the Court has other questions, I will\nreserve the balance of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Hurwitz.\nGeneral Napolitano, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JANET NAPOLITANO\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. NAPOLITANO: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nOpposing counsel began with Apprendi, but let me\ntake up on the suggestion by Justice Scalia that this case\nreally begins with Furman because after Furman, the States\nwere left with the mandate that death penalty decisions\ncould not be left unguided under the Eighth Amendment, but\nrequires a standard of judgment.\nSome States imposed mandatory death sentences, a\npractice this Court later found unconstitutional. In\ncontrast, Arizona amended its death penalty statute to\ncomply with Furman by adding a series of factors which the\njudge would take into account in choosing between the\nalternative punishments of life or death.\nIn Walton, this Court fully considered and\nupheld the constitutionality of Arizona's law. The\nquestion now is whether at this late date Apprendi\nrequires you to overrule Walton. And the answer is no.\nApprendi is a Sixth Amendment issue. Furman, Walton, and\nthis case Ring concern the Eighth Amendment.\nIn addition, principles of stare decisis are\nheavily implicated here because, as Chief Justice\nRehnquist mentioned, there have been any number of\nprecedents in this Court that would be implicitly, if not\nexplicitly, overruled should this Court overrule Walton.\nLet me, if I might, turn to two important\ndistinctions between Ring and -- and Apprendi. One is\nsubstantive and one I would call formal.\nThe substantive distinction is this. The\nsentencing statute in Arizona derived from Furman. It was\npassed in 1973. The pecuniary gain aggravating factor was\none of the original aggravating factors in that statute.\nThere was never a -- a suggestion that Arizona was playing\na game, moving something that previously had been an\nelement into the sentencing factor side of the statute.\nThere's never been any suggestion that this was anything\nother than a way to decide which of all first degree\nmurders deserve the death penalty.\nQUESTION: Are we going to have to try to figure\nthat out case by case with -- with respect to every\nState's statute, as Mr. Hurwitz suggested we -- we would\nhave to do?\nMS. NAPOLITANO: Your Honor, I think --\nQUESTION: I mean, what about the New York\nstatute that -- you know, that makes an aggravating\ncircumstance the death of a -- of a peace officer?\nMS. NAPOLITANO: Your Honor, I think what you\nhave to do is just look at what was the underlying first\ndegree murder statute, what is the underlying statute\nwhich gives rise to the possibility of a death penalty.\nIn Arizona, the underlying first degree murder\nstatute has been the same since 1901, and in fact, around\nthe country, most first degree murder statutes can trace\ntheir routes to England in terms of how they are defined,\nthe mens rea, the actus reus, and the causation\nrequirements.\nQUESTION: But you're --\nMS. NAPOLITANO: It's not a difficult process to\ngo through.\nQUESTION: But you're saying -- the implication\nof what you're saying is that any, in effect, departure or\ninnovation in the modern law which doesn't have a clear\nantecedent, at least as of the time of the -- of the\nframing, is exempt -- is a fact exempt from the jury trial\nrequirement. I mean, that's -- that -- we'd have to adopt\nthat rule in order to see it your way.\nMS. NAPOLITANO: No. No, Your Honor, you would\nnot have to adopt such a blanket rule. What I am\nsuggesting is this. In a situation where you have a\nstatutory scheme that quite clearly, plainly, and\nunequivocally derives from this Court's Eighth Amendment\njurisprudence, some of the Sixth Amendment questions that\nwere raised in Apprendi are not implicated. And you can\nmake --\nQUESTION: So, if the State comes up with a new\ncondition, the jury trial guarantee applies. If this\nCourt comes up with it, for whatever reason, it does not\napply.\nMS. NAPOLITANO: Not necessarily, Your Honor.\nAnd it gets you into the discussion of what is the intent\nof the legislature, what does it mean to be an element of\nthe crime in the first place. But under --\nQUESTION: Why -- why does it matter whether\nit's an element or not? I mean, doesn't Apprendi say call\nit an element, call it a factor, we don't care what you\ncall it? If it's a fact necessary, et cetera, it's got to\nbe found by the jury.\nMS. NAPOLITANO: Well, I think in -- in looking\nat McMillan and Jones and Apprendi and that whole line,\nthere has been a question created by this Court as what is\nan element because if it's an element, what this Court has\nsaid is it has to be charged, it has to be proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt, and it has to go to the jury. If it's a\nsentencing factor, if it's -- if that's what's going on,\nthose requirements do not apply.\nQUESTION: Well, let me -- let me go back. I --\nin effect, I sort of put you off track here. You -- you\nwere saying that there isn't a simple distinction on your\ntheory between facts added by a legislature and facts\nrequired by this Court. So, tell me -- tell me why there\nisn't such a distinction as -- as you're arguing it now.\nMS. NAPOLITANO: What we're arguing, Your Honor,\nis that when a fact is found purely for the purpose of\nsentencing -- and -- and recognize the fact here murder\nfor pecuniary gain was never a part of the definition of\nfirst degree murder. First degree murder is the\nintentional killing of another or a felony murder with\ncertain underlying felony predicates. The jury found that\nhere. It was charged here. There was a death notice in\nthe actual indictment.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMS. NAPOLITANO: The jury was death qualified.\nSo, there's no question of surprise here.\nQUESTION: Well, are you -- are you saying then\nthat if a legislature adds a fact -- call it an element if\nyou want -- purely for purposes of determining the\nsentence, that that too would be exempt from the -- the\nguarantee of the jury trial?\nMS. NAPOLITANO: I think it could be exempt\ndepending on the circumstances, yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: But would it be -- I mean, is that\nthe theory that you're arguing?\nMS. NAPOLITANO: Yes that there are --\nQUESTION: I just want to know what you're --\nyou're arguing.\nMS. NAPOLITANO: Yes, Your Honor. I'm sorry.\nThat there are some facts that the legislature is entitled\nto find which don't go to the definition of the crime but\ngo to the punishment. And this Court has never held that\nthere's a Sixth Amendment right to jury sentencing.\nQUESTION: What -- what do you do with the\nbroader principle which we express from time to time that\nthe -- the ultimate point of the jury right in -- in a\ncriminal case is to -- is to place the jury between the\ndefendant and the State? If -- if that's a fair\nstatement, then you're saying, well, only part way between\nthe defendant and the State.\nMS. NAPOLITANO: In the death penalty context,\nYour Honor, this Court has already limited the kind of\noffenses for which the death penalty can even be a\npossibility. So, you don't have the kind of broad ranging\nlegislative discretion that you would in another\ncircumstance. That's why I say you -- you -- in those\nkinds of non-death cases, you may have to do a different\nkind of analysis.\nBut in the unique context of the death penalty\nworld where you have to have either a first degree murder\nor a felony murder -- and if it's a felony murder and you\nhave a non-shooter, you have to make the Enmund/Tison\nfinding, and that has to be made and can be made by the\njudge -- there -- the legislature is not -- they're not\ncharging the death penalty for jaywalking.\nAnd then the question is, all right, is the\nlegislature entitled under the Eighth Amendment or does\nthe legislature under the Eighth Amendment have to channel\ndiscretion? And they do.\nAnd then the question is, does Apprendi somehow\nrequire that that Eighth Amendment jurisprudence be\nconverted into a jury right on this -- on the aggravating\nfactors? And as this Court has said time and time again,\nno, starting with Proffitt v. Florida all the way through\nWalton. Poland v. Arizona is a great example where --\nQUESTION: But -- but your -- your principle, in\nfact, is broader than that because, as I understand it,\nyour principle is that what we have traditionally referred\nto as sentencing factors -- maybe change that to a neutral\nterm, facts that bear solely on sentencing -- they can be\nexcluded from the -- the jury finding guarantee.\nMS. NAPOLITANO: Yes. In the unique context of\nthe death penalty and then it remains for this Court to\ndecide whether you want to broaden it. But the rule\nproposed by the petitioner here would be equally broad\ntaken out of the death penalty context because you could\nhave no fact that enhanced a sentence that didn't first\nhave to be found by a jury.\nAnd in response to a question that was posed\nearlier, that would throw into question the Federal\nSentencing Guidelines and their structure and -- any many\nState sentencing structures where, once you are convicted\nof a particular offense, the State law requires the judge\nto give you a presumptive sentence unless he finds\nadditional facts, in which case he can depart upwards.\nIt's not just the Federal Sentencing Guidelines that use\nthat structure. Many States use that structure. So, if\nyou are to hold that an aggravating factor even in a death\npenalty case has to go to the jury, it is hard to imagine\nwhy that wouldn't extend throughout the sentencing systems\nof the States.\nQUESTION: General Napolitano, how many death\nsentence case are there presently in Arizona that would be\naffected by a reversal here?\nMS. NAPOLITANO: We've had 89 death sentences\nimposed since Walton, and approximately 30 are in some\ntype of direct review. So, it's a substantial number, and\nthat's just in -- in Arizona.\nQUESTION: Maybe Apprendi throws into play some\nof those earlier cases, even if you don't agree with\nApprendi or feel it's quite limited.\nWhat about the other cases I mentioned where\nPowell and -- and Stewart -- Stevens all thought that a\njury should make this determination as part of the Eighth\nAmendment jurisprudence because it's very important that\nthe death penalty be applied only where opinion in that\ncommunity believes that it is consistent with the cruel\nand unusual punishment prohibition?\nMS. NAPOLITANO: Two responses to that, Your\nHonor. One is this Court itself in a later case mentioned\nthat they thought judicial sentencing may, in fact, be a\nbetter way to guarantee against the arbitrary imposition\nof the death penalty.\nQUESTION: The statistics seem to suggest that\nit is absolutely no reason to think that.\nMS. NAPOLITANO: The statistics seem to suggest\nthat there is absolutely no reason to think that jury\nsentencing is any different, that they're a wash. But\nthere hasn't been a lot of literature on this subject.\nAnd --\nQUESTION: Well, yes, but there has -- there was\na long -- you know, Potter Stewart went into all of this.\nMS. NAPOLITANO: Yes.\nQUESTION: Go ahead. I don't want to interrupt\nyou. I'm sorry.\nMS. NAPOLITANO: But --\nQUESTION: I want to hear your answer. Now,\nplease go ahead.\nMS. NAPOLITANO: Well, the jury is involved in\nthis case. The jury is a protector in this case. This\nwas an indicted case, indicted for first degree murder.\nThat went to the grand jury. It was then presented to the\npetit jury. They made the determination about the felony\nmurder. They weighed the evidence. They knew or were on\nnotice that this was a death case. The jury right was\nembraced here, just as it was pre Furman. The only\ndifference is the post-Furman addition of the sentencing\nfactors.\nQUESTION: No. The difference is that the\nindividual juror does not have to take the individual\nresponsibility of saying I as a human being have decided\nthat this person should be sentenced to death. Now,\nthat's quite a difference.\nMS. NAPOLITANO: Your Honor, even under\npetitioner's argument, an addition -- and a -- and a juror\nmay not have to make that decision because even\npetitioner's argument says, we just want them to find a\nfact.\nQUESTION: That's true.\nMS. NAPOLITANO: We still say it's okay for the\njudge --\nQUESTION: I -- I grant you that. That's why --\nMS. NAPOLITANO: So, go ahead and do the\nweighing and so forth.\nQUESTION: I -- I -- you're quite right on that.\nThat's why I want to see what the answer to the full\nargument is on your part.\nMS. NAPOLITANO: Well, the answer is that the\njury here is embraced and is performing the function of\njuries that has come down from colonial times or pre-\ncolonial times. There's nothing different. The jury has\nto find intent to kill. The jury has to find a death.\nThe jury has to find causation. The instructions are the\nsame to the jury.\nQUESTION: But it could make all those findings\nand it would not authorize the death penalty.\nMS. NAPOLITANO: Excuse me?\nQUESTION: It could make all those findings that\nyou just recited, and yet the law of Arizona would not\npermit the imposition of the death penalty.\nMS. NAPOLITANO: The jury verdict at that case,\nunder that part of our statute, would say that the maximum\ndeath penalty is death. But you're right, Justice. It\ncan't be enforced until the judge conducts the second\nsentencing hearing.\nQUESTION: Unless the judge makes an additional\nfinding of fact.\nMS. NAPOLITANO: He must find an aggravating\nfact and then he can find -- weigh those against the\nmitigators and make the determination as to whether death\nis the appropriate punishment.\nBut again, this is part of the process this\nCourt has dictated to the States to determine which of the\nworst murders deserve the worst penalty.\nQUESTION: General Napolitano, the -- the\nexpanded argument that Justice Breyer is -- is suggesting,\nwhich -- which isn't urged by Mr. Hurwitz, is really an\nEighth Amendment argument rather than a Sixth Amendment\nargument, isn't it? That is, the fact that the jury\nshould also be required to do the weighing and to make the\nfinal determination that this person deserves the death\npenalty. That's not a Sixth Amendment argument; it's an\nEighth Amendment.\nMS. NAPOLITANO: I think it could be construed\nas an Eighth Amendment argument, yes, Your Honor.\nAnd -- and as I said at the beginning of my\nargument, this whole situation, this whole statute derives\nfrom Furman and from the Eighth Amendment. It does not\nimplicate the Sixth Amendment or the concerns that were\nexpressed in Apprendi.\nAnd let me, if I might, go to the stare decisis\npart of my argument, because it's not just the cases you\nlisted, Your Honor, that I think would be implicitly\noverruled, but let me give you a list: Proffitt v.\nFlorida, Spaziano, Cabana v. Bullock, which does allow\nthe --\nQUESTION: But do you think it's perfectly clear\n-- you cite a couple of Florida cases -- that if the\nFlorida advisory jury made the findings of fact that would\nbe -- make them -- the defendant eligible for the death\npenalty, that that case would be covered by the decision\nin this case?\nMS. NAPOLITANO: Yes, and I think it's important\nto understand how the Florida system works under Florida\nlaw. What happens is after conviction, the jury hears a\nseparate sentencing proceeding.\nQUESTION: Correct.\nMS. NAPOLITANO: And it comes out with really a\nunitary form, and all that form says is life or death. It\ndoes not specify which aggravating facts the jury may have\nfound or which mitigating facts the jury may have found.\nAnd then the trial judge takes that form --\nQUESTION: But supposing it did just to -- just\nto go with me on the -- on the hypo.\nMS. NAPOLITANO: Okay.\nQUESTION: Supposing, as a part of the\nprocedure, the judge did require the jury to accompany its\nrecommendation with a finding of fact as to the\naggravating circumstance. Would that then be covered by\nthis case?\nMS. NAPOLITANO: I think it would, Your Honor,\nbecause you're still allowing the judge to make the final\ndetermination. And if the judge is able to disagree on\nthe facts --\nQUESTION: But that's the Eighth Amendment\nissue. The judge is making the final determination but\nnot necessarily -- but it would be supported by a jury\nfinding that was sufficient to authorize the death\npenalty.\nMS. NAPOLITANO: In this case, the jury finding\nof first degree felony murder authorized the death\npenalty. The question was, could it be imposed and what\nis the -- what is the way to do --\nQUESTION: It doesn't authorize it without an\nadditional finding by the judge.\nMS. NAPOLITANO: It authorizes the judge to go\nforward and conduct a separate sentencing hearing.\nQUESTION: In some -- in some States, it's my\nunderstanding that the jury simply makes a finding that\nthe aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating\ncircumstances without specifying either. Now, would that\nbe affected, at least by Justice Breyer's argument?\nMS. NAPOLITANO: I think it -- it could\nconceivably. I mean, I -- you know, what we're dealing\nwith here is a very difficult --\nQUESTION: But -- but isn't it clear that the\naggravating circumstances could not outweigh the\nmitigating circumstances unless there were a finding of at\nleast one aggravating circumstance?\nMS. NAPOLITANO: Yes.\nQUESTION: Which in turn --\nMS. NAPOLITANO: But you could have --\nQUESTION: -- would make him eligible for the\ndeath penalty.\nMS. NAPOLITANO: I -- yes, Your Honor, but you\ncould have the situation such as a State like Florida\nwhere the judge doesn't know what aggravating circumstance\nwas found, and you're still --\nQUESTION: Well, he doesn't know which is found,\nbut he knows that one is found. It seems to me if you say\nthat's not enough, then you are making the Stewart Eighth\nAmendment argument, aren't you?\nMS. NAPOLITANO: Yes. And -- and the -- the\nproblem there is if the Eighth -- if an aggravating\ncircumstance is found by a jury and the judge doesn't know\nwhat it is, and the judge still has to go through all of\nthe evidence and do the weighing as to what weight that\naggravating circumstance should find versus the\nmitigating, the basic -- one basic question is, well, what\nis the function of the jury there anyway? What is the\nprotection the Sixth Amendment is providing to a defendant\nthere?\nAnd I would suggest that a defendant such as\nRing and such as a defendant in Florida has already\nreceived all the protections that the Sixth Amendment\nentitles him or her to. And all that is going on here is\na narrowing process where the judge's discretion is\nactually being narrowed in sentencing, not broadened. In\nApprendi, you could actually say the discretion was being\nbroadened, the same as in Jones, but it is being narrowed.\nQUESTION: Yes, but it's narrowed to the extent\nthat he now knows he must make an additional -- one single\nadditional finding of fact in order to put this man to\ndeath, which is -- the jury has not made that finding of\nfact.\nMS. NAPOLITANO: Well, yes, Your Honor, at a --\nat a statutory level in Arizona that is absolutely true.\nQUESTION: That's what your Supreme Court says\nis the case here.\nMS. NAPOLITANO: Yes.\nNow, in -- in the Ring case, there -- there is\nthe issue of the fact that he was convicted of armed\nrobbery and conspiracy to commit armed robbery.\nQUESTION: May I ask if you disagree with your\nopponent's analysis of the pecuniary circumstance issue?\nHe says that there's a difference between armed robbery on\nthe one hand which is for a pecuniary purpose and the\npecuniary motivation in a death case, and that has to be\nthe motivation for the killing itself, is that the robbery\n-- robbery alone would not satisfy that. Do you disagree\nwith that?\nMS. NAPOLITANO: Yes, Your Honor. And I would\ncite the -- this Court to State v. Gretzler which is cited\nin our brief.\nBut on the record before this Court and on\nthe --\nQUESTION: You'd cite State v. Gretzler to the\nCourt.\nMS. NAPOLITANO: Yes. It's in our brief, Your\nHonor. It's an Arizona Supreme Court case.\nBut I would also add that in this case, based on\nthe trial transcript and the sentencing hearing\ntranscript, which are part of the joint appendix before\nthe Court, it's very clear that the reason Mr. Magoch was\nkilled was because he unfortunately was the driver of an\narmored car that Mr. Ring decided to rob.\nQUESTION: I -- I agree when you say sentencing\ntranscript, but what about just the guilt phase\ntranscript? Would you make the same -- the same --\nMS. NAPOLITANO: Yes, I would, Your Honor\nQUESTION: -- draw the same conclusion?\nMS. NAPOLITANO: Yes, Your Honor, and -- and I\nthink that's why the jury convicted him of armed robbery\nand conspiracy to commit armed robbery and rendered a\nunanimous verdict on the felony murder portion even though\nthey didn't render a unanimous verdict on the\npremeditated --\nQUESTION: General Napolitano, will you correct\nme if I'm wrong about this, but I thought that the proof\nat the trial itself didn't even place the defendant at the\nscene of the crime. Certainly he was involved in planning\nit. They -- but they didn't even place him at the scene\nof the crime at the trial. That didn't come up until\nsentencing when the co-defendant testified. So, how could\nthe jury have made the finding that he killed for\npecuniary gain when he wasn't even at the scene?\nMS. NAPOLITANO: Your Honor, it goes to the fact\nthat he was at a minimum a major -- major conspirator in a\nconspiracy that resulted in the death of an armored car\ndriver. The purpose of the conspiracy was to rob the\narmored car. The jury, by finding the armored car\nrobbery, the -- the membership in the conspiracy, and then\nthe sentencing court and then later the Arizona Supreme\nCourt making the Enmund/Tison finding impliedly, if not\nexplicitly, proved the pecuniary gain issue.\nBut if there's any question for this Court on\nthat point, and should you be inclined to overrule Walton,\nwhich you should not, that's a matter that always could be\nremanded back to the State Supreme Court for further\nexplanation.\nQUESTION: Would you tell me how one would\nexplain to a citizen that you can't get 5 years added on\nto your sentence unless the jury makes the critical\nfinding, but you can be put to death with the judge making\nthe critical finding?\nMS. NAPOLITANO: Because, Your Honor, the -- the\ndifference is what is the source of the punishment. Where\ndoes it come from? What is the source of the sentencing\nat issue? And in the prior situation, in a -- in a non-\ndeath penalty case, what the Court has been doing and what\nApprendi does is expand the range of the jury trial. But\nwhat the Court has not done is expand the Eighth Amendment\nprotections that it -- that it incorporated onto the\noriginal elements of first degree murder for death penalty\ncases and say not only are these Eighth Amendment issues,\nnow we're going to even transfer it further and make them\nSixth Amendment issues. And -- and the implications are\nlarge.\nQUESTION: It seems to me that you're making a\nnovel application of the principle we've repeated several\ntimes, that death is different.\nMS. NAPOLITANO: Death is different.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. NAPOLITANO: I mean, there's no doubt about\nit, Your Honor. And -- and your jurisprudence has said\nthat. But, you know, you don't have this kind of\nelaborate sentencing procedure in a non-death case either.\nI mean, this is all driven by -- by Furman and all of\nFurman's progeny to make sure that we are getting the\nright defendants and imposing the right penalty on those\ndefendants. And that's an Eighth Amendment issue and has\nnot been, by this Court, expanded to the Sixth Amendment.\nAnd -- and again, if this Court were to overrule\nWalton and reopen all of the cases in Arizona, at least\nthat are on direct review and in the other States, it's\nhard to imagine how you then would not also have to\noverrule Clemons, Hildwin, Poland, all the cases we've\ncited to the Court before, because they all recognize and\nstate that these cases are different and that there is a\nseparate rule for the judge in these kinds of cases.\nQUESTION: The -- the difference obviously is\nthat, of course, it's different. It's worse, not better.\nSo, the obvious argument is that if you're going to insist\nthat a jury find a fact that could enhance a sentence from\n10 years to 15, surely a jury, when you're under the\nEighth Amendment or the Sixth Amendment, should find the\nfact that could enhance the sentence from life in prison\nto death. I mean, I think that's what it's --\nMS. NAPOLITANO: Well, I think that's --\nQUESTION: -- is the underlying point here.\nMS. NAPOLITANO: I think that's petitioner's\nbasic argument, and -- and our response is it's more\ncomplicated than that. That doesn't really answer the\nquestion because in the death penalty world, the case law\nis different, the tradition is different. This is all a\ncreation of Supreme Court precedent, really not of the\ncommon law as it came down through colonial times. And\nwhat is going on here are additional protections for a\ndefendant, not fewer protections for a defendant.\nAnd remember, in this case, you know, if you\njust took the -- the literal language of Apprendi and --\nand didn't go beneath it, and you took the literal\nlanguage of the Arizona first degree murder statute, the\nmaximum penalty under the statute is death, and the judge\nis simply making a choice between life or death. And the\njury's verdict authorizes the judge to go forward and\nenter into that sentencing proceeding. And that is a\nprocedure that this Court has embraced, upheld, and\nspecifically said does not violate the Sixth Amendment.\nQUESTION: Would you comment on your opponent's\nsuggestion that that would apply to other statutes like\nthe drug statute? The maximum penalty under the same\nstatute is life in prison and so forth, but nevertheless,\nApprendi applies. Or Apprendi itself -- supposing the two\n-- instead of two statutes, there had been one. Would\nthat have made a difference?\nMS. NAPOLITANO: You know, in the statutory\nanalysis that Apprendi suggests, part of that analysis is\nyou have to look at each statute and how it was\nconstructed and so forth. I don't know whether\nautomatically it would apply because, again, as I've made\nthe argument today, the Eighth Amendment death penalty\ncases just are different.\nBut, again, if you overrule Walton, it -- it is\nhard to imagine how any judge would have the authority\nunder the Sixth Amendment to find any kind of fact that\nwould be used to enhance a sentence. And if that's what\nApprendi is supposed to mean, that's a very, very broad\nruling.\nQUESTION: To -- to enhance a sentence beyond\nthat which was otherwise authorized by law by the jury's\nverdict.\nMS. NAPOLITANO: Well, or enhance a sentence\nbeyond the presumptive sentence, because what's the\ndifference between a sentence authorized and a presumptive\nsentence set forth in either guidelines or in legislation?\nWe're cutting very fine hairs here.\nAnd I think the ultimate question is, what is\nthe role of a jury? Was that jury's role embraced by\nArizona? Yes. Did the role of the jury in this case\nchange at any time from what it was pre-Furman to post-\nFurman? No. Did the jury in this case know it was a\ndeath case? Yes. Did the defendant know it was a death\ncase? Yes. Everyone knew it was a death case. There's\nno surprise. There's no adding on at the end, oh, by the\nway, we're going to ask for an additional 10- to 20-year\nenhancement like they did in Apprendi or an additional 10-\nyear enhancement as in Jones. None of that happened.\nThis was a death case from the beginning and it should be\na death case now.\nThank you, Your Honors.\nQUESTION: Thank you, General Napolitano.\nMr. Hurwitz, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW D. HURWITZ\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nQUESTION: Mr. Hurwitz, would you address the\nquestion that General Napolitano made about this is an\nEighth Amendment requirement, not a Sixth Amendment\nrequirement, and that's a huge difference?\nMR. HURWITZ: I -- I will, Justice Ginsburg. It\nseems to me that the State's position is that when a fact\nis required by State law at the policy whim of legislators\nin order to impose the maximum punishment allowed by law,\nthat fact gets Sixth Amendment protection. But when a\nfact is required by the Constitution or by decisions of\nthis Court, that it somehow obtains less Sixth Amendment\nprotection. I would suggest there is no basis in the\njurisprudence of this Court for that kind of conclusion.\nWhat the Attorney General seems to be saying to\nyou today are two things. First, the State doesn't like\nApprendi. Hence, the distinction between facts that we\nadded in order to impose sentences and facts that were\nelements of the crime. But I suggest that problem was\nsolved in Apprendi.\nThe separate question is whether or not, as\nJustice Stevens put it, death is so different as to\nrequire a different rule than in Apprendi. And I would\nsuggest that the purpose of the Sixth Amendment here, the\nprotection of the right to jury trial, applies with no\nless force under a circumstance where the enhanced\nsentence may be from life to death than under a\ncircumstance where the enhanced sentence may be from 10\nyears to 12 years.\nIt may well be true that this Court's Eighth\nAmendment jurisprudence is unique, but in the context of\nthe Sixth Amendment, in the context of the facts necessary\nand specified by State law, in order to allow the maximum\npunishment allowed by law, there should not be an Eighth\nAmendment exception.\nThe State has chosen to make specific facts\nnecessary for the imposition of the ultimate sentence, and\nwhen the State chooses to do so, whether it chooses to do\nso because it merely thinks it's a good idea or it chooses\nto do so because the Constitution of the United States\nrequires it to do so, the same Sixth Amendment principle\nought to obtain. And that Sixth Amendment principle is\nthat you're entitled to have the jury find those facts.\nWith respect to the question Justice Breyer\nasked -- and I think as clarified, it's important to note,\nthe second issue is really an Eighth Amendment issue, and\nthat Eighth Amendment issue is not one that we -- that we\nurge in this case. But even if you don't urge that Eighth\nAmendment issue, the underlying Sixth Amendment issue\nstrikes us as precisely the same. And therefore, you may\nhave a system under which a judge can do this ultimate\nweighing, this ultimate discretionary decision at the\nsecond level of whether this is a particular penalty\nthat's appropriate for this defendant. But the State's\nnarrowing, the State's choosing of factors and putting\nthem in its law and saying to the defendant, this is a\nfact that must be found before you can receive this\nmaximum sentence, is a Sixth Amendment point.\nOne final point. With respect to notice, this\nis plainly not a notice case. I don't believe Apprendi\nwould have come out a single bit differently if, before\nhis trial, Mr. Apprendi was told you're going to be tried\non the firearms charge and at the end of the charge, the\njudge is going to determine whether there's racial\nmotivation and he's going to give you an additional\nsentence. Apprendi was not about notice. This case is\nnot about notice.\nThis case is, however about that central Sixth\nAmendment point, and I would suggest to the Court that try\nas you might, unless you simply say in the end we're going\nto have a different rule for capital punishment, you can't\ndistinguish the issues in this case and the underlying\nSixth Amendment principle from the principles in Apprendi.\nAnd for that reason, we suggest that this case is\ncontrolled by Apprendi and that the sentence of death\nimposed on this petitioner was inappropriate under the\nSixth Amendment.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nHurwitz.\n"
