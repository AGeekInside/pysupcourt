        "content": "(1:00 p.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in number 99-2047. Anthony Palazzolo versus Rhode\nIsland. Mr. Burling.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES S. BURLING\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. BURLING: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please\nthe Court:\nAccording to local land use regulations there\nare two uses to which Mr. Palazzolo's property can be put,\nresidential and a beach club. In 1983 Mr. Palazzolo\napplied to fill all 18 acres of his property which would\nhave made the property suitable for either use. When that\nwas denied, he applied for a lesser scaled-back permit\napplication to fill 11 and a half acres for a beach club.\nQUESTION: Now when you say local regulations\nthat's a zoning authority of the town.\nMR. BURLING: That is correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: What is that zoning authority, the\nzoning board?\nMR. BURLING: That is the Town of Westerly's\nzoning authority, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: All right. I just want to ask a few\nquestions to make sure that we take this case on the\nassumption, and both parties agree on that assumption,\nthat the only development that would be allowed is perhaps\na single residence on the high ground.\nQUESTION: So far as the '83 denial, it seems to\nme that was the skimpiest kind of showing, I don't see any\nzoning authority accepting a proposal to just fill the\nmarsh without any further specified use. I don't really\ncount that very heavily in your favor. So far as the\nbeach club is concerned, that's a bit different. Do you\nread the opinion by Judge Israel and then the opinion by\nJudge Williams and the opinion by the Supreme Court of\nRhode Island as, particularly the latter, as proceeding on\nthe assumption that the one lot with the residence on the\nhigh ground would be the only permitted development? Can\nwe take the case on that assumption.\nMR. BURLING: That is correct, Your Honor. We\nknow from the reasons given by the Coastal Resource\nManagement Council, CRMC, for its denial of the 1985\napplication, that it found that a beach club would not\nserve the compelling public interest standard that the\nCRMC has for approving applications.\nQUESTION: Was it that beach club or any beach\nclub? Because that beach club was just about 11 acres of\npaving with a Port-a-John and a dumpster and a couple\ntrash cans. Is the State going to tell us, oh, well, we\nmight have approved some other use? Are we going to hear\nthat from the State, do you think?\nMR. BURLING: I do not believe they will, Your\nHonor, because they have never made that allegation or\nstatement previously in this case with regard to any kind\nof beach club use being allowed. Now, this beach club,\nwhich by the way was unpaved and did have very minimal\nstructures, Mr. Palazzolo believed that that would have\nless of an environmental impact than having structures\nwith sanitation facilities and things of that nature. We\nknow quite clearly what uses he could and could not do\nwith the property. At trial, for example, it was brought\nout that no residential structures of any kind would meet\nthe public purpose requirement of CRMC.\nQUESTION: I thought that the record showed that\nthe Rhode Island courts concluded that Mr. Palazzolo could\nhave built quote, at least one house on the upland portion\nof the property, the CRMC director testified he might have\nbuilt as many as four, and that the residual property\nwould have had a value of about $157,000 if given as open\nland.\nMR. BURLING: Your Honor, if I may try to\nclarify the record a bit on that, we do readily admit that\nthe State has said that it would gladly allow Mr.\nPalazzolo to apply for one homesite on the small upland\narea on the property, a 40 by 90-foot -- 40 by 80-foot\nturn around, 50 by 80-foot turn around, excuse me, at the\nend of the 1500-foot roadway. That would be allowed.\nThere was some initial testimony at trial regarding other\nwetland uses, excuse me, other upland uses perhaps, but\nlater on at trial that became clear that any other upland\non this property could only be reached by filling wetland\nto access it. And at trial the CRMC executive director\nmade it quite clear that there were no residential\nstructures could meet the compelling public purpose. I\nthink we're going in this case --\nQUESTION: They wouldn't let you build the house\nor not? I thought -- was there testimony at trial that\nyou could have built up to four houses, the CRMC director\nsaid, I don't have the exact words, but I take it he might\nbe able to build as many as four.\nMR. BURLING: And later on in testimony by\nCRMC's biologist show that to reach any other upland on\nthe property wetlands would have to be filled, and that\nwould not be in the public interest. It would not meet\nthe compelling public interest there.\nQUESTION: So there's a finding by them that you\ncouldn't build four? In other words -- what I'm trying to\nget at is, you're saying that the value of the property\nwas reduced to near zero.\nMR. BURLING: To 200,000.\nQUESTION: Some -- or that what you think is\nequivalent to Lucas zero, because it might have been worth\n3 million. We'll have a record here in findings and all\nkinds of argument about what the value of the house would\nhave been, the value of the place would have been, how do\nwe know? What --\nMR. BURLING: I think, Your Honor, the best way\nof telling is looking at the State's opposition to the\npetition for cert where they say in there that they would\ngladly allow Mr. Palazzolo to build a single family home\n--\nQUESTION: Twice in the brief in opposition they\nacknowledge that the CMRC would have approved a single\nhome site, which would have netted greater proceeds i.e.\n$200,000 at less risk, they say that on page four, and\nagain at say, page 19, they say specifically the Council\nwould be happy to have petitioner situate a single home\nthus allowing petitioner to realize $200,000. So I, you\nknow, I thought that was not in the case when we took it.\nMR. BURLING: That is correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: We might not have taken it had I\nthought it was in the case.\nMR. BURLING: Your Honor, I couldn't agree with\nyou more.\nQUESTION: Is it also the case that in order to\nbuild more, whatever the more might be, beach house,\nresidential development, whatnot, there would have to be\nfilling of the wetland; is that correct?\nMR. BURLING: That is absolutely correct, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: Now, what is the significance of the\nfinding, and I think it was in Judge Israel's opinion, but\nI could be wrong about which one it was, that any such\nfilling would have been a nuisance at common law for the\nsimple reason that it would in effect have eliminated the\nuse of the wetland for fin and shellfish breeding and so\non, what's the significance of the nuisance finding?\nMR. BURLING: Judge Williams' decision is the\none that talked about nuisance.\nQUESTION: Williams used nuisance?\nMR. BURLING: Yes, your Honor. And he was\nreferring to the consequences from the 18-acre fill, and\nspecifically if you look at the language of his decision,\nhe talks about the impacts caused by nitrate pollution.\nNitrates come from septic systems, however, as I said\nearlier, Mr. Palazzolo's beach club application would\ninvolve no septic systems --\nQUESTION: Because they were going to have\nportable toilets?\nMR. BURLING: That is correct, your Honor.\nSpecifically to avoid any problems with septic systems or\nnitrates.\nQUESTION: No, but I'm -- I don't want to reduce\nthe case to something silly, but I mean is the takings\nclaim predicated on the right that in measuring the\ntaking, we should measure it on the assumption that he was\nsomehow reasonably bound to be allowed to build a beach\nclub with nothing but portable sanitation, is that in\neffect the kind of baseline for the claim?\nMR. BURLING: Not precisely, Your Honor. The\nbaseline of our claim is that Mr. Palazzolo can make no\nuse whatsoever of any of his wetland. Now, the issue of\n--\nQUESTION: But what is the basis upon which you\nclaim that you have or should have a right to fill the\nwetland.\nMR. BURLING: Traditionally in Rhode Island one\nowning riparian property has always had the right to fill\nthe wetland. Indeed, as our reply brief points out, this\nhas been the law in Rhode Island for a century and a half.\nAs the Supreme Court said below at pages A3 to A4, that as\nof the early 1960s there was not even a permit requirement\nto fill wetland.\nQUESTION: All right, now, let's assume that at\nsome point the State says, well, this is causing damage,\nit's either going to cause pollution because of nitrates\nor it's going to interfere with the fisheries because\nthings breed in the shallow waters and so on, is it your\nposition, in effect, that if the State decides to\nregulate, to prohibit wetland filling, that it therefore\nis engaging in a taking of every piece of wetland that a\nlandowner might otherwise wish to fill?\nMR. BURLING: This would have to be looked at on\na case-by-case basis.\nQUESTION: No, but is that the assumption of\nyour claim here that you used to have a right to fill any\nwetland, and regardless of what the reason for the State\nsaying you no longer can do that, that is a taking.\nMR. BURLING: Not precisely, Your Honor, because\nif the State is able to prove that the particular\napplication before it would cause a nuisance and by\nnuisance talking about a genuine nuisance not something\ndecreed anew, not something that has always been unlawful.\nQUESTION: But, with respect, in other words,\nyou're saying if it could prove the nuisance then there\nwould have been no change from the prior law.\nMR. BURLING: That is correct, Your Honor, if\nyou --\nQUESTION: All right, now let's assume that it\nwould never have been understood to be a nuisance at the\nprior law because nobody ever paid any attention to that\nand they now say, well, we don't want nitrates to go up,\nwe want fish to breed and so on, and that's the reason, is\nthat the predicate for the taking claim?\nMR. BURLING: When talking about what is and\nwhat is not a nuisance, it is important not to simply say\nthat the law of nuisance is coterminus with the police\npower, in this case it's not only that it was not a\nnuisance beforehand, but also that the State has not\nproven that the proposals by Mr. Palazzolo would indeed\nconstitute a nuisance. It is not enough simply to say\nthat we have new knowledge today and it is therefore a\nnuisance, the inquiry must be more searching than that.\nQUESTION: Let me ask you a different question,\nwould it be a predicate for the taking claim for a State\nto pass a statute saying all dwellings, all public\naccommodations must have modern plumbing with septic\nsystems, would that -- and in the past that wasn't\nnecessary, so it naturally reduces the value of the land\nbecause it makes it more difficult, more expensive to\ndevelop. Would that be a predicate for a taking claim?\nMR. BURLING: Probably not, but again, we must\nlook at the individual circumstances of the case. Why are\nthe septic systems being required? If it is to prevent a\ngenuine health and safety risk then I would have to concur\nthat that would be a regulation passed to protect public\nhealth and safety and it may rise to the level of a\nnuisance.\nQUESTION: What I'm getting -- no, I'm sorry.\nAll I'm getting at is, it sounds suspiciously to me as\nthough that, at least, is what was involved or could have\nbeen involved whether it was stated or not when the State\nsaid, no, we're not going to let you build a beach club\nwithout any plumbing. And if the alternative was\npollution by any plumbing system that went in because of\nrunoff from the septic system or a beach club with no\nplumbing at all, and in effect modern outhouses, that\nseems to me a weak basis for a takings claim and if that's\nnot we're concerned with I want you to explain it to me.\nMR. BURLING: The State Supreme Court did not in\nthis case base its decision on the existence of a\nnuisance. Indeed the finding of nuisance was appealed to\nthe State Supreme Court and that could be found at pages\n12 to 14 of Mr. Palazzolo's brief to the State Supreme\nCourt, but the issue was never reached --\nQUESTION: They never reached it.\nMR. BURLING: They never reached it. This case\nis not based on the existence of a nuisance or the lack of\na nuisance.\nQUESTION: Can I ask about the beach club, I\nthought after the beach club application you came up with\nanother application that was just -- just to fill.\nMR. BURLING: No, Your Honor. The beach\napplication was the last application.\nQUESTION: Was the second one. The first was\njust to fill without any specification.\nMR. BURLING: Correct. Correct.\nQUESTION: And that was turned down.\nMR. BURLING: Correct.\nQUESTION: For what reason?\nMR. BURLING: It was turned down because it\nlacked specificity and because of some general concerns\nthat it would impact the environment. But the --\nQUESTION: Specificity in what respect?\nMR. BURLING: The plans needed to have more\ndetail in them, contour lines and things of that nature.\nQUESTION: Well, he didn't say why he wanted to\ndo the fill, did he? He said I want to fill this.\nMR. BURLING: In the application -- in the\napplication, he did not indicate why he wanted to do the\nfill. He wanted to move this on in a multistep process.\nQUESTION: Why does he have to show why he\nwanted to do the fill? I mean the only change was the\nfill, he said I've got a swampland in front of me, I'd\nrather be able to walk on it. Does he have to say he's\ngoing to use it for a beach club?\nMR. BURLING: He does not, and we do not think\nso, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Do you know of any zoning authority\nin the United States that would allow a major filling\nwithout knowing what structure was going to be put on it?\nI mean, I just don't think we -- I don't think we need to\nget in that because I think the Supreme Court of Rhode\nIsland did reach the issues that you wish to present to\nus.\nMR. BURLING: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: I think I have some question, they\ndid say that the owner hasn't sought permission for any\nuse that would involve substantially less filling, but\nhaving left us with that lingering doubt they then rush\ninto the merits.\nMR. BURLING: That is correct, Your Honor. I\ndon't think this case needs to turn on the 18-acre\napplication, indeed it was not even part of the complaint.\nI think the key here is understanding that no filling of\nany wetland would be allowed for any reason that was\nlawful under the local zoning code. No structures of any\nkind would be permitted by Mr. Palazzolo to construct. So\nwe know that he cannot use his wetland. For that reason,\nthere is --\nQUESTION: What portion of his, 18 acres is it?\nWhat portion is wetland and what portion upland?\nMR. BURLING: The 18 acres is all wetland. The\nupland portion is the small road that I referred to\nearlier with the turn around. There may be an isolated\nisland of upland, the amount unspecified how much, but it\nis fairly small, that is surrounded by wetland.\nQUESTION: Small compared to the 18 acres.\nMR. BURLING: And indeed small compared to the\ntotal size of that road and the turn around on that as\nwell.\nQUESTION: Can we assume 20 acres of which 18 is\nwetlands?\nMR. BURLING: The court never concluded that it\nwas 20 acres, and it is probably less than that. But I\ncan not be more specific than that. Since we know what\nuses can and cannot be made with the property, the primary\nquestion that is of concern to us is whether or not the\nexistence of regulations in 1978 when Mr. Palazzolo\nacquired the property is sufficient to deny him the\nability to challenge the, either the application of those\nregulations or challenge the impact of those regulations\nupon him if he contends that that is a regulatory taking.\nWe certainly know that Shore Gardens, Incorporated had,\nfrom 1971 until the time it was dissolved in 1978, the\nright to apply for permits and the right to bring a\ntakings claim if those permits were denied.\nTo suggest that the State can deny a permit and\nrefuse somebody even the right to seek just compensation\nbecause they acquired the property from a predecessor is\ncontrary to what this Court had held earlier in Nollan\nwhich I don't need to repeat the entire cite, except this\nCourt did say briefly, so long as the commission could not\nhave deprived prior owners of the easement without\ncompensating them, the prior owners must be understood to\nhave transferred their full property rights in conveying\nthe lot.\nQUESTION: May I ask one very brief question?\nIn your opinion, when did the taking occur in this case?\nMR. BURLING: The taking occurred in 1986 when\nthe permit was denied. The taking was simply not in\nexistence until that time because as we also pointed out\nin our brief, this Court has held in Preseault that the\nexistence of a permitting requirement in and of itself\ndoes not generally take property. One expects that the\nGovernment in good faith will allow a permit to be granted\nor will at least consider that permit fairly.\nAnd one further expects that in the event that a\npermit is denied, at the time of denial a litigant has the\nright to seek a just compensation remedy if the litigant\ncan prove that there has been a taking.\nQUESTION: Mr. Burling, if rights to land use\npass from owner to owner like that, how far back does the\nchain go? I mean it seems to me that there's no logical\nstopping place until you get back to Roger Williams and\nthe 17th century settlement. So where do we draw the line?\nMR. BURLING: There are two answers to that,\nYour Honor, a theoretical one and a practical one to this\ncase. Theoretically, in defining what background\nprinciples, I would suggest that we go back as far in time\nas before there was an existence of pervasive regulation.\nBut that rather theoretical issue is one that this Court\ndoes not need to fully address because as we pointed out\nin our brief and as I said previously, as of the early\n1960s there was absolutely no requirement for a litigant\nto obtain a permit to fill wetland. We also know in the\ncentury and a half before that that there was a right, not\nonly to fill wetland but to fill tidelands which are those\nlands that are under water all the time.\nQUESTION: Were those rights still extant in\n1985?\nMR. BURLING: That's the key here, Your Honor.\nThe question is --\nQUESTION: So what's your answer? What?\nMR. BURLING: I believe, obviously the answer\nis, yes, those rights still do exist.\nQUESTION: No, no, not still do exist. Did they\nexist in 1985?\nMR. BURLING: Yes, Your Honor. They existed in\n1985 because the imposition of a permitting requirement\nthat was adopted in 1971, as I said earlier, does not\neffect the background principles of property law. It does\nnot change the title. It simply requires a landowner to\ngo through more of a permitting process. It requires a\nlandowner to be more careful about what that landowner is\ntrying to do. But it --\nQUESTION: May I ask the extent to which it\naffects the reasonable investment expectations of someone\nwho buys property with regulations already in existence,\nso that when you buy the property you know to develop this\nit's going to be a tough uphill battle, because I know\nwhat's on the books and I know how they've treated them.\nMR. BURLING: You certainly, when you buy\nproperty and it's subject to regulation, you have the\nexpectations that it's going to be more of a difficulty to\ndevelop that property, but I do not believe that that\naffects the background principles of the very property\nitself, the regulation that you are challenging in a\ntakings case cannot still affect background principles\nthat you have no right to bring that takings challenge in\nthe first place.\nQUESTION: Why doesn't the same argument apply\nto a normal zoning set-back requirement?\nMR. BURLING: It would not, unless you are\narguing that that zoning set-back requirement itself is so\nonerous that it takes property. Now that is normally not\nthe case.\nQUESTION: But that's a different question. The\nultimate question of the taking, it seems to me is\nseparate from the question of what background principles\nare supposed to apply to define how you calculate the\ntaking, and I suppose that if the background principle of\nfilling wetland cannot be tampered with in effect by new\nwetland regulation then the background principle of being\nable to build the property line cannot be tampered with by\na setback requirement. I mean, is that correct, so far as\ncalculating the basis for a taking.\nMR. BURLING: Not precisely, Your Honor, because\nland is always subject nowadays especially to some degree\nof regulation.\nQUESTION: You say not precisely, you would not\nhave any problem with saying that there's a taking if you\nhave a set-back requirement of 900 yards on a lot that is\n901 yards wide. Would that trouble you to say that that's\na taking?\nMR. BURLING: That would be a taking, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: What about a reasonable set-back\nrequirement? Don't build within 10 feet of the property\nline on a lot that may be no wider than 60 feet. That\nwould be a reasonable set-back requirement, wouldn't it?\nMR. BURLING: A reasonable set-back requirement\nis acceptable.\nQUESTION: All right. Why isn't a reasonable\ncoastal zone limitation on filling acceptable? Why does\nthat have to be taken as a per se pull back on preexisting\nproperty rights and as such the baseline for a taking?\nMR. BURLING: The property interest that may be\naffected by a reasonable coastal regulation or a\nreasonable set-back is not necessarily a taking. But when\nit comes to --\nQUESTION: So is there -- why isn't there then a\nquestion here as to whether this set of fill regulations\nis reasonable or unreasonable?\nQUESTION: Could I understand what you're saying\n-- what you mean by the word reasonable? I mean let's\ntake a 60-yard setback, a 60-foot set-back requirement, I\nguess that's reasonable as opposed to 900-yard ones.\nWould that be a taking of a lot that happens to be only 61\nfeet wide?\nMR. BURLING: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And would it be a reasonable set-back\nrequirement, I suppose it would, but you'd still say it\nwould be a taking.\nMR. BURLING: So we better redefine reasonable,\nYour Honor. If the set-back is so much that it destroys\nthe economically viable use of the property, that would be\nunreasonable, that would be a taking.\nQUESTION: So what is reasonable then is going\nto be determined in relation simply to the economics of\nwhat came before and what came after. I don't think you\nwant to take that position.\nMR. BURLING: When we're talking about the\nreasonableness of the set-back, I think the best analysis\nI have seen is one adopted by a lower Pennsylvania Court\nin a case we cited in our reply brief called Machipongo,\nbased on an article by fee in the Chicago law review.\nThat sets a standard that you look at the amount of area\nput in that particular set-back, and if that area is so\nlarge, then that area by itself would be an economically\nviable use of property if you could put it to some use\nregardless of the surrounding property, that might indeed\nbe a taking.\nQUESTION: But would you look to the reasons for\nthe state regulation ?\nMR. BURLING: As with the requirement that you\ndo not commit a nuisance, of course, but simply saying\nthat --\nQUESTION: And do you look to the reasons for\nthe State regulation for anything short of common law\nnuisance. In other words, is common law nuisance then\ngoing to be the baseline?\nMR. BURLING: In Lucas this Court found that\nsomething that has not always been unlawful is a lawful\nuse of the property and that as we -- no, we certainly may\nlearn new things --\nQUESTION: Regardless of what we may in the\nmeantime have learned.\nMR. BURLING: No, Your Honor, in Lucas this\nCourt also said that new knowledge, such as building that\nreactor on the nuclear fault is the new knowledge and to\nprohibit that certainly would not be a taking.\nQUESTION: Mr. Burling, it is not your\nsubmission that those actions by the Government are only\ntakings which are unreasonable? Surely the Government --\nMR. BURLING: That is correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- can make a reasonable taking,\ncan't it?\nMR. BURLING: Government regulates all the time\nthat it's reasonable to --\nQUESTION: Whether it's reasonable has nothing\nat all to do with whether it's a taking, does it?\nMR. BURLING: You are correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Then I guess you're going to have to\ncome up with some other criterion, I fed you the word\nreasonable because I thought that probably was what we\nwere going to end up talking about, but you're going to\nhave to come up with some other criterion for what passes\nmuster and what doesn't pass muster. And you've said to\nus that it's not a purely economic calculation, and you've\nsaid to us that it's not purely a matter of using existing\nnuisance law as a baseline. So if it's not going to be\nsome concept of reasonable regulation that looks to the\nreasons why the Government did it and when it did it, what\nare we going to look at to draw this line which I think\nyou assume has to be drawn.\nMR. BURLING: As quickly as I can say before I\nreserve my time for rebuttal, this case, in determining\nwhether there has actually been a taking here should be\nremanded to the Rhode Island court. The Rhode Island court\nfound that simply some value left was not a taking. So\nwhat the Court must look at is truly not simply whether\nthis falls outside the exceptional circumstance of Lucas\nand say, if it falls out the exceptional circumstance\nthere is no taking. It must look at the before and after\nposition of the property. It must look at the fair market\nvalue, the uses of the property, the aerial extent of the\nproperty that can be used and those other things that an\ninvestor would look at --\nQUESTION: How about the reasons for the\nregulation, should the Court look at that?\nMR. BURLING: If the Court, not in the first\nanalysis, but if the Court is not able to determine that\nthere has been a denial of economically viable use, then\nin a Penn Central analysis which I think is the next place\nthat the Court should look at, certainly the character of\nthe Government regulation is one of those things that this\nCourt said in Penn Central should be looked at.\nQUESTION: (Inaudible) map of this property,\nbecause we talk about this property and the uses to which\nit could be put. I didn't see in the record a map showing\nexactly what Mr. Palazzolo's property was.\nMR. BURLING: I believe, Your Honor, that in the\njoint lodging that there is a map of some sort of the\nproperty at tab 5 and you can see it on tab 6.\nQUESTION: This would solve the problem about\nhow much -- whether there was room, in what they call the\nupland for one house or three or four.\nMR. BURLING: No, Your Honor, those maps are not\nvery precise. What we simply -- on determining how much\nland must be subject to that requirement of how much you\ncan build --\nQUESTION: Are you telling me we have no exact\nmap of the property in question?\nMR. BURLING: There is no map that shows\nprecisely where wetlands are and uplands are, but we will\nrest on the State's assertion in its opposition to the\npetition as Justice Souter pointed out earlier that the\nState would allow one home to be built on the upland area.\nQUESTION: Mr. Burling, you've had a number of\nquestions, I'm going to extend your time by five minutes,\nI'll extend respondent's time by five minutes.\nMR. BURLING: Thank you, Your Honor. I will\nreserve the rest of my time for rebuttal. Thank you.\nQUESTION: General Whitehouse.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SHELDON WHITEHOUSE\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice and may it please the Court:\nI would like to open by addressing two questions\nthat Justice Souter raised. The first is a rather\ntechnical one having to do with the effect on the pond of\nthe nuisance and the cause. And I would refer you, Your\nHonor, in the petition for writ of certiorari to page\nappendix B10 in which the Rhode Island Superior Court\nfound that the 12 percent loss of the total salt marsh\nfiltering in the Winnapaug Pond will have a significant\ndetrimental impact on the existing salt marsh and went on\nfrom there to reach the nuisance conclusion. It did not\nhave to do with the ISDS system and that was based on\ntestimony that was in the record about the fact that there\nare nitrates and things that wash into this pond and the\nwetland itself is the mechanism that filters those\nnitrates out. And so simply the removal and filling of\nthose wetlands per se was the basis --\nQUESTION: The Supreme Court of Rhode Island did\nnot rely on that?\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: They didn't speak to it one\nway or the other, Mr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: Can we take the case on the\nassumption that the only likely permitted use of the\nproperty in question is to build one residence on the\nupland area leaving the 18 or so wetlands area unimproved.\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: I do not believe Justice\nKennedy that that would be consistent with the decisions\nof either the Rhode Island Superior Court, or the Rhode\nIsland Supreme Court, which both indicated that there were\nadditional economically viable uses available and they did\nnot refer to those as the building of a house.\nQUESTION: It seems to me odd then that they\nwould get to the question of a Lucas taking, et cetera.\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: Well, there are three\ncategories of information here. There is the established,\nand what we referenced Your Honor in our memorandum in\nopposition, there was the established, and established in\nthe Superior Court, proposition that at least one house\nworth at least $200,000 can be built. Then there is the\nuncertainty as to what additional upland there is and how\nmany other houses can be built.\nQUESTION: Did you reference that in your brief\nin opposition? I mean that might have made a big\ndifference as to whether we wanted to take this case. Did\nyou make any reference to the fact that there was\nuncertainty as to how much additional use could be made of\nthe property?\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Well, it's too late now.\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: Well --\nQUESTION: Well, you didn't say --\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: Sorry, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: I want the answer to that, that's why\nI read the part that Justice Scalia cited earlier.\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: Yes.\nQUESTION: You do say a portion of the site\nwould have been approved as a single home site.\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: Correct.\nQUESTION: Which is true.\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: Which is true.\nQUESTION: But you don't say whether other\nthings might also have been approved.\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: Correct, because that's the\nuncertainty area.\nQUESTION: But he's right though in saying that,\nin reading it, one might have thought that what we're\ntalking about is it's been established that this could be\nused just for a single home and that's it. And now the\nargument comes back when it's fully argued, well, it maybe\ncould have been up to four homes, maybe they could have\ndone other things, he never applied, et cetera. What are\nwe supposed to do?\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: It has been established\nthat it can be used as at least one single family home,\nand that was what I intended to refer to. And it has not\nbeen established, because of the unripeness problems in\nthis case, what further development might be permissible.\nAnd to get back to the question about Lucas, that's\nsignificant, because the Court addressed the valuelessness\nissue and found that there was substantial value there.\nAnd if Lucas is seen as a pure valuelessness case then\nthat would appear to settle the question. But there's\nalso discussion in Lucas about what Justice Scalia called\nthe deprivation fraction, and that would appear to require\na more complex analysis than was required in Lucas where\nyou had the finding of valuelessness from the court below\nas opposed to the finding from the courts below here of\nvalue. And where that founders --\nQUESTION: Is it -- is it your position, General\nWhitehouse, if someone has, say a section of land, a\nsquare mile, either -- a square mile. And picks out a\n10-acre plot at one edge of that and applies for zoning\nuse and claims that it's denied, he claims to have been\ndenied all economic use. That the fact that he has a\nremaining everything square mile minus 10 acres means that\nthat has to be taken into consideration, too?\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: Yes, I think it is, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: I don't think our cases support that.\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: Well, the most recent -- I\nwould go back to, for instance, at the earliest expression\nthe Penn Central case, which used the term\nparcel-as-a-whole and from which the parcel-as-a-whole\ndiscussion has emerged and then most recently in Justice\nScalia's concurring opinion in the Suitum decision, you\nreferred to the relevant property as the aggregation of\nall the owners property subject to the regulation at least\nthose that are contiguous.\nQUESTION: We don't generally get our law out of\nconcurring opinions.\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: That's correct, Your Honor.\nBut I believe --\nQUESTION: But in the Chief's hypothetical, what\nif he then sells off all except the 10-acre plot and then\nreapplies, and the 10-acre plot is again denied to\ndevelopment, then there's been a taking. It's such a\nsilly result. There is not in the first case, because he\nhasn't yet sold off the rest of the one square mile, but\nif he sells off the rest of the one square mile, and makes\nthe very same application, gets the very same result, then\nthere's been a taking. That seems to me very strange.\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: We always face in these\ntakings cases, the problem of whether it is the regulation\nitself that has effected the taking or whether property\ninterests have been arranged in such a way as to create a\nvaluelessness portion. And I think without knowing more\nabout the facts behind an example like that, it could fall\ninto either category. And I think that's why it's an\nimportant distinction. I'd like to focus a moment on the\nripeness issues that the Rhode Island Supreme Court\nraised. And the first has to do, they found obviously\nthat this case was unripe on two grounds, and the first\nground was that there had been no application for the\n74-unit subdivision. And that to us makes perfect sense\nbecause in the Rhode Island courts, unlike in this Court,\nthe petitioner presented that 74-unit subdivision as a\nproposal and not as a claim of value for determining the\nsize of the taking. And so that is very likely responsive\nto the argument made to that court that this was a\nproposal, and even if it was not responsive to that, I\nwould argue, even if they were asserting a proposition of\nRhode Island ripeness law that we want in Rhode Island to\nhave people when they come and apply for a use or come and\nmake a takings claim for a particular use to have applied\nfor that same use at some point. And in this case --\nQUESTION: Even when they've made it clear we\nare not going to allow you to fill this for anything\nunless the public at large benefits from it. I mean, why\ndo you have to keep coming back, would you approve this,\nno, we will never approve any fill. Oh, would you approve\nthis, no we will never approve any fill. Why does he have\nto keep coming back?\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: The critical word, Your\nHonor, in your question was this, and the question if this\nis the wetland then you're correct. But if this is his\nproperty, then you have to look because ripe -- the\ntakings determination looks at value, you have to look at\nwhat remaining value there is. Somebody can insist on\napplying for apartment buildings, amusement parks,\neverything in the world in a residential development and\nbe told no, over and over and over again. And there can\nstill be value in that property, it's just never been\napplied for. And that's the case here. There is value in\nthis property.\nQUESTION: How do we --\nQUESTION: You mean the part that's not wetland?\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: The part that's not\nwetland, absolutely and the part that is --\nQUESTION: Let me ask you a question about the\ngeography, I've been looking at tab six.\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: Yes.\nQUESTION: Is the uplands -- is the wetlands\nbetween the uplands and the ocean? In other words would a\nperson with a house in the uplands have the same view of\nthe ocean if something were built in the wetlands?\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: Let me start at the ocean.\nYou start at the Atlantic Ocean and you come up the beach,\nand at the top of the beach is Atlantic Avenue. On the\nother side of Atlantic Avenue, the predecessor parcel to\nthis parcel began, and the prior owner Edgemere Realty,\nwho has nothing to do with this case, sold off all the\nlots along Atlantic Avenue, which would be consistent with\nthe pattern of development that the aerial photographs\nshow.\nQUESTION: On both sides of Atlantic Avenue or\njust on the seaward side?\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: They only owned on the\npondward side --\nQUESTION: Pondward.\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: -- and they sold off that\nfirst layer of development that is consistent with the\ndevelopment pattern up and down that area. Then comes SGI,\nand it owns the land behind that on the pondward side, and\nthey make 11 sales, five of which come back, six net\nsales, four of those sales now have houses standing on\nthem. At that point, SGI fails to file its proper papers\nwith the secretary of state's office, the property\ntransfers by operation of law to Mr. Palazzolo and now he\napplies only to fill the remaining wetlands in what is\nreally a third generation remainder of a parcel. And\nthere is no evidence coming out of the administrative\nproceedings because of the way in which the filing was\nmade about where the value is. All of the value testimony\nin this case comes out of the case in the superior court.\nQUESTION: Well, do you think cases like\nWilliamson County and some of the other leave the States\ncompletely free to exact whatever they want in what you\nmight call procedural requirements for zoning.\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: No, I do not think so. I\nthink examples like what the Court saw in Del Monte Dunes\nsuggest that there can be overbearing by state regulators.\nAnd Your Honor, to the extent that there is a sort of\ngeneral rule about prior regulation being a bar, I think\nthat there are some of these cases, neither in Del Monte\nDunes nor in MacDonald that this Court inquire as to the\norder in which the acquisition and the regulation\noccurred. In every other case, you have a prior regulation\nand a subsequent acquisition. And I think the reason is\nbecause they were looking at what the agency was actually\ndoing. Were they obstructing? Were they being a\nnuisance? Was there futility? And there, I think it's a\nseparate question. Does that answer your question?\nQUESTION: Yes, you have answered it.\nQUESTION: Do you think at some point the State\nor the governmental agency has the obligation to come\nforward and say what it will allow?\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: That may be, if you have a\nsituation in which the entire parcel is put before that\nagency, so that it can make a sensible decision. In a\nnutshell, Your Honor, the ripeness problem in this case\nisn't an exhaustion of remedies type ripeness problem, we\ndo not assert that Mr. Palazzolo has left something undone\nprocedurally in this case.\nWe assert that he only put his most heavily\nburdened property into the administrative process and\nthere was and could be no inquiry as to what value there\nwas. And that to us seems a recipe for the prospect of\nmanufacturing takings, if you can isolate the portion of\nyour property that is not valuable or that is not\nbuildable and apply only as to that and not show the\nregulators or discuss with the regulators property that\nyou can perfectly well build on, you put them in an\nimpossible situation.\nQUESTION: Well, what other property? I mean\nproperty in New York, you know, property adjacent? You\nknow some of the theories of, what is it, the denominator\nis in these taking cases, some of those theories, in fact\nurged by your brother in this case, say that the test is\nwhether the area that remains after what has been taken\nhas any, in isolation, valuable use. If you apply that\nkind of a theory, it wouldn't matter whether you applied\nonly for the portion that they've denied the permit on.\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: But in this case the record\nbelow and the findings of the courts is that there is\nvaluable use there and perhaps a good deal of valuable\nuse.\nQUESTION: Not the swampland, not the part he\nwanted to fill. You acknowledge that there is no feasible\neconomic use of the part that is not filled.\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: I would argue that he would\nalmost certainly never be permitted to fill it for\nresidential subdivision purposes.\nQUESTION: And that -- or for any other purpose,\ndo you think, for any other purpose?\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: It would be very, very\nhard.\nQUESTION: Any other purpose that would enable\nany feasible economic use. Well, it's --\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: It would be very, very\nhard. There is testimony, Your Honor, that it's worth\n$7,000 an acre as an amenity value to the existing\nuplands.\nQUESTION: So you're making it essential to your\ncase that in determining the taking, we must look at the\nwhole parcel and cannot restrict ourself to the wetlands\nportion, whose development has been forbidden.\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: Well, I think -- I'm trying\nto make a narrower point, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Okay. I mistook you then.\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: Which is that for ripeness\npurposes, which is what I was intending to be talking\nabout, the parcel that is brought forward to the\nregulators should be the whole parcel so that they can\nmake an assessment of what the value is, and when you\ncan't, you leave the numerator and the denominator\nuncertain.\nQUESTION: But the two questions are the same,\nwhat you need for ripeness depends on what you need to\nfind a taking, and if all you need to find a taking is\nthat the wetlands couldn't be used for anything, then it\ndidn't matter that he applied for nothing but the\nwetlands. I think the two are connected.\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: If the test of a taking is\nthe value that is left in the property after the\napplication of the challenged regulation, then you have to\nknow that value. It is ipso facto always going to be 100\npercent as to the burden part of the parcel. And that's\nprecisely our point here. There's a whole parcel violation\nthat underlies the ripeness problem.\nQUESTION: You have to know the value of the\nproperty.\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: Correct.\nQUESTION: But the question is, what property?\nQUESTION: What property?\nQUESTION: If the property is only the wetlands\nall you have to know is --\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: And we know that it isn't in\nthis case.\nQUESTION: Then you're saying in my hypothesis\nof an entire section of land, a developer fences off 10\nacres, that when he's turned down for 10 acres saying no\nuse at all, that not only is there no, but it's not even\nripe. He has to come back for some proposal for\ndeveloping the rest of the land.\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: Well, ripeness is a\nsomewhat discretionary doctrine, and there may be facts in\nwhich it can become ripe, as this Court did in Lucas, can\nfind and ripen a case in which there hasn't been a formal\napplication made for the use. But in this case the Rhode\nIsland court was presented with a very difficult\nsituation, it was presented with a case in which the\nrecord contained nothing about the value of the property.\nQUESTION: I thought you said a moment ago --\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: From the administrative\nrecord.\nQUESTION: -- that the wetlands had a value of\n$7,000 an acre?\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: But that wasn't\ndeterminable from the administrative record.\nQUESTION: Oh, that's determined from the trial\nrecord?\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: From the trial record.\nQUESTION: Isn't the problem here, I mean we\nprobably would all agree that your first proposition that\nyou may not simply isolate from the parcel, the one\nunusable portion, define that as a separate parcel, call\nit a 100 percent taking and go home free.\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: Correct.\nQUESTION: At the other extreme there's got to\nbe some limit to the parcel that you use for defining\nvalue or somebody with, you know, a hundred square miles\ncan have, in effect, no way of ever proving a taking even\nthough by most of our lights the taking might be extensive\non some portion. And our problem is, how do you define\nparcel? Is there any way to do it. I'm not sure that\nit's raised by this case, but I mean we're getting into\nit, is there any way to do it other than by some reference\nto normal commercial usage in the area. What -- when\npeople, for example, characteristically define -- apply\nfor subdivision regulations -- for subdivision approval,\nwhat is the size of the land that they tend to group as\none parcel and apply for approval for? Don't we have to\nlook to some standard of what is standard commercial usage\nto know how to define, how reasonably to define a parcel?\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: Let me first -- I'm not\nsure that I would agree with your premise, first. If\nsomebody owns a 10,000-acre ranch and they're forbidden\nfrom building in a wetland on the corner of that ranch and\nthey isolate that wetland through a variety of corporate\ndevices and then claim that they've had a taking, I would\nsay that first that is not a taking because the entity's\ninterests should be looked at entirely, certainly as\nJustice --\nQUESTION: I will agree with you. Let's say in\nyour example that they say, well, the appropriate parcel\nis the wetland plus one acre. And the Government says,\nno, it's the wetland plus the remaining 10,000 acres minus\nthe wetland. Perhaps neither of those is acceptable, but\nperhaps we would look to the usage in the area to\ndetermine, you know, what are the -- what's the range of\ndevelopable parcels about which we can assume the\nGovernment was regulating? Maybe in Texas it would be\n10,000 acres, maybe in Manhattan it would be the one acre.\nBut don't we have to look to some criterion of usage to\ndetermine what is a reasonable basis for defining a parcel\nin order to make the calculation?\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: I think that the argument\ncould become so extravagant that you got to the point of\nhaving to define those parcels. But I think the ordinary\ndefinition will come from the chain of title of the\nproperty.\nQUESTION: A parcel is what you thought it was\nreasonable to buy.\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: That's what you got.\nQUESTION: Yeah.\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: And in the long run, I\nmean, this case presents an interesting situation, if all\nof the upland ends up getting sold off by Mr. Palazzolo,\nand now he's left with nothing but his wetlands, now we do\nface that question very directly because there isn't the\nunripeness of the value determination, we're there. And I\nthink in that circumstance because of what the takings\nclause is about, you have to be able to look to the\nhistory of that parcel. We can't have a situation in\nwhich you can whittle your way down to the only thing you\ncan't build on and then claim it as a taking.\nQUESTION: Could you address --\nQUESTION: Everything's been whittled down from\nLord Fairfax, I mean, in Virginia anyway, nobody would be\nable to make a takings claim.\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: I didn't mean.\nQUESTION: That's a very extravagant\nproposition. Of course the property's been --\neverything's been whittled down.\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: I guess what I'm trying to\nsay is that a particular parcel, once defined within a\nsingle owner, if there's a heavily burdened portion of\nthat parcel and then over time it gets whittled down to --\nyou should be able to look back to some point in time,\narguably the owner, at the time that the challenged\nregulation went into effect and define the parcel thusly\n--\nQUESTION: I'm curious on a different issue\nwhich, if we get to it, I'm having trouble with.\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: Yes.\nQUESTION: And that is does a takings claim run\nwith the land? And I'd like to hear what you have to say\nabout that. What I found difficult is both sets of briefs\nhad pretty good arguments and I can see the horribles that\nseem to occur either way. The gas station with the land\ndumped on it, on the one hand, or the people going out and\nbuying old claims at the other. And so I wondered, on\nyour opinion, would it work to say it does run with the\nland but no one can recover more than his investment back\nexpectation, that is to say if somebody goes and buys\ncheap, land with an already existing taking claims, they\nwill not benefit from that because they could not recover\nmore in fairness than what they paid for the land minus\nthe value of the land for all other purposes. Now, I want\nto see if that's a, I mean there's some suggestion of\nthat, but I want to know how to decide that issue just in\ncase we get to it. And it is a very hard issue, in my\nopinion.\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: My argument would be that\nit does not run with the land.\nQUESTION: Period.\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: Period.\nQUESTION: All right. What do you do with the\ngas station where some old map is around and because the\nperson didn't check the title perfectly or didn't know\nwhat to do, lo and behold he wakes up and he discovers 400\ncubic yards of dirt thrown all over his property making it\nunusable and they say oh, three generations back there was\na map filed somewhere that said maybe the city would have\nability to do that. You know what I'm talking about, that\nseemed a very appealing hypothetical.\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: Yeah, yeah. My argument is\nthat you have to look at the timing of the acquisition,\nyou have to look at who owned it, you have to look at the\nState law of whether things are transferable in that kind\nof transfer or not. I'm not saying you can never go back\nand in-house we've been talking about what, you know, what\nwould have happened if Mrs. Suitum had died at the last\nminute. Would her estate not arguably -- it would be fair\nto have a claim under those circumstances.\nQUESTION: Do you know --\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: And I think the best way to\nargue that is under Penn Central. And this was a Lucas\ncase and that's why the court didn't quite get to it.\nQUESTION: May I ask you when, in your -- your\nopponent says the taking occurred in 1986. When, in your\nopinion, did the State prevent the wetlands from being\nfilled? When did the legal obstacle to filling arrive?\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: Really, You Honor, since\ntime immemorial. I have to disagree with my brother's\nassertion that there was a right to fill in Rhode Island.\nQUESTION: When do you think that ended or do\nyou think there never was one?\nGENERAL WHITEHOUSE: Never was one. Never has\nbeen. And the cases that he searched for the alternative\nproposition, Yates versus Milwaukee and the series of\nRhode Island decisions are all cases that involve a harbor\nline. And the way this law works as the Court knows, is\nthat you have no right to fill out, it's the State's\nproperty, and it's subject to the State's control and\nregulation. And one way the State lets you know that you\ncan and gives its assent is by establishing a harbor line.\nAnd when it establishes that harbor line then you can\nbuild out to it. But always, always, always -- there's\none other point, which is that you do have a common law\nright to wharf out or build out into the wetlands as\nagainst your neighbor, as against the rest of the world.\nBut you don't as against the State because the State from\nthe very first day in Rhode Island has owned all of its\nwetlands in fee. And still does to this day.\nThe public trust doctrine is alive and well in\nRhode Island. My time is up.\nQUESTION: Thank you, General Whitehouse. Mr.\nStewart, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING RESPONDENTS\nMR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nAs this Court stated in Armstrong versus United\nStates, the just compensation clause was designed to bar a\ngovernment from forcing some people alone to bear public\nburdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be\nborne by the public as a whole. And petitioner's\nregulatory takings claim necessarily depends upon the\nproposition that he has been unfairly singled out to bear\na disproportionate share of the burdens attendant on the\nprovision of public benefits or the prevention of public\nharms. In our view the record entirely fails to bear out\nthat assertion.\nQUESTION: He's relying on the just compensation\nclause and Armstrong isn't the only case construing the\njust compensation clause.\nMR. STEWART: No, that's correct. And certainly\nthis Court in Lucas made clear that even when there is no\nexercise of eminent domain authority or physical\noccupation of the land there may be a taking if the burden\nimposed by regulatory limitations on land use has the same\npractical effect as a direct appropriation.\nQUESTION: The case is somewhat like Lucas, it\nseems to me, in that other landowners who got there first\nwere left alone and then the wetlands people got into the\nact. Or am I wrong in that construction?\nMR. STEWART: I think that's incorrect. At\nleast, in our view, the record in this case strongly\nsupports the assertion that filling of wetlands has been a\nvery rare practice in this part of Rhode Island. Now it's\ntrue that it wasn't until comparatively recently that\nstatutory permit requirements were imposed as a\nprerequisite to the fill of wetlands. But the record\ndoesn't suggest that extensive filling of wetlands has\noccurred.\nNow, my understanding is that even as to the dry\nland in this area it is only a short distance above the\nwater table, and therefore even to construct a house on\ndry beach land you need fill, but it's not fill of\nwetlands and it doesn't have the same environmental\nconsequences as wetlands fill. And the point we'd like to\nstress is that the requirements imposed most recently by\nthe CRMP and informally by its predecessors are generally\napplicable limitations on the ways in which wetlands\nproperties can be used and they secure a reciprocity of\nadvantage to landowners in the vicinity. So it's easy to\nsay on the one hand that the Coastal Resources Management\nPlan hurts Mr. Palazzolo in one sense, in that it limits\nthe use he can make of the wetlands portion of his\nproperty, but at the same time the fact that those\nprohibitions are imposed on his neighbors as well tends to\nbenefit Mr. Palazzolo insofar as his tract also includes\nan uplands area, because presumably the prevention of\nfilling by neighbors preserves the quality of the\nenvironmental resources in the area, most notably\nWinnapaug Pond and in practical effect the restrictions\nfunction as a sort of density restriction that is --\nQUESTION: How do we know what size of the\nproperty to look at in looking at this takings claim? Can\nwe look just at the wetlands which is what his application\ndealt with?\nMR. STEWART: I don't think we can, Justice\nO'Connor and for one reason, I think --\nQUESTION: Well, why and what principle governs?\nMR. STEWART: I think the short answer is that\nas the case comes to this Court I think the petitioner has\nreally given up any claim that the wetlands portion of the\nproperty constitutes a separate parcel because the third\nquestion presented was --\nQUESTION: It didn't sound like it today.\nMR. STEWART: I agree that the argument has --\nthe point has been raised at oral argument, but the third\nquestion presented in the cert petition was --\nQUESTION: Whether the remaining permissible\nuses of regulated property are economically viable.\nMR. STEWART: Right, merely because the property\nretains a value greater than zero. And the explication in\nthe body of the petition of that third question presented\nmade it clear that Mr. Palazzolo was not claiming the\nwetlands portion are a -- constitute a separate parcel and\nthe value of that is zero. Rather the basis of the\ntakings claim as it came to the Court in the cert petition\nwas that the parcel as a whole had a value of only\n$200,000 and that that value was so small in comparison to\nthe purported 3 million dollar figure as to amount to a\ntotal deprivation of economically beneficial use.\nI think even if the point hadn't been weighed,\nthere would be strong arguments for regarding this all as\na single parcel. It was bought together, it was platted\ntogether, and the State's appraiser testified, and his\ntestimony was credited by the trier of fact, that the\npresence of wetland areas even if they couldn't be\nseparately developed would enhance the value of a home\nconstructed on the uplands area, in the sense that a house\nconstructed on a 20-acre parcel is going to be more\nvaluable than a house constructed on a two-acre plot,\nbecause you have open space, you have a feeling of privacy\nand seclusion. I think it's also important to recognize\nthat the original investment in this property was\nsomething less than $13,000, that is -- I say something\nless because SGI purchased a larger parcel for $13,000 and\npartly in 1959 and partly in 1969 sold portions of it for\nprices that aren't revealed in the record.\nSo if Mr. Palazzolo or his predecessor, SGI, put\nin $13,000 and now has something worth $200,000 he's\nhardly had anything taken from him.\nQUESTION: Well, I really think that's\nirrelevant and that's -- Justice Breyer suggested there\nshould be a cap, that assumes the Government doesn't have\nto be reasonable on an ongoing basis, I think that's just\nwrong.\nMR. STEWART: Well, the other point we would\nmake about the 3 million dollar figure is, it's very\nimportant to realize exactly what the 3 million dollar\nfigure means. Petitioner's appraiser, in arriving at the\n3 million dollar figure, looked at a nearby tract,\npresumably on uplands, and said that lot sold for $125,000\nand he said the lots that could be constructed out of\nwetlands are -- could be made comparable to that. And if\nyou sold 74 of them at $125,000 each, you would come up\nwith a figure of a little over 9 million dollars. He\ndeducted the expenses that he thought would be incurred in\nactually doing the fill and came up with a net of 3\nmillion --\nQUESTION: Mr. Stewart, supposing I bought an\nacre of land out in Tysons Corner for $15,000 in 1959.\nNow it's appraised at a million dollars and the Government\ncomes on and says, well, look, you only paid 15,000 for\nthat, we ought to take that into consideration deciding\nwhether it's been -- what's been taken.\nMR. STEWART: I agree, if Mr. Palazzolo could\never identify a point in time at which the property was\nworth 3 million dollars, then we would have a very\ndifferent case.\nQUESTION: We're not taking it on the assumption\nit's worth 3 million, certainly not the proof because it\nhasn't been proven. But my hypothesis to you is, it is my\nproperty at 1 acre is now appraised at a million dollars.\nMR. STEWART: The point I was making is in your\nhypothetical the land would have actually been valued at 1\nmillion dollars in the real world today. But if you look\nat the methodology that was addressed by Mr. Palazzolo's\nappraiser, he took as his starting point the price that\nwas paid for a comparable lot in 1988. Now obviously that\nprice was paid in an environment where wetlands\ndevelopment in this region is subject to substantial\nrestrictions.\nSo in effect what the appraiser was determining\nwas, if Mr. Palazzolo could develop his property to the\nhilt and everybody else around him remained subject to\nextensive restrictions on development, his property would\ndramatically appreciate in value. Even if we assume that\nthe appraiser was correct in that hypothesis, it can't\nform the basis of a takings claim. Mr. Palazzolo is\nessentially asking to have the benefit that arises as a\nresult of the imposition of development restrictions on\nneighbors without accepting the same development\nrestrictions on his own --\nQUESTION: That just has to do with\nadmissibility of comparable-value testimony. What is your\nposition on the question Justice Breyer asked regarding\nthe rights of successive owners?\nMR. STEWART: I think at least in general our\nposition would be that a person who takes with notice of\nan existing restriction on land use can't show a taking by\nvirtue of the application of that restriction.\nQUESTION: You're going to do that completely\n100 percent, what do you do about the gas station?\nMR. STEWART: I'm not sure that I understood the\n--\nQUESTION: You know, in the briefs they have --\nI don't want to go into it, it's too long. But the person\nsold his gas station, years ago, and at that time there\nwas a map somewhere in city council, and it showed that\nthe highway that went by was subject to some kind of\nsupport, and years later the third owner finds one day his\ngas station is under dirt because they said it's time to\nhave the support. And he wanted to claim that -- if\nyou're not familiar with it -- take my word there could be\nvery unfair things that happen as a result of an absolute\nrule.\nMR. STEWART: And think that the word unfair is\ncrucial here that there could be circumstances --\nQUESTION: That what you replied to Justice\nKennedy by saying that the claim, a valid right takings\nclaim, or a valid takings claim does not run with the\nland, no matter what.\nMR. STEWART: I think I said ordinarily a person\nwho takes with notice of an existing --\nQUESTION: What goes into that ordinarily?\nQUESTION: Think of this, there is a poor little\nwidow woman who owns it and she can't possibly develop it\nor deal with it and she puts it on the market. And\nsomebody comes along and knows the regulation is there but\nsays, look, that regulation is going to have to be applied\nin a reasonable manner, I'm going to pay you X amount for\nthis property and then challenge it. I mean what's the\nmatter with that?\nMR. STEWART: I mean, certainly if the person\ncould challenge it if the nature of the challenge was,\nthis is an unreasonable regulation, it's not lawful. But\nif the challenge was, this is reasonable but it forces me\nto bear a disproportionate share of the burdens and\ntherefore I'm entitled to be compensated, we don't think\nthat there would be any equities --\nQUESTION: Well, the buyer takes it expecting to\nhave to make a Penn Central type takings challenge.\nMR. STEWART: I mean, again, the purpose of the\nregulatory takings doctrine is to identify those\nsituations in which an individual has been --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Stewart.\nMr. Burling, you have seven minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES S. BURLING\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. BURLING: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. A\nfew points to rebut was just said, I think that when we\nlook at what property has been taken and what property has\nnot been taken, we're talking about, are we only going to\nlook at the wetlands or are we only going to look at the\nupland? Our case is submitted on the idea that there are\nmany ways of determining whether or not there has been a\ndenial of economically viable use and whether or not there\nhas been a taking. It may be that in some cases we're\ndealing simply with a large parcel and we're looking at\nthat time devaluation of that parcel. Some cases it may\nbe that we're dealing, as here, with a situation where\nsome of the land is carved out and you're told you can use\nsome of it but the vast majority of that you cannot.\nThe problem of what happened in the court below\nis that they did not go through any sort of realistic\nanalysis of whether or not there's been a taking, simply\nfinding that there was some value left at the end of the\nday therefore it doesn't fit within Lucas is --\nQUESTION: Which part are we talking about?\nBecause the court below, immediately below, said the claim\nwasn't ripe.\nMR. BURLING: Excuse me, Your Honor, I didn't\nhear the first part of your question.\nQUESTION: I thought the decision we were\nreviewing was one that was on ripeness, not that there's\nno claim. The first court, the court of first instance\nsaid this is a nuisance --\nMR. BURLING: There are three independent\ngrounds of the decision below, one ground, of course, is\nthat the case is not ripe and I think we've talked about\nthat, the other that he bought the property on notice of\nthe existence of the regulation, and third the court did\nlook at the fact that there was some value left in finding\nthat the existence of some value took the case outside of\nthe Lucas situation and therefore it did not need to\nconsider further whether or not there had been a denial of\neconomically viable use. So the court below did reach all\nthree of these issues and provide them this independent\ngrounds for the taking below.\nThere was some discussion previously about what\nthe value was and that the administrative agency did not\ndiscuss the value of the case. This, of course, is an\nissue for a trial court and it is what trial courts\ndetermine all the time. Evidence was submitted as to the\nvalue of the property, rebuttal evidence was also\nsubmitted by the State as to the value of the property --\nQUESTION: Mr. Burling, may I ask you a very\nbrief question on the valuing, your third question, the\nvalue greater than zero, does that mean we should just\nassume there's a value greater than zero because the\nuplands has value, or do we assume for the purpose of the\ncase that the wetlands also have value that enhances the\nvalue of the uplands?\nMR. BURLING: Either way, Your Honor, the\n200,000 figure does include a so-called $7,000 per acre\nattribution from the wetlands that cannot be used. I am\nnot sure that that is a legitimate way of looking at the\nvalue of this property. If that remaining wetland\nbelonged to the State, if it had been taken by the State,\nwhich is indeed what we assert here, the value to the\nupland owner would be the same, whether or not title\nallegedly belonged to the owner or not. They're talking\nabout the valley from a nice view. What we are saying is\nthat nice view has been taken by the State. And so the\ntrue value of what the upland is, if you do not add in\nthis attribution is probably significantly less than that,\nindeed in the trial transcript, in the testimony of Thomas\nAndolfo at pages 662 to -- 682 to 683 is where this\n$200,000 value comes from, it talks about a few dollars\nbeing spent to improve the road, and then primarily the\nrest of the value will come from this attribution of the\nremaining area.\nQUESTION: Well, under your view of the case, if\nyou lose because there's $200,000 worth of value and we\nhold that Lucas bars you, then some later purchasers could\njust purchase the 18 or so acres of wetlands and sue.\nMR. BURLING: A later purchaser of those 18\nacres, after attempting to go through the permitting\nprocess, may indeed be able to sue if, as the question\nsaid earlier, this area is within the economically viable\nsize of development in the area. I think that is one way\nof looking at it, we certainly know that there are three\nhome sites on fill in the -- immediately adjacent to Mr.\nPalazzolo's property. Home sites that are very small as\nthe record reflects. And if there are 18 acres of\ndevelopable property on site, then indeed that should be\nlooked at separately. But that is something I do not\nthink this Court needs to fully determine, what -- what\nthe situation would be in that hypothetical, because in\nthis case we know that Mr. Palazzolo can make no use of\nhis wetland, and we know that his -- the value of the\nupland should not be enough to simply take this case out\nof a determination of whether there has been economically\nviable use.\nQUESTION: Why not?\nMR. BURLING: Because in looking at economically\nviable use, an appropriate way of looking at it would be\nwhat would an investor, looking at the property before it\nis regulated, be willing to pay if he knew what that\nproperty was worth at the end of the day.\nQUESTION: Suppose he would pay $200,000?\nMR. BURLING: If an investor would pay $200,000\nfor this property, that is a different case from what has\nbeen alleged below.\nQUESTION: I thought we were agreeing that the\nvalue of the 18 --\nMR. BURLING: Oh, yes.\nQUESTION: The value is 200,000.\nMR. BURLING: And if an investor, knowing that\nbefore the regulations are imposed, that that is all the\nvalue of the property, then indeed there may be a\ndifferent circumstance, that is why this case needs to be\nremanded.\nQUESTION: No, no, I'm trying to figure out,\nLucas versus Penn Central. Why isn't that enough? Take\neverything in your favor, you admit the property is worth\n200,000, and then there's some testimony here that if, if,\nif, if, if, if, if, it might have been sold for 3 million,\nokay, it still has 200,000 left, why isn't that good\nenough? Go to Penn Central if you want some recovery.\nMR. BURLING: Because no reasonable investor\nwould put 3.1 million dollars --\nQUESTION: No, absolutely right. My question is\nwhy isn't $200,000 enough to take it out of the total\ntakings case, reduce value to zero, namely Lucas, and to\nthrow it in the box, legal box marked Penn Central.\nMR. BURLING: Your Honor, we do not believe it\nis enough to take it out of that box. We believe that a\nnonzero value is not in and of itself enough to avoid an\ninquiry under Lucas. Thank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, thank you,\n"
