        "content": "(10:09 a.m.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We'll now hear argument in\nWhitfield against the United States and Hall against the\nUnited States.\nMs. Samek.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SHARON C. SAMEK\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMS. SAMEK: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nCongress enacted 18 U.S.C. 1956(h) for the sole\npurpose of increasing the penalties for money laundering\nconspiracies.\nCongress did not intend to abandon the overt act\nrequirement from money laundering conspiracies and for\ngood reason. The list of specified unlawful activities\nunder 1956 is vast.\nAnytime two or more people conspire or reach an\nagreement to commit a crime that generates economic\nproceeds, invariably the discussion will lead to what\nthey're going to do with the money get -- that gets\ngenerated, how they're going to spend the money, which is\na potential 1957 offense, or how they're going to hide the\nmoney, a potential 1956 offense. The Government would\ncharge these agreements as money laundering conspiracies\nwithout there even being a single overt act to demonstrate\nthat criminal intent had crystallized, that a money\nlaundering conspiracy was really afoot, and that steps\nwere being taken to launder money, oftentimes triggering\nsubstantially higher penalties for the underlying offense,\nand subverting -- subverting the overt act requirement for\nconspiracy to commit the underlying offense.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would you just clarify one\nthing for me? Did they have to prove an overt act in order\nto establish venue?\nMS. SAMEK: Excuse me?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Does the Government have to\nprove an overt act in order to establish venue?\nMS. SAMEK: Our position is that the venue\nprovision in 1956(h) for a money laundering conspiracies\nrequires that they establish an overt act and that venue\nwould lie --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, your -- you say the --\nthe statute requires. I'm just asking if it independently\nof the conspiracy statute -- of the -- the substantive\nstatute itself, how do they establish venue. Do they have\nto prove an overt act just for the purpose of getting a\nvenue established --\nMS. SAMEK: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- as they do --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that the only basis for\nvenue? I mean, I thought the statute provides that's just\none of the bases for venue.\nMS. SAMEK: Our position is that the venue\nprovision in 1956, 1956(i), is the exclusive venue\nprovision for money laundering.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but read it. What does\nit say?\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Are we talking about section\n1956(i)?\nMS. SAMEK: Section 1956(i) is the venue\nprovision.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And doesn't it allow it to be\nbrought where venue would lie if the completed money\nlaundering offense that's the object of the conspiracy has\nbeen accomplished or anywhere an overt act was committed?\nIsn't it an either/or?\nMS. SAMEK: Yes. Our position is that when you\nread the venue --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: So you don't have to read it\nas requiring venue. It's just requiring an overt act. If\nthere is an overt act, then venue will lie, but it also\nwill lie where the completed offense would have occurred.\nMS. SAMEK: Certainly, but where the completed\noffense occurs, there certainly would be overt acts. You\nknow, it's inherent in completing the money laundering\ntransaction that there would be overt acts as part of\nthe financial transaction.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But why would they state it in\nthe alternative if -- why would they state it in the\nalternative if the overt act were always required? That's\nthe --\nMS. SAMEK: I agree that it's -- it's somewhat\nconfusing, Your Honor, but we would submit that the\nGovernment's interpretation of subclause (2) is that if\ntwo people conspired in -- if two people in Florida\nconspired to commit a money laundering offense in\nCalifornia, absent any overt act whatsoever, conspiracy\nwould lay in California.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that doesn't respond to\nthe venue question. Venue, as written in this statute and\nin most statutes, is permissive. It gives you a choice of\nforum. It doesn't limit. In -- in the times when venue\nis exclusive, Congress is explicit in telling you that,\nbut ordinarily a venue provision, as this one, either/or,\nis permissive. It would be extraordinary to make a venue\nprovision exclusive.\nMS. SAMEK: Well, this Court has made venue\nprovisions exclusive in the patent infringement context\nand in the Banking Act precisely using the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, this Court has no\nauthority to make a venue provision either exclusive or\npermissive. Congress decides that.\nMS. SAMEK: And our position is that Congress\nmade this venue provision the exclusive venue provision --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I mean, one can understand\nthat if the venue provision just read, a prosecution may\nbe brought in any -- in -- let's see -- may be brought in\nthe district where venue would lie for the completed -- if\nit just read, venue will lie in any district where an act\nin furtherance of the attempt or conspiracy took place,\nthen we could argue about whether that is the exclusive\nvenue or not.\nBut I don't see how there is even an argument\nthat it's the exclusive venue when you're dealing with a\nprovision which says that a prosecution may be brought in\nthe district where the -- where venue would lie for the\ncompleted offense or in any other district where an act in\nfurtherance took place. How can you possibly read that to\nsay that the exclusive venue is a place where an act in\nfurtherance took place?\nMS. SAMEK: Our position is that those are the\ntwo alternatives for where venue would lie for a\nconspiracy case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, okay, but -- but then --\nthen you acknowledge that the place where an overt act\ntook place is not the exclusive venue.\nMS. SAMEK: Our argument is that the first\nclause of that provision contemplates the existence of an\novert act.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the rule provision\nfor venue, which has not been excluded by the statute?\nThe ordinary provision for venue.\nMS. SAMEK: The ordinary provision for venue\nwould be that venue lies in the district where the crime\noccurs.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMS. SAMEK: That would be -- in the money\nlaundering context, under our interpretation of 1956(h),\nthat would be where the overt act occurs. So it would be\nconsistent with it. Our --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the crime is the\nconspiracy. The overt act may be an additional\nrequirement.\nMS. SAMEK: The overt act is part of -- it's our\nposition that the overt act is required, and there needs\nto be an agreement --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you will -- you will\nconcede that there are many Federal crimes, conspiracy\ncrimes, in which an overt act is not required. The\nShabani case requires you to recognize that.\nMS. SAMEK: Correct. And in those cases where\nall that's required is an agreement, then venue would lie\nwhere the agreement occurs, but in this case, because the\n-- the offense requires an agreement plus an overt act,\nit's our position that that's where venue would lie.\nAs a practical matter, if there is -- if -- if\nthis Court construes 1956(h) as requiring overt act, as a\npractical matter, anytime two people agree to commit a\nmoney laundering conspiracy in one district and commit\novert acts in another district in furtherance of that, it\nwould be highly unlikely that there would not be some\novert act in the district where they agreed to commit the\noffense.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So you're saying that it\ndoesn't mean very much because an overt act wouldn't be\nhard to prove.\nMS. SAMEK: As a --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there are -- I mean, the\ndifference between statutes that say overt act is required\nand those that just say conspiracy -- there are many, many\nsuch statutes, and we dealt with one in Shabani. But of\nall the statutes that include no express overt act\nrequirement, have any of them been read to implicitly\ninclude one, which is the argument you're making that we\nshould adopt here?\nMS. SAMEK: That's correct. And no. There --\nwe have not found any cases where the Court has heretofore\nread an overt act requirement into a conspiracy provision.\nBut this statute is unique. The money\nlaundering statute is unique. If you look at the statute\nand we lay it out -- the statute in total -- in our reply\nbrief, starting at 1a -- the structure of 1956 strongly\nsupports our position that all Congress was doing, when\nthey enacted 1956(h), was increasing the penalty for money\nlaundering conspiracies. As this Court is well aware,\nwhen Congress typically writes a complex statute, the\nstatute begins by setting forth all of the offense\nelements. Here, that would be set forth in (a)(1),\n(a)(2), and (a)(3). The statute then goes on in\nsubsection (b) to set forth the civil penalty provisions.\nSubsection (c) then defines the various terms used in the\nact. Subsection (d) then talks about relationships with\nother laws. Subsection (e) identifies those Federal\nagencies that can investigate money laundering offenses.\nSubsection (f) talks about circumstances under which there\nwould be extraterritorial jurisdiction. Subsection (g)\nthen talks about recording -- reporting requirements, and\nthen you get to subsection (h), which we say, when you\nread the statute as a whole, clearly intends simply that\nthe penalty for money laundering conspiracies would be\nincreased to the same penalties as those prescribed for\nthe offense provision.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Except that there are other\nstatutes that -- that read this way, which we have held to\n-- to create the conspiracy offense, as well as impose the\npenalty for it.\nMS. SAMEK: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it -- it could do that.\nAny person who conspires to commit any offense defined in\nthis section shall be subject to the same penalties as\nthose prescribed for the offense. And that could be\ndeemed to create the conspiracy offense and prescribe the\npenalty for it.\nMS. SAMEK: It could be construed as a\nfreestanding offense provision --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And there are other such\nprovisions, aren't there?\nMS. SAMEK: There are not any other offense --\nconspiracy provisions that this Court has interpreted that\nhad the same structural ambiguity as 1956(h).\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, Shabani comes pretty\nclose, doesn't it?\nMS. SAMEK: Shabani is a separate, distinct\nstatute. 846 was a separate, distinct, discrete offense\nstatute.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- like this it seems to me\ncontains no express requirement of an overt act, and we've\nsaid, indeed, none is required and that at common law it\nwasn't required.\nMS. SAMEK: That's true.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: So why would we read it in\nhere?\nMS. SAMEK: Because text -- as this Court has\nsaid on multiple occasions, in order to understand what\nthe words mean in a statute, you have to look at context.\nSo you have to look at where the provision is placed and\nwhat Congress meant by that provision and look at the\nstatute as a whole.\nIf anyone -- if we look --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If you look at this statute\nas a whole, you don't find the overt act requirement in\nit anywhere, do you?\nMS. SAMEK: You don't find the overt act\nexplicitly in the statute.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And the fact that you\ndescribed it as a long, detailed statute it seems to me\ncuts against you.\nMS. SAMEK: No, because our position is that\nplacing it in subsection (h) evidences that Congress'\nintent and sole focus when they enacted this was the\npurpose of increasing the penalty for money laundering.\nThe --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let's get --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And they were making it\nunnecessary to rely on the general conspiracy statute in\n18-371 or whatever it was.\nMS. SAMEK: It's our position that they're\nincorporating the overt act requirement, the act in\nfurtherance requirement, from 371 as evidenced by the\nlegislative history.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If that's so -- if that's so,\nthen why does the venue provision which you were just\nalluding to earlier read, except as provided in paragraph\n(2), a prosecution for an offense under this section. An\noffense under this section or section 1957 may be brought\nin -- and then it says -- (2) a prosecution for an attempt\nor a conspiracy offense under this section. Not under\nsection 371, but a prosecution for an attempt or a\nconspiracy offense under this section.\nMS. SAMEK: And it would be an offense under\nthis section because certainly the jury would need to find\nthat the object of the conspiracy was money laundering.\nSo it would be an offense in that respect.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I think that language\nreally cuts very hard against you. A conspiracy offense\nunder this section. It -- it is reading as though that's\nthe section that defines the offense, not just the section\nthat provides the penalty.\nMS. SAMEK: I can see how you would read it that\nway, Your Honor, but the offense --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Only because I'm a reasonable\nman.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. SAMEK: The offense provisions set forth in\n1956 are clearly set out and enumerated in subsection\n(a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3).\nIn 1988 -- when the statute was originally\nenacted, (a)(1) and (a)(2) set forth the offense\nprovisions. When the statute was amended in 1988 and\nCongress intended to create another offense provision,\nthey set forth (a)(1) -- the third sting provision which\nis (a)(1)(iii). If Congress intended to create an offense\nprovision when they enacted 1956(h), they would have set\nit forth as (a)(1)(iv), or alternatively, they would have\nadded or conspires to each of the predecessor offenses.\nNotably, the offense provision at issue here\ndoes not include attempts, which 846 did, and which the\noverwhelming majority of conspiracy subsections include --\nattempts are included with offenses. The fact that\nCongress did not include attempts in this provision again\nreflects the fact that they were solely focused on 371, a\nconspiracy offense, and all they were trying to do was\nincrease the penalty.\nThe placement of the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then you would expect at\nleast a cross reference to 371 for defining the\nconspiracy, but there's nothing here.\nMS. SAMEK: That's true, and it clearly would --\nit certainly would be clearer had they done so. But if\nyou take the language originally, this provision was\nproposed by Representative Annunzio to be an amendment to\n371, and we lay out in our -- in the blue brief at page 12\nwhat that amendment would have looked like, virtually\nidentical language to 1956(h).\nCertainly if you read it in subsection 371 -- if\nyou take the identical language and put it in section 371,\nthere wouldn't be much of an argument, we would submit,\nthat Congress surely intended to include the overt act,\nact in furtherance language and they were just talking\nabout increasing the penalty for money laundering. That\nmakes our point that you look at the language, and\ndepending on where it's placed in a statute, it can have\ndifferent meanings.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You have given a few examples\nof a word may mean different things in different contexts,\nbut you haven't given any example -- and I don't know that\nthere is one -- where the entire string of words is\nidentical in two statutes, both dealing with conspiracies,\nand you read an overt act requirement into one and not the\nother. I mean, you have a much harder argument to make\nwhen you're talking about an entire provision where the\nwording is almost identical than when you're talking about\none word used in different contexts.\nMS. SAMEK: That's true, Your Honor, but as this\nCourt said in Shabani, absent contrary indications, the\nCourt will presume that Congress intends to incorporate\nthe common law concept of the terms that it uses. In\nShabani, the defendant did not argue any contrary\nindications. They argued that at common law conspiracy\nrequired the commission of an overt act. That is not our\nposition.\nBut our position is that here there are contrary\nindications, and because the statute is ambiguous based on\nthe placement and structure of 1956(h), you have to look\nto see if there are other indications. And clearly in the\nlegislative history --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but there's nothing in\nthe text of the statute that's ambiguous, is there?\nMS. SAMEK: No, but that is not dispositive\nbecause the placement the Congress has said -- I mean,\nthis Court has said on multiple occasions that you need to\nread a statute as a whole, and when you look at the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But if you read it as a whole,\nyou can't find any ambiguity.\nMS. SAMEK: I think you can find ambiguity, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In the text of the statute?\nMS. SAMEK: In the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Reading the whole text.\nMS. SAMEK: Reading the whole text of the\nstatute, it looks to me it reads that the offenses are set\noff -- set forth at the beginning, followed by the civil\npenalties, then procedural aspects, including this penalty\nprovision for increasing conspiracies.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: None of which mentions an\novert act.\nMS. SAMEK: No, it doesn't mention an overt act,\nbut --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So I don't find anything\nambiguous in what you describe.\nMS. SAMEK: Well, we believe that 1956(h)\nclearly reflects Congress' intent to solely increase the\npenalty.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Perhaps that's all they\nthought of, but maybe they did a little more than they\nthought they were doing.\nMS. SAMEK: Well, if Congress inadvertently\nomitted the overt act requirement, this Court has on prior\noccasions read into congressional silence terms,\ndefinitions that Congress may have inadvertently left out.\nSo in United States v. Taylor, for example, the question\nwas whether or not Congress intended to revert back to the\ncommon law definition of burglary in the Career Criminals\nAmendment Act, and in 1984, the Career Criminals Amendment\nAct had language that talked about a generic burglary,\nbreaking and entering into a dwelling. In 1986, when they\namended the act, they removed that language.\nThe question before the Court then came up what\ndoes -- you know, what does burglary mean. Congress had\nomitted those words, but the Court found that that wasn't\nCongress' intent. They clearly didn't intend to revert\nback to the common law, and it was probably an error of\ndrafting and this Court found that generic burglary was\nthe standard. So this Court has done that before.\nIn the -- in the Perrin case, United States v.\nPerrin, the same thing. There -- words were missing from\nthe statute and the Court did not find that in Perrin --\nit was a bribery case, and what was at issue was whether\nor not the -- the statute covered bribery of private\npersons or only the common law definition where it would\nonly incorporate bribery of public -- public persons,\npublic officials. And the Court said even though there\nare other statutes that have private person language in\nit, similar to this case, even though there are other\nstatutes that have overt act requirements in it, we are\nnot going to assume that Congress intended to revert back\nto the common law and interpret bribery as only applying\nto public officials.\nSo this Court can look at the legislative\nhistory. The purpose is clear. The Government admits\nthat the purpose of the act was to increase the penalty.\nPrior to 1956(h), money laundering conspiracies were\nprosecuted pursuant to 371, which required the commission\nof an overt act. Congress clearly intended to increase\nthe penalty from 5 years to a potential 10 or 20 years,\nbased on what the object of the conspiracy was. The\nlegislative history all reflects that fact, and the\nGovernment admits that.\nThe -- as contrasted with 846, which -- in which\nthe public law described 846 in a section labeled offenses\nand provision in the money laundering context, the public\nlaw described 1956(h) as a penalty to increase the -- as a\nmoney laundering conspiracy for increasing the penalty.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can I -- can I ask what you\nmake of subsection (d) of -- of this provision which says\nthat violations of this section may be investigated by\nsuch components of the Department of Justice as the\nAttorney General may direct and by such components of the\nDepartment of the Treasury as the Secretary of the\nTreasury may direct, as appropriate, and with respect to\noffenses over which the Postal Service has jurisdiction,\nby the Postal Service?\nApparently there was some turf war going on as\nto who had jurisdiction over these offenses and -- and\nthis was meant to -- to solve the turf war, but it reads\nviolations of this section.\nNow, does that allocation of authority among\nJustice and Treasury and the Postal Service not apply to\nthe conspiracy offenses under section 371? Because that's\nnot a violation of this section.\nMS. SAMEK: I'm not sure I understand your\npoint. I would think that if it's a conspiracy to commit\n-- if the specified unlawful activity is one of the postal\noffenses or one of the customs offenses, both of which\ncarry --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The offense is never completed.\nthere's nothing -- nothing occurs except a conspiracy, and\nyou're telling us a conspiracy is not a violation of this\nsection. This section sets forth the penalty -- that's\nyour argument -- but it does not establish the offense.\nThe offense is established by 371. If that's the case,\nthis allocation of responsibility among the various\ndivisions of the Government doesn't apply to conspiracy\nprosecutions, which would make no sense at all.\nMS. SAMEK: It's our position that when Congress\nenacted this, they were trying to enact a penalty-\nenhancing statute. 1956(h) then incorporates or impliedly\nrecognizes the overt act requirement from 371. Congress\nwas not intending to change the way money laundering\nconspiracies were prosecuted. They would have done so\nunder 371, requiring the act in furtherance, and a jury or\na judge would find that money laundering was the object of\nthe conspiracy. That's how Congress envisioned this act\nas -- as being applied, and so I would assume Congress\nwould envision that if it was a conspiracy to violate one\nof the postal offenses, that the postal authority would\nhave had authority to investigate that offense.\nInteresting --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What do you -- excuse me. What\n-- what do you make of -- of this argument? Let's start\nwith the premise that Congress wasn't thinking about overt\nacts at all. Start with the premise that you argue from\nthat what Congress was concerned with here was primarily\npenalty. However, Congress did this in a context in which\nthere are two recognized kinds of statutes, two recognized\nkinds of -- of conspiracy formulations. And if one has\nthe magic words in it referring to an overt act, you got\nto prove an overt act. In the other variety, there's no\nreference to overt acts, and as a general rule, you don't\nhave to prove overt acts.\nWhy isn't it a sensible interpretive rule to\nsay, look, when there are recognized models and Congress,\nin fact, chooses one rather than another, we're not going\nto get into the question of did Congress really mean to\nmake a change when it picked one model rather than the\nother? It simply picked one model, and the -- the\nclearest way to have a coherent system of conspiracy law\nis to apply the model. If it didn't talk about overt act,\nthere's no overt act requirement. Why isn't that a\nsensible way to -- to work our way through these thickets?\nMS. SAMEK: I -- I think that would be a\nsensible way to work your way through thickets of statutes\nthat were enacted after Shabani when this Court created\nthat formulary.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But Shabani rested on -- on the\nexistence of these prior models. Shabani didn't create\nthem.\nMS. SAMEK: That's correct, but there is nothing\nin the legislative history to suggest that Nash and\nSinger, the cases that Shabani relied on, were ever\ndiscussed or contemplated by Congress. If Congress was\ngoing to make such a fundamental change in how they were\ngoing to prosecute money laundering conspiracies, they\nwould have said so. We're not talking about a backdrop of\nnot requiring an overt act and should Congress read an\novert act into Congress' silence.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There are about -- there are\nover 50, I think, in title 18 alone conspiracy provisions\nwith no overt act requirement, no explicit overt act\nrequirement. The -- the argument you're making, I\nsuppose, would require this Court to go by -- one by one\nthrough those 50-odd statutes, and there would be contests\nof every one because the absence of those words is not\ndispositive, as you see it. So you would be generating a\ncontroversy about 50-odd statutes that would be gone, that\njust wouldn't be there if you agreed with Justice Souter's\napproach.\nMS. SAMEK: Well, we don't -- we don't believe\nthat's the case because if you look at all of those\nsubsections in title 18, none of them have the structural\nambiguity that 1956(h) has, combined with a venue\nprovision --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Have you looked at all 59, I\nthink --\nMS. SAMEK: The --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and assured yourself on\nthat?\nMS. SAMEK: I've -- I've looked through the\nentire statute, and I have not found -- title 18. I have\nnot found any that have both an anomaly, a structural\nanomaly, and a venue provision that turns on the existence\nof an overt act.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, we've already dealt\nwith venue where I think your argument is exceedingly weak\nsince the statute phrases it as a permissive not a\nrequirement.\nMS. SAMEK: Well, first of all, we would submit,\njust briefly on -- on the venue point, if Congress wanted\nthis to be a permissive venue provision, they could have\nsaid venue would lie where and in the circumstances or as\notherwise required by statute, in which case they could\nhave shown that they were applying to other statutory\nbases for venue, as well as what Congress was establishing\nhere. They didn't do that.\nThe venue provision was enacted in response to\nthis Court's decision in Cabrales, which dealt with the\nmoney laundering -- the substantive offense of money\nlaundering, and this Court's suggestion that money\nlaundering could be considered a continuing violation for\npurposes of 18 U.S.C. 3237, the continuing offense venue\nprovision. If all Congress was doing was codifying that\nprinciple and trying to address the issue in Cabrales,\nthey would have just dealt with substantive money\nlaundering in the venue provision. They would not have\nalso included a provision in the venue section dealing\nwith conspiracy. The fact that they did and the fact that\nthey used language that this Court has previously found\nto --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It gave -- it gave the\nprosecutor more choices of where to bring suit.\nMS. SAMEK: We say those are the only choices on\nwhere to bring suit. But --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you want to reserve any\ntime?\nMS. SAMEK: Oh, yes. I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Marcus.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN L. MARCUS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. MARCUS: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThe money laundering conspiracy statute does not\nrequire proof of an overt act for three reasons. First,\nthe text of the statute contains no such requirement.\nSecond, the statute is modeled on the drug conspiracy\nstatute which this Court unanimously held in the Shabani\ncase does not require proof of an overt act. Third, the\nstatute was enacted against the background rule of\nstatutory construction that -- that a conspiracy\nprovision, whose text conditions liability on the act of\nconspiring only, will be construed to follow the common\nlaw, where proof of an overt act was not required for\nconviction.\nThis Court should adhere to its bright line rule\nin this case because it provides clear guidance to\nCongress and to the lower courts.\nPetitioners seek to avoid application of the\nbright line rule on a variety of grounds, none of which\nhas -- none of which has merit. I will address a few of\nthose grounds here.\nFirst, the money laundering conspiracy statute,\nsection 1956(h), is not a penalty provision for the\ngeneral conspiracy statute, section 371. Section 1956(h)\ndoes not contain any reference to section 371, and\npetitioners are unable to cite any provision in the United\nStates Code that provides a penalty for an offense defined\nelsewhere, without also referencing where that offense is\ndefined. Under petitioners' theory, if section 371 were\nrepealed tomorrow, section 1956(h) would also no longer be\nvalid. But there is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If -- if 371 were repealed,\nwould it affect the actual practice in the Justice\nDepartment? I -- I think I recall reading in the briefs\nfor the other side that -- that the -- the United States\nhas continued to charge conspiracies in money laundering\ncases under 371. Is that correct?\nMR. MARCUS: Well, my understanding is on -- on\noccasion that is done in a multi-object conspiracy case.\nWhere there are several objects to the conspiracy\nsometimes for purpose of simplification, the Government\nwill just -- will charge a 371 --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But not in exclusively\nlaundering cases.\nMR. MARCUS: Generally, no. There might be --\nthere might be an occasional example where it may have\nbeen an oversight where a prosecutor may have overlooked\nsection 1956(h), maybe soon after 1956(h) was enacted, but\ngenerally speaking no. The money laundering conspiracy\nprosecutions were done under 1956(h).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: When -- when you say when there\nare multiple objects, you're not getting the money --\nmoney laundering just under 371. You'd surely charge both\nunder 371 and under -- under -- what is it? 1956.\nMR. MARCUS: That's correct, Justice Scalia.\nYou could. You could prosecute -- you could prosecute\nthem as -- as separate offenses, but sometimes the\nGovernment for -- just for purpose of simplification will\njust charge one -- one agreement with multiple objects,\nand one of those objects might be a money laundering\nobject.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If it were just money\nlaundering, could you charge under 371?\nMR. MARCUS: Yes, you could charge under 371.\nThere's nothing that prevents the Government from doing\nso. This Court has -- has held before, for example, in\nthe Batchelder case that there can be multiple provisions\nthat essentially cover the same conduct, and the\nGovernment has discretion to choose which one to use.\nGenerally speaking, the money laundering conspiracy\nstatute contains higher penalties. So the practice today\nis -- is to prosecute those offenses under section\n1956(h).\nAnother -- another reading there -- another\nreason they're reading that it's a penalty provision\nshould be rejected is that Congress modeled section\n1956(h) on the drug conspiracy statute that's virtually\nidentically worded to section 1956(h), and no one disputes\nthat the drug conspiracy statute establishes a\nfreestanding criminal offense.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This is 846.\nMR. MARCUS: 846, yes, in title 21.\nPetitioners also argue that because prior to\nenactment of section 1956(h), the Government had to\nprosecute money laundering conspiracies for 6 years under\nsection 371, that this Court should presume that Congress\nintended to perpetuate the overt act requirement of\nsection 371 into the money laundering conspiracy offense.\nBut this Court looks, first, to the text of the\nstatute to discern Congress' intent, and had Congress\nwanted to perpetuate section 371's overt act requirement,\nit could have easily modeled the text of section 1956(h)\non the language from 371 or on the language from any of\nthe other numerous conspiracy provisions in the code that\ncontained express overt act requirements.\nCongress chose a different model, the drug\nconspiracy statute, which as I said before, this Court\nheld in Shabani does not contain an overt act requirement.\nBy choosing that model, Congress manifested its intent not\nto require proof of an overt act because at the time it --\nbecause at the time it acted, the background rule of\nstatutory construction provided that a conspiracy statute\nthat conditions liability solely on the act of conspiring\nwould be construed to follow the common law.\nPetitioners point to silence in the legislative\nhistory, but the silence in the legislative history on the\novert act requirement is not the kind of compelling\nevidence of -- of contrary intent that would justify\ndeparting from the text of the statute and this Court's\nbright line rule.\nFinally, petitioners rely on a venue provision\nfor money laundering cases, section 1956(i), which was\nenacted 9 years after the money laundering conspiracy\nstatute at issue here. That venue provision reflects\nCongress' intent to identify a variety of districts in\nwhich money laundering cases can be brought. It does not\nreflect an intent to redefine the -- the elements of the\nsubstantive money laundering conspiracy offense.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What do you make of the -- the\nargument that I think occurs in the yellow brief, that --\nthe reference to any other district where an act in\nfurtherance, et cetera, took place implies that in the\nclause preceding, they were referring to a district in\nwhich an act in furtherance took place?\nMR. MARCUS: Justice Souter, I think what --\nwhat that terminology was -- was referring to was\ndistrict. The other is meant to modify district. In\nother words, the first -- the first clause there provides\na venue where the case can be brought. And if it's not\nbrought in that -- if it doesn't fall within that venue,\nthen you can bring it in -- in a different district, an\nother district. I think that's the -- the best way to\nread the -- the statute. I mean, otherwise, it could have\n-- as it was pointed out during petitioners' argument,\notherwise they could have just had one. They wouldn't\nneed separate clauses. They could have just had one\nclause that said, and the case -- the conspiracy case can\nbe brought in any district where an overt act was\ncommitted.\nPetitioners seize on the fact that the venue\nprovision permits venue to be laid in any district in\nwhich an overt act was committed. But the rule in\nconspiracy cases has always been that an overt -- that\nvenue can be laid where an overt act was committed\nregardless of whether an overt act was an element of the\noffense. At common law, as I said before, conspiracies --\na conspiracy conviction did not rely -- depend on proof of\nan overt act, and yet venue could always be laid at common\nlaw where an overt act was committed.\nThe common law venue rule has been applied\nconsistently to modern Federal conspiracy statutes, such\nas the drug conspiracy statute, which likewise does not\nrequire proof of an overt act as an element of the\noffense.\nCongress' codification in the money laundering\nstatute of -- of this -- of this venue principle cannot be\nread to presuppose an overt act element when the very\nvenue rule it was codifying did not presuppose one.\nIf this Court -- if this Court has no further\nquestions --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I had just one other question,\njust out of curiosity, about how important this case is.\nHow many prosecutions under this statute does the\nGovernment bring without proving an overt act?\nMR. MARCUS: I'm -- I'm not aware of -- I'm not\naware of a number, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Are there any?\nMR. MARCUS: I -- I don't know. I mean, it's --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me quite unlikely.\nMR. MARCUS: Well --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm just wondering. It seems\nto me sort of a tempest in a teapot, this whole case to\nme.\nMR. MARCUS: Yes. I think it's true in the vast\nmajority of cases, the Government does have proof of an\novert act. And, of course, overt acts help establish the\n-- establish the agreement and -- and to convince the jury\nbeyond a reasonable doubt there was an agreement.\nIf the Court has no further questions --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I -- I do have one and it's\nnot on the money laundering conspiracy issue, but in this\nparticular case, would it be consistent with the position\nthat the Solicitor General has been taking for us to hold\nthe final disposition of this case pending Booker and\nFanfan? Wasn't there a sentencing question?\nMR. MARCUS: Well, it's our position that it\nwasn't -- they didn't raise that issue in -- in the court\nof appeals. They didn't raise the Sixth Amendment issue\nin the court of appeals. They didn't raise that issue in\ntheir cert petition here, and so it's -- it's not covered\nby the -- by the question presented. So it is the\nposition that we've -- that we've set out in the brief\nthat it should not be -- it should not be held pending\nthat -- that disposition in Booker and Fanfan.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And that's consistent with\nthe position that the Government has been taking routinely\nin cases where Booker -- where the sentencing guidelines\nare an issue?\nMR. MARCUS: Well, I think in the -- I think\nthat that position is based on petitions that have raised\nthe question, I believe.\nIf -- if the Court has no further questions, it\nshould reaffirm the conspiracy statutes that do not\ncontain an overt act requirement should not be read to\ninclude one. Thank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Marcus.\nMs. Samek, you have about 3 and a half minutes\nleft.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SHARON C. SAMEK\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMS. SAMEK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nJustice Ginsburg, you had inquired about the\nnumber of subsection -- conspiracy subsections, and I\ndidn't get a chance to answer your question. Even if you\ndon't find the statute is unique because of the venue\nprovision, as my review of the conspiracy subsections in\ntitle 18, there were only about two others out of the 50-\nsome-odd cases that have the same structural anomaly that\n1956(h) does. So this would not be opening up a can of\nworms to say that in this case an overt act clearly was\nintended by Congress and that we need to look at\ncongressional intent. So it wouldn't be -- require -- a\nholding in this case consistent with congressional purpose\nwould not require the Court to then have to review every\nsingle title 18 conspiracy subsection.\nAs the Government pointed out, money laundering\ncases are not typically prosecuted without the commission\nof an overt act because overt acts are relatively simple\nto prove. There's no reason why Congress would have\nintentionally eliminated the overt act requirement from\nmoney laundering conspiracies when, on the one hand, it's\neasy to prove, but on the other hand, it placed such a\ncritical value in money laundering conspiracies because\nit's not just that it shows that criminal intent has\ncrystallized and that money laundering is actually afoot,\nbut you're talking about taking offenses, like we say in\nour brief, where someone pledges a -- a cow for collateral\nfor a loan and then they talk with a friend about whether\nor not they should sell the cow, and they decide not to\nsell the cow. Under the Government's theory, they\ncouldn't be prosecuted for defrauding the Government\nbecause, in fact, they never sold the cow. They couldn't\nbe prosecuted for conspiracy to defraud the Government\nbecause they didn't commit an overt act in furtherance of\ndefrauding the Government. They couldn't be convicted or\nprosecuted for money laundering because they never sold\nthe cow, so there were never any proceeds to generate.\nBut they could be convicted, under the Government's\ntheory, of conspiracy to commit money laundering based on\nthe sale of a cow and their sentence would increase from a\npotential 5 years to a potential 20 years. There's\nabsolutely no indication in the Congressional Record that\nCongress ever intended such dramatic triggering of\nsubstantially higher penalties without the commission of\nan overt act, which is not difficult to prove.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The Government has said that\n-- that you have essentially waived their sentencing\nguidelines issue that you asked us in footnote 6 of your\nbrief to consider.\nMS. SAMEK: In the district court, there were\nissues raised as to all defendants as far as various\nsentencing enhancements. In front of the Eleventh\nCircuit, one of those enhancements was argued and it was\nrejected. As to Mr. Hall, one of the sentencing\nenhancements were argued and was reversed on that\nsentencing enhancement. But there is still a sentencing\nenhancement that was raised in the Eleventh Circuit, but\nit was not raised in this petition. It was not the issue\nthat this Court granted cert on, but we would argue that\nit's still a valid -- a valid claim and that this Court\nshould hold this decision in abeyance until its decision\nin Booker and Fanfan.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was the argument below that --\n-- that imposing the sentencing enhancement was\nunconstitutional, or was the argument just that the facts\ndidn't support it?\nMS. SAMEK: The argument was that the facts\ndidn't support it.\nFinally, Your Honor, we would -- Your Honors, we\nwould just again say that Congress did not intend to cause\na dramatic change in the way money laundering conspiracies\nwere prosecuted. This Court has said in other cases that\nwhen Congress intends dramatic changes, that you would\nexpect to find something in the legislative history. The\nCourt has said that in the Lewis case having to do with\ninterstate gambling and -- I see my time is up. Thank\nyou.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you very much.\n"
