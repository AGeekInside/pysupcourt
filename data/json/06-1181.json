        "content": "(11:06 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in case 06-1181, Dada v. Mukasey.\nMr. Meade.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. MEADE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. MEADE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nCongress has provided that certain aliens,\nincluding those with good moral character, are eligible\nfor voluntary departure. Congress has also provided\nthat all aliens may file one motion to reopen raising\nnew facts within 90 days.\nThe question is how to reconcile these two\nprovisions. The parties agree on two key points:\nFirst, the Government agrees that the statute can be\nread to preserve motions to reopen for voluntary\ndeparture recipients. Second, the Government agrees\nthat such aliens can file a motion to reopen; and if the\nimmigration official happens to act quickly enough, the\nalien will receive a ruling. But, under the\nGovernment's view, if the official does not act quickly\nenough, the alien is denied an adjudication.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we consider that in\nyour case, given that the application to reopen was made\nwhen there were only two days left to run for the\ntermination of the voluntary departure time -- in other\nwords, it was your delay, not the Government's, that\nmade it impossible to decide this in the requisite time?\nMR. MEADE: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and I\nhave two responses, one relating to this particular case\nas well as the cases in general.\nBut, as to this particular case, Mr. Dada\nfound new counsel, which took a week; and in the\nremaining time he prepared a motion to reopen with 80\npages of exhibits including affidavits, five letters,\nmedical documents, financial records including tax\nreturns. And that's why it took an additional\ntwo-and-a-half weeks to do the motion to reopen.\nBut, as a general matter, aliens file at\ndifferent periods during the period. For example, in\nthe Eleventh Circuit case of Ugokwe the alien filed with\n30 days left in the period, and the Government, the\nagency, didn't act in time.\nBut what happens in the agency is that\nmotions to reopen are, in fact, decided relatively\nquickly -- just not quickly enough.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How many of those\nare -- are granted?\nMR. MEADE: How many --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What percentage of\nmotions to reopen are granted in favor of the alien?\nMR. MEADE: We've looked for that statistic,\nand we have not been able to find the statistic.\nHowever, there are numerous cases presenting very\nsympathetic facts which show grants of motions to\nreopen.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So how many -- do\nyou know how many are filed on an annual basis?\nMR. MEADE: Yes, I do. As a general matter,\nthere are 10,000 motions to reopen filed, but that's for\nall aliens, for all removal proceedings. Since\nvoluntary departure is roughly 10 percent of all\nremovals, we estimate that'S roughly a thousand motions\nto reopen filed by voluntary departure recipients.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So there would be no\nreason not to file one of these if you were subject to\nvoluntary -- if you elected voluntary departure, and it\nextended your time to stay, right? Seemingly, everybody\nwould file one of these if we rule in your favor.\nMR. MEADE: Not necessarily. There are --\nthe statute governs when a motion to reopen is proper,\nand the Attorney General determined, even under the\nprevious statutory scheme --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We're dealing with\npeople who have already broken the law. So you're\nsaying they are likely to follow the statute that says\nonly file a motion to reopen under these circumstances?\nMR. MEADE: Well, two responses: First,\nthere are sanctions for frivolous filing under the\nimmigration proceedings.\nSecond, the Attorney General, under the old\nregime that wasn't tightened -- the Attorney General\nconcluded that there was no pattern of abuse of motions\nto reopen.\nAnd, third, going forward, this is not a\nrisk because --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If an alien has not been\ndiligently pursuing his or her rights, you would argue\nthe person was still entitled to equitable tolling if\nthe alien files a motion to reopen?\nMR. MEADE: When you say that they're not\ndiligently pursuing their rights, I am not clear --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that generally a\nrequirement for equitable tolling: A person has to have\nbeen diligently pursuing his rights?\nMR. MEADE: Generally, yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But you don't advocate the\nadoption of that here. You say if you file a petition\n-- a motion to reopen, you get automatic equitable\ntolling.\nMR. MEADE: Yes. Not necessarily equitable\ntolling, but, yes, automatic tolling under the statute.\nBut to show quickly --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why isn't -- why isn't it\nfair to say: You have the short time frame by statute\nto leave the country if you've left in voluntary\ndeparture. Yet, the Government has provided reopening\nfor all aliens. Okay.\nWhy isn't it reasonable to say that, by\nasking for reopening when you've gotten permission to\nvoluntarily depart within \"x\" days, you are\nrelinquishing your voluntary departure status?\nMR. MEADE: That --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't that a perfect\nreconciliation of the two?\nMR. MEADE: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. That's\nthe option that the Government is proposing\nprospectively. It is also something that my client\nrequested at every stage of the proceedings before the\nBoard, before the Fifth Circuit, and the cert petition,\nand in our opening brief. That is one way to reconcile\nthe two statutory provisions which the Government is\nproposing on an ongoing basis that will not apply to our\nclient.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you raised the\nquestion, as I remember, when you put it in the cert\npetition. The Government advised against granting on\nthat question and limiting it to the question of having\nit -- having it both ways, keeping your voluntary\ndeparture and moving to reopen.\nMR. MEADE: Yes, that's correct, Justice\nGinsburg.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, another way\nto reconcile the two that I think would be beneficial to\nyour client, but I'm not sure it's open to us, is to\naddress the Government's view that, when you voluntarily\ndepart, your motion to reopen is automatically\nwithdrawn. That is, as I gather, set forth only in a\nregulation and not the statute.\nNow, it seems to me that if I were -- if I\nthought it important to reconcile the two, I would be\nmuch more concerned about that interpretation -- that\nthe motion to reopen is automatically withdrawn -- than\nI would suggest we start incorporating equitable tolling\nrules and all of that.\nBut, I take it, the vulnerability of that\nregulation is probably beyond -- beyond debate.\nMR. MEADE: Well, that regulation is subject\nto litigation. That would be another way to solve the\nproblem as you suggest. It would be --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it wasn't directly\nchallenged here, was it?\nMR. MEADE: Excuse me?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That regulation was not\ndirectly challenged in this case?\nMR. MEADE: It was not directly challenged\nbecause the Fifth Circuit is one of the circuits that\nsays that the motion -- that regulation is valid.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if we don't\naddress it here, there's going to be another case in a\nyear or 18 months where that's going to be raised?\nMR. MEADE: Your Honor, as to voluntary\ndeparture recipients, this Court can construe the\nstatute to avoid the conflict here. And, moving\nforward, the Government has a proposed solution which,\nif adopted, will resolve the question on an ongoing\nbasis.\nSome of the examples of the facts that arise\nin motions to reopen are seen in various cases. For\nexample, a child newly diagnosed with mental\ndisabilities as in the Azarte case in the Ninth Circuit,\na parent newly diagnosed with health problems as in the\nBIA case of Diaz Mucho --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, in all these\ncases, if you think you have a good case on the motion\nto reopen, all you have to do is give up the benefits\nthat you have availed yourself under voluntary\ndeparture, and then the motion to reopen is not\nautomatically withdrawn.\nMR. MEADE: With respect, that's not an\noption to our client. Our client tried to do that, but\nwas not permitted.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I mean he -- you\nshould not elect voluntary departure in the first place.\nMR. MEADE: Well, the problem is because of\nthe very nature of the motion to reopen. A motion to\nreopen, by its very nature, is based on changed\ncircumstances, circumstances that were not available at\nthe original time of the hearing.\nSo a person could enter and accept voluntary\ndeparture at the time of the hearing and, because of\ncircumstances that change, that, by definition, he or\nshe could not have known about, is then in a bind when\nhe wants to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What were those\ncircumstances here?\nMR. MEADE: The circumstances here is that\nprevious counsel had failed to submit an application and\nsupporting evidence. And under the BIA case law that's\na proper vehicle for a motion to reopen.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it existed? You're\nnot saying something that came up later? What was the\nground that the, in this case, that wasn't brought up by\nthe first counsel?\nMR. MEADE: It was a file for adjustment of\nstatus, an application for adjustment of status and\nsupporting documents, as well as the supporting evidence\nshowing that this was a bona fide marriage. And the BIA\nhas numerous cases which says that a motion to reopen of\nthis type is a valid motion to reopen.\nNow, of course, the agency didn't rule on\nwhether the facts did or not -- did or did not need a\nmotion to reopen. So that question isn't before the\nCourt. But the other cases show the various kinds of\ntracks that come up to establish a motion to reopen and\nwhy it's an important part of the immigration process.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Meade, why was your\nclient not allowed to withdraw the voluntary departure\noption, withdraw from it?\nMR. MEADE: Justice Souter, that's unclear.\nThe agency didn't ask -- didn't answer that in the first\ninstance. There has never been a reason given\nthroughout the entire litigation, and now there is some\nirony --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So all we have on the\nrecord is just an IJ's determination that he would not\naccept it?\nMR. MEADE: Well, it wasn't the IJ. It was\nbefore the Board. It was presented to the Board, and\nthe Board's order only said he is ineligible for this\nrelief because he has overstayed the voluntary departure\nperiod. But there is some irony --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But at the time he filed,\nhe had not overstayed, because he filed on Friday\nafternoon, right?\nMR. MEADE: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so maybe the point is\nwe didn't have time to rule on it simply because he\nfiled it on Friday afternoon and he had to leave on\nSunday, and therefore, we should not take that as a\ndetermination that had he filed in time for timely\naction by the court he would have been denied.\nMR. MEADE: The agency has never given a\nreason for why they did not accept the withdrawal,\nalthough there is some irony in the fact that the\nproposed solution going forward would give aliens\nexactly what my client asked for if the agency --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If the voluntary withdrawal\nhad been withdrawn successfully, he would then have been\nsubject to the alternate order of removal?\nMR. MEADE: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And he could have been\nremoved immediately?\nMR. MEADE: That's correct.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And that would have mooted\nthe motion to reopen, wouldn't it?\nMR. MEADE: It wouldn't have mooted the\nmotion to reopen. Motions to reopen are available to\nall aliens subject to a final order, including criminal\naliens, including some accused of terrorism.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Would it remain pending once\nhe had left the United States?\nMR. MEADE: Not once he had left the United\nStates. But all my client wants -- all my client wanted\nat that time was to be placed in the same circumstance\nas all other aliens subject to a final ruling.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, but he's not in the\nsame circumstance. I mean, he's made his choice. He\nwas offered voluntary departure, which had advantages.\nHe could arrange his affairs and go when he wanted\nwithin 60 days. What he gave up was the ability to\nappeal the determination.\nThat doesn't seem to me as, as outrageous.\nI mean, it happens all the time. When a criminal\ndefendant pleads to a lesser charge, he gives up the\nability to appeal. And that's what's going on here. He\nhas gotten the advantage of a voluntary departure and\ngiven up the ability to appeal. I don't bleed for him.\nIt seems to me it's an option presented\nbefore him and he took it.\nMR. MEADE: I have three responses, Justice\nScalia.\nFirst, I'll agree that the alien can file\nthe motion to reopen. The only question is whether it's\ngoing to be adjudicated in time.\nSecond, as for the question of the bargain,\nwhether giving up appeals is part of the bargain, all\nparties agree that an alien who accepts voluntary\ndeparture can continue to appeal to the Board, to the\ncourts of appeals. The only, the only adjudicatory\nprocess that the government says that my client is not\nentitled to now is one motion to reopen.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Still and all, it's part of\nthe deal. Even better. Even better. He hasn't even\ngiven up all his appeals.\nMR. MEADE: One final --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's just, part of the deal\nhe gave up this little ability to reopen, and that's --\nthat's the choice he made when he accepted voluntary\ndeparture.\nMR. MEADE: One final response is that in\nthe government's proposed regulation, an alien is\npermitted to file a motion to reopen notwithstanding\nhaving been granted voluntary departure, which indicates\nthat the government itself does not think that the\nbargain includes -- or that Congress did not intend the\nbargain to include a waiver of the one motion to reopen\nwhich all aliens are entitled to file.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Going back to the\nquestion that Justice Alito put to you, that he would\nthen be, and you agree this is what you asked for first,\nlike any other removable alien. And Justice Alito asked\nyou: Well, then he could be removed immediately, is\nthat not so? My understanding was, yes, that's so, but\nyou can move for a stay of removal when you have a\nreopening pending. Is that true?\nMR. MEADE: Yes. If you have a final order\nof removal, yes, you can file for a stay once you have a\nfinal order. So my client is in a worse position.\nBecause he's under the voluntary departure grant, he\ncannot get the same ability for a stay that those who\nare subject to a final removal. So the irony is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If you say that tolling is\nautomatic, which I assume is your position, would it be\npossible under the statutes to say that tolling is not\nautomatic but can be permitted in the discretion of the\nhearing officer?\nMR. MEADE: I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Or are we then just\ninventing something that's not in the statute at all?\nMR. MEADE: Well, the problem, Justice\nKennedy, is that the agency would need to act within the\nshort time period. And --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No. All it needs to do is\nto say, we'll grant you an extension while we look at\nthis.\nMR. MEADE: That's true, Justice Kennedy.\nBut that's essentially the same action that would be\nneeded to decide the motion to reopen in the first\nplace. Motions to reopen are discretionary. They go to\nthe same Board member that had decided the original\nappeal. So it does not take much time or effort for the\nagency to be able to decide these, as is reflected by\nthe general time periods for adjudication.\nFor example, in the Dekoladeno case on the\nFourth Circuit, the motion was decided in 23 days. In\nthe Sidikhouya case out of the Eighth Circuit --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, presumably it\ndoesn't take them much time because when someone elects\nvoluntary departure they don't have to address it. I\nmean, this would obviously increase the volume of\nmotions to reopen. As I said, I don't see know why\nanybody -- why everybody wouldn't file one, because it\nextends their stay.\nMR. MEADE: It's a discretionary\ndetermination to the single Board member. And the Board\nmember could deny the motion to reopen, even when\nthere's a prima facie case. All they have to do is look\nto see if it -- in the subset of cases that the agency,\nexercising its own discretion, where they agree that a\nmotion to reopen is proper. And all we're asking for in\nthis case, not special procedures, not anything added to\nthe motion to reopen process, but only the right to have\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there appeal? I mean,\nwhat happens? They file a motion to reopen, denied.\nNow, can they appeal that?\nMR. MEADE: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. And how much time\ndoes that take?\nMR. MEADE: Well, the denial of a motion to\nreopen, at that point there would be a final order in\neffect.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right. But how -- do they\nthen appeal the motion to -- they appeal the motion --\nthe denial of the motion to reopen or how long -- where\ndo they go? Do they have -- this is the Board, so they\ngo right to the court of appeals?\nMR. MEADE: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And how long do those take\non average?\nMR. MEADE: One difference, though, between\npetitions for review and motions to reopen is that\npetitions for review can be decided from outside the\ncountry under the 1996 amendments. And motions to\nreopen under the agency's regulations, cannot. So the\nproblem is that there is no ability for an alien --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not interested in the\nproblem. I'm interested in how much added time it\nactually means. So let's go -- if you win, how much\nadditional time in a typical case would the alien have\nbefore he has to leave?\nMR. MEADE: Petitions for review take\nlonger. According to the agency's current regulations,\nthey take approximately, I believe, 13 months or so is\nwhat the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And then, and then do you\nin addition ask for cert or is it not in addition? Are\nyou including that within the 13 months?\nMR. MEADE: Your Honor, I don't have those\nexact statistics.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Or would you just guess on\nthe basis of your experience? I'm not holding you to\nit.\nMR. MEADE: There might be cases where alien\nseek cert as well. But for the most part --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. What I'm\nwondering here, and this is because I see two contrary\nthings, if for to you win it means that you are adding\nan average of, say, 400 days to a stay where Congress\nsaid we want you to stay no more than 60 days or 120?\nThat's pretty hard for me to reconcile, to tell you the\ntruth.\nMR. MEADE: Well, one of the answers on that\nquestion on the petition for review front is exactly\nwhat the government has proposed in its rule going\nforward, which is that an alien who has voluntary\ndeparture can file a petition for review, but by doing\nso the voluntary departure grant terminates and they're\nin the same position as other aliens, on the same level\nplaying as other aliens. That's the solution being\nproposed by the government going forward, and as to the\npetition for review hypothetical that would also apply.\nThat would just put my client in the same position as\nall other aliens, including criminal aliens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not sure I understand\nit. Are you asking for automatic tolling just until the\nmotion to reopen is decided or until the motion is\ndecided and also the appeal process has run?\nMR. MEADE: Just for the motion, just for\nthe time that the motion to reopen is decided.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's what I thought.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well then, that's the\nanswer to my question.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But in your discussion with\nJustice Breyer you seemed to be saying that he can hang\naround right through the appeal.\nMR. MEADE: Thank you for the correction,\nJustice Scalia.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, is your\nposition that the right to appeal is taken away, just as\nunder the current regime the motion to reopen is taken\naway?\nMR. MEADE: No, Chief Justice Roberts. The\ndifference is that petitions for review can be\nadjudicated from outside the country, so whether the\nalien is here or abroad he can get an adjudication of\nhis motion -- of his petition for review, and that was a\nchange under the 1996 act.\nThe problem for motions to reopen is that an\nalien cannot receive an adjudication at all. He can't\nstay. He can't go. There's no way for those new facts.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's by regulation,\nthough, that he can't, he cannot pursue that from out of\nthe country.\nMR. MEADE: Yes, that's true. That is\nnot -- that is by regulation, although that regulation\napplies to all motions to reopen, not just for the\nsubset of motions to reopen or voluntary departure\nrecipients.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If your client or some\nother client, assuming the government wins in this case,\nleaves within the 60-day period and the petition for\nrehearing is forwarded, can he take all these affidavits\nand apply for an adjustment of status, or is that much\nlonger?\nMR. MEADE: No. The problem is that for an\nalien, for many aliens covered by voluntary departure,\nonce they leave the country they are subject to various\nunlawful presence bars. So by leaving the country these\nbars are triggered and they cannot get the same relief\nfrom outside the country.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Even with voluntary\ndeparture?\nMR. MEADE: Even with voluntary departure.\nLeaving the country triggers these bars. Once you're\noutside the country you cannot reapply for admission for\nin some cases up to 10 years, and that precludes the\nability to leave the country and seek the relief, even\nif you have a marriage to a United States citizen, even\nif there are extreme circumstances in a particular case\nthat need to be addressed and that would be addressed\nunder a motion to reopen.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have to argue\nthat the -- my understanding is that once the -- let's\nsay it's the government's proposed regulation and the\nmotion for -- or the voluntary departure is withdrawn to\nenable you to consider the motion to reopen. They can\nproceed with deportation at that time, correct?\nMR. MEADE: Absolutely.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you -- you almost\nhave to be arguing that the motion to reopen tolls the\ntime for deportation as well, right?\nMR. MEADE: No. We just want -- under the,\nunder the question -- under the government's proposed\nrule or under the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, under your\nposition, I guess, is what your position is on that.\nMR. MEADE: Right. Well, the tolling\nsolution, the tolling construction, would permit tolling\nduring the voluntary departure period and during the\nvoluntary departure period there is no final order in\neffect. So yes, it would toll the time for leaving the\ncountry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, the\ngovernment cannot enter a deportation order during a\nvoluntary departure period.\nMR. MEADE: Yes. That's governed by the\nagency's own regulations that say that there's no -- the\nultimate order of deportation does not go into effect\nuntil an overstay of a voluntary departure period.\nOne thing that is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So I'm not following this.\nI thought the assumption was we're going to be using the\ngovernment's new proposed system, in which the\nacceptance of voluntary departure is eliminated when you\nfile a reopening petition, right. So can the government\nthen proceed to deport you involuntarily or is that also\ngoing to be stayed until, until completion of the\nreopening petition?\nMR. MEADE: I'm sorry, Justice Scalia.\nYou're absolutely right. I was addressing the tolling\nconstruction with Mr. Chief Justice. But as to the\ngovernment's proposed rule under the proposed rule and\nwhat my client asks for, the time -- the alien would be\nautomatically subject to a final order and could be\ndeported involuntarily so long as the alien did not get\nand obtain a stay of deportation from the agency or the\ncourt, so yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that, that involuntary\ndeportation would effectively cancel the, the petition\nfor reopening, right?\nMR. MEADE: If the agency acted quickly\nenough and involuntarily deported someone within that\ntime --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why are you willing to\nleave the involuntary deportees in that position,\nwhereas you're not willing to leave the voluntary\ndeportees in that position, that their reopening\npetition just vanishes? Why is it any fairer for the\ninvoluntary deportees than for the voluntary? In fact\nit's probably fairer for the voluntary because they made\ntheir choice.\nMR. MEADE: Your Honor, I agree with you\nthat that regulation is problematic, although the Court\ndoes not need to address it in this case.\nWith the court's permission, I would like to\nreserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Meade.\nMr. Kneedler.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe filing of a motion to reopen does not\nautomatically suspend the obligation of an alien to\nleave the United States within the time that was\nspecified in the Board's order granting permission to\ndepart voluntarily. The grant of voluntary departure\nreflects an exchange of benefits between the government\nand the alien and Petitioner's automatic tolling rule\nwould greatly subvert that reciprocal arrangement by\ngiving the alien the unilateral and automatic ability to\nextend the substantive terms of the immigration relief\nthe --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Kneedler, I think, I\nthink that your, your opposing counsel gave a good\nanswer to that. I also thought it was a quid pro quo,\nbut it's a very strange quid pro quo. I could\nunderstand the government saying, look, if you accept\nvoluntary departure your reopening is dead; you have to\nchoose between asking for reopening or voluntary\ndeparture. But that's not the quid pro quo you're\nsaying that the government is adopting. The quid pro\nquo is if you accept voluntary departure you roll the\ndice as to whether your reopening petition will be\ndecided in time. It isn't dead. It's still there, but\nyou just have to hope that it will be decided before you\nget deported.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, let me make one --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's a very\nstrange statutory quid pro quo, it seems to me.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Let me make one point clear\nat the outset. Petitioner's motion to reopen was not\ndismissed because he was not able to file one. It was\ndenied because he was not eligible for the underlying\nsubstantive relief that he requested in this motion.\nOverstaying a voluntary departure period does not, for\nexample, bar an alien from obtaining asylum or\nwithholding of removal on a motion to reopen. It's only\nthe particular substantive form of relief that he\nrequested in his motion to reopen that is at issue, and\nthat was denied.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that may be. But\nCongress passed a statute that grants a statutory right\nto file a motion to reopen no matter what the relief is.\nAnd the thing that seems strange to me, I guess to carry\nJustice Scalia's question one step further, is what\nseems strange to me is that Congress would have granted\nthat right in effect across the board, regardless of\nwhat the reason for the reopening might be and yet would\nhave done so knowing that the, that the time for\nadjudication before the IJ is likely to take longer than\nthe period of the, prior to the moment of required\ndeparture. It sounds as though Congress on your view\nwould be -- would have been giving a right to reopen\nthat in practical terms in most cases will avail the\nalien absolutely nothing because he'll have to get out\nbefore there can be an adjudication.\nMR. KNEEDLER: With all respect, that's not\ncorrect.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Again, both prior to 1996 and\nafter 1996 Congress specified that an alien who\noverstays the voluntary departure period is ineligible\nfor three forms of discretionary relief. Now it's\nvoluntary departure, cancellation or removal, or\nadjustment of status. That was true both beforehand and\nafterhand. Before 1996, there was no statutory\nlimitation on the time for either a motion to reopen or\nvoluntary departure. Congress was concerned about\nabuses on both of those fronts, and what it did in 1996\nwas to compress the voluntary departure time for 60 days\nbecause it was concerned about how long the agency was\nallowing agents -- aliens to remain in the country under\norders of voluntary departure. And what it did with\nrespect to motions to reopen was very modest. It just\nput in statutory form a limitation that the agency had\nput in place pursuant to a statutory directive to place\ntime and number limitations on motions to reopen because\nof Congress's concern about abuse.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but isn't the\nquestion in this case whether what Congress did was as\nmodest as you say? Because if it is as modest as you\nsay, then in at least a substantial category of cases in\nwhich a motion to reopen will be filed, it will in fact\nbe no time in the real world to act on that motion\nbefore the voluntary departure date. And the question\nis did Congress really intend a right to reopen that is\nas modest as that.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And it seems strange that\nit would have.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Two responses to that. With\nrespect to the voluntary departure, Congress anticipated\nthat the alien was going to leave under the order of\nvoluntary departure, not remain here. And prior to\n1996, just to --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it was -- was the\nregulation -- was the current regulation in place at the\ntime of the '96 Act, that the -- that the departure of\nthe alien, whatever the term is, waives the motion to --\nMR. KNEEDLER: That regulation has been a\nfundamental part of motions to reopen going back at\nleast until the 1960s.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So, we assume that Congress\nknew that.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. Yes, we do have. And\nthat's part of the arrangement. The only thing -- and\nthat regulation was repromulgated as part of General\nMotion to Reopen Regulation in 1995.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, then Congress knew at\nthe time of the '96 Act that, if in fact the motion to\nreopen was filed in the normal course, it probably\ncouldn't be heard prior to the date at which (a) the\nalien either will overstay and be in trouble for that or\n(b) will have departed and, under the existing\nregulatory regime, have forfeited his right to reopen.\nAnd it's the strangeness that Congress would want --\nwould have wanted to extend the right to reopen to a\nstatutory level under these circumstances unless it\ncontemplated some kind of a tolling scheme that would\navoid this sort of Kafka-esque result.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. Again, if I may, the --\nwhat Congress had in mind with the deal of granting\nvoluntary departure was it greatly constricted the time\nto leave. You have to leave in 60 days, and if you\ndon't leave in 60 days, you're not going to get\nvoluntary departure adjustment of status or cancellation\nor removal. It didn't affect the eligibility for other\nsubstantive relief that an alien might file for in a\nmotion to reopen, such as asylum, such as if he has new\nevidence going to the ground of removal. But Congress\nwas particularly concerned not to allow these three\nforms of discretionary relief to remain available. And\nso I think Congress necessarily would have been\nunconcerned about whether, if an alien did file a motion\nto reopen within that greatly constricted 60-day period\n-- in fact, in this case the Board gave 30 days --\nCongress wasn't concerned about preserving the\nunderlying substantive eligibility for those forms of\ndiscretionary relief, because it made that part of the\ndeal, that alien was giving up if he left -- if he\ndidn't leave the country, he was giving up that. Those\nwere lesser order forms of relief that Congress was\nmaking available, but it did did not take away, for\nexample, the right to apply for asylum or withholding.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler, why did the\nGovernment advise this Court not to grant cert on\nquestion number 1, which was: I want to apply to reopen\nand simultaneously, I want to withdraw my voluntary\ndeparture and be just like any other removable alien,\ntake my chances just like anyone else? The Government\nsaid don't present that -- Court, don't consider that\nquestion. Why?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Because that had not been --\nled to widespread litigation in the courts. This\nautomatic tolling rule is -- was what we were\nfundamentally concerned about. In fact, we told the\nCourt not to take the case at all because the new\nregulations were under consideration. But that\nparticular provision -- issue has not generated that\nmuch litigation. This automatic tolling rule has, and\nmore than --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And it seems that this\nlitigant said, number one, I don't want to take\nadvantage of the status of I have to get out, but I can\ndo so voluntarily. The first thing I want to do is to\nmove to reopen, withdraw my voluntary departure. And\nthen the second thing was, if I can't do that, please\nextend my voluntary departure time while I move to\nreopen. It seems that this litigant is being put in a\nbind by not allowing this Court to consider what was the\nalien's first preference, that is, to withdraw the\nvoluntary departure.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But the Court rewrote the\nquestion presented so as not to -- not to address that,\nso I think it's not before the Court right here. But --\nbut beyond that, the deal, the arrangement -- the\nAttorney General has a lot of discretion how to\nimplement the voluntary departure provision. In fact,\nhe has the authority to eliminate voluntary departure\nfor additional categories of people who are not eligible\nunder the statute itself. So whether to --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What is the basis for the\nrule that an alien can't withdraw, can't seek to\nwithdraw a request for voluntary departure?\nMR. KNEEDLER: The regulations do not\nprovide for it, and it's inconsistent with the --\nJUSTICE ALITO: There is no regulation that\nprohibits it. Is that right?\nMR. KNEEDLER: As far as I'm aware there is\nno regulation that prohibits it, but the order is a\ngrant of voluntary departure, and the Board of\nImmigration Appeals order says you're granted permission\nto depart voluntarily within 30 days; if you do not, the\nfollowing consequences flow from that. Nothing in the\nBoard's order would allow the alien to avoid those\nconsequences by saying on the 28th day, after all I\ndon't want to do that. And this matter of implementing\nthe voluntary departure agreement is part of a general\nscheme of a quid pro quo between the alien and the\nUnited States. The voluntary departure is granted under\ncircumstances where the alien doesn't have that option.\nSo unilaterally -- allowing the alien unilaterally to do\nthat now is not provided for. Now, that doesn't -- that\ndoesn't take away from the Attorney General's\ndiscretionary authority in implementing the Act to\nprovide for that, which is what he has proposed in the\nnew rule. But this case has to be decided under the --\nunder the rules that are now in effect.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm having a lot of trouble\nunderstanding the case, because it's so complicated. If\nyou -- could you track it through for a minute? I mean,\nas I understand this, this probably doesn't concern\npeople who want to voluntarily depart before their case\nis finished, right? Where they don't reopen because\nthere is nothing to reopen?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right, but the people --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So we're at a person\nwho is before the Board or before the hearing examiner\nand he wants to -- he is now got a final order against\nhim.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So now you say to\nhim I'll tell you what we'll do to you: You leave, go,\ngood-bye, and we'll let you pursue your appeals anyway,\nbut from out of the country. That's true? Just tell me\nif I'm getting it right.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not talking about\nreopening. I'm talking about appeals.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, if he -- if he leaves\nthe country, I believe he can still appeal to the BIA.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And can you go to court,\ntoo?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. Justice Breyer, under\nthe statutory review provisions, you can -- you can\npetition for review and leave the country and still have\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So no problem. You\nsay go, good-bye, and we'll give you some good deals\nhere if you'll really go, but you pursue your appeals.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Does not he lose his right\nto have the motion to reopen ruled upon?\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's what I'm asking, I'm\ngetting at.\nMR. KNEEDLER: If I could just correct. I'm\nincorrect that you can have your appeal adjudicated if\nyou leave the country. I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not talking about\nmotions to reopen at all.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, I understand that. The\nappeal from the immigration judge to the Board of\nImmigration Appeals.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. But you can go to\nthere? You go to the BIA?\nMR. KNEEDLER: That's where you go after --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, why wouldn't\nyou treat --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand your\nanswer. You said you can or you can't from out of the\ncountry?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I've been informed that you\n-- that if you leave the country, you cannot pursue.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Cannot. Okay. But you can\ngo to the BIA? Leaving the country?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, you can't -- you can't go\nto the BIA.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You can't go anywhere.\nMR. KNEEDLER: You can't -- you cannot go to\nthe BIA.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So you lose all your\nappeals, not just your motion-to-reopen appeals if you\nleave the country?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Your administrative appeals.\nYou do not -- the statute has been amended to allow you\nto petition for review in a court if you leave the\ncountry.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh. Okay. So you say --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. Which was a change from\nwhat was before this Court in Stone. In 1996 Congress\namended the Act to allow an alien to continue to\nchallenge the final removal order after he leaves the\ncountry in court.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but you can't get to\ncourt if you haven't been to the BIA, right?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I believe -- I believe that's\ntrue unless --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And, again, we are talking\nabout a short period of time, like 30 days. In\npractical terms there's no way he is going to get\nthrough the BIA in 30 days. And, therefore, when he\nleaves the country, he cannot then try to get or\ncomplete his BIA review, and he therefore will have no\nchance to get into court, right?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think that -- I think that\nwould be correct unless -- I don't think this has ever\ncome up that I'm aware of, about whether you could go to\ncourt from an immigration judge's decision where you've\nleft the country and therefore can't appeal to the BIA.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: There's no reason to assume\nthat you could.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I just don't know the answer\n-- I just don't know the answer to that, because I'm not\nsure that scenario has come up, because usually, if\nsomebody wants to contest, they're not going to leave\nthe country before they have to, and if you appeal from\nthe immigration judge to the Board of Immigration\nAppeals, that suspends the finality of the order of\nremoval or the order of voluntary departure that the\nimmigration judge has entered. So if you appeal -- if\nyou want to stay in the country, all you have to do is\nfile an automatic appeal with the Board of Immigration\nAppeals and that suspends the finality of the departure\ntime.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And by doing that you do\npreserve your right to appeal; and you will preserve\nyour -- will you also preserve your right to go to court\nif you lose in front of the BIA.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. Yes. You do.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. We got that\nstraight.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. I'm sorry. I'm not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So why, if you want to have\na petition for reopening, why don't you just file an\nappeal and then file a petition for reopening and the\nappeal will enable you to stay in the country until your\n-- your petition for reopening is --\nMR. KNEEDLER: If you appeal to the Board of\nImmigration Appeals, a motion to reopen arises only\nafter the Board has issued a final order on your appeal.\nSo if you appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals, if\nthe Board rejects your claim on the merit, and\nreinstates the voluntary departure period to allow you\nto enter again --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're appealing the\nimmigration judge's decision.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The immigration judge's\ndecision, you're appealing that to the BIA.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that -- that enables\nyou to stay in the country --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. Until the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And at the same time you\nfile a petition to reopen the -- the administrative law\njudge's --\nMR. KNEEDLER: With the immigration judge.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I -- I suppose you could do\nthat, but the -- but the appeal -- it would be like a\nmotion to reopen in the district court while you've got\nan appeal to the -- to the BIA. I -- I think once the\nappeal goes to the Board -- this case involves motions\nto reopen filed with the Board of Immigration Appeals,\nnot with the immigration judge, and so -- the alien here\nconceded his deportability, sought a continuance, and\nthat was denied. He had no other substantive grounds of\nrelief. He asked for voluntary departure. That was\ngranted. He took an appeal to the BIA arguing he should\nhave been granted a continuance; the Board affirmed;\nreinstated a 30-day departure period; and then he wanted\nto seek reopening.\nAnd one question that Justice Breyer asked\nabout, what if reopening is denied would the automatic\ntolling rule continue? I suppose the alien could file a\nmotion to reconsider the denial of the motion to reopen,\nand if you had an automatic tolling rule, it would -- it\nwould last as long as it took the Board to act on the\nmotion to reopen, which is -- which 60, 90, 120 days.\nIn this past Fiscal Year the Board on motions to reopen\nresolved I think only about 55 percent of those within\n90 days. The Board has a huge backlog, and we're\ntalking -- and so we are talking about the very kind of\nabuse of the immigration system that this Court was\nconcerned about --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: May I ask one question?\nAnd I'm not sure the progression in which Justice Breyer\nwas going to begin. I take it that the motion to reopen\nhas -- shows new evidence, new factors, new\ncircumstances; and that would be unavailable on the\nappeal, because the record hasn't been supplemented. Or\nam I wrong about that?\nMR. KNEEDLER: That -- that's true. It has\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: While you have an appeal\n-- while you have an appeal from what was in the record.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right, although --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If you don't have the\nmotion to reopen then the -- then the new material is\nnot subject to the appeal, or am I wrong?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. It's not subject to the\nappeal as such but the Board procedures take account of\ndevelopments that happen while the case is on appeal,\nwhich is that you can file with the Board while your\nappeal is pending and ask for a motion to remand on the\nground that new evidence has come up. For example, in\nthe case of adjustment of status, where -- the alien's\nwife has filed a petition for immediate relative status\nto let the alien get a visa, if while the case is\npending on appeal that petition has been granted, then\n-- then it would -- then all the alien has to do is file\na motion with the Board and say there is new\ninformation; please remand it back to the immigration\njudge. So a lot of times what has happened is -- maybe\nintervening things have happened but the alien doesn't\ndo anything about it during the year that the appeal is\npending with the Board of Immigration Appeals; then\nthere is a final order and the alien rushes in with the\n-- with the new information at that point, where if you\nhad only brought it to the attention of the Board while\nthe appeal was pending, it could have been remanded.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So your basic is -- don't\ntell me if I'm right if I'm wrong, please. The --\nthe -- what I'm thinking your basic problem or position\nis and why you've got into this, is because you think\nany really meritorious case where there should be\nreopening will be pointed out to the Board before there\nis a final order in effect and before voluntary\ndeparture becomes an issue?\nMR. KNEEDLER: That -- that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if we decide against\nyou, then you're thinking, well, what will happen in\nevery case is after there is a final order, the alien\nwill move for a motion to reopen because he will get a\nfew extra days.\nMR. KNEEDLER: It's more than a few extra\ndays.\nJUSTICE BREYER: He gets a -- several --\nMR. KNEEDLER: It's an automatic tolling\nperiod.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Have I got it right, what\nyour point is?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. That is correct and I\n-- and I think it's fair to say if you're talking about\nchanged circumstances or new evidence that arises after\nthe IJ has rendered his decision, that's a period that\nmight be a year; it might be a year and a half. New\ndevelopments or changed circumstances are far more\nlikely to have happened during that period of time than\nthey would during a 30-day period of voluntary departure\nthat -- that the Board reinstates at the conclusion of\nthe appeal.\nSo an alien in this position who has been\ngranted voluntary departure and knows that a motion to\nreopen may not be a realistic option, if he wants to\nseek adjustment of status or cancellation of removal,\nthe solution to that is to be alert and attentive and\nfile something with the Board, if there are in fact --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why isn't the solution to\nwithdraw, relinquish the voluntary departure?\nMR. KNEEDLER: That would be -- that would\nbe one -- as the Attorney General said in his proposed\nregulations, that would be one way to administer the\nprogram, but the Act does not compel that. The Act does\nnot compel --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you do that, the\nalien is still subject to deportation, right?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. The alien is still\nsubject to deportation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: With the provision that\nhe can get a stay.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, he could get -- he could\nget a stay of removal, and the same -- same thing is\ntrue here, if the -- if the alien remains in the\ncountry, his voluntary departure period expires, he\ncould file for a stay of removal with the Board or he\ncould file for a stay of removal with the court of\nappeals if he wants to file a petition.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But then because he would\nthen be back -- if he stays here after the period is\nrun, then he has relinquished the voluntary departure.\nHe is like any removable --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right. Right. But -- but\nlike any person, he could file a motion for a stay with\nthe court of appeals to prevent his deportation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But not to stay -- but he\nwould not be hanging on to his voluntary departure.\nThat's gone.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, that -- that is correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is there any reason he\ncould not unilaterally relinquish the voluntary\ndeparture status as distinct from having to get approval\nfrom the Board or bureaucrat?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, as I say, the way that\n-- the Board's order grants him permission to voluntary\ndepart and says the following consequences will attach\nif you do not. Nothing in the Board's order allows him\nto withdraw. It grants him that permission.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I know it doesn't --\nit doesn't address the issue, and my question is --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I think it probably\nforecloses it.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Because it's the -- it's the\ncontent of the Board's order that -- that says you have\n60 days to depart and if you do not, the following\nconsequences attach.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the Board is\nsaying, look, I'm granting your request -- we are\ngranting your request for a voluntary departure status\nand there are certain consequences that that status\ncarries. He is saying, on my hypothesis, I relinquish\nthat status. Why are conditions that attach when he has\nthe status an indication that he cannot voluntarily\nrelinquish that status without further action by the\nBoard?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I -- I -- the statute and\nregulations just don't provide for it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, if they don't provide\nfor it, and they don't say you can't do it, why isn't it\narbitrary not to let him do it? I mean -- what -- if\nit's -- if it's arbitrary --\nMR. KNEEDLER: He -- he requested it at the\noutset. The case has proceeded on the sense that that\nis -- that that is the arrangement, that -- that the\nreciprocal benefits and burdens that the Government and\nthe alien have undertaken --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It sounds almost arbitrary\nto say to a person, look, if you think you have some new\nevidence and want to reopen, do it. But Congress wanted\nyou to get out of here in respect to this 60 days, so\nyou have to give up that. You're not getting those\nbenefits. Now, it's a tough bargain, but it seems\nreasonable.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What I don't see is to say\nonce you ask for this you can never get status\nadjustment.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. I'm not standing here\ndefending the contrary position as an overarching policy\nmatter, because after all the Attorney General's\nproposed regulations provide for that. My --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So why not apply them to\nthis person?\nMR. KNEEDLER: As they are now drafted they\nwould apply prospectively. But my only point is that\nvoluntary departure and motions to reopen are\nadministered under the statute and the regulations and\nthe BIA orders that are entered under the current\nregulatory framework, which has a different sort of deal\nbetween the alien and the government in mind, and that\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Which you say -- you say\nthat under the current regime, the voluntary departure\napplication, granted, is irrevocable. That's --\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think essentially -- I\nthink essentially yes. I --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The regulations don't say\nthat. The regulations are just blank. It doesn't say\nand if you do this it's irrevocable.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. And I want to qualify\nmy answer in a further respect -- that regulations with\nrespect to voluntary departure being granted by the\nBoard don't say anything like that. But I am informed\nby the executive office of immigration review that if\nthe immigration judge grants voluntary departure and the\nalien appeals to the Board, the ordinary course would be\nfor the Board to reinstate voluntary departure if it\nrejects the alien's appeal. But if on appeal the alien\nrequests that voluntary departure not be reinstated once\nthe Board's order is entered, then the Board will omit\nthat from its final order of removal.\nBut Petitioner here did not request on his\nappeal to the Board that the Board not reinstate a --\norder a voluntary departure if it had affirmed on the\nmerits. And so the Board went forward on the assumption\nthat the alien had requested voluntary departure,\nentered an order on that assumption, and once it's\nentered, it's a final order that would require some\namendment of the order, in order to -- in order to be\nchanged under the current regime.\nJUSTICE GINSBERG: But the order didn't say\nhe couldn't withdraw?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, it didn't.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what about this? I'm\njust trying this out. You don't have to respond if you\ndon't want to. But you say, look, the AG in his rules\nhere, really tried to reconcile the two interests that\nwe talked about in our prior conversation. Now\nhypothetically, I suppose you say that was a reasonable\nway of going about this, and we remand for consideration\nabout whether this prior situation that you couldn't do\nthat was arbitrary, capricious, abuse of discretion, or\nyour failure to apply it retroactively to a certain\nclass of people was arbitrary, capricious, abusive\ndiscretion?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think -- I think if the\nCourt wants to get into the question of whether he could\nwithdraw it, the proper thing for the Court to do would\nbe to reject the Petitioner's argument that there is an\nautomatic tolling rule, because that's fundamentally\ninconsistent with Congress' deliberate intention to\nimpose a short deadline and not let the agency extend\nthat, but to remand to the Board of Immigration Appeals\nfor an explanation as to whether he could withdraw his\nrequest for voluntary departure.\nI don't think the Court should decide that\nquestion on its own. I think that should be remanded to\nthe Board. If in the meantime the Attorney General\nissues regulations that provide for withdrawal of the\nrequest, maybe because his case would be back before the\nBoard, those new regulations could be applied. But\nwhether that -- the alien should be allowed to do that\nis fundamentally a question for the Attorney General in\nthe first instance.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In one of your -- in one\nof your arguments earlier you said the whole idea of\nvoluntary departure is to expedite the proceedings and\nso forth. I assume that voluntary departure is never\nelected as an option before the Board rules.\nMR. KNEEDLER: It is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In other words, it -- or\nam I wrong?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. It was elected before\nthe immigration judge. That's where you request it. If\nthe immigration judge rejects your arguments against\nremovability, grants you voluntary departure --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, but the removal -- at\nthe outset, you don't elect voluntary departure at the\noutset of the hearing?\nMR. KNEEDLER: You can. And you can get 120\ndays of time to depart. You can do that. People who\ndon't want to contest the removability at all --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no, no. I mean in a\ncontested case.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right. In the contested\ncases, you would ask for that at the conclusion of the\nhearing before the immigration judge. That gets\nsuspended if you appeal to the BIA because the order is\nnot final. It doesn't become final until the Board of\nImmigration Appeals affirms.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Kneedler, do you\nknow what percentage of these motions to reopen are\ngranted?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I do not. I asked that\nquestion, and I do not know the answer to that.\nI would like to come back to the fundamental\nautomatic tolling rule that -- the fundamental\ninconsistency of that automatic tolling rule with what\nCongress did in 1996, because it shortened to 60 days\nthe time limit in which an alien can depart.\nIt also eliminated a prior exception that\nhad been the law that allowed an exception to the\nconsequences for somebody who overstayed even the much\nlonger voluntary departure period for exceptional\ncircumstances. Congress repealed that exception.\nPrior to 1996, the Board in the case we cite\nin our briefs called Matter of Shaar, held that if an\nalien is granted voluntary departure and files a motion\nto reopen, it rejected two arguments. One is that the\nfiling of a motion to reopen was itself exceptional\ncircumstances that eliminated the deadline. It rejected\nthat. It also in an en banc decision rejected the\nautomatic tolling rule that Petitioner is arguing for\nhere under a situation in which Congress had granted a\nlong time for aliens to voluntarily depart.\nWe think it defies common sense to suggest\nthat when Congress compressed the time to 60 days, it\nmeant to at the same time reverse what the Board had\ndone in Matter of Shaar and granted an automatic tolling\nrule, not even one under the control of the immigration\nauthorities, but an automatic tolling rule as a matter\nof law simply by the unilateral act of filing a motion\nto reopen.\nAnd the Board in Matter of Shaar addressed\nall of those things. The Board of Immigration Appeals\nhas filed, followed Matter of Shaar, in the intervening\nyears since 1997 -- and importantly, I would like to\npoint this out, too, when Petitioner sought a motion for\nreopening, he relied on a Board decision called\nVillarde, which recognized that in some circumstances an\nalien may file a motion to reopen to try to get\nadjustment of status if there has been intervening\ndevelopment with respect to an immediate relative\npetition filed by a spouse.\nThe Board adopted that rule in this en banc\npublished decision Villarde, but said one of the\nqualifications for being eligible for that relief is\nthat you not be barred under Matter of Shaar, which\nmeans you not be barred by having overstayed your\nvoluntary departure period.\nSo, in the very procedure that Petitioner\ninvoked in this case, there is a published Board\ndecision post-1997 that relies on that -- that relies on\nthat rationale, and the Board has followed that\nconsistently. It is at the very least a reasonable\ninterpretation of the act for the Attorney General not\nto allow the undermining of this tightened voluntary\ndeparture system by providing for reopening.\nI should also point out that this is not\ntolling in the normal sense. Tolling usually arises\nwhere a person has a claim and there is a statute of\nlimitations for filing a claim before a forum.\nPetitioner here was already granted\nvoluntary departure. The 60-day time limit is not a\nprocedural statute of limitations. It is a limitation\non substantive immigration relief. And we think it's\nparticularly odd that the filing of a procedural motion\nto reopen would have the effect of changing the\nstatutorily limited time in which an alien could\nvoluntarily depart the United States.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Kneedler.\nMr. Meade, you have five minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. MEADE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. MEADE: The government's arguments on\nthe statutory interpretation in this case are undermined\nby its own proposed rule for at least five reasons.\nFirst, their proposed rule makes clear that\nthe government agrees that the statute can be read to\nhave multiple meanings.\nSecond, the proposed rule makes clear that\nCongress did not intend voluntary departure recipients\nto waive the motion to reopen in accepting voluntary\ndeparture.\nThird, the rule stresses the importance of\nmotions to reopen and their importance in bringing\nchanged facts to the agency's attention.\nFourth, the proposed rule turns on\nunilateral action of the alien and permits that\nunilateral action to terminate the voluntary departure\ngrant.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you agree with counsel\nfor the government as to how long it typically takes for\nthese motions to reopen to be disposed of? He said\nsomething like 55 percent take, what, more than --\nMR. MEADE: My understanding is that the\ntime, that the time is actually relatively short, that\nthey are generally decided within 90 days. They're\nprocedures passed by the -- by regulation which indicate\nthat they go to the same Board member. There has been\nstreamlining procedures by the agency in the early 2000,\n2001, 2002 period which helped expedite these. And\nactually, the time --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have any\nestimate about how many more motions to reopen will have\nto be considered if your client prevails in this case?\nMR. MEADE: I do not think that there will\nbe many additional motions to reopen, if that happens.\nCertainly, if the government has a -- if the proposed\nrule is adopted, the number of motions to reopen will\nnot be affected, because prospectively, the solution --\nthe problem will have been solved, and this case we'll\nonly be dealing with people in the pipeline, people who\nhave already made decisions about whether to file a\nmotion to reopen or not.\nSo assuming that the government's proposed\nrule is enacted in anything like its proposed form, then\nthere will be no problem going forward.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I don't\nunderstand that, because my -- as I understand it, it\nwould in every case grant an effective extension of the\ntime which you would have to depart if you had filed a\nmotion to reopen.\nMR. MEADE: No, that's not correct, with\nrespect. Under the government's proposed rule, the\nalien would be placed in the same position as other\naliens and would be -- and there would be no additional\nincentive to file a motion to reopen.\nUnder the government's proposed rule, the\nperiod would not toll, the voluntary departure grant\nwould expire, and the alien would be placed in the same\nposition as otherwise --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't it your position that\nthe statute requires tolling?\nMR. MEADE: Our interpretation is the\nstatute is subject to multiple interpretations. But the\none thing that the statute does not permit is the\nsolution, the construction that's being proposed by the\ngovernment in this case. The government -- the statute\nwould permit tolling. The statute permits reconciling\nthe provisions as the government proposes going forward.\nBut the one thing that the statute does not permit is\nthe government's position in this particular litigation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You answered my\nquestion with respect to the government's proposed\nregulation. But under your position that would allow\nthe voluntary departure option to remain open, then\nanyone who exercised that option would want to file a\nmotion to reopen because it would extend their time?\nMR. MEADE: The motions to reopen are\nsubject to statutory and regulatory limits. Moreover,\nthe time period --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The answer is yes?\nMR. MEADE: I'm saying that there -- aliens\ncould choose to do so, but I disagree that there would\nbe a -- many additional motions to reopen.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Your answer is yes, but the\nAttorney General's rule would prevent that -- proposed\nrule would --\nMR. MEADE: Yes. That's part of the answer,\nyes, Justice Scalia.\nBut in addition, the length of time of\nadjudication is entirely within the agency's control.\nIt can take two days, two weeks, two months, or if it\ntakes longer --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not if it has 10,000\nof these a year, as you told me in your opening\nargument. I mean, it takes some time to address them.\nYou can't say all they have to do is decide them all\nwithin two days.\nMR. MEADE: No. But the answer is that\nthere -- it is within their control, so the length of\ntolling under any tolling rule is not within the control\nof the alien. It's within the control of the agency.\nThis Court -- as to your question, Justice\nAlito, on the -- with the regulations with respect to\nwithdraw in this case, the agency is silent on that.\nIt's unclear to me why the agency -- may I finish --\nit's unclear why the agency did not give my client the\nrequest he requested, and we ask that this Court either\ngrant tolling or interpret the statute consistent with\nthe government's proposed rule.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
