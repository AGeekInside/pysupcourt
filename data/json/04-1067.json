SMITH\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMS. SMITH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe question presented in this case is\nwhether one occupant can give law enforcement valid\nconsent to search the common areas of a premises\nshared with another, even though another occupant is\npresent and objects to the search. The State of\nGeorgia submits that the answer to this case is a\nresounding yes. It is reasonable to recognize that a\nperson who satisfies Matlock's definition of common\nauthority -- that is, a definition that is not based\nupon property-law concepts, but one who has mutual use\nof property by virtue of having joint access or\ncontrol for most purposes -- can give consent for a\nsearch of that premises, in his or her own right.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do we look to what is\nsocially acceptable? Is there some language to that\neffect in some of our cases?\nMS. SMITH: There has been some of that in\nsome of the prior cases, Your Honor, that you do look\nto social norms. You've also said --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do you think it is the\nnorm that, if there are co-inhabitants of a house or\napartment, that it's okay to let a stranger in,\nagainst the express wishes of your spouse or co-\ninhabitant?\nMS. SMITH: I think that is --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: You think that's socially\nacceptable?\nMS. SMITH: I think it is -- I think it is\ncommon, Your Honor. As much as one would like to\nthink --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, it might be common,\nbut I'm not sure that's an acceptable kind of\nperformance.\nMS. SMITH: Well, I think, Your Honor, we\nhave what we have called either adduced expectation of\nprivacy or a limited expectation of privacy or what we\ncalled a shared expectation of privacy, by making the\ndecision, long before police appear at the door, to\nshare this premises with someone. And by --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: What --\nMS. SMITH: -- that decision --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- what if the spouse had\nput a sign up, \"No police allowed here\"?\nMS. SMITH: I don't think that, even as --\nin -- one could ensure that the spouse would honor the\nother person's wishes. I think this case is here to\ngive some substance to the recognition in Matlock of\nthe ability of the cotenant to consent, in his or her\nown right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What about the extent of\nthe search? Can the wife say, \"It's okay for you to\ncome in, and you can look in my husband's top drawer\"?\nMS. SMITH: I think, Your Honor, that would\nbe a question of fact, under the circumstances, to see\nwhether the husband has exhibited some exclusive use\nof that drawer or whether the facts would demonstrate\nthat she puts socks in there for him, she puts --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, how does the --\nMS. SMITH: -- notes in there --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- how does the policeman\n--\nMS. SMITH: -- for him --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- so, how is the\npoliceman supposed to know that?\nMS. SMITH: Well, I think -- looking -- we\nmeasure what is reasonable on the part of the police\nby looking to what they know. And Rodriguez made very\nclear, one does -- a policeman doesn't simply accept\nevery invitation to enter. If there's some ambiguity\nor some uncertainty, the policeman has a duty to\ninquire. And, I think, looking into the facts of this\nparticular case is a good example. You have police\nwho were called to the marital home of Mr. and Mrs.\nRandolph. It arose out of a domestic dispute, because\nMr. Randolph had absconded with the couple's child.\nThe officer -- this was a small town -- the officer\nknew Mr. Randolph, because Mr. Randolph was a local\nattorney. The officer knew that Ms. -- who the wife\nwas. And he knew this was the couple's home. When he\ngot there, in talking with the wife -- Mr. Randolph\nwas off with the child, hasn't returned to the\nresidence -- he learned that they had been having some\nproblems, but, in looking at the two conversations\nthat ensued, the policeman learned that, despite the\nproblems, she was back, she was living there. There\nwas no separation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought she said she\ncame to collect her belongings. That didn't sound\nlike she's intending to stay very long.\nMS. SMITH: She did not -- she did not relay\nthat to the officer. That came from Mr. Randolph, in\nhis testimony at the suppression hearing. All --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But isn't it relevant\nwhat the status of the person is? Someone might not\nknow -- the police might not know that someone on the\npremises is a temporary visitor.\nMS. SMITH: Well, Your Honor -- and I think\nthat, looking at the tenor of the conversations, that\nis exactly what this officer ascertained. He knew\nthat she was there, they had been living there, she\nwas back, she had been on a visit. She did not tell\nhim they were separated. She did not tell him she was\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: She called --\nMS. SMITH: -- only there --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the police, didn't\nshe? She called the police to come.\nMS. SMITH: She called the police. And what\nwe have, more importantly, is a factfinding by the\ntrial court that she, in fact, had common authority to\ngive consent to search.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And is that a -- is there\nany issue about that here?\nMS. SMITH: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, I thought\nthe issue was whether his statement, in effect, vetoed\nwhatever -- for Fourth Amendment purposes, whatever\npermission might have been given. But, as I -- I\nunderstood that there was no question -- what is it? -\n- under Rodriguez, at least -- of her authority,\nfacially to admit the police to the places that they\nwent.\nMS. SMITH: That is our position, Your\nHonor. I think there has been some question raised by\nthe Respondent, in his brief, trying to challenge both\nher authority over the actual bedroom, itself, which\nis an issue that wasn't raised below.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's what I thought.\nMS. SMITH: And there had been an argument\nraised in the appellate court --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But we --\nMS. SMITH: -- about whether she had\nabandoned the property. But the trial --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But all of this is really\ngetting pretty far from what I think is really the key\nquestion in the case. Matlock is decided. And\nMatlock said -- it referred to the risk that a joint\noccupant undertakes, the risk of inability to control\naccess during one's absence. So, the scene in Matlock\nis: one occupant is there, the other is absent; and\nthe one who was absent assumes the risk that the one\nwho was there will exercise control. Matlock doesn't\nspeak to the two people who are in disagreement\nsituation.\nMS. SMITH: That is correct, Your Honor, as\nto not addressing the spectral situation. But I would\ndisagree that Matlock simply only spoke to an absent\nnonconsenting defendant.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, what if we think it\ndoes? Because that's how I read it, too, that Matlock\ngoverns where one of the people is absent. And we\nhave a situation that's different here. Now what rule\ndo we look to?\nMS. SMITH: I think you look to whether she\nhas common authority over the premises in his -- in\nher own right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why?\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Even when --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why?\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- even when the husband\nis physically present and says no?\nMS. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor, because, first\nof all, you said, in Rodriguez, the Constitution does\nnot guarantee that a search, only with the defendant's\nconsent, will occur. Your Honors said that --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But, do you --\nMS. SMITH: -- only a search that --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- do you --\nMS. SMITH: -- is unreasonable --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- think the officers had\nsufficient grounds to get a warrant here for a search?\nMS. SMITH: They ultimately did, Your Honor,\nbut that consideration of getting a warrant was also\nat play in Matlock and, I think, in Rodriguez. And\nthe point is, if one has valid consent, you don't have\nto get a warrant. They --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But that's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but that's the --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- the issue. Is it\nvalid consent when the co-owner, the husband, is there\nand says, \"No, you don't\"?\nMS. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, I think you --\nwe come back to the fact that he does not have a\nreasonable expectation of absolute or unequivocal\ncontrol --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I guess that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why not? I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that depends on what we\nsay. I'm, frankly, still somewhat surprised at your\nanswer to Justice O'Connor, indicating that it happens\nall the time where there are two occupants, and one\nexpressly says, \"You can't come in,\" and they do\nanyway. But leaving that aside, it seems to me that\nmost of the considerations that would impel a decision\nin your favor can be answered under other doctrines.\nIf there's cocaine that's being used and may be\ndestroyed, there's exigent circumstances. I don't see\nthe necessity for the rule that you propose.\nMS. SMITH: Well, I think, Your Honor, its\nability -- if we're going to have consent, and if\nwe're going to have a third-party-consent rule, then\nthis is an issue that is going to have to be resolved.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're talking about --\nMS. SMITH: I'm --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- reasonable expectations,\nI suppose, here.\nMS. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you assume that it -\n- that it is the reasonable expectation of two people\nwho have -- who are living together in -- on -- in\ncommon premises, that, where one of them wants\nsomebody to come in, and the other one does not want\nsomebody to come in, the person may come in? I would\nthink that the normal assumption is just the opposite,\nthat, where one wants somebody excluded, that person\nwill be excluded.\nMS. SMITH: Well, I think, in the Morning\ncase that was cited in the brief, they realized one\ncan always hope that the other will accede to one's\nwishes. But, this is the dynamics of personal\nbehavior, and I think it comes from an almost\nsubliminal assertion that the person who was saying no\ndoes, in fact, have absolute authority over --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In --\nMS. SMITH: -- that shared --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In Matlock --\nMS. SMITH: -- premises. And that's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In Matlock --\nMS. SMITH: -- that's out of sync --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In Matlock, did the -- did\nthe absent person say no?\nMS. SMITH: He was -- it -- he was silent.\nHe had been arrested --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, you --\nMS. SMITH: -- on the scene --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- you don't even have, in\nMatlock, a situation where you know that one of the\nparties didn't want entry. You don't know that. You\n-- there was one party there, and that party said,\n\"Okay, come in.\" And the other party said, \"Well, if\nI had been consulted, I would have said no,\" or\nwhatever. But --\nMS. SMITH: Well, in -- and even in that\nsituation, Matlock, the reference to the absent\nnonconsenting defendant was in a paragraph where the\ncourt had talked about how it had reserved, in Amos --\nthe Amos case -- the question of whether a wife could\nwaive her husband's rights. And then you had decided\nthe Frazier case, and that was what was described as\nthe nonconsenting absent codefendant in which two\ncousins had shared the use of a duffle bag, and the\ndefendant had left the duffle bag with the cousin. The\ncousin and his mother gave consent for the search.\nAnd it simply was not that the defendant was not\npresent, but this Court found there was mutual use of\nthat bag that gave the cousin the authority to\nconsent. And then, the Court readily rejected\nFrazier's arguments that, \"Well, the cousin could only\nuse one compartment of the duffle bag.\" And you said\nyou wouldn't get into such metaphysical distinctions.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Ms. --\nMS. SMITH: But --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- Ms. Smith, may I -- your\ntime is getting short, and I want to get clear on one\nthing. As I understand it, your argument is not an\nargument that the husband, in this case, lost an\nexpectation of privacy. You are not arguing that he\nhas no right to object. Am I correct on that?\nMS. SMITH: I think, Your Honor, we had\ncalled it a --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, and let me --\nMS. SMITH: -- a reduced --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If that is correct, then\nyour whole argument rests on the fact that, although\nhe has, and may assert, an expectation of privacy,\nthat is irrelevant to the right of his wife to let\npeople, including the police, come into an area which\nis under her control, as well as his. Is that it?\nMS. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMS. SMITH: -- that is. And I think,\nlooking at Justice Stevens' dissent in Rodriguez,\nthere is that recognition of: When you make the\ndecision to share premises with another, you have lost\nthe expectation of exclusive or absolute control --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But your expectation --\nthis is what I'm trying to get at -- your expectation\nis not what governs. You concede, as I understand it,\nthat he still had an expectation, in the sense that he\ncould assert a right of privacy, he can litigate this\ncase, he has standing --\nMS. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- but that his expectation\nis irrelevant to the fact that the wife, in this case,\nwe assume, had the right to admit them to an area\nwhich was under her control, as well as his. Is --\nhave I got it correct?\nMS. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor, I think so.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMS. SMITH: I think that his -- his\nexpectation is unreasonable. And we would urge the\nCourt not to adopt that and enshrine that as the rule\nfor fourth amendment, third-party searches.\nIf there are no further questions, I'll save\nthe remainder --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, you would distinguish\n-- in your answer to Justice Souter -- this is -- this\nis a lawyer. One room in the house is devoted -- is\nhis office.\nMS. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Her permission wouldn't\nextend to that room, would it?\nMS. SMITH: I think it would -- it would\nhave presented a much closer question of -- and\nparticularly given the protection of papers and the\nfact that you may have business papers in there with\nattorney-client privilege -- I think her authority to\nconsent it would have presented a closer question,\nalthough it would still be something to look at under\ntotality of circumstances. She might have operated as\na paralegal. She might have been his secretary. She\nmight have known where he stashed his cocaine under a\nparticular file.\nBut that's not the question we have in this\ncase. We're talking about common areas of a marital\nhome over which both have equal access and control.\nAnd we would urge this Court to recognize that she,\nwith common authority over those premises, has the\nability to admit police and give consent to a search,\nin her own right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMr. Dreeben.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN,\nFOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DREEBEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe law of consent searches is governed by a\ndetermination of what is reasonable for the police to\ndo in a particular circumstance, and it starts from\nthe premise that consent is not a disfavored species\nin the law, that cooperation with law enforcement is a\ngood thing and should be encouraged.\nThe right of the cotenant, in this case, to\nconsent stems from her common authority, which is\nindependent of his and allows her to serve valuable\nsocial interests, as well as interests that represent\nher own personal interest. Many of these cases arise\nnot among couples who are harmonious, but among\ncouples in which there is some degree of tension, and\nthe spouse who consents in these situations has an\nindependent interest in ensuring that she can call\nupon the protection of the law.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But we --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Was --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Go ahead.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was curious,\nthough, which way that fact cut. I can see the\nargument that the closer the relationship, the more\nreasonable it is to say that the one party more or\nless recognizes that their privacy interests are held\nhostage to the views of the other. It's when you get\nthe disrupted relationship, or their adverse\ninterests, that maybe the expectations of privacy, or\nthe reasonableness of one acting as an agent of the\nother, becomes a little more strained.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I\ndon't think that the law in this area is founded on a\nnotion of agency. It's founded on a notion of\nindependent authority of each to grant access to the\npolice, to cooperate with law enforcement with respect\nto premises over which authority is shared. And in a\ncase like this, the wife has an independent interest\nin disassociating herself from criminal activity that\nis going on, on the premises.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But she can do that by\nadvising the police, and then there's probable cause.\nOr, if the husband's there, there are probably\nexigent circumstances.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Kennedy, there may\nwell be other bases to allow law enforcement activity\nto go on, but that presupposes that her authority to\nconsent is somehow qualified: If the police could\nobtain a warrant or some other doctrine, would it\nsupport the search? And this Court has twice rejected\nexactly that approach to the analysis of consent\nsearches.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Dreeben, does this\nauthority to let someone in, over the objection of the\ncohabitant, apply only to policemen, or is it -- is it\nalso the case that -- I don't know, as a matter of,\nwhat, property law, or whatever? -- that when two\npeople have common ownership of a piece of land or a\nhouse or whatever, and one of them says, \"I don't want\na certain party to come on,\" the tie always goes to\nthe other party, who says, \"I do want somebody to come\non,\" is that -- is there any cases that establish that\nproposition? It seems to me an odd proposition. I\nwould have thought the opposite.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, the law of property,\nJustice Scalia, to the extent that it's relevant here,\nwould allow any cotenant to license his or her\ninterest --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But we have not decided\nFourth Amendment issues on the basis of the law of\nproperty, have we?\nMR. DREEBEN: I quite agree, Justice --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Don't we --\nMR. DREEBEN: -- O'Connor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- have to look at social\nunderstanding on right to privacy? And how is it that\nyou can construe, in every instance, a right of a\ncotenant to override the express objections of the\nother cotenant, who's there, and says no? How can you\nsay that's acceptable?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice O'Connor, I\ncertainly do not think that there is any uniform\nsocial understanding that should drive the decision in\nthis case, for two different reasons. First of all, I\nthink, in many circumstances, two people who share\nproperty, and who disagree about whether a guest\nshould be invited, will resolve it in a variety of\ndifferent ways. Somebody might let in a commercial\nvisitor, over the objection of a cotenant, or someone\n--\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, that's possible,\nbut you have a case here where the wife says, \"Come\nin,\" and the husband is right there and says, \"No, you\ncan't.\"\nMR. DREEBEN: And I think that the other\nfactor that the Court needs to consider in evaluating\nthis is not just social expectations with respect to\nnon-law-enforcement events and visitors, but this\npositive, affirmative social interest in encouraging\ncooperation with the law, which is something that she\nhas the ability to do with respect to property over\nwhich she has common authority.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- well, you keep\nsaying that, but that policy is -- can be vindicated\nby using doctrines other than consent. And you want\nus to -- I think you want us to say, I think we have\nto say, that there's a general social expectation that\nthe person who wants entry overrides the person who\ndoesn't.\nMR. DREEBEN: I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I also agree with\nJustice Scalia, that social expectation may be, in\npart, measured by our cases on this subject. And I\njust don't see how, if it's against the interest of an\noccupant to allow entry, that that -- that that\ninterest must, necessarily, be overridden.\nMR. DREEBEN: I think that what the Court\nneeds to do is look at the consent-search doctrine in\nrelation to third-party consents, generally. Matlock\nmakes quite clear that if the objecting -- potentially\nobjecting party, the target of the search, does not\nvoice an objection, then the third party has full\nauthority to allow the search, even if they're --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, yes, but there's\nkind of an assumption there that if the cotenant is\nnot there, sure, you'll let the tenant who is there\ncall the shots.\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't think that, on the\nfacts of either Matlock or Rodriguez, that would be a\nparticularly logical or reasonable assumption. In\nMatlock, you're dealing with a man who was arrested\nfor bank robbery in the front lawn of his house, the\npolice take him to a police car, put him in a police\ncar, do not ask him for consent; instead, they go back\nand they ask the woman, with whom he is living at the\nhouse, for consent to search.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask --\nMR. DREEBEN: Rodriguez is even more\ndramatic, because, in Rodriguez, the victim of a\nbattery, Gail Fischer, seeks out the police and says,\n\"I want you to arrest Rodriguez,\" and brings him to\nthe -- to -- the police to the apartment, where they\nenter and arrest Rodriguez. Surely, if Rodriguez had\nbeen asked, or if Matlock had been asked, the\npresumption is, they would have objected.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask two questions?\nSeems to me you're -- if we're using social analogies\nin what happens, I imagine that it would make a\ndifference if the person who wants to -- who was\ninvited in by the wife, is larger or smaller than the\nhusband.\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And I think he probably\nwould not go in if he thought he was a -- could not do\nso --\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- in his physical\nencounter. And the problem with your case here is,\nthe police officer is always larger than the\nhomeowner, and he always has the power to override any\nphysical objection. So, I think that the -- the\nactual social situation will vary tremendously from\ndifferent facts as to the fair -- and yet, we're\nlooking for a rule that applies equally across the\nboard --\nMR. DREEBEN: Well --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- in this case.\nMR. DREEBEN: At --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And the second question I\nwant you to address at the same time is, What if this\nwas a suitcase that they both owned? They stopped in\nthe airport. The wife says, \"I don't want you to open\nit,\" and her husband says, \"Go ahead and open it,\" or\nvice versa.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Stevens, the\nsecond one is the easier one. The same rule applies.\nAnyone who has common authority over the suitcase\nshould be able to cooperate with law enforcement to\nvindicate both the social interest in cooperating with\na law enforcement request and the interests of the\nperson's who's making it. And I think that that's\nwhat Matlock is all about.\nNow, as for the attempt to mirror --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Matlock is the reasonable\npolice -- well, go ahead. I shouldn't interrupt.\nMR. DREEBEN: The attempt to transpose\nordinary social understandings from a myriad of\ninfinitely varied settings that do not involve law\nenforcement, I submit, will not correctly allow this\nCourt to calibrate what it should be doing, which is\nbalancing the individual interests in privacy against\nthe social interests that affirmatively encourage and\nvalidate the use of consent. And I think what Matlock\ndoes, to put this case in context, is to illustrate\nthat if the police had waited until Respondent had\nleft his house to go to work, or to go to court, or to\ndo anything else, or if he had stayed there and gone\nto sleep at night, then Matlock tells us that she\nwould have full authority to allow the police into the\nhouse to conduct a search of common areas. And, for\nthis Court to announce a rule that says, no, when the\nperson is there on the scene and vocalizes an\nobjection, which we can reasonably presume that he\nwould have if he was given the opportunity to voice\nit, would mean that police simply have an incentive to\nfind a different way to accomplish the same end. And\nI would submit that that does not give adequate --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The \"different way,\" of\ncourse, would be to get a warrant.\nMR. DREEBEN: An option would be to get a\nwarrant in cases where the police do have probable\ncause, but, as this Court recognized in Schneckloth\nversus Bustamonte, the courts -- the officers will not\nalways have probable cause.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would they, on -- in --\non these facts -- I thought not, but perhaps I was\nwrong -- the -- when the police come to the house,\nthey don't suspect anything about cocaine. Wife then\naccuses husband of being a cocaine user. So, that's\nthe first information the police have. Could they get\na warrant, just on her say-so? In fact, they got the\nstraw that had the cocaine residue on it. They went\nto the magistrate with that straw, and he gave them a\nwarrant. But if they had nothing but the wife's\naccusation, \"He -- he's a cocaine user,\" would that\namount to probable cause?\nMR. DREEBEN: I think it clearly would,\nJustice Ginsburg. And the facts in this --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: It would, or would not?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It would?\nMR. DREEBEN: It would amount to probable\ncause if the wife, who has -- she's in a position\nwhere she would know what's going on in the house,\nwhat kind of activity is going on in the house, she is\na presumptively reliable citizen providing information\nto the police, and the fact --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All she said is, \"He's a\ncocaine user.\" Does that -- does that -- does that\ngive probable cause to believe that there are -- you\nknow, that there's contraband on the premises or --\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, that's not all she said,\nJustice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh.\nMR. DREEBEN: What she said was that there\nwere items of drug evidence --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. DREEBEN: -- in the house. And if you\nlook at the warrant that the officers obtained, it\nmore clearly elaborates that she said there were drugs\nand paraphernalia. But, for the Court's purposes,\nthis case is virtually identical to Illinois versus\nMcArthur with respect to the probable cause. You have\na wife and a husband who are in a domestic dispute,\nand the wife comes out, in Illinois versus McArthur,\nand tells the officers, you know, \"He's got drugs\ninside there.\" And the Court was unanimous, I\nbelieve, on the point that that furnished probable\ncause. But what is different from Illinois versus\nMcArthur, and this case, is that the police officers\nhave the consent of someone who reasonably appears to\nthem to have common authority, someone who's living in\nthe marital home, someone who is in a position to know\nwhat's going on and exercise her own independent\nauthority. And for this Court to say, \"Well, there\nare alternatives\" -- you know, the police could pull\nRespondent out of the house and quarantine it while\nthey go get a warrant, or the police could do other\ninvestigation, or they could rely on exigent\ncircumstances -- what that does is treats her consent\nas worth nothing. It reduces her --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, not nothing,\nbecause we have cases that have said: If the co-\ninhabitant is not there, he relinquishes whatever\nright he had to object. But if the co-inhabitant is\nthere, and says no, what's the matter with giving\neffect to that?\nMR. DREEBEN: I think it's very odd to say\nthat, in Matlock, the right was relinquished, when\nMatlock was arrested and taken to a police car and was\nnever asked for consent, or that Rodriguez\nrelinquished his right by falling asleep in his own\napartment. What really -- I would qualify my\nstatement, though, in response to your comment,\nJustice O'Connor. It's not that it treats it as\nnothing. It would treat her consent as 100 percent\nvalid when he's asleep or absent, no matter how much\nwe know he would object, and it would treat it as zero\nwhen he's on the scene and vocalizes an objection.\nAnd I think that that would protect Fourth Amendment\nrights only by happenstance, or, worse, it would\nsimply be an invitation to the --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but it's by\nhappenstance that the police find the wife in the\nhouse. I mean, it's six of one, half a dozen of the\nother. It's a happenstance.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, in this case, as in many\nother cases involving this kind of potential incident,\nthe wife called the police to the scene. So, there\nwas a reason for them to be on the scene. It was a\nperfectly valid investigatory step. And once they\nacquired the information relating to drugs on the\npremises, and had the authority of someone who's in\ncharge of the premises, I submit that the police\nshould be able to conduct the search as a reasonable\nmatter under the Fourth Amendment, just as they would\nif Respondent had been asleep or if Respondent had\nsaid, \"Well, I have to go now. Am I free to go?\" and\nthe police said that, \"You are.\"\nAnd I don't think that it always would be an\nadvantage for the nonconsenting tenant, somebody like\nMr. Randolph, to insist on the police getting a\nwarrant or conducting a probable-cause arrest. If\nhe's arrested, he's taken down to the station, he has\na search incident to arrest, he may not get a hearing\nfor 48 hours. If the police do have to get a warrant,\nthey are entitled to search anywhere and everywhere in\nthe premises; whereas, in this case, one of\nRespondent's main claims is that she wasn't credible.\nWell, if she wasn't credible, and she had led the\npolice upstairs, and the police had found nothing,\nthat might have been the end of the whole incident.\nAnd I think that it's because of the socially valuable\nfunction of efficiently resolving accusations,\npotentially dueling accusations of criminal conduct\nthat consent searches can facilitate, that this Court\nhas said that consent searches are a positive social\ngood and should be encouraged, rather than\ndiscouraged.\nJUSTICE THOMAS: Mr. Dreeben, is it -- is\nthis case materially different if she simply ran\nupstairs, grabbed the straw, brought it down, and\nhanded it to the police officer? It's, in effect, the\nsame thing, isn't it?\nMR. DREEBEN: It is, in effect, the same\nthing. And I think that, had that happened, there\nwould have been no question that, assuming that the\npolice reasonably believed that she had authority to\ndo it, and possibly even if they didn't, the\ncontraband would have come into the hands of law\nenforcement, and there is really no reason, or\ndoctrine under the Fourth Amendment, to deny it.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You want us to take the\nposition that there's no legal difference between, (a)\nentering a home and taking something, and, (b)\nreceiving it on the outside?\nMR. DREEBEN: I think that the difference,\nwhen you receive something with the consent of someone\nwho has the authority to exercise control over it, is\na question of whether she leads the police upstairs,\nor whether she brings the item downstairs. And, for\nFourth Amendment purposes, I don't see a difference.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nDreeben.\nMr. Goldstein.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nThe Court should hold that it is not\nreasonable for officers to conduct a consent search\nwhen a person with an equivalent interest in the\npremises expressly objects.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the\ntelephone call between a husband and wife, and the\nwife tells the police, \"Listen in on this call\"?\nShe's consented to the monitoring of the conversation,\nthe husband has not. Maybe he even begins the call by\nsaying, \"I -- don't let anybody else listen to this.\"\nIt's clear that that is admissible, isn't it?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It is, Mr. Chief Justice,\nalthough not on the theory of third-party consent.\nThe analog to your hypothetical, which is this Court's\ndecision in Lopez, is Justice Thomas' reference to\nCoolidge versus New Hampshire -- to the New Hampshire\ncase. And what happens there is, this -- Mrs.\nRandolph could take the cocaine and give it to the\nofficer. She was participating in giving an item to\nthem. It is not the same, I think, when she\nauthorizes the police to conduct a generalized search\nof the premises. It would be as if --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: She's consenting.\nIt's an intrusion, in the one case, on the\nconversation; in the other case, on the home. In the\ntelephone case, it's recognized, in the law, the\nconsent of one party subjects the other to having the\nconversation monitored. In this case, the consent of\none party subjects the other party to the search.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: But -- yes, Mr. Chief\nJustice. I do think that Lopez and White, in that\nline of cases, established that other things that\npeople do consent to can expose us to intrusions on\nour property. What I think, however, is, it doesn't\nfollow that she can authorize the -- them to conduct a\ngeneralized search of the premises. It's as if she\nwere saying, \"You can listen in on\" --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: -- \"all the phone calls\" --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Excuse me.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: -- \"in the house.\"\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It was -- it was the -- it\nwas a search only of premises with respect to which\nshe had, supposedly, common rights. I mean, we take\nthe case on that assumption.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: You do --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: -- Justice Souter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If she and her husband, you\nknow -- if she had a right to be in only two rooms,\nshe couldn't authorize the search of the whole house,\nright?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: -- correct. But, Justice\nSouter, I think the thing that is important -- and I\nwant to get to your line of questioning about exactly\nwhat the nature of the State's argument is -- is that\nhe had a distinct individual right to privacy at the\ncore of the home, as opposed to, for example,\ninformation privacy.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right, then he --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- if he --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- begs the question\n-- it begs the question to say \"it's a distinct\nindividual right to privacy.\" It's a little academic\nto talk about his individual right to privacy when\nhe's sharing the home with someone else.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, that's\nwhy I finished off on that. Let me just focus on the\nimportant part of my statement. And that is, we are\ntalking about a search of the home, at the core of the\nFourth Amendment. This Court's doctrines are quite\ndifferent about situations in which you share\ninformation with third parties.\nLet me step back and do the case before\nLopez, and then explain how it was extended to Lopez.\nCases like White say, \"If you give information to\nsomeone else, you -- they can give it to the police\nwithout conducting a search of you.\" This is a very\ndifferent situation. The police are clearly\nconducting a search of a premises that I think,\nJustice Souter, it has to be agreed, he has a\nreasonable expectation of privacy with respect to.\nNow, Justice Souter, it is absolutely right\nthat there are instances in which people have\nexpectations of privacy, and yet searches occur,\nnotwithstanding those. And there is an argument to be\nmade here that says, \"Look, he has a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy, but the police came in for a\ndifferent reason.\" That would be true, for example,\nif there was a warrant; they would come in,\nnotwithstanding his reasonable expectation. That\nwould be true if there were exigent circumstances.\nBut the theory of consent is very different.\nSchneckloth, Zap, all of the Court's precedents --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it -- let me make\nsure I understand where you're going. We agree that\nhe had a reason -- everybody agrees, I guess, that he\nhas a reasonable expectation. He can -- he can raise\nhis Fourth Amendment claim. Your argument is that,\neven though we get past the reasonable expectation,\nthere's a second reasonableness question, and that is,\nIs the search, itself, reasonable?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Good guess.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And that's the focus of\nyour argument --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Exactly --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- correct?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: -- right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: But I do think it's\nimportant, of course, this Court's precedents have\noften said that the degree of the expectation informs\nthe reasonableness of the search. A consent --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: -- search is reasonable.\nReasonableness, or course, is a balance --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Well, I -- the\nwords that keep going around in my mind -- it's her\nhouse, too, isn't it?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, she wants the\npoliceman in. So, why does he have more of a right to\nkeep the policeman out than she has to have the\npoliceman in?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I think everybody makes\ntheir --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And vice versa.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. I think that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: -- that's the point --\n[Laughter.]\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: -- is that -- that everybody\nmakes some -- there are two things.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Everybody makes some\nsacrifices.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: -- right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- let's think --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: And so, he --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- of the need for this,\nbecause it's the other thing that's on my mind. The\ntwo words that came into my mind are \"spousal abuse.\"\nAll right? I would say maybe there's a pretty good\nneed for this. The husband's beating her up. And\nthere isn't evidence of that, but she's sitting in the\nkitchen table, and the neighbors hear something odd,\nand they call the police. \"We'd better look into it.\"\nThey come to the door. She says, \"Um, hmmm, oh, I'd\nlike, Officer, for you to just come upstairs to my\nbedroom for a minute.\" Is there any neighbor, friend,\nor policeman, in those circumstances, who wouldn't go?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Breyer, because\nshe's not authorizing a search -- she wants them to\ncome in and talk to her, wherever, in the house --\nthat might be a different case. The two words --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no. It's the question\nof the rule. I haven't seen anything on your side\nthat would advocate a rule that would not prevent the\nmany, many, many, I believe -- I am not an expert --\nambiguous cases of domestic spousal abuse from being\ninvestigated by the policeman. And maybe you can tell\nme you've looked into it empirically and I'm wrong,\nand that's why I'm bringing it up.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. Okay. I have, and I\ncan. Since 1974, when this Court decided Matlock, the\nFederal and State courts, combined, have considered\nthis question. And so, there was a finding of\nevidence, and it led to a suppression hearing. That's\nthe best that I can do. Fifteen times, all the\nFederal and State courts, once every two years. It is\nthe case that in that -- in -- last year alone, there\nwere 200,000 domestic disputes that were reported.\nBut that's just the city of Chicago.\nWhat we're considering here is the situation\nin which there is no real need for the police to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, but -- no, I'm not\ngetting your answer. Are you telling me that it is\nthe law in Chicago, for example, that if a policeman\nresponds to a call, a call of -- it's ambiguous --\nwhat it says is, \"An anonymous caller said there's an\nodd situation next door. Will you check out 2355\nMaple Street?\" He goes there. The wife looks a\nlittle oddly at him, but they're sitting at the table,\nand she says, \"Officer, I'd like you to come upstairs\nwith me.\" The husband says no. Are you saying that\nthe law is clear in Chicago that the policeman can't\ndo it?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No. What I'm --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Where --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: -- saying is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- is it clear that the\npoliceman cannot do it?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, Your Honor, the -- it\nis an unresolved question of --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fine.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: -- this Court. It's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's what --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: -- equally divided --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- I thought it was not\nclear. And, therefore, what I'm asking you for is --\nif your rule --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- is the law --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- there are 200,000 cases\na year in Chicago, alone. I think that there might be\nmany ambiguous cases. So, you relieve me of my\nconcern that if you win this case, in those ambiguous\nsituations, where the wife wants the policeman in, and\nshe's afraid to tell him why, until she gets him up to\nthe room -- she wants him in -- and he, now under your\nrule, as far as I can see, could not go in. And I'm\ntelling you, quite frankly, that's what bothers me a\nlot.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: All right. Let me answer\nthis on several different levels. First, there is no\nserious argument that we interfere with investigating\nabuse claims. The conversation can happen. It may\nnot happen, arguably, in a place that he has a right\nto privacy, but it can happen outside. It happens\noutside all the time. If there is any suggestion that\na reasonable officer would believe that there was an\nongoing crime, there was abuse going on right then,\nthen it's clear that exigent circumstances would\nauthorize the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: There aren't exigent\ncircumstances. In the case I'm thinking of, I'm\nthinking of what I call \"ambiguity,\" and there are\nmany such cases, I believe, of spousal abuse, where\nthe wife is intimidated. Now, maybe I'm wrong on my\nfacts, but those are the cases I'm worried about.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Breyer, I am not an\nexpert in spousal abuse; and so, I'm not -- which I\nthink is a very serious issue. I do know one thing\nabout my rule, and that is that, under our rule, and\nunder the rule that the Georgia Supreme Court\narticulated, they are allowed to speak with her,\nincluding speaking to her outside. It's true, there\nmay be some sacrifice. And you have identified a\nsacrifice. And that is, she can't take them into a\nroom in which he has a constitutional expectation of\nprivacy. I will concede that if he says, \"I don't\nwant you in the bedroom,\" that will be a sacrifice.\nBut what I am saying is that there is no serious\nargument that they can't have the conversation in a\nplace where she feels secure. That's on the porch,\nthat's in a police car.\nIf she says, \"I need you to come up,\" and\nthere's been abuse, then what would have happened in\nthis case -- let me explain what happened in this\ncase. The officers asked Mr. Randolph first. He said\nno. They found out -- had found out from her that\nthere was drug paraphernalia on the premises. What\nthey had to do in order to conduct this search -- if\nthey wanted to search, rather than having her bring\nthe materials out -- is to pick up the phone and get a\ntelephonic warrant, which would have taken less than 5\nminutes.\nThe real reason I bring to your attention\nthe 200,000 domestic disturbances is that what you\nshould be concerned about, I think, is not the 15\ncases, which is not a serious intrusion on law\nenforcement interests over 30 years, but it's the many\ntimes in which our family relationships ebb and flow.\nWe are concerned here with the person -- the Fourth\nAmendment is -- it's not the person who has the drugs\nor the abuser. Consent searches involve a situation\nin which the police come to the door, and they say,\n\"Can we search?\" Because they do as much as they are\npermitted to do. And the person just says, \"Sure,\"\nperhaps completely ignorant of her rights. There's no\nreason to believe anything is going on. And what the\nState's position is, is that, despite the fact that\nthis is the home, and that the core of the\nconstitutional right to privacy in the text of the\nFourth Amendment is that the only thing he can do to\nbe secure in the language of the Constitution is not\nlive with someone else. Remember, the theory --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, all --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you're --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- reflects is the -\n-\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Go on.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was just going to\nsay, it just reflects the expectation of privacy. And\nwhen you do live with someone else, you compromise\nyour individual privacy interest to that extent. We\nknow that you compromise it to the extent that if you\nhappen not to be there, and that person says, \"Sure,\ncome on in and search,\" that's going to bind you, as\nwell. Why is it -- why do you not compromise the\nexpectation to the extent of giving the other person\nthe right to consent?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, I do\nthink you've put your finger on it.\nAnd I just want to say, Justice Souter, that\nI do think that the other side's argument inevitably\ndoes revolve around this notion of an expectation of\nprivacy.\nAnd, Mr. Chief Justice, I think the\nexpectation is -- and this is what the Court said in\nMinnesota versus Carter -- that, while it's\ntechnically possible that the people -- Minnesota\nversus Olson, I'm sorry -- the people that we live\nwith will admit others over our objection, our\nexpectation about what -- about what will happen, our\nreasonable expectation, is different. And I also want\nto take --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but Olson was a\nstanding case. Olson was not confronting this\nsituation. In Olson, the police simply went in\nwithout a warrant. And the argument was made that\nthis person was not the normal inhabitant of the --\nwhat was he? A houseguest or something of the sort.\nAnd the only issue that Olson addressed was his right\nto raise a Fourth Amendment claim. It did not respond\nto the issue that you are raising, which is the\nreasonable extent of search.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Souter, that's why\nI, sort of, paused and came to you. And that is, I do\nthink that the other side's argument -- I want to say\ntwo things. One is that it inevitably reduces to the\nidea that we have a lessened expectation of --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I don't --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: -- privacy --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I don't see that --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- at all.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: They concede -- the only\nexpectation of privacy you've got to have for Fourth\nAmendment purposes in order to raise a claim is a\nminimal one -- they concede that the -- that this\nindividual has an expectation of privacy sufficient to\nraise a Fourth Amendment claim.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: But --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Their argument is that,\nalthough he can raise it, the rights, however they may\nbe derived on the part of his wife, allowed her to\nadmit the police -- in effect, thwarting his\nexpectations. Your argument, as I understand it, is\nthat when the police search with that kind of\npermission, over his objection, it's not a reasonable\nsearch. Isn't that the way to structure the issue?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Souter, I think it\nis. I will only say, in my defense, that their brief\narticulates it in the manner that I was describing it,\nI think, with the Chief Justice. But let me --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: -- let me --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- I -- I agree with you.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. All right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: There is this talk about\nlessened --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- expectation, and I -- I\nthink, ultimately, that's irrelevant.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: All right. Let me look at\nit through the other lens. And that is from the\nperspective of a reasonable police officer. I think\nthere are two points to make. The first is, I -- the\ncommon ground between the sides in the case is, you\nlook at it from the perspective of the person who\narrives at the house, and you ask what is reasonable.\nAnd if someone arrives at the house, it is a\ndifferent matter entirely if, as in Matlock or in\nRodriguez, someone says, \"Come on in,\" and they -- you\nbelieve they have authority over the premises, versus\nyou come to the house and someone with authority over\nthe premises says, \"Come on in,\" and the other person\nsays, \"No, stay out.\"\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Now what's your --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's not a\nfair reading of Rodriguez. There, it was, \"Come on\nin, he's asleep.\" It was quite clear that if he were\nawake, he was going to say, \"Don't come in.\"\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, the\nGovernment has argued successfully in this Court that\nwe don't make any assumptions about whether people\nwill consent or not. There are innumerable cases in\nthe lower courts --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, maybe we don't, but\nisn't there -- isn't the -- isn't Mr. Dreeben's\nargument fair that no one in his right mind would have\nexpected Matlock to agree to this? It is clear that\nMatlock, had he known what was going on -- and he may\nhave; I don't know -- would have objected? So that if\nwe accept your argument that the presence of the\nperson there expressing an objection is what makes the\ndifference, then Matlock and Rodriguez become almost\nsilly cases. They are -- they are -- they're cases\nthat rest upon an assumption that is clearly contrary\nto fact.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No, Justice Souter. And\nthat is, the Government has argued, and this Court has\naccepted, again -- and this is a different point; and\nthat is, you have to have a clear line for police\nofficers that is administrable. And the line that is\nreflected in Matlock and Rodriguez is: If you get\nconsent to come into the house from someone who has\nthe common authority to do so, that will be\nsufficient, but that doesn't mean that if some -- and\nso, you don't have to go around and -- finding other\npeople and asking other people. It's just as if you\nshowed up at a house, and you were invited in. You\nwouldn't say, \"Well, let me check with everybody else\"\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Sure, but --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: -- \"who lives here.\"\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- an equally clear line\nwould simply be that, if the area to be searched is\none of common tenancy or occupation or whatnot, the\nonly consent that will suffice will be the consent of\nthe person against whom you expect to use any evidence\nfound. Easy clear line.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It's true, Justice Souter,\nthere are a lot of possible clear lines. What I'm\ndescribing to you is why the difference between\nMatlock and this case is one in kind, and that is that\nMatlock, I think, reflects an administrable rule, and\nthat is, if you do have permission from someone who\nhas the authority to admit you, you don't have to go\nask anybody else.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: But that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But an equally\nadministrable rule here is that, even though the\nperson you suspect objects, you can still go in, if a\nperson with authority otherwise says you can. Equally\nclear rule, and it has one advantage: It does not\nturn Matlock and Rodriguez into silly cases.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Souter, I don't\nthink they're silly cases. I think that it is an\nimportant rule that the police show up and they are\nable to rely -- if they only hear from one person,\nthey're able to rely on that person. I don't -- the -\n- I'm not claiming that our rule has great\nadministrative advantages over the other side's. What\nI'm saying is that it is not necessary to sacrifice\nthe individual's privacy who lives in the house -- as\nyou say, has an expectation of privacy. And so, let\nme return --\nJUSTICE BREYER: An expectation of privacy.\nI have a lingering question here I'd like to get your\nview on. I don't know what the expectation is, is my\nproblem. If I think of social -- I've never been in a\nsituation, frankly, where one person said, \"Stay out,\"\nand the other said, \"Come in.\" So, I don't know what\nI'd do. If I imagine myself in a normal social\nsituation, I think probably, if I am the typical\nperson, which may or may not be, I --\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- I think I'd say, \"Well,\nyou know, I don't want to have anything to do with\nthis.\" If it's a dinner party, forget it. But if I'm\nin a situation such as the police might be involved\nin, where I think there is some danger, there is\nsomething wrong in the house, there's something odd\nabout it, I don't think the average person would just\nsay, \"I'm going away.\" I think the average person\neither would come in, or he'd say, \"I'll come in for a\nwhile. I'm going to call the police,\" or they're --\nyou just wouldn't have that reaction, \"I want nothing\nto do with it.\" That's the reaction, you know --\nthat's a bad reaction, when you want nothing to do\nwith a dangerous situation. So, I think, in that\nsituation, the normal reaction would be, \"I'm going\nin,\" or, \"I'm going to get some help,\" or, \"I'm going\nto get a friend,\" or, \"I'm going to call the police.\"\nSo, I don't know you do have expectations of\nthat kind, in those situations, though you might with\na dinner party.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Breyer, I think\nthat's why it's important that our rule is not that\nthe police should go away. We call for a balance\nhere, and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I want you to address\nthe question of how the legal category of \"reasonable\nexpectation of privacy\" fits in with what I just said,\nwhere I'm assuming, in some social situations, you do\nthink you'd be left alone; but, in the typical\nsituation, stretching well beyond, but certainly\nincluding, situations of danger where the police might\nbe involved, you wouldn't have an expectation that you\nwill be left alone. I want to know how those facts,\nif they are facts -- and you can say they were not --\nfit within the category called \"reasonable expectation\nof privacy.\"\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Breyer, the Court\nhas precedent on this very point, and that is -- and,\nJustice Souter, he is asking about reasonable\nexpectations of privacy -- Minnesota versus Olson.\nThe Court considered this and said the very reason\nthat person had standing and could -- had a Fourth\nAmendment right is because they did have a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy in the premises, that, even\nthough they had no property rights to keep any -- this\nis the overnight guest -- had no property rights to\nkeep anybody out at all, their expectation -- their\nreasonable expectation of privacy for Fourth Amendment\npurposes -- is that if somebody wanted to come in, to\nwhich they objected, that objection would be honored.\nNow, I don't want to lose sight of the fact\nthat our position is the balance; and that is, we\ndon't tell the police to go away. We say, \"Look, if\nshe tells you that there's contraband in the house,\nshe can bring it out.\" That's the Coolidge case.\nAnd I do think, Justice Thomas, that there\nis a difference in kind, not degree, in giving\nsomething to someone and then having -- versus having\na uncabined search of a house. The complaint --\nJUSTICE THOMAS: The -- but this was not an\nuncabined search. That's my problem. What you're --\nwhat you're -- the bottom, you're saying to us, is\nthat it's not unreasonable -- an unreasonable search\nif she went upstairs and brought the straw down,\nright?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, because that's not a\nsearch.\nJUSTICE THOMAS: Okay. But you're saying it\nis an unreasonable search for her to lead the police\nofficer to the straw.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice --\nJUSTICE THOMAS: Which is what she did.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Thomas, it's how it\nplayed out, because they stopped the search then,\nbecause she withdrew her consent. But what she\nauthorized was something very different. She --\nJUSTICE THOMAS: But she withdrew it after\nhe observed the straw.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, Justice Thomas, that's\nabsolutely correct. My point, instead, is that what\nhappened here, in terms of the consent, and what the\nState's rule of law would authorize, and what Matlock\nand Rodriguez authorize if they're extended to this\npoint, is not, \"Take me to the drugs,\" which is an\ninteresting proposition, but, instead, \"Go ahead and\nsearch the whole house.\" So, our point, Justice\nBreyer is, \"Look, don't leave. Get a telephonic\nwarrant. It takes 5 minutes. If you know there's\nsomething in the house, bring it out. If you have\nanything to -- any reason to believe there's ongoing\ncriminality, seal the house.\"\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, any reason to believe\n--\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Of --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- but --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Sorry.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- you can't enter without\nprobable cause.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's a -- with\nexigent circumstances.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose you have\nsuspicions of a domestic problem that's ongoing. It's\nshort of probable cause, but you have reasonable\nsuspicion. Does that alter the nonconsenting party's\ninterest and elevate the consenting party's interest?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Kennedy, I don't\nthink that it does. Our view of the law is that the\nquestion is, When the property rights are -- and their\n-- their control over the property, I should say; I\ndon't mean to invoke the common law -- when the\ncontrol over the property is equivalent, then, in that\ntie, if you will, the Fourth Amendment controls. If -\n- there are doctrines designed to protect against\nsituations in which you have concerns about ongoing\ncriminality and protecting people. But that's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you talk about\nthat tie, your approach applies in the case -- a\ndormitory, you have a common room, there are ten rooms\noff of it, nine people say, \"Sure, come on in and\nsearch,\" and the one person says, \"No.\" That one\nperson exercises a veto over a search of the common\narea?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, the\nstraightforward rule that I have argued for today is\nthat if you have an equivalent interest in the\npremises -- it is, of course, the State's rule that,\nif nine people object, Matlock says that any one of\nthem can let them in, and an individual can override\nthe objections of everybody else in the house. What\nI'm saying, I think, just to return to the basics, is,\nI do think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- well, what\nis your answer --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I'm sorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- to that case?\nYour case is that, if one out of ten who share the\ncommon room says to the police, \"You may not come in,\"\nthat controls?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I don't think that has to\nfollow from our rule. It's true, we have articulated\none broad rule that would allow the Fourth Amendment\nto control, but I think if we analogize to the social\nsituation -- if you said to yourself, \"What do you\nexpect will happen if nine people that you live with\nwant to let in someone and you're the only one who's\ngoing to object?\" -- I think it would be perfectly\nreasonable to say to -- that individual expects the --\nthem to come in.\nJustice Souter, let me return -- I want to\nmake sure I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the -- I -- you assume\nwe got -- there goes the -- that -- there goes any\nbright line administrable rule, I guess.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Souter, I honestly\ndon't think that's true. I think that Illinois versus\nRodriguez, on this question, which is assessing the\ndegree of the authority over the premises, does call\nfor a \"totality of the circumstances\" inquiry.\nI also don't know that I fully answered your\npoint, that we look at this question from the\nperspective of the officer and the reasonableness of\nthe search. And let me just say that, in Matlock and\nin Rodriguez, the Court's analysis was that it's\nreasonable, because the person whose privacy is\nintruded on has assumed some risk. The Court does\nlook to the privacy interests of the person who is\nultimately the defendant. That's a -- an element of\nthe reasonableness inquiry. And our point,\nfundamentally, is that it cannot be the case that when\nthe framers enacted the Fourth Amendment so that you\ncould live with other people and have a private space\naway from the Government, that you, merely by living\nwith your family, assume the risk that your privacy\nwill be lost. That assumption of the risk --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, can I just take\nthe next step in my hypothetical? The wife and the\ntwo adult children who live in the home say, \"Come on\nin,\" and the husband says, \"No.\" What happens then?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: On our broadest rule, the\nhusband would control, although it doesn't follow,\nfrom our -- that, to affirm the judgment, you have to\nsay that, because I think you could say that,\nreasonably, the person realizes they would be\noutvoted. But I do think the children is an important\npoint.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Reasonably, the\nperson realizes he would be outvoted?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, it does go to\nhis presumably objectively reasonable views of what\nnature of privacy he has.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. And what --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, if he thinks,\n\"Look, I've been having a bad time with my wife. I\nthink she's going to consent and let the police in if\nI'm not\" -- then his objection shouldn't control?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, when -- I\nagree with you objectively. This Court didn't, for\nexample, in Matlock and Rodriguez, look at the\nparticular family dynamics at that time. It looks to\nbroader social understandings.\nI did want to return to your \"children\"\npoint. Remember -- and I think this is a vital point\n-- and that is, the Courts of Appeals uniformly\nconclude, after Matlock and Rodriguez, that children\nare residents, which is the inquiry in Illinois versus\nRodriguez, and they can give consent to search a home.\nIt necessarily follows that if you extend that rule,\nMatlock and Rodriguez, to this case, that children,\nbecause they have the authority to admit the police --\nminor children, 12, 14, 15 -- can then authorize the\nsearch, notwithstanding the objection of the parents.\nNow, if everyone agrees, \"That can't be right, it's\nthe parents' home,\" that's because we are assessing --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the case that\nsays that, that the child's invitation overrides the\nparents' objection?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Ginsburg, that\nquestion hasn't been confronted by any court we've\nchecked. But what I -- what the Courts of Appeals\nhave confronted repeatedly, and uniformly agree -- and\nit's in our brief -- is that children satisfy the\nMatlock and Rodriguez --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: -- standard.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- would a mother-in-law.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they don't have\nthe same -- they don't have the same property interest\nas a spouse does, as a tenant in common or whatever.\nThe child doesn't have that interest in the home.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, that's\nright, but, of course, that's not the inquiry under\nMatlock and Rodriguez. If we take your point, then we\nare definitely moving beyond Matlock and Rodriguez.\nWe're going to have to look to more. And my point is\nthat, if we do look to more than simply the fact that\nthe officers have found someone, however ignorant, has\nthe ability to consent in their own right, if we're\ngoing to assess the other factors, the rule should\nlook -- the Court should look to what the ordinary\nsocial understandings and --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Goldstein, your time\nis almost up, but I want to know if you place any\nweight at all on the fact that the husband was the\ntarget in this case. The target said, \"No,\" and the\none who wasn't under suspicion said, \"Yes.\" Does that\nmake any difference?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: The -- I do not believe, as\na matter of doctrine, that it does. I do think,\nhowever, that it informs this Court's analysis of\nreasonableness, in the sense that the Court, in\nSchneckloth, said, \"We are not going to allow consent\nto circumvent the requirements of getting a warrant.\"\nAnd it is the case -- we have to inescapably agree, I\nthink, that this is simply a way of getting around the\nwarrant requirement. They wanted to find out\nsomething about him. He had a privacy interest in the\npremises. He said, \"No.\" The Constitution says, \"You\nhave somebody who's cooperating with you. Let them\ntell you what's going on in the house.\" And Illinois\nversus McArthur says, \"Seal off the premises.\" In\nfact, Illinois versus McArthur is -- the very point of\nthe Court in that case was that it's much better to\nseal the premises and get a warrant, which will define\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: Was there anybody in that\ncase who -- since I wrote it, I guess I'm supposed to\nknow it in detail, but I don't --\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and I thought, was --\nthere was no one -- no consent there. There was\nnobody giving consent, was there?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Oh, Justice --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Was there?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Breyer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'll go back and read it.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: -- she said, \"I think you\nshould\" -- she said --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'll reread it.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. She said, \"I think\nyou should go in there and get it.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: Uh-huh.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: But, inescapably, what's\ngoing on, there are -- I think that this is not a case\nthat follows, necessarily, from Matlock and Rodriguez.\nAnd there is a bright line to be drawn, and that is,\nyou are going to have to not live with your family,\nwhich is precisely what the Fourth Amendment is about,\nin order not to assume the risk of the police coming\nin. The reasonableness determination is a balancing\nof law enforcement and privacy interests. The privacy\ninterests are very high. The police can easily get a\ntelephonic warrant or have the materials brought out\nto them. It is not necessary to take this case, when\nso rarely has it been that the police have needed to\nuse this authority.\nIf there are no further questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nGoldstein.\nMs. Smith, you have a minute and a half\nremaining.\nMS. SMITH: No rebuttal, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The case is\nsubmitted.\n[Whereupon, at 12:04 p.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.]\n"
