        "content": "(10:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in No. 02-371, Virginia v. Kevin Lamont\nHicks.\nMr. Hurd.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. HURD\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. HURD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nBefore this trespass policy took effect, the\nfamilies in Whitcomb Court lived in the middle of an open-\nair drug market. Surely those who must rent from public\nhousing ought not be required by the law to live in\ngreater danger from criminals than those who rent from\nprivate landlords. And yet, that is the consequence of\nthe decision below and its mistaken application of the\nFirst Amendment.\nThis defendant is a common trespasser, not\nengaged in any expressive activity. The court below\nstruck down the trespass policy only by indulging in an\nextravagant expansion of the overbreadth doctrine.\nQUESTION: Well, was -- was the State applying\nsome State law notion of standing, because certainly\nVirginia can have different rules for standing than the\nFederal court might have.\nMR. HURD: There is absolutely no indication in\nthe record, Your Honor, that the State supreme court was\ndoing anything other than applying what it thought was\nthis Court's overbreadth jurisprudence.\nQUESTION: Well, but on -- on the matter of\nstanding, would we necessarily assume they were applying\nsome Federal standard?\nMR. HURD: Your Honor, you don't need to assume\nthat in this case. They -- they discuss the question of\nstanding in their opinion, and they referred to this\nCourt and this Court's traditional rule and the\noverbreadth rule, never suggesting for a moment that they\nthought Virginia might have a more generous rule of\nstanding than this Court has required.\nQUESTION: Did they cite our cases?\nQUESTION: There's -- there's no --\nMR. HURD: They did.\nQUESTION: There's no citation of any Virginia\ncase in the opinion, is there?\nMR. HURD: There is no citation when discussing\nthe -- the standing issue, the overbreadth issue at all.\nThat's correct, Your Honor.\nThey -- they cite this Court's cases, and this\nis found joint appendix page 159. It says the Supreme\nCourt -- and I'm quoting now from the second complete\nparagraph -- the Supreme Court has held that in the\ncontext of a First Amendment challenge, a litigant may\nchallenge government action granting government officials\nstandardless discretion even if that government action as\napplied to the litigant is constitutionally permissible.\nThey then cite this Court's decision in Los\nAngeles Police Department. They then go on to cite this\nCourt's decision in Ferber and in Broadrick and in Gooding\nv. Wilson and in Dombrowski and in Thornhill, never\nsuggesting for a moment that Virginia has a more generous\nnotion of overbreadth standing --\nQUESTION: But if we were to hold for you on\nthat ground, the Virginia Supreme Court would be free to\nsay on remand, would it not, that it has decided to take a\nmore generous view of standing?\nMR. HURD: It certainly could do that, Your\nHonor. The Virginia Supreme Court has historically\nadhered very closely in its interpretation of the State\nconstitutional standards to the standards laid down by\nthis Court under the Federal Constitution.\nQUESTION: But when we're not talking about\nsubstantive law, why is that really an -- an issue for us?\nMR. HURD: Well, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: They can do what they want. It's\ntheir courts.\nMR. HURD: Your Honor, they -- they believe they\nare required by this Court's jurisprudence to grant --\nQUESTION: Well, but they didn't say that here.\nI mean, they didn't say the Supreme Court requires this\nand our standing doctrine would be narrower, but we feel\nwe must. I mean, we -- we just don't know.\nMR. HURD: Your Honor, I believe we -- we do\nknow based on the portions of the record I read. They\nrelied solely upon this Court's overbreadth standing\njurisprudence.\nQUESTION: Well, they -- they did with respect\nto -- to substantive law -- the substantive doctrine\noverbreadth. But at no point did they say, we would not\nentertain this matter if it were brought under State law,\nbut we are required to do so by the Supreme Court's\nsubstantive doctrine.\nMR. HURD: Your Honor, I -- I think of the --\nthe recently decided case of Virginia v. Black cross\nburning where in that case the criminal defendant raised\nclaims under both Federal and State law. It decided it\nunder the Federal. It did not decide it under the State.\nQUESTION: Mr. Hurd, that's not the issue\nanyway, is it, whether they would have had a narrower\ninterpretation under State law?\nMR. HURD: No, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: The issue is whether -- whether they\nadopted a broader interpretation under State law than\nFederal law would require.\nMR. HURD: That's --\nQUESTION: Isn't that the issue?\nMR. HURD: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: There's no indication that they were\nadopting a broader interpretation than Federal law\nrequires.\nMR. HURD: That is correct. A -- a State may\nwell be able to adopt a broader interpretation of standing\nthan this Court requires, but it cannot adopt a narrower\ninterpretation. It cannot disregard this Court's\ndirection that you give overbreadth standing according to\nthe Federal constitutional standards, according to this\nCourt's standards. There's nothing in the record to\nsuggest at all that it was adopting a broader\ninterpretation. It said that this Court -- I'm\nparaphrasing, of course. But it says this Court's\nstanding rule -- its traditional standing rules do not\napply in these overbreadth cases, and then it cites this\nCourt's decisions.\nQUESTION: And if they were correct about what\nour standing rules are, they would have to follow those\nstanding rules, wouldn't they? They could not apply a\nnarrower --\nMR. HURD: That's --\nQUESTION: -- basis for standing, could they?\nMR. HURD: That is absolutely correct, Your\nHonor. The State supreme court has no discretion to\ndisregard this Court's application of the First Amendment\nthrough its overbreadth doctrine. Here, what happened --\nQUESTION: If they -- if they were wrong in\ninterpreting our cases, they still could have done exactly\nwhat they did.\nMR. HURD: They could have, Your Honor, but\nthere's no indication that they did.\nQUESTION: They didn't say so.\nMR. HURD: They didn't say so.\nQUESTION: So if we sent it back and then they\nsaid so, then we'd have to take the case and decide\nwhether they're right or wrong on the merits.\nMR. HURD: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Yes. I'm not sure why we -- why it's\ncalled standing. That's where I'm basically mixed up in\nthis case. The person has nothing to do with speech, the\nparticular defendant. It's sort of like a person who has\na gun under a gun statute that forbids it. And he wants\nto say that this law is unconstitutional because it might\napply to people who were petitioning, and if it did, it\nwouldn't do it right. It might apply to people who were\nspeaking. It might apply to speech, just as the gun law\nmight apply to people who have a gun in a theater in a\npart of a play. And he wants to say that this law is\nunconstitutional as applied to him because of that problem\nwith it. And in the gun case, it would be apparent that\nthe law wouldn't be unconstitutional as applied to him\nbecause in most of its applications, it would be\nconstitutional and he has nothing to do with speech.\nAnd now you want to say, that's true here, too.\nMR. HURD: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Well, why aren't you and he arguing\non the merits of a constitutional matter, whether this\nstatute is or is not unconstitutional because of the\npossibility that it could be badly applied in a free\nspeech area that isn't this one?\nMR. HURD: Well --\nQUESTION: Why isn't that the merits? Why is it\nstanding?\nMR. HURD: Well, Your Honor, there are a number\nof problems with -- with Mr. Hicks' case, one of which is\nexactly the one you described. We think that there are\nseveral aspects of that. We think one aspect of standing.\nWe think another aspect is that this Court's practice has\nbeen not to allow overbreadth challenges to be brought in\ncases where it was not a -- a speech-related statute or a\nstatute governing something closely related to speech.\nQUESTION: Mr. Hurd, we don't normally decide\nwhether a statute is constitutional in the abstract, do\nwe? I thought we normally decided whether someone has\nbeen unconstitutionally convicted. We don't go around\nbashing statutes in their totality. We say this person\nwas unconstitutionally convicted.\nMR. HURD: That's correct, Your Honor. And --\nand certainly --\nQUESTION: And that's why it's -- it's a\nquestion of third-party standing whether you can say I was\nunconstitutionally convicted because if you applied this\nstatute to somebody else, he would be unconstitutionally\nconvicted.\nMR. HURD: It -- that is certainly our argument,\nYour Honor. Standing is one problem with Mr. Hicks' case.\nBut even if he had standing, there's a problem\nhere of not meeting the requirement that alleged\noverbreadth be substantial. In fact, the State supreme\ncourt didn't address this prong of the overbreadth\ndoctrine at all. And it's clear, we believe, that even if\nthere were some possible unconstitutional application of\nthis policy, that the overbreadth would not be\nsubstantial. The legitimate sweep of this policy is very\nbroad. It sweeps up those who come to Whitcomb Court to\ndeal drugs and batter women and damage property and steal\nand intimidate and try to make this property their turf.\nQUESTION: I didn't think it was limited to\nthose people. I thought it was a total ban on people\ncoming in without permission.\nMR. HURD: Your Honor, that is -- that is not\nexactly the -- what the policy says. The --\nQUESTION: Well, what does the policy ban?\nMR. HURD: The policy is --\nQUESTION: It doesn't just ban drug dealers,\ndoes it?\nMR. HURD: No, Your Honor, but in terms of -- of\nthe legitimate sweep, if we tried to contrast the\nlegitimate sweep of the policy --\nQUESTION: Well, I -- let's say it's legitimate\nto keep all the drug dealers and all the armed robbers\nout, but -- but how many other people does it keep out?\nThat's what I was curious about.\nMR. HURD: Well, Your Honor, we believe that the\nrisk that any legitimate speaker will be chilled is -- is\nvery small. In fact, you know, the policy was developed\nto chase away the ne'er-do-wells I have described, and if\nwe're unable to remove the criminals, it would not be safe\nfor people to come and engage in speech.\nQUESTION: But doesn't the no trespassing sign\napply to everybody? It doesn't just apply to ne'er-do-\nwells, does it?\nMR. HURD: Your Honor, it -- it does not apply\nto -- just to ne'er-do-wells, and the problem is how do\nyou know until you actually catch them in the act of\ndealing drugs?\nQUESTION: Well, it applies to -- it does not\napply to someone who is coming to see someone in the\nhousing development, as I understand it.\nMR. HURD: That's correct, Your Honor. The --\nthe policy is explained by Gloria Rogers, the housing\nmanager, on page 32 of the joint appendix. There's a\nquestion and an answer at the bottom.\nquestion -- if a nonresident is seen on privatized public\nhousing property and he cannot demonstrate that he is\neither visiting a lawfully residing resident or conducting\nlegitimate business, is he an authorized -- an\nunauthorized person?\nQUESTION: Which, as far as the text of the\nordinance is concerned, legitimate business could include\npamphleting.\nMR. HURD: It -- it certainly could, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: As far as the text is concerned.\nMR. HURD: Absolutely. Absolutely. It all\ncould be included under the concept of visiting residents,\ngoing door to door to visit them and hand them material.\nQUESTION: If -- if we agree --\nQUESTION: It wasn't the interpretation by one\nof the administrators that leafleting was not ipso facto\nlegitimate businessing, or pamphleting or whatever. Isn't\nthat right?\nMR. HURD: Your Honor, we would characterize\nthat not so much as an interpretation of the written\npolicy as an addendum --\nQUESTION: An addendum.\nMR. HURD: -- an addendum to it which requires\nthe demonstration of legitimate purpose, which is\ndiscussed in the policy, which would require that\ndemonstration be made to the housing manager to show that\nthe leafleting is legitimate. That --\nQUESTION: Suppose -- and suppose I -- the --\nthe Court were to agree with you that the speech analysis,\nparticularly the overbreadth analysis here, was wrong.\nDoes the case then go back to the Supreme Court of\nVirginia in a posture where Mr. Hicks has the opportunity\nto challenge the ordinance as being unconstitutional for\nother reasons apart from the First Amendment? It's vague.\nIt inhibits his right of -- of movement. These are\nstreets that are the functional equivalent of a public,\nwhatever. Does he have all of those issues preserved to\nhim on remand?\nMR. HURD: Your Honor, he certainly has this --\nthis due process right to wander issue preserved. There's\na question that the State supreme court did not address,\nwhich is whether these streets and sidewalks are a\ntraditional public forum or a nonpublic forum. And he has\ncertainly asserted the right to -- to be there -- the\nright to --\nQUESTION: And in the context of that, to say\nthat the ordinance is vague for other reasons.\nMR. HURD: That would be a substantive due\nprocess challenge there. He also has raised below a -- a\nvagueness challenge.\nhe raises here. But he would have that available to him\nas well. So that the -- the only -- Your Honor, the --\nthe only argument he raised below in the State supreme\ncourt that would -- that would not be available to him\nupon remand would be the one decided by this Court. And\nall the other issues he pressed below before the State\nsupreme court he could press again.\nQUESTION: Mr. Hurd --\nQUESTION: Mr. Hurd, could we go back just to\nJustice Stevens' question for a minute? And I -- I just\nwant to -- I want you to comment on the significance of\nthe -- of the -- the notice that you set out on page 5 of\nyour brief. The notice says: no trespassing, private\nproperty, you are now entering private property and\nstreets, et cetera. That sounds to me as though it -- it\nmeans, as -- as a no trespassing sign normally would, that\nif you are not a -- the landowner or a licensee of the\nlandowner specifically, you're not supposed to enter.\nThen it goes on to say, unauthorized persons,\nwhich I take it anybody who is not authorized to enter,\nwill be subject to arrest and prosecution. So in answer\nto Justice Stevens' question, if -- if that notice, which\nis posted all over the -- the area, is a statement of\npolicy, I assume it is excluding everybody --\nMR. HURD:\nQUESTION: -- who is not a resident.\nAnd -- and it then goes on to say that following\nsome review for what may or may not be authority, people\ncoming in can be arrested and prosecuted.\nMR. HURD: No, Your Honor. The -- the policy is\nnot intended to convey the idea --\nQUESTION: No, but is that what this says? If\nwe -- if we stick simply to the notices that you've put\nup, isn't that, in effect, the burden of the notices that\nyou've put up?\nMR. HURD: No, Your Honor, I do not believe\nthat's the case. I believe that -- that the phrase\nunauthorized persons calls into question, well, who -- who\nis authorized and --\nQUESTION: Well, but before we get to that, it\nsays, no trespassing. And doesn't that normally mean that\nif you are not the landowner or a licensee, you're\ntrespassing?\nMR. HURD: Your Honor, in the context of a\nprivate apartment complex, it would not mean that. A\nprivate apartment complex or a public apartment complex\nwhere a tenant has a leasehold interest has the right to\ninvite people to come to that premises without having to\nhave the landlord grant permission.\nQUESTION:\nchallenge here, or is it the ordinance?\nMR. HURD: It is -- it is not the signs.\nQUESTION: It -- it may well be that the\nordinance is constitutional but the signs aren't.\nMR. HURD: It is -- it is the policy --\nQUESTION: That's possible.\nMR. HURD: It is the policy that is -- that is\nchallenged, not -- not the signs.\nQUESTION: But are you taking the position that\nthe policy and the signs are different in their content?\nMR. HURD: We're taking the position they must\nbe read together, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: If you read them separately, are they\ndifferent?\nMR. HURD: A -- a person might be able to read\nthe sign in isolation and believe that they had to get\nsome permission to come in advance, but the people who\ncome to the -- to this housing complex and do so\nlegitimately typically receive invitations from the\nresidents. So they understand. The residents understand\nwhat the policy is.\nQUESTION: Mr. Hurd, that's a curiosity about\nthis case, the fact background of it that perhaps you can\nclarify. You keep saying legitimate visitor. This man's\nmother and his child and the mother of his child all live\nin this project, and one would think that he would\ncertainly have a basis to visit his family.\nMR. HURD: Your Honor, two -- two points on\nthat. The -- the first point is had he not been barred,\ncertainly coming to visit his family would be a legitimate\npurpose. But once he is barred -- and he was -- he was\nbarred under this --\nQUESTION: And we don't know why.\nMR. HURD: Well, the -- the record suggests on\npage 60 that there may have been some domestic violence in\nthe background. We do not know the specific facts of\nthat. But we do know that that is referred to by Gloria\nRogers on page 60 of the joint appendix. There's also a\nreference on that same page to giving out false\ninformation about addresses he allegedly lived at in the\npremises. He did plead guilty twice to trespassing and\nwas convicted of damaging property.\nHe does not challenge the particular reasons why\nhe was barred, and if he wants to deliver diapers, he\nshould have thought about that before his misconduct\nearned him this barment notice and he thereby forfeited\nhis right to return.\nBesides, Your Honor, Justice Ginsburg, there's\nno evidence anyone saw any diapers or that he was there on\nsuch an errand other than what he said.\nGloria Rogers to let him back on the property, he never\nmentioned visiting the child or the child's mother.\nQUESTION: It's not disputed that his -- that\nthey live in the project.\nMR. HURD: They do, and had he not engaged in\nmisconduct, the situation never would have arisen. But it\ncertainly cannot --\nQUESTION: Maybe they want him out too. We\ndon't really know that either, do we?\nMR. HURD: We -- we do not, Your Honor. We do\nnot. The -- there was no testimony at trial from the\nmother that she had asked him to come or that he had\nbrought her diapers or -- or any of that. We have no idea\nwhether he is welcome there or not.\nBut the -- the point I want to make is that\nsurely it cannot be the law that a desire to visit one's\nmother or one's girlfriend trumps a barment notice\nregardless of how bad the individual's prior conduct may\nhave been. He did not challenge that barment notice by\nsaying, well, it wasn't bad enough. What we do know in\nthe record is that it was pretty bad: two prior instances\nof trespass, damaging property, and so forth.\nIn sum -- I see my time is -- is running out.\nI'd like to reserve some of it.\nIn sum, we have families here living in\ndesperate circumstances, marijuana for sale on Bethel\nStreet, crack cocaine on Ambrose, heroin over on Deforrest\nStreet. The overbreadth doctrine was designed to remedy\nsituations where a challenged statute chills the rights of\nothers not before the court. Here it's not this trespass\npolicy that chills the right of free speech, but the\ndangerous conditions at Whitcomb Court that the policy was\ndesigned to alleviate.\nWe ask that the judgment below be vacated.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Hurd. And you wish to\nreserve the rest of your time?\nMR. HURD: Yes, Your Honor. Thank you.\nQUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. DREEBEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nWhat makes this case distinctive as a First\nAmendment case is the presence of a general law not\ndirected at speech at all but directed at conduct that's\nunder challenge and the absence of any expressive activity\nwhatsoever by the person seeking to raise the overbreadth\nchallenge.\nThis Court's cases have entertained overbreadth\nchallenges as a means of alleviating the chill of First\nAmendment rights of persons who are not before the Court,\nbut the Court has never entertained overbreadth when the\nconsequence of doing so would be to invalidate a general\nlaw that's primarily aimed at conduct and when the person\nwho's raising the challenge did nothing to engage in\nspeech or any expressive activity at all.\nThe costs of an overbreadth challenge, this\nCourt has recognized, are high because they prohibit the\nGovernment from enforcing a law against conduct that is\nnot constitutionally protected. But those costs are\nmagnified when the law under challenge is not merely a law\nthat directs --\nQUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, assume -- I know it's\nnot quite clear, but assume for the moment that Virginia\nhad clearly -- Virginia Supreme Court clearly said we're\ngoing to allow standing as a matter of State law, but --\neven though it wouldn't be allowed as a matter of Federal\nlaw, and the case then came to us in that posture. Would\nwe then have authority to decide the overbreadth issue?\nMR. DREEBEN: I'm not sure that this Court\nwould, Justice Stevens. It would then be in a posture\nmore analogous to the J.H. Munson case that was before the\nCourt in which the Court considered and Your Honor's\nseparate opinion addressed the question of whether, when\nthere was an independent State overbreadth analysis, could\nan aggrieved State official then bring the case to this\nCourt.\nWhat is clear on the current record is that the\nVirginia Supreme Court cited and relied on --\nQUESTION: No. I understand that. But I'm just\n-- I'm just wondering if it went back and they said, well,\nthat's true, but it was a matter of Virginia law. We\nthink we'll entertain a stand, and then they decide on\nFederal grounds that it violates the First Amendment.\nThen my question is, could we review that holding, and if\n-- if we reviewed it in that?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, the question there would be\nwhether the State was sufficiently aggrieved so as to have\nstanding under the principles announced --\nQUESTION: Some of our loyalty oath cases -- I\nforget if it was Adler or Doremus. Doremus was First\nAmendment -- allowed us to relax our standing rules in\norder to reach a substantive constitutional issue cited by\nthe State court.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, the most relevant case is\nprobably the Asarco decision in which the Court concluded\nthat once the State court binds the State officials to a\nparticular ruling, that there may be the requisite case or\ncontroversy to allow this Court to decide --\nQUESTION: There's -- there's also --\nQUESTION: The same party can have standing to\nappeal.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's right. And --\nQUESTION: There's also a question, isn't there,\nMr. Dreeben, of whether this overbreadth doctrine is\nessentially a part of the First Amendment or a part of the\nstanding doctrine?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, it has two aspects, Mr.\nChief Justice. One aspect of it does relate to whether\nthere is a case or controversy, and there clearly has to\nbe a developed enough case or controversy to allow Article\nIII to be invoked for this Court to announce First\nAmendment principles at all. And part of the overbreadth\ndoctrine responds to those concerns.\nBut another aspect of the overbreadth doctrine\nis purely prudential, and this Court has adopted those\nlimits as a matter of -- of prudential principles to avoid\nthe premature adjudication of hypothetical and abstract\nFirst Amendment questions.\nQUESTION: But it clearly relates to the\ndoctrine of standing, doesn't it, which doctrine says that\nyou normally do not have standing to raise the objections\nof other people?\nobjections to your own treatment, not to the treatment of\nothers, right?\nMR. DREEBEN: That's correct. I wouldn't\ndispute --\nQUESTION: And overbreadth changes that. It\nsays in this one area, you can object to the treatment of\nother people.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I think overbreadth is -- is\nan application of a more general principle that this\nCourt has adopted on -- in various circumstances to allow\na party who's before the Court and who is aggrieved to\nraise the rights of others. For example, in Batson\nchallenges, the Court allows criminal defendants to raise\nthe rights of the excluded jurors.\nThis is an example of third party standing\ndesigned to implement First Amendment norms, but the\nCourt has recognized that the costs of invalidating a law,\nwhen the person before the Court doesn't have\nconstitutionally protected conduct, are high, and those\ncosts are higher when what's being invalidated is not\nmerely a law aimed at speech, but a law aimed at access,\ngeneral conduct, as is this law.\nQUESTION: But the irony of what you're saying\nis that the Virginia -- Virginia Supreme Court might\nundertake that cost, invalidate a Virginia statute on\nFederal grounds that we think are wrong and we couldn't do\nanything about it.\nMR. DREEBEN: That is probably true unless the\nCourt applies the Asarco principle to allow an aggrieved\nState official to bring the case here because its own\nsupreme court has interfered with the implementation of\nFederal law --\nQUESTION: See, but that's -- that's the\nproblem. I mean, this is exactly -- that's why I'm mixed\nup about the standing part versus the merits. It seems to\nme if it's a traditional question of standing, there --\nthere are a group of people who are trespassing who have\nnothing to do with speech. And then there's some other\nhypothetical people that might have to do with speech.\nAnd the question is can these people who have nothing to\ndo with speech invalidate the statute because of the way\nit applies to some other people? Now, in the First\nAmendment area, we have normally let people do that, but\nin other areas not.\nAll right. So suppose the answer is not. You\ncan't. That's their problem. Let them raise it.\nNow, Virginia says, we want to let any taxpayer\nraise it. If it were purely standing, any taxpayer could\nraise it, but then what? I would have said that the first\nholding would have meant it is not unconstitutional under\nthe Federal Constitution to convict this person. And --\nand now, under -- under the guise of standing, they're\ngoing to come back and say, oh, no, it is unconstitutional\nbecause we let this person raise the rights of some\nothers. That's where I'm confused.\nMR. DREEBEN: I think the answer to this paradox\nis that the State court can adopt much broader principles\nof law with respect to standing than this Court would\nimpose, and it can administer them even when it's\nadjudicating Federal light -- rights. For example, a\nState could allow a purely advisory opinion to be issued\nby its State supreme court challenging this law by any\ncitizen.\nQUESTION: Well, fine, let them challenge it.\nQUESTION: Okay. Does --\nQUESTION: But if you're right, no matter how\nmuch they challenge it, the simple fact is, if you're\nright, it doesn't violate the Federal Constitution to\nconvict this person.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's true.\nQUESTION: So what's raising it going to get\nhim?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, that -- that is an\nadjudication of the -- of the overbreadth challenge on the\nmerits.\nsufficient real and substantial overbreadth to invalidate\nthis law, and we do think that that is a correct analysis\nand would suffice to reject the Virginia Supreme Court's\nholding in this case.\nQUESTION: Okay, but you're -- I think you're\nsaying that -- that under Asarco, they can challenge the\nsubstantiality point, but they wouldn't necessarily be\nable to challenge the standing point which gets this\nparticular defendant in a position to raise the issue in\nthe first place. Is that right?\nMR. DREEBEN: It's not exactly right, Justice\nSouter, because I think this is an area analogous to the\nCourt's rules in criminal cases under Michigan v. Long\nwhere the Court has to decide, does this opinion rest on a\nquestion of Federal law or does it rest on a question of\nState law? And in Michigan v. Long, the Court adopted a\npresumption that if what a State court does is cite and\nrely on Federal precedents, we will presume that it did\nwhat it did because it thought it was compelled to by the\nforce of this Court's decisions.\nQUESTION: We certainly -- that certainly\napplies when you're talking about substantive law whether\nit -- it would be an extension of that to apply it to\nstanding.\nMR. DREEBEN:\nextension because in this case the court did not\nseparately analyze the questions of standing as such from\nwhether respondent could bring an overbreadth challenge,\nand the question wasn't posed with a --\nQUESTION: Why -- why isn't that a question of\nstanding by definition?\nMR. DREEBEN: It -- what it --\nQUESTION: Overbreadth is an exception to\nstanding, and -- and so why is it anything but a standing\nissue? Substantiality of overbreadth is -- is a\nsubstantive issue, but -- you see my --\nMR. DREEBEN: Let me -- let me explain it this\nway, Justice Souter. If this Court said the First\nAmendment overbreadth doctrine requires that State courts\nentertain overbreadth claims like this one even when it's\na general law and even when the party before the court has\nbeen convicted of conduct that doesn't involve speech,\nthen State courts would be required to follow that rule\nand could not adopt a different standing principle that\nwas narrower and that would exclude respondent.\nAnd our reading of the Virginia Supreme Court's\nopinion is that Virginia either thought or assumed that it\nwas required by this Court's cases to entertain an\noverbreadth challenge. The proper response, if the Court\nagrees that it's not the State court's obligation to\nentertain this overbreadth challenge, would be to vacate\nthe judgment, announce the correct First Amendment\nprinciples, and remand the case to the Virginia Supreme\nCourt for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nQUESTION: But that would -- that would\nbasically be applying something like Michigan v. Long\nrather than Asarco, right?\nMR. DREEBEN: In this case, it certainly would\nbecause the State court hasn't relied on a clearly\ninsufficient case or controversy in order to adjudicate\nFederal rights. There is, in fact, a case or controversy\nhere. The respondent has been convicted of a criminal\noffense, and he is challenging the law under which he was\nconvicted. So this case does not fall outside of the case\nor controversy requirement even measured by Article III\nstandards.\nQUESTION: If we follow that course, we wouldn't\nget to the substantive overbreadth, right? We would\njust --\nMR. DREEBEN: That -- that is correct, Justice\nGinsburg.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Dreeben.\nMr. Benjamin, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN D. BENJAMIN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. BENJAMIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn 1997, Richmond took a neighborhood and by\nordinance, deed, and a police authorization, made it so\nthat a person could not walk down the street or the\nsidewalk unless he could prove to the police that he was\nauthorized to do so. The policy that the city implemented\nwas of such breadth that it included the public, residents\nand nonresidents alike of this community, that it included\ninnocent people doing lawful things, and it included\nprotected conduct, such as the distribution of literature.\nQUESTION: Are you suggesting that these streets\nwere still as if they belonged to the City of Richmond\nafter they were deeded to the housing authority?\nMR. BENJAMIN: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Why is that?\nMR. BENJAMIN: They were still public. They\nwere still public streets, regardless of the transfer --\nQUESTION: Why -- you know, clearly the city\nintended that they no longer be public streets. Why did\nthat intention fail?\nMR. BENJAMIN: Your Honor, for the same reason\nwhen Congress ruled -- or -- or passed a law saying that\nthe sidewalks around this building were no longer to be\nused, for the same reason. The intent didn't matter. The\ncharacter and the use and the form didn't change at all,\nand those were the criteria that mattered.\nQUESTION: That wasn't a law making those\nprivate sidewalks.\nWhat -- what about the streets to and from the\nentry to the Governor's mansion in Richmond? Are they\npublic streets too?\nMR. BENJAMIN: Yes, they are, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: They are.\nMR. BENJAMIN: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: You can't exclude the public from --\nfrom marching right up to the Governor's front door?\nMR. BENJAMIN: You can exclude the public from\nthe gate. There's a gate.\nQUESTION: From the gate, but there's a street\nthat goes right from the gate right up, you know, circular\ndriveway, right up to the Governor's front door. That's a\npublic street.\nMR. BENJAMIN: That is not a public street, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: Of course, it's not a public street.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: So it's --\nQUESTION:\nby the State of Virginia or the City of Richmond that are\nnot public streets.\nMR. BENJAMIN: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: And the only issue is whether this is\none of them.\nMR. BENJAMIN: Well, that street, Your Honor, I\nwould call a driveway. That's what it is.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Well, the residents of this housing\nproject would call these streets their -- their driveways,\nthe -- the access to their particular apartments.\nMR. BENJAMIN: I disagree with you.\nQUESTION: Well, there are a lot of streets in\nCambridge which are called private ways, and nobody knows\nwhat that means.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BENJAMIN: And that, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: A lot of stuff in Cambridge that\nnobody understands.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Well, they have some original alleys\nin the District that are comparable I think.\nMR. BENJAMIN: That's true too, but you know, I\nhave never, Your Honor, heard anyone with a grievance say\nlet's take it to the alley.\nthe street because --\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I take -- I take it there\nare any number of -- of difficult and important issues\nhere. One is the character of these streets. We don't\nknow very much about it in the record. The other is\nwhether, even if they are streets with some special\nstatus, whether Ms. Rogers is the one who has the right to\nsay who can come and who can go. This is Ms. Rogers'\nneighborhood in a very interesting way.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: But I -- I take it that all of those\nissues are open for you to argue if we were to agree with\nthe State that the Supreme Court of Virginia was simply\nwrong in its First Amendment analysis on overbreadth, and\nyou would have all of those arguments to confront and to\nsee if you can prevail on if we remand it to the Supreme\nCourt of Virginia.\nMR. BENJAMIN: Your Honor, that's correct.\nHowever, those same issues, of course, were before the\nVirginia Supreme Court. The -- the State, the petitioner,\ndid not even challenge standing until the State sought\ncert at this Court.\nThe question presented concerning the closest\nissue to standing was whether Mr. Hicks was untimely in\nhis challenge to the barment-trespass policy. The State\nin all of the State courts argued that Mr. Hicks should\nhave challenged his barment in some civil proceeding, and\nthat's the question presented on page 97 of the joint\nappendix and that was what the Virginia Supreme Court\ndealt with, it having been the only issue presented to\nthem on this at page 158.\nQUESTION: It doesn't have to argue it if they\ndecide it. We -- we will review a question that is either\nargued or decided by the State court. There's no doubt\nthat the Virginia Supreme Court decided the standing\nquestion, decided the overbreadth question, and you're\nsaying that we cannot review that decision because he was\nnot the one that initiated the -- the matter? That's just\nnot what our law says.\nMR. BENJAMIN: I don't know, Your Honor, if it\nis true to say that the Virginia court necessarily decided\nthe standing order, it not -- the standing issue, it not\nhaving been raised. But --\nQUESTION: They had a whole long discussion of\noverbreadth. I mean --\nMR. BENJAMIN: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: What do you think that was about?\nMR. BENJAMIN: Yes, Your Honor, that was on the\nmerits. When the Virginia Supreme Court discussed the\nmerits, they discussed whether there was overbreadth and\nwhether it was substantially overbroad.\nQUESTION: But they didn't decide that\noverbreadth was an issue. They just went ahead and\ndecided if overbreadth had been an issue, this is how the\nissue would be resolved. Certainly they decided that\noverbreadth -- that is, the standing doctrine of\noverbreadth -- was applicable to this case.\nMR. BENJAMIN: Your Honor, I disagree with you.\nI don't think they decided that and I don't think it\nwas --\nQUESTION: Then why did they go into the\ndiscussion of whether this was overbroad? They must have\nthought it relevant.\nMR. BENJAMIN: Your Honor, because it -- it was\nthe -- the immediate issue that confronted them. They\nwere confronted with a policy that was unconstitutional in\nso many fundamental respects.\nQUESTION: But they dealt with only one. Mr.\nHurd said, yes, your question of public forum or not would\nbe open, your due process vagueness argument would be\nopen. What wouldn't be open, if we ruled against you on\nthis First Amendment overbreadth thing, is -- that's all.\nEverything else -- the Virginia Supreme Court said this is\nwhat we're deciding and we're not getting to -- they\ndeliberately said we're not getting to public forum.\nMR. BENJAMIN: Your Honor, if the Virginia\nSupreme Court did implicitly decide the standing issue,\nthen it was a right that it had to accept this -- this\ncase which was, as the Government concedes, and the\npetitioner, a case and controversy. Mr. Hicks was\nconvicted, and he did raise all of these constitutional\nissues in defense of his conviction. And if the Virginia\nSupreme Court implicitly reached the standing question,\nthen as a matter of State law and State rights, it was\nentitled to do that.\nQUESTION: Mr. Benjamin, certainly the\ndissenting opinion in the Supreme Court of Virginia talked\nabout overbreadth. I mean, the -- the one -- I'm just\nreading a sentence here from appendix page: Thus, I\nconclude that the defendant may only challenge the\ntrespass policy as it was applied to him. Now, that --\nthat is overbreadth.\nMR. BENJAMIN: Yes, sir. Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: So what is the answer then to the\noverbreadth question? That is, the first question\npresented in the petition for certiorari, which we\ngranted, asks, as I read it, the question of whether a\nperson who does not engage in expressive conduct at all\ncan ask the court and can succeed in having the court\nstrike down a statute as applied to him for the reason\nthat it might be unconstitutional as applied to other\npeople engaged in expressive conduct.\nThe example would be, favoring their side, that\nyou have a gun statute. Any person who possesses a gun is\n-- goes to jail, and the defendant says, well, I did\npossess a gun and I was trying to rob a bank, but maybe\nthis statute would be applied to a person in a play, in\nwhich case it would be too broad. And they say it's like\nthat absurd example.\nAll right. Now, why isn't it close enough to\nthe absurd example? They're also arguing that this is a\nstatute that deals with drugs. It deals with ordinary\ntrespass. Very few of these people want to pamphlet or\nengage in expressive conduct. A handful might, but if\nthey do, let's consider it, when this statute is applied\nto them, which it never has been in their view.\nNow, what's your response?\nMR. BENJAMIN: Your Honor, my response is that\nin the ordinary case, such as some of your hypotheticals\nsuggest, it would become instantly apparent that the\nrobber, although claiming that the statute or the policy\nis overbroad -- it would become instantly apparent that he\nhad no basis whatsoever to bring this motion. If he even\ngot to a hearing, there would be an immediate failure of\nproof, but it wouldn't get to a hearing because there\nwould be a motion to quash the motion for lack of --\nQUESTION: There happened to be -- I didn't give\nyou the whole statute. There were seven other\nconstitutional errors in it, but I didn't mention them\nbecause they could be raised on remand.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: So it's -- that -- that I'm trying to\nmake this --\nMR. BENJAMIN: In this policy I counted eight\nconstitutional errors.\nIn this case, Mr. Hicks' conduct was expressive.\nMr. Hicks meets Virginia's own test because he was going\nto see his children, and there is no expressive action --\nQUESTION: You know, I -- I think it's a mistake\nto put too much onto the First Amendment. The police\nofficer stops me unlawfully and I say, I was on the way\nhome to talk to my wife. I mean, this -- this -- it tends\nto trivialize the First Amendment if you put so much on\nit. You have some very important substantive issues here\nabout the right of freedom of movement to use the streets\nand so forth, and it seems to me that for the -- for you\nto rest the case, A, on the First Amendment, B, under what\nis a very questionable application of the overbreadth\ndoctrine. It -- it is not the right way to proceed in\nthis case.\nMR. BENJAMIN: Your Honor, I understand your\nquestion, and Mr. Hicks at the inception was not outraged\nabout free speech and First Amendment issues. He was\noutraged about the fact that he had been banned for\napparently nothing more, as the en banc Virginia court\nfound, going back to see his family repeatedly. He was\nupset and challenged the very barment proceeding and the\n-- the entire policy.\nQUESTION: May I just stop you there as a matter\nof accuracy? We don't know why he was debarred, but we do\nknow that one of the charges was destruction of property.\nWe don't know what property that was. So it's -- I think\nyou're painting a somewhat false picture to suggest that\nthis was a loving father who was simply going to visit his\nchildren.\nMR. BENJAMIN: The en banc court at page 125,\nfootnote --\nQUESTION: Is this the court of appeals?\nMR. BENJAMIN: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Not the supreme court.\nMR. BENJAMIN: Not the supreme court, had found,\nYour Honor, that the -- the charge of damaging property\nhad nothing to do with his barment, and there was nothing\nin the record or in the evidence suggesting otherwise.\nThe testimony at page 60 of the joint appendix\ndoes not permit the inference urged by the petitioner.\nThe inference at most urged -- that you could draw from\npage 60, the testimony there is that the police quite\noften saw Mr. Hicks in the development and he gave them an\naddress, and then Ms. Rogers would confirm that he did not\nlive there.\nQUESTION: Well, if you're going appeal to page\n60, you're just out of the frying pan into the -- into the\nfire. Yes, it -- it doesn't mention destruction of\nproperty, but it does mention domestic violence.\nMR. BENJAMIN: Your Honor, what Gloria Rogers is\ndoing in that instance, although she has been asked the\nspecific question, how did Kevin Hicks come to be barred,\nshe begins, as she does, giving a general answer in how\npeople get barred. And in the -- she began with that.\nThen she went to Mr. Hicks' case, and then she went back\nto one of her own reasons of domestic violence.\nQUESTION: No. She's answering the question,\nplease tell the court how he came -- how has he come and\nhave you banned him from the property. Yes. All right.\nPlease tell the court how that came about. And she said,\nnumber one -- she gave two reasons. When the police see a\nperson in the development and they say they live\nsomeplace, they confirm with the office, and Kevin Hicks\ngave a false address.\nviolence in the development. I -- I take that to be a\nresponse to the question that was asked. So, you know, to\nthe extent we know anything about why he was banned, it\nwas either because he destroyed property or because he\nparticipated in domestic violence.\nMR. BENJAMIN: Yes, Your Honor. We had sought\ndiscovery of the reasons that he was banned, and counsel\nat page 1312 and 13 had said that counsel needed to\ndemonstrate why Mr. Hicks was barred. But RRHA counsel,\nthe housing authority counsel, objected that the reason\nwhy Mr. Hicks was banned was irrelevant because being a\nprivate property owner, the position was, they could ban\nanyone at any time for any reason.\nQUESTION: Okay, Mr. Benjamin, I'm going to ask\nyou to assume that I at least do not accept the view that\nthe record shows that your client was there for an\nexpressive purpose that ought to be recognized by the --\nby the First Amendment. I don't ask you to stipulate that\nhe was banned because he was a criminal. I will simply\nassume that he is in some middle ground, that he is not\nthere for expressive purposes. Assume we don't know why\nhe's there.\nWhat's your -- your answer basically to the\nquestion put to you by Justice Breyer? Why is it\nnecessary, in order to protect the First Amendment, to\nallow a person in that position to -- to raise this kind\nof -- of issue with respect, say, to leafleters or people\nwho are there for expressive purposes? Why do we need to\nrecognize this?\nMR. BENJAMIN: Because, Your Honor, as you --\nthis very exchange illustrates how unworkable that very\ntest would be because reasonable people will disagree over\nwhether any given conduct is in fact expressive. If the\nvery fact that Mr. Hicks --\nQUESTION: Well, you're changing my hypo. I\nmean, I -- I said let's assume that we don't have a\npredicate for saying this person's conduct is expressive.\nI will grant you that there are always going to be points\non the margin in which we say, well, was he there for\nspeech or wasn't he. Assume he wasn't. What -- what is\nthe -- what is the best argument for recognizing his right\nto raise a First Amendment claim?\nMR. BENJAMIN: Because the whole reason for the\nexception is the importance of First Amendment rights and\nvalues. To impose this sort of a test would defeat the\npurpose and -- and the value, the opportunity for society\nto deal with laws that sweep this broadly and infringe\nupon and violate people's --\nQUESTION: Why -- why don't you have an adequate\nbasis to deal with them under the vagueness doctrine, for\nexample, that is open to you on remand, even if you lose\nhere? Why do we have to turn this into a First Amendment\nissue?\nMR. BENJAMIN: Because I think the Virginia\nSupreme Court, when it saw the entirety of this policy,\nincluding not just the First Amendment issues, but the\nvagueness that permeates this policy -- I think that the\nVirginia Supreme Court decided, from a conservative\napproach, that it would deal with the most to it -- the\nmost obvious deficiency and that is the complete\nunfettered discretion that -- that Gloria Rogers, the\nhousing manager, had, that every single police officer\nhad, and deal with it then while the policy was before it,\ninstead of going on and settling other questions, instead\nof requiring that challenges --\nQUESTION: But what you just said goes right to\nvagueness, that you have an administrator who says, I'm\nqueen. I'll let you in or I won't let you in. I don't\nsee why you need the First Amendment hook to challenge\nthat point.\nMR. BENJAMIN: Mr. Hicks didn't need the First\nAmendment. His issue from the very beginning began with\nthe -- the vagueness that permeates this, but it -- he --\nQUESTION: But -- but maybe it's not your fault,\nbut that's what the Supreme Court of Virginia said, and in\nthe course of doing so, it arguably -- and there's a very\nserious concern that it misapplied Thornhill.\nQUESTION: Mr. Benjamin, I don't want to put\nwords in your mouth -- excuse me. I'm sorry. I didn't --\nI don't want to put words in your mouth, but is this what\nyou're trying to say, that if the statute is so overbroad\nit would be unconstitutional if the person has standing to\nchallenge it? It doesn't matter whether he is -- his\ndisability is -- is because it's not a First Amendment\nissue at all or whether he's engaged in First Amendment\nconduct which is perfectly prohibitable as to him. In\neither event, it doesn't matter why he can't challenge it\nas long as his -- as the statute itself is overbroad. Is\nthat what your position is?\nMR. BENJAMIN: Yes, Your Honor, that is.\nQUESTION: All right. Then --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: That's -- is there a -- is there a\nrisk here? And I'm not asking it from one point of view\nor another. I don't know. But if we accepted that, there\nare trespass laws all over the country. And -- and would\n-- I don't know what they all say, but people who are\nconvicted of ordinary trespass -- and a lot of them apply\nto public property, et cetera -- could then come in and\nsay, look, these trespass laws, even though they've never\nbeen applied to stop expression -- except in my case, but\nI'm assuming it's not expression in my case. Assume it's\nnot. We have to set them all aside because they might be\napplied to expression in -- in a way that's\nunconstitutional. If I accepted the proposition that\nyou've just accepted, have I got myself in that box?\nMR. BENJAMIN: Your Honor, I'm afraid I lost you\nsomewhat during --\nQUESTION: Well, in other words, if I take the\nproposition you've just accepted as your argument, am I\nthen allowing people who trespass -- nothing to do with\nexpression -- to start attacking all the trespass laws on\nthe ground that if applied in the expression area, they\nwould be unconstitutional? And they haven't been applied\nin that area.\nMR. BENJAMIN: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: In other words -- I would be --\nMR. BENJAMIN: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: I would be accepting that.\nMR. BENJAMIN: Yes. And that -- that -- but\nit's not much of a risk.\nQUESTION: Because?\nMR. BENJAMIN: Because those challenges would\nfail almost immediately because it -- I know of no other\ncase where the trespass law has applied so pervasively to\nthe entire streets and sidewalks of a community.\nQUESTION: But trespass on public property --\nthere could be all kinds of situations, Federal buildings\nand dozens of them, where in fact it's really applied\nagainst people who are breaking in who have no business\nthere, and they just don't apply it or it never has come\nup whether they would apply it were somebody interested in\na demonstration.\nMR. BENJAMIN: Yes, Your Honor, but the system\ncan easily deal with frivolous motions because of the\nrequirements already built into the requirement.\nOverbreadth must not only exist and be articulable, it\nmust be substantial. And the system could deal with that,\nwith sanctions if necessary.\nIn this case it wasn't enough for a citizen to\nhave, in fact, a legitimate purpose to use the sidewalk.\nHe had to be able to demonstrate that he had a legitimate\npurpose. The legitimate purpose was by reference solely\nto the subjective standards of any particular police\nofficer or Gloria Rogers, the housing manager. There was\nno housing authority handbook of what constitutes\nlegitimate business. There was no clear meaning as to\nwhat legitimate meant. Left unsaid would be whether\nsomeone could go onto these streets and sidewalks if their\nbusiness was to argue and have it out with someone or to\ngo meet with abortion activists. All we know from this\npolicy is that before you can use these sidewalks, you\nmust be engaged in a legitimate -- whatever that means --\nbusiness or social reason, which by its own terms --\nQUESTION: Those are all vagueness -- those are\nall vagueness points. They -- they really don't go to the\n-- right? You're making the vagueness argument now.\nMR. BENJAMIN: I am --\nQUESTION: You -- you would have us rule on a\nvagueness ground as well, wouldn't you?\nMR. BENJAMIN: I would, but --\nQUESTION: I'd sort of like to separate the\narguments that are going to vagueness and those that are\ngoing to overbreadth. The ones you're making now don't go\nto overbreadth, it seems to me.\nMR. BENJAMIN: Your Honor, you can't separate\nvagueness and overbreadth, and this argument goes directly\nto the heart of First Amendment.\nQUESTION: Well, our cases have certainly\nseparated vagueness from overbreadth.\nMR. BENJAMIN: I think that this Court has used\nthe terms vagueness and overbreadth interchangeably and --\nQUESTION: Well, let's -- let's assume that\nwe're up to the challenge.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: It -- it seems to me that there are\nsome very important vagueness arguments in -- in the -- in\nthe classical sense of that term that your client can and\nshould make, and they're unrelated to the speech point.\nThey're completely unrelated to it. They can play back in\nthe speech context just as well, but -- but the Supreme\nCourt of Virginia thought about this just in the speech\ncontext, and that's our concern.\nMR. BENJAMIN: I submit, Your Honor, that the\nVirginia Supreme Court was taken and impressed by the\nFirst Amendment implications that are produced by the\nvagueness. If you must have a legitimate business or\nsocial purpose -- and by those terms what's excluded as a\nlegitimate purpose are lawful purposes like wandering or\njogging because that's not a -- a business or social\npurpose, but also protected purposes such as distributing\nfliers, literature, or holding religious meetings. That\ndoes not -- that kind of conduct at least arguably does\nnot fall within the rubric of business or social --\nQUESTION: No, but isn't it true -- but isn't\nthe problem with your argument this: It is one thing to\nsay that a statute that ostensibly addresses speech is\nlikely to have a serious overbreadth problem if it is very\nvague in the way it does it, but it is a very different\nthing to say that a statute that does not ostensibly\naddress speech, that addresses conduct, walking across a\nline, becomes an overbreadth -- presents an overbreadth\nproblem simply because somebody who crosses that line\nmight want to talk. And you're arguing on the basis of\ncases in the first category, speech with vague\nlimitations, to tell us that we ought to -- that we ought\nto consider everything in the second category a speech\ncase. Isn't that the -- the difficulty of your argument?\nMR. BENJAMIN: It is not, Your Honor, because\nthis policy targeted streets in the first place, streets\nand sidewalks, which are -- a principal purpose of which\nis for expressive activity. The policy itself was called\nthe street privatization program.\nQUESTION: Well, that --\nQUESTION: But the --\nQUESTION: Mr. Benjamin, it may not be\nimmediately before us, but it seems to me it is the heart\nof your case. You are essentially saying that a public\nauthority cannot create, for people who live in projects,\na gated community. The people who live outside projects\ncan have streets, everything just like this, but\ngovernment can't create it for poor people. Is that --\nMR. BENJAMIN: Your Honor, they -- they can't --\nthe Government can't do it by simply saying that the\nstreets are private and simply putting up signs because --\nQUESTION: Okay. If you're right on that, we\ndon't have to get to the speech issue. If you're wrong on\nthat, you have the problem that I just presented to you,\ndon't you?\nMR. BENJAMIN: I don't understand.\nQUESTION: If -- look, if -- if you're right\nthat the Government cannot, in their words, privatize the\nstreets, then that's the end of the case. Your guy can't\nbe prosecuted for trespass in this instance, and that's\nthe end of the issue here. If it turns out, on the other\nhand, that the Government can indeed do what it purported\nto do here, then it seems to me your argument suffers from\nthe problem that I raised. You're saying that even in a\ncase in which the statute doesn't address speech but\naddresses conduct, crossing a property line, there is a\nspeech implication and every one of those trespass cases\nbecomes a First Amendment overbreadth case. Isn't --\nisn't that correct?\nMR. BENJAMIN: I agree that the challenge can be\nmade if counsel sees fit to do so, but of course, he's\nbound by the State's ethical requirements. And the -- the\nissue won't be there in most cases. There is no policy\nthat is going to be as vague and overbroad, so pervasive\nin its effect on First Amendment freedoms as well as --\nQUESTION:\nvery, very, very, very vague that's when it becomes a -- a\nFirst Amendment problem even though it -- the statute\ndoesn't address speech. Is that basically it?\nMR. BENJAMIN: Your Honor, yes.\nQUESTION: How could we administer that?\nMR. BENJAMIN: It's not -- what you administer\nis what has always been administered, the requirement of a\nfinding of substantial overbreadth.\nQUESTION: Do we -- do we have any -- any\noverbreadth cases that -- that would support that? I\nmean, our overbreadth cases start with -- with a speech\nclaim and says, well, maybe you can stop my speech, but\nyou can't stop his. Do -- do you have any authority\nfor --\nMR. BENJAMIN: I don't think that in Chicago v.\nMorales that there was any claim that the petitioners in\nthat case were involved in expressive activity.\nQUESTION: I thought they wanted to have a\nparade or a -- a --\nMR. BENJAMIN: That was --\nQUESTION: -- an assembly of some sort.\nMR. BENJAMIN: I think, Your Honor, that was in\nForsyth County.\nQUESTION: Oh.\nMR. BENJAMIN:\nfor example, where admittedly in Watchtower, Jehovah's\nWitnesses were engaging in expressive activity, but there\nwas nothing about the facts of that case or the ordinance\nthat suggested that anyone in nonexpressive activity would\nnot have been able to raise the substantial overbreadth\nchallenge. If it had been Girls Scouts, for example.\nQUESTION: No. I think that was a First\nAmendment. What about Morales? What -- what did Morales\ninvolve?\nMR. BENJAMIN: That involved the Chicago anti-\nloitering statute.\nQUESTION: Street corner assembly.\nMR. BENJAMIN: Right. In a police -- a two-\npart test, the police --\nQUESTION: Their -- their right to gather and\nassemble. I -- that's sort of First Amendment stuff,\nisn't it?\nMR. BENJAMIN: I don't know that this Court\nreached it on that point. It -- the Court did reach\noverbreadth, but didn't decide on overbreadth because the\nstatute -- see, the ordinance explicitly by its terms did\nnot reach First Amendment freedoms or protected activity\nbecause you had to be doing something with no apparent\npurpose.\nQUESTION:\nwanted to do was to -- was to gather with his buddies on\nthe street corner.\nMR. BENJAMIN: Under that ordinance, it wasn't\nillegal. That didn't violate the ordinance because that\nwas an apparent --\nQUESTION: Yes, it did, and one of them was a\ngang member.\nMR. BENJAMIN: It did not because if he wanted\nto do it for an apparent purpose of expressive activity,\nthen it didn't violate, and so that was not a problem.\nIn this case we have the extraordinary situation\nthat a person must have government permission, police\npermission to walk a street, to use a sidewalk, and his\nright to do this depends entirely upon the completely\nunfettered discretion of the police and a government\nofficial. If someone wants to go onto that sidewalk and\npass out literature, they must get permission. They must\nget Gloria Rogers' permission, and she can give that\npermission or deny that permission in accordance with\nwhatever criteria she uses at any given moment.\nThe First Amendment problems with this case are\nsubstantial and pervasive. The Virginia Supreme Court saw\nthat and dealt with it while it was there, seeing nothing\nredeemable about this policy whatsoever.\nQUESTION:\nMr. Hurd, your time is expiring even as we\nspeak.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: So the case is\nsubmitted.\nMR. HURD: Thank you, Your Honor.\n(Whereupon, at 11:03 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n"
