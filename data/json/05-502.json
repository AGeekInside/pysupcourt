        "content": "(10:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst today in Brigham City, Utah v. Stuart.\nMr. Gray.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY S. GRAY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GRAY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn cases involving safety exigencies, an\nofficer's actions should be judged against a single\nobjective standard of reasonableness, that is, whether\nthe facts and circumstances known to the officers at\nthe time of entry would warrant a reasonable person in\nbelieving that immediate intervention is needed to\npreserve the peace and protect others from harm. When\nofficers have reason to believe that violence is\nimminent or ongoing, they meet that standard.\nIn this case, the Brigham City officers\nresponded to a complaint at 3:00 a.m. and, upon\narriving, witnessed a violent and tumultuous struggle\nbetween four adults and a teenager. The officers --\nwhen the juvenile threw a punch is when the officers\nacted and thereby prevented injury. This is exactly\nwhat we would expect officers to do.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What were they doing in the\nyard anyway? This sort of occurred to me. They\ncouldn't have seen that until they went into the fenced\nbackyard violating the curtilage of the property. How\n-- was that justified?\nMR. GRAY: Yes, it was justified. At that\ntime what they heard from the curb side and then from\nthe front was the same kind of violence going on. They\nheard that from -- from the time they arrived all the\nway. They -- they heard the thumping, the shouting,\nsomeone saying, get off me, stop, stop. And so what\nthese officers were doing, in the course of that, is\ninvestigating that -- that, and it led them to the\nbackyard.\nNow --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is any less required to --\nto go into the curtilage than is required to go into\nthe house?\nMR. GRAY: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. It's the same test?\nMR. GRAY: Yes. And again, that was --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you say that even if he\ndidn't see him throw the punch and -- and draw blood,\nthey could have gone in just because they heard\nsomebody say, stop, stop, get off me?\nMR. GRAY: It's our position that they could\nhave, though that's a much closer case. In this case,\nthe officers acted in a very guarded manner. I mean,\nthey -- they proceeded and they investigated step by\nstep and, in fact, did not enter until a punch was\nthrown and there was --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So what -- what you're\nsaying is they've got to have a reasonable ground to\ntake the first step. That may not be a reasonable\nground to have taken the second step right then and\nthere, but it's the same reasonableness standard.\nMR. GRAY: Yes, it is.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's -- that's --\nMR. GRAY: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: One thing that was left\nout of the succession of acts -- Utah provides for\ntelephone warrants, and there was no attempt to do\nthat. Once they checked to -- to determine that there\nwas probable cause to enter, they could have called for\na warrant, but they didn't. Is there a reason why they\ndidn't?\nMR. GRAY: Yes. The reason is where there's\na violent situation, things can change in seconds. I\nmean, it can turn deadly in seconds. They don't have\ntime. Even though a telephonic warrant would certainly\nbe a more speedy process of getting a warrant, it's not\nspeedy enough where punches are being thrown. I mean,\nit can turn deadly, one blow could give someone a\nconcussion or even rupture a spleen.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you don't -- you don't\nreally mean that if they saw somebody inside with a gun\nand they heard him saying, I'm going to shoot you in 2\nminutes, since they could have gotten a telephone\nwarrant, they would have to had to get a telephone\nwarrant?\nMR. GRAY: No, not at all.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you -- you don't\nwant the -- the telephone warrant requirement to -- to\nup the ante on -- on what it takes to -- for the police\nto go in without a warrant, do you?\nMR. GRAY: No. In fact, precisely for that\nreason, the officers would not need a telephonic\nwarrant in that situation no more than they would need\na telephonic warrant in this situation. Time is of the\nessence. Violence --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it wouldn't be of the\nessence if you know you have 2 minutes. You know I'm going\nto kill you in 2 minutes.\nMR. GRAY: Well, that -- that's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you really want the\npoliceman to say I got 2 minutes, you know, dial in and\nget a warrant? That's ridiculous.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GRAY: That -- that would be assuming --\nthat would be assuming that you could take someone who\nis threatening in that manner at his word. I don't\nthink that's something the officers could -- could\nafford to do.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are the police instructed\n-- the city police instructed about when the telephone\nwarrant procedure is appropriate?\nMR. GRAY: That I -- I do not know. I assume\nso. They have procedures in place, but that I do not\nknow.\nJUSTICE ALITO: When you speak about a\nviolent situation, would that be limited -- would that\napply here just because a punch was thrown, or would it\nbe enough that the officers saw some men restraining\nthe young man, or would it be enough if there were\nviolent words being exchanged?\nMR. GRAY: With -- with violent words,\ngenerally not, though if it's accompanied with a show\nof immediate force or violence, then yes, in that\nsituation.\nIn this situation, I believe that officers\ncould have entered prior to the punch being thrown.\nWhat they witnessed is -- is this violent struggle\nbetween four adults and a teenager. They had no idea\nwhether or not they were trying to molest the -- the\nteenager or whether the teenager was an intruder or\nwhat happened. But they could tell that it was\nviolent. They knew that alcohol was involved based on\nthe circumstances as they approached.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Did they know that minors\nwere involved? The record doesn't show that, at least\nin the preliminary direct exam of the officer.\nMR. GRAY: That minors were involved?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. I mean, they knew\nthat once they got into the backyard. Did they know\nbefore they got into the backyard?\nMR. GRAY: They knew that minors --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Or did they just know that\nminors stay up late at night?\nMR. GRAY: They knew that minors were in the\nbackyard. They -- they witnessed the two juveniles.\nThey did not know that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's after they went\ninto the backyard.\nMR. GRAY: No. They saw that from the\ndriveway, through the -- the slit -- slit -- slats in\nthe fence.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: They could see that they\nwere minors.\nMR. GRAY: Yes, yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How much -- you've\nbeen focusing on the violence because of the punch\nbeing thrown, but I gather they were called originally\nbecause of concern about the noise and disturbance of\nthe peace and all that.\nMR. GRAY: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that a sufficient\nbasis for them to have gone into the backyard and\nproceed from there?\nMR. GRAY: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They're just\nshouting. There are five people in the house shouting.\nIt's 3:00 in the morning or whatever. Is that -- is\nthat enough?\nMR. GRAY: Probably not, certainly not where\nthe State is -- where the State offers as -- as the\nproffered justification safety, it would not be enough.\nThat would be a different justification for their\nactions. Certainly where they're disturbing the\nneighbors, we would argue that the expectation of\nprivacy had diminished in that home because of that\ndisturbance. But again, where the State -- or where\nthe city is offering as a justification safety, that\nwould not be sufficient to go in.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but if -- if the -- if\nthe complaint were -- were simply a complaint of noise,\nand they got to the -- the gate, the back fence, and\nthey could hear all the racket inside and there didn't\nseem to be any practical way to get people to come to\nthe fence to talk to them, wouldn't they have had the\nright to go through the gate and at least go up to the\ndoor and bang on the door?\nMR. GRAY: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So they could have gotten\nthrough the curtilage. They could at least have gotten\nto the back door based entirely on noise.\nMR. GRAY: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. GRAY: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Except that there was a\nfront door, which they approached first. As I recall,\nthey left one of the officers in the front.\nMR. GRAY: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So they could have banged on\nthe front door.\nMR. GRAY: They -- they could have, though\nthe evidence was that -- and the trial court found that\nit was so loud and tumultuous that nobody would have\nheard it or probably would not have heard it.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But I'm a little puzzled.\nIf the noise is the cause of their being there and if\nthe noise is so loud at 3:00 in the morning that it's\nstill continuing and nobody can hear the knock on the\ndoor -- they knock on the door several times and shout\n-- would they not have the right to go in then to quell\nthe noise?\nMR. GRAY: Absolutely. All that I am\nmaintaining is that they would not be justified under a\nsafety exigency to go in. Certainly to -- as far as\ndisturbing the peace, then yes, but not where the\nproffered justification is safety.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So if you're going to rely\non the safety and the -- safety and the danger of harm,\nhow serious does the harm have to be? And I use the\nword harm as defining the -- the threshold for this\nkind of entry. What if a father was spanking his child,\nfor example?\nMR. GRAY: No. Spanking of a child would\nnot. There's no indication under most circumstances of\nan intent to injure or abuse. Now, of course, if there\nare circumstances that would suggest abuse, then\nofficers could go in.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Doesn't yelling so\nloudly you can't hear police knock at the door at 3:00\nin the morning suggest that violence is at least\nimminent or may well be associated with what they're\nhearing?\nMR. GRAY: It certainly approaches that, but\nagain, what we would maintain is there probably has to\nbe more than simple shouting. If -- if it's\naccompanied by threats or a show of force or violence,\nthen certainly they could go in.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is there, in addition to the\nsafety rationale which you're -- justification, which\nyou're arguing here -- is there a justification to go\nin to stop an ongoing felony whether safety is involved\nor not?\nMR. GRAY: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is -- is that a separate --\nMR. GRAY: Yes. That --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you see a guy\nturning out counterfeit dollar bills, $100 bills, and\ncan you go in right away if you see him doing that?\nMR. GRAY: Well, it's a crime ongoing, in\nprogress. So there certainly could be made an\nargument. Now, whether or not there's an exigency, I\nthink that's doubtful because police could secure the\nscene and secure a warrant and then execute that\nwarrant.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I mean, but if that's\nthe case, you have a much easier argument. Wasn't\nthere an assault here? There was clearly an assault.\nMR. GRAY: Yes, and certainly where officers\nhave reason to believe that there's an ongoing assault,\nofficers can enter.\nNow, one of the problems with the Utah\nSupreme Court's holding in this case --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In connection with the\nanswer you just gave, it doesn't matter then? If it's\nan ongoing crime, they can go in? It doesn't matter\nwhether it would be a misdemeanor or a felony? It\ndoesn't matter how grave the crime is?\nMR. GRAY: Well, this Court in Welsh\nindicated that minor offenses -- you couldn't rely on\nthe exigent circumstances exception, or at least it is\nwhat it suggested. But certainly an assault, under\nUtah law, is a class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to\n6 months in jail, and that's certainly of sufficient\ngravity to justify officers entering.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Any kind of assault.\nI gather it's an assault if you're just sort of a\ncouple of guys pushing each other back and forth.\nMR. GRAY: Well, under Utah law, an assault\nis defined as unlawful force or violence so as to --\nwith an intent to do bodily injury. Now, pushing --\nthere's not that there.\nNow, one of the chief problems or primary\nproblems with the Utah court's decision in this case is\nit creates a complicated and confusing bifurcated\nstandard that forces officers unrealistically to choose\nbetween roles, to choose whether or not they are going\nto enter and act as caretakers or enter and act as law\nenforcement officials.\nWell, the reality -- first of all, it's --\nit's very difficult for officers to try to make those\nkind of judgments in the heat of the moment, and this\nis precisely the kind of a -- the kind of case where\nthat would be impossible to achieve because officers in\nthis case are acting clearly under both roles. They're\nstopping crime and they are also protecting others from\nharm. We want officers to rescue people from harm when\nthey have a reasonable basis to do it, not wait until\nyou have to call an EMT. That's what Mincey provides.\nAnd if there are no further questions, I\nwould reserve the remainder of my time.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just ask this one\nquestion, if I may, if you have -- did the other side\npreserve the right to challenge this entry under the\nUtah constitution?\nMR. GRAY: No, they did not, and -- and the\nUtah Supreme Court recognized that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nGeneral McNulty.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL J. MCNULTY\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. MCNULTY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nmay it please the Court:\nThe Fourth Amendment does not require police\nofficers to stand by and be a spectator to escalating\nviolence in the home when such an officer has an\nobjectively reasonable basis to believe, given the\ntotality of the circumstances, that prompt action is\nnecessary to prevent imminent harm.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if there were no\npunch in this case, would they have had a sufficient\nbasis? 3:00 in the morning, loud shouting. Can they\nconclude, based on their experience, that's likely to\nescalate into violence and enter on that basis?\nMR. MCNULTY: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. In\nthese facts, the Government suggests they would.\nThe -- under the Fourth Amendment, a police\nofficer may enter a residence --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's just because\nit's loud? Suppose they were just singing and\nlaughing?\nMR. MCNULTY: Well, it would depend on -- if\n-- if words are going to be the key --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: One thing leads to another.\nRight?\nMR. MCNULTY: Well, that's correct. It\ndepends upon, of course, what those words are. It's\nreally a combination of the words and the context of\nthe words. Here you have --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So there has to be some\nindication of the likelihood of escalation into\nviolence?\nMR. MCNULTY: Correct, Your Honor. That's --\nthat's --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, why? What if they're\njust so loud that it's perfectly obvious they're\nkeeping -- getting -- the neighbors are awake and\ndisturbed by it. Does it have to be a threat of\nviolence?\nMR. MCNULTY: Well, Your Honor, if there's a\nloud noise alone, certainly the neighborhood shouldn't\nhave to be a hostage to that noise, and the police\nofficers may be acting reasonably to do what is\nnecessary to end that noise. But it's going to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So then it doesn't matter\nwhat's being said.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So then it does matter.\nMR. MCNULTY: But the -- what's being said\nmay determine -- may determine -- whether or not entry\nis necessary to respond to an imminent threat where a\nprompt response is critical.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It may determine what is\nnecessary to prevent harm, but what if it's not\nnecessary to prevent harm, just necessary to prevent\nnoise?\nMR. MCNULTY: Then it may still be\nreasonable. It may still be reasonable, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me the harm\ninquiry in this case is, you know, sort of superfluous.\nWe don't even have to look at that.\nMR. MCNULTY: I agree, Your Honor. It may be\nthat the -- the noise alone could justify the\ncircumstance. Certainly we wouldn't want a test that\nexcluded words only --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, no. You -- you don't\nwant to say that. The noise alone wouldn't justify\ngoing in without knocking as would the -- a scene of a\nviolent event occurring. Certainly you'd have to knock\non the door. Now, if they didn't hear you and the only\nway to get their attention to stop the noise is to go\nin, fine, but wouldn't you have to knock on the door\nreal hard before you went in to stop the noise?\nMR. MCNULTY: Justice Scalia, in most cases a\nknock on the door would -- would be appropriate thing\nto do.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not appropriate. Necessary.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Necessary.\nMR. MCNULTY: Well, it may very well be\nnecessary depending upon the totality of the\ncircumstances.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I hope so. I mean -- people\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but we've got a case\nin which knocking on the -- the noise is so loud nobody\ncan hear the knock.\nMR. MCNULTY: That's why a knock on the door\nmay not always be the right thing to do. In some cases\nit could be a futile gesture. In this case, the police\nannounced themselves and were not heard because of that\ntumultuous --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And they did knock on the\ndoor, yes.\nMR. MCNULTY: They entered and announced\ntheir presence, and they were not heard when they did\nthat. So the knock is -- is normally the appropriate\ncourse, but in certain circumstances, the knock may\neither be futile, it could be dangerous, depending upon\nwhat was happening, and it certainly could waste some\ntime if it was a dire emergency.\nThe -- under the Fourth Amendment, a police\nofficer may enter a residence without a warrant when a\nreasonable officer could conclude, given again all the\ncircumstances, that an impending threat to life or\nsafety justifies immediate intervention and the scope\nof the intrusion is reasonable in relation to the\nnature of the emergency.\nWhether the officer was subjectively\nmotivated to enforce the law or render aid has no\nrelevance in a constitutional inquiry. Volatile\nsituations involving violence in the home can escalate\nin -- in seconds, and the on-the-scene, split-second\njudgment about exactly when the police officers should\nintervene is precisely what the totality of the\ncircumstances test has long addressed and resolves the\nbalance of the Fourth Amendment values.\nAnd this Court's recent decision in Georgia\nv. Randolph contains a clear expression of concern for\nthe need for the police to take prompt action to\nprevent harm in domestic violence cases.\nIn this case --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This wasn't -- this wasn't\na domestic violence case. It wasn't anybody inside\ncalling the police and crying, danger, rescue me. It\nwas an outsider who complained about the noise. So I\nam wondering why you are emphasizing the prevent\nsomebody from being hurt instead of they're disturbing\nthe peace and the police have a right to protect the\nneighborhood. It seems to me that that's an easier\nargument to make.\nMR. MCNULTY: It is, Justice Ginsburg, to\nlook at the -- the threat to the quiet of the community\nas one aspect of this. But the case contains even\nmore. The case contains a punch that did some harm to\nanother person in a kitchen setting where there is a\nstrong possibility of escalating violence. It's the\nadditional facts of that violence that was a potential\nthere, added to the noise and the evidence of underage\ndrinking, that made the totality of the circumstances\nobjectively reasonable for the officers to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, counsel, let's\nsuppose you have a police officer who knows there's\nevidence in this house, but he doesn't have probable\ncause to get a warrant. And he also knows that the\nfamily is going to be reenacting the murder scene from\nsome movie as part of the family reunion. And so he's\nthere just at the time where the -- in the scene the\none guy says, and now I'm going to kill you with this\nknife, and he says, ah, and he goes in.\nNow, subjectively we know that he has no\nbasis for fearing violence, but a reasonable officer on\nthe scene, hearing somebody say I'm going to kill you\nwith this knife, would have a basis for entering.\nSo under your test, is that entry permissible\nor not?\nMR. MCNULTY: Permissible, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Really.\nMR. MCNULTY: Because there the officer is\nunaware of the fact based upon the -- as I understood\nthe facts presented, unaware of the fact that that is\nnot --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, no. He knows.\nHe knows. He heard this is what they do at the family\nreunion. They always reenact this.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So he knows that\nthere's no -- well, but that's the difference here\nbetween looking at the subjective motivation or what an\nobjective, you know, officer would understand.\nMR. MCNULTY: If the officer has specific\ninformation --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMR. MCNULTY: -- a fact knowing that this is\nnot truly an imminent threat or necessary to prompt a\nquick response, then that would be a fact in the\ntotality of the circumstances that wouldn't justify.\nBut, on the other hand --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So you're saying the\nobjective -- the -- the objective officer always knows\nat least as much as the officers actually know.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A good way to put it.\nMR. MCNULTY: The -- the officer knows --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't -- isn't that your\nstandard?\nMR. MCNULTY: Well, if -- I'm not sure if I\nunderstand the question. Would you please repeat it?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. I -- I thought you\nwere getting to the point of saying that on the\nobjective test that you urge, the officer -- the\nobjective police officer who sets the standard is\ndeemed to know at least as much as the officer on the\nscene actually knows. In other words, we don't exclude\ninformation --\nMR. MCNULTY: Right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- from our objective test\nwhen the officer actually has that information.\nMR. MCNULTY: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. MCNULTY: What makes it difficult at\ntimes is that you often have two officers. One may\nknow something, another may not know it. And that's\nwhy objective information is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Except I -- I don't think we\nlook to whether he knew that this was a family\nreenactment. I think we look to the facts that he had\n-- that had come to his attention which caused him to\nbelieve that this was a family reenactment. I mean,\nyou know, if he had read it in a newspaper or something\nelse. The facts are -- are what matter and not --\nMR. MCNULTY: Thank you, Justice Scalia.\nThat's -- I agree that that is going to -- even what\nthe officer believes he knows may be subject to error,\nand therefore, the objective test pulls us out of this\nquestion of knowing the officer's mind and allows us to\nlook at the totality of the circumstances, what really\nwas occurring and determine whether or not the\nreasonable officer would be able to enter\nconstitutionally under those circumstances.\nAnd here again is the -- a situation where\nthere was mounting evidence, and the court in Utah\nwanted to make the motivation of the officer a\nsignificant factor in determining whether or not the\nofficer could enter. Specifically, the court looked to\nthe motive or intent of the officer to render aid as\none way to analyze the situation. And the government\nargued that those distinctions -- or the distinction\nbetween rendering aid or entering for a law enforcement\npurpose is really a -- an unnecessary distinction\nbecause the officer, as the counsel for the State has\nargued, is acting in a split-second situation, seeking\n-- thank you very much, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\nMr. Studebaker, we'll hear now from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL P. STUDEBAKER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. STUDEBAKER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThere's two bases or two exceptions which\nwould allow somebody to enter into somebody's home,\nwhich are before the Court today, one being the\nemergency aid exception to the warrant requirement, the\nother one being exigent circumstances requirements for\nthe warrant.\nUnder the facts of this case, neither one of\nthose situations apply. Under exigent circumstances,\nthere has to be probable cause to enter, and there has\nto be a warrant to enter. And if neither one of those\n-- actually under exigent circumstances, there has to\nbe probable cause and there has to be the requirement\nthat there be imminent danger basically to evidence or\nto the person. And if there's not exigent circumstances,\nand the officers have an obligation to obtain a warrant\nbased upon probable cause to enter the home.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that probable\ncause was conceded, and I thought that the Utah courts\ndidn't question that there was probable cause.\nMR. STUDEBAKER: Your Honor, the -- what\nhappened was that the Utah courts found that the\nprobable cause was there for the emergency aid\nexception, but I believe under the exigent\ncircumstances requirement -- or the exception, that\nprobable cause was not there to get out -- or actually\nto get into the home on the situations.\nBut even if probable cause is conceded, the\nfact is that the facts of the case don't rise to the\nlevel of requiring such as immediate entry into a home\nto bypass the warrant requirement.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May -- may I just get back\nto your general statement? Do I understand you to say\nthat if they arrived on the scene and, you know, a\nreally wild party was going on at 3:00 a.m., they knock\nat the door, nobody answers the door, they can't hear\nit for all the screaming and the music and so on, that\nunder those circumstances, the police could not go in\nto -- to quiet things down?\nMR. STUDEBAKER: Correct, Your Honor. They\nwould actually have to go out and get a warrant to\nenter the home. There's not an exigent circumstance\nunder the facts that you presented which would require\nthem to enter the home and bypass the warrant\nrequirement. It's not severe enough under those facts.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Let's say they -- they see a\nfight going on. What kind of calculation do you think\nhas to go on in the mind of the officer? They have to\nthink, well, let me look at these people. Do they look\nlike they're -- they're strong enough to really hurt\neach other? How likely is it that they're going to\ngrab some object that's lying around, a knife, a\nbaseball bat, or something, and -- and escalate the\nviolence? What -- what sort of thought process do you\nthink a reasonable officer is supposed to go through in\nthat situation?\nMR. STUDEBAKER: Justice Alito, what the\nofficer is required to do is to weigh the totality of\nthe circumstances and make a decision based upon the\ntotality of what they see. And unfortunately, these\nsituations are always fact-intensive based upon what's\nseen on the scene. And in the case presented here\nbefore the Court, none of those facts are presented\nthat -- that would actually weigh and that was going to\nescalate into that type of situation.\nThe officers actually had personal, firsthand\nknowledge of the events that were happening. They\nstood outside the home. They watched the event\ntranspire through the window. The exigency was over\nwhen the officer entered the home.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why can't you? Is there any\ncase or anything that says you don't look at the whole\ncircumstance to decide if it was reasonable to enter?\nI mean, suppose I just wrote an opinion, for a\nhypothetical's sake, that says, look, there was so much\nnoise at 3:00 in the morning nobody could even hear a\nknock and he looks in the window, sees one of the -- a\nkid there being held, who's obviously been drinking\nunder age. He takes a swing at somebody else and pokes\nhim in the nose and blood starts to run or -- and under\nthose circumstances, of course, it was reasonable to go\nin. End of the matter.\nMR. STUDEBAKER: Except for the fact, Your\nHonor, I mean, the -- the situation we have is that is\n-- it would depend on whether it's an ongoing situation\nor not. And in the facts presented here, it was not an\nongoing situation. It ended and then the officer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You mean -- you mean the\nnoise stopped?\nMR. STUDEBAKER: It -- shortly after the\nsmack in the face by the juvenile, Your Honor, the\nofficer entered the home, and by his testimony, it\nabated right after he entered the home.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. The question is whether\nhe could go into the house, and are you saying that\nbefore he went into the house, all the noise stopped?\nMR. STUDEBAKER: It had not stopped. No, it\nhad not, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So my question is I'm\ninterested in the law of it. Why can't I -- what's --\nwhat -- the -- the Constitution says reasonable or\nunreasonable, forbids an unreasonable entry, search.\nSo this doesn't seem unreasonable. A policeman isn't a\nlawyer. He just has to do what's reasonable in the\ncircumstance. It's a huge -- well, I would be\nrepeating myself. But what I want to know is what in\nthe law makes that opinion wrong?\nMR. STUDEBAKER: Your Honor, what makes that\nopinion wrong, based upon the facts that were\npresented, is the fact that the -- there was no warrant\nachieved in the situation. If the officer is entering\nunder exigent circumstances --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And there are two reasons\nwhy he didn't want to go get a warrant. It would take\nabout half an hour, at which time all the neighbors are\nawake, and they have to lose an hour of sleep. And in\naddition to that, the underage drinking will continue\nfor another half an hour or an hour. And in addition\nto that, somebody else might get poked in the nose. So\nthose are the reasons why -- or worse. So those are\nthe reasons why he thought it was reasonable to go in.\nMR. STUDEBAKER: That may be what he thought,\nnot the officer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Those are the reasons why it\nwas reasonable to go in.\nMR. STUDEBAKER: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, what's wrong with that\nopinion?\nMR. STUDEBAKER: What's wrong with the\nopinion, Your Honor, is it still requires a warrant\nunder the situation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, suppose I were to say\nat the end of that it doesn't require a warrant because\nit was not unreasonable objectively to go in under\nthose circumstances. What I'm looking for you to do is\nto tell me why.\nMR. STUDEBAKER: Your Honor, the -- if\nthey're going to enter the home, there has to be,\nobviously, a serious situation that's going to arise.\nAnd so with the -- the presentation which you\npresented, it's not serious enough to require the\nsidestepping of a warrant in the situation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Studebaker, I'm not sure\nthat even the noise wasn't enough to justify what the\npolice did here. As -- as I recall, they -- before\nthey went in, they -- they heard all this noise and\nthey saw the punch. They pushed open the screen door\nand announced that they were the police. Okay?\nMR. STUDEBAKER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And then only went in when\nnobody heard them. Then they shouted even louder,\npolice. I'm not sure that -- that just the noise\nwouldn't be enough to allow that. If you can't hear\nthe policeman from the door, who's coming to check\nabout a 3:00 a.m. noisy party, you don't hear his knock\non the door, can the policeman not open the door and\nshout, police? Is that an unreasonable search and\nseizure.\nAnd then if you don't hear that, can he take\ntwo steps into the house? He's -- he's not looking\nunder the carpets. He's not looking in the desk\ndrawers. He's just shouting police so that he can\nbring to the attention of the people there the fact\nthat there's been a complaint from the neighbors and\nyou have to knock off the noise. I -- I would think\nthat's perfectly reasonable. Never mind the punch in\nthe nose.\nMR. STUDEBAKER: Justice Scalia, and you\nasked whether I thought it was reasonable or not, and I\nwould say it's not. The -- the -- to bypass that\nwarrant requirement, to enter the home under an exigent\ncircumstances, which is what they were there for, it's\ngot to be more serious than a -- a loud party, the\nsituation.\nAnd ironically, the -- the testimony of the\nofficer, which I guess there was a dispute about\nwhether that was there or not because it's not\nspecifically in the findings that the trial judge made\nor the two appellate courts ruled on -- but if the\nofficer entered the home and shortly after that, I\nmean, he opened the door, according to his testimony,\nand announced, basically raised his voice, and they\nheard him, why cannot he have done that outside the\nhome? And that's the situation. This wasn't a serious\nenough situation that he couldn't have made the effort\nto make his presence known outside.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They didn't hear him when he\n-- when he just opened the screen door. He had to step\nin a few more -- a few more steps. Then they finally\nheard him. That's his -- the way I understand these\nfacts.\nMR. STUDEBAKER: And, Justice Scalia, he also\nhad to raise his voice, and our contention --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, he had to raise\nhis voice. I mean, there was a lot of noise going.\nIt just seems to me so unreasonable, when a\npoliceman comes to tell people they're making too much\nnoise and the neighbors have complained, that he can't\ndo the minimum that's necessary to get their attention\nso he can tell them that. He has to go get a warrant\nto tell them that the neighbors are complaining about\ntoo much noise? That just seems absurd.\nMR. STUDEBAKER: Yes, Your Honor, he would\nhave to get a warrant. And -- and the requirement --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Does it say that in a case\nsomewhere, or is that just your opinion?\nMR. STUDEBAKER: It's my opinion, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, what I\nwould like to know is what does it say in a case\nbecause I -- I agree, at 3:00 in the morning, it might\nnot appear to many people to be unreasonable when the\nparty is so loud that no one can sleep, that they have\nto take an extra hour or half an hour or 40 minutes to\njust tell the people inside the house, knock it off.\nNow, is there a case somewhere that says -- I guess, we\ncould take a poll or something, but is there a case\nthat casts some light on this?\nMR. STUDEBAKER: Your Honor, I believe Mincey\nitself requires the -- the seriousness of the offense\nbe evaluated, and further --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Which case?\nMR. STUDEBAKER: Mincey v. Arizona.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Was that involving a -- is\nthat in this Court? Yes?\nMR. STUDEBAKER: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And was that involving a\nparty or noise, or what was it involving?\nMR. STUDEBAKER: No, it was not involving a\nparty or noise.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No. It involved -- it\ninvolved a homicide, but there, the search in question\ntook place after the premises -- after the entry, after\nthe premises were secured. The entry was never in\nquestion in Mincey.\nMR. STUDEBAKER: Correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What was in question was\nthe search after the premises had been secured.\nMR. STUDEBAKER: Correct, and --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I don't see how that\nhelps you because here, in the course of securing the\n-- the premises, they had all -- all the evidence they\nneeded.\nMR. STUDEBAKER: And -- and to answer the\nCourt's question, there is nothing that I'm aware of\nwhere this Court has come out and said that a party is\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So Mincey doesn't help.\nMR. STUDEBAKER: Correct. And so we --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I wouldn't want this\nto be the party case. This also involves violence and\nit also involves underage drinking and all three are\nthere together.\nBut I guess a policeman, where he sees or\nhears or knows a crime is going on, can take steps to\ntry to stop it so that it doesn't have to continue.\nAnd is there any case that says it depends on how\nserious a crime? Is there a case that says if it's a\nsort of minor crime, like a disturbance of the peace,\nyou have to permit it to continue, but if it's a major\ncrime like homicide, you don't have to?\nMR. STUDEBAKER: I don't believe there's\nanything that specifically says that, Your Honor. No.\nBut there are cases out there that say that\nunder the exigent circumstances, it's got to be a\nserious situation, and the question then becomes is --\nis the situation -- is the party -- is the loud noise\ncomplaint serious enough to warrant entering into the\nhome. And no, we would say it's not, Your Honor. It\ndoesn't rise to that level, especially considering the\nfact that the exigency that the officers relied upon,\nthe smack -- and it was over. The situation was\nalready under control.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it was -- it was over\nuntil somebody threw the next punch. They don't know\nwhat's going to happen the next. The kid broke away\nfrom the four people who were trying to restrain him\nonce. Presumably he might be able to do it again.\nMaybe one of the four who were restraining him might\ncome up with the idea that the best way to stop him\nfrom throwing another punch was to throw one at him.\nThe -- the police cannot make -- it seems to me on the\nfacts in -- in this record, could -- could not\nreasonably draw the assumption that there was no risk\nof further violence. Am I going wrong somewhere?\nMR. STUDEBAKER: Not completely, Justice\nSouter. But we do have a situation where only he broke\nfree from one of the adults, not three of the adults.\nHe was still under control in this situation. And he\nhad gotten his hand free and smacked one of the other\nadults, the one who was the victim in this situation.\nSo the officers -- unlike some situations\nwhere they're called out and they wander on a\nsituation, the officers in this case had personal\nknowledge of what was going on. They stood outside the\nhome and watched the event transpire. And so they\nreally need to wait and observe what's going to happen\nand wait till the last second before they need to go\nin. In this situation, there was nothing that would\ndemonstrate in the facts that it was going to escalate\nat all.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You don't -- you can't\nattribute what you just said to the trial court, and\nyou emphasize the trial court's findings. The trial\ncourt said about what went wrong what the police should\nhave done, as required under the Fourth Amendment, was\nknock on the door. The evidence is there was a loud,\ntumultuous thing going on and that the occupants\nprobably would not have heard him. But under the\nFourth Amendment, he has an obligation to at least\nattempt before entering. Now, that's a statement that\nwhat went wrong was they didn't knock even though it\nwas likely a futile act.\nDo you -- do you agree that that's a correct\nstatement of the law, that what the police didn't do\nthat they should have done was knock?\nMR. STUDEBAKER: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, they\nshould have knocked. They should have made that effort\nfirst.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't screaming, police,\nenough? I mean, as I understand the facts, he first\nopened the screen door. Now, is -- is that an entry?\nHe didn't go in. I assume the screen door opens out.\nMost screen doors open out. He opened the screen door\nand shouted, police. Now, that -- that doesn't count?\nhe has to knock on the screen door instead, even\nthough they're more likely to hear him if he opens the\nscreen door and yells, police? Why doesn't that meet\nthe requirement? I -- this -- why is the trial court\nobsessed with knocking?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that.\nMR. STUDEBAKER: Your Honor, and I think the\nreason the -- the trial court and -- is concerned about\nthe knocking issue is it's, if you will, the baseline\nrequirement under the Fourth Amendment, under the facts\nof this case, was to make their presence known by\nknocking.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the -- as I\nunderstand the -- the trial court, he accepted the\nprobability that the knock would be futile, and yet he\nthought as a formality it was nonetheless required. A,\ndo you understand the trial court to have taken that\nposition? And B, if it did, do you believe that is\ncorrect as a statement of Fourth Amendment law?\nMR. STUDEBAKER: I'm sorry, Justice Souter.\nI didn't catch the first A part.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, did -- do you\nunderstand the trial court to have taken the position\nthat even though the knock would probably have been\nfutile, the police were required to -- to make it\nanyway, to knock anyway?\nMR. STUDEBAKER: That is what the trial court\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and do you understand\nthat to be a Fourth Amendment requirement, i.e., no\nfutility exception?\nMR. STUDEBAKER: I do, Your Honor, and I know\nthat that's a -- a complicated issue, but it's still a\nrequirement. But further, the court -- the trial court\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why should there be no\nfutility exception?\nMR. STUDEBAKER: Well, even if there is, Your\nHonor, the trial court did not just say that -- there\n-- he -- the evidence was gone because of the failure\nto knock. The trial court found that the exigencies,\nas well as the appellate courts, didn't rise to the\nlevel which would require entry into the home.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that -- that may be on\nyour argument that noise is never sufficient to\ndispense with a warrant requirement. But it seems to\nme that in -- in the reasonableness analysis that the\ntrial court was going through, the trial court was\nsaying even if it would probably be futile, it is not a\nreasonable entry without a knock. And -- and I take it\nyou -- you accept that and you think the trial court\nwas correct, that there is no futility exception.\nMR. STUDEBAKER: I -- I agree, Your Honor,\nand this is why. Under, I believe, Wilson v. --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why -- why should we require\na -- a futile act in the name of reasonableness?\nMR. STUDEBAKER: Your Honor, first, it\nwouldn't have taken any effort at all to follow through\non this, and even though this Court has ruled that, you\nknow, there is mandatory knock and announce -- or\nrequirement, with some exceptions, I don't believe that\nthis is one of those exceptions.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No one is denying that. I\nmean, we've had a knock and announcement requirement\nfor 900 years.\nMR. STUDEBAKER: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the question is do you\nhave to knock and announce when, on the facts before\nyou, it is apparent that nobody will hear the knock and\nit will just be a wasted gesture.\nMR. STUDEBAKER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why?\nMR. STUDEBAKER: Because, Your Honor, it's\nour position that it's one of the -- the threshold\nrequirements to protect somebody when they're inside\ntheir home is to make that effort.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't the standard of\nthe Fourth Amendment a reasonableness standard, and\nisn't there something bizarre about saying\nreasonableness requires a totally futile gesture?\nMR. STUDEBAKER: That was the finding of the\ncourt, Your Honor, the trial court, that it was futile.\nBut, again, when an officer is placed in that\nsituation to say that if an officer can decide whether\nsomething is futile or not, that could actually -- then\nthat exception, if we're not careful, absorb that rule.\nSo I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, yes, that's why courts\nreview these things.\nMR. STUDEBAKER: Correct, and that is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And if the court says, yes,\nbased on the evidence before me, it would have been\nfutile, do you think Fourth Amendment reasonableness\nrequires the court and ultimately the officer to demand\nthe knock anyway?\nMR. STUDEBAKER: Personally? Yes. Legally?\nNo.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. STUDEBAKER: I mean, I am not going to\ntry -- but, again, this Court -- the -- the courts\nbelow did say that that exigent circumstances didn't\nrise to the level --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where did the -- where did\nthe trial court say that in the findings of fact?\nMR. STUDEBAKER: I'm sorry, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm looking at the\nfindings of fact. They're in the petition appendix at\npage 46 and 47. I don't see anything that has been\nspecifically identified by the finder of fact as\ninadequate, other than the failure to knock. Where --\nwhere did the -- where does the court say it doesn't\nrise to the level of exigent circumstances?\nMR. STUDEBAKER: Your Honor, if I look at\nparagraph 5 of the joint appendix -- or I'm sorry -- of\nthe -- of the order, it says, at that point in time the\ncourt finds no exigent --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where is it? Where is it?\nMR. STUDEBAKER: I'm sorry, Your Honor. In\nthe petition for cert filed by the State of Utah, and\nit would be appendix page 47.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but what it says\nright after that to explain is it would have been\nsufficient. What he -- what he should have done was\nknock, and that would have supplied all that was\nnecessary.\nMR. STUDEBAKER: Your Honor, and again, this\nisn't the, maybe, best worded order that the city had\nprepared in this case when they -- when the -- it was\nactually the city that prepared this, Petitioners.\nWhen I look at it, I look at two different sentences\nthere. There was no exigent circumstances, and\nfurther, what he should have done was knock.\nBut further, the two appellate courts that\nheard this matter before, did rule on the exigent\ncircumstances because that's what the Petitioners in\nthis Court had brought before the appellate courts, and\nthey found that in both the Utah Court of Appeals and\nthe Utah Supreme Court, that the exigent circumstances\nweren't sufficient enough.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You know, maybe -- maybe\nyou're taking our announce and a knock -- knock and\nannounce requirement too -- too seriously or too\nliterally. I mean, if a police officer comes up and\nthe door is open, what does he have to do? Lean over\nand knock on the side of the door? Can't he shout,\nhello, police? Don't you think that satisfies a knock\nand announce requirement?\nMR. STUDEBAKER: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You really think you got to\nknock even when the door is open.\nMR. STUDEBAKER: Your Honor, under the\nsituation, he's got to make his presence known.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. And he did that here.\nMR. STUDEBAKER: And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He stood at the door. He\nopened the screen door and said, police --\nMR. STUDEBAKER: And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- which he thought would be\nmore effective than knocking on -- on the -- you know,\nthe -- the edge of a screen door, which doesn't make a\nvery good knock.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. STUDEBAKER: And once he raised his\nvoice, though, Your Honor, and -- and made himself a\nlittle bit more vocal, then they noticed him there.\nAnd the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they still didn't\nstop. I -- I read somewhere in the facts that only\ngradually, as each participant in the melee became\naware of his presence, did they sort of stop. It\nwasn't that as soon as he entered, everything quieted\ndown immediately.\nMR. STUDEBAKER: Chief Justice, like you say,\nonce they made their presence known, it dissipated.\nThe -- the position would be if they can make their\npresence known inside the home, they can make their\npresence known outside the home and still protect that\nsanctity of the home that we're trying to insure that\npeople are protected in within their home.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, there seemed to be\nagreement that they couldn't have made their presence\nknown because the noise inside was so loud that they\nwould not have been heard.\nMR. STUDEBAKER: That's what the -- the lower\ncourts have found to be true. But Justice --\ncurrently, Justice Ginsburg, they found it to be true\nthat the exigent circumstances we're not met under\nthese facts. It wasn't serious enough to enter the\nhome without the warrant, and I think that's the pivot\npoint. Where is that line on the exigent\ncircumstances? And our position would be that that\nline -- that it's got to be serious, it's got to be\nimminent, it's got to be an ongoing situation,\nsomething where somebody is either going to get\nseriously injured, evidence is going to be destroyed,\nsomebody is going to flee.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, was there anything in\nthe facts that a reasonable officer would know from\nlooking in the window to suggest that these -- the\nadults were not -- did not have the intention of\ninflicting some sort of serious injury on this young\nman that they were restraining?\nMR. STUDEBAKER: Based upon the officer's\ntestimony at the suppression hearing, Your Honor, it\nwould be that did they not have a serious intention to\nharm him is the fact that, one, there was nothing\nshowing that they were actually doing anything more\nthan restraining them, that juvenile. There's nothing\nin the record that shows that they were beating on him,\nthat they were molesting him, or you know --\nJUSTICE ALITO: They had -- did they have any\nreason to know why they were holding him?\nMR. STUDEBAKER: I would say that they would,\nJustice Alito, and this is why. You know, all that\nthey were saying was they were trying to get the -- the\njuvenile to calm down. They were trying to get him to\nsettle down. This was a situation where the officer\ntestified that -- at the suppression hearing, that\nthere was alcohol involved, that there was a minor.\nThose types of situations don't demonstrate the fact\nthat this was an ongoing violent situation.\nAgain -- and then further, the officers were\ncalled out for a party. They weren't called out for a\nfight in progress or -- or some type of physical\naltercation. They were called out because somebody had\na loud disturbance going on. And those facts in my\nmind's eye don't rise to the level and would show the\nofficer -- especially when the officer is standing\noutside the home watching this event, that there's\nnothing that -- that would rise to the level of\nentering the home under the exigent circumstances.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The Utah Supreme Court\nseemed to be puzzled by your failure to raise the Utah\nprotection against the -- the counterpart to the Fourth\nAmendment. They seemed to suggest that their own\nconstitution afforded greater protection to the privacy\nof the home. Was there a reason why you argued only the\nU.S. Constitution and not the State constitution?\nMR. STUDEBAKER: Justice Ginsburg, I was not\nthe trial counsel below or at the appellate court, so I\ncannot determine what his matter was or what -- what\nhis basis was for that decision. And it -- then it\nwould appear that you're correct in the fact that the\nUtah Supreme Court is concerned upon that issue. But\nthe fact is that it seems to have been briefed under\nthe Fourth Amendment, has come up under the Fourth\nAmendment issues, and so that's what we're -- we're\nlooking at.\nAnd even though a State, obviously, can give\nmore protections to its citizens under a State\nconstitution, the Fourth Amendment is still a -- if you\nwill, a baseline requirement, and it still applies to\nFederal criminal courts.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask? I don't think\nthe charges are in the record. At least I missed them.\nThey were charged with -- what are the charges and how\n-- what were the penalty for what the defendants were\nexposed to? There's been no trial. They -- they\nsuppressed the evidence. I suppose the proceedings\nwere dismissed, were they?\nMR. STUDEBAKER: Your Honor, the proceedings\nhave been dismissed against my clients. That is\ncorrect.\nAnd to answer the Court's question, the\ncharges that they were facing was intoxication -- no.\nI'm sorry. Disorderly conduct, intoxication, and\ncontributing to the delinquency of a minor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What are the penalties for\nthose charges?\nMR. STUDEBAKER: Worst case scenario, Your\nHonor, they could be charged with up to 6 months in the\ncounty jail, each one consecutive to each other.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's the major matter\nwe're resolving today.\nMR. STUDEBAKER: Yes, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is the actual\nevidence that was suppressed? And to what extent is\nthat evidence that wasn't available just from looking\nin through the door?\nMR. STUDEBAKER: Mr. Chief Justice, the\nevidence was -- that was suppressed was everything that\nthe officer or officers saw once they entered the home\nand/or heard once they entered the home, basically\nanything that they obtained once they entered the home.\nThe answer to Your Honor's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Couldn't they have\ngotten all -- wouldn't he have been able to testify to\nall of that without even entering the home?\nMR. STUDEBAKER: They could have, Your Honor.\nHowever, they -- they did not. The prosecutor at the\ntime didn't proceed under that issue. I'm not aware of\nwhy he did, but what we have, though, is obviously that --\nthat may have happened. And as the Court addressed\npreviously, there may have been then an issue related\nto the curtilage which would have had to have been\naddressed or discussed.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but among the evidence\nthey did have were the two -- two teenagers are\ndrinking beer in the backyard. So they pretty clearly\nhad the alcohol -- they could have gotten that in\nevidence.\nMR. STUDEBAKER: It could have, Your Honor,\nbut I don't know why it did not except for the fact\nthat it could have been built into the curtilage --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: This wasn't kind of\nconstructed as a test case, by any chance, was it?\nMR. STUDEBAKER: No, it was not, Your Honor.\nNot at all. But --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, not by you.\nMR. STUDEBAKER: No, it was not, Your Honor.\nThat's correct.\nWhat we have, Your Honors, is a situation\nwhere under the exigent circumstances, it did not rise\nto the level which would require the -- the officers to\nenter the home without getting a warrant.\nAnd in the alternative, if they look at\nemergency aid, to enter the home under the emergency\naid doctrine, which would be the equivalent in our\nopinion to a special needs assessment, then we have to\nlook at probable cause. We have to look at their\nintent to enter because there's no probable cause to\nenter if they're performing that caretaking role to\nprotect people.\nObviously, the ultimate concern in -- in any\ntype of situation is somebody's sanctity of their home.\nIt becomes a weighing situation where trial courts are\n-- are being charged to weigh the evidence, weigh the\ncredibility of the people who testify, and then also\ntake into account the constitutional protections which\nthe parties are awarded.\nAnd we believe that based upon the facts and\nthe evidence that were -- was presented, that the three\ndifferent Utah courts that heard this matter were\nappropriate in their -- in their suppression decisions.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Gray, you have 6 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY S. GRAY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GRAY: Just a matter of clarification\ninitially. Disorderly conduct is a class C\nmisdemeanor, punishable by up to 90 days in jail under\nthe -- how it was charged here. Also intoxication is a\nclass C misdemeanor, and contributing to the\ndelinquency of a minor is a class B misdemeanor,\npunishable by up to 6 months in jail. So that's --\nthat's what -- but the officers -- and again, this case\nisn't about what they were ultimately charged with.\nIt's whether or not they had a reasonable basis to\nbelieve that immediate intervention was necessary.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Don't you think the\nevidence that was available without going in the house\nwould have supported all those charges?\nMR. GRAY: Not the intoxication. The\nintoxication has to be --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But two teenagers in the\nbackyard were intoxicated.\nMR. GRAY: The -- the juveniles. But the\ndefendants in this case were the adults inside the\nhome.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Oh, they charge that the\nadults were intoxicated.\nMR. GRAY: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, that's a serious\ncrime in Utah I guess.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GRAY: We anticipated that comment\nactually.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GRAY: And --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And what's your response?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GRAY: Normally -- normally intoxication\n-- we think of it as -- as public intoxication, and --\nand that's where it's usually prosecuted and where we\nfind it. But intoxication that can become an offense\nwhere it disturbs others outside of the home, and\nthat's what happened here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you have --\nyou have two questions presented. The second is\nwhether this was sufficiently -- sufficiently exigent\nto fall under the exigent circumstances. But the first\nwas whether the test should turn on the officer's\nsubjective motivation. I haven't heard much\nabout that this morning. How is that presented on\nthese facts?\nMR. GRAY: Well, the court created two\ndifferent tests. The Utah court created two different\ntests. And under the one test, it examined whether or\nnot the officers were primarily motivated by a desire\nto arrest or search for evidence. Now, the court, the\nUtah Supreme Court, concluded that they did -- that\nthey were -- their motives were primarily law\nenforcement motives because they did not render aid.\nAnd this Court has repeatedly held that an officer's\nsubjective motives play no part in the objective\nreasonableness test, and it should not do so here.\nJustice Ginsburg, you indicated that there\nwas no -- no suggestion of domestic violence. The Utah\nSupreme Court actually acknowledged that where violence\nis seen in a home between adults and, for example, a\nyounger person, that there would be reason to believe\nthat domestic violence is possibly present. And that's\nwhat -- now, the court refused to look at that because\nthere was no finding that the inhabitants or the --\nthose involved were actually cohabitants.\nOf course, this Court has never required that\nofficers have a certainty of the situation, only a\nreasonable belief, and they clearly have that.\nAnd in any event, whether or not it's\ndomestic violence or some other type of violence, it's\nsomething that I believe this Court in Mincey\nrecognized, that officers can and -- and probably\nshould -- maybe they didn't go that far, but it would be\nour position that officers should intervene in the face of\nviolence, and that's what the officers did here.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: My point was simply that\nthis was not a 911 call from a distressed spouse. This\nwas a neighbor saying they're keeping me up at night,\nso that the -- the police response was to the noise,\nnot to the violence.\nMR. GRAY: The initial response was clearly\nto the noise, but once the officers arrived, it became\napparent that there was violence ongoing in the house\nand that's how the officers proceeded.\nIf there are no further questions, we would\nask the Court to reverse the decision of the Utah\nSupreme Court. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
