Missouri Municipal League\nand Missouri Municipal League against Southwestern Bell.\nMr. Feldman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL PETITIONERS\nMR. FELDMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case concerns 47 U.S.C., section 253(a)\nwhich preempts State laws that prohibit or have the effect\nof prohibiting the ability of any entity to provide\ntelecommunications services.\nNow, it's common ground that section 253(a)\npreempts State laws that keep private firms from the\ntelecommunications market. The question presented is\nwhether the law also reaches into the structure of State\ngovernment and invalidating even a State statute that\ndeclines to grant the State's political subdivisions the\nauthority to provide telecommunications.\nIn Gregory against Ashcroft, this Court held\nthat Federal statutes should not be construed to intrude\non core areas of State sovereignty unless Congress has\nmade its intent to do so clear.\nNow, in our tradition, political subdivisions\nare creatures of the State and they have the authority and\nonly the authority that the State has granted them. Under\nrespondents' interpretation, section 253(a) would be a\nsharp and unprecedented break with that tradition because\nit would be a grant of power by the Federal Government to\npolitical subdivisions of powers that the State, which was\nhitherto the sole source of their authority --\nQUESTION: I don't think that's right. It\nwouldn't be a grant of power. It would be -- it would\npreserve power granted by the State itself.\nMR. FELDMAN: Well, I don't -- I'm not even sure\nwhether that's true. That actually goes into another\ndifficulty in construing the statute the way the court of\nappeals did. Some States create their political\nsubdivisions or some political subdivisions and say you\nhave only the authority that we have given you, and it's\nnot -- other States create political subdivisions and say\nyou have any authority you want except --\nQUESTION: The only -- the only thing I question\nis your statement that the statute itself is a grant of\npower to a local entity. It doesn't grant any power to\nanybody. The statute doesn't.\nMR. FELDMAN: Well, I think --\nQUESTION: It preserves power from being\npreempted.\nMR. FELDMAN: Well, perhaps it's a question of\nsemantics, but --\nQUESTION: It is.\nMR. FELDMAN: -- but -- but the -- but the --\nthe issue here is that in Missouri political subdivisions\ndo not have the authority to provide telecommunications\nservices. Under the court of appeals' ruling, the statute\nthat -- that reaches that result is preempted, and\ntherefore they do have that authority. In any event, that\nwould be a sharp break with the tradition that because it\nwould be Congress specifying what the authority of a\npolitical subdivision is even when a State has chosen not\nto give it that authority.\nQUESTION: Is it your view that in all instances\nwe must interpret this statute so that any entity -- that\nphrase -- does not include a local subdivision of the\nState?\nMR. FELDMAN: Yes, because under the Gregory\nrule, if you -- if the Court were to construe the statute\nso that it did include political subdivisions, it would be\na intrusion into State sovereignty.\nQUESTION: It would be under the circumstances\nof this case. Are there other circumstances in which it\nwould not intrude on the right of the State to allocate\npowers between itself and the localities so that this\nstatute -- so that this interpretation would have an\neffect in some other instance?\nMR. FELDMAN: The other -- I can't imagine cases\n-- and I'm not aware that any have come up in the cases\nthat have addressed the -- the question presented here --\nwhere there are some other restriction that a State has\npassed that has nothing to do with political subdivisions.\nAnd the question might arise whether a political\nsubdivision could challenge that -- that provision of\nState law as well as a private party.\nAnd -- but, however, since the Court is in the\nbusiness here of construing the statute and the question\nis what is the meaning of the word any entity, I think\nunder the Gregory rule, that -- that term has to exclude\npolitical subdivisions. And if it excludes it here, I\nthink it -- there's no --\nQUESTION: Mr. Feldman, do we need to apply the\nclear statement rule of Gregory v. Ashcroft for you to\nprevail?\nMR. FELDMAN: I think it's our understanding --\nit's our understanding that the rule would apply here. I\nguess the rule applies for the reasons I've already given,\nwhich is this is an intrusion on State sovereignty. If\nthat were not the case, the question would be whether a\ngeneral term like the term, any entity, is whether that\nwould just naturally be construed to extend so far or\nwhether it wouldn't.\nQUESTION: Exactly.\nMR. FELDMAN: And I would say that it raises the\nquestion that I was -- the -- the problem that I was\nreferring to before in responding to Justice Stevens,\nwhich is State -- the application of 253(a) would depend\non the form in which a State chooses to give or not give\nits power to its political subdivisions. If it was a\nState -- a home rule State where the cities have all the\npowers except what's expressly denied them, then a State\nthat tried to pull back the power to provide\ntelecommunications -- that would be preempted. In another\nState --\nQUESTION: Are those home rule States\nestablished in that fashion by the State constitutions?\nMR. FELDMAN: I think so sometimes.\nQUESTION: In which case the language of section\n253(a) which says no State or local statute or regulation\nor other State or local legal requirement may prohibit or\nhave the effect of prohibiting. I'm not sure that -- that\nwould reach a constitutional question.\nMR. FELDMAN: It would at least be a difficult\nquestion to try to figure out whether there is still\nsomething that prohibits or has the effect of prohibiting\nrather than something which just never granted the\nauthority before. You could consider a political\nsubdivision of a State that's a special purpose water\ndistrict or fire prevention district that just doesn't\nhave the authority, was never intended to have the\nauthority, and nothing in State law suggests that it\nshould have the authority to provide telecommunications.\nIt would be hard to find something that should be\npreempted in that case.\nQUESTION: Suppose you didn't give that very\nbroad meaning to any entity, but you included State\nentities that had been in the business and were otherwise\nauthorized by State law to go into this business and then\nthe State changes its law and without having a section (b)\nrequirement, because you have loads of power under section\n(b), so we assume the entity meets section (b)'s test, but\nit passes another law which says, by the way, the\nmunicipality can't go into it. And previously they had.\nSo -- so we're not -- we're -- we're talking about only\nentities that have proved themselves fit, willing, and\nable to offer the -- the -- to offer the business.\nMR. FELDMAN: I -- I don't --\nQUESTION: Now, why -- why would that not be\nincluded?\nMR. FELDMAN: I -- I don't think it -- because I\n-- I think that there is -- it's very difficult to imagine\nthat Congress intended that the -- the scope of this\nstatute should turn on the exact historical steps --\nQUESTION: No, no.\nMR. FELDMAN: -- that they once had or --\nQUESTION: But what we want -- we want -- we\nhave implicitly there and it would be necessary in the\nState case but not in the private entity case an entity\nthat is fit, willing, and able. And -- and an entity that\nis fit, willing, and able can include a municipality. So\nwhat this statute is after is the State passing a new law\nchanging the status of an entity that was previously fit,\nwilling, and able.\nMR. FELDMAN: But I guess what I was responding\nto was it's not -- the -- the definition of what a\npolitical subdivision is fit, willing, and able to do is\nsomething that -- it is a creature of State law. It's\ndefined by State law, by the State laws that have --\nQUESTION: That -- that's correct, but it's\ndefined by State regulatory law in respect to those\nentities at least that have previously offered the\nbusiness.\nMR. FELDMAN: I think there's actually very few\n-- before 1996, I think there were very few -- and I'm not\naware of examples. There may be a few in the amicus\nbriefs. There are very, very few entities in this country\nof these political subdivisions that offered\ntelecommunications services. This is a question that has\nonly arisen --\nQUESTION: You see, in other words, but your\nargument here is coming down to the difficulty of trying\nto draw the distinction I'm suggesting.\nMR. FELDMAN: I think that -- I think part of my\nargument is the difficulty of drawing that distinction,\nbut the most important part of it is that this is an\nintrusion into a State's understanding of its government\nand what it wants to do with its authority. And where a\nState --\nQUESTION: If the -- if the statute were clear,\nif it said public -- it said any entity, public or private\n-- but you're -- you're making an argument now that seems\nto say no matter how clear this was, there would still be\na vulnerability.\nMR. FELDMAN: No. I don't -- I don't think so.\nI think there would be interpretive problems that would\narise in the statute if it had said -- specified any\npublic -- any governmental entity or something like that\nthat really would have clearly referred to States and\npolitical subdivisions.\nQUESTION: Well, wouldn't -- wouldn't any --\nMR. FELDMAN: That would have been --\nQUESTION: -- any entity, public or private,\nwouldn't that do?\nMR. FELDMAN: I think it's likely that that\nwould do. The problem here is that any entity is just the\nkind of general term without the -- the reference to\npublic or private or without specific references to State\ngovernments and political subdivisions. It's just the\nkind of general term that this Court referred to in Raygor\nand said that where there's a clear statement rule, that\nkind of general term is not sufficient to overcome it.\nAnd here, there's nothing in the statute that suggests\nthat Congress thought about, considered, and intended to\nput into question the issue of State sovereignty that\nwould be -- that -- the intrusion on State sovereignty\nthat would be raised by construing 253(a) the way the\ncourt of appeals did.\nBeyond the statute itself, in the legislative\nhistory there's -- there is a -- the committee report\nrepeatedly refers to the private sector deployment of\nadvanced telecommunications as what the bill is designed\nto achieve. Not only that, the floor debates -- they're\ncited in, I think, Southwestern Bell's reply brief -- show\nalso people consistently referring to the private sector\ndevelopment of advanced telecommunications.\nQUESTION: May I ask you --\nQUESTION: Isn't it also the case --\nQUESTION: May I ask you this one more sort of\ngeneral question? As I understand your theory, you read\nthe statute as an anti-monopoly statute. No State shall\ngrant any exclusive privilege. Isn't that -- you say\nthat's really what it does. And my question is if that\nwere the purpose, why wouldn't they write it that way that\nno State shall grant a monopoly or grant exclusive\nprivilege?\nMR. FELDMAN: It actually is broader than that.\nThere is another provision which says -- I don't remember\nthe number -- which says that there can't be exclusive\nfranchises. This is intended to get at laws not only that\nwould by terms give an exclusive franchise or keep a\nparticular company out of the telecommunications business,\nbut also that would have the effect of doing that by\nimposing high taxes on one category of -- of participants\nrather than on another category. There -- there's the --\nin fact, in the Texas case that came before this, the\nFederal Communications Commission found a couple of\nprovisions of Texas law preempted because they did just\nthat.\nAnd the statute was designed -- it is an anti-\nmonopoly law, but it is a little bit broader than just\ngranting exclusive franchises. It's also favoring one --\nat one -- one company or one class of company or the\nincumbent telephone company over other new entrants into\nthe field.\nRespondents cite the -- Lead-Deadwood case as\nthe closest that they can come to this, and I'd just like\nto point out that that case has a dramatically different\nquestion than the one here. In that case, there was no\nquestion of the Federal Government giving authority to\nlocal -- to political subdivisions that the State itself\nhad not -- had not given. That case would be much closer\nto this case if, for example, the State there had said we\ndon't want our political subdivisions to be providing\neducation because we do that at the State level, and then\nthe political subdivision had taken the Federal money that\nwas at issue there and said we want to open up a local\nuniversity or something. At least that would have\npresented the question that's presented here of an\nintrusion of that sort on State sovereignty, but that\nwasn't before the Court there and therefore the Court\ndidn't apply a clear statement rule.\nQUESTION: What is the United States' position\nabout utilities, public utilities, electric companies?\nMR. FELDMAN: I'm not sure what you mean. If\nyou mean by public utilities companies that are in the\nbusiness --\nQUESTION: To enter this business.\nMR. FELDMAN: Yes, they certainly can.\nPrivately owned companies that are in the utility\nbusiness --\nQUESTION: Suppose it -- suppose it's mixed\nownership, city and private.\nMR. FELDMAN: The Federal Communications\nCommission's position is if, under State law, it's treated\nas a private entity, the fact that stock, some or even all\nof the stock, is owned by the political subdivision\nwouldn't be -- it would still be an entity. It would be\n-- if it's treated under State law as a private company.\nIn this case, the FCC looked at Missouri law and\ndetermined, I think, correctly -- it hasn't been\nchallenged here -- that this is simply a law that prevents\npolitical subdivisions as political subdivisions from\nproviding telecommunications services, and therefore,\nsince it's really operating on the political subdivision\nitself and not on some other corporation, it's not\npreempted.\nI'd like to reserve the balance of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Feldman.\nMr. Molteni, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD MOLTENI\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER NIXON\nMR. MOLTENI: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please\nthe Court:\nThe Eighth Circuit interprets entity to include\npolitical subdivisions of the States, and that would mean\nthat Congress has -- it would have the effect of Congress\ngiving Missouri's political subdivisions authority that\nthe -- the very State that created them has withheld. And\nthat would intrude drastically on the structure of State\ngovernment.\nA general language term like entity is too broad\nto meet the Gregory test because it doesn't clearly and\nunmistakably include State subdivisions. If -- if the\ngeneral term entity, without a contextual compass, as it\nappears in 253(a), satisfies the clear and unmistakable\ntest, then clear and unmistakable really has little\nmeaning.\nBut that standard is important to the States\nbecause it gives the States some notice and opportunity to\nreact to proposed legislation that may intrude on State\nsovereignty, and it requires Congress to be clear in the\nwording that it uses and to demonstrate cognizance of the\nimpact of legislation on State sovereignty.\nQUESTION: Why isn't any entity clear? I mean,\nwhat --\nMR. MOLTENI: Justice Scalia --\nQUESTION: What do they have to say to make any\n-- any entity clear? Paren, and we really mean it?\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Or it has to say any entity\nwhatsoever? Would that be clear?\nMR. MOLTENI: Justice Scalia, there are no magic\nwords, and we're not asserting that there are magic words\nthat need to be there. There has to be some terminology\nwithin the statute that -- that demonstrates that Congress\nwas cognizant it intended to intrude on State government.\nThere are other instances -- and I think Southwestern\nBell's brief does a nice job pointing out that entity is\nused 600-and-some times in various statutes. It's used\nmultiple times even in the Telecommunications Act,\noftentimes with a modifier, sometimes without, and\noftentimes with a definition, and sometimes the definition\nis one -- it includes just a business context, and\nsometimes the definition is one that includes government\nand public and State, private, political --\nQUESTION: But it's perfectly clear that this\nstatute does intrude substantially on the -- on the\nState's ability to regulate. Just even if it just does\nwhat you say, it's a significant impairment of the State's\nability to run its own affairs.\nMR. MOLTENI: It's a -- Justice Stevens, it's a\nsignificant restriction on the State's ability to -- to\nimpact commerce.\nQUESTION: To regulate private companies.\nMR. MOLTENI: But this Court has held in the\nGregory v. Ashcroft case that Congress has to use more\nthan the general language. It has to be clear and\nunmistakable.\nAnd, Justice Stevens, in -- in the -- the\nLeadwood case that -- that Mr. Feldman brought up, your --\nthe dissent that -- that you wrote affirms some of the\nprinciples that -- that we've cited in our brief regarding\nHunter and -- and the City of Trenton case that the States\ncontrol the -- the creations that they have, that they've\nmade, all their political subdivisions, and -- and that is\n-- is something that this Court has always honored.\nQUESTION: You're saying that it's one thing for\nthe Federal Government to supersede State regulation\nsubstantively, but another thing to say -- to tell the\nState not only do we do that, but we're going to change\nthe relationship you have with your local subdivisions.\nMR. MOLTENI: That's exactly right, Mr. Chief\nJustice. That's exactly right.\nQUESTION: Suppose they -- they did -- is it\ntotally Ashcroft you're relying on? Gregory v. Ashcroft?\nThe -- suppose you looked at the statute as\nsaying it doesn't prohibit States from enacting all kinds\nof laws that have the effect of prohibiting people to\nenter the business. Tax laws, for example, might leave\nthem without money to do it. It's only talking about\nspecific laws aimed at saying you can't enter. And if\nit's aimed at specific laws saying you can't enter this\nbusiness, then couldn't you say where a State's entity\notherwise would have the authority to enter, then the\nState cannot pass a law that says in those circumstances\nyou cannot enter telecommunications such as municipality\nas well as private company?\nNow, what's wrong with that interpretation?\nWhat I'm doing is I'm trying to deal with what I thought\nof myself and they confirm is the major objection that\nthis can't be administered once we start down the path I'm\njust starting down.\nMR. MOLTENI: Justice Breyer, I think it would\ncreate an anomalous situation where if a State's political\nsubdivisions had been providing telecommunications prior\nto 1996, they would be treated differently under the --\nunder 253(a).\nQUESTION: No, no. It would be -- the question\nwould be whether they had the authority to do it. If they\nhad the authority to do it, then the State -- what it\ncould not do is it could not pass a law which aims at\nprimarily -- aims at primarily their authority to enter\ntelecommunications. They could do all kinds of other\nthings including removing authority as long as it were\ngeneral, and then there would be middle cases where the\nauthority, you see, is --\nMR. MOLTENI: But I -- I still think, Justice\nBreyer, that what that does is it make -- it divides the\nStates into two categories and makes the Federal statute\ntreat the States in two different ways so that if a State\nhad granted authority prior to 1996, the -- they -- they\nmay never -- that State is never allowed to change its\nmind about --\nQUESTION: It's a one-way ratchet.\nMR. MOLTENI: -- about the scope of authority\nthat it grants its own political subdivisions.\nQUESTION: I -- I suppose it would also allow\nStates to adopt a -- a system of chartering corporations\nwhich charters the corporations according to various\ncategories, mining, manufacturing, and it just does not\nhappen to name the category of telecommunications. And\nthat would not be touched by -- by this type of an\ninterpretation enabling the State to create a monopoly --\nwell, to -- to exclude any -- any telecommunication\ncompany.\nMR. MOLTENI: Justice Scalia, I believe that I\nagree with you, although I think the more and more we talk\nabout what States authorize and don't authorize their\npolitical subdivisions do -- to do, the more and more that\nbecomes really the -- a State issue and -- and really what\nI -- what I would call an intramural issue that would --\nthat would be a matter litigated between the States and\ntheir political subdivisions at the State court level.\nAnd what -- what I really think this case is about is an\napplication of 253(a) that, because of the general\nlanguage that -- that Congress used, won't be presumed and\ncannot meet the clear and unmistakable standard in Gregory\nto -- to allow or at least have the effect of -- of\nCongress' intruding into the structure of State\ngovernment.\nQUESTION: So suppose that a State says that no\npolitical subdivision in this State shall have the\ntelecommunications facility that does interactive\ntelevision unless the carrier that it contracts with pays\nthe city a fee of $1 million. Could the State do that?\nMR. MOLTENI: I believe --\nQUESTION: And you'd say -- in other words, it's\nconditioning the ability of its subdivisions to engage in\nthis by demanding that it extract certain financial\nconsideration, and suppose that this is prohibitive.\nMR. MOLTENI: If -- if the State were addressing\nthat in terms -- through the private sector, I don't think\nthere would be -- I'm not sure I understand exactly where\nyour question is going, Justice Kennedy. But the -- could\n-- the State can't create barriers to entry to private\nsector competitors.\nQUESTION: Well, suppose -- suppose --\nMR. MOLTENI: That's clearly preempted by the\nCommerce Clause and -- and it's prevented specifically by\n253(a).\nAnd I think what -- what that derives from, if\none looks at the purpose of the Federal Telecommunications\nAct of 1996 and you look at the -- the history of what was\ngoing on, huge swatches of the country were provided\nservice by regional Bell operating companies and they were\ngranted the exclusive franchise in -- in areas. And the\nwhole purpose of the '96 act was to accelerate private\nsector deployment and -- and to -- to take these -- these\nswatches of territory that regional Bell operating\ncompanies maintained monopolies on and encourage private\nsector deployment and people would come in and utilize\neither those -- the -- the facilities that -- that were\nprovided -- that -- that exist that the regional Bell\noperating companies had or unbundle network elements or to\n-- to resell and -- and hopefully even the encouragement\nof -- of building their own facilities base.\nBut that's all -- that all ends up being a red\nherring discussion in terms of the clear language of\n253(a) because 253(a) uses those general terms.\nNow, the FCC's reading of entity won't bar\nStates from entering commercial phone business through\ntheir -- through their political subdivisions because the\nFCC's reading allows that States who want to go into the\nphone business -- they'll be able to do that. But States\nlike Missouri that want their political subdivisions\nfocused on core missions will be able to make that choice\nif this Court allows the FCC's reading.\nQUESTION:\ntheir municipalities to enter this business?\nMR. MOLTENI: How many States allow their own --\nQUESTION: Yes. In other words, you're arguing\nfor a position it's up to the State. They can let the\nmunicipalities enter or not if they choose. So in -- in\nfact, what has happened across the country?\nMR. MOLTENI: Justice Ginsburg, I -- I do not\nknow that. I have not surveyed which States allow their\npolitical subdivisions to -- to enter the commercial phone\nbusiness and -- and which, like Missouri, have made that\nchoice to have -- made the choice to have their -- their\npolitical subdivisions focus on their core missions.\nAnother problem that's created with the\nrespondents' reading of -- of entity is that it literally\nmeans the State cannot regulate itself, and that -- that\ncreates an anomaly and -- and it doesn't make a lot of\nlinguistic sense or a lot of public policy sense.\nThe clear and unmistakable standard requires\nmore of Congress than this use of general language and\nwhere there is doubt, States are entitled to the benefit\nof that doubt.\nIf the Court has no further questions, Missouri\nwould respectfully request that the Court reverse the\nEighth Circuit and preserve the ability of the State of\nMissouri to determine the functions of its own political\nsubdivisions.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Molteni.\nMr. Strauss, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. STRAUSS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. STRAUSS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nOur position in this case is straightforward and\nI can state it very simply. Gregory against Ashcroft\napplies in circumstances where the statutory language is\nambiguous. The Court has said that three times, including\nin Gregory itself. And the language of 253(a), any\nentity, is not ambiguous. It's not -- it's not as if\nCongress had said, for example, any corporation, which\nmight leave some doubt whether Congress meant only private\ncorporations and not municipal corporations.\nQUESTION: But it doesn't mean any fish, for\nexample. I mean, there are a lot of things it doesn't\nmean.\nMR. STRAUSS: I -- I wouldn't -- I wouldn't -- I\nguess it doesn't mean any fish, Justice Breyer, but of the\n-- I think it has a very broad meaning. I think it means\nany entity and --\nQUESTION: When you -- when you say the statute\nhas to be ambiguous, the Gregory rule as put forth in the\nopinion is that there has to be a clear statement covering\nthe Federal -- Federal aspect of the thing. And it seems\nto me that that cuts away from the idea it has to be\nambiguous.\nMR. STRAUSS: What the Court -- the Court said\nin Gregory that the statute has to be ambiguous and it\nreiterated that in Salinas and more recently in Yeskey.\nQUESTION: It depends on what you mean by -- by\nambiguous. What -- what -- the -- the language in Gregory\nwas -- was employees, wasn't it?\nMR. STRAUSS: Well, the unambiguous language in\nGregory was employee. The ambiguous language was at the\npolicymaking level. In Gregory itself -- it's a -- it's\nan important point, Justice Scalia. In Gregory itself,\nthe Court thought it was unambiguous that employee, State\nemployee, included State judges. Now, it seems to me\nlinguistically to say that State employee includes State\njudges is more of a stretch than saying any entity\nincludes local governments, but that's what --\nQUESTION: In your view does --\nQUESTION: Of course, you're -- you're into\nState already. I mean, the -- the State versus non-State\nwas not at issue in Gregory. It was just how far into the\nState you go. I mean, it -- the whole thing applied to\nState -- State employees, but not at the policymaking\nlevel.\nWhat about Atascadero? The -- the language\nthere was any recipient of Federal assistance.\nMR. STRAUSS: Yes. Atascadero, Justice Scalia,\nI think the Court has applied a different, stronger, much\nstronger, form of a clear statement rule in the State\nsovereign immunity cases where it has required specificity\nin the Court's words.\nQUESTION: I think there are various levels of\n-- of clear statement rules.\nMR. STRAUSS: Well, I think the -- the best\nillustration of that is the contrast between the Court's\ndecision in Raygor and the Court's decision in Jinks which\nhave the advantage of focusing on exactly the same\nstatutory language, any claim asserted in a supplemental\njurisdiction statute. In Raygor, the issue was whether\nthat language overrode State sovereign immunity, and the\nCourt said no. In Jinks, the question was whether that\nlanguage overrode a State's decision to immunize its\nsubdivisions, and the Court said, yes, it did. The same\nlanguage.\nJinks is the case like this. In fact, Jinks is\nmore of an intrusion because the Congress was taking away\na power that the State wanted to confer and the locality\nwanted to have, and the Court just very unanimously and\nwith no difficulty said Congress can do that with the\nlanguage, any claim asserted. Raygor was a State\nsovereign immunity question. The Court analyzed it\ndifferently.\nAnd I think that makes the point that the kind\nof rigor the Court expected in cases like Atascadero does\nnot apply in Gregory cases. In Gregory cases, if it's\nunambiguous, that's the end of the case.\nQUESTION: Does the word, any entity, cover the\nState itself?\nMR. STRAUSS: Yes, I think it covers the State\nitself.\nQUESTION: So if the Governor is about to sign a\ncontract to -- to allow the State to enter into\ncommunications facilities and the legislature instructs\nhim not to, that statute is void?\nMR. STRAUSS: No, that statute is not void,\nJustice Kennedy. I think that statute -- analytically\nthat situation is exactly the same as if a board of\ndirectors of a private corporation decided not to go into\nthe telecommunications business and the CEO defied it.\nAnd the solution is the State can say under our neutral\nprinciples of corporate governance, the CEO can't do that\nnot because the corporation is not an entity.\nQUESTION:\ncorporate governance apply to the relations between the\nState and its subdivisions?\nMR. STRAUSS: They --\nQUESTION: Suppose there's a constitutional\nprovision.\nMR. STRAUSS: They absolutely do if they are\ntruly neutral principles. If it's a provision of State\nlaw that says, for example, subdivisions may not engage in\nany commercial activity and there's no argument that\nthat's just a subterfuge to keep them out of\ntelecommunications, it's a truly neutral provision, States\ncan absolutely enforce that.\nQUESTION: But you say that it can't be made\nprecise to telecommunications.\nMR. STRAUSS: That's right.\nQUESTION: That was my example in the State\nhypothetical, in the first hypothetical.\nMR. STRAUSS: Well, the -- what's -- what's\noperating there is the general rule that Governors have to\ndo what the State legislature tells them to do.\nQUESTION: Well, here it was operating as a\ngeneral rule that subdivisions have to do what the State\ntells them to.\nMR. STRAUSS: Well, when this --\nQUESTION:\napplies in one instance and not the other, given your\ndefinition of entity.\nMR. STRAUSS: Because in the -- in the case like\nthis one, what the State has done is to enact a specific,\ntargeted rule not competitively neutral -- that issue is,\nstrictly speaking, not before the Court yet -- a targeted\nrule that keeps an entity out of the telecommunications\nbusiness. And a municipality is an entity in the same way\nthat a private firm is an entity. Congress' language was\nany entity. That language is simply not --\nQUESTION: Yes, but Raygor had any entity too\nand we said that was not conclusive there.\nMR. STRAUSS: Raygor said any claim. That's\nright. That's right, Mr. Chief Justice. But Raygor was a\ncase decided in the shadow of State sovereign immunity.\nThe Court said a constitutional doubt was created by\nprinciples of State sovereign immunity.\nAs I -- as I said to Justice Scalia, Jinks\ninterpreted exactly the same language, any claim, to be\nsufficient to allow Congress to deprive local governments\nof an immunity that States wanted to grant them.\nQUESTION: Well, that was not the only\ndifference.\nQUESTION: No.\nQUESTION:\nJinks besides -- besides just the language, any claim.\nQUESTION: And also the fact that sovereign\nimmunity had never extended -- a State Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity had never -- had never been extended to counties.\nMR. STRAUSS: Well, that's of course right, Mr.\nChief Justice. And in fact, that is the reason I want to\ntake exception with the picture painted by petitioners\nthat what -- our position here would lead to some\ndramatic, unprecedented intrusion on State authority.\nIt's actually quite familiar for Federal law to\ninterfere, quote/unquote, with the relations between State\nand local governments. Section 1983 imposes liability on\nlocal governments.\nQUESTION: But those are all under the\nFourteenth Amendment where the Thirteenth -- Fourteenth\nAmendment altered the Federal balance with reference to\nthose. That's not what's involved here.\nMR. STRAUSS: Well, I understand that the\nFourteenth Amendment has special significance for purposes\nof State sovereign immunity. I've never known the Court\nto say that the Fourteenth Amendment has special\nsignificance for purposes of Gregory against Ashcroft. I\ndon't -- I don't think that -- that is a -- a --\nQUESTION: If -- if for purposes of -- will you\nassume with me -- and I may be the only one who thinks\nthis. But I think when you use words like any entity or\nthe word any, that there's an implicit scope, and since I\nthink there's an implicit scope, I'm trying to define that\nscope. So I don't want to -- I mean, it's not going to\nhelp me for you to say, well, it's clear because I don't\nthink it's clear.\nBut at that point, I now want to -- to find out\nwhether -- explore what you said that, well, if we did\napply this to the States and their municipalities, all we\nwould really be doing is targeting laws.\nNow, I did my best to pose some questions along\nthose lines, but I was met with the answer which strikes\nme as a pretty good answer. There's just no way to do\nwhat you're suggesting. It's going to be a nightmare.\nJustice Scalia suggested one reason it was a nightmare.\nAnd I'd add that in the case of private companies, this\nstatute is designed to give the private company the right\nto enter or the right to quit. Once you apply it to a\nmunicipal entity, it has the right to enter, but it could\nnever quit. Now, that would be bizarre.\nMR. STRAUSS: No.\nQUESTION: So given the -- the sovereign\nimmunity -- you know, the sovereign -- all -- all the\nthings we've been talking about in general, given the\ndifficulty of drawing a line, which seems virtually\nimpossible or very hard, and given the one-way ratchet I\njust described, it can't be that Congress intended to\ninclude municipal entities within the scope of the word,\nany entity. What -- what is your -- that's -- I'm trying\nto get to the merits.\nMR. STRAUSS: Yes.\nQUESTION: What's your response to that?\nMR. STRAUSS: Yes. I don't agree that there's a\none-way ratchet at all, Justice Breyer. I think the --\nthe purpose of 253(a) is to eliminate barriers to entry.\nIt's not to force anyone, private or governmental, to go\ninto the telecommunications business or stay in the\ntelecommunications business. And if a -- if a local\ngovernment unit decides of its own accord to enter and\nthen decides of its own accord to leave, it is not\nprohibited anything.\nQUESTION: The State -- the State cannot tell it\nnot to enter.\nMR. STRAUSS: The State cannot tell it not to\nenter by a targeted, non-competitively neutral provision.\nQUESTION: I don't understand. Why does it\nmatter whether it's targeted or not? Suppose it lists\ncounties can enter into the following commercial\nbusinesses. It lists seven or eight. It does not list\ntelecommunications.\nMR. STRAUSS: It -- the reason why it's targeted\n-- targeted is what I'm using to embrace the notion stated\nin 253(b) which preserves an enormous realm of regulatory\nauthority to the States. States may enact competitively\nneutral regulations that satisfy certain other criteria.\nAnd that's an important part of this picture because if\nyou had 253(a) in isolation, that would -- that would\ncertainly be draconian. That would certainly be a -- a\nremarkable --\nQUESTION: Well, what -- what's your answer to\nthe hypothetical I give you? Is that targeted or not?\nMR. STRAUSS: Well, I think that would be -- if\nit -- if it specified certain commercial activities but\nnot others, I think that would be a difficult question.\nThe question would be is that a gerrymander --\nQUESTION: That's why I asked it. I mean --\nMR. STRAUSS: Well, the question -- the question\nwould be a 253(b) question for the FTC in the first -- FCC\nin the first instance.\nQUESTION: Well, it had nothing to do with\nwhether it's competitively neutral. It's competitively\nneutral. Nobody can enter except these fields. I mean --\nMR. STRAUSS: If it -- if it were a gerrymander\ndesigned to keep -- really just designed to keep entities\nout of telecommunications, it would be unacceptable.\nQUESTION: So we're going to have to get into\ninquiring into whether State legislatures -- well, of\ncourse -- of course, they didn't want it. It was designed\nto keep them out of telecommunications because it said\nthese are the only fields you can get into.\nMR. STRAUSS: That's -- that --\nQUESTION: If your question is whether it was\ndesigned to keep them out of telecommunications, the\nanswer is unquestionably yes.\nMR. STRAUSS: This -- I agree --\nQUESTION: But -- but if you say it's okay if\nthey not only keep them out of telecommunications, but\nthey keep them out of a lot of other stuff as well, does\nthat make it okay?\nMR. STRAUSS: This is the question that would\nhave to come up when the FCC applied 253(b) to a public or\na private entity --\nQUESTION: But why should we --\nMR. STRAUSS: -- public or private.\nQUESTION: Why should we interpret a statute in\nthat awkward way, that the FCC has to make this kind of\nfactual inquiry in every case?\nMR. STRAUSS: I think the FCC is in that\nbusiness with respect to private entities anyway. A\nState --\nQUESTION: What is the -- I don't even\nunderstand what the factual inquiry is. What is it --\nMR. STRAUSS: Well, the inquiry --\nQUESTION: -- that the FCC would be looking for?\nMR. STRAUSS: The inquiry -- it's 253(b). It\nsays States may enact measures that are competitively\nneutral and necessary to promote certain public\nobjectives. That's a savings clause. It's not --\nQUESTION: So the FCC is going to decide what is\nnecessary to promote --\nMR. STRAUSS: That's --\nQUESTION: -- Missouri's public objectives?\nMR. STRAUSS: That is the business -- that is\nunquestionably the business Congress put the FCC in with\nrespect to private entities. There is no disagreement\nabout that.\nQUESTION: I see the answer to that part, which\nis you're saying they have to do it anyway, and I\nunderstand that. Whether -- I'm not sure I agree, but I\nunderstand it.\nWhat about the part that it's a one-way ratchet?\nAnd there I think that local governments unlike local\nprivate businesses act through regulation, at least\nnormally. And so the statute talks about a requirement, a\nlocal requirement or a local regulation, and therefore, a\nState, State A, that does not permit its municipalities to\ngo into the business, then passes a statute that does\npermit it, then the local council passes a regulation that\nsays we'll do it, which is now a requirement, and when\neither tries to repeal either, they run right straight\ninto your -- to this statute forbidding it as you\ninterpret it. And now, that's why I say it's a one-way\nratchet in respect to municipalities, but not a one-way\nratchet in respect to private businesses.\nMR. STRAUSS: The reason it's not a one-way\nratchet, Justice Breyer, I think turns on the word\nprohibit. This isn't -- the statute 253(a) says State and\nlocal regulations that prohibit the entry. If -- if I\ndecide not to go skiing, I've not prohibited myself from\ngoing skiing. I've simply made a decision not to do\nsomething. If a local government decides not to enter the\ntelecommunications business, it hasn't prohibited itself.\nIt simply made a decision.\nQUESTION: But the State could not repeal the\nstatute.\nMR. STRAUSS: The State could not repeal the\nstatute unless it were part of a competitively neutral\nreorganization of local government or something like that.\nThen it could repeal it, but it couldn't enter a targeted\nrepeal of it without running afoul -- it seems to me\nwithout running afoul --\nQUESTION: Why -- why would Congress design such\na strange system where -- where the municipality can get\nin and then get out, but the State can't allow the\nmunicipality to get in and then decide, no, we want to\nallow them to get out?\nMR. STRAUSS: I --\nQUESTION: It's just bizarre.\nMR. STRAUSS: I think it applies -- I think for\nthese purposes, municipal corporations and private\ncorporations are simply on a par as, of course, they were\nfor large parts of our history. That's why municipalities\ndon't have many immunities. And Congress, for these\npurposes, simply saw municipal corporations as another\nsource -- implicitly saw -- and the words, any entity,\nimplicit in that sense, in the -- in the ordinary meaning\nof those words -- saw them as another source of\ncompetition.\nQUESTION: Just so I understand you, a State can\n-- can grant certain powers to municipalities, does not\nhave to grant them the power to enter into -- into\ntelecommunications activity. Right?\nMR. STRAUSS: Yes. Yes, that's right.\nQUESTION: It does not have to grant them that\npower.\nMR. STRAUSS: Well, the -- the restraint is the\ncompetitively neutral language which will ordinarily allow\nmunicipalities to say -- the States to say, look, here's\nwhat you can do and here's what you can't do --\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. STRAUSS: -- provided they aren't acting in\na way that is competitively non-neutral with respect to\ntelecommunications.\nQUESTION: Right, but -- but once they have let\nthem get into telecommunications, it's -- it's only the\nmunicipality that can decide to get out of it.\nMR. STRAUSS: No. The State could repeal the\nauthority if it does it, again, in a competitively neutral\nway. If a State decided, for example, to abolish all\nunits of local government or if a State decides to say,\nokay, we are assigning special functions to municipal\ngovernments.\nQUESTION: Okay, but -- but the municipality\nitself can say we're going to get out of\ntelecommunications.\nMR. STRAUSS: Yes.\nQUESTION: The State cannot say no -- no\nmunicipality shall do telecommunications.\nMR. STRAUSS: That's right. The municipality\ncan decide for itself because then it's not prohibiting\nanyone from doing anything. It's simply making a\ndecision.\nQUESTION: Mr. Strauss, may I go back and ask a\nvariant on Justice Breyer's question, assuming that there\nis some implicit limitation on -- on the scope of any\nentity? And it relates to what, if I have my facts\nstraight, is the -- is the drafting history in this case,\nand I'd like you to tell me whether I have got the facts\nstraight because I didn't look them up myself. I just got\nthis out of the briefs. And if so, what you think the\nsignificance is.\nAs I understand it, at least the Senate version\nof the original bill had a provision in it that\naffirmative -- expressly provided that any existing\nutility, whatever its object of service, could go into the\ntelecommunications business. And this, as -- as you point\nout at one point in your brief, this would be -- this\nwould be good for your argument because a lot of those\nutilities are municipal utilities.\nAs I understand it, in the -- in the conference\ncommittee, that language was, in fact, removed entirely,\nand subsequent to its removal in the conference committee\nreport, there were references to any private entity being\nable to go into the telecommunications business but not\nthe old, pre-conference committee references to -- to any\n-- any public as well as private entity.\nThat suggests to me, the -- the combination of\nthe drafting change and the conference committee report,\nthat the implicit scope they were getting at was an\nimplicit scope that says any entity is a reference to\nprivate, not public.\nWhat -- are my facts straight, and if so, what\n-- what's your response to that argument?\nMR. STRAUSS: Two points, Justice Souter.\nFirst, I think it is common ground that Congress did\nenvision utilities as among the any entities. And the --\nthe likely reason Congress didn't spell that out was that\nit was already included in the notion any entity, and\nCongress didn't want to begin spelling out specifics and\nrun --\nQUESTION: So you say the -- the excision was a\nredundancy excision.\nMR. STRAUSS: Yes, that's right. And I think\nthere is no dispute that not only that utilities are among\nentities, but that Congress really saw utilities as a\nprimary source of -- of competition.\nQUESTION: Okay. The answer to that I think is\nin -- in part a response to something in your brief. You\nmentioned that the original House and the original Senate\nreports were speaking, among others, expressly of -- of\npublic entities. As I understand it -- and again, I\ndidn't look myself. I just got this from -- from one of\nthe briefs. As I understand it, the conference committee\nreport -- after this excision, which is arguably just a\nredundancy excision, the conference committee report\nstarted using the adjective private entities rather than\npublic entities as being subject to this kind of universal\npreemption. Doesn't that nix the theory that it was\nmerely a redundancy excision?\nMR. STRAUSS: The conference committee report, I\nbelieve, Justice Souter, used the word private to describe\n-- in describing the sort of competition it believed would\nbe brought about. That passage from the conference\ncommittee report was then incorporated almost verbatim in\nthe preamble to the statute, but the word private was left\nout when it was transferred to the statute so that the\nword private that does occur prominently in the conference\ncommittee report -- I agree with that -- dropped out of\nthe statute, which simply talks about encouraging\ncompetition.\nQUESTION: Okay. What we're left with, it seems\nto me, is -- is at least -- maybe let's call it tension\nbetween the conference committee report and the preamble\nlanguage which was then inserted. And isn't that a\nperfect situation to provide -- to -- to apply a Gregory\nkind of rule, saying when we're not sure what they meant,\nwe want them to spell it out more clearly before we\nconclude that they, in effect, are -- are limiting the --\nthe power of a -- of a State to determine what its\nmunicipalities can do? Isn't this a good situation for a\nGregory rule?\nMR. STRAUSS: I think the ambiguity to which\nGregory refers -- I mean, I don't think. I mean, I think\nit is clear the ambiguities to which Gregory refers is\nambiguity in the statutory language.\nQUESTION: I -- I think so too.\nMR. STRAUSS: And --\nQUESTION: And -- and maybe what I'm saying is\nwe -- we ought to -- those of us who would look into the\n-- the legislative history, as I would, maybe ought to\ntake advantage of a slightly broader Gregory rule.\nMR. STRAUSS: Well, the -- the case I think that\nwould stand in the way more than any other perhaps --\nwell, many would I think, but the clearest example I can\nthink of is Yeskey where the -- the question in Yeskey\nwhether the ADA, the Americans with Disabilities Act,\napplied to inmates of State prisons. The Court assumed\nthat prisons were special and that the Gregory rule\napplied to legislation that assertedly reached prisons.\nThe Court also assumed that Congress never\nspecifically contemplated that prison inmates would be\ncovered, and it said, nonetheless, unanimously that if the\nlanguage -- the language is something like State\ninstrumentalities -- if the language included prisons,\nGregory was satisfied.\nQUESTION: Isn't the difference, though -- and I\n-- I see your argument. But isn't the difference that in\nthat case we didn't have anything in the history either of\nthe drafting or of the legislative consideration of the\nstatute that suggested that there really was an -- an\nargument each way as -- as to whether they -- they were --\nthey were intending to -- to cover the -- the prisoners.\nThey simply didn't deal with -- with that situation at\nall, and they used absolute kind of -- of language.\nHere, there is an argument to be made because\nthe drafting changed. The drafting certainly could have\nsignificance for -- for public utilities. There is a\ntension between the -- the conference committee report and\nthe preamble. In other words, we've -- we've got a -- a\nquestion sort of affirmatively raised by the history of\nthe drafting and enactment of the statute, whereas there\nwas simply silence in the Yeskey situation.\nMR. STRAUSS: Justice Souter, I guess the\ndifficulty I'd have with that approach in general would be\nit has to be common for there to be this sort of\nuncertainty in legislative history with feints in a\ncertain direction and withdrawals for reasons that are\ndifficult to -- to fathom.\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I grant you that, but when\n-- when the -- when the issue relates to the kind of State\nsovereignty issue that -- that Gregory addresses, that's a\ngood reason for having a Gregory rule.\nMR. STRAUSS: Well, but as to the legislative\nhistory, I think that sort of uncertainty is going to be\neasy to generate, and what we do have here -- in addition\nto any entity, what we do have here, not just in the\nlegislative history, but on the face of the statute, is,\nas I said, agreement I think all around that utilities are\nprominent among the entities that Congress envisioned. I\nthink that's completely clear.\nQUESTION: But would you also say that the\nlegislative history makes it pretty clear that there's a\ndistinction in meaning between the term private entity on\nthe one hand and the term entity on the other hand, and\nthe statute used the term entity?\nMR. STRAUSS: Well, that's true, Justice\nStevens. Of course, they could have said private entity\nhad they meant that. That's not -- I mean, our argument\nis any entity means any entity.\nQUESTION: So what does -- what does --\nQUESTION: Is there any argument for putting --\nleaving this up to the commission? That is, can it be\ndone? Because I can see a complex interpretation that may\nbe workable that you're suggesting and may be helpful\ncompetitively, frankly. And I also can see some good\narguments against, assuming Congress intended that complex\ninterpretation. But under those circumstances, maybe\nCongress purposely leaves it somewhat ambiguous permitting\nthe commission to go one way or the other, and although\nyou've lost it in the commission so far, maybe in the\nfuture, the commission would say, well, we think we want\nto Chevronize this, in other words.\nMR. STRAUSS: Well, I think -- I think that --\nQUESTION: What do you think about that?\nMR. STRAUSS: I think that is the scheme\nalthough not under 253(a). What the commission -- we know\nthe commission's views with unusual clarity here. What\nthe commission said is we think we've got to say the\nstatute is not preempted.\nBut as far as the purposes of the -- of the act\ngo, this is a terrible State law. All the purposes the\nState wants to be accomplished can be accomplished in less\nrestrictive ways. The commission has said that over and\nover again as emphatically as it can.\nAnd the way to Chevronize, Justice Breyer, to\nuse your term, is by saying that these -- that\nmunicipalities are entities, but that these admittedly\nsomewhat difficult issues about what special problems do\nmunicipalities pose, those should be handled under 253(b),\nwhich is what Congress had in mind. That's -- of course,\nthe States can enact laws so that there can be licensing\nrequirements and basic fitness requirements and various\nkinds of regulation --\nQUESTION: You say -- you say that that's -- I\n-- I could -- I could understand that there's no ambiguity\nif you simply say any entity means any entity. But -- but\nto say that the statute -- but you're not willing to say\nthat it says that. You're not willing to say that -- that\nthe State cannot prohibit its -- its counties from\nentering into commercial activities. That would certainly\nhave the effect, which is all this requires -- have the\neffect of prohibiting the ability of counties to provide\ninterstate or intrastate -- you're not willing to say\nthat. You -- you insist that we derive this very subtle\ndistinction between the State initially granting it and\nthen taking it away or the county taking it away itself.\nI don't think that that is unambiguously within the\nstatute at all.\nWhat's -- what the unambiguous choices are are\nthat the States are not included or that the States are\nincluded, and that means that -- that the States cannot\nexclude counties or, for that matter, even departments of\nthe State government itself from entering into the\ntelecommunications business. That would be unambiguous.\nBut if you're not willing to embrace that, it seems to me\nyou are arguing that the statute is ambiguous.\nMR. STRAUSS: As -- as to 253(a), Justice\nScalia, I am absolutely embracing that. I am absolutely\nembracing the notion -- and maybe I disagree with Justice\nBreyer about this -- that any entity means any entity, and\nI will go down the line with that.\nThe reason that doesn't lead to absurd results\nlike the maverick Governor entering the telecommunications\nbusiness against the will of the legislature is because of\n253(b). Now, 253(b) is filled with ambiguities and\ncomplexities and -- and problems that the commission will\nhave to take the first crack at.\nQUESTION: -- impact upon (a). You -- you can't\nuse (b) to explain (a) and then say, oh, yes, (b) is\nambiguous.\nMR. STRAUSS: I --\nQUESTION: If you're using an ambiguous (b) to\nexplain (a), (a) itself is ambiguous.\nMR. STRAUSS: (b) does not explain (a). (a) has\na very -- I agree with you, Justice Scalia. It has a very\nclear meaning. Any entity means any entity, and if -- it\n-- it would trivialize Gregory to say that Congress has to\nsay, and we mean any entity whatsoever. Congress has to\ncome up with a -- a definition. Any entity means any\nentity.\nIn answer to the charge that that produces\nabsurd results, I say no. Congress left a broad scope for\nState regulation, broad enough not only to deal with\nabsurdities, but broad enough so that these claims about\nincursions on State sovereignty are, I think, grossly\noverstated.\nI mean, let me draw the comparison to Gregory\ndirectly. In Gregory, Congress passed an anti-\ndiscrimination law, an age discrimination law. The claim\nwas that that law required States to give their judges --\ntheir judges life tenure, a major structural issue. And\nthe Court said, well, if they had stopped at employees,\nmaybe they would be giving judges life tenure, but they\nsaid employees at the policymaking level and that's just\ntoo ambiguous for us to think Congress was doing such a\ndramatic thing to the structure of State government.\nThis is nothing like that. This -- this statute\nsimply says that among the universe of entrants that we\nwant in this robust, wide-open, newly competitive field of\ntelecommunications, if municipal corporations, true to\ntheir roots as corporations, want to get into this\nbusiness, the States can't keep them out except if they're\ndoing the kinds of regulation that States can reasonably\ndo to private and public corporations alike. That seems\nto me not only a coherent reading of the statute, not only\none that is consistent with what everyone agrees is the\nvery dramatic pro-competitive turn that the 1996\nTelecommunications Act took, but also one that really is\nnot a significant incursion on State sovereignty,\ncertainly not an unprecedented incursion on State\nsovereignty. When decisions of this Court have held\nmunicipalities liable under the antitrust laws,\nnotwithstanding State efforts to immunize them, liable for\ndamages, notwithstanding States' efforts to immunize them,\nhave withdrawn from municipal governments States' efforts\nto grant them sovereign immunity against State claims in\nthe State court, Congress --\nQUESTION: It has nothing to do with their\nauthorities, all of those instances you mentioned. It has\nnothing to do with their authority.\nMR. STRAUSS: I'm sorry, Justice Scalia. With\ntheir?\nQUESTION: Authority under State law.\nMR. STRAUSS: Well, it has to in a sense -- I\nagree with you, Justice Scalia, it doesn't. In a sense,\nthose are more intrusive because what we have here are\nlocal government bodies who say we want to do this in\norder to serve the needs of our citizens. We don't have a\nsituation in which Congress is thwarting the will of both\nthe States and the localities. We have a situation in\nwhich localities want to do this, in some cases\ndesperately want to do this, believe that Congress, when\nit said any entity shall be free from barriers, believe\nthat Congress gave them the power to do it, subject of\ncourse to reasonable regulation by the State, only to find\nthat Gregory against Ashcroft, the decision that is\nsupposedly designed to ensure that decisions -- that\ngovernment decisions are made at a level responsive to the\npeople -- Gregory against Ashcroft is thrown up as an\nobstacle to their doing what they think is needed to serve\ntheir citizens' interests.\nAnd given what seems to me to be the unambiguous\nlanguage of section 253(a) and the very limited\ncircumscribed focused nature of what Congress has done in\nthis circumstance, it seems to me to be an unwarranted\nconclusion for the -- for the commission to reach.\nIf the Court has no further questions.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Strauss.\nMR. STRAUSS: Thank you.\nQUESTION:\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL PETITIONERS\nMR. FELDMAN: I'd like to contrast this case\nwith the Yeskey case, which came up during Mr. Strauss'\nargument. In the Yeskey case, the Americans with\nDisabilities Act referred to public entities, I think, and\nthen it defined them as including any department of the\nState. Once -- that meant that in that act, Congress had\nspecifically considered that it was going to intrude\ndeeply, as Justice Scalia said, in State government, and\nit had made the decisions of how to do it and the whole --\nin fact, title II of the act is designed to -- to tailor\nthat, exactly how Congress wanted to.\nIn this statute, there's no indication that\nCongress crossed that initial dividing line and wanted --\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. Strauss points to\nsubsection (b) of the statute as indicating Congress did\ncontemplate giving some leeway.\nMR. FELDMAN: Yes, Congress did contemplate\ngiving some leeway to the States when it was competitively\nneutral, but the question of what competitive neutrality\nmeans in this context is not an easy one.\nAnd -- and I'd like to add that if Congress had\nhad to take the -- do what it did in Yeskey and -- and\ndecide yes, we do want this to apply to the States, it\nmight have occurred to Congress that they were going to\nhave to think about exactly what that means, applying a\nstatute like this to State governments that grant their\npolitical subdivisions different kinds of powers in\ndifferent kinds of ways. Congress didn't -- never made\nthat first choice that it consciously wanted to intrude on\nState -- State sovereignty the way the Eighth Circuit\nheld, and therefore it never answered those other\nquestions.\nQUESTION: What is the rationale for saying a\nmunicipal utility, a wholly owned electric company, wholly\nowned by the city, that's okay? That doesn't matter --\nthe State can't stop that from going into the\ntelecommunications, but it can stop the municipal\ncorporation.\nMR. FELDMAN: Well, I mean, that isn't at issue\nin this case, but the FCC's rationale is that insofar as\nunder State law you have a thing that is treated just like\na private corporation, it's -- it's an entity. That's\nexactly who Congress was clearly and directly and most\nimportantly targeting this law at.
