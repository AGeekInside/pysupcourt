        "content": "[10:48 a.m.]\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Case 05-1631, Scott versus Harris.\nMr. Savrin.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP W. SAVRIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SAVRIN: Mr. Chief Justice, may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case concerns whether a police officer\ncould be held personally liable for using force to\nterminate a dangerous high-speed pursuit. The\nundisputed facts show that Deputy Scott did not violate\nthe Fourth Amendment. Respondent had led the police\nofficers on a nine-mile pursuit at exceptionally high\nspeeds. As the videotapes that have been admitted in\nevidence show, Respondent was driving on narrow two-lane\nroads at night. He swerved across the double line to\npass cars that were in his path, actually traveling in\nthe wrong lane of travel. He ran through a number of\nred lights. He weaved through a shopping center and\ncollided with Deputy Scott's vehicle.\nDeputy Scott at that point had tried to\nblock the exit from the shopping center, but Mr. Harris\nwas successful in using his vehicle to escape. At that\npoint, he continued driving at exceptionally high\nspeeds.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Can I ask this question\nabout the shopping center. Wouldn't your case be\nexactly the same if the shopping center incident had not\noccurred?\nMR. SAVRIN: It would, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So that we really don't\nhave to get distracted by the shopping center?\nMR. SAVRIN: There is a -- yes, Your Honor.\nThere is a factual dispute as far as whether Deputy\nScott's vehicle collided with Mr. Harris' vehicle or\nvice versa, but we do not believe that that is a\nmaterial dispute. We believe that the fact, the\nundisputed fact, that Mr. Harris was driving at such\nexceptionally high rate of speeds -- and to put in\ncontext, 90 miles per hour, which is the average speed,\nand of course --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not sure why you\nconcede that. I mean, I looked at the case and it\nseemed to me it's a case involving the whole ball of\nwax. And I suspect my reaction to that tape was in part\naffected by the fact that he went through the shopping\ncenter, came out and crashed into a police car, which is\nwhat Scott saw.\nMR. SAVRIN: But Scott -- yes, Your Honor, I\nthink that is part of the analysis.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So how do I know whether,\nwhich of these things is directly or not indirectly --\nwell, you go ahead. But I mean, are you -- am I not\nsupposed to look at the part which involves the shopping\ncenter?\nMR. SAVRIN: Absolutely, Your Honor. My\npoint was that, the point was that there was a\ncollision, not who caused the collision, whether the\ndeputy pulled into Mr. Harris' line of travel or\nMr. Harris pulled towards the deputy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the rule that you\npropose that the policeman must balance the risk of harm\nto others versus the risk of harm to the fleeing person?\nMR. SAVRIN: Your Honor -- yes, essentially.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Your brief says that the\nofficer reasonably believes that doing so, i.e.,\nterminating the chase, would avoid a greater risk of\nbodily injury or death.\nMR. SAVRIN: Yes, Your Honor. And we\nbelieve --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Greater than what?\nGreater than --\nMR. SAVRIN: Greater than not taking action.\nIn other words, that the harm --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Without reference to the\npossible harm to the driver? I just want to know what\nyou're testing.\nMR. SAVRIN: I think that -- I think that is\none of the factors to be considered.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know that I agree\nwith that. I mean, if this fellow driving 90 miles an\nhour is responsible for endangering people, you're\nproposing a rule that says if there's a 50 percent\nchance that he'll hurt some innocent person and a 50\npercent chance that he'll get hurt if you try to stop\nhim, you shouldn't do anything. I don't agree with\nthat.\nMR. SAVRIN: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'd stop him. I mean, he's\nthe fellow that's causing the danger, endangerment,\nisn't he?\nMR. SAVRIN: Yes, Your Honor, I would agree\nwith that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think you're giving away\ntoo much.\nMR. SAVRIN: One thing I did want to point\nout is that a speed of 90 miles per hour -- and of\ncourse there's evidence in the record that the vehicles\nwere at times traveling over 100 miles an hour --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I didn't mean to put words\nin your mouth. It seems to me your test might be\nwhether there is a greater risk in stopping him or not\nstopping him as to other people, without reference to\nthe risk to himself.\nMR. SAVRIN: Yes, that's probably a better\narticulation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's your brief. I\nwant you to --\nMR. SAVRIN: I think that's a better\narticulation of what the appropriate test would be, the\nway --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, isn't the speed also\nrelevant to the likelihood that -- that running into a\ncar at that speed would cause the death of a driver?\nMR. SAVRIN: It would, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't it a fair high\nprobability that if you hit someone at that speed that\nthere will be something, either death or serious injury\nas a result?\nMR. SAVRIN: Your Honor, my answer to that\nquestion would be that that's always going to be the\ncase whenever force is used to stop a vehicle at this\nhigh rate of speed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I suppose there is\nalso a high probability where you're going 90 miles an\nhour on a one-way road, crossing over the double yellow\nline, with oncoming traffic, that you're going to hurt\nsomebody else.\nMR. SAVRIN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, the more you\nincrease the speed the more likely he's going to be\nhurt. But also the more likely if you let him go\nsomebody else is going to be hurt.\nMR. SAVRIN: Yes, Your Honor. And to put it\nin a more complete perspective, 90 miles an hour is\nmathematically equivalent to over 130 feet per second.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But Mr. Savrin, there was\nan episode in the parking lot where things came to a\ntemporary halt. If Scott had stopped pursuing Harris at\nthat point, maybe Harris would not -- maybe he would\nhave slowed down. If he was -- he was trying to flee\nfrom the police, but if the police weren't after him\nthere is no indication that he would have been speeding.\nMR. SAVRIN: Well, Your Honor, I would\ndisagree with that, that in fact --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, he was\nspeeding before the police knew about him, right?\nThat's the whole, where this all started.\nMR. SAVRIN: The initial offense was\nspeeding, and Mr. Harris, instead of pulling over or\nslowing down as would might be expected by a reasonable\nperson, sped up and continued to drive recklessly.\nWe would contend that it was Mr. Harris that\nwas in control of the force that the officers need to\nterminate, the risk that he presented. At any time, any\ntime, Mr. Harris could have either slowed down his\nvehicle or stopped, and he chose not to do that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, do you contend that\nan officer can always use deadly force to stop a\nhigh-speed driver who's creating this kind of a risk?\nMR. SAVRIN: I think it depends on how you\ndefine deadly force. Of course, there can be different\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Running into him with a\nhigh probability that he'll get killed.\nMR. SAVRIN: I think that, that would be the\ncase, as I indicated, whenever an officer uses force to\nstop a vehicle at this speed. I think there is -- if it\nis deadly force, and of course this Court has not\narticulated a test of that particular question --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Wasn't that acknowledged\nin the district court, in the trial court?\nMR. SAVRIN: In this case?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. SAVRIN: No, the district court found\nthat it did not need to resolve whether or not -- -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the jury might find\nthat it was deadly force.\nMR. SAVRIN: The Eleventh Circuit found that\nthe jury might conclude it was deadly force.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And do you conclude that\nthe jury could not find that it was deadly force?\nMR. SAVRIN: I believe, again, Your Honor, I\nbelieve that it depends on how broad the test is. The\nModel Penal Code test, which most of the circuit\ncourts --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but is your -- is\nit your view that a jury could not find on these facts\nthat there was deadly force?\nMR. SAVRIN: I believe, yes, under, under\nthe test as articulated in some of the circuits, yes,\nthis would not be deadly force. Of course, what we're\nsaying is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought we had a test\nfor deadly force in Garner and it's whether or not there\nis -- it's more likely than not, whether or not there is\na serious risk that death will ensue. That's the test,\nGarner.\nMR. SAVRIN: Your Honor, as I read the\nGarner opinion, the court did not need to reach a\ndefinition of deadly force because shooting someone in\nthe back of the head is clearly going to be deadly\nforce. The circuit courts -- I can tell you that the\ncircuit courts in the wake of Garner have said that\nGarner did not create a test and have created different\ntests along the lines of the Model Penal Code to reach\nthat definition. But the point -- I was going to say a\npoint that I would like to make is that there are\ndegrees even within the continuum that might be within a\ndefinition of deadly force, such as using a vehicle to\nmake contact, blowing out the tires, using stop sticks,\nusing a firearm. Those have different degrees of\npotential lethality, so even if they are all considered\ndeadly force there are decisions that an officer has to\nmake.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What test, what of deadly\nforce would not be met here?\nMR. SAVRIN: A likelihood -- -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Considering that it's a\nsummary judgment issue.\nMR. SAVRIN: Yes, Your Honor. I would say\nthat the Third Circuit decision in the Philadelphia\nlitigation case, where the officers dropped a bomb on a\nbuilding in order to gain access and they ended up\nkilling 11 people. The Court found that that was not\ndeadly force because the officers were trying to gain\naccess to the building and they reasonably believe that\nthey were able to do that without the loss of life. I\nthink that if that definition were applied to this case,\nthen I think that this would not be deadly force. But I\nthink --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Finish that.\nMR. SAVRIN: I'm sorry. I keep interrupting\nyou.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. He reasonably\n-- because Scott reasonably believed that he could bump\nthe car off the road at 90 miles an hour without risking\nthe driver's life? Is that why it's like the Third\nCircuit case?\nMR. SAVRIN: Your Honor, his intent was to\nend the pursuit, not to cause an accident.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but the Third Circuit\ncase you just described didn't talk about intent. It\ntalked about reasonable belief.\nMR. SAVRIN: Well, let me cite another case\nthen, the Adams case from the Eleventh Circuit.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Before do you that, will\nyou go back to the Philadelphia case. Do you contend\nthat a jury could find that he reasonably believed that\nhe would not cause, that he would not raise a serious\nrisk of death or serious bodily harm by bumping the car\nat 90 miles an hour?\nMR. SAVRIN: Yes, Your Honor. And if I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I don't understand that.\nHow could such a belief be reasonable? What am I\nmissing here?\nMR. SAVRIN: Let me cite the Court to the\nEleventh Circuit's own reasoning in the Adams case. And\nthat case involves a misdemeanant where the officer\nintentionally made contact with the vehicle several\ntimes. The last contact caused the death of a\npassenger. The Eleventh Circuit found that Garner did\nnot apply to that situation and further said that a\npoliceman's use of his vehicle is very different from a\npoliceman's use of his gun.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That doesn't answer my\nquestion.\nMR. SAVRIN: I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why, why would it be\nreasonable to believe that a car could be bumped at 90\nmiles an hour plus without raising a substantial risk of\ndeath or serious bodily harm? How could such a belief\nbe reasonable?\nMR. SAVRIN: Because there are vehicle\ncollisions every day, Your Honor, that do not end in\ndeath or serious bodily harm.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Some people are lucky.\nWe're talking about creating a substantial risk. How\nwould it be reasonable to assume that one would not\ncreate a substantial risk?\nMR. SAVRIN: Your Honor, because Mr. Harris\ncould have regained control of his vehicle. The point\nis that Mister -- that the Petitioner had limited\noptions based on the manner in which Mr. Harris was\ndriving. Even if this would be considered deadly force,\nwe do believe it would be justified under the\ncircumstances.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's a different\nissue and you may prevail on other arguments in the\ncase. But as to whether or not there's a likelihood or\na reasonable likelihood of serious injury, it seems to\nme that's clearly a question for the jury. I mean, we\nmight argue about it up here, but that's classic jury\nquestion, isn't it?\nMR. SAVRIN: I believe in the context of the\nFourth Amendment and the Graham factors and the question\nof probable cause, that it's not the same as simply a\njury question. But I do concede that if it's not deadly\nforce it's very close to it. But I think the important\nthing is that, whatever force Mister -- the Petitioner\nused was limited by Mr. Harris' driving.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Savrin, one technique\nthat Officer Scott asked permission to use was described\nas a PIT technique that would be a life and limb-\nsparing measure. One oddity about this case is that he\ncalled and asked permission to use that less risky\nmethod and yet when he determined that he couldn't do\nthat, given the speed of the vehicles, he didn't ask\npermission to do what he did do, which was\nlife-endangering.\nMR. SAVRIN: Your Honor, if I could respond\nto that in two respects. First, it is not, it is not\nthe case that the PIT maneuver, as it's commonly called,\nis safe. What it does is spin the car out, and if\nMr. Harris' vehicle had been spun out in this case it is\nmore likelihood that he would have lost control. In\nother words, it causes the vehicle to lose control.\nThe second response I would have is that the\nPetitioner did ask permission to do the PIT maneuver and\nthe permission that the supervisor gave, which was Mr.\nFaninger that's in the record undisputed, was to use\nforce up to deadly force. So Mr. --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where is that?\nMR. SAVRIN: That's in Mark Faninger's\ndeposition, and he is the supervisor that was ---\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And he said he gave\npermission for more than PIT procedure?\nMR. SAVRIN: Yes, Your Honor. His testimony\nwas that he was giving, he believes he was giving\npermission up to and including deadly force.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the phrase used was\n\"take him out,\" wasn't it?\nMR. SAVRIN: Yes. Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Does a police officer have\nany obligation in a situation like this to consider\nother alternatives, and if so what other alternatives\nmight have been available to this officer?\nMR. SAVRIN: Yes, Justice Stevens. I think\nthe officer had very limited options, two options at\nthat point: Either use force or let Mr. Harris go. And\nI think it was a balancing of --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And even with letting him\ngo, isn't it possible they could get other roadblocks up\nahead or get other people involved in the attempt to\ncatch him?\nMR. SAVRIN: Yes, there always are other\npotentials. However, I would submit that a vehicle\ntraveling at 130 feet per second can do a lot of damage\nin a very short period of time before the police\nofficers can figure out what route he's going to take.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't it true that there's\nno traffic on the road at that particular time?\nMR. SAVRIN: Deputy Scott took the action\nthat he did because there was a low likelihood of injury\nto third parties other than to Mr. Harris because there\nwas no one in his immediate path of travel.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, in that circumstance\nwhy wouldn't he just consider discontinuing the chase?\nMR. SAVRIN: Because there were -- the\nvideotape shows that Mr. Harris passed approximately 36\ncars during this period of time. 12 seconds before the\ncontact was made, a vehicle was passed by Mr. Harris.\nThere was a high likelihood, in fact a probability, that\nthis case was going to end in tragedy, and Deputy Scott\ntook the action that he could.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would that have been\nlikely if the officer had discontinued the chase?\nMR. SAVRIN: Whether he discontinued the\nchase or not, Mr. Harris could still injure whoever\nmight be around the next corner, Your Honor.\nIf there are no further questions, I'd like\nto save my time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Savrin.\nMr. Garre?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE.\nFOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE\nSUPPORTING PETITIONER\nMR. GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nWhen a suspect disobeys a lawful command to\nstop, races off in a reckless attempt to elude the\npolice, and demonstrates a disregard for his own life\nand the lives of others in his path, the police may use\nforce, including deadly force, to bring the suspect's\nvehicle flight to a halt and protect the public safety.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it matter\nexactly what the nature of the escape was? Are we\nsupposed to evaluate whether this was reckless enough?\nWell, let's say the driver did not go off 90 miles an\nhour. Let's say he obeyed the speed limit. He just\nwasn't going to stop. Does that make it a different\ncase?\nMR. GARRE: It does, Your Honor. The key\ndetermination is whether the officer on the scene\nreasonably determines that the vehicle poses a\nsubstantial risk to other motorists or the police in his\nway.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I would think that would\napply to all high-speed cases; would you not agree?\nMR. GARRE: I agree that it does, Justice\nKennedy. Here what you have is an individual who's\ngoing extraordinarily high speeds, 80 to 100 miles an\nhour. An individual who has passed cars, crossed the\ndouble, double line; there were numerous motors, motor\nvehicles on the night. And an individual who has ran\nred lights, an individual who when three police cars --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. But that was while\nhe was being chased, right? Before being chased he\nhadn't done any of this. He was going 72 miles an hour\nin a 55-mile zone, isn't that right.\nMR. GARRE: Well, that's true, Your Honor.\nBut as the Court said in the Sacramento versus Lewis\ncase, we don't blame police for the individual's\nreckless flight in that context. We don't blame police\nthat Respondent made a decision to just --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No but if you're thinking\nof the likelihood of harm if they discontinued the\nchase, is it not reasonable to assume he might go back\nto going 72 miles an hour in a 55-mile zone?\nMR. GARRE: Not on this record, Justice\nStevens. In this particular --\nJUSTICE SC ALIA: It would might also be\nreasonable to assume that anyone who was chased by the\npolice will immediately speed up to 90 miles an hour.\nMR. GARRE: That's exactly right, Justice Sc\nalia.\nJUSTICE SC ALIA: It doesn't seem to me a\nvery good rule to give to police forces: Anybody who's\ngoing 72 miles an hour, let him go. Or at least if he\nhits 90, let him go.\nMR. GARRE: We agree, Justice Scalia. As\nJustice Kennedy put it Sacramento versus Lewis, if\nthere's a real danger --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: There isn't a question.\nThere is a question of whether it justifies the use of\ndeadly force, to prevent this -- this situation.\nMR. GARRE: The question in our mind,\nJustice Stevens, is whether Deputy Scott reasonably\nbelieved that Respondent posed a serious risk of injury\nor death to other motor vehicles, bystanders or police\non the roadway that night.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why are these absolute? I\nmean I looked at Garner and then I looked at Graham and\nGraham which came later said that all claims that\nofficers have used excessive force, deadly or not,\nshould be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment and its\nreasonableness standard. So I guess-- isn't that right,\nisn't that the law?\nMR. GARRE: We agree, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right, if that's the\nlaw, then whether -- of course an automobile could,\ncould kill people. Of course it can. So can a lot of\nthings. But an automobile isn't a gun, and a chase on\nthe highway is not a chase through a back yard, though\nboth could end up with the person being chased dead.\nSo aren't we supposed to look at all the\ncircumstances, including the circumstance of what -- one\nthat interests me, one, is that the right standard?\nTwo, did Scott know that the reason he was chasing this\nperson was because he had violated a speed limit, or was\nhe ignorant of the reason why the individual was racing\naway at 90 miles an hour, which is as far as the record\ncould show?\nMR. GARRE: Justice Breyer, to answer the\nsecond question first, Scott did not know that he was\ninitially in a chase.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And a reasonable juror\ncould not conclude to the contrary?\nMR. GARRE: Well, Scott, I believe, Scott's\ntestimony was that he did not know. What Scott knew,\nand he was engaged in the chase, was this is an\nindividual who had crossed cars, crossed the double\nyellow line. This was an individual who had ran red\nlights. This was an individual, when three police squad\ncars converged on him in the shopping center parking\nlot, collided with them and ran off into the highway,\nreaching again speeds up to 90 miles an hour.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it reasonable for\nhim to suppose that there might be something more going\non if the guy is trying this hard to get away from a\nspeeding ticket? That presents he presents a danger to\nthe community quite apart from the driving?\nMR. GARRE: Absolutely.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that a factor\nthat goes into the analysis?\nMR. GARRE: It is, certainly, at a\ncommonsense level. Statistic show that most vehicles\nwho flee in this fashion, oftentimes there is alcohol or\ndrug abuse involved, oftentimes they are stolen\nvehicles. We don't think --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What if they knew there\nwere drugs in the car that he would dispose of if he had\ngot caught. Would that justify this using deadly force?\nMR. GARRE: I'm not sure that it would,\nJustice Scalia -- uh, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm rather clear it would\nnot, isn't it? Because that would be no more serious\nthan the crime in Garner, would it?\nMR. GARRE: Well -- that's true. The key,\nthe key point about this case is the threat that\nRespondent posed in the -- suspects who engage in high\nspeed vehicle chases pose to the public, and that is,\nthat is fundamentally different from Garner for the\nreason that you mentioned. Garner involved --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But your position would be\nthe same even if Scott knew that the only reason they\nwere trying to stop him initially was the speeding\nviolation?\nMR. GARRE: Yes. It doesn't matter why the\nchase began. The point is that when Scott made the\ndecision to use force against Respondent, he reasonably\ndetermined that Respondent posed a grave threat to other\nmotorists, the police and any bystanders who might come\nin his way.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why, why wouldn't it\nmatter? I mean, other things being equal, suppose that\nhe known that all that happens, suppose he was two miles\nbeyond the speed limit. And Scott knew the whole thing\nor Scott was the one who did it, and he says maybe he is\na young kid who is frightened and he has his license\nnumber and he could get him later. I mean, why wouldn't\nit be nutty to -- to try to bump somebody off the road,\nwhen all, that's all that's at stake?\nMR. GARRE: Because, Your Honor, regardless\nof the reason the chase began, at the moment that Deputy\nScott used the force, this car posed a serious risk to\neveryone else on the road that night. Someone traveling\n90 miles an hour, up to 90 miles an hour, on a two-lane\nwindy road with numerous cars passing during this course\nof the chase, it was that threat that Deputy Scott acted\nagainst when he used that force, and that was a\nreasonable use of force. It's reasonable regardless of\nwhether or not this Court determines --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you deal with the\nBrower case? That it was a 193 -- 83 action against the\npolice for setting up a roadblock to catch a speeder.\nAnd the Court said that the roadblock was enough to give\nrise to a 1983 claim?\nMR. GARRE: Justice Ginsburg, the holding in\nthat case was that a roadblock amounted to a seizure.\nAnd we don't, no one disputes there was a seizure in\nthis case when Deputy Scott intentionally used force to\nput Respondents off the road. So it respect, Brower\ndoesn't speak to the question in this case, which is\nwhether or not that use of force was reasonable under\nthe circumstances.\nJustice Kennedy in the Sacramento versus\nLewis case, in his concurring opinion, say that there\nwas a real danger of adopting a constitutional rule that\nsuspects are free to disobey lawful commands.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I just make this one\npoint? Is it correct that the issue is whether it's\nreasonable or is the issue whether a jury could find it\nunreasonable?\nMR. GARRE: Well, the -- ultimately to\ndetermine whether this decision could be made at the\nsummary judgment stage you would have to consider\nwhether a jury could find it unreasonable. Here, on the\nrelevant undisputed facts, we submit as a matter of law,\nDeputy Scott reasonably believed that this force was\nnecessary under the circumstances.\nAnd the final point that I wanted to make,\ngoing back to Justice Kennedy's concurrence, is that\nthere is a real danger in adopting that kind of\nconstitutional rule, that it will encourage more\nsuspects to flee, and will only increase the danger to\nthe public and to police and to motorists in these high\nspeed chases. I would urge this Court to reverse the\ndecision below. If there are no further questions --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Garre.\nMr. Jones.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG T. JONES,\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMR. JONES: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court.\nI'd like to begin by responding to some of\nthe questions that were asked of Petitioner. First of\nall, Officer Scott himself admitted in his testimony\nthat he knew at the time that he was using deadly force,\nand he realized at the time that he was likely to cause\ninjury or -- death or serious injury to Mr. Harris.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there any doubt\nthat Mr. Harris was likely to cause death or serious\ninjury to the other cars on the highway that he was\npassing?\nMR. JONES: Mr. Harris was simply a -- an\nunsafe driver. There is always a risk at driving in\nexcess of speed limit, driving in violation of traffic\nlaws. But that risk in and of itself is not --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We are not talking\nabout driving in violation of traffic laws. We talking\nabout 90 miles an hour on a two-lane highway, swerving\npast cars in the incoming traffic --\nMR. JONES: Well, we're talking --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Hitting -- after\nhitting Officer Scott's car and continuing on. That's a\nlittle more than just unsafe.\nMR. JONES: Well, those are not the facts\nbefore the Court, Mr. Chief Justice. The facts are that\nhe was driving fast but he was under control. He only\ncrossed the center line to pass and when he passed, he\nused his turn signal when he passed.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: He used the turning\nsignal. That's like the strangler who observes the no\nsmoking sign.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. JONES: When he turned into the -- when\nhe turned into the shopping center he wasn't weaving\nthrough a parking lot. He was going through a private\naccess road in a shopping mall which was closed at 11\no'clock at night. And the collision, the impact\noccurred when Officer Scott, who was going too fast to\nmake the turn into the shopping center, went up to the\nnext intersection, came around the other way to head my\nclient off at the pass. And then what happened was that\nMr. Harris took evasive action to a avoid collision when\nMr. Harris -- excuse me when Officer Scott -- put\nhimself right in Mr. Harris' way.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Jones, I looked at the\nvideotape on this. It seemed to me that he created a\ntremendous risk of drivers on that road. Is that an\nunreasonable way of looking at the -- at this tape?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He created the scariest\nchase I ever saw since \"The French Connection.\"\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is frightening.\nMR. JONES: As a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A frightening amount of\nspeed, and cars coming in the opposite direction, at\nnight, on a two-lane windy road --\nMR. JONES: Well, as the Court below found,\nand as the tape indicates, Mr. Harris didn't run anybody\noff the road. He didn't ram anybody. He didn't try to\nram anybody. He was just driving away.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The question was whether he\nwas creating a substantial risk doing that.\nMR. JONES: He was creating --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And my, my question is how\ncould a jury find otherwise? Your answer up to this\npoint is that well, he used signal lights and his\nreflexes were good, and they sure were. But the\nquestion is whether he was creating a substantial risk\nof death or serious bodily harm to others. And my\nquestion is leaving -- assuming that his reflexes were\ngood and he knew how to use the signal lights, how could\nthe jury fail to find that he was creating such a risk?\nMR. JONES: Well, the jury could certainly\nfind he's creating a risk. But with regard to the other\nGarner factors that must be shown before deadly force\ncan be used, he had not committed a violent felony, a\ncrime involving the infliction or threat of infliction\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Garner was not talking\nabout someone who at the time the deadly force was used\nwas himself creating a substantial risk of death or\nserious bodily harm to others. That's what we are\ndealing with here. And the reasonableness of the\nofficer's action depends on whether, at the summary\njudgment stage, a jury can reasonably find that, in\nfact, he was not creating at that moment, a substantial\nrisk of serious bodily harm or death to others. And my\nquestion is, how could a jury find anything else?\nMR. JONES: Well, a jury could find that the\npursuit by the officer escalated the risk rather than\ndiminishing the risk to others. And that given a choice\nbetween using deadly force to terminate a pursuit where\nthe officer himself had escalated the risk versus\nbacking off, letting the offender escape and then\nperhaps arresting him an hour later at the house.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Did Scott, know that? Did\nScott -- Do you have evidence to show that Scott knew\nthat the underlying offense was a speeding violation?\nMR. JONES: We have evidence that it was\ncalled out on the radio. \"I'm pursuing somebody.\"\nWhether Scott knew we don't know.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And Scott has testified he\ndidn't know it.\nMR. JONES: Scott has testified he --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, do you think you can\nget to the jury on the question of whether he knew it.\nMR. JONES: Scott --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'd like a yes or no\nanswer.\nMR. JONES: The testimony --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That doesn't sound like yes\nor no.\nMR. JONES: I'm not certain I understand the\nquestion.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The question is, can you\nget to the jury on the question of whether Scott knew\nthat the underlying offense was for speeding?\nMR. JONES: Scott did not know that was it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. If Scott didn't\nknow it, I mean, my goodness, then I don't see the\nrelevance of whether it was speeding or not. And I was\nwith you when I read the -- the opinion of the court\nbelow. And I read the other brief. I was on the other\nside. Then I've been shifting back and forth. Then I\nlook at that tape, and I have to say that when I looked\nat the tape, my reaction was somewhat similar to Justice\nAlito's. And so if it's doubtful and then you can't\neven show that the person who did it knew that this was\nfor speeding rather than for murder, how can you get to\nthe jury?\nMR. JONES: Well, there is certainly a\ncredibility issue as to whether Scott says he knew or\ndidn't know. I mean, certainly the call on the radio he\ncould have acquired. The thing is that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, as the Chief Justice\nindicated through a question earlier, isn't it\nreasonable for an officer to assume that it is -- he is\ntrying to escape because there is something more serious\nthan speeding at stake? I mean, that's the assumption I\nwould draw.\nMR. JONES: That assumption would not be\nbased upon probability or based upon police training.\nOfficers in pursuit situations are trying to believe --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You mean just as many\npeople take off in high speed chases for speeding as for\nserious crimes?\nMR. JONES: The vast majority have committed\nminor crimes. And it's not a rational --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But at the moment Scott\ncame into this case, what difference does that make?\nWhy is that even relevant? Let's assume Scott knew that\nthis entire situation had eventuated out of an 18 mile\nin excess of speed act by the individual. Assume that.\nWhat Scott also knew at the point at which\nhe joined the chase was that this individual was driving\na car at 90 miles an hour. He was crossing yellow\nlines, going through red lights, et cetera. At that\npoint, wasn't the only legally relevant data whether or\nnot Harris was creating the risk of death or bodily harm\nto others?\nMR. JONES: That's the issue. Was there an\nimmediate risk of death or serious bodily harm --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So you agree that whether\nScott knew or didn't know, that this whole scenario had\neventuated out of a speeding situation was irrelevant?\nMR. JONES: It's not relevant. It's\nrelevant to that termination. Yeah, the issue is, is\nthere an immediate risk. But one of the factors that is\nsignificant is what is the severity of the underlying\ncrime. And if it is a crime of violence, then certainly\nthe officer is entitled to presume --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's exactly where I\nstarted. And I wondered -- that's what I'm uncertain\nabout the standard for this. Because as you and the\nothers have been arguing, if the question is one about\nrules surrounding the use of deadly force. But then\nwhen I read what I read out to you, in Graham, it seemed\nto me that Graham, which comes after Garner, says that's\nnot the standard. Graham is a standard of simple\nreasonableness and Garner is simply an illustration of\nthat as applied to guns and a backyard chase, not as\napplied to cars which threaten other people much more.\nMR. JONES: Well, that's a good question.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what is the standard?\nAm I supposed to apply -- am I not supposed to apply\nGraham?\nMR. JONES: Well, whether you apply Garner\nor Graham, the result is the same in this case. And let\nme explain why. What Graham did is it expanded the\nGarner rule, which you can't use deadly force to stop a\nfleeing suspect who is merely fleeing, expanded that to\ninclude the entire range of use of force, deadly or\nnondeadly.\nAnd with regard to the factors that are to\nbe considered in determining whether the use of force is\nreasonable under Graham, the balance with respect to a\nfleeing suspect who is subjected to deadly force was\nalready drawn by Garner. Garner created a bright light\nrule. Graham extended that to an ad hoc balancing test\nwith all use of force applications. But with respect to\ndeadly force and a fleeing suspect, Garner still\nprovides a bright line rule.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So you're saying I cannot\ndo the following under the law, which would seem to be\ncontrary to common sense, to say there is a big\ndifference between a policeman shooting a person who is\nrunning away and threatens no harm to others, and a\npoliceman using a gun -- using a car on a highway to try\nto get a person to stop who is threatening others. I\nhave to treat those exactly as if they were the same\nthing.\nMR. JONES: Yes. And Garner, this Court's\ndecision in Garner and this Court's decision in Brower,\nwhich was written by Justice Scalia, basically to quote\nBrower in both cases. In the Brower versus County of\nInyo --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The Eleventh Circuit\ngave the exact opposite answer in the Adams case, which\nif you're looking at what the -- was clearly established\nlaw from the point of view of the officer that provides\nhim guidance that the Garner case does not dictate a\nresult in the use of deadly force in the police chase\ncase involving an automobile.\nMR. JONES: Well, the holding of the Adams\nversus St. Lucie County case was that in 1985, an\nincident which occurred six weeks after the Garner\ndecision and four years before the Brower decision,\nthere is no way the officers could have known at that\ntime that their act of ramming a police car to prevent\nan escape of another fleeing vehicle would have been\nconsidered deadly force in violation of the Fourth\nAmendment. As the dissent pointed out in the, in the\nAdams case, though, certainly as of the Court's decision\nin 1993, this was now clearly established. You had\nBrower saying that it's a seizure, and then you had this\nCourt saying that now the law was clearly established\nwhere it wasn't before --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So when Officer\nScott was trying to figure out what the law was, he\nshould have relied on the dissent in the case?\nMR. JONES: Well, another case came about\nlater which held that as early as 1998 in another case\ninvolving the same department, that there was clearly\nestablished law.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there any case at the\ntime of the action in this case, any decision that said\nramming, ramming a car to end a chase violates the\nFourth Amendment?\nMR. JONES: Brower versus County of Inyo\nsays --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Brower was a roadblock\ncase.\nMR. JONES: It was a roadblock which\nproduced a collision, a physical impact between\nvehicles. And that was the -- that was the distinction\nwhich Justice Scalia latched onto in that case, and said\nthat the mere fact that the person was fleeing by car in\nBrower was no different than the burglar fleeing by foot\nin Garner. Either one of them --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the issue in the case\nwas quite simply whether there had been a seizure.\nIsn't that the issue?\nMR. JONES: That was the first holding. The\nsecond holding was that the Plaintiff had sufficiently\nclaimed a cause of action on the seizure. And then it\nwent back to the lower court to be considered under the\nGarner analysis. And what I liked about your decision\n-- excuse me, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead. Finish\nyour --\nMR. JONES: What I liked about your decision\nin that case, Justice Scalia, was that you said that the\nofficer's culpability for using excessive force is not\ndiminished by the fact that perpetrator chose to\ncontinue running, whether it was the fleeing burglar in\nGarner or the fleeing driver in Brower. Excuse me,\nMr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If I could just get\nback to an earlier point. You think what the officer\nshould have done in this case was to let Mr. Harris go.\nMR. JONES: That was one option. He could\nhave continued the pursuit and simply decided not to mow\nhim off the road at 90 miles an hour, or he could have\nstopped a pursuit and let him go which often happens in\nmany pursuits.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though he\ndoesn't know at that point that he will ever be able to\narrest him later. He doesn't know if it's a stolen car\nor not.\nMR. JONES: That's correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And he doesn't know\nwhy he is being pursued, whether it's for mass murder or\nterrorism or anything else.\nMR. JONES: Well, that's correct. But in\nthe majority of cases -- and this is the only testimony\nin this record, Your Honors. Our experts testified on a\nstudy -- based on a study which was commissioned for him\nby the Department of Justice, a study which has been\ncited by some of the amicus briefs on both sides in this\ncase, Dr. Albert testified that 70 percent of the time,\nwhen police back off pursuit, the perpetrator stops\nrunning and they resume safe driving. And when the car\nis stolen, most of the time --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Once they have\ngotten away, I assume.\nMR. JONES: Well, sometimes you have to let\nthem get away. In Garner, it says, even if the guy has\njust broken into somebody's house in the middle of the\nnight and committed a felony, if the choice is letting\nthem go or using deadly force when the factors\nauthorizing deadly force are not present, you have to\nlet him go.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not if he is shooting his\nway out of the house and endangering other people.\nMR. JONES: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, that's a factor\nhere, of course. If he has taken the jewelry and he's\ngone off into the night, if shooting at him might\nendanger somebody else, or even kill him, you have to\nlet him go. I'm talking about a burglar who is, you\nknow, who is shooting as he leaves.\nMR. JONES: You can shoot him. I'd be there\nshooting him, too.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course you can shoot\nhim.\nMR. JONES: Let me take that distinction and\napply it to the vehicle, Justice Scalia. What we have\nto have to authorize deadly force in this context is\nsomething more than just unsafe flight. You've got to\nhave someone who is behaving violently, who is menacing\npeople, trying to ram people.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me as of the\ntime he exited the parking lot, by that point, had he\ncommitted any felonies?\nMR. JONES: No. All he had done was taken\nevasive action to avoid an officer who --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: 90 miles an hour would not\nbe a felony, not a reckless driving?\nMR. JONES: Are you talking about the\ntraffic pursuit?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.\nMR. JONES: No, none of those are felonies\nunder Georgia law.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: At no point did he commit\na felony?\nMR. JONES: No, Your Honor. It's not even a\nfelony in Georgia.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But he certainly\ncommitted a lot of --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If he had intended to hit\nthe police officer, was it --\nMR. JONES: If he had intended to hit the\npolice officer, if that was shown by the evidence, so\nthey could have charged with aggravated assault. They\ndidn't do that. They left traffic citations in his\nhospital room. They never arrested him. They never\nprosecuted him.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The key point is that he\nis endangering the lives and safety of others. Anyone\nwho has watched that tape has got to come to that\nconclusion, looking at the road and the way that this\ncar was swerving, and the cars coming in the opposite\ndirection. This was a situation fraught with danger.\nMR. JONES: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I hope I\ndon't have you on my jury if that's -- but what the\ntrial court found was that construing the facts in a\nlight most favorable to the Plaintiff as a nonmoving\nparty, that reasonable jurors can find that this was\nsimply a person who was driving fast. This was not a\nperson who was driving assaultively. He wasn't driving\nviolently. He wasn't a threat to anyone that would\nauthorize the use of deadly force against him.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that a factual finding\nof the, of the trial court here?\nMR. JONES: That is a factual finding.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are we bound by that fact?\nMR. JONES: We are bound by that. This is\nan interlocutory appeal, this an interlocutory appeal\nunder Mitchell v. Forsythe, and the Court is bound by\nits own ruling to accept the facts as found by the court\nbelow, and decide the narrow issue of law here which is,\none, is there a constitutional violation on these facts.\nAnd two, was the law clearly established.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even if having watched the\ntape, there is no way that, that factual finding can be\naccurate?\nMR. JONES: If you want to repeal Johnson v.\nJones and Mitchell v. Forsythe, then yes. This is the\nSupreme Court. You can make that determination.\nBut based upon the prior rulings of this\nCourt, this Court is bound to accept the findings of\nfact of the courts below, and then to determine solely\nthe legal issue on an interlocutory basis. The bottom\nline issue here, Your Honors, is whether the fact that\nsomeone is driving in violation of traffic laws in and\nof itself can be justification for the use of deadly\nforce.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't see how -- I mean,\nyou know, given our prior discussion here, I don't see\nhow that's the issue. Because you say we have to assume\nthat the Defendant here didn't know that, in fact, all\nthat was at issue was a violation of the traffic law.\nMR. JONES: Well, I'm not talking about the\nunderlying violation here. I'm talking about the\nconduct observed by the officer who made the decision to\nuse deadly force.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That conduct -- it could be\nconduct -- you could say exactly your same question,\njust as the Chief just said. I mean, I don't know how\nto get around this. You could say the question was,\ndoes a person who reasonably thinks he might be being\npursued for a murder --\nMR. JONES: This is the issue. This is the\nissue. If what this person is doing is driving, say\ndriving unsafely, but they are not driving violently,\nthey are not driving aggressively, they are not menacing\nanyone on the road. They are simply driving fast trying\nto get away, that in and of itself, is that going to be\njustification for the use of deadly force or is\nsomething more going to be required?\nJUSTICE ALITO: When someone is fleeing and\ncreating a grave danger, let's just assume that that's\nthe case, creating a very danger for other drivers on\nthe road, when in your view is it reasonable for the\npolice to use deadly force to stop that, as opposed to\nbreaking off the chase? What, what is the test.\nMR. JONES: Well, under Garner the test is\nthey have to be threatening violence or inflicting\nviolence against someone. There have to be no other\nalternatives other than deadly force available to effect\nthe apprehension. And assuming there is justification\nfor deadly force, then there is a duty to give a warning\nwhere feasible before using deadly force. And the court\nbelow felt none of those three factors --\nJUSTICE ALITO: How could you possibly give\na warning in this situation?\nMR. JONES: It's academic in this case,\nbecause the first two factors were not met. I mean,\nit's our position that you don't worry about giving a\nwarning unless you have the right to use deadly force,\nand if you don't get to that point then it's -- it's a\nmoot question.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why wasn't there warning?\nThere were lights, there were sirens. Surely the\ndefendant knew that the police were trying to stop him.\nMR. JONES: There was certainly warning that\nhe needed -- that he was expected to pull over. There\nwas no warning of any intent to use deadly force.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What am I -- you said\nfactually. What am I supposed to assume? You said in\nlight of -- I mean, I looked at the tape and that tape\nshows he is weaving on both sides of the lane, swerving\naround automobiles that are coming in the opposite\ndirection with their lights on, goes through a red light\nwhere there are several cars that are right there,\nweaves around them, and there are cars coming the other\nway, weaves back, goes down the road.\nNow, what in fact -- am I supposed to\npretend I haven't seen that? What am I supposed to\npretend to here?\nMR. JONES: Well, I didn't see that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You didn't see that?\nMR. JONES: I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You didn't -- I thought\nthat -- you didn't see that?\nMR. JONES: Well, the point is most people\nuse the word weaving to describe the motion of\nMr. Harris's car is when they are going through the, the\nshopping center --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I -- what I saw is\nhe is driving down one lane, what I mean by weaving, and\nthis lane goes with me in traffic. And there is some\ncars in front of him, so he goes in the other lane where\nthe cars are now coming right directly at him. And then\nbefore they hit him, he goes back to the first lane and\nhe does this while going through a red light, it seemed\nto me.\nAm I -- did I mis-see that? I'll go look at\nit again if you --\nMR. JONES: The -- feel free to look at it\nagain.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah.\nMR. JONES: But those are not the facts that\nwere found by the court below in this --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well that's, that's what I\nwonder. If the court says that isn't what happened, and\nI see with my eyes that is what happened, what am I\nsupposed to do?\nMR. JONES: Well, I think you apply the law,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The district --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Under, under -- under your\nrule, what you're concerned with is the bumping, the use\nof the force. Under your rule, if the police continue\nthe chase without using the, without trying to ram him,\nand then there is an accident and innocent people are\nkilled, or injured, I assume that under the tort laws of\nmost states, the police could be liable.\nMR. JONES: Well in theory perhaps they\ncould be if the officer was a joint proximate cause of\nthe accident, but in most states --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, aren't they the\nproximate cause if they continue the chase without\ntrying to terminate it?\nMR. JONES: That's correct. If the officer\nterminates the chase then he is never going to be liable\nbecause number one he is acting prudently; he is going\nbased upon Department of Justice studies showing 70\npercent --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No. No. Well, I meant\nterminate the chase by -- by -- by forcing him off the\nroad.\nMR. JONES: Well, if he terminates the chase\nusing deadly force, that that creates a whole host of\nother problems.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But isn't there -- but\nisn't that one way to assure that the police are not\nliable, both from a moral standpoint and a legal\nstandpoint, for causing the injury of other people?\nMR. JONES: Now from a constitutional\nstandpoint the Fourth Amendment doesn't protect other\npeople. It protects those who have been seized. And\nthat's, that's the framework we are dealing with here\ntoday.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you mean it's\nirrelevant to our analysis to consider that he might\ninjure other people?\nMR. JONES: The potential for danger to\nothers is certainly part of the justification for deadly\nforce, just as, if deadly force cannot be used\nendangering other people, then that certainly goes into\nthe matrix, too.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Jones, could I --\nMR. JONES: Yeah.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could I ask whether the\nportion of the opinion that you say establishes that he\nwas not endangering anybody is this portion? The court\nis mindful that traffic laws are designed to -- safely\n-- and Harris acted in an unsafe manner. However, the\nrecord reflects\" -- - is this the portion?\nMR. JONES: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- \"that he maintained\ncontrol over his vehicle.\" Well, that doesn't prove\nhe's not endangering anybody. \"Used his turn signals\"\n-- wonderful.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: \"And did not endanger any\nparticular motorist on the road.\" I think that's true.\nIn that scary chase he, he didn't come close to hitting\nany particular car, but I don't think that's, that's a\nfinding that he was not endangering anybody. \"Any\nparticular motorist,\" but he was endangering the public\nat large.\nMR. JONES: Well, this is my point is that\nif, if the drive --if the hazard caused by driving in\nand of itself is the only threat here, does that rise to\na level of imminency and immediacy that justifies the\nuse of deadly force? If it does, then any officer who\nperceives that someone is driving unsafely and that they\nmay cause an accident to someone who may or may not be\ndown the road if not stopped, would be justified in\nusing deadly force, to literally take out anyone who is\nspeeding.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It depends on how fast --\nif depends on how fast the car is going, whether it's a\ntwo-lane road or four-lane divided highway. All those\nfactors come into, into account. And it doesn't seem to\nme that we have to adopt a rule that will, that will\ndiscourage police officers. There's, there's enough\ndisincentive to engage in this kind of activity in the\nfact that the police officer may hurt himself. It's\npretty risky to conduct this kind of a maneuver, don't\nyou think? I wouldn't have done it if I was Scott.\nMR. JONES: Well that's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I would have let the guy\ngo.\nMR. JONES: Now what he, if he --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Driving 90 miles an hour\nand comes up, approaches that car, that car swerved.\nScott could have been killed, couldn't he?\nMR. JONES: Absolutely. Or because he's\nalso --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So I don't think we need a\nwhole lot of disincentive to stop police officers in\nengaging in frolicsome conduct.\nMR. JONES: Well, not only that, Justice\nScalia. The officer had no control over what was going\nto happen once he used deadly force, like the officer\nwho fired into the cab of a flying vehicle in Barn v\nCox, once you disable the driver the car keeps going.\nAnd in this case, when you -- when you hit the vehicle\nand knock a vehicle that has been in control and make it\nout of control, then it's now an unguided missile that\ncould just as easily cross the center line and hit an\ninnocent person.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just ask this\nquestion. In trying to assess the likelihood of harm to\ninnocent people who would be hurt by this by this guy\ndriving so fast, is that, do we measure it by assuming\nthat the chase will continue? Or do we measure it by\nassuming that the chase would be discontinued?\nMR. JONES: The officer --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Just as we did in Garner?\nMR. JONES: The officer has both options. I\nmean Garner simply commands that he not use deadly force\nif it's a choice between letting him go and using deadly\nforce. Now in the Sacramento v Lewis case, it does say\nthat involves a different, a different type of claim and\na different standard. But in the Sacramento case it\ndoes say that an officer in a pursuit has a duty to\nalways be weighing the risk of the continued pursuit\nagainst the risk to the public. So there is an\nindependent duty there to act reasonably.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If it were -- clear that a\njury could find that there would be no unreasonable risk\nto innocent motorists if they discontinued the chase --\nassume that's a possible finding. If that were true,\nwould there be a duty to discontinue the chase?\nMR. JONES: Not under the Fourth Amendment.\nNow, the -- the only expert testimony in this record on\nthat subject says there is a 7 percent chance --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You're saying there is a\nduty not to use deadly force.\nMR. JONES: That's what Garner says, if you\ndon't use deadly force. And that's what our claim is.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And aren't you\nconcerned that that creates an incentive in every case\nfor anyone who, that sees the blue lights behind them to\nknow that all they have to do is keep fleeing and the\npolice are going to have to give up eventually?\nMR. JONES: Well, let me respond by reading\na portion of Garner that deals with that point,\nMr. Chief Justice. These, these same important policy\nreasons were raised in Garner, that we don't want to\nencourage disobedience of issues. We want to discourage\npeople from fleeing. And this is what the Garner Court\nsaid --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Garner --\nGarner was the case involving shooting the guy in the\nback, right?\nMR. JONES: Yes. He might easily break into\nsomeone else's house and perhaps end up killing them.\nThis was a vigorous dissent in Garner. But this is what\nthe majority said: \"Without in any way disparaging the\nimportance of these goals we are not convinced that the\nuse of deadly force is a sufficiently productive means\nof accomplishing them to justify the killing of\nnonviolent suspects.\"\nAnd if unsafe driving --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But your, your answer to\nJustice Stevens as I understand it was the police not\nhave the duty to discontinue the chase? The obverse of\nthat is that the police may prolong the chase, i.e.,\nprolong the injury to the public. I'm surprised at your\nanswer.\nMR. JONES: Well, I think there is an\nindependent duty, it doesn't rise under the Fourth\nAmendment, but there is an independent duty to do that.\nBut my concern is that under Garner, given a choice\nbetween --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It is certainly the case\nthat if there is going to be a, a risk of deadly harm to\ninnocent third parties, there would be a duty to\ndiscontinue the chase rather kill him. But you don't\nseem to buy that.\nMR. JONES: Well, experience shows most of\nthe time when you discontinue a chase, the person who is\nrunning discontinues driving unsafely. That is the --\nthat is experience. This officer's own policy says that\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did this study show what\nfuture fleeing speeders would do?\nI mean, I will accept that for, for the sake\nof argument that -- in fact, it's probably true. I\nwould have guessed that, if the police stopped chasing,\nyou don't go 90 miles an hour anymore. But did this\nstudy show what the effect of a rule that says stop\nchasing when he hits 85, what the effect of that rule\nwould be on, on fleeing speeders or fleeing felons, or\nfleeing anybody?\nMR. JONES: Well, the rule simply says you\ndon't kill him just because he is driving unsafely. And\nif, it simply says that if the choice is between killing\nhim and letting him go, you have to let him go if the\nGarner factors aren't present. And we find nothing in\nthe law and no reason to create a new exception in the\nlaw that says that Garner doesn't apply if you're\nfleeing by vehicle.\nThank you. We ask that the Court of Appeals\nbe affirmed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Jones.\nMr. Savrin, you have four minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP W. SAVRIN,\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. SAVRIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nLet me refocus for a moment that in order\nfor the officer to be denied qualified immunity in this\ncontext a jury would have to be able to find two things.\nOne, that no -- that there was no probable cause, and\nsecond, that that was clearly established. And I think\nthat the discussion this morning if nothing else shows\nthat it's not clearly established.\nAs far as the Fourth Amendment is concerned,\nI think the measure needs to be exactly as this Court\nstated in Graham versus Connor, which is looking at the\nfacts from the standpoint of the officer on the scene,\nbecause after all, he has to make split-second\ndecisions. He does not have the benefit of taking\ndepositions of Mr. Harris --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What am I supposed to do?\nI mean, I'll look again at the tape. I certainly will\ndo that. But suppose I look at the tape and I end up\nwith Chico Marx's old question with respect to the Court\nof Appeals: Who do you believe, me or your own eyes?\nMR. SAVRIN: Your Honor, I think the answer\nto that question was provided in this decision in\nOrnelas versus United States, a decision by this Court\nin 1996 that came up in the context of a criminal, a\ndirect criminal appeal involving the question of\nprobable cause. And this Court set forth very clearly\nthat the historical facts are given deference. The\nquestion of, a legal question about whether those facts\nreasonably give rise to probable cause is an independent\nde novo review.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Whether he is endangering\nanybody is a historical fact, no? So what do you do\nabout that finding?\nMR. SAVRIN: I don't believe that is\nhistorical fact.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is.\nMR. SAVRIN: The historical facts here are\nwhether Mr. Harris was driving excessively, whether he\nwas driving across the line, whether he was driving at\nhigh rates of speed, whether there was anybody in his\npath, whether he had collided with anyone. I think the\nquestion about whether or not those facts give rise to\nprobable cause to believe that Harris was a threat of\nserious physical harm is a legal issue, and I think the\nCourt of Appeals recognized that in this case when they\napplied a different analysis or came out with a\ndifferent result to those same undisputed facts.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the, the court\nsaying -- and this is on page 39 A of the petition\nappendix -- when Harris was driving away from officers\nand when there, when there were no other motorists or\npedestrians nearby, thus casting doubt on defendant's\nassertion that at the time of the ramming, Harris posed\nan immediate threat of harm to others.\nThis is a finding that there were no other\nmotorists or pedestrians nearby when the ramming\noccurred.\nMR. SAVRIN: And that is a fact that we\naccept as true in the immediate vicinity. The tape\nshows that there was a vehicle just 12 seconds before,\nand I think that a reasonable officer at the time would\nbelieve that that wasn't going to be the last vehicle on\nthat road.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I would hope he would wait\nuntil there were no pedestrians or vehicles coming\nbefore he, before he did the ramming.\nMR. SAVRIN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I assume he waited\nprecisely for that kind of a gap in the traffic?\nMR. SAVRIN: Yes, Your Honor. Exactly. He\nhad limited options and I believe it was a no-win\nscenario. And he took the best course that he\nreasonably believed he could at the time. And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you agree with\nMr. Jones' statement that none of Mr. Harris' conduct\nrose to the level of a felony?\nMR. SAVRIN: I would not, Your Honor. In\nour brief we did list a number of felonies that\nMr. Harris, that we believe he committed. But I would\ngo back to Garner, and Garner says that an armed suspect\nwould have been a different case. And Garner also says\nthat some misdemeanors such as drunk driving are more\ndangerous that some felonies such as white collar crime.\nSo I think the question should not be whether it's a\ntechnical issue of crossing the line from misdemeanor to\nfelony, but the harm that is being caused by the\ncontinued driving that's exactly what occurred in this\ncase.\nAnd if I could respond to Justice Breyer's\nquestion about what to do in terms of responding to\nMr. Marx's question, I think the Ornelas case says that\nyou would review it for clear error. And in this case\nyou would not owe deference of a finding of fact by the\nlower court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n"
