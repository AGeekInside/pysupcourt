        "content": "(11:05 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Case 10-1219, Kappos v. Hyatt.\nMs. Anders.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. ANDERS: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nSection 145 of the Patent Act permits a\nperson who has sought a patent from the PTO and believes\nthat the agency has wrongly denied his application to\nseek judicial review of that decision in district court.\nThe Federal Circuit in this case held that the plaintiff\nin a section 145 action may obtain a more favorable\nstandard of review, de novo review, by flouting the\nPTO's rules during the examination process.\nUnder the court's approach, a plaintiff may\npresent to the court material new evidence that he\nrefused or failed without cause to present to the PTO.\nAnd as his reward, he is given de novo review of the\nPTO's expert determinations on all of the relevant\nissues.\nFor three reasons, that unprecedented regime\nshould not be allowed to stand: First, principles of\nadministrative deference and exhaustion require that the\nPTO be given the opportunity to apply its expert\njudgment to all of the reasonably available evidence.\nFor that reason, section 145 should be interpreted as a\nsafety valve proceeding that permits applicants to\nintroduce evidence to the court that they reasonably\ncould not have presented to the PTO.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can you only get a 145\nproceeding when you have new evidence?\nMS. ANDERS: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose I have no new\nevidence and -- and I want to challenge. Can I bring a\n145?\nMS. ANDERS: Yes, section 145 --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMS. ANDERS: -- permits any applicant\ndissatisfied with a decision of the PTO --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And on what basis does the\ncourt decide the case? De novo?\nMS. ANDERS: No, the Federal Circuit has\nheld that in those cases substantial evidence review\napplies, and where the Federal Circuit gets that is this\nCourt's case in Morgan v. Daniels. That was an action\nunder section 145's predecessor. There was no new\nevidence in that case, and the Court held that this was\na proceeding in the nature of a suit to set aside a\njudgment, the judgment of the expert agency which had\nmade this determination, and that, therefore, because\nthis was administrative review, a deferential standard\nof review should apply.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMS. ANDERS: So, it's quite clear that\nwhen --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How close a predecessor is\nthe predecessor?\nMS. ANDERS: All of the material language is\n-- is the same. There's -- there's no material\ndifference for purposes of this case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the Morgan case\ninvolved -- it wasn't a contest between the PTO and the\nwould-be patent holder; it was an interference\nproceeding, wasn't it?\nMS. ANDERS: That's correct, Justice\nGinsburg. It was an interference proceeding, and that's\nbecause, at the time, section 145's predecessor applied\nequally to interferences and to ex parte patent denials.\nBut the Court's reasoning, its discussion of -- of the\npredecessor statute, did not distinguish based on the\nfact that this was an interference. And also this\nCourt --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought that -- it's\ninteresting that the language of Morgan and one of its\ncompanion cases, not companion in the sense of being\nheard at the same time, but on the same issue -- Radio\nCity case -- both of them don't talk in the language of\ntoday. They don't talk about deference. They don't\ntalk about substantial evidence. They talk about\nwhether the PTO has expertise, and presumptions that\ntheir factfindings based on their expertise have to be\novercome with some convincing evidence.\nSo, they're talking in different language,\nbut the concept they're talking about is one where the\ncourt does accept findings of the PTO on the matters\nthat involve their expertise and give them weight,\nsubstantial weight, essentially, and only overturn it if\nthe court is, in the words of Morgan and Radio City,\n\"thoroughly convinced\" that they were wrong.\nSo, what's wrong with that standard?\nEverybody likes the deference language of today, but\nthey were very clear in what they were saying: If the\nPTO made a finding, you decide whether that finding was\nbased on its expertise, and if it was, you don't change\nit, court, unless you're thoroughly convinced they were\nwrong.\nIs there anything wrong with that? With\nthat articulation of what the standard should be in all\nsituations, whether there's new evidence or no new\nevidence?\nMS. ANDERS: Well, I think here we are\nsuggesting that in -- in 145 actions, when there is new\nevidence, the -- Morgan's \"thorough conviction\" standard\nshould apply. And that reflects the fact that the court\nneeds to look at the new evidence, but because the PTO\nhas made an expert determination, as the Court said in\nMorgan, that determination should not be overturned\nunless there's a high degree of certainty.\nAnd I would note that that is essentially\nwhat this Court did just last term in Microsoft v. i4i.\nThere the Court said that when a third party is\nchallenging the validity of a granted patent, that the\nthird party should have to show invalidity based on a\nheightened burden of proof, clear and convincing\nevidence. And that reflects the same wisdom that --\nthat underlies --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. Let me tell\nyou what my problem is with this case. It is the issue\nthat Verizon raised and the lack of connection between\nthe district court's holding and the circuit court's\nholding. The district court excluded the affidavit for\nthe proposed arguments on the basis of them being new\narguments that Board rules precluded them from raising\nat the stage they did. The circuit court described the\naffidavit as new evidence. And the Verizon amicus brief\nsays: Court, be careful, because it's not really clear\nwhat's new evidence in this affidavit and what's new\nargument.\nAnd that question troubles me, for the\nfollowing reason: Verizon posits that the issue of\nwhether a description is specific enough is a legal\nquestion to which the PTO is not entitled to deference.\nWhy, other than Federal Circuit and Patent Board\nprecedent, is that right? And can you explain why this\naffidavit that was rejected is in fact new evidence and\nnot merely new argument?\nMS. ANDERS: Certainly, Justice Sotomayor.\nI think the district court did characterize\nthis as new evidence, and the reason it did that was\nbecause Mr. Hyatt made a concerted strategic decision\nhere to present his affidavit as new evidence. In form,\nthis is -- this is factual evidence. This is a\ndeclaration containing proffered testimony that Mr.\nHyatt would offer if there were a trial. So, it is in\nform factual evidence, and in order to take advantage of\nthe possibility of introducing new evidence in the\nsection 145 action, Mr. Hyatt argued that this was\nnew factual evidence that should --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me what\n-- other than that it's in the form of an affidavit,\ntell me what in the content was new evidence? I want to\nget away from the labels, and I want to get to the\nsubstance because I've looked at all of these\nsubmissions, and it sounds like what I read in briefs\nevery day.\nMS. ANDERS: Certainly. I think whether or\nnot the -- the ultimate question of whether the written\ndescription is sufficient is a question of law. It\nwould be one that rests on several subsidiary\nfactfindings, including what the ordinary skill in the\nart is, what a person of ordinary skill in the art would\nunderstand when he reads the specification, and where in\nthe specification there is support, there is description\nsupport, for the claims that shows that Mr. Hyatt\npossessed the invention that he claimed.\nAnd so, I think when you look at what\nhappened at the PTO, the examiner said: Despite my\nexpertise, I can't tell where in the specification your\nclaims are supported. This is at 258 -- it's a 250-page\nspecification reprinted in the joint appendix. It has\nover 100 pages of diagrams, source code, and 117 claims.\nAnd so, the PTO asked for this information; Mr. Hyatt\nrefused to present it or he didn't present it, and then,\non rehearing, the Board said that he had not had any\ncause not to present this new -- this new argument. And\nso, at that point, Mr. Hyatt went into the 145\nproceeding, and he was -- he characterized this as\nfactual evidence in order to get around, presumably, or\nit would be reasonable to try to get around, the Board's\nruling that he couldn't present new evidence.\nNow, you certainly could characterize this\nas legal argument. We believe that we would win on that\nground as well, even if this were new argument, because\ncertainly the PTO is entitled to enforce its rules here,\nand both the district court and the panel found that the\nPTO did not abuse its discretion in -- in holding that\nMr. Hyatt had forfeited his right to raise this\nargument. But that's not -- that's not an additional\nquestion presented that we -- that we added here because\nit's a very case-specific question.\nBut at any rate, the -- the entire case has\nnow been litigated on the basis of this being factual\nevidence --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Your case is stronger if it\nisn't new facts, right? That's what you'd say.\nMS. ANDERS: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Your case is stronger if in\nfact it's only new argument and not new fact.\nMS. ANDERS: Certainly. I think it should\nbe very clear that we would win on that ground. The en\nbanc court here characterized this as new factual\nevidence and applied a rule that will -- will govern, if\nit's left to stand, in all 145 actions, which would\npermit applicants to withhold evidence from the PTO.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Anders, one of the\nproblems with, I think, your position, is it sounds very\nstrange to have two proceedings, one where you go\ndirectly to the Federal Circuit under 101 -- 141; and\nthen this other one where you go to the district court,\nwhere if that's not, as Judge Newman said, a whole new\n-- whole new game, then why would Congress create two\njudicial review routes, one in the district court\nreviewable in the Federal Circuit, the other directly in\nthe Federal Circuit, if there's no difference? That is,\nif in both of them, it's not de novo review; it is\nreviewing what the -- what the agency did under the\nordinary standard for reviewing agency action.\nWhat's different about the -- the 145\nproceeding?\nMS. ANDERS: Well, in the 145 proceeding,\nthe applicant has the ability to introduce new evidence\nthat couldn't be presented to the PTO. And I think --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But what kind of evidence is\nthat, Ms. Anders?\nMS. ANDERS: Well, I think there are two\nprimary categories, both of which can be very important\nin the examination proceedings. The first is oral\ntestimony. The PTO doesn't hear oral testimony, but it\nis routine in the examination procedures for --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So, in the 145, an applicant\ncan take all his written affidavits and say: I want to\npresent oral testimony, on these exact matters, but\nlive.\nMS. ANDERS: He could -- he could certainly\nbring that to the district court, yes. Now, the\ndistrict court always, under general evidentiary rules,\ncan say: I believe this evidence is cumulative; so, I'm\nnot going to hear it.\nBut to the extent that the district court\nbelieves it would be helpful to hear oral testimony, for\ninstance, if the PTO's determinations involve\ncredibility decisions, then certainly the district court\ncould hear that testimony, and that's often how these\nproceedings have been used.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But to the extent the\nsubstance of that testimony was something that he could\nhave brought to the PTO, that testimony, in your view,\nwould be out of bounds.\nMS. ANDERS: There would have to be a\nreasonable justification for not having presented it --\nJUSTICE BREYER: There has to be a\nreasonable -- some kind of justification. Can you work\nwith the word \"equitable\"? I mean, this was an\nequitable action, and could you say that the -- to the\ndistrict court, well, of course, you -- assuming you'd\nwin on the second question. But on the first question,\nthis is not an on/off thing. That's your real objection\nto the de novo standard.\nYou say: But these are equitable actions,\nand generally an individual should not be allowed to run\naround the PTO. So, you better have some kind of\nreason, but leave it up to the -- to the district courts\nto work with that word \"equitable\" and to -- it seems to\nme there will be a lot of shading cases here where you\ncan't quite tell if it is new or isn't new and some\nparts are and some aren't. But just leave it up to the\ndistrict court and say: Take into account the fact that\npeople should not be allowed to run around the PTO and\nwork equity. That's kicking the ball back.\nNow, if you like that, let me know. If you\ndon't like it, tell me what we -- why -- what should\nwe -- you want an absolute rule? Tell me why.\nMS. ANDERS: Well, the standard we're\nproposing is that the district court has discretion to\ndetermine whether there was reasonable cause not to\npresent the evidence to the PTO.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if it says there isn't,\nthen it can't hear it? I mean, imagine you're sitting\nthere as a district judge, you think: Oh, my God, they\nshould have presented it, but this is the key matter\nforever. Do I really pay no attention to it at all?\nMS. ANDERS: Well, I think it's no different\nfrom exhaustion or forfeiture rules in any other\ncontext --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Except you have a history\nhere.\nMS. ANDERS: The Board applicant has the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You have the history of the\npre-APA section 145 where they apparently did take the\nevidence in.\nMS. ANDERS: Well, certainly in the early\ncases, they took new evidence in. But by 1952, which is\nwhen Congress re-enacted this provision, you have the\nlower courts applying the Morgan standard and saying:\nBased on Morgan's reasoning, because we know that the\nPTO is the primary factfinder, because we know their\ndecision is so important, we will apply limitations on\nnew evidence because we don't think that that\nevidence --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But then you really do go\nback to Justice Ginsburg's question because your\nunderstanding of what they wouldn't have a reasonable\nopportunity to present -- I mean, it's very, very\nnarrow. It's a bunch of cumulative testimony that\nnobody would want to present and no judge would want to\nhear. And other than that, you're basically saying in\nall circumstances, well, they could have done that in\nthe PTO. So, then you have Justice Ginsburg's problem,\nwhich is these are two channels that are exactly the\nsame.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And you were beginning to\nanswer that by saying, well, you can't have oral\ntestimony before the PTO. But what else? I asked you\nwhat would be -- what's different about 141 and 145 on\nyour view. And you said one thing is oral testimony.\nWhat else?\nMS. ANDERS: Well, the other primary\ncategory of evidence that could come in would be\nevidence that has a temporal component. If there's a\nlot of evidence that could be relevant to patentability\nthat develops only slowly or that might arise very late\nin the process. So, for instance, obviousness is a --\nis a very common ground of rejection. But one thing\nthat can be relevant to obviousness is if the invention,\nonce disclosed, has commercial success. So, this type\nof sales evidence can -- can develop very late in --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But I thought that your\nbrief suggested that even with respect to that kind of\nevidence, a person can go back to the PTO. Is that\nright?\nMS. ANDERS: For the most part, the record\ncloses once the -- once the applicant files his brief on\nappeal to the Board. And then it can be months or years\nbefore the Board issues its decision.\nNow, there are -- there are a couple of\navenues through which an applicant could still introduce\nnew evidence even when the Board is considering the\nappeal. But both of those, as the process goes --\nthat's the request for continuing examination and the\ncontinuation application. Both of those have increasing\ndown sides that require the applicant to abandon his\nappeal or give up some of his patent -- the patent term\nthat he would presumably get. So --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if -- what if\nthe new evidence is in reaction to the PTO's ruling?\nThe PTO says: Look, we're not -- we're not going to\nissue a patent because you didn't show us that, you\nknow, the valve in the back of the thing or whatever\nwas -- was novel, and we think that's important. So --\nand the applicant goes to, under 145, to the district\ncourt and said: Well, I didn't submit that evidence\nbecause I didn't have any idea that that was going to be\na significant issue, and I'm -- you know, I'm sorry,\nbut, you know, I have a good basis for not thinking of\nthat, and here it is.\nIs that the type of new evidence that could\nbe admitted?\nMS. ANDERS: Well, in the first instance,\nthe PTO's procedures actually provide -- they actually\nprovide for this situation, and that's when the Board or\nthe examiner enters a new ground of rejection. Then, at\nthat point, the applicant has the right to reopen\nprosecution that -- introduce new evidence --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, this is an\nexception? I thought you were telling us earlier you\ngenerally can't get --\nMS. ANDERS: Right. Yes. I'm sorry. This\nis -- this is an exception --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh.\nMS. ANDERS: -- that would apply when\nthere's a new ground of decision. That is something\nthat Mr. Hyatt could have tried to take advantage of.\nHe -- he didn't. He simply sought rehearing. But in\nany event, both the district court -- the district court\ncarefully considered the Board's grounds of rejection\nand decided that this wasn't -- that these weren't new\ngrounds of rejection, and the panel affirmed that.\nBut to get back to the difference between\n141 and 145, I think Congress separated these two\nproceedings out in 1927. Before that, you had gotten an\nappeal first on the record and then -- and then the bill\nin equity under 145. So, Congress separated this in\n1927, and it appears from the legislative history that\nit's concerned with streamlining the proceeding and\nhaving more efficiency in -- in patent appeals.\nSo, it would be reasonable to conclude that\nthere would be some number of applicants who -- probably\nthe majority of applicants, who wouldn't have new\nevidence, who could go to 141 and simply get a final\ndecision from a court after one court proceeding in the\ncourt of appeals.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What evidence --\nMS. ANDERS: But --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, please, continue.\nMS. ANDERS: Simply that there are -- for\nsome number of other applicants, it was important to\nprovide a safety valve because the PTO couldn't consider\noral testimony and because certainly, at the time, oral\ntestimony was a major concern in interference\nproceedings, where you'd often have two inventors saying\nI invented it first; no, I invented it first. And you'd\nhave this credibility fight. So, it was very important\nat the time to provide a safety valve proceeding for\nthose applicants.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you said that you\ncould -- you could go into court on 145 even if you had\nno new evidence.\nMS. ANDERS: Yes, and Morgan, in fact, was a\ncase like that. It appears some applicants may have\ndone that, but --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, you do -- in that\ncase, would there be any difference between 141 and 145\nother than you go to a different court?\nMS. ANDERS: No, I don't think there would\nbe for an applicant who had no new evidence at that\ntime. But I think the -- the other alternative, to\ntreat 145 as an entirely de novo proceeding that allows\nany new evidence that the applicant failed without cause\nto present to the PTO, thereby obtaining de novo review,\nit's -- there's no evident policy justification for\nCongress to provide it.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that was -- that was\nJudge Newman's view, but the en banc court took the\nmiddle position. Often, in trial court evidence\nproblems, the judge says, well, it goes to its weight,\nnot the admissibility. And it seems to me that's what\nJudge -- the en banc majority was saying, that the fact\nthat it was not presented before or that it points in a\ndifferent direction from what the PTO found goes to its\nweight, not its admissibility. In other words, they\nwill give consideration to the fact that it wasn't\nintroduced and -- and maybe discount it as a result,\nunless there's a reason. So, it just depends on the\nfacts of the case.\nNumber one, am I reading or am I summarizing\nthe en banc majority correctly? And, number two, why\nisn't that a sensible way to interpret the statute so,\nas Justice Ginsburg is suggesting, you give some meaning\nto 145? It's -- it performs a function that 141 does\nnot.\nMS. ANDERS: Well, I think you're correct,\nJustice Kennedy, that -- that the en banc court believed\nthat administrative deference principles didn't weigh\nagainst its conclusions because the district court could\ngive more weight to the new evidence.\nBut that is not an adequate response, we\ndon't think, because this is still de novo review. So,\nonce the applicant introduces new evidence, the manner\nin which the district court evaluates the PTO's\nconclusions has entirely changed. This is no longer a\ndeferential standard looking at the evidence. This is\nactually a de novo review, with no deference given to\nany of the PTO's factfindings, even on the evidence\nbefore it. And we don't think that's a sensible way to\nread the statute because there's no basis in the text of\nthe statute for a bifurcated standard that would provide\nfor deferential \"thorough conviction\" review when\nthere's no new evidence, but then de novo --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then -- then you're\nsaying that we -- that we should choose either between\nyour position or Judge Newman's position.\nMS. ANDERS: Well, Judge Newman's position I\nthink is inconsistent with Morgan, because Morgan was a\nsection -- Revised Statute 4915 action. It was a 145\naction with no new evidence. And the Court there said\nthat the \"thorough conviction\" standard should apply\nbecause this was administrative review. So, to hold\nthat 145 requires de novo review even when there's no\nnew evidence would be to overrule Morgan.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure why --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But Morgan only talked about\nthe standard of review; isn't that right? Morgan has\nvery little to say about what types of evidence ought to\nbe admitted in this proceeding. And one thing we could\ndo is to separate out these two things and say, you\nknow, we think that there's a basis for one, for, let's\nsay, giving the government a fairly deferential standard\nof review -- call it clear and convincing, call it\nthorough conviction -- but go the other way, rule\nagainst you, on the evidentiary point, which Morgan says\nnothing about.\nMS. ANDERS: Well, I think Morgan did not\ndirectly address this -- the admissibility of new\nevidence, but by saying that the PTO is the primary\ndecisionmaker and that the court should not lightly set\naside what the PTO does, it invoked administrative\ndeference principles, which in turn show why all of the\nreasonably available evidence needs to be presented to\nthe agency.\nAnd -- I do think that it -- it wouldn't\nmake sense to have a de novo standard of review for\npatent denials any time new evidence comes in, largely\nbased on this Court's decision in Microsoft. There, the\nCourt rejected the argument that a third party who had\nno opportunity to present evidence to the PTO should not\nbe held to as high a standard of review. So, it would\nbe particularly perverse here to say that de novo review\nshould apply whenever a patent applicant puts in any new\nevidence that --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But I don't know that\nthat -- I think you're confusing the nature of the\nreview, which is de novo, new, with the -- the burdens\nthat attach to the proof. Those are two different\nconcepts. And so, that's what Microsoft said. Don't\nconfuse burdens with standards of review. That it's de\nnovo review is one thing, but even in de novo review, we\noften give more weight or presumptive weight to some\nfacts as opposed to others. And that's what I think\nMorgan was talking about. Morgan was very clear:\nWhether it was new evidence or not, you give -- you\naccept as valid whatever the PTO does, and you require\nto be thoroughly convinced by new evidence or not that\nthey were wrong.\nI don't know why that standard can't apply\nin any situation. I think that's what Judge Newman\nintended, although he didn't say that.\nSo, why are we confusing the standard of\nreview with the burden?\nMS. ANDERS: Well, I think that the\npresumption of validity and the need to give deference\nto the PTO's determinations are essentially two ways\nof -- of saying the same thing. As Microsoft noted, the\npresumption of -- of validity comes from the assumption\nthat the agency is presumed to do its job. That's what\nJudge Rich said. And that in turn is what the Court\nsaid in RCA, where it announced the presumption of\nvalidity, and there it relied on Morgan.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I have two problems with\nyour argument. The first is -- and I know that it may\nbe unique to me because many of my colleagues say that\nyou don't rely on legislative history, but I'm not\nrelying just on legislative history. I'm relying that\nthe legislative history is replete with the commissioner\nof patents himself saying that section 145 required de\nnovo review. And witness after witness tried to argue\nfor Congress to change it, and it didn't, arguing that\nit required de novo review.\nSecond, our cases repeatedly describe it as\nde novo review. So, you got to get past that.\nAnd then you got to get past that between\n1927 and 1945 you have Barrett on your side. But there\nare plenty of courts, including the Second Circuit, and\na very respected jurist, Learned Hand, saying that if\nyou exclude new evidence, it should only be if it's on\nprinciples of estoppel, that someone intentionally\nwithheld evidence from the PTO.\nSo, how do you deal with a record that\ndoesn't basic -- that doesn't support your basic\nargument?\nMS. ANDERS: I think the record does support\nour argument, Justice Sotomayor, because what you see in\nthe early 20th century after Morgan had construed this\nas administrative review -- you referred to the 1927\nhearings. There, I think many of the people used the\nphrase \"de novo\" in a very loose way that probably was a\nresult of its dating before the APA. They referred to\nit mostly as -- as a contrast between the original\naction and the appeal. And that's the same thing you\nsee in the early cases. For instance, Globe-Union\nreferred to this as a de novo proceeding, even as it\nsaid that the thorough conviction standard should apply\nand new evidence should be limited because this was\nadministrative. So, I don't think you can place very\nmuch weight on the use of the term \"de novo.\"\nI do think it's notable that every time\nthere was an objection in the cases before 1952, the\ncourts applied limitations on new evidence. Dowling,\nthe case you referred to -- that was -- that was dicta;\nthe court discussed the standard but didn't actually\napply it there. And so, I think the most natural\ninference is that in 1952, Congress looked to Morgan and\nit looked to these cases, and it viewed this as an\nadministrative review proceeding.\nIf I could reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Panner.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF AARON M. PANNER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. PANNER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe language of section 145, the structure\nof the judicial review provisions in the Patent Act, the\nlong history of the provision, and this Court's\nconstructions of its predecessors all make clear that\nthe Government's argument that a plaintiff is barred\nfrom introducing new evidence in an action under section\n145, except in the unusual if not extraordinary\ncircumstance where the applicant had no opportunity to\nintroduce the substance of that evidence, is incorrect.\nSection 145 does not follow the modern norm\nof on-the-record review. Such review is afforded under\nsections 141 to 144. And no principle of administrative\nlaw supports the Government's \"no opportunity\" standard\nin situations where Congress has authorized a trial de\nnovo to obtain relief from adverse agency action.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The problem I have\nwith your submission: You say there are basically two\nroutes to get review of a denial by the Patent Office.\nThe first is, under 141, you appeal to the Federal\nCircuit, right, and in that situation, you're limited to\nthe record before the agency --\nMR. PANNER: Yes, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- on which you\nlost. And there's deference to the agency, which ruled\nagainst you.\nUnder 145, you can add new evidence, you\ncould address questions that the PTO raised, saying you\ndon't -- you haven't dealt with this valve in the back,\nand you could say, well, here's new evidence dealing\nwith that. There's no deference to the agency, and to\nsome extent you can pick which judge you want to hear,\nto the extent you can -- can do that.\nWhy would anybody proceed under section 141\ninstead of 145?\nMR. PANNER: Well, Your Honor, to be clear\nabout what is permitted under section 145, it is correct\nthat new evidence can be permitted to go to issues that\nhave been properly ruled on by the PTO in the course of\nruling on the ex parte application.\nThe reason that appeals to the -- to the\nFederal Circuit are quite common is because often the\nissue that is the basis for the rejection is a legal\nissue. And as to those issues, there's de novo review\nin the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit will be\nruling on those legal issues in time in any event. It\nis really in the circumstance where there is a factual\nquestion as to which new evidence is relevant, where the\napplicant will avail himself of what --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, that in -- in\nevery case where it's anything other than a purely legal\nissue, you would go under 145?\nMR. PANNER: Well, Your Honor, if you had\nevidence that you wanted to present, and the remedies at\nthe PTO were inadequate for one reason or another. But\nin thinking about the practical implications of the\nprocedural option that section 145 affords, it's\nimportant to recognize that this procedure has been in\nplace for generations, and it has been understood by the\npatent bar as reflected in decisions of the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I know.\nThat's why I'm -- I'm really confused, because I take it\nthat people don't often use 145, right? They almost\nalways appeal to the Federal Circuit.\nMR. PANNER: Well, I think that the number\nof cases involving rejections that are taken up into\ncourt are somewhat limited, in part because applicants\noften have an adequate remedy before the PTO. But where\nthere is a circumstance where there has been a final --\na Board action, a case like this one, where the --\nthe grounds for rejection, not meaning the technical\ngrounds, because the grounds of written description had\nbeen identified in the examiner's decision, but where\nthe reasoning that justified the rejection was quite new\nin the decision of the Board and where there were --\nthere was factual evidence that the applicant wanted to\nsubmit to a generalist district court to permit the\ndistrict court to understand where in the specification\nthe support for these elements --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Ms. --\nMs. Anders told us that there's a procedure before the\nPTO that lets you deal with these -- that sort of\nsomething came up that you didn't think about, and you\ncan address that.\nMR. PANNER: Your Honor, what -- what\nMs. Anders was referring to, I believe, is the\npossibility to reopen where there are new grounds for a\nrejection. There were no new grounds here because it\nwas still a written description rejection. The\napplicant did argue in -- in filing for rehearing that\nthe explanation that the Board had provided was one that\nhe had not been able to discern from the examination --\nthe examiner's rejection.\nAnd if you just look at the record in this\ncase, when the examiner said that there was support\nlacking for the features that were -- where the Board\neventually did -- did affirm, there is no explanation as\nto what element was missing, why the -- why the feature\nwas not supported in the specification. The Board\nprovided that reasoned explanation, and the applicant\ntried to respond, and the Board refused to -- to accept\nit.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do you think -- in terms of\nthe second question on the standard of review, I'm\nsomewhat -- I'd like your response to the approach, that\nwhere there's ambiguity -- I mean, you're going to win\nif there's no ambiguity. But if there's ambiguity, I\nthink that 1946 makes a difference. That is, preceding\nthat time, every agency went its own way, and you had\ndozens of specialized methods of review. And the whole\npurpose of 50 years of administrative law has been to\ntry to create uniformity across agencies in a vast\nFederal Government.\nAnd now, what was obviously worrying me in\nthe first case and this case, too --\nMR. PANNER: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- is that we're chipping\naway at that, and that will be very hard for lawyers and\nfor ordinary people to understand if we suddenly go back\nand create specialized rules in favor of each agency\nthat always wants a specialized rule, of course; they\nthink what they do is terribly important, which it is,\nI'm sure.\nBut that's -- that's why I'm saying if\nambiguity on the standard of review, you go with\nuniformity.\nMR. PANNER: Right. Well, there's really\ntwo points, Your Honor: With respect to standard of\nreview, which is separate from the question of the\nadmissibility of the evidence -- on standard of review,\nthe APA says that where there's a trial de novo, the\nstandard is whether the finding is unwarranted by the\nfacts under (2)(F). So --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's -- that begs the\nquestion in a sense because they're interlinked. I\nmean, the same reasons would support that it's not a\ntrial de novo even if you introduce some new evidence.\nMR. PANNER: Well, I think that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It is a -- it is an old\ntrial with some new evidence, and there will be a\nthousand different variations on that theme.\nMR. PANNER: I think that goes to Justice\nSotomayor's point really, which is that there is a trial\nde novo, and clearly at a minimum what the courts are\ntalking about when they refer to this, not 5 times, not\n10 times, but dozens of times, this Court several times,\nlower courts pervasively, when they are talking about a\nde novo proceeding, they're talking about the fact that\nthe applicant can introduce new evidence to attempt to\novercome the adverse action that was -- was entered by\nthe agency.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, the new\npart -- I get that.\nMR. PANNER: Okay. And then the question\nbecomes, what is the appropriate standard of review when\nthere is new evidence going to this question? And the\nanswer here goes I think to -- section (2)(F) says that\nthere's a -- the question is whether it's warranted by\nthe facts. There is then the question of what weight\nmay be afforded to a particular agency -- agency\ndetermination. At a minimum, the fact that there has\nbeen a rejection shifts the burden. When an applicant\ngoes to the PTO, there's an assumption of an entitlement\nto patent, unless the PTO can show that the applicant is\nnot entitled to that patent. So, the burden is on the\nPTO.\nOnce there has been a proper rejection by\nthe agency and the Board has ruled, then the applicant\nbears the burden. So, at a minimum, there has been a\nshifting. And the applicant would then bear the burden.\nAnd as a practical matter, as the Federal Circuit\nindicated, the district judge will weigh the evidence\nbefore it, including the new evidence and the findings\nby the agency, in making its determination as to whether\nthe applicant has carried -- carried his burden to show\nthat he's entitled to the patent.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If the judge does that,\nwhat -- how does he articulate the weight that he gives\nto what the PTO find? Does he say I give deference to\nthis? I give substantial deference? This was all\ndiscussed -- page 9 of your brief, you summarized what\nthe majority opinion of the en banc court did.\nMR. PANNER: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And in that connection, on\nthis same line, do you -- do you agree with that\nsummary?\nMR. PANNER: I do, Your Honor. That is to\nsay that what the Federal circuit recognized is that in\ndetermining the weight to give to new evidence and\ndetermining what weight to give to the determined --\nprior determination of the agency, it's appropriate for\nthe district court to look at the circumstances of the\nnew evidence. And one of the things that's -- this is\nan equitable -- well, was an equitable action. And, of\ncourse, the judge is sitting without a jury.\nIn Microsoft, there was obviously concern by\nthis Court that there not be shifting standards of proof\nthat would be confusing to a jury and could lead to\ncollateral litigation about that. Where a district\njudge is making a determination about a factual issue,\nthe district judge can as a practical matter quite\nreasonably determine what was before the Board, what did\nthe Board decide, what was the basis for that, how\nstrongly supported is it, versus how -- how -- to what\nextent is this new evidence something that really\nrequires me to look at this anew.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in line with\nJustice Breyer's question, can you give us an example of\nsome other agency review proceeding that is somewhat\nlike this, or is this just unique?\nMR. PANNER: I don't think it's entirely\nunique at all, Your Honor. That is to say, for example,\nin proceedings where there's orders to pay money by the\nFCC, the findings of the agency are given prima facie\nweight in an action -- in an enforcement action. And\nso, new evidence is permitted, and the district judge\nwould make a determination based on the record and the\nnew evidence. But the party or the agency seeking to\nenforce the prior order would be able to rely on those\nfactual findings to -- as prima facie evidence where, if\nthere was no contrary evidence, it would actually\nestablish those facts.\nThere are other administrative review\nschemes that do afford trial de novo in which the -- you\nknow, there may be more or less deference to whatever\nthe agency did depending on -- on what the record may\nreflect about the considered judgment of the agency.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are there limits on the\nnew evidence that can be produced? Are there any\nlimits, in your view?\nMR. PANNER: Well, Your Honor, I think that\nthe principle of estoppel that was recognized in Barrett\nis not one that we're -- we're challenging. That is to\nsay, in a circumstance in which an applicant -- and, of\ncourse, that was an interference proceeding, and it's\nperhaps easier to foresee this happening in an\ninterference context, but in that case, the plaintiff\nhad actually suppressed, had directed witnesses not to\nanswer questions that went into a particular factual\narea and then, when -- after appeal and when the\ndistrict court action was brought, attempted to\nintroduce the very evidence that he had -- that the\napplicant had deliberately suppressed. And the district\ncourt said, look, that -- that is -- gives rise to an\nestoppel, which seems to me a generally applicable\nprinciple that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Well, if you're\nwilling to accept that, then what about broadening that\nto prevent people from running around the PTO, and\nsimply saying unless the -- unless the person, the\npotential patentee, unless he wants to -- unless he has\nshown he can show that he's innocent, that is to say it\nwasn't deliberate, it wasn't negligent, it wasn't a part\nof a trial -- of a strategy, unless he shows he was\ntotally without sin in some form of words in not\nintroducing the evidence the first time, he can't\nintroduce it now?\nMR. PANNER: I think the difficulty with\nthat, Your Honor, is not only is it inconsistent with\nthe practice of the courts, which have always recognized\nthat, but it also ignores the fact that there needs to\nbe decisions that an applicant makes about what evidence\nto present to the PTO. And there may be good cause for\nnot presenting evidence in the PTO that becomes quite\nrelevant once --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, say that. Say unless\nhe can show that there was good cause for his not having\nintroduced it before the PTO, he -- the -- the court now\nwon't consider it.\nMR. PANNER: Well, Your Honor, we would --\nwe would certainly meet that good cause standard in this\ncase, but the thing that I think is difficult about that\nstandard is that it could potentially lead to all sorts\nof collateral litigation. In a typical case, for\nexample, an applicant will seek to introduce new expert\ntestimony that either was not or was -- is additional to\nwhatever was at issue -- was offered in the PTO. Often,\nexpert testimony will not be offered at all in an ex\nparte application.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, give us a standard\nand how is what -- the good cause that you're somehow\nwilling to accept different from the Government's\nreasonable cause standard? And equity seems to have\nrequired an intentional or bad faith withholding. Is\nthat what you want to limit yourself to? What do you do\nwith sort of the in between? The intentional and the\ngrossly negligent.\nMR. PANNER: Justice Sotomayor, to be clear,\nthe proper standard is -- does not permit exclusion of\nevidence because there was good cause to present it and\nit was not.\nThe standard for -- which we think is\nsupported in the cases is one that would permit the\nintroduction of evidence as the Federal Circuit said\nconsistent with the rules of evidence and civil\nprocedure. That's why principles of estoppel, which are\nreflected in ordinary equity practice, not just\nadministrative review contexts, would be -- would be\napplicable and could lead to the exclusion of evidence.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And what do you see the\nlimits of that estoppel -- equity principles? I think\nthat's what Justice Breyer was -- was referring to.\nWhat would be the contours of your equity limits?\nMR. PANNER: And I think that looking at the\n-- at the cases that were decided before 1952, which\neveryone seems to -- to agree is -- is the magic date,\nthe furthest that any court went was the decision in\nBarrett. And it's interesting that the panel decision\nin this case also relied on the idea in Barrett.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's a little bit\nunfair, to characterize the cases as limited to that.\nSome talked about negligence.\nMR. PANNER: Not --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And some courts said it\nshould be intentional. There was a debate back and\nforth.\nMR. PANNER: In the court of -- in the court\nof appeals, Your Honor, the only exclusion of\nevidence --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes, I agree.\nMR. PANNER: -- was from Barrett, and that\nwas a case that involved, again, directing a witness not\nto answer, the suppression of inquiry into a particular\nfactual area where the applicant then -- changing his\nstory and claiming a different date for reduction of\npractice and a different basis for reduction to practice\nthan had been argued before the PTO -- attempted to\nintroduce the evidence that he had suppressed.\nSo, that's a very different circumstance.\nAnd the courts -- the decisions are actually at pains to\nsay that Barrett should not be over-read. The Third\nCircuit in the Carborundum case said that; the Nichols\ncase, which we've we cited in our brief, said that; and\nof course, as you pointed out, Judge Hand observed that\nin the -- in the Dowling case. Globe-Union said that.\nSo, even the cases that the Government itself relied on\nwere -- accepted evidence, despite the arguments that\nwere made by the defendants in those cases that this was\nevidence that should have been excluded because it could\nhave been presented, and -- and did consider it.\nAnd that brings us, I think -- there has\nbeen a lot of discussion about Morgan and the standard\nof review and what Morgan has to say about that. And\nthe critical point that this Court recognized in\nMicrosoft was that Morgan is one of the early cases and\nthen -- and Radio Corporation is another that depend on\nan idea of the presumption of validity, which of course\nwas then adopted by Congress in section 282 as a\nstatutory presumption, that was given that common law\nmeaning that required clear and convincing evidence.\nBut the clear and convincing evidence is to overcome the\ngrant of a property right to the defendant in those\ncases.\nWhat's critical in Morgan is the fact that\nthe -- the Patent Office had granted a patent to the\ndefendant, and it was a challenge to the validity of\nthat patent that the plaintiff's case relied on. And\nit's -- and that's absolutely clear because the Court\ncites to Johnson v. Towsley, which is a case involving a\nland grant. And what the Court says is our presumption\nis that when the executive has the power to give\nproperty rights, we don't get to review it.\nNow, in this case, we see a limited\nexception because there's a statute that actually tells\nus we have to do it, but that exception is going to be\nlimited. But if you look at what Morgan relies on,\nMorgan is not relying on agency expertise; it's relying\non agency authority, which is a different matter. And\nso -- and the authority that the agency had to grant a\nproperty right. In the -- in the conception of a -- of\nthe court of 1893 and the administrative law that\nexisted in 1893, the fact that there was no property\nright being challenged in an action where there was an\neffort to overcome a rejection means that this idea\nabout the presumption of the validity of the rights that\nhad been granted by an executive department doesn't come\ninto play. There had been no rights granted by the\nexecutive department, and there's a new proceeding in\nwhich, to quote Professor Merrill's article, the court\nhad \"the whole case.\" And that's really reflected in\nthe language that Congress chose.\nNow, of course, that -- the differences\nbetween what Congress provided under section 145 and the\nmodern administrative review do lead to some -- to some\nquestions. There is the question, you know, what should\nthe standard be if there is no new evidence? Which --\nyou know, which the court looked at.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And on that I think you\n-- you're not taking the position that Judge Newman did.\nI think -- didn't you say that if no new evidence is\nintroduced in a 145 proceeding, then the court engages\nin APA-style review?\nMR. PANNER: Your Honor, Judge Newman said\nthat if there -- that all -- all findings should be de\nnovo in a section 145 action, but the -- the majority of\nthe en banc court said that if there's no new\nevidence -- relying on what the Federal Circuit had held\nfor many years, that if there's no new evidence, then\nthe standard would be the substantial evidence standard\nthat would apply on appeal.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And that -- and that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And you agree with that?\nMR. PANNER: We haven't taken a position on\nit, but let me suggest --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I noticed that.\nMR. PANNER: -- why it might be right, Your\nHonor, which is that section 141 and section 144 do --\nthis Court in -- you know, held in Zurko that once you\nare in a situation where there is no new evidence -- and\nas an aside, Zurko emphasized that Morgan was a case\nthat was on no new evidence. Where you have a case\nthat's on no new evidence, there -- the APA standard of\nreview, substantial evidence, arbitrary/capricious\nreview, applies. And it might -- this might be the sort\nof narrow circumstance where to apply a de novo\nstandard, even though that may be otherwise suggested by\nthe language of section 145, would create an anomaly, as\n-- as this Court recognized in Zurko.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It seems to me you were\nintroducing such a gamesmanship. Anybody who wanted to\nget out of substantial deference under the APA just has\nto present an expert. That -- that's what makes little\nsense to me, trying to -- now we're hair-splitting in a\nvery minute way.\nMR. PANNER: Right. I don't -- I don't\nthink --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Articulate a standard\nthat would -- Newman is suggesting total de novo review\nwith no reference to any kind of presumption applied to\nthe PTO decision. Another way --\nMR. PANNER: I'm not sure --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- to look at it is the\nway I suggested, which is it doesn't matter whether\nthere's new evidence or not; what is the level of\nrespect that you are going to give to the PTO factual\nfindings?\nMR. PANNER: Right. And, Your Honor, I\nthink that the standard of proof is one of -- is the\npreponderance of the evidence. And the question of what\nweight -- as the Federal Circuit said, what weight to\nafford to that prior finding of the PTO would depend on\nwhat the record showed. That is the -- as the facts of\nthe case may appear -- in section 145, it requires the\ndistrict court to look at the findings and look at the\nnew evidence and to then make the determination.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Be -- as in the language\nof Morgan, be convinced that the PTO was wrong?\nMR. PANNER: As section -- as I say, the\nlanguage of Morgan deals with the circumstance in which\nthere's a challenge to the validity of an issued patent.\nThe action that was at issue, the action as to which the\nvalidity was being challenged, was not the denial of the\npatent to the applicant; it was the fact that the PTO\nhad issued a patent to the defendant in that case. And\nso, there was a collateral attack, effectively a\ncollateral challenge to the validity of that issued\npatent. And that's why Radio Corporation of America\ncites Morgan, and that's how, you know, it's relevant to\nthe -- this Court's, you know, decision in Microsoft,\nthat the statutory presumption of validity carries this\nheightened standard of proof.\nJUSTICE BREYER: My goodness. Suppose\nyou're a lawyer, back to the Chief Justice's question,\nas you are, and you have the client there, and you're\nthinking, you know, if he puts all his evidence before\nthe PTO, and they say no, we've had it. I mean, there\nwe are. But if we hold back something, well, then we're\ngoing to get not -- get de novo review and a district\ncourt. Boy! But if we're too obvious about holding\nback something, we run into the estoppel rule.\nMy goodness. You're -- you're in a mess, it\nseems to me, trying to advise a client what to do in\nthat situation. Better not say hold something back; on\nthe other hand, if he does he's pretty -- how do you\ndeal -- you see?\nMR. PANNER: I think the -- I understand the\nconcern, but the practicalities of patent prosecution\npractice are that no applicant would hold back evidence\nin an effort to -- to produce that sort of tactical\nadvantage because once --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because -- I'm\nsorry. Go ahead.\nMR. PANNER: I think because it's -- it's\nfrankly more straightforward and easier to try to meet\nthose objections in the Office. That's what usually\nhappens, is that there's a dialogue with the examiner to\ntry to meet the grounds for rejection.\nOne of the things that I think is important\nto take into account with respect to the context of this\ncase is there were a vast number of rejections. There\nwas not just a rejection on written-description and\nenablement grounds, but there were rejections for double\npatentings; there were rejections for anticipation;\nthere were rejections for obviousness. And every single\none -- every single one -- of those grounds for\nrejection was overcome in the appeal before the Board.\nAnd many of the written-description rejections were\novercome in the appeal before the Board. And at -- with\nrespect to every one, if one goes back and reads the\nexaminer's decision, the examiner did provide an\nexplanation as to what was lacking with respect to\ncertain -- certain elements of the claimed invention,\nand with respect to every single one of those, the Board\nreversed.\nSo, where the applicant was provided a fair\nopportunity to try to meet the concerns, the applicant\ndid so, and the Board ruled in his favor. And he again\nattempted -- there's no question of sandbagging here.\nThe -- the applicant brought these arguments to the\nBoard in the rehearing petition, in the request for\nrehearing, and said here's my answer to your more\nfocused explanation. And they -- they refused to hear\nit.\nSo, as a practical matter, I think that --\nand you don't have to take my word for it, again,\nbecause this procedure has been in place for so long,\nand problems have not arisen. And even if there were\nuncertainty as to what the precise standard for\nadmissibility was, the applicants would have every\nreason to test that and to -- to try to do something\nalong that line if that were a realistic option and\nfavorable.\nThe fact of the matter is that that has not\nhappened because the applicants have every reason in the\nworld to pursue the application with vigor before the\nOffice. And the Federal Circuit, which, of course, is\nmore familiar with the -- the patent application process\nthan any other court, had no concerns that the rule that\nthey were adopting would lead to abuses.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess, as a\npractical matter, these things all end up before the\nFederal Circuit anyway, right?\nMR. PANNER: That's right, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I suppose that\n-- if you had the same case and one is coming up under\nthe 141 and the other under 145, I suppose it's\ntheoretically possible they could reach different\nresults because of different standards of review.\nMR. PANNER: Well, Your Honor, you can't do\nboth.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. I know.\nI'm not saying -- the point is that although they all\ncome before the Federal Circuit, they may come to them\nin a very different posture that would cause the Federal\nCircuit to rule differently if you had the same case\nunder one and under the other.\nMR. PANNER: Well, Your Honor, I -- it\nwouldn't be on the same record.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMR. PANNER: If it were on the same record,\nthen presumably the -- the issue that would be presented\nwould be quite similar. The only time I can see that --\nso, in other words, if there were a different record,\nit's true that the Federal Circuit's review of the\ndistrict decision would be -- it would be the difference\nthat this Court recognized in Zurko. It would be the\ncourt/court standard of review, which is -- gives\nperhaps slightly less weight to the decision of the\ndistrict court than the court/agency review. But that\ndoesn't seem like an advantage. In the -- in a\ncircumstance at least where an applicant has prevailed,\nthe applicant would be more likely to see the victory\ntaken away by the Federal Circuit.\nUnless the Court has questions.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Panner.\nMs. Anders, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. ANDERS: Thank you.\nThis is an action for judicial review of\nagency determination. This is an action that -- that\nrequires the patent applicant to -- to seek a property\nright from the agency, to have it denied, and to\nchallenge that in court. And as a result, this Court\nsaid in Zurko that this is review of an agency\ndetermination, and, therefore, Morgan's deferential\nstandard should be carried forward into the APA.\nAnd in construing Morgan, the Court in Zurko\ndid not consider that it was -- whether a property right\nhad been awarded or not; it was simply that the agency\nhad made a determination in its expertise. And I think\nthat goes to why it would not be sufficient for the\ncourt simply to weigh the evidence differently. In\nevery other agency -- judicial review proceeding of\nagency action, the rule is that the agency is the\nprimary decisionmaker. The agency has to consider the\nevidence first and make a determination. That aids\njudicial review. It allows the agency to apply its\nexpertise. And we generally don't think of the court as\nbeing the one who should make the first determination on\nissues of fact. And that's particularly --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but you have a strange\nstatute here. I don't know any statute that -- that\nreads this way. \"As the facts\" -- \"as the facts\" --\nwhere is it? \"As the facts may\" --\nMS. ANDERS: Yes. \"As the facts\" --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: \"As the facts in the case\nmay appear.\" That's --\nMS. ANDERS: Well, that language was in the\nstatute in Morgan when the Court construed this as\njudicial review. And I think that -- there would have\nto be a compelling reason in order to interpret the\nstatute to permit an -- to permit the applicant to\nintroduce evidence that he failed without cause, without\njustification, to provide to the agency.\nAnd I don't think that Mr. Hyatt has shown\nany such justification. And --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, but I guess the\ncompelling reason is the statutory language and\nespecially with respect to the admissibility of evidence\nquestion. I mean, it -- the standard that you suggest\njust can't be derived from the statutory language; isn't\nthat right?\nMS. ANDERS: Well, I think certainly there's\nan exhaustion requirement within the statute. The Board\nhas to have considered the application. And, therefore,\nit would make no sense to have the Board consider the\napplication if it didn't have to consider all of the\nevidence that was provided.\nSo, I think in that sense, you know, the\nstandard that the Federal Circuit put in place and that\nMr. Hyatt is proposing really is providing --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, why didn't the court\njust say what you said? If it -- if -- not the court;\nCongress. If you admit that Congress intended a section\n145 action to permit new evidence, if it wanted to limit\nthat evidence to something that could not have been\nfound with due diligence or whatever your limitations\nare, why did it speak more broadly? I mean, the\nstatutory language suggests \"as the facts in this case,\"\nnot in the case before the PTO. As law and -- \"as\nequity might permit.\"\nThis is very broad language.\nMS. ANDERS: Well -- so, the language could\nbe taken to suggest that some new evidence is\nadmissible, but I think then we look to the fact that\nthis -- just like section 141 is a judicial review\nproceeding, and there should have to be compelling\nreason before we deviate from the normal deferential\nstandards that apply when a -- when a court is reviewing\nan agency's determination.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
