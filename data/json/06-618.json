MANNING\nON BEHALF OF APPELLANT\nMS. MANNING: Justice Stevens and may it\nplease the Court:\nIf I may, I would like to quickly frame the\nmerits of the case and then turn to the jurisdictional\nissue. In United States vs. Gravel this Court\nrecognized that members of Congress have to delegate\nsome of their legislative authority to employees and\nthese employees are a second self to the member. They\nare performing some of the legislative duties the member\nhimself would otherwise perform. Therefore, they are an\nintegral part of the legislative process of the member's\noffice. For that reason, the member must have absolute\ntrust and confidence that these employees are in fact\nperforming as his second self, and to do that the member\nhas to have complete discretion in selecting who these\nemployees are and in managing them.\nIf a court oversees a member's selection of\nthese employees and his management of these employees,\nthen the court and not the member is managing part of\nhis legislative process and that is a violation of the\nSpeech or Debate Clause because the purpose of the\nclause is to ensure that the legislative process will be\nperformed independently. Now --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you think -- do you\nthink that we owe any special measure of respect to the\nCongress, that is most intimately concerned with the\nSpeech or Debate Clause, with their view that this is,\nthis legislation is compatible with that clause?\nMS. MANNING: I do not, Justice Ginsburg.\nThis Court has never deferred to Congress with respect\nto its interpretation and in fact has disagreed with\nCongress, for example, in the Gravel case. But the\nother reason is that the Congress of course is a\npolitical body and because of that it will make\ndecisions that are politically expedient at times, which\nmeans that over time their decisions can change, while\nthe Court is uniquely designed and intended to decide\ncases on something other than what is politically\nexpedient. This is especially important when we are\ndealing with the Constitution and interpreting the\nConstitution.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But what we are involved\nwith in this case is Congress subjecting itself to the\nlaws that govern all other employers.\nMS. MANNING: It did, Justice Ginsburg,\nsubject itself, but it also in Section 413 recognized\nthat there may be Speech or Debate Clause issues and\nmaybe not all of these cases can be adjudicated in a\ncourt. Not that they can't be adjudicated, but maybe\nnot in a court. So while subjecting itself to the law\nand doing the best it could to do that, it also cannot\ntrump the Constitution.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which is what the statute\nsays, and so how could the statute possibly be\nunconstitutional?\nMS. MANNING: We are not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, the Constitution --\nI mean, the statute has within itself a Speech or Debate\nClause exception. Now, I guess you can argue that a\nlower court might not accurately provide the Speech or\nDebate Clause protection that is due, but that, that\ndoesn't meet, it seems to me, the, the jurisdictional\nrequirement that, that the constitutionality of the\nstatute be called into question.\nMS. MANNING: Well, Justice Scalia, we are\nnot arguing that the statute is unconstitutional.\nRather, it's an as-applied argument. What we are\narguing is that the issue that was before the circuit\ncourt was whether the application of Section 408 to this\nparticular case -- and of course 408 is what gives the\nCourt jurisdiction -- whether applying that to this case\nviolates the Constitution.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that doesn't comply\nwith Section 412, which says that an appeal may be taken\ndirectly to the Supreme Court from \"any interlocutory or\nfinal judgment decree of order of court upon the\nconstitutionality of any provision of the Act.\" Now,\nand as-applied challenge is not a challenge to the\nconstitutionality of the provision.\nMS. MANNING: Justice Scalia, in the United\nStates versus Eichman, that statute at issue there had\nstatutory direct appeal language that was exactly the\nlanguage of 412.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't there a further\nproblem here, though, that the order of the district\ncourt gave no explanation? We have no way of knowing\nexactly why the court ruled the way it did, and for that\nreason the appeal, the review, was that the original\nappeal was taken properly to the court of appeals, so\nthat we are here not on appellate jurisdiction, but cert\njurisdiction, if at all.\nMS. MANNING: I believe that you can take\nappellate jurisdiction of this case because, as I was\nsaying, in United --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, there'S no direct\nappeal. We have appellate jurisdiction only if there's\na direct appeal and there's no direct appeal. This is\ncoming from the court of appeals.\nMS. MANNING: Oh, Section 412 provides\ndirect appeal from either court, unlike the Flag\nProtection Act direct appeal language, which must be\nfrom the district court. Section 412 doesn't limit it\nto an appeal from the district court. It can be either\none.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What pages are the text of\n412 set out on? You're going to have to help me here.\nMS. MANNING: I'm sorry. With respect to --\nit's at the jurisdictional statement at page 65a. And\nthe direct appellate language that was at issue in the\nFlag Protection Act did limit the appeal to appeals from\nthe district court. But Section 412 is different from\nthat. It doesn't --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, why wasn't the ruling\nof the district court a ruling upon the\nconstitutionality of the statute as applied? As I\nunderstand it, you moved to dismiss the case on the\nground that an individual performing the duties that\nMr. Dayton performed cannot sue a member of Congress for\nemployment discrimination and the district court denied\nthat. Why isn't that a ruling on the constitutionality\nof the, of the statute as applied?\nMS. MANNING: Well, Justice Alito, the\nargument we made was that to reach that decision there\nwere a couple of sub-arguments the court had to reach.\nWe had argued that, number one, is there a waiver of\nsovereign immunity? If not, then is an employee who\nmeets the I'll call the duties test that we've set out\nin our brief, is that employee's claim jurisdictionally\nbarred from court review, and if so does Mr. Hanson meet\nthat duties test? Now, the court could have decided\nthat Mr. Hanson doesn't meet the duties test, therefore\nwe never have to reach the constitutional issue, and\nthat would have been a decision on his duties, not on\nthe Constitution.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Was there a dispute about\nthe nature of his duties?\nMS. MANNING: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE ALITO: Not how you characterize his\nduties, but what his duties actually were. Was there a\ndispute about that?\nMS. MANNING: He did not dispute his duties.\nWhat he disputed was -- what he said was that of the\nduties we set forth in the affidavit -- and that was\nMr. Kimball's declaration, which is at the\njurisdictional statement at 66a -- he said that they\nrepresent only 5 percent of his legislative duties over\nthe course of his employment. Well, of course, we're\nnot setting forth every jurisdictional duty he had over\nthe course of his employment. So he --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But didn't the district\ncourt rule that somebody performing those duties can\nconstitutionally be tried -- bring suit, and it doesn't,\nand it doesn't violate the Speech or Debate Clause? So\nI don't see how that's not a ruling on the\nconstitutionality of the statute as applied.\nMS. MANNING: No, Justice Alito, the court\ndidn't rule that. The court just gave us a minute\norder, and there's a possibility that it ruled that, but\nthere is a possibility that it just said it doesn't\nmatter what test you're telling me, counsel, because\nthis particular employee doesn't meet your test to begin\nwith. So I'm saying, the court could have said, I'm\nsaying he doesn't meet --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Don't you agree with\nJustice Scalia -- Justice Alito? Don't you agree with\nJustice Alito? I thought he's saying it's a ruling on\nconstitutionality.\nMS. MANNING: It is a -- not the district\ncourt ruling. Not the district court. The appellate\ncourt, yes. I'm sorry, Justice Breyer. The appellate\ncourt, yes; the district court, no, because the district\ncourt was merely a minute order. And it's a possibility\nthat it could have been unconstitutional and a\npossibility it could not.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I see.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: My problem is, it's\nextraordinary. We have very few direct appeal cases any\nmore and I, I am loathe to read Section 412 as embracing\na decision by a court that a particular use of this\nstatute was unconstitutional. You say it was, the\nstatute was unconstitutional as applied. That's sloppy\nlanguage. It really means that this application of the\nstatute or the use of the statute for this purpose was\nunconstitutional.\nI think that's something different from\nsaying that it was an order of the court upon the\nconstitutionality of any provision. Which provision of\nthis Act has been held to be unconstitutional?\nMS. MANNING: Section 408 as applied to this\ncase is unconstitutional.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which -- but it hasn't been\nheld to be unconstitutional. It's perfectly\nconstitutional. You're just saying it can't be used in\nthis particular case.\nMS. MANNING: Well, when Congress --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, read the language.\nIt says \"The constitutionality of any provision of this\nact,\" not \"the constitutionality of the application of\nany provision of this act.\"\nMS. MANNING: Yes, and in United States\nversus Eichman, Justice Scalia, the very same language\nwas at issue.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What is that citation? I\nwas looking for that. Is that cited in your brief?\nMS. MANNING: Yes, United States versus\nEichman is cited at the Appellant's reply brief at page\n1.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Thank you.\nMS. MANNING: And the statutory section is\n18 U.S.C. Section 700(d), and the direct appeal language\nis exactly the same, \"upon the constitutionality of a\nprovision of this act.\" And this Court accepted direct\nappeal when the issue was whether the application of the\nFlag Protection Act was unconstitutional. In any event,\neven if this Court were not to take jurisdiction --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But in the flag case the\nwhole statute was either valid or not. There weren't\ndifferent applications, were there?\nMS. MANNING: Counsel argued both, but this\nCourt did not deal with both. This Court actually took\ndirect appeal just on the as-applied argument. Counsel\nargued the statute was unconstitutional and the second\nargument was --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You mean we held that the\nstatute was constitutional on its face?\nMS. MANNING: What the Court held was --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'll look at Eichman, but\nit's not my recollection of the case, that the whole,\nthe essence of the duty imposed by, under the statute\nwas held.\nMS. MANNING: It was the application in that\nparticular situation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but there's always\nan application or there's no case.\nMS. MANNING: Well, the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Absent some declaratory\njudgment provision.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We simply didn't rule hold\nwas a right to burn flags in some cases and not others.\nMS. MANNING: Well, there were questions\nthat the parties raised. One was, is the statute\nunconstitutional altogether. And the Court didn't even\ntouch that. Instead the second argument they raised was\nwell, is it constitutional -- unconstitutional, rather,\nas applied on these facts? And that is what the Court\ntook the case on, that was what allowed direct\njurisdiction.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what had the lower\ncourt held? It isn't a question of what we held; it's a\nquestion of what the lower court had held. Had the\nlower court held that it was unconstitutional?\nMS. MANNING: I'm sorry, Justice Scalia, I\ndon't remember what the lower court held in that case --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, but that can mean\n-- you can always dispose of a, of a facial challenge by\njust saying we don't have to reach the facial question;\nwe can decide it on an as applied question. But in\norder to get here in the first place, it has to be a\nchallenge to the constitutionality of a provision of the\nAct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And in we recite that the\ndistrict court held the Act unconstitutional as applied\nto appellees and dismissed the charges.\nMS. MANNING: Right. Unconstitutional as\napplied so it was an as applied argument. And now when\nthe Court wants a statute to mean that it's only an\nunconstitutional interpretation as opposed to a\nconstitutional interpretation, the Court -- I'm sorry,\nCongress makes that distinction. So for example in 28\nU.S.C. Section 1257, which was a direct appeals statute,\nand has since been repealed, in that statute Congress\ndid say that there is direct appeal when the statute is\nfound to be constitutional, or when the statute is found\nto be unconstitutional. But it used -- Congress, that\nis, used the vague language, more vague and general\nlanguage in Section 412, which is just upon the\nconstitutionality. In any event --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I realize, before you leave\nthat I realize that on a jurisdictional issue like that\nwe have an obligation to raise it ourselves. But I'm --\nI'm -- I'm curious, was -- was jurisdiction contested in\nthat case?\nMS. MANNING: Not that I recall in the\nEichman case. Not that I recall.\nJUSTICE SOUTER:\nMS. MANNING: Okay. In any case, this Court\nshould accept the petition, take this case on a petition\nfor writ because the decision of the court of appeals\nwas upon a question of Federal law that is an important\nquestion.\nMoving to my Speech or Debate Clause\nargument, with respect to Speech or Debate Clause, this\nCourt has held that all acts that are within the\nlegitimate legislative sphere are protected by Speech or\nDebate Clause immunity. And the Court has defined what\nis inside that sphere as anything that is part of the\ndue functioning of the legislative process. And when an\nemployee is an alter ego, that is, a second self of a\nmember, that employee by definition is actually\nperforming part of the member's job. He is performing\nlegislative acts so he is in this sphere. He is doing\nsomething that is part of the due functioning of the\nlegislative process. He is in that sphere.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What does he do? I mean I\nlooked at what he does in 74, 75, 76a. He seems to\nspend a lot of time moving furniture. He lists that\ntwice. He runs the office. And he represents, he is\nout in the local office somewhere and he talks to\nconstituents. I mean, he doesn't even appear in the\nSenate office except very rarely in which case he is\ndoing casework. So I guess if he is included in that, I\nmean so is a full-time furniture mover.\nMS. MANNING: Justice Breyer, he did\nsignificantly more than that. First --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I have the whole list here.\nWhat here suggests, he ever -- he doesn't even write a\nstatement for the floor. There is nothing here that\nsuggests one word of anything he did ever went to a\ncommittee meeting, to a floor of the Senate, anything.\nMS. MANNING: Oh, Justice --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What?\nMS. MANNING: Justice Breyer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What are the words?\nMS. MANNING: Actually in the Kimball\ndeclaration, which is at jurisdictional statement 66a,\nand the self evaluation of Mr. Hanson which is attached\nthereto as a jurisdictional statement at 78a, and this\nis his self evaluation and Mr. Kimball, his supervisor\nat the time telling what he had done, he being\nMr. Hanson.\nSome of the things Mr. Hanson did was he did\ntalk to constituents, but remember of course the member\nis in D.C.; he is supposed to be representing people in\nthe State. The very people who have contact with --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I agree with that one. I\njust said he doesn't do anything that gets to the floor\nof the Senate, that gets to a committee report, that\ngets to a committee hearing. Now what in there -- and\nyou said it was not contested, so I guess the best\nsource if it's not contested is his affidavit.\nMS. MANNING: Justice Breyer actually he did\nboth of those. He for example, when talking to the\nconstituents realized that there was a problem with\nrespect to ambulance reimbursement for health care. He\nwent to the Senator and said we've got a problem here in\nthe State, and the constituents have identified it. He\nthen said to the Senator, I think you should draft\nlegislation on this and I think you should have a\ncommittee hearing on this. Both of which the Senator\ndid. Mr. Hanson drafted that legislation. He --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh. Where does it say\nthat? He drafted legislation that was then introduced?\nMS. MANNING: Yes, he did. He drafted --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Where does it say that?\nMS. MANNING: That is in the Kimball\ndeclaration which is jurisdictional statements at page\n66a. And he also prepared the witnesses for the\nhearings. Justice -- I'm sorry, Senator Dayton had the\nhearing on the health care issue, and Mr. Hanson\nidentified the witnesses for that, prepared them, wrote\nthe questions for the hearing and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, he didn't do\nexclusively that stuff anyway. We can certainly all\nagree on that. And why isn't it sufficient that when\nany of those issues are, his activities in any of those\ncapacities are sought to be introduced into evidence,\nanyone tries to contradict them, then you can bring in\nyour Speech or Debate Clause objection?\nMS. MANNING: Because it is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why is the whole suit\nprecluded?\nMS. MANNING: The whole suit is precluded\nbecause when you have as we do an employee who is in\nthis legislative sphere, that the Court has identified,\nhe is in that sphere because he is performing\nlegislative acts. So a member who decides, you know, I\ndon't want him in my legislative duties anymore, my\nsphere, I'm pulling him out. Taking him out, when the\nmember takes him out of that process, he has done\nsomething -- he being the member -- that is also part of\nthe functioning of the legislative process, which is the\ntest.\nSo the termination itself is part of the\nfunctioning of the legislative process which is the test\nfor a legislative act. And therefore this case is\npredicated on a legislative act. That is, the\ntermination. And in Doe V. McMillan this Court stated\nthat a case that is predicated on a legislative cannot\nbe adjudicated.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm puzzled. Firing\nsomebody is a legislative act?\nMS. MANNING: I'm sorry, Justice Stevens?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Firing someone is a\nlegislative act?\nMS. MANNING: Firing not anyone is a\nlegislative act, but firing your second self is a\nlegislative act. And the reason for that is that you\nare doing something that is part of your legislative\nprocess. You created a hole in your legislative\nprocess; you have taken out an employee who is your\nsecond self. This is your second self. And you've\ndecided, you know, I think my legislative process is\ngoing to work better with him gone.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's part of -- how many\nsecond selves would there be?\n(Laughter.)\nMS. MANNING: I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: On the Senator's staff?\nMS. MANNING: I'm sorry. I still didn't\nhear.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How many second selves?\nOf -- what universe are you covering? Who is not a\nsecond self, who works in a Senator's office?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe he was the 23rd self.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think you have to figure\nout when he was hired.\nMS. MANNING: Well, in Gravel, in United\nStates vs. Gravel, this Court stated not only do you\nhave second selves, but you must -- members must\ndelegate and redelegate and redelegate authority. That\nimplies there are a lot of second selves. It's not one\nperson. So there can be --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's wrong with this? I\nfound what you're talking about here. It says in\nparagraph 13, contrary to what he says in his own\nevaluation, that Senator Dayton's staff, including\nMr. Hanson -- that's a little uncertain, what they mean\nby that -- introduced a bill and drafted it. Okay? And\nthen on paragraph 14 they say on November 15th, 2001,\nMr. Hanson -- just as you said -- planned a Senate\nGovernment Affairs Committee meeting, selected hearing\nwitnesses and prepared questions.\nNow suppose that we did as the court, lower\ncourt wanted to do, say let's just see if that becomes\nrelevant. Because it's possible, given his other tasks\nthat those two incidents, one on November 15th and the\nother, whenever help he gave to the drafting, had\nnothing to do with his being fired and nobody claims\nthat. So what they said is let's wait and see if that\nbecomes relevant. Now what's wrong with that solution?\nMS. MANNING: What's wrong with that\nsolution is that when a member, as I was explaining in\nresponse to Justice Stevens' questions, when a member\nhas a second self who is in the legislative process and\nthe member says you know, I'm pulling him out of the\nprocess because he doesn't perform well, he -- I don't\nthink he is my second self, that termination for\nwhatever reason is part of the process because the\nmember has changed the process.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Let's make an\nabsurd case out of it which I'm trying to do a little\nbit to get you to focus on it. Let's suppose he got\nfired because he didn't move the furniture properly.\nMS. MANNING: The -- it is a whole employee.\nWhen he is removed from the process for whatever reason,\nhe is gone from the process so that is part of the\nfunctioning of the process. If I may give an example,\nlet's say that the Senator is at Union Station and he is\nbuying a gift for someone and he hears someone making\nvery derogatory statements to the cashier, and he turns\naround and lo and behold, this is his legislative\ndirector. And he says I can't have this person as my\nsecond self; I don't talk to individuals that way; this\nhas nothing to do with my legislative process but this\nis a second self and he is not my second self and I pull\nhim out of the process.\nThat has affected his legislative process.\nHe now has a hole in this sphere, this legislative\nsphere. The person is gone. That is a part of his\nlegislative process. He didn't matter, why he is gone.\nHe is gone.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Isn't that a -- can you\ngive me examples of cases where that Act applies?\nMS. MANNING: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you give me instances\nin which employees of an the office of a Senator are\ncovered by these obligations and cannot invoke the\nSpeech or Debate Clause? What's the classic example\nwhere you can't invoke the Speech or Debate Clause?\nMS. MANNING: Where you cannot invoke the\nSpeech or Debate Clause.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yeah.\nMS. MANNING: Was that the question, or can?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. Because it seems to\nme that your argument just completely eviscerates the\nintent of the Congress in passing this Act.\nMS. MANNING: If I may answer the second\nquestion first, approximately 75 percent of the people\nwho are covered by this Act, the employees who are\ncovered by this Act are not employed by members of\nCongress or committees. Now those employees for the\nmost part -- and not all of them, because some of those\nemployees do work on the floor, but for the most part --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, except the Act\nitself has a provision for office of Senators.\nMS. MANNING: And those employees --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And so it seems to me\nyou're giving no effect to that. You say there is a\nhole in the process the minute the furniture mover is\ngone?\nMS. MANNING: No, Justice Kennedy, those\nemployees -- first of all some of those employees can\nsue. For example the Court has said that writing news\nreleases or newsletters to constituents, this is in the\nBrewster case, are not, that is not a legislative act.\nSo if we have an employee in a member's office like the\ndeputy press secretary who does those kind of things,\nthat person is not performing legislative acts. But in\naddition to that these employees still have a -- a\nforum; their forum is the Office of Compliance, which is\nunique to the Congressional Accountability Act. And the\nOffice of Compliance has cases heard before retired\njudges; the employees get the same remedies as they\nwould in court. It is the same procedure except that it\nis an expedited procedure and it is a confidential\nprocedure.\nSo these employees are, it's not that they\ncan't sue; it's that they cannot sue in Federal court.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If this statute --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Wouldn't they get into --\nno, you.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If this statute was set up\nso that the defendant here was the Senate, as opposed to\nthe office of a Senator, would you still say that this\nsuit couldn't go forward?\nMS. MANNING: With respect to the abatement\nissue, I would -- this is with respect to the abatement\nissue -- I would say that the case would not be abated,\nbecause the defendant would still exist. But with\nrespect to the Speech or Debate Clause issue I would say\nit could not still go forward, and the reason for that\nis the immunity is, as this Court stated in Gravel, is\nnot like a badge that attaches to different people and\ndifferent entities. It's an expression of a policy,\nwhich means that whenever a case is going to infringe\ninto this legislative sphere, irrespective of who the\ndefendant is, then the case could not be adjudicated in\na Federal court.\nAnd so for example in Eastland versus\nServicemen's Fund this Court stated that a committee of\nthe Senate is covered by the Speech or Debate Clause.\nAnd in Tenney although that was a State case, the Court\ndid apply the Speech or Debate Clause jurisprudence.\nThe Court there said that a committee of the State is\ncovered by the Speech or Debate Clause and the case\nwould be dismissed.\nAnd then in Doe vs. McMillan, in that case\nthere was a consultant to Congress and he was sued.\nThere was functionaries of Congress that did not work\nfor a member, did not work for a committee and the Court\nheld in that case that if those, if the consultant and\nthe functionaries were performing duties that were\nwithin this legislative sphere, the Speech or Debate\nClause clause applies and the case was dismissed.\nJUSTICE ALITO: In what sense would the\nmember be called to answer under those circumstances, if\nthe member isn't a defendant and has no financial\nliability and is able to invoke the clause as an\nevidentiary privilege? In what sense would the Speech\nor Debate Clause be applicable?\nMS. MANNING: In the scenario where the\nCongress is the defendant?\nJUSTICE ALITO: Yes.\nMS. MANNING: Well, what we are arguing is\nthat the termination itself, the termination itself is a\nlegislative act because the termination itself is part\nof the due functioning of the legislative process. And\nin Doe V. McMillan the Court stated that when a case is\npredicated on a legislative act, court jurisdiction is\nbarred. Now also in answer to your question it doesn't\nmatter who the defendant is. The member, let's say\nCongress was --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well why doesn't it matter\nwho the defendant is? Because I don't, this so-called\noffice of Senator Mark Dayton is a construct that I\nunderstand, and there is no immunity problem there. But\nif, if that office is gone now and getting to your\nhypothesis, if the, if -- if the true party is the\nSenate of the United States, has there been any\nunequivocal waiver of immunity with respect to the\nentire Senator or the Senate of the United States as an\ninstitution?\nMS. MANNING: No Justice Ginsburg, there has\nbeen no waiver --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm Justice Souter.\nMS. MANNING: I'm sorry. Justice Souter,\nsorry. Justice Souter --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You're very flattering.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. MANNING: Sorry. Justice Souter, sorry,\nJustice Souter.\nThere has been no waiver for the Senate as a\ndefendant. Section 1408 of the CAA which of course\ngives the Court jurisdiction --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but I was just going\nto say if this case continues we've got to accept the\nproposition that the Office of Senator Mark Dayton is\nstill a, some kind of an entity that has got to be\naccorded reality by the judiciary, right.\nMS. MANNING: That is correct, because --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And how do we do it? I\nmean, you've said -- I don't want to go too far with a\nmetaphor, but you spoke a moment ago of there being sort\nof a, what did you say, a hole or a space in the\nlegislative sphere when somebody is fired. In the\nsphere at the moment is totally empty. The Senator's\ngone. Everybody knows that this, this office of Senator\nMark Dayton is a totally fictional construct. And in\nreality, as you point out, the money is going to come\nout of the Senate or some Senate fund. If we allow this\nto go forward, we've got to face the reality that it's\nthe Senate which is the defendant and there hasn't been\na waiver of immunity.\nMS. MANNING: I agree with that, Justice\nSouter. There is no defendant that exists any more.\nThe only defendant in the CAA, and the language is very\nexpress, is the employing office and the employing\noffice is defined in Section 1301(9) as, for purposes of\nthis case, \"the personal office of a member of\nCongress.\" And there is no member of Congress --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but at this point\nthat's silly. There's no Senator. There's no office in\nany sense.\nMS. MANNING: I agree with you that there is\nno defendant any more. This defendant has ceased to\nexist and this case has abated. There is no successor\nand when there is no successor there are not two\nadversarial parties in the case. There's no case or\ncontroversy, case is moot, and the case should be\ndismissed on that basis alone.\nWhy -- the Court does not even have to reach\nthe jurisdictional issue with respect to the Speech or\nDebate Clause because this case became moot in January\nwhen the function of the office, which was solely to\nsupport Senator Dayton -- when there was no Senator\nDayton there was no office of Senator Dayton. There is\nno defendant that is extant in this case and therefore\nthe case --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There's never an office. I\nmean, I think the office is just a fictional construct\nanyway. So what you say now has nothing to do with\nwhether, whether this current Senator has, has departed\nfrom the scene. Even if he were still on the scene,\nthere still wouldn't be any such thing as that office.\nIt's just a fiction, and it would always be a suit\nagainst Congress, and so you say none of these suits can\never be brought.\nMS. MANNING: Justice Scalia, it is not just\na fiction. The office --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't it a waiver of\nsovereign immunity when you set up a suit that envisions\na suit which will be paid off by the Senate? Why isn't\nthat a waiver of sovereign immunity?\nMS. MANNING: It is, Justice Scalia, a\nwaiver of sovereign immunity that has a condition on it.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is it unequivocal?\nMS. MANNING: It is unequivocal --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, when it's done on\nthe basis of this fiction, is that what we should accept\nas an unequivocal waiver?\nMS. MANNING: Well, first, I disagree with\nthe premise in that I don't think it is a fiction that\nthis office never existed. The office, the personal\noffice of a member of Congress -- members of Congress\ndidn't work out in the hallway before the CAA was\npassed. There was always a personal office of a member\nof Congress. So in that sense it is not a fiction.\nI would like to reserve the balance of my\ntime.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A physical, a physical\noffice, yes. I mean, they didn't work in the hallway.\nBut their staff salary was not paid out of their, quote,\n\"office.\" It was paid out of the Senate.\nMS. MANNING: Well, actually the structure\ndoesn't support that. The Senate, within the Senate,\neach member does pay the salary, sets the salary. We\ncan have legislative directors and do have legislative\ndirectors in two different offices, different salaries,\ndifferent numbers of paid days, different number of\nannual leave days.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Setting it is quite\ndifferent from paying it.\nMS. MANNING: It is paid for --\nJUSTICE SCALIA : The Senator sets it and\nthe Senate pays it.\nMS. MANNING: Justice Scalia, actually the\nSenate is given an appropriation and all of his salaries\nmust be paid from the appropriation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right. The Senate puts a\nlimit on how much money it will spend for a particular\nSenator. That's all that amounts to. It doesn't hand\nhim the money. It's still the Senate's money, isn't it?\nAnd what the Senate says is each office will have so\nmuch of a call upon our fund and no more.\nMS. MANNING: It is the appropriated fund\nfor the Senator and the Senator is the one who pays the\nfund.\nIf I may, I'd like to reserve the rest of my\ntime.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Salzman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. SALZMAN\nON BEHALF OF APPELLEE\nMR. SALZMAN: Justice Stevens and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe motion to dismiss in this case raised a\nsingle issue, the issue of absolute immunity; more\nspecifically, whether the employing office created by\nCongress as the defendant in these kinds of cases can be\nsued by a member of a Senator or a House of\nRepresentatives staff. The Dayton office argues that a\nSenator's personnel decisions are always a legislative\nact that are always absolutely immunized by the Speech\nor Debate Clause. That argument is untenable and it was\nrejected by every one of the eight judges of the D.C.\nCircuit en banc.\nThis case doesn't involve any administrative\nacts. Mr. Hanson didn't work on Capitol Hill. He was\nin the Minnesota office. His, the nature of his claim\nis that he was a valued employee until he became ill and\ndisclosed his illness and need for surgery, at which\npoint he was fired. Senator Dayton's office first says\nthat they were not even aware, that Senator Dayton was\nunaware of the need for surgery at the time he made the\ndecision to fire Mr. Hanson, and then says that the\nreason for the firing was Mr. Hanson's work on a classic\nconstituent service.\nThis case presents exactly the hypothetical\nthat Justice Breyer was asking about. Although\nMr. Hanson had a very small, he says 5 percent of his\nduties, that were in some way related to the legislative\nprocess, no one contends, not Mr. Kimball, not Senator\nDayton's office, that that had anything to do with the\nreason for his firing. In fact, the only evidence in\nthe record, in this record so far, is that on that small\namount of work that Mr. Hanson did with respect to\nambulance legislation, he did a, quote unquote, \"great\njob.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The other side's contention\nis that the firing is itself a legislative act and so\nwhen you challenge the firing you are challenging the\nlegislative act. What do you say to that?\nMR. SALZMAN: We say that's absolutely wrong\nJustice Scalia, that is absolutely wrong. The reason is\nthat this Court has said that conduct that is related to\nthe legislative process, that may in fact be important\nto the legislative process, is not itself a part of the\nlegislative process. That is the fundamental holding of\nBrewster. And this Court has found that some actions\nthat affect an employee, for example in the Bogan case,\nwhere a decision that resulted in the termination of a\nperson was clearly legislative in nature because it was\nmade in a legislative proceeding, it was voted upon by\nthe legislators, and it was based upon either budgetary\nor policy determinations.\nThat is a legislative act. But this Court\nin Bogan specifically distinguished that circumstance\nfrom a classic personnel action firing such as happened\nto Mr. Hanson here. There was no legislative act\ninvolved in Mr. Hanson's firing. He was just fired.\nThe reason for the firing is at issue in this case. A\njury can sort out issues like whether or not Senator\nDayton had notice of the need for surgery, whether or\nnot Mr. Hanson's performance of classic constituent\nservices was bad or good, as we contend.\nBut none of that involves legislative\nactivity as this Court has described it under the speech\nor debate act. So our contention is that the only issue\nin this case is absolute immunity and there is no\nabsolute immunity in this case. This case does not\ninvolve a legislative act, as Judge Randolph below and\nall of the judges below recognized.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What if his dissent -- or\ndefense, rather, to the charge is that he was very\ninefficient in giving me help in legislative hearings\nand so forth, or words of that kind which might be\narguably a legislative act, and that Speech or Debate\nClause forbids inquiry into the quality of his\nperforming those duties?\nMR. SALZMAN: Justice Stevens, certainly the\nSpeech or Debate Clause does incorporate -- I'm sorry.\nThe Congressional Accountability Act does incorporate\nthe Speech or Debate Clause with respect to the\nevidentiary privilege and that is clear from Section\n413. In that instance, district courts will have to\ndeal with the proffered evidence on a case-by-case\nbasis. Obviously, the context matters with respect to\nany evidentiary privilege.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But maybe the Senator\nmight argue that this is all privileged: It's the\nreason I fired him, but I can't go into it because I\ndon't want to invade my own privilege not to discuss\nmatters that are covered by the immunity.\nMR. SALZMAN: Well, Justice Stevens, again\nif the reason for the firing would shed light if the\ndistrict court would show that the allowing the evidence\nthat is proffered in would so intrude upon a real\nlegislative act, then the district court can excise that\nevidence from the case. It either can be taken out, as\nin the Helstoski case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What's the test for\nintruding? If it would chill his exercise of the\nfunction in future cases, or if it requires him to talk\nabout legislative decisions, or what?\nMR. SALZMAN: I think, as this Court has\ndescribed it, Justice Kennedy, if it would compel the\nSenator to testify about his motives for legislation or\nfor a legislative act, then a district court could\ndecide that that evidence would not come in. The firing\nitself, however, is not a legislative act and the\nmotivation behind the firing is not precluded by the\nSpeech or Debate Clause.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What if it required him to\nsay how he allocated his resources, that he allocate his\nresources 10 percent to foreign affairs issues, 50\npercent to health care issues? Would that involve is --\nis that a Speech or Debate Clause problem?\nMR. SALZMAN: I don't believe that it would,\nbe Justice Kennedy. I don't think that that would\nintrude so much on his goals with respect to a\nparticular piece of legislation or with respect to a\ngeneral legislative agenda. I'm not sure I would see\nthat his testifying about how he has allocated money in\nthe office, for example, would be anything other than\ntestimony about an administrative decision.\nIf he were -- for example, if a plaintiff\ncertainly attempted to introduce evidence in a case\nabout a speech that the Senator gave on the floor of the\nSenate in which he was accused of making maybe a bigoted\nor a sexist remark, Section 413 would clearly preclude\nthat. And there may be circumstance, for example, where\nif a plaintiff wanted to introduce a draft of the speech\nor a draft of legislation, that a court, district court,\ncould in those circumstances say that that intrudes so\nmuch on a true legislative act that the court could\npreclude that testimony from going in.\nWe don't believe that in the, in the run of\nthese cases, that will be difficult for the district\ncourts to handle.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That doesn't quite capture\nthe problem that I'm having. It's not that the\nplaintiff can't inquire. Usually they can't. But my\nthought is that the defendant cannot put in his own\ndefense without waiving the privilege that would\notherwise be applicable. So he's sort of in a dilemma.\nEither I give up my constitutional right not to talk\nabout this stuff or I've got to waive that right in\norder to give a full explanation of why I discharged the\nplaintiff.\nMR. SALZMAN: Understood, Justice Stevens.\nI think that in most cases that will not present a\ndilemma. Even if the Senator's explanation is, I\nassigned a real legislative aide to research a piece of\nlegislation and I was dissatisfied for whatever reason,\nsuppose the reason is that the aide simply didn't turn\nin the memo that that he was assigned to do. The\nSenator testifying about, I gave an assignment to this\nperson, the due date was September 1st, I never got it\nor he was late or it was riddled with errors --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Or he just wrote a lousy\nmemo. In order to demonstrate it's lousy, I've got to\ntalk about legislative matters.\nMR. SALZMAN: If that is truly the situation\nand if a district court assessing, once all of the\ninformation is presented to the district court, that\nrequiring the Senator in that circumstance to discuss\nreally his legislative goals, we think that maybe that\nevidence would not be permitted. Now, the, this court\nhas recognized --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Even if the Senator did\nnot have a defense?\nMR. SALZMAN: Well, in Brewster, Your Honor,\nthis Court recognized that there may be situations where\nthe court permits an indictment to go forward, in which\nthe indictment itself and the proof that the prosecutor\nwill be presenting does not so intrude on the\nlegislative process that it would be precluded but that\nthe Defendant may decide that in order to explain the\naccusation he needs to rely on legislative acts. And\nthe court recognized that that may be the situation that\nthe Senator is in. I believe the Third Circuit in a\ndecision written by Justice Alito, the McDade case,\ntalks about that circumstance, where the Senator at that\npoint can choose to put in his explanation and be\nsubject to cross-examination simply with respect to that\nexplanation, but that the prosecution is not precluded\nin its entirety. And certainly that's what we are\ntalking about here.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but what if the\nSenator doesn't want to put it in? I mean, what if he\ndoes not want to waive the privilege? Is his only\nchoice in effect to sit moot and lose the case?\nMR. SALZMAN: Well, if he chooses to sit\nmoot and if the evidence --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: \"Mute\" I guess I should\nhave said.\nMR. SALZMAN: Mute, I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. SALZMAN: If he chooses to stay silent,\nthen perhaps the case just goes forward without an\nexplanation. The defendant --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, why don't, why\ndoesn't that -- why doesn't being placed in that dilemma\nin effect implicate the clause, and why can't he invoke\nthe clause as a basis for dismissal?\nMR. SALZMAN: Well, Judge Randolph below\nthought that there may be circumstances where the\nevidence is so, all of the evidence is so bound up in a\nlegislative act that the case might not go forward. We\nrespectfully disagree with that. We think that that\nwill rarely be the circumstance. But this is the system\nthat Congress set up and Congress created the system in\na, in a careful way. The defendant is not the member.\nThe member faces no financial liability whatsoever from\na finding of discrimination or unlawful behavior.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, yes, so far as the\nmember's immediate financial concern, they took care of\nit. But I'm not sure about the careful way. They in\neffect said, you know, if this gets into Speech or\nDebate Clause issues they prevail. And that kind of\njust leaves us with no solution for the problem that\nJustice Stevens raised and that I'm concerning with,\nunless there's, there's going to be an automatic\ndismissal when the member says, look, I cannot respond\nto this without getting into, into acts within the\nlegislative process which are privileged.\nUnless you want to recognize that as kind of\nan absolute defense upon its invocation, I don't see how\nwe get out of the problem.\nMR. CABALLERO: Well, Justice Souter, our\nargument is that the decision itself is certainly not a\nlegislative act, and the most -- and that is in\naccordance with this Court's view of the judicial\nprivilege in Forrester that the decision itself is not a\njudicial act. The reasons behind the decision in the\nlegislative context could be shielded by the evidentiary\nprivilege, but we think there's a clear difference\nbetween the employees performing a duty that is related\nto the legislative process being different than a\nlegislative act itself.\nIt may be that in some rare circumstances\nthe Senator in order to fully defend himself feels the\nneed to actually testify about real legislative acts,\nsuch as votes on something or his conduct in a committee\nproceeding. But his assessment of an employee's\nperformance, just as Judge White's assessment in the\nForrester case of Miss Forrester's performance, is not\nlegislative activity. It may be activity that is\nimportant to the legislative process. It may provide\nfor a sound legislative arena, just as in the judicial\nsphere. But when this Court found unanimous,\nunanimously that when Judge White was assessing the\nperformance of Miss Forrester in the judicial context\nand deciding, I don't think she did a good job on\ndelegated judicial functions, that's not a judicial act.\nAnd we would say the same with respect to a legislative\nact, so --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That would go for a\nstenographer in a committee hearing?\nMR. SALZMAN: Yes, Your Honor, and I believe\nthat's the Browning case, that the D.C. Circuit\noriginally had found would be considered a legislative\nact. And we do believe that, yes, the assessment by\nthe, whoever supervised Miss Browning that her\nperformance was inadequate is not itself a legislative\nactivity. Miss Browning's performance obviously was\ninvolved, was closely tied to the legislative process\nbecause she was a stenographer at hearings. If the\ncommittee, if the committee decided in a committee\nproceeding and took a vote that they were not going to\nuse stenographers any more and Miss Browning had brought\na challenge with respect to that, alleging that it was\nfocused personally on her and racially motivated, then\nwe think a legislative immunity might apply as it did in\nthe Bogan case.\nBut absent that, it's our belief that an\nassessment of an employee's performance, even if the\nemployee is performing duties that are related to the\nlegislative process, is not itself a legislative act.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, it could or couldn't\nbe. I mean, I mean if the legislator, the Senator,\nsays, I think relevant to my dismissal of this\nindividual is the individual's performance that revealed\nitself in a speech or debate that I gave in the House,\nand if that's relevant, then why isn't that the end of\nthe case, they can't bring it?\nMR. SALZMAN: Justice Breyer, I think that\nthat is one of the rare circumstances where the, the\nSenator's assessment of the performance is very tied up\nwith a legislative act.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, all he'd have to say\nis it's relevant to my decision to fire the person.\nNow, surely a jury or whoever -- it's probably a jury\nmatter, I guess, on this -- is entitled to take that\ninto account. If it's something the jury is entitled to\ntake into account, you are questioning what that Senator\ndid in the speech or debate and you are questioning it\nin another place, namely, a court.\nMR. SALZMAN: You are, Justice Breyer. The\nemployee's performance, we believe, of the speech\nwriting would not be considered a legislative act. This\nCourt said in Gravel that there is a difference between\na legislative act which goes on in a committee\nproceeding and preparation for that proceeding, and the\nemployee's performance getting the Senator ready to give\nhis speech would not itself be considered a legislative\nact, but in that circumstance the district court might\nsay that because the Senator's explanation is so clearly\ntied to a real legislative act, a speech that he\nactually gave on the floor of the Congress, perhaps that\nmight be a circumstance where judge Randolph's view that\nthat case could not go forward might apply.\nThat's not this case. This case deals with\nthreshold immunity issues, where the Senator's office is\nsaying that any personnel decision that it engages in is\nby definition a legislative act if it relates to anybody\nwho works in their office. And Congress clearly was not\nof that view. It defined every employee of the Senate,\nincluding those who worked in a Senator's office, to be\na covered employee and all covered employees under\nSection 408 have the right to go to court.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Have any cases gone\nthrough a district court on the merits under this Act?\nMR. SALZMAN: I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Have any cases under this\nAct gone to a district court to judgment on the merits?\nMR. SALZMAN: No, Justice Ginsburg. The\nclosest -- my understanding is the closest we have\ngotten is the companion case in this case, the Fields\ncase, is scheduled for trial in October and it is my\nunderstanding that they have gone through some discovery\nin that case. I don't believe that there have been any,\nany cases under the Congressional Accountability Act in\ncourt, that have made it past that.\nIf there are no further questions --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I have one question. The\nAppellants here were the ones that appealed to the court\nof appeals? Did they appeal from the district court?\nMR. SALZMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But under 1291, the United\nStates Court of Appeals does not have jurisdiction where\ndirect review may be had in the Supreme Court. So it\nseems to me that their position contradicts their own\nbasis for jurisdiction here. Do you agree with that?\nMR. SALZMAN: Not entirely, Justice Kennedy.\nWe do -- we had thought that initially and then upon\nreflection it seemed to us that because the minute order\nof the district -- because the order of the district\ncourt was a minute order that did not explain its\nreasoning, perhaps there was some ambiguity about\nwhether he was simply finding that Mr. Hanson had so\nlittle contact with the legislative process that, that\nthe case should go forward or whether he was in essence\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but my point is that\nthe Appellants are telling us that this is appealable\nhere directly, but if that's so they shouldn't have gone\nto court of appeals, they shouldn't have gone to the\ncourt of appeals; they're untimely when they come here.\nMR. SALZMAN: That is our understanding of\nthe way it generally works. We believe that the GYRA\nstatute, which was the predecessor to the Congressional\nAccountability Act, may have permitted appeals directly\nfrom the court of appeals to this court. So there\nappears to be some ambiguity. When we first responded\nwith respect to the appeal, we did argue that if Senator\nDayton's office wanted to appeal directly they needed to\ndo that two years ago when the district court had ruled.\nUpon further research, we were not sure that that was\ncorrect, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Salzman.\nMr. Caballero.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS E. CABALLERO\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING APPELLEE\nMR. CABALLERO: Justice Stevens and may it\nplease the Court:\nWe agree that there is no jurisdiction in\nthis Court under Section 412. But I first would like to\ncorrect one of the answers regarding cases under this\nCongressional Accountability Act.\nTwo cases have been finally adjudicated by\nthe district courts. One was two cases against offices\nof members or committees where an employee worked for a\nmember. One of those involved a finding that it was\noutside the limitations in the statute. The other case\nwas a summary judgment finding of an employee who was a\nlegislative employee of the Committee on Ways and Means\nand the Court found that the dismissal there was on an\nallowable ground under the statute and there was no\nviolation of the employee's rights.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And there's no jurisdiction\nunder 412 because?\nMR. CABALLERO: Because, as we said in our\nbrief, the decision of the court of appeals was a\ndecision on the scope of the Speech or Debate Clause as\nthat clause is preserved in Section 413 of the act and\ntherefore there would be no appeal under Section 412.\nIf the court does go to the merits in this\nmatter, I think it's important to effectuate Congress'\nintent in enacting the statute along with its concerns\nwith the Speech or Debate Clause. The Speech or Debate\nClause provides senators and representatives with a\nconstitutional privilege that is critical to securing\nthe independence of the legislative branch in our system\nof government.\nCertainly, Congress is the institution that\nhas the greatest interest in and is most sensitive to\nmaintaining a robust speech or debate privilege under\nthis Court's precedence. In enacting the Congressional\nAccountability Act, however, Congress concluded that it\ncould provide its own employees with the same employment\nlaw protections that it had already provided Executive\nBranch employees and private sector employees, including\nthe critical right of action for victims of illegal\ndiscrimination to bring suit in the Federal court; and\nthat a suit under the Act would not infringe upon the\nSpeech or Debate Clause.\nCongress relied on this Court's own\nprecedent in making that determination. Under the\nSpeech or Debate Clause, this Court has made clear that\nthe clause is robust, protects activities outside of\njust speech and debate on the floor of either House, but\nthat it shouldn't be extended beyond what is necessary\nto preserve the independence of the legislative process.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can we go back a step. I\njust -- you said this is appealable and your reason for\nit being appealable was because the statute itself --\nyou said it was not appealable and the reason not is\nbecause the statute itself said that this has to be\napplied consistent with the Speech or Debate Clause?\nMR. CABALLERO: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's your reason. So I\ntake it, what about the reason that's been given, that\nthis is an as-applied challenge instead of on its face?\nWhat about that as a reason for it not being appealable?\nMR. CABALLERO: Well, that is an application\nof Section 412, the preservation of Speech or Debate\nClause in the statute.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no, I'm not asking\nabout the argument you are making. I want to ask about\nan argument you aren't making, that the reason -- I'll\nask about the one you are making in a second. The\nreason I want to know about -- I want to know about the\nother possible reason for not being appealed, namely\nthat this is as applied and not on its face. They don't\nstrike down any provision. What's your view about that\none?\nMR. CABALLERO: Our view is that that is\ncorrect, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That is correct. And what\nyou do about this case, what is it, Eichman?\nMR. CABALLERO: The Eichman case they cited.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In Eichman, I was able to\nget out the district court and the last part of the\ndistrict court, the last line of the district court, it\nsays the law under which these three -- let me begin\nagain -- the law under which these three defendants have\nbeen prosecuted is unconstitutional, which seems to me\nto contradict what Appellant's counsel told us about\nwhat happened in the district court.\nMR. CABALLERO: I think that's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It wouldn't matter anyway,\nbecause our prior decisions that do not explicitly refer\nto jurisdictional questions are not authority on\njurisdiction.\nMR. CABALLERO: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We have that firm rule:\nWhen we take a case and don't get into the\njurisdictional question, it is not precedent for the\nfact -- -\nMR. CABALLERO: For a finding of\njurisdiction later, that's correct.\nI would say --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So then a holding of a\ndistrict court in your opinion, the holdings say,\nimaginary, is that no one who actually works in an\noffice of a Senator and who ever worked on any matter\nhaving to do with legislation falls within this Act\nbecause that would violate the speech and debate clause.\nThat would be quite major in its implication. But\nyou're saying there is no appeal on that because it's as\napplied.\nMR. CABALLERO: Right. Based on the court\nof appeals decision, I would say the two arguments as\napplied in the preservation of Section 413 aren't wholly\nseparate.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Does that mean if I go to\nyour argument -- I mean, the problem with your argument\nit seems to me is that that leaves no room for this\nappellate provision at law, because the only reason that\nanything is likely to be unconstitutional in this area,\nat least 99 percent of it, would be Speech or Debate\nClause violation. So in that interpretation of the\nstatute there is no direct appeal, or hardly ever.\nMR. CABALLERO: Well, there was a lot of\ndiscussion in the legislative history about the\nseparation of powers generally.\nJUSTICE ALITO: We were told that 75 percent\nof the employees who were covered by the Act do not work\nfor an individual member. So how could, how could a\nprovision to be facially unconstitutional under the\nSpeech or Debate Clause?\nMR. CABALLERO: Well, I think the provision\nwasn't held facially unconstitutional.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What could it possibly be?\nAnd if it couldn't possibly be then what did Congress\nhave in mind when it provided it for an interlocutory\nappeal from a ruling on the constitutionality of the\nstatute.\nMR. CABALLERO: Again, there was major\ndebate in the Congress over whether or not the provision\nof judicial hearing of suits over congressional\nemployment decisions, separate from the Speech or Debate\nClause, just a separation of powers concern of having\nthe judiciary oversee the workings of Congress, and\nthere was a concern about that separation of powers\nissue, which would be a facial issue. Can you hear any\nsuits by employees of Congress who are employed in a\nseparate branch?\nAnd that was where this provision has life,\nand is meant to protect the ability for a litigant to\nbring it before this Court immediately; it would be a\nfacial challenge.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. That, that may make\nsense. I, I wondered why -- why they would provide for\nan appeal on constitutionality if they had in mind the\nSpeech or Debate Clause stuff, when the legislation\nitself says that nothing herein shall be deemed a\nviolation of speech.\nMR. CABALLERO: Right. It preserves a\nmember's -- exactly. It preserves a member's speech or\ndebate.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah.\nMR. CABALLERO: And when Congress did\nprovide these rights under the statute, it was very\nimportant for the Congress under the previous regime\naffecting the Senate, employees had employment\nprotections and they had administrative processes that\nthey could go to. But they lacked a judicial right.\nAnd Congress made a specific decision that providing\nthat right of action was an important employment law\nprotection employees needed.\nAnd again it relied on this Court's\ndecisions both under the Speech or Debate Clause as to\nthe scope of the clause and under Forrester where this\nCourt held that a judge's employment decision as to an\nemployee who did judicial duties was not a judicial act,\ndid -- achieve absolute immunity. It was a -- it was an\nadministrative act, an employment act.\nAnd similarly here what is brought before\nthe courts is an employment act. Again this case is\nbefore the Court on a motion to dismiss. There has been\nno discovery. There has been no litigation over the\nclaims involved. There is just a question presented\ndoes the Speech or Debate Clause bar the jurisdiction of\nFederal courts when a legislative, an employee with any\nlegislative duties brings a suit under the Act? And I\nthink the question, the answer to that question has to\nbe no.\nIndeed in the case here, you could have\nlitigation over whether the Senator knew of the alleged\ndisability. That's one of the disputes that's been laid\nout in the pleadings, whether that was the basis for\nthe, for the decision to terminate the employee.\nThese are all the types of issues that play\nout in district courts. District courts receive\nevidence. They make these judgments; they see the\nspecific context and they make specific rulings. To try\nto decide in the abstract how you would apply an\nemployment law case with the Speech or Debate Clause in\nan evidentiary sense is very difficult. And that's why\na more full record would be necessary. But to decide\nthe question on appeal, I think the Court can easily\ndecide if these cases go forward.\nOne last point I would like to make is to\naddress the issue of the existence of the office. It's\nnot a mere creation of the Act. Senators have personal\noffices. Those offices incur liabilities or\nobligations. They buy paper; they make contracts and\nthe like. When a Senator leaves office, the employing\noffice still has to pay the bills that were incurred\nwhen the Senator was in office. And the Senate allows\nemploying offices under the approval of the former\nmember to submit the vouchers and receive payment. The\nemploying office has life afterwards.\nSimilarly here, if it incurs an employment\nliability it has life sufficient to litigate whether or\nnot that liability exists and a judgment will be paid\nunder Government funds under the Act.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it will -- the money is\nsimply Senate money.\nMR. CABALLERO: Yes. The money is an\nappropriation of Senate -- and under the fund, the money\nis an appropriation for the specific fund under the Act\nfor paying judgements in these cases.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But none of those funds\nare, as I understand it, are somehow subtracted from or\ncontributed by the funds of individual senatorial\noffices while a Senator is in office. I am assuming\nthat those, that there is a separate appropriation for\nthe payment of -- of any such judgment, is that correct?\nMR. CABALLERO: Under the Act there is.\nCongress decided to not have any personal liability for\na member to shield them from that, and also not to\nrequire the member's office in cases such as illegal\ndiscrimination cases, to pay the awards or judgments.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. In the real world\nthen at this point isn't the Senate the -- the party?\nMR. CABALLERO: Perhaps it's a party in\ninterest, but I would say again that the named party is\nnot a party without any life except under the Act.\nI thank the Court.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Manning, you have\nabout a minute left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY JEAN M. MANNING,\nON BEHALF OF APPELLANT\nMS. MANNING: There are four instances in\nwhich the Court has found that jurisdiction is barred in\nSpeech or Debate Clause cases. The first is when the\ncase is predicated on a legislative act. The second is\nwhen the case cannot, that is cannot be adjudicated\nwithout questioning a legislative act or the motive for\nthe act. And the third is when the member will be made\nto answer in terms of his defense for a legislative act.\nThis goes to the question that Justice\nStevens asked. In Gravel the Court made it clear that\nif the member is made to answer in his defense for a\nlegislative act, that violates the Speech or Debate\nClause. Under the, these types of cases the member\ndoes, would have to come forward and explain a\nlegislative act: that is, why did I terminate this\nemployee?\nThat is the explanation, because the\ntermination itself is a legislative act, he is being\nquestioned about a legislative act.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Right. I have one -- one\nquestion. Could the Senate direct you to pay this\njudgment?\nMS. MANNING: Direct me -- I'm sorry. Me\npersonally?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Direct your office to --\nto do that.\nMS. MANNING: To pay the judgment?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Because it -- suppose they\nthought there was liability and if you say yes, then I\nneed to know why you and counsel who just addressed this\nare on different sides of the case, if you're both\nrepresenting the Senate.\nMS. MANNING: They cannot direct us to pay.\nIt of course comes out of the Treasury fund and the\nSenate has had absolutely no control or involvement at\nall for 12 years in any of these cases. They do not\nknow --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could it, if it chose?\nMS. MANNING: Well, I believe that it cannot\nbecause the defendant in this case is the employing\noffice.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All right.\nMS. MANNING: So for that reason the Senate\nhas never, doesn't even know the cases exist. Doesn't\nknow that we are negotiating settlement. Doesn't review\nsettlement agreements. Is not involved in strategy. In\nfact the CAA in Section 403 states that the, that the\nmediation and then the counseling in the case is\nstrictly confidential. The Senate cannot even know that\nthey are happening. Only the employing office can know.\nIn no sense has the Senate been the defendant. If the\nSenate has been defendant --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Manning --\nMS. MANNING: Where this they been for\ntwelve years? They have not been in these cases for\ntwelve years.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Ms. Manning.\n"
