        "content": "(10:07 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Number 00-1021, Rush Prudential HMO,\nInc. v. Deborah C. Moran.\nMr. Roberts.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nERISA preemption cases can be exceedingly\ncomplicated, but our submission this morning is\nstraightforward. This Court held in Pilot Life that\nERISA's civil enforcement provisions were the exclusive\nremedy for improper processing of a claim for benefits\nunder an ERISA-regulated plan. The Illinois independent\nexternal review law at issue in this case affords a\ndifferent remedy for a beneficiary dissatisfied with an\nHMO's denial of benefits. The Illinois law is therefore\npreempted.\nJust last week, in Great West Life, this Court\nbegan its analysis by noting that it was especially\nreluctant to tamper with ERISA's enforcement scheme, and\nby quoting prior precedent for the proposition that that\nenforcement scheme indicated that Congress did not intend\nto authorize other remedies that it forgot to incorporate\nexpressly. That same language, quoted in Great West Life,\nwas quoted 15 years ago in Pilot Life. ERISA's remedies\nare exclusive, whether we're talking about additional\nFederal remedies or additional State remedies.\nQUESTION: Mr. Roberts, could you help me with\none part of the facts I'm a little puzzled about? Your\nopponents argue there's a difference between the plan and\nthe HMO, and that he claims that you -- what you say would\napply to a suit against the plan, but this is a suit\nagainst the HMO, and I have been unable to find the plan\nin the papers. Is the plan in the record?\nMR. ROBERTS: The respondent alleged in the\ncomplaint, joint appendix page 32 and 38, that the\ncertificate of coverage was the plan, and that is in the\nrecord. It is Exhibit A to the complaint.\nQUESTION: The certificate of coverage -- who\nare the parties to the certificate of coverage?\nMR. ROBERTS: The certificate of coverage is an\nagreement between the HMO and the employer that extends to\nparticular employees the benefits that are set forth\nthere.\nQUESTION: And in your view, you say -- are they\njust hooked by their allegation, or do you think it's\nclear that that is the correct -- that is the plan?\nMR. ROBERTS: I think they're first bound by\ntheir allegation, but second of all, even if other\ndocuments also contribute terms to the plan, certainly the\ncertificate of coverage indicates elements of the plan.\nThere may be other documents that set forth other terms of\nthe plan.\nQUESTION: You see, they say that's an insurance\npolicy that is purchased by the plan, in effect.\nThat's -- and that therefore there's a distinction between\nthe plan and the insurance policy, and I know you\ndisagree. You say the HMO is not an insurance policy, but\nis there -- explain to me why that's totally wrong.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, it's totally wrong because\nthe question is not how the State law operates to grant a\nnew remedy to a beneficiary. We think it's irrelevant\nwhether it operates on the insurance policy or whether it\noperates on the plan. The point is, however it operates,\nit provides beneficiaries, under an ERISA-regulated plan,\nwith a new remedy, and that remedy is one that's not\ngranted by Congress in ERISA, and the Court in Pilot Life\nsaid only the remedies that are granted are available.\nQUESTION: Of course, one could also say it's\nnot really a new remedy, it's a new protection, sort of\nlike the -- see, the question is whether Pilot Life\ncontrols or the Massachusetts case controls. It's an\ninteresting -- whether it's something like a compelled\nbenefit or a compelled protection of some kind --\nMR. ROBERTS: Right.\nQUESTION: -- that the insurance company\nprovides.\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes, and I think the difference\nis, between mandated benefits laws like Massachusetts,\nthose laws provide, as this Court said in UNUM, a rule of\ndecision that is to be applied by whoever the decision-\nmaker is in reviewing a denial of benefits.\nHere, it's not a new rule of decision, it's a\nnew decision-maker, and that decision-maker isn't looking\nto State law to say, well, they've given you mental health\ncoverage and so that has to be provided, he's deciding\nwhat -- whether the denial of benefits was proper or not,\nand that can only be characterized as a remedy, whether\nit's --\nQUESTION: Well -- no, I didn't mean to\ninterrupt.\nIsn't the problem that he's doing two things?\nThe decision that he makes is necessarily going to have\nits consequence on whether the benefit denial was correct\nor not, but he's also making a medical kind of decision,\nis, in fact, this reasonable medical practice, and so he's\nnot merely in the position which a court is in when a\ncourt says, does the evidence show this is reasonable\nmedical practice. He's in the decision of, in effect,\nmaking a kind of practice decision which doctors, as\ndoctors, make, so it's somewhere in between.\nMR. ROBERTS: We don't think that's a correct\ncharacterization. There is no element of a treatment\ncomponent in this decision. The only thing that is at\nissue in this independent external review is coverage, for\na number of reasons. First of all, the treatment had\nalready taken place. There was no question of treatment.\nBut coverage is all that Rush HMO has undertaken to\nprovide. It does not provide health care. It doesn't\nprovide -- it agrees to pay for health care.\nQUESTION: Well, this particular -- I'm assuming\nin answer to your -- from your answer to Justice Stevens,\nI'm assuming that in this case it is so, but their\nargument is, you can have HMO's that have nothing to do\nwith ERISA plans, and you can have ERISA plans that don't\nemploy HMO's to provide welfare benefits, and therefore\nit's appropriate to think of this as a medical decision or\nas a regulation of medical practice in a particular form,\nrather than insurance, so once again there's -- the\nproblem is that the facts do not place this in a clear\ncategory.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, I -- with respect, I think\nthe facts do place this in a very clear category, because\nthere's no question of treatment at issue. Even if the\nState is purporting to articulate its definition of\nmedical necessity, that's not the question. The question\nis, is this beneficiary entitled to benefits under this\nplan, and the judgment about what is medically necessary\nis something that is addressed in the plan. The plan\nprovides the broadest possible discretion to the HMO to\ninterpret the plan terms, including medical necessity.\nQUESTION: Well, but what if the State law in\neffect tinkered with how you interpret the plan, and\nspelled out that in determining what's medically necessary\nthe plan will make use of an independent medical\nconsultant.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, the State law can define\nmedical necessity. I think that's just like a mandated\nbenefit, saying you have to --\nQUESTION: And can it not say, and furthermore,\nif there's any dispute you will use an independent medical\nconsultant?\nMR. ROBERTS: That it cannot do consistent with\nPilot Life, because that is a remedy for a denial of\nbenefits, and Pilot Life indicated --\nQUESTION: Well, not necessarily. It may be\nmore a definition in the plan, or a provision of the\ninsurance plan itself, and then that in turn is\nenforceable under section 502.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, that's --\nQUESTION: I mean, that's the argument, and I\ncan understand that that, you could view it through that\nlens, could you not?\nMR. ROBERTS: And I think, as Judge Posner\npointed out in his dissent, if you do that, then all bets\nare off. If you say that this is incorporated by State\nlaw into your plan, and so when you enforce that remedy,\nall you're doing is enforcing a term of the plan --\nQUESTION: Well, is that so surprising, in light\nof the fact that the ERISA law itself excludes regulations\nof insurance? The law itself took that out of ERISA\ncoverage, in effect.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, now that was the specific\nquestion addressed in Pilot Life. That was -- the heavy\nlifting in the Pilot Life opinion was reconciling the\nexclusivity of the civil remedies and the Saving Clause.\nYou can look at it one of two ways. If you give the\nSavings Clause full force, then the remedies aren't going\nto be exclusive in a case involving an insurer. If you\ngive the exclusivity of ERISA's remedies full force, then\nthe Savings Clause is relegated to a lower status, and --\nQUESTION: Well, we had a case, U-N-U-M v. Ward,\nand held that any statute that effectively creates a\nmandatory contract term and regulates only insurance\ncompanies is an insurance law under the Savings Clause.\nMR. ROBERTS: UNUM did not involve a remedy. It\nsaid, the question under Pilot Life and 502 was, quote,\nnot implicated, because it wasn't a State remedy that they\nwere trying to save under the insurance Savings Clause.\nIt was a rule of decision. This is not a rule of\ndecision. It's a different decision-maker, and if this\ntype of State law remedy is allowed, then there's nothing\nleft --\nQUESTION: But UNUM --\nQUESTION: But Mr. Roberts, can --\nQUESTION: -- wasn't a procedural ruling. UNUM\nwas a question of how late could you file, and the State\nlaw said you could file late, and --\nMR. ROBERTS: The law --\nQUESTION: -- why should that be treated\ndifferently? The State is making something timely, giving\nthe beneficiary a chance to collect that the plan itself\nwould not have given.\nMR. ROBERTS: I think that's correct. I -- the\nline is not -- and this is what UNUM taught. The line is\nnot between substance and procedure when you're talking\nabout mandated coverage. That's not the line we're\nadvocating. The line we're advocating is between mandated\ncoverage, what does term, what does the plan have to\nprovide, and UNUM said, one thing it has to provide,\nwhatever the coverage is, coverage for those claims that\nare filed in a timely manner, or, if not, that did not\nprejudice the insurer.\nThis is different. This is not a new term of\ncoverage. It's a remedy. If you don't like what the HMO\nhas done with your benefits claim, you get to go to a\nState law, independent external reviewer, and get it\noverturned, and --\nQUESTION: But it's a different kind of remedy\nthan saying, for example, punitive damages. It's --\nMR. ROBERTS: It --\nQUESTION: And I thought that's what Pilot Life\nwas about.\nMR. ROBERTS: The argument is made that this is\nokay because all you get are the benefits that you're\nentitled to under the plan. We think that the Taylor\ndecision, decided the same day as Pilot Life, rejects that\nargument. It says that one of the claims in that case was\nfor the benefits due under the plan, not punitive damages,\nnot emotional distress, the plan benefits, and the Court\nsaid, that's not only preemptive, that's completely\npreemptive.\nERISA preempts not only different remedies, but\nalternative, additional remedies.\nQUESTION: Well, under your theory there could\nbe no private arbitration agreement by an HMO plan and\npeople covered by the plan?\nMR. ROBERTS: No. I think that's certainly an\nopen question. The issue there would be --\nQUESTION: I don't see how it's open under your\nview.\nMR. ROBERTS: Arbitration -- it's the difference\nbetween a voluntary agreement between parties, which is\nwhat ERISA seeks to enforce, and something that's\ncompelled by State law. The analogy that the Solicitor\nGeneral draws to the collective bargaining --\nQUESTION: But under your rationale, 502\ncontrols. It's a remedy. So how could a private agreement\nto arbitrate survive under your theory?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, it would survive because it\nwould be regarded as an internal plan procedure, not --\nQUESTION: But wouldn't it also conflict --\nwouldn't it also conflict with the statutory provision?\nMR. ROBERTS: No. No. I mean, the -- ERISA\nallows internal remedies, appeals within the plan, and\nagain it's an open question, but we don't dispute that the\narbitration would be allowed.\nThe problem with the analogy to the arbitration\ncases is that the Solicitor General stops too early. Yes,\nyou can have voluntary arbitration, even where remedies\nare preempted, but surely a State law that directed that\nparties to a collective bargaining agreement must\narbitrate, and here's how they must arbitrate, would be\npreempted by the Labor Management Relations Act.\nIf you pursue the analogy to a situation that's\ncomparable to this case, the conclusion that there's\npreemption seems to follow inexorably, and the idea that\neverything is all right because at the end of the day you\nhave to enforce this in a section 502 action really makes\na hollow shell out of Pilot Life. You have to sometimes\nenforce arbitration in court, but we still think of\narbitration as a different remedy. We don't say, that's a\njudicial remedy because it has to be enforced.\nQUESTION: Yes, but there's another difference\nwith Pilot Life, and that, the only question is whether it\nrelated to the insurance. Here, you have -- you admit\nit's related, but then you get onto the second ball game\nof whether it's a change in the insurance coverage, and\none can look at this, I think -- I just need -- I want you\nto comment on this -- as not changing a term of the plan,\nbut, rather, changing a term of the insurance policy\npurchased by the plan.\nMR. ROBERTS: And we actually go on to the third\ngame which is, if it conflicts with the substantive term\nof ERISA, and this is what Pilot Life held, it is\npreempted, and this conflicts with the exclusivity of the\nremedies.\nWe don't believe, when you go through the usual\ninsurance Savings Clause factors, that this is the\nregulation of insurance, but what Pilot Life held, and\nthis was the important part of the decision, which was\nunanimous, is that when you look at the Savings Clause you\nhave to be informed by an understanding of what Congress\nwas trying to do with the exclusive remedies, that the\nmost important -- quote, most important consideration in\ndeciding whether that remedy in that case is covered by\nthe Savings Clause was that Congress said that all the\nremedies were exclusive. If you allow them back into this\nback door of the Savings Clause, then that exclusivity is\ngoing to be completely undermined. That's the issue\nthat's here before the Court.\nQUESTION: That is -- I'd like to expand just a\nlittle, because I'm actually trying to work out what's the\nframework within which we think of this, and I had thought\nthat that part of Pilot Life was really part of the reason\nfor interpreting the Savings Clause as it was there\ninterpreted, that normally what you do is ask the first\nquestion, is this preempted in the first place, and it is\nif there's field preemption, if there's conflict\npreemption, and maybe, with ERISA, if there's something\nmore, and ordinarily, if there is such a conflict, the\nFederal side wins, but the whole point of the Savings\nClause is to say, if there's a conflict in respect to\ninsurance, the State wins. Stop right there.\nBut then maybe Pilot Life adds something else,\nwhich says, but it couldn't just say if there's a conflict\nthat brought you into preemption in the first place, well,\nthe Federal Government wins, because that would be to\neviscerate the meaning of the Savings Clause. Now, that's\nthe framework in my mind, and I'd appreciate anything you\ncould help with that.\nMR. ROBERTS: And again, that poses sort of a\nconflict between what the Court in Pilot Life said were\nthe exclusive remedies and the Savings Clause. That is\nwhat this Court unanimously decided 15 years ago in Pilot\nLife when it said, when we look at the Savings Clause, the\nmost important thing -- most important thing -- is to keep\nin mind the remedies are supposed to be exclusive, so that\nif this is a remedy, it is a regulation of ERISA, it is\nnot the regulation of insurance, and the Court reaffirmed\nthat approach in the John Hancock case where it said, and\nI'll just quote one sentence, no decision of this Court\nhas applied the Savings Clause to supersede the provision\nin ERISA itself.\nIf you apply the Savings Clause to allow this\nState law remedy to be applied, that would be superseding\nwhat this Court said section 502 of ERISA meant in Pilot\nLife, which was that these remedies are exclusive. That\nquestion was addressed. That was -- and I'll say it\nagain, that was the hard part of the opinion in Pilot\nLife, and that was reaffirmed in John Hancock, and --\nQUESTION: I see that. Then I'd think what\nyou're saying, I take it, is at least where the conflict\nis particularly severe, it's perhaps not -- the State\ndoesn't necessarily win, and you think this is a\nparticularly bad one.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, I do think it's particularly\nbad, but I don't think it has to be. I think if the State\nlaw stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the\nFederal objectives, it is preempted. The Federal\nobjective requires exclusivity with respect to remedies.\nThis obviously stands as an obstacle to that objective and\nso is preempted.\nNow, they say it's saved because the last stop\nin this State law remedy is a quick dash into Federal\ncourt to get a stamp that says, enforce. The State law\nsays, if the reviewer says you've got to provide this, the\nHMO has to provide it, and they say, well, that's okay,\nbecause we run into Federal court, we make this a 502\naction.\nWell, that makes Pilot Life ridiculous, because\nit says every type of remedy is okay so long as the last\nstop is a quick visit to the Federal courthouse. It also\nraises very serious Article III concerns, because Federal\ncourts are not supposed to be looking at decisions made\nby -- made under State law that they have no authority to\nreview and simply rubber-stamping them, and it gives rise\nto the bizarre results that the respondent and the\nSolicitor General support in this case that an action to\nenforce section 4-10 is completely preempted so that\nthere's jurisdiction, but then it turns out section 4-10\nis not preempted at all. That's a very curious result,\nbut they have to maintain --\nQUESTION: What is section 4-10, Mr. Roberts?\nMR. ROBERTS: 4-10 is the State law, of the\nIllinois HMO act. I've been referring to it as the\nindependent external review law. But they have to\nmaintain that facade.\nQUESTION: Would you state the absurd positions\nagain?\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: It didn't strike me as that absurd,\nbut --\nMR. ROBERTS: What is absurd is that they have\nto maintain that this can only be enforced under a 502\naction, that the State law claim -- keep in mind this\nbegan, of course, as a State law claim in State court.\n502 wasn't mentioned at all. It was recharacterized as a\n502 action, they said because it's completely preempted,\nbut the underlying remedy that's being enforced isn't\npreempted at all.\nNow, those are two different questions,\njurisdiction and substance, but it does seem odd that if\nyou're going in and all you're doing is getting a rubber\nstamp from the Federal courthouse saying, enforced, that\nthat's completely preempted, when the law isn't preempted\nat all.\nQUESTION: Well, what they're -- it's not\nabsurd, in their view, anyway, because they're saying they\nhave a human being over here called an arbitrator and this\nhuman being tells you what the benefit is, and what your\nclients are really objecting to, frankly, is not this\nremedy. They couldn't care less.\nWhat they're worried about is that that human\nbeing called the arbitrator is going to say that this\nwoman has to have a certain treatment that otherwise in\ntheir view she wouldn't have to have. I mean, just\nimagine the statute that said, instead of what it says,\nthat you have to provide medical treatment whenever\nthere's a 25-percent chance of improvement. No arbitrator\nat all in that one, and they'll be even more excited, and\nindeed, it doesn't take away the Federal remedy in my\nhypothetical, nor does it in this one. It just turns out\nthat we know who's going to win.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, that's because there's a\ndifferent decision-maker making the decision on your claim\nfor the denial of benefits, and that's what makes it clear\nthat what's involved is a different remedy.\nIt's also a remedy that changes dramatically\nwhat the plan actually provides, and it does that by\ntaking away from the plan fiduciary the deference that the\nfiduciary --\nQUESTION: Is that fiduciary, a definition of\nhis powers of review and so forth, in the record anywhere?\nMR. ROBERTS: I'm sorry, the --\nQUESTION: The -- you two or three times refer\nto the fact that the plan gives the fiduciary this\nstandard of review. Is that in the record?\nMR. ROBERTS: No. The only elements of the plan\nthat are in the record is the certificate of coverage,\nwhich --\nQUESTION: So for all we know the plan might\nactually say, whatever Illinois law requires the decision-\nmaker to do shall be done.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, that's what the law\nprovides.\nQUESTION: I mean, maybe the plan says that,\ntoo, for all I know.\nMR. ROBERTS: No, because the elements of the\nplan that are in the record, the certificate of coverage,\nnotes that the HMO has the broadest possible discretion to\ninterpret the terms of the plan in deciding coverage and,\nunder this Court's decision in Firestone --\nQUESTION: It says that in the certificate?\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes, and -- pages 7 and pages 8.\nIt's Exhibit A to the complaint -- and under this Court's\ndecision in Firestone, that means that that decision is\nsubject to a deferential review.\nThe State law changes that, and the State law\ngives the decision to the independent external reviewer,\nwho makes his decision apparently de novo, so that the\nprecise thing that the plan participants, parties\ncontracted against, the recognition that this medical\nnecessity is a question of judgment, some people are going\nto view it differently, we want to make clear that it's\nour discretion that controls, and that gives us\nentitlement to deferential review --\nQUESTION: Mr. Roberts, some close to 40 States\nhave laws like this?\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes.\nQUESTION: And there's legislation introduced,\nat least in Congress, to accomplish what?\nMR. ROBERTS: My understanding of many of the\npending bills is that they have an external review\nprovision but, of course, it's a Federal one, and that is\nconsistent with ERISA's goal of uniformity in claims\nprocessing and administration.\nQUESTION: Do you know anything about the status\nof that pending legislation?\nMR. ROBERTS: No.\nQUESTION: No.\nMR. ROBERTS: Other than at various times\npassage is imminent, and then it falls apart, but again\nit's a very different thing to say, this is the uniform\nFederal remedy, and to have, as Your Honor points out, 40\ndifferent remedies, if you're running a company that has a\nhealth care plan with operations in different States, the\nhealth plan can't be uniformly --\nQUESTION: Are most of the State law provisions\nsimilar to the one in Illinois?\nMR. ROBERTS: They all have differences. For\nexample, in some States the independent external reviewer\nis an administrative board. In Michigan, it consists of\nseven people in certain places. In some places it's not\njust one person, it's more than one person. Some places\nit consists of employee representatives as well as\nphysicians, but it does change what the parties contracted\nfor, and --\nQUESTION: Why is that a more disturbing change\nthan changes in what is the minimum required coverage?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, I don't know that it's more\ndisturbing. It's different, yes. The impact on an HMO\ncan be greater if the State law says, you must provide\nmental health coverage, this, this, and this, but then at\nleast the employer looking at it knows what's at stake,\nand he knows that the remedy is going to be the remedy\nthat is provided under Federal law, which is that they're\ngoing to enforce what I have agreed to provide under this\nplan, even if what I've agreed to provide is compelled by\nState law.\nYou know that you're not going to face all sorts\nof different remedies and in particular, here, if you\ncontract for the broadest possible discretion, you know\nthat when the review is undertaken your fiduciary decision\nwill be reviewed with appropriate deference. That is\ntaken away here. It's taken away by giving the\nindependent external reviewer the authority to make a de\nnovo decision, so that what is set up are two very\ndifferent remediary regimes.\nThe Federal regime, the fiduciary makes a\ndecision with the broadest possible discretion. His\nobligation is to be faithful to the terms of the plan.\nThat is reviewed in Federal court.\nQUESTION: But it's not the fiduciary's\ndecision, as I understand it. It's the insurance policy's\ndecision.\nMR. ROBERTS: Or someone to whom that discretion\nhas been delegated under ERISA, and there's a provision in\nERISA that allows them to say, this is the entity that is\ngoing to make the final decision. Under 503, that is a\nfiduciary decision, the final denial or grant of benefits.\nThat's the Federal remedy.\nThe State remedy is, the independent external\nreviewer makes his or her decision, and that decision is\nbinding and final. Those are two very different remedies,\nERISA's remedies are supposed to be exclusive, and the\ndecision below undermining that exclusivity should be\nreversed.\nQUESTION: Mr. Roberts, before you sit down,\nwould you just give me a moment of your views on whether\nor not it's appropriate to regard the HMO as an insurance\ncompany?\nMR. ROBERTS: The HMO is properly regarded as an\ninsurance company when it is engaged in the business of\ninsurance. Just because it's an insurance company doesn't\nmean that all of its activities, including claims\nprocessing, for example, are necessarily the business of\ninsurance.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Roberts.\nMr. Albers, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL P. ALBERS\nMR. ALBERS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIllinois section 4-10 is an insurance law that\ndoes not conflict with ERISA section 502 or this Court's\ndecision in Pilot Life, and therefore it is enforceable to\nprotect the interests of Illinois Insureds like Deborah\nMoran.\nQUESTION: Does the Illinois law provide for\nreview in Illinois State courts?\nMR. ALBERS: The Illinois law does not provide\none way or the other. Section 4-10 does not say that.\nThis case was reviewed and was enforced by the Seventh\nCircuit as a 502 action.\nQUESTION: But the action was originally brought\nin State court, was it not?\nMR.ALBERS: I originally brought the action in\nState court to enforce the independent review because the\ninsurer was refusing to provide any independent review at\nall, and the two parts of the statute, the requirement\nthat there be medical necessity, this review and then the\nactual enforcement of the decision, were parsed at the\ndistrict court level and in the Seventh Circuit. Judge\nConlon initially remanded the case after it was removed,\nfinding that the medical necessity portion of the statute\ndid not offend Pilot Life or section 502.\nBack in State court, Judge Kinnaird in Chancery\nfound that medical necessity did not offend 502 and\nordered a medical necessity review. The medical necessity\nreview determined that the procedure was medically\nnecessary. It was then -- I then sought payment of the\nbenefit, and that was removed to Federal court and Judge\nConlon found that was a 502 action.\nQUESTION: If the Seventh Circuit view is upheld\nby this Court, in the future would actions lie in State\ncourt to enforce this, or just under 502?\nMR. ALBERS: I think consistent with the Court's\n502 ruling in Pilot Life, it would be a 502 action to seek\nbenefits. I think there's a different question with\nrespect to whether it was just the enforcement of the\nstatute which requires medical necessity. I don't think\nthat then you're seeking the benefit, and I submit that it\nwas perfectly appropriate to send this case back to State\ncourt for that determination and that ruling, but\nultimately, to get the benefit, I would suggest that that\nwould have to come under 502, under the Court's reasoning\nin Pilot Life.\nThis case does not conflict with Pilot Life, as\npetitioner suggests. In addressing the conflict issue\nwhich has been raised, which I think is central to the\ndecision the Court needs to make, I think the Court should\nconsider the burdens that petitioner must meet to show\nthat conflict. ERISA preemption is a defense.\nQUESTION: Could the State provide for\nliquidated damages, do you think --\nMR. ALBERS: You mean, damages other than the\nbenefit itself?\nQUESTION: -- under the reinsurance regulation\nexception?\nMR. ALBERS: You mean, other than the benefit\nitself, Your Honor?\nQUESTION: Uh-huh.\nMR. ALBERS: I would submit, under your -- the\nCourt's ruling which you wrote in Pilot Life, that it\nwould probably be inappropriate to go beyond the specific\ndamages that are permitted in ERISA, which is recovery of\nthe benefit, and I think then under the statute you're\npermitted to recover interest and attorneys's fees, and\nthat is all Deborah Moran has ever sought in this case was\nthe benefit that she was entitled to under the Illinois\nstatute for what was determined to be a medically\nnecessary procedure, which also saved her right arm.\nQUESTION: How --\nQUESTION: That's true, but the question is, who\nis to decide she has gotten what she was supposed to get,\nand the claim here is that that was supposed to be decided\npursuant to one system of review, and the State has\nsubstituted a totally different --\nMR. ALBERS: And under 514(b), the Savings\nClause, the State has the right to do that. That does not\noffend ERISA in any way. Section 503 --\nQUESTION: Isn't that what Pilot Life was all\nabout?\nMR. ALBERS: Pilot Life did not talk about who\nthe decision-maker would be. Pilot Life talked about the\nenforcement of the benefit had to be in Federal court\nunder 502. Pilot Life was a State common law cause of\naction which was not an insurance law in bad faith and in\ncontract which sought compensatory and punitive damages\nbeyond the benefit. The Court said, you can't do that,\nbecause that offends 502 and, by the way, all --\nQUESTION: I see, so you think all it meant was\nthe last shot has to be in Federal court.\nMR. ALBERS: I think it --\nQUESTION: I assume the State could provide that\nall of these contract claims would be first reviewed in\nState court so long as it further provides that the\nultimate judgment of the State court would only be\nenforceable by suit in Federal court. Would that be okay?\nMR. ALBERS: I think that's -- if the State law\nprovided for a judicial review in State court, I think\nthat would offend 502. The State law does not provide for\nthat.\nQUESTION: Arbitration is not another means of\nreview? I mean, I --\nMR. ALBERS: No, I don't think arbitration is --\nQUESTION: You don't think you change the\nremedy --\nMR. ALBERS: No.\nQUESTION: -- if you say the remedy is not a\nlawsuit but arbitration? I --\nMR. ALBERS: The remedy --\nQUESTION: I find that a startling proposition.\nSure, arbitration has to be enforced in court, but I've\nalways thought that that's a separate remedy. You ask,\nwhat's your remedy, is it a lawsuit or arbitration?\nMR. ALBERS: And this gets down to the issue of\nwhat a remedy is, and I looked up remedy in Black's Law\nDictionary, and it has two elements. It has the process,\nsome courts have found, and it also has the result of the\nprocess, the enforcement, and I think in Pilot Life the\nCourt was talking about the enforcement, not the means of\nreaching it.\nQUESTION: Okay, consistent with that, in a\nshorthand kind of way we refer to this as an arbitration,\nor as an arbitration decision. Is the independent\nreviewer acting really as an arbitrator in the classic\nsense? I'm assuming that an arbitrator in the classic\nsense listens to evidence in arguments and decides which\nof those evidence and arguments is the better according to\nsome legal standard.\nI have assumed, contrast, that what the\nindependent review here is doing is not only listening to\nother people, but making a medical judgment himself, as a\nphysician. If the latter is true, then it doesn't seem to\nme that it is a classic example of arbitration, but I may\nbe wrong on that, and I don't want to lead you in the\ndirection of an analysis that ultimately will not pan out.\nAm I right in distinguishing true arbitration from this,\nor should we regard this as true arbitration imposed by\nState law?\nMR. ALBERS: I think this is not -- I think\nyou're right, and I think this is not true arbitration as\nimposed by State law. I think the Court found in Pegram\nthat medical necessity decisions contain both elements of\ncoverage determination and elements of a medical --\nQUESTION: What is --\nQUESTION: May I just ask one -- they did in\nthat case, but my concern is, is that true here? In\nother words, what can you tell me about the terms under\nwhich the reviewer acts that says this is, and in part at\nleast, or ultimately, an independent decision by the\nreviewer about medical necessity as opposed to an\nadjudication of which side has the better claim, which an\narbitrator might make?\nMR. ALBERS: The statute itself, 4-10, requires\nan independent review by a physician in the relevant\nspecialty. The statute doesn't provide any further\nguidance with respect to how that review is going to be\ndone. In this case, it was done de novo. It was done by\nsupplying the relevant definition of medical necessity to\na reviewer from the insurance contract certificate, and\nproviding all the relevant medical records.\nQUESTION: Does it matter under Illinois, under\nthe Illinois law, whether there's an adequate treatment\nthat's less expensive?\nMR. ALBERS: No. It's de novo review by the\nindependent reviewer.\nQUESTION: And there's no element in it of\ndetermining whether there's a slightly less effective\nremedy, but with fewer risks and less costly? That's\nirrelevant?\nMR. ALBERS: The statute doesn't address that.\nI think that if that was a part of the definition of\nmedical necessity that was in the insurance contract\ndocument, that would be relevant to the reviewer's\ndecision.\nQUESTION: It can be in the insurance contract,\nthose provisions? It wouldn't conflict with Illinois law?\nMR. ALBERS: Illinois law does not define\nmedical necessity, and so for our analysis we've assumed\nthe only place that the reviewer could go would be to the\nplan documents and the plan document here is -- there is\nno plan document, but the relevant portion of the plan\ndocument is the insurance contract which defined medical\nnecessity, and that's what the reviewer used, and that's\nmy understanding of what they intended.\nQUESTION: And how did they define it? What was\nthe definition?\nMR. ALBERS: There were a variety of factors to\nconsider. What are the available treatments? Are they\naccepted generally in the medical practice?\nQUESTION: But wouldn't the --\nMR. ALBERS: What are the risks?\nQUESTION: I mean, the word necessity sounds\nlike it means you have to have this, and if you had\nsomething that would be equally effective and less\nexpensive, then it wouldn't be a medical necessity. Is\nthis the general understanding of what necessity is, or --\nyou seemed to be saying earlier that it was something\ndifferent.\nMR. ALBERS: I'm not sure I understand.\nQUESTION: I thought that --\nMR. ALBERS: I'm sorry, Your Honor. I'm trying\nto --\nQUESTION: You asked whether, suppose -- I think\nJustice O'Connor asked you, suppose there was effective\ntreatment that was less expensive, would this particular\ntreatment still be a medical necessity, and I thought you\nanswered yes to that question.\nMR. ALBERS: I think that's up to the judgment\nof the independent reviewing physician. He certainly can\ntake into account whether there's an equally efficacious\ntreatment available that's less expensive, and then reach\nhis judgment as to which one he or she believes is\nmedically necessary in that circumstance.\nQUESTION: Could I come back to your colloquy\nwith Justice Souter? The conclusion that you drew is that\nthis is not really arbitration because it's a doctor.\nWhat would it take to make it a remedy of arbitration?\nWhy isn't it arbitration? Suppose a lawyer -- suppose the\nIllinois law read just the way it reads now, except it\nwouldn't be a medical doctor who posses on this but,\nrather, a lawyer who would hear medical testimony from\nboth sides. Would that, putting a lawyer in the shoes,\nconvert it to arbitration?\nMR. ALBERS: My understanding of what Justice\nSouter asked me was that it had the traditional elements\nof what we consider an arbitration, which is, you review\nthe evidence from both sides, they have an opportunity to\nargue, and then you make a decision, and that's what I\nmeant when I said it's not classic arbitration. It is\nlike arbitration, in that you give it to a neutral third\nparty who then makes their review.\nQUESTION: There are no submissions to the\ndoctor in this situation?\nMR. ALBERS: The Illinois law does not\nprovide -- and actually what -- for the specifics of that,\nwhat it does say is that the HMO must set up the\nindependent review mechanism, and there is no authority in\nIllinois on what that must contain or not contain.\nQUESTION: What does it contain? I would find\nit surprising if both sides didn't press upon the doctor\nthere their view of the case. You mean, he just sort of\nwalks in blind and --\nMR. ALBERS: All I can tell you is what happened\nin this case, Your Honor. In this case, the HMO submitted\na series of questions to the doctor, one of which was --\nand it included a lot of the elements that Justice\nGinsburg asked about and Justice Souter asked about with\nrespect to, what are the available treatments, are they\nless expensive treatments, what are the risks, and so on,\nand then he was given all of the relevant medical records\nand given the definition of medical necessity, and he made\na determination that this particular surgery was medically\nnecessary.\nQUESTION: And what about your client? Did you\nput any questions to the doctor?\nMR. ALBERS: We did not, because they covered\nall the questions we thought were relevant.\nQUESTION: You mean, you don't actually want to\nknow how the system works in Illinois? I mean, I'm also\nquite surprised that in the Illinois system, which has\nbeen running for sometime, the patient wouldn't have an\nopportunity to say to the arbitrator, this is my side of\nit, and I would be equally surprised if the doctors who\nthink the other way don't have an opportunity to tell the\narbitrator what their position is.\nMR. ALBERS: There's --\nQUESTION: Maybe I'm always surprised in a lot\nof things --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: So tell me I should be surprised.\nQUESTION: May I go back to Justice --\nQUESTION: What is the answer, though? What is\nthe answer? Do you not -- are you not familiar with the\nsystem in Illinois?\nMR. ALBERS: Your Honor, I'm probably as\nfamiliar as any lawyer in Illinois.\nQUESTION: Fine, if you're as familiar as\nanyone, and it's an ongoing system, and I think the --\nMR. ALBERS: This is the only case.\nQUESTION: This is the only case Illinois has\never had?\nMR. ALBERS: This is the only legal case that's\never been brought under the medical necessity statute.\nQUESTION: No, is this the only case in which\nthe arbitration system has ever worked in Illinois?\nMR. ALBERS: I have no data on that, and the\nState doesn't keep data on that. I did ask --\nQUESTION: Do you accept that this is an\narbitration system, then? Do I understand that in your\nresponse to these questions? You think it is an\narbitration system?\nMR. ALBERS: I think it is an arbitration, and\nthen it goes to a neutral third party --\nQUESTION: Well, I would be amazed if people --\nI mean, am I right to be amazed that you have a system\nwhere people can't make arguments --\nMR. ALBERS: I --\nQUESTION: -- or can't present their point of\nview to the arbitrator? I've never come across such a\nthing, and I take it --\nMR. ALBERS: There's nothing in the law that\nprecludes either one of the parties from --\nQUESTION: Could I ask you a slightly different\nquestion, which is the thing that -- I'd very much\nappreciate, before your time expires, if you could just\naddress for at least a minute or so what I think is a\ndifficult aspect of the case. Why is this insurance?\nThat is, what I'm thinking is that, after all,\nevery company that sells a product with a warranty is to\nthat extent an insurer. Every credit card that says you\ncan return defective merchandise is to that extent an\ninsurer. Every manufacturer, even without a warranty, who\naccepts a product back because it's defective is an\ninsurer.\nYet Congress couldn't have meant in this Savings\nClause to allow States to win conflicts that broadly, so\nwhy does this fall within the kind of insurer that must\nfall within this Savings Clause?\nMR. ALBERS: I think the Court in Pegram -- and\nit wasn't the issue before the Court in Pegram, but said\nthat HMO's act like insurers and transfer risks like\ninsurers, and the Illinois statute defines an HMO as an\nentity that bears risk.\nQUESTION: That's why I gave my example, because\nI wanted you to see that virtually every manufacturer of\nthe United States is a insurer in that sense, and so is\nthis the kind of thing that Illinois has traditionally\nregulated? Is it the kind of thing that other insurance\ncommissioners have tended to regulate? What makes this an\ninsurer different from General Motors?\nMR. ALBERS: Yes to both those questions. The\nHMO Insurance Act is part of the Illinois Insurance Code,\nand I think that insurance law meets all the factors the\nCourt has set forth in its prior decisions with respect to\nwhat constitutes an insurer.\nQUESTION: What about a law firm that handles\nall of the client's legal business, just as an HMO handles\nall of the client's medical business, for a flat fee, and\nthere are firms that do this, especially in the labor\nfield. Many unions just hire a firm to handle all of the\nunion members' legal business for the whole year. Is that\nlaw firm, like this HMO, an insurer?\nMR. ALBERS: I don't think so. That's -- it's\nnot a --\nQUESTION: What's the difference?\nMR. ALBERS: They're not a traditional insurer.\nQUESTION: One is providing legal services, and\nthey don't know how much it's going to come to for the\nyear, and the other one is providing medical services and\nthey don't know how much it's going to come to for the\nyear.\nMR. ALBERS: Well, laws regulating them would\nnot be directed to them as acting as insurers. They're\nnot traditional insurers. They don't meet the common\nsense definition of what an insurer --\nQUESTION: I don't think an HMO does, either.\nI --\nMR. ALBERS: This law is limited to the\ninsurance industry. It's limited to HMO's when they bear\nrisk. It does transfer risk by the very operation of the\nstatute. The Seventh Circuit and the Fifth Circuit agree\nthat this is a statute which regulates insurance, and\nunder this Court's precedents set forth in UNUM, the Court\ndoesn't ordinarily disturb that determination of State\nlaw, so I would -- I respectfully submit that it is an\ninsurance company for purposes of what regulates insurance\nunder 514(b).\nQUESTION: Well, I think the question of what's\ninsurance under ERISA is a Federal question, not a State.\nMR. ALBERS: Yes, that's -- for purposes of\n514(b), but you look at those factors, and one relevant\nfactor is whether it -- whether the State considers it to\nbe an insurer or whether it regulates it as an insurer,\nand in both situations it does here.\nIn conclusion, I would suggest, in response to\nJustice Souter's question to petitioner, that this case\nfalls squarely between the Court's two precedents in\nMassachusetts, Metropolitan Life in Massachusetts and\nUNUM. It contains a procedural element of medical\nnecessity, which is the relevant rule decision, just as\nthe UNUM case determined that the notice prejudice rule\nwas the relevant rule of decision, and it contains a\nsubstantive element, which is a mandated benefit term.\nOnce the medical necessity determination is made, that is\na mandated benefit, and I submit to accept petitioner's\nargument this Court would have to reverse its decisions in\nUNUM, in Metropolitan, and in FMC.\nThe effect -- I think Justice O'Connor raises\nthis issue, what would be the effect of such a ruling on\nvoluntary agreements, and I agree with the proposition\nthat if there's a conflict between independent review and\n502, then the parties couldn't even agree to provide\nindependent review, which would change the practice across\nthe country, because it is being provided by self-insured\nplans and by HMO's.\nUnder 514(b), I submit that this is a State\ninsurance law which looked to harmonize the effect of that\nlaw and affirmed the States can regulate insurance and can\nregulate insurers' medical necessity decisions by leaving\nthose medical decisions to doctors, who should be making\nthem.\nIf there's no other questions --\nQUESTION: May I just ask, on the question of\nwhether it's an insurance company, does the State\ninsurance agency regulate the -- you, in fact, would say\nthe contract between the employer, the sort of unnamed\nemployer that Ray talks about, and the HMO, is an\ninsurance policy?\nMR. ALBERS: Yes.\nQUESTION: Does the Illinois Insurance\nCommission regulate the terms of that policy in any\nrespect, other than this 510 -- this 4-10(c) provision?\nMR. ALBERS: Yes. There's an entire statute\nwhich regulates the terms, and there are, for example,\nminimum benefit requirements for breast cancer treatments,\nfor mental health coverage, there are requirements for\nminimum funding, for reserves, and so on, so there's all\nthe traditional --\nQUESTION: Is the policy that this HMO issued to\nthis employer the same form policy it issues to many other\npurchasers of HMO services from it?\nMR. ALBERS: I can only assume it is. I have no\nevidence on that, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Albers.\nMr. Kneedler, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAEMR.\nKNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nThe claim is made here that the section 4-10 of\nthe Illinois HMO act conflicts with section 502(a). In\nconsidering that claim, it's important to focus on the\nlanguage of exactly what 502(a) addresses, and it is set\nout on page 2 of the petition. 502(a) is empowered --\nQUESTION: 502 of the petition?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Of the petition, yes. It's\nentitled, \"Persons Empowered to Bring a Civil Action,\" and\nthen it itemizes -- it then continues, a civil action may\nbe brought by various persons, and then it goes on to\ndescribe the judicial relief that may be granted, awarded\nin a suit under section 502(a). In other words, the\npreemptive scope of section 502(a) has to do with causes\nof action, civil suits in court, and the judicial relief\nthat may be awarded in court, and that is precisely the\nformulation that the Court used in Pilot Life itself.\nAt the conclusion of the Court's opinion in\nPilot Life, the Court said in distinguishing Metropolitan\nLife, the Court said the Court in Metropolitan Life had no\noccasion to consider the question presented in this case,\nwhether Congress might clearly express through 502(a) an\nintention that Federal, the Federal remedy provided by\nthat provision displaced State causes of action, and\nthat's what the question was about in UNUM.\nHere, section 4 -- excuse me, in Pilot Life.\nHere, section 4-10 of the Illinois HMO statute\ndoes not provide a State cause of action in court, and it\ndoes not provide any remedy or relief beyond what's\navailable under the plan itself.\nQUESTION: Well, you could look at it that way,\nor you could look at it that it provides, the State law\nprovides a cause of action before this arbitrator.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I don't think that's the way\nit --\nQUESTION: You have a claim before the\narbitrator that you haven't gotten what is medically\nnecessary, and the arbitrator shall resolve that cause of\naction just as, under ERISA, the court would have resolved\nwhat the contract said.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I don't think that's the ordinary\nunderstanding of what a cause of action is. A cause of\naction is ordinarily regarded as something that you would\nenforce directly in court.\nQUESTION: So the only remedies that you can't\ndisplace ERISA with are judicial remedies. You can\nprovide for any other kind of relief?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- my point is, that's\nwhat section 502(a) addresses, and the analysis in Pilot\nLife was, what does 502(a) displace, and it's -- another\nimportant feature of Pilot Life is, the Court went through\nthe various remedies that section 502(a) provides, and\ntellingly discussed this Court's decision in Russell in\nwhich the Court held that punitive damages were not\navailable in a suit against a fiduciary based on claims\nprocessing, and the Court said it was not going to allow a\nState cause of action to displace Congress' judgment about\ndamage remedies to allow and not to allow, or have --\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. Kneedler, supposing the\nState provided for a very elaborate arbitration procedure,\nyou know, with right to counsel, specified the way the\nhearing should be conducted and so forth, but didn't say\nwhat would happen. It just said the view of the\narbitrator would be final. That would not be preempted,\nin your view, by 502 because it doesn't contemplate\njudicial enforcement?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, and if it also did not\nprovide for relief beyond that was available in the plan\nitself.\nQUESTION: Well, supposing that after that you\ncould just simply bring an action under 502?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think that would not be\npreempted. In fact, most States -- in this case, Illinois\nhas not tightly regulated the form in which the\nindependent review will occur, and that's consistent with\nthe fact that these are highly judgmental medical\njudgments that medical professionals are looking at.\nQUESTION: That may be, but I want to go back to\nthe Chief Justice's question for a minute. Just assume\nthe absurd example in which the State provided that there\nare going to be sort of 10 steps of arbitration and review\nbetween the initial denial by the plan fiduciary and the\nright to sue, so that someone would be tied up for months\nor years before the person could get into court.\nIn each instance, I'm assuming that it would not\nbe a provision by the State of a cause of action in the\nsense that you have been using it, and yet wouldn't you\nconcede in that case that the State scheme was keeping\npeople out of Federal court for enforcement so long that\nit would, in fact, be in conflict and would be preempted.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think the analysis there would\nbe one of exhaustion of remedies under the plan, including\nthose required --\nQUESTION: And if the exhaustion was exhausting,\nwouldn't you say that the --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, it could be excused, and the\nDepartment of Labor's regulations, and they --\nQUESTION: No, but there would be a preemption\nin that case.\nMR. KNEEDLER: There would be a preemption, but\nthe Department of Labor has addressed that under its\nclaims processing regulations. Section 503 provides for a\nfair administrative processing of claims, and a\nseparate --\nQUESTION: Okay, but doesn't that mean, then,\nthat your answers to the several questions on this should\nbe, it ultimately is a question of degree, this\nrequirement of one step in a review process doesn't reach\nthe point, in effect, of excluding the Federal remedy?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right. It does not stand as an\nobstacle.\nAnother point that the Court stressed in Pilot\nLife was that the Congress struck a balance between the\nprompt and fair processing of claims and suits in court.\nWell, but arbitration and independent review, measures\nadopted by State insurance laws of this sort, are\nprecisely designed to facilitate the prompt and fair and\nexpeditious processing of claims without having to go to\ncourt, so it --\nQUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, doesn't it give you a\nvery different remedy -- I mean, to say that it isn't just\na matter of delay, that isn't the problem here. The\nproblem here is that under the plan, the plan manager's\ndetermination was to be given deference by the Federal\ncourt in deciding whether the plan had been complied with,\nwhereas under the scheme set up by the State, his\ndetermination is not to be given deference. It's this\nthird party who's been brought in who will have the last\nword, and unless that's arbitrary, the court will enforce\nwhat he says. How can that possibly be regarded as the\nsame remedy that ERISA provided?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Nothing in section 502 -- and\nthis Court made this clear in Firestone -- specifies the\nstandard of review. The Court therefore looked to\nbackground principles of law there, in trust law. The\nCourt here might look to background principles of\narbitration law, and also to the terms of the plan.\nState law, as Justice O'Connor pointed out,\nmight well be able to say that that sort of provision for\ndeference to the plan administrator's interpretation of\nthe plan should not be given. That would be a classic\nregulation of State insurance law.\nI want to mention one other point about the\ncharacterization of Pilot Life, and that is this Court's\ndecision in UNUM. The Court there said, whatever the\nmerits of UNUM's view of section 502(a)'s preemptive\nforce, the issue is not implicated here. The Court then\nwent on to say why, because Ward sued under 502(a)(1)(B)\nitself to recover benefits it was not a displacement of\nthe Federal remedy, it was an invocation of the Federal\nremedy to recover benefits, and the Court said in that\ncause of action, the notice prejudice rule of California\ninsurance law supplied the rule of decision.\nSo, too, here, in the cause of action under\nsection 502(a)(1)(B) the State Illinois HMO law supplies\nthe rule of decision, a procedure for an independent\nreviewer to give a quick, prompt review of the claim, and\nthat independent reviewer's decision is -- then supplies\nthe rule of decision that the HMO must comply with, and\nthat is then subject to review in Federal court.\nThe claimant's right to go to court is not\nfrustrated. He can seek review of the arbitrator's\ndecision, or, as we point out in our brief, he can bypass\nthis procedure altogether and can go directly to court,\nand so 502(a)(1)(B) confers rights on claimants, not on\nplans. Nothing in the HMO act stands as an obstacle to\nthe claimant's ability to go directly to court.\nAnother important point about UNUM is, the Court\nmade clear that the processing of claims under an\ninsurance policy, it is an integral part of that insurance\npolicy, but at the same time States may regulate the\nprocess by which claims are adjudicated, and that is\nprecisely what the State has done in this case. It has\nprovided a familiar mechanism. 40 States now have\nprovided for this external sort of review, and it is\ncommon in insurance and medical practice to provide by\nsecond opinions by physicians, so what has been provided\nhere is a very familiar sort of approach.\nOne other point about section 502, it's\npatterned after section 301 of the LMRA, an arbitration\npreceding judicial review is a very familiar aspect of\njudicial review under section 301. Section 301 itself\ndoes not provide for any particular standard of review.\nYou can have de novo breach of contract suits, as in the\nBowen v. Postal Service case we mentioned in our brief, or\nhighly deferential standards of review where the\nparticular issue has been committed to an arbitrable\nprocess.\n502 has the same flexibility. It can have a\ndirect de novo cause of action, as the Court contemplated\nin Firestone, or, where the parties' underlying agreement\nor contract provides for a separate resolution process,\nthere is deference to that process under section 502.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.\nMr. Roberts, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nMy friend Mr. Kneedler again drew the analogy to\nthe Labor Management Relations Act, and we are on common\nground. That's a good analogy. He again stopped one step\nshort. A State law that compelled the parties to a\ncollective bargaining agreement to resolve their disputes\nin a particular manner, even arbitration, would surely be\npreempted under the Labor Management Relations Act and, to\nthe extent this remedy is similar to arbitration, that\nsame conclusion applies.\nWe heard that there's no interference with 502\nbecause beneficiaries have the option. They can use the\nFederal remedy, or they can use the State remedy. The\nexistence of an alternative remedy is, in fact, an\ninterference with section 502, and that test is that\noption with the beneficiary is peculiarly inappropriate\nwhen you're talking about preemption.\nPreemption often is the result of a quid pro\nquo. We're going to give, say, employees a Federal\nremedy, but for the employers we're going to make it\nexclusive. To say that additional remedies are okay so\nlong as the employee can still resort to the Federal\nremedy seems to ignore the typical dynamic of preemption.\nAnd as far as the arbitration analogy goes, the\nfact that the plans may or may not be able to voluntarily\nadopt such a remedy doesn't mean the State can compel it.\nNothing prevented the plan in Egelhoff from voluntarily\nopting the beneficiary designation rule at issue there.\nthat didn't keep this Court from ruling that it was\npreempted. Nothing preempted the plan in Greater\nWashington Board of Trade from saying, we're going to\nprovide the same level of benefit to people on Worker's\nComp as to others, and yet a rule mandating that was\npreempted.\nWe're dealing here with a compelled alternative\nState law remedy that changes completely the standard of\nreview available under the Federal remedy. It's not\nsurprising the results under the two remedies came out\ndifferently. That additional remedy is preempted.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you,\n"
