        "content": "(11:05 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in Number 01-9094, Abu-Ali Abdur' Rahman versus Ricky\nBell.\nMr. Liebman. I think the Court would like to\nhear argument on the questions we asked for supplemental\nbriefing on, as well as your original petition.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES S. LIEBMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. LIEBMAN: Okay. Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThe question I'd like to take up first is why,\nin our view, the unusual circumstances of this case\nsatisfy the two sets of demanding requirements that are on\nthe petitioner here to succeed: 1) he has to show that\nthis is not a successive petition, and 2) he then\nadditionally has to get over the high hurdle that 60(b)\nimposes.\nLet me, though, go first to the jurisdictional\nquestions that Your Honor referred to. This case was in\nthe court of appeals in three ways. It was there because\nMr. -- the petitioner here went into the district court\nand he said, here's my 60(b) motion, I'd like to get 60(b)\nrelief.\nThe district court -- and this is on pages 42\nthrough 44 of the record, of the joint appendix -- said\nvery, very clearly that it was going to make two rulings.\nFirst it said, this is not a Rule 60(b) motion, it is\nsomething else, it's a successive petition. Because it's\na successive petition, you cannot get 60(b) relief in this\ncourt, and I'm going to refer or --\nQUESTION: That's the district court judge?\nMR. LIEBMAN: Right. What I -- but what that\ndid, Your Honor, was to establish a final disposition. It\nterminated all of the petitioner's rights under 60(b).\nThere were no rights left. He told the district court --\nQUESTION: Couldn't he have moved to -- in the\nSixth Circuit -- to remand the case if he disagreed with\nthat?\nMR. LIEBMAN: He did. He did, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Well, but that means that the\ndistrict court's decision was not final.\nMR. LIEBMAN: Well, it was final for purposes of\nthe 60(b), because the -- for purposes of the district\ncourt's view there could be, would be, never could be any\n60(b) relief.\nQUESTION: But it wasn't a final judgment in the\nsense that an appeal could be sought from that, because it\nwas transferred. The district court judge transferred it.\nHe didn't dismiss the 60(b) motion, which I would have\nthought the district court might have done, and then it\nperhaps could have been appealable.\nMR. LIEBMAN: Well, Your Honor, all of that's\nright, and if the belts don't work, let's go to the\nsuspenders. He -- the case was transferred to the court\nof appeals. The court of appeals, however, could not take\njurisdiction over the case unless the prerequisite for its\njurisdiction was established, and if you look at\n2244(b)(3), which is in our appendix to our brief at\npage 1a --\nQUESTION: Page 1a of the blue brief?\nMR. LIEBMAN: 1a of the blue brief, it's very\nclear under (b)(3)(A) that it has to be a second or\nsuccessive application before the court of appeals has any\njurisdiction to do anything with it, so its jurisdiction\nturns on the question whether it was a successive petition\nor not. If it wasn't one, it could not act under this\nstatute and would have to remand back to the district\ncourt. That's exactly what happened in the Martinez-\nVillareal case.\nQUESTION: Well, what -- what does the statute,\nthe AEDPA statute contemplate? That somebody in this\ndefendant's position could have applied to the court of\nappeals for permission to file a successive petition?\nCould that have been done here?\nMR. LIEBMAN: Yes.\nQUESTION: That was not done?\nMR. LIEBMAN: It was not done here because he\nwas saying all along this was not a successive petition,\nif it was, he would not satisfy it. He --\nQUESTION: Go ahead.\nMR. LIEBMAN: He was saying that he did satisfy\nthe requirements of 60(b), that the statute recognizes a\ndifference between certain --\nQUESTION: Well, then, to get an appeal on\nthat -- it sounds so complicated, because the law has\ngotten so complicated with AEDPA, but maybe he should have\nsought transfer back to the district court so the district\ncourt could dismiss it and give something from which an\nappeal could be taken.\nMR. LIEBMAN: Oh but, Your Honor, in Martinez-\nVillareal, I think it's very clear this case is exactly\nthe same as Martinez-Villareal, which this Court ruled\nexpressly on the -- the first question it took up was the\njurisdictional question. What happened there is that the\npetitioner went to the district court, the district court\nsaid, this is a successive petition, I'm transferring, you\ncan't be in this court.\nHe then took an appeal, and he went up on a\ntransfer saying, okay, you've got the transferred motion\nin front of you.\nThe court of appeals actually dismissed the\nappeal saying, we don't have that, but it decided in the\ncontext of the transfer -- and this is very standard\nprocedure here now under AEDPA -- it decided, first\nquestion first, do we have jurisdiction, and it said, you\nknow what, we figured out that we don't have jurisdiction\nbecause this is not a successive petition, so we remand\nback to the district court.\nThis Court then took cert on that question, and\nthe first question it asked was, do we have cert here\nbecause of subsection (e) here, and it said, we do have\ncert here because (e) is very clear. The grant or denial\nof authorization can't come to the Court.\nQUESTION: Well, let's go back to (3)(A) for a\nminute, Mr. Liebman. It says -- as you point out --\nbefore a second or successive application permitted by\nthis section is filed in the district court. You say all\nof that is a prerequisite, I take it, for the court of\nappeals acting, but supposing it's a second or successive\napplication that is not permitted by this section. That\nwouldn't deprive the court of appeals of the jurisdiction\nto say no, would it?\nMR. LIEBMAN: Absolutely. In fact, it has the\nobligation, not just the jurisdiction, to decide whether\nit is a successive petition, because if it isn't, it can't\ndecide the case, because then it's got to start with the\ndistrict --\nQUESTION: Well, but -- so then the first,\nthe -- the first clause of (3)(A) is not really, strictly\nspeaking, entirely jurisdictional.\nMR. LIEBMAN: Oh, well I -- I'm not actually\nsure it's the first clause. It says that the applicant\nshall move in the appropriate court for an order\nauthorizing that. That's what essentially gives the court\nthe jurisdiction, but it's got to be for an order\nauthorizing what qualifies under the statute as a second\nand successive application. This was not a second and\nsuccessive application.\nVillareal --\nQUESTION: Well, that's, of course, part of the\nissue in the case.\nMR. LIEBMAN: Right, but that -- his position\nwas it was not, and therefore the court needed to dismiss\nthat case, and it had two options at that point. It could\neither remand it back, which is the majority approach, or\nit could simply have dismissed, and then he could have\ngone back and filed in the district court again, which is\nwhat a few courts do.\nQUESTION: Mr. Liebman, initially in this case,\nwhen the district judge transferred -- I think it got one\non the State's recommendation that that's how you handle\nthese cases. On behalf of the defendant, did anyone ever\nsay, please enter judgment against me under 60(b), I want\nto make this -- test whether this is a 60(b) case or a\nhabeas case?\nMR. LIEBMAN: That did not happen, Your Honor,\nalthough petitioner understood the court's decision, if\nyou look on pages 41 and 42, to say this -- it expressly\nsays, you cannot file 60(b) here in this court because\nit's automatically successive. You cannot do it. You\nwill never get any rights under 60(b).\nQUESTION: But he could have asked to test that.\nHe could have said, please don't transfer.\nMR. LIEBMAN: He could have, but in -- Your\nHonor, in the Martinez-Villareal case, there was no such\nquestion, no -- no --\nQUESTION: -- see what Martinez-Real has to do\nwith it. I may be missing it, but I thought that in -- in\nthis case, the reason that you cannot appeal from the\ncourt of appeals order refusing to give you permission to\nfile a second habeas is because there's a statute that\nsays you can't come to this court when a court of appeals\nrefuses to give permission on second habeas, and none of\nthat was involved, to my knowledge, in Martinez-Real.\nMR. LIEBMAN: Oh, yes --\nQUESTION: That was a question about whether or\nnot there was a premature decision, or whatever it was,\nand they sent -- the court of appeals sent it back for\nadjudication on this issue.\nMR. LIEBMAN: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: No, it's -- I'm not right?\nMR. LIEBMAN: The provision (e) here says that\nthe grant or denial of an authorization cannot come up to\nthe Court on cert, so the fact that the court there in --\nQUESTION: You mean, Martinez-Real was a grant\nof a petition for second or successive?\nMR. LIEBMAN: No. It was --\nQUESTION:\ndo with it?\nMR. LIEBMAN: What it said was -- and this is\nwhat the Court said in Martinez-Villareal quite clearly.\nThere's a threshold question. The threshold question is,\ndo we have in front of us a second or successive petition.\nQUESTION: In Martinez-Real?\nMR. LIEBMAN: Yes. Yes, yes, yes. That was the\nquestion there, because Martinez-Villareal filed a request\nto --\nQUESTION: And what did the court of appeals say\nwas the answer?\nMR. LIEBMAN: It said, the answer is, this is\nnot a second or successive petition.\nQUESTION: Fine, so then the statute doesn't\napply, I guess --\nMR. LIEBMAN: Oh -- but here the court said --\nif I can be clear about this -- the court said two things,\nand it said them actually in different orders. January 18\norder, it said, this is a successive petition, so now\nwe've got to go to the gateway question of whether you can\nget into court. And then a couple of weeks later,\nactually almost a month later, February 11, it said, you\ndon't meet the gateway requirement.\nQUESTION: I -- I just don't see how you get\naround the statute that says that you can't come here\nafter a court of appeals either grants or denies the\nsecond or successive.\nMR. LIEBMAN: Well, that's what I'm --\nQUESTION: Which wasn't at issue, I take it, in\nthe other case.\nMR. LIEBMAN: That's what I'm trying to say.\nThe very first thing that our cert petition says in this\ncase is, we are not asking for cert from the question of\nwhether or not we meet the gateway requirement.\nQUESTION: Yes, but you -- one doesn't really\nask for cert from -- from a question. One asks for cert\nto review an order, and the order of the court of appeals\nis an order granting or denying.\nMR. LIEBMAN: This order had multiple parts,\nYour Honor. It was actually divided up into multiple\nparts, and what he said was, we are asking for cert from\nsome parts of the order, segmented out and given\nparagraphs. We are not asking for cert from other parts\nof that decision.\nQUESTION: But I think the question is whether\nyou can ask for cert for any -- from any -- part of it in\nview of the provision of the statute that it's not -- I\njust don't -- I'm not sure you can bifurcate the order and\nsay, we're not challenging the denial, we're challenging,\nin effect, the reason for the denial.\nMR. LIEBMAN: Well, this was not a denial. What\nthe statute says -- and I think that's really important --\nis the grant -- I'm reading (e), as we go over from (1)(A)\nto (2)(A). The grant or denial of an authorization by a\ncourt of appeals to file a second or successive\napplication shall not be appealable, but he was not\nappealing the grant or denial. He was appealing the\npreliminary question whether it even was, whether the\ncourt even could have taken jurisdiction of that because\nit had a second or successive --\nQUESTION: That's not a judgment. You -- you\nappeal judgments, you appeal orders, you appeal\ndispositions of the lower court. You -- you don't appeal\nstatements or -- or expressions. You -- you appeal\ndispositions. The only disposition here was the denial of\nthe -- of the application.\nMR. LIEBMAN: Well, Your Honor, then let me go\nto the garter if the belts and suspenders haven't worked\nhere. Petitioner filed a motion in the court of appeals\non his original appeal, and he said, in this appeal, what\nwe would like you to do is, rather than issuing the\nmandate on the judgment that you issued before, which went\nup on cert, we would like you to remand this case in order\nfor the court below to take up these issues, whether on\n60(b) or in other ways, and the court denied that motion.\nIt didn't say why, but it denied that motion\nwithout, expressly in regard to that, doing any kind of\ngatewaying. It just said, we deny it.\nNow, it gives the reason in the earlier January\n18 order that it thought that any post judgment motion in\none of these cases was automatically successive, and\nthat's our first question --\nQUESTION: All right, but --\nMR. LIEBMAN: -- which is, that was a mistake --\nQUESTION: -- on that -- now, this will get to\nthe merits, which I'm sure you'd like to get to --\nMR. LIEBMAN: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- but I thought that the argument\nthat what the court of appeals did was right is roughly\nthe following, that what your client should have done, or\nthe way it should have worked is that the district court\ninitially dismissed -- dismissed on the ground that there\nwas a procedural default -- his initial parts of the\ninitial petition, because, said the district court, he\ndidn't exhaust those, and he can't do it now because the\ntime is up, and your client never appealed that ruling\nin -- the first time.\nWhat he should have done is appealed it. Then,\nwhen he asked for cert and the Tennessee statement came\ndown, he would simply have amended his cert petition and\nallowed us to GVR in light of our case in Tennessee, but\nhe couldn't do that, because he hadn't appealed that in\nthe first place, and therefore he had a final ruling, a\nfinal judgment against him on that issue, and -- and\nthat's why -- that's why what the court of appeals did was\nright, and that's also why it really is a second and\nsuccessive, because after all, you -- it's -- you want a\ndistrict judge to reopen a judgment where he made a\nmistake but you didn't appeal it.\nMR. LIEBMAN: Your Honor, you're absolutely\nright, the premise, which is that Rule 60(b) or related\nmotions in the court of appeals cannot be used to fill the\noffice of an appeal, but there's a very established\ndoctrine there. It came up in the Muniz case, in the\nBlackmon v. Money remand that this Court made, and the\nquestion there is whether it was reasonably available to\nhim at that moment to make an appeal. If it was, 60(b)\ndoesn't come into play, and that's perhaps the most\nimportant question in this case.\nAs of the time Mr. Abdur' Rahman filed his\nbrief, his first brief, opening brief in the Tennessee --\nI mean, in the Sixth Circuit on August 5, 1999, this\nCourt's O'Sullivan decision had come down two months\nearlier. O'Sullivan read a rule of Illinois procedure\nestablishing a discretionary review process that is\nidentical in terms. The State of Alabama has actually\ngone through the terms in its brief and shown that they're\nidentical.\nThis Court said, and I quote, without more,\nthose words are not sufficient to tell us that that\ndiscretionary procedure is outside the ordinary post-\nconviction review process in that State. In this State of\nTennessee at the time, there was that rule, identical to\nthe rule in O'Sullivan, and nothing more in the law. In\nfact, the State concedes in its brief that there was\nnothing in Tennessee law at the time besides the rule.\nSo it was not available to him at that point for\nthe very reason that if he had made that argument, it\nwould have been a frivolous argument because it would have\nrun foursquare into the precise holding of a decision of\nthis Court but two months before. It was only when Rule\n39 came down after the appeal was over, while the case was\non cert, that it said no, no, no, no, the law of Tennessee\nhas been since 1967 that our discretionary review\nprocedure in Rule 11 has never been part of the regular\nand routine State post-conviction review process that we\nhave --\nQUESTION: Mr. Liebman, we've decided a couple\nof cases, one about 30 years ago, Harris against Nelson,\nand then another case called Pitchess, in maybe -- that\nindicate that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and\nparticularly 60(b), do not apply if they conflict at all\nwith the habeas regulations. Now, you don't cite\neither -- either of those cases in your brief.\nMR. LIEBMAN: Yes, we do. We cite --\nQUESTION: I'm sorry. I --\nMR. LIEBMAN: We cite both of them on --\nQUESTION: I didn't see them in the index.\nMR. LIEBMAN: Well, I believe that they are\ncited in our -- well, I guess you're right. I thought we\nhad cited them in the reply brief, but we make reference\nto them where we point out, if I can find it here -- yes,\nwe do, Your Honor. On page 3 of our reply brief, the\nyellow brief, we cite Pitchess and Browder.\nQUESTION: You didn't cite them in your opening\nbrief.\nMR. LIEBMAN: We didn't. The State raised them,\nand we responded to them, and the point is that we\nactually think that Martinez-Villareal and Slack stand on\ntop of Pitchess and Browder, so that they were obviously\ndecided in that same context, and so we cited the more\nrecent case, but in any event in our reply brief, what we\npoint out is, this Court has been very clear to say, is\nthere a conflict between a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\nand the habeas jurisprudence?\nIf so, the civil rule doesn't apply. If not, it\ndoes apply, and as almost all of the courts of appeals\nhave held, there are certain very limited circumstances\nwhen a 60(b) motion does not interfere with the policies\nof the habeas jurisprudence, and in those limited number\nof cases, which includes this one, it is appropriate to\nuse 60(b).\nQUESTION: Well, I thought the Second Circuit\nwas the only case that really supported you --\nMR. LIEBMAN: Oh, no.\nQUESTION: -- in this area as to whether a 60(b)\nrule can be used as a substitute.\nMR. LIEBMAN: No, Your Honor. We don't at all\nstand on the Second Circuit approach to this. The\nmajority rule is that it is a case-by-case analysis.\nIt's -- for example -- the Dunlap case where Judge Posner\nrecently cited all of the lower court opinions, and what\nhe said was, the majority rule is that you have to look.\nYou have to say, is this the kind of 60(b) that avoids the\nproblems that successive petitions are -- cause that we\nhave a rule for? If they do, decide the 60(b) motion. If\nnot --\nQUESTION: How -- how long after the district\ncourt ruled that your claims were not -- not exhausted,\nhow much time elapsed between then and the time you filed\nyour Rule 60 motion?\nMR. LIEBMAN: We filed the Rule --\nQUESTION: 3-1/2 years, wasn't it?\nMR. LIEBMAN: But it was the key point --\nQUESTION: Just answer my question.\nMR. LIEBMAN: Yes. Yes. Yes, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: It was 3-1/2 years?\nMR. LIEBMAN: -- I think 3-1/2 years is the\nright -- but the reason is that the trigger for the 60(b)\nmotion did not come down until June 2001.\nQUESTION: That's true, but the -- now I'm\nthinking, when I read the Sixth Circuit's opinion again,\nthey're not really saying anything different. I think\nthey must mean -- I grant you it can be read either way,\nbut I can't believe that they mean every 60(b) motion no\nmatter what is second or successive.\nIt seems to have arisen in cases where they had\ngood reason to think that the 60(b) motion in that case\nwas second or successive, as in your case they are looking\nat the 60(b) motion as a substitute for a new petition for\nthe reason that it was dismissed the first time as a\nprocedural default, which is the end of this matter.\nMR. LIEBMAN: Well --\nQUESTION: And you didn't appeal it. Rather,\nfor whatever set of reasons, you wait -- I mean, not\nsaying it was your fault, but you wait and go back and do\nthis other thing.\nMR. LIEBMAN: Well, Your Honor, two points.\nQUESTION: So is there -- is there really a\nminority rule at all?\nMR. LIEBMAN: Well --\nQUESTION: Is there some court that really meant\nit, that no matter what, 60(b) is always second or\nsuccessive?\nMR. LIEBMAN: That is the argument that the\nState made here, and it's what the district court said,\nand I can tell you the district court believed it, but it\ndoesn't matter here. I don't want to get off on that,\nbecause we think that whatever the rule ought to be, this\nis the kind of 60(b) motion that is not successive for two\nreasons.\nFirst of all, it is -- it relies upon legal and\nfactual issues that are entirely within the four corners\nof the original proceeding. There's nothing new here.\nThe law, the facts, the evidence, everything is the same.\nSecondly, so that means you're not getting\nout --\nQUESTION: Well, the law's new. I mean, that's\nyour whole point.\nMR. LIEBMAN:\nHonor. It was a declaration of the law as it existed all\nthe way back in 1967.\nQUESTION: Well, all right, I'll --\nMR. LIEBMAN: But it's like the Fiore case, Your\nHonor, where the Pennsylvania Supreme Court said yes, we\ncame down with this interpretation of the State statute,\nand it's true the lower courts had all seen it differently\nup to that point, but we were telling you what the statute\nmeant all the way back, and this Court treated it as,\nquote, old law.\nQUESTION: But then you said you didn't need to\nput it in your -- make a cross-appeal of it because you\ndidn't think it was a tenable argument, so you can't -- I\ndon't -- I don't see how you could have it both ways, to\nsay it was the law all along, but we didn't have to say\nthat that was the law because O'Sullivan --\nMR. LIEBMAN: Well, because --\nQUESTION: -- hadn't come down, or had just come\ndown.\nMR. LIEBMAN: Well, Your Honor, what O'Sullivan\nsays is, if there is a clear statement of law by State\nlaw, by rule or decision that says -- as the South\nCarolina-Arizona provisions cited in this paragraph say --\nthat this particular discretionary review procedure,\nquote, is not available, then the Supreme Court and\nthe Federal courts will respect it, but otherwise, if\nwe don't know what the law is, or it's not clear, then\nwe don't need to respect it, so that was --\nQUESTION: But the appellate -- the appellate\nbrief in this case, the brief in the Sixth Circuit, when\nthe -- when the prosecutor was appealing on the\nineffective assistance of counsel, that was filed before\nO'Sullivan came down, wasn't it?\nMR. LIEBMAN: The State's brief was filed\nbefore, petitioner's brief filed after.\nQUESTION: But the point at which you could have\nfiled a cross-appeal was before.\nMR. LIEBMAN: Oh, Your Honor, that's a very\nimportant point. In our certificate of probable cause to\nappeal we asked the district judge, starting with point 1,\nthe prosecutorial misconduct claims and the procedural\ndefault ruling on them is what we want to take up to the\ncourt of appeals on our appeal, and the district court\ngranted a CPC -- a certificate of probable cause -- on\nthat ground, so that was in the case, it was in the\nappeal, and it was specifically in the mind -- well, it\nwas on the paper that this was the issue that the cross-\nappeal was going to be focused on.\nQUESTION: I thought you didn't appeal. I\nthought you did not appeal the first time -- we're back in\nthe year 2000, or early 2001.\nMR. LIEBMAN: '99, actually.\nQUESTION: '99?\nMR. LIEBMAN: Yes.\nQUESTION: All right. At that time I thought\nyou did not appeal the district court's ruling that you\nhad procedurally defaulted because you hadn't exhausted\nclaims X, Y, and Z, and the time had run.\nMR. LIEBMAN: Well, all I would say --\nQUESTION: Am I right about that?\nMR. LIEBMAN: You're right, but they were in the\ncertificate of probable cause, which is -- you have to get\nthat first, but of course the court of appeals doesn't\nreach your certificate of probable cause.\nQUESTION: No, no, so I don't see how that helps\nyou.\nMR. LIEBMAN: Well, I'm just saying -- well, it\ndoes help in this sense, Your Honor, I think, which is\nthat until O'Sullivan came down and removed the argument\nthat petitioner thought he had, he was planning to raise\nit, but when O'Sullivan came down, after the CPC, but\nbefore he actually got to file his brief, now suddenly\nthe claim that he wanted to raise looked frivolous,\nbecause there was not a declaration of State law on the\npoint.\nThere came to be a declaration of State law, and\nwhen it came sua sponte, it happened to say, because the\ncourt in Tennessee believed that this to be -- was the\ncase -- that the law of Tennessee has always been since\n1967 that this was never part of the post-conviction\nreview process, so --\nQUESTION: Hasn't the Sixth Circuit had an\nopinion on that subject as to whether the rule promulgated\nby the Tennessee Supreme Court was a change, or was it\nnot?\nMR. LIEBMAN: No, it has not. The issue is\npercolating in the lower courts and in the Sixth Circuit,\nbut it has not ruled yet.\nQUESTION: But isn't the --\nQUESTION: The Sixth Circuit did -- the Sixth\nCircuit had held before in a case arising out of Kentucky\nthat if you don't go to the top court, you have not\nexhausted.\nMR. LIEBMAN: They said that in Kentucky based\nupon a Kentucky Supreme Court decision in 1985.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. LIEBMAN: After that point, there are five\nor six decisions of the Sixth Circuit saying that failure\nto exhaust that remedy is failure to exhaust. There is no\nsimilar decision in Tennessee at all in the court of\nappeals before O'Sullivan came down, because the\nunderstanding of practice there, and I know because I\npracticed there at that time, was that this didn't need to\nbe exhausted.\nQUESTION: All right, so isn't the right way to\ndo this, if you were writing it from scratch, we have the\nstatute, you simply say, look, this is what second and\nsuccessives are for. When the law changes just in the\nmiddle of the case, bring a second and successive. That's\nthe rare case where it should be allowed.\nMR. LIEBMAN: The law did not change.\nQUESTION: I mean, I don't --\nQUESTION: But I mean what happened to you.\nIsn't that the case that they're there for?\nMR. LIEBMAN: This -- the second and successive\nis designed to avoid every change in the law being the\nbasis for a habeas petition, but this is not a change in\nthe law. It's exactly -- every petitioner literally\nargued that not only is this discretionary, so it should\nnot be exhausted, but he also said the nature of this\ndiscretionary process shouldn't be exhausted because it's\ndifferent from post-conviction.\nQUESTION: Well, may I ask you one more\nquestion? If it had merely been a change in Tennessee\nlaw, that would not have been a predicate for a second and\nsuccessive habeas, would it?\nMR. LIEBMAN: Absolutely. If it is a change\nof law, it's preempted by the terms of the successive\nstatute which says, we've got a rule here for changes in\nthe law, but that's why this isn't successive, because\nthis is not a change in the law, it's within the four\ncorners --\nQUESTION: But doesn't that foreclose you,\nbecause when you're -- if it's not second and successive\nas defined by AEDPA, that means those are the only kind\nyou can bring?\nMR. LIEBMAN: No, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: Not that you can pull something else\nin under Rule 60.\nMR. LIEBMAN: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: No --\nMR. LIEBMAN: The State agrees if it's fraud,\nif -- Martinez-Villareal, where you've got some State\ncourt decision that changes everything --\nQUESTION: Well --\nMR. LIEBMAN: -- it's got to be --\nQUESTION: -- are you suggesting there was fraud\nhere?\nMR. LIEBMAN: No, no, no, I'm saying, Your\nHonor, that there are certain circumstances where\nsomething that is literally second in time does not\nqualify as a second or successive petition that triggers\n2244, and so we need to know what that is, and the two\nstandards are when it is within the four corners of the\nfirst petition and it completely undermines --\nQUESTION: Now, what's -- what's the authority\nfor that statement?\nMR. LIEBMAN: The authority is Martinez-\nVillareal, Slack, and Calderon, and a huge body of lower\ncourt law that establishes those very, very narrow\ncircumstances where it's so tied into the first petition\nbecause it's the same facts, and it so undermines that\nfirst judgment that there's no judgment left, that you\nneed something to substitute for it, but you don't have a\nsuccessive petition.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Liebman. I take it\nyou're reserving your time?\nMR. LIEBMAN: Yes, I am.\nQUESTION: General Summers.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL G. SUMMERS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nGENERAL SUMMERS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThis Court lacks jurisdiction of this case and\nthe writ should be dismissed, but if this Court concludes\nthat it does have jurisdiction, then the alleged 60(b)\nmotion was a prohibited second or successive application\nbecause it attempted to revisit a prior final adjudication\nbased upon alleged error of fact or law.\nTurning to the jurisdictional issue, the court\nof appeals did not have jurisdiction to review the\ntransfer order. The transfer order was not a final order.\nIt had no jurisdiction in the district court. The\ndistrict court had no jurisdiction over the -- over the\nmotion because it considered it as what it was. It was a\nsecond or successive application.\nQUESTION: Doesn't the jurisdictional issue\nreally turn on whether or not it was a second or\nsuccessive?\nGENERAL SUMMERS: No, Your Honor, it does not.\nUnder the gatekeeping authority of 2244(b)(3) of AEDPA,\nthen the sold province as to determine whether or not a\nsecond or successive application should be granted or\nshould be denied is in the province of the Sixth Circuit.\nQUESTION: But is it strictly in the province of\nthe Sixth Circuit to determine that what it has before it\nis a request for something that should be called a second\nor successive petition within the meaning of the statute?\nIf it is, they've got the final word, but whether it is is\na separate question.\nGENERAL SUMMERS: Your Honor, our position is\nthat you can't separate these two functions. Under AEDPA,\nand under the clear enactment of Congress, when Congress\ngave the court of appeals the exclusive and sole\njurisdiction as to whether or not a -- an application or\nleave for application for a second or successive should be\ngranted or denied, it also gave them the exclusive\nauthority to determine whether it was --\nQUESTION: Well, it didn't do so in so many\nwords. I mean, is your argument that if we split this\nquestion into a) jurisdictional fact, b) the authority of\nthe court if the jurisdictional fact is present, if we\nsplit those two questions that there's going to be\nconstant litigation over the jurisdictional fact, and\nthat's why we ought to read the statute your way, or is\nthere some point of text that is not occurring to me that\nsupports you?\nGENERAL SUMMERS: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Well, it's one or the other.\nGENERAL SUMMERS: Well --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Is it text or policy?\nGENERAL SUMMERS: It's the first one, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nGENERAL SUMMERS: If you were to split those two\ndecisions that the court of appeal has jurisdiction over,\nthen there would be a proliferation of appeal of that\nfirst predicate decision. The decision, the first --\nQUESTION: Well, is it going to be -- I mean, is\nit going to be a difficult question in most cases? I\nmean, this is an extraordinary case. You can see how the\njurisdictional fact question gets raised here, but you\nknow, in most cases is this going to be even a colorable\nissue?\nGENERAL SUMMERS: Your Honor, I don't -- I would\nnot -- I don't think this is, frankly, an extraordinary\ncase to determine whether or not it was a second or\nsuccessive. That is to say that when the Sixth Circuit\ngot the transfer order, they saw just what it was, and\nthat it was a second or successive application --\nQUESTION: Yes, you say that, but the relief\nsought in the 60(b) motion was not relief from the State\ncourt judgment. It was relief from the final judgment in\nthe habeas proceeding because of the Tennessee rule, so\nthey asked to reopen the habeas proceeding, not to file a\nsecond habeas proceeding, and they asked to reopen it, and\njust to have a claim which was undecided in that\nproceeding decided, which had never been decided, so there\nwas not asked for second consideration of a claim, just\nfor the first consideration.\nGENERAL SUMMERS: Yes, Your Honor. What they\nasked for was the relitigation of a claim that had been --\nthat -- that --\nQUESTION: Not of a claim, a first litigation of\na claim.\nGENERAL SUMMERS: They -- they asked for -- they\nasked for the relitigation of a prior final determination,\nwhich we -- we submit and we -- our position is that this\nwas, in fact, a second --\nQUESTION: Did they ask in the 60(b) motion for\nrelief from the State court judgment which would be the\nrelief requested in the habeas proceeding?\nGENERAL SUMMERS: They asked -- I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: Did they ask for relief from the\nState court judgment in the 60(b) motion, or just from the\nhabeas court judgment?\nGENERAL SUMMERS: They asked for relief from\nthe -- from the habeas judgment in the -- in the district\ncourt --\nQUESTION: So then it was a 60(b) motion,\nbecause that's what 60(b) is directed at, where the second\nor successive petition would have asked for relief from\nthe State court judgment.\nGENERAL SUMMERS:\na 60(b) motion, but when the district court received the\nmotion, the district court put substance over form and saw\nclearly that it was a second or successive --\nQUESTION: Well, you call it that, but supposing\ninstead of the -- the Tennessee rule, they had been able\nto demonstrate it -- very improbable, just to give the\nhypothesis out -- that a waiver of the claim for the\nprosecutorial misconduct had been executed and the waiver\nwas false, that there was a fraud on the court in -- in\nhaving that issue precluded from review. Would a 60(b)\nmotion have been permissible then?\nGENERAL SUMMERS: It would be the inherent\nauthority of the -- of the district court to take care of\na situation of fraud on the court.\nQUESTION: By granting a 60(b) motion?\nGENERAL SUMMERS: Well, we don't think it would\neven have to be a 60(b) motion.\nQUESTION: Well, wouldn't that be the office of\na 60(b) motion, to correct that very fraud?\nGENERAL SUMMERS: Fraud on the court that would\nimpugn the very integrity of the prior final adjudication\nwould, in fact, be -- be --\nQUESTION: Well, you go on a different section\nof Rule 60, wouldn't you --\nQUESTION: That's correct.\nGENERAL SUMMERS: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- the section of Rule 60 that\nspecially deals with fraud.\nGENERAL SUMMERS: That's right.\nQUESTION: But in that situation a 60(b) motion\nwould be permissible under that section?\nGENERAL SUMMERS: If there was a fraud on the\ncourt.\nQUESTION: Right.\nGENERAL SUMMERS: But that -- but the fraud on\nthe court would undermine the complete efficacies of the\nproceedings, and that the final judgment wouldn't even be\nfinal, because it would be a sham.\nQUESTION: Well, but you have to file a motion\nand have those facts developed in order to do it, and\n60(b) is the avenue for doing that.\nGENERAL SUMMERS: That -- I mean, that could be\na possible avenue, but that -- but that would only go as\nto the fraud on the integrity --\nQUESTION: And here, the relief requested is\nprecisely the same, namely that one claim was not heard\nwhich was in the case, for a reason that was -- turned out\nto be a gross mistake of the law. They thought the law\nwas exhaustion because of a rule of law, and it turns out\nthey were wrong, so you have -- instead of fraud, you have\na mistake of law.\nNow, maybe that doesn't -- doesn't justify 60(b)\nrelief, but it certainly is a classic case of what 60(b)\nis directed to -- to solve.\nGENERAL SUMMERS: Well --\nQUESTION: Directed at the final judgment in the\nhabeas proceeding as opposed to the final judgment in the\nState proceeding.\nGENERAL SUMMERS: Of -- of course, Your Honor,\nthat argument would fly in the face of the finality\nrequirements of AEDPA, which only -- which only gives\nus -- which only gives us limited circumstances to\nrelitigate --\nQUESTION: But that's true of my fraud case,\ntoo.\nGENERAL SUMMERS: Well, but in the fraud case,\nYour Honor, the fraud on the court means that the original\njudgment is a complete sham, is a complete sham, and there\nwas no --\nQUESTION: And here it isn't a sham, it was just\na mistake. They misread the law.\nGENERAL SUMMERS: Well, they want it both ways,\nif it please the Court. They either say that it was a new\nrule or an -- or an old rule that clarified Tennessee law.\nIf it was a new rule, then that would contravene 2244(b)\nunder AEDPA.\nQUESTION: But that --\nQUESTION: What is the right way to do it? That\nis, in your opinion, how -- suppose we had a -- we have a\ndefendant, a petitioner, a convicted person, and he has a\nwhole lot of claims, and there he is in Federal court and\nhe brought all of his claims up to the State supreme court\nbut for three, then he suddenly thinks, oh my God, I wish\nI'd brought those up, too, and the district judge says,\nwell, you sure had to, so you lost them, because it's too\nlate now. Procedural default. It seems obviously right,\ndoesn't even appeal that part of the case.\nBut while the case is on appeal, this Court\nsays, he didn't have to go to the State supreme court with\nthose three claims if the State supreme court agrees, and\nthen State supreme court then does.\nAll right. Now, there he is. Under the law as\nit is right now, he can make his three points. He can\nmake his three claims, and yet as it was before, he\ncouldn't, and it's right on the case, it's still ongoing.\nWhat's supposed to happen?\nGENERAL SUMMERS: When the --\nQUESTION: In your opinion is there just -- is\nthere no way a person could say, judge, please read the\nsupreme court and the Tennessee court, and you'll see that\nyour ruling was wrong, and believe me, that's right, so\nwhat is he supposed to do?\nGENERAL SUMMERS: A prior final determination --\na prior final determination by the district court as to\nthe procedural default should be conclusive.\nQUESTION: So you're saying he's just out of\nluck, nothing?\nGENERAL SUMMERS: Yes, sir, because --\nbecause --\nQUESTION: It seems terribly unfair --\nGENERAL SUMMERS: Well, but we -- yes, Your\nHonor, but under the provisions of AEDPA there are two\ncircumstances where he could file a second or successive,\nwhich we say is what he has, in fact, done here. One, of\ncourse, is if it's a new claim involving a constitutional\nlaw that's made retroactive by this very Court, or newly-\ndiscovered evidence to show factual innocence, but when\nthat court -- when that district court -- makes a final, a\nprior final adjudication, then that is -- that should\nbe -- that should be final. He should appeal that\ndecision. He should appeal that decision --\nQUESTION: General Summers --\nGENERAL SUMMERS: -- through the normal\nappellate process.\nQUESTION: General Summers --\nGENERAL SUMMERS: He did not in this case.\nQUESTION: You -- are you -- you're making the\ngeneral point that's not peculiar to AEDPA? I -- tell me\nif my understanding is correct -- that 60(b) is not\nsupposed to do service in place of an appeal.\nGENERAL SUMMERS: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: So if a district court rules\nincorrectly, and you didn't appeal that, and then there's\na clarifying decision by some other court that really\nshows the district court was incorrect on the procedural\ndefault, you can't then say, ah, give me the relief under\n60(b) that I could have gotten if I had taken a timely\nappeal.\nGENERAL SUMMERS: Yes, Your Honor. If the --\nQUESTION: And that's wholly apart from AEDPA.\nGENERAL SUMMERS: Yes, Your Honor, that's\ncorrect. If this petitioner had decided that instead, the\ndistrict court found that he had improperly exhausted his\nremedies under State law, that he'd showed no cause of\nprejudice or fundamental miscarriage of justice, that he\nhad procedurally defaulted, and that he, his claim was --\nit was conclusive that he had no habeas relief, if the\npetitioner had wanted to appeal that -- had wanted to find\nout whether or not the district court was wrong -- he\nshould have appealed that case. He did not. Under --\nunder the case law but also under 60(b) doctrine a 60(b)\nmotion is not a substitute for an appeal. He did not\nappeal that adjudication by the district judge. He's out\nof business so far as that's concerned.\nWhat he filed in the district court, the\ndistrict judge got that document, he looked at substance,\nand the district court said, this is a second or\nsuccessive. The only jurisdiction in the world to\ndetermine whether to grant or deny second or successive is\nthe court of appeals. When that court of appeals got that\ntransfer order, there was no termination. They got what\nwas --\nQUESTION: Is it conceivable that a district\njudge might erroneously in some case call something second\nor successive and it really wasn't? Is it ever possible\nfor him to do -- make that?\nGENERAL SUMMERS: Well, human beings, it's\ncertainly possible.\nQUESTION: And if he does make a mistake, what's\nthe remedy for it?\nGENERAL SUMMERS: There could be a motion to\ntransfer in the court of appeals. The court of appeals\nif, in fact, finds that it was improvidently transferred,\ncould transfer it back. That would be that remedy, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: But what if instead -- I gave you a\nfraud example -- instead of that it was a mistake. The\njudge thought that the petitioner had waived the case.\nThey thought there was a document in the file waiving this\nissue and he was just dead wrong, and he said, then the --\nafter the decision -- the final decision in the habeas\ncase, the judge -- the litigant finds out that the judge\nincorrectly relied on a mistaken representation of fact.\nCould he not file a 60(b) to correct that?\nGENERAL SUMMERS: No, Your Honor. If it was a\nmistake of fact, if it did not go to -- to undermine the\nintegrity of that being a final adjudication, no.\nQUESTION: Well, it -- it undermines it in the\nsense that it denied the litigant a hearing on a claim\nasserted in the habeas proceeding, namely, the\nprosecutorial misconduct. He just never got a hearing on\nthat.\nGENERAL SUMMERS: If he were -- if it were\nsomething of the nature of -- of denying him the\nopportunity to have a hearing, or if, in fact --\nQUESTION: That's exactly what it was here, too.\nGENERAL SUMMERS: Well, no, sir. He did -- he\nreceived a hearing. He received a hearing, Your Honor,\nthat -- and in that hearing it was determined by the court\nthat he had improperly --\nQUESTION: He failed to exhaust.\nGENERAL SUMMERS: -- Failed to exhaust --\nimproperly, that he --\nQUESTION: And that ruling was wrong.\nGENERAL SUMMERS: -- failed to show cause of\nprejudice, that there was no miscarriage of justice, and\nthat he was conclusively entitled to no habeas relief in\nthe district court, and that was a conclusive final\ndetermination, and if he had felt like the court was\nwrong, he should have filed an appeal in the Sixth\nCircuit.\nQUESTION: Well, I understand that argument, but\nif -- but I don't understand your position if it was based\non a mistake of fact, rather than a mistake of law. Here\nwas just a clear mistake of law. The parties all\nmisunderstood what the law, as later explained by the\nTennessee court, was. It was -- he did not -- he had, in\nfact, exhausted.\nGENERAL SUMMERS: Your Honor, if he had thought\nthe judge had made a mistake, he should have appealed.\nQUESTION: He didn't think so. He didn't know\nthat 'til Tennessee adopted its rule --\nGENERAL SUMMERS: Well --\nQUESTION: -- which was 2 years later.\nGENERAL SUMMERS:\nTennessee adopted a rule that either is a new rule or an\nold rule is not of much import as far as we're concerned,\nbecause the Rule 39 that he relies upon changed nothing in\nTennessee law --\nQUESTION: Right.\nGENERAL SUMMERS: -- so far as appellate\nprocess.\nQUESTION: But they changed the understanding of\nthe district judge and the litigants. They thought the\nlaw was otherwise.\nGENERAL SUMMERS: Well, I think -- I think the\ndistrict court knew what the law was when he made that\ndecision, but certainly the Sixth Circuit knew what the\nlaw was.\nQUESTION: You think he knew what the Tennessee\ncourt was later going to decide?\nGENERAL SUMMERS: Well, actually, the --\nQUESTION: Because what he did is flatly\ninconsistent with what the Tennessee court decided.\nGENERAL SUMMERS: What the Tennessee court later\ndecided, Your Honor, did not change Tennessee law so far\nas discretionary review at all -- at all.\nQUESTION: But it did demonstrate, did it not,\nthat the district judge was wrong in his ruling on\nexhaustion?\nGENERAL SUMMERS: The district judge was exactly\ncorrect on his decision.\nQUESTION: That's the question. That's the\nultimate question that I think this Court granted cert to\ndecide, but then we discovered that there are all these --\nthis procedural -- the question whether a Tennessee court\nsaying you don't have to exhaust does service for the\nFederal courts. That is, the Federal courts could say\nit's an open question.\nYou have to exhaust the remedies that are\navailable to you. You could have requested review. You\ndidn't request review. We don't care if Tennessee says,\nah, you don't have to, because that's -- that ruling would\nbe made only for purposes of saying, let's get into the\nFederal court. I take it that's your position.\nGENERAL SUMMERS: The decision as to the\navailability of a remedy is a State decision. The\ndecision as to what has been exhausted is a Federal\ndecision, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nGENERAL SUMMERS: The Rule 39 that the\npetitioner relies upon did not change discretionary review\nin Tennessee one iota. As a matter of fact, the Tennessee\nRule of Appellate Procedure 11 says in its comment that\nRule 39 does not change TRAP -- as we call it, TRAP 11 --\nwhatsoever. Discretionary review was in '95, when he did\nnot appeal to the supreme court, as well as in June 28,\n2001, an absolute available remedy under the normal\nappellate processes in Tennessee.\nQUESTION: So on your view, the district court\nwas right when the district court said the first time\naround, sorry, you didn't exhaust.\nGENERAL SUMMERS: Your Honor, our view is that\nthe district court was right in 1998 when he ruled that\nthe claims were procedurally defaulted, and if this\ncase -- if this case were to go back to the district court\ntoday, he would rule that the claims had been\nprocedurally --\nQUESTION: Well, that -- we don't know that\nbecause I think it's an open question whether -- after\nO'Sullivan -- the position taken in O'Sullivan would apply\nwhen the State court says you don't have to exhaust.\nGENERAL SUMMERS: But there's no question\nthat -- there is no question that in 1998, when the\ndistrict court found that the -- that the issues had been\nprocedurally defaulted, and that there had been no showing\nof cause in prejudice, no miscarriage of justice, that\nthat was a conclusive final determination.\nWhat this -- what this petitioner attempts to do\nis to -- under the guise of a post-judgment pleading --\navoid or evade the second or successive restriction. This\nflies in the face of AEDPA, would be a mockery of the\nfinality requirements of AEDPA, and we would submit to the\nCourt that the transfer to the court of appeals was a\nproper transfer, and that the court of appeals properly\ndetermined the gatekeeping criteria was satisfied, the\nwrit should be dismissed or, in the alternative, the\ndecision of the court of appeals should be affirmed.\nQUESTION: Thank you, General Summers.\nMr. Zidlicky, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL J. ZIDLICKY\nON BEHALF OF AMICI CURIAE, STATE OF ALABAMA, ET AL.\nMR. ZIDLICKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI'd like to start by first responding to Justice\nStevens' question, in which he said that the Rule 60(b)\nmotion didn't seek the relief of granting of Federal\nhabeas. It actually did. In the joint appendix in 170,\nthe court -- the petitioner sought relief from the State\ncourt judgment in bullet point -- I believe it's five, but\nin any event, I think underlying that is the question of\nwhether there had been a prior --\nQUESTION: You say the 60(b) motion was directed\nat the State court judgment, is that what you're telling\nme?\nMR. ZIDLICKY: Yes. Yes, Justice Stevens.\nQUESTION: And not at the habeas -- not asking\nthe habeas court to vacate the ruling on the -- on --\ndenying habeas and setting it down for a ruling on the --\non the prosecutorial misconduct?\nMR. ZIDLICKY: For both. For both, Justice\nStevens. He asked for both of those, and I think -- he\nsought to reopen the judgment, and he also sought -- he\nsought in bullet point 5 to -- or, relief from the State\ncourt judgment, and that's in the joint appendix.\nThe question --\nQUESTION: But 60(b) just gets him the first\nstep, and if he succeeds in the first step, then he goes\nfurther and says, okay, relieve me from the State court\njudgment.\nMR. ZIDLICKY: Well, I was just responding just\nto Justice Stevens' point that he didn't seek that relief\nin his Rule 60(b) motion. He actually did, but the -- but\nthe underlying question is --\nQUESTION: But he's doing it simply because he\nis saying, I guess, that's where I'm trying to get to\nultimately.\nMR. ZIDLICKY: What he's trying to do is, he's\ntrying to relitigate a claim that had been adjudicated\nagainst him through Rule 60(b), and this Court said in\nCalderon that you can't -- that the requirements of\n2244(b) can't be evaded, and one of those requirements is,\nyou can't relitigate a claim that has been adjudicated.\nQUESTION: Well, he's not relitigating a claim\nthat's been adjudicated, he's relitigating -- he wants to\nlitigate a claim that had not been adjudicated. He wanted\na ruling on the merits of his claim, which he never got.\nMR. ZIDLICKY: No, Justice Stevens, there was an\nadjudication of his claim. There was an adjudication of\nhis claim by the district court which said his claim was\nprocedurally defaulted --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. ZIDLICKY: -- and that he had failed to\nestablish cause and prejudice, and that --\nQUESTION: Correct, but they didn't get a ruling\non the merits of the claim.\nMR. ZIDLICKY: No, he --\nQUESTION: They just ruled that it was\nprocedurally defaulted because it had not been exhausted.\nMR. ZIDLICKY: Well, that's -- but I don't think\nthat's right, Justice Stevens. In this Court's cases in\nStewart and Slack, the Court made clear that in\ndetermining whether there had been a prior -- the language\nthat the Court had used was whether there had been a prior\nadjudication of the claim.\nadjudication of the claim. This Court's precedent, going\nback to Wainwright v. Sykes, Coleman v. Thompson, and --\nQUESTION: But the adjudication to which you\nrefer is a holding that it was procedurally defaulted\nbecause the -- they had not been exhausted in the Supreme\nCourt of Tennessee. Is that not correct?\nMR. ZIDLICKY: That's correct, Justice Stevens.\nQUESTION: And that amounts to an adjudication\non the merits, but in fact, the merits had never been\ndecided.\nMR. ZIDLICKY: No, it is -- it's an adjudication\nfor purposes of -- it's -- for purposes of determining\nwhether he can come back and file to relitigate the issue,\ncome back and --\nQUESTION: Right, it's an adjudication that has\nfinality, which merits adjudications usually do, but it's\na finality adjudication that does not rest upon any\nfinding about the underlying merits of the claim that he\nwanted to bring for relief. Isn't that clear?\nMR. ZIDLICKY: That's not the test that this\nCourt has adopted in --\nQUESTION: I'm not asking you whether it's --\nI'm just asking you as a descriptive matter --\nMR. ZIDLICKY: I don't -- you're right, Justice\nSouter, he didn't make a determination regarding the\nunderlying merit of the constitutional claim, but --\nQUESTION: Okay, and we use the term, I think --\ncorrect me if I'm wrong, we use the term, merits\ndetermination, to refer to a determination that is\nbinding, i.e., he can't do something back in the State\ncourt and then come back and try again here. We call that\na determination on the merits, but there are two kinds of\nmerits determinations.\nOne is a finding of default which cannot be\ncured. Second is a finding which may involve default, but\nmay involve a determination on the merits of the\nunderlying claim, and this is just a default kind of\nmerits, not an underlying claim kind of merits finality,\nisn't that correct, just as a descriptive matter?\nMR. ZIDLICKY: I think it's correct as a\ndescriptive matter to -- but with one qualification. What\nyou're saying is that there is an exception for -- I think\nin substance what you're saying is, you can continue to\nrelitigate claims of procedural default because they're,\nquote, not on the merits, but I think the way --\nQUESTION: Well, maybe you can and maybe you\ncan't. His argument here is, this is one that I ought to\nbe allowed to relitigate, i.e., to litigate despite a\nfinality judgment, because of something very unusual that\nhappened as a result of the supreme court's rule change.\nWhat he's saying is, this is a special kind\nof -- third kind of case in the middle, and you want to\ntreat this one for 60(b) purposes like a non-final\ndetermination. I think that's the argument.\nMR. ZIDLICKY: Justice Souter, and perhaps\nthis -- this is -- I don't think this is an exceptional\ncase in this regard. When he went back --\nQUESTION: Well, he may be wrong that it's an\nexceptional case, but that's the argument that he's\nmaking, isn't it?\nMR. ZIDLICKY: Well, the argument that he's\nmaking is, he's entitled to relitigate a claim that has\nbeen adjudicated against the --\nQUESTION: No, he's not making that blanket\nstatement. He's saying that in a case like this, in which\nthe finality which is claimed does not rest on a merits\ndetermination, I ought to have a chance under 60(b).\nMR. ZIDLICKY: Well, I do think that this is --\nthis case is fundamentally different than the case in\nStewart and Slack. In those cases, what the court had\ndetermined was, it wasn't a second or successive habeas\npetition. You weren't seeking to relitigate, and the\nreason was because you'd never received an adjudication of\nthe case at all. The court didn't say no to your habeas\nclaim. It said, not yet.\nIn Slack, the court said, go -- go exhaust. In\nStewart, the court said, the case is not ripe. Here what\nthe court -- here what the court -- the district court\ntold him was, they didn't say not yet, the court said no,\nyou're going to lose, and you're going to lose based on\nprecedent from this Court starting with Wainwright v.\nSykes.\nReally what they're asking is for an -- a\nloophole to this -- to the requirement for second and\nsuccessive petitions for procedurally defaulted cases, and\nif that's the loophole, then there's no way to distinguish\nthat from abuse of -- abuse of the writ cases, because in\nboth instances, you can make the argument that there\nwasn't any ruling on the substantive merits, but there was\na ruling, and the one that's important was, he received an\nadjudication, and if he disagreed with that adjudication\nhe should have --\nQUESTION: Could you describe for me what\nportion of Rule 60(b) is still operative with reference to\nmistakes, given AEDPA? Does AEDPA completely supersede\nRule 60(b) with reference to the category of mistakes and,\nif not, how would you characterize or describe for us what\nremains of Rule 60(b)?\nMR. ZIDLICKY: I think what -- the analysis that\nthe Court would have to determine is whether there had\nbeen an adjudication. If later on there's a claim, after\nthe court has decided the issue, that there was a mistake\nof fact or a mistake of law, the question is, are you\ntrying to relitigate the issue, and if that's the case\nthen 60(b) wouldn't apply.\nBut if you're saying that there was never\nadjudication in the first place for the example of a judge\nwho had been bribed in the first Federal habeas\nproceedings, you would say, well, that's not a second or\nsuccessive habeas application --\nQUESTION: As to anything that's been\nadjudicated, the category of mistakes is removed from Rule\n60(b) when AEDPA is in the picture?\nMR. ZIDLICKY: I think if there's been an\nadjudication, and I think that's the sense that -- in your\ndecision in Slack -- that's the underlying issue.\nNow, it -- that doesn't mean that there's no\nrelief. You can -- you can try to seek to file a second\nor successive habeas application, but this Court in Davis\nversus Pitchess made clear that Rule 60(b) is not a way of\ncircumventing the requirements of AEDPA, and you in\nCalderon made clear that what AEDPA prohibits is the\nrelitigation of a claim that had been adjudicated, and\nthat's exactly what we have in this case. There had been\nan adjudication.\nQUESTION: I think -- I think you're saying that\nif there's an adjudication, there's no room for a 60(b)\nmotion predicated on a mistake. That's your submission?\nMR. ZIDLICKY: That is my submission. I don't\nthink there was a mistake here. I --\nQUESTION: I understand, but that's your\nsubmission. In construing Rule 60(b), it simply does not\napply if there's been an adjudication, but my suggestion\nto you is that the only time 60(b) applies is when you've\ngot a judgment you want to reopen.\nMR. ZIDLICKY: Well, Your Honor -- and the\nreason that 60(b) -- you know, one of the arguments that\npetitioner makes here is, they say that, well, these\nclaims will rarely be granted so you don't have to worry\nabout it, but the -- but what AEDPA requires is, it says\nthese claims are -- the -- if you're trying to relitigate\na second or successive habeas application, what it does\nis, it takes that away from the district court completely,\nthe delay in the costs that are associated with that\nrelitigation.\nQUESTION: I agree with everything you say if\nyou are correct in classifying a particular judgment -- I\nmean, a particular claim as a second or successive claim.\nMR. ZIDLICKY: Right.\nQUESTION:\nthat classification does not fit the facts.\nMR. ZIDLICKY: But I think, though, a\ndetermination of procedural default falls in the heartland\nof habeas jurisprudence, and it's the heartland of a\ndetermination that you're not entitled to relief. In\nSlack and in Stewart --\nQUESTION: So in your view, 60(b) necessarily\nhas a much more narrow application in AEDPA cases than in\nother cases, or in habeas cases than in other cases?\nMR. ZIDLICKY: Yes, Justice -- Justice Kennedy,\nI think that's right, and I think the reason why is\nbecause, as this Court explained in Davis versus Pitchess,\nyou can't use 60(b) to circumvent the substantive\nrequirements of --\nQUESTION: Well, what do they really intend in\nCongress if, for example, the court comes up with an\ninterpretation of a statute that shows the defendant\ndidn't commit a crime, and there he is in habeas. He's\ngot a final ruling, denied. Lo and behold the Supreme\nCourt comes up with a case to say, you never committed a\ncrime. He looks at AEDPA. He can't find it's a second or\nsuccessive because it says, constitutional ruling. What's\nhe supposed to do? Nothing? And do you think Congress\nmeant that there was no remedy at all?\nMR. ZIDLICKY:\ndid was, it -- it did identify the criteria that -- that a\ndistrict court would look to in determining -- it defined\nthat criteria, but the one -- the one place that you could\nlook to is, you could then go back to this Court's\noriginal jurisdiction under 2241 for those exceptional\ncircumstances.\nQUESTION: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Zidlicky.\nMr. Liebman, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES S. LIEBMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. LIEBMAN: I would like to direct the Court's\nattention to pages 12 and 13 of our reply brief, the\nyellow brief. On those pages, in the footnote in the text\nthere are a number of cases that are cited. Every single\none of those cases is a 60(b) case in a habeas or 2255\nsituation where 60(b) was granted, relief was granted and\nit was determined that this was not a second or successive\npetition.\nIn each one of those cases, the reason was\nmistake of law, the U.S. Supreme Court or some other court\ncame down with a new decision, and in every one of those\ncases, that issue was not raised on direct appeal to the\ncourt of appeals. It came back on a 60(b). In each case\nthey had to adjudicate the question of whether it was\nreasonable for them not to have raised it in the court of\nappeals at that time, and in each case they did on the\nground that the new decision that came down changed\neverything, and it suddenly made what looked like a\nfrivolous claim at that time into what was not a frivolous\nclaim, but, indeed, one on which there was at least a\nright to adjudication on the merits.\nIn some cases they won, in some they lost when\nthey went to the merits after they got their 60(b) relief,\nbut the fact is that those cases, including this Court's\nGVR in Blackmon v. Money, which was a 60(b) case on a\nsuccessive, or a second, not a successive but a second\nhabeas petition, were cases where they had not been raised\non appeal, but they -- they were determined to be at least\npotentially ones where there was a reasonable basis for\nnot having done it, and frivolousness, not making\nfrivolous claims is such a basis. This Court in Gomez and\nother cases has been particularly emphatic that habeas\npetitioners should not -- especially in capital cases --\nshould not be raising frivolous claims.\nThe second thing I want to point to is that the\n2244(b)(3)(E), which says that there is no -- it not only\nsays the Supreme Court can't take a cert petition, it says\nthat rehearing petitions can't be held in the court of\nappeals, but the court of appeals are unanimous in saying,\nif the question is whether this is a second or successive\npetition, that can be reheard. That's not governed by\n2244(b)(3)(E).\nWe can separate that question out, and we can\ndecide that, and it's exactly the same thing here. The\nkey case there is Mancuso in the Second Circuit, 166 F.3d\n97, so the courts have been separating out those\nquestions, saying if it's a question of jurisdiction --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you,\n"
