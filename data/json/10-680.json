        "content": "(1:00 p.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Case 10-680, Howes v. Fields.\nMr. Bursch.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BURSCH: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThis case raises two issues: The first is\nwhether the right against self-incrimination requires\nthat a prisoner always be Mirandized before being\ninterviewed in isolation about conduct that occurred\noutside the prison. The second is an AEDPA question,\nwhether this Court in Mathis clearly established such a\nper se rule. For three reasons, the answer to both\nquestions is no.\nFirst, for nearly 50 years this Court has\ndeclined to adopt any new per se rule that always\nrequires a Miranda warning, instead considering all the\ncircumstances. Lower court --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Don't you think being in\ncustody itself is a circumstance?\nMR. BURSCH: Sure, it's a circumstance that\ngoes into the all-the-circumstances mix, but --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's all this\n\"all-circumstances missed\"? I thought that our case law\nwas fairly clear that all circumstances is a test for\nvoluntariness. I thought the issue has always been\nunder Miranda: Is the person free to go or not?\nMR. BURSCH: That's correct. We agree that\nthe test --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, since when have we\nimported of the language of voluntariness into the\nMiranda test? And should we be creating yet another\ntest?\nMR. BURSCH: Justice Sotomayor, there are\ntwo separate tests. And I go back just to last term in\nthe J.D.B. case.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, go to the test of\nfreedom to leave.\nMR. BURSCH: Yes. If --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're taken from your\ncell and locked into a room -- and let's change the\nfacts --\nMR. BURSCH: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- and locked in a room\nand said: Talk to me; tell me. You have to tell me\nwhat happened.\nIs that person free to go.\nMR. BURSCH: It would be much more\ndifficult, but the test would be whether a reasonable\nperson in the prisoner's position felt that they were\nfree to go back to their cell in accord with reasonable,\nordinary prison procedures. And that would be the test\nthat's consistent with J.D.B. and, I submit, with every\nMiranda case that this Court has issued in the last 50\nyears.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So, what\nmakes this case different? He's taken from a -- except\nbeing told that he could leave. If he had been taken\nfrom his cell, removed from the prison, his normal\nsetting, taken by armed guards to another building and,\nwith guards at the door, sat down and told talk to us\nabout this incident, why would he think he was free to\nleave? There is one fact I'm taking out of it.\nMR. BURSCH: Well, there --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which is that he was\ntold he was free to go.\nMR. BURSCH: Right. There are a number of\ncircumstances that kind of culminate in what I consider\nto be the two most important. Some of the background\ncircumstances: He was in a room that was not locked.\nIt was a conference room, not an interrogation room with\na bright light. He was not shackled. He was not\nthreatened. He was not physically harmed in any way.\nThe two big ones are, one, that when he started to\nbecome belligerent, the guards told him that if you\ndon't want to cooperate, then you'll have to go back to\nyour cell; you'll have to leave. And that's the exact\nopposite of Miranda custody, where --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There -- as I see the\nrecord, he claims twice he said, I don't want to talk to\nyou. And when he asked to leave at the end, it took\n20 minutes, and they continued the questioning. Doesn't\nthat counter the rest of what you're saying?\nMR. BURSCH: They are two factors that go\ninto the mix, and I'll discuss each one in turn. When\nhe says, I don't want to talk anymore, then he went on\nand kept talking. And you have to consider, well, why\ndid he keep talking? Well, the record shows, I think a\nfair reading of it anyway, that he was trying to explain\nto the officers this timeline that he kept talking\nabout.\nAt the end, when it was a 20-minute delay,\nthere is no contention that that was anyhow inconsistent\nwith reasonable prison procedures. And the fact that it\ncould have been 20 minutes, it could have been 30\nseconds, it could have been an hour, depending on\nprocedures, demonstrates why a per se rule doesn't make\nsense. We should look at all the circumstances.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is a per se rule\nnecessarily what is being argued here? For one thing,\nhe had no choice but to go with the police, right?\nMR. BURSCH: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, it's different from\nsome cases where the prisoner initiates the\nconversation.\nMR. BURSCH: That is a little bit different,\nbut the key facts here are, one, at the beginning, the\nquestioning officers say, you're free to stop this and\ngo back to your cell. Then in the middle, he gets\nbelligerent, and they say, if you don't want to\ncooperate, you have to leave; you have to go back to\nyour cell. Which is, I submit, the opposite of Miranda\ncustody.\nAnd then when he finally invokes his right\nto go back to his cell, it's immediately honored with,\nof course, the 20-minute delay due to prison procedures.\nAnd so, from beginning to end, a reasonable person in\nhis position could have believed they were free to\nreturn. And that's all that Miranda requires.\nIn fact, we have a trial court finding on\nthat, on three of them: One, that he was told he was\nfree to go; second, that he understood he was free to\ngo; and, third, that he was free to go. And that's all\nI --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And it doesn't make any\ndifference that they -- they took him from his cell, he\nwas under compulsion to leave with them and interrogated\nduring the hours when prisoners are ordinarily sleeping?\nMR. BURSCH: Again, I would submit those are\nall circumstances that should go into this\nall-the-circumstances consideration. You know, there\nwere also other things that militated in favor of the\ntrial court findings, such as the explicit instruction\nthat he was free to leave; that he would have to go back\nif he didn't cooperate; that they did honor his request\nto leave, once made. So, these are all the things that\nthe court should look at.\nAnd you can imagine a number of other\nsituations, maybe with facts different than these, where\na per se rule would be wholly inappropriate. You know,\nwhat if they had invited him to come down and he had the\nchoice at the beginning? What if someone was stationed\noutside the door and took him immediately as soon as he\nsaid, I'm ready to go back? It just demonstrates that\nthis isn't the place for a per se rule; that we should\njust follow the same Miranda test that has been applied\nfor 50 years, and that's all the circumstances.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: General, when you say that,\nI took sometimes your brief and the U.S. Government's\nbrief to be saying something more, which is that it's\nnot all the circumstances; it's all the circumstances\nminus circumstances that are attendant upon normal\nprison living.\nSo, are you still arguing that, or are you\nreally arguing an all-the-circumstances test?\nMR. BURSCH: We're not taking quite that\nstrong a position. We're arguing all the circumstances.\nAnd the analogy that I would draw is just like in the\nJ.D.B. case last term, that you would consider not only\nthe age of the suspect, but also the school environment.\nSo, I'm not saying the prison environment is taken out\nof the equation; just that it's not dispositive in and\nof itself, just like this Court held in Shatzer.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So, a court can still\nthink -- when it's doing an all-the-circumstances\ninquiry, it can still factor in something like, you\nknow, it just -- it was going to take him an hour to get\nback to his cell. That's still something that the court\ncan consider along with everything else. Is that right?\nMR. BURSCH: Not only can, but should.\nAbsolutely.\nAnd, you know, one of the benefits of having\na per se -- I'm sorry -- of having an\nall-the-circumstances rule, rather than a per se rule,\nis that it encourages truthful, voluntary confessions.\nAnd this Court has repeatedly recognized that such\nconfessions are an unmitigated social good. That's\nsomething that we want. And you can imagine, again,\nthat there are a variety of non-prison contexts where it\nwould certainly be easier to have a per se rule. You\ncould have done that in J.D.B.\nYou know, it's so coercive to take an\n8-year-old child to the principal's office with an\nofficer and question him, that per se there's always\ngoing to be some child version of the Miranda rule. But\nwe don't do that. Or if you had someone in the hospital\nand they were in such a position that they were\nphysically unable to leave. We don't have a hospital\nMiranda rule. There shouldn't be one in prisons,\neither. We should just take all the circumstances into\naccount.\nAnd I think really the lesson of Shatzer is\nthat we start, Justice Kagan, right where you did, that\njust simply being in prison, being interrogated -- I'm\nsorry -- being in jail alone is not enough. But it's\ngoing to become one factor that we consider in this\nlarger test.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, which way do\nyou think that factor cuts?\nMR. BURSCH: In this particular situation?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. BURSCH: I think it cuts in our favor,\nas the trial court found, and the courts should defer to\nthat for all the reasons I just stated: That he was not\nthreatened, not physically harmed; he was in a\nconference room; door wasn't locked. Of course, the big\ntwo: That when he got belligerent they told him, if you\ndon't want to cooperate, you have to leave. The exact\nopposite of Miranda custody when you say, if you don't\ncooperate, you will not be permitted to leave. And also\nthat when he made the request to go, it was honored\nwithin the amount of time that they would have expected\nper prison policy. So --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Except when they say you\nhave to leave, one way to interpret that or to analyze\nthat might be to say: You're in custody no matter.\nMR. BURSCH: Justice Kennedy, I don't think\nthat's the case because --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And when you say you have\nto leave, that's almost coercion -- coercive of them to\nsay, because he doesn't want to have to go back to the\ncell.\nMR. BURSCH: I don't think that's the case\nbecause, under Shatzer, there's nothing Miranda\ncustodial about simply being in his cell.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Right.\nMR. BURSCH: And if he wants to stay away\nfrom his cell, as it appears to here because he was\ntrying to explain himself, you know, that's one of those\nfactors that militates against a finding of --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I think it makes your\ncase weaker, not stronger, that statement.\nMR. BURSCH: I think it makes it stronger,\nbecause in the typical Miranda case you would say to\nsomeone, if you don't cooperate, we are going to keep\nyou here as long as it takes. And here they were saying\njust the opposite. And the message they sent was\nconsistent with the instructions they gave him at the\nbeginning -- if you tell us that you want to leave,\nwe'll honor that request -- and consistent with what\nactually happened at the end. He said, I want to go\nback, and they honored that request.\nAnd I think one of the other factors that\nyou put in the mix here is that we were dealing with\noutside officers, not inside prison officers. These\noutside officers did not have the ability to impact his\nday-to-day prison life the way someone inside the prison\nwould.\nNow, one other point I want to make about in\nand out of prison is this artificial line that the Sixth\nCircuit drew to cabin its per se rule. They said that\nif the conduct takes place outside the prison, per se\nyou get Miranda; if the conduct that they're questioning\ntalking about was inside the prison walls, we're not\ngoing to do that. And the Sixth Circuit was forced to\nmake that policy decision because, otherwise, prison\nadministration becomes very difficult.\nBut under this Court's precedent and under\nthe Fifth Amendment itself, there is nothing that would\nsuggest that there should be a distinction in the\nMiranda analysis as to the locus of the conduct that is\nbeing questioned about.\nAnd it's possible to have a very serious\nin-prison crime, a murder of another inmate, and a very\nnominal outside crime, petty theft, and, yet, the Sixth\nCircuit would give pure Miranda protection to that petty\ntheft questioning and no protection at all to the person\nwho murdered someone inside the prison walls. And that\njust demonstrates where the Sixth Circuit rule starts to\nfall apart.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The Chief asked you, in\nhis question, which way does it cut? Meaning you seem\nto be advocating a rule that says merely because he's in\nprison is irrelevant, standing alone. I think your\nadversary is saying you can't take out the fact that\nthis person's liberty is restrained from the equation.\nSo, going back to my hypothetical, if you're\nforced to leave the prison, as this gentleman was, and\nput in another room, what presumption should you start\nwith? Shouldn't the presumption be that if you're\nforced to go to another place, that you are in custody?\nMR. BURSCH: Well, Justice Sotomayor, I'm\ngoing to start with the premise. We are not advocating\nthat the prison conditions fall out of the equation\nentirely. They are simply part of the mix that you\nconsider, just like you would consider the school\nenvironment or the hospital environment or a customs\nenvironment.\nWith respect to being taken out to another\nbuilding, so long as a reasonable person in his position\nwould have felt free to go back, that's ultimately the\ndispositive inquiry.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What -- what would make\nsomeone who is forced to go somewhere think that they're\nfree to go back, absent being told?\nMR. BURSCH: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But let's -- what would\nmake any reasonable prisoner who can't move without an\nescort believe that they're always free to go back?\nMR. BURSCH: Well, there are --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Once they're forced to\ngo from point A to point B.\nMR. BURSCH: Right. There are three factors\nhere, and I'll quibble just a little bit with the\nassumption that he was somehow forced to go. It's true\nthey didn't ask him if he wanted to go, but there's also\nno contention that he resisted going and they made him\ngo anyway. What he said is: \"I didn't know where we\nwere going.... I felt like I was in a safe environment\nso I didn't object.\"\nAnd then once he got to the room -- here are\nthe three that I think are the most critical facts:\nThat he was told right at the beginning, just tell us;\nwe'll take you back to your cell when you want to do\nthat.\nSecond, when he got belligerent they said,\nif you don't want to cooperate, you'll go back to your\ncell. And, third, when he asked to go back to his cell,\nthat request was honored within the context of the\ntypical prison administration.\nAnd it's very possible that in his everyday\nprison life, he could be taken over next door for a\nmedical exam, he could be taken over next door for a\nvisitor if that was county policy. So, there's nothing\ninherent about the walk into the next building that\nmeans per se he has to be Mirandized. Again, it's just\none factor that should go into the mix, just like this\nCourt has always done in Miranda cases.\nUnless the Court has any further questions,\nI'll reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. BURSCH: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Anders.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMS. ANDERS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe Sixth Circuit has imposed a per se rule\nthat whenever a prison inmate is isolated for\nquestioning about conduct that occurred outside the\nprison, that inmate is in custody for Miranda purposes,\nregardless of the circumstances of the interrogation.\nBut in the prison context, as in any other, the\ntraditional Miranda custody tests should apply, and the\nquestion should be whether, in light of all of the\ncircumstances, a reasonable person in the suspect's\nposition would have felt free to terminate the interview\nand leave.\nThat is so for three reasons: The first is\nthat the Court reaffirmed, in Maryland v. Shatzer, that\nrestraints on a suspect's freedom of movement are a\nnecessary but not sufficient condition for Miranda\ncustody. In other words, a reasonable suspect whose\nfreedom of movement is restrained may nonetheless feel\nthat he is free to terminate the questioning.\nSecond, there are, in fact, many situations\nin which a reasonable inmate isolated for questioning\nwould feel free to terminate the interrogation despite\nbeing subject to background prison restrictions.\nAnd, third, the Sixth Circuit's per se rule\nhere requires Miranda warnings to be given in situations\nin which the concerns about custodial interrogation that\ndrove Miranda are simply not present. That holding\nimpairs the important truth-seeking function of\ninvestigations by requiring the suppression of voluntary\nconfessions made in noncustodial situations.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose the policeman had\nsaid: I'm taking you away with me for 20 minutes,\nperiod. Takes him away, puts him in a place, asks him\nquestions for 20 minutes. All right? Does he have to\nMirandize him?\nMS. ANDERS: You have to look to the\ntotality of the circumstances in that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, those are the totality.\nMS. ANDERS: -- in that case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I just gave you the\ntotality.\nMS. ANDERS: In that situation, the inmate\nmay not be in custody, because Shatzer established that\nsimply being in prison and subject to normal prison --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. I'm taking you\nto a special room, and in this special room, I'm going\nto ask you questions for 20 minutes.\nMS. ANDERS: You would look to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: There's no other\ncircumstance. That's it. Everything else is the same\nas here, except he added those words. Now what?\nMS. ANDERS: I think he may not be in\ncustody, because --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Not in custody.\nMS. ANDERS: -- again, you have to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: He's only going to be there\nfor 20 minutes.\nMS. ANDERS: You look to what the reasonable\ninmate in that situation would feel --\nJUSTICE BREYER: He would have thought he\ncould leave after 20 minutes.\nMS. ANDERS: You would look to what the\nreasonable inmate would feel, and in that situation, you\nwould look to his experience with the prison, you would\nlook to the circumstances of the questioning, whether\nthey are accusatorial, whether they are pleasant --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMS. ANDERS: -- the location of the room.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, outside -- we walk\noutside, there's a policeman in the street, and he says\nto someone who's a suspect: Come with me; I'm taking\nyou to jail; I'm going to ask you questions for\n20 minutes. He takes him to a barred room; he can't get\nout for 20 minutes. He has to Mirandize him?\nMS. ANDERS: You may have to in that\nsituation, Justice --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's the difference?\nMS. ANDERS: The difference is that the\nperson who is on the street -- their baseline is that\nthey are -- they have complete free will, they have\nfreedom of movement. But when you look at the prison\nsituation, the ultimate question is whether the\nreasonable inmate would feel free to terminate the\nquestioning, and one situation you look to in\ndetermining that are the physical restraints on that\nperson. And when you look at the restraints, you have\nto take into account the fact that the prisoner has a\nbaseline, which is that he has some restrictions on his\nmovement. That's what the Court said in Shatzer.\nAnd so, when you look at the totality of the\ncircumstances, you consider the restraints and the\nprisoner's baseline, but you also consider everything\nelse that happens during the questioning. And so, there\ncould be many situations in which the questioning will\ngo in a manner that tells the reasonable inmate that\nhe's free to leave. So, for instance, the most clear\nexample is when someone is actually told that they can\nleave. But there could be many other examples as well.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Could I ask you a different\nsort of question, Ms. Anders? Putting aside what the\nSixth Circuit did here, if you look back at the initial\nState court opinion, do you read the State court -- do\nyou think the State court is fairly read, could the\nSixth Circuit have fairly read it, as establishing its\nown per se rule, which was the per se rule we rejected\nin Mathis? In other words, that the State supreme court\nrequired some kind of nexus between the prison custody\nand the interrogation?\nMS. ANDERS: I think it's -- I think it's --\nthe State court opinions are somewhat unclear. There\nare some statements that could be taken to be\ninconsistent with Mathis, but immediately after those\nstatements, the State court said, well, it's not enough\nalone for custody that someone is incarcerated on a\nconviction that's unrelated to their questioning, and we\nlook to the fact that the inmate was told that he was\nfree to leave, and he actually felt free to leave.\nSo, I think the best reading of the State\ncourts' opinions is that they did go through the\ntotality of the circumstances, and they did conclude\nthat Respondent reasonably felt that he was free to\nleave in this interview.\nBut, more importantly, I think the Sixth\nCircuit went much further than that and imposed a per se\nrule that says no matter what the questioners do, no\nmatter what a prisoner is told, no matter how free he\nfeels to leave, that person always has to be Mirandized.\nAnd that extends Miranda way beyond its initial\nconcerns.\nVoluntary confessions, this Court has\nrecognized, are an unmitigated good. So, any time\nsomeone confesses voluntarily in a noncustodial\nsituation, the Sixth Circuit's rule, applied to prisons,\nwould say that that person 's confession has to be\nsuppressed, even though it was given in a situation that\ndoesn't implicate Miranda's concerns at all.\nAnd I think the Sixth Circuit's rule really\narose from two assumptions. One was that isolation\nalone is sufficient to create custody in all\ncircumstances. And that can't be the case, because we\nknow that an inmate can be told that he can leave, he\ncan be given an initial choice before he comes along for\nquestioning, he can be interrogated in isolation purely\nbecause he's waiting to be treated in an infirmary.\nThere are any number of situations, I think, where an\ninmate could be isolated for questioning, but he would\nstill feel free to leave.\nAnd going to Justice Sotomayor's question\nabout whether someone in prison necessarily feels\ncoerced, I think that the Court in Shatzer established\nthat background restrictions incident to being\nincarcerated are not in themselves sufficient to create\nMiranda custody. So, in other words, they don't create\nsuch a huge coercive impact that nobody would feel free\nto terminate questioning.\nSo, I think accepting the proposition that\nsomeone in prison is always coerced would lead to a per\nse rule that says no matter how non-accusatorial, no\nmatter how noncoercive that situation is, that person\nwould always be in custody.\nSo --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you're going back\nto confusing coercion issues with custody issues, and I\ndon't know that you have really answered Justice\nBreyer's question. Someone's picked off the street and\ntold you have to go into this room, and questions are\nasked. Wouldn't we assume that that person is in\ncustody?\nMS. ANDERS: I think in either situation,\nyou have to look to the totality of the circumstances.\nAnd so, we know that restraints alone -- the restraints\nof prison aren't enough alone. And so, when you\nconsider the restraints -- when you consider the fact\nthat a prisoner is told he has to go into a room, you\nwould look not only to that fact, but you'd also look to\neverything that happens in the questioning.\nBut then when you go back to consider the\nfact that the prisoner was told that he has to come to\nthe room, you would -- you would look to whether it's a\nnormal prison policy that prisoners always have to be\nescorted places. And so, that would help the court\ndetermine whether --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but he didn't\nchoose to go to that room. He was placed in that room.\nWhat makes him think that if -- if his jailers are\nwalking him somewhere, that he's free to leave?\nMS. ANDERS: Well, I think two points: One\nis that -- the fact that he is asked to -- the fact that\nhe is told he has to go to this room is not the only\ncircumstance of the interrogation. So, certainly, what\nhappens in the questioning can lead a reasonable\nprisoner to believe that he's free to go, even though\nhe's been told he has to go to the questioning.\nSo, if he is told he can leave, if it\nbecomes clear from experience, if there's a prison\npolicy saying that inmates can always leave, if he sees\nthat he can summon the guards -- all of those\ncircumstances have to be taken into account in addition\nto the fact that he was told initially that he has to go\nwith the guard. And the second thing --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If he were out and the\npolice officer said, come along with us, he could say\nno. But here he didn't -- he didn't have that choice.\nMS. ANDERS: That's right. He didn't have\nthat initial choice. But once he got into the\nquestioning, I think this case is a good example of what\ncan happen where the inmate here was told that he could\nend the questioning. And so, the ultimate question for\nMiranda custody is whether the reasonable person would\nfeel free to terminate the interrogation.\nAnd so, in considering all of the\ncircumstances, one circumstance would be that the inmate\nwas told he has to come to the questioning, but another\ncircumstance would be that he was then told once he got\nthere that he could end the questioning.\nAnd so, there are -- there are other factors\nlike that that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it -- is the time\nrelevant, that this was done -- they took him away at\n7:00 in the evening and kept him for 7 hours?\nMS. ANDERS: I think that would be a\nrelevant factor here, too, as would the fact that the\ndoor was partially open, that the -- the questioning was\nnot threatening, there were only two officers.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, they -- that didn't\ndo him any good, because he couldn't get back to his\ncell without being escorted there.\nMS. ANDERS: That's correct. That -- that\nis a -- that's a background restraint of incarceration,\nand in looking at whether that particular restraint made\nthe inmate feel that he couldn't terminate the\nquestioning, you would look both to the fact that --\nthat, as he himself said, it's common sense that inmates\nhave to be escorted to and from places in the prison.\nAnd also --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I wonder\nwhy you just agreed that the 7 hours would be a\npertinent circumstance. It strikes me that that would\nbe a pertinent circumstance on overall voluntariness,\nperhaps, but once you're told you can leave whenever you\nwant, I don't see why it matters at all how long he's\nkept there.\nMS. ANDERS: I think that's exactly right,\nthat -- that, certainly --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, it's not a\nrelevant circumstance on the custody question.\nMS. ANDERS: It is a circumstance within the\ntotality of the circumstances here, but it -- it's --\nany kind of effect that it had on making the inmate feel\nthat he couldn't terminate the question was entirely\noffset by the fact that he was told that he could leave\nmultiple times.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nNow Ms. Jacobs.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH L. JACOBS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. JACOBS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI want to address the issue of whether\nsomeone is free to leave. Recently, there have been\nseveral cases, and Cervantes is one, and I can't\nremember whether it was Alvardo -- Alvarado or J.D.B.,\nwhere the courts have said that in a prison setting the\nstatement that you're free to leave has less\nsignificance than if you're in a -- in the free world.\nSo, I would suggest that when you look at\nthis, that that particular issue, or that particular\nstatement, should not be given the same weight in prison\nas out. And one of the reasons I suggest is because if\na prisoner is told he's free to leave and he's in\ncustody and we know he's in custody because he's in\nprison, he really under these facts does not have the\ncapability of getting up and leaving.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it certainly -- it\ncertainly doesn't mean he can leave the prison, right?\nMS. JACOBS: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's clear, but -- but\nisn't that the only difference? It, certainly, at a\nminimum, means that he can leave this interrogation.\nMS. JACOBS: Prisoners --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But what could it possibly\nmean if it didn't mean you could leave this room where\nyou're now being questioned?\nMS. JACOBS: Let me answer that question by\npointing out that in -- I think it's Georgison and\nCervantes, where there is a button, and the prisoner has\nthe ability to go and press the button and call his own\njailers.\nIn this case, the prisoner had to rely on\nthe sheriff's deputies that were interrogating in order\nto effectuate his freedom. And, in fact, he's testified\nthat he said he wanted to -- that -- I think he said\nthat he didn't want to answer any questions, or he\nwanted to leave, and we don't hear any more about it --\nabout that. Why not? Because at that point, no one\nallowed him to leave because the officers hadn't gotten\nthe answers they wanted.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What is the rule that you\nwant us to adopt?\nMS. JACOBS: The rule I want you to adopt is\nthe rule in Mathis. And it seems that it has already\nbeen adopted, but I think that based on what the --\nJUSTICE ALITO: So, everybody in prison is\nin custody --\nMS. JACOBS: Right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- at all times.\nMS. JACOBS: What -- what Mathis --\nJUSTICE ALITO: So, if you want to question\nanybody in prison about anything --\nMS. JACOBS: No.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- you have to give a\nMiranda warning.\nMS. JACOBS: And I don't think that's what\nMathis said. I think Mathis was very specific, that a\npolice officer coming from the outside to the inside to\ntalk about a crime occurring on the outside must be --\ngive a Miranda warning.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What sense does that make?\nWhy is one more in custody depending on the subject that\nthe police want to question the person about?\nMS. JACOBS: And in certain circumstances, I\nagree with you, that in fact, this Court should hold\nthat when the correction officers are investigating a\ncrime within the prison, then -- and they remove the\nprisoner and they isolate him, take him out of the\ngeneral population, that this Court should then hold\nMiranda is applicable. But when it's voluntary --\nJUSTICE ALITO: So, whenever they --\nwhenever a prisoner is isolated and questioned about a\ncrime, no matter where it occurs, a Miranda warning has\nto be given?\nMS. JACOBS: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: About a possible crime?\nMS. JACOBS: Yes. I mean -- there doesn't\nseem to me to be possible crimes. They always turn out\nto be crimes.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, how is that consistent\nwith the totality of the circumstances test that we've\nalways insisted upon in Miranda cases?\nMS. JACOBS: Well, Miranda -- not all the --\nthere are bright-line rules attached to Miranda, so that\nMiranda itself is a bright-line rule. So, to state a\nbright-line rule I don't think is outside the purview of\nMiranda -- of Miranda law. And it's easier for the\nofficers to apply; it's easier for the courts to apply;\nand there would be more consistency.\nBut, Justice Alito, I want to make sure that\nyou understand that I think if it's on-the-scene\nquestioning about a crime occurring on prison, that I\ndon't think you have to give Miranda rights; that if\nit's voluntary, if the officer -- if the defendant comes\nup to an officer and starts chatting away and starts\nmentioning a crime, that's voluntary. And that's\nconsistent with Miranda. I don't think you really have\nto break new ground --\nJUSTICE ALITO: So, if a prisoner is stabbed\nin the yard and there are 50 prisoners in the yard at\nthe time and the prison guards want to question\neverybody to see what they saw, they all have to be\ngiven Miranda warnings?\nMS. JACOBS: Well, that's an interesting\nfact situation, because some of those people are just\nwitnesses, and they are not necessarily suspects. And a\nguard might be able to say: Well, the people that were\nin this narrow area, they're possible suspects. They're\ngoing to get --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. No, no, that's\nnot the way Miranda works. Miranda suppresses a\nstatement that is adverse to the person who was\nquestioned. And the police doesn't know when the\nadverse statement's going to come. So, you're running\naway from the hypothetical. It just doesn't work.\nMS. JACOBS: I -- I'm sorry, but I had\nthought that what Miranda also said is if -- if it's a\nwitness and you know -- you believe that it's a witness\nand that you're not asking questions that are going to\nincriminate them, that then you don't have to give\nMiranda. Once the point it becomes -- thank you.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well --\nMS. JACOBS: Once the point it becomes\nincriminating, then you give the Miranda rights.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If it's a witness in the\noutside world, the witness is unlikely to be in custody.\nMS. JACOBS: I understand, but I thought\nyour hypothetical had to do with being stabbed in the\nyard.\nJUSTICE ALITO: It does.\nMS. JACOBS: Okay.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So, these -- all these\npeople in your view are in custody, and they all are\nbeing asked questions that may incriminate them --\nMS. JACOBS: If they --\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- and they don't have to be\ngiven Miranda warnings unless they're suspects.\nMS. JACOBS: If they are removed from the\ngeneral population, if they're taken by a corrections\nofficer to a cell where they're going to be\ninterrogated -- they are isolated; it's incommunicado;\nthey're being interrogated by officers; they know\nthey're officers -- that's a Miranda situation.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And when will that not\noccur? In my hypothetical of the stabbing in the yard,\nyou mean that you think the guards are going to say:\nOkay, all you guys stay here; now we're all -- we're\ngoing to question each of you individually with\neverybody else, the 49 other prisoners present.\nMS. JACOBS: I think it -- I think at that\npoint, they're going to put the people that were in the\nyard back in their cells, and then they're going to take\nthem out.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And then they'll be\nisolated.\nMS. JACOBS: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So, they all will get\nMiranda warnings.\nMS. JACOBS: So, they will get Miranda.\nYou're -- you know. And I understand the Court's\nconcern that you might lose -- you might lose evidence,\nbut Miranda is going to protect us from false\nconfessions, which is even a greater cost to society\nthan -- than having to give the Miranda rights.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And where do you get this\nfocus on isolation from? I mean, it's never mentioned\nin Mathis. You said let's go back to Mathis, but that's\nnot a part of Mathis, is it?\nMS. JACOBS: It's -- well, I've got two\nanswers for that: One, it's -- it's the basis of\nMiranda, that when you isolate someone, when you talk to\nthem incommunicado, that that's -- there are compelling\npressures that only Miranda rights will dispel, such as\n-- and let me get -- answer one other question. Telling\nsomeone that they've got the freedom to leave is not a\nsubstitute for Miranda.\nBut now let me go back to Mathis. In\nMathis, the Court said he was in a cell. So, I draw\nthat -- the inference that he was isolated, that he's in\na cell, he's got agents with him, and that that's\nisolation. He's not in a prison library --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that there was\nno discussion of the \"in custody\" point in Mathis. It\nwas assumed that they were in custody, and the issue was\nwhether he could be questioned about a crime other than\nthe one for which he was being held.\nMS. JACOBS: I read Mathis as to say that he\nwas in custody for the -- for the question of the crime.\nThe police officers came in; they have him in a cell;\nit's a police-dominated atmosphere and that they're\nquestioning about a crime that occurred outside the\nprison. To me, that's Miranda.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Justice\nGinsburg is quite right. That -- that was not the issue\nin Mathis. The argument in Mathis was: We're\nquestioning him about something else; so, we don't have\nto give him Miranda warnings. And that's the question\nthat the Court decided. I don't think it had any\ndiscussion about whether -- there was certainly not the\nargument of whether he was in custody or not. The\nargument was this is a different crime; so, we don't\nhave to give you Miranda.\nAnd the Court rejected that. So how does\nthat clearly establish the law on which the court relied\nin this case?\nMS. JACOBS: In Mathis, because he was -- I\nguess it was the lower court thought that because he was\nnot in custody on the crime with which they were going\nto ask questions --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMS. JACOBS: -- that, therefore, you didn't\nhave to give him Miranda.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMS. JACOBS: But I think what the Supreme\nCourt was implying is that it doesn't matter what --\nwhat you're in -- in prison for; you are in custody at\nthat point that you're in the cell with these officers.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you know where\nexactly in Mathis? It's only --\nMS. JACOBS: I'm saying --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- about five pages\nlong. Can you show me where they have that discussion\nabout custody, as opposed to a discussion about what\ncrime is being discussed?\nMS. JACOBS: What I'm saying is that it's\nimplied by Mathis.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Exactly.\nMS. JACOBS: You can infer it from Mathis.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Exactly. It's\nimplied. Inferred. How --\nMS. JACOBS: But that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that clearly\nestablished law?\nMS. JACOBS: Yes. I think it is clearly\nestablished law. It does not break any new ground for\nus to apply it. It does not break any new ground. I\nthink Mathis is a very limited case. The holding\napplies to police officers only, not to corrections\nofficers, and I think that it does stand for the\nprinciple that if you're in custody, and they're talking\nto you about --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, do you agree --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you agree that\nthis is not -- what you want to derive from Mathis is\nnot part of the holding of Mathis?\nMS. JACOBS: I think it's a rational --\nwell, I think it's a rational extension.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's an extension.\nMS. JACOBS: But that doesn't necessarily\nmean that it's new law. It's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought you were going\nback to Miranda itself, which says in custody or\notherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any\nsignificant way.\nMS. JACOBS: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- and I think you\nrepeated the phrase from -- from Miranda that what the\nCourt was aiming at was incommunicado interrogation of\nan individual in a police-dominated atmosphere. The\nquestion is whether the Court has modified what Miranda\nsaid in -- in that regard.\nMS. JACOBS: Which court? This Court or the\nSixth Circuit?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This Court, this Court,\nbecause this Court now seems to assume that it must be\nin custody and not -- not otherwise deprived of action,\nthat being in custody is essential.\nMS. JACOBS: I -- I read that as still being\nthe law, that there are the two clauses; one is you're\nunder arrest, and the other is your freedom of movement\nis restricted such that a reasonable person would think\nthat you were not -- that you were not free to leave.\nI'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg; have I answered\nyour question?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, I think you did.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not sure you\nanswered mine from before.\nMS. JACOBS: I'm sorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do you think\nthat your argument or the decision of the court below\nwas implicit in or an extension of Mathis? Mathis says\nyou don't -- you're not free of Miranda just because\nit's a different crime. How does that answer the issue\nbefore the Sixth Circuit in this case?\nMS. JACOBS: I think that when -- when the\nSixth Circuit is analyzing the State court decision,\nthey're looking at the State court decision, and that\ndecision says if there's no nexus between what you're\nbeing questioned about and what you're in custody for,\nthen you don't have to give Miranda.\nSo, I think the Sixth Circuit found that to\nbe contrary to the language in Mathis.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought what\nwe've been arguing about is not the nexus issue, but\ninstead whether, in light of the circumstances or under\nan absolute rule, there's custody.\nMS. JACOBS: I think we're arguing about two\nthings. I think the Court is going to have to decide\ntwo things, and one is whether the Sixth Circuit's\ndecision about whether the State court's decision was\ncontrary to clearly established law. I think that's one\ndecision. And the other decision is whether there's\ngoing to be this per se rule about whether if you're --\nwhether you're in custody or not and under what\ncircumstances there might be a per se rule.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And what is the\nclearly established law set forth in our cases that\nanswers that latter question?\nMS. JACOBS: Whether -- if there's a per se\nrule? There is not a clearly established law. There\ncould be -- under a rational extension issue, but it's a\nlittle more attenuated. But I don't think that I --\nthat there -- that the Respondent would lose on that\nissue. He would still win because the Sixth Circuit's\ndecision is not wrong; the State court's decision was\ncontrary to the clearly established law of Mathis.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you this? Suppose\nyou have this situation: The police officers go to a\nprison. The -- a prisoner is brought to an interview\nroom, and the police officers are there with the\nprisoner in the interview room. And they say to him:\nWe're investigating allegations that you committed child\nabuse. Now, you're free to leave if you want to, and\nwe'll see that you go back to your cell right away. He\nsays, no, no, I want to explain this; I welcome this\nopportunity to speak to you.\nDo they have to give him Miranda warnings.\nMS. JACOBS: I think they do because I think\nthat telling him that he is free to go is not a\nsubstitute for Miranda. It does not protect the Fifth\nAmendment right, and I think we look to Dickerson, which\nsaid that, even though section 3501 said that you had to\ninform defendants of certain rights, it didn't cover all\nof the Miranda rights. And they said you had to\ncover -- it doesn't necessarily have to be in the same\nlanguage, but you have to cover those rights.\nI think what the Petitioner wants you to\nadopt is a -- is a rule that says telling someone\nthey're free to go is a substitute for Miranda. And it\nisn't. It does not protect the Fifth Amendment right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, their question --\nthe question is, is the person entitled to Miranda\nwarnings? And the argument has been that they're not\nentitled to Miranda warnings unless you're in custody.\nThey say: You want to have a per se rule for in\ncustody; that is, if you're taken out of your cell and\nput in another place under police guard and questioned.\nMS. JACOBS: That's correct. They've taken\nhim from his normal routine. They've exercised control\nover him. They've moved him to another location where\n-- I'm assuming from Justice Alito's hypothetical that\nhe's isolated from the general prison population. And\nthey're starting to tell him they're going to question\nhim about child sexual abuse charges. I don't see how\nyou can't --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, they said: We'd like\nto talk to you about it, but you don't have to talk to\nus; you're free to go. And he says immediately: No,\nno, there's a misunderstanding here; I want to explain\nthis; I am glad you came and asked me about this; I\ndon't want to go back to my cell.\nAnd you say that's coercive.\nMS. JACOBS: I'm -- I think you're now\ndescribing him as being much nicer than I had assumed he\nwas the first time around. If the officer is not being\nconfrontational, I think maybe that's one thing that has\nto be considered. I would think that you have to give\nhim Miranda rights.\nLet me just go over a few issues that I\nwanted to make sure got mentioned. The Sixth Circuit\ndecision -- I got kind of, I think, carried away in my\nbrief. The Sixth Circuit decision very clearly rests on\nthe contrary clause. On page 10a of the Petitioner's\nappendix, they state what their -- they state what their\ndecision is going to be, that is, this is contrary to\nclearly established Supreme Court law. Then they do\nfour more pages to page 14a in which they talk about why\nthe State court decision was contrary. And it's only\nafter they say that -- they give their reasoning; they\nstate their rule -- that they say: But if there's any\ndoubt, then let's look at Shatzer, which was not clearly\nestablished law at the time of this case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I -- since we're\ntalking about the Sixth Circuit decision, what it says\nis -- this is on page 10a. \"The central holding of\nMathis is that a Miranda warning is required whenever an\nincarcerated individual is isolated from the general\nprison population and interrogated, i.e., questioned in\na manner likely to lead self-incrimination about conduct\noccurring outside of the prison.\" Is that correct --\nMS. JACOBS: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- description of\nMathis?\nMS. JACOBS: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought Mathis\nrejected the argument that it depends on whether the\ncrime is the one that you're in prison for or something\nelse.\nMS. JACOBS: I'm sorry. I thought that that\nwas what you said at the end. I apologize. I think\nthat this Sixth Circuit decision makes it very clear\nthat they are talking about crimes occurring outside the\nprison, that they've drawn that kind of dichotomy.\nSo --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well -- the first\npart, \"a Miranda warning is required whenever an\nincarcerated individual is isolated from the general\nprison population\" -- okay -- \"and interrogated\"; i.e.,\nquestioned in a manner or whatever. Now, does that\naddress all of the issues? Is that -- where in Mathis\nis the discussion about whenever an incarcerated\nindividual is isolated from the general prison\npopulation?\nMS. JACOBS: I thought that it was between\n10a, page 10a and page 14a.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. Where in\nMathis?\nMS. JACOBS: This was the question that we\ntalked about before --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMS. JACOBS: -- and what I'm saying is that\nI believe that it's -- that they're implying that and\nthat we're inferring that and that it might not be a\nclearly stated principle, that it's from outside the\nprison, but that it certainly foreshadows -- that it's\n-- that that rule is foreshadowed. So, it's not a new\nrule, but --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If the argument were\nMiranda was not required because this -- this concerns a\ndifferent crime than what you're in prison for here. I\nunderstand the idea that -- under AEDPA, that Mathis is\nclearly established law. The issue here, however, as\nthe Sixth Circuit put it, is a warning is required\nwhenever an incarcerated individual is isolated from the\ngeneral prison population. And I just don't see that\nanywhere in Mathis.\nMS. JACOBS: I again say that this is what\none infers from Mathis.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.\nMS. JACOBS: That's the general principle.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And what you infer is the\nrule that incarceration constitutes custody.\nMS. JACOBS: No. Custody is when the\nprisoner is isolated, incommunicado, outside the general\nprison population, and he's being asked questions by a\nlaw enforcement officer designed to -- that are designed\nto incriminate him. I think it's the traditional --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that is --\nMS. JACOBS: I think it's the\ntraditional Miranda --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that is Shatzer, and\nShatzer was careful to say we've never decided that\nissue.\nMS. JACOBS: I think what Shatzer was\nsaying -- and I know it's hard for me to tell you what\nShatzer was saying since you decided Shatzer. But I\nthink that Shatzer seems to be aimed at correction\nofficials, that whether correction officials -- I think\nShatzer is saying we never decided the whole issue. And\nI think that Mathis decided --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it states in broader\nterms. It says we've never decided whether\nincarceration constitutes custody for Miranda purposes\nand, indeed, have explicitly declined to address the\nissue.\nMS. JACOBS: But I think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It talks about Bradley,\nwhich was definitely where the issue was.\nMS. JACOBS: I think that Shatzer was\nreferring to the whole umbrella of -- of people that\nwould come into the prison, including people that would\nbe in the prison and want to talk to -- to prisoners.\nSo, I think Shatzer was talking about not just police\nofficers but correction officials. I think Mathis\nclears up -- police officers, you come in, you're going\nto talk about something else, you're going to\ninterrogate -- Miranda.\nShatzer finishes this line of cases by\nsaying it applies to -- it will apply to correction\nofficials as long as you take the gentleman out of the\ngeneral prison population and isolate him.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Jacobs, wouldn't it be\nfair to say -- it seems to be me that Shatzer -- excuse\nme. Mathis must have found that Mr. Mathis -- the Court\nin Mathis must have found that Mr. Mathis was in\ncustody. That would be a fair inference for Mathis.\nMS. JACOBS: Yes.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But we have no idea why the\nCourt thought that Mr. Mathis was in custody. That\nwasn't at issue in the case. The Court doesn't talk\nabout any of the surrounding factual circumstances.\nThere might have been a thousand things we don't know\nabout that led everybody to assume that was -- led\neverybody to assume that Mr. Mathis was in custody, not\nthe particular things that the Sixth Circuit mentioned.\nMS. JACOBS: I think that Mathis does\nmention factors that went into the decision about\nwhether he was in custody. They talk about him being in\na cell, not in the prison law library, you know, not in\nthe conference room, not in a visitor's room -- being in\na cell with the officers and he's being interrogated.\nI think that they very clearly are saying\nthat this -- I think it establishes this principle that\nMathis -- that my case, that Howes v. Fields applies.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't the best you\ncan say, not that Mathis found but perhaps that Mathis\napparently assumed that he was in custody, because there\nis no discussion of it?\nThere's no discussion of the custody.\nMS. JACOBS: I agree.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, they give you a\nfactual recital. He was in his cell and all that.\nMS. JACOBS: I just don't think -- I don't\ndoubt that they thought that Mathis was in custody,\nwhich is why they were talking about Miranda to begin\nwith. He's in a cell.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But we don't know why they\nthought Mathis was in custody. It just wasn't an issue\nin the case. Everybody had assumed it.\nMS. JACOBS: And it's not dicta. As far as\nI can tell, it becomes part of the clearly established\nlaw. It was a court --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's dicta? Dicta\nis something that's said that's not necessary to the\nholding.\nMS. JACOBS: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We don't have\nanything that's said about it here.\nMS. JACOBS: But I -- my argument, Justice\nRoberts, is that saying that he's in a cell and that\nhe's being questioned by officers, that that is -- and\nhe's being questioned about a crime, that that is\ncustody and that, from that, there is a principle.\nI would just like to close by saying again\nthat I would ask you to reject the -- the Petitioner's\nproposition that saying someone is free to leave is a\nsubstitute for Miranda warnings, that my client was very\nclearly in custody, that in fact -- and I think this is\nan interesting part of this case -- in a sense, custody\nhad been transferred, that he really was no longer in\nthe custody of the jail but that he had been -- once he\nwent through the J door, was turned over to the\nsheriff's deputies, and the other guards left, that\ncustody had then been transferred. So, I think he's\nclearly in custody, and I think that's one of the things\nthat this Court must look for or include in a per se\nrule, whether -- who is holding this man in custody?\nFurther, the fact that he was told that he\ncould leave is not significant on the facts of this\ncase. The fact that the officers -- and I think Justice\nKennedy made this point -- that the officers were\nyelling at him. They're the ones that have control over\nhim. He does not have the control. The fact that he\nwas missing his medication shows that he did not think\nthat he had the power to change his situation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There's no indication\nthat he told -- that he told the --\nMS. JACOBS: No, I agree there isn't.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- officers that he\nneeded medication.\nMS. JACOBS: No, I agree that there isn't.\nBut I think that this is one of the things that -- that\nwas playing on his mind. And although I understand that\nthis is an objective test and not a subjective test, I\nthink that that lends credibility to his testimony at\nthe hearing. Harrington --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The Ohio court -- or the\n-- I'm sorry. The court below had its own -- seemingly\nhad its own absolute rule --\nMS. JACOBS: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that if you're told\nyou're free to go, that that breaks the chain of\ncustody, whatever that might mean. Assuming -- and the\nSixth Circuit said if you are removed from the prison\nand questioned, you absolutely must be given warnings.\nIs there a middle ground, and what would that middle\nground be? And what would be -- how would that middle\nground affect the outcome of this case?\nMS. JACOBS: I don't believe that telling a\nprisoner that he's free -- that he's free to leave is a\nsubstitute for Miranda. I think you have to get back to\nwhat Miranda was trying to protect. It's trying to\nprotect Fifth Amendment rights, and telling him he's\nfree to leave does not do that. So that that's not\nenough, and that shouldn't be part of the equation, not\na significant part of the equation. Harrington --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you -- you\nmentioned several times, we were talking about Mathis,\nthat, you know, they mentioned he was in -- in a cell,\nright? I've just been skimming it quickly. I don't see\nwhere that's mentioned. Do you know offhand?\nMS. JACOBS: No, I don't, but I really --\nreally did read this case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I --\nMS. JACOBS: And I'm sure that it said he\nwas in a cell.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I did, too. And --\nwell, I'll look at it again. I'm sure --\nMS. JACOBS: Please.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sure it's there.\nAll I see is noting that he was in prison serving a\nState sentence, but --\nMS. JACOBS: But it doesn't -- it should be\ntalking about the officers, the agents in the cell with\nhim.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Let me --\nMS. JACOBS: Just in -- as a final comment,\nI just want to say Harrington v. Richter requires a\nfinding before a writ can issue of an extreme\nmalfunction in the justice system, that certainly where\na State court has decided a constitutional issue on a --\non a Supreme Court law and ignores Supreme Court law,\nthat we really do have an extreme malfunction of the\njudicial system. This Court should affirm the decision\nof the Sixth Circuit and send Mr. Fields back to Lenawee\nCounty for a new trial.\nIf there are no other questions, I'll cede\nthe remainder of my time to the Court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Bursch, you have 6 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BURSCH: I think the hypotheticals today\ndemonstrate how quickly the logic of the Sixth Circuit's\nnew per se rule falls apart when you test it with other\nfacts. Even in the Sixth Circuit's view, you would\nalready make exceptions to that new per se rule if it\nwas in-prison conduct or if it was prison guards as\nopposed to outside guards. In response to questioning\ntoday, Mr. Fields' counsel admits that there must be an\nexception if you have a button that you can press to get\nout, like in Mr. Ellison's situation, the First Circuit\ncase that Justice Souter wrote. She admitted that if\nyou're in a circle of proximity or not in a circle of\nproximity, that that would make a difference. No per se\nrule. That if the situation isn't confrontational, that\nyou need to have an exception for that, or if the\nprisoner initiates questioning.\nAnd you can imagine many other hypotheticals\nthat would similarly create exceptions to what is\nsupposedly a per se rule. And -- and ultimately what\nthis comes down to is Justice Alito's question: If he's\nunder no pressure at all, the prisoner welcomes the\nquestioning -- and I would submit that a fair reading of\nthe record here shows exactly that -- that even then it\nwould be required. And that is a particularly strange\nrule when what we're talking about is not a\nconstitutional, mandated protection but a prophylaxis,\nsomething that's supposed to protect a constitutional\nright, and where the protection isn't necessary, nor\nshould there be a per se rule.\nCounsel also concedes that there isn't\nanything in Mathis that clearly establishes the rule\nthat the Sixth Circuit applied. Maybe it's an\nextension; maybe it's implied. I think it's difficult\nto find either one of those. So, at a bare minimum,\nthis requires reversal under the AEDPA standard.\nI do want to emphasize that the Sixth\nCircuit's per se test does have societal costs. It\nimpedes prison administration, and it eliminates\npotential for voluntary truthful confessions that we all\nwant.\nFinally, the test that we advocate for is\nnot our own per se test, that simply saying you're free\nto leave is not the be-all, end-all, because it's\npossible that officers could say you're free to leave,\nwhile doing something else nonverbally that indicates\nyou are not free to leave. That's why the totality of\ncircumstances test makes the most sense.\nAnd we urge you to go past the AEDPA\nquestion and actually rule on the merits, because we\nthink that would be good guidance for the lower courts\nand for law enforcement officials. And the test that we\nwould propose is that a Miranda warning is not required\nwhen a reasonable person in the prisoner's position\nwould have felt free to go back to his cell in accord\nwith ordinary reasonable prison procedures. That's\nexactly what happened here. We respectfully request\nthat you reverse.\nUnless there are any further questions, I'll\ncede my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
