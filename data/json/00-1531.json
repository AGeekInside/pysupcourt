        "content": "(11:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in No. 00-1531, Verizon Maryland v. the Public\nService Commission of Maryland and United States v. Public\nService Commission of Maryland.\nMr. Evans.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK L. EVANS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. EVANS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nUnlike Mr. Smith, Verizon takes the position\nthat these contracts are, in fact, pervasive and Federal,\nand I'd like to tell you why. The statute, by its terms,\nrequires us to enter into these relationships whether we\nwant to or not. It dictates the subject matter of the\nnegotiations, it provides that the agreement has to be\napproved by the State commission but under Federal\nstandards spelled out in the statute. Once approved,\nmoreover, these agreements are binding not as a matter of\nState law but as a matter of Federal law, which is\nprovided for in 252(a)(1) of the statute.\nQUESTION: 252(a)(1)?\nMR. EVANS: (a)(1), and finally, and in some\nways most tellingly, every provision of an approved\nagreement is like a tariff made available automatically to\nevery other carrier that wishes to adopt them, and the\nCourt upheld that in the Iowa utilities case even though\nit was challenged, but the function of not only the\nagreement's terms but every interpretation of an\nagreement's terms has Federal reverberations. These are\nnot cases that -- with which the Federal Government has\nwashed its hands.\nQUESTION: Well, what about Justice Stevens'\nexample in the previous case, do you pay on Tuesday or do\nyou pay on Thursday?\nMR. EVANS: Mr. Chief Justice, I think that is a\nhard question in terms of the way it was put, and I think\nthe answer, to be consistent, is yes it belongs in Federal\ncourt, and the reason I say that is because just like a\nFederal tariff, where there's a question about the payment\ndate, it belongs in Federal court. That -- the Court has\nheld that in many cases involving Federal tariffs, one of\nwhich we've -- two of which we've dealt with in the brief,\none of which is Thurston Motor Lines, which is in 460 U.S.\nQUESTION: How many of these agreements,\nnegotiated or otherwise, are there Nation-wide?\nMR. EVANS: They're -- they're\nQUESTION: Do you have any idea? I mean, give\nme --\nMR. EVANS: -- limited to --\nQUESTION: -- a magnitude.\nMR. EVANS: I'm sorry. They're limited to the\nboundaries of the State in most instances, although the\nnegotiations in one State have reverberations for the same\ntwo parties in other States, as, for example, with\nVerizon.\nQUESTION: I'm just wondering how many pure\ncontract cases are being dumped into Federal courts by\nyour --\nMR. EVANS: Oh, I see.\nQUESTION: 100,000?\nMR. EVANS: I think the -- I don't have a\nnumber, Justice Scalia. I can say that I don't think once\nthe big issues are resolved there's going to be many of\nthem, and the big issues tend to be like the issue in this\ncase, where the very contract says, on the point in\ndispute, that the parties agree that reciprocal\ncompensation will be paid only to the extent required by\nthe statute, naming a specific section of the statute.\nQUESTION: Yes, but you say every time there's\nany dispute on this contract, even as to what date payment\nshould be made, you run into Federal court.\nMR. EVANS: Well, I mean, yes, but as a\npractical matter the issues will not be brought to Federal\ncourt unless there's a lot of money involved and the\nissues are very important for a variety of reasons. It's\nnot a cost-free proposition to go to Federal court.\nQUESTION: I thought a tariff -- I mean, you're\ntalking about a State railroad tariff?\nMR. EVANS: No, not a --\nQUESTION: No, of course a Federal railroad\ntariff is a Federal question. Nobody doubts that. What\nthey're saying is, here, the structure of this statute is\nto have State commissions run these agreements, period.\nNow, of course, they have to be sure that the State\ncommission satisfies certain Federal standards, which\nmight have been minimal but have turned out not to be so\nminimal.\nMR. EVANS: Well --\nQUESTION: But -- so I don't see how in answer\nto Justice Stevens -- and I think it does create a\nproblem. I don't see how you can put all the -- every\ndetail of this State contract in a Federal court, calling\nit a Federal question, and once that's so, there does\nbecome an issue as to whether Congress bifurcated this and\nsaid, as is true of all other State agencies, you have a\nFederal question, you can go into Federal court. Or said,\nthrow them all in the State.\nMR. EVANS: Well --\nQUESTION: What's your response?\nMR. EVANS: Well, two things, Justice Breyer.\nFirst, the -- if you look back at this Court's Federal\ntariff cases you find that the reason these cases wound up\nin Federal court, even though lower courts in the cases\nhave almost routinely said this looks to us like a run-\nof-the-mill state contract issue, is because the tariff\nitself derives its authority and depends entirely upon the\nFederal statute. That's what makes them Federal statutes,\nbecause of the Federal Government's interest in the whole\nprocess.\nQUESTION: What's your answer to the Jackson\nTransit case, then?\nMR. EVANS: Jackson Transit actually was a case\ninvolving a contract under the Urban Mass Transit Act in\nwhich the Court's analysis proceeded as follows. First,\nit said these are inherently, pervasively Federal\ncontracts -- e agree with that -- and but for a contrary\nindication in the text of the statute or the legislative\nhistory we would view those as Federal issues that belong\nin Federal court, but the Court went on to look first at\nthe text where they found the issue not conclusive, and\nthen to the legislative history where it found that\nCongress made a specific determination that it did not\nwant these cases in Federal court. There is no such\nanalogy in the case here, and in fact, if anything, the\nsuggestion is to the contrary, because when Congress did\naddress the question of jurisdiction, albeit it perhaps in\nnarrower terms than we would have liked. It made clear\nthat the -- that there's jurisdiction in the Federal\ncourts and that, moreover, State courts are foreclosed\nfrom involvement.\nIt's odd to imagine why an issue like the one in\nthis case which could just as well have come up at the\napproval stage, but didn't until the interpretation stage,\nin part because the Internet exploded in the interim. In\none case it goes to Federal court, in the other case it\ngoes to State court. It just doesn't -- it doesn't make\nsense that Congress would have envisioned that outcome.\nThere has been discussion about whether\n252(e)(6) in some way restricts the provisions of --\nexcuse me, the availability of jurisdiction under section\n1331, and we think the answer to that is quite clear not\nonly from the general presumption against that kind of\nrestriction that the Court has articulated from time to\ntime, but also because in this statute Congress actually\nenacted a specific rule of construction in section 601(c)\nof the act which is actually not in the joint appendix and\nnot codified. It appears as a -- in the note to 47 U.S.C.\n152, and what it said there was that nothing in the act\nshould be construed to modify, impair, or supersede\nFederal law unless expressly so provided.\nSo Congress spoke to what inferences could be\ndrawn from a limitation of jurisdiction in 252(e)(6) and,\nmoreover, there -- the Court has -- I mean, the Congress\nhas shown repeatedly, both in this statute and in other\nstatutes, that when it wishes to preclude review in one\ncourt system or another it spells that out specifically,\nas it does in 252(e)(4) here with respects to States, as\nit's done in a variety of statutes that we and the\nGovernment have cited in our briefs with respect to the\nother -- with respect to the medicare act.\nAnd finally, let me just say a word about the\nimpracticality of the bifurcation that I think Mr. Smith\nis striving for here. It would mean a bizarre separation\nwhere a case could come up with an interpretation not only\nof -- not only of the issues we think are binding as a\nmatter of Federal law, but also State law issues that the\nState put in as part of its review, and from Mr. Smith's\npoint of view, if it's interpretive, it all goes right to\nState court.\nIn our view, at least all of the Federal issues\ncome to Federal court, and probably the State issues can\ncome along under supplementary jurisdiction, although\nthere may be a -- may not be possible to name the State in\nthat context.\nQUESTION: You say they're going there under\n1331?\nMR. EVANS: Yes, and this Court once before had\nbefore it a bifurcation scheme that had been proposed,\nactually decided by the Seventh Circuit, as it was in this\ncase, and that's the Bank One case in 516 U.S., and the\nCourt said, this is just too unwieldy and inefficient a\nsystem for us to impute the Congress, even if the language\nwere clear, and here the language by no means even\nsupports the outcome.\nUnless there are further questions, Your\nHonor --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Evans.\nMs. McDowell.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA B. McDOWELL\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER UNITED STATES\nMS. McDOWELL: Initially, I'd like to note that\nalthough this -- in this case the Court granted certiorari\nonly on the question of jurisdiction under section 1331,\nif the Court determines that there is a standing problem\nin the Mathias case, all of the other questions on which\nthe Court granted cert in that case are also presented\nhere, and section 1331 gives the district courts\njurisdiction over claims at least that a State commission\nhas acted contrary to controlling Federal law in\nconstruing or enforcing an interconnection agreement.\nSuch claims arise under the laws of the United States\nwithin the meaning of section 1331.\nQUESTION: Excuse me, how does a State\ncommission act contrary to Federal law in construing an\nagreement that clearly says X, which is contrary to\nFederal law, but I mean, the State commission is just\nsaying what is the truth. How is that acting contrary to\nFederal law?\nMS. McDOWELL: For example, let's say that the\nFCC had issued a different order with respect to Internet\ncalls than it actually did. What if the FCC had said that\nno agreement under section 252 can be construed as\nproviding reciprocal compensation for Internet service\nprovider --\nQUESTION: They wouldn't say that. What do you\nmean, can be construed? Can be enforced, which provides,\nI mean, that's fine.\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, it -- the commission\nconceivably could have said if the contract is silent on\nthe specific subject --\nQUESTION: Oh -- yes.\nMS. McDOWELL: -- or whatever.\nIn any event, one can envision circumstances in\nwhich --\nQUESTION: Okay, but you -- but sure, I mean, if\nyou posit that the Federal regulation says no contract\nshall be construed this way, no matter what it says, no\nmatter how clearly it says that, then I agree with you,\nthe commission would be violating Federal law, but let's\nassume a more normal FCC regulation which just says that\nthis particular disposition is unlawful, even if you do\nagree with it, okay, and all that happens is that the\nState commission says, yes, they're -- that's what they\nagreed to, okay. Now, how does that violate State law?\nMS. McDOWELL: It may not. It may be --\nQUESTION: Federal law, excuse me.\nMS. McDOWELL: It may be the rare case in which\na State commission decision interpreting a negotiated\nagreement will -- can be alleged to violate Federal law.\nI think the questions are more likely to come up with\nrespect to interpretation of terms of an arbitrated\nagreement where the State commission was --\nQUESTION: What is the actual question before\nthe commission? Is it, what did these parties mean by\ntheir agreement, and nothing more than that, or is it\nsomething with more legal overtones to it?\nMS. McDOWELL: This has been sort of a moving\ntarget, because the FCC's orders have been subject to\nreview and have been vacated, so -- but the claim was that\nunder the commission's initial order with respect to\nInternet calls\nQUESTION: No, I meant the rules of the State\ncommission, not the FCC.\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, the State commission, after\nlooking at the FCC's orders and the statute, decided that\nthere was -- the FCC had said it was permissible to adopt\neither rule, to read these agreements either as providing\nreciprocal compensation for these calls or not, and gave\nsome factors that State commissions might look to in\nconstruing agreements, and that is what it did.\nQUESTION: For instance, if you go to a State\ncourt, I'm A, I'm suing B because we have a contract, the\nfinal decision of the State court isn't just necessarily\nthe parties agree to this. They have to go further and\nsay, well, is this -- is there any State law prohibition\nagainst this kind of an agreement, and what are the\nresults in this particular case, does A owe B money. Does\nthe commission, State commission have that broad an area\nto deal with the contracts under this statute?\nMS. McDOWELL: Yes, and certainly it's subject\nto the standards of 252(d) with respect to assuring that\nthe public interest, convenience, and necessity is served,\nand it needs to look at the polices as articulated in the\nTelecommunications Act and by the FCC in its regulations\nand orders, so it's a broader mandate than just looking at\nthe parties' intent, yes.\nWhether this will always present an issue of\nFederal law is, of course, not clear, but where there is a\nclaim that what the State commission has done is contrary\nto the 1996 act, to the FCC's orders under the act, or to\nsome other provision of Federal, constitutional, or\nstatutory law --\nQUESTION: Ms. McDowell, would you clarify what\nyou define as the Federal question in this case? There\nwere a lot of arguments that were made by Verizon like,\nthis is a Federal tariff, in effect, like the State\ncommissioner simply is saying that it is for this purpose\na Federal agency.\nIn your brief, the only thing that I recall --\nmaybe I got this altogether wrong -- was, you said the\nFederal question is an FCC order which would be\ncontrolling, and that FCC order, it turns out, has been\nvacated by the D.C. Circuit, so I'm really left at sea\nabout what is the Federal question.\nMS. McDOWELL: Verizon's complaint, and that's\nin the court of appeals joint appendix, was really quite\nbare bones. It alluded to the FCC order that's since been\nvacated, as you mentioned, and to other principles of\nFederal law, and it just simply alleged that the Maryland\ncommission's decision was inconsistent with Federal law,\nalso with the language of the agreement, and is arbitrary\nand capricious, so it was a very general claim.\nThe district court construed Verizon's claim as\nbeing that the Public Service Commission's order is in\ndirect conflict with a declaratory ruling of the FCC, and\nthat's on pages 1 to 2 of the court of appeals joint\nappendix. I think the principal --\nQUESTION: That ruling has been vacated.\nMS. McDOWELL: That's true. There's now a new\nruling, and that's being litigated in the D.C. Circuit.\nI think as currently articulated Verizon\ncontends that among other things the Maryland commission's\norder is contrary to section 252(a)(1) of the act, which\nrequires these agreements to be binding, and the\nallegation is that the commission has violated that\ncommission by writing additional terms into a party's\nagreement. Whether that is a viable claim or not need not\nbe decided at this point. It's at least a sufficiently\nnonfrivolous claim to state a Federal claim.\nQUESTION: Can I get a clear restatement, if you\nlike, of just what you think -- I mean, on the overall\nquestion I now see three possible ways you could go. Way\nnumber 1 is just what we heard. These contracts are\ncreatures of the Federal law, so much so that everything\nabout them is Federal, they all go into Federal court.\nThe opposite view, no, everything about them goes into\nState court, with one exception. The exception is\napproval or rejection, which is a narrow proceeding that\nhappens once. That puts 98 percent of the cases in State\ncourt for everything.\nChoice 3, the compromise, which is some form of\nwhich I think you're advocating. That would have to be,\nthe Federal questions come into Federal court under either\n252 or 1331. I don't know if it makes any difference, but\nthey're in Federal court, the Federal questions, and where\nthey're all mixed up with State interpretation you have\nthree choices. Each Federal judge is on his own. 1) It's\ntheir supplementary jurisdiction, 2) they have some form\nof abstention, to wait, 3) they do something else. I\ndon't know what it is, all right. But in other words,\nlet's call that a hybrid approach.\nI want to know which of those three positions\nthe Government takes, and I think it's the last one, and I\nwant to know precisely how all this works out.\nMS. McDOWELL: I wish I could tell you precisely\nhow it would work out in every case. When the --\nQUESTION: 5 minutes or less.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: You know your favorite view of it.\nMS. McDOWELL: Yes. When there is a claim that\na State commission order is contrary to controlling\nFederal law, that claim should come into Federal court.\nIf the only claim is a violation of State law, it should\ngo into State court. If there are both kinds of claims,\nthey can perhaps be brought in Federal court under\nsupplemental jurisdiction, but then there's a question of\nthe State officials' sovereign immunity, assuming that\nthey're a party and they haven't waived sovereign\nimmunity, because the State law claims can't be\nadjudicated under -- according to Pennhurst in Federal\ncourt.\nSo the optimal solution in many of these cases\nmay be to bifurcate, or may be to bring the case in State\ncourt, and the State courts, of course, are competent to\nhear these cases as well, but we don't think that Congress\nintended to preclude the opportunity of parties to go to\nFederal court on these claims when they have a Federal\nclaim under --\nQUESTION: Let's put the question the other way.\nWhy would Congress have wanted to provide for a bifurcated\nscheme, which we know is going to lead to all kinds of\npleadings chicanery in order to get it into one court or\nanother court, and we're going to have endless disputes\nabout the pleadings. Why would Congress have wanted that\nkind of a system?\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, it is the system that we\nhave generally, Your Honor. Parties do have the option of\ntaking their claims to State court or to Federal court,\nand Congress may have been --\nQUESTION: But I think you're -- aren't you\npositing a system in which there -- I was going to say,\naren't you positing a system in which, as a system, we\nassume there is going to be some kind of a system of\nutility regulation, and there isn't going to be a system.\nSome utility regulation through contract interpretation is\ngoing to be done in State courts, some of it's going to he\ndone in Federal courts, parties in essentially the same\nsituation are going to be making inconsistent choices, and\nyou're not going to have a resulting coherent system.\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, we already know, of course,\nunder section 252(e)(4) of the act that a number of these\ncases are going to be in Federal court, and what seems\nparticularly irrational is that if there was exclusive\nFederal court jurisdiction over some category of cases and\nexclusive State court jurisdiction over the same sorts of\nissues when they arise in an interpretation context as\nopposed to an approval context, so that seems clearly what\nCongress could not have meant.\nQUESTION: May I ask -- oh, excuse me. May I\nask just sort of a broader question? My recollection is\nthat all the cases we're familiar with so far run around\nas one issue about local calls to the Internet and so\nforth. I have the -- a feeling that there must be a\npattern. All these agreements have a great deal of\nsimilarity, same kind of issue, same kind of litigants on\nboth sides. I wonder if there really is a mountain of\nlitigation out there, or if they only have -- a very few\ntest cases may resolve most of these issues. What's your\nview on that?\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, I think this particular\nissue involves large amounts of money --\nQUESTION: Right.\nMS. McDOWELL: -- tens if not hundreds of\nmillions of dollars, and that's why it's being litigated.\nQUESTION: But are there similar issues bouncing\naround in State and Federal courts, or is this sort of the\nonly thing they're fighting about?\nMS. McDOWELL: I wouldn't say it's the only\nthing they've been fighting about, and I'm not familiar\nwith all the cases that may have been brought, but\ncertainly these are the leading categories of cases at the\ninterpretation stage. Certainly at the initial approval\nstage there are a number of cases that have made their way\nto Federal court on a variety of issues which principally\nconcern whether the State commission has --\nQUESTION: At the approval stage, there's no\ndoubt about where those go.\nMS. McDOWELL: Right. It also should be noted\nthat most of these interconnection agreements build in\nsome form of alternative dispute resolution process that\nthere is some negotiation between the parties. Sometimes\nthere is formal arbitration to resolve these disputes, so\nit's not necessarily clear that they will all proceed\nthrough this particular process.\nQUESTION: Do you know -- do you have any sense\nof this in the hybrid -- in the hybrid system that we're\ndescribing as concerning Justice Souter, that I agree with\nyou is supposed to be the norm in respect to State\nagencies after the Chicago case. Now, one of the concerns\nin Chicago, and you may have come across this in your\nreading, or just experience, would be there would be,\nthen, a lot of cases, because it covers every State\nagency, where people would run into Federal court on a\nFederal question related to a basically State matter, and\nthey'd bring in and get review through the supplementary\njurisdiction of all kinds of State issues.\nHas that happened? I mean, is this the norm?\nDo you have any sense of what actually happens in, let's\nsay, the 40 million State proceedings that go on every\nweek?\nMS. McDOWELL: I don't think there are nearly\nthat many State proceedings. In some of these cases\ninvolving reciprocal compensation for Internet calls, yes,\nparties have asserted, as they have here, State law claims\nas well as Federal law claims, and some Federal courts, at\nleast where there's been no objection raised by the State\ncommission, relating to sovereign immunity, have exercised\nsupplemental jurisdiction over these claims.\nQUESTION: Ms. McDowell, regarding your earlier\nanswer to Justice Souter as to why Congress would have\nwanted such a crazy, hybrid system, I mean, this piece of\nlegislation was an extraordinary intrusion of the Federal\nGovernment into local utility regulation, wasn't it? I\nmean, this is an area that has traditionally been\nregulated by the States. The Government has regulated\ninterstate communications, but here they are getting into\nlocal communication regulation.\nMS. McDOWELL: But this isn't their --\nQUESTION: And was there not a feeling in\nCongress that we should take as little as possible away\nfrom the States, if they want to continue their\ntraditional regulation, and if it ended up in a hodge\npodge system, maybe many in Congress said, so be it. Is\nthat not a sufficient explanation?\nMS. McDOWELL: That might indeed be a sufficient\nexplanation. I would preface this by saying that although\nlocal competition surely has traditionally been regulated\nby the States, this act dealt with something a little\ndifferent, encouraging competition between local carriers,\nwhich was quite new at the time this 1996 act was adopted.\nQUESTION: Well, it may be a new Federal policy,\nbut to regulate concededly local telecommunications was a\nmajor step for the Federal Government, and maybe they\ndidn't want to get into the business of doing that, which\nis why they leave it optional to the States whether they\nwant to implement it or not. The Federal Government\ndidn't want to take on these things, neither at the FCC\nlevel nor, as far as we know, at the Federal district\ncourt level.\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, it certainly is clear from\nthe act that Congress hoped that State commissions would\nwant to regulate these agreements to bring their expertise\nwith local conditions and with local telecommunications to\nbear, although Congress, of course, also gave States the\noption of allowing the FCC to do that.\nQUESTION: Let me ask the question Justice\nScalia doesn't want to ask, and that is, do you have any\nlegislative history that indicates that they really did\nintend the hodge podge?\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: I mean, if they intended a hodge\npodge, I will say God bless the hodge podge, but I\ndon't -- I haven't heard anyone getting into the\nlegislative background to indicate that they didn't. Do\nyou have anything?\nMS. McDOWELL: Not really, no. The only\narguable legislative history that seems relevant is that\nthe State utility commissioners through their\norganizations came to Congress and said, we've started to\ndo this, we would like to have a role in this, and\nCongress apparently heard them in enacting --\nQUESTION: What about the provision of the\nstatute itself, that says if the States want to do it,\nthey can do it? On the other hand, if they don't do it,\nthe Federal Government -- isn't that -- don't you start\noff with a hodge podge? It's going to be State regulation\nsome places, Federal regulation other places?\nMS. McDOWELL: Yes, and that all argues all the\nmore for Federal court review under 1331 to assure some\nuniformity in the application of the Federal standards in\nthe act.\nIf I could reserve --\nQUESTION: If there's FTC participation, the\nState doesn't participate and there's an agreement, does\nthat subsequently raise some issues of State law\ninterpretation, of interpretation that can go into State\ncourt?\nMS. McDOWELL: I believe that if the FCC\nresolves these issues it may turn to State law. It hasn't\nhad the opportunity to issue a decision on this yet, but\nthose decisions would be reviewable only in the courts of\nappeals under the Hobbs act, whether they involve State\nlaw or Federal law issues.\nQUESTION: On the Eleventh Amendment point, if\nwe find that there's a waiver under 252, rather than Ex\nparte Young as a theory, would that simplify the question\nof determination of State law issues?\nMS. McDOWELL: It might or might not. One would\nthink the extent of the waiver would be governed by\nsection 252(e)(6), which refers to review to ascertain\nwhether the agreement or statement complies with sections\n251 and 252. That might be too narrow to encompass State\nlaw as well.\nIf I could reserve the remainder of my time.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. McDowell. The second\nperson doesn't reserve. You use it or lose it.\nQUESTION: She's the first.\nQUESTION: She's the first person.\nQUESTION: Oh, Mr. Evans I thought was the\nfirst.\nMs. Miller.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SUSAN S. MILLER\nON BEHALF OF THE STATE RESPONDENT\nMS. MILLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI'd like to start out with giving you a little\nfactual background of what the commission considered and\nwhat Verizon appealed. Essentially, the FCC issued an\norder saying that ISP calls to ISP's were largely\ninterstate. That order also said, for those companies\nthat had already approved agreements, the State commission\nwas to look at contract principles to see if the parties\nshould be bound by their previous agreements, and whether\ntheir previous agreements should be interpreted to include\ncalls to ISP's being local. That's what the Maryland\ncommission did in this instance.\nVerizon appealed to Federal district court\nraising two issues. The first issue was that, under\nMaryland contract law, the commission had misinterpreted\nthe contract. That's the first issue that they raised.\nThat was clear from their motion for summary judgment,\nwhich is part of the record of the case, but I don't\nbelieve it's included in any appendix to the case.\nThe second issue they raised is, after the\ncommission had interpreted the contract principles, the\ncommission determined that the FCC order required them to\ndevelop an intercarrier compensation mechanism until such\ntime as the FCC had developed its own compensation\nmechanism.\nNow, what Verizon said was that the commission\nwas wrong, that the FCC didn't require that, that they\nmade it discretionary for the commission, and those were\nthe only two issued raised by Verizon in this case.\nQUESTION: Excuse me, Verizon was objecting to a\nmisinterpretation of Maryland contract law, but up here\nthey're saying that this contract isn't governed by\nMaryland contract law, but rather by Federal contract law.\nMS. MILLER: Their --\nQUESTION: Is that a change of position?\nMS. MILLER: Their claim -- what they argued on\ntheir motion for summary judgment was that Maryland\ncontract law became Federal common law, and that thus it\nwas --\nQUESTION: Maryland contract law became Federal\ncommon law, I see.\nMS. MILLER: That was their argument.\nQUESTION: So that we have a Federal contract\nlaw that consists of Federal adoption of the common law of\neach of the 50 States that --\nMS. MILLER: Whatever their contract law is.\nQUESTION: I understand it, I guess.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. MILLER: So those were the two issues that\nwere raised by Verizon.\nQUESTION: I just want to be sure I understand\nthe thrust of your point. That's entirely consistent with\nthe argument we heard this morning, though, is it not,\nbecause they're basically saying it's all a matter of\nFederal law.\nMS. MILLER: I just want to make clear that what\nthey were raising was a contract issue. They're claiming\nthat all contract issues are also Federal law now.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMS. MILLER: I just wanted to make sure the\nCourt was clear that what -- the sole thing they were\nraising was a contract issue.\nQUESTION: But they made the same argument at\nthe district court level, if I understand you correctly.\nMS. MILLER: That --\nQUESTION: Yes --\nMS. MILLER: It had become Federal common law,\nthat's correct.\nQUESTION: And the Federal law is borrowed law\nso far as it involves the interpretation of a contract.\nMS. MILLER: That's correct.\nNow, the Fourth Circuit dismissed the 1331 claim\non the basis of three alternative grounds. The first\nground was that in relying on Jackson Transit they found\nthat Verizon's claim did not meet the arising under\nstandard contained in 1331. According to the Fourth\nCircuit, the fact that interconnection agreements are\ncreations of Federal law did not in and of itself raise a\nsubstantial Federal question.\nThe Fourth Circuit also relied on Shoshone\nMining, which said that Federal question jurisdiction\nisn't established where local rules or customs would\ngovern the result, which is what we have here, of course.\nMaryland contract law is what governed the result here,\nthat under -- specifically under 252 the negotiating\nparties had absolutely no obligation to include anything\nfrom 251 and 252 in their contract. For that reason,\nnegotiated contracts are kind of taken away from those\naspects of the Telecommunications Act.\nQUESTION: Would you think the -- would you\nassert that the result would be different and you would\ntake a different position if this were not a voluntarily\nnegotiated contract?\nMS. MILLER: We still believe it wouldn't come\nunder 1331, but for differences other than Jackson\nTransit.\nQUESTION: It would be a harder question for\nyou.\nMS. MILLER: Yes.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMS. MILLER: The petitioners really haven't\ndistinguished Jackson Transits. Both cases involve the\nprecise question of whether an action for breach of\ncontract arises under Federal law merely because the\ncontract required -- merely because Congress required the\ncontract to be formed, or required that the contract --\nQUESTION: Mr. Evans offered one distinction,\nthat there was substantial legislative history there\nsaying that Congress wanted these actions to be brought in\nState court.\nMS. MILLER: I disagree with that reading of\nJackson Transit They noted one sentence that they said\nled them to believe that Congress wouldn't have wanted\nthese. There are also several other circuit court cases,\nhowever, that have interpreted Jackson Transit to say that\nwhere State law governs the decision before the Court,\nthen there is no Federal question jurisdiction regardless\nof whether the contract terms were required to be\nincorporated or not.\nQUESTION: I saw two Federal questions, and\neither way it seems Federal. His first point, as Justice\nStevens said, was there's some words in this contract.\nThis contract is a creature of Federal law. The\ninterpretation of every one of those words is a Federal\nquestion, whatever source of law that you might come --\nturn to to figure out what Federal law is, whether it's\nMaryland, or whether it's Alaska, or whether it's some\ntotally different place.\nArgument 2, that the Federal Communications\nCommission in a series of decisions, whatever may be true\nof other words in the contract, has said that these words\nin the contract, A, B, C, D, mean, and then he gets the\nresult he wants, all right, so he's looking both to the\nF -- which obviously the FCC does have the power to do\nthat, doesn't it?\nI mean, it could say as a matter of FCC rule any\ncontract that has words A, B, and C, must be interpreted\nto mean thus and so under this statute.\nMS. MILLER: I believe it --\nQUESTION: Okay. Now, it seemed to me they're\nmaking some combination of those two arguments. Is that\nright?\nQUESTION: Excuse me, it can say that before the\nfact or after the fact? Do you think the FCC has the\npower to say that after a contract has already been\nvoluntarily negotiated?\nMS. MILLER: Well --\nQUESTION: And the FCC can say, as a matter of\nFederal law, what the parties agreed to voluntarily is\nthis, even though it plainly is not that?\nMS. MILLER: I think --\nQUESTION: Can the FCC do that?\nMS. MILLER: I don't believe they can, and I\nthink that was what was the problem with --\nQUESTION: If I got us into this, I'd modify the\nquestion.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: It's simply a matter of, wouldn't\nthat state a Federal question? I don't know what the\nanswer is, but somebody who says just what I said has\nraised a Federal question, haven't they, just as somebody\nwho says this contract is a creature of Federal law, the\nword interpretation is Federal, has raised a Federal\nquestion, and you would reply, you're wrong about what the\nanswer to the question is, but that's different from\nsaying you haven't raised a Federal question.\nMS. MILLER: I think under Jackson Transit what\nthey've said is that you haven't raised a Federal\nquestion. That's what Jackson Transit said. If you take\na contract, and your only basis of the contract was that\nit was required by Federal law, then that doesn't even\nraise a Federal question.\nQUESTION: They're not saying it was required by\nFederal law. They're saying that the words of the\ncontract, what they mean is Federal law.\nMS. MILLER: That would be a closer question as\nto whether that actually raises a substantial Federal\nquestion regarding whether -- because it would obviously\nlimit a State commission's interpretation. The State\ncommission could not interpret the word in a different\nway.\nThe second basis for the Fourth Circuit's\ndismissal of the 1331 claim was essentially based on this\nCourt's Merrell Dow decision. In Merrell Dow, the court\nfound that where a Federal statute includes a limited\ngrant of jurisdiction, that any other broader grant of\njurisdiction would flout the intent of Congress. Based on\nthat, the Fourth Circuit found that 252(e)(6) was a\nlimited grant of jurisdiction and that therefore it should\nnot allow suit to be brought under 1331.\nThe respon -- the petitioners have argued that\nthe rule is otherwise that essentially the courts have\nthis broad grant authority unless there is some\nlimitation, but all the cases cited by the respondents\ninvolve Federal agencies, and there's a distinction here,\nbecause what the Federal agencies were arguing was\nessentially that there was absolutely no review of what\nwas at issue, that you couldn't bring it under 1331, there\nwas no other statute, essentially it was a discretionary\nact of the agency, and you couldn't bring it, and in that\nsense the Court --\nQUESTION: Oh, now --\nQUESTION: Your position is that there's no\njurisdiction under 252, and there's also no jurisdiction\nunder 1331. Is that right?\nMS. MILLER: That's correct.\nQUESTION: And is it because 252 by implication\nprohibits 1331 jurisdiction, or just that 1331 isn't broad\nenough to cover this?\nMS. MILLER: It's that 252 represents a limited\ngrant of jurisdiction on behalf of Congress, and that\nCongress only intended such a limited grant of\njurisdiction, and that therefore to use a broader grant of\njurisdiction such as 1331 would defy congressional intent.\nQUESTION: In other words, Congress intended\nFederal jurisdiction over review of approval agreements,\nbut didn't intend Federal jurisdiction over anything else?\nMS. MILLER: That's correct.\nQUESTION: What do you say to the provision that\nyour brother quoted to the effect that there will be no\nmodification of Federal statutory law unless it's express\nmodification, which would preserve the full extent of\n1331, I suppose?\nMS. MILLER: It -- but it also preserves the --\nhow 1331 has been analyzed in the past, and how 1331 has\nbeen analyzed under Merrell Dow is that you look at the\nstatute, and if the statute has a limited grant of\nauthority, then that's congressional intent that that be\nthe only authority, so 601 didn't change the analysis, it\njust says you use the same analysis, and in this case the\nanalysis is, under Merrell Dow, there is a jurisdictional\nstatute in the statute at issue, so no other statutes --\nso 1331, which is a broader grant of jurisdiction, should\nnot be used.\nQUESTION: What about section 251 of the\nTelecommunications Act, which does seem to have a lot of\nstandards for these agreements. Wouldn't that make it a\nFederal question?\nMS. MILLER: Well, but they're -- for negotiated\nagreements they're not required to incorporate anything\ninvolving 251 and 252, so they've made the choice to not\ninclude those Federal standards by negotiating an\nagreement rather than having it arbitrated, so in that\nsense, no, it would not raise a Federal question.\nQUESTION: We're told that the agreements that\nare negotiated are not very far distant from what the\nstandards are under the -- of the statute. The thing is\nso set up that the parties will come down to pretty much\nwhat's in the statute. Is that not so?\nMS. MILLER: I don't know that it's so in any --\nin every instance. In this instance, for a matter of\nfact, the initial contract at issue with MFS and Telenet,\nVerizon actually agreed to a reciprocal compensation rate\nthat was higher than the commission's arbitrated rate.\nNow, for what reason, I don't know. Presumably they\ntraded something else for that.\nSo it's not necessarily so that whatever's in\nthe statute the parties agree to, and if the parties agree\nto that, then they've chosen to agree to that rather than\ngo to the State commission and say, Federal law requires\nthis, we don't want to agree to it, but we recognize that\nyou have the authority to order us to do it.\nQUESTION: So you say that what has been created\nis this weird system in which challenges to the\ninterpretation or validity of negotiated agreements can't\ngo to Federal court, but if it's a challenge to an\narbitrated agreement, it does go to Federal court?\nMS. MILLER: Well, we think it would not end up\nin Federal court for other reasons, but we -- but --\nQUESTION: What are the other reasons, because\nit makes some difference to me whether there's going to be\nthis strange line between negotiated and --\nMS. MILLER: Well, if you're talking about 13 --\ngoing into Federal court under 1331 --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. MILLER: -- our argument would be the\nprivate right of action argument, that 1331, you have to\nlook at the four court factors and things like that, and\nthat therefore those wouldn't end up under 1331 either,\nand also the same argument --\nQUESTION: But then you're blending together two\nthings --\nQUESTION: Right.\nQUESTION: -- that I think this Court's\ndecisions keep separate. One is 1331, general Federal\nquestion jurisdiction.\nQUESTION: Right.\nQUESTION: That you have to have first, and then\ndo you have, would you survive a 12(b)(6) motion, do you\nhave a claim for relief, and you treated that in your\nbrief, and now again, as though they're the same question,\nand they're not.\nMS. MILLER: I don't believe, in answer to\nJustice Scalia's question, I was treating them the same.\nHe asked me what other issues would we raise to say that\nthis arbitration case shouldn't be in this Court, and that\nwas one of the issues we raised.\nI believe that there are cases that essentially\nsay that a cause of action is a matter, a matter of\nsubject matter jurisdiction. There are several circuit\ncourts that have interpreted this Court's Merrell Dow case\nin that manner, but I don't think it's necessary for the\nCourt to even reach this, because I think the cases can be\nupheld based on the Fourth Circuit analysis, and any one\nof the three alternatives raised.\nQUESTION: I thought we wrestled with that issue\nin Steel Co.,\nMS. MILLER: And --\nQUESTION: You're not going to drag us back into\nthat again, are you?\nMS. MILLER: Do you want to know what the Fourth\nCircuit -- how the Fourth Circuit distinguished your Steel\nCo. case?\nQUESTION: Yes. I defended in Steel Co., so I'd\nlike to know that.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. MILLER: What the Fourth Circuit claimed you\nwere doing in Steel Co. is that you were distinguishing\nbetween Article III subject matter jurisdiction, which had\nto be decided before you reached the merits, and statutory\nsubject matter jurisdiction, which you didn't have to\ndecide before you reached the merits under that\nhypothetical jurisdiction issue. That's how the Fourth\nCircuit has interpreted Steel Co.\nSo in this instance I believe the petitioners\nare wrong in their analysis that you have 1331\njurisdiction unless Congress specifically precludes 1331\njurisdiction. The only cases that has occurred has been\nwith regard to Federal agencies, as I mentioned earlier,\nand that was because to find that 1331 wasn't broad enough\nto encompass a Federal agency would mean that there would\nbe absolutely no review, so I think that there is a\ndistinction that is important between the two cases.\nThe final reason the Fourth Circuit found that\nthe 1331 claim should be dismissed was the Rooker-Feldman\ndoctrine. Under that doctrine, it involves essentially a\nstatutory interpretation element and a federalism element.\nThe statutory interpretation element is that 1257 grants\noriginal jurisdiction to this Court and this Court alone\nover State -- I'm sorry. 1257 alone grants this Court\nappellate review of State court decisions, and that the\nFederal district courts only have review over original\nactions, original civil actions, and that by implication,\ntherefore, Federal district courts have no review over\nState court actions.\nQUESTION: Well, how does that fit in with City\nof Chicago, where a Federal district court did sit on\nthose supplemental jurisdiction claims as a reviewer of a\nState administrative agency?\nMS. MILLER: I think that's distinguishable\nbecause in the case you referred to the district court\nalready had jurisdiction over Federal claims that were\ntotally separate and apart from the on-record\nadministrative review. Essentially, the Federal claims\ncould have been brought without actually reviewing the\nrecord and the order in the case. It was because the\nFederal district court already had that jurisdiction over\nthose claims that this Court found it could exercise its\nsupplemental jurisdiction and also hear those claims that\ninvolved the on-the-record State court -- actually, I\nthink it was actually a local administrative agency in\nthat case, but the on-the-record review.\nSo I think this is different in that Verizon\nraises no claims that are separate and apart from the on-\nthe-record review and decisions of the Maryland Public\nService Commission, so in this instance the Federal\ndistrict court will be acting as an appellate court,\nparticularly since I believe virtually every Federal\ndistrict court that has considered the issue has said in\ntelecommunications cases it's not a de novo review, it is\nan on-the-record review, so in this instance they will be\nperforming an appellate action rather than an original\ncivil action.\nQUESTION: Could you -- in your opinion, if\nthere is -- suppose it isn't a communications case, it's\ncommon, isn't it, if, say the California State Coastal\nAuthority, a State agency, orders someone to do thus-and-\nso, they could say in Federal court, that order violates a\nFederal statute, all right.\nNow, in your case, if there were plaintiff just\nlike this one, and he went into a Federal court and said,\nyour State court order violates a Federal statute -- so in\nother words, suppose it were much more clear, are you\nsaying there, there's no jurisdiction?\nMS. MILLER: There, there would be Federal\njurisdiction if the basis of that claim didn't require the\nappellate -- the Federal district court, excuse me, to\nactually -- to review the determinations of the Maryland\nPublic Service Commission to reach the conclusion that\ntheir order violated a Federal law, essentially --\nQUESTION: Well, there may often be, with the\nCalifornia State Coastal Commission somebody says, this is\na taking of my property, or something simpler. Now, it\ncould be that you have to look at the underlying State\norder in order to deal with the Federal question.\nMS. MILLER: To a certain extent you would be\nlooking at the Federal -- the State order, but you would\nnot be overturning the State order on the basis that the\nState commission found. You would be saying, yes, you\nfound this, but the problem is, what you found now\nimplicates this, so --\nQUESTION: Well, but what if the Federal\nobjection was raised at the administrative level, so that\nthe administrator, the administrative body had said, no\nFederal problem. In that case, I take it, your answer\nwould be no, they can't go into Federal court.\nMS. MILLER: That would be correct. They would\nhave to go through the State court proceedings in that,\nand have it resolved in that manner.\nQUESTION: May I ask you a procedural question?\nI hate to do this, but it seemed to be in the case. Your\nclient's the commission.\nMS. MILLER: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Now, it's my understanding that the\ncommission first raised an Eleventh Amendment problem.\nMS. MILLER: That's correct.\nQUESTION: And then it was dismissed from the\ncase.\nMS. MILLER: We were not dismissed from the case\nThe whole case was dismissed.\nQUESTION: The whole case -- how did the 1331\ncome up, then?\nMS. MILLER: Well --\nQUESTION: It decided as to your client, you're\nout of it because of Eleventh Amendment. As to the rest\nof them they were out of it because of 1331, or --\nMS. MILLER: No, Your Honor. At the Federal\ndistrict court level, essentially the court decided that\nwe had Eleventh Amendment immunity and that we were\nindispensable parties and, as such, the entire case had to\nbe dismissed.\nThe Federal district court also addressed the\n1331 issue and found that it would not imply a private\nright of action, and that the -- and that his Eleventh\nAmendment analysis probably would pertain to the 1331\nclaim as well.\nThat's all I have, unless there are any other\nquestions.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Miller.\nMr. Evans, you have 1 minute remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK L. EVANS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN NO. 00-1531\nMR. EVANS: I would just like to read two\nprovisions, very short provisions from the contract that's\nbeing interpreted here. The first says, reciprocal\ncompensation is as described in the act. The second says,\nas described in the act means, as described in or required\nby the act, meaning the '96 telecom act, and as from time\nto time interpreted in the duly authorized rules and\nregulations of the FCC or the State commission.\nNow, if you look at the decision of the agency\nhere, the State agency here, it is full of a discussion of\nwhat it means, what reciprocal compensation is required\nunder the act. That was the basis for the interpretation.\nThe effect of the interpretation was to say,\neven though the act doesn't require it, you have to\nprovide it, because your agreement says you're going to\nprovide it, and we -- this statement says just the\nopposite.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Evans.\n"
