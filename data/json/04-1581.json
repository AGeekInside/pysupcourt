        "content": "(10:13 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst today in No. 04-1581, Wisconsin Right to Life,\nIncorporated v. Federal Election Commission.\nMr. Bopp.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES BOPP, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BOPP: Thank you, and Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThis case involves the fundamental First\nAmendment question of whether the Government can shield\nlawmakers from grassroots lobbying about upcoming votes\nin Congress through campaign finance laws.\nThis Court has distinguished the regulation\nof corporate electioneering from efforts to influence\nlawmaking, finding sufficiently compelling\ngovernmental interests in regulating electioneering,\nbut not grassroots lobbying.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Bopp, right -- right\nthere I guess I -- I have a problem with -- with your\nargument, and I just want to get it out. I went back\nand looked at some of the examples that were given at\n-- in -- in the McConnell case for parallels between\nwhat we -- what we thought was covered in those cases\nand -- and yours -- your case. And the -- the one\nwhich I -- I guessed was probably the closest was the --\nwas the advertisements there in -- in the McConnell\ncase on the -- the lobbying on the Chinese trade\nrelations. The basic message in -- in that case was\nChina uses forced labor. The Congress of the United\nStates is about to make it easier for -- for Chinese\ngoods to get in here and for China to have a\nrespectable trade status. And -- and it said, call\nCongressman Myrick, I think it was, in any case, a\nMember of Congress, and -- and say what you think.\nIn this case, you're -- you're talking about\na -- a filibuster, and you say, you know, they're\nfilibustering nominees and they're not coming up to --\nto a vote. Tell the two Senators in this State, Kohl\nand Feingold, that -- that you don't like this.\nThe only difference that I could see\nbasically between the two kinds of ads was that in the\nfirst one -- in -- in the Myrick ad, they actually gave\nthe number of the -- of the congressional office to\ncall and say, hey, don't do this.\nIn this case, your clients did not give a --\na number. They gave a Web site to an organization.\nInsofar as I know, it doesn't have a number.\nWhich gets me to the question. If the -- the\nChinese trade relations ad was presumably validly\nsubject to the act, I don't see why your client's ad is\nnot, for the same reason, subject to the act and for\nthe further reason that it doesn't even give a phone\nnumber to call -- to -- to lobby the people. So it seems\nto me that on stare decisis grounds, unless we're going\nto go back and simply reexamine McConnell to -- to --\nfrom -- from scratch, that your clients fall within the\ngeneral rule as -- as we held it in McConnell. So why\ndoesn't precedent foreclose this?\nMR. BOPP: Well, there -- there is a few\nspecifics about the -- about our ad that -- that I\nwould like to remind the Court of.\nFirst, it was not -- the call to action at\nthe end of the ad was not just call them up and tell\nthem what you think. The call to action was to call\nthe Senators and ask them to oppose the filibuster. So\nit was specific.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but you didn't even\ngive their phone numbers.\nMR. BOPP: Well, and then it refers to a Web\nsite, befair.org, which contained prominently on the\nfirst page the phone numbers and addresses and all\ncontact information for these two Senators. The\ndecision was made by the speaker here that it would be\nmore likely that the recipient of the ad would remember\nthe phrase, befair.org, and seek the information on\nthat Web site than to have a -- you know, a -- a phone\nnumber that is just simply more difficult to -- to\nremember.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. So if we accept that\nextra step, that's -- that gets you -- if -- if we\naccept the extra step that gets you parallel to the --\nto the ad that we considered in McConnell.\nMR. BOPP: Well, it -- it doesn't, the one\nthat you mentioned, because it was just call them up\nand --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If -- if it's the fact that\nyou go to the Web site and that's what's supposed to\nmake this what it was in McConnell which, by the way,\nwe said was illegal, what they -- the first thing\nthey're going to see when they get to the Web site,\nwhich I agree with you -- four times in 3 of the 12\nsentences of this ad -- in 3 of the 12 -- it says,\nbefair.org, visit befair.org, go to befair.org. And\nthe first thing that they're going to see when they get\nto befair.org is a big headline in bold -- gold -- bold\nletters which says, Feingold and Kohl continue to\nsupport unprecedented filibusters of judicial nominees.\nSo, in fact, if befair.org is brought into the\npicture, that makes this ad look much more like an\neffort to -- to defeat Senator Feingold than the ad\nthat we considered in our previous case.\nMR. BOPP: Well, it --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Doesn't it?\nMR. BOPP: No. In your previous case, there\nwere certainly genuine issue ads. This Court\nrecognized that it -- that there were genuine issue ads\nthat were not for the purpose of influencing an\nelection. I believe that these ads are at the very\ncore of what a genuine issue ad is. It involves a -- a\npending legislative issue, and the only reference to\nthe Senator -- and it was both Senators, not just the\none up for election -- was to contact them about --\nabout how -- whether to support or oppose that specific\ninitiative.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, but in McConnell --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if you are right --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- in McConnell, the Court\nsaid corporations and unions may finance genuine issue\nads during election blackout periods by simply avoiding\nany specific reference to Federal candidates or, in\ndoubtful cases, by paying for the ad from a segregated\nfund. Now, that language indicates, to me at least,\nthat the Court was saying there are no genuine issue\nads meeting the definition as you would have us apply\nit here.\nMR. BOPP: Well, that -- that part of the\nopinion needs to be read in light of the footnote,\nwhich is attached to those very words, which said in\nfootnote 88 that the interests that support regulation\nof electioneering may not apply to genuine grassroots\nlobbying and distinguished the McConnell case from\nBellotti and McIntyre.\nSo we do have to recognize that there's two\nthings going on here. There -- there is an election,\nbut also Congress is in session. The Government is\nengaging in its lawmaking function.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Bopp, to what extent\ncan we take into account the surrounding circumstances?\nOne thing that you advocate is to look at this ad in\nisolation. But if you add to it that your organization\nmade it clear that it opposed the candidacy of Senator\nFeingold and that it supported his opponents, that your\norganization also connected, as Justice Breyer just\nbrought out, Senator Feingold with this filibuster, and\nthen if the filibuster was such an important thing for\ngrassroots lobbying, why was it that when the election\nwas over, this ad was not repeated?\nMR. BOPP: Well, of course, the final point\nis -- is in the record, that -- that is, it was -- the\n-- it was supposed to come to a head in November and\nthen it did not. It was abandoned.\nBut the -- but the point is you cannot -- I\ndon't think that the Government can condition --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I don't -- I don't\nunderstand what you just said.\nMR. BOPP: Well -- well, the -- the\nfilibuster issue, as it related to that session of\nCongress, it was thought that it was going to come to a\nhead in -- in October -- excuse me -- but it -- but as\na -- but it did not. So that is the reason why it was\n-- it would not have been run after November.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, but I mean, once it didn't\ncome to a head in November and it was still an issue, why\ndidn't you continue to run it?\nMR. BOPP: Well, each organization has to\nmake an assessment with respect to the different issues\nthat they want to be lobbying on and the -- their\npressing nature. And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your point\nwas that it was not an issue after the election.\nMR. BOPP: Well -- well, it was in the -- in\nthe next session of Congress and has been an -- an\nissue. But each -- a lobby organization makes a\ndecision about the priorities that they have and\nwhether or not their lobbying efforts will most likely\naffect legislative action. So --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Were you taking a\nposition on this issue prior to the election time\nframe?\nMR. BOPP: Yes. The --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Had you taken out\nadvertisements prior to that time frame?\nMR. BOPP: Yes. Yes, and in fact these radio\nand television ads were continuing up until the\nblackout period and it was the blackout period that\ntriggered the case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But the basic question I\nthink is this. All of us -- or almost all of us who\nare here -- spent an entire summer reading through one\nof the longest set of opinions I've ever seen from the\nlower courts and going through a record that they had\ncompiled over months reflecting 6 years of\ncongressional effort. And what that record showed with\ndozens, hundreds I think, of examples was the basis for\nCongress' conclusion that there's simply no way to know\nwhether an ad like yours is a genuine issue ad or\nisn't. And the only way that we have a hope of\nstopping rich people or corporations or labor unions\nfrom simply trying to defeat candidates by writing sham\nads is to have the rule that we had.\nNow, you have a very good argument, but it's\nan argument that I heard right in that case. And we\nconsidered right in that case issues like yours, just\nads like yours, ads that were even less sham-like than\nyours, if you want to call yours a sham -- I don't mean\nto be pejorative. But we considered all that, and then\nwe used them as an example. And of course, it was\nclose. 5 to 4 this Court said ads that are even more\napparently neutral on their face than yours, Congress\ncan impose this requirement.\nNow, what's different about your ad than the\nads we put right in that opinion as examples of what\nwe'd allow Congress to control? What's different now\nor are you asking us to go back only a year later and\nundo what we did?\nMR. BOPP: No. I'm asking you to give\nmeaning to the holding of this Court that there were\ngenuine issue ads that were broadcast during that\nperiod of time. The Government conceded 7 percent,\nasked you to do a Broadrick analysis upholding the\nstatute on its face, reserving as-applied challenges to\ngenuine issue ads in subsequent cases. That is what\nthis case is about.\nAnd the difference here is that as Judge Leon\n-- the record of the case -- in Judge Leon's opinion,\nhe went for a number of pages explaining what genuine\nissue ads in his view were, and what -- and he said\nthat if the ad discusses a current legislative issue\nand refers to the Member of Congress in calling on him\nor her to take a particular action on that issue, that\nconstitutes a genuine issue ad.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we return to --\nMR. BOPP: These people are lawmaking.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Bopp, then can we\nreturn to my question? Do we view the ad in isolation,\nand do we discount the connection by your organization\nof this Senator with the filibuster that you said was\na very bad thing?\nMR. BOPP: And I'm sorry. I was interrupted.\nI wasn't able to get to that question.\nAnd the -- the Government cannot condition\nthe exercise of one right on exercising another.\nThere's a First Amendment right for the PAC of\nWisconsin Right to Life to support or oppose\ncandidates. That's different than what its lobby group\ndoes. Its lobby group is primarily involved in\ninfluencing current lawmaking. And so that is why, in\nthe First Amendment, petition is separately listed.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the electorate will\nknow that this issue is presented to them in connection\nwith this Senator and that your organization has linked\nthe two very clearly.\nMR. BOPP: But, you know, the -- the effect\non an election is remote and speculative and not proven\nby -- in terms of genuine issue ads in this record.\nBut these people are lawmaking now. So there's a\npressing need and, indeed, right for people today to\ninfluence the Government's lawmaking regardless of the\nincidental, remote, speculative, and unproven effect\nthat that genuine issue ad may have on an election.\nThere -- there is simply -- we just cannot\nget away from the fact that the most important thing\nthat Government does is lawmaking, and because they've\nscheduled an election should not immunize the\nincumbents from being lobbied about that very law-\nmaking function that they're engaged in today.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then why didn't we have to\ngo the other way in the Chinese trade relation example?\nI mean, everything --\nMR. BOPP: Well, I don't think you --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- unless I'm missing\nsomething in your argument, everything you are saying\nin this argument could have been said with respect to\nthat ad and, as Justice Breyer said, to a couple of\nothers.\nMR. BOPP: Well that may very well have been\na genuine issue ad in the mind of this Court. You only\ncited one ad, which was on page 193, which was the\nYellowtail ad, as an example of sham issue advertising.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. BOPP: And there, you know --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and we -- we cited\nsome other examples as -- as examples that, on the face\nof it and on the face of the record, would -- would\nlawfully fall within the -- the general rule that we\nsaid Congress could prescribe.\nMR. BOPP: Well -- well, the Yellowtail ad,\nwhich you cited and quoted as a example of sham issue\nad, said that the -- Mr. Yellowtail had taken a swing\nat his wife and he justified that because he said he\ndidn't hit her.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the point --\nMR. BOPP: And then it said basically call\nhim up and yell at him.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But I -- I don't want to cut\nyou off from your Yellowtail argument, if -- if you\nwant to make it, but it seems to me that the problem in\nthis case is that your ad is very much like a non-\nYellowtail ad. And the problem that we would have in\naccepting your argument is, number one, a problem of\nprecedent and, number two, the problem that Justice\nBreyer raised that, again, we had dealt with in the\nprior case.\nMR. BOPP: How could it be --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, no. Let me just finish\nmy question.\nMR. BOPP: Sorry.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Once you get out of the\nsphere of -- of kind of sham ads that just hit you in\nyour face, there isn't a practical way to tell the\ndifference. There isn't a kind of magic formula. We\nrejected the magic word, or Congress rejected the magic\nword's approach. And therefore, Congress came up with\na rule that it did within certain time limits,\nidentified candidates, identified audiences. You can't\ndo it within this period of time unless you do it\nthrough a PAC.\nWhat is different in your case from those\nparadigm examples in -- in McConnell?\nMR. BOPP: Well, as I was describing, the\nYellowtail ad was --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But Yellowtail --\nMR. BOPP: -- which involves very --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- is -- is an ad of -- an\nobviously sham ad. The problem that we're dealing with\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Bopp, did -- did the\nopinion refer to --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May -- may I finish?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- sham ads?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Excuse me. May I -- may I\nfinish my question?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did the opinion refer to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Souter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I finish my question?\nThe -- the -- no one is saying that your ad\nin this case is an obviously sham ad like Yellowtail.\nYour ad in this case is one of those ads that it's\ndifficult to deal with fairly. You can say, well, you\nknow, it's an electioneering ad and you can say it's --\nit's a lobbying ad. And -- and Congress decided how to\ndeal with them. We said that's okay. Why doesn't --\nMR. BOPP: Only on a facial challenge.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but why doesn't your ad\nfall within the reasoning that we used in approving --\non the facial challenge, in approving the statute?\nMR. BOPP: Because the Broadrick facial\nchallenge analysis that you engaged in in McConnell is\nnot completed because that includes future as-applied\nchallenges. The Government argues that there were --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No -- no question about it.\nMR. BOPP: -- 7 percent --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But your -- your as-applied\n--\nMR. BOPP: -- genuine issue ads --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- challenge has got to have\nsomething different about it, something unusual that\nsays this is why my ad does not fall within the general\nrule. And that's what I'm trying to get at.\nMR. BOPP: Well, I -- I will repeat. The --\nit involves a currently pending legislative issue. It\ndoes not talk --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Wasn't the Chinese trade\nissue currently pending?\nMR. BOPP: Yes, it was, and you know, the\nChinese --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So that's no difference.\nMR. BOPP: But -- but, Your Honor, the\nChinese example was not cited by this Court. It was in\nthe record. And it may be a -- a genuine issue ad.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Sure.\nMR. BOPP: Okay? And -- and the Government\nargued there were 7 percent genuine issue ads really\ntrying to exercise the constitutional right to petition\nGovernment, because Government is regulating us right\nnow in terms of their votes and their actions. And, of\ncourse, that's why in the First Amendment, it doesn't\njust say speech and -- and association and press. It\n-- it says --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I --\nMR. BOPP: -- petition the Government.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- may I ask one question\njust to find out? Are you contending that there is a\nsharp distinction? There's a category of issue ads and\na category of election ads that are mutually exclusive?\nMR. BOPP: I think you can create objective\ncriteria, just like this Court has --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No. If you can answer my\nquestion yes or no. Are -- are you arguing there are\ntwo mutually exclusive categories, or are there ads\nthat fit somewhat in both?\nMR. BOPP: Well, I -- I think that you can\nadopt objective criteria as you have in the Noerr v.\nPennington doctrine to separate the two.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Are you able to answer my\nquestion yes or no?\nMR. BOPP: I -- I would say no.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You're not claiming there\nare separate categories.\nMR. BOPP: Then I misunderstood your\nquestion, Your Honor. I am saying that they are\nseparate categories. This Court --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So it's either -- it's\neither an issue ad or it's a candidate ad.\nMR. BOPP: Yes. And I'm not saying at the --\nat the margins there -- there may not be doubtful\ncases, but what I'm saying is that this Court in Noerr\nv. Pennington doctrine has recognized and adopted\nobjective criteria to distinguish between genuine\nefforts to influence the Government, which is not\nsubject to the Sherman Act, and sham issues -- efforts\nto regulate --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does the -- does the\nFEC draw -- distinguish between sham ads and genuine\nissue ads?\nMR. BOPP: No, the -- no, they haven't. But\nright before the 2004 election -- excuse me -- they\ngave an exception to an auto dealership that wanted to\ncontinue to run the name of the owner of the\ndealership, despite the fact that he was a Senator -- a\ncandidate for United States Senate, during the blackout\nperiod. And the commercial interests at stake there\nwere sufficient for the FEC to grant an as-applied\nexception even though there may have been some\nincidental effect on the election. So the FEC has\nrecognized that there is interests which are sufficient\nand -- and also that the -- the possible impact on an\nelection is so remote that -- that the interests are --\nare sufficient.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So what is the\ntest? Because I -- my vague recollection from a year\nand a half ago is that there was in that testimony\npolitical consultants who said if you really want to\ndefeat a Senator, here's how you do it.\nMR. BOPP: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Run an ad that just speaks\nabout a group of Senators. It's plain that they're\nbad, and then put in some words that mention his name\nand everybody will get the point. They said that's\neven better than saying, vote against.\nAnd then our opinion said there is little\ndifference between an ad that urges voters to vote\nagainst Jane Doe and one that condemns Jane Doe's\nrecord on a particular issue while exhorting viewers to\ncall Jane Doe and tell her what you think. That was\nthe opinion.\nSo, now, what's your test to decide whether\nthat's what's going on or whether this is a genuine\nissue ad?\nMR. BOPP: I think that you would look at,\none, whether the -- the ad discusses a current\nlegislative issue; two, whether or not it made any\nreference to the legislator beyond lobbying him or her\nabout that specific issue. So there should not be any\nreferences to the election or the candidacy of the\nincumbent or any of those type references. And if you\nhad that, you would have a bona fide, genuine effort to\nlobby.\nThey are voting. They're taxing us. They're\nregulating us. And as we know, the record reflects\nthat usually most of the -- of these issues are decided\nin the context of this blackout period at the end of --\nend of Congress.\nSo I know it is difficult to balance these\ninterests, but there is more interest among the people\nthan simply the remote and speculative effort to\ninfluence an election. There is an immediate need to\ninfluence how Government is regulating and taxing us.\nSo that is the interest that is presented here. That\nis the interest that the Court in McConnell recognized\nwhen the Court said there are genuine issue ads and --\nand only engage in what the Government urged was a\nBroadrick facial challenge analysis.\nThe Government said in McConnell, well, any\nof these genuine issue ads can be dealt with in an as-\napplied challenge. Now, they have switched sides here,\nhaving asked the Court and the Court engaging in a\nBroadrick facial challenge analysis -- are now saying\nthat even though Broadrick would allow as-applied, that\nyou are not to entertain any as-applied. I just don't\nsee --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, this ad could have\nbeen run by your clients by a segregated fund.\nMR. BOPP: Yes. Yes, that is true. And --\nand, of course, as -- as this Court has recognized --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: It just ran out of money.\nIs that the deal?\nMR. BOPP: Well, that was only part of it.\nThey -- they didn't raise money with the anticipation\nof doing their lobbying with it. In other words, they\nraised all their lobbying money in their -- in their\ngeneral treasury. The -- the only funds they raised in\ntheir PAC is to advocate the election or defeat of\ncandidates or give money to candidates, which -- which\nthis Court has recognized is a proper way of directly\naffecting an elections.\nBut making lobbying into a PAC means that,\nnumber one, you're going to have to identify that\neffort to influence a vote -- about an upcoming vote in\nCongress, you're going to have to identify that as a\npolitical activity.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. If you can do\nthis, can a labor union do it?\nMR. BOPP: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And a corporation?\nMR. BOPP: Yes. Of course, the prohibition\nwe're attacking is against corporations --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Well, then --\nthen we're back to -- I mean, I've heard this. This is\nvery familiar music to me and I think you raise a tough\nissue. I just thought we perhaps had decided it.\nBut the -- the reason that this was so tough\nwas then these very, very wealthy individuals -- and\nsince I once read through the list, I know who they\nare. And they -- they say, I'm going to give $15\nmillion. You know, I'm going to give $15 million. So\nthey hire this genius political consultant that's there\nin the record. And what happens is ads that look an\nawful like this, and this consultant says, hey, we have\n$15 million to pay for it from this one person. And\nthey run them all over the country. And Senator after\nSenator is boom, boom, boom, boom.\nMR. BOPP: Yes, but --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It becomes a question of\nmotive and how do we know what the motive is?\nMR. BOPP: That's not what advocacy groups\nare doing. You know, people who want -- the wealthy\npeople you're talking about have gone into giving money\nto 527 unincorporated groups that -- that are using\nissue ads lawfully through that vehicle.\nBut, you know, before this all happened, the\n1996 and the record of McConnell where, all of a\nsudden, there were more of these issue ads, the record\nalso reflects that there had been issue ads, you know,\nthroughout history. And -- and, of course, those were\nall these efforts to influence the upcoming votes in\nCongress. So that occurred before this effort with\nsham issue ads. It -- it would occur now except that\ngenuine issue advocacy through grassroots lobbying is\nnow swept in under the reason that it might have an\nincidental effect on elections.\nThis Court just simply needs to recognize\nthat there's more to Government than elections, and\neven more importantly than elections is the lawmaking\nfunction and that -- that people should not be disabled\nfrom using most effective means to influence that law-\nmaking with -- on the basis that simply there's an\nelection coming up.\nI'd like to reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Bopp.\nGeneral Clement, we'll hear now from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn McConnell against FEC, this Court upheld\ntitle II's definition and regulation of electioneering\ncommunications by corporations and unions as defined in\nthe act.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In McConnell against\nFEC, you stood there and told us that this was a facial\nchallenge and that as-applied challenges could be\nbrought in the future. This is an as-applied challenge\nand now you're telling us that it's already been\ndecided. It's a classic bait and switch.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No. In -- in fairness, Mr.\nChief Justice, in the McConnell case at pages 105 and\n106 of our brief, we said that as-applied challenges\nwould arguably be available. But the principal\nargument we stressed in the brief and in oral argument\nwas that, in a sense, overbreadth analysis here and\neven as-applied challenges, though we didn't put it in\nthose terms, are a little bit beside the point because\nof the nature of the regulatory structure here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there any other\ncase that you can cite where we've upheld a facial\nchallenge and then later said that an as-applied\nchallenge was barred by our ruling on the facial\nchallenge?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I\nwill answer it, and I -- and I think actually --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Like Justice Stevens,\nI think that's a yes or no.\n(Laughter.)\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Okay. Yes. Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Lane and Hibbs. I can't\nimagine after those two decisions which upheld in\nfacial challenges the statutes at issue there and said\nthat there was not too much prophylaxis for purposes of\nsection 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I beg your pardon. I\ndidn't hear the names of the cases.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Lane and Hibbs. Tennessee\nagainst Lane and Nevada against Hibbs. I can't imagine\nafter those decisions that somebody --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's a very\ndifferent question. That's interpreting the scope of\nCongress's power under section 5 of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. The issue is whether it's limited to the\nconstitutional violations or sweeps more broadly. If\nyou conclude that it sweeps more broadly, it's not\nsuggesting that an as-applied challenge can be brought\nby someone who's covered by the broader sweep. That's\na very different question.\nIs there any First Amendment case where we've\nsaid this is facially valid and then said as-applied\nchallenges can't be brought?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think this Court has --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it would be\nlike in any of those cases where you have a -- a broad\nprohibition and you say, yes, there may be situations\nwhere it's unconstitutional, but the statute is valid\non its face. And then someone comes in and says, well,\nmy situation is one where it's unconstitutional. We've\nnever said, well, it's too bad because it's valid on\nits face, have we?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think the case really\nhasn't arisen because generally when this Court clearly\nidentifies an area where Congress can regulate in\nprophylactic terms, somebody doesn't come back in and\ntry to bring the exact same challenge. And if I could\ngive you two examples.\nIf somebody after Burson against Freeman,\nwhich you may remember is the case where this Court\nupheld a 100-foot buffer zone around a polling place --\nif somebody came in after that decision and said, well,\nthat can't apply to me in an as-applied challenge\nbecause I only want to stand 90 feet away, I think they\nwould have gotten laughed out of Court because this\nCourt already said that a 100-foot buffer zone was\nsufficient.\nI think in a similar way --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it might have been\nthat 90 feet included a public street and you couldn't\ngo down a public street without -- so -- and so --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Kennedy --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It -- it does seems strange\nto me in a speech case to say we're foreclosing as-\napplied challenges.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: And -- and, Justice Kennedy,\nplease understand me. I don't mean to suggest that\nMcConnell somehow magically jurisdictionally foreclosed\nas-applied challenges. And I suppose if somebody could\ncome in after Burson and give a good reason why their\nsituation is very different, that there's a super\nhighway 90 feet away or that all they were talking\nabout is a bumper sticker on a car, well, then maybe\nthat --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, I suppose you can\nsay, yes, you can have an as-applied challenge, but\nthis one doesn't meet the test.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Exactly, Justice O'Connor.\nAnd again, it's not because it's foreclosed. It's\nbecause the reasoning of this Court in McConnell\nforecloses the decision.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So let's say you had\nan organization that every month of every year it took\nout an ad the first week of every month, and it said\nthe same thing and it said, contact your Senators.\nThis issue is important to us. And they do that every\nmonth. All of a sudden, their ad's nature changes\nbecause an election is -- happens to be coming up and\nit's illegal the month before the election, even though\nit was clearly something that they did without regard\nto the election.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, that\nwould be a better as-applied challenge. I still think\nthat with respect to the ads in the 30 days before the\nprimary and the 60 days before the -- the general\nelection, that corporation could look at this Court's\ndecision in McConnell and say, oh, I understand. Our\nremedy is not an as as-applied challenge. Our remedy --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If we want to place\nan ad in October, the solution is to place an ad\nNovember through September, and then we're okay. And\nthe only reason we're going to do it November through\nSeptember is so we can do it in October?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, no.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's a pretty broad\ndefinition of a sham.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, no. The point would be in\nOctober either -- do exactly what this Court said at\npage 206 of the McConnell opinion: either make the ad\nin terms that doesn't expressly refer to the candidate\nwhich, if you're not interested in influencing the\ncandidate election, shouldn't be a problem, or fund\nthat one advertisement through a separate, segregated\nfund.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But on an issue like\nthis, the filibuster, it's the Senators who are doing\nit, and their ad referred to not only the Senator who\nwas up for election, but the one who was not.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I understand that, Mr. Chief\nJustice, but I think if you focus in on this particular\nad, you will see that whatever the true intent of the\nadvertisers here, this is the kind of ad that clearly\nwould have an impact on the election. I mean, it talks\nabout the -- the filibusters in colorful terms,\nassociates them with gridlock and with a state of\nemergency, and then associates it with a candidate.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You think Congress has the\npower to prohibit any First Amendment contact --\nconduct that might have an impact on the election? I\nmean, is that the criterion for whether it -- it can be\nprohibited?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, Justice Scalia, it's not.\nBut I think what this Court very clearly did in\nMcConnell is it rejected an argument that said that the\nonly thing that Congress could regulate is that which\nwas unambiguously targeted at candidate elections.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So you think there is a\ncompelling interest in preventing people from thinking\nabout an issue and then calling their Senator during\nthe blackout period. That's the compelling interest\nthat, in effect, you are arguing for.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, Justice Kennedy. What\nwe're arguing for stems from the observation that this\nCourt made in McConnell, which is that when you get up\nbetween 60 days before an election and you look at the\nads that are run, most of the ads, in fact, are\ndesigned to influence candidate elections. It's very\ndifficult to figure out exactly which ones, and there\nare very serious problems with adopting a very vague\nintent standard.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are -- are Web sites and\nchat rooms covered by the McCain-Feingold?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, they're not, Justice\nKennedy. The Internet is not covered.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But certainly under your\nview, they ought to be. If you funded a Web site which\nwas very popular or a chat room, I certainly think it\nshould come within your proscription so that we can't\ntalk about issues during an election.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, Justice Kennedy. I\nthink the fact that there are alternative methods\navailable to communicate these ideas in these ads is a\nvirtue, not a defect with this regulatory structure.\nAnd I would like to focus in on these ads\nbecause while it is true that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, why -- why not?\nSuppose -- suppose most people look at the Web site and\nthey don't listen to the -- listen to the radio. I\nthink certainly McCain-Feingold should be extended to\nthat under your view.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Kennedy, I --\nI'm not sure you really do think that -- that McCain-\nFeingold should be extended to that.\n(Laughter.)\nGENERAL CLEMENT: And I do think that this is\nan area where this Court, in fairness, has recognized\nthat -- that any effort to regulate in this area\neffectively has to avoid three pitfalls. And it's a very\ndifficult task for Congress. It has to avoid being vague.\nIt has to avoid being overbroad. And as your question\nsuggests, it also has to avoid being so under-inclusive\nand easy to evade that it can simply be circumvented in\na way that Congress can't achieve its purpose.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is the difference with\nthis? I mean, in my mind are possible as-applied\nchallenges. Bread for the City. Never supported the\ncandidate, worried about the hurricane in Louisiana.\nVote for relief for New Orleans. Write your Senator,\nSenator X.\nOrganization two. Never supported a\ncandidate one way or the other, but has an issue\nthey're always interested in, and they run ads cycle\nafter cycle after cycle and they don't want to pull\nthem just because October has come along.\nAll right? Now, think of those organizations\nwhere I think maybe, sure, maybe they'd win their as-\napplied challenge. And here, you're not arguing it --\nhe doesn't have a right to bring it. You're arguing,\nof course, he can bring an as-applied challenge. He's\njust going to lose given our rationale. All right?\nWhy?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I -- I want to be\nresponsive and I think the way to respond is that this\nCourt's decision recognized that these ads were going\nto be difficult to classify and that you needed some\nkind of bright line rule and that the consequences of\nhaving a bright line rule in this consequence -- in\nthis area weren't terrible because there were\nalternative ways for them to communicate either through\na separate, segregated fund which served the interests\nof the statute or by avoiding the kind of references\nthat would raise serious questions about tying the ad\nto a candidate election.\nAnd I think if you look at -- if -- if you\nwant to keep the possibility open of some as-applied\nchallenge and you focus on these ads, these are ads\nthat clearly, I think, would implicate the concerns of\nCongress.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What was the bright line\nrule that -- that you think the -- the opinion\nestablished? I thought the bright line rule was\nwhether it's an issue ad or -- or, rather, a phony\nissue ad. I thought that was the -- the line that --\nthat the opinion was trying to -- to draw. You -- you\nsay that the opinion drew the line between what? All\nissue ads are out?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think all issue ads that\ncome within the statutory prohibition are permissibly\nregulable. I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No issue ads during the --\nthe blackout.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Sure, you can run issue ads\nas long as you either fund them through a separate,\nsegregated fund or you --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- omit the reference to the\ncandidate.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, of course, I know.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: And -- and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And stand on your head. But\nthe --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Within -- within the\nframework of the statute, you think the clear line that\nis established by the opinion is no issue ads without\nthis special funding during the blackout. You think\nthat's what the opinion says?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think that this -- I do\nthink that is what the opinion says and stands for. And\nI think this Court recognized --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why does it speak about sham\nissue ads?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, for one\nthing, I think it's important to recognize that the\ndiscussion about sham versus genuine issue ads was\nreally a factor of the fact that necessarily in looking\nat the record there, what the Court had to do is look\nat ads that were run in previous election cycles where\nthis regulatory structure wasn't in place and try to\nclassify those ads. And as I understand it, sort of\ngenuine versus sham was a way of capturing whether or\nnot it was an ad that seemed primarily focused on an\nissue or primarily focused on a candidate election.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why did you say there were 7\npercent of these that -- that are probably okay?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I'm not sure which figure Mr.\nBopp is referring to as the 7 percent figure. I don't\n-- I don't remember conceding that 7 percent of the ads\nwere okay.\nAnd I think what we very clearly said -- and\nif you go back and look at our briefs, as I did, I\nthink you'll see this. What we very clearly said --\nand the Court picked up on it in that line on page 206\nthat Justice O'Connor read earlier -- is that whatever\nwas true about a retrospective analysis of ads that\nwere run in an election cycle that wasn't governed by\nthe statute, that in the future corporations could\navoid the -- the strictures of the statute by simply\ndoing one of two things: either avoiding making an\nexpress reference to the candidate, which ought not to\nbe too difficult if you're really just engaged in issue\nadvocacy, not trying to influence a candidate election,\nor alternatively, you can fund it through the separate,\nsegregated fund.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I deny the first thing,\nthat it's easy to do issue ads without naming the\ncandidate. The -- the point of an issue ad is to put\npressure on -- on the candidate that you want to vote\nyour way. Without -- without telling people to call --\nnot the candidate -- the -- the incumbent that you want\nto vote your way -- without telling people to call the\noffice of that incumbent, you're not doing very much.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, they\ndidn't even do that in this ad, as has already been\npointed out. And if they would have said find out what\nyou can do to stop judicial filibusters, visit\nbefair.org, and avoided a reference to Senator\nFeingold, they could have run this through their\ngeneral treasury funds. But they couldn't resist the\ntemptation to mention Senator Feingold in this context\n--\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Could they have said in\nthe ad, call your elected representatives, not naming\nany names?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Yes, Justice O'Connor, they\nalso could have done that.\nAnd I think that the very fact that they\ncouldn't resist the temptation to link the filibuster\nissue to Senator Feingold is not that surprising --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: General --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That may be because\nthe people who were doing the filibuster were the\nSenators. It's not -- it's not a surprising thing to\nlink the Senators to that issue.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, and again, Mr. Chief\nJustice, though, I mean, fair enough, but I think you\nalso have to keep in mind that this is a context where\nthis filibuster issue isn't some idiosyncratic interest\nof the appellant here. This is an issue that was\nidentified as a campaign issue by the -- by -- by the\ncandidates opposing Senator Feingold, by the Wisconsin\nRepublican Party, and by appellant's own PAC. And to\nthe extent you're trying to figure out whether this was\nreally designed to influence the pending legislative\nvotes or the election, the timing of this ad strongly\nsuggests it was designed to influence the election.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The fact that it\nmentions both -- the fact that it mentions both\nSenators strongly suggests to me that it's concerned\nabout the issue because one of the Senators wasn't up\nfor election.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, that\ngets back to Justice Stevens' question as to whether or\nnot these categories are mutually exclusive. I'm not\nhere to tell you that appellants weren't genuinely\nissued about -- genuinely interested about the\nfilibuster issue. I think they were also, as their\npolitical action committee press release shows,\ngenuinely interested in sending Senator Feingold\npacking. And they had an opportunity to run this ad\nand effectively get a twofer by naming Senator\nFeingold. Now, they could have resisted that and only\ngotten the influence on the -- the filibuster issue, if\nthey had taken the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And they -- and they could\nhave -- they could have named Senator Kohl, I take it.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: They -- they could have,\nSenator Kennedy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's such an odd calculus.\nWho is the person more likely to be influenced with an\nissue ad? The person who's running or the person who's\nnot going to run for 4 years? Obviously, the former.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Obviously --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's -- and that's\nthe one area where the ad is prohibited.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Obviously, you're right,\nJustice Kennedy, but obviously, there are concerns that\nare implicated when somebody is running in cycle and\nthe ad has targeted the electorate in the immediate\nrun-up to the election that aren't present there with\nSenator Kohl and, therefore, the Congress has -- has\nstruck a different balance in that case.\nBut just to focus on the timing of these ads,\nthey were run on day 4 of a 45-day August recess of the\nSenate. Now, that timing, if what you were trying to\ndo, is to influence a pending legislative vote, is\nvery, very odd timing. It could hardly be worse. If,\non the other hand, you're trying to influence the\nupcoming election, the timing of that ad makes a great\ndeal of sense.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if you're\ntrying to influence the Senators who are presumably or\npossibly in their home State during a recess, that's\nperfect timing to influence the Senators who are the\nones engaging in the filibuster --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I'm not sure I would --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- without regard to\nwhether they're running for election or not.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, Mr. Chief\nJustice, I'm not sure I'd pick day 4 of the August\nrecess to do that. Maybe 14 days before they're going\nback, something like that, would be an appropriate time\nto catch their attention in a -- in a period where\nthey're going to remember it when they go and vote.\nBut I think day 4 of a 45-day recess is probably not\nwhen I would pick to start running these ads.\nI don't suggest, though, the timing factor or\nany other one factor ought to be dispositive. I think\nwhat it goes to show is how difficult it would be to\ntry to get into a fact-intensive as-applied analysis of\nthese various issues. And all of that presumably would\nhave to be done in the context of TRO hearings and\npreliminary injunction hearings on the eve of\nelections.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I've lost track of\nit. Your -- your answer to Justice Breyer's\nhypothetical about Bread for the City and the hurricane\nand all that is that that would be an illegal ad?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, no, I think my answer to\nthat would be that we'd still be here suggesting that\nthat's controlled. I think my answer was also that\nthat would be a far better as-applied challenge than\nthe one that this Court has before it.\nAnd I think, you know, in -- in one sense we\nmake this point in the brief. I mean, contrasting this\ncase with a case like MCFL I think is quite\ninstructive. There, you're not focused on the content\nor intent of specific ads. You look at the\norganization as a whole and come up with fairly bright\nlines. And once you've made a determination about the\norganization in an as-applied challenge, you're done\nwith the issue.\nHere, the kind of --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So you do -- you do an\nideological history, an ideological pedigree of various\nspeakers. You think that's consistent with the First\nAmendment? That -- that was the ACLU's suggestion\nwhich, it seems to me, shows you how far we've gone\ndown this road.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I mean, that may speak\nabout where the ACLU is going. I don't think it speaks\nabout where this Court is going because this Court\nhasn't adopted that test. The test that this Court\nadopted in MCFL would -- did not get into that kind of\ninquiry. What it did is it focused on three relatively\nbright line factors about whether you accept corporate\nmoney, whether you have other sources of income from\nthe corporation, and whether or not you were formed\nexpressly for political views but without any sort of\ncensorship or inquiry into what kind of political\nviews. And that I think this Court has found\nadministrable.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: The FEC administers that.\nThat's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's what I want to know\nexactly. I didn't think -- I thought Congress\nconsidered this impossible question. I thought that 7\npercent figure was from a study, in fact, dozens of\nstudies, where these people who were experts, quote,\ndecided that about 7 percent of the ads like this one\ndistinguishing between really interested in issues or\ninterested in issues but, in significant part,\ndefeating the Senator. In the latter, of course, it's\ncampaign and it's part of the regulation of campaign\nfunds.\nBut they didn't think we could do it. They\nthought first they could do it, and then they told the\nFEC to go and produce a set of regs that would, in\nfact, try to screen out that legitimate 7 percent. Am\nI wrong about how the statute was supposed to work?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, you're not wrong, Justice\nBreyer. And I would say that the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why haven't they done\nit?\nAnd I had thought also that they were\nsupposed to control 527's by having regs or individual\ncases that would decide whether there was a mix of\npersonnel between the campaign and the 527, whether\nthey talked to people and planned their strategy. Have\nthere been those regs written?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Breyer, let me\nanswer both questions.\nAs to the 527 issue, as I understand it, the\ncommission has decided to proceed on case-by-case\ninquiries and has not tried to have a broad regulatory\napproach yet.\nNow, on to the issue of electioneering\ncommunications, you're absolutely right that there is a\nstatutory authorization to create exceptions. But the\nregulatory authority of the commission is limited, and\nit's limited in the sense that they can't approve an\nexception that would allow for ads that engage -- that\n-- that fairly read, engage in promoting, attacking,\nsupporting, or opposing a candidate.\nAnd what the FEC has found in practice is\nthat it's very difficult to create that kind of\nregulatory exception because, as this Court recognized\nin Buckley and in McConnell, one does not want to\nnaively underestimate the creativity of corporate\nspenders or political consultants. And if you create a\nbright line and say, all right, if you do this, that's\ngrassroots lobbying, that's not electioneering\ncommunication, they're going to be able to drive a\ntruck through that kind of exception --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: General --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- unless you're exceedingly\ncareful.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: General Clement, if you\ncould clarify for me some -- a response that Mr. Bopp\ngave. Did this ad run, was it broadcast or televised\nbefore the blackout period?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, as I\nunderstand the record, the first effort to broadcast\nthis ad was on, I think, July 26th, and that was sort\nof a few days before the -- the cutoff period would\nkick in. So there was an effort by a matter of weeks\nto broadcast this ad. But I think, you know, whether\none views that as setting the stage for this litigation\nor being kind of an independent decision, I'll -- I'll\nleave to others.\nWhat I think is important, though, is that\nalthough they were engaged on this issue before then,\nup until that point, they had found it perfectly\nsatisfactory to engage on the issue without engaging in\nbroadcast advertisement.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you one other\nthing about the setting? When you went to the Web site\nto get further information, what was conveyed about\nSenator Feingold when you went to get that further\ninformation?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I\n-- I don't have as good an answer for that as I would\nlike because the -- the Web site is now defunct. And\nso maybe Mr. Bopp can answer that in rebuttal.\nAs I understand it, consistent with what\nJustice Breyer said, that there was sort of additional\narguments about the Feingold record on -- on\nfilibusters and Senator Kohl's record on filibusters,\nand then there was -- there was information about how\nto contact them.\nBut I think, again, as -- as Mr. Bopp has\nsaid, if -- if you don't find the broadcast medium a\nparticularly effective way to convey the phone numbers\nand you have to reference people to the Web site\nanyways, the very fact that you could reference them to\nthe Web sites without naming the candidates' names and\navoid the strictures entirely seems like the kind of\nthing that this Court had in mind when it said on page\n206 that there were ways to deal with this problem\nprospectively and that you didn't need a as-applied\nchallenge like this one.\nAnd again, I think you can't overestimate the\ndifficulties here because --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: General Clement, you --\nyou've pointed out the difficulties, but I don't know\nany other area where we said, well, you know, the --\nthe -- when you're dealing with important -- important\nfreedoms, important guarantees, where we shrug our\nshoulders and say, well, the only way to accomplish\nwhat the Government wants to do is to ride right --\nright over those guarantees. I mean, we say, we -- we\ncannot bust up this -- this drug conspiracy unless we\nuse warrantless searches. So, you know, whatever it\ntakes. We don't -- we don't operate that way. And\nhere, you're -- you're dealing with a very fundamental\nguarantee --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- the -- the right which I\nthink applies to corporations, as well as to anybody\nelse, and for individuals to associate with one another\nto bring to bear influence on the legislative process.\nThat's a fundamental guarantee. And it doesn't\nsatisfy me to say, well, there's no other way to stop\npeople from criticizing incumbents during -- during the\nelection blackout period. Maybe you can't do entirely\nwhat you want to do.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I hope that's not the\ncase, Justice Scalia. Let me give you two other First\nAmendment examples: the first admittedly involving\nintermediate scrutiny; the second, a strict scrutiny\ncase.\nThe first thing I have in mind is the\ncontribution limits themselves. This Court has fully\nadmitted that it doesn't have a scalpel to probe the\ndifference between $2,000, $1,000, $4,000 as a\ncontribution limit. And it's perfectly willing to\nadmit in its opinions that not every high-value donor\nis going to be involved in an effort at corruption.\nYet, this Court approved the approach of the\ncontribution limits, which are hard to understand as\nanything other than prophylactic limits. Now, that's\nan example from intermediate scrutiny.\nEven in the strict scrutiny context, though,\na case like Burson, I mean, this Court understood and\nsaid in the opinion, we can't tell whether 75 feet\nwould be precisely okay or whether 90 feet or 100 feet.\nWe don't have a scalpel to probe that either. But\nwe're going to approve 100 feet because it's a basic\nway of dealing with this problem, identifying the area\nof potential concern, and people can do their\nelectioneering 101 feet away. They can do it here on\nthe 61st day. They can do it through the segregated\nfund. I think that is an approach that this Court has\nfound acceptable, even in the First Amendment area, in\ndealing with these intractable problems.\nAnd I think Buckley --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But both of those\nexamples, of course, are quantities, and once you -- I\nthink it was Holmes who said, once you admit the\nnecessity of drawing a line, you know, you can always\nfind something on one side or the other. It's quite\ndifferent between $1,000 and $2,000 or 100 feet and 75\nfeet and advocacy with respect to an election and\nadvocacy with respect to an issue. It's an entirely\ndifferent quality of a distinction, it seems to me.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and the difference\n-- the difference is this is a content-based inquiry.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well but, Justice Kennedy,\nprecisely because you can't engage in just a formless\ncontent-based inquiry and precisely because there isn't\nany neat division between issue ads and candidate ads,\nthat is why you need to have a different regulatory\napproach. I mean, this Court recognized --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I think the real bottom\nline for the -- your opponent is that even a pure\nelection ad should get the same constitutional\nprotection as an issue ad, which is something we've\nrejected.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Absolutely, Justice Stevens.\nAnd of course, an even position one step intermediary\nfrom that or one step backtracking from that would be\nto say that all Congress can do in this area is\nregulate those ads that are unambiguously election\noriented. And, of course, what's the class of those\nads? Well, that would be express advocacy.\nAnd the one thing that I think is clear from\nthis Court's decision in McConnell is this Court made\nclear that express advocacy is not a constitutional\nline. Congress is not disempowered to go after mixed\nads that are -- yes, they have a component of issue\nads, but you bet you they're intended to influence the\nelection. Those ads are what are at issue here, and I\nthink in order to be able to regulate those in a way\nthat makes sense, the key is to regulate in a way\nthat's not vague, that's not overbroad, but is not so\nunder-inclusive that it can be easily evaded.\nAnd I think Buckley shows how hard that is.\nIt's a tall order. In Buckley, this Court had a\nprovision of FECA that prohibited independent\nexpenditures related to a candidate election. The only\nway the Court could save that provision from the\nvagueness concern was to limit it to express advocacy.\nBut having done that, the Court said, well, it's so\nlimited, it's so easy to evade, we're going to find\nthat it fails strict scrutiny.\nIn McConnell, this Court said that in BCRA,\nafter careful study, Congress had actually found out a\nway to avoid those three pitfalls. All of the proposed\nalternatives of -- of appellants run headlong into one\nor more of those obstacles. Look at the tests they've\nproposed. They've proposed looking at 16 factors, 4\ndetails. They disclaim any interest intent, but any of\nthose tests I think would be vague and unworkable.\nIn contrast, they pluck a definition from the\nIRS regs that is designed to deal with 501(c)(3)\ncorporations in a completely different context or a\nmodification of a proposal by BCRA's sponsors, and they\n-- and they put those tests out there. And those would\nbe very, very easy to evade in practice.\nIn fact, I think if you use some of the tests\nthat they propose or their amici proposed and you look\nat the body of ads that were before this Court in\nMcConnell, you'd end up finding that a substantial\npercentage of them were grassroots lobbying.\nWell, if one thing has to be inconsistent\nwith this Court's decision in McConnell, it's the\nconclusion that a substantial amount of the ads covered\nby this definition are unconstitutionally regulated\nbecause this Court clearly rejected a substantial\noverbreadth claim.\nThe one thing I would say in -- in closing is\nto understand that Congress, having sort of avoided\nthese very difficult pitfalls of vagueness,\noverbreadth, and easy evasion, came up with this\ndefinition in title II. But as this Court recognized\nin McConnell, title II of the statute does not stand\nalone. It is part and parcel of the broader regulatory\nregime here. And without title II, title I's\nlimitations on soft money contributions to parties will\nsucceed only in taking that soft money and directing it\nto corporations that are closely aligned with\ncandidates or with the parties themselves.\nThis statutory as-applied challenge that you\nhave before it -- you strikes at the heart of the\nMcConnell decision and at the heart of BCRA's title II.\nThis Court should reject the invitation to revisit the\nMcConnell decision and should give Congress' effort in\nthis area a fair chance at success.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\nMr. Bopp, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES BOPP, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BOPP: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nWhat this -- what plaintiffs are relying upon\nhere is the distinction that this Court has made\nbetween lobbying, on the one hand, and political\ncampaigns on the other. As summarized by Justice\nStevens' concurrence in Austin, quote, there is a vast\ndifference between lobbying and debating public issues,\non the one hand, and political campaigns for election\nto public office on the other hand. And that is\nbecause that the interests that have justified the\nregulation of corporate electioneering do not apply to\ncorporate --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: There is a vast difference,\nbut the question I have is whether Congress has any\nvoice in trying to draw the line that divides the two\ncategories.\nMR. BOPP: I think they do, and they drew a\nline that was upheld on its face because the vast\nmajority of ads --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And -- and if we are in a\ngray area that there's some who could say it's issue\nand some could say it's electioneering, do we owe any\ndeference to Congress' test that it has drafted?\nMR. BOPP: I -- I don't think you owe\ndeference to the test. Under strict scrutiny, you owe\nthe fidelity of the Constitution, and the Constitution\nconcludes the right to petition.\nSo it is a difficult question. It's fact-\nintensive, as all as-applied questions are.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So your position basically\nwould say we should take all of these cases on a case-\nby-case basis and not give any presumptive weight to\nwhat -- what Congress has done.\nMR. BOPP: No. I think that you can draw a\nrule that relies on objective criteria, just as you\nhave in the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, to distinguish\nbetween illegitimate efforts to -- for predatory\nanticompetitive practices or monopolies, to distinguish\nbetween those and -- and -- the Court has even used the\nphrase, genuine efforts to influence Congress with\nrespect to -- or any governmental agency with respect\nto the adoption of laws.\nThat has been based on objective criteria as\nthe Court has explained. You have adopted objective\ncriteria to distinguish lawsuits that fall within the\nright to a petition or those that were brought\nillegitimately for anticompetitive reasons.\nIt's not that this is -- this exercise is an\neasy exercise, but it is demanded by the fact that the\n-- the Congress adopted a very broad statute. The only\ncontent in this electioneering communication provision\n-- the only content requirement is that you name the\ncandidate. And the reality is that those candidates\noften are incumbents and they are engaged in lawmaking\nfunctions during these election periods.\nI mean, there is a difference like in\nBritain. You know, Parliament is dissolved so that\nthere -- there is a bright line distinction between an\nelection and Parliament actually exercising\ngovernmental power. But when these things overlap and\nwhen the Constitution demands the recognition of the\nright to petition, then that needs to be dealt with in\nthis as-applied challenge.\nNow, there's a vast -- there's a huge number\nof -- of lobby groups. They have made a conscious\ndecision that it is more important to them to influence\nwhat Government does today than to influence in a\nspeculative and remote manner who is going to be\nexercising that power next year through elections.\nWisconsin Right to Life, in the face of these\nrestrictions, have still decided that it's more\nimportant to lobby than it is to advocate the election\nor defeat of candidates and give money to candidates.\nThe -- this is just the reality of our complex\nGovernment. It's the reality of the freedoms that\nindividuals have to participate in that Government.\nIt's not just about elections. It's more importantly\nabout lawmaking and citizens have a robust right to\nparticipate in that lawmaking power, and as a result,\nthis Court should recognize an as-applied exception for\ngrassroots lobbying.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Bopp.\n"
