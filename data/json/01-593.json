        "content": "(10:07 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in Number 01-593, the Dole Food Company versus\nPatrickson, and a companion case.\nMr. Paden.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER R. PADEN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. PADEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThe Dead Sea Bromine Company is an\ninstrumentality of Israel under the Foreign Sovereign\nImmunities Act for three principal reasons.\nQUESTION: Is it -- is it owned in the same\ncapacity now as it was earlier?\nMR. PADEN: No -- no, it is not, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And was it owned at the time the suit\nwas filed?\nMR. PADEN: At the time this suit was filed, the\ncompany had been privatized. It was privatized in 1995.\nQUESTION: Right. Right, and so are you going\nto address, then, how it comes under the statute at all in\nthose circumstances?\nMR. PADEN: I certainly intend to do that, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. PADEN: The three reasons, in sum, are that,\nthroughout the period of time giving rise to the claims,\nIsrael owned a majority of the shares or other ownership\ninterests in the company. We contend that this broad\nphrase plainly encompasses the majority ownership of Dead\nSea Bromine that Israel indisputably possessed through a\ntiered ownership structure.\nSecondly, a contrary interpretation cannot be\nreconciled with the basic purposes of the act. The same\npolicy that Congress found applicable to directly owned\nentities apply equally to their subsidiaries where the\nforeign State retains a majority interest. To restrict\ninstrumentalities to entities in which States hold legal\ntitle to the shares of stock would exclude a large number\nof the very types of State-owned commercial enterprises,\nshipping and airlines, mining operations and the like,\nthat Congress specifically intended to bring within the\nreach of the statute.\nQUESTION: Yes, but it's a lot of trouble to\ntrack these things back, you know, who owns shares many\ntiers up, and Congress might well have simply determined\nwe will honor the sovereignty of other States when they're\nthe principal stockholder of a corporation. Where --\nwhere they are not, we are not impugning their sovereignty\nby going ahead and permitting -- permitting suit against\nthe entity. That's certainly a rational -- a rational\ndisposition, and the language seems to suggest that.\nMR. PADEN: Well, Your Honor, I -- I don't\ndisagree that that would be a rational disposition, but I\ndon't think there's any indication in the case law, and\nthere have been numerous cases where tiered entities have\nappeared before courts, that it's posed any particular\nproblem to identify the tiered ownership structure. I --\nI'm not aware of any cases where -- where that's posed an\nenormous issue, and the computation of ownership and\ncorporate -- corporate responsibility for subsidiaries is\nan issue that lawyers deal with every day in commercial\nlitigation, and lawyers have well-established techniques\nto ferret out the corporate change of ownership and\nit's -- it's done all the time.\nWe don't think -- it clearly can be an issue,\nbut we don't think that that's a particularly\ninsurmountable issue here, and, in fact, there's certainly\nno indication --\nQUESTION: Your -- your principle would apply no\nmatter how many tiers up they go? I -- I assume you don't\nthink the second tier is the limit?\nMR. PADEN: So long as the State's ownership\ninterest is the majority ownership interest, Your Honor,\nthere could be --\nQUESTION: Even though the name of the State\ndoes not appear until you get six tiers up?\nMR. PADEN: That's correct. Our position would\nbe that so long as the State's interest is a majority\ninterest, that would be the limiting principle, and I\nthink that's what the words of the statute seem\nto suggest --\nQUESTION: Why do you limit to the majority?\nSupposing they have practical control as in other\nsituations, you look at who really runs the company.\nMR. PADEN: Well, the statute says majority\nownership, Your Honor, and we think that --\nQUESTION: But it doesn't say majority ownership\nof grandchildren of the parent.\nMR. PADEN: It says a majority ownership\ninterest, Your Honor, and we think a majority ownership\ninterest is about as broad a term as -- as could be\nconjured up to try to describe generically the concept of\nownership. I think Congress had in mind that this statute\nwas going to apply to entities from nations all around the\nworld, with many different kinds of economic systems, and\nin some countries the notion of ownership isn't even so\nclearly established.\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I suppose it could mean\nownership of other forms, for instance, an oil-drilling\nventure, a working interest of 70 percent, which is not\nusually called a share. It's --\nMR. PADEN: That's true.\nQUESTION: So -- so there -- there's work for\nthat phrase in the statute to do without adopting your\nposition, it seems to me.\nMR. PADEN: There is. There are certainly other\nkinds of ownership in our legal system -- partnership\ninterests are an obvious example -- which don't\nnecessarily refer to share ownership.\nBut ownership interest is a very, very broad\nterm, and it -- we think that if Congress had intended\nthis to be so specifically limited to direct -- directly\nowned entities, it would have said directly owned --\nQUESTION: Well, it can --\nQUESTION: Your argument would be stronger if it\nwere a stand-alone term, but it isn't. It comes after\nshares, and so one can say, well, we're going to read\nownership interest, shares or other ownership interest as\nsomething, say, equivalent to a stock certificate.\nYou -- it -- it doesn't just say, ownership\ninterest, and I think that that's why the statute itself\ndoesn't answer the question.\nMR. PADEN: Well, we think, Your Honor, that the\nphrase needs to be read as a whole, and we do not believe\nthat this is a situation, when the statute is read as a\nwhole, that the -- that the principle of redundancy and\nsuperfluousness which Judge Kozinski felt, decided in this\ncase dictated the -- the restriction to direct ownership\nshould apply.\nQUESTION: Do you -- do you agree with the\nrespondents' contention, the United States' contention\nthat foreign countries would not -- would not give us this\nbreak, that generally speaking, in international law\nthey -- they'll only look to the ownership of the\nimmediate company?\nMR. PADEN: I -- I think that that's true, Your\nHonor, but I think it requires a comment. I think that\nthe -- the structure of this statute very uniquely\nreflects our Federalist system, and -- and the -- this\nalleged disparity between treatment in this country and\nother countries I think is something of a red herring.\nCongress for the most part, in establishing this system,\nI believe it's fair to say contemplated that commercially\nowned ventures of foreign States would be subject to suit,\nthat --\nQUESTION: I -- I thought -- I remember when\nthey enacted the FSIA. I was around, and I -- I recollect\nquite vividly that its object was to bring United States\ndomestic law into conformity with the new, accepted\ninternational determination of when -- when sovereign\nimmunity should be respected and when it shouldn't, and if\nthat's the case, and if you acknowledge that the general\nprinciple internationally is not to go beyond the\nownership of the immediate company, then I don't know why\nlanguage which -- which is susceptible of that meaning\nshouldn't be given that meaning.\nMR. PADEN: I think there's an answer to that\nquestion, Your Honor. In -- in foreign nations, an entity\nwould be subject to suit, but it would typically be\nsubject to suit -- I don't think there are too many\nforeign countries that have our Federalist system, and\ncertainly not too many foreign countries that have our\ndeeply ingrained right to a jury trial. Congress, for the\nmost part, was saying these suits should go forward.\nOne of the purposes of the act was to bring\ncommercially owned ventures of foreign States within the\nsubject of -- of litigation and make them susceptible to\nclaims, but Congress said that in doing that, because of\npotential sensitivities that could exist, they would\naccord those entities the same kinds of privileges that\nthe Federal Government gets when the Federal Government\nwaives its immunity, so that --\nQUESTION: How can they be sensitive to\nsomething that they're willing to do to us? I mean,\nthe -- the potential sensitivity, if -- if they would hold\nthe United States liable in such a situation, I mean,\nwould -- would not recognize sovereign immunity of the --\nof the indirectly owned United States entity, how could\nthey be offended by our doing the same?\nMR. PADEN: My sense is that the Congress'\nconcern about sensitivities was -- was a little different\nthan that. I don't think the notion was offense at being\nsued. I think the notion is that foreign States would\nhave a -- an -- a -- an interest, potentially -- not in\nevery single case, but potentially significant interest in\nthe manner and treatment of claims against entities\nthat -- that they owned. They may have --\nQUESTION:\ncountries that have our dual Federal system with State\ncourts and Federal courts, so you're not urging that\nthere's substantive sovereign immunity. You're saying, on\nthe jurisdiction side, you should have a right, or\nCongress meant to give you a right to have access to\nFederal court rather than State court.\nMR. PADEN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nThere -- there are cases, but I think they're quite rare,\nwhere a commercial entity might actually be able to\ncontend that it has immunity, but for the most part,\nCongress was thinking --\nQUESTION: Are you contending that here?\nMR. PADEN: Well, we've pled it in our answer,\nYour Honor, but the issue has -- has not been crossed in\nthis particular case, because the judge in -- in the\ndistrict court held that we weren't even a foreign State,\nso the question didn't even arise.\nThere are -- whether or not an entity is immune,\nof course, if it is a foreign State, depends upon whether\none of the exceptions in the statute applies, and the\ncommercial activity exception requires direct effects on\nthe United States, and so forth. There's -- there are\nissues of treaty waivers, there are a number of issues --\nQUESTION: For purposes of your argument now,\ncan we assume that you are not claiming the substantive\nimmunity and the question is a forum question, whether you\ncan have access to a Federal forum?\nMR. PADEN: I think you can assume that, Your\nHonor, but I think --\nQUESTION: Counsel for -- I'm just not sure we\never get to this question. This statute, the foreign\nsovereign immunity statute is written in the present\ntense. It talks about an entity that is a separate legal\nperson, and a majority of whose shares or other ownership\ninterest is owned by a foreign State, and when the action\nwas filed, there was no such ownership, so how do we even\nget to the first question?\nMR. PADEN: We get to the first question, Your\nHonor, because the use of the present tense does not\nclearly indicate the point in time at which the present\ntense exists. This statute uses the present tense in many\ncircumstances in some of the subsequent provisions that\ndiscuss immunity to discuss actions that clearly took\nplace at the time the events arose.\nQUESTION: Well, what do we do with diversity\njurisdiction? Supposing a person -- supposing diversity\njurisdiction exists at the time the suit is filed, but by\nthe time it gets up on appeal, it does not?\nMR. PADEN: I don't -- the font, the\njurisdictional font of this statute, Your Honor is not\ndiversity, it's Federal question. This --\nQUESTION: No, but I -- I would like to know\njust for purposes of analogy, the -- when something exists\nat the time the suit is filed, but is lost during its\nprocess.\nMR. PADEN: I think that's going to have to be\nan issue that is decided in -- in cases as they develop.\nThere have been some cases where entities were privatized\nduring the course of litigations, and courts, I believe,\nhave consistently held that in that case, the immunity --\nthe Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act jurisdictional\npremise is not lost because it existed at the time of the\nclaim.\nThe preponderant case law here, Your Honor, has\nbeen to look either to the time of the acts that gave rise\nto the claim, or to the time of the filing of the suit,\nand there's a -- a nice opinion by Judge Kaplan in the\nSouthern District, in -- in the Belgrade case, which kind\nof synthesizes those cases.\nWe -- the -- in the jurisdictional determination\nunder this statute, the way it's structured, a court very\nfrequently has to look at the acts giving rise to the\nclaim in order even to decide if it has jurisdiction,\nbecause, as Your Honor will recall, in section 1330,\njurisdiction depends upon a determination, a) that a party\nis a foreign State, and b) that one of the exceptions\napplies, and most of those exceptions require an\nexamination, whether or not the acts that gave rise to the\nclaim were commercial in nature, where they took place, so\nthat the -- it's not at all unusual in the context of this\nstatute to say that the actions that gave rise to the\nclaim are the point of reference for the jurisdictional\ndetermination.\nQUESTION: Why -- why would we do that? If\nwe -- if we took your view, there are quite a few\njurisdictional statutes, I guess, which talk about action\nagainst a foreign State. Wouldn't we then have to read\nall those to say they mean actions against a former\nforeign State, so if you sued Illyria or Bohemia, you\nwould suddenly discover you could get into Federal court,\nwhile if you don't take your -- your approach, you'd say\nthe -- the question of -- that you're worried about will\narise when they get to the substance of the issue in the\nState court.\nMR. PADEN: Your Honor, we think that looking at\nthe time of the events that gave rise to the claim is the\napproach that most closely comports with the policies and\npurposes behind this act.\nWhat Congress was sensitive about is when the\nactions of foreign State instrumentalities are called\nbefore the courts of the United States to be adjudicated,\nand Congress indicated that there were sensitivities in\nthose situations that -- should be respected by according\na broad right to hear in court --\nQUESTION: What's -- what's the sensitivity if\nsomebody decides to sue Czarist Russia?\nMR. PADEN: Well, there's probably a statute of\nlimitations claims on that, Your Honor, but I think the\nquestion is whether the -- whether the acts that gave rise\nto the claim are at issue in the case, and I don't think\nit's difficult to imagine --\nQUESTION: You know, there -- I -- I just don't\nagree with you that that's -- that's the policy of the\nUnited States. There -- apart from who can get into\nFederal court, there -- there is in Federal law a thing\ncalled the Act of State Doctrine under which we will -- we\nwill honor and accept the action of a foreign country\nconducted within its own borders and will not allow that\nto be challenged in a suit in the United States. It's\na -- it's a longstanding doctrine, and yet we do --\ncertainly do not say that any time an act of State is\ninvolved in a piece of litigation, there's Federal\njurisdiction.\nThis act doesn't seek to do that. It seems to\nme the Federal jurisdiction has nothing to do with whether\nthe actions of a foreign State are the -- are the subject\nmatter of the litigation, but rather whether the foreign\nState is a party to the litigation.\nMR. PADEN: Well, Your Honor, except for Judge\nKozinski below, every circuit court that has looked at\nthis and looked at the legislative history has concluded,\nas did the ABA working group, which recently did an\nextensive study of this statute, and that group was made\nup of prominent international relations professors and\npractitioners, that actions of foreign States remain\npotentially politically sensitive even after an entity is\nsold.\nThe potential here is the point. This is kind\nof a prophylactic statute. I don't think anybody's saying\nthat in each and every case, there will be intense foreign\nrelations issues, but I -- for example, the foreign State\nmay very well have ongoing financial obligations for\npre-privatization acts. That's the case with one of the\namici before the Court today in the State of France.\nQUESTION: Mr. Paden, if you would look\nparticularly to the diversity statute, and now there's\na -- a provision that expressly deals with a foreign\nState, everything else in diversity, you would agree, it\ndepends on the time suit was brought, and so if you moved\nin the interim -- there was diversity when it happened,\nbut you move in the interim, when the complaint is filed\nthere's no more diversity.\nI take it you're asking us, within the very same\nstatute, 1332(a), to interpret a foreign State differently\nso that its nationality at the time of suit doesn't count,\nonly at the time of the act, and that would be anomalous\nwithin very same provision, 1332(a), that you would treat\none one way, citizens of different States, that has to be\nas of the time the complaint is filed, but a foreign State\nonly at the time the event occurred.\nMR. PADEN: Well, two responses, if I may.\nFirst of all, we're not suggesting that it should only be\nthe time of the events that gave rise to the claim. We\nbelieve the appropriate rule is the rule expressed in the\nconsensus of case law today, that it would be either the\ntime the claim was filed, or the time of the acts.\nBut your question about section -- section 1330\nis -- is a very good question.\nQUESTION: It was 1332 I'm --\nMR. PADEN: 1332, that refers to claims by\nforeign States. When a foreign State entity is -- is a\nplaintiff and chooses to come to this Court.\nThe -- the statute that we're alluding to is\nwhen -- when people are trying to assert claims against\nthese entities and -- and bring them into court and have\ntheir actions adjudicated in courts that the State --\nQUESTION: So you're saying in court -- to be a\nplaintiff, the foreign State would have to be -- it would\nhave to be a foreign entity at the time suit was brought?\nMR. PADEN: The instrumentality has a choice\nwhether or not to come to court in that circumstance, Your\nHonor, and invoke -- and -- and --\nQUESTION: It's not a question of whether it --\nit chooses to. It -- does it have access?\nMR. PADEN: The -- the --\nQUESTION: In other words, does it have to\nqualify as a foreign instrumentality when it brings the\nsuit?\nMR. PADEN: I don't think --\nQUESTION: Suppose it's been privatized. Can it\ncome into Federal court and say, we were at the time of\nthis incident that we're suing about?\nMR. PADEN: I believe that if the acts at -- at\nstake took place at the time it was a foreign sovereign,\nit should be able to do that, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Those are -- then you are\ninterpreting within the very same statute a citizen of a\nState would be treated one way, or a -- a -- an entity\nthat was once a foreign State but is no longer would be\ntreated another way?\nMR. PADEN: That's correct. I think the\nquestion -- whether or not an entity is a foreign State,\nthe analysis is the same, but for purposes of when that\nanalysis is pertinent, it may be different. It may be\ndifferent when we're talking about what -- the rules about\nexecution of judgments than at the time of filing a claim.\nThe -- the opposite rule, we think, leads to\ngreater anomalies. Under the opposite rule, you --\nthere's a very clear prospect. There's almost an\ninevitability that liabilities attributable to acts of\nState instrumentalities are going to be adjudicated\noutside the structure and protections of this act. State\ncourt juries all around the country will be sitting in\njudgment on acts of State-owned entities, and that is\nfundamentally contrary to what Congress wanted to -- to\nhave happen.\nIn this very case I think we -- we posed a\nhypothetical that, if we just change the facts\nsignificantly but slightly, if -- if Dead Sea Bromine was\nthe sole manufacturer of the toxic, the pesticide at issue\nin this case, and if Dead Sea Bromine, the acts of a -- an\ninstrumentality of the State of Israel, closely monitored\nand overseen through the Government company's law\nstructure, have been alleged to be the sole manufacturer\nof this product, the man -- the party that sought and\nobtained approvals through, as alleged in the complaint,\nnot being entirely candid about known health risks, had\nknowingly marketed it in the Third World, had been --\nwhose actions had been called appalling by Senator Leahy\nin a public hearing, if that entity was on trial before a\nlot of different juries in various parts of Texas and\nLouisiana, being called up as a Israeli chemical company\nwho had done all these things, I think it's not at all\ndifficult to imagine that the State of Israel might have\nsome interest in that case.\nQUESTION: Well, you've made another significant\nchange, because it wasn't the plaintiffs who brought the\nIsraeli corporations into this action. The plaintiffs\nsued Dole, I thought, and Dole impleaded the Israeli\ncompany.\nMR. PADEN: That's definitely true, Your Honor,\nbut I'm simply trying to show that there could be a\nhypothetical situation that's not entirely far-fetched,\nwhere -- where a State's ongoing interest in litigation\nagainst an entity for acts that took place when the State\nhad responsibility for it in the sense that it owned it,\nwere at stake.\nQUESTION: Well, but if the State gives up the\ncorporation, and no longer is part of it, I would have\nthought that that's just one of the risks that they'd have\nto run. Why -- why -- I mean, they -- if they want -- if\nthey're worried about it, keep control of the corporation.\nIf you're not that worried about it, then when you release\nthe corporation, you're subject to a lot of State court\nlawsuits. Is that -- why is that --\nMR. PADEN: Well --\nQUESTION: I can't get much of a feeling one way\nor the other about that, to tell you the truth. I --\nI don't -- can you say something that will make it quite\nclear that would be a terrible thing?\nMR. PADEN: That's clearly a policy judgment,\nand what we're left with is this -- the wording of the\nstatute and the purposes and policies that lay behind it,\nand we think that with that information before us,\nCongress' concern about the risk and the sensitivities\nboth in terms of uniform -- the desirability for uniform\ndecisions and potential risks and bias that can take place\nin multifarious State court juries, those were to be not\npresent when we were going to allow claims to go forward\nagainst State entities, and where the acts at issue are\nthe acts of the State entity, those same interests would\nseem to be implicated.\nMany States -- privatization, of course, is a\nfairly widespread phenomenon in the last decade, and what\nhappened to our client has happened to many formerly State\nmajority-owned entities.\nQUESTION: And a lot of those tort claims are\ngoing to be for continuing actions, so in your view, if\nthe chemical is disseminated partly while the State is the\nowner of the company and partly while it isn't, then what\nhappens?\nMR. PADEN: If -- so long as within the\nallegations of the complaint, actions of a foreign State\ninstrumentality are at stake, then it should be within the\nclaim.\nYour Honor, this case poses an even, I think\nmore stark example. As -- as noted by the court below,\nthis particular litigation is, I think in Judge Kozinski's\nwords, one part of a large broadbased litigation, I think\nhe used the word war.\nThe Delgado case out of the Fifth Circuit was --\nit arose out of cases that began in 1994 in Texas, based\non the same claims, based upon the same structure of\nparties, and at that time we were majority-owned by\nIsrael, so under the rule propounded by the respondents\nand the Solicitor General there would be Federal\njurisdiction over the -- that part of the cases, but if\nsomeone waited to sue until later, there wouldn't be.\nI think Credit Lyonnais seems to be in the same position,\nbased upon the -- the information in the -- in the amicus\nbrief.\nQUESTION: Mr. Paden, because --\nQUESTION: I have one -- one small procedural\nquestion. Why is Dole properly before us? I want to make\nyou feel welcome here, but --\n[Laughter.]\nMR. PADEN: I do, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: You -- you impleaded -- you impleaded\nthe Dead Sea Companies, and they're the ones --\nMR. PADEN: I'm -- I represent Dead Sea, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: Oh, you represent Dead Sea?\nMR. PADEN: Yes. Dole is --\nQUESTION: Why -- why is Dole properly here?\nMR. PADEN: Dole, I believe -- Dole is\ninterested in -- in confirming the jurisdiction of the\nFederal court over this case and the jurisdiction of the\nFederal court will be established if our position is\nestablished, and to this extent, we have a common interest\nin this case, apart from --\nQUESTION: Did you -- did you join in removing,\nor did Dole file the removal petition?\nMR. PADEN: We filed the removal petition, Your\nHonor. I believe that Dole filed a supplemental removal\npetition on different grounds alleging Federal question\njurisdiction, which --\nQUESTION: Right. That's how it got up to the\nNinth Circuit.\nQUESTION: Yes, and -- and Dole was dismissed on\nthat -- on that ground, and that hasn't been appealed.\nMR. PADEN: Correct. That's --\nQUESTION: That -- that hasn't been brought --\nMR. PADEN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: And is there diverse -- there's no\ndiversity because there isn't complete diversity?\nMR. PADEN: Yes, that's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: I see.\nMR. PADEN: If I may, I'd like to reserve the\nrest of my time for rebuttal.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Paden.\nMr. Massey, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. MASSEY\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. MASSEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI'd like to begin with the first question\npresented. Owning shares of stock in a parent corporation\nin our view should not be equated with owning shares in\nthe subsidiary. I'd like to deal with the text of the\nact, the structure, and its purposes, beginning with the\ndistinctive text of 1603(b)(2), which, as Justice Ginsburg\nnoted, does not refer to ownership in the abstract, it\nrefers to a special legal kind of ownership. It says, a\nmajority of shares or other ownership interests and, in\nusing that familiar phraseology of corporate law, it's\nborrowing something which is related to the Meyer opinion,\nI think, that Justice Breyer delivered this morning, the\nnotion that there's a degree of separateness between a\ncorporation and a shareholder. That case, as we heard it,\nturned on the liabilities that the shareholder would not\nbare --\nQUESTION: Well, what -- what is the phrase that\nyou say is familiar from corporate law?\nMR. MASSEY: Well, the concept of a majority of\nshares.\nQUESTION: Are you talking about a phrase, or a\nconcept?\nMR. MASSEY: Well, the phrase in particular,\nYour Honor.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. MASSEY: The -- as -- I'm sorry, the\nconcept.\nQUESTION: So you're not saying that the phrase,\nshares or other ownership interest, is a familiar\nphrase --\nMR. MASSEY: Phrase -- no, Your Honor, I'm\nsaying it's a concept, the concept of what it means to own\na majority of shares in a corporation and, in particular,\n1603(b)(2) is written from the perspective of the\nsubsidiary. It's written from a bottom-up perspective,\nrather than a top-down perspective, and it asks, from the\nsubsidiary's perspective, who owns the majority of its\nshares and it is, in our view, the corporate entity which\nsits directly atop the subsidiary, rather than the foreign\nState, which may stand several tiers removed.\nIt's sort of telling that in the Dead Sea\nCompany's own corporate disclosure statement, they list as\ntheir -- as the owner of Dead Sea -- Israel Chemicals\nLimited, which is the company which sits directly above\nDead Sea Bromine. The corporate disclosure statement then\ngoes on to say that Israel Chemicals Limited is, in turn,\nheld by another company, which is the Israel Corporation,\nand it doesn't claim that the Israel -- it doesn't state\nthat the Israel Corporation is the owner of Dead Sea\nBromine. That's just the natural way we talk about it in\nthe -- in the -- especially in the corporate law realm,\nwhich Congress was adopting in 16(b) -- 1603(b)(2).\nThere are several textual clues in section 1603\nthat Congress was adopting the principle of corporate\nseparateness.\nrequires that a corporation\nbe -- a -- a showing that the agency be a separate legal\nperson.\n1610(b), which governs attachments, limits\nattachments of property to claims against the particular\nagency or instrumentality against whom the claim is\nraised, and this Court, in the First National Citibank\ncase, held that the -- under the FSIA, the -- the property\nand assets of a foreign-owned corporation are distinct\nfrom the property and assets of the foreign State itself,\nso this is not even a case like Bestfoods, where this\nCourt said that Congress' silence was audible in -- in\nthat Congress was legislating against these background\ncorporate law principles. Here, there are quite clear\ntextual signs that Congress was adopting a principle of\ncorporate law.\nNow, the primary argument on the other side,\nthis is a -- the indirect shareholding is a form of other\nownership interest, and I -- we think that is not a proper\nreading of this statute. As Justice Kennedy pointed out,\nthere are other forms of ownership interests in the world.\nThere are shares in an oil venture. The Tennessee Valley\nAuthority, for example, doesn't have stock. The Federal\nGovernment simply owns it. The stock has been retired.\nCongress was dealing here with foreign legal\nsystems which may have different ways of framing equity\ninterests. Socialist countries, for example, you can\nimagine there might not be shares, so in our view the\nphrase, other ownership interests, is meant to take into\naccount those sorts of equity holdings, so in this case --\nQUESTION: Because? Because?\nMR. MASSEY: Well, because Congress was dealing\nwith other foreign owners, other --\nQUESTION: You know, I mean --\nMR. MASSEY: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- nobody doubts that there are other\nways of owning corporations. They're just saying, one\nother way of owning it is like, under the Public Utility\nHolding Company Act, you have a -- a pyramid of shares\nwith intervening corporations. They're not saying that's\nthe only other way. They're saying that's one other way,\nand then you say, no, that one other way is not another\nway, because?\nMR. MASSEY: Because there -- we believe it's --\nthere are two reasons, primarily. First, is -- the first\npart of the phrase, shares, already takes care of stock.\nIt would be unreasonable, in our view, to say indirect\nstock counts as other --\nQUESTION: Because?\nMR. MASSEY: Because stock is not an other kind\nof interest.\nQUESTION: Because?\nMR. MASSEY: Because it's already been listed --\nQUESTION: No -- nobody's saying stock is.\nMR. MASSEY: Sure.\nQUESTION: What they're saying is, stock in\nintervening corporations organized in certain ways --\nMR. MASSEY: Right.\nQUESTION: -- as under the Public Utility\nHolding Company Act, is one other way, and I still haven't\nheard the word -- you see, that's why I keep asking,\nbecause.\nMR. MASSEY: Right.\nQUESTION: Because to me it's an unusual way,\nnot that unusual. The -- the law books are filled with\ncases involving that, under the act I cited, and -- and so\nthey say, that's one way.\nMR. MASSEY: That --\nQUESTION: Now I want to know why that isn't one\nway.\nMR. MASSEY: Because it --\nQUESTION: One other way.\nMR. MASSEY: Right. First, because it's still\nstock. Even if it's indirectly held, it's still stock.\nQUESTION: And I don't quite see that,\nbecause --\nMR. MASSEY: Well --\nQUESTION: Go ahead.\nMR. MASSEY: Okay, and then second is, you're\nabsolutely right, the law books are filled, the U.S. Code\nis filled with many other phrasings of direct, indirect\nreferences to affiliates, references to beneficial\nownership, all the kinds of things, a control test, as\nJustice Stevens mentioned, all the kinds of things that\ncould capture this kind of interest, but instead we have\nthe very distinctive phrasing that says, stock, and in our\nview, once you count stock first as a direct majority\nownership, you shouldn't go back and count it again as an\nindirect form.\nQUESTION: Now --\nMR. MASSEY: The other ought to be reserved --\nQUESTION: -- I know that's your -- your view.\nMR. MASSEY: I know. I know.\nQUESTION: Now -- but let me push the because --\nMR. MASSEY: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- one step further. Suppose I\nthought that the word, other ownership interest, is at\nleast open to this unusual type of arrangement as one form\nof ownership interest.\nMR. MASSEY: Right.\nQUESTION:\ninterpret it that way, because?\nMR. MASSEY: Because the number of principles\nthat animate the statute, first, this is a jurisdictional\nstatute. Jurisdictional statutes should be construed\nprecisely with clear, bright line rules and, in our view,\nthe -- the kind of direct legal ownership of stock is a\nkind of bright line rule and the Court should not depart\nfrom it.\nSecond, the statute already contains, in the\nfirst clause of 1603(b)(3), the -- the so-called Oregon\ntest. The Oregon test captures governmental entities\nwhich perform sovereign functions which are staffed by\nGovernment employees over which the Government has a\nsignificant degree of control. That's not at issue in\nthis case. That was decided both by -- in both courts\nbelow adverse to the petitioners, and it's not before this\nCourt, but that clause would capture all of the\nstereotypical cases at the heart of the Foreign Sovereign\nImmunities Act, so we ought not stretch this part of the\nstatute to cover it.\nQUESTION: All right, now if I think it is not a\nstretch, but just another form of ownership --\nMR. MASSEY: Right.\nQUESTION: -- I'm putting this hypothetically --\nMR. MASSEY: Right.\nQUESTION: -- I then go on to think, you know,\nI cannot think of a reason in the world, not even one, not\neven a shadow of one, as to why Congress would have wanted\nto say, when country X owns business A, it gets into\nFederal court, but when everything is the same, but for a\nstack of papers this thick which puts a bunch of\nintervening paper corporations between A and Z, it doesn't\nwant it to get into Federal court, I think what could\nthey -- what human being could possibly think of any\nconceivable reason for drawing that difference, and at\nthat point -- I'm putting it as strongly as I can --\nI come up with a blank. I can't think of one.\nI used to have relatives who had little tiny\ncorporations, and the number in between was a matter of\ntax law or something. It was the same person sitting at\nthe same desk --\nMR. MASSEY: Right.\nQUESTION: -- doing the same thing.\nMR. MASSEY: Right.\nQUESTION: Now, I put it as strongly as I can.\nMR. MASSEY: Right, and of course Congress is --\nCongress has to legislate by category. It's not simply\ndealing with the example of 100 percent subsidiaries.\nCongress is drawing a general rule and, as a general rule,\nthe -- the line it drew was reasonable because Congress\nwas interested in facilitating suits against foreign\nStates in the United States courts. That's one of the\npurposes that's laid out in 1602 in the statute, and\nreading the statute the petitioners' way would disserve\nthose purposes.\nFirst, it would impose important procedural\nburdens on litigants that Congress did not want to impose.\nIt would eliminate traditional State long arm statutes.\nIt would eliminate the right to jury trial. It would\ncreate immunity questions, because once immunity is\ninvoked --\nQUESTION: Why -- why would it eliminate the\nright to jury trial?\nMR. MASSEY: Well, under the FSIA, once a --\na -- an entity is deemed to be a foreign State, the right\nto jury trial is lost, even if an exception to immunity is\nsubsequently found to apply.\nIt would -- the -- the other burdens it imposes,\nit eliminates the traditional attachment provision\nthat's --\nQUESTION: Of course it does have a few -- but\nnonetheless my question is, what conceivable reason could\nthere be for saying those special advantages disappear\nwhen there is country A, and when there is country A to Z,\nsince the only difference between A and A to Z, I'd\nrepeat, is a bunch of paper?\nMR. MASSEY: Well, again, as I said, Congress is\nnot just legislating with that specific example of\n100 percent subsidiaries, it's using a -- the general\ncategory. It -- it has to operate by general rule.\nI think other examples, though, would show that\nwhen you have multiple tiers, there -- the surprise factor\nsignificantly increases. Congress was concerned that\nlitigants would be surprised to discover that they were\nnot dealing with an ordinary commercial entity but,\nrather, a foreign State, and that surprise factor\nincreases as you go down the corporate tier to the nth\ntier.\nAlso, there are potentially complex factual\ninquiries as you go down the -- a -- a tier. In this\ncase, there are organization charts which show how the\nshareholdings have been computed, but consider, when\nownership is not expressed through shares but through some\npercentage of assets or partnership interests which are\nnot going to be reflected in a shareholder ledger, but are\ngoing to be the potential subject of controversy in a\ncourt, and I think the potential for factual disputes\nincreases.\nQUESTION: Mr. Massey --\nMR. MASSEY: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- we're trying to find out, not\nwas -- what Congress did was reasonable --\nMR. MASSEY: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- but what did Congress do.\nMR. MASSEY: Of course.\nQUESTION: Of course if it -- what it did was\nreasonable, that -- nobody would doubt that that would be\nfine, and in determining what -- what Congress did, the\npetitioners pointed to a number of statutes that use the\nword, directly, when they meant to cut out the\nsubsidiaries.\nMR. MASSEY: Yes.\nQUESTION: They say, shares, or -- or a company\ndirectly owned by, and this statute is silent. It doesn't\nsay, directly owned.\nMR. MASSEY: That -- that's -- that's correct,\nYour Honor. In our view, Congress didn't have to use\ndirectly, because it was using this familiar corporate\nconcept of a majority ownership of shares. That implies\ndirect, because the owner of a majority of shares in -- in\nthis tiering relationship is the corporation immediately\nabove the subsidiary, it's not --\nQUESTION: Is there any context in which we have\nheld that a majority ownership of shares, that -- that\nphrase is satisfied by -- by second-tier ownership?\nMR. MASSEY: Where this Court has held it?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. MASSEY: I'm -- I'm not aware of any -- of\nany case, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Do you plan to address the other\nquestion --\nMR. MASSEY: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- in the case?\nMR. MASSEY: Yes, Your Honor. Let me do that\nright now, because I think the timing question is -- is a\nindependent way of resolving this case.\nEver since 1824, when Chief Justice Marshall\nannounced Mollan against Torrance, the rule has been that\njurisdiction is determined as of the date of filing the\ncomplaint. The Chief Justice asked, what is the rule in\ndiversity cases? Well, since Anderson and Watt in 1891,\ndiversity cases have been held to be -- to be governed by\nthat rule, and the response we hear is that this is a\nFederal question case, but, of course, even Federal\nquestion cases are governed by the familiar rule that the\ndate is given by the -- the filing of the complaint.\nThat's -- United States against Keene Corporation in 1993\nreflected that principle.\nAnd as Justice Ginsburg noted, even if some\nparts of the act are a Federal question, it's also telling\nthat in 1332(a)(4), Congress created a new species of\ndiversity jurisdiction, so accepting the petitioners'\nargument here would lead to the anomalous situation where\nthere's a diversity part of the statute that's going to be\ngoverned by the Mollan against Torrance rule, and there\nwill be a Federal question part of the statute that would\nbe governed by a different rule.\nQUESTION: Mr. Paden said that that (a)(4) would\nbe interpreted by the different rule, so he's being\nconsistent with --\nMR. MASSEY: Okay -- well, I misunderstood.\nI apologize, but then that also means that there are some\ndiversity rules that are being interpreted one way, and\nother diversity rules being interpreted a different way.\nEither way, there's an anomaly, and it appears to us the\nsimplest way to resolve it would simply be to adhere to\nthe longstanding principle that the date on which the\ncomplaint is filed is the relevant time to take a\nsnapshot.\nThat's also more administratively feasible,\nbecause you can imagine that the rule of when the\nunderlying conduct occurred is a -- is a -- might be\ndifficult to determine in some cases. In this --\nQUESTION: Or it might also extend over a\nconsiderable period of time.\nMR. MASSEY: That's correct, Your Honor.\nI agree completely.\nAnd so it's -- it's more reasonable to assume\nCongress was legislating against the background\nunderstanding that the date of filing of the complaint\nwould be determinative. It used the present tense in\n1603. In 1441(d), which is the removal provision at issue\nhere, it talked about a case against a foreign State, and\nin our view, it's more reasonable, it's more naturally\nread to think that a case is a case against a foreign\nState only if the entity actually is a foreign State at\nthe time, as opposed to being Czarist Russia.\n1608, which is the special service provision,\nalso indicates that Congress is contemplating entities\nthat actually were foreign States, because --\nQUESTION: Well, their point, though, is that,\nfirst my examples were slightly absurd, and -- which they\nwere -- and secondly, that in any real case where -- where\nyou have, say, Communist Russia you're suing, or -- or\nmore recent former States, you're -- you're actually suing\nthe State, and the -- the defense is, but that State no\nlonger exists, like Bosnia or something.\nThere are a few things that are more involved in\nforeign relationships, and -- and boy, to suddenly throw\nthat to 50 State courts is a total nightmare if you're\nreally worried about the foreign State, so even though it\ncreates differences between the diversity jurisdiction and\nthe other, we better keep these in Federal court, or we're\nall in trouble. I mean, that's what I took them to say.\nMR. MASSEY: Right. Well, I think the -- the\nanswer to the jurisdiction point and the sort of State\ncourt point is that they're already is a provision in the\ndiversity statute, 1332(a)(3), I believe it is, that deals\nwith citizens of foreign countries, so there's already\ndiversity jurisdiction for suits against foreign\ncorporations after they've been privatized. They would be\nable -- any claim against the Government would be\nprotected by the act of State doctrine, as Justice Scalia\nnoted. There could be no -- of course, no direct\nliability imposed --\nQUESTION: It works all right with the\ncorporations, but what if you're actually suing the State,\nwhich still has some assets somewhere? How does that\nwork?\nMR. MASSEY: Well, that, of course, isn't --\nthat's not going to be before this Court today, but --\nQUESTION: Oh, no, but if we go into the foreign\nState, former foreign States don't count, we've decided\nthat, and so I -- just curious. I don't want to do it\nblindly.\nMR. MASSEY: Well, no, I'm -- we're not asking\nyou to decide anything about -- about former foreign\nStates. I think --\nQUESTION: Is there a reading that -- that\nthrows out the corporation that used to be owned but now\nisn't by a foreign State, but keeps the former foreign\nState within?\nMR. MASSEY: Well, the -- the whole immunity\nthat foreign States enjoy is governed by 1604 and 1605,\nand -- and the provision that we're focusing here is -- is\njust the definition of agency and instrumentality, so I --\nI think this Court could safely leave for another day the\nissue of the former foreign State. It -- it's not at\nthe -- it's not in the provision that we are asking this\nCourt to interpret, and -- and it's governed by different\nprovisions which Your Honors could -- could leave for\nanother day.\nQUESTION: Mr. Massey, practically, is it so in\nthese litigations that if you can't remove to the Federal\ncourt, the State courts keep them and try them, whereas if\nyou remove them to the Federal court, they are then\ndismissed on forum nonconvenience?\nMR. MASSEY: Well, it's -- undoubtedly the forum\nnonconvenience defense would be raised in State court as\nwell.\nsubstance have occurred, so nobody --\nQUESTION: But in this category of case --\nMR. MASSEY: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- is that the general pattern?\nMR. MASSEY: That is the -- yes, that's the\ngeneral pattern. It's -- that's correct and, of course,\nI think there would also be an immunity asserted. The\nDead Sea petitioners have preserved that. It's in joint\nappendix 57, and -- and the -- the issue of whether they\nwould be entitled to immunity, or whether the commercial\nactivity exception would apply or something, hasn't been\nlitigated yet.\nQUESTION: When was the Foreign Sovereign\nImmunities Act passed?\nMR. MASSEY: 1976, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: We presumably lived, then, for 200\nyears without it, these cases being tried in State court?\nMR. MASSEY: That's correct, Your Honor. The --\nthe -- under the -- the prevailing doctrine of the\nseparate entity rule, any separate unit or corporation was\nnot entitled to immunity, that's correct, and it was\ngoverned by, after 1952 the Tate letter, which the --\nwhich the State Department issue didn't -- this Court has\ndescribed the procedural history in Verlinden, but you're\nabsolutely correct, Your Honor.\nI -- I think that in the -- at the end of the\nday, what -- what is at issue here is a statute which\nCongress adapted in 1602, set outting out -- setting out\nthe purposes to facilitate suits against foreign entities,\nand also, as Justice Scalia noted, it referred to\nprinciples of international law in 1602, and here,\nwe're -- the petitioners are asking this Court to\naggravate the difference between U.S. law and the law of\nevery other country.\nThese petitioners do not receive immunity even\nin the courts of Israel or anywhere else, and the concerns\nabout State courts and juries could be addressed through\nother provisions which enact -- which are enacted in the\ndiversity statute which govern every other corporation in\nthe world.\nIf there are no further questions --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Massey.\nMr. Minear, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. MINEAR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nCongress enacted the FSIA against the backdrop\nof venerable corporate law principles, including the\nprinciple that a parent corporation and subsidiary are\ndistinct, and that the shareholders of a parent\ncorporation are not the shareholders of a subsidiary\ncorporation. We submit that the FSIA refers to share\nownership in that familiar legal sense.\nViewed in that light, a foreign State's majority\nownership of the shares of a parent gives the foreign\nState control over the subsidiary, but it does not give\nthat foreign State ownership of the subsidiary's shares.\nIf Congress had intended that the FSIA would extend agency\nor instrumentality status to the foreign State's control\nof the subsidiary, it could easily have said exactly that.\nQUESTION: Well, they don't think of these\nthings all the time, so -- so what -- what about -- they\njust don't. It's -- and that's -- we have -- that's why\nwe have a difficult problem, so I wondered, with the\nlanguage, and nobody accepts -- I just want to know the\nreason for this, and I'm sure it's not a tenable\ninterpretation, because nobody's advanced it, but if you\nlook at the first part, literally speaking, it says a\nforeign State includes an instrumentality of a foreign\nState, and so an instrumentality of a foreign State, is,\namong other things, a corporation, the majority of shares\nof which the foreign state owns. And that's true as to\nthe first corporation in the tier, A. Well, now, since A\nis included in the term, foreign State, it therefore is a\nforeign State. That's what it says. And therefore, B is\na company whose shares, the majority of which are owned by\na foreign State, and so forth down the line.\nNow, literally, that's what it says, and so\nwhat's wrong if I can't think of any reason why they'd\nwant a difference, and the -- that language literally\ncovers it, what's wrong with that?\nMR. MINEAR: There's a very strong textual\nindication that that's not a correct reading, and that is\nfound in section 1603(b)(2), where it speaks of a majority\nof whose shares or other ownership interest is owned by\nthe foreign State, or political subdivision thereof.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. MINEAR: Now, obviously, if Congress had\nintended that recursive use that you've described, they\nwould not have included, political subdivision thereof,\nwhich is also a part of a foreign State and, in fact, that\nprovision excludes agency or instrumentality.\nWe think what the Court can draw from this is\nthat Congress was using foreign State in a very strict\nsense of simply a foreign nation.\nQUESTION: Or -- but you're referring there back\nto the intent of Congress. I see that linguistic point,\nbut if we're referring back to the intent of Congress, I'm\nback to my question I asked before, what possible intent\nof Congress could the interpretation that you advance\nfurther? I mean, what reason is there? The same\nquestions I asked before. I'm just --\nMR. MINEAR: We think --\nQUESTION: -- you've got me back to that because\nof your response, which referred to the intent of\nCongress.\nMR. MINEAR: We think there are two very clear\nreasons. First of all, Congress was drawing a bright\nline. We think that Congress wanted to avoid litigation\nover where to litigate. Nothing's more wasteful than\nthat -- and by doing so it spoke to ownership of majority\nof shares in the traditional legal sense, which provides a\nvery bright line rule.\nWe also think that this -- this reading must\nbe -- must take into account that we're not speaking\nsolely of the interest of foreign nations, but also of the\ninterest of American litigants. Congress was trying to\nstrike a balance between the two, and the balance that we\nsuggest here is one that recognizes that American\nlitigants have an interest in a clear delineation of who\nis entitled to foreign sovereign status and who is not.\nWe think our interpretation reflects both of those\nconcerns.\nQUESTION: But the statute does refer to other\nownership interests.\nMR. MINEAR: Yes, it --\nQUESTION: Other forms of ownership. What does\nthat cover, then?\nMR. MINEAR: Again, Your Honor, we think that it\nought to be -- that this term ought to be interpreted in\nterms of a -- a test that provides a bright line rule. We\nthink other ownership interest refers to something that is\nan alternative to shares, such as, as Justice Kennedy has\ndescribed in ownership in -- in a joint venture.\nWe don't think that Congress intended to\ncomplicate the inquiry by making inquiries into whether\nsomething that is sometimes described as control should be\ntreated as a different type of ownership interest. We\nthink that here, that what Congress was seeking was\nclarity, and the interpretation that we're providing is\ndesigned to provide that clarity for foreign nations and\nfor American litigants as well.\nNow, we think it's important to remember that\nCongress drew this line with the understanding that\nforeign instrumentalities is a narrow term, particularly\nas used by foreign nations. Foreign nations by and large\nwould not provide immunity to corporations. We believe\nthat Congress took the step of extending it to a\nfirst-tier corporation, but concluded that that is where\nthe line should be drawn, it should go no further, and we\nthink a narrow construction of this term is also\nappropriate in -- in the face of the fact that Congress is\ngranting a special privilege, a comity-based privileged,\nthat not ought to be extended beyond what other foreign\nnations recognize in applying their immunity laws to the\nUnited States.\nThis is particularly so when the construction\nthat we urge is very unlikely to lead to foreign friction\nwith other nations. Because, as -- because foreign\nnations do not recognize the immunity that's being sought\nhere in their own courts, it's very unlikely that they\nwill object to our recognition of nonimmunity on the same\nbasis in our courts.\nNow, even if this Court concluded that the FSIA\ngranted agency or instrumentality status to subsidiaries,\nthe Dead Sea companies would still not qualify because, as\nnoted before, they did -- did not have that status at the\ntime that this suit was brought. We think that the\ndiversity statute model provides the appropriate test\nhere.\nDiversity jurisdiction is predicated on whether\nor not the parties are diverse at the time the suit is\nbrought.\nLikewise, jurisdiction that is based on the status of a\nforeign entity ought to be determined at the foreign\nownership's --\nQUESTION: How do you deal with somebody who\nsues Yugoslavia, as a State? I mean, they find some\nassets owned by Yugoslavia, they go sue them.\nMR. MINEAR: I think --\nQUESTION: What -- that goes to a -- West\nVirginia State court?\nMR. MINEAR: I think the question here is, who\nexactly are they suing?\nQUESTION: They're suing Yugoslavia. That's\nthe --\nMR. MINEAR: They might be suing --\nQUESTION: -- the -- it says, defendant,\nYugoslavia.\nMR. MINEAR: But that suit most likely has to be\nserved on someone, and it's likely --\nQUESTION: There is somebody over there who\nclaims to be the recipient of lawsuits -- I mean, we could\neasily construct a serious problem, or you may have looked\ninto it in telling me it just isn't a problem, and I'd\nlike to hear you say that, if that's so, because it would\nhelp.\nMR. MINEAR:\nproblem. I cannot say that we -- we can -- can certify\nthat this problem would never arise, but typically, these\ntypes of suits are brought against another State that now\nstands in the shoes of the former State, and there might\nbe interesting questions of law with regard to the\nliability of that suit, but they may never be reached\nbecause in that case, the suit is being brought --\nQUESTION: Okay, so you're telling me, and\nyou've looked into it, this isn't really a problem, it's\ntheoretical, not real?\nMR. MINEAR: We think it is primarily a\ntheoretical problem.\nWe think that Congress had no compelling reasons\nto provide immunity for past agencies and\ninstrumentalities that are no longer associated with the\nforeign -- foreign State. As Justice Scalia pointed out,\nthere's other mechanisms, such as the Act of State\nDoctrine, that provide protection of the foreign sovereign\ninterests in those cases and, in any event, a foreign\ncorporation, even after it has become privatized, still\nhas access to Federal court jurisdiction under the\nalienage diversity statute, provided that it satisfies\nthe -- the requirements that Congress has set forth.\nFinally, I'd like to note that because two\nquestions are presented here, the Court does have\ndiscretion to reach both of those questions, and we think\nthat there would be an advantage in clarity in the law if\nthe Court did address both the so-called tiering question\nand the timing question, since they both have led to\ndisputes among litigants in the lower courts. They --\nboth issues have been fully briefed and, as I say, the\nCourt does have that power to make that determination if\nit so chooses.\nQUESTION: Mr. Minear, I don't understand how\nthe Act of State Doctrine would apply to sales of Israel\npesticide in Central America.\nMR. MINEAR: It most likely would not apply --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. MINEAR: -- in this situation because\nobviously, the Act of State Doctrine applies to the acts\nof a foreign State in --\nQUESTION: Within its own --\nMR. MINEAR: -- within -- within --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. MINEAR: -- its own territory, within is own\njurisdiction.\nIf there are no further questions, thank you,\nYour Honor.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Minear.\nMr. Paden, you have 7 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PETER R. PADEN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. PADEN: Thank you, Your Honor.\nFirst, with respect to the phrase, ownership\ninterest, Mr. Massey suggested that the issues here, and\nI believe Mr. Minear as well, are related to the issues in\nthe recently decided Meyer case, with which I confess I'm\nnot familiar, but I think also the Bestfoods kind of case.\nWe think those cases are very different. Those\ncases relate to liability-creating statutes and, in the\ncontext of a statute that creates liability, whether\nCongress intended for traditional rules of corporate\nveil-piercing to be eased somewhat in assigning liability\nin the case of the Superfund law to the -- to the owner of\nthe contaminated facility.\nThis is not a statute that gives rise to\nliability. It defines a category of entities that are\nwithin the scope of the -- of the group that Congress\nintended to -- to vest with a certain limited protection\nwhen they will be sued in -- in the United States, namely,\na broad right to a Federal forum, and so forth.\nQUESTION: We -- we have always construed\njurisdictional statutes quite narrowly, going all the way\nback to Strawbridge against Curtis, that said you have to\nhave complete diversity under the diversity statute, and\nit seems to me you're asking for something different than\nthat here.\nMR. PADEN: I think, Your Honor, that the -- in\nthe first place, of course, the statute has to be\nconstrued to the best one can on the words of the statute\nand the congressional intent. I think there is some\ninteresting language. I -- I believe it's the Delta case\nof the Sixth Circuit, or maybe the Texas Eastern case in\nthe Third Circuit -- talking about why, in the context of\nthis law, there actually should be a broad interpretation\nof diversity. Really, that's just another way of saying\nbecause Congress intended to bring within it a certain\ndefined category of -- of entities.\nI think it's very hard to -- to articulate a\nreason why Congress would have wanted to bring commercial\noperations of foreign States within the scope of the\nstatute and say -- let me back up a moment.\nThere was a time when Dead Sea Works was the\nimmediate parent of Dead Sea Bromine, and Dead Sea Works\nwas owned by the State of Israel. Dead Sea Works' job is\nto extract manganese and potassium from the Dead Sea.\nDead Sea Bromine's job is to extract Dead -- bromine from\nthe Dead Sea. It's impossible to come up with a rationale\nwhy Congress wanted Dead Sea Works to be within the\npurpose -- the purview of this statute and Dead Sea\nBromine not to be.\nQUESTION: Well, they listed two. They said,\nfirst of all it's easier for the court not to have to go\nthrough the morass of paper and try to figure out who owns\nwhat where, and the second one is that, because it's less\nsurprising, at least the customers and others will know,\nlikely, who owns the company, and know it's the State.\nThose were their two responses.\nMR. PADEN: Correct. I -- in terms of ownership\ninterest, I think it's -- it's a well-known and widely\nused phrase in our law as well as others to be a generic\nbroadbased term. We did a little research on some\npublicly available information just to try to find\ncompanies that I think we can say are well-known to be --\nhave certain relationships, and I think it's fair to say,\nbased on news articles and so forth, that General Electric\nCompany is widely understood to own NBC, the broadcasting\nnetwork.\nIt turns out that General Electric Company is\nthe 100 percent shareholder of a company called NBC\nHoldings, Inc., which is the 100 percent shareholder of\nNBC, Inc., the broadcasting company. I think the chairman\nof the board of GE would be astonished to hear the United\nStates and the respondents explain that GE does not have\nan ownership interest in NBC. It's --\nQUESTION: I think that was conceded, that for\npurposes of newspapers reports, and -- yeah, we understand\nthat you would have five tiers down, if only one person\nowns it, you say, well, that person owns it, even if it's\nthe fifth tier down, but the question is, in this context\nof a jurisdictional statute -- and I wanted to ask you\nparticularly, you've just heard Mr. Minear's argument, do\nwe, as a Court, owe any special respect to what the\nexecutive tells us a statute that deals in the foreign\naffairs realm means?\nMR. PADEN: Your Honor, I think in this case\nthat -- that we think that the respect that is owed to the\nJustice and State Departments in this case is -- is\nmeasured by the persuasiveness of the opinions that\nthey're offering. Essentially, they're offering a legal\ninterpretation of the meaning of the statute and\ncongressional intent.\nI don't think they've said that the\ninterpretation that we're offering here will impair or\njeopardize the conduct of our foreign relations. In fact,\nthe only comment in their brief about this is to note that\nthere have not been frictions in foreign relations as a\nresult of the extant state of the law, and the extant\nstate of the law is really in our favor on both points.\nThere are a number of cases where privatized\nentities have been held to be agencies or\ninstrumentalities, and certainly where tiered entities\nhave been, so we think it really is a matter of an\nanalysis of the legal opinions about statutory\nconstruction and -- and whether --\nQUESTION: But the -- the Government says you\nare the one who's saying, oh, a foreigner might be\noffended by the jury trial, whatever.\nMR. PADEN: We're trying to honor the intent of\nCongress, Your Honor. Congress --\nQUESTION: And -- and the Government answers no,\nthat we don't think this is going to be disturbing foreign\nnations. You're the one who says that it will.\nMR. PADEN: I think what's salient is what\nCongress said, Your Honor, and Congress said that when\nclaims are brought, when we are going to allow claims\nagainst foreign State entities for their commercial\nactivities or whatever in this country, we're going to\naccord them the kinds of -- the Federal jurisdiction\nbreadth and lack of jury trial which we accord to\nourselves when we agree to be sued.\nQUESTION: May I ask you what the purpose of\nfiling this lodging was, this gigantic paper? Are we\nsupposed to read this to figure out what the corporate\nrelationships were, or what was the purpose?\nMR. PADEN: Your Honor, that contains a lot of\nvery detailed material in support of the information that\nwe thought pertinent describing the particular structure\nof the Government companies law and the legal regimes --\nQUESTION: But is this typical of what a\ndistrict judge would have to look through to figure out\nownership under your theory?\nMR. PADEN: No, sir. It doesn't --\n[Laughter.]\nMR. PADEN: -- not at all. That had nothing\nreally to do with ownership. We -- we actually originally\nput that material in the record in support of our argument\nthat the company was an organ of the State of Israel\nwithin the kind of emerging case law there, and what that\nmaterial shows is the extensive, detailed\ninterrelationship between the Government companies\nauthority in Israel.\nThey made decisions about whether or not the\ncompany was going to have to use company cars, about\nwhether or not they were -- they made -- they made -- they\nhad input in the operation of this company to a minute\ndegree of detail and to, of course, very profound\ndecisions such as budget decisions, who would be on the\nboard of directors.\nThis company, under the Government companies\nlaw, a Government subsidiary company is treated, for all\nintents and purpose the same, whether it's indirectly\nheld, as a Government company which is directly owned, and\nit -- and this detailed material is really in support of\nseveral pages in our brief where we -- where we provide\na -- a long paragraph with a series of examples of the\nextent of the interrelationship between the Government of\nIsrael, the ministers of finance, the Government companies\nauthority, and so forth.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Paden.\nMR. PADEN: Thank you, Your Honor.\n"
