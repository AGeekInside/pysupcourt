        "content": "(11:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument next this morning in Case 09-11556, Tolentino\nv. New York.\nMs. Schwarz.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KRISTINA SCHWARZ\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. SCHWARZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Court held in Delaware v. Prouse that,\nin the absence of reasonable suspicion, it is an\nunreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment for\npolice to stop a car for the purpose of checking the\nmotorist's driving credentials.\nIn Brown v. Texas, the Court similarly ruled\nthat police may not stop a person without reasonable\nsuspicion for the purpose of requiring the individual to\nidentify him or herself. These cases are grounded in\nthe principle that in this country we enjoy the right to\ngo about our business free from government interference\nunless or until the police have just cause to detain us.\nPetitioner's motion to suppress alleged that\nthe police acted exactly as they did in Prouse and\nBrown. They stopped the car without justification,\nelicited his name, and gained access to his DMV records,\nwhich otherwise would not have been discovered. Instead\nof suppressing the poisonous fruit of the illegal car\nstop, the DMV records, the New York Court of Appeals\nchose to create a new categorical rule that prevents\napplication of the exclusionary rule whenever the police\nact in violation of Prouse.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was -- was -- was the\npoisonous fruit the DMV records, or was the poisonous\nfruit the fact that this person who is contained in the\nrecords was the one driving the car? Why wasn't that\nthe -- why wasn't that the fruit? I mean, the records\nwere there anyway. What -- what -- what new information\ncame from the stop was the fact that that is the person\nwho was driving the car. Why -- why didn't -- why\nwasn't that what should have been suppressed?\nMS. SCHWARZ: Well, Justice Scalia, that is\nalso a fruit of the poisonous tree. As -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I would agree with you on\nthat fruit. Did -- did you ask for that to be\nsuppressed?\nMS. SCHWARZ: Yes, that was asked for in the\n-- in the motion at the trial level. In addition -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that's not what's\nbefore us here, right?\nMS. SCHWARZ: That's right, and that's\nbecause the court below decided that -- in deciding the\ncase only addressed the DMV record, and -- and indicated\nthat the DMV records were not properly suppressible\nfruit.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Suppose that the -\nMS. SCHWARZ: And that's the issue.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Suppose that -- that you had\nwon at the trial level; the judge suppresses everything\nand dismisses the indictment; and Mr. Tolentino walks\nout of the courtroom and is observed by the officer that\nconducted the stop in this case. The officer sees him\ngetting into a car and driving away, even though his\nlicense is still suspended. Now, could -- could he be\narrested for that?\nMS. SCHWARZ: Yes, Justice Alito, he could.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Even though the officer\nwould have no reason to know that this particular person\nhas a suspended license were it not for the chain of\nevents that followed from the initial allegedly illegal\nstop?\nMS. SCHWARZ: Well, although that initial\nstop provided the tainted information that he didn't\nhave a license, the subsequent re- offense would\ncertainly taint the -- the illegality of the first stop\nand make the second offense properly -\nJUSTICE ALITO: All right. Let me ask a\nrelated question. Suppose that after you filed your\nsuppression motion the -- the State of New York became\nnervous about this issue and they checked all the\nsurveillance cameras in the vicinity of the stop, and,\nlo and behold, they found a tape showing Mr. Tolentino\ndriving the car shortly before the stop here. Could he\nbe prosecuted for illegal -- for driving without a\nlicense, with a suspended license, using that evidence?\nMS. SCHWARZ: Well, that -- I believe that\nunder those circumstances it would be entirely proper to\nprosecute the case. With that, that would be evidence\nthat came from an independent source.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I mean, in light of\nthose two answers, it does seem to me that your real\nproblem here is not with the -- the DMV records. It's\nwith the police officer's observation after the stop\nthat Mr. Tolentino was driving the car.\nMS. SCHWARZ: Well, Justice Alito, again,\nall of -- there's lots of evidence that could be\nproperly the fruit of the poisonous tree. There was a\nstatement made here that the Petitioner said that he did\nnot have a New York State license, there's the\nobservations of the officer, and there's the DMV\nrecords. They're all properly considered fruit, and in\nthis case the DMV records are of important evidentiary\nsignificance.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there -- is there any\ncase in this Court where what was suppressed was\ninformation that was lawfully in the government's\npossession, as opposed to evidence that was acquired\noriginally through the search? Here we have the DMV\nrecords, they're public records. I don't know of any\ndecision of this Court that deals with suppression of\nevidence that is already in the government's possession,\nand if I'm wrong about that, you tell me.\nMS. SCHWARZ: Yes. Yes, Justice Ginsburg, I\ndon't believe there has been precedent on that issue.\nHowever, in the independent source doctrine cases, there\n-- they've always required that the possession -- or\nthat they have knowledge of the information in order for\nit to defeat the exclusionary rule application. So in\nthis case, although the government had the DMV records\n-- well, first of all, law enforcement didn't have the\nDMV records. It was only until the illegality and the\nexploitation of that illegality that they acquired the\nrecords from the Department of Motor Vehicles. So in\nthat sense it was clearly a fruit of the poisonous tree.\nBut even if you look at government as an\nintegrated whole, the prior possession of the -- the\nrecords was meaningless, of no value to them, until the\nillegality when it acquired its meaning.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose the police\nfollowing Mr. Tolentino had noted down his license\nplate, and then got this information, not as a result of\nhis driver's license, but from the plate on the car?\nMS. SCHWARZ: Well, Justice Ginsburg, the -\nthe -- the plates of the car would not indicate the -\nthe driver's license of the driver, and in this case Mr.\nTolentino -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They might show him as\nthe owner of the car.\nMS. SCHWARZ: The owner of the car. And I\nbelieve in Respondent's brief they indicated that -\nthat some of the police computers will even show\ndescriptive features or maybe even a picture of the\ndriver. But in this case Mr. Tolentino was not the\nregistered owner of the vehicle, so that wouldn't have\nprovided them with cause to pull the car over.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: This -- this goes back to\na question Justice Alito asked in a probably more artful\nway, but I'm not quite sure what's supposed to happen\nunder your view after this stop. They stop the person,\nthey get the information that he's driving under a\nsuspended license, and are they supposed to say, Oh, you\nknow, we shouldn't have stopped you; I'm sorry, have a\nnice day, go ahead, and then he leaves? Is that what\ngoes on?\nMS. SCHWARZ: No, Justice Kennedy, that's\nnot what would happen. The State would impound the car.\nThey would not allow a -- a person without a proper\nlicense to get back in the car and -- and drive on.\nThat -- in order for the Petitioner to get the vehicle\nback, he would -- if it was his vehicle -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, why isn't impounding\nthe car the fruit of the illegal search?\nMS. SCHWARZ: Because the -- the impoundment\nstatutes are based on a public safety interest, and so\nit doesn't -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But why doesn't the public\nsafety interest then permit us to use this evidence in\norder to protect the public safety further by punishing\nhim for -- not driving? I don't see the difference.\nMS. SCHWARZ: Because in order to do that,\nit would be tantamount to sanctioning a -- a fishing\nexpedition in this case, Justice Kennedy, because it\nwould be allowing the police without reasonable\nsuspicion -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, why wouldn't you say\nthe same thing about impounding the car?\nMS. SCHWARZ: Because the -- the -- the\ninterests are different and because it's not a forever\nremoval of the Petitioner's right to get the car,\nwhoever the -- the rightful owner is. It's just making\nsure that the Petitioner can't get back in the car and\ncontinue driving. In order to get the vehicle back, at\nleast in New York State, the -- if it was the\nPetitioner's, they would have to show proof that they\nhad a valid license; and if it wasn't his vehicle, then\nthe other -- the true owner would have to get -- provide\nproper credentials to establish that they could take the\n-- the vehicle into their possession; and also they\nwould have to have proof that the Petitioner himself had\ncleared up his record or get some sort of a -- a release\nfrom the court or from the district attorney's office.\nSo the whole purpose of that impoundment statute is for\npublic safety.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't understand the\nanswer you gave to Justice Alito. Maybe I mixed it up.\nThe police stop the car without cause.\nMS. SCHWARZ: Uh-huh.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So illegal stop. And you\nsay as a result of the stop they found out all these\nthings in the records, that he had no license, right?\nMS. SCHWARZ: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So that shouldn't be\nintroduced into his trial for driving without a license.\nMS. SCHWARZ: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now the\nquestion I had heard put was, suppose after they got\nthis information, they don't arrest him then, but he\ngets into the car again and starts driving. You said\nthen they could arrest him?\nMS. SCHWARZ: Well -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that right? Why? Why\nisn't -- why isn't that just as much the fruit of the\npoisonous tree? They found out he doesn't have a\nlicense by the record which came to them from an illegal\nstop. I just don't understand it. Did I get you right\nas to what you said?\nMS. SCHWARZ: Justice Breyer, what I -- what\nI meant to say is the attenuation doctrine would apply.\nNow, if the person was -- got back in his car\nimmediately at that scene and started off driving, then\nI'm not sure that the attenuation doctrine would -\nwould -- would kick in.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So therefore they couldn't\narrest him. So what they do is they -- is that right?\nMS. SCHWARZ: Well, yes, but -\nJUSTICE BREYER: They see -- they see he -\nthey stopped him, they get the records, wrongly. They\nsee he has no license. He says: How did you know?\nBecause we just looked at your license. That was\nillegal; good-bye, gets into the car and drives off, and\nthey can do nothing?\nMS. SCHWARZ: Except I just have to remind\nyou that they -- they could -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that right or not? Is\nthat right?\nMS. SCHWARZ: -- impound the car.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I -- how could they --\nthey can impound the car.\nMS. SCHWARZ: Impound the car.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because?\nMS. SCHWARZ: So -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because?\nMS. SCHWARZ: Because of the statutory\nrights, the Court -- because they now know that he has\nno license to drive, so either the car will -- if\nthere's another person who can properly take possession\nof the vehicle, then that person can drive off with the\ncar. But the Petitioner himself, who doesn't have a\nvalid license, he can't get back in the car.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Schwarz, suppose -\nMS. SCHWARZ: And -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I'm sorry.\nMS. SCHWARZ: Well, I'm done.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Schwarz, suppose the\npolice arrest the guy, find out who he is, don't -- stop\nthe guy, find out who he is, don't arrest him, but then\nnow they know that this is the kind of guy who drives\nwithout a license. And so they go to his house the next\nday and they see him getting back in the car. Could\nthey arrest him then?\nMS. SCHWARZ: Justice Kagan, I think the\nanswer would be yes, and the reason why is because if\nthey see him on a subsequent occasion and they're seeing\nhim re-offend, that would attenuate the taint of the\nfirst -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So the re-offense -- the\nre-offense just cuts off the original taint?\nMS. SCHWARZ: I believe so, yes. I mean, it\nwould be attenuation analysis, but to me it would be\npretty clear-cut that that's how it would resolve.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the only way that\nthe police can prevent an unlicensed driver from driving\nin this situation is to take away his car? Impound the\ncar, as you say?\nMS. SCHWARZ: Well -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Unless they want -\nfor any offense, you know, expired driver's license.\nExpired last week. They can't just give the guy -- they\ncan't give the guy a ticket, right? All they can do is\ntake away his car?\nYour answer to a number of the questions has\nbeen that -- that have tried to address the issue of\nwhat are they supposed to do, since they know they have\nsomebody who is violating the law, is that, well, they\ncan take away the car. And I just want to know if\nthat's the only permissible response by the police when\nthey know that the person driving has violated the law.\nMS. SCHWARZ: If the -- if the stop was -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Totally illegal.\nMS. SCHWARZ: -- Totally illegal -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Totally, yes.\nMS. SCHWARZ: Then I don't think that -- if\nthere were -- I don't think that they could prosecute\nthat case. They could -- they couldn't charge him with\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the only way to\nprevent him from reoffending immediately is to impound\nthe car? Because if he gets into the car and drives,\nthen -- or can the police arrest him right away?\nMS. SCHWARZ: Well, again, that would be\nattenuation analysis. But I think that the taint of the\ninitial illegality would make that a much more difficult\ncase. But in that situation, the police also could -\nagain, if there was another person who had authority to\ntake possession of the vehicle, that person could take\nthe vehicle, the registered owner or someone with\nauthority to do that. But the police would not be\npowerless to see the defendant get back in the -- in the\ncar.\nI mean, it would -- that would be -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why not? Why\nwouldn't they -\nMS. SCHWARZ: Because of the impoundment\nstatutes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that your answer,\nthen: They've got to impound the car every time or let\nthe guy just go?\nMS. SCHWARZ: Well, they -- they could drive\nthe person home to his house or take him to the corner\nor tell him not to drive until he cleared up his\nlicense. They could do that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They could tell him\nnot to drive until he clears up his license?\nMS. SCHWARZ: I -- yes. I mean, that would\nbe another alternative.\nBut the scenario that you are talking about\nwould be highly unlikely, and it would be almost in bad\nfaith if the police stopped him illegally, found out\nthat he had the suspended license, and then let him get\nback in right away. That wouldn't be the way that the\npolice would normally do that, unless there was a way to\nproperly maintain the safety of the road -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How much time do they\nhave to wait? Justice Kagan brought up if the police go\nto his home the next day. You've brought up attenuation\ntheory a number of times.\nMS. SCHWARZ: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- I think now you\nhave answered, he gets back into the car, drives it\naway, they can do nothing because it's too close to when\nthey discovered his record of -- his suspended license.\nHow much of an interval must there be? What\ndo you mean by attenuation doctrine?\nMS. SCHWARZ: Well, that would be -\nattenuation would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis,\nJustice Ginsburg, but I would think if, even an hour\nlater, if the Petitioner brazenly drove by those same\nofficers, you know, thumbing his nose at them, hi, that\nwould be -- attenuation analysis would apply at that\npoint.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Because you could say that\nif he got back in the car right after the stop, if the\npolice for some reason did not impound the car and he\ngot back in the car, that's another offense, and so by\nyour theory, then they could properly arrest him and use\nall of this knowledge in a prosecution?\nMS. SCHWARZ: And a court very well -- very\nwell may agree with you on that. My only qualm with\nthat is that when the officers illegally find out that\nhe has a suspended license and then to let him get back\nin and immediately arrest him, it's sort of in bad\nfaith.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what -- what is that\nword, the \"bad faith\"? I take it your rule is identical\nif when they wrongly stop the car, they look up the\nrecords, the records say he has no license, and in\naddition, he's wanted on 17 drug warrants and for 3\ntriple axe murders. Again, you can't do anything about\nit?\nMS. SCHWARZ: No. No, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What? Can you? You cannot\ndo anything about it or you can?\nMS. SCHWARZ: You can.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What? How?\nMS. SCHWARZ: Well, the -- the warrants are\nentirely different -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why?\nMS. SCHWARZ: -- because of the Ker-Frisbie\ndoctrine. The warrants for -- for other cases are a\nmethod by which the court brings the body of the\ndefendant to court. And so there is -\nJUSTICE BREYER: So if, in fact, a policeman\nstops a person without cause and learns as a result of\nthat that there are many warrants outstanding against\nhim, he then can arrest the person, and -- but can he\nintroduce those warrants into court as evidence or\nwhatever if it's relevant?\nMS. SCHWARZ: Absolutely, he can bring them\nin. But the warrants are not evidentiary.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose the way that the\npoliceman stops the person and gets the information\nillegally is he takes an axe and breaks into the house,\nthe policeman, and thereby -- what I'm showing -- I just\nthink this case has lots of implications, and I'm\nlooking for a rule here that's going to work in a lot of\ndifferent situations.\nMS. SCHWARZ: Well, there's -- actually, I'm\nsorry, Justice Breyer, I'm not sure I follow.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, you say that if, in\nfact, he learns that this man from the public records is\na triple axe murderer -\nMS. SCHWARZ: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- he can do nothing about\nit, I said? And you said no, he can do something about\nit. I just wanted to know the distinction.\nMS. SCHWARZ: Okay. So there's different -\nagain, just to be clear, the warrant, the arrest\nwarrant, is not of evidentiary value, according to\nthe -- Davis. That's not something that would be\nintroduced in court. It's just a method for bringing\nthe defendant into court. And so in that case, they\nwould properly be allowed to arrest him. And if there\nwas -\nJUSTICE BREYER: It happens to be a\ndescription of the individual, not a warrant, he gets\nfrom the public record which is read off to him when he\ncalls in, a description: A red tie. Can he use that\nand introduce it into evidence?\nI mean, is this case about -- what's it\nabout, driving? Or does it have broader implications?\nI thought that the Court had held that any\npublic record at all is immune. Is that right? Immune\nfrom the normal fruit of the poisonous tree rule.\nMS. SCHWARZ: The New York Court of Appeals\nrule categorically removes it, that's true.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, and I was testing\nthat. I want to know: Is that, in your opinion, a\ncorrect rule in all cases?\nMS. SCHWARZ: No. And in fact, one of\nthe -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, not an incorrect\nrule, the opposite rule. No rule.\nMS. SCHWARZ: Well, it's -- the problem with\nthat rule, the categorical rule, is that it will create\na fresh incentive for police officers to make these kind\nof suspicionless stops, and so it will encourage police\nto violate the Fourth Amendment, and not only -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not -- not if you allow the\nsuppression of the policeman's identification of the\nindividual driving the car. I mean, that -- nobody's\ncontending that that can't be suppressed. So if you\ncan't bring in the policeman to say, yes, this fellow\nSmith, whose record we have here, was the fellow driving\nthe car. Once that's out, what incentive is there to\nmake these suspicionless stops?\nMS. SCHWARZ: Because -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What I'm saying is, you're\ngetting at it from the wrong end. What should have been\nsuppressed was the policeman's identification of the\nperson who was driving the car.\nMS. SCHWARZ: Ah. Yes. And if -- and if\nthis case -- if this case -- we prevail, and this case\nwas returned to trial court, both of those issues would\nbe at play and would be litigated. The observations of\nthe defendant and the DMV records are both suppressible\nfruit and both of them would be subject to suppression.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But that's not the argument\nyou seem to be making. You want to suppress the\nknowledge that the police derived from the stop that\nMr. Tolentino's license is suspended, and you would\nallow an exception to that only if there was\nattenuation. But why isn't the simpler solution to a\ncase like this that you can't suppress the knowledge of\nmatters that are in a government record, however you can\nsuppress observations by the police on the scene that\nflow directly from the illegal stop?\nMS. SCHWARZ: Well, again, our position is\nthat both of those items are properly suppressible. And\nit's true in this circumstance that the observations\nwould probably subsume the need for the DMV records.\nHowever, the observations may not be sufficient in\ncertain circumstances. And in those cases, it would be\nmore important -- it would be very important to have\nboth of the items suppressible, and there's no reason,\nthere's not -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought there was some\nrule about not being able to suppress a person's\nidentity? You've been asked a couple of times why are\nyou going after the DMV record; you should go after the\npolice identification of Joe Smith or whoever. I\nthought there was some rule that says the identity of\nthe person is not suppressible. Am I wrong about that?\nMS. SCHWARZ: That -- that is a restatement\nof the Ker-Frisbie doctrine, that essentially says that\na person cannot suppress himself, his body, in order to\ndefeat the jurisdiction of the court.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And so how does that fit\nwith your earlier answers that his identity here could\nbe suppressed? And then I'll ask a second question. If\nyou say that you can suppress his identity from\ninformation they gained after the stop when they saw\nhim, why couldn't they say, well, we saw this man before\nwe stopped him?\nMS. SCHWARZ: There's -- there's a\ndistinction between the identity and the elicitation of\nhis name, and the elicitation of his name which led to\nthe DMV records.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it -- it gets you\nnowhere to say John Smith. You have to say John Smith\nwas driving the car. It's the driving of the car that\nyou want suppressed. That's not the identity. I mean,\nJohn Smith, fine, you can say John Smith, John Smith,\nJohn Smith all you like at court. It's -- it's not\ngoing to get a conviction.\nBut when you say John Smith was driving the\ncar, then you are eliciting testimony from the officer\nconcerning information he would not have had but for the\nstop, that John Smith was driving the car, right?\nMS. SCHWARZ: Well, this Court has always\ndefined evidentiary fruit as something that -- of\nevidentiary value which the public authorities have\ncaused an arrested person to yield to them during an\nillegal detention, and that's from the Davis case. And\nthe DMV records would fit that definition of evidentiary\nfruit.\nAnd in this case, because it is the classic\nsituation where there's sufficient causal connection\nbetween the Fourth Amendment violation and the\nsubsequent discovery of the evidence to justify\nsuppression, there's no reason not to apply the\nexclusionary rule here, and in fact, it meets all the\ndefinition of the sort of case where there would be very\nhigh level of deterrence as a result of applying the\nexclusionary rule.\nI see that I have 5 minutes. I would like\nto reserve the rest of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMs. Schwarz.\nMs. Halligan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CAITLIN J. HALLIGAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. HALLIGAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI would like to start with your question,\nJustice Breyer, about what the ruling below was and\nwhat's at stake in this case. What the court of appeals\nheld was quite narrow. It said -- and I'm reading from\npage 105a of the appendix: \"We merely hold that a\ndefendant may not invoke the fruit of the poisonous tree\ndoctrine when the only link between improper police\nactivity and the disputed evidence is that the police\nlearned the defendant's name.\"\nSo the court of appeals is focusing on the\nfact that all that was elicited here is the name of the\ndefendant, and that's appropriate. Asking a name is\nfundamental to any encounter between police and\ncitizens, and that's because the officer -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're suggesting that\nit's okay for the police to walk up to any citizen,\nanywhere, and say, you're under arrest until you give me\nyour name?\nMS. HALLIGAN: Absolutely not, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, there's -- there's\nbeen no doubt here that it was a stop without suspicion.\nThat's been presumed. So how is that different from\nwhat I just asked you -\nMS. HALLIGAN: Because -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That they took a person\nrandomly, detained them without any suspicion, and said\ngive me your name. Are you suggesting that that's okay?\nMS. HALLIGAN: No, I'm not. The legality of\nthe stop here has not been adjudicated. We are\npresuming that the police acted illegally.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I am presuming. I know\nthat there's counter-arguments to that.\nMS. HALLIGAN: We are not at all challenging\nthis Court's decisions, certainly not Delaware v. Prouse\nor any others, which hold that the police may not stop\nsomeone without basis and may not certainly enforce the\nsort of statute that was at issue in Hiibel without some\nbasis for asking for identification.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So isn't the eliciting\nof the name as a result of an unlawful stop something\nthat could be suppressed?\nMS. HALLIGAN: It should not be subject to\nsuppression, and that's a distinct question from whether\nor not there was a constitutional violation that\noccurred in the stop and the asking of the name.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The name is different\nthan the person, the body of the person, which has to do\nwith the Court's jurisdiction. But why isn't the name\nany different than a wallet that's in somebody's pocket\nor a shirt or a hat, whatever is on the person? Why is\na name not subject to suppression?\nLet's go past what happens here, because I\nunderstand the disconnect between the name, the DMV\nrecord, and seeing the person driving. How we tie those\ntogether are a different issue. But you made a bold\nstatement when you started. You said that the police\nsecuring a name is never suppressible.\nMS. HALLIGAN: Because it has ae unique\nstatus, as this Court recognized in Hiibel, in the\ncriminal justice system. Asking for a name is a routine\nand accepted part of any stop because the officer needs\nto know who he's dealing with. He faces an inordinate\nrisk, as this Court noted in Mimms and most recently in\nArizona v. Gant, of being shot when he approaches a car.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What's the difference\nbetween stopping a car and stopping a person on the\nstreet, as Justice Sotomayor asked? You can't stop\nsomebody on the street for no reason. The person looks\nto you suspicious, so you stop the person and say: Tell\nme your name. For a Terry stop, you have to have\nreasonable suspicion. So why isn't it the same for\nsomebody who is driving a car?\nMS. HALLIGAN: I think it is the same in\nterms of what the Fourth Amendment requires, and\nDelaware v. Prouse holds that. We're not taking issue\nwith that or asking this Court to retreat from that.\nWhat we are saying is that where all that is\nelicited is the name, it's not appropriate to apply the\nexclusionary rule, which is a very distinct question.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So, Ms. Halligan, suppose -\nyou're suggesting there should be an exception for\nknowledge of identity. Suppose there were a clearly\nillegal search and the government is looking for a head\nof some kind of criminal syndicate and knows this only\nby an alias, all right; and -- and finds out as a result\nof this illegal search -- pick your -- pick your alias,\nyou know, John Smith -- finds out, you know -- finds out\nthat this person whose house they're searching is John\nSmith, is the head of this criminal syndicate.\nCan the government then use that knowledge\nof identity, knowledge that this person goes under this\nalias, in order to build a case around this guy?\nMS. HALLIGAN: In your hypothetical I'm not\nsure whether there would be any Fifth Amendment issues\nthat would be at play, but -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: No, they find out this\nperson's alias as the result of the illegal search, and\nthat allows them to build a substantial criminal case.\nMS. HALLIGAN: If all that is obtained is\nthe name, then the exclusionary rule should not be\napplied.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So there's a diary, and it\nsays: I am John Smith. That's Keyser Soze.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I am Keyser Soze. That\nwould not be suppressible?\nMS. HALLIGAN: The diary itself, the\ndocument would be suppressible. The knowledge that that\nperson is the -- is Keyser Soze would not be subject to\nsuppression, and knowledge should never be something\nthat is subject to suppression, in any event.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Suppose that when -- when\nthe police stopped this particular car, they saw that\nMr. Tolentino was smoking marijuana or snorting cocaine\nor drinking from a bottle of alcohol or he had somebody\ntied up, bound and gagged on the back seat of the car.\nNow, all of those things would clearly be the fruit -\nall those observations would clearly be the fruit of the\nallegedly illegal stop, right?\nMS. HALLIGAN: That's correct, and -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Even though they were in\nplain view, they would all be suppressed, right?\nMS. HALLIGAN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But you're saying that the\nobservation that Mr. Tolentino is at the wheel of the\ncar, that is not suppressed?\nMS. HALLIGAN: I would like to distinguish\nbetween the observation of the person driving the car,\nto the extent that you might have a case in which that\nobservation is made after the stop as opposed to before\nthe stop; that's a different and distinct question.\nIt's not presented in the case that's before the Court\nright now -- from the question of whether the\nexclusionary rule should be applied when only the name\nis elicited.\nThe observations, it may be as -- as Justice\nGinsburg suggested that under Crews, because the\nphysiognomy of a person -- five justices determined\nthere the appearance is not something that's subject to\nsuppression, the police officer's observation that it\nwas in fact this individual who looks like this driving\nthe car would not be subject to suppression, either.\nBut that's not presented. All that is at issue here is\nwhether or not the elicitation of the name and the\nrecords directly linked to that are subject to\nsuppression.\nJUSTICE BREYER: He made a mistake and said:\nI'm driving the car.\nMS. HALLIGAN: Pardon?\nJUSTICE BREYER: He made a mistake. He said\nin court: I was driving the core -- car. He never\nshould have said it. All right, now once he said it,\nnow we know he's driving the car.\nMS. HALLIGAN: Well -\nJUSTICE BREYER: So now you're saying why\ndoes this case even come up? Because once you have his\nname, the second he said it in court you could go up\nlooking his -- you could go look at his -- his records\nanyway; you could find all these -- the facts about him\nwhich I guess could you bring in.\nMS. HALLIGAN: Well, that's right, and\nthat's why part of why a name should not be -\nJUSTICE BREYER: So this case shouldn't be a\nspecial rule, it should just be a case of -- what is it\ncalled? It's a doctrine, you would have found it\nanyway; inevitable discovery.\nMS. HALLIGAN: You could resolve the case on\nthe theory that by definition government records that\nare previously held -\nJUSTICE BREYER: But they're only inevitably\ndiscovered if he makes a mistake of saying what his name\nis. No, no, not that -- the mistake of saying: I was\ndriving the car. And then, as Justice Scalia pointed\nout, maybe you could suppress that, so it would -- it\nwould -\nMS. HALLIGAN: In this case the question of\nany observations of the defendant is waived. It was\nabandoned by operation of State law. You could have\nanother case in which that at issue.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Wait. One -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I was going to ask that.\nShe said that -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why is -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- your -- your friend said\nthat it was raised below. What -- what happened to it?\nMS. HALLIGAN: What happened is this: In\nthe suppression motion initially, the defendant sought\nto suppress a number of things, including the\nobservations of the police. The trial court judge did\nnot rule specifically on that aspect of the suppression\nmotion. The trial court judge said that there would be\na suppression hearing on the statement that the\ndefendant made, but there would not be a suppression\nhearing with regard to the DMV records because DMV\nrecords were not subject to suppression.\nAt that point the defendant pled guilty, and\nso by operation of State law -- because first of all\nthere was not a ruling specifically on the question of\nobservations and the defendant failed to bring that to\nthe trial court judge's attention, and because the\nguilty plea was taken, and you can only appeal when you\nplead guilty on a suppression motion where there's a\nfinal order, there's no final order on the observation.\nThat's out of the case, that would be our position.\nYou could have a subsequent case where that\nquestion would be presented if, in fact, an officer does\nnot see a defendant until after he approaches the car,\nand in that case he would have to determine whether or\nnot Crews and the five justices, which says the\nphysiognomy of the defendant is not subject to\nsuppression, controls and therefore allows the\nobservations to come in; but it's not presented here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you -- is your\nposition that they can do anything in terms of the\nsearch of a name? Could they punch it into Google or\nsomething like that and find out a lot more than just\nwhat they have in their own possession?\nMS. HALLIGAN: I think that would be\ncorrect, Your Honor, but here you have records that not\nonly are in the government's possession -- and this\nCourt never has suggested -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know -- I know it\nraises a different question, but you know, you keep\nsaying they're just -- or you know, you're just talking\nabout the name, but names are meaningless in the\nabstract. It's not just that the officer wants to know\nwhat to call him. It's what he wants to find out from\nthe name.\nMS. HALLIGAN: The -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And these days\nthere's so many electronic databases, you can find out\nan awful lot just, you know, with the punch of a few -\na few buttons.\nMS. HALLIGAN: You could, and I think that\nthat's why if the Court was concerned about the\npotential breadth of that holding, it could narrow it to\nthe use of the name to link to government records. In\nthe field, in particular, what an officer is going to\nlook for is records that suggest danger, so for example\nwhat the officers have in New York State is they -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but it's not\nlimited to suggesting danger or whatever. It's -- it\ncan -- that may be what the officer on the scene is most\ninterested in, of course, but once you get the guy's\nname you're interested in a lot of things.\nMS. HALLIGAN: That's right, and that's\nbecause you are in the process of conducting some sort\nof investigation, and to suppress the knowledge of\nsomeone's identity would -- would blink reality.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they're not\nsuppressing the knowledge of somebody's identity. All\nthat -- what's being suppressed is the evidence of\ncriminal activity that you derive from that.\nMS. HALLIGAN: I think it's very different\nthan when you have drugs in a car which could clearly be\nsubject to suppression. All that you have here, first\nof all, that's elicited, is the name. The name itself\nis not subject to suppression, nor did the defendant\nseek to have it suppressed, as the court of appeals\nobserved. And so that should be the end of the inquiry.\nIf the antecedent piece of evidence is not subject to\nsuppression then there's no poison that can flow from\nthat to contaminate anything like the DMV record.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could I go back and -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I think that that's not\nright, Ms. Halligan, because the search is the poisonous\ntree. Now, it might be that the name can't be\nsuppressed, but it still might be that everything that's\ndiscovered as a result of knowing the name, which would\nnever be discovered unless the search had taken place,\ncould be suppressible.\nMS. HALLIGAN: Two points, Justice Kagan. I\nbelieve, first of all, that if the name is not\nsuppressed and then something flows from the name, I\ndon't think that you can skip that step and then\nsuppress something that comes further down the road.\nBut, secondly, the fact that these records were already\nin the government's possession is precisely what takes\nthis outside the scope of the fruits doctrine. The\nfruits -- fruits doctrine has been held to apply\nrepeatedly in cases where the evidence is in some sense\nthe product of the illegal government activity. These\nrecords are simply not the product of any government\nactivity.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Why does it -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could I go back and ask you\nto -- to explain what -- how you -- you think the -- the\nrequest for suppression of the police officer's\nobservation was waived? That was raised in the motion\nto suppress, page 17A of the joint appendix.\nMS. HALLIGAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Now, the -- the New York\nSupreme Court apparently didn't understand that that\nissue was in the case and ruled only on suppression of\nthe records and tangible evidence, is that right, 78A?\nMS. HALLIGAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What is the -- what is Mr.\nTolentino supposed to do at that point to preserve the\nissue of the suppression of a police officer's\nobservation?\nMS. HALLIGAN: To preserve the issue, Mr.\nTolentino should have raised that fact to the judge,\nshould have pointed it out pursuant to CPLR 71070,\nsubsection (2). There's also case law explaining that\nwhen that happens, that is the obligation of the\ndefendant and the defendant cannot raise the issue on\nappeal if it's not brought to the attention of the trial\ncourt judge at that point.\nJUSTICE ALITO: The defendant raises an\nissue before the trial judge, the trial judge ignores\nthat issue, misses the issue -\nMS. HALLIGAN: And then the defendant pleads\nguilty.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- and then the defendant\nwaives the issue unless the defendant says by the way,\nyou missed -- you failed to address one of the arguments\nthat I made?\nMS. HALLIGAN: At the point at which the\ndefendant pleads guilty, that is correct, Your Honor.\nThe defendant pled guilty prior to seeking any ruling on\nthat, specifically, or any clarification. None of this\nis -- is briefed before the Court, but the defendant\nalso did not raise the issue of the observations in the\nbrief to the intermediate State appellate court, the\nState court of appeals or this Court. So it has been\ndeemed abandoned a long time ago. And in the oral\nargument before the New York Court of Appeals, the\ndefendant seemed to concur in the fact that it had been\nabandoned.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You -- you make the\npoint that these records are already in the government's\npossession.\nMS. HALLIGAN: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, isn't that\ntrue of everything that's available on any type of\ndatabase? Everything in Google or whatever the other\nsearch engines are is in the government's possession in\nthe sense that they've got it; all they've got to do is\nidentify it in their search, and they've got it.\nMS. HALLIGAN: Well, this is in the\ngovernment's possession in the literal sense of the\nword, and in fact to correct something that was said\npreviously, although it's not in the record, the DMV\nrecords, along with other records, such as arrest\nwarrants, are in fact in the NYPD's possession. They\nuse a database that the State police generate which they\ndownload onto their server. So they have it in their\nactual possession, which is different from -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it can't make\na difference on whose server it is, does it?\nMS. HALLIGAN: No, I'm simply saying that it\nis in their possession.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It is information\nthat they can get if they have the correct way of\nsearching it, which is here by name.\nMS. HALLIGAN: And -- and the fact that they\nare drawn to the records because they have stopped this\nindividual and they have this name does not disqualify\nthem from using those records. This Court has cited\nseveral times with approval to a case called Bynum in\nthe D.C. circuit in which there were prints that were\ntaken following an illegal detention, and those prints\nwere suppressed. The prosecution knew that the\ndefendant had committed the crime, because those prints\nhad been taken and matched, and the defendant -- or the\nprosecution was allowed to use a set of prints that it\nalready had in its files on retrial.\nThe same thing happened in both Davis and\nHayes. In fact, in both of those cases, there were\nconvictions on remand, and the prosecution's attention\nwas drawn to the defendant only following some illegal\nactivity.\nI would like to -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you something\nabout the practice in New York? I mean, there is an\nartificiality to this case because we are assuming that\nthe stop was unlawful.\nMS. HALLIGAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the police said it\nwas lawful, because the radio was blasting so loud. Why\ndid this issue even -- the issue of \"suppose it was\nunlawful\" even come up, instead of the city or the\ncounty saying what the police stopped him for was a\ntraffic violation, was perfectly legal? Why get to the\nconstitutional question when the prosecutor brought into\nplay the argument that this was a lawful stop?\nMS. HALLIGAN: The prosecutor made two\narguments on the -- in response to the suppression\nmotion. One was that the DMV records were not subject\nto suppression as a category. The second was, as you\nsay, that the stop was legal. The trial court judge\nruled only on the first ground and did not hold a\nhearing to adjudicate the facts of the stop, and so\nthat's why it comes to you in this posture.\nJUSTICE ALITO: It does seem rather strange.\nThat would have been, like, a 10-minute hearing. Why\ndid you stop him? Well, he was playing the music too\nloud. Defendant testifies, I wasn't playing my music\ntoo loud. The trial judge says, Well, I believe you, or\nI believe you, and that's the end of the matter. It\ndoes seem really -- that's how things are done in trial\ncourt in New York City? You jump to these big\nconstitutional issues and -\nMS. HALLIGAN: I'm not sure that anyone\nrealized that this case would -- would eventually come\nbefore this Court, but that is the way this particular\ncase.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course we know it's too\nloud. It's always too loud.\nMS. HALLIGAN: There's actually a provision\nof the New York City Administrative Code, Your Honor,\nwhich is on point -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are these things\npublic records? If I wanted to find out if you had\nbeen, you know, stopped for driving without a license,\ncan I find that out?\nMS. HALLIGAN: Frankly, I think that's a\ndifficult question, Your Honor. There are certain\nentities to which driving records can be disclosed\npursuant to the Federal Driver's Privacy Protection Act,\nand there are also certain restrictions. So I think the\nanswer to your question would depend on who was asking.\nBut they are certainly the administrative adjudications\nthat are made by a judge in traffic court, and in that\nsense, they are every bit as valid a record as the\ndecision of any other court. There are simply certain\nprotections with respect to DMV records specifically.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Your government records\nargument, is it limited to New York City records or does\nit also apply to FBI records, to records of other cities\nand states which, presumably, would be available on a\nreciprocal basis?\nMS. HALLIGAN: I think it would apply to\nrecords available on a reciprocal basis, Your Honor.\nI would like to touch on the -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, do you see no\ndifference between Crews and Bynum, in the typical case\nwhere the evidence against the defendant is not\ndeveloped as a result of an illegal stop -- it exists\nindependent of that stop -- and one in which the stop\nitself creates the ground for arrest? Don't you see a\ndifference between those two things?\nMS. HALLIGAN: I guess I would say that what\ncreates the grounds for arrest here is the fact that the\nindividual was driving with a suspended license, and\nno -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But there was no\nsuspicion of that when that person was stopped. The\nsuspicion to arrest arose not independent of the\nillegality, but as part of it.\nMS. HALLIGAN: But so, too, with Bynum. It\nwas the match of the prints that caused the prosecutor\nto realize that this individual was guilty -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But all of the evidence\nat trial really had nothing to do with the fingerprint.\nIt had to do with the victims and everyone else walking\nin and saying, That's the guy who did lie to me.\nMS. HALLIGAN: I believe in Bynum, Your\nHonor, the prints were critical, and here the only\nelement -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In the arrest.\nMS. HALLIGAN: No, in the adjudication\nitself. The appellate decision -- may I finish my\nanswer? -- on remand in Bynum went back, suggests that\nthe ability to locate those prior prints in the FBI file\nwas essential to the conviction there.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMs. Halligan.\nMS. HALLIGAN: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Shah.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH,\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE\nMR. SHAH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nPetitioner seeks to suppress official\nrecords that were lawfully in the State's possession\nbefore any Fourth Amendment violation occurred. That\nunprecedented request should be rejected for three\nreasons.\nOne, the DMV records were accessed merely\nthrough use of Petitioner's name; two, those records\nwere produced and possessed by the State long before the\nallegedly illegal stop at issue; and, three, deterrence\ndoes not outweigh the costs, the substantial costs of\nsuppression under the circumstances present here.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is everything that\nthe government has access to through any database\nconsidered in the government's possession?\nMR. SHAH: No, I don't -- I don't think I\nwould go that far in terms of our government records\nargument. I think it would have to be information -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you said -- as\nyou phrased it, I thought it was in the government's\npossession.\nMR. SHAH: Right, effectively in the\ngovernment's possession I think would be the standard.\nSo here I think we're talking, not about Google, but I\nthink we're talking about governmental records.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what's the\ndifference? In either case, they need some search term,\nand then they will get the answers. I don't see why it\nmakes a difference.\nMR. SHAH: I think for the governmental\nrecords part of our argument, that rationale is an\nindependent rationale. The key part of it is that the\ninformation was actually in the government's possession\nbefore the Fourth Amendment violation occurred. I think\nit's fairer to say that governmental records that are\nproduced and owned and possessed by the government\nqualify. I think it's a harder argument to make that\nsomething -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what if -- I'm\nsorry, go ahead.\nMR. SHAH: That something might be -- that\nsomething that could be found by using Google was\nalready in the government's possession before the\nviolation occurred.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what if it's\nin the -- the government of Colorado's possession, and\nthey have an arrangement with New York that they will\nlet them check their files to find out, you know,\nwhatever it is, nationwide or something? Does that -\nyour argument apply to that?\nMR. SHAH: I think it could. I think it\nwould depend on the arrangement. If it's a fully\nreciprocal arrangement that effectively allows the State\nfull access to those records, then I think it may be\ntantamount to the State having effective possession.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: How about private databases\nthat are going to be available to the government upon\nrequest?\nMR. SHAH: I think -- I think that's\nstretching it a little bit further. That's a little bit\nharder. Again, if it were the case that the State could\nbe said to have effectively have possession of those\nrecords because, for example, a copy of them are sitting\non their servers or they have such full access that even\nthough they're prepared by a private database, the State\nhas paid for them, so they're effectively State records,\nthat may also fall within the scope. But those are\nquestions that are essentially pushing the boundary of\nwhat's effectual -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why? The facts of this\ncase, I find confusing. Let's imagine the policeman\ngoes with a hatchet and breaks into somebody's house\nillegally.\nMR. SHAH: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And there, he sees on the\ndesk the name is Dagwood. With other information, he\ngoes to a certain alley and starts shouting \"Dagwood\"\nand people shower him with drugs. You have no doubt, if\nthat is the fruit of the poisonous tree, an out,\ncorrect?\nMR. SHAH: I think if I understand your -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, that's how they -\nthey knew the name, they got the evidence, they get to\nthe place. Without the name, they wouldn't have gotten\nthe drugs.\nMR. SHAH: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Out, right?\nMR. SHAH: If I understand the hypothetical,\nthey break into someone's house -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, illegally. Very\nillegally.\nMR. SHAH: Right, and they find -\nJUSTICE BREYER: His name.\nMR. SHAH: They find the defendant's name?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, correct.\nMR. SHAH: Right. The defendant's name\nitself is not suppressible under these -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I just wondered if you were\ngoing to also say in my example, which I could make more\nrealistic with more time, which you don't want to give\nme, the -- but -- that he uses the name, and as a result\ngets all kinds of evidence in the form of drugs, murder\nvictims, whatever you want. Have you any doubt that\nthat would be suppressible?\nMR. SHAH: I think the government could have\nan argument that the fruits would not be suppressible.\nJUSTICE BREYER: They're not suppressible\nsimply because you get them through a name? You break\ninto a house, get a name; as a result of the name, you\nknow what criminal enterprise to go to; as a result of\nthat criminal enterprise going to, you get every\nevidence under the sun, absolute direct connection. And\nyou say that's not suppressible?\nMR. SHAH: A couple of responses, Your\nHonor. There is, first, already extensive deterrent\nvalue from -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay, okay. I just wanted\nto know the ultimate response.\nMR. SHAH: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now assume it's the\nopposite response. If it's the opposite response, for\nstate of argument, how is it any different whether he's\nshowered with drugs or showered with government records?\nMR. SHAH: Okay. So I think my -- my\nresponse is that the fruits are not necessarily\nsuppressible in your -- in your hypothetical.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know. I wanted you to\nassume the opposite. I got -- you win if my\nhypothetical -- if it's not even drugs, it's not even\ngovernment records. But if it is drugs, why isn't it\ngovernment records? This won't hurt you very much,\nbecause often there will be an alternative source, but\nsuppose there isn't. Why are government records\ndifferent from drugs?\nMR. SHAH: Right. Because the government\nalready possesses those records. Those records were\nwithin the government's possession before any Fourth\nAmendment violation occurred. It would be depriving the\ngovernment of information it already had, and there is\nno precedent within this Court's Fourth Amendment\njurisprudence that would -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Suppose they -- they -- they\nbreak into the house with an axe, and they find out the\nname, they see this guy is Dagwood, and so they run that\nthrough their -- their database, and they find this is\nthe guy we've been looking for, for the last 20 years.\nHe is responsible for all the drugs that come into this\ncountry, he's committed numerous acts of terrorism, he's\na -- he's a serial killer, he's killed 50 people, we've\nbeen chasing him forever, and so the -- the result would\nbe all that knowledge, that this is Dagwood is the fruit\nof the poisonous tree and nothing can be done about\nDagwood?\nMR. SHAH: No, no, Your Honor. I want to be\nvery clear. My response is that that is not subject to\nsuppression. And -- and -- and even my friend on the\nother side conceded that if it were an -- an outstanding\narrest warrant such as in your hypothetical that would\nlead to of the name, even if the name were a fruit of an\nillegal stop or search, that that arrest warrant would\nstill provide a basis to arrest the defendant and\nprosecute the defendant.\nNow, it may be that other fruits that are\ndiscovered in the home or statements taken from the\ndefendant in the home would be suppressed, but certainly\nthe prosecution could proceed under the Ker-Frisbie\nRule, and any preexisting evidence that this person was\nan axe murderer or whatever else evidence that the\ngovernment had would certainly still be admissible in\nthe prosecution for whatever.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You mentioned some -\nbefore you finish, you -- you said a name is not\nsuppressible, and that's because this Court held -- we\nstarted out by saying the observation of the person that\ndropped out of this case, so we're talking only about\nrecords, but the extraction of a name, you say that's\nnot suppressible, even though it was unlawfully\nextracted because there were no reasonable suspicions\nthat this person did anything wrong?\nMR. SHAH: Yes -- yes, Your Honor, we would\nsay that a name is different, that it's not\nsuppressible, and we would rely on the language this\nCourt used in Lopez-Mendoza, which says the respondent's\nbody or identity is never suppressible, even if it's\nobtained as a result of an illegal search, seizure or\ninterrogation.\nWe think name is -- is part and parcel of a\ndefendant's identity, and that it has a special status\nwithin -- within the criminal justice system.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Shah, how would you\nthink about this problem? Suppose the police start\nstopping people and rather than asking for your name,\nthey take a blood sample, they prick your finger, and\nthen they take that blood and they look in their very\nextensive DNA databases, and they discover, oh, this is\na guy who, you know, did these various terrible things,\nand start building cases. Would that be all right?\nMR. SHAH: Your Honor, I think other types\nof biometric evidence that you suggest, for example, of\nblood evidence, might well implicate competing\nconsiderations that would dictate a different result.\nAnd let me suggest a couple of the competing\nconsiderations, why I think the Court doesn't need to\nreach so far and say all sorts of biometric information\nshould be treated the same.\nFor -- for one -- for one thing, things like\na name or even a fingerprint, this Court has said is not\na separate Fourth Amendment event to acquire that. For\nexample, once someone is detained, it's not also a\nsearch to ask for their name or to take a fingerprint.\nHowever, in your example, pricking someone\nwith a needle to obtain their blood would be a separate\nFourth Amendment event, because that would be a separate\ninvasion of their -- of their bodily integrity, privacy,\nand that might warrant different considerations, since\nthere are two violations there. There might be a need\nfor greater deterrent.\nI think the other sort of consideration that\nmight be implicated in -- in that type of hypothetical\nis that evidence unlike a name or fingerprint, DNA\nevidence, for example, that you suggest, might provide\ncompeting considerations in the sense that it could lead\nto other types of information that not -- that may not\nbe relevant to the criminal justice system, medical\nrecords, genetic information. It may pose a specter of\nother competing considerations that might require a\ndifferent balance in the end.\nI think it would be premature for this Court\nto weigh in one way or another as to whether that would\nbe appropriate. I think we would need a record and we\nwould want time to -- to -- to -- we would want that to\nplay out and see -- and see what the consequences were.\nSo I don't think the Court has to go that far. I think\nthe Court can limit it, as in this case, to name,\nfingerprints and other traditionally -- other\ninformation traditionally used to identify a defendant.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Shah.\nMs. Schwarz, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KRISTINA SCHWARZ\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. SCHWARZ: I would first just like to\naddress Justice Breyer's concern about what the rule\nshould be, and -- excuse me. So long as there's\nsufficient causal relationship between the Fourth\nAmendment violation and the later discovery of evidence,\nthis Court has expressed continued allegiance to this\nrule. So in this case the reason why the DMV records\nare suppressible fruit is it fits that classic\ndefinition.\nWhy are the observations suppressible when\nthe identity isn't? That's another issue that was\nraised. The observations are -- again, they fit the\ndefinition whereas the identity does -- does not fit\nthat. The Ker-Frisbie rule prevents a person himself\nfrom being suppressible, but the elicitation of his name\nis something entirely separate. So in other word, in\nthe Crews case a majority of the Court said that a -- a\nperson could not suppress their person or their face\nfrom being in court; five of the justices said that; but\nfive justices said that the in-court identification\ncould under certain circumstances be suppressible. So\nthey drew a distinction between the person's body being\nbrought into court, which is not suppressible because of\nthe Ker-Frisbie rule, and then the evidentiary use of\nthe identity, the fact that the five of the justices\nsaid that in certain circumstances not applicable in\nthat case, the in-court identification could be\nsuppressible shows the distinction. And that's the\ndistinction that has been -- is confusing about this\ncase, because the elicitation of his name is what led to\nthe DMV records. But even if this Court found that the\nelicitation of the name was not sufficient or was\nsomehow related to Ker-Frisbie and could not be\nsuppressible, the DMV records directly flow from the\nFourth Amendment violation here, from the Prouse\nviolation. And so it really doesn't really matter.\nEspecially in light of the decision in Whren\nto remove subjective motivations from the determinations\nof constitutional reasonableness in car stops, it's\nessential to enforce what remains of motorists' core\nFourth Amendment rights; and the Whren standards just\nmust be enforced; otherwise these core Fourth Amendment\nvalues will be undermined and police will be left free\nto stop people on the roads with no objective basis and\ncheck their ID and status and do fishing expeditions\ninto this sea of data that will be linked to the police\ncomputers; and this would violate Prouse and Brown and\nHiibel.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I suppose would\nsubject the police officers to liability, though, right?\nIn civil actions?\nMS. SCHWARZ: Well, again, this is a classic\ncase where there's a clear relationship, a causal\nrelationship, so this is the sort of case where this\nCourt has continued allegiance to application of the\nexclusionary rule where the exclusionary rule is very\nstrong; and so why would the Court say that the second\nsister of the exclusionary rule, in this circumstance\nwhere there's sufficiently deliberate, that exclusion\nwould be meaningful and sufficiently culpable, that the\nevidence would be -- that application of the rule would\nbe worth the cost? In this situation there's no reason\nto abandon the exclusionary rule.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, are you\nagreeing with your adversary that you abandoned and are\nnot entitled to raise the suppressibility of the\nobservation?\nMS. SCHWARZ: No. Well -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And if you're not, in\nwhat ways is it tied to the question presented about\nidentity, which is the issue you sought cert on?\nMS. SCHWARZ: Right. I -- I have no qualms\nin my adversary explaining that the question presented\nwas limited because of the procedure, of the way the\ntrial court's decision was made. However if this Court\nremanded the case, the question of whether the\nobservations were suppressible would be very much at\nplay.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why? Because when he\nentered a guilty plea, you reserved only the question\nconcerning the motor vehicle records; you didn't reserve\nany other questions.\nMS. SCHWARZ: Well, but at the suppression\nhearing, the -- the court would be free to consider all\nof the suppressible fruit, including the -- the\nstatement that was made and the observations and also\nthe DMV records.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
